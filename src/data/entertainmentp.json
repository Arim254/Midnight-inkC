    "body": "\n\tReliance Entertainment will distribute the critically acclaimed period drama “Hamnet” across India in February 2026, as the film gains momentum during awards season.\n\n\tBased on Maggie O’ Farrell’s book, the film follows William Shakespeare (Paul Mescal), who is in the midst of writing his latest play. He finds love with Agnes (Jessie Buckley) but also experiences grief when his young son, Hamnet (Jacobi Jupe), succumbs to the plague. The story of love, loss and grief lead to him writing his tragedy “Hamlet.” Chloe Zhao directed the feature, with Sam Mendes and Steven Spielberg serving as producers.\n\t\n\n\t“’Hamnet’ marks Zhao’s first feature since her ambitious Marvel stumble in 2021 (a pivot that alienated some who preferred her magic-hour indie dramas), raising once again that eternal question, ‘To be or not to be,’ just not in the conventional sense. In her hands, Shakespeare’s indelible line doesn’t represent a contemplation of suicide so much as what it means to be — to fully embrace life, when the inevitability of death is enough to paralyze one into a self-protective stupor. Ultimately, the filmmaker invites the world to feel loss in a new way, and in letting go, liberates something fundamental in all of us,” wrote Peter Debruge, reviewing the film for Variety.\n\n\n\tThe film has earned 11 nominations at the Critics Choice Awards and six Golden Globe nominations, establishing itself as a major contender in this year’s awards race. \n\n\t“We are thrilled to bring ‘Hamnet’ to audiences in India,” said Dhruv Sinha, head of international business at Reliance Entertainment. “The film has resonated deeply with global viewers and critics alike, and its extraordinary recognition at the Critics Choice Awards and Golden Globes is a testament to its emotional power and artistic brilliance. Reliance Entertainment is committed to delivering world-class cinema to Indian audiences, and ‘Hamnet’ is a shining example of storytelling that transcends borders.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJapan‘s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is extending its film and television incentive program through fiscal year 2026 with enhanced provisions designed to attract more overseas productions, the Visual Industry Promotion Organization and Japan Film Commission has revealed.\n\n\tThe most significant change to the scheme is the introduction of multi-year subsidies, enabling projects to receive support spanning up to two years. This marks a departure from the previous system’s rigid timeline requirements for expense reporting.\n\t\n\n\tUnder the earlier framework, only expenses reported by the end of January following the grant decision qualified for reimbursement. A one-year project in the current fiscal year had to run from March 27, 2025, to Jan. 31, 2026. The updated program allows expenses spanning multiple fiscal years and accommodates project timelines that cross the Japanese fiscal year boundary.\n\n\n\tThe revamped incentive scheme is scheduled to launch in late spring 2026, with application guidelines to be announced at a later date.\n\n\tSince its inception in 2023, the program has supported 18 film and television projects through the end of 2025. Notable productions include “The Smashing Machine,” starring Dwayne Johnson as UFC fighter Mark Kerr, which earned director Benny Safdie the Silver Lion for best director at the Venice Film Festival earlier this year.\n\n\tThe U.S.-Japan co-production “Rental Family,” directed by Hikari and starring Brendan Fraser, premiered in the special presentation section at the Toronto International Film Festival and subsequently played at the London and Tokyo festivals. The film follows an American actor in Japan who joins a “rental family” agency.\n\t\n\n\tThe program has also backed the second season of “Drops of God,” the International Emmy Award-winning French-Japanese drama about gastronomy and fine wines. Starring Fleur Geffrier and Tomohisa Yamashita, the series is adapted from the New York Times bestselling Japanese manga.\n\n\tThe program is a METI initiative, with VIPO serving as operator and the Japan Film Commission coordinating.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJosh Hutcherson said during a recent appearance on Jesse Tyler Ferguson’s “Dinner’s On Me” podcast that he “knew only success” in the early stages of his career, but after starring in “The Hunger Games” franchise, he learned how “complicated” the film industry could be.\n\n\t“I didn’t learn rejection ever,” Hutcherson said. “I knew only success from the age 9 to, like, 24, then kind of post ‘Hunger Games’ world. Because ‘Hunger Games’ set things up. The industry is so goddamn tricky because they set you up in this way where they’re like, ‘You’ve arrived. You now are working with Jennifer Lawrence and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and you’re in this movie that makes billions of dollars, you’re the second lead of the film.'”\n\t\n\n\tThe “I Love LA” star explained that, as “quickly as they’re excited to get you into the spotlight,” the opportunities start to fade. After his ample success as a young actor, Hutcherson said he experienced his first feelings of “disappointment, failure [and] rejection” around age 25.\n\n\n\t“It was just like a string of no one calling, not getting any offers, auditioning, but not getting cast,” Hutcherson recalled. “It’s this whole thing of, ‘Oh wow, I have my career that I’ve had since I was 9 years old. It’s always worked. I always got cast.’ Of course, there are things that you don’t get cast in, but I had only known that the chances are, if I was auditioning, was going to book it. That is just not the reality at all.”\n\n\tHutcherson starred in 2012’s “The Hunger Games” at 18 years old. The film spawned three sequels, ending in 2015 with “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2.” His more recent credits include “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” “The Beekeeper” and the HBO series “I Love LA.”\n\t\n\n\tIn a recent interview with Variety, Hutcherson said he would happily return to the “Hunger Games” franchise without a second thought.\n\n\t“I would love to be back on set with Francis, with Jen, with Liam, with Woody,” he said. “It would not take any convincing at all. I’d be there in a heartbeat.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBuffalo 8 has secured worldwide rights to “The World’s Happiest Man,” the Bhutanese-Nepali-American drama starring Oscar and Emmy nominee Bruce Dern. A trailer has been unveiled. \n\n\tDern (“Nebraska,” “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”) stars alongside Nepali stalwarts Haribansha Acharya and Dayahang Rai in the ensemble drama from writer-director Binod Paudel. The cast also includes Aditi Pyakurel, Joes Pandey, Richa Ghimire, Pooja Chand, Anuradha Majumder, Bimal Subedi, Gurpreet Singh and Tom Crain.\n\t\n\n\tSet in Akron, Ohio, the film centers on Bishnu, a Bhutanese Nepali who has built a new life in America but dreams of returning to Bhutan one final time. After receiving a devastating visa denial, Bishnu dies unexpectedly, triggering a spiritual, emotional and cultural reckoning across three generations of his family as they debate how to honor him and what “home” truly means.\n\n\n\tPaudel, known for “Bulbul” and “Awaken Eyes,” draws from Bhutanese-Nepali diaspora experiences and the community’s significant presence in the American Midwest.\n\n\tThe film participated in the 2019 Busan Asian Project Market. Paudel produced alongside Rajendra Thakurathi, Amitabh Joshi, Kirtana Banskota and Abeeral Thapa. L.N. Adhikari, Kaushila Karmacharya, Ramesh Bhatta and Apaar Shrestha serve as executive producers.\n\n\tBuffalo 8 will handle the launch across TVOD and digital platforms, with a broader international rollout planned through early 2026.\n\n\tThe film will be available for pre-order on Fandango at Home starting Dec. 26, ahead of its Jan. 9, 2026, on-demand release in the U.S. The film will debut on Amazon, Fandango at Home, Verizon Fios and major cable providers, with additional territories and platforms to follow. \n\t\n\n\tWatch the trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet” lands an outstanding cast ensemble nomination at the Actors Awards — the newly renamed Screen Actors Guild Awards — one of the film’s most essential performers will not be recognized alongside his colleagues.\n\n\tThe official ensemble submission lists Jessie Buckley, Paul Mescal, Emily Watson, Joe Alwyn and Noah Jupe as the eligible cast members. Missing is Jacobi Jupe, the young actor whose emotionally resonant turn as the title character has been one of the season’s standout discoveries.\n\t\n\n\tAwards analyst Will Mavity first flagged the exclusion on his X account, noting that despite Jacobi Jupe’s prominence in the film, he was not submitted as part of the ensemble. Mavity shared the film’s official submission, drawing attention to the implications should “Hamnet” earn an ensemble nomination.\n\n\n\tAccording to SAG-AFTRA’s official rules for the outstanding cast category, eligibility is determined strictly by the performers submitted by the film’s producing or distributing entity. The guild outlines the following key requirement: Motion picture cast inclusion requires single-card main title billing.\n\n\tHowever, if an actor shares a title card with other performers, all can be submitted. For example, Chadwick Boseman and Viola Davis shared title cards for “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” and Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande share a title card in both Part 1 and 2 versions of “Wicked.”\n\n\tOnly performers who receive single-card billing in the main titles — or who are otherwise submitted by producers as principal cast — may be included in the ensemble roster.\n\t\n\n\tThis rule means that even though child actors can be nominated as part of an ensemble, they must formally meet the principal cast criteria. If a performer is not included in the initial submission, they cannot be added retroactively once nominations are announced.\n\n\tIn “Hamnet,” Jacobi Jupe does not receive single-card main title billing and shares a card with Olivia Lynes, who plays his twin sister Judith. Bodhi Rae Breathnach, who plays the older Shakespeare daughter Susanna, shares a card with two other actors.\n\n\tInterestingly, Noah Jupe, Jacobi’s real-life older brother, who plays the actor playing Hamlet at the opening of the tragic Shakespeare classic, will be among the nominated ensemble if recognized.\n\n\tNonetheless, Jacobi Jupe, 10, is still eligible — and quietly competitive — in the supporting actor category. The film’s awards strategy positions Paul Mescal as a likely nominee for supporting actor, but Jupe’s performance has earned widespread critical affection and could attract guild support independently of the ensemble race.\n\n\tSAG-AFTRA has historically embraced breakout young performers when they deliver work on par with their adult co-stars, leaving open the possibility that Jacobi Jupe may still find recognition.\n\n\tIf “Hamnet” receives an ensemble nomination without its title character represented, it would spotlight the strategic and contractual complexities behind award submissions — particularly in a film driven by its youngest performer.\n\n\tAs the SAG NomCom voters assess “Hamnet’s” place in the season, the handling of its ensemble and how billing and submission choices operate, could bring to light a much-needed rules update.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe International Film Festival of Kerala has unveiled a 14-title international competition lineup that stretches from India’s Khasi Hills to Latin America, East Asia and the Middle East, anchoring the 30th edition of the festival in Thiruvananthapuram from Dec. 12–19.\n\n\tRepresenting the home state are Sanju Surendran’s “If on a Winter’s Night,” a Malayalam- and Hindi-language feature and Unnikrishnan Avala’s Malayalam drama “Life of a Phallus.” The Indian presence continues with Pradip Kurbah’s Khasi-language film “The Elysian Field” and “Shadowbox,” co-directed by Tanushree Das and Saumyananda Sahi.\n\t\n\n\tLatin America appears strongly this year. Ecuadorian filmmaker Ana Cristina Barragán brings “Hiedra,” while Swiss-Argentine director Milagros Mumenthaler’s “The Currents” and Chilean filmmaker Nayra Ilic’s “Cuerpo Celeste” join the slate. Argentina’s Luis Zorraquín adds “Kissing Bug,” and “Before the Body,” directed by Carina Piazza and Lucía Bracelis, also represents Argentina.\n\n\n\tCentral and West Asia are represented through Shahram Mokri’s Tajikistan–U.A.E. feature “Black Rabbit, White Rabbit” and Mohamed Rashad’s cross-regional drama “The Settlement,” spanning Egypt, France, Germany, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Turkey–Iran director Gözde Kural adds “Cinema Jazireh” to the competition lineup.\n\n\tFrom East Asia comes Tom Shu-yu Lin’s Taiwan feature “Yen and Ai-Lee” and Sho Miyake’s “Two Seasons, Two Strangers” from Japan. \n\n\tBeyond the competition, IFFK leans into its traditional strength: mapping the breadth of Malayalam and Indian cinema. The Malayalam Cinema Today strand includes new works such as “All the Living,” “Ambrosia,” “Await,” “Celebration of Death,” “Desire,” “Ebb,” “Girl and the Fools Parade,” “OAK” and others, underlining the diversity and restlessness of Kerala’s filmmaking ecosystem.\n\t\n\n\tIndian Cinema Now broadens the scope with a slate including Kannada, Hindi, Bengali and multilingual Indian titles such as “Don’t Tell Mother,” “Flames,” “Full Plate,” “Hearth and Home,” “Mirage,” Venice winner “Songs of Forgotten Trees” and “Theatre.”\n\n\tThe Kaleidoscope section brings together eight films from across India, all of which have tasted global festival success, reinforcing the festival’s commitment to showcasing formally adventurous and regionally diverse work. The slate includes the Tamil feature “Bad Girl”; the Sundance-winning Marathi film “Cactus Pears” (“Sabar Bonda”); Hindi titles “Homebound,” which is India’s Oscar contender this year, “Pyre” and “Secret of a Mountain Serpent”; the Assamese-language “Kok Kok Kokoook”; the Nepali- and Sikkimese-language film “Shape of Momo”; and the Kannada–Malayalam production “Tiger’s Pond” (“Vaghachipani”).\n\n\tThis year’s Country Focus turns to Vietnam, presenting a curated five-film selection including “Cu Li Never Cries,” “Don’t Cry, Butterfly,” “Glorious Ashes,” “Once Upon a Love Story” and “The Tree House,” all emblematic of the country’s growing global festival presence.\n\n\tIndonesia’s Garin Nugroho is honored with a Contemporary Filmmaker in Focus tribute featuring “A Poet: Unconcealed Poetry,” “Birdman Tale,” “Letter to an Angel,” “Samsara” and “Whispers in the Dabbas.”\n\n\tIFFK also mounts retrospectives for two pivotal Indian filmmakers: Ritwik Ghatak, with screenings of “Meghe Dhaka Tara,” “Komal Gandhar,” “Subarnarekha” and “Titash Ekti Nadir Naam”; and Saeed Mirza, with “Arvind Desai Ki Ajeeb Dastaan,” “Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro” and “Naseem.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndian streaming giant JioHotstar is scaling its South India operations following dramatic audience growth over the past 10 months, with executives detailing the strategic rationale behind the platform’s INR4,000 crore ($445 million) content investment unveiled on Tuesday in Chennai.\n\n\tKrishnan Kutty, head of entertainment for JioHotstar’s South cluster, and Sushant Sreeram, chief marketing officer and head of SVOD business at JioStar, spoke about the behavioral shifts that convinced the platform to significantly expand its regional programming slate.\n\t\n\n\tThe South region – comprising the Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam languages – now accounts for approximately 35% of entertainment watch time and nearly 25% of total entertainment viewership on JioHotstar, according to Kutty. Since the platform’s launch, video views have grown close to 70% while watch time has increased by approximately 160%.\n\n\n\t“Over the last 10 months we have seen sustained behavior shifts across the South,” Kutty says. “Viewers in these markets also spend meaningfully more time with us. They watch roughly 70% more minutes than the national average, explore around 20% more titles and sample a wider range of genres.”\n\n\tConnected TV adoption has particularly strengthened viewing patterns, with close to 45% of viewing in the South now occurring on large screens. The platform currently reaches approximately 400 million users monthly.\n\n\tThe newly announced slate leans heavily on returning seasons, reflecting audience engagement patterns that have emerged as a key performance indicator for the platform. Kutty cited “Heartbeat” as a prime example, noting the series has crossed 100 million hours of watch time and become the biggest long-running JioHotstar special in its category.\n\t\n\n\t“When audiences connect deeply with a story world, they do not treat it as a one-time viewing experience,” Kutty explains. “That behavior has become one of the strongest signals across the last year.”\n\n\tThe platform has observed similar patterns with “Save the Tigers,” “Kerala Crime Files” and “Police Police,” where returning seasons generate both anticipation and repeat viewing. According to Kutty, this consistency matters significantly in a subscription environment, driving retention and strengthening viewing habits.\n\n\t“The more familiar and emotionally resonant the world becomes, the stronger the renewal intent,” he says. “That is why long-running storytelling is not only a creative choice — it is now a core structural pillar of how the slate is being built.”\n\n\tThe platform is also deepening investment in talent-driven originals, including the recently announced “Kaattaan” starring Vijay Sethupathi and “Pharma” featuring Nivin Pauly. Kutty positioned these projects as a natural evolution rather than a strategic pivot.\n\n\t“Our starting point is always the story,” Kutty says. “When a narrative demands a certain emotional scale or storytelling ambition, pairing it with established talent helps it land with immediacy and travel faster across markets.”\n\n\tWith the platform now serving hundreds of millions of users and more than 200 million paid subscribers, Kutty argues there is room for vision-driven, marquee originals that justify scale. He characterizes working with leading talent as a natural next step in building stories that feel distinctive, premium and exportable while staying rooted in local creative strength.\n\n\tThe expanded slate spans crime, legal drama, relationship stories, youth titles and experimental genres. Kutty describes the commissioning approach as grounding the slate in what South audiences consistently value while creating space for ideas that signal where their tastes are heading.\n\n\t“The South viewer today is digital first, highly discerning and confident in engaging with new storytelling styles culturally rooted,” he says. “That gives us room to pair familiar formats with worlds that push creative boundaries.”\n\n\tAccording to Kutty, approximately 75% of this year’s South originals have chosen JioHotstar as their home.\n\t\n\n\t“The stories here are deeply authentic, drawn from lived experiences, genuine emotions, and strong cultural identities,” Kutty says. “Time and again, we see that the most rooted stories often become the most universal.”\n\n\tThe rise of connected TV viewing in the South is directly influencing commissioning decisions, according to Kutty. CTV households show higher repeat viewing and longer session times compared to mobile-only users, reintroducing shared living-room viewing alongside mobile-first digital consumption.\n\n\t“We are now assessing whether a story has the depth, pacing and world building to sustain longer-format viewing and whether it has multi-season potential, because longer arcs and returning formats are performing strongly in CTV households,” Kutty explains.\n\n\tHowever, mobile continues to drive everyday engagement, requiring stories to remain accessible, immediate and easy to enter. Commissioning now balances both behaviors, looking for concepts that can operate across screens — premium enough for the big screen and personal enough for the phone, according to Kutty.\n\n\tFrom a subscription and marketing perspective, Sreeram attributes the South region’s acceleration to clear shifts in audience behavior. The region’s viewers are watching more, exploring more genres and sampling across languages at significantly higher rates.\n\n\t“South users also spend nearly 70% more time on the platform compared to the rest of India, which has been a strong driver of sustained subscription growth,” Sreeram says.\n\n\tA key factor driving subscription momentum is how South stories are traveling across the country, with titles breaking out well beyond their home markets.\n\n\t“As more titles break out, we see a clear flywheel where wider discovery leads to higher engagement which, in turn, strengthens subscription momentum,” Sreeram explains.\n\n\tThe platform’s 2025 strategy is focused on consistency, discovery and scale in response to evolving South viewer behavior. JioHotstar is expanding a significant volume of fresh South programming over the next year while deepening its creator base.\n\n\t“Malayalam films now see more than 80% of their watch time coming from outside Kerala, and titles like ‘Heartbeat’ have crossed 100 million hours of viewing,” Sreeram says. “This nationwide discovery means our slate for 2025 must be designed to move across regions and languages with ease.”\n\t\n\n\tSreeram acknowledges that Tamil and Malayalam audiences behave differently from Telugu and Kannada viewers, requiring tailored approaches that don’t fragment the platform’s unified brand identity.\n\n\t“Tamil and Malayalam viewers are highly exploratory, deeply engaged and respond strongly to culturally rooted, emotionally layered storytelling,” Sreeram says. “Telugu and Kannada audiences lean into scale, energy and high impact formats and often drive some of the biggest breakout moments on the platform.”\n\n\tThe localization occurs through personalization rather than brand fragmentation. Viewers see a surface that is culturally fluent and relevant to their tastes while the overall product experience remains consistent across the country, according to Sreeram.\n\n\t“We keep the brand unified and use data, personalization and design to deliver nuance,” he explains. “The viewer gets an experience that feels tailored without the platform becoming four different products.”\n\n\tCross-market sampling represents sustained loyalty rather than casual discovery, according to Sreeram. JioHotstar now serves 100% of India’s post codes, with South entertainment reaching 99.96% of them. Films including “Lokah Chapter 1: Chandra,” “Mirai,” “Thudarum” and “Tourist Family” have achieved record-breaking or nationwide viewership.\n\n\t“These titles are no longer confined to their home markets; they are becoming national hits,” Sreeram says.\n\n\tThe platform focuses on high-quality dubbing and subtitling that maintain authenticity while opening access. Personalized rows and geo-aware recommendations help viewers discover titles based on tone, theme and interest rather than linguistic familiarity.\n\n\t“Bigg Boss” – the Indian version of the “Big Brother” format – continues as a major cultural engine for the platform, but Sreeram emphasizes that unscripted and scripted programming play different but complementary roles. The platform currently produces four “Bigg Boss” editions across South languages.\n\n\t“‘Bigg Boss’ powers frequency, community and monetization, especially with the scale it commands on Connected TV and through live interactions,” Sreeram says. “Scripted originals build depth, long-term value and renewal intent, with creators returning season after season.”\n\t\n\n\tThe platform is significantly expanding its focus on unscripted content for the South beyond “Bigg Boss.” According to Sreeram, the region has strong appetite for high-impact, participative formats.\n\n\t“‘Bigg Boss’ is only the beginning,” Sreeram says. “The pipeline ahead reflects a clear ambition to grow unscripted [as] one of our core pillar[s] of our entertainment strategy.”\n\n\tThe announced slate includes new unscripted formats “Comedy Cooks,” “Mad for Each Other” and “Second Love,” along with “Roadies” debuting in Telugu, marking the first time the adventure format will be produced for South Indian audiences.\n\n\tEmerging creators are already integrated into how JioHotstar builds its South slate, according to Kutty. More than 500 creators — writers, directors and showrunners across South languages — have joined the JioHotstar ecosystem over the past 10 months, and a significant share of South streaming originals now sits on the platform.\n\n\tViewer behavior reinforces this direction, with audiences in the South watching more titles, exploring more genres and sampling across languages. That curiosity gives newer voices room to build distinctive story worlds alongside established talent, Kutty notes.\n\n\t“So the approach now is structured,” he says. “We are putting clear pathways and development support in place across key South markets to ensure emerging storytellers come into the slate through consistent opportunities, not isolated projects.”\n\n\tThe commissioning strategy follows a logic of building a slate where experienced and emerging creators scale together rather than sequentially, according to Kutty.\n\n\tAs part of its partnership with the Government of Tamil Nadu announced at the Chennai event, JioHotstar will introduce creator-focused initiatives including writing labs, mentorship programs and skill-building workshops aimed at nurturing filmmakers, writers, editors and digital storytellers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIMDb has unveiled its annual ranking of the most popular Indian series of 2025, with Aryan Khan‘s “The Ba***ds of Bollywood” claiming the top spot among global viewers.\n\n\tThe rankings are determined by page views from IMDb’s more than 250 million monthly visitors worldwide and include series released in India between Jan. 1 and Nov. 30, 2025, with an average user rating of 6 or higher.\n\n\n\tThe top 10 list skews heavily toward crime thrillers, with seven of the titles falling into that genre. Six entries represent either new seasons or extensions of existing franchises, including Prime Video’s “Paatal Lok” Season 2 at No. 3, “Panchayat” Season 4 at No. 4, and “The Family Man” Season 3 at No. 9.\n\t\n\n\tThe streaming landscape is represented by three major platforms: Netflix and Prime Video each claim four titles, while JioHotstar accounts for two entries.\n\n\n\tNetflix’s “Black Warrant,” the Vikramaditya Motwane-directed prison drama, secured the No. 2 position, followed by Prime Video’s return of the neo-noir crime series “Paatal Lok” Season 2. Also from Prime Video, the comedy-drama “Panchayat” Season 4 continued its popular run at No. 4.\n\n\tRounding out the Netflix entries are “Mandala Murders” (No. 5), a mythological crime thriller, and “Khakee: The Bengal Chapter” (No. 8), the standalone sequel to the Bihar-set crime series.\n\n\tPrime Video’s horror thriller “Khauf” claimed the No. 6 position, while JioHotstar’s espionage series “Special Ops” Season 2 landed at No. 7. The list concludes with Prime Video’s spy thriller “The Family Man” Season 3 at No. 9 and JioHotstar’s legal drama “Criminal Justice: A Family Matter” at No. 10.\n\t\n\n\tKhan, who directed the Netflix chart-topper, celebrated the achievement in a statement, calling the show “a pop cultural phenomenon” that captures “the madness, the magic, the mischief, and the raw ambition that fuels this industry.”\n\n\t“No soft edges, no pretending, we told the story the way it deserved to be told, and audiences across the world showed up for it in a massive way,” Khan said. “The memes, the fan edits, the arguments, the obsession — that’s a show becoming part of culture, not just a weekend watch.”\n\n\t“The Most Popular Indian Series of 2025 lists demonstrate the boldness and innovation of Indian creators,” added Yaminie Patodia, head of IMDb India. “The diverse range of storytelling, spanning from romance to animation, superhero epics to satire, reflects the industry’s vibrancy. It’s especially exciting to see distinctly Indian stories and cultural narratives resonating with audiences around the world.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Owning Manhattan” is back on Netflix, and so is its star Ryan Serhant.\n\n\tBut this time around, things are different. Serhant isn’t just selling Manhattan’s premium real estate. He’s still on his quest to build the number one brokerage on earth, and he’s also trying to be number one daddy to his daughter. However, Serhant’s business is booming and growing at an exponential rate, and Serhant can’t be everywhere.\n\n\n\tAs he previously told Variety, the show came out in June 2024, and Serhant gained a million followers and subscribers across accounts just from the global awareness. Serhant said, “We were in a couple of markets, but we were predominantly in Manhattan.” He continued, “18 months later, I just opened in my 14th state. We went from a couple of hundred people to 1500 people. Now I have a staff of 200 to help manage.”\n\t\n\n\tSeason 2 shows a new, vulnerable and emotional side to Serhant that audiences and fans alike have never seen. Aside from the personal woes, the new season also introduces some new characters and plenty of Manhattan real estate.\n\n\tWorld of Wonder co-founders and the show’s executive producers, Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, also produced Bravo’s “Million Dollar Listing,” and cast the rising realtor in the New York edition of the franchise. The two spoke with Variety about the new season, what it was like seeing this new side of Serhant, and shared whether there are similarities between realtors and drag queens.\n\t\n\t\tThis was such a fascinating season to see Ryan at his most emotional and vulnerable as he struggles with his work-life balance. What was it like for you to witness this raw side of him?\t\n\n\tFenton Bailey: Ryan often presents himself as a selling machine, but there’s another side to him that he keeps closely guarded. Seeing that side was really great because, perhaps, some people don’t believe he has it. He won’t like me for saying this, but he’s a big old softie.\n\t\n\n\tRandy Barbato: He’s the original media beast. This is the first time he’s truly revealed the depth of his vulnerability, and that’s what makes this season so compelling. It’s also why Ryan has been so successful for so long, he isn’t just a selling machine. There’s a real depth to him that allows people to connect.\n\t\n\t\tSeason 2 has just dropped on Netflix. How would you describe it?\t\n\n\tBailey: There’s something about “Owning Manhattan” that goes beyond being a real estate soap opera. In this moment, you’re seeing who’s buying what, but you’re also witnessing the transformation of media, from legacy media to creator culture. Ryan is selling apartments, spectacular condos and properties, but he’s also, essentially, a creator. Today, everyone is a creator in this media space. We’re all selling all the time. That’s the hidden value of “Owning Manhattan.” It’s not just about real estate; it’s about the art of the sell. More and more, selling has become relatable and universal to the American experience, I think now than just being about someone building a property empire.\n\n\tBarbato: It’s about how to survive during times of epic transformation, which makes it incredibly relatable. Whether it’s the unknown of what is happening in the landscape of our entertainment landscape of our entertainment industry, to the most personal things of how you navigate your devices at home. You’re watching this guy who is this “Master of the Universe” succeed in his business, but also coping with this new world that we’re living in. I think it is more relatable a season of anything we’ve ever produced. Not just of “Owning Manhattan,” but for all the real estate shows we’ve worked on over the past two decades.\n\t\n\t\tGiven how much Serhant has grown, are you thinking of expanding the show to “Owning Florida” or other areas?\t\n\n\tBarbato: I think geography is too limiting. The next season should be “Owning Everything.” There are no boundaries when it comes to Ryan’s imagination and business acumen, and that’s what makes him so compelling. People who follow Ryan and Serhant know how sophisticated he is. He’s always aware of the camera, but the show is designed to be very broad, but it’s also designed for an audience with discerning tastes.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWas there a particular property that stood out to you this season as something you were invested in, wondering whether it would sell?\t\n\n\tBailey: I’ve been fascinated by the skinny scrapers story (Central Park Tower). I love the concept, especially the idea of the largest, most expensive property in the world. Things are not always what they seem. I suppose that always stuck out to me. But that’s more season one.\n\n\tBarbato: I have more modest tastes than most…\n\n\tBailey: I also liked that building with Anna Delvey.\n\t\n\t\tThis season introduces some new characters. What was it like seeing the new realtors? Not to compare them to the queens of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” but it’s always exciting to see what they’re like and what drama they’ll bring.\t\n\n\tBarbato: It’s very exciting to have new characters. By the way, someone who isn’t a new character but who we got to see in a new light this season is Amelia, Ryan’s wife, who is amazing. She has always been in the background. This season, she organically played a pretty important role, which was very satisfying for me to watch.\n\n\tBut it’s funny, I think you can equate real estate agents to drag queens because there are so many similarities. Drag queens and realtors are masters of invention. They have to be able to do everything and lip sync for their lives. I think we’re attracted to them because they have so many similarities, selling a property or selling a garment.\n\n\tBailey: To live is to perform, and to perform is to live.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

As you can see, Andy is completely out of it with his signature spectacles lying on the ground in front of him.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Eyewitnesses tell us several of Andy's friends ran up to him to try to revive him with one screaming at Andy to \"wake up.\" Other people called an ambulance.\n      \n\n          We're told a bystander shouted for someone to grab Narcan, a life saving medication used to reverse the affects of opioid overdoses, and Andy was administered the shot.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          A rep for the Los Angeles Fire Department tells TMZ ... they responded to the location for an overdose involving a 59 year old man. The rep said the man was not transported to a hospital.\n      \n    \n          Often times when Narcan is administered to drug users, they regain consciousness and refuse medical attention, walking away to go about their business.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          It's no secret Andy's been dealing with substance abuse for years and has had numerous run ins with the law.\n      \n    \n          The Los Angeles Police Department was also called to the scene after receiving the same overdose call.\n      \n    \n          We spoke to Andy by phone Tuesday night ... he tells us he's alive and relieved he's okay but he wouldn't elaborate on what happened.\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

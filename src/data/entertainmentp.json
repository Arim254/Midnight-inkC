    "body": "\n\tNBCUniversal is building on the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade this year with the introduction of a new feature: the chance to watch the annual programming in Peacock’s three-angle Mulitivew option, including a livestream positioned right on the main float itself.\n\n\tThe 99th annual parade’s broadcast will be begin Nov. 27 at 8:30 a.m. in all time zones across NBC and streamer Peacock with “Wicked” star Cynthia Erivo performing the opening number and “Today” show staple’s Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Al Roker returning as hosts for the event, which last year drew a record 31.7 million viewers.\n\t\n\n\tPeacock subscribers will be able to utilize Mulitview to see the 99th annual “Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade” events from three different camera angles:\n\n\n\tTraditional Programming (primary view): The Parade as fans know and love it will feature commentary from NBC hosts, live performances, and more.\n\n\tFloat View: Ride aboard the classic Tom the Turkey float through the streets of Manhattan and truly feel like a part of the Parade.\n\n\tHigh-Rise View: Get a bird’s eye view of all the excitement from high above the parade route.\n\n\tThis marks the first time Peacock has offered Multiview for a live entertainment special. Previously, the feature was launched as part of the 2024 Paris Olympics streaming experience, where more than a quarter of Olympics viewers on Peacock watched via Multiview, and later for Premier League games and NBC News’ 2024 Election Night coverage. The option will also be available for the upcoming 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\n\tIn addition to Erivo, Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade performers will include EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI, the singing voices of HUNTR/X from Netflix’s “KPop Demon Hunters,” the casts of Broadway’s “Buena Vista Social Club,” “Just in Time,” and “Ragtime,” and the Radio City Rockettes, as well as Drew Baldridge, Matteo Bocelli, Colbie Caillat, Ciara, Gavin DeGraw, Meg Donnelly, Mr. Fantasy, Foreigner, Debbie Gibson, Mickey Guyton, Christopher Jackson, Jewel, Lil Jon, Kool & the Gang, Darlene Love, Roman Mejia, Taylor Momsen, Tiler Peck, Busta Rhymes, Calum Scott, Shaggy, Lauren Spencer Smith, Luísa Sonza and Teyana Taylor. \n\t\n\n\t“The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade is the perfect moment for Multiview, allowing fans to catch never-before-seen viewpoints along the parade route, alongside the iconic floats and live performances,” said Matt Strauss, Chairman, NBCUniversal Media Group. “Finding ways to enhance how our audiences enjoy our beloved programming and deliver unique viewing experiences and features is central to how we continue to raise the bar for live streaming on Peacock.”\n\n\t“Kicking off this holiday season, we never fail to take for granted the trusted relationship we have with our viewers and business partners and are thrilled audiences continue to make NBC part of their traditions,” said Jen Neal, Executive Vice President, Live Events and Specials, NBCUniversal Entertainment. “Like this year with Multiview, we continually strive to improve our telecast and proudly delivering this parade into people’s home is another example of how we strive to bring families together.”\n\n\tThis year, the Comcast-owned NBCUniversal says it has seen a nearly 20% increase in overall holiday advertiser spending from 2024, including significantly more demand from tech, pharma, insurance, and restaurants. Additionally, 15% of advertisers are new, with this marking the first time they have invested in NBCUniversal’s holiday portfolio. Among NBCU’s holiday ad products, Peacock is offering shoppable ad innovations, like a holiday gift guide, and an expansion of “virtual concessions” into holiday classics programming.\n\n\t“Year after year NBCUniversal is the destination for holiday audiences, and this year brands are engaging like never before,” said Alison Levin, President, Advertising & Partnership, NBCUniversal. “With content that reaches viewers across platforms, creates deep engagement and moments of togetherness, and a slate of new ad innovations, we’re helping partners build meaningful connections with consumers during the most important season of the year.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTwo-time Grammy nominee Madison Beer is offering a closer look at the making of “bittersweet,” the emotional new single from her upcoming third studio album “Locket,” set to be released January 16. The track follows her first single from the project, “Yes Baby,” and marks her return to music after her album “Silence Between Songs,” released in September 2023. Beer said “bittersweet” emerged from a moment she felt compelled to document, calling it a turning point in the deeply personal world she explores throughout the new album.\n\t\n\n\tIn an interview for Variety’s Behind the Song presented by TikTok, Beer reveals that her fans played a meaningful role in shaping the sound of her new work. “I am very close with my fans and their opinions definitely mean a lot to me,” she said. Touring, she added, gives her immediate feedback about which moments resonate most. “I can see what people are reacting to; the moments of the show they post the most,” she said. Her fans also inspired her to bring back ad-libs, something she used heavily early in her career but later moved away from. “My fans are always like, ‘Girl, you do so much fun stuff on stage — do it in your songs,’” she said. Their encouragement led her to include subtle ad-libs in “bittersweet,” helping her reconnect with a part of her artistry she once loved: “I fell in love with doing ad-libs again because of this song.”\n\n\tThe song itself began when Beer felt compelled to process a difficult emotional experience through music. “I was going through something very emotional and real and I was like, ‘I need to write about this. It feels insane not to,’” she said. Though the track centers on heartbreak, she said it reflects a larger personal evolution. “I can be bitter over things, but I’m choosing to be bittersweet,” she chuckles.\n\t\n\n\tBeer’s longtime collaboration with music producer Tim Sommers — known professionally as One Love — played a key role in shaping the track. The two have worked together since 2016, a partnership Beer believes has helped fuel her artistic growth. “We have a language,” she explained. “I can say, ‘Make that weirder,’ which isn’t a technical thing to say, and he knows exactly what I mean.”\n\n\tTogether, they leaned into unusual textures and nostalgic tones throughout the track, including synth moments that reminded Beer of early-2000s video game, “Super Mario Galaxy.” She noted her enduring affection for “anything that’s distorted and kind of weird sounding.”\n\n\tIn the bridge, the song shifts into a more confrontational tone. “There has to be a moment where you’re like, ‘No, you did me dirty,’” she said. She incorporated that emotional shift into the song before returning to a final note of acceptance. “At the end of the day, you’ll know I tried my best with you,” she said.\n\n\tBeer also spoke about the growing attention around the “bittersweet” music video — which has surpassed 8.9 million views on YouTube — featuring Sean Kaufman, who portrays Steven Conklin in the hit series “The Summer I Turned Pretty.” She admitted she hadn’t seen the show before casting him. “I am totally a fraud and I have never seen ‘The Summer I Turned Pretty,’” she confessed, adding that her unfamiliarity ultimately made their collaboration easier. “If I’m a fan of yours, I can’t even look you in the eye,” she admitted. “We just became friends instantly.” Beer joked that now that he has appeared in her video, she plans to watch the series and is “team Steven, of course.”\n\n\tWatch this episode of Variety’s Behind the Song with Madison Beer above. \n",

    "body": "\n\tU.S. indie distributor Breaking Glass Pictures has acquired U.S. distribution rights to Francesco Costabile’s dark melodrama “Familia” that is Italy’s candidate for the best international feature film at the 2026 Academy Awards.\n\n\t“Familia,” which weaves together elements of psychological thriller and social commentary follows the harrowing journey of Luigi, a young man grappling with a toxic family legacy and his entanglement with extremist ideologies. Based on Luigi Celeste’s autobiographical book “It Won’t Be Like This Forever,” the story delves into the destructive cycles of violence and the struggle for redemption. \n\t\n\n\tConstabile’s film launched from the 2024 from the Venice Film Festival, in the Horizons section where protagonist Francesco Gheghi won the best actor award for his powerful performance as Gigi Celeste, a young man shaped by domestic violence and lured into a far-right political movement. “Familia” went on to earn Francesco Di Leva – who plays the mercurial father whose return from prison destabilizes an already fragile family – Italy’s David di Donatello award for best supporting actor. \n\n\n\tThe film’s cast also conprises Barbara Ronchi (“Kidnapped” by Marco Bellochio).\n\n\tCostabile previously garnered critical acclaim for his debut feature “Una Femmina — The Code of Silence” about women who’ve had the courage to break away from the grip of the Calabrian mob’s blood ties and codes.\n\n\t“We are thrilled to bring Familia to U.S. theaters, a multi-award-winning picture with an intense cinematic language that immediately captivated us,” said Breaking Glass Pictures’ CEO Richard Wolff in a statement. The indie distributor is known for handling international and auteur-driven cinema, including LGBTQ+, horror and foreign-language titles, with a keen eye for Italian titles such as Mario Martone’s “Nostalgia.” \n\t\n\n\tTrue Colours’ head of sales Francesca Tiberi, which handled the “Familia” deal, commented: “We are extremely happy to renew our collaboration with BGP on a special feature film such as “Familia” and its Oscar campaign.”\n\n\tThe two companies had previously teamed up in 2022 to support Italy’s Oscar campaign for “Nostalgia” that had launched from the Cannes Film Festival competition.\n\n\tCostabile in the statement pointed out that “Familia” “explores the forms of violence inherent in patriarchal culture against women, a theme that is tragically relevant today and cuts across every culture and every country.”\n\n\t“Familia” is produced by Attilio de Razza and Nicola Picone at Rome-based Tramp Limited. The co-producers are Nicola Giuliano at Rome’s Indigo Film and Pierpaolo Verga at Naples’ O’Groove, and in association with Medusa Film.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDelhi’s everyday chaos is the trigger for black comedy “Tyres Will Be Deflated,” the debut feature from filmmaker Rohan Ranganathan. \n\n\tDeveloped by Shaunak Sen and Aman Mann’s Kiterabbit Films, the award-winning production house behind Academy Award nominated documentary “All That Breathes” and Berlinale 2025 title “Shadowbox.” The project makes its market debut at WAVES Film Bazaar, the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa, where the team is seeking early financing and partnerships.\n\t\n\n\tIn the film the life of a conflict-averse college professor begins to unravel over a seemingly trivial, but increasingly hostile, parking dispute with his powerful neighbor. What starts as a petty territorial conflict mutates into a spiralling cycle of retributions, escalating from passive-aggressive jabs to acts of destruction and ruin. As the feud intensifies, the professor’s attempts at maintaining dignity and order collapse, dragging him toward an absurd, self-inflicted downfall.\n\n\n\tProducers say the film taps into the volatile micro-politics of middle-class Delhi, where cramped urban living, social hierarchy, and everyday stressors can turn the mundane into the combustible. “Rohan has an instinctive grasp of this world,” says producer Aman Mann. “For years he’s told us stories from his neighborhood – each one more ridiculous, more sharply observed than the last. We knew these anecdotes were the seed of a story that could be wickedly funny and painfully honest.”\n\n\tRanganathan has a decade-long association with Kiterabbit, joining as an assistant director on the acclaimed documentary “Cities of Sleep.” He later served as associate director on “All That Breathes,” which won best documentary at both Sundance and Cannes. “From his earliest days on the film, we witnessed his strong creative instincts and deep understanding of Delhi’s milieu. Supporting him as he steps into fiction feels like a natural evolution,” says Mann.\n\t\n\n\tIn the scripting stage, Kiterabbit Films is developing the project in-house, with plans to move into production in the second half of 2026. WAVES Film Bazaar marks the team’s first stop in securing financing.\n\n\tHaving previously produced “Shadowbox,” Mann and Sen say they are exploring multiple financing pathways and hope to build an international partnership model. Kiterabbit Films is currently developing projects that have received grants from IDFA, Catapult, Doc Society and Busan’s Asian Cinema Fund.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Eagles of the Republic,” the Egyptian political thriller that first premiered in Cannes, has been picked up by Cohen Media Group for the U.S. with plans for a theatrical release.\n\n\tFrom filmmaker Tarik Saleh (“Boy From Heaven,” “The Nile Hilton Incident”), the feature was recently submitted by Sweden to be its submission for the 98th Academy Awards.\n\n\tThe third film completing Saleh’s co-called Cairo Trilogy interrogating the machinery of political control, “Eagles of the Republic” is described as his most emotionally layered and character-driven work yet. At its center is George Fahmy, Egypt’s most celebrated movie star, played by Fares Fares. Pressured by the country’s highest authorities to star in a government-backed prestige film, Fahmy reluctantly accepts, only to find himself drawn into the inner sanctum of political power. As he begins a dangerous affair with the general’s mysterious wife, he becomes ensnared in a world where desire, loyalty, and cinematic illusion collide with forces far beyond his control. Lyna Khoudri, Zineb Triki, Amr Waked and Cherien Dabis also star.\n\t\n\n\t“Eagles of the Republic” had its world premiere in competition in Cannes, and has since gone on to screen at major festivals worldwide, including TIFF (Centerpiece selection), Stockholm (Opening Night), Sydney, Melbourne, Busan (Icon section) and AFI Fest. \n\n\n\tIn an exclusive interview with Variety ahead of the film’s Cannes premiere, Saleh described his Cairo Trilogy as being about “men trying to defeat a city that cannot be defeated.”\n\n\tThe acquisition was negotiated by Robert Aaronson, executive vice president of Cohen Media Group, with Nicolas Brigaud-Robert of Playtime. Cohen Media Group will release the film theatrically in the U.S. in early 2026.\n\t\n\n\t“Tarik Saleh has crafted a gripping and emotionally rich political thriller that showcases remarkable performances and a story that will resonate strongly with U.S. audiences,” said Aaronson.\n\n\t“Tarik delivers one of his most accomplished films with ‘Eagles of the Republic’ and we’re delighted to partner with Cohen Media Group, who are the ideal home for its U.S. release,” added Brigaud-Robert.\n\n\tSaleh began his artistic life as one of Europe’s most influential graffiti artists before turning to filmmaking. His feature debut, “Metropia” (2009), premiered as the opening film of Venice Critics’ Week. “The Nile Hilton Incident” won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, earned the Guldbagge Award for Best Film, and sold more than 400,000 tickets in France. Saleh later won the Prix du Scénario (best screenplay) at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival for “Boy From Heaven,” which also received a César nomination and over 500,000 admissions in France.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wicked” is casting a spell over the box office once again.\n\n\tUniversal’s musical sequel “Wicked: For Good” has made $30.8 million in previews at the box office, marking the biggest pre-opening haul of the year. However, the record comes with a caveat. Usually, previews grosses come just from Thursday screenings, but Universal rolled out the film a few days early. Monday fan screenings sponsored by Amazon Prime brought in $6.1 million, while additional Wednesday showings made $6.5 million. Thursday previews, including double screenings of “Wicked” and “For Good,” made $18.2 million.\n\t\n\n\tThe year’s previous record holder was Warner Bros.’ “Superman,” which earned $22.5 million in Thursday previews before making $125 million in its opening weekend.\n\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good,” the highly anticipated conclusion to last year’s pink-and-green sensation, is on track to make between $150 million and $180 million this weekend. It could nab the biggest box office debut of the year. Currently, the record belongs to Warner Bros.’ video game adaptation “A Minecraft Movie,” which made $10.6 million in Thursday previews on the way to a $162 million launch. Universal is playing it safe and predicting a $125 million opening this weekend, but fan excitement is high after Ariana Grande’s Glinda and Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba became pop culture mainstays last fall.\n\n\tLast year, director Jon M. Chu’s original “Wicked” hauled in $19.2 million in previews and grew to a $112.5 million opening weekend in the same pre-Thanksgiving weekend. A year later, the cast, including Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Yeoh, Bowen Yang and more, finish off the story of the “Wizard of Oz” prequel. The first “Wicked” helped power last year’s Thanksgiving box office to a record $420 million alongside “Gladiator II” and “Moana 2.” Disney’s family-friendly “Zootopia 2” opens next week, and the animated sequel and “Wicked: For Good” will try to reach similar box office heights through the holiday.\n\t\n\n\tAlso opening this weekend is Sony’s action sequel “Sisu: Road to Revenge,” which is projected for a $3 million debut and made $575,000 in Thursday previews. There’s also Searchlight’s “Rental Family,” starring Brendan Fraser — also expected to launch in the low single digits.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe “Wicked: For Good” press tour has been a whirlwind (Ariana Grande recently tested positive for COVID, for instance), but no moment made more headlines than when a man jumped over a barricade and ran onto the film’s red carpet in Singapore. He rushed Grande and tried to grab her. Cynthia Erivo went viral for jumping in to protect her co-star and fend off the man as he put his arm around Grande.\n\n\t“I wasn’t really thinking,” Erivo said during a recent interview on “Today,” which marked her first time directly addressing the incident. “I just wanted to make sure my friend was safe. I’m sure he didn’t mean us harm, but you never know with those things. I just wanted to make sure she was okay. That was my first instinct.”\n\t\n\n\tJohnson Wen, a 26-year-old from Australia, was found guilty of being a public nuisance in a Singapore court a few days after the incident occurred. He has since been sentenced to nine days in prison. According to local media, Wen pleaded guilty to the incident. The court heard that Wen attempted to intrude on the red carpet twice — once when he charged at Grande and another time after he was escorted out by security. Wen told the judge that he would “not do it again.”\n\n\tDuring the press stops that followed the “Wicked: For Good” premiere in Singapore, neither Erivo nor Grande directly addressed the incident. Erivo seemed to allude to it during a screening in Los Angeles when she said: “We have come through some shit… I mean, fuck, even this last week, let’s be honest.”\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is now playing in theaters nationwide from Universal Pictures. Watch Erivo’s full interview on “Today” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“What Remains Unsaid,” a project that enjoys the backing of Indian auteur Devashish Makhija (“Joram,” “Bhonsle”), has debuted at the WAVES Film Bazaar, the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI).\n\n\tSet in the rugged villages of rural Haryana, “What Remains Unsaid” is a psychological crime drama that follows Vidya, a celebrated and fiercely principled television journalist dispatched to her ancestral village to cover what appears to be an honour killing. As she investigates, the narrative begins to split open, exposing contradictions, hidden truths, and the blurred lines between victim and perpetrator.\n\t\n\n\t“For me, the film interrogates what it means to seek truth in a post-truth world,” says writer-director Kallol Mukherjee. “It’s about gender, inherited trauma, and the seductive danger of simplified narratives. When the media becomes judge, jury and executioner, the question becomes: who owns the truth, and what happens when it’s crafted for virality rather than justice?”\n\n\n\tMukherjee’s personal connection to journalism anchors the film. In 2017, he was accepted into a top journalism school. Around the same time a journalist he knew was violently attacked for exposing corruption. The incident shook his faith in the profession. That emotional residue, and years of observing how misinformation spreads faster than accountability, eventually shaped the film’s protagonist and world. “At its core, this is the story of a woman who has reached the pinnacle of her profession but the lowest point in her personal life,” he says.\n\t\n\n\tThe film marries psychological realism with elements of magic realism, drawing from Mukherjee’s years in observational documentary filmmaking. He has previously directed short film “The Unowned House” and “Mic Drop” (IFFSA Toronto, Rome International Documentary Festival) and is completing a debut feature documentary titled “Herland”, produced by Forest Flower Films (“Secret of A Mountain Serpent,” Venice Film Festival 2025).\n\n\tProducers Harsh Agarwal and Aditya Grover of Uncombed Buddha Films, known for “Nasir” (Netpac Award, Rotterdam), Locarno title “Rapture,” are on board, alongside filmmaker Makhija. The project has already secured 25% of its budget, and the team is actively pursuing co-production partnerships, equity investment, and grants in India and Europe. \n\n\tThe script is in advanced development with a March 2026 target for shooting. “The thin layer of fog, soft winter light, and muted blues of March will beautifully complement the film’s tone and emotional landscape,” says Mukherjee.\n",

    "description": "\n\tTALLINN, Estonia — “Duality,” the new hybrid feature written, directed and produced by Iranian filmmaker Abbas Nezamdoost world-premiered this week ",
    "body": "\n\tTALLINN, Estonia — “Duality,” the new hybrid feature written, directed and produced by Iranian filmmaker Abbas Nezamdoost world-premiered this week in Tallinn’s main competition, marking a bold entry from Iran’s underground cinema scene.\n\n\tNezamdoost’s sophomore feature charts the intersecting lives of three young Tehranis, blending color cinematography with black-and-white photo storybook sequences voiced by the characters. “Duality” opens on what appears to be an ordinary day for Tara and Nima, a young couple going about their routines, while elsewhere Aban sets out on a journey of her own, swept up in the tremors of first love. As the film unfolds, it shifts back and forward between two different stories and times.\n\t\n\n\tThe team shot the film’s two visual modes separately in early 2024, starting with the moving-image material before capturing thousands of black-and-white photographs for the still sequences. Discreet special effects were later added across both strands, from a shattering mirror in the live-action footage to subtle cigarette smoke woven into individual stills, with the aim of making the photo sections feel as real as the filmed world. As VFX artist and filmmaker Ali Roozkhash explained, the process relies on close back-and-forth with the director: “Abbas wanted the photo parts to feel realistic, so I would make suggestions, and then we would discuss them and he would give me the freedom to apply them. It was a team effort.”\n\n\n\tNezamdoost said the film’s structure mirrors the duality of Iranian post-revolutionary society. “After the revolution, we understood from the very beginning that if you want to lead a normal life, you have to understand the underground way. And that’s how we basically operate our day-to-day lives. Everything in our society is hidden,” he told Variety.\n\t\n\n\tHis cast is drawn directly from that world. “We have Masoumeh [who plays Tara], she is also a songwriter and a musician, and she performs in the underground scene. Eysan [in the role of Nima] is a songwriter – he’s in a band which is very well-known in Iran, but it is underground. And Sonia [Sanjari, who plays Aban] is the director of a theater, but it’s an underground theater.”\n\n\tAsked whether returning to Iran might be dangerous for them, the team was explicit about the uncertainty they face: “We have no idea what’s going to happen… They could just talk to us, they might take our passports and forbid us from leaving the country, this might escalate into something bigger… or nothing might happen,” said Roozkhash, translating from Persian for the team.\n\n\tLead actor Ehsan Goodarzi articulated the moral stakes behind the decision. “We are tired of lying. We hate to portray the fake life that everybody else believes in. We want to show the real ‘us.’ For a long time, when women were portrayed inside the house, they were still wearing the hijab which is completely untrue. For us as male artists, it’s not as dangerous as it is for women when they stop wearing the hijab,” he said.\n\n\t“We want to lead a life that is meaningful,” added co-lead Masoumeh Beigi.\n\n\tFor the team, the danger is outweighed by the need to remain truthful, both to their own lives and to the society they depict. “Art is connected to truth,” said Nezamdoost, “and that’s what we believe in.”\n\n\tThe team’s process reflects that ethos. Much of the film was developed through rehearsal and improvisation. “I would record the actors’ voices and go back home and try to edit that in his head, and then I would come back to rehearsals the next day and we would sit down and talk about the connections between the characters, we created them together,” explained Nezamdoost. He said he avoids over-rehearsing dialogue because “if you practice a lot with the dialogues, it kills the entire emotion of a scene. It completely destroys the freedom of improvisation both for the director and for the actor.”\n\n\t“Duality” is co-produced by Mohammad Attebai’s Tehran-based Iranian Independents, which is handling international distribution.\n\n\tThe film had its world premiere in Tallinn on Nov. 17. The Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival wraps on Nov. 23.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDuality\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tTurkish TV powerhouse <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ay-yapim/\">Ay Yapim</a> is launching its first <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ai/\">AI</a>-generated series, “Castle Walls,” which focuses on the enigmatic story of present-day Iran’s Alamut Castle. The fortress has been made popular as a location in Ubisoft’s popular “Assassin’s Creed Mirage” video game.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Castle Walls” (“Surlar” in Turkish) spans three 15-minute episodes and is written by Turkish television veterans Kerem Deren and Çisil Hazal Tenim (“El Turco”). The short series, which will launch at the upcoming <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mipcom/\">Mipcom</a> TV market in Cannes, is being produced by Ay Yapim under its new Singapore-based subsidiary, AI Yapim.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Castle Walls,” which is among the global industry’s first AI-generated TV series, will premiere later this year both on Turkish free-TV and on a still unspecified “global streamer,” according to a statement.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe groundbreaking series, which was developed over the the course of a year, was produced end-to-end using a mix of AI technologies, including ChatGPT, “for prompt enhancement and creative refinement,” the statement said. Generative artificial intelligence program MidJourney was used “for visual exploration and inspiration,” it added, while AI video generator Runway and the Google Nano Banana image generating and editing tool were employed “for character integration.” Additionally, Veo, Kling, ComfyUI and Topaz were used “for video generation and cinematic execution.” Runway and AI voice generator ElevenLabs where used for voice and dubbing “merging creativity with execution,” the statement noted.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Castle-Walls2.jpg 2160w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Castle-Walls2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Castle-Walls2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Castle-Walls2.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Castle-Walls2.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Castle-Walls2.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Castle-Walls2.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Castle-Walls2.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Castle-Walls2.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Castle-Walls2.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Castle-Walls2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“Castle Walls” concept sketches and moodboard.</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tAlong with these leading AI platforms, AI Yapim deployed its own custom-built AI storyboarding tool and “trained a proprietary video diffusion model, AYDNA 1.0, which was fine-tuned on Ay Yapim’s licensed catalog,” the statement went on to point out.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAy Yapim is best known for the International Emmy-winning “Endless Love,” “Fatmagul,” “Ezel” and “Forbidden Love,” among other global hit series.</p>\n<p>\n\t “AI Yapim was created to fuse human imagination with AI innovation to shape the next era of storytelling,” said Ay Yapim CEO Kerem Çatay in the statement. “By bringing AI technology to a classic story, ‘Castle Walls’ has helped us think bigger and paint on a broader canvas than we’d dreamed, while centering the human spirit that makes great stories resonate.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taiwan/\">Taiwan</a>‘s most successful <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/horror/\">horror</a> franchise is heading to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/indonesia/\">Indonesia</a> for its fourth installment, incorporating the local “Kuntilanak” folklore into its established supernatural mythology.</p>\n<p>\n\tProducer Jeff Tsou’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-rope-curse/\">The Rope Curse</a> 4″ has commenced principal photography in Jakarta, with Shih-Han Liao returning to direct. Vera Chen and Wilson Hsu star in the production, which represents the franchise’s first venture outside of Taiwan. The move signals an ambitious pivot for a series that has become a box office powerhouse in its home territory.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe three previous “Rope Curse” films have collectively grossed over NT$200 million ($6.5 million) at the Taiwanese box office, making it the highest-grossing horror franchise in the country. The series’ most recent entry, “Rope Curse 3,” found additional success on Netflix, reaching the Number 1 or Number 2 spot in the streamer’s film rankings across multiple territories.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe story centers on a man who travels to Pontianak carrying his deceased sister’s remains, hoping to honor her dying wishes while tracking down the father who deserted them. The narrative takes a darker turn when a family member becomes supernaturally afflicted after witnessing a death, prompting a desperate search for spiritual intervention. The quest for answers draws the characters deeper into Indonesian territory, where they encounter the Kuntilanak, a vengeful spirit from regional folklore.</p>\n<p>\n\t“With ‘Rope Curse 4,’ we are seeding the curse into new lands,” Tsou said. “Indonesia holds deep spiritual and supernatural traditions — it’s fertile ground for horror that resonates locally and globally. We believe this film will not only thrill fans of the franchise, but also introduce ‘Rope Curse’ to a whole new audience across Southeast Asia and beyond.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Jakarta-set production aims to weave Indonesian folklore and supernatural traditions into the franchise’s established mythology. The strategic location shift reflects both production considerations and narrative opportunities as the series looks to broaden its regional footprint.</p>\n<div><p>\n\t“The Rope Curse 4” is slated for theatrical release in 2026. WOWing Entertainment Group is producing.</p></div>\n</div>",

Though she was eventually acquitted, the case attracted nationwide attention and Borden remains a pop culture fascination to this day. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAlong with Borden, the cast includes Charlie Hunnam — who leads “Monster” Season 3 as Ed Gein — as Lizzie’s father, Andrew Jackson Borden; Rebecca Hall as Lizzie’s stepmother, Abby; Billie Lourd as Lizzie’s sister, Emma Borden; Jessica Barden as the actress Nance O’Neill, who was Lizzie’s friend; and Vicky Krieps as the Borden family’s maid, Bridget Sullvan.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Monster” premiered in 2022, when Netflix released “Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story” starring Evan Peters as the titular serial killer. The season achieved 115.6 million views in its first 91 days of streaming and remains Netflix’s No. 4 most popular English-language TV title of all time. Peters won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Emmy for the role, while Niecy Nash-Betts, who played Dahmer’s neighbor Glenda, earned a Golden Globe nomination and won an Emmy. Season 2, “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story” starring Nicholas Alexander Chavez and Cooper Koch, premiered in 2024. Koch, Chloë Sevigny and Javier Bardem all received Emmy nominations for their roles. Season 3, “Monster: The Ed Gein Story,” premiered on Friday and hit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/monster-the-ed-gein-story-ratings-netflix-views-1236542392/\">12.2 million views</a> in its first three days of streaming.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tWill AI unleash an entirely new wave of entertainment — starring <em>you</em>? </p>\n<p>\n\tThat’s the premise of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/centerstage-technologies/\">CenterStage Technologies</a>, formed by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/david-boies/\">David Boies</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zack-schiller/\">Zack Schiller</a> as an offshoot of their film financing and production company Boies Schiller Entertainment. CenterStage plans to launch its first product later this fall: an AI-powered, personalized storytelling platform aimed at children, letting them create “kid-safe stories” in adventures featuring popular characters. The company says it has inked intellectual property deals with PBS and <a href=\"https://www.petethecatbooks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">children’s book franchise Pete the Cat</a> — and, according to Schiller, it’s in discussions about IP licensing pacts with a major Hollywood studio and other family-oriented brands.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Our purpose at CenterStage is to allow personalization at scale, and let the consumer star in and direct their own productions,” says Schiller.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tGenerative AI has been a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/tilly-norwood-ai-eline-van-der-velden-1236543362/\">major flashpoint in Hollywood</a>. Actors, writers and other creatives have been concerned the tech will erode their livelihoods, while studios have been actively pursuing copyright infringement litigation against some AI players they allege have ripped off their IP. This week, amid a proliferation of videos created with OpenAI’s Sora 2 that feature recognizable movie and TV characters, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/motion-picture-association-openai-sora-2-copyright-1236541775/\">Motion Picture Association called on the company to take “immediate action” to fix its copyright opt-out system</a>.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CenterStage-Technologies.png 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CenterStage-Technologies.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CenterStage-Technologies.png?resize=300,300 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CenterStage-Technologies.png?w=300\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tCenterStage’s principals recognize the hot-button AI issues in the industry. Boies, a high-profile attorney, says a key part of CenterStage’s approach is that it will empower IP owners to safely and ethically develop personalized narratives using AI. The company says its characters, concepts and stories are “completely protected” with “highly controlled” training environments, recursive safety protocols, and reinforcement learning with human and AI feedback.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCenterStage “is committed to respecting the intellectual property rights of others and to protecting its own intellectual property,” Boies says. And its AI system has guardrails in place to ensure kid-safe content, he says: “We don’t want Pete the Cat to become Felix the Cat.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, according to Schiller, CenterStage is using WGA writers to create its prompts and has tapped Hollywood artists to create its own versions of public-domain characters. “We think we are creating more opportunities, not taking them away,” he says. “We are a human-first AI company.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this new era in entertainment, “technology amplifies human creativity to deliver stories that resonate deeply and responsibly,” Schiller says. Boies and Schiller have been working quietly on developing CenterStage over the last year and a half. “We saw a coming wave of technology that will need to adapt to the economics of the movie space,” Schiller says.</p>\n<p>\n\tCenterStage’s two other co-founders are George Cawood, managing partner of VFX specialist Framework Studio, who is leading platform development; and data scientist Zank Bennett, CEO and founder of Bennett Data Science, who is heading up the AI team. CenterStage is in the middle of raising a round of funding from outside investors; Schiller declined to name investors at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tCurrently, CenterStage has about 30 employees. It is largely based at the Culver City offices of Boies Schiller Entertainment. One reason Schiller and Boies think CenterStage can gain traction with Hollywood partners is because they’ve been in the business of making movies since 2012. Films co-financed and produced by BSE include “The Babysitter,” directed by McG; “Escape Plan,” starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone; “Jane Got a Gun” starring Natalie Portman, Joel Edgerton and Ewan McGregor; and “The Upside,” directed by Neil Burger and starring Kevin Hart, Bryan Cranston and Nicole Kidman.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe genesis of the idea for CenterStage came when Schiller’s son, who is now 8, asked why his dad had never made a movie for him. So Schiller worked with Cawood to make a short film using AI that starred his son as a vet-ninja (veterinarian by day, ninja by night). Schiller realized there was a market for an AI-based platform that could do the same thing at scale. “The first iteration of CenterStage is for children to help them in early reading adoption. It’s educational and entertainment,” he says. Eventually, according to Schiller, “our platform will let people create shows, movies, books and more from whole cloth.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSchiller says CenterStage is working with multiple AI companies’ large language models (LLMs), which it has trained and fine-tuned using its own proprietary visual model. “Everything we train on is protected — it can’t get out into the wild,” he says. “Anything a studio gives us cannot leak out into the larger knowledge base.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWho are CenterStage’s competitors? Boies says it’s “everybody and nobody. Nobody is doing what we are doing. On the other hand, we are competing with everybody who is trying to get the attention and participation of consumers.” CenterStage’s difference, he says, is that in its model users are not purely spectators: “They are able to create their own environment.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAdds Schiller, “It’s a new product that doesn’t exist. We are creating the rules of the road as we go.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Pictured top: David Boies (left), Zack Schiller</em></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rian-johnson/\">Rian Johnson</a> has no desire to kill off his hit crime caper franchise “Knives Out,” despite his lucrative two-picture contract with Netflix having come to an end. </p>\n<p>\n\tOff the back of the success of the first “Knives Out,” the streamer in 2021 paid a reported $450 million for the rights to two sequels, a deal now complete with third installment “Wake Up Dead Man.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Johnson would love to keep going with the murder-solving escapades of his drawling detective Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I don’t feel burnt out doing these at all. If anything I feel energized after doing this one,” he said during a talk at the BFI <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/london-film-festival/\">London Film Festival</a> on Thursday. “So as long as audiences want to keep seeing it, and Daniel and I are still having fun making them and still feel like we can come up with stuff that feels not just fresh, but a fresh challenge for us, I think that’ll translate to a new experience for the audience.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added: “For now, I’d be thrilled to keep making these for the rest of my life.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Wake Up Dead Man.” in which Blanc investigates the mysterious death of Brolin’s firebrand priest alongside O’Connor as his fellow clergyman (and prime suspect), has more darkly gothic tones that the previous two “Knives Out” films. But Johnson suggested the setting perhaps made it the funniest of the three. </p>\n<p>\n\t“In a way it a much more ground and sombre movie,” he said. “But I still think it’s very funny, and maybe even a little more so than the others, because you’re not supposed to fart in church. Because of the seriousness of it, it makes the funny stuff a little more contrast.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday night, “Wake Up Dead Man” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/festivals/daniel-craig-knives-out-3-london-film-festival-premiere-1236542961/\">opened the 2025 edition of the London Film Festival</a>, with Johnson on hand at the Royal Festival Hall to introduce the film alongside an impressive selection of his all-star cast, including Craig, Daryl McCormack, Josh Brolin, Mila Kunis, Cailee Spaeny, Kerry Washington and Andrew Scott.</p>\n</div>",

Some of those programs will move to Sirius’ channel 123.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe new channel will continue to air Kelly’s “The Megyn Kelly Show,” which is heard first on SiriusXM before becoming available in podcast form, and will also feature new programming, including the debut of an exclusive daily after-show program. Additional series, shows, and specials are expected to be announced in coming weeks.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Linear television news is dead. People can’t stand those stilted, censored conversations anymore, which is exactly why this medium is thriving. I’m thrilled to deliver our bold brand of no-B.S. news live on SiriusXM and to be expanding my relationship with such a stellar, blue-chip brand and great partner,” said Kelly, in a prepared statement. “Soon our listeners will have the Megyn Kelly Channel to enjoy and trust for the conversations and content they love.”</p>\n<p>\n\tKelly is one of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tv-news-faces-creator-chaos-anchors-exit-for-digital-dreams-1236477444/\">several opinion personalities who have gained new traction in the audio and direct-to-consumer space </a>in recent years following the death of Rush Limbaugh and and the rise of conservative media outside the umbrella of Fox News Channel. Many of those figures are former Fox News regulars who have gone on to seek their own crowds. Bill O’Reilly has a subscription-based video feed. Glenn Beck is co-founder of the conservative content outlet Blaze Media. And Tucker Carlson has gained attention with his own programming distributed via social and digital media<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/tucker-carlson-twitter-linda-yaccarino-fox-news-1235615541/\">,</a> Their audiences can be smaller and more disparate than the ones that come to mainstream news outlets, but in an era of cord-cutting, their niche power is not to be dismissed.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe situation seems to suit Kelly. “I could never go back to having a boss. I don’t do well with bosses,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/megyn-kelly-donald-trump-siriusxm-done-with-tv-1235715717/\">Kelly told <em>Variety</em> in 2023</a>, making a not-so-overt reference <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/megyn-kelly-nbc-bad-fit-analysis-1203008284/\">to tangles she had with senior executives at Fox News Channel and NBC News</a> over the course of her career. “I’m much better off at being my own boss and running my own show.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring her tenure as an audio host, Kelly has interviewed President Donald Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shortly before his confirmation hearings. She has also held conversations with Carlson, Piers Morgan, Bill Maher, Bari Weiss, Charlamagne tha God, and Shawn Ryan, among others.</p>\n<p>\n\tKelly has in recent weeks launched podcasts backed by other personalities. Among the offerings from her MK Media podcast network are “The Nerve with Maureen Callahan,” “Next Up with Mark Halperin,” “Spot On with Link Lauren,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/megyn-kelly-expands-digital-emily-jashinsky-after-party-1236435150/\">and “After Party with Emily Jashinsky.”</a> She recently unveiled an “MK True Crime” initiative, which features legal analysis and live trial coverage with an array of expert contributors. </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tBrazil’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/globo/\">Globo</a>, the biggest production force in Latin America, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bbc/\">BBC</a> Studios have landed a milestone co-production agreement for an upcoming documentary series that will “transport audiences to the heart” of Brazil’s sprawling Amazon rainforest. The co-production deal strengthens Brazil’s current global momentum. This year, Walter Salles’ Globo-backed “I’m Still Here” made history as the country’s first Oscar-winning film, and Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent” took two awards at the Cannes Film Festival, where Brazil was also the country of honor at Marché du Film.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe series, whose details are still being kept under wraps, will be produced by BBC Studios Specialist Factual Productions, with production to move forward at a time to be announced. BBC Studios brought the parties together for this historic deal and will now sell the series globally.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking with <em>Variety</em>, Janet Brown, president of Global Content Sales at BBC Studios, highlighted the collaborative nature of the historic deal, which spans from a desire to work together to create the kind of content that feels like “one plus one equals three.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“This isn’t a co-production where we, the BBC, had a story and then went out to find people to help fund it,” she emphasized. “This is very much a joint project all the way from the beginning. In this case, it’s a story that innately comes from Brazil. We are bringing the BBC Studios’ excellent specialist factual production team to help create and bring this story to life. As a sales team, we are so excited to be doing what we always do in terms of taking a piece of content that is true of its country of origin and making it accessible and appealing to global audiences.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBrown said the deal is “very much about our relationship with Globo,” a longtime partner in the natural history and science space. “Here we are broadening it and deepening it through a co-pro. That’s what you want with great relationships of any kind, right? You want to expand them and grow them, and this is very much what we’re doing here.”</p>\n<p>\n\tGabriel Jacome, director of content at TV Globo, echoed Brown in stating that working with the BBC is “truly inspiring.” “Their legacy of creative excellence and editorial integrity has shaped generations of audiences and professionals around the world. But what excites us most is the potential for genuine exchange.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s a partnership that amplifies distribution reach, fosters co-production opportunities, and deepens our participation in global conversations about responsible communication, sustainability, and inclusion,” he added. “Perhaps most importantly, it highlights the power of Brazilian creativity as capable of resonating far beyond our borders and reminding the world that compelling stories can both reflect and reshape societies.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to working out the logistics and bureaucracy of the first-of-its-kind deal, Brown says “it took some time.” “If you look at the kind of co-pro relationship we have with a partner like ZDF, for example, those are well-worn relationships. The first one is always going to take a minute. It’s one of the reasons we’re so excited, because we want to be building from here. We’re bringing it together to make sure it’s going to work both as a production for global but also as content on their channel.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOn that note, the BBC exec adds that this initial project will be done on a “smaller scale” than some of the broadcaster’s landmark projects, “so we are not running before we walk.” “It’ll be a much shorter program in terms of length, and the scope and the scale of the story are very specific. We don’t need six episodes to tell this story. We are excited about telling it with a shorter runtime that brings with it logistics and a budget that makes for more of a recipe for success for [our first project] and then build it from there.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen asked about a historic tendency of having international companies from the U.S. and Europe tell stories about Brazil’s Amazon, Brown emphasized the issue has been part of the discussion from the very beginning, as well as how the BBC is working “to not fall into that and make sure that the whole production is staffed appropriately and that we are absolutely using the community. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be interesting to us.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The whole point is to be working together with that authentic gaze from the Brazilian point of view,” she added. “We are absolutely embedding that in our thinking of the full logistics right from the beginning.”</p>\n<p>\n\tJacome added that it is “essential” that stories about Brazil, and especially about the Amazon, “are told with authenticity, from the perspective of those who truly live and understand the region. For too long, international productions have looked at these narratives from above, capturing beautiful images but often missing the human heartbeat that sustains that ecosystem.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“As Brazil’s leading storyteller, Globo has both the responsibility and the privilege to bring that local voice into the global conversation,” he concurred. “We know the people, the rhythms, the contradictions, and the hope that define the Amazon. When I first traveled to the Amazon, I finally grasped the strength, dignity, and knowledge of the communities that live there. That experience changed my perception completely. That is why I invited our colleagues at the BBC to go beyond the aerial view of the forest canopy and step into the forest itself, to meet those who truly live, produce, and protect that land.”</p>\n</div>",

As part of explaining why she is the woman she is today, Victoria opens up in a way not seen before on camera, discussing her own personal health struggles, being hounded by the media as a young mother and the ridicule she faced from as she battled to reinvent herself from a fashion world that would eventually embrace her.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLike “Beckham,” Victoria’s docuseries is produced by David Beckham’s own Studio 99 and also has an American behind the lens, this time <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nadia-hallgren/\">Nadia Hallgren</a>, best known for her Emmy-nominated feature doc “Becoming” about Michelle Obama. For producer BIllie Shepherd, the style of the show — capturing Victoria’s story while she continued to lead a fast-paced, high-pressured life and further her career — was what led them to Hallgren. “Nadia’s vérité shooting is incredible — it’s really second nature to her,” she says. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Making these shows, you have to really build trust to help find the most authentic version of the subject — it’s like, how can we make them feel themselves? — and Nadia really had that mindset,” adds Julia Nottingham of Dorothy St. Pictures, which produces in association with Studio 99. “When Nadia and Victoria immediately connected on their first meeting, we all breathed a sigh of relief — it felt like our matchmaking was correct.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a New Yorker, Hallgren admits she “didn’t know anything” about the Beckhams until she saw David’s series, but was immediately intrigued. But she says getting someone famed for having meticulous control over her own personal brand to open up wasn’t easy. “The whole process with Victoria was letting go and her being extremely uncomfortable with that,” he said. “It was like, how do I help push her out of her comfort zone?”</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking to <em>Variety</em>, Hallgren discusses dealing with comparisons to the “Beckham” doc, why Victoria is one of the “funniest people” she’s ever met, the decision to not include the rumored feud with Brooklyn Beckham and the surprising similarities between the former WAG and former First Lady.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYou’ve obviously spent enough time in the U.K. making this to appreciate that a show about Victoria Beckham is likely to generate a bit of noise. Are you ready for that?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tYeah, I love that part of it. It’s fun. Getting the chance to spend time with her and David has been a great experience, so now the other part of the great experience is letting other people see it and starting that conversation.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow was it spending so much time in the world of the Beckhams?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tHonestly, they’re really nice people — very warm and really kind. It was fun getting to know them. I think most of us have gotten to know David, whether personally or otherwise, especially through his Netflix series. I’m American, born and raised in New York City, so the Beckhams have a different place in my pop cultural zeitgeist. I hadn’t thought about the Beckhams, maybe ever, until I saw David’s series. It was great and such a well-made show. But definitely Victoria was the standout in terms of entertainment, vulnerability, depth and really bringing that story to another level. She caught my attention when I first saw the series, so a year or two later when I got a call asking if I’d be interested in working with her on her series, I was like, “Oh, wow.” She just sparked my curiosity in a way that was undeniable.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDid Victoria have to approve you as director?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI spoke to a couple of people, but then I was told that Victoria wanted to meet me in person, and I wanted to meet her in person too. Because I think just like any great partnership, you don’t really fully know the chemistry until you’re in the room. She happened to be coming to New York City so we met for an hour, and that was pretty much the deciding factor. I think we both felt like it was something that could be a good match.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tI understand she had to be persuaded quite heavily to do this — it wasn’t her idea.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tYeah, and she expressed that to me. Victoria’s been so private for so long that she’s not a natural over-sharer, someone that just puts it all out there. Even with the experience of making “Beckham,” it was challenging for her to be emotional on camera, to be so raw and have so many people see that side of her. Some people are just like, “Make a film about me!” But she was very much like, “I’m considering this if it’s the right person, the right circumstances.”</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDid you have any preconceived opinions of her going into this?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tAbsolutely not. And I think that was kind of a great thing. I didn’t grow up in Spice Girl madness on the U.S. side. I’m probably maybe a little bit older. But I didn’t know anything about her. Soccer isn’t really a sport that I ever really connected with, so it’s not like I even really knew much about David.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E1_00_11_49_07.png 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E1_00_11_49_07.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E1_00_11_49_07.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E1_00_11_49_07.png?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E1_00_11_49_07.png?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E1_00_11_49_07.png?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E1_00_11_49_07.png?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E1_00_11_49_07.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<br />When you were talking to Victoria in those early stages, what did she say to you about what she wanted to get out of the doc and how it should look and feel?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThose were some of the very first questions I asked her. I was just trying to understand where she was in this moment, 50 years old, and living a life that is very different in many ways than how we knew her as a Spice Girl, and being an adult and having this perspective on her past and how she got to where she is now. But also the moment right now for her is everything that she’s built up to and has dreamed of doing. For me, as a documentary filmmaker, and I think even in my personal life, I have a deep interest in self-discovery and that human experience. And how at these different times in our lives, these particular moments make us think deeper about who we are, who we were and where we want to go. So a big part of our conversation was around that. She was excited about getting to know herself better through this process.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tVictoria is obviously someone who has been fiercely protective of her and her family’s image. In the U.K., the Beckhams effectively created the notion of “controlling the narrative.” How was it as a documentarian, with a strong idea of what you wanted to make, working with someone known for being very controlling about what we see and read about her?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think this is what was different about the series. I think she was willing to let go. I needed to know that the person that’s engaging in this process to make a documentary, to tell their story, is also willing to let go and surrender in a way — which is a really hard thing to do, and it’s a hard thing to ask someone to do. But there has to at least be a willingness going in. The whole process with Victoria was letting go and her being extremely uncomfortable with that, but still doing it right. I think it’s good that she felt uncomfortable. You want people to be uncomfortable when they’re making a documentary — it was like, how do I help push her out of her comfort zone? But you have to want to be pushed out your comfort zone. So it’s this thing that you do together. It’s like, we push a little more and we push a little more and we push a little more, and then we get the results that we got, which was a Victoria Beckham that was very willing to talk about things that she hadn’t talked about before and express things, be emotional, be vulnerable.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tShe says in the series that the minute she sees a camera, she changes and the armor comes up. How easy was it to pierce that?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWe did it, but it definitely was not easy. But that’s the process. When I started filming with Michelle Obama on “Becoming,” it was her very first time in public after Trump was elected — she was no longer a First Lady. Imagine what that experience was like for her. So I definitely enter people’s lives often in a place where they’re not comfortable that there’s a camera around them all day and they’re having a life-changing experience. I wouldn’t let someone do that to me. So I have a deep compassion and sympathy for people who are letting me in.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThis Victoria series obviously comes off the back of David’s series, which was a huge success for Netflix and won an Emmy. Was there any pressure from her for this to be as successful?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think Victoria and I share this willingness to take risks and know that we may be measured against something. But that’s OK, because we believe that it could be as good. It’s completely different, too. I think that’s the thing. The style of this series is very different from the David series. We are in the moment with Victoria. We are in the now. And a really important part of her story is happening right now and was happening when we were filming. Obviously there’s always going to be people maybe making a comparison, or thinking about his doc and how that was made. But ultimately the ingredients are very different. This is a vérité film in many ways.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAnd it’s very knowing about what it is. One of the first things she says is in response to David making a terrible joke and saying, “He thinks this is going to be his moment in the documentary, but this about me.” So it did seem like: you’ve done your show, now it’s my turn.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWhich is so much fun with Victoria, because she is so self aware. But in a way that is really charming. She’s so sharp, and her timing is great, and her humor and knowing how to land things — like that opening. It’s really fun. As soon as I started filming with her, I was like, “Oh, this is going to be different.”<br />Without giving any spoilers away, one of the key takeaways from the series is just how funny she is.<br />She’s incredibly funny. The first day I met her, that was one thing that really drew me to her. I remember leaving that meeting and saying, well, I hope she picks me, because I just had such a raw experience with her. It was funny, it was vulnerable, it was deep, it was superficial. You know, it was almost like sitting with a friend that you know really well. Yeah, she is one of the funniest people I’ve ever met.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDavid’s show created a few memes which are still very much in circulation — especially the one with Victoria, which she then printed on a t-shirt and sold. Was there any pressure — externally or even just from yourself — to create some similar moments that might go viral?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI’m not gonna say there was not some outside pressure. But Victoria delivers, so we’ll see what audiences pick up on.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhen you do dive into the archive material, some of what was said and written about Victoria that you highlight was absolutely appalling. Were you shocked at the state of British tabloid culture and what people could openly say about other people?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think now we’re really familiar with British tabloid culture through other documentaries or books about it. But this was the first time I experienced it on what felt like a personal level through Victoria. When we started filming this, my daughter was a year-and-a-half. She’s my first child, so knowing what it’s like so early, when your life is changing and all the things that are happening and to know that when Victoria was 25 and had Brooklyn she had those horrible comments being made about her. She faced such scrutinization and was being judged in such an unkind way — people were being mean for no reason. I think I was more emotional than Victoria was looking back at that stuff — I think she’s really built up her own mechanisms to not let it keep affecting her. But it affected her at the time very deeply. I had a lot of compassion for the 25-year-old Victoria, but then also really started to understand how the Victoria today came to be. Because when you go through those experiences, you have to find ways to cope.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tOne of the comments made about her on TV — which is a clip you show — is incredibly nasty. Was she OK with you using that? It still must hurt.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt probably wasn’t easy. I think anyone looking back at that time in their lives, when something is so painful it reopens those wounds. But she was OK with it. She was like, if I’m going to tell the story, I need to tell the whole story. So she never suggested we not use anything.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E2_00_14_37_06.png 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E2_00_14_37_06.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E2_00_14_37_06.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E2_00_14_37_06.png?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E2_00_14_37_06.png?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E2_00_14_37_06.png?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E2_00_14_37_06.png?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Victoria_Beckham_n_S1_E2_00_14_37_06.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<br />Because this is the Beckhams, a fair amount of the conversation is probably going to be about what’s not in the documentary. For example, David’s alleged infidelities and the impact that had on Victoria isn’t brought up. Why was the decision made not to tackle that subject?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWhen I met Victoria, the things that stood out to me was who this woman is now in this moment in her life, and how she’s evolved as a person and that self-discovery. And there were so many topics that were covered in David’s series. Part of it was like, well, we don’t want to tell those stories. We want to do something that’s fresh and interesting. So it was intentional on my part to not repeat some stories that were either told in the Beckham series or that I didn’t think were important to Victoria’s story right now.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYou also didn’t include the so-called family feud between Victoria and Brooklyn Beckham in the series. This is a story that must have erupted while you were making the doc. As a documentary maker, when something like that happens in the middle of making a documentary, did you not push for it to be included in some way?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWe did film Brooklyn at the Paris fashion show. But something that we always did was film what was happening with Victoria. We didn’t contrive moments and things like that. So when the kids were around, they were around, and if they weren’t around, they weren’t around. It’s also important for me as a person and as a filmmaker to just be respectful to people that I make films with.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tBut was there a conversation about whether or not to include it, given its timeliness?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI never talked to Victoria about including anything beyond what we filmed with her family in the show.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tIs there any fear that, by not including it, it might look like it’s been carefully stage-managed on her part?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think audiences or the press may want to speculate or talk about that. But as the director I have to make really specific decisions on the show that I want to make. And that’s what I did in this series.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWere there any restrictions at all or any areas that were no-go zones?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThere weren’t any restrictions. We talk about some of the most difficult parts of Victoria’s life, truly. I don’t want to give any spoilers away, but I think we did a pretty good job of identifying those moments as well as her sharing with me what some of those moments were. We have a really great range of highs and lows. Victoria has gone through a lot in her life. She was willing to pretty much go anywhere that I thought was important. I can’t say it was always easy pushing someone out of their comfort zone, and especially someone as private as Victoria. The point is that it’s a process, and we get there eventually.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDid Victoria have any final say on the edit?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tShe did not have final say on the edit. Her and I had definitely talked about my idea during the process. We developed that relationship. But she didn’t have final cut.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThe series builds up to Victoria’s fashion show in Paris, which is a great success. I think the cynic out there might suggest it seems a little contrived to end this way. But you shot that right at the start and there was a chance it might not have been the success it was. Was that a fear or something that was discussed?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWhenever you make a verité film where you don’t know what will happen, you take an incredible leap of faith. Because it’s always like: how’s this gonna end? We just didn’t know the ending. When I started filming, it was all new to me — I didn’t know Victoria and the family yet. We got so lucky that they were so kind and allowed us to film and be themselves in these really difficult moments when they’re trying to put on a show. And then as the days and the weeks went by, I just noticed myself being like, “Oh man, I really hope this works out.” I just started rooting for them. I was personally invested. And I just remember, by the time we were backstage, the models were lining up, the rain had maybe stopped, and we didn’t know what was going to happen, I was like, “Please let this go well.” And I knew in that moment that we had a show. If you’re feeling emotional and you’re getting goosebumps, you know. And then, when it went the way it went, I thought, “We have an ending.”</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tOn the face of it, I think few people would compare Victoria Beckham to Michelle Obama. But they are obviously both successful women who’ve spent years in the public eye and are fiercely scrutinized by the press and public. Did you go into this thinking there were similarities or did you find similarities between them as you went on?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tTheir life experiences are incredibly different. But they are fiercely driven women, highly successful and capable in their own right, who marry men who are incredibly charismatic and loved by the world, who get taken on a different trajectory because of that marriage, but who are working to understand themselves and their position in the world through this journey that they don’t entirely have control over. What I learned on “Becoming” with Michelle Obama changed the way I would forever understand that particular series of events in a woman’s life.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat do you think people, especially those who have known the Beckhams for so long, will come away from this doc thinking about Victoria?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think it’s human nature to want to be understood. So I hope that people can understand Victoria a bit more, just who she truly is. She’s Victoria Beckham, but she’s also a warm person. She’s a kind person. She’s someone who’s shown a tremendous amount of resilience, she’s so smart, she’s a great business woman and she’s a fighter, for sure.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tIt ends with her and David at their home in the Cotswolds, with David talking about his bees. I’m pretty sure that’s how the “Beckham” series ends. Was that a little hat tip to that show?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think that the two shows are in conversation with each other. We love the “Beckham” series, and I’m a huge fan of Fisher Stevens and what he did. And you know that I learned so much about Victoria through that series. So that’s my homage.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDid you manage to get any Victoria Beckham merch?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tActually, I have a cool story. The time we filmed in her store, we were just walking and there was this beautiful suit on the rack. And I was like, “Oh my God, that’s beautiful.” It was just a second and we kept going. Fast forward a couple of months and I actually had to spend my birthday in London filming. It just happened that way. Victoria recognized it and was like, “I know how hard it is to be away from your family on your birthday so I’m super appreciative that you came here to do this.” And she said she wanted to give me something and hands me a box. And it was the suit. She gifted me this beautiful tuxedo for my birthday — and also because she knew that I was going to the Oscars two weeks later. I remember when I opened the box, she was so emotional seeing my reaction and how special it was to me. Victoria’s love language is dressing people.</p>\n</div>",

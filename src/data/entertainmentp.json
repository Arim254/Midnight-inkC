    "body": "\n\tIt’s not quite John Travolta’s “Adele Dazeem,” but Cher caused a bit of confusion at the Grammys when she announced “Luther Vandross” as the winner of record of the year, which went to Kendrick Lamar and SZA’s “Luther,” itself a tribute to the R&B singer who died in 2005.\n\n\tCher took a long pause before opening the envelope that contained the category’s winner, then laughed: “Oh! They told me it was going to be on the prompter.” When she revealed the victor, she saw the song title “Luther” and announced, “The Grammy goes to Luther Vandross.” She then realized the error and corrected herself, saying, “The Grammy goes to Kendrick Lamar.”\n\t\n\n\tLamar was seen laughing as SZA hugged people on her way up to the stage. Accepting the award, the performers and producers made light of the gaffe by acknowledging the connection between their song and the famed singer it’s named after. “Luther,” the third single off of Lamar’s “GNX” album, samples Vandross and Cheryl Lynn’s cover of “If This World Were Mine,” written by Marvin Gaye.\n\n\n\t“First and foremost, let’s give a shout-out to the late, great Luther Vandross,” said Sounwave, one of the producers behind “Luther.”\n\n\t“To echo what he said, this is what music is about: Luther Vandross,” Lamar added. “This is special for me. I’ve got to take my time, because he’s one of my favorite artists of all time. They granted us the privilege to do our version of [‘If This World Were Mine’]. When we got that clearance, I promise you, we damn near all dropped a tear, because we know how much him and Cheryl Lynn poured into that record. Being able to put our vocals of it proves that we are somewhat worthy of being just as great as them individuals. They granted us that.”\n\t\n\n\tLamar added that Lynn and the Vandross estate had one contingency on clearing the sample: “They said ‘no cursing’ though. ‘You can’t curse on it.’ That was the only thing, right? And we said, you know what? We are going to do just that. No cursing, and we are going to make sure the song represents love.”\n\n\tHe capped off his speech with two words: “Luther forever.”\n\n\tSegueing into the next performance, Grammys host Trevor Noah acknowledged Cher’s funny moment, saying, “I love live television.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTo avoid conflicting with Super Bowl Sunday, HBO has moved up next week’s episodes of “Industry” and “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” to Friday releases on HBO Max.\n\n\tThe episodes — “Industry” Season 4, Episode 5 and “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” Season 1, Episode 4 — will still air on HBO on Sunday, Feb. 8, in their usual 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. timeslots. But they also will be available to stream at 12:01 a.m. PT on Friday, Feb. 6.\n\t\n\n\tFinancial power broker drama “Industry” is in the middle of its eight-episode fourth season on HBO. The sexy, globetrotting series stars Myha’la, Marisa Abela, Kit Harington, Ken Leung, Max Minghella, Miriam Petche, Sagar Radia, Toheeb Jimoh, Charlie Heaton, Amy James-Kelly, Roger Barclay, Andrew Havill, Kiernan Shipka, Kal Penn, Jack Farthing, Stephen Campbell Moore, Claire Forlani and Edward Holcroft. \n\n\n\t“A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” is the third series in George R.R. Martin’s “Game of Thrones” universe to air on HBO, following the Targaryen-centric spinoff “House of the Dragon.” The six-episode first season follows a naive yet courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall, and his diminutive squire, Egg, as they traverse through the fantastical and dragon-filled world of Westeros. The series stars Peter Claffey, Dexter Sol Ansell, Finn Bennett, Bertie Carvel, Tanzyn Crawford, Daniel Ings and Sam Spruell.\n\n\tThe 60th Super Bowl will air on NBC and Peacock on Sunday, as the New England Patriots face off against the Seattle Seahawks.

    "body": "\n\tA Grammy In Memoriam segment for both D’Angelo and Roberta Flack, curated by Lauryn Hill and some of her musician friends, brought the house down with soulful performances.\n\n\tDuring the D’Angelo segment, Hill began by singing alongside D’Angelo’s vocals over their song “Nothing Even Matters,” followed by Lucky Daye’s rendition of “Brown Sugar.” Raphael Saadiq and Anthony Hamilton were next up with “Lady,” with Leon Thomas following with “Devil’s Pie.” The last stretch featured Transition with Vanguard BGVS performing “Another Life,” Bilal singing “Untitled (How Does It Feel)” and Jon Batiste closing with “Africa.”\n\t\n\n\tFor the Flack tribute, Hill and Batiste performed “First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,” with Leon Bridges joining Batiste to follow with “Compared to What.” Lalah Hathaway and October London followed with “Closer I Get to You,” with John Legend and Chaka Khan up next with “Where Is the Love.” Hill covered the Flack song “Feel Like Makin’ Love,” which D’Angelo also covered, as the penultimate song, with Hill reuniting with her Fugees bandmate Wyclef Jean for Flack’s “Killing Me Softly with His Song,” which transitioned into the Fugees version for the rousing end.\n\n\n\tD’Angelo was a widely influential R&B singer-songwriter who helped pioneer the genre of music known as “neo-soul” and is known for such hits as “Lady,” “Brown Sugar” and “Untitled (How Does It Feel?).” He was a reclusive figure who released just three albums in a career spanning more than 30 years, but his influence on ensuing generations of musicians has been vast. His death from cancer last year at the age of just 51 came as a surprise even to many who had been close to him.\n\t\n\n\tFlack was a legendary pop/R&B vocalist who was launched to stardom in the early ’70s by the Grammy-winning hits “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face” and “Killing Me Softly With His Song,” the latter of which enjoyed a second life thanks to the hit cover version by Hill and the Fugees in 1996. The classically trained vocalist also enjoyed a string of hits with singer Donnie Hathaway in the early ‘70s, most notably “Where Is the Love?,” and had a decades-long career after her charting years were over. She died last February at the age of 88.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPost Malone led an all-star tribute to Ozzy Osbourne during the 2026 Grammy Awards, taking the stage alongside Watt, Slash, Duff McKagan and Chad Smith during the In Memoriam montage.\n\n\tMalone performed a rendition of “War Pigs” with Guns N’ Roses guitarist Slash and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith. Osbourne’s widow, Sharon Osbourne, and their children Kelly and Jack watched from the audience in tears as Malone sang the iconic anti-war protest song by Black Sabbath. The track is the opening song from the band’s second studio album, “Paranoid,” released in 1970.\n\t\n\n\n\tAll of the musicians who appeared during the tribute had previously collaborated with Osbourne. Post Malone recorded duets with the Black Sabbath frontman on the songs “Take What You Want” and “It’s a Raid,” while Watt served as executive producer on Osbourne’s final two albums, 2020’s “Ordinary Man” and 2022’s “Patient Number 9.” Slash featured Osbourne on the 2010 track “Crucify the Dead,” and McKagan and Smith contributed to his last records.\n\n\n\tOsbourne died in July 2025 at age 76 after a yearslong struggle with Parkinson’s disease. He had performed just weeks earlier at what was billed as Black Sabbath’s final concert, a festival titled “Back to the Beginning” in the band’s hometown of Birmingham, England. The event featured a five-song solo set and four-song Sabbath set, as well as tributes from Slayer, Tool, Billy Corgan, Tom Morello, Sammy Hagar and others.\n\n\tThe Grammys tribute to Osbourne follows a separate all-star tribute that took place at the MTV Video Music Awards in September. During that performance, Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler joined forces with British singer Yungblud for a three-song set that included covers of “Crazy Train,” the 1972 ballad “Changes” and the closer “Mama I’m Coming Home.”\n\t\n\n\tSince his death, Osbourne’s life was commemorated with the October release of the documentary “No Escape From Now” on Paramount Plus, chronicling his health issues over the past six years. In the film, Osbourne is shown struggling with chronic pain after a 2019 fall and numerous surgeries, as well as his battle with Parkinson’s disease.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLola Young isn’t pretending her return to the stage was easy.\n\n\tJust after winning her first Grammy Award for best pop solo performance for “Messy,” the British singer spoke about stepping back into the spotlight at Spotify’s Best New Artist party on Thursday night. The performance marked her first live show in four months, following a health scare that sidelined her last fall.\n\n\n\t“I was actually nervous as hell. I can’t lie,” Young told Variety backstage at the Grammys. “I don’t like sugarcoating things. I feel like I’m pretty nervous, and I was nervous tonight. We as artists, we have nerves. But this is what I want to do. This is the place I feel like I belong. On the stage is where I feel like I belong.”\n\t\n\n\tYoung had been largely out of the public eye since collapsing during a performance at New York’s All Things Go festival in September. At the time, she announced she would be stepping away from performing for the “foreseeable future,” later postponing a planned tour in support of her album “I’m Only F—ing Myself.”\n\n\tHer return at Spotify’s showcase — where she performed “Penny Out of Nothing,” “Post Sex Clarity” and “Dealer” — was an emotional moment for the artist and her fans, who have been watching her recovery closely.\n\n\t“This industry is a very difficult industry to be in,” Young said when asked about the outpouring of concern and support from her fan base. “I took the time out to get better because there were a lot of things going on in my head, in my personal life, and we constantly have to be protected as artists. I had to make the decision to do it for myself — to be kind to myself and give myself space.”\n\t\n\n\tNow, she says, she’s in a better place.\n\n\t“But now I am back. I feel better,” Young added. “I will do as much as I can to be good for my fans and to be good for the people that love me.”\n\n\tThat sense of vulnerability has become a defining feature of Young’s breakout success — particularly with “Messy,” the Grammy-winning single that struck a chord with listeners by embracing imperfection and emotional honesty.\n\n\t“I feel like ‘Messy’ is a song that symbolizes how we all feel,” Young said. “It speaks on being a messy human being and not being enough for the world — and that’s how a lot of us feel a lot of the time. That’s how I felt all the time.”\n\n\tAt the Grammys on Sunday night, Young performed a stripped-down, piano-backed rendition of “Messy” during the Grammy Awards’ best new artist medley, along with the seven other nominees, which included winner Olivia Dean, and nominees Katseye, Addison Rae, Alex Warren, Leon Thomas, Sombr and the Marías.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBad Bunny has made Grammys history as the first Spanish-language artist to win album of the year with his hit album “Debí Tirar Más Fotos.”\n\n\tHe beat Justin Bieber (“Swag”), Sabrina Carpenter (“Man’s Best Friend”), Clipse, Pusha T and Malice (“Let God Sort Em Out”), Kendrick Lamar (“GNX”), Leon Thomas (“Mutt”) and Tyler, the Creator (“Chromakopia”) in the category.\n\n\tBad Bunny was wiping away tears as he approached the stage to accept his award. After composing himself, he spoke in Spanish to thank God, the Recording Academy, his mother and everyone who worked on the album. \n\t\n\n\t“I want to dedicate this award to all the people that had to leave their homeland, their country, to follow their dreams,” he said in English.\n\n\n\tWhen the 2026 nominations were first announced late last year, Bad Bunny became the first Spanish-language artist to earn nods for best album, record and song in one year. He also won best música urbana album and best global music performance for “EoO” Sunday night, plus he was nominated for the new category of best album cover.\n\n\tThis is the latest milestone in Bad Bunny’s already impressive career. Three years ago, his album “Un Verano Sin Ti” became the first Spanish-language release to earn a Grammy nomination for album of the year, though he lost to Harry Styles’ “Harry’s House.” \n\n\tBad Bunny previously won three Grammys, two for best música úrban album (“Un Verano Sin Ti” in 2023 and “El Último Tour Del Mundo” in 2022) and one for best latin pop or urban album (“YHLQMDLG” in 2021). He’s received 16 nominations in his career so far.\n\t\n\n\tNext week, he’ll perform at the Super Bowl halftime show in his highly anticipated debut as headliner. He had previously appeared as a guest during Jennifer Lopez and Shakira’s 2020 performance. However, President Donald Trump and many of his conservative supporters criticized the NFL’s selection of Bad Bunny. Trump has said that he will not be in attendance of the game and threatened that ICE officials will be there. Last month, Bad Bunny released a teaser for his performance featuring dancers of various ethnicities, ages and styles and vowing that “the world will dance.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLast week’s movie conversation was all about a certain very high-priced vanity documentary with a ginormous promotional budget. But that attention-magnet did not win the weekend box office, nor did “Shelter,” the crown going to a second heavily-advertised mainstream thriller, “Send Help.” However, it just narrowly beat out a new release that was on almost no one’s radar — except, it turns out, a huge online fanbase. \n\n\t“Iron Lung” is a first theatrical feature endeavor for Mark Fischbach aka Markiplier, a YouTube personality who’s grown a massive following largely on the basis of videos in which he comments on games as he plays them. It’s not the most sophisticated act, but you can see how his amiable, antic personality (plus a dulcet speaking voice) might accrue loyal viewers. They turned out in bulk for a self-financed movie with a marketing outlay of precisely zilch. It was initially expected to open on just a small number of screens, before advance demand increased that number to over 3000 before opening. Now Fischbach is the writer-director-star of the No. 2 movie in the U.S. — at a production cost that’s a minuscule, low-seven-digits fraction of his nearest competitors.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s a success story that should cheer those who fear our era of corporate mergers and dwindling resources could spell an end to independent filmmaking. That’s a narrative arguably more inspiring than what’s actually onscreen, as “Lung” is an enterprising but overlong, murky sci-fi suspense effort. Duly based on David Szymanski’s 2022 video game, it faithfully replicates its conceptual limitations — confining protagonist and viewer within a midget submarine — to effectively grim, oppressive effect. But there’s not a lot of plot here, certainly not enough to sustain a full two hours. And those previously unacquainted with the game are likely to make little sense of the few things that do happen. \n\t\n\n\tFischbach plays Simon, our hapless hero, who’s been incarcerated on a moon colony for an indistinct past act of destruction (which he claims was an accident), and is now given a chance at salvation via a one-man mission in the titular submersible. Just what he’s meant to find or do at an “ocean of blood’s” bottom is unclear. Nor is it certain that the brusque superiors who’ll only address him as “Convict” will actually honor their promise of freedom after he completes that vague task. The rusty bucket he’s in doesn’t seem very sturdy, and its technology wouldn’t impress aquatic explorers of the 1960s: He’s able to glimpse what’s outside only in brief, low-res still images, while reliant on paper maps of the underwater terrain. \n\n\tIn this largely off-screen future, apparently humanity has created space settlements, which are thrown on life support when a mysterious event called “The Quiet Rapture” seemingly obliterates all stars and habitable planets. This initial burst of explication (delivered via an opening voiceover) is somewhat obscured by a sound mix favoring composer Andrew Hulshult’s almost incessant score. Later audio intel from subsidiary figures is likewise frequently rendered unintelligible by distortion, staticky transmission, etc. \n\n\tErgo it’s often even more puzzling to the audience than it is to Simon just what he’s discovering, or being subjected to. When not getting tossed around the sub by turbulence, he spies ominous skeletal “alien shit” in the deep, locates an abandoned prior vessel like his own, becomes privy to the dire warnings of a dead predecessor, inadvertently irradiates some surface crew, has brief childhood flashbacks, and generally tries to stay alive. His oxygen supply keeps going down, while blood dripping from the ceiling suggests this container is less than airtight. The perils are plentiful, if seldom very vivid, as we’re stuck in this claustrophobic crate with him. He grows increasingly uncertain “what’s real anymore.” Whether he’s hallucinating or not carries little import, unfortunately, when the things he might or might not be seeing/hearing aren’t all that scary, or even interesting.\n\n\tFischbach, who looks-wise is in the general wheelhouse of Adam Driver or Keanu Reeves, does just fine as an actor in this non-jokey context. But as director, he risks the charge that he’s let a fuzzy story stretch out way too long just to throw his star more histrionic rope. “Iron Lung” is survival simulation game with very long odds, basically guaranteeing the player’s doom. But here the viscous-soaked conclusion feels so bereft of meaning, many viewers will just what if any point the whole proceedings had. Their repetitiousness has already eroded patience too much for an ambiguous ending to satisfy.\n\t\n\n\tNonetheless, “Lung” impresses in many respects, including its design contributions — as narrow a gamut as they’re allowed to run. Cinematographer Philip Roy can hardly avoid over-emphasis on closeups or shaky-cam, but the often dark imagery (Simon gets granted only brief cabin illumination) is resourceful enough. Likewise Fischbach’s editing, which closing credits reveal got assistance from no less than six “additional” editors. They do a strong job of maintaining an anxious rhythm, though after a while you can’t help realizing this script would have played considerably better at 90 minutes or less. A major atmospheric contributor is Hulshult’s alternately rumbling and pounding score, even if its impact comes at the cost of burying some verbiage here. \n\n\tA whole lotta gooey blood (albeit scant violence) aside, “Iron Lung’s” R rating seems to derive primarily from Simon continually dropping the f-bomb. For an ostensible sci-fi horror movie from a sci-fi horror game, it could have used a wee more actual horror content.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJelly Roll declined to weigh in on politics while speaking to reporters in the press room backstage Sunday night at the Grammy Awards, where he won best contemporary country album for “Beautifully Broken,” the first-ever winner in the newly introduced category.\n\n\t“People shouldn’t care to hear my opinion. I’m a dumb redneck,” Jelly Roll said when asked about the current state of politics. “I hate to be the artist that sounds aloof, but I just feel so disconnected from what’s happening. I didn’t know politics were real until I was in my mid-20s in jail. That’s how disconnected you are when you grow up in a drug-addicted household.”\n\t\n\n\tThe artist added that while he was not ready to share his views during the ceremony, his silence would not be permanent.\n\n\n\t“I have a lot to say about it, and I’m going to in the next week, and everybody’s going to hear exactly what I have to say about it the most loud and clear way I’ve ever spoken in my life,” he said.\n\n\tJelly Roll was named the inaugural recipient of best contemporary country album at the 68th annual Grammys.\n\n\t“I think this is awesome to be the first one to win the contemporary one,” he said. “It’s the Grammys always showing how hip they are — what’s actually going on in music. It’s been an undeniable tsunami of what country music’s done the last half decade.”\n\n\tReflecting on his younger self, he said a 16-year-old version of him might have believed such a moment was possible, even if he could not imagine how.\n\n\t“As horrible as some of the things that are fitting to happen, God is going to use that in a way that you could never dream of,” he said, recalling years marked by addiction and incarceration.\n\t\n\n\tThe country artist also spoke candidly about his recent weight loss and mental health journey, describing it as another form of recovery.\n\n\t“I had to fight my food addiction just the way I fought my drug addiction,” he said, adding that therapy and long-term lifestyle changes were key.\n\n\tFaith remained a central theme in his remarks. When asked for advice on spiritual struggles, Jelly Roll urged listeners to block out political and cultural noise and focus on personal connection.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDuring Sunday night’s Grammys, host Trevor Noah took a swipe at Donald Trump and his one-time friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\tAfter Billie Eilish won the song of the year Grammy, Noah transitioned for a moment with a joke at Trump’s expense.\n\n\t“There you have it, song of the year! Congratulations, Billie Eilish. Wow. That’s a Grammy that every artist wants — almost as much as Trump wants Greenland. Which makes sense because, since Epstein’s gone, he needs a new island to hang out with Bill Clinton. I told you, it’s my last year! What are you going to do about it?”\n\t\n\n\tNoah has previously announced that this will be his final year hosting the Grammys after six turns as emcee. Despite being a “Daily Show” alum, his Grammys hosting gigs have been light on any political commentary.\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, Trump has downplayed his interactions with Epstein. In 2025, he said he had a falling out with the deceased sex offender over him poaching employees from the Mar-a-Lago spa. On Friday, another massive trove of Epstein’s files, numbering more than 3 million files, were released publicly.\n\n\t“People were taken out of the spa — hired by him — in other words, gone. And other people would come and complain, ‘This guy is taking people from the spa,'” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “I didn’t know that. And then when I heard about it, I told him, I said, ‘Listen, we don’t want you taking our people, whether it was spa or not spa, I don’t want them taking people.’ And he was fine. And then not too long after that, he did it again. And I said, ‘Out of here.'”\n",

Based on George R. R. Martin’s “Tales of Dunk and Egg” novellas, “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” follows the lumbering hedge knight Ser Duncan the Tall (Peter Claffey) and his tiny, bald squire Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell), who’s revealed to be a Targaryen. Egg ran away from his father, Maekar Targaryen (Sam Spruell) and his cruel brother Aerion (Finn Bennett), shaved his head and joined Dunk at the jousting tourney.\n\n\t“A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” takes place between “Game of Thrones” and “House of the Dragon,” about 90 years before the main series and 78 years after the Targaryen-focused prequel. The new series ditches the dragons and political drama and instead is a 30-minute, lighthearted romp that follows Dunk and Egg’s exploits. However, there are still several new white-haired, dragon-loving Targaryens to meet in this prequel.\n\n\tAs “A Song of Ice and Fire” readers know, for the majority of its known history, Westeros was ruled over by the Targaryens, a dynasty of powerful dragon riders that conquered the Seven Kingdoms and sat on the Iron Throne for hundreds of years. They were known for their white hair, hot tempers and and protecting their bloodline by practicing incest. Their first king was Aegon the Conqueror, who united Westeros under Targaryen rule for the first time, and the modern era after his reign was known as “AC” for “After Conquest.”\n\n\t“House of the Dragon,” set 200 years before “Game of Thrones” is the earliest look at Westeros history and is based on Martin’s “Fire & Blood” novel. The show follows the infamous Dance of the Dragons, a civil war that resulted in the deaths of many of the Targaryens and their dragons. It was a result of the murky line of succession after King Viserys Targaryen died and his rightful heir was heavily disputed. Two factions fought the civil war: The blacks consisted of Rhaenyra and Daemon Targaryen along with their children and allies on Dragonstone; and the greens were led by young King Aegon II Targaryen, his mother Queen Alicent Hightower and their High Council in King’s Landing.\n\n\tThe majority of the Targaryens died out before the events of “Game of Thrones,” and their lineage nearly ended after Robert Baratheon took the Iron Throne during Robert’s Rebellion. For nearly all of “Game of Thrones,” Daenerys Targaryen plotted to take back the crown and grew an army in the neighboring continent of Essos. She eventually led an assault on King’s Landing after hatching three dragon eggs and destroyed the capital city. However, in the series finale, Daenerys was killed by Jon Snow, who was revealed to be a long-lost Targaryen in a twist that fans of the novels had long predicted. As it stands in current Westeros history, Jon is the only surviving Targaryen.Below, Variety has listed a family tree of every Targaryen that has so far appeared in “Game of Thrones,” “House of the Dragon” and “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.” There are no spoilers for what could happen in future seasons of “House of the Dragon,” though curious fans can read the novel “Fire & Blood” and “Tales of Dunk and Egg” to find out.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJaehaerys I Targaryen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 34 ACDied: 103 ACNickname: The Old KingDragon: VermithorFamily: Grandson of King Aegon the Conqueror; son of King Aenys; nephew of King Maegor; husband and brother of Queen Alysanne; grandfather of King ViserysPlayed by: Michael Carter\n\n\tJaehaerys was the fourth Targaryen king of Westeros, and the longest-serving at 55 years on the Iron Throne. He’s the earliest monarch shown in “Game of Thrones” and “House of the Dragon” history. In the opening scene of “House of the Dragon,” he chooses his grandson Viserys to succeed him over his granddaughter Rhaenys, a decision that would eventually lead to the Dance of Dragons.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tViserys I Targaryen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: HBO\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 77 ACDied: 129 ACNickname: Viserys the PeacefulDragon: BalerionFamily: Cousin and husband to Queen Aemma; husband to Queen Alicent; brother to Daemon; cousin to Rhaenys; father to Rhaenyra, Aegon II, Aemond, Helaena and Daeron Played by: Paddy Considine\n\n\tViserys played a major role in “House of the Dragon” Season 1, where he ruled over Westeros as its fifth Targaryen king during a time of relative peace. However, the issue of choosing his heir would force his children to launch the Dance of Dragons civil war. Refusing to let his brother Daemon or his daughter Rhaenyra sit on the Iron Throne, Viserys was desperate for a male heir and remarried Alicent Hightower after the death of his first wife Aemma Arryn during childbirth. He later died of leprosy and the black High Council named his son, Aegon II, as king over Rhaenyra and her son Aegon III. On his deathbed, Viserys told Alicent about the Song of Ice and Fire and how “Aegon” would be the Westeros’ savior, but Alicent twisted his words and used it to put her son on the Iron Throne. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRhaenys Targaryen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: HBO\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 74 ACDied: 129 ACNickname: The Queen Who Never WasDragon: MeleysFamily: Cousin to King Viserys; wife of Lord Corlys Velaryon; mother of Laena and Laenor Velaryon; aunt of RhaenyraPlayed by: Eve Best\n\n\tPassed over twice by her grandfather King Jaehaerys to rule Westeros, first in favor of her uncle Baelon and then her cousin Viserys, Rhaenys came to be known as the Queen Who Never Was. She married Lord Corlys Velaryon, the wealthiest man in the realm and a powerful sea captain, and clung to some power but harbored resentment toward King Viserys. During the Dance of Dragons, she supported Rhaenyra in her claim for the Iron Throne. In Season 2 of “House of the Dragon,” she and Meleys were killed by Aemond Targaryen and his dragon Vhagar at the Battle of Rook’s Rest.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDaemon Targaryen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: HBO\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 81 ACNickname: The Rogue PrinceDragon: CaraxesFamily: Brother of King Viserys; husband of Laena Velaryon; father of Rhaena, Baela, Aegon III and Viserys II; uncle and husband to RhaenyraPlayed by: Matt Smith\n\n\tDaemon was one of the strongest warriors in all of Westeros, deadly with his sword, Dark Sister, and incredibly unpredictable. As the younger brother to Viserys, he was passed over for the Iron Throne and embarked on a conquest of the Stepstones with the Velaryon fleet and his dragon. When he returned, he married his niece Rhaenyra and led their black council. Before Rhaenyra, he was first married to Rhea Royce, who mysteriously died after falling from her horse, and Laena Velaryon, who died in childbirth and with whom he shared daughters Rhaena and Baela. In addition to commanding King’s Landing’s City Watch, Daemon was also a fan of its brothels and took his lover Mysaria as his mistress of whispers. In Season 2 of “House of the Dragon,” he takes over the castle of Harrenhal for Rhaenyra’s greens.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRhaenyra Targaryen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 97 ACNickname: The Realm’s Delight; The Whore of Dragonstone; The Pretender; King Meagor With TeatsDragon: SyraxFamily: Daughter of King Viserys and Queen Aemma; stepdaughter of Queen Alicent; wife of Laenor Velaryon; lover of Criston Cole and Harwin Strong; niece and wife to Daemon; half-sister to Aegon II, Aemond and Heleana; mother of Jacaerys, Lucerys, Joffrey, Aegon III and Viserys IIPlayed by: Emma D’Arcy and Milly Alcock (younger)\n\n\tEven though Rhaenyra was the first-born child of Viserys, the king wanted a male heir, and soon the line of succession was muddied with the birth of Rhaenyra’s half-brother Aegon II. She led her black council against King Aegon II and Queen Alicent’s greens when Aegon was declared king after Viserys’ death. The true paternity of Rhaenyra’s three eldest children, Jacaerys, Lucerys and Joffrey, was disputed. She was married to Laenor Velaryon, who was rumored to be gay, but Harwin Strong was thought by many to be the father of her eldest children, who shared his dark hair and common-born features. She and Daemon later had two sons, Aegon III and Viserys II, and one stillborn daughter. She commands the black council from Dragonstone.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAegon II Targaryen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 107 ACNickname: Aegon the Elder; Aegon the UsurperDragon: SunfyreFamily: Son of King Viserys and Queen Alicent; brother of Aemond, Helaena and Daeron; half-brother of Rhaenyra; uncle to Jacaerys and Lucerys; father of Jaehaerys, Jaehaera and MaelorPlayed by: Tom Glynn-Carney and Ty Tennant (younger)\n\n\tAegon II became the sixth Targaryen king of Westeros after the death of his father, Viserys. Named for his great-great-great-grandfather Aegon the Conqueror, Aegon II was lazy as a teen and allegedly raped one of his mother’s chambermaids. He was later named heir to the Iron Throne over his half-sister Rhaenyra, and the two were vehemently opposed during the Dance of Dragons. He was married to his sister Helaena and had three children, Jaehaerys (who was killed by Blood and Cheese), Jaehaera and Maelor. During the Battle of Rook’s Rest, he was betrayed by his brother Aemond and severely burnt by his dragon Vhagar.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAemond Targaryen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 110 ACNickname: Aemond One-Eye; Aemond the KinslayerDragon: VhagarFamily: Son of King Viserys and Queen Alicent; brother of King Aegon II, Helaena and Daeron; half-brother of Rhaenyra; uncle to Jacaerys and Lucerys Played by: Ewan Mitchell and Leo Ashton (younger)\n\n\tAemond was the younger and more vicious son of King Viserys and Queen Alicent compared to his brother Aegon II, who would go on to be king. As a teen, Aemond snuck away to claim Vhagar, one of the oldest and biggest dragons in Westeros, after the death of its rider, Laena Velaryon. He was caught by his nephews Jacaerys and Lucerys Velaryon and got into a fight with them, which resulted in Lucerys slashing Aemond’s eye. Aemond put a sapphire in the eye socket and wore an eye patch from then on. He got his revenge on Lucerys when the two were flying above Storm’s End and Vhagar killed Lucerys and his smaller dragon Arrax. During the battle of Rook’s Rest, he and Vhagar killed Rhaenys Targaryen and her dragon Meleys. He also ambushed and severely burnt his brother Aegon II and became prince regent in his stead.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHelaena Targaryen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 109 ACDragon: DreamfyreFamily: Daughter of King Viserys and Queen Alicent; sister and wife to Aegon II; sister to Aemond and Daeron; mother of Jaehaerys, Jaehaera and MaelorPlayed by: Phia Saban and Evie Allen (younger)\n\n\tHelaena was the only daughter of Viserys and Alicent, and she often spoke in peculiar phrases that somehow foretold the future. She predicted that her brother Aemond would lose an eye, and she spoke of a “beast beneath the boards” before Rhaenys burst through the floor of Dragonstone on her dragon during Aegon’s coronation. She was married to her brother Aegon and had three children, Jaehaerys (who was killed by Blood and Cheese), Jaehaera and Maelor.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJaehaerys, Jaehaera and Maelor Targaryen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 123 AC and 127 ACDied: 129 AC (Jaehaerys)Family: Children of Aegon and Helaena\n\n\tTwins Jaehaerys and Jaehaera are seen briefly in Season 1 of “House of the Dragon,” and Maelor is their younger brother. In Season 2, Jaehaerys is killed in the premiere by Blood and Cheese, who were sent by Daemon out of revenge for the death of Rhaenyra’s son Lucerys.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJacaerys Velaryon\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 114 ACNickname: JaceDragon: VermaxFamily: Son of Rhaenyra and Laenor Velaryon or Harwin Strong; brother of Lucerys and Joffrey; nephew to King Aegon II and AemondPlayed by: Harry Collett and Leo Hart (younger)\n\n\tMany in King’s Landing suspected that Jacaerys and his brothers were actually the sons of Rhaenyra’s knight Ser Harwin Strong, instead of her husband Laenor Velaryon. Aemond mocked them as “strong boys,” which led to the fight where Lucerys slashed Aemond’s eye with his sword. Jacaerys fought on the side of his mother’s black faction and was betrothed to his cousin, Baela. During the Dance of Dragons, Jace gathers allies on behalf of his mother.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLucerys Velaryon\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 115 ACDied: 129 ACNickname: LukeDragon: ArraxFamily: Son of Rhaenyra and Laenor Velaryon or Harwin Strong; brother of Jacaerys and Joffrey; nephew to King Aegon II and AemondPlayed by: Elliot Grihault and Harvey Sadler (younger)\n\n\tLucerys was tasked with flying his dragon Arrax to Storm’s End to enlist Lord Borros Baratheon to Rhaenyra’s side of the Targaryen civil war. However, Aemond beat him there and offered to marry one of Borros’ daughters. Lucerys, already betrothed to his cousin Rhaena, couldn’t match Aemond’s offer, and the two battled high above Storm’s End on their dragons.

They also had a stillborn daughter named Visenya, who was named after the powerful sister-wife of Aegon the Conqueror. Rhaenyra named her son Aegon in honor of the original Targaryen ruler, but also as a sleight to her half-brother King Aegon II. Her other son was named for King Viserys, her father and Daemon’s brother. The two were sent away to Essos during the Dance of Dragons.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRhaena and Baela Targaryen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 116 ACDragon: Moondancer (Baela)Nickname: Dragon TwinsFamily: Daughters of Daemon and Laena; cousins of Jacaerys, Lucerys, Joffrey, Aegon II, Aemond, Helaena and DaeronPlayed by: Phoebe Campbell and Eva Ossei-Gerning (younger); Bethany Antonia and Shani Smethurst (younger)\n\n\tRhaena and Baela are the twin daughters of Daemon and his second wife Laena Velaryon. They are betrothed to their cousins, Jacaerys and Lucerys, in order to strengthen the bond between the Targaryens and Velaryons.

As readers of the “Dunk and Egg” novellas know, the young Targaryen heir later becomes the 15th king of Westeros.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMaester Aemon\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 198 ACDied: 300 ACNickname: Aemon TargaryenFamily: Son of King Maekar I and Dyanna Dayne; brother of Egg and Aerion; great-great uncle of Daenerys; great-great-great uncle of Jon SnowPlayed by: Peter Vaughan\n\n\tMaester Aemon hid his true identity as a Targaryen after joining the Night’s Watch, and he grew so old that nearly everyone in Westeros forgot about his heritage. He refused to sit on the Iron Throne after his father, King Maekar I, died, so his younger brother Aegon V, aka Egg, who traveled with the hedge knight Ser Duncan the Tall, became king. At Castle Black, Aemon mentored Jon Snow and was the tiebreaker to vote him as the 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch before he died of old age.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThree-Eyed Raven\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: UnknownDied: 303 ACNickname: Brynden Rivers; BloodravenFamily: Legitimized bastard son of King Aegon IV and Melissa BlackwoodPlayed by: Max van Sydow and Struan Rodger (previously)\n\n\tKing Aegon IV was known for having many bastard children with different wives. On his deathbed, he legitimized all of his bastards, which led to the First Blackfyre Rebellion where his children all fought to be the true heir to the Iron Throne. Brynden was later sent to the Night’s Watch, where he was lost north of the Wall and presumed dead. There are theories that the greenseer Three-Eyed Raven that Bran Stark sees in his visions and meets beyond the Wall in “Game of Thrones” is actually Brynden under a new title. He trains Bran in the mystical art of greensight but is later killed by the Night King.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAerys II Targaryen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 244 ACDied: 283 ACNickname: The Mad King; King ScabFamily: Son of King Jaehaerys II and Queen Shaera; Father of Rhaegar, Viserys and Daenerys; husband and brother of Queen Rhaella; grandfather of Jon SnowPlayed by: David Rintoul\n\n\tDespite playing a major role in “Game of Thrones,” Aerys the Mad King only appeared in a brief flashback to his chaotic reign over Westeros. Driven insane by generations of incest and paranoia, he developed an odd fascination with dragonfire, refused to cut his hair or fingernails and abused his sister-wife Rhaella. He appointed Tywin Lannister as his Hand of the King, though their friendship eventually soured, and named Tywin’s son Jaime as the youngest-ever knight to join the Kingsguard. Robert Baratheon, Eddard Stark and their rebel allies joined forces to overthrow the Mad King during Robert’s Rebellion. Tywin betrayed Aerys and let the rebels into King’s Landing, where Jaime stabbed the Mad King in the back and earned the nickname the Kingslayer. The Targaryen dynasty ended with the rise of King Robert.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRhaegar Targaryen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 259 ACDied: 283 ACNickname: Silver Dragon; Dragon Prince; Last DragonFamily: Son of King Aerys II and Queen Rhaella; brother of Daenerys and Viserys; husband of Elia Martell and Lyanna Stark; father of Jon SnowPlayed by: Wilf Scolding\n\n\tRhaegar was born at the end of the Targaryen dynasty. With no siblings old enough to wed, he instead married Elia Martell of Dorne. They had one daughter, Rhaenys, who later died in the Sack of King’s Landing during Robert’s Rebellion. Rhaegar kicked off Robert’s Rebellion by courting Lyanna Stark during a tourney at Harrenhal. The scandal angered Lyanna’s betrothed Robert Baratheon, who united with her brother Eddard Stark to rebel against the Targaryens. Many believed that Rhaegar kidnapped Lyanna and raped her at the Tower of Joy in Dorne, where she died. However, the penultimate season of “Game of Thrones” revealed that Rhaegar and Lyanna were in love, secretly married and she gave birth to Aegon Targaryen, better known as Jon Snow. After Robert killed Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident, Eddard was the only person who knew Jon’s true heritage and promised to raise him as his own bastard.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tViserys III Targaryen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 276 ACDied: 298 ACNickname: Beggar KingFamily: Son of King Aerys II and Queen Rhaella; brother of Rhaegar and Daenerys; uncle of Jon SnowPlayed by: Harry Lloyd\n\n\tAfter the deaths of King Aerys II, Rhaella and Rhaegar during Robert’s Rebellion, Viserys and Daenerys were sent to Braavos for protection. The two wandered the Free Cities of Essos, and Viserys eventually brokered a deal for Daenerys to marry Khal Drogo of the Dothraki horselords. Angry, spiteful and desperate for a crown, Viserys soon made an enemy of Drogo, who killed him by pouring molten gold onto his head.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDaenerys Targaryen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: HBO\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 282 ACDied: 305 ACNicknames: Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons; DanyDragons: Viserion, Rhaegal, DrogonFamily: Daughter of King Aerys II and Queen Rhaella; sister of Rhaegar and Daenerys; wife of Khal Drogo; aunt and lover of Jon SnowPlayed by: Emilia Clarke\n\n\tAfter Viserys’ death, Daenerys slowly gathered powerful allies like Tyrion Lannister, Lord Varys and Jorah Mormont, an army of Dothraki, Unsullied, Greyjoy ships and her three dragon hatchlings to take back the Iron Throne. She eventually united with Jon Snow, the King in the North and, unknown to either of them at the time, her long-lost nephew, to take on Queen Cersei Lannister. In a fit of Targaryen madness after winning the Battle of King’s Landing, Daenerys orders Drogon to burn the city and its residents. Surrounded by ash, a shocked and heartbroken Jon stabbed Daenerys in the heart as Drogon melted the Iron Throne.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJon Snow\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Helen Sloan\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBorn: 283 ACNicknames: Aegon Targaryen; the White Wolf; the King in the North; the Prince That Was PromisedFamily: Son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark; nephew and lover of Daenerys; bastard son of Eddard Stark; half-brother to Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon StarkPlayed by: Kit Harington\n\n\tBelieved to be the bastard son of Eddard Stark, Jon was actually the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, making him the true heir to the Iron Throne. Lyanna made Eddard promise to keep Jon’s parentage a secret to protect him. As an adult, Jon joined the Night’s Watch and was later named Lord Commander. He was murdered during a mutiny and resurrected by the Red Priestess Melisandre. Jon was proclaimed King in the North after taking back Winterfell from House Bolton, and he teamed up with Daenerys to defeat the Night King and his army of white walkers. After Daenerys burned down King’s Landing in her conquest for the Iron Throne, Jon betrayed his lover and killed her. At the end of “Game of Thrones,” Jon was exiled back to the Night’s Watch and led the freefolk north beyond the Wall.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBad Bunny, Natalie Lafourcade, And All the Grammy Wins for Latin Artists So Far\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow Traceable, Responsibly Sourced Gold Could Reshape the Future of the Industry\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAlcaraz Wins Australian Open, $2.8M Prize Money to Clinch Career Slam\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGetting Ready With Audrey Nuna for the Grammys in Thom Browne Couture\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

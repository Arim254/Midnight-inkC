    "body": "\n\tFor nearly the entirety of the “Wicked: One Wonderful Night” TV special, which aired on NBC Wednesday night, the performances were focused on Stephen Schwartz’s songs from the two “Wicked” movies. But for the two-hour show’s climax, stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo veered deliciously off-topic to cover a medley of songs first made famous 62 years ago by Barbra Streisand and Judy Garland.\n\n\tSome younger viewers may have been initially puzzled by the mashup, but fans of a certain age, or of a certain show-tune leaning, got it from the very first bar, or might have even dared to anticipate it when Erivo and Grande sat down on stools, side by side. It was the pairing of two distinct standards that both date back nearly a hundred years, “Get Happy” and “Happy Days Are Here Again.” The two classics have come to be conjoined in some people’s minds, but that is only because they were first sung that way by Garland and Streisand on a legendary episode of “The Judy Garland Show” in 1963.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tThe Judy/Barbra performance became the stuff of legend partly because it captured two legends at opposite ends of their careers. Streisand, then 21, was not only far from a superstar but hadn’t even done “Funny Girl” on Broadway yet — although she had earlier that year released her debut LP, “The Streisand Album,” which had as its Side 2 leadoff number “Happy Days Are Here Again.” That 1929 tune (written by Milton Ager and Jack Yellen) has remained a staple of her concerts (minus duets or interpolations) right up through her last tour in 2019.\n\t\n\n\tGarland was also singing a signature song for her half of the entwined duet — which was reportedly her idea, to jazz up the special. “Get Happy,” originally penned in 1930 (by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler), was a pseudo-gospel number she popularized in the 1950 MGM musical “Summer Stock” and continued to sing through the end of her life. Then 41, Garland was considered on the professional decline and was six years away from the end of her life when she personally brought in the nascent upstart for several numbers on the Oct. 6, 1963 episode of her weekly variety show.\n\n\tThis particular mashup hardly counts as culturally ubiquitous in 2025. But Grande and Erivo are far from the first to revive it in the modern era, as the medley continues to have cachet among musical theater actors looking for an impressive way to pair up. \n\n\tErivo herself has had some practice at it: She previously did it in tandem with Ben Platt one night during his London concert run in 2024. Scroll down to see video of the Erivo/Platt duet, along with other covers. (There’s no apparent record of Grande having sung it with anyone before; she has sung with Streisand both live and on record, but they missed an opportunity in not attempting the tune together.)\n\n\n\n\n\tIf the doubled-up cover feels somewhat familiar to a somewhat younger generation, it may be because it did get significant exposure through an episode of “Glee” from that show’s second season in 2011, as Lea Michele and Chris Coffer teamed up side by side — with Michele’s costuming obviously designed to resemble Streisand’s from 1963.\n\n\n\n\n\tOther duets that can be seen or heard in clips below include Rufus Wainwright with Kristin Chenoweth; Billy Porter with Cyndi Lauper; Audra McDonald with Patti LuPone — on repeated occasions over the years! (we know, we know); and, going back to 1964, Garland with her daughter, Liza Minnelli.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIn the fall of 1963, Garland was determined to have Streisand on her show after catching her at the the Cocoanut Grove in the summer. Norman Jewison, later to be a famous feature helmer, was the director of the Streisand episode (which also featured Ethel Merman and the Smothers Brothers). Mel Tormé was employed to work on special musical material for the series, and he offered backstory for the duet in his book “The Other Side of the Rainbow; With Judy Garland on the Dawn Patrol.” There, he wrote that Garland summoned him to her dressing room and suggested an inspired idea for the show, playing Streisand’s LP version of “Happy Days Are Here Again” while singing a counter-melody of “Get Happy.”\n\t\n\n\tWrote Tormé: “The result was electrifying, one of those chance discoveries in which two great songs jell into one extraspecial opus.”\n\n\tThat and the other performances by Streisand mightily impressed CBS executives, regardless of whether the guest was yet a major star at the time. They bumped the episode up ahead of some others that had already been filmed, and it aired just two days after it was recorded, on Oct. 6, 1963.\n\n\tA half-century or more later, it continued to impress. Profiling Streisand for the New York Times in 2016, the paper’s theater critic, Ben Brantley, wrote: “Each interpreted an upbeat song with a big, trumpeting voice that nonetheless hinted at a small, solitary figure within. Happiness, as hymned in these renditions, would never be won easily. You can find that video on YouTube, and it is impossible to watch it without shivering.”\n\n\tTalking with Brantley, Streisand said of Garland, “Afterward, she used to visit me and give me advice. She came to my apartment in New York, and she said to me, ‘Don’t let them do to you what they did to me.’ I didn’t know what she meant then. I was just getting started.”\n\n\tIn a 2005 interview with Diane Sawyer, Streisand said that Garland “was great. She was wonderful. Loved her … I was very secure then. I was only 21, I think. I wasn’t afraid of failure or anything. But it was interesting to see someone who was so great and so famous and so gifted … She was drinking Liebfraumilch — you know, a white wine — and her hands were shaking and she was holding onto me. I thought, what was this about? As one grows older, what is this fear? And I understand it now.”\n\n\tStreisand received her first Emmy nomination for the episode, in the category of Outstanding Performance in a Variety or Musical Program.\n\n\tFew contemporary singers would have the nerve to recreate a moment so very tagged to two of the greatest of the 20th century (or in Streisand’s case, 20th going on 21st), but few enjoy the good will, on top of the chops, that Erivo and Grande have going into the second and final part of the filmic “Wicked” franchise. If it turns out to be happy days for them at the Oscars, their ability to nail a tricky duet classic might have contributed just a little, if clips of the performance become as widely circulated as expected.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, let’s hear it for the audience that saw the taping at the Dolby Theatre Sept. 24 and somehow managed to keep the climax under wraps even on social media until now. EIther that, or they were too young to recognize its significance… Nah, let’s go with discretion.\n\n\tHere are a few of the other versions rendered from over the years, including another of the many, many times LuPone and McDonald did it over a period of at least a decade and a half, long before the former called the latter “not a friend” earlier this year. Perhaps this revival of the medley will inspire them to hold space for one another yet again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER WARNING: The following review describes the basic premise of “Pluribus,” but keeps other plot details under wraps to preserve the viewing experience.\n\n\tThere’s a lot I can’t tell you about “Pluribus,” the highly anticipated Apple TV drama that marks creator Vince Gilligan’s first venture outside the “Breaking Bad” universe in more than a decade. “Pluribus” is also the “X-Files” alumnus’ return to science fiction, a genre that adds an air of mystery to the already sky-high expectations that come with Gilligan’s CV. Apple considers even the most basic synopsis of the plot to be a spoiler, so I’ll hold off on one for now.\n\t\n\n\tInstead, I’ll start with what I can say about “Pluribus” without being coy, which is just how good Rhea Seehorn is in it.\n\n\n\tTo many viewers, Seehorn was the great discovery of “Better Call Saul,” AMC’s “Breaking Bad” prequel that was both less accessible and more rewarding than its predecessor. Bob Odenkirk’s slick-talking Saul Goodman was already a known quantity, if not his original identity Jimmy McGill; as Jimmy’s colleague-turned-love-interest Kim Wexler, Seehorn gave her partner’s moral decay real stakes, and turned potentially dry, legalistic plots into riveting television.\n\n\tHeading into “Pluribus,” you already know why Gilligan would want to build an entire show around an actor of Seehorn’s caliber. But it’s only by watching “Pluribus” that you understand why this concept would basically only work with Seehorn at its forefront. (In addition to topping the call sheet, Seehorn also executive produces.) She is the sine qua non of the entire enterprise — its center, its selling point, its load-bearing foundation. The show may be Gilligan’s blank-check moment, spending the proceeds of several hundred thousand iPhone sales on a big, epic swing. But it’s also Seehorn’s party, and she makes for an excellent host.\n\t\n\n\tHere’s where I have to get specific about the how and why, and give a final warning to spoiler hardliners. (Feels a little silly when you can get the gist from the trailer and Wikipedia, but rules are rules!) Seehorn plays Carol Sturka, a best-selling romance author who becomes exceptional in an entirely different way when the world undergoes “The Joining,” a process that begins in a top-secret military lab and spreads until every person on Earth is connected by what the resulting collective consciousness calls “psychic glue.” Well, almost every person on Earth. Carol is immune, and understandably upset when her partner Helen (Miriam Shor) becomes one of almost a billion casualties as The Joining takes effect. You have to break a few eggs to make one giant, unified mega-omelet.\n\n\tThis means “Pluribus” has essentially two characters: Carol, and everyone else. Hence why Seehorn, beloved by “Better Call Saul” fans but by no means a household name, is by far the most recognizable face in the cast, with due respect to recent Emmy winner Jeff Hiller. The hive mind created by the Joining has no name, prefacing many introductions with “this individual is known as…”; when Carol asks who they mean by “we,” they respond: “We is us. Just ‘us.’” Anonymity is a necessary prerequisite for setting the scene, barring a celebrity cameo or two to make a joke about the once famous individuals now transformed into obliging worker bees.\n\n\tThe first hour of “Pluribus” plays out like the apocalyptic horror the Joining sure sounds like when you describe it. Gilligan may not have spent his Apple budget on casting movie stars, but in directing the first couple of episodes, he leverages the global scope of the “Pluribus” concept into a vast and ominous sense of collapse. Carol and Helen witness a car crash outside a bar, clueing them in that something’s wrong; an upended ambulance tells Carol there’s no help on its way. The number of extras required to give a sense of the scale is mind-boggling, let alone the blocking required to make them move in perfect, terrifying synchronicity.\n\n\tBut once Carol starts to grasp the new normal, “Pluribus” becomes something more interesting and even-keeled than a struggle to survive. Gilligan may be returning to the same sci-fi register as his early career, yet there’s a clear carryover from “Better Call Saul” in the deliberate, patient pace of the episodes after panic and fear give way to silence and stillness. (There’s continuity behind the camera, too; many of the credited writers, like executive producers Gordon Smith and Alison Tatlock, are “Saul” veterans.) Humanity’s newly pooled personality is not malicious. Any violence caused by its creation was accidental, and it describes the impulse to absorb new individuals as a “biological imperative, like breathing.” These aren’t ravenous zombies, or sinister automatons. They’re calm, affable, eager to help and make Carol absolutely insane.\n\t\n\n\tCarol shares the wary intelligence that made Kim Wexler so captivating, but she’s more volatile than Kim ever was. (To be fair, while Kim saw some crazy shit in her time, she never lived through the end of individuality as a concept.) A misanthrope by nature, she reacts to the omni-person’s friendly sincerity with the same angry mistrust she once felt toward her readers, who embraced a purple-prosed pirate romance Carol herself found schlocky. When the Joined, having gleaned all of Helen’s memories and knowledge before she died, send an emissary named Zosia (Karolina Wydra) who looks exactly like the inspiration for the romantic hero in Carol’s novels, it has the opposite of the intended conciliatory effect.\n\n\t“Pluribus” doesn’t have the same mystery box feel as “Severance,” its closest analog in the current Apple roster, though it invites plenty of questions, such as: What do the Joined want? Do they have some plan for what to do with all their pooled mental resources? And most pressingly for the lonely, furious Carol, is there a way to undo this sudden, total change? There are also broader, more interpretive inquiries, like exactly what ideas Gilligan is getting at here. Is the Joining a metaphor for how AI and the algorithms are eroding our sense of self with comforting convenience? Or is “Pluribus” more of a pure philosophical debate between the risks of freedom and the reassurance of belonging? Zosia compares seeing Carol’s misery and wanting to subsume her to the instinct to save a drowning stranger. \n\n\tSeehorn’s presence is so magnetic here it both channels these themes and pushes them to the side. Alone in Albuquerque — still Gilligan’s home base, even as his ambitions have widened outward — Carol buckles under her grief, steels herself with determination, lashes out and makes do. She’s funny and pitiful, prickly and vulnerable. I could watch her smash golf balls through the windows of abandoned buildings all day. \n\n\t“Pluribus” can have the feel of an acting exercise, both for Seehorn and her manifold scene partners. That’s not a criticism; it’s a joy for a production this big to have such an experimental, risk-taking slant, and for a talent like Seehorn to get the canvas it deserves. You don’t necessarily miss the presence of a full, traditional cast, even as Carol admits she does miss her friends and neighbors. Hell may be other people, but to her, hell is really other people all combined into one mega-person.\n\t\n\n\tThe first two episodes of “Pluribus” will premiere on Apple TV on Nov. 7, with remaining episodes streaming weekly on Fridays.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Paley Center for Media‘s New York headquarters, the Paley Museum, is kicking off its 50th anniversary this week by unveiling a makeover — including two newly renovated theaters, a new exhibition and gathering area and more.\n\n\tThe Paley Museum, located in midtown Manhattan, was first created in 1975 by CBS founder William S. Paley as the Museum of Broadcasting, and then later as the Museum of TV & Radio. (The name was changed to the Paley Center in 2007). The museum later added a second building on the west coast in Beverly Hills (which opened in 1996 and closed in 2020). \n\t\n\n\t“For five decades, Paley has stood at the intersection of media, culture, and education, serving as a trusted resource for public audiences and educators alike. Recognized as the premier gathering place for the industry – presenting programs with unmatched convening power – Paley has evolved to its place as the preeminent media industry nonprofit,,” said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., executive vice chairman and former CEO of Hearst, and chairman of the Paley Center since 1991. \n\n\n\tThe Paley Museum continues to host events like the annual PaleyFest NY, as well as the annual holiday family event Paleyland, and the Paley archive, which features unique and rare video and audio programs.\n\n\tThe updates to Paley Museum (which was designed by Philip Johnson) were overseen by the Paley board’s renovation committee, which included Frank A. Bennack, Jr., Mark Lazarus, William C. Paley, Maureen Reidy, David Schoer, Somyanarayan Sampath, Jennifer Witz and Strauss Zelnick, along with Tom Gallagher of DLR Group.\n\t\n\n\t“The Paley Museum has proudly called New York City home for fifty years. Building on its storied legacy, it has become the destination where media, sports, gaming, and entertainment come together — offering blockbuster exhibits, interactive experiences, and once-in-a-lifetime events,” said Reidy, who serves as president and CEO of The Paley Center for Media. “With the unveiling of our newly renovated theaters and galleries, we extend our deepest gratitude to our generous donors — including the William S. Paley Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, and The Hearst Foundations — for making these new spaces possible.”\n\n\tAmong the changes: Two newly renovated theaters, including the 200-seat Bennack Theater and the George J. Gillespie, III Theater on the museum’s second floor. According to Paley, the theaters now include “new seating, plush carpeting, rich wood paneling, and refined finishes, complemented by state-of-the-art Dolby Atmos surround sound, advanced lighting design, and the latest in cutting-edge technology.”\n\n\tThe renamed George J. Gillespie, III Theater, sponsored by William S. Paley Foundation, honors a attorney, philanthropist and leader who served nearly three decades on the Paley Board and the Paley Foundation Board.\n\n\t“It is an honor to support The Paley Center for Media on the occasion of this milestone anniversary,” said the William S. Paley Foundation’s William C. Paley. “I believe my father would be very proud to see how Paley has grown from his original vision to the iconic destination that it has become today.”\n\n\tAlso new: the Bloomberg Gallery on the concourse level, via Bloomberg Philanthropies, which features a digital display wall and will feature immersive exhibits, as well as serve as a venue for receptions and events. The Paley Museum will also be featured on the Bloomberg Connects app starting Nov. 5.\n\n\t“The Paley Museum has helped document and share the incredible story of media’s evolution, from radio and television to the internet and social media and beyond,” said Bloomberg founder and former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. “We are glad to help the Museum mark its 50th anniversary by joining with it to open the new Bloomberg Gallery and launch Bloomberg Connects, and we look forward to seeing how the Museum continues to evolve as a hub for learning and leadership.”\n\t\n\n\tAnd then, the entrance to the Bennack Theater has been named the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Entrance. \n\n\t“As a nexus not only of media, but also of sports, politics, and entertainment, The Paley Museum offers us all the chance to better understand the cultural forces flowing through our lives,” said Stavros Niarchos Foundation co-president Andreas Dracopoulos. “We at SNF feel a strong resonance with our own work to broaden access to arts and culture, journalism and trusted information, always keeping humanity at the core.”\n\n\tAn upcoming second phase of the renovations will include content creation and podcast studios, as well as a new recording studio and television studio. \n\n\tStarting Friday, Nov. 7 through Nov. 16, this year’s PaleyFest NY November 7-16, includes conversations with country singer Trisha Yearwood, two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning, and the casts and creative teams from series “Pluribus,” “Landman,” “Power Book IV: Force” and “A Man on the Inside.”\n\n\tThe Paley Museum will host conversations with sportscaster Bob Costas on Dec. 9; next year, Paley Museum displays will include an event themed to the 50th season of “Survivor.” The venue will also hold a Super Bowl watch party, a new artist and songwriter series and more.\n",

The Fund was established with the Ladd family, honoring its namesake who died on Nov. 3.\n\n\tDiane Ladd was a three-time Academy Award nominated actress who starred in over 200 film and television titles over the past seven decades. She was a longtime supporter of the SAG-AFTRA Foundation and its emergency financial assistance program, advocating for the protection of performers facing health crises or struggling to pay medical bills. \n\t\n\n\tLadd’s daughter Laura Dern said in a statement, “My mom was always so moved when she spoke about the SAG-AFTRA Foundation’s crucial support of our members during hard times. She cared immensely about our fellow performing community and was a steadfast and outspoken advocate to help actors gain access to much needed health care in critical situations. It’s a testament of her commitment to our community that she wished to partner with the Foundation to establish The Diane Ladd Fund.”\n\n\n\tSAG-AFTRA Foundation executive director Cyd Wilson added, “The establishment of this Fund is a great honor to an actor who did much to highlight the needs of others. We do all we can to support performers in times of need and Diane understood this on a personal level. Our work literally changes lives and her generosity will help the assistance go further.”\n\n\tThose interested in supporting can donate to the Diane Ladd Fund on the SAG-AFTRA website here. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tBlake Lively claims she has suffered $161 million in damages due to the smear campaign launched against her during the release of “It Ends With Us.”\n\n\tLively’s attorneys allege she has lost at least $56.2 million in past and future earnings from acting, producing, speaking engagements and endorsements. They also allege that her beauty brand, Blake Brown, has lost $49 million, and her beverage company, Betty Buzz/Betty Booze, has lost $22 million due to the harm to her image.\n\t\n\n\tLively is scheduled to go to trial next March in her lawsuit against co-star and director Justin Baldoni, producer Jamey Heath, studio head Steve Sarowitz, and their publicists. She alleges that she was targeted with online vitriol in retaliation for raising sexual harassment complaints on set.\n\n\n\tHer attorneys allege that she has suffered at least $34 million in reputational harm, based on 65 million negative impressions about her generated on social media.\n\n\tIn her lawsuit, first filed on Dec. 31, 2024, Lively’s attorneys stated only that her damages exceeded $75,000. But in a disclosure provided to the defense in July, and made public on Wednesday, they argued she has suffered at least $161 million in actual damages. Her attorneys will also seek at least three times that in punitive damages.\n\n\tLively’s disclosure notes that her damages figure is preliminary, and subject to proof via expert testimony at trial.\n\n\t“These are wish list numbers,” said Gregory Doll, a lawyer at Doll Amir Eley in Los Angeles. “You want to put a big enough number to get the other side concerned and want to settle.”\n\t\n\n\tBaldoni’s team, for its part, had argued that he suffered $400 million in damages due to her defamatory and false allegations about him. That lawsuit was dismissed in June, as a judge ruled that Baldoni’s side could not sue for defamation over allegations raised in a legal claim.\n\n\tLively’s disclosure also includes a long list of Hollywood celebrities and executives who may have information relevant to the case, though few if any of the big names are expected to actually testify. The list includes Taylor Swift, Emily Blunt, Scooter Braun, Hugh Jackman, Gigi Hadid, Ari Emanuel, Sony Pictures chairman Tony Vinciquerra, and Sony film chief Tom Rothman.\n\n\tSwift’s potential involvement has been heavily litigated, with Baldoni’s camp making ultimately fruitless efforts to secure her deposition.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKaty Perry‘s new single “Bandaids” has her reflecting on the end of her relationship with actor Orlando Bloom. Equally as frightening and emotionally-taxing is the single’s matching “Final Destination”-style video where Perry finds her positive outlook on life — notably at the core of her “143” album and era — has run dry.\n\n\t“It’s not what you did, it’s what you didn’t,” Perry sings in the introduction of the pop track. “You were there, but you weren’t.” \n\t\n\n\tThe video, directed by Christian Breslauer (SZA, Lizzo, Ariana Grande, Doja Cat), stitches together scenes where Perry’s carelessness leads her to nearly die — this ranges from electrocution (after leaving the “Light and Love Crystals” store) to car crashes and more.\n\n\tAt the end of the video, where Perry proclaims “if I had to do it all over again, I would still do it all over again,” she is left listening to the empowering chorus of her “Woman’s World” single at a gas station where she lights a cigarette and causes an explosion. \n\n\tPerry and Bloom announced their split earlier this summer after nine years together. They are now co-parenting their daughter, Daisy Dove. In the video, Perry finds a moment of calm amid the anxiety of her near-death encounters when she spots a white daisy growing from the ground — another symbol reflecting her real-life state of mind.\n\n\t“Bandaids” marks Perry’s first comeback following the release of her “143,” which she followed and supported with a global tour that concludes in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 7. The record — which featured 21 Savage, Kim Petras, Doechii and JID — debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 upon its release. \n\t\n\n\tWatch the video below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tComcast has taken a step closer to making an offer for parts of Warner Bros. Discovery — but not WBD in its entirety — with the retention of two banking advisers, Variety has confirmed. \n\n\tComcast is among the players looking to potentially cut an M&A deal with Warner Bros. Discovery, which officially put itself on the block last month. Others seeking a play for WBD include David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance, which has made offers for the whole company, and Netflix.\n\t\n\n\tComcast has hired Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to evaluate a potential bid for WBD assets and has gained access to WBD’s financial data, a source familiar with the matter said, confirming a report by Reuters.\n\n\n\tComcast is in the process of splitting off most of NBCUniversal’s cable networks into a new company, Versant, a transaction expected to be completed by the end of 2025. The thinking is that Comcast would look to bid for WBD’s streaming and studios business; Warner Bros. Discovery is itself has been in the process of separating into two entities, Warner Bros. (HBO Max and studios) and Discovery Global (TV networks and Discovery+).\n\n\tLast month Warner Bros. Discovery’s announced that it had received in-bound M&A interest from “multiple parties” and has commenced a process to review such offers. WBD’s board said it will consider  a deal structure that would enable a merger of Warner Bros. (the streaming and studios side) with a third-party acquirer alongside a spin-off of Discovery Global to shareholders. \n\n\tMike Cavanagh, Comcast’s co-CEO, told analysts during the cable and media giant’s Q3 earnings call last week that “the bar is high” for the company to consider a major merger of acquisition. But he didn’t rule anything out — and suggested that Comcast’s ability to secure federal approval for any transaction would improve once the Versant spinoff of its linear cable channels (other than Bravo) into is completed.\n\t\n\n\tCavanagh said that “what we’d be looking for and what we’re going to look like post-Versant spin, I think more things are viable than maybe some of the public commentary that’s out there.”\n\n\tEllison, who just closed the deal to form Paramount Skydance in August, has made three escalating bids for Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. The board of Warner Bros. Discovery has rejected all three as too low, including Ellison’s most recent one last month for $23.50/share.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Netflix is exploring a bid for some piece of WBD and retained investment bank Moelis & Co. to put together a prospective offer, Reuters reported last week. Moelis was the financial adviser to David Ellison’s Skydance Media in its takeover of Paramount Global to former Paramount Skydance.\n\n\tNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors on its Q3 earnings interview last week that the company has “no interest in owning legacy media networks,” indicating that an acquisition of WBD in its entirety — including networks like CNN, TBS, HGTV and Food Network — is off the table. Sarandos did say Netflix can be “choosy” about its M&A targets, but he added: “Nothing is a must-have for us to meet our goals that we have for the business.”\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, speaking on the media conglom’s Q3 earnings call Thursday, said, “You’ve all seen media reports as to potential interested parties, and I won’t comment on anything specific. But it’s fair to say that we have an active process underway. When you look at our films like ‘Superman,’ ‘Weapons’ and ‘One Battle After Another,’ the global reach of HBO Max and the diversity of our networks offerings, we’ve managed to bring the best, most treasured traditions of Warner Bros. forward into a new era of entertainment and new media landscape.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTyler Perry is putting his spin on the classic holiday movie genre with his latest rom-com, “Finding Joy.”\n\n\tThe movie, now streaming on Prime Video, follows the unlikely love story of Joy and Ridge, played by Shannon Thornton and Tosin Morohunfola. The plot centers on Joy (Thornton), a New York-based fashion designer, who is overlooked at work. With the encouragement of her friends, Ashley (Brittany S. Hall) and Littia (Inayah), Joy, a hopeless romantic, follows her crush, Colton (Aaron O’Connell), to Colorado to meet his family — under the impression that the trip will take their relationship to the next level. But upon arrival, Joy quickly gets friend-zoned when her crush reveals he has a fiancée. Joy attempts to book a flight back to the city, but finds herself stranded in the middle of a snowstorm and suffers a near-fatal car crash. Ridge (Morohunfola) not only saves her life but also reshapes her outlook on everything — especially, love.\n\t\n\n\tBut “Finding Joy” isn’t your typical Hallmark-esque film where a successful single woman from the city adopts a newfound appreciation for Christmas in a small town after falling for a handsome, local man. Instead, the film separates itself from the genre’s cheesier elements by inviting audiences on a heartfelt journey that explores the true meaning of love, resilience and personal growth found in unexpected circumstances. Plus, Perry puts an emphasis on spotlighting Black love.​ \n\n\n\t“It’s Black,” Thornton tells Variety, emphasizing what makes this story unique. “It’s the Black experience. It’s how we actually talk to each other.”\n\t\n\n\t​Over the years, audiences have critiqued Perry for perpetuating negative stereotypes and centering Black women in limited storylines that are mired in struggle, hardships and trauma. However, “Finding Joy” veers away from those tropes and combines themes of grief, heartbreak and sisterhood to highlight hope, healing and the transformative power of love.\n\n\t“I love that it’s just unexpected, and they’re kind of just going with what they feel, and not really playing games,” Thornton says. “They’re forced together in almost unnatural circumstances, and they just came together in a beautiful and unexpected way. It’s a really nice, really adorable way to show Black love on screen.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShannon Thornton, Inayah, Brittany S. Hall in “Finding Joy.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChip Bergmann/Prime\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWorking with Perry was an adventure all its own. While it wasn’t Thornton’s first time taking part in one of Perry’s productions — she was a supporting player in his Netflix movie “Mea Culpa” — it was both the actors’ first time as his main stars.\n\n\t“He welcomed me with open arms,” Morohunfola says about meeting Perry for the first time. “He empowered me to feel like I could make the character my own and also honor his vision at the same time. I knew I was in good hands.”\n\n\tPerry’s famously fast production schedule took some getting used to, though. “Finding Joy” was shot in just five days, so the pressure was on. \n\n\t“It was a fun and exciting challenge for me as an actor,” Thornton says. “I’m like, ‘What can I do if I had this amount of time and not be reliant on so many takes?’ I’m really happy with what I did given the amount of time I had.”\n\n\tBut Thornton can’t take all the credit for memorizing the script so quickly; Perry had a group of readers on set who helped run lines. “I wasn’t sure I could do it, or if I was capable of memorizing so much in a short amount of time, but I did it,” she adds. “As an actor, I was able to make very honest choices and still be fully in it, and have little moments of nuance.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAaron O’Connell and Shannon Thornton in “Finding Joy.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChip Bergmann/Prime\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAudiences might recognize Thornton as Keyshawn from the Starz series “P-Valley.” But her role on the ensemble drama didn’t compare to what stepping into her first leading film role required, and she battled instances of “imposter syndrome” and “self-doubt.”\n\t\n\n\t​“I had a little bit of experience while shooting ‘P-Valley’ Season 2, when Keyshawn gets her own episode. I got that little feeling in my belly like, ‘Can I do this? Am I capable of carrying something like this on my own?’” Thornton says of preparing for the part. “It’s the little moments of doubting yourself. And you have to say, ‘I deserve to be here. I’m going to receive all of these great things coming my way. I’m absolutely capable.’ That’s when the training comes in, and all the hard work that you put in for years leading up to this moment.”\n\n\tThat’s one of the ways Thornton resonated with Joy, whose pursuit of launching her own fashion line resembled Thornton’s journey as an actor. (Thornton lived in New York for 11 years, trying to get her big break.) “That’s how I can relate to her,” Thornton says of sharing a similar backstory with the character. “The hustle of having something to do and somewhere to be as soon as you wake up. The discomfort of your situation being the catalyst that gets you going.”\n\n\tSimilarly, Morohunfola also identified with Ridge’s country upbringing — raised in Greensburg, Kan., Morohunfola’s was the only Black family in the small, rural town — but what resonated most was the love story unfolding between the two characters.\n\n\t“That happens all the time: people whom you don’t think that you’re supposed to be connected to, somehow you feel a connection with, and they unlock something in you that you never knew needed to be unlocked. That’s as human as could be,” he explains. “I’ve experienced that in the past. The best part of life is the magic of love in unexpected places.”\n\n\tMorohunfola admits he isn’t the biggest fan of holiday movies, but when he first read the script for “Finding Joy,” Ridge’s range of emotions stood out.\n\n\t“Not every holiday movie has depth, and that’s something that drew me to this one,” he explains. “When I saw Ridge, I immediately saw somebody more than two-dimensional. On the outside, he has a rough exterior, but underneath that, you’ve got a vulnerable, loving and caring person who needs the help of the right person to bring that out.”\n\n\tHe adds: “I always look for characters with layers that remind me of men that I’ve seen in my life and can identify with. There are a lot of people walking around with pain that makes them seem tough on the outside, but they’re capable of love like anybody else.”\n\t\n\n\tMorohunfola hopes that audiences will come away from the film having learned something about love.\n\n\t“This film does a good job of depicting how love doesn’t care about those boundaries,” Morohunfola says. “Joy thinks she’s high class and above Ridge as a city girl. Ridge is a rural, country boy who doesn’t care for social media or any basic modernity. But it doesn’t matter how different they are culturally, because what brings them together is stronger than any of that.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShannon Thornton in “Finding Joy.”\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBob Iger is getting ready for his encore farewell.\n\n\tThe Disney CEO is starting to lay the stepping stones to the expected news of plans for a regime change at the top of the Mouse House by the first quarter of next year. In October 2024, Disney’s board of directors vowed to spell out its succession plan for Iger, who will have held the top job for 20 years by the time his current contract ends in December 2026.\n\n\n\tIger reflected on his time at the Disney in an interview with British podcasters Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook, hosts of the long-running podcast series “The Rest is History.” The pair turned their focus to the creation of Disneyland in the mid-1950s for an installment published Wednesday. Iger has long been a fan of the podcast and agreed to give the hosts a sit-down interview, as well as a guided tour of Disney’s archives in Burbank and the Magic Kingdom in Anaheim.\n\t\n\n\tHolland and Sandbrook politely but firmly press Iger about the transition that is just around the corner. Iger stepped down as CEO of Disney after a 15-year run that made him the gold standard of media and entertainment executives. He left Disney entirely at the end of 2021. But Iger was back as CEO by November 2022 after his first successor, studio veteran Bob Chapek, had a rocky tenure at a volatile time for the economy and the nation overall. At present, industry speculation about Iger’s successor centers on two internal candidates, Disney Entertainment co-chair Dana Walden and Disney Experiences chair Josh D’Amaro.\n\n\tIger made no direct reference to the Chapek shuffle or the handoff to come in discussing how he views his legacy, and what he has learned after four decades at the Walt Disney Co. and more than 50 years in the entertainment biz. Holland and Sandbrook pressed Iger about how he wanted to be remembered for his tenure as Mouse House chief. \n\t\n\n\t“Because of the company’s place in the world, I think the person running the company has a special responsibility of sorts, to maintain Disney’s position in the world as a beloved company, as an admired company, as a company that entertains really the world, everyone of all ages and from all different walks of life,” Iger says in the episode “Disneyland: The Modern American Utopia.”\n\n\t“More than anything else, I would want to be known as someone who was given the keys to this kingdom, so to speak. And quite a kingdom it is, and that I brought it to a place that even Walt would be proud of. And what that means is more great storytelling to a larger audience, more innovation, more risk-taking, more really creation of happiness. It’s really that simple,” Iger says. “At one point I thought, Well, OK, you’re now running Disney. What’s the most you want out of it? Well, not don’t screw it up, but it’s much more than that. I really have been mindful of the duty that I feel has been handed to me to make it even better than it’s ever been.”\n\n\tWhat does the road to the next 50 years of Disney, which marked its centennial in 2023, look like for his successor? Protect the brand, Iger advises.\n\n\t“The world is changing so rapidly and in such profound ways. As I think about the future, I would hope that my successors would be respectful of our past and well aware of the values that really created the value of the company in the first place, and carry them forward, but not let anything that’s been done in the past get in the way of bringing the company into the future,” Iger says. “And that’s really constant innovation, a constant exploration, constant desire to reinvent or to invent even more than anything else. That’s what I’d want. But I think we do occupy a place in the world as great storytellers, perhaps maybe the greatest in many respects. And I would hope that position would would continue for years and years, decades ahead.”\n\n\tMost of the interview was devoted to discussion of the innovations of Walt Disney himself, the creative visionary who died in 1966 at age 65. Iger proved to be a fount of knowledge about the company’s founder. His reverence for Walt Disney’s legacy of business derring-do coupled with a relentless push for innovation is clear as he runs through Walt Disney’s list of awe-inspiring achievements.\n\t\n\n\tThe yearning to invest in cutting-edge technology, R&D and experimental material is imbued in the DNA of a artist and entrepreneur from Missouri who bet his company on the gamble of releasing Hollywood’s first feature-length animated feature, 1937’s “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”\n\n\t“If you ask what everything is going to cost before you make everything, or even think about making something, then you end up not making a lot that you should have made,” Iger opines. \n\n\tWalt Disney was never one to be “cowed” by new technology, Iger added. Quite the contrary. He famously turned to the burgeoning medium of television to help raise the money to build Disneyland. Call it TV’s first docu-series.\n\n\t“Walt was, as we know, not only a great storyteller, but one of the all time, great salesmen of his time. , and he decided that not only to raise the money, but also to sell the product, he should have a television program. So he licensed to ABC, a program that essentially told the story of building Disneyland,” Iger says. “And so here I was as a 3-4-5 year-old, watching on small, black and white TV. Walt not only talk about building Disneyland, but watching it on the program actually rise from the ground in Orange County, California. And I remember it being incredibly aspirational. And I think actually it served that purpose to hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people around the world seeing it, which seemed like something that never existed before, a form of entertainment that he really invented.”\n\n\tThe hosts pressed Iger on how Disney is grappling with the the globalization of media and culture in a brand that is synonymous with Americana past and present. \n\n\t“It’s not purposeful on our part to become less American. It is purposeful on our part, to become more inviting to the world and to be mindful of cultural distinctions and cultural passion. For instance, when we were building Shanghai, the design brief that I gave to the team was, let’s build something that is authentically Disney, but distinctly Chinese,” Iger says. \n\n\t“Because we wanted to build something that was very much Disney to them, and they had an idea in mind of what A Disneyland would be, but something that was extremely respectful of their own culture, so that they could feel as though it were theirs. Again, it’s more purposeful to fit in a respectful way than to distance ourselves from anything like letting the French drink wine,” he says. “I think there were learnings about entering a country and a culture with a little bit more sensitivity and respect. We took those learnings seriously, and as we designed Shanghai, we made sure that we didn’t make mistakes that had been made in the past.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the interview below: \n\n\n\n",

Cops say Riera was paranoid and thought the folks he was arguing with were out to get him.\n      \n    \n          Cops say everyone involved was drinking ... and, fortunately, no one was injured.\n      \n    \n          Riera is being held without bond as he faces multiple criminal charges ... and two of the people he allegedly shot at ended up getting arrested during the police response. They were busted for resisting officers.\n      \n    \n          No word who is caring for Riera's chickens while he's in custody.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Shootings\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

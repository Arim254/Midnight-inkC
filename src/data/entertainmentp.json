    "description": "\n\tIs she a killer, or is she being framed? That’s the question at the heart of “Siren’s Kiss,” Studio Dragon’s new romance thriller landing on Prime V",
    "body": "\n\tIs she a killer, or is she being framed? That’s the question at the heart of “Siren’s Kiss,” Studio Dragon’s new romance thriller landing on Prime Video on March 2. \n\n\tDirected by Kim Cheol-gyu, whose previous credits include “Celebrity” and “Flower of Evil,” the series centers on three interlocking characters: Han Seol-ah, a captivating art auctioneer suspected of being a serial killer; Cha Woo-seok, an insurance investigator drawn into her orbit despite his suspicions; and Baek Jun-beom, a conglomerate heir surrounded by secrets. The cast is led by Park Min-young (“Marry My Husband,” “What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim”), Wi Ha-jun (“Squid Game”) and Kim Jung-hyun (“Crash Landing on You,” “Mr. Queen”).\n\t\n\n\tFor Kim, the project represented an opportunity to push his creative instincts to their limit. “From the opening of the first episode to the closing of the final one, tension never lets up,” he says, describing the series as one filled with “fresh concepts, unpredictable storytelling, and striking visual composition.” He adds that the genre “allows and demands a director to fully express their creative vision, imagination, and personal style,” calling the chance to helm the project “a tremendous stroke of luck.”\n\n\n\tPark, taking on a markedly different role from her previous work, describes Han Seol-ah as “a woman who has confined herself within ice.” To capture the character’s duality – a polished professional exterior masking profound inner darkness – the actress made deliberate physical and psychological adjustments during production. She drank nearly three liters of water daily and, reflecting the character’s emotional desolation, avoided anything more sustaining. “Han Seol-ah is a woman who has emotionally stopped nourishing herself,” Park explains. “Surrounded by repeated tragedy, she survives on water and alcohol alone.” She also employed the lowest vocal register she could produce, adding a slight breathiness to her delivery – a departure she describes as unlike anything she has attempted before.\n\t\n\n\tOn the styling front, Park drew on research into real-world auctioneers to develop a look that tracked Seol-ah’s shifting emotional states. Strong colors and bold materials defined the character’s public-facing persona, while neutral tones and slim silhouettes appeared in her more private moments. “Compared to the office looks I’ve shown before, I wanted to convey a more avant-garde sensibility,” she says.\n\n\tWi Ha-jun, who says he read the entire script in one sitting – something he describes as unusual for him – was drawn to both the series’ tension and its undertow of warmth. “Although the series is dense and filled with tension, it also carries warmth and a sense of human compassion,” he says, suggesting the show could offer viewers “a sense of healing simply through watching.” His approach to the character’s action sequences was equally considered; rather than prioritizing technique, he focused on what each movement could reveal emotionally. “I wanted each movement to reveal his emotional state, his mindset, and his relationship with the person he is facing,” he says.\n\n\tKim Jung-hyun, meanwhile, gravitated toward the instability at Baek Jun-beom’s core. “His demeanor shifts dramatically depending on the situation. At times he treats people as objects; at others, he shows an almost excessive warmth,” the actor says. He distills the character’s relationship to Han Seol-ah in a single image: “If Han Seol-ah is the sun, Baek Jun-beom is Icarus.”\n\n\tThe three-way dynamic between the characters, Park suggests, defies easy categorization. “Their relationship does not begin with warmth or affection. It starts from emotions closer to resentment,” she says. “They dislike each other, yet cannot help but want to see one another again.” Wi Ha-jun describes the trio’s connection as existing on “a precarious boundary between suspicion, love, and obsession.” Kim Jung-hyun likens it to a chain – one that, handled carelessly, might snap or tangle, but handled with care, might yet be unraveled.\n\n\tThe series makes extensive use of an art auction house setting, and Kim Cheol-gyu says the visual possibilities that environment presented were central to the production’s identity. “A remarkable number of artworks appear throughout the series – perhaps more than in any drama to date,” he notes, adding that these works “interact organically with the characters’ psychology, costumes, and emotional states.” Park notes that the production employed a camera lens previously unused in Korean drama, which she believes contributed to a look she would describe with a single phrase: “dangerously beautiful.”\n\t\n\n\tA particular sequence in Episode 5, in which all three characters collide for the first time, stood out to both the director and cast as a production highlight. “Watching the final edit with the music layered in, I remember thinking, ‘Did I really direct this?'” Kim Cheol-gyu says. On the score more broadly, he notes that the creative team pushed for music “entirely unique to this series,” and expresses confidence the soundtrack will draw significant attention upon release.\n\n\t“Siren’s Kiss” is a Studio Dragon production. The company, a subsidiary of CJ ENM, is behind such titles as “Crash Landing on You,” “The Glory,” “Queen of Tears” and “Marry My Husband,” among others.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Trump touted his economic achievements and attacked immigrants and Democrats in a divisive State of the Union address on Tuesday.\n\n\tTrump also criticized the Supreme Court, which struck down his emergency tariffs last week, and repeatedly castigated the Democratic side of the aisle for not applauding him.\n\n\t“These people are crazy,” he said. “Democrats are destroying our country, but we’ve stopped it in the nick of time.”\n\t\n\n\tTrump is facing the lowest approval ratings of his term, around 40%, with nearly 60% expressing disapproval. The White House has tried to move on from setbacks like the months-long Epstein controversy and pivot attention to affordability.\n\n\n\t“A short while ago, we were a dead country,” Trump said. “Now we are the hottest country anywhere in the world. The hottest.”\n\n\tTrump also promoted his record of stopping illegal immigration and accused Somali immigrants of defrauding the government. At one point, he told the Democratic members of Congress that they should be “ashamed” for refusing to stand when he said that the government’s first duty “is to protect American citizens, not illegal immigrants.”\n\n\tRep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali immigrant from Minneapolis, shouted back at him: “You should be ashamed.”\n\n\tTrump said the Supreme Court’s tariff ruling was “very unfortunate” and “disappointing.” Four justices of the court — John Roberts, Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — sat impassively with their hands folded while Trump rebuked the ruling.\n\n\tDavid Ellison, the CEO of Paramount Skydance, was among those in the audience, appearing as a guest of Sen. Lindsey Graham. The government is reviewing Netflix’s deal to acquire Warner Bros., while Paramount is angling to break up the deal with a competing bid.\n\t\n\n\tTrump also took several minutes of the speech to honor the U.S. men’s hockey team, which won gold at the Winter Olympics on Sunday, and to talk up the 2028 games in Los Angeles.\n\n\t“We’re going to do a good job in Los Angeles,” he said. “Los Angeles is going to be safe, just like Washington, D.C., is now one of the safest cities in the country.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“RRR” director S.S. Rajamouli has unveiled what is being billed as India’s most advanced motion capture facility, unveiling the A&M MoCap Lab at Hyderabad’s Annapurna Studios.\n\n\tThe facility is a joint venture between Akkineni Nagarjuna‘s Annapurna Studios and “Baahubali” producer Shobu Yarlagadda‘s Mihira Visual Labs, with Hollywood’s Animatrik Film Design – whose credits include “Avengers: Endgame,” “Spider-Man: No Way Home” and “RRR” – serving as the technology partner. During the unveiling, Rajamouli shared the first glimpse of the lab and confirmed that key sequences of “Varanasi,” which stars Mahesh Babu, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Prithviraj Sukumaran were captured there.\n\t\n\n\tFor Rajamouli, the facility closes a long-standing gap in Indian filmmaking infrastructure. “India has always had some of the world’s best technicians contributing to major global productions, but what we lacked was an advanced facility right here at home,” he said. “When I look back at some of my previous films like ‘Baahubali’ and ‘Eega,’ I reminisce how I could have made them even better if I had access to motion capture technology back then in India. With the introduction of A&M’s motion capture technology, that gap has finally been bridged. We utilized this facility in the making of crucial sequences in ‘Varanasi,’ and the results were simply fantastic.”\n\n\n\tNagarjuna framed the launch as a milestone for Indian cinema at large. “For decades, Indian filmmakers have aspired to tell large-scale stories that match global standards, but access to high-end technology was often a limitation,” he said. “With A&M, filmmakers can now bring everything from epic adventures to intricate science fiction dramas and animation films to life right here in Hyderabad.”\n\t\n\n\tYarlagadda, whose Mihira Visual Labs co-developed the facility, described it as part of a broader infrastructure-building effort. “For Indian cinema to truly compete on a global stage, it is essential to create advanced technology ecosystems within the country,” he said. “Seeing a filmmaker like S.S. Rajamouli utilize our A&M MoCap facility for ‘Varanasi’ reinforces our belief that the future of Indian storytelling will be driven by innovation built at home.”\n\n\tBrett Ineson, president and CTO of Animatrik Film Design, added: “We’re incredibly proud to see Animatrik’s motion capture technology powering this landmark facility at Annapurna Studios. Annapurna has long been a beacon of cinematic excellence, and partnering with them and Mihira Visual Labs to bring world-class performance capture capabilities to India is truly exciting. This collaboration represents a significant step in enabling filmmakers and creators to tell more immersive, emotionally rich stories with the highest global standards.”\n\n\tThe lab features a 60-by-40-by-30-foot capture volume equipped with Vicon Valkyrie VK26 cameras offering sub-millimeter optical tracking precision and real-time data streaming via Vicon Live. The setup integrates Unreal Engine for live virtual production previsualization and includes Stereo Head-Mounted Camera units for high-resolution facial performance capture. Notably, the facility is modular and expandable, allowing it to be disassembled and reassembled on location as productions require.\n\n\tC.V. Rao, CTO of Annapurna Studios, emphasized the facility’s utility as a pre-production tool. “Directors and cinematographers can experiment with camera blocking, lens choices, camera movements, and frame rates in a dynamic virtual environment, allowing critical creative decisions to be finalized during the motion capture stage, prior to principal photography,” he said, adding that the approach is designed to minimize costly trial-and-error during live shoots.\n\n\tThe launch comes as Annapurna Studios marks its 50th anniversary. The studio said it intends to open the facility to Indian and international filmmakers, game developers, and animation studios seeking a production partner in Asia. It is also not the first time Rajamouli has partnered with Annapurna on a technological milestone – he previously launched India’s first Dolby cinema processing facility at the same studio.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tS.S.

    "body": "\n\tBarcelona-based A Contracorriente Films, one of Spain’s top independent distributors, has taken Spanish distribution rights to M. A. Romero’s thriller “Hour and Twenty” (“Hora y veinte”), ahead of the film’s March 12 world premiere in the Málaga Festival’s official selection.\n\n\tA Contracorriente has also boarded international sales on the film, with the company in talks with regular partner Latido Films sales agency about a potential international rollout deal.\n\t\n\n\tWritten and directed by Romero and inspired by real events, the story is set on Christmas Eve, following Manuela, an emotionally distant mother whose six-year-old son vanishes in a shopping mall. As two Guardia Civil investigators pursue the case, Manuela is driven toward a more unsettling possibility: she may be losing her grip on reality.\n\n\n\tWith no evidence of a kidnapping, the case escalates when authorities uncover her criminal past — and no one claims to remember ever seeing her with a child. With time tightening, Manuela must prove her innocence before it’s too late.\n\n\tManuela is played by Goya nominee Macarena Gómez (“Shrew’s Nest”). Rounding out the lead roles are two-time Goya winner Roberto Álamo (“May God Save Us,” “The Skin I Live In”) and three-time Goya laureate Emma Suárez (“The Dog In The Manger,” “Julieta”).\n\n\tBoré Buika (“Palm Trees In The Snow”) and Alex Sorian Brown (“Evan Wood”) also star, with a special appearance from renowned Spanish vocalist Álex Ubago.\n\n\t“Hour and Twenty” is produced by Luces y Acción AIE, El Orgullo Producciones, Producciones La Cochera, Womack Studios, Sorenfilms and Shift Dif, and was shot on location in Torrevieja (Alicante), Martos (Jaén) and Madrid. The film is backed by Andalusian public broadcaster Canal Sur and  Torrevieja’s Town Hall.\n\t\n\n\tRomero described the film as a “relentless, high-concept thriller” designed to sustain tension throughout, while keeping the emotional stakes grounded. A Contracorriente’s involvement, he added, is “incredibly meaningful” not only for this release but for what he framed as a longer-term creative relationship.\n\n\t“As I continue developing new stories, it’s important to collaborate with partners who share the same ambition and vision for taking them beyond borders,” Romero said. \n\n\tActor-producer Salva Reina, CEO of Producciones La Cochera, called A Contracorriente’s boarding “Hour and Twenty” “a true validation of the film’s quality.” “Our hope is ‘Hour and Twenty’ can reach the widest possible audience – in theaters, on streaming services and across as many territories as possible,” Reina added.\n\n\tRomero previously directed the crime film “75 Días,” which opened in 2021. He is currently in pre-production on “Todo Sobre Mi Padre,” described as a homage to Pedro Almodóvar, Vicente Aranda and Carlos Saura, slated to begin shooting in late 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Rock & Roll Hall of Fame has announced 17 nominees for its class of 2026, with one of its most widely genre-spanning lists of contenders ever:\n\n\tThe Black CrowesJeff BuckleyMariah CareyPhil CollinsMelissa EtheridgeLauryn HillBilly IdolINXSIron MaidenJoy Division/New OrderNew EditionOasisPinkSadeShakiraLuther VandrossWu-Tang Clan\n\n\tThe 10 nominees appearing on the ballot for the first time are Jeff Buckley, Phil Collins, Melissa Etheridge, Lauryn Hill, INXS, New Edition, Pink, Shakira, Luther Vandross and Wu-Tang Clan. \n\t\n\n\tThe seven returning to the ballot after previous tries at getting elected are the Black Crowes, Mariah Carey, Billy Idol, Iron Maiden, Joy Division/New Order, Oasis and Sade. \n\n\tIf that seems like a large crop of nominees, it is. For 2025, the total number of contenders stood at 14, three fewer than this year’s roster.\n\n\tOf the seven returning to the ballot, five were on it just last year and make an instant return: the Black Crowes, Carey, Idol, Joy Division/New Order and Oasis. The singer for the latter band, Liam Gallagher, disavowed the Rock Hall when his band was previously twice nominated, but the nominating committee did not hold his recalcitrance against him this year.\n\n\tThe third time being nominated could be the charm for four of the artists: Carey, Iron Maiden, Joy Division/New Order and Oasis. The three second-time nominees, meanwhile, are the Black Crowes, Idol and Sade. The Hall is not going back into its ancient history to find return nominees: All of the prior nominations for all of these artists occurred since 2021.\n\t\n\n\tPink is the only artist being nominated in her first year of eligibility; her debut album, “Can’t Take Me Home,” came out in 2000.\n\n\tThis year’s list has what some might consider a recency bias, relatively speaking. All of the 10 first-time nominees having debuted on the scene in the 1980s, 1990s or, as with Pink, 2000, despite the annual cries from fans of older rock bands of the ’60s and ’70s that their favorites are still overdue. \n\n\tCollins is the only 2026 contender who already has a spot in the Rock Hall, having been inducted as a member of Genesis.\n\n\tBuckley is the rare artist getting a shot at being elected on the basis of releasing only one album in his lifetime. “Grace” came out in 1994; the singer/songwriter died in 1997.\n\n\tThose who can be counted on to complain every year that the Hall should limit itself to actual rock ‘n’ roll will have plenty to gripe about this year, although others will be grateful for the wide gamut of genres spanned. Only roughly half of the 17 nominees would be considered “rock” per se: the Crowes, Buckley, Etheridge, Idol, INXS, Iron Maiden, Joy Division/New Order and Oasis… with Collins perhaps straddling the line as a recognized superstar of pop, apart from his duties in the rock band Genesis. That leaves plenty of room in this crop for a sizable representation of pop, with Pink, Carey, and Latin-pop crossover favorite Shakira, and R&B and/or hip-hop, with Hill, New Edition, Vandross and Wu Tang in the mix.\n\n\t(Although the Hall strives to be inclusive of different contemporary genres, one wildly popular genre that is not represented among these nominees, again, is country; Dolly Parton remains the only country figure inducted in the last 23 years.)\n\n\tThe vote will take place over the next two months, with those selected by the Hall’s 1,200 voters revealed in April. At that time, further Inductees will also be named who are entering the Hall under three special committee categories: Musical Influence, Musical Excellence and the Ahmet Ertegun Non Performer Award.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHBO Max is set to bow “Song of the Samurai,” a live-action jidaigeki series rooted in one of Japan’s most enduring manga franchises, on May 9.\n\n\tThe show is drawn from “Chiruran: Shinsengumi Requiem,” the long-running manga by Umemura Shinya, whose work on “Record of Ragnarok” earned him a global following after the title was adapted into a popular anime series. “Chiruran” has sustained a devoted readership across more than a decade, with 36 collected volumes and upwards of three million copies sold. It has also spawned anime and stage adaptations over the years.\n\t\n\n\tThe production brings together three major Japanese entertainment players: broadcaster TBS, streaming service U-Next and production house The Seven, whose previous credits include “Alice in Borderland” and “Yu Yu Hakusho.” The series arrives on HBO Max through Warner Bros. Discovery’s existing content partnership with U-Next.\n\n\n\tThe drama unfolds in late-Edo period Kyoto and follows the Shinsengumi, the storied samurai corps that served as the shogunate’s last line of defense during one of Japan’s most turbulent political transitions. At its center is Hijikata Toshizo – a former street fighter played by Yamada Yuki – whose unlikely brotherhood with Kondo Isami and Okita Soji shapes the emotional core of the series. Loyalty, betrayal, illness and war all bear down on the group as the old order crumbles around them.\n\n\tRounding out the cast are Go Ayano and Nakajima Kento. Sakai Masaaki penned the scripts, Watanabe Kazutaka helms the direction, and Morii Akira, Inoue Mamoru and Shimomura Kazuya produce.\n\t\n\n\tJapanese audiences will get an early look via a two-night broadcast event on TBS TV – “Chapter: Youthful Days in Edo” – on March 26 and 27, with episodes streaming on U-Next straight after each airing. The second chapter, “Chapter: Fateful Showdown in Kyoto,” will then roll out weekly on U-Next every Friday as a streaming exclusive.\n\n\tJames Gibbons, president, Asia Pacific at Warner Bros. Discovery, said: “With a growing appetite for this genre, we hope fans enjoy this captivating new samurai story – rooted deep in Japanese culture, with passionate action and a charismatic ensemble cast.” \n\n\tU-Next president and representative director Tsutsumi Tenshin added: “This project was developed with global distribution and broadcast integration in mind, aiming to expand the reach of Japanese content. With The Seven’s production quality, TBS’s creative strength, and a world-renowned manga at its core, we are confident the series will captivate international viewers.” \n\n\tTBS Television president and representative director Masamine Ryuho said: “Set against the upheaval of the Bakumatsu era, this large-scale drama captures the spirit of young men living through one of Japan’s most transformative periods.” \n\n\tMorii, who serves as VP, CCO and chief producer at The Seven, said the team set out to reimagine the jidaigeki genre for younger audiences. “Built on an exceptional manga original, ‘Song of the Samurai’ is brought to life through the committed performances and action of Yamada Yuki and an outstanding cast, with a contemporary vision of the samurai spirit,” he said.\n\n\tYamada, who leads the series as Hijikata, added: “In mid-19th century Japan, the Shinsengumi were among the so-called last samurai warriors who upheld the way of the sword during a time of profound change. To me, the samurai spirit is the wish to protect someone; a universal feeling that is shared across borders. I hope audiences can enjoy the action, while also feeling the emotion carried within each blade.”\n\n\tLocal language subtitles and dubs will be available in select markets.\n\n\tMeanwhile, HBO Max will launch direct-to-consumer in new markets across Asia Pacific on March 26, including Bhutan, Fiji, Kiribati, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wisecrack,” an innovative true-crime podcast revolving around comedian Edd Hedges, won the top prize of podcast of the year Tuesday night in Brooklyn at the sixth annual The Ambies awards ceremony honoring excellence in audio content.\n\n\tThe iHeartPodcasts series, hosted by experienced documentary and true crime journalist Jodi Tovay, looks at the bizarre confluence of events that engulfed Hedges after he returned to his hometown to perform at a charity event. Per iHeart’s description of “Wisecrack,” “What starts as a heartwarming homecoming quickly spirals into a chilling true crime tale of a downward spiral and a town shaken by murder.” “Wisecrack” also won additional trophies for nonfiction screenwriting, society and culture podcast and for production and sound design.\n\t\n\n\tESPN veteran Pablo Torre was dubbed podcaster of the year for Meadowlark Media’s “Pablo Torre Finds Out” at the awards administered by The Podcast Academy. “Pablo Torre Finds Out” also got the nod for best sports podcast.

    "body": "\n\tIdentifying one of the hot tickets at this year’s London TV Screenings,’ “Gone,” from George Kay, creator or writer of “Hijack,” “The Long Shadow” and “Lupin,” has scored bullish pre-sales across four continents led by a BritBox deal for the U.S. and Canada. \n\n\tOther pre-sales on the upcoming psychological thriller, starring David Morrissey (“Sherwood”) and Eve Myles (“Keeping Faith”), take in both top broadcast networks and streaming services in Australia, New Zealand, Asia and Europe. \n\t\n\n\tPartners include Norwegian public broadcaster NRK, and Australian streaming service Stan. SkyNew Zealand has also licensed “Gone,” set to air on Three and stream on ThreeNow.\n\n\n\tAcross Asia, A3Media International has struck a pre-sales deal with BBC Studios’ premium SVOD drama channel, BBC First, alongside its multi-genre SVOD platform, BBC Player.\n\n\tThe six-part series will be one of the centerpiece scripted titles at All3Media International‘s London Screenings showcase on Feb. 26. \n\n\tIn “Gone,” bound for ITV and ITVX for a March bow, Morrissey plays the headmaster of an elite English private school, whose wife suddenly vanishes. Enter Detective Annie Cassidy (Myles) who views Polly as the prime suspect and “Gone” lifts off as a high-stakes cat and mouse psychological drama-thriller between the hard-charging Cassidy and Polly, who keep his own counsel. \n\n\tThat comes with his caste and class. Released mid-Feb, a trailer for “Gone” begins not with Polly but his school, which looks to date back to Tudor times, its facade sporting an elegant nineteenth century Anglo-Italianate makeover. It goes on to catch Polly addressing students in the school’s main hall, its coat of arms behind him. Cut to Polly’s country house. \n\t\n\n\tThis is a man who is the voice of the British establishment, its moral arbiter whose ethics are not to be questioned lightly. Enter Myles Cassidy, caught in the trailer in a slightly larger than normal first close-up, who stares at Polly across a police interrogation room table with an air of not very dissimulated disbelief.\n\n\tThis is a “story about privilege and prejudice,” Kay said when “Gone” was announced. “The truth is tantalisingly close. Or at least, that’s what Annie thinks,” he teased. Kay’s Observatory Pictures, backed by All3Media, produces with New Pictures, in association with All3Media International.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Gone’   Eve Myles as Annie, David Morrissey as Michael   Copyright New Pictures, All3Media International\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGone Eve Myles as Annie, David Morrissey as Michael Copyright New Pictures, All3Media International\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Blending psychological mystery with a claustrophobic thriller and layered character drama, George Kay’s latest series has resonated strongly with international buyers as is evident through this impressive line-up of premium partners at pre-sale stage, including BritBox,” said Jennifer Askin, EVP Americas at All3Media International. \n\n\t“With its atmospheric setting, a stellar cast led by David Morrissey and Eve Myles and a tightly constructed cat-and-mouse narrative, “Gone” delivers sustained tension and broad audience appeal,” she added. “We look forward to unveiling further details to buyers at our upcoming upfronts event this week.”\n\n\t“Beyond the central mystery, ‘Gone’ digs into themes of trauma, trust and the long shadow cast by elite institutions, giving the drama a deeper emotional and social edge alongside its thriller elements,” All3Media International noted in a press statement on Wednesday. \n\n\tWritten and created by Kay, “Gone” is directed by BAFTA-winning Richard Laxton (“Mrs Wilson,” “The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe”). Cast also takes in Jennifer Macbeth, Arthur Hughes, Nicholas Nunn, Elliot Cowan, Billy Barratt, Rupert Evans, Jodie McNee, Oscar Batterham and Clare Higgins.\n\n\t“Gone” is produced by Mark Hedges (“Hanna,” “The Rising”). Kay, Laxton, Willow Grylls (“Des,” “The Missing”) and Matt Sandford (“The Long Shadow”) serve as executive producers.\n\t\n\n\t“Gone” is fiction, A3Media Intl. stresses It is partly inspired, however, by the book “To Hunt a Killer” and the real-world work of former Detective Superintendent Julie Mackay and ITV Crime Correspondent Robert Murphy, both of whom worked as consultants on the show.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Project Hail Mary” has been unveiled to members of the film press ahead of its March 20 release, and first reactions are calling Phil Lord and Christopher Miller’s sci-fi comedy a “must-see space odyssey” that may prove to be a “major awards player” come Oscar time next year.\n\n\tFilm critic Eric Marchen shared a glowing review on X, writing that “Project Hail Mary” is “the first great blockbuster of 2026.” \n\n\n\t“Phil Lord and Christopher Miller’s must-see space odyssey blasts off as the first great blockbuster of 2026,” Marchen wrote. “Out-of-this-world cinematography from Greig Fraser reaches for the stars while anchored by a stellar Ryan Gosling performance. This movie ROCKS!”\n\t\n\n\tCritic Adriano Caporusso also praised the film on X. He wrote, “Lord & Miller’s latest plays up a ‘Short Circuit’ bromance to an hysterical extreme while simultaneously delivering a pulse-pounding space epic that brings true humanity to the centrestage, but not without some jaw-dropping visuals alongside.”\n\n\tGlobe and Mail film writer Barry Hertz shared some reservations about the “Project Hail Mary” on X, but they weren’t enough to outshine Ryan Gosling’s “galaxy-sized charms.”\n\n\t“Not quite faster-than-light script with too many endings and one crucial plot point that evaporates, plus a seeming corporate obligation to Amazon’s ROCKY catalogue, cannot suppress the galaxy-sized charms of Ryan Gosling,” he wrote. “‘INTERSTELLAR’ without all the ~stuff~.”\n\n\tEntertainment journalist Scott Menzel called “Project Hail Mary” a “masterpiece” on X and predicted it will be “a major awards player across the board.”\n\t\n\n\t“‘Project Hail Mary’ is an epic cinematic achievement,” Menzel wrote. “Phil Lord and Chris Miller somehow manage to raise the bar once again, delivering what is not only their most ambitious film to date, but arguably their most accomplished.”\n\n\tTV host Jeff Conway echoed the praise, writing on X, “A successfully sophisticated blend of humor, sci-fi, drama and suspense. Ryan Gosling is the shining star of this compassionate story about connection and defying the odds, while Sandra Hüller is the tender heart of this beautiful film.”\n\n\tBased on the 2021 novel by Andy Weir, the film stars Gosling as brainy school teacher Ryland Grace, who wakes up alone on a spaceship light-years away from Earth with no recollection of how he got there. As his memory recovers, he pieces together an outlandish plot that sent him through the galaxy to stop a mysterious entity from blacking out the sun. Other cast members include Sandra Hüller, Milana Vayntrub, Ken Leung, Liz Kingsman and James Ortiz.\n\n\tAt Comic Con 2025, Gosling unveiled the first five minutes of “Project Hail Mary” alongside Miller, Lord and screenwriter Drew Goddard. Gosling said at the time that he related to Ryland’s situation of being an “ordinary person in an extraordinary situation.”\n\n\t“I connected to his reluctance,” he said. “Aside from the fact he has a doctorate in molecular biology, he’s an ordinary person in an extraordinary situation. He reacts to a lot of things the way I might or a lot of us might. He’s terrified appropriately of the task at hand. He’s somebody who gave up on himself on Earth, and he’s given an opportunity to believe in himself again. It’s inspiring to go through this journey with him because he somehow finds the courage to put one foot in front of the other and keep going.”\n\n\tCheck out more reactions below. \n\n#ProjectHailMary is perfect. Imagination unleashed even better than I pictured it on the page. How Gosling captivates throughout a largely one-man show is beyond me – your earliest Best Actor contender. & my sweet prince Rocky… tears flowed all third act. What a beautiful… pic.twitter.com/THQapWJYJ1— Liam (@LiamTCrowley) February 25, 2026\n\n\n\n#ProjectHailMary absolutely floored me. Lord and Miller deliver a space odyssey that is deeply human and heartwarming. Ryan Gosling is fantastic here and brings emotion and charm to this SciFi epic. Incredible visuals and a pulsing score. You wanna see this one in @IMAX. pic.twitter.com/C4jR86eZNe— Kevin Verma (@KevOnFilm) February 25, 2026\n\n\n\n#ProjectHailMary is pure joy. Hilarious, heartfelt, hugely moving, wildly exciting and absolutely beautiful. The 160 minutes go by in an instant as Lord and Miller keep Weir’s narrative moving like a rocket ship. Gosling is better than ever and the Rocky effect and mind blowing. pic.twitter.com/OLi6HR3Zxt— Germain Lussier (@GermainLussier) February 25, 2026\n\n\nPhil Lord and Chris Miller’s #ProjectHailMary is the iconic duo’s finest hour. Their “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial”: a family-friendly, high-concept crowd-pleaser with real blockbuster upside. Ryan Gosling and Sandra Hüller are out of this world, owning every frame. Adored! pic.twitter.com/nTHEGFRyKg— Clayton Davis (@ByClaytonDavis) February 25, 2026\n\n",

Those on the list come from a host of different countries, including Indonesia, Nigeria and Kazakhstan; range in followers, from 12 million to 50,000; and represent all the possibilities that TikTok provides. To select the final nominees, TikTok’s global team evaluated which creators have been making the most significant impact on the platform in the past six months, measuring this by evaluating video creations, views, account growth, likes, comments, interactions with followers and content that has sparked global conversations.\n\n\tRead on to meet all 50 creators and discover their passions — you might just find your new TikTok obsession. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAndrea Novita, @andreanovitaa (Tangerang, Indonesia)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tEDUCATOR\n\n\tAndrea Novita is a science-based content creator from Indonesia. She demystifies food science, microbiology, and evidence-based science communication through educational videos, research-driven insights and hands-on experiments in her small personal laboratory. Andrea often creates innovative food products using a variety of unique ingredients. Through clear, engaging storytelling, she makes complex science more accessible to everyone.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tCreating on TikTok allows me to spread food science education rooted in what I learned during my food technology studies, and turn it into something accessible. Being recognized as an Educator on the Discover List makes me genuinely happy, because my content is built around doing real experiments in my own lab with the intention to educate… It motivates me to keep translating complex science into content that sparks curiosity and understanding.\n\t\n\t\tWhat is something you’ve learned or taught because of TikTok? \t\n\n\tTikTok has taught me how powerful short-form content can be for education. Seeing how much people engage and learn reminds me that there’s a huge opportunity to introduce lesser-known science topics to my audience.\n\t\n\t\tDescribe yourself in three words.\t\n\n\tCreative, passionate, curious.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJacklynn Botwe, @byjacklynn (London, England)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tEDUCATOR\n\n\tJacklynn is a travel storyteller and history enthusiast who blends her love for culture and history into immersive experiences. With a deep appreciation for ancient architecture, museums and the hidden gems of every destination, she brings the richness of the past into the present. Her goal is to make her audience feel like they’re right there with her — walking cobblestone streets, standing before centuries-old masterpieces and discovering new corners of the world. Through her lens and words, Jacklynn invites others to not only observe the adventure but to feel part of it.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tI began my TikTok at the beginning of 2025, never imagining that I would gain such an incredible, wholesome community. I’m now lucky enough for this to be my full-time job! From TikTok, I was inspired to start my Muse Meetups group and community, and was able to spend time in the arts and history scene with wonderful like-minded individuals. I want my content to be an educational escape for my community and a safe space where they can nerd out over history, so for my page to be recognized among countless others means I’m succeeding!\n\t\n\t\tWhat is something you’ve learned or taught because of TikTok? \t\n\n\tI have learned a lot more about British history through my time researching and sharing on my account.\n\t\n\t\tDescribe yourself in three words.\t\n\n\t Whimsical, daydreamer, empath.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOlawale Ogunlana, @doctorwalesmd (Lagos, Nigeria)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tEDUCATOR\n\n\tDr. Olawale Ogunlana (Dr. Wales) is a medical doctor dedicated to fighting health misinformation. He combines clinical expertise with engaging pop-culture storytelling, making complex medical concepts accessible to millions across the continent. Through initiatives such as HealthKraft Africa and the 100KClub Foundation, he is redefining health communication for over 1 billion Africans, advocating for the elimination of health poverty and the welfare of frontline healthcare workers.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tTo be recognized as an Educator is a profound validation not just of my work, but of the critical importance of health conversations on TikTok. For a long time, health was seen as a topic for clinics and classrooms, but this nomination proves that it belongs on the For You page, sparking curiosity and changing lives. Millions of Africans are becoming more learned, empowered and capable of making better health decisions because of the content we create. TikTok transformed me from a clinician at a local hospital into a global health leader and advocate recognized by institutions like the World Health Organization. It gave me the proof of concept I needed: the future of medicine isn’t just in the clinic, it’s on our screens.\n\t\n\t\tWhat is something you’ve learned or taught because of TikTok? \t\n\n\tA lot of people come to TikTok seeking health advice, particularly vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, and this is the reason the core of my content has been focused on maternal health.

Understanding the science of your happiness helps you to reclaim your joy. TikTok has allowed my research and work to reach millions internationally and has led to opening doors to prestigious institutions… My community is so curious about learning about mental health and the science of happiness that it inspires me to create evidence-based content that may impact the access to care that my community seeks offline, in the real world.\n\t\n\t\tWhat is something you’ve learned or taught because of TikTok? \t\n\n\tI started to educate my community about the first peer-reviewed study in the world on High Functioning Depression (HFD), published by my lab.

I am deeply grateful to the world of literature and the TikTok platform; I wouldn’t be where I am today without them.

It’s meaningful to see that my slower, more thoughtful style is resonating. TikTok has given me a wonderful outlet to share the things I find most interesting and awe-inspiring in life, in a style and manner that I feel is representative of who I am as a person. It has also allowed me to collaborate with some of the world’s most incredible natural history museums and engage directly with some of the rarest and most remarkable treasures on Earth.

I see education as more than sharing information — it’s about empowering people to ask questions, think critically and feel capable of creating change, no matter how small. Creating on TikTok has significantly impacted my life. It’s allowed me to extend my work as an educator beyond the classroom and grow a connected community of curious minds. Creating on the platform has refined how I communicate complex ideas and opened opportunities to collaborate, advocate and lead conversations around science, education and environmental responsibility.

This nomination also feels so reassuring that I’m doing something right and inspiring that I get to be in this list with so many other amazing creators. TikTok definitely changed my life. I was working as an assistant stylist and assistant producer for magazines when I first started. And every day, I wished I could wear the clothes I was prepping for the models — and TikTok allowed me to do that! It allowed me to access fashion in such close proximity, to be my own boss, to meet so many people.

I started sharing online simply to document my own journey and connect with people who felt the same way I did, never with the intention of being seen as an “icon.” To me, this nomination represents the power of showing up as yourself, even when you’re still figuring things out. It’s a reminder that vulnerability, consistency and staying true to your values can resonate far beyond what you could ever expect. I’m deeply grateful, and I see this as a reflection of the community that has grown with me and supported me every step of the way.

He’s an artist if you ask him, and a really nice guy if you ask his grandmother. He began his artistic journey in Naples, performing for years in a regional theater company before moving between Los Angeles and London to complete his acting studies and appear in early television roles. It was there he discovered his true purpose: telling stories about people, through people. Today, he translates this vision into original social formats — blending surreal humor, imaginary scenarios and observational comedy — and into his podcast “Matto mica Scemo,” where he explores the world by slightly bending reality.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tBeing nominated as an Icon on the Discover List makes me realize that something born as a very personal, almost instinctive way of observing people has become part of a shared language. I’ve always used TikTok as a space to experiment, to follow curiosity, and to turn everyday situations into stories that feel slightly surreal but deeply human. Being recognized as an Icon tells me this approach resonates not only within me but within all of us. And that’s the iconic part. Creating on TikTok trained me to stay curious. Everyday moments, silences, awkward interactions, things that would normally pass unnoticed suddenly became material, stories, points of view… On a personal level, it gave me a direct relationship with an audience, without filters or intermediaries, and that’s been both grounding and surprising.\n\t\n\t\tWho is an icon you look up to? \t\n\n\tEveryday people.\n\t\n\t\tDescribe yourself in three words. \t\n\n\tMatto, crazy, loco.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOlly Bowman, @mrmelk_ (London, England)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tICON\n\n\tOlly Bowman is an Aussie lifestyle creator, personality and presenter who encourages his followers to think deeply and live joyfully by documenting his life in London.

Whether he is discussing sober living, health and fitness, or his positive psychology, Olly encourages his followers to live freer, happier lives. In hard times or good ones, a voice like Olly’s is a precious thing.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tI always knew I was an icon (joking), but genuinely, it means a lot to be nominated for this list, especially knowing it comes from doing what I love. I’ve always tried to create content that feels real and brings people together, and despite all my silliness, having tangible recognition like this is incredibly meaningful. I’m feeling very grateful to everyone who’s watched, supported and been part of my awesome community. It’s put me in a position to just live my life, have fun, film it and get to call it work.

I think my story is really representative of what makes this app a revolutionary tool. You can step into a career you never thought possible as an artist on this platform. I’m really grateful for that. I was working in a call center and as a receptionist when I made my first TikTok… I’m now able to not only create online, but I’m a writer and actor in other projects, and have been able to move into television and film.

TikTok gives me the freedom to experiment, share my creative process, and transform cultural heritage into contemporary visual language that resonates worldwide. Thanks to TikTok, I found my first followers and supporters — it was the platform where my journey as a creator truly began.

Her community is a safe space where diversity becomes a strength and is valued.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tFor me, being named an Innovator means that TikTok and its community see and validate my effort to create a new language around disability, shifting the narrative from passive to active. No longer are stories told about us, but stories are told by us, with awareness, irony and power. Innovation for me is turning lived experience into action, choice and presence, using creativity to challenge old frameworks and perceptions. When the point of view changes, the story changes, and so does culture. TikTok has changed my life by giving me a space to turn my experience into an active voice and to raise awareness about rights. It has allowed me to speak up after many times when my voice was silenced, and it has made me feel stronger and more confident in who I am. Through TikTok, I’ve met many people, taken part in meaningful events, and built a community online and offline rooted in authenticity, inclusion and empowerment.

It has been key to my personal and professional growth, allowing me to achieve things I never imagined, such as becoming the first Peruvian woman to be nominated for the TikTok Awards and representing Spanish-speaking creators at APEC.\n\t\n\t\tWhat or who inspires you? \t\n\n\tI am inspired by those pioneers who not only invent but also transform what already exists, leaving behind a world of possibilities.

When I started creating fragrance content, there wasn’t much out there for men who wanted to learn without feeling overwhelmed or judged. I saw a gap and decided to fill it. This nomination tells me that TikTok sees what I’ve been building: a space where men can discover something as personal as how they smell without pretension. It’s validation that education can be just as powerful as entertainment. TikTok changed my life completely. What started as a passion for fragrance turned into a full content business with brand partnerships, PR relationships with major fragrance houses and a community of over half a million people who trust my recommendations. I’m a university student who built something real while still in school. TikTok gave me the platform to turn expertise into opportunity.\n\t\n\t\tWhat or who inspires you? \t\n\n\tMy audience.

She has since collaborated with major brands like TIRTIR and Parnell, working to expand their shade ranges to be more inclusive for worldwide consumers.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tInnovation, to me, isn’t about being the most polished; it’s about doing something differently and opening doors that didn’t exist before. I’ve always approached beauty from a perspective that wasn’t widely represented, especially within K-beauty, and this nomination feels like recognition of that impact… There’s value in trusting your instincts and carving your own lane. TikTok gave me a platform to build a career doing something I genuinely love, but more importantly, it gave me a voice. I’ve been able to turn my personality, humor and lived experience into a real business, travel the world, work with brands I once admired from afar and connect with people who see themselves in me.\n\t\n\t\tWhat or who inspires you? \t\n\n\tWomen who are unapologetically themselves and build power on their own terms, especially creators and founders who don’t fit into a traditional mold but still make space for others. Most of all, I’m inspired by the idea that representation can be joyful, fun and impactful all at once.\n\t\n\t\tDescribe yourself in three words.\t\n\n\tAuthentic, funny, unapologetic.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAamir Dassat, @sixspeed.official (Texas, United States)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tINNOVATOR\n\n\tAamir is an automotive content creator and car collector who shares the journey of owning, restoring and driving classic vehicles on TikTok. He began posting content in 2020 while studying for a mechanical engineering degree and eventually transitioned to full-time content creation. On his page, you’ll find tons of automotive DIYs, reviews of new and old cars, cinematic edits and even the occasional tech video. Whether you just want to learn the basics about cars, save money by working on your daily driver, or go all out and restore your own project car, there’s a video for just about everyone.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tWorking on cars can seem confusing, but I aim to present concepts and DIYs in the simplest way possible — often scripting and rewording for hours on end. Getting recognized as an Innovator means all the focus on details hasn’t gone unnoticed. In my junior year of mechanical engineering, on a whim, I decided to download TikTok and post my first video — a simple 15-second clip showing my old Mitsubishi with a trending audio. I quickly noticed an opportunity not only to showcase the cars but also to teach about them. Fast forward a few years, I graduated from college, transitioned to full-time content creation, have been able to work with a ton of dream automotive companies and met a majority of my closest friends — all through TikTok.\n\t\n\t\tWhat or who inspires you?\t\n\n\tMy mom, my colleagues and friends who are always pushing the boundaries of content creation. Anyone who pursues their passion, whether it’s a hobby or a job.\n\t\n\t\tDescribe yourself in three words.\t\n\n\tCreative, methodical, easy-going.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThomas Duke, @steppingthroughfilm (London, England)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tINNOVATOR\n\n\tThomas Duke is a creator from London who lives and breathes the world of film and TV. Being inspired by the screen since he was 5 years old, it’s been a dream for Thomas to share his passion with his acting and directing inspirations through film junkets and set visits, connecting with them through his love for the arts on TikTok and digging deep into what makes cinema so special for us all. His trusted little film journal — which he’s kept going for 16 years now — comes in handy to help conjure up nostalgic conversations about the magic of the movies and its presence in our lives.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tAs a lover of all things creative, it’s a true pleasure to be nominated on this list. It’s been a surreal journey sharing my love for film online, and a journey I never thought would get me here. The magic of film inspires me every single day. It has allowed me to reach audiences all over the world in such a beautiful, personal way. It’s given me a voice that would possibly never have reached who it has if I hadn’t started posting videos.\n\t\n\t\tWhat or who inspires you? \t\n\n\tMy mum got me to this point in so many ways; she inspires me every day and makes me want to carry on. Second to that, multiple people from the screen — in front of and behind the camera — who have such a drive to create their vision for us to enjoy for decades to come. And I’d have to say, the idea of never knowing what the future holds… and waking up every day knowing you can make a difference in the world. Keep going.\n\t\n\t\tDescribe yourself in three words.\t\n\n\tPassionate, intentful, creative.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tXixi Liu & Allen Fu, @cheekyglo (Sydney, Australia)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tORIGINATOR\n\n\tXixi Liu and Allen Fu are the co-founders of CheekyGlo, an Australian skin and haircare brand. Xixi is a creator and entrepreneur who shares her exciting journey as a bootstrapped beauty founder. She brings hands-on industry experience and passion to building CheekyGlo. Inspired by her own skin insecurities, she co-founded the brand with a desire to help others feel seen, confident and comfortable in their skin. Allen is a seasoned entrepreneur and operator focused on building and scaling his ventures. With a background spanning science, consulting and sales, he brings a practical, evidence-informed approach to growing CheekyGlo. He is committed to inclusive self-care, with a focus on creating accessible skincare solutions for men who want to take better care of their skin.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tAs early adopters of TikTok in Australia, we quickly built our own personal brands alongside using the platform to launch CheekyGlo. It’s a great honor to be recognized for the impact we’ve made and the community we’ve built. Our product first sold out in 48 hours after we posted it on TikTok, and since then, the platform has given us the opportunity to share our brand with the world. We’ve used it as a foundation to create businesses that educate, entertain and positively impact people. The platform has also enabled us to hire dozens of people, move into a warehouse we once only imagined, support our families and access opportunities that simply didn’t exist before. Watching it grow beyond our expectations has been incredibly rewarding.\n\t\n\t\tWho is an entrepreneur, brand, or business that you look up to? \t\n\n\tAllen: Alex Hormozi.\n\t\n\t\tDescribe yourself in three words. \t\n\n\tXixi: Passionate, honest, real.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCherie Kihato, @cheriekihato (Nairobi, Kenya)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tORIGINATOR\n\n\tCherie is a creative entrepreneur and founder of Savannah Space, a Kenyan design studio and showroom showcasing heritage through furniture, art and interiors. Her platform inspires a global audience of design lovers, makers and aspiring creatives by documenting her journey and sharing tools that make creative business work possible. She also shares lifestyle and fashion content with a focus on African artistry.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tIt means that my message that Africans and African brands should be highlighted and respected is being noticed. This is such an honor, as it’s so important for us as Africans to showcase what incredible things are coming out of our continent. Being nominated as an Originator proves to me that the risk I took in sharing my journey of building an African brand is resonating with so many people. I’m incredibly proud of that. Creating on TikTok has played a huge role in my confidence journey. It pushed me far outside my comfort zone. It’s opened up so many unexpected opportunities, but more than that, it’s allowed me to build a really special community of people who genuinely support me and are rooting for the growth and success of my brand.\n\t\n\t\tWho is an entrepreneur, brand, or business that you look up to? \t\n\n\tTracee Ellis Ross is an entrepreneur — and person in general — who I gain so much inspiration from. She is authentically herself and is building an incredible brand by being so. Also, Hermès! They have shown that it is possible to be an artisanal, heritage-focused brand with a global presence.\n\t\n\t\tDescribe yourself in three words.\t\n\n\tChild of God, storyteller, learner.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tElyse Burns, @elysebreannedesign (North Carolina)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tORIGINATOR\n\n\tElyse Breanne is an artist and small business owner who grew her side-hustle Etsy shop into a multimillion-dollar business while attending law school by sharing her small business journey on TikTok. She graduated from Duke Law in 2022 and took her business full-time, opening a storefront a few months later, and started growing her team. Now, she has a team of 16 full-time employees, a 14,000-square-foot warehouse and over $15 million in all-time revenue. She continues to create new art, develop new products and document every success and challenge she faces as a small-business owner through her content on TikTok.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tI am honored to be nominated as an Originator. TikTok has been integral to the success of my business, and as someone with no background in art or business, being able to share my journey and learn from others through TikTok has been indispensable. I owe a lot to TikTok, and it is exciting to be nominated as someone who is also contributing to this community. TikTok has completely reshaped my life and career in extremely tangible ways. Without TikTok helping expand my business 18x in 2020, I would currently be a lawyer and probably living in another state. Instead, I have gotten to pursue my dream career as an artist and business owner, open a stationery storefront in my community and create 16 full-time jobs as well.\n\t\n\t\tWho is an entrepreneur, brand, or business that you look up to? \t\n\n\tSimplified by Emily Ley.\n\t\n\t\tDescribe yourself in three words.\t\n\n\tCreative, fun-loving, practical.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGhina Eroz, @gweroz (Jakarta, Indonesia)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tORIGINATOR\n\n\tGhina Eroz is a dreamer from Indonesia who has become many of the things she loves — a creator, a storyteller, an inspiration and an entrepreneur. She built her business around her passion: telling stories that inspire. “GEROZ” is her brand name, but also her nickname. She started making innovative foods at the end of 2024, selling them creatively through TikTok. Now, as she builds her business, she is on a new mission: to travel the world and tell stories to inspire people even more.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tI built my business, and now I sell my innovative products in my own fun and creative way that catches people’s attention and also interests them in buying my products. Being nominated as an Originator means that, as far as my business goes, I have succeeded in creating an impact in a unique way — in MY way. With TikTok, I have achieved a lot of the things that I want to be and do, my voice is being heard and my stories matter. TikTok has changed how I see opportunities and values around me. Without TikTok, my ideas and business wouldn’t have come to life as they are now.\n\t\n\t\tWho is an entrepreneur, brand, or business that you look up to? \t\n\n\tMy mom and my family. I come from an entrepreneurial family, and everyone in my family has created a small business in our lives to hopefully make a living from.\n\t\n\t\tDescribe yourself in three words.\t\n\n\tDreamer, persevering, joyful.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDominique Bogle, @hairanatomyuk (Birmingham, England)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tORIGINATOR\n\n\tDom is the founder of Hair Anatomy U.K., a fast-growing hair brand known for making synthetic wigs and wig care feel easy, premium,and confidence-boosting. She scaled the business from a small start-up into a multi–six-figure brand through TikTok Shop, building a loyal community by teaching real, practical wig tips.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tBeing nominated as an Originator on the Discover List is a significant honor and a meaningful recognition of the work I’ve put into building a trusted brand and community through TikTok Live. TikTok became the platform that allowed me to scale quickly by turning product education and demonstration into a direct sales channel through TikTok Shop and TikTok Live, and it ultimately gave me the confidence and momentum to leave my banking career and pursue entrepreneurship full-time. Beyond revenue, TikTok helped me build a highly engaged community and a strong brand presence by enabling real-time interaction, trust-building and feedback that have directly shaped my product development and customer experience. It has also expanded my professional opportunities from partnerships and collaborations to increased visibility and credibility, and ultimately changed what I believed was possible for a small business to achieve.\n\t\n\t\tWho is an entrepreneur, brand, or business that you look up to? \t\n\n\tI look up to P. Louise and Made by Mitchell — both have built standout brands by combining bold product innovation with strong storytelling and community-led marketing. They’ve shown how consistency, personality and direct-to-consumer focus can turn a beauty brand into a movement, not just a product line.\n\t\n\t\tDescribe yourself in three words.\t\n\n\tStrategic, entrepreneurial, customer-focused.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJeffrey Morrison, @morrisonmade (Kentucky, United States)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tORIGINATOR\n\n\tMorrisonMade is a small family business in Northern Kentucky. The company was founded in 2019 and is dedicated to producing the highest quality leather goods in the United States. Each product is handcrafted by a husband-and-wife team with the highest attention to detail.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tIt is always an honor to take part in these kinds of things for a company and an app that has had such an amazing impact on my life and my family’s life. It has set my life on a trajectory I never thought possible with the opportunities it has brought our business.\n\t\n\t\tWho is an entrepreneur, brand, or business that you look up to? \t\n\n\tTrayvax.\n\t\n\t\tDescribe yourself in three words.\t\n\n\tAll about family.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCarmen Fiorito, @newmartina (Naples, Italy)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tORIGINATOR\n\n\tCarmen Fiorito started sharing her work in her father’s phone shop on TikTok, and in a short time, the videos in which she changed protective films on smartphones with an unusual and engaging style went viral (one of them reached over 470 million views). Thanks to her success on TikTok, she helped her family expand their business, hire staff and open new shops in different Italian cities. New Martina has now become a leading brand in electronic device protection, recognized for its high-quality products and attentive, efficient customer service. Trusted by celebrities from film, television, sports, music and mostly normal people, New Martina has become a beloved brand with over 10 million followers on TikTok, a loyal global community, drawn to its innovation, attention to detail and unwavering customer service.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tI am so proud and honored to be nominated as an Originator! TikTok was the platform where everything started for me in 2023, and even today, it continues to give me so much satisfaction as I grow my company even more. TikTok has made my company what it is today, changing my company for the better, allowing me to reach millions of people and, above all, to open many stores throughout Italy.\n\t\n\t\tWho is an entrepreneur, brand, or business that you look up to? \t\n\n\tMy favorite brand is Apple, along with Steve Jobs. I absolutely love their way of communicating and marketing, as well as their consistently innovative and original products.\n\t\n\t\tDescribe yourself in three words.\t\n\n\tCourageous, ambitious, stubborn.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNing Cheah, @thebeautycrop (London, England)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TiikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tORIGINATOR\n\n\tNing is the founder and CEO of The Beauty Crop, a clean beauty brand that has become known for its high-performing, plant-based products that don’t compromise on fun, affordability or ethics. With a background in chemical engineering and a high-powered career in investment banking, Ning’s personal struggle with eczema and cystic acne led her to launch The Beauty Crop in 2014. Since launching, it has become a cult favorite, stocked in major retailers like Boots, Beauty Bay, ASOS and Look Fantastic.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tAs the founder of The Beauty Crop, it’s proof that showing up consistently, building in public and growing with our community actually matters. We didn’t just follow trends — we helped create them through TikTok Live, real conversations and products shaped by our audience. This nomination is a reminder that small brands can lead culture, not chase it — and I am so proud of what we’ve built together. TikTok’s transformed how I’ve built The Beauty Crop — from how products are launched to how customers discover and connect with us. TikTok Live allowed me to build the brand in real time, have honest conversations with our community and turn feedback straight into product innovation. TikTok gave me a platform to show the real side of being a founder — the wins, the setbacks, the unfiltered moments — and that transparency is what’s built trust. Most importantly, TikTok proved that you don’t need a huge budget to build something meaningful — you need consistency, authenticity and the courage to show up.\n\t\n\t\tWho is an icon you look up to? \t\n\n\tSara Blakely of Spanx.\n\t\n\t\tDescribe yourself in three words. \t\n\n\tResilient, mission-driven, unfiltered.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTamia Nontsikelelo, @tolthema (Johannesburg, South Africa)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tORIGINATOR\n\n\tTamia Nontsikelelo is a creator from South Africa who uses storytelling and marketing on TikTok to create powerful, engaged communities.

She now uses her platform to share her entrepreneurship journey, insights and practical lessons with other creators and entrepreneurs.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does it mean to be recognized on the Discover List?\t\n\n\tBeing nominated as an Originator on the Discover List is a powerful affirmation of the work I’ve done to build more than just a business on TikTok. It represents the impact of creating products, stories and conversations that resonate deeply with people and turn viewers into a genuine community. TikTok has completely transformed my life and career. It quite literally blew up my small business and became the single most effective marketing tool I have ever used. Because of the exposure and support from TikTok, I was able to scale my brand, create jobs and build a real team. It has not only transformed my business but also changed my personal life by opening doors, creating opportunities and allowing me to step fully into my purpose as an entrepreneur.\n\t\n\t\tWho is an entrepreneur, brand, or business that you look up to? \t\n\n\tDaniel Priestley.\n\t\n\t\tDescribe yourself in three words.\t\n\n\tUnwavering, visionary, intentional.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJane Hastings, @toystoystoys.uk (Liverpool, England)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: TikTok/Angella Choe @angellachoe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tORIGINATOR\n\n\tJane Hastings is an independent toy retailer based in Liverpool who loves toys and supporting her local community.

Addi's father, Bradley Smith, called the cops to check on his 11-year-old daughter and ex-wife, Tawnia McGeehan, at the Rio Hotel & Casino February 15 after he hadn't heard from Addi in a while.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Once arriving at the scene, officers initially knocked on the door of the hotel room and called into the room several times without success. When they called Bradley back to see if he thought Addi could be in danger, Bradley told them he didn't believe that was the case and that she \"should be safe with her mom,\" according to the report.\n      \n\n          Then, police say officers left ... but hotel security continued their search. After friends and coaches alerted security that Tawnia and Addi never showed up for the cheerleading competition they were in town for, security made entry into their room and discovered their bodies lying lifeless on the bed.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          As we reported ... police believe Tawnia shot Addi late Saturday, February 14, while they were in Vegas for a cheerleading competition, with what appeared to be a suicide note left behind.\n      \n    \n          Tawnia and Bradley were awarded joint legal and physical custody of Addi with one week on and one week off in 2024 after a lengthy custody battle.\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

A judge sentenced her to 20 years in federal prison.\n      \n    \n          The inmate -- who only spoke on the condition of anonymity while still in Bureau of Prisons custody -- tells us Maxwell \"has horrible personal hygiene\" and \"would shower once or twice a week,\" despite prisoners having regular access to the shower facilities.  \n      \n\n          The inmate said Maxwell \"always had BO\" because she would work out all the time and rarely wash herself afterwards. Maxwell always jogged around the recreation yard or walked briskly around the compound to get where she was going, according to the inmate.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    MEGA\n          \n    \n          Last July, TMZ published paparazzi photos of Maxwell, along with a video of her breaking a sweat as she went for a run on prison grounds.\n      \n    \n          And get this ... the inmate said Maxwell's reputation also reeked ... her fellow prisoners categorized her as a \"Chomo\" (child molester) -- because of her conviction charges -- and offered her little respect.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          But, the inmate insists, Maxwell was never assaulted at FCI Tallahassee because no one wanted to get sent to the Special Housing Unit -- better known as \"the hole\" -- which is \"very hard living.\"\n      \n    \n          The inmate said \"the hole\" acted as a deterrent to others thinking of assaulting Maxwell because you're confined 24 hours a day to your cell with cold food for months. She noted, \"It's just not worth it.\"\n      \n    \n          In August 2025, Maxwell was sent to the Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, to serve out the rest of her sentence after her meetings with Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche regarding the Epstein case.\n      \n    \n                    \n                          \n                                  \n      \n        \n    \n          Blanche conducted two days of interviews with Maxwell about Epstein's network of high-profile associates ... namely President Trump. Maxwell denied Trump had committed any crimes with Epstein.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to Maxwell's attorneys for comment ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      ",

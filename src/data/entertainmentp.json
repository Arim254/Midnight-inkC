    "body": "\n\t“Friday Night Lights” is coming back to Texas. At the 2026 ATX TV Festival, the cast will get back together to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the hit drama. \n\n\tConfirmed participants include Kyle Chandler, Connie Britton, Adrianne Palicki, showrunner and executive producer Jason Katims, executive producer and writer David Hudgins, executive producer and director Jeffrey Reiner, co-executive producer and writer Liz Heldens, and consulting producer and writer Kerry Ehrin. In 2016, the cast reunited at the festival for the first time to celebrate 10 years since the October 2006 premiere.\n\t\n\n\tThe show will also receive the 2026 “Texas Made” Award presented with Media for Texas, celebrating “productions and talent that have created opportunities for TV & film professionals within the state.”\n\n\n\t“There is nothing we’re more passionate about than celebrating great television within our community. When setting out to program our 15th Season, we are starting with a show that has not only become part of the story of the festival, but has left an indelible mark on television itself,” says ATX TV co-president and co-founder Caitlin McFarland. “There was no question which series most embodies both sentiments – ‘Friday Night Lights’ has been at the heart of ATX TV Festival since year one, and honoring FNL’s 20th Anniversary with our Texas Made award couldn’t be a more perfect fit. This series serves as a beacon to what great production in our state can look like, and as Texas sets out to grow film and TV production through the newly passed historic film and TV incentives, there is no better time to honor this series with some of the greatest cast and creatives we know.”\n\t\n\n\tOn Wednesday, ATX TV also announced a “Homicide: Life on the Street Retrospective” featuring screening and conversation with Tom Fontana, David Simon, and Kyle Secor; a 10-year anniversary panel for “Sweet/Vicious” with the cast and producers; and “Inside Job: TV’s Non-Writing Producers,” a look at the jobs of non-writing producers, featuring Melissa Bernstein (“House of the Dragon”), Stacey Sher (“Mrs. America”), Sarah Timberman (“Justified: City Primeval”), Kathleen McCaffrey (“Industry”) and Karen Wacker (“Lanterns”).\n\n\tAdditionally, “A Late Night Show with Greg Iwinski” will return for a second, original episode performed live in front of the audience, alongside announcer Jim Fagan and the Late Night Invisible Orchestra.\n\n\tATX TV has expanded its competition opportunities by adding the “Indie TV Pilot Competition & Showcase,” now accepting submissions. \n\n\tATX TV Festival Season 15 will take place in Austin, Texas, from May 28-31. Badges are available now.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLondon is set to become the next destination in the “Cities of Love” franchise of anthology features, following romantic stops over the last two decades in Paris, New York, Rio and Berlin. \n\n\t“London, I Love You,” which will reportedly start production in April 2026, will follow its predecessors’ leads, interweaving a collection of romantic stories against the backdrop of the vibrant British capital. \n\n\n\tA series of well-known U.K. directors have already been lined up to take part, including Simon Curtis (“My Weekend with Marlyn,” “Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale”), Gurinder Chadha (“Bend it Like Beckham,” “Blinded by the Light”), Amma Asante (“Belle,” “Mrs.America”), Shane Meadows (“This is England,” “Dead Man’s Shoes”), Anand Tucker (“The Critic,” “Shopgirl”), Neil Marshall (“The Descent,” “Centurion”) and Rufus Norris (“Broken,” “London Road”).\n\t\n\n\tFurther directors are currently in negotiations (the last instalment, 2019’s “Berlin, I Love You,” featured shorts from 11 filmmakers), and will be announced in advance of the casting. \n\n\tProducers on “London, I Love You” including David Gilbery and Naomi George for BK Studios, Tom Butterfield for Culmination Productions and Mark Wheeler for Pathfinder. Culmination’s Harry White will handle worldwide sales. “Cities of Love” franchise creator and curator Emmanuel Benbihy continues to serve as an executive producer.\n\n\t“London stands as a living heartbeat of hope, resilience, and love, a city where millions of stories intersect every day,” said Butterfield. “From a chance encounter on the Tube, in the parks, and through the bustling streets, from Hampstead to Brixton, and Hackney to Notting Hill, London is a tapestry woven from every culture and generation. As audiences everywhere yearn for connection and meaning, ‘London, I Love You’ will give them the stories of London as seen through the eyes of its dreamers, lovers, and storytellers.”\n\t\n\n\tSaid George: “We are thrilled to be bringing audiences the latest installment of this iconic franchise, and to be spotlighting London through the lens of so many exciting storytellers.”\n\n\tAdded Benbihy: “The London installment of ‘Cities of Love’ will celebrate the birthplace of some of cinema’s most beloved romantic comedies, paying tribute to that uniquely British blend of wit, warmth, and longing, where humour and heartbreak often walk hand in hand.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tEgyptian director Omar Hilal, who made a splash with breakout hit “Voy! Voy! Voy!,” is back behind the camera with “His Weakest Creatures.” The Cairo-set feature marks the first pairing between Hend Sabri and Ahmed Helmy, who are two of the Arab world’s most bankable stars.\n\n\tIn “His Weakest Creatures,” Helmy — known locally for popular comedies such as “Wahed Tany” and “X-Large” — will play a principled zoologist who works in Cairo’s Giza Zoo in 2007, during a time when it had fallen into disrepair. He will face a moral crisis when a wealthy visitor offers to “adopt” animals.\n\t\n\n\tSabri, who leads Netflix’s Arab original “Finding Ola” and recently appeared in Kaouther Ben Hania’s Oscar-nominated “Four Daughters,” plays the zoologist’s wife and mother of their children, who must navigate the strain of their modest income combined with another unexpected and unwanted pregnancy.\n\n\n\tBelow, Hilal — who launched “Voy! Voy! Voy!” in 2022 from the Red Sea Film Festival — speaks with Variety from the set of his new film, which he says will create an analogy between Cairo’s crumbling zoo and the city’s dwindling middle class.\n\t\n\t\tHow did the story originate?\t\n\n\tThis is a very personal film. Number one, I absolutely adore animals. Basically, if I couldn’t be a director, I’d be a zoologist. I grew up in a house that loves all kinds of animals. And all of my youth, while traveling around Europe, America or wherever we went, we always went to the zoo. So it’s a very important topic for me. And unfortunately, in Egypt we need to do much more about loving our animals.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tTell me more.\t\n\n\tBesides that, it’s also a story about Egypt’s middle class. It’s about a middle-class man living in Cairo’s Maadi neighbourhood, which is where I live, by the way. Maadi is sort of on its last legs because everybody in Cairo is moving out to new compounds and suburbs. The place still manages to reflect the people who are living there. But what happened is that, with a lot of economic strife, a lot of these people who used to be affluent have dropped down a few notches [on the social ladder] because they don’t have the money to keep up with the fast-moving wealth of people who are returning from the Gulf or Europe. Some people fell through through the cracks. So “His Weakest Creatures” is a story about such a man. It’s the story of a zoologist [played by Helmy] who is struggling at home, and his home struggle is mirrored in the zoo’s struggle. Because this zoo used to be a wonder. It used to be called the “Jewel of Africa,” and it has deteriorated over time. Luckily it’s now going through a renovation, which we are all very excited about.\n\t\n\t\tHow were you able to put Hend Sabri and Ahmed Helmy on screen together for the first time? \t\n\n\tI’m thanking my lucky stars that these two giants in our world have decided to join this film. They both have this unbelievable chameleon-like quality. They blend into the skin of their characters so well. And I needed real people. You know, a lot of our actors — and this has become a global thing — are very polished. These guys remain real. And their beauty and their appeal to people is how real they are. They manage to stay in touch with reality. They are not the kind of actors who come in [on a film] and go, “OK, whatever is on the page I’ll do it.” They actually push me and challenge me to make an even better film. And that’s exactly the kind of actors that I want.\n\t\n\t\tTalk to me about Hend Sabri’s role as the zoologist’s wife.\t\n\n\tShe comes from the same sort of social class as he does, but perhaps she had bigger dreams of moving up the ladder, though not necessarily of becoming the CEO of a big company. In any case, she’s a housewife. She’s a happy mother that is fierce in defense of her children. And she accepts the life that her husband has given her, despite the fact that she would have liked a bit more in life. But she’s not kicking up a fuss about it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhy is the protagonists’ social class so important in this film?\t\n\n\tThe film takes place in 2007, at a time when Egypt was kinder. My brief to everybody who boards this project is to say: “This film is meant to remind us of kinder times.” It will take us back to a time when social media basically wasn’t there. Twitter had just started and Facebook was very young. The world was less critical, less harsh and less manipulative. And I’d like to take us back to that time and talk about the middle class — a class that is hardly represented on the screen. We used to represent it in our golden age of cinema, from the the early days and up to the ’70s and ’80s. But then the middle class dwindled, and now we hardly see any movies about it. Almost none.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTarik Saleh’s politically charged thriller “Eagles of the Republic,” Sweden’s official Oscar submission for the international feature race, is leading the Guldbagge Awards with 11 nominations. \n\n\t“Eagles of the Republic” completes Saleh’s co-called Cairo Trilogy exploring the machinery of authoritarian regimes, following “Boy From Heaven” and “The Nile Hilton Incident.” The movie is vying for  best film, director, actor in a leading role for Fares Fares and screenplay, as well as craft mentions such as cinematography, sound design, original score and visual effects. The Guldbagge Awards are considered Sweden’s top film honors. \n\t\n\n\tLaced with dark humor, “Eagles of the Republic” reunites Saleh with Fares Fares, who plays George Fahmy, Egypt’s most celebrated movie star who becomes ensnared in a dangerously corrupt world after being forced by the country’s highest authorities to star in a government-backed prestige film. The film world premiered in competition at Cannes and was recently acquired by Cohen Media Group for U.S. distribution. The cast is completed by Lyna Khoudri, Zineb Triki, Amr Waked and Cherien Dabis. Saleh previously won Cannes’ best screenplay award with “Boy From Heaven,” and won Sundance’s Grand Jury Prize with “The Nile Hilton Incident” in 2017. \n\n\n\tFollowing closely are Andreas Öhman’s heartfelt dramedy “7 Steps” and Jon Blåhed’s psychological drama “Raptures” which garnered eight nominations each. Maria Eriksson-Hecht’s coming-of-age thriller “Kevlar Soul,” meanwhile, clinched seven noms. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGuldbagge Award nominees on site at the Film House.

    "body": "\n\tNewsNation is opening its borders.\n\n\tThe Nexstar-owned cable-news outlet has put the bulk of its resources into coverage of events taking place in the United States, but in 2026, it will commit to chronicling affairs around the globe by naming Robert Sherman its first international correspondent. The hope is that the 29-year-old Sherman will be stationed in Rome, where he can more easily access not only the Middle East, but western Europe, Geneva and other places around the world when news demands the network’s presence.\n\t\n\n\t“This is recognizing there are a lot of stories that impact Americans directly” around the world, says the reporter, during a recent interview. “We want to be there, in all the hot spots.”\n\n\n\tSherman takes up a global beat he believes could take him to Ukraine, to chronicle its battle with the invading Russia, or the Middle East, to examine relations between Israel and the Arab world. “There is a big focus on America-centric interest stories, especially how they are going to impact everyday people,” says Sherman. “If you’re just watching the way the world is moving right now,” he adds, and ”there is still a very fluid, dynamic situation in Ukraine.” And U.S. relations with western Europe appear to be in flux. “None of that takes into account actual breaking news,” he says. He may well have his hands full.\n\n\tHaving a designated international correspondent can be a boon for any cable-news operation. At Fox News Channel, Trey Yingst has become an expected presence on screen when conflict breaks out around the world. Clarissa Ward and Nic Robertson often turn in harrowing on-the-ground reportage for CNN.\n\t\n\n\tAt 29, Sherman may be the youngest international correspondent in cable news. He says he came by the job thanks to two things — a healthy curiosity and a willingness to volunteer.\n\n\tWhen Russia invaded Ukraine, Sherman was a recent arrival at NewsNation, and raised his hand to bear witness firsthand. “I volunteered to go. I’m not sure why. I thought it was important, and I thought we were at a moment in which the world was going to change forever,” he recalls.\n\n\tHe had largely stayed on home ground before that. Before joining NewsNation, he spent two years reporting on national affairs for Fox News Channel. He was also a reporter for WIAT in Birmingham, Alabama. \n\n\tBut he has already been traveling extensively for NewsNation. He spent nearly a month in Rome, Italy and Vatican City covering the death and funeral of Pope Francis and the papal conclave. Earlier this year, Sherman  shook hands with Pope Leo XIV and went viral for asking him if he had a message for the United States.\n\n\tSherman’s world view has shifted as he has visited other parts of the globe. His new book, “Lessons From The Front,” is told from the perspective of a 25-year-old correspondent who felt he already had an understanding of how the world worked but quickly discovered how little he understood about cultures around the world. “I just had this assumption that almost everyone saw the world through the lends of an American, that we were all coming from the same place,” he says. His time overseas has adjusted this thinking.\n\n\tThe new role is “really a dramatic assignment,” Sherman says. “and an opportunity to really stoke my curiosity.”\n",

We’ll see when “Marty Supreme” opens in theaters on Christmas Day.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s not hyperbole to say that getting audiences into cinemas — especially for indie films — has never been harder. Chalamet’s Regal event was one of many buzzy stops on his unconventional press tour, which pairs the A-lister’s flair for promotion with A24’s iconoclastic sensibilities. The 1950s-set film, from director Josh Safdie, follows the fictional table-tennis champ Marty Mauser’s pursuit of greatness — an ambition that’s reflected in Chalamet’s hardcore attempt to turn “Marty Supreme” into the art-house event of the year.\n\n\n\t“Timothée Chalamet is a generational talent both in his skills as an actor and in his understanding of the attention economy and social media landscape,” says an executive who has worked with the actor.\n\n\tClearly, Chalamet isn’t interested in just showing up to a couple of morning shows or late night appearances, and then having the studio, A24, blanket the airwaves with trailers. His other big gambit that got people talking was “leaking” an 18-minute Zoom call where he pitched satirical ideas to A24 staffers, like painting the Statue of Liberty a “very specific shade of orange.” (Orange, he told them, is to “Marty Supreme” what pink was to 2023’s blockbuster “Barbie.”) And Chalamet promised to get the original film on everyone’s radar by turning “Marty Supreme. Christmas Day” into a refrain. \n\t\n\n\t“Movie marketing is trying to be passive; trying to be chic,” Chalamet says in the meta video, for which he wrote the script. “We’re not trying to be chic.” \n\n\tChalamet’s loud-and-proud efforts are notable, not only because the success of “Marty Supreme” is riding on his name on the marquee, but because they go beyond what actors are usually willing to do to sell their work. But these days, Hollywood studios and stars can’t rely on traditional promotional playbooks. Just ask Jennifer Lawrence, whose charm offensive on “Hot Ones” and across the late-night gamut didn’t get people to theaters for her dark psychodrama “Die My Love.” Sydney Sweeney and Dwayne Johnson’s viral moments didn’t translate to ticket sales for her boxing biopic “Christy” or his MMA drama “The Smashing Machine” either.\n\n\t“It’s nearly impossible these days for indie films, even with major stars, to break out,” says Exhibitor Relations analyst Jeff Bock. ‘Marty Supreme’ is a period piece about a guy playing ping-pong. How do you sell it? Cutting through the noise is essential. I think Timothée is the only star aside from Leo who could do this.”\n\n\tChalamet is refining the guerrilla-style tactic he tested with last year’s Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown,” where he made headlines for hosting ESPN’s “College GameDay” and attending his own lookalike contest in Manhattan. His unorthodox press tour helped the biopic about a ’60s musical icon earn an impressive $140 million at the global box office. “Marty Supreme,” which is A24’s most expensive movie with a budget between $60 million to $70 million, needs a similar turnout to justify its price tag. As part of Chalamet’s one-size-doesn’t-fit-all approach to “Marty Supreme,” he’s sitting for fewer traditional interviews, forgoing a routine press junket and skipping key awards season stops like the Governors Awards. Instead of letting others do the talking, he’s taking a more active route to ensure the name on everyone’s lips is Marty.\n\n\t“Many movies don’t perform how they should because there’s not enough awareness,” says Regal Cinemas CEO Eduardo Acuna. “So the fact that ‘Marty Supreme’ has a superstar like Timothée Chalamet at the center of everything is fundamental.”\n\t\n\n\tOther ways he’s “fruitionizing” (a word coined by Chalamet) the “Marty Supreme” rollout: A surprise New York Film Festival premiere. A Nickelodeon-orange blimp (which he calls the “vehicle representation of American greatness”) to fly around the country. A panel at CCXP Brazil — a stop that’s usually reserved for Marvel or “Star Wars,” not art-house fare. And the sold-out merch, including a $25 Wheaties box and a $250 windbreaker jacket that Chalamet sent to cultural icons and famous friends that he considers to be “great,” including Misty Copeland, Tom Brady and Bill Nye.\n\n\t“Timmy has a quirky persona, and this campaign feels in line with his humor,” says Quinn Gawronski, content head at creator marketing agency Props. “Ping-pong isn’t the most serious topic, so that gives them more room to play. If it were a movie about World War II? Not so much.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tIt can be disorienting to watch the Paramount+ limited series “Little Disasters” so soon after the surprise breakout success of Peacock’s “All Her  ",
    "body": "\n\tIt can be disorienting to watch the Paramount+ limited series “Little Disasters” so soon after the surprise breakout success of Peacock’s “All Her  Fault,” because the two shows share so many story beats and influences. (Though technically, “Little Disasters” got there first; Paramount+ aired it in the UK and Ireland back in May, and is only now staging a stateside release.) Both are based on novels. Both take place among an affluent milieu of anxious mothers. Both begin with a child coming into harm’s way, then follow the child’s caretaker as she spins out into frantic paranoia. \n\t\n\n\tAdapted by creator Ruth Fowler and co-writer Amanda Duke from Sarah Vaughan’s 2020 novel, “Little Disasters” even takes this adherence to the shared mom thriller template a step further. “All Her Fault” may be another domino in the chain started by “Big Little Lies” in 2017, but “Little Disasters” borrows both part of its title and a framing device from the HBO touchstone. As the characters unpack the events that unfold when seemingly “perfect” mother Jess (Diane Kruger) brings her 10-month-old daughter to a London emergency room with a skull fracture she can’t or won’t explain, they speak directly to director Eva Sigurðardóttir’s camera in a kind of Greek chorus — just like the fictional residents of Monterey in “Big Little Lies” did all those years ago. \n\n\n\tUnsurprisingly, “Little Disasters” doesn’t transcend what it’s so plainly inspired by. Nor does the plot’s most fascinating tension, between vaccine skeptic Jess and her doctor friend Liz (Jo Joyner) — who naturally just so happens to be on duty when Jess turns up at the ER — pay off in a satisfying way as the mystery gets resolved in the six-episode series’ final moments. Until then, however, “Little Disasters” is a compact and engaging exploration of one friend group’s escalating tensions. The insights into having it all may be limited to empty platitudes aggregated from airport books (“Turns out being a perfect mother is impossible”), but “Little Disasters” couches them into a novel framework that acts as an effective hook. You can’t fault the show itself for how saturated its subgenre is, though executives should really take note; you can fault it for not fully capitalizing on its own strengths.\n\t\n\n\tLiz and Jess met a decade prior in a new mothers’ support group. Also in attendance were high-powered attorney Charlotte (Shelley Conn, “Bridgerton”) and free-spirited Irishwoman Mel (Emily Taaffe), completing a quartet that’s stayed together through differing career choices, economic outcomes and booze-soaked arguments on holiday in Provence. Half the women work, while half stay at home; half are financially strained, while half live comfortably; one is struggling to conceive a second baby, while Liz has a third who’s implied to be a surprise, bringing a perhaps unwelcome change to her once-idyllic family that culminates with Liz rushing into the ER. The husbands are present, ranging from warm support (Liz’s) to benign cluelessness (Charlotte’s, Jess’) to outright dickishness (Mel’s), but they’re peripheral by design. The real action is among the moms — sorry, mums.\n\n\tThese simmering resentments, along with standard NHS protocol and the need to kick the story into gear, help explain why Liz chooses to call social services when Jess unconvincingly insists her infant daughter Betsey simply fell down while crawling. Kruger gets the showier role here, escalating Jess’ panic as the state gets involved while keeping her fundamental motivations obscure, but it’s Joyner who gives Liz a believable mix of real empathy and understandable pettiness. Liz is doing what she’s supposed to do when she sees a child in danger, and gives Jess multiple chances to explain herself. Yet she can’t totally deny that when a friend who once made her feel inadequate might secretly be a monster, there’s some relief mixed in with the alarm.\n\n\tAgain, the most interesting thread in this tapestry — especially for Americans unused to the idea of free, public insurance — is Jess and Liz’s opposing attitudes toward healthcare. Vaccine skepticism is (unfortunately) mainstream in the U.S., but “Little Disasters” pairs that not-so-fringe belief with Jess’ insistence on taking her kids to see private practitioners over NHS doctors, a practice police start to view with suspicion. Kruger gets to keep her natural German accent, though the script is careful to note Jess grew up in America to contextualize her anti-NHS bias. I wish her backstory included gave Jess’ mistrust of medicine a more specific explanation, the better to explore how often-justified mistrust of a dysfunctional system can lead down a conspiratorial path.\n\t\n\n\tInstead, “Little Disasters” veers in a soapier direction, as is its prerogative. After Jess runs into Liz in the hospital, the absurd coincidences and conflicts of interest continue to pile up. Charlotte gives Jess legal advice; Mel babysits her older kids; bafflingly, Liz is allowed to remain on the periphery of her case, even after the social worker has arrived. I won’t spoil the central question of what really happened to Betsey, or what Jess knew and when. I’ll just say the eventual answer prioritizes shock and surprise over the relationships cultivated by all this intermingling. Honestly, it’s not unlike the ending of “All Her Fault,” which hinged on hiding information from the audience over building on what was already disclosed. Many shows purport to get at the real pain of rich families untroubled by money woes, but few stick the landing.\n\n\tAll six episodes of “Little Disasters” are now streaming on Paramount+.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs Disney has gone into business with OpenAI, the Mouse House is accusing Google of copyright infringement on a “massive scale” using AI models and services to “commercially exploit and distribute” infringing images and videos.\n\n\tOn Wednesday evening, attorneys for Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, demanding that Google stop the alleged infringement in its AI systems.\n\n\t“Google is infringing Disney’s copyrights on a massive scale, by copying a large corpus of Disney’s copyrighted works without authorization to train and develop generative artificial intelligence (‘AI’) models and services, and by using AI models and services to commercially exploit and distribute copies of its protected works to consumers in violation of Disney’s copyrights,” reads the letter to Google’s general counsel from law firm Jenner & Block on behalf of Disney.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the letter, which Variety has reviewed, Disney alleges that Google’s AI systems and services infringe Disney characters including those from Frozen, the Lion King, Moana, the Little Mermaid, Deadpool, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Wars. In its letter, Disney included examples of images it claims were generated by text prompts in Google’s AI apps, including of Darth Vader (pictured above).\n\n\tThe allegations against Google follows cease-and-desist letters that Disney sent earlier to Meta and Character.AI, as well as litigation Disney filed together with NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery against AI companies Midjourney and Minimax alleging copyright infringement.\n\n\tReps for Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\t\n\n\tDisney’s letter to Google demands that Google “immediately cease further copying, publicly displaying, publicly performing, distributing, and creating derivative works of Disney’s copyrighted characters” in “outputs of Google’s AI Services, including through YouTube’s mobile app, YouTube Shorts and YouTube.”\n\n\tIn addition, Disney said Google must “immediately implement effective technological measures within Google’s AI Services and, as necessary, Google’s suite of products and services in which Google’s AI Services are integrated, to ensure that no future outputs infringe Disney works.\n\n\t“Disney will not tolerate the unauthorized commercial exploitation of its copyrighted characters and works by so-called AI services,” Disney’s cease-and-desist letter to Google says. “Here, Google’s conduct is particularly harmful because Google is leveraging its market dominance across multiple channels to distribute its AI Services and using the draw and popularity of infringed copyrighted works to help maintain that dominance.”\n\n\tDisney alleged that Google promoted a recent viral trend involving the creation of images of “figurines,” citing this post on X by Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. According to Disney, Google has even supplied its own Gemini AI prompt to encourage users to take part in this trend, which “can be used to quickly and easily generate images of figurines of Disney’s copyrighted characters,” the letter says.\n\n\tThe Disney lawyers included images of the alleged infringing figurine images in its letter:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

Law Roach, another frequent judge on the show, also made an appearance.\n“Drag has always been important. It’s always fought the system since the early, early days, and it’s crazy that we’re still fighting,” Mathews told Variety. “We’ve never backed down from a fight. Drag’s always been protest. Ru says, ‘Every time I bat my eyelashes, I’m making a political statement.’ I think being openly queer is always a political statement whether you like it or not. The personal is political. By existing and living in your truth, you are by nature political.”\nThe new season premieres Jan. 2 on MTV with 14 queens — Athena Dion, Briar Blush, Ciara Myst, Darlene Mitchell, DD Fuego, Discord Addams, Jane Don’t, Juicy Love Dion, Kenya Pleaser, Mandy Mango, Mia Starr, Myki Meeks, Nini Coco and Vita VonTesse Starr — competing for the title of “America’s Next Drag Superstar” and a cash prize of $200,000.\nThe season also comes with a new tagline: “In shady times, let there be light.”\nThe after show “RuPaul’s Drag Race: Untucked” will kick off immediately following the Season 18 premiere

This might just kill the vibe. A skydiver’s parachute got snagged on a plane’s tail at 15,000 feet ... and the whole thing is a wild watch!\n      \n    \n          It happened in North Queensland, Australia ... when the guy’s reserve-chute handle snagged on a partially extended wing flap as he jumped ... and boom, it deployed mid-exit, leaving him flailing helplessly like a rag doll in a wind tunnel.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          According to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the guy damaged the plane’s left stabilizer ... and the pilot, not knowing there was a whole human dangling off the tail, felt the aircraft suddenly pitch up. Thinking it had stalled, he shoved the controls forward and hit the gas to steady things.\n      \n\n          Thirteen parachutists still onboard the September flight bailed ASAP ... while two others stayed back as the dangling skydiver whipped out a knife and hacked himself free from the tangled reserve chute.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He finally popped his main chute and landed with the rest ... walking away with just minor injuries.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          Meanwhile, the pilot was moments away from jumping out of the plane himself after calling a mayday ... but once the plane dropped 2,500 feet, he landed it like a champ.

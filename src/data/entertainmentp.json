    "body": "\n\tVienna-based sales outlet Square Eyes has secured international rights to “The Kartli Kingdom,” directed by Tamar Kalandadze and Julien Pebrel. The film is set to world premiere in the International Competition at the International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), taking place Nov. 13-23.\n\n\t“Kartli” refers both to Georgia’s medieval kingdom and a Tbilisi sanatorium sheltering refugees from the 1990s war in Abkhazia, meant as temporary but lasting 30 years. The collapsing building became a recreated “country”: a farm, garden, terraces, and rooms where old VHS tapes revive memories of Abkhazia, their lost paradise. Through Tamuna, Irma and others, the film reveals the exile’s trauma and shared resilience. Even if time seems frozen in Kartli’s walls, nothing stays the same.\n\t\n\n\t“Our film narrates a community’s story through the shelter of Kartli: past, present and imagined future, lending gentleness, violence, sadness, memories, and humor,” Kalandadze and Pebrel commented. “These layers of time merge in editing, combining image and sound materials. Memories, words and tales of Kartli’s past shape its inhabitants’ lives, forming foundational myths. These stories, like an underground stream, resurface during conversations, interrupting scenes we filmed. Archival footage adds bursts of collective memory, showing the 1992 war’s impact on the community.”\n\n\n\t“We love how the film gives us a glimpse inside the walls of the Kartli sanatorium, where the collective memory of the 1992 war in Abkhazia and the current lives of the residents mix into a touching and poetic documentary,” stated Wouter Jansen, CEO of Square Eyes. “The mix of these two narratives makes the film a perfect match for our catalog.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Kartli Kingdom” is produced by Ketevan Kipiani for Giorgia’s Sakdoc Film and Jean-Baptiste Bonnet for Habilis Productions in France. Square Eyes is in charge of world sales.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSaudi filmmaker Shahad Ameen’s road movie “Hijra,” centered on the bond formed between different generations of Saudi women during a journey across the desert, has been selected as Saudi Arabia’s candidate for the Oscar in the international feature film category.\n\n\t“Hijra” is the second feature from Ameen whose first work, feminist fable “Scales,” was Saudi’s Oscar candidate in 2020. \n\n\n\tShot in a vast swathe of desert and in several Saudi cities and urban areas including Jeddah, Medina, AlUla and Neom, “Hijra” premiered positively in September in the Venice Film Festival’s Spotlight section.\n\t\n\n\tThe film centers on 12-year-old Janna, who embarks on a journey toward Mecca to perform Hajj – the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca – with her strict grandmother Sitti and rebellious 18-year-old sister Sarah. But before they reach their destination, Sarah disappears, forcing Janna and Sitti into a tense and urgent search. \n\n\n\t“Hijra” features an all-Saudi cast, comprising Khairia Nathmy as Sitti, Nawaf Al-Dhafiri, nd newcomer Lamar Fadan in the lead role of Janna, with Baraa Alem making a special guest appearance.\n\n\t“Representing my country at the Oscars for a second time is a profound honor and a reflection of the positive transformation in Saudi cinema,” Ameen said in a statement. “Hijra” was one of the most challenging projects of my career. We filmed in remote regions because we believed in the urgency of this story a tale of Saudi women across generations, told from the heart of our history to the world,” she added.\n\n\t“Hijra” is a co-production between Saudi Arabia’s Film AlUla film commission, the Red Sea Film Festival Foundation, Beit Ameen Production, the Iraqi Independent Film Centre and Ideation Studios. \n\t\n\n\tThe film is lead produced by Faisal Baltyour, alongside co-producers Ayman Jamal, Mohamed Alawi and Egypt’s Mohamed Hefzy through his Film Clinic shingle.

    "body": "\n\tThe accolades are stacking up for Stephen Graham. \n\n\tLess than a month after winning his first Emmy for “Adolescence,” the British actor has now received high praise from The Boss, with Bruce Springsteen hailing his performance in “Springsteen: Delivery Me From Nowhere.”\n\n\tGraham plays Bruce’s father Douglas Springsteen in the Searchlight biopic directed by Scott Cooper, starring alongside Jeremy Allen White as the rocker during the making of his 1982 album “Nebraska.”\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking at a special Q&A at Spotify’s London headquarters with White, Springsteen claimed that Graham “really embodied the physicality emotional complexity of my father,” with whom he acknowledged he had a deeply complicated relationship. \n\n\n\t“He was very troubled, an alcoholic, bipolar and quite mentally ill,” he said. “Stephen just naturally inhabited his skin and his soul, particular as an older man — he’s the spitting image of him!”\n\n\tSpringsteen added: “Towards the end of the film, you get a sense of my father’s invulnerability and his sweetness.”\n\n\tWhite, meanwhile, noted that he learned to play the guitar using a rare 1955 Gibson J200, gifted to him by Springsteen while he prepared for role. “That became the guitar in the film,” he said. \n\n\tWhite also admitted to bringing a jump rope to set, having mistakenly thought he’d need it to keep his heart rate up and sweat flowing between takes on the performance scenes. \n\n\t“For some reason I thought my stamina would be more than Bruce’s,” he said. “It turns out it was completely unnecessary — that sweat comes naturally, that heart rate gets lifted and the adrenaline gets going. So I didn’t need to use it — Bruce-level energy comes naturally when you’re up there.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAyushmann Khurrana, Rashmika Mandanna, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and producer Dinesh Vijan come together for “Thamma,” the latest chapter in Maddock Films’ growing horror comedy universe. \n\n\tDirected by Aditya Sarpotdar and showrun by Amar Kaushik, the film extends the franchise’s mythology while introducing new folklore, humor and emotional depth.\n\n\tWhen “Stree” opened in 2018, few expected the small-town chiller to spark an enduring cinematic world. Seven years later, Maddock’s horror comedy saga — spanning “Stree,” “Bhediya,” “Stree 2” and “Munjya” — has become one of Hindi cinema’s most distinctive commercial ecosystems. “Thamma” now adds a fresh dimension to that trajectory.\n\t\n\n\t“When ‘Stree’ worked, the way we experienced it in theaters made me realize this had potential,” Vijan tells Variety. “Someone once told me, ‘build your own box.’ It stayed with me. When ‘Stree’ fired, I started looking at it like that. The universe formed itself properly by ‘Stree,’ and today we’ve got worlds, planets, rules and surprises that all connect.”\n\n\n\tHe says “Thamma” draws directly from Indian mythology. “The legend of ‘Thamma’ is genuinely Indian source material,” he says. “We often look at Western concepts, but the origin of many of these ideas is ours — way before anything the West has shown.”\n\n\tKhurrana, whose career blends mainstream entertainment with social commentary through titles such as “Andhadhun,” “Article 15” and “Dream Girl,” describes “Thamma” as his first plunge into pure fantasy. “We’ve been jamming on this for the past four or five years,” he says. “It started as a one-liner during the pandemic, and now it’s a full-fledged script. I call it the most sought-after universe in Hindi cinema. I play a Betal [a vampiric spirit from Indian folklore], and the comedy and emotion come from how an ordinary guy deals with supernatural powers. It’s less horror and more comedy, romance and action — the first romantic film of the Maddock horror comedy universe.”\n\t\n\n\tMandanna, whose career has moved fluidly across Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Hindi-language industries with films including “Kirik Party,” “Pushpa: The Rise,” “Geetha Govindam” and “Animal,” says she was drawn to the blend of tradition and style. “When I heard ‘Thamma’ the first time, I knew I had to be part of this universe,” she says. “These are such rooted characters in our Indian culture, but at the same time they have such swag. There are no references — you’re creating these characters in your mind and completely surrendering to your team. I’m as surprised by the outcome as the audience will be.”\n\n\tVijan says Mandanna’s role stands out for its physicality. “In ‘Thamma,’ Rashmika’s character is the most physically strong in the whole universe,” he says. “If you’ve seen her work, you know how disciplined she is — every other actor left the gym intimidated.”\n\n\tFor Siddiqui, known for intense performances in “Raman Raghav 2.0,” “Sacred Games” and “Gangs of Wasseypur,” “Thamma” marks a tonal departure. “I wasn’t expecting this kind of character,” he says. “As an actor it’s a new challenge — a chance to step out of my comfort zone. I’m very excited to see how I fit into this universe.”\n\n\tVijan praises Siddiqui’s portrayal of Yakshasan, the film’s antagonist. “I was so pleasantly surprised by Nawaz,” he says. “He’s crazy in the film — he’s having the most fun. Yakshasan is probably the character who’s most clear about what he wants. He believes he’s superior and wants world domination, yet Nawaz somehow makes him human.”\n\n\tThe producer adds that “Thamma” carries the franchise’s familiar mix of humor and heart. “I don’t like obvious commentary,” he says. “Whatever’s happening in society happens in films, and vice versa. There’s a subtle messaging on humanity here, but in the most non-obvious way.”\n\n\tAs for where “Thamma” fits within the larger Maddock universe, Vijan calls it “the most human” film yet. “This is one you can watch with your entire family — it’s extremely funny,” he says. “Every film has to feel different. ‘Thamma’ adds another dimension without repeating what we’ve done before. The long and short of it is, we can’t be repetitive.”\n\t\n\n\tKhurrana agrees. “Since it’s a genesis film, it carries the common thread forward but takes it somewhere new,” he says. “We’ve seen ghosts and spirits before, but nothing like Betals in Hindi cinema. ‘Thamma’ is the Sarvasrisht Betal — the supreme one.”\n\n\t“Thamma” releases Oct. 21 over the Diwali holiday frame. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAs dealmaking is reaching its climax at Mipcom, boutique production and distribution outfit Oble has added two fresh titles to its slate of series shopped to global buyers in Cannes.\n\n\tThe seven-part half hour Spanish -drama comedy “Segunda Temporada (“Second Season”) commissioned by Filmin, reunites the hot creators of “Autodefensa,” which won best short format series at Series Mania 2024: director/writer Miguel Ángel Blanca (“Magaluf Ghost Town”), named a 2021 Spanish talent to watch by Variety andco-writersBerta Prieto and Víctor Diago.\n\t\n\n\tAs in “Autodefensa,” made up of self-contained episodes and set in Barcelona, Prieto also stars in the title role, joined here by Adan Domínguez.\n\n\n\tWe follow Paula, a once-celebrated literary prodigy now trying to rebuild her life amid Barcelona’s disoriented cultural scene of 2024. According to the logline, “surrounded by second-rate celebrities and fading fame, she navigates precarious jobs, creative burnout, and the relentless search for “the next big thing”.\n\n\t“The series captures the absurdities of post-fame existence while maintaining the authenticity and irreverence audiences loved in “‘Autodefensa,’” Oble says in a statement.\n\n\tSet to start filming next week, with delivery lined up for 2026, “Segunda Temporada” is produced by Barcelona’s Boogaloo Films (Locarno’s “Sorella di clausura”) in co-production with Spain-Portugal upscale SVOD service Filmin, creative outfit Canada and Oble.\n\n\tMeanwhile the tragi-comedy “How to Kill Your Sister” world premiered at Canneseries’ main competition to critical acclaim last April, before its roll out on Belgian streamer Streamz, Aug. 21 and commercial channel Play4 early September. Belgium’s FBO produces, in co-production with Germany’s MadeForFilm, a Banijay company, and ZDF Neo.\n\t\n\n\tCo-created and written by Pedro Elia (Control Pedro”) and Evelien Broekaert, the story turns on Anna (Emma Rotsaert) who shows up at her elder sister Kat’s doorstep with a coffin, after an eight-year absence, seeking answers to why her sister abandoned her following her parent’s death. \n\n\tOne answer is Anna is just too much of a wild child for Kat to handle, who has settled for a submissive marriage to a toxic control freak. Anna latest excess is that she announces she is terminally ill and wants Kat (Marjan De Schutter) to come along on a last journey. \n\n\tUnfortunately, it’s true. The siblings embark on a hilariously dark road trip across Flanders and Spain. “I wanted extreme comedy and extreme drama, all in one show,” helmer and co-writer Geirnaert (“De Dag,” “Flatlife”) told Variety.\n\n\tFor Oble, “How to Kill Your Sister” balances humor and tragedy with care and precision, offering a heartfelt, genuinely funny exploration of grief, forgiveness, and family, highlighted by standout performances from Marjan De Schutter (Geldwolven, The Twelve) and Emma Rotsaert.”\n\n\tOble’s Mipcom slate is headlined by the Norwegian comedy “Nepobaby” from popular showrunner Henriette Steenstrup, sold by Oble to English-speaking territories CBC for CBC Gem in Canada and SBS in Australia ahead of the Cannes market, with Nordisk Film inking deals with TV2 Denmark and SVT Sweden. The show which won best screenplay and ensemble cast at Canneseries premieres Oct. 23 on TV2 Play in Norway.\n\n\tRounding out Oble’s slate is the Netflix/RTS high-end period drama “Winter Palace” produced by Swiss-based Point Prod with Oble Studios. \n\n\tSpeaking to Variety from the Palais des Festivals in Cannes, Oble co-founder Katia Sol said: “Mipcom is one of the biggest markets for content sales and all our meetings are packed. The buyers are here, but not risk-takers, looking for safe bets.”\n",

The film is supported by the Doha Film Institute (DFI), as are most titles in the Doha Film Festival’s 13-title competition.\n\t\n\n\tAlso featuring Palestine are Doha fest competition entries “Once Upon a Time in Gaza,” directed by Palestinian directorial duo Tarzan and Arab Nasser, which world premiered in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard and won the best directing prize; and Kamal Aljafari’s doc “With Hasan in Gaza,” that premiered in competition in Locarno. \n\n\tOther standout titles in the competition strand include “The President’s Cake” from Iraqi filmmaker Hasan Hadi, about a young school girl chosen to bake a celebratory dessert in observation of Saddam Hussein’s birthday, which won this year’s Cannes Camera d’Or award; “Khartotum,” the potent doc about five residents forced to flee the Sudanese capital’s conflict that launched from Sundance; and Iranian director Ali Asgari’s dark comedy about Iranian film censorship, “Divine Comedy.”\n\t\n\n\t“These powerful artistic expressions represent the creativity and resilience of humanity and demonstrate the capability of film to shape the future of our societies,” said  Doha Film Institute CEO Fatma Hassan Alremaihi in a statement. “Through these stories that engage empathy, reflection and connection, we are creating safe spaces for meaningful dialogue to counter prevailing narratives.”\n\n\tJust as the tiny Arab state, rich in oil and gas, diversifies from the energy sector into cultural and media and entertainment — as attested by broadcaster Al Jazeera and the 2022 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament — the DFI has steadily grown into a crucial cornerstone of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region film industry.\n\n\tThe upcoming Doha Film Festival transforms the DFI’s existing Ajyal Film Festival, dedicated to youth and family-friendly cinema, into a more ambitious international event for a broader audience. It will have four competition strands: international feature film competition, short film competition, the Ajyal film competition (judged by the festival’s unique youth jury) and the Made in Qatar competition, dedicated to projects made in Qatar regardless of the director’s provenance.\n\n\tThe top prizes to be dished out will be best narrative, worth $75,000; documentary, worth $50,000; artistic achievement, worth $45,000; and the gender-neutral performance acting award, worth $15,000.\n\n\tThe new festival will take place in various locations across Doha including the Katara Cultural Village, Msheireb Downtown Doha and the Museum of Islamic Art.\n\n\tSee the full Doha Film Festival competition lineup below.\n\n\t“Khartoum,” Anas Saeed, Rawia Alhag, Ibrahim Snoopy Ahmad, Timeea Mohamed Ahmed and Philip Cox\n\n\t“Cotton Queen,” Suzannah Mirghani\n\n\t“Once Upon a Time in Gaza,” Tarzan and Arab Nasser\n\n\t“With Hassan in Gaza,” Kamal Aljafari\n\n\t“The President’s Cake,” Hasan Hadi\n\n\t“My Father and Qaddafi,” Jihan K  \n\n\t“Renoir,” Chie Hayakawa\n\n\t“Sleepless City,” Guillermo García López\n\n\t“The Last Shore,” Jean-Francois Ravagnan\n\n\t“The Reserve,” Pablo Pérez Lombardini\n\n\t“Divine Comedy,” Ali Asgari \n\n\t“Hair, Paper, Water,” Truong Minh Quý and Nicolas Graux\n\t\n\n\t“Blue Heron,” Sophy Romvari\n",

    "body": "\n\tNatalie Portman spoke with great affection about Diane Keaton, who died on Oct. 11, during her masterclass at this week’s Lumière Film Festival.\n\n\t“She gave female characters the opportunity to be as complex as the male characters we commonly see,” she said. “They were neurotic, they were funny, they were smart, they were emotional, they were weird. She let women be weird on screen. [She was] someone who was unapologetically herself, and you fell in love with her because of that.”\n\t\n\n\tAsked about the performers who inspired her, Portman also spoke with admiration about Gena Rowlands, Julianne Moore, Isabelle Huppert and Nicole Kidman. \n\n\n\tAs one of this year’s guests of honor, the Oscar-winning actor held the packed Pathé Bellecour theater spellbound with queues outside snaking for dozens of meters from those hoping for a last-minute seat.\n\n\tOver the course of the talk, she reflected on a career that has moved with ease between studio blockbusters and intimate auteur films, explaining that she founded her own production company “to create the movies that I want to see in the world, that I want to participate in.”\n\n\t“I didn’t grow up with much of a cinematic knowledge or appreciation,” she admitted with a laugh. “I was really seeing kind of mainstream movies. I grew up with ‘The Lion King,’ ‘Mrs. Doubtfire,’ ‘Dirty Dancing,’ ‘Pretty Woman’… It was only after I started making films that I started learning about cinematic history.”\n\n\tThat discovery came through the filmmakers she worked with, she said, who introduced her to directors such as John Cassavettes, Michael Haneke, Wong Kar-wai or Robert Bresson. From there, her taste and understanding of cinema expanded, feeding her career choices.\n\t\n\n\tThe conversation then turned to her early years. Portman was only 12 when she made her first film, Luc Besson’s “Léon: The Professional,” and she recalled how naturally she took to acting. “It’s actually the most childlike thing to do,” she smiled. “You’re pretending. Being an actor is acting like a child all the time. All children are actors. (…) It’s part of natural human behavior.”  \n\n\tPortman famously attended Harvard University after shooting “Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace” – “I’m from a very academic family and it was never a choice.” \n\n\tAsked whether studying psychology helped her better approach her characters, she drew a clear parallel. “I think it’s really the same practice,” she replied. “It’s the same question: why do people do what they do? What is someone feeling at any given moment? What are the interesting contradictory feelings that we have? Observation, observation, observation – watching people, noting behavior, and trying to understand why.”\n\n\tThat same spirit of inquiry has defined her approach to researching her characters. Whether it was reading “millions of books” to play Anne Boleyn in “The Other Boleyn Girl,” watching “millions of videos and documentaries,” and listening to audio tapes for “Jackie,” or working on the troubled superstar character of Celeste for “Vox Lux.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tArco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@ Remembers Mountain\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“When I had to learn what a K-hole looked like… I wasn’t going to do ketamine to learn that, so I went to YouTube,” she said with a smile, describing the platform as “a wonderful resource.”\n\n\tPortman was also keen to speak about her work as a producer and her interest in animation, mentioning her collaboration with French director Ugo Bienvenu on “Arco,” which picked up the top prize at the world’s biggest animation festival in Annecy and is out this week in France. \n\n\tShe said she was struck by how horizontal and collaborative the animation world could be, with artists often moving fluidly between roles.\n\n\tHer admiration for collaborative leadership extended to her creative partners. Of “Black Swan” director Darren Aronofsky, she said: “He has such a confidence in his vision, but he’ll always take someone else’s good idea. That combination of confidence and humility – that’s what marks greatness.”\n\t\n\n\tAsked what was left of her cult character of Nina in “Black Swan,” Portman answered straight-faced, “I still do the butt exercises I learned while training” – before switching to French with a flash of humor and a wink to her French audience with perfect comic timing: “les exercices pour le derrière!”\n\n\tAs the conversation came to a close, Portman was asked what advice she would give her 12-year-old self about to shoot “Léon” if she met her today. “Play, have fun,” she said simply.\n\n\tA retrospective of Portman’s work is screened at Lumière as part of her visit, featuring “Heat,” “V for Vendetta,” “Black Swan,” and “Jackie.”\n\n\tThe Lumière Film Festival runs in Lyon until Oct. 19.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlong with hosting YouTube’s leadership for the first time, this year’s Mipcom also turned the spotlight on the different models powering the creator economy at a packed session on Tuesday morning. \n\n\tHosted by “What’s Trending” founder and CEO Shira Lazar, the Creator Upfronts featured Callum McGinley aka “Callux” and Ben Doyle aka “Rvbberduck” from After Party Studios, followed by Sean Atkins from Dhar Mann Studios and Kudzi Chikumbu, Tubi‘s VP of creator partnerships.\n\t\n\n\tCallux and Rvbberduck were joined on stage by Nella Rose, a hugely popular YouTuber and presenter who previously took part in the U.K. reality series “I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here” and has over 4 million followers across TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. Rose announced her new show “The Nella Rose Show,” which After Party Studios will be producing and pitching to potential broadcasting and streaming partners.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt wasn’t the first time the Cannes-set television market gave an in-depth look at the digital creation biz. A decade ago, as Mipcom boss Lucy Smith reminded the audience during her introduction, the conference hosted the Mip Digital Upfront, a one-off initiative she said was “well received, but felt a bit premature for the market.” The creator economy is now “shaping the future of entertainment” and there are more and more partnerships with traditional media, as illustrated by BBC Studios’ recent deal with YouTube discussed on Monday by BBC Studios digital SVP Jasmine Dawson and YouTube’s EMEA boss Pedro Pina.\n\n\tDuring the After Party session, Rvbberduck said he met Callux in 2015 on a KFC campaign called “Around the World in 99 Gigs,” where he noticed a disconnect between what the client wanted from Callux, which was an “entertainment format that was essentially a long form chicken advert,” and what the director aspired to do, which was to do “crazy stuff” with an audience in mind.\n\t\n\n\t“When we landed back in London, we decided to start our own studios to bridge the gap between mainstream and digital,” Callux said, and “become the No. 1 producers of the internet’s most culturally relevant content.”\n\n\t“We did this by thinking like a creator,” he said. The company expanded to a team of over 30 people who “approach every project like they’re a creator,” which he argues is key because “these social platforms were built and sculpted by creators.” Ultimately, After Party Studios has succeeded in positioning themselves “neatly in this spot in the middle between creators, brands and commissioners,” Callux said. Some of the banner’s collaborations with broadcasters include the Channel 4.0 show “Hear Me Out” and the Sky Sports series “Scenes” for next-gen football fans.\n\n\tThere’s still work to do to find a common ground in terms of tone and creative freedom. Rose spoke about her different experiences working for television on shows like “I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here” and for digital media, emphasizing the fact that there’s still much more creative freedom in the digital space.\n\n\t“There’s a big difference with reality TV; it’s scripted from start to finish. And a lot of people don’t know that … Whereas in digital media, I could be 100% myself and my audience resonates way more with how I am actually in digital than on TV,” Rose said. Her next format, “The Nella Rose Show,” which After Party Studios is developing independently, will look to capture her unhinged spontaneity even if it will be pitched to broadcasters down the line.\n\n\tOver at Dhar Mann Studios, Atkins talked about how the company, which specializes in inspirational scripted long-form content, has become one of the largest creators on Facebook and YouTube, boasting 143 million global followers.\n\n\tThe exec said “the good thing about storytelling is that it’s pretty universal, particularly with what we do which is all on human emotions” and is “dealing with themes like acceptance or rejection inequality.”\n\n\tAtkins, who joined Dhar Mann Studios in 2024 and previously headed MTV as well as worked as chief digital officer at Discovery, said the banner has also thrived by having lean operations. He said Dhar Mann Studios produce five and a half hours of television shows every week with only nine crews, running about 18 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\t\n\n\t“If you stepped onto the lot, it would look like you’d stepped onto a Warner Bros. lot or you’ve gone to Pinewood here in the U.K. But in terms of how it works compared to kind of traditional media, it’s just much more lean and much more efficient because that’s what the economics require,” Atkins said. “It’s like, you want to make a feature film, you need thousands of people. If you want to make a broadcast television show, you need 100 people. To make a cable show, you need tens. And if you want to make a digital show, one. It’s just an exponential curve.”\n\n\tAtkins also talked about the revenue model for Dhar Mann Studios, which he says comes from different sources. One of them is basic revenue sharing, where the creator receives approximately half of the money generated across six platforms; the second is brand deals, which are actually more lucrative for creators and represent approximately 50% to 60% of their revenue; and then the ancillary business development where Dhar Mann Studios works with its agency, Fifth Order, to help creators manage their assets.\n\n\tThe Upfronts concluded with a discussion around distribution with Tubi’s Chikumbu, who said the AVOD service was an attractive destination for creators because of its powerful reach. “We’ve grown an audience of fans to over 100 million monthly active users, a lot of them are Gen Z and millennials,” he pointed out. The executive said 70% of them “want content from independent filmmakers, but also from creators.” So far, Tubi boasts a large library of “almost 300,000 episodes and a really strong recommendation system” and the platform’s ultimate goal is to build a “creatorverse.”\n\n\t“[It’s] a place where creators can have a path to Hollywood but also retain their authentic creativity,” Chikumbu said.\n\n\tLazar, an Emmy-nominated digital culture expert who hosted the Mip Digital Upfront 10 years ago, told Variety in a post-mortem chat that the showcase gave “three perspectives” on the sector. She explained that After Party Studios is “a creator-founded company that’s partnering with other creators to launch shows on their own platforms — funding them in cost-efficient ways, then leveraging that momentum for distribution or brand deals.” In contrast, she noted, Dhar Mann Studios “has been built around the personality of its creator and evolved into a full-fledged production powerhouse. He’s not just creating content for his own channels, but collaborating with others, developing new formats, and successfully scaling scripted, long-form storytelling.” On the distribution side, Lazar pointed to Tubi as an example of how “streamers are now partnering with creators and utilizing their archives and libraries — much like traditional media once did.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLazar is a pioneer in the digital space, having launched What’s Trending, an online talk show, in 2011. Since then, the Emmy-nominated, digital-native brand has grown to more than four million followers across platforms.“What’s Trending continues to lead in covering the news, views, and culture shaping the social generation,” Lazar said. “We started spotlighting creators and social media culture when almost no one else was doing it, and we’ve been tracking that evolution for more than a decade. As traditional media and brands now enter this space, we’re helping them navigate it, offering insights and context to better understand how it translates into authentic content, programming, and creator collaborations.”The company has now expanded into reports, research, and B2B strategy. It recently launched the Creator Ecosphere Map in collaboration with Evan Shapiro and Filmhub, a data and insights initiative mapping the people, platforms, and companies shaping the creator economy. Lazar, who is also an advocate for mental health in the creator community through her initiative Creators 4 Mental Health, noted that What’s Trending is exploring how emerging technologies like AI are reshaping creativity and influence, with new trend reports and collaborations with streaming and brand partners on the horizon.At this year’s Mipcom, a number of alliances with traditional media companies have been announced, including Banijay‘s pact with YouTube to launch an Entertainment Creators Lab in France and its acquisition of a majority stake in Dutch label Werktitel.\n",

    "description": "\n\tLYON, France  —  Andrea Kalas, Vice President of Media and Archival Services at Iron Mountain and one of the field’s most influential voices, delive",
    "body": "\n\tLYON, France  —  Andrea Kalas, Vice President of Media and Archival Services at Iron Mountain and one of the field’s most influential voices, delivered the keynote at this year’s Marché International du Film Classique (MIFC), running alongside the Lumière Film Festival in Lyon, France.\n\n\tThroughout a career spanning more than three decades, from her early days at UCLA Film & Television Archive, to the British Film Institute, Paramount Pictures, and now Iron Mountain, Kalas has helped design three sub-zero vaults to protect the fragile legacy of nitrate and acetate film stock – the frozen heart of cinema history.\n\t\n\n\tAt Iron Mountain, the company’s work goes far beyond celluloid. “We’re helping our clients advocate for their archives,” she said, describing a mission that spans not just film elements, but production notes, scripts, costumes and props. “Things are at such risk. Videotape digitization for example – the number of machines available is shrinking. The will is there, but the money isn’t always.”\n\n\n\tKalas’ talk at MIFC, the world’s largest market dedicated to heritage cinema, traced both the technical and cultural evolution of film preservation. The turning point, she recalled, came in the late 1980s, when media mogul Ted Turner began colorizing black-and-white classics like “Citizen Kane.” “There was an enormous outcry,” she said. “I think John Huston called it ‘cultural devastation.’ Directors were very upset – it was an artist’s rights issue: ‘This is the film I created, and you’re changing it. That’s not cool.’”\n\t\n\n\tWhat followed, Kalas explained, was nothing less than a revolution. “Out of that crisis came a real revolution in film preservation. Legislation [was introduced] called the Film Preservation Act, Martin Scorsese’s Film Foundation was formed, Iron Mountain started storing film for the first time, the Association of Moving Image Archivists was formed. There was a before and after.”\n\n\tThat moment also marked a philosophical shift: a recognition that preservation isn’t an afterthought but part of filmmaking itself. “Remember back then there was no IMDB, we didn’t even know what films we had. So the AFI stepped in and did the AFI catalog for the first time. We had a list of films that were American for the first time. Amazing!”\n\n\tIn addition to her work at Iron Mountain, Kalas also heads the Academy Digital Preservation Forum, a platform where archivists, filmmakers, and technologists come together to swap ideas, share best practices, and tackle the challenges of keeping both digital and analog cinema safe for the future.\n\n\tDuring her years at Paramount, Kalas spearheaded restorations of studio milestones, including “Wings” (1927), the first Best Picture Oscar winner. “Not only did we restore the film, which was very difficult because the image materials were so compromised, but we also had the original score, which we re-recorded,” she explained.  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWings\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe project took on new life when “Star Wars” sound designer Ben Burtt created an audio mix combining the original score with vintage plane effects. “The day we watched it, he said, ‘You know, it’s no longer a silent movie. It’s a war movie.’ And I really love that: that’s when you feel successful – when people forget they’re watching a silent movie. They’re just watching a movie.”\n\n\tRecalling one of the highlights of her career, Kalas described organizing a private screening of Francis Ford Coppola’s new edit of “The Godfather: Part III” at the Paramount Theater in the middle of COVID on the director’s request. Long dismissed as the lesser film in the trilogy, the movie’s criticism had “really stung” its cast, many of whom had worked on the earlier instalments. “They were very emotional,” she added, laughing, “Al Pacino wanted to give Andy Garcia a big hug, and he looked at the mask, like ‘It’s COVID, dude, back off’,” she smiled.\n\t\n\n\tIn her conversation with Variety ahead of the keynote, Kalas also addressed the rise of AI in restoration. “I was working on ‘Sunset Boulevard’ and we used a lot of very nuanced AI tools to actually extract individual audio tracks so that we could take out the hiss and hum. With AI you just have a little more power, a little better tools to be able to do that.”\n\n\tBut, she added, with great power comes great responsibility. “The more powerful they are, the more responsibility you have to use them well. That oversight of the restoration with people who have done their research on the film, who really know what they’re doing, in connection with the technologists that are building the tools – that collaboration continues, just with a greater responsibility.”\n\n\tShe concluded with a pointed reminder: “It’s about making sure that you have archivists in the mix because they can actually help you if you are concerned that your film, your show, your image or photograph is honored within this AI world. Archivists know where the real things are. We have a record of it. When archivists were in the mix, it really helped encourage Scorsese to act, helped encourage the government in the U.S. to act. That’s my message: make sure you’re talking to your archivists when you talk about AI.”\n\n\tThe MIFC runs alongside the Lumière Film Festival in Lyon until Oct. 16.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAndrea Kalas\n\t\n\n\n",

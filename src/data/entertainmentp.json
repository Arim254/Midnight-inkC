    "body": "\n\tMagnolia Pictures has acquired U.S. rights to “Late Fame,” the acclaimed new film from “Diane” director Kent Jones. It world premiered at this year’s Venice Film Festival and later played at the New York Film Festival. \n\n\t“Late Fame” stars Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe, as well as “Past Lives” breakout Greta Lee. Edmund Donovan (“Civil War”) co-stars. Magnolia plans to release the film in 2026. Jones, who was the former director of the New York Film Festival, also made the documentary “Hitchcock/Truffaut.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film was written by Oscar-nominated screenwriter Samy Burch (“May December”) and is based on Arthur Schnitzler’s novella of the same name. It follows Ed Saxberger (Dafoe), a forgotten New York poet who works in a post office. After an eager and flattering fan (Donovan) appears on his doorstep, Saxberger is beckoned into a coterie of younger admirers who anoint him as a rediscovered genius. Intoxicated by the attention, and by the alluring presence of Gloria (Lee), the group’s “tragic heroine,” Saxberger gradually reckons with the authenticity of his newfound poetic circle. \n\n\n\t“With ‘Late Fame,’ Kent Jones cements his status as an exquisite cinematic artist,” said Magnolia Pictures co-CEOs Eamonn Bowles and Dori Begley. “Willem Dafoe’s memorable performance, ably abetted by the rest of the terrific cast, anchors a beautifully complex tale.”\n\n\tMagnolia has previously released Paul Schrader’s Venice crime thriller “Master Gardener,” Alexander Nanau’s Oscar-nominated documentary “Collective”; Cannes Palme d’Or winners and Oscar-nominated “Shoplifters” and “The Square”; and Raoul Peck’s Oscar-nominated “I Am Not Your Negro.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve always loved Magnolia,” said Jones. “I love their taste, I love their commitment, and I love their devotion to movies and those of us who make them. There is no better home for ‘Late Fame’ than Magnolia Pictures.”\n\n\tThe picture was produced by Pamela Koffler, Mason Plotts, Christine Vachon, Danny Roberts, H.S. Naji, Jackie Langelier, Taylor Shung and Ethan Lazar. The film is executive produced by Kyle Owens, Austen Rydell, Billie Lourd, Naia Cucukov, Peter Richards, Peter Friedland, Sasha Klupchak, Evan Moore, Nidal Kahl, Josh Plasse, Brev Moss, Robina Riccitello, Josh Peters, Lorenza Veronica, Alessandro Del Vigna, Lisa Wolofsky, Sara Schuster, Samy Burch, Martin Scorsese, Nahanael Karmitz, Elisha Karmitz, Fionnuala Jamison, and Vanessa Saal. “Late Fame” is A Killer Films Production, in association with Fresh Fish Films, Working Barn Productions, Morning Moon Productions and MK2 Films.\n\n\tThe deal was negotiated by Magnolia SVP of Acquisitions John Von Thaden, with UTA Independent Film Group, Cinetic Media, and WME Independent representing the filmmakers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSinger Barry Manilow revealed on Monday that he will undergo surgery to remove a cancerous spot on his lung that was discovered after he finished a run of Christmas concerts.\n\n\tManilow said that after recovering from six weeks of bronchitis and a five-week relapse, he went to his doctor for a check-up. It was there that the doctor discovered “a cancerous spot on my left lung that needs to be removed,” but Manilow reassured his fans that he won’t have to undergo chemotherapy or a very long recovery process.\n\t\n\n\t“The bad news is that now that the Christmas A Gift of Love concerts are over, I’m going into surgery to have the spot removed,” he wrote on Instagram. “The doctors do not believe it has spread and I’m taking tests to confirm their diagnosis. So, that’s it. No chemo. No radiation. Just chicken soup and ‘I Love Lucy’ reruns.”\n\n\n\tHe added, “The only follow-up is a month to recover and that means we have to reschedule the January arena concerts.”\n\n\n\tHe also announced that several of his upcoming 2026 concerts will have to shift dates to accommodate his surgery and recovery.\n\n\t“I’m very sorry that you have to change your plans. Just like you, we were all looking forward to the January shows and hate having to move everything around,” he wrote. “In the meantime, I’m counting the days until I return to my home away from home at the Westgate Las Vegas for our Valentine’s weekend concerts on February 12-13-14 and throughout 2026.”\n\n\tOn a lighter note, he added: “I hope you have a wonderful Christmas and a Happy New Year. And remember, if you have even the slightest symptom…get tested! I’ll see you at the Westgate Las Vegas for Valentine’s!”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery hired Adrienne O’Hara as EVP, chief communications and public affairs officer of Discovery Global, the TV-centric entity that’s set to spin off from WBD next year.\n\n\tO’Hara, a communications and PR veteran most recently at Gap Inc., will join the company effective Jan. 7, 2026. In the newly created role, she will report to Gunnar Wiedenfels, WBD’s current CFO who will become president and CEO of Discovery Global. O’Hara will lead all global communications and public affairs for the company as it gears up to operate as an independent, publicly traded company following the planned separation from Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\t\n\n\tCurrently, WBD expects to complete the spin-off of Discovery Global in the third quarter of 2026. Following that, the remaining WBD businesses — Warner Bros.’s studios, HBO and HBO Max, and games — will be acquired by Netflix under an $83 billion deal.\n\n\n\tThat whole plan could be derailed, though: David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance has launched a hostile $108 billion takeover bid, hoping to convince WBD shareholders to vote for that deal and reject the Netflix agreement.\n\n\tDiscovery Global will include WBD’s entertainment, sports and news TV brands CNN (including CNN International and CNN’s All Access streaming service), Discovery, TNT, TBS, OWN, HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Animal Planet, Cartoon Network and Adult Swim. It also will include TNT Sports in the U.S. and free-to-air channels across Europe, as well as digital products such as the Discovery+ streaming service and Bleacher Report (B/R).\n\n\tWiedenfels said in a statement, “Adrienne is a proven leader with deep experience guiding iconic branded portfolios through transformation and change. Her ability to translate strategy into clear, compelling narratives will be critical as we look to engage our investors, employees, partners and other stakeholders, building continued belief in Discovery Global’s incredible potential as a standalone company.”\n\t\n\n\tO’Hara, who is based in New York, most recently served as SVP of global communications and engagement at Gap Inc., where she led enterprise communications and multistakeholder engagement for the company’s portfolio of global brands since 2020. Before that, she was head of communications for Gap Inc.’s Old Navy. Earlier in O’Hara’s career, she spent more than a decade at Toys”R”Us in senior communications roles.\n\n\tO’Hara commented: “Discovery Global has an extraordinary portfolio of brands and a clear opportunity to redefine its market positioning, using communications to support growth and deepen cultural relevance. “I’m excited to partner with Gunnar and the entire global team to help shape the company’s narrative, elevate the employee experience, and increase brand impact as Discovery Global enters its next chapter.”\n\n\tO’Hara’s appointment completes the leadership team for the new company, according to WBD. The Discovery Global leadership team, as previously announced, includes:\n\n\nGunnar Wiedenfels, president and CEO\nGerhard Zeiler, president, U.S., U.K. & Germany, Discovery+ and chief content officer\nFraser Woodford, CFO\nDavid Duvall, chief technology officer\nAmy Girdwood, chief people & culture officer\nRyan Gould, president, U.S. ad sales GTM (reporting to Zeiler)\nAnil Jhingan, chief development officer\nKasia Kieli, president and managing director, Poland, and TVN CEO\nFernando Medin, president, international\nScott Miller, president, distribution (reporting to Zeiler)\nFulvia Nicoli, executive VP, content strategy and insights (reporting to Zeiler)\nBrian Rauch, chief accounting officer (reporting to Woodford)\nLuis Silberwasser, chairman and CEO, TNT Sports\nMark Thompson, chairman and CEO, CNN Worldwide\nSue Underwald, chief legal officer\nBobby Voltaggio, president, U.S. ad sales platform monetization (reporting to Zeiler)\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tUniversal has released the first teaser for “The Odyssey,” Christopher Nolan‘s highly anticipated adaptation of Homer’s legendary saga.\n\n\tThe film follows the Greek hero Odysseus, played by Matt Damon, as he travels the long and winding path back home after the Trojan War. Universal released a first-look photo of Damon in costume back in February. Damon stars alongside Anne Hathaway, Zendaya, Tom Holland, Lupita Nyong’o, Charlize Theron, Mia Goth, Benny Safdie, Jon Bernthal, John Leguizamo and more. In addition to directing, Nolan wrote the script and produced the film alongside his wife, Emma Thomas.\n\t\n\n\tThe trailer shows Odysseus get shipwrecked along with his army and make his way back home during a treacherous journey. He and his soldiers are also seen inside the infamous Trojan horse, which was previous teased in a six-minute clip screened before Imax 70mm showings of “Sinners” and “One Battle After Another.” Odysseus walks across land, sails by sea and treks through caves, including one where an ominously large beast appears in the shadows. There are also brief shots of Holland as Odysseus’ son Telemachus and Hathaway as Penelope, Odysseus’ wife.\n\n\n\tUniversal said last December that the film would be “shot across the world using brand new Imax film technology.” Universal executive Jim Orr teased at CinemaCon that audiences could expect “a visionary, once-in-a-generation cinematic masterpiece that Homer himself would quite likely be proud of.”\n\n\tLeguizamo compared Nolan’s work ethic to that of an independent filmmaker. “He’s not doing it by committee, he’s not doing it by what the studio says,” the actor said during a recent appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”\n\t\n\n\t“He’s like an indie filmmaker but with crazy money,” Leguizamo added.\n\n\tNolan’s most recent blockbuster was “Oppenheimer,” which won seven Oscars in 2024. The filmmaker told Variety in 2023 that he wasn’t sure which project he’d tackle after “Oppenheimer,” but added, “Whatever I do, I have to feel like I own it completely. I have to make it original to me: The initial seed of an idea may come from elsewhere, but it has to go through my fingers on a keyboard and come out through my eyes alone.”\n\n\t“The Odyssey” arrives in theaters July 17.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothée Chalamet has some explaining to do. For the last several weeks, the Oscar nominee has been raising eyebrows in Hollywood with his unconventional press tour for “Marty Supreme.” While some publicity bits have been embraced (the A24 marketing meeting parody that gave way to the orange “Marty Supreme” blimp, for instance), Chalamet’s interviews have proven far more divisive. \n\n\tIn one interview that gained heat on social media, Chalamet told a reporter that “Marty Supreme” marked his best acting role yet after he gave “top-of-the-line performances” over the last “seven, eight years.” He added: “I don’t want people to take it for granted. I don’t want to take it for granted. This is really some top-level shit”\n\t\n\n\tChalamet later sat down with “Good Morning America” and made vague comments about the film’s potential success that many on social media interpreted as the actor predicting he’ll be receiving an Oscar for “Marty Supreme” in the new year.\n\n\n\t“I want the movie to succeed. I want everything to win,” Chalamet said. “The real truth is that ‘Marty Supreme,’ I feel confident to the degree that by next summer … I’m confident I know what it’s gonna be by next summer.”\n\n\tWhatever Chalamet’s intentions have been on the press tour, he’s left many fans on social media a bit turned off by what they perceive as the actor’s cockiness. Chalamet recently told IndieWire that his press tour is all in keeping in line with the energy of “Marty Supreme”\n\n\t“This is in the spirit of Marty, and I feel like this is ultimately an original film at a time when original movies aren’t really put out,” Chalamet said when asked about the press tour. “It’s a movie about the pursuit of a dream. I’m leaving it on the field. Whether it’s the merch or the Zoom or the media appearances, I’m trying to get this out in the biggest way possible. In the spirit of Marty Mauser.”\n\t\n\n\tHate it or love it, Chalamet’s “Marty Supreme” press tour appears to be working for now. The movie opened on six screens Dec. 19 and grossed an impressive $875,000 during its opening weekend, resulting in the best per-screen-average (PSA) of the year ($145,933 per theater), the biggest PSA of all time for A24 and the highest PSA for a platform release since 2016’s box office hit “La La Land.” The movie goes into nationwide release on Christmas Day.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron’s long-awaited “Avatar: Fire and Ash” made a dominant entry at the Korean box office, opening to $10.2 million from 1.3 million admissions over the Dec. 19–21 frame. \n\n\tAccording to KOBIS, the tracking service operated by the Korean Film Council, the film accounted for nearly two-thirds of total weekend revenue, playing across 2,514 screens and rapidly scaling to a $13.6 million cumulative haul in just five days.\n\t\n\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” moved to second but remained a formidable holdover, adding $4 million to push its Korean total to $41.2 million after four weekends in release. The animated sequel drew more than 620,000 admissions and continued to dominate family audiences despite the arrival of Cameron’s tentpole.\n\n\n\tLocal animated title “Pororo the Movie: Sweet Castle Adventure” placed third with $250,668, bringing its total to $805,395. \n\n\tSouth Korean comedy-drama “The People Upstairs” followed closely in fourth with $262,926 for a cumulative $3.2 million. Directed by Ha Jung-woo and starring Gong Hyo-jin, Kim Dong-wook, Lee Ha-nee and Ha Jung-woo himself, the film follows a downstairs couple driven to exhaustion by constant noise from their upstairs neighbours. A tense dinner meant to resolve the issue quickly unravels into an evening of sharp confessions and shifting dynamics.\n\n\tJapanese anime feature “Jujutsu Kaisen: Shibuya Incident / Culling Game – The Movie” ranked fifth, grossing $129,992 and lifting its total to $2.3 million. Directed by Shōta Goshozono, the film condenses the anime’s Shibuya Incident arc as Yuji Itadori and his allies face a coordinated curse attack on Halloween. The aftermath sets up the looming Culling Game and Yuta Okkotsu’s mission that puts Yuji’s fate in jeopardy.\n\t\n\n\tUniversal’s horror sequel “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” came in sixth with $126,015, elevating its cumulative take to $1.4 million.\n\n\tPreview screenings of “Crayon Shinchan the Movie: Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers” entered the chart in seventh with $75,097 ahead of its Dec. 24 release. Musical sequel “Wicked: For Good” continued to taper in eighth with $49,252, reaching $6.5 million overall.\n\n\tJapanese filmmaker Miyake Sho’s Locarno Golden Leopard winner “Two Seasons, Two Strangers” added $45,916 for a $238,103 total. Drawing from Tsuge Yoshiharu’s 1967 and 1968 short stories, the film follows a screenwriter named Lee (played by Korean actor Shim Eun-kyung) as she embarks on contrasting seasonal journeys — a summer encounter at a seaside town and a winter retreat to a remote mountain lodge.\n\n\tOscar shortlisted Japanese period drama “Kokuho” rounded out the top ten with $31,713, pushing its cumulative gross to $1.1 million.\n\n\tThe top ten films collectively grossed $15.2 million over the Dec. 19–21 weekend, up from last weekend’s  $9.5 million. \n",

    "body": "\n\tWME Independent has taken world sales on “Muganga, The One Who Treats,” the advocacy-driven drama inspired by the true story of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dr. Denis Mukwege, who treats survivors of wartime sexual violence. The film, supported by Angelina Jolie, is having a strong run in French cinemas.\n\n\t“Muganga” is about real-life Congolese doctor and pastor Denis Mukwege who joins forces with Belgian surgeon and atheist Guy Cadière to treat thousands of women and fight sexual violence in eastern Congo. Jolie, who first met survivors of rape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2013, has known and worked alongside Dr. Mukwege for over a decade, campaigning for an end to impunity for the use of rape and sexual violence as weapons of war. Jolie serves as a co-producer on the film.\n\t\n\n\tFollowing its Sept. 24 release in French cinemas, “Muganga,” which is directed by France’s Marie-Hélène Roux, has been having a stellar run scoring more than €3 million ($3.5 million) locally to date. Strong critical response and word-of-mouth are now prompting plans for a wider French re-release due to audience demand, according to a WME Independent statement. WME Independent is the film sales and financing arm of the William Morris Endeavor Agency.\n\n\n\tFilmed on location in Gabon, “Muganga” stars Cesar-winning actor Isaach De Bankolé as Dr. Mukwege, leading an ensemble cast that also includes Vincent Macaigne, Manon Bresch, Babetida Sadjo and Déborah Lukumuena. The movie won three Valois awards at the Angoulême Film Festival in France, including the prestigious audience award, the youth award, and best actor for De Bankolé.\n\t\n\n\t“The response in France has been extraordinary,” said “Muganga” producer Cynthia Pinet of Petites Poupées Production in a statement. “Audiences connected deeply with the film’s emotional truth and urgency, and that connection translated into exceptional word of mouth, confirming viewers’ appetite for impactful films.” \n\n\tFrance’s Canal+ holds streaming rights to “Muganga” in France and Francophone Africa.\n\n\t“Muganga” was financed by Canex Creations, an initiative of the African Export-Import Bank Afreximbank alongside partners including Canal+, France 3 Cinéma, France Télévisions, France’s CNC and Scope Pictures.\n\n\tCanex Creations CEO Osahon Akpata commented: “At Canex Creations, we believe in backing powerful African stories that matter and ensuring they travel globally. “Muganga, The One Who Treats” is exactly that kind of project: urgent, courageous, and emotionally resonant. With WME Independent now driving worldwide sales, the film is well positioned to reach new audiences and contribute meaningfully to global conversations.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBari Weiss, recently installed as CBS News‘ editor in chief, told staffers at the news outlet that she pulled a “60 Minutes” report on “horrific treatment” of detainees deported from the U.S. by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvador “because it wasn’t ready.”\n\n\tAbout three hours before airtime Sunday, “60 Minutes” announced it was postponing a segment from correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi interviewing deportees who the Trump administration sent to the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT) prison in El Salvador. A CBS News rep said Sunday that it was halted because, “We determined it needed additional reporting.” The network said the CECOT report, which it had previously promoted as documenting “brutal and tortuous conditions” at the facility, would air at a future date.\n\t\n\n\tWeiss requested “numerous changes to the segment” and then spiked the report on Saturday, the New York Times reported. Among Weiss’s suggestions was that the piece should include an interview with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller or another top Trump administration official. Weiss, according to the Times, gave Miller’s contact info to the “60 Minutes” team working on the CECOT segment; Alfonsi said she already requested comment from the Department of Homeland Security, the White House and the State Department.\n\n\n\tOn an editorial call Monday morning, Weiss explained to CBS News staff why she held the piece. However, it remains unclear why Weiss — who should have been aware of the CECOT segment for weeks — felt an urgent need to pull the “60 Minutes” report just a day before it was set to air, after CBS News had already broadly promoted the segment.\n\t\n\n\t“The story presented very powerful testimony of abuse at CECOT, but that testimony has already been reported on by places like the [New York] Times,” she said, according to a source familiar with her remarks.\n\n\tWeiss continued, “The public knows that Venezuelans have been subjected to horrific treatment in this prison. So to run a story on this subject, two months later, we simply need to do more. And this is ’60 Minutes.’ We need to be able to make every effort to get the principles on the record and on camera.”\n\n\t“The only newsroom I’m interested in running is one in which we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest editorial matters with respect, and, crucially, where we assume the best intent of our colleagues. Anything else is absolutely unacceptable,” Weiss said. She also said, “To me, our viewers come first, not a listing schedule or anything else, and that is my North Star, and I hope it’s the north star of every person in this newsroom.’\n\n\tVariety has reached out to CBS News for additional comment.\n\n\tAlfonsi, in an email to CBS colleagues Sunday, said she saw Weiss’ decision to pull the CECOT story as motivated by political concerns, not journalistic ones.\n\n\t“Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” Alfonsi wrote in the message, first reported by the Wall Street Journal. “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”\n\n\tAlfonsi also wrote, “We have been promoting this story on social media for days. Our viewers are expecting it. When it fails to air without a credible explanation, the public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship. We are trading 50 years of ‘Gold Standard’ reputation for a single week of political quiet.”\n\n\tWeiss’ move to pull the CECOT piece came after President Trump had publicly complained about what he perceived was unfair treatment by “60 Minutes.” Last week, Trump blasted the Ellisons over “60 Minutes,” writing in a Dec. 16 post on his Truth Social account, “For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before. If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”\n\t\n\n\tTrump earlier had slammed Lesley Stahl’s “60 Minutes” interview that aired Dec. 7 with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia), the one-time Trump supporter who has recently been critical of the president on a range of issues. The president wrote on Truth Social that the “Trump-hating” Stahl interviewed “a very poorly prepared Traitor, who in her confusion made many really stupid statements.” Trump said, “My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low IQ traitor, it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP.” \n\n\tDavid Ellison’s Paramount Skydance has launched a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, attempting to convince shareholders to reject WBD’s deal with Netflix, which is set to acquire the Warner Bros. studios operations and HBO Max.\n\n\tAn M&A deal for Warner Bros. Discovery with either Paramount or Netflix would require approval from regulators including the U.S. Justice Department and FTC. Trump also has asserted that he would be “involved” in approving a deal.\n\n\tIn October, David Ellison announced a deal reportedly worth $150 million to acquire Weiss’ anti-woke outlet The Free Press and appointed Weiss as CBS News’ top editorial exec. Those moves were perceived as aimed at improving CBS News’ standing with Trump and the MAGA movement. \n\n\tIn her first on-air hosting gig for CBS News, Weiss on Dec. 13 moderated a “town hall” with Erika Kirk, the CEO of the conservative advocacy organization Turning Point USA and the widow of Charlie Kirk. Last week CBS News said it would launch series of similar events called “Things That Matter,” with guests slated to include VP JD Vance and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. “We believe that the vast majority of Americans crave honest conversation and civil, passionate debate,” Weiss said in announcing the town halls. “This series is for them.”\n",

They range from “Adolescence,” which was sparked by present-day toxic “incel” culture in the North of England and featured unknown local actors, to period pieces like “The Seduction,” starring Anamaria Vartolomei and Diane Kruger, that explores sexual manipulation as a survival tool for women navigating the 18th-century Paris patriarchy. There were also reality shows, like International Emmy-nominated “Love is Blind: Habibi” and “The Celebrity Traitors” which represented, as Ellise Shafer aptly puts it: “some of the best television of the year — point blank.”\n\n\tBelow are the year’s ten best international TV shows picked by Variety’s international team. They are not  listed in oder of importance, though “Adolescence” certainly merits the top slot.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAdolescence\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tAdolescence\t\n\n\tIf last year’s unexpected TV smash hit was “Baby Reindeer,” this year it was — by some considerable margin — “Adolescence.” Netflix’s one-shot mini-series — about a teenage boy accused of murdering a female classmate — blew almost everyone away within days of launch, lauded for its technical prowess, knockout performances and a deeply topical storyline. It swiftly began smashing global viewing records for Netflix, and has dominated the year’s awards shows since, with a bumper haul of Primetime Emmys, including one for then 15-year-old newcomer Owen Cooper, making him the youngest male winner in awards history. But that wasn’t all — its central theme about the dangers of social media on kids and the online manosphere became major talking points globally and sparked national debate in the U.K., where it was discussed in British parliament. As its writer Jack Thorne and director Philip Barantini recently acknowledged, wherever their careers go from here, they’ll likely never experience anything like “Adolescence” again.\n\n\tAlex Ritman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDead End\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Caviar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tWhat show are you likely to talk about to your family over a Christmas roast? If you’re aiming to spoil the lunch, most probably Flemish director Malin-Sarah Gozin’s “Dead End,” the most memorable title to screen at this year’s Canneseries. This dark comedy turns on sleuth Ed Bex who is able to glimpse a dead person’s final moments licking, or even better eating, a wee part of their corpse. He spends much of Ep. 2 trying to steal a toe belonging to murder victim 2 from out of the mortuary to get a little nibble. Like Gozin’s “Clan,” which was adapted into Apple TV hit “Bad Sisters” this is a genre-blending mash-up of comedic murder thriller and family drama which makes a serious point, here about animal food consumption. It’s produced by Belgium’s Caviar and Lompvis, and is part of Flanders’ remarkable TV surge which had more titles at Canneseries or The Wit’s Mipcom Fresh TV Fiction showcase than any other region or country in the world.   \n\n\tJohn Hopewell\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Caviar\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Seduction\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: HBO\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“The Seduction” isn’t just another adaptation of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s “Les Liaisons Dangereuses.” The six-part series, led by Anamaria Vartolomei and Diane Kruger, delivers a youthful, sexy and distinctly feminist take on the cult novel — an origin story charting the rise of de Merteuil, before her transformation into Valmont’s partner in crime. The HBO Original is directed by Jessica Palud, whose latest film, “Being Maria,” traced the journey of trailblazing artist Maria Schneider during the tumultuous shoot of Bernardo Bertolucci’s “Last Tango in Paris.” “The Seduction” reunites Palud with Vartolomei, who stars as the strong-willed de Merteuil. She is joined by Kruger (“Inglourious Basterds”) as her mentor, Madame de Rosemonde — Valmont’s aunt. Vincent Lacoste (“A Private Life”) plays a young Valmont, while Lucas Bravo, the breakout chef of “Emily in Paris,” embodies the morally corrupt libertine. The glossy 18th-century-set series shot at several châteaux around Paris. \n\n\tElsa Keslassy\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tToo Much\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Ana Blumenkron/Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Girls” creator Lena Dunham made her long-awaited return to television in July with “Too Much,” a semi-autobiographical Netflix rom-com series about heartbroken expat Jess (“Hacks” breakout Meg Stalter), who moves to London and falls into the arms of an emotionally stunted English musician named Felix (the charming Will Sharpe). It’s a tale as old as time, but Dunham simultaneously spins a fresh take while throwing it back to the glory days of Richard Curtis films with her witty writing, on-point references and all-too-relatable characters. Though the show won’t be returning for a second season, its (spoiler alert) town hall wedding ending makes it clear that Jess and Felix did get their happily ever after. Not all series are meant to run forever – and with Dunham now set up in a deal with Netflix, all eyes are on what she’ll come up with next. \n\n\tEllise Shafer\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAna Blumenkron/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBlack Warrant\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tNetflix’s Indian prison drama “Black Warrant” lands with the kind of authority that comes from a creator who knows how to turn institutional rot into gripping drama. Set inside Delhi’s notorious Tihar Jail, the series draws on the memoir of former superintendent Sunil Gupta and marks another uncompromising entry in Vikramaditya Motwane’s body of work, following “Udaan,” “Sacred Games” and “Jubilee,” all of which interrogated power, ambition and moral decay in very different milieus. Fronted by a coiled, quietly commanding Zahan Kapoor, “Black Warrant” resists easy shock tactics, instead zeroing in on the banal cruelty and negotiated ethics of prison life – where corruption is systemic and idealism a liability. The show’s impact has been underlined by multiple wins at the Asian Academy Creative Awards, cementing it as one of Netflix India’s most credible prestige plays in recent years rather than another algorithm-chasing crime entry.\n\n\tNaman Ramachandran\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Celebrity Traitors\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: BBC/Studio Lambert/E\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThough the U.S. has only ever done celeb-stacked renditions of whodunit reality show “The Traitors,” this year saw the format’s British originators finally give the concept a whirl. The result was some of the best television of the year — point blank. BBC’s “The Celebrity Traitors” exceeded expectations and broke ratings records by gifting us moments like Celia Imrie’s fart heard ‘round the world, sassy accusations courtesy of Olympian Tom Daley and Alan Carr’s surprisingly emotional winning speech, all hosted by the fabulous Claudia Winkleman. For a couple months, it felt like the country finally agreed on something — thank God it’s coming back next year. \n\n\tEllise Shafer\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLove is Blind:Habibi\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tNetflix scored a nomination in the 2025 International Emmy Awards in the Non-Scripted Entertainment category for “Love is Blind, Habibi,” the Arabic adaptation of its hit dating show. Filmed in Dubai and co-hosted by Saudi actress Elham Ali and her husband, Khaled Saqr, it features singles from the region – including Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Morocco, Iraq, and Kuwait, but living in the UAE – seeking love without being able to see their potential companion, as per the show’s format. But “Love is Blind: Habibi” stood out from its international counterparts by focusing more on family, showcasing the family’s participation in the engagement process, shared values, cultural traditions, no alcohol and an absence of physical intimacy in the initial stages that made for a refreshing approach for many viewers. It topped Netflix’s global top 10 most-watched non-English TV shows in its first two weeks attracting millions of viewers, highlighting a global appetite for Arab-focused reality TV.\n\n\tNick Vivarelli\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPerfect Days\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Globo\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tIn recent years, true crime has taken Brazil by storm. When it comes to fiction, however, no talent is so sought-after than novelist-screenwriter Raphael Montes who wrote HBO Max’s novela “Scars of Beauty” while Netflix is adapting his own novel “A Estranha na Cama.” Montes also saw Globoplay, Globo’s VOD service, adapt another novel in “Perfect Days.” A stylish, sex-boundary pushing – catch a great threesome in Ep. 1 – but rapidly darkening psychological abduction thriller plumbing the pathology of male narcissism, “Perfect Days” became Globoplay’s most-watched original series this summer. It also marks out star Julia Dalavia, helmer Joana Jabace (“Precious Pearl”) and writer Claudia Jouvin (“The Nightshifter,” and now working on Ron Leshem’s next) as talents to track and is a big win for Anonymous Content Brazil, the CAA-backed partnership between Rodrigo Teixeira’s RT Features and Anonymous Content.\n\n\tJohn Hopewell\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPortobello\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Max\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tRevered Italian auteur Marco Bellocchio reconstructs one of Italy’s most clamorous travesties of justice in this limited HBO series that launched from the Venice Film Festival and travelled to Toronto and Busan. “Portobello” delves into the true story of popular Italian TV host Enzo Tortora who, among other programs, conducted a primetime game show by the same title that aired on Italian state broadcaster RAI for seven seasons starting in 1977. Bellocchio’s series – which has been praised by the Guardian as being “potent and serious, mordantly funny and bitingly cynical” – is a vivid account of how Tortora, in 1985, went from being a top-rated TV star to being wrongly convicted of conspiring with the Neapolitan crime syndicate known as Camorra. Tortora is potently played by frequent Bellocchio collaborator Fabrizio Gifuni who starred as former Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro in Bellocchio’s previous limited TV series “Exterior Night,” about the 1978 kidnapping and assassination of the country’s leader by Red Brigades terrorists. “Portobello,” which is produced by Bellocchio’s Kavac Film in tandem with Mediawan-owned Our Films, will be the first HBO Original Italian production to launch on the HBO Max streaming platform, debuting in 2026.

An ode to empathy across the political divide directed with cinematographic flair by Alberto Rodríguez (“The Plague,” “Marshland”) including a mordant voiceover commentary, it shows these figures of “Shakesperian stature,” in Rodriguez’s words in all their grandeur, contradictions, flaws and final life pathos. “Anatomy” bowed Nov. 20 on Movistar Plus+ to become its most-watched original series ever, while winning every prize out in Spain. Produced with Banijay’s DLO Producciones, “Anatomy” is also early fruit of one of the most exciting TV production-distribution axes in Europe – between Movistar Plus+ and Arte France.  \n\n\tJohn Hopewell\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\t60+ Holiday Gifts Our Editors Love for 2025\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 50 Best Steakhouses in North America, According to a New Ranking\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst Riverside Abuse Trial Nears—and Evidence Takes Center Stage\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSue Nabi to Exit Coty and Be Succeeded by Markus Strobel\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt. I'm a little shocked. Like everyone's talking to me. I'm a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.\"\n      \n\n          When they asked him to identify himself, he responded with \"My name is 'Biggest Detroit Lions Fan Ever that got attacked by DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf.'\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Of course, that's not his name.

After Nicki's slip, Erika made light of the comment ... thankfully Erika laughed it off -- and by the looks of it, so did J.D.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Nicki Minaj\n              \n                          \n                J.D.

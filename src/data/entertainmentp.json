    "description": "\n\t“Two Little Nightmares,” directed by Oscar-nominated Croatian filmmaker Nebojša Slijepčević (“The Man Who Could Not Remain Silent”), and “Chentian,”",
    "body": "\n\t“Two Little Nightmares,” directed by Oscar-nominated Croatian filmmaker Nebojša Slijepčević (“The Man Who Could Not Remain Silent”), and “Chentian,” by renowned Palestinian screenwriter Suha Arraf (“Villa Touma”), are amongst the six films selected in competition at the sophomore edition of the Nordic Gateway programme. \n\n\tThe initiative is nested within the Göteborg Film Festival’s Nordic Film Market, Scandinavia’s biggest film emporium, taking place over Jan. 28-30.\n\t\n\n\tThe program, launched last year, highlights high-potential projects from renowned helmers and production companies to facilitate co-productions and financing possibilities. A competitive showcase, the Nordic Gateway awards its winner with a  €35,000 ($40,600) Tint Post-Production Award. This year’s projects come from Palestine, Germany, Croatia, Belgium and the U.K. \n\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety, Göteborg Film Festival Head of Industry Josef Kullengård said that the Nordic Gateway initiative was designed as a way of preserving the original roots of the Nordic Film Market, which was born out of a need to have a “platform where Nordic films can reach out to the world,” but has grown exponentially since its inception. \n\n\t“Nordic Gateway is about finding the projects that we believe are suitable for co-production with Nordics, but that also tick other boxes,” he added. “The variety [this year] is super interesting as well. I’m very pleased with the spectrum of the projects.”\n\n\tProjects selected for Gateway have been hand-picked by the industry team as opposed to selected through an open call. Certain entries also come in collaboration with key partners, as is the case this year with “Element,” a German production that was selected in collaboration with the European Audiovisual Entrepreneurs (EAVE), “Two Little Nightmares,” in partnership with CineLink and “Euro Pop Bubble” with Midpoint.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Chentian,” courtesy of Göteborg Film Festival\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAFP\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBelow, you will find profiles for the six projects selected for this year’s Nordic Gateway: \n\n\t“Chentian,” dir. Suha Arraf (Palestine)\n\n\tArraf is the screenwriter behind festival hits such as “The Syrian Bride” and “Lemon Tree.” Her 2014 directorial debut, “Villa Touma,” played at Venice. “Chentian,” produced by leading Palestinian producer May Odeh (“Aisha Can’t Fly Away,” “A Useful Ghost”), is fresh out of Marrakech’s prestigious Atlas Workshops and trails sisters-in-law Nabila and Sham to tell a story about women, marriage and desire during occupation. As the men disappear, the women must confront betrayal, power, and survival on their own terms. A co-production between Palestine’s Odeh Films and Germany’s Mayana Films.\n\n\t“Euro Pop Bubble,” dir. Grant Gulczynski (U.K.)\n\n\tGulczynski’s work has screened at major festivals such as CPH:DOX and Sarajevo, with the filmmaker having previously been selected for the Berlin Talent Campus and Midpoint Institute. “Euro Pop Bubble” finds British musician Fred spending a lonely Christmas in the aftermath of his boyfriend’s death. Fred’s grief is quickly complicated by jealousy and ambition when he decides to follow his late partner’s dream all the way to the finale of the Euro Pop Contest, going from his lonely Berlin bedroom to a big stage in Stockholm. Produced by Crystal Compass. \n\n\t“Alors on Danse,” dir. Pieter Van Hees (Belgium) \n\n\tSet in Brussels, the film follows Zoé and Ota, two young dancers from different worlds who are unexpectedly paired during a casting call. What starts as a thorny mess of clashing egos eventually blurs into love in what is described as “an energetic, youthful and romantic dance film.” Director and writer Van Hees has previously directed provocative genre cinema such as “Left Bank” and “Waste Land,” as well as working on television in projects such as “Versailles” and “Undercover.” Producer Roxanne Sarkozi tells Variety that “Alors on Danse” “feels like a fresh echo of Pieter Van Hees’ earlier work: the same sharp eye for relationships, but with a younger, brighter spark.” Produced by De Wereldvrede. \n\n\t“Element,” dir. Mariko Minoguchi (Germany)\n\t\n\n\tThis German sci-fi offering is set soon after a seaquake begins to drain the world’s water reserves. To save humankind, a geophysicist living with early-onset Alzheimer’s is recruited to investigate the vast void swallowing the oceans. Sent to a remote station, she must uncover the truth before it’s too late. “Element” is Minoguchi’s sophomore directorial effort, following 2018’s “Relativity,” which won the German Film Critics’ Award for best debut and best screenplay. Minoguchi also co-wrote “The Colony,” which premiered at the Berlinale and reached No. 1 on U.S. Netflix charts. Producer Jorgo Narges describes “Element” as “ambitious, high-concept sci-fi that speaks to a global audience.” Produced by X Filme Creative Pool (“The White Ribbon,” “Berlin Babylon”).\n\n\t“Our Sister Angela,” dir. Jascha Hannover and Katharina Warda (Germany) \n\n\tBerlin-based writer, speaker and filmmaker Katharina Warda and “The Books He Didn’t Burn” director Jascha Hannover join forces to tell the story of GDR, an enthusiastic solidarity movement for the Black U.S. civil rights activist Angela Davis that emerged in East Germany in the early 1970s. Produced by Germany’s Florianfilm in co-production with the U.K.’s Dare Pictures and U.S.-based La Lutta. Speaking with Variety, Warda says the film will be told “from the perspective of Black East Germans, a community that is almost invisible both in Germany and internationally.”\n\n\t“Two Little Nightmares,” dir. Nebojša Slijepčević (Croatia)\n\n\tSlijepčević’s 2024 short film “The Man Who Could Not Remain Silent” won the Palme d’Or at Cannes and the European Film Award for best short film, as well as being nominated for an Oscar in the same category. “Two Little Nightmares” tells the story of Matija, who at seven-years-old is inexplicably linked to a series of suicides in the small village where he grew up — including his father’s. Years later, the playwright uses his practice as well as long-buried memories to process his troubled past. A co-production between Antitalent, Contrast Films, Les Films Norfolk, Studio Virc and Sense Production.\n\n\tAnnika Pham contributed to this piece.\n",

    "body": "\n\tComedian John Mulaney has decided to postpone his shows in Minneapolis scheduled for this weekend in the light of Wednesday’s shooting by an ICE officer. The city has seen large demonstrations after an ICE officer shot and killed a local mother and poet, Renee Nicole Good, during a protest.\n\n\t“What’s happening in your city is heartbreaking,” Mulaney wrote on Instagram. “I hate to postpone shows in a town going through such awful challenges and such grief, because it feels unfair to the audience.”\n\t\n\n\tMulaney is currently touring his “Mr. Whatever” show and will continue Jan. 15 in St. Louis before heading to Seattle, New York and, after the rescheduled Minneapolis dates, on to London.\n\n\n\t“Still, I don’t feel comfortable asking thousands of people each night to leave their homes, gather at the venue, and then make their way home when the situation is so unsafe.\n\n\t“Tickets for this weekend will be honored for their respective days of Friday through Sunday, April 10th, 11th and 12th. For any questions or refunds, please contact your point of purchase or Ticketmaster.\n\n\t“I am sorry to anyone who is disappointed. I know a fun stand-up show could be a nice distraction, but it doesn’t sit right with me to put anyone at risk,” he concluded. \n\n\t“This was the right call,” one fan responded on his Instagram post. Another called on Mulaney to help the effort to get ICE out of Minneapolis, saying, “Please join us all in supporting our community by using your large platform to get ICE out of our city. Maybe once it’s safer, you’ll feel safer performing here again.”\n\t\n\n\tAt a Thursday demonstration against Good’s killing, protesters were met with tear gas, the New York Times reported. While some federal officials described the shooting as lawful, Minneapolis and Minnesota officials called those accounts “propaganda” and “garbage.” Protests in the city against the actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement have been continuing for weeks.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Heated Rivalry” star Robbie G.K. is speaking out about the show’s possible impact on professional hockey.\n\n\t“I certainly hope so,” he told me Wednesday at “The Pitt” Season 2 premiere in Los Angeles. “I think that big organizations like that, sports organizations, we’ve seen things in the past, specifically in the NFL, where there’s been these types of movements or things that are trying to create change, and I hope as much as [the NHL is] using this as leverage and from a marketing standpoint, they’re also taking internal notes and changing the atmosphere in change rooms and from an organizational standpoint.” (Watch the full interview in the video above.)\n\t\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry,” a show produced by Canadian streamer Crave and available in the U.S. on HBO Max, stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie as two pro hockey players who fall in love while having a secret 10-year affair. G.K. plays Kip, a juice bar barista who dates hockey player Scott Hunter, played by François Arnaud.\n\n\tIn the third episode of the series, Scott comes out of the closet by kissing Kip in the rink after his team has just won the Stanley Cup.\n\n\tG.K. says teams have invited him to their games: “The Vancouver Canucks reached out to me, which me and my roommates were losing our minds because we were talking about trying to get tickets. I think the New Jersey Devils reached out to me. It’s just insane, but I’m super stoked.”\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” is based on Game Changer, Rachel Reid’s series of queer hockey romance novels. While storylines for Season 2 have yet to be revealed by series creator Jacob Tierney, Reid told me last month that she hopes Scott and Kip will be featured more because of the couple’s popularity among the show’s fans.\n\t\n\n\t“I saw an interview with Jacob when he was talking about writing Season 2, and he said he’s going to turn his phone off, throw it away, because I’m sure everybody and their grandma has an opinion as to what should be in Season 2,” G.K. said.” I’m just sitting around. My fingers are crossed but I appreciate having Rachel in my corner because that’s exciting. I would love to be on it more.”\n\n\tG.K. was also happy to see that Miley Cyrus is up for contributing music in Season 2. “I was absolutely a ‘Hannah Montana’ fan,” he said, adding, “That’s what I grew up on. That’s the reason I got into acting and musical theater in the first place. To see something like that is surreal. I hope at some point to meet you in person, Miley.”\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” became an overnight hit shortly after the first two of its six episodes dropped on HBO Max over Thanksgiving weekend. G.K. said he’s being recognized more when he’s out in public. A flight attendant complimented him on the show during his flight from his hometown of Vancouver to Los Angeles. Also, at the airport, a fan handed him a “lovely letter that was very heartwarming.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe makers of Indian filmmaker Bejoy Nambiar’s survival thriller “Tu Yaa Main” have unveiled the film’s teaser, offering audiences their first glimpse at the edge-of-the-seat drama starring Adarsh Gourav and Shanaya Kapoor, set for a Valentine’s Day-adjacent release on Friday, Feb. 13.\n\n\tThe teaser plunges viewers into the world of two content creators from contrasting backgrounds who unite for a collaboration fueled by curiosity, social media clout and mutual attraction. What begins as an energetic adventure spirals into a deadly confrontation with a menacing crocodile, transforming their content creation mission into a desperate fight for survival.\n\t\n\n\tThe film marks a departure from traditional Bollywood Valentine’s Day fare by blending romance with high-octane danger. \n\n\n\tNambiar directs from a script by Abhishek Bandekar that speaks to contemporary youth culture, merging the world of digital content creation with primal survival stakes. The film is produced by Aanand L. Rai and Himanshu Sharma under their Colour Yellow banner, alongside Vinod Bhanushali and Kamlesh Bhanushali of Bhanushali Studios Limited.\n\n\tGourav broke through internationally with his BAFTA-nominated performance in Netflix’s “The White Tiger,” which also earned him an Independent Spirit Award nomination. The actor has since appeared in “Guns & Gulaabs,” “Kho Gaye Hum Kahan,” Toronto selection “Superboys of Malegaon,” and Apple TV’s “Extrapolations.” Most recently, he was in FX series “Alien: Earth,” playing the character Slightly in the prequel to Ridley Scott’s iconic sci-fi franchise. He made his acting debut as a teenager in Karan Johar’s “My Name Is Khan.”\n\t\n\n\tKapoor makes her second big screen appearance following her debut in “Aankhon Ki Gustaakhiyan,” released in 2025. \n\n\tNambiar, who earned acclaim for stylized thrillers “Shaitan” and “David,” most recently directed the bilingual action drama  – “Dange” in the Hindi language and “Por” in Tamil – in 2024. \n\n\tWatch the teaser here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tOliver Laxe’s “Sirât” is both ambitious and radical, according to the film’s composer and musician Kangding Ray.\n\n\t“Sirât” is Oscar shortlisted across numerous categories, including casting, cinematography, international feature, sound and original score.\n\n\tThe film follows Luis (Sergi López), a father, and his son Esteban (Brúno Nuñez), who arrive at a desert rave in the mountains of Morocco. They’re on a mission – going person to person among the ravers, handing out pictures of Luis’ daughter Mar, who vanished from one of the raves over five months ago.\n\t\n\n\tTheir hope begins to fade, and they trek across the desert to one last party.\n\n\tAmid it all, Ray’s techno score is a character unto itself with the first sonic beats thumping through the speakers for close to 17 minutes. As the characters face danger and the emotional anguish mounts, the score shifts into an ambient vibe. It was that shift that Ray admits was the most challenging to nail down.\n\n\tHere, Ray spoke with Variety about coming on early to the film and scoring music to the script rather than the picture and creating a techno-driven score.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was it about the script that inspired you to be a part of it?\t\n\n\tIt was very clear that it was an ambitious project and also a radical one. This is my kind of film; it works on different levels and doesn’t explain things too much. It really pushes the envelope in many ways.\n\n\tWhen Oliver sent me the script, I was really hooked. I had a few reservations, of course, because I thought he was going very far in certain things, and even for my standards, but I trusted Oliver and his vision.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYour background is in techno and experimental music. Was that the directive Oliver gave you?\t\n\n\tThe film starts with a 17-minute rave. So obviously, the techno element had to be a big part of that. But to me, that part was the easiest part to compose because this is what I do. Finding the right tone and texture was easy.\n\n\tWhen the music dissolves into an ethereal, ambient soundscape and a psychedelic, spiritual journey, that’s where finding the right amount of energy, aggression, violence, and grief, to support the story and to explain things that the dialog couldn’t, was the most challenging part. It was also the most rewarding.\n\t\n\t\tThe score is a character and you feel this shift as it goes from thumping energy to that ambient sound, how did you navigate getting it right and timing it so that transition works?\t\n\n\tWe worked on the pacing many times. The pacing and key were key to making it work. I wanted to have a gradual dissolution, but at the same time, there are a number of shocks happening in this movie. They’re on a trip, and everything is fine, and then something happens and it becomes a nightmare. (The characters enter a minefield, and one of the main characters, Jade, is killed in an explosion).\n\n\tYou need to express those changes, which was the hardest cue to compose. I couldn’t find anything big enough or hard enough or violent enough or wide enough to express what just happened. But eventually, with research, I ended up layering things and made this giant monster that implies the scale of the desert. That’s what brought me back. This is a story of people, but it’s a story which is much bigger than them, it’s a universal story.\n\t\n\t\tWe’ve previously spoken about the sound of the desert and how there are elements of sand and even wind in the score. How did you achieve that?\t\n\n\tThe great thing with working with electronic music is that it’s a very abstract medium. You don’t have a preconceived idea of what you’re going to end up with. I work directly with modular synthesizers, so you select your sound source, and you mix the waveforms. It’s like working with the fabric of the sound itself. It’s not working as like with an instrument where you direct it. The good thing is you don’t put values on what is supposed to be music, and what is supposed to be not music. So all these natural sounds can become a source of inspiration, but also a sonic source in itself.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a beautiful marriage of sound and score in this film. How did you work with Laia Casanova, the film’s sound designer?\t\n\n\tLaia did a lot of recordings, and she had a very puristic approach to recording. She recorded the sounds of the rattles and tried to get the sound of the voices in the rave. She recorded in analog with microphones, and so it became quite easy to blend with the score.\n\t\n\t\tSince you scored the script, did it change much once you saw the film or got scenes?\t\n\n\tA little bit, but we were quite surprised that it was working. Oliver says often that the shoot was a really well execution of the script. Maybe 10 to 20% had to be tweaked or redone. But we had the desert in mind all the time, to give this continuity.\n\t\n\t\tJade has a great line when she says, “music’s not for listening, it’s for dancing.” What does that mean to you as a musician?\t\n\n\tIt’s a great line, because it’s a moment where they realize that they don’t come from the same culture. Luis is frankly annoyed by this type of music. But at that moment when she says this, he says, ‘Oh, that’s what my daughter was always saying.’ At that moment he never he felt really close to her, but he suddenly understands that music has a function. Music was about having a good time or having something harmless playing in the background, but for his daughter and for people of his culture, it’s about something much bigger. It’s something about discovering them yourself on the dance floor with your friends or your community.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Season 2 premiere of “The Pitt,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tThe first season of “The Pitt” too",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Season 2 premiere of “The Pitt,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tThe first season of “The Pitt” took off in a way that nobody expected — but the daunting question then became how to top it in Season 2. Luckily, its star and executive producer Noah Wyle recalls, director/EP John Wells told him and creator R. Scott Gemmill, “You don’t have to be bigger, better, faster, stronger, funnier, bloodier. You just have to be faithful to the characters that you’ve established and say, who are they 10 months on the other side of this mass casualty event?”\n\t\n\n\tFrom that, a new 15 hours, 10 months later, was born. As the shift kicks off at 7 a.m. on July 4, Wyle’s Dr. Robby heads into work for his last shift ahead of a three-month sabbatical, a trip in which he’s set to ride his motorcycle up to Alberta. (He drives it to work helmetless, passing an ambulance on a bridge, in what may be an act of foreshadowing.)\n\n\n\t“It was important to say Robby can’t pretend he doesn’t have a problem anymore,” says Wyle of the trip. “We wanted to show what that looks like when you know you need help, but you don’t really want it. You don’t really know how to ask for it, and what you want is a quick fix and to be told when you’re going to be better. It’s easier to compartmentalize than it is to open Pandora’s box with no guarantees that this is ever going to work. So that was really what I was curious about playing with — that form of denial takes on many faces.”\n\n\tRobby’s motorcycle trip, which his colleagues roll their eyes about, is one manifestation of that denial. “Instead of sticking with therapy, you decide you’re going to go fix up an old motorcycle and take a very romantic, literary journey to go find yourself,” Wyle says. “These are maybe avoidance techniques and maybe therapeutic techniques. And as the season wears on, we start to look at all of these choices and motivations a little bit more carefully for everybody, not just Robby,. I think if I were going to plant a seed in the viewers’ minds, I would say, look at what everybody’s showing you — this is what they want to show you at work right now. This is what we want to present and project as who we are. But whether that is really who we are, whether we can maintain that composure over 15 hours straight, is going to be interesting to see.”\n\t\n\n\tThrowing a wrench into that plan is the new attending physician in the Pitt, Dr. Al-Hashimi (Sepideh Moafi), who will step in to lead the day shift when he’s away. Not only does she have a different way of thinking, but also has no spatial boundaries — something that was very intentional.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWarrick Page/MAX\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“We did want her to be a bit of a close target, but it also dovetailed with this thing I’ve been playing with Robby for since we started — which is that he doesn’t really like being touched. He occasionally will touch somebody else or put his arm around somebody, but when it happens to him, he usually recoils away from it,” says Wyle. “So when you’re put in a situation with a character who has no spatial boundary, and it’s somebody who doesn’t really like to be encroached upon, it physically manifests itself in awkwardness and all sorts of interesting behavior. Dr. Al-Hashimi is a perfect foil for where Robby’s at right now, because he’s going to be giving her his baby to take care of in his absence, and he doesn’t like your parenting style, and that’s really an awkward place to be.”\n\n\tGemmill agrees, and adds: “Robby is trying to distance himself — literally — from her, and she is constantly in his space, so it’s just to make him even more uncomfortable, to up the stakes a little bit.”\n\n\tHer take — she’s “very much into modern medicine, and trying to implement AI into the emergency department,” says Wells — creates “a bit of friction” with not only Robby, but other doctors in the room as well.\n\n\tThe premiere also features Dr. Langdon (Patrick Ball) returning to work after months in rehab after he was caught stealing drugs during last season. Dr. Robby spent the first hour of their shift avoiding him — but that can’t last forever.\n\n\t“For both of their health, sense of closure and peace of mind, they need to get real with each other. Fifteen hours is a very short period of time in which to accomplish something as large as that,” says Wyle. “Fifteen hours is not really that much time for people to radically change an opinion. It’s just enough to plant a seed and start to have it germinate — positive, negative, fearful, tearful, tragic. These are all things that we start in one place, and we get to another, but they’re kind of micro journeys.”\n\t\n\n\tFor the producers, they wanted to display the “realities of recovery” with Langdon’s return and show how it affects everyone involved.\n\n\t“Langdon feels he’s done something, and he’s worked hard at it, and it was difficult. He’s not really expecting a parade, but at the same time, he’s expecting to be acknowledged for how difficult that was and how hard it was on his family — not working and damaging, possibly to his career,” says Wells. “Others are just [thinking], we had to work twice as hard to fill in for you that entire time. In Robby’s case, he was his protege. He loved him and respected him, and felt very betrayed. So I think showing the realities of how difficult recovery is, and at the same time, how you shouldn’t have expectations that everyone’s going to accept you having done that recovery, is very important.”\n\n\tSantos (Isa Briones) and Langdon will also have to work together, eventually, but have yet to communicate since she reported his drug issue.\n\n\t“There’s a lot of hard feelings and unresolved feelings in between those two,” says Gemmill. “She’s trying to be avoidant, partially because she doesn’t know how she’s going to react. Ultimately, he will make an overature, but I’m not sure how well it’s going to be received by her.”\n\n\t“The Pitt” airs on HBO Max Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 27th edition of the Göteborg Festival’s Nordic Film Market, taking place over Jan. 28 – 30, is readying for a starry edition, welcoming new projects by “Sami Blood” director Amanda Kernell (“Brace Your Heart”), Ulaa Salim (“Candy Kings”) and “Quisling” helmer Erik Poppe (“Beloved”), among many more. \n\n\tMay el-Toukhy, known for “Queen of Hearts,” will bring “Woman, Unknown,” produced by Mikael Rieks for Nordisk Film Production. Norway’s up-and-coming Rikke Gregersen (“Requiem for Selina”) will have titles in both Discovery and the Works in Progress sections, while Alex Schulman will present “Once in The Archipelago.”\n\t\n\n\t“Schulman is very well known to the Swedish audience: he’s a writer and podcaster. It’s one of the titles that I believe will resonate both with audiences and with the festivals. Our priority is always to have distinct voices, and we really try to have a strong blend between newcomers and senior directors, but also films that are not only festival films but do have a clear target audience and commercial ambition,” noted Nordic Film Market head Josef Kullengård.\n\n\n\tAt the Discovery Co-Production Platform – promoting feature films in development – Dag Johan Haugerud will follow his acclaimed “Sex/Love/Dreams” trilogy with “Light and Shadows,” produced by Yngve Sæther for Motlys. Frida Kempff will present “Swine.”\n\n\t“‘Swine’ is about what happens when women are reduced to surfaces and functions,” observed Kempff, known for “Knocking” and “The Swedish Torpedo.”\n\n\t“By working with body horror and black comedy, I want to make a film that is confrontational, sensual and uncomfortable, without asking for permission. Genre becomes a way to be brutally honest.” \n\t\n\n\tAction thriller “The Silver of Egill,” directed by Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurðsson, as well as August Joensalo’s “This Body Is My Final Address,” produced by Emilia Haukka for Finland’s Aamu Film Company, are among other highlights. \n\n\t“We are thrilled to be launching ‘The Silver of Egill’ at the Nordic Film Market. This is a really exciting script, set in contemporary Iceland, that casts new light on the Icelandic sagas and the origin of the Icelandic people, which strongly resonates with the wild political climate of our time,” said Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurðsson, also behind “Under the Tree” and “Either Way,” later remade as “Prince Avalanche.”\n\n\t“It’s an unexpected take on the adventure thriller. Or as we prefer to call it, a Viking spin on ‘The Da Vinci Code’.”\n\n\tBloody genre offerings will also be represented thanks to Elin Grönblom’s “Bloodsuckers,” Ilja Rautsi’s “Red Snow” and “Vampyre,” directed by Arild Fröhlich.\n\n\t“It’s been a pleasure to be able to show such variety of films and to have more genre-flirting films than we usually do: both with ‘Red Snow’ and ‘Bloodsuckers,’ which we had in the Discovery lineup last year,” noted Kullengård, calling it a “very elevated horror film.”\n\n\tOverall, this year’s line-up features 15 completed Nordic market screenings, 19 Works in Progress and 16 films in development alongside six titles showcased in the Nordic Gateway: “Alors on Danse,” “Chentian,” “Element,” “Euro Pop Bubble,” “Our Sister Angela – Black Power in the GDR” and “Two Little Nightmares.” \n\n\tMany NFM projects return to the festival later on. That includes past Works in Progress titles “Redoubt,” “Weightless,” “The Last Resort” and “The Love That Remains,” all part of this year’s lineup.  \n\n\t“It’s a beautiful cycle: we want Göteborg to be part of the entire journey of Nordic creators and projects, from engaging with emerging talent at Nordic film schools to premiering a debut film within the festival program. To be able to tie that circle together is something we are very proud of,” Kullengård added.\n\n\t“Göteborg is the place where people come to meet with the Nordics.”\n\n\tOr with two-time Cannes Palme d’Or winner Ruben Östlund himself. The director of “The Square” and “Triangle of Sadness” will surely generate quite a few headlines thanks to an exclusive on-stage conversation about his upcoming seventh feature “The Entertainment System Is Down.” \n\t\n\n\t“The idea with this session is to dive into the production journey and artistic ambition of the project. It will be a case study, not a work in progress. Ruben is the Honorary President [of the Göteborg Film Festival], so it’s a way of getting our attendees to get closer to his artistic brilliance,” said Kullengård.\n\n\tAdditional reporting by Annika

    "body": "\n\tDame Helen Mirren was honored with the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille Award during “Golden Eve” on Thursday evening, a kickoff show to Sunday’s Golden Globes ceremony.\n\n\tHarrison Ford served as the presenter for the honor, a perfect selection due to their longstanding relationship. The pair first worked together in 1986’s “The Mosquito Coast.” They then reunited nearly 40 years later for Taylor Sheridan’s “1923.”\n\n\n\tDuring his introduction, Ford said that when thinking of Mirren, “the word that comes to mind is not Dame — it’s badass.”\n\t\n\n\t“Helen Mirren can play a badass because she is one,” he continued. “A badass is raw, authentic, formidable, tough and fearless. That pretty much describes Helen the woman, and Helen the artist, an undeniable screen presence who brings to every scene a powerful commitment to narrative and character, and when she goes full badass, it’s awesome to watch.”\n\n\tAfter a montage of her work played on screen, he continued. “She’s been the Queen of England on screen, but she is truly majestic in everything that she does. And I for one,” he said, backing away from the microphone and bowing down. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHarrison Ford and Helen Mirren in “The Mosquito Coast”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMirren has won three Golden Globes during her illustrious career, but it was the first two she called out early on in her acceptance speech.\n\n\t“This organization has held a little piece of my heart, as it was the very first organization in America to give me an award. As eccentric as that group was, they noticed a small piece called ‘Losing Chase’ that was way under the radar, and gave me a beautiful golden ball. Then they followed it with another, and I was the proud owner of two large balls, which, as you can imagine, really helped me in my career,” Mirren told the room, which erupted in laughter. “The DeMille Award was described to me as a career recognition, but I prefer to think of it as a life lived, a life survived, a life enjoyed, a life sweated, and a life carried on hopefully. And given that hope, I prefer to think of this as an ongoing reflection of my career, rather than a eulogy. I’m not writing my own eulogy. Although I have to say, if this were my memorial, looking out at this audience, I’m absolutely thrilled who showed up for me, and I am making a list of the no-shows.”\n\t\n\n\tThroughout her speech, Mirren referred to many qualities she admired from the people she’d worked with over the years, including “the wit of Ryan Reynolds, the generosity of Will Smith, the intensity of [Anthony] Hopkins, the embrace of Vin Diesel, the might of Harrison Ford, the kindness of Bruce Willis and the greatness of [Al] Pacino.”\n\n\tShe also acknowledged the many lessons she’d learned — including “how to follow the great advice of the great Victor Mature, which is how to master speaking whilst holding your tummy in. Actually, come to think of it, that advice is no longer needed, is it really now, because you know, Spanx and Ozempic.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBackstage at the benefit that took place Wednesday night under the name A Concert for Altadena, star and co-organizer Taylor Goldsmith of Dawes was talking about how he came close to thinking it was not necessarily vital to hold the concert exactly on the first anniversary of the devastating fires of Jan. 7, 2025.\n\n\t“You know, I was saying today I’m so glad we did,” said Goldsmith, as the sold-out show was beginning at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. “Because initially I thought, ‘Oh, should we just do it on the Friday that week, to help people get here?’ But I mean, I’ve found myself, even, emotionally processing in ways that feel like this show’s gonna be all the more potent. If we had we done it on Friday, I feel like it just wouldn’t be necessarily living in us the way it is right at this moment.” \n\t\n\n\tAt one point in the nearly four-hour show, host John C. Reilly stopped to acknowledge that there were members of the community who might have wanted to be among the 3,000-strong audience members, but who skipped out on buying tickets (or accepting the gratis ones offered to some fire victims) because it would have been too traumatic to see footage of the fire or its aftermath, or hear the recounting of the devastation and 19 deaths. It was the rare concert where a moment was given to respect for those who opted out of coming.\n\n\n\tFor Goldsmith, whose family lost part or all of three Altadena homes in the fire, all these emotions were encouraged and expected. “I think people want to have a good time, but I do think catharsis plays a massive role,” he said, “I think people are expecting to have to hold each other, but maybe also encourage a little bit of these (tougher) emotions. This is gonna be a space for that, whether it’s cheering or singing or crying. And I think a lot of these songs speak to kind of giving that opportunity.”\n\t\n\n\tAnyone who came just for known bangers, based on the featured billing, did not leave disappointed. Brandon Flowers of the Killers was saved for a climactic spot in the proceedings for a reason, capping off a rousing “When We Were Young” with an even more rabble-rousing cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “The Promised Land.” Stephen Stills stood energized the many boomers on hand and their progeny with versions of “For What It’s Worth” and “Love the One You’re With” that featured fellow guitar gunslinger Brad Paisley. Everclear brought the vintage KROQ energy with a full mini-set of alt-rock perennials. And those moments were the tip of the iceberg for a night that found standing ovations given to songs and artists that were not as recognizable to everyone in the house, like the leaps to stand up and applaud that followed vocally stunning performances by Lucius and Judith Hill.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrandon Flowers performs at ‘A Concert for Altadena’ at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNikki Phillips/First III No Flash\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe evening raised more than $450,000, its producers announced Thursday., earmarked for the Altadena Builds Back Foundation (ABBF), a charity that was formed last April under the wing of the 70-year-old Pasadena Community Foundation. Speaking early in the program, Jennifer DeVoll, executive director of the ABBF, talked about the grants the org has already given out this past year, much of which has gone toward building homes, through organizations like Habitat for Humanity. Intensely local groups like the Black Freedom Fund and Altadena Girls will also benefit from the proceeds.\n\n\tThere has been controversy over the dispersal of fundraising since the fire, which was on Goldsmith’s mind as he and his fellow organizers decided who would benefit from Wednesday’s show. “That kind of suspicion or concern was what really went into us making these decisions,” he said backstage. “And so when we came across Altadena Builds Back Foundation, that was working with Habitat for Humanity, and then visiting some of the properties and seeing firsthand what they were doing for these families, it made us feel like this is the right, this is the right foundation to bring. That’s what this whole thing’s for, so we weren’t gonna just not think it through in any detail.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDawes performs at ‘A Concert for Altadena’ at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNikki Phillips/First III No Flash\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGoldsmith, who lost a home studio and all his equipment in the fire, was standing in a group with several other people who suffered property losses of their own, including his brother, Dawes drummer Griffin Goldsmith. (The brothers’ parents also lost their home.) Co-organizer Eric Krasno, a guitar great who later that night would deliver a pitch-perfect “Voodoo Chile,” was another in this circle, along with fellow guest performer Aloe Blacc, who would soon thrill the crowd with a signature song, “Wake Me Up.”\n\t\n\n\t“My kids lost their school,” said Blacc. “The students from Pasadena Waldorf Choir are singing tonight.” In fact, that’s what Taylor Goldsmith, Krasno and Blacc had in common: children at that school. “Many of my friends and many of the teachers at the school lost homes. And I lost a couple of properties, though it wasn’t my main home. So I have to stand and support as many people as possible spreading the word. Since the fires, I’ve met up with a lot of organizations and foundations to donate, and then linked them with local organizations that they could get the money to. Because money was going to, in my opinion, some organizations that were not distributing properly. If I could be diplomatic.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAloe Blacc and Brandon Flowers perform at ‘A Concert for Altadena’ at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNikki Phillips/First III No Flash\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs Blacc hinted at, there is more than a little anger to go around about what happened before, during and since the fires, along with the sorrow and thousand other emotions. This primarily celebratory night wasn’t about that… or mostly wasn’t about it; a little feistiness bubbled up from time to time, especially when host Reilly went off-script for some impromptu remarks about the power company and President Trump that got much of the crowd whooping in appreciation.\n\n\tNoting that he was being prompted to “riff” between musical setups, Reilly — who was also displaced by the Altadena fire — took on Southern California Edison. “I want to point out that many people are calling these fires, wildfires. And they were wild…. Those Santa Anas made those fires wild. But those fires did not start naturally. Those fires started because of Southern California Edison. … By the way, I saw what you offered, Southern California Edison, to our survivors — you could go fuck yourselves.”\n\n\tIt wasn’t just Trump and the power company drawing the ire of the otherwise good-humored actor. “2025, you can kiss my ass,” he blurted, extending his rear end.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn C. Reilly hosts ‘A Concert for Altadena’ at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNikki Phillips/First III No Flash\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe idea that a historically mixed-race and mixed-class neighborhood might be rebuilt as a very different kind of community came up in the speech of activist Heavenly Hughes, one of the subjects of the currently Oscar-shortlisted short film “All the Walls Came Down.” A chant was led: “Altadena is not for sale.”\n\t\n\n\tBut for much of the night, the mood was lighter, if not giddy at times. That’s inevitable for any night that has Ozomatli performing in the first half-hour and dispersing through the aisles — right on the heels of the aforementioned kids’ choir performance. After the requisite turnout of local speakers, the stage was turned over to Everclear, whose Art Alexakis made sure the twin fire above the other end of the Los Angeles basin was not forgotten in the Altadena/Pasadena focus.\n\n\t“This goes out to all our brothers and sisters in Pacific Palisades,” said Alexakis., introducing the song “Santa Monica.” “I grew up in Santa Monica on the poor side of town in a place called Ocean Park, which a lot of people call Dogtown. Pacific Palisades is what you aspire to, right? And just seeing the damage there just breaks my heart. But I gotta tell you… I aspired Altadena, and I didn’t even know it.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEverclear performs at ‘A Concert for Altadena’ at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNikki Phillips/First III No Flash\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTalking backstage before the show, Goldsmith said he couldn’t forecast any highlights, but once he was out on stage, he let his bias show. “I’m not above saying that this next guest is my favorite guest of the whole batch,” he told the crowd. “This is the person that actually helped guide my family through the whole experience… this person I love more than anything in the world. This is Mandy Moore.” For anyone who was listening to Top 40 instead of KROQ in 1999, Goldsmith’s wife was also able to take the crowd back, with a slightly more rocking version of her breakout hit “Candy.”\n\n\tDawes’ own contributions to the night, apart from serving as backing band for most of the performers in the second half, included reprising “I Love L.A.,” which they played at the 2025 Grammys with Paisley, as they did here — somehow resisting what had to have been an impulse to insert Lake Ave. somewhere into Randy Newman’s sacred text. The Goldsmith brothers touched on the theme of hope for something lasting amid impermanence in a more mirth-skirting way with their anthem “All Your Favorite Bands.” (Again, if you wanted to sing it as “may all your favorite towns stay together,” that was up to you.) They erred, if anything, on the side of not overloading the show with very much actual Dawes material, but their most anthemic song, “When My Time Comes,” was a given for the penultimate spot, followed only by a full-cast sing-along of “With a Little Help From My Friends” to close out the night.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLucius performs at ‘A Concert for Altadena’ at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNikki Phillips/First III No Flash\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLucius’ Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig were MVPs, as they often are at shows like this, generously supporting other artists with world-class background vocals as well as performing just a taste of their own material. Among their key support moments was aiding Goldsmith in a perfect reading of Pink Floyd’s “Shine on You Crazy Diamond” — something that was done on a joint Dawes/Lucius tour a few years ago, and of course was a staple of the shows back when the women were touring with Roger Waters. For their own part, they bought down the house — or brought it up — with “Dusty Trails,” the Lucius number that is most guaranteed to instantly make fans with a subdued opening eventually rising to sudden high harmonies no one sees coming until they are infiltrating your nervous system.\n\n\tPasadena native Judith Hill’s “Cry Cry Cry” had a similar way of surprising an unsuspecting audience, both for the crescendo of her vocals and her ability to suddenly switch from powerhouse singer to electric guitar shredder without losing a step. Similar dexterity was found in the voice and hands of Krasno, another audience favorite, whose reference in his Hendrix cover to “stand(ing) up next to a mountain” fit in well with a neon backdrop of mountain ridges meant to evoke the San Gabriel Mountains.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEdith Hill performs at ‘A Concert for Altadena’ at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNikki Phillips/First III No Flash\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEric Krasno performs at ‘A Concert for Altadena’ at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNikki Phillips/First III No Flash\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJenny Lewis, singing with Goldsmith on harmony, gave voice in song to some of the spicier sentiments that some of the speakers brought with her song “Rise Up With Fists!!” Rufus Wainwright lent the most dulcet tones imaginable to the Beatles’ “Across the Universe,” which got an extra kick when Griffin Goldsmith added a healthy backbeat to the normally not-so-percussive tune halfway through. Lord Huron’s contribution to the evening was a cover of the underrated Kinks song “Strangers,” with Ray Davies’ appropriate unity theme no worse for the wear 55 years on.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRufus Wainwright and Taylor Goldsmith of Dawes perform at ‘A Concert for Altadena’ at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNikki Phillips/First III No Flash\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJenny Lewis and Dawes perform at ‘A Concert for Altadena’ at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNikki Phillips/First III No Flash\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAlthough rain was not the theme of the evening, dealing from depression was, in part — which made Paisley’s and Goldsmith’s duet of their original song “Raining Inside” one of the major knockouts of the evening. Their sole public co-write to date kind of quietly came out as a one-off single under Paisley’s name 10 months ago, and getting the rare chance to hear them sing it together was in itself a possible cure for the blues.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrad Paisley performs at ‘A Concert for Altadena’ at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNikki Phillips/First III No Flash\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBackstage, Goldsmith had navigated a question about how the devastation that ripped homes and studios away from his family had affected his psyche over the past year. There is a gentle stoicism to his public persona, although his music erupts from reflectiveness into passion. Although he projects a kind of zen calm more often than not, which is an especially useful quality as an organizer and band leader, he acknowledged his reaction to the fires is a work in progress, philosophically as well as emotionally.\n\n\t“It’s tough, because I always want to be honest with myself and my emotional state and let my feelings hit me and address them the ways I need to. But at the same time, I feel like my emotional state is something that I manifest. So sometimes I don’t want to enlarge too much” the reliving of negative feelings. “But today, I have allowed that. I have watched old videos of the next morning after the fire. And it’s good for me. But I refuse to let it make me go dark, to make me bitter. I know it’s gonna change me, but I just don’t want it to change me in those ways. There’s still a lot of kind of wrestling with it to make sure it’s not gonna have more of a influence on who I am than I want it to.”\n\n\tAfter the event was over at the Pasadena Civic, a few dozen VIP guests and sponsors moved a couple of blocks over to the Altadena Girls facility for an after-party. Even there, the talent chosen had more than a professional reason for being there. The DJ for the occasion was Jeffrey Paradise, who performs as Poolside. He, too, lost his home in the fire, escaping with his girlfriend, his blind senior dog and little else. \n\n\t“I feel lucky to be a part of it, but it is emotional, to be honest, to revisit losing all my stuff and my house,” said Paradise, before going out to do his DJ set. “But it’s a bit cathartic being around others who have done the same and celebrate in the midst of suffering. I just went up to my land with my burned out house a couple days ago, and the sunset was beautiful, and I was just like, fuck, I see why I fell in love with this.” He recently sold his vacant lot for what he considered a rock-bottom price. “We were underwater, and even all of our insurance money to our mortgage company was still not enough. And al my neighbors are stuck dealing with permitting issues. I miss my house and I wish I was rebuilding, but I’m also very glad to feel like a new book has been pulled off the shelf. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I’m glad to be a part of revisit this awareness, with people reaching out and supporting one another. It’s still just as present as ever for most people who have lost everything. But there’s a good sides of losing everything in that you see how the really good side of humanity has come out in certain ways. I’ve thought we should behave more like there’s a fucking disaster in our everyday life. We’d all be a lot more at peace.”\n\n\tAnd with that, Paradise went out to spin an incongruous but apropos dance remix, of Nicolette Larson singing “It’s gonna take a lotta love, to get us through the night…”\n",

According to Gale, Palm Beach is the richest zip code in the world and operates by a strict code of etiquette, discretion, and philanthropy -- standards she says the new women simply don’t meet.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          She points out that several of them aren’t even from Palm Beach -- which she believes explains why their behavior doesn’t reflect the town’s traditional elegance -- and as someone deeply involved in charity work and board leadership, Gale says she hoped the show would spotlight established Palm Beach women who are pillars of the community.\n      \n    \n          Instead, she takes aim at the younger cast members, noting that none of them serve on boards or are meaningfully involved in charitable organizations ... a key marker of status and respectability in Palm Beach society.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Gale also reveals she stepped away from her involvement with the Red Cross due to concerns over how reality TV editing could impact her reputation, underscoring just how seriously she takes her public image and community standing.\n      \n    \n          While she admits she had a ball filming the show and understands why audiences love watching the train wreck ... Gale says the elegance line has been crossed and claims she’s been bullied by the other women ... something she says she hasn’t experienced since childhood.\n      \n    \n          Gale tells TMZ the producers allegedly confirmed to her that she was being bullied, and Gale believes the tension may stem from the fact that she wasn’t a main cast member, didn’t receive confessionals, and didn’t know the women before filming.\n      \n    \n          Despite the drama, Gale insists every cast member has a beautiful story worth telling ... but when it comes to Palm Beach, she says elegance isn’t optional.\n      \n      ",

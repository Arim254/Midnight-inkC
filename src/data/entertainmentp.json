    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 5, Volume 1 of “Stranger Things.”\n\n\tNot even on the fantastical “Stranger Things” can Karen Wheeler kill a Demogorgon while armed only with her super-charged maternal protectiveness and a broken wine bottle. But she sure did try.\n\n\tKaren — the perpetually bewildered, out-of-the-loop mom of Mike, Nancy and Holly Wheeler, played since Season 1 by Cara Buono — finally is clued into the existence of Hawkins’ deadly other dimension when no less than a Demogorgon enters her home, hellbent (literally) on stealing her youngest child, Holly (Nell Fisher). Though she’s been drinking all night, and is intent on taking a nice, relaxing bath, Karen snaps into focus, desperate to save Holly. As the ABBA song “Fernando” plays, Karen holds Holly under the water of her bubble bath, disguising them. Then, in the kitchen, Karen pushes Holly away from the Demogorgon, breaks a wine bottle and determinedly says, “Stay away from my daughter!,” emphasizing every word. She then goes wild, stabbing away at the other-worldly creature. But Karen can’t win: By the time Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) get to the Wheeler house, she’s been mauled, nearly to death, as the Demo fulfills his orders to take Holly to the Upside Down.\n\n\tBuono has had a long, fruitful career, in theater, film and on television, where she’s appeared in such shows as “The Sopranos,” “Person of Interest,” “The Girl From Plainville” and many more. On “Mad Men,” she played the formidable Dr. Faye, who sees Don Draper for who he is, meaning that in the end, he couldn’t deal with her at all — but Buono was nominated for an Emmy for guest actress in a drama for the role.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJoe Chrest as Ted Wheeler and Cara Buono as Karen Wheeler \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSince July 2016, Buono has played Karen, the stalwart but thwarted Wheeler mom on “Stranger Things.” Karen has always been on the periphery of the show’s action, with her children Mike and Nancy constantly heading into danger without her knowledge. Until “Stranger Things 5,” the Wheeler home has been a sanctuary for the kids and their friends, with its basement serving as a safe space and headquarters. Even if she’s dissatisfied with her marriage and her life — which manifested in her lusting after Billy, the doomed teenage lifeguard in Season 3 — Karen is there to cook for everyone, and hug them when they’re hurt and scared. “The show has been like a decade of my life, right?” Buono says. “Professionally and emotionally, as a mom — it’s rare to be part of something that long that’s become a cultural heartbeat. It did this impossible thing of touching people all over the world. I meet people from all over the world, and they relate to it.”\n\n\n\tHere, Buono reflects on her time on “Stranger Things” — getting the role, her backstory for Karen (“She’s a functioning alcoholic!”) and getting to kick ass for the first time in five seasons. The ass-kicking was especially gratifying after all this time, she says, and she especially delighted in reading a Season 5 script and seeing that creators Matt and Ross Duffer had written “Karen fucking Wheeler” in the stage directions. “It was just so fun,” Buono says, “with the whole cast and crew clapping.” \n\n\tAnd disclosure: Buono and I knew each other a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tHi!\t\n\n\tAre we allowed to talk as people who’ve known each other?\n\t\n\t\tI think so! I mean, I’m going to disclose that I’ve known you — let’s just say we knew each other in New York City in the late ’90s. \t\n\n\tWhen we were 10! When we were 10 years old. \n\n\t\n\t\tWhen we were very young people — children, really! OK, let’s get down to Karen business. What do you remember about what you knew about “Stranger Things” when you auditioned?\t\n\n\tWell, it was called “Montauk.” I got the script, and I just fell in love with it. I just loved the writing, and just wanted to be on it. I auditioned for it, as we all did back in the day, in person, before there was self-tape. I was in the mix, as they say — and I was obsessed with it. The Duffers were on Facebook at the time, when we were all on Facebook, and I wrote them a message and said, “Hey, I know I’m in the mix, but I want to be on your show, whether it’s Season 1 or Season 4. I just really believe in it. I just feel a connection to it.” I was really campaigning for it.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhy do you think you loved it so much?\t\n\n\tI love science fiction, and I love D & D. It’s just an instinct for me. I have a feeling. And then when I finally met the Duffers, I said, “OK, these are my people.” I think I was one of the few people they didn’t have to convince, because I was really gunning for it, and championing them. I liked the characters; I loved the story. It was one of those things I just read so quickly.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAnd from what I gather, Season 1 was filmed in a bubble — no one knew what was going to happen. What were you thinking during Season 1?\t\n\n\tMy daughter just turned 3, so I was commuting from New York. It’s funny, it was going to shoot in Montauk, Long Island, and when it went to Atlanta, I almost passed because I said, “Oh, I can’t be away from my daughter that long.” But then I said, “Oh, whatever. I’ll just commute.”\n\n\tWhat was so lovely about Season 1 was everyone there loved the show. Everyone was happy to be there, and it was a lot of fun and excitement. And that that still carried on throughout all five seasons, for sure. We’d have lunch together, and hang out a little bit more. And the kids, of course, were just really young kids.\n\n\t\n\t\tOver the first four seasons, Karen is constantly being kept in the dark as to what’s going on with her children and with Hawkins in general. What was that like for you as an actor?\t\n\n\tI think in the ’80s, the clueless mom was prevalent, right? And I think that really works for the comedy of Karen, which I loved, playing — that cluelessness.\n\t\n\n\tAs an actor, I thought, OK, this is really funny, but how do I make this real for myself? And that’s when I came up with this idea that she’s drinking a lot and often, and probably by herself. We don’t see that, but she’s anesthetizing herself, I’d say, in her bedroom, and sneaking the wine. That’s how I justified for myself.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNell Fisher as Holly Wheeler \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDid you ever feel left out? Like, I’m playing a character who’s left out, and therefore I feel left out?\t\n\n\tOh! No, I never felt left out. I just leaned into this idea of Karen being the ultra-clueless mom.\n\n\tAnd in fact, I had a plan for when the series ended, because I thought she’d just be like, “Oh well, that’s the end!” And still remain in the dark forever. I was going to do a YouTube series called “Cocktails With Karen.” Like, people claim this happened and, have conspiracy theories — and evolve into the Karen trope that we have now. I thought, “Oh, I’ll have this whole thing down the line. I’m gonna make a meal out of this one later on.”So I can’t do that anymore.\n\n\t\n\t\tSure can’t. Once you got the script for the second episode, were you like, whoa, this is a whole thing? It’s a massive set piece!\t\n\n\tI was emotional to read it. Of course, I always wanted Karen to be part of the storyline, and get in there and fight and be part of the action. They really leaned into that mom ferocity — like, this quiet character that we sort of underestimated, and then just giving her this moment of courage. I think the audience is going to be excited, but I don’t think they’re going to be surprised, in the sense that Karen is capable of doing it. I think they’ll say, “Yeah, of course — she’s going to definitely defend her family.”\n\t\n\t\tI interviewed Nell Fisher, and we talked about filming the scene in the tub, and how you developed a competition about staying underwater.\t\n\n\tWe did. We did! It was such a joy to work with her, because everyone’s grown up now, so now I had another kid on the set, right? We were very playful. It was just a lot of fun to do all the technical aspects of it.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow long did it take to film the scene in the Wheeler house?\t\n\n\tWell, we shot the tank stuff. When you’re in the tank, you think, oh, it’s pretty easy to stay down, but your feet start rising — things would just go wrong. You’re like, “Oh, I need to weight around my waist to keep me down, to keep us from floating up.” These are things you just don’t know until you’re in the water! Making sure the wig stays on; Karen’s makeup always stays on. The mascara came out perfectly.\n\n\tAnd then the actual sequence, running out of the bathroom, down the stairs, into the kitchen, and the slipping on the kitchen floor. Because we come right from the tub to running, we’re drenched. We’re not just a little wet, we are soaking wet. You get dry pretty quickly, so we had to take a lot of breaks to get hosed down as if we had just got out of the tub. So if the hair started to look a little bit dry, they had to wet it down. You had to wet down the nightgown. You had to make sure it was sopping wet — dripping, dripping, dripping at all times.\n\t\n\t\tAt the premiere in L.A., the audience burst into applause when Karen breaks the bottle and tries to stab the Demogorgon. How did that feel? People Iove Karen! \t\n\n\tWith the young fans, I always get this thing of, “I wish you were my mom!” or “you’re such a cool mom.” And I think other parents relate to her devotion, and to her love of her kids. It was a lot of fun to hear the whole audience break into raucous cheering. And also seeing it on a big screen!\n\t\n\t\tWhat was it like to film the scene in the hospital when Karen is struggling to communicate about Mr. Whatsit to Nancy and Mike?\t\n\n\tWhen I saw the final scene of where Nancy finds Karen on the floor in the blood, it seemed like they added more blood in the special effects. But I remember them both showing up, and Millie going, “How does she live?!”\n\n\tThere has to be this balance of reality, but then also it’s “Stranger Things,” right? There are monsters, and there’s the Upside Down. So for me, waking up that moment, and her as a mom, just like, “Where’s my daughter?” I have to get up enough energy to communicate clearly enough information to go get her. She writes “Henry.”\n\t\n\t\tI was also like, “God, she’s so drunk. How is she managing any of this?”\t\n\n\tYour adrenaline can take over, and topple the drunkenness in that case. We’re making it work!\n\t\n\n\tBefore you see Karen sitting on the tub, I had her be much more drunk, and much more unstable. She’s a functioning alcoholic! I mean, to me, she’s been a functioning alcoholic for a long time — especially, I would imagine, after Billy died.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat are you excited for viewers to see in Volume 2?\t\n\n\tWell, we know she doesn’t die. And I love that they saw this for me, and they were always thinking of this. What I’ve learned from the best showrunners, the best creators, is they’ve always had the ending in mind from the beginning. And if you look at Season 1, the Demogorgon is reaching out for Holly at Joyce’s house, and then he comes back for Holly, right?\n\n\tWe see glimpses of Karen, little glimpses of her strength, little insights into her. Not much, but enough that it builds up to how she interacts as a mom — it makes sense. You can see that she’s gonna do this.\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Duffers told us that they tried to make it so everyone’s last day was their final scene. Was that the case for you? \t\n\n\tIn Season 1, I was day one, scene one, take one. And the last day, I was second to last scene, I think. I have two lines that I say at the end. I’ve never done so many takes for two lines, because every time I would open this door, I was about to cry. Like everybody! So it was nice to be in the company of people who are always on the verge of tears, who really understood the moment.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflx\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLook, I’ve been acting for a long time, and I’ve had incredible experiences, and I know when something is really, really special and unique. I’m so grateful for this opportunity, and the length of it. It wasn’t lost on any of us how truly special and meaningful this whole experience was. They let down all this confetti. And there was a big, big ending that was orchestrated with balloons and everything, but we still had to finish it up. I love that they designed it to shoot this scene the last day, and have it circle back to the very first day.\n\n\tAnd my family was there, and everyone’s family was there. I think someday I’ll come up with the right words for it, and be like, “Ah, I wish I would have said this about it.” But it’s just all deep in my heart.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• The Duffer Brothers Answer Volume 1 Burning Questions• Noah Schnapp on Will’s Game-Changing Discovery• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler and Working With Max• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 5, Volume I of “Stranger Things.”\n\n\tNell Fisher, who turned 14 earlier this month, takes center stage as Holly Wheeler in the new (and final) season of “Stranger Things.” Through its first four seasons, the role of Holly — the younger sister of Mike (Finn Wolfhard) and Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer), who’ve been central to the show’s story since Season 1 — was played by twins Anniston and Tinsley Price, who were 3 years old when “Stranger Things” premiered in July 2016. Fisher, meanwhile, was living in New Zealand with her family, going to school and beginning to act, scoring a key role in the 2023 horror reboot “Evil Dead Rise.”\n\t\n\n\tFrom there, she auditioned to play Holly Wheeler in early 2023, and after getting the role, Fisher moved to Atlanta later that year to begin filming the final season of “Stranger Things.” And when the curtain rises on the Season 5 premiere, with its 18-month time jump, Holly plays a key role in the show’s endgame. As Volume 1 unfolds, Vecna reveals that Holly and the kids in her grade are somehow part of his evil plan to do … whatever it is he’s planning to do! As such, Vecna, appearing to Holly as the friendly, handsome and clean-cut Henry Creel — whom she calls Mr. Whatsit, inspired by her favorite book, “A Wrinkle in Time” — tries to warn Holly about monsters in Hawkins, Indiana, their town that’s under military quarantine. But since he’s the monster, Henry/Vecna sends a Demogorgon to kidnap Holly to take her to the Upside Down, successfully snatching her from her mom, Karen (Cara Buono), who puts up a valiant, doomed fight against the nearly indestructible monster.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOnce she’s taken, Holly thinks she’s hanging out with Henry (Jamie Campbell Bower) in the Creel house inside Vecna’s carefully constructed fantasy world, but in fact, her physical body is somewhere else entirely — a place where Vecna is controlling her. But it turns out she’s not alone: Max (Sadie Sink), who’s been in a coma since the events of the Season 4 finale (when she even died for a few minutes, becoming Vecna’s fourth victim), is there as well, and reveals herself to Holly at the end of Episode 3. After Holly’s initial shock wears off at the sight of Max, they join forces.\n\n\tFisher now lives in London again (where she was born), and with her parents, Toby and Laura, within earshot, she spoke with Variety over Zoom during a vacation on the Isle of Wight while on a recent school holiday.\n\t\n\t\tI noticed from your Instagram that you seem to have lived in both New Zealand and in the U.K. — for my first question, where are you from?\t\n\n\tI’m not quite sure how to answer this question! My mum is a Brit; my dad is a Kiwi. But my mum used to be a diplomat, and she was an ambassador to New Zealand. I lived in New Zealand for four years, which is where I started my acting. But it was quite a nice coincidence, because that’s where my dad’s from, and that’s where all his family are.\n\t\n\t\tNice! How did you start acting?\t\n\n\tWell, it turns out that the way you break into the industry is by going to New Zealand in the middle of a pandemic! New Zealand was COVID-free, so all the Hollywood studios sent work over to New Zealand. So in 2020, I got a role in “Evil Dead Rise.” I had done this micro-budget film before, but never anything like where I was like, “Oh yeah, I might want to, like, really continue doing this.” It all kind of just snowballed from there.\n\n\tI always have loved performing — like, any form of singing, dancing, acting. Yeah, it’s always been sort of a passion of mine. And my dad was an actor as well. He acted when he was around my age. He’s great; he helps me with all my auditions and stuff.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen we interviewed Matt and Ross Duffer for our cover story, Matt said he’d noticed you in the trailer for “Evil Dead Rise” before casting director Carmen Cuba brought you in to audition. What do you remember from getting the audition?\t\n\n\tSo first I got a self-tape for it. And I was really excited — but I hadn’t actually watched “Stranger Things” beforehand. I had been lobbying to forever. But my mum claimed that it would be too scary for me [long pause] — for her. I was so excited that I got this audition, and I also saw it as my chance to watch “Stranger Things”! But, yeah, I started it and just, like, binged it. I mean, it’s such an incredible TV series.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDo you remember when that was?\t\n\n\tThat was — I want to say March 2023. \n\n\t[Toby, Nell’s dad, says something.]\n\n\tFebruary 2023. \n\t\n\t\tAnd you were 10 or —? Maybe your dad remembers!\t\n\n\tI had just turned 11, but we didn’t actually start filming until January 2024. And so the Duffers thought that they were getting a small, cute, little blonde girl. And I think by the time we had started filming, I had shot up like four inches or something.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you learn that you got the role?\t\n\n\tI was in New Zealand, and I was filming “Bookworm,” which was a movie I did opposite Elijah Wood, and my dad comes up to me, and he says, “The Duffers want to call you.” And I’m like, OK, keep it together, keep it together. I jump on a Zoom call, and they just say that they wanted to offer me the job, and they were really looking forward to working with me. And they actually mentioned they had seen me in “Evil Dead,” which I thought was really cool. When I say I was speechless, I was speechless. I think I sat there with my mouth open for like a minute, and when I did speak, I was like, [long pause] “Thank you!”\n\t\n\t\tWhat had been your audition scene?\t\n\n\tThe scene with Mike in the school corridor, which is actually one of my favorite scenes. I loved filming it with Finn. And my other scene was the scene where I’m talking to the Tiffany cassette tape? Originally in the script, it was a Barbie. I found that scene quite tricky, because I’m rambling and talking out loud.\n\n\tLater in the audition process, I went to New York to do a chemistry read with Sadie, who I have most of my scenes with. I was, like, ridiculously nervous going in. I was, like, shaking. Then I met Sadie, and she put me instantly at ease, and we did the scene after I have just bumped into her in, I don’t even know how to put it —\n\t\n\t\tVecna’s mind space, or something?\t\n\n\tVecna’s mind space situation! It was so lovely meeting her. She’s such an incredible human being. And afterwards, she took me and my dad out for a really lovely lunch.\n\t\n\t\tMatt and Ross said that because the Price twins — who’d played Holly Wheeler until you did — were young that there was no real sense of who Holly was, she was kind of a blank slate. How did you work with them to create the character of Holly?\t\n\n\tAt the start of the series, she’s very much the baby of the Wheeler family. But she’s also not quite ignorant, like her parents are: She has been on the periphery of the Upside Down. In Season 1, she saw the Demogorgon reaching through the wall, and in Season 3, she noticed the trees moving. This season, she really comes face to face with the Upside Down, and with the danger. She’s finding out who she is.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou posted such a nice tribute to Holly in June — have you met the Price twins?\t\n\n\tYeah, I did actually. We went to a trampoline park together. It was so lovely meeting them. I’m really glad to be able to take the role over from them.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMatt and Ross said that before they met you, Holly was more shy. But that you’re so extroverted, and I’m quoting Ross now, they started “infusing Nell’s personality into Holly.” Did you know that was happening?\t\n\n\tI didn’t, actually! This is the first time I’m hearing about that. But that makes sense. I did see a couple script changes, where I did see Holly getting a bit more like out there. \n\t\n\t\tHolly’s older siblings, Nancy and Mike, have been fearless throughout the whole series. What parts of Nancy and Mike did you want to use to create your character?\t\n\n\tThere’s this really lovely scene in Episode 1 where Mike is talking to Holly, and she’s crying, she’s upset. She has this imaginary friend, and she’s very scared. And Mike talks about how he likes to imagine himself as someone else — as Mike the Brave — whenever he gets scared or nervous. Holly really looks up to her big siblings, and she is sort of distant from them — but I think they are people she really admires.\n\t\n\t\tWhen did you realize that it was going to be such a huge role?\t\n\n\tWell, in the audition process, I had a Zoom call with Matt and Ross, and they did say that Holly was going to be a big character. But I don’t think I realized quite how big until I read the script. I was like, “This is awesome!”\n\n\t[Her dad says something that sounds like, “They [inaudible] tell us she needed to spend a year in the U.S.” Nell laughs.]\n\t\n\t\tThey did tell you or didn’t tell you?\t\n\n\tThey didn’t.\n\t\n\t\tSo that was a surprise. What was it like joining the set of a show that’s in its fifth and final season? Were you scared?\t\n\n\tIt was definitely really daunting going in, because you’ve got these people who have worked together and known each other and been friends for almost 10 years now. Going in, I was really nervous, especially because Holly is a big character this season. I wasn’t sure how the others might receive me. But everyone was so welcoming, from the very first day. On my second day of filming, I was doing the breakfast scene with the Wheelers and the Byers, and every single one of them came up and said how lovely it was to meet me, and that they were really excited to see what I was doing this season. That just really put me at ease.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWho did you end up bonding with the most among the cast?\t\n\n\tI think everyone, really. I mean, I spent lots of time with Sadie, and I really enjoyed that. I learned a lot from her, and she’s so lovely. I also spent a lot of time with Cara, who plays my mum, in the bathtub in the Demogorgon attack sequence. We really did develop a close mother-daughter relationship.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s talk about that scene! What was that like to film?\t\n\n\tIt was my favorite part of the year! I say that, and I was also covered in goo, and dripping wet for most of it. But it was so much fun. I loved working with Cara. I love doing stunts — being up in a harness. I think it’s quite crazy. When I watched it, I was like, “That’s about two minutes — but we spent, like, two weeks on it.”\n\n\tCara and I, when we were in the bathtub, we would have this hand signal where we would, like, squeeze each other’s hand three times if we needed to come up for air. \n\t\n\t\tI was going to ask how you filmed that part. Because there’s no way of doing it, I think, without actually being underwater, right?\t\n\n\tYes, it was this bathtub. It was cheated, so it was slightly bigger — one side was glass. We just went underwater, and we spent three days turning to prunes in the bathtub. We had an unspoken — but I think still there! — competition about who could stay under for the longest. And I think it got pretty intense, which probably helped with the acting!\n\t\n\t\tWhat was the competition?\t\n\n\tThe rules weren’t ever made very clear, but we would squeeze each other’s hands if we needed to come up for air and breathe. And as we progressed, the periods of time we stayed under just kept getting longer and longer, and it was clear that you didn’t want to be the person who came up first.\n\t\n\t\tSounds dangerous! Working with Jamie Campbell Bower in his Henry form, is it strange to think of how evil Vecna is?\t\n\n\tI mean, yes, he’s such a brilliant guy. I went to Atlanta for a week in 2023, in December, when we were doing table reads and costume fittings, and meeting the rest of the cast. I was in the middle of a costume fitting, and there was a knock on the door, and my dad went and got it, and he came back in, and he said, “Jamie Campbell Bower wants to meet you, but he’s happy to wait till the end of a fitting.”\n\t\n\n\tJamie was done with his day; he was all ready to go home. But he ended up waiting half an hour, 40 minutes, just so he could meet me and introduce himself.\n\t\n\t\tHad you heard of Tiffany or the song “I Think We’re Alone Now”? That was the soundtrack of my childhood, but I’m an ancient being!\t\n\n\tYeah, so I had heard it a couple times! My dad is quite into forcing his ’80s culture onto us. Which is a good thing most of the time! There’s a scene where I dance around the house, belting it at the top of my lungs. I had to freestyle the dance. I was, like, so nervous for it. But it was so much fun.\n\t\n\t\tMax ends up connecting with Holly in Vecna’s fantasy world — whatever it’s called, which Holly compares to Camazotz in “A Wrinkle in Time.” Mike has Dungeons and Dragons; Holly seems to have “A Wrinkle in Time.”\t\n\n\tBecause she’s very new to this world, and it’s impossible to wrap your head around, she likens it to her favorite book, which is “A Wrinkle in Time.” And so Henry is “IT” or “I.T” — there was quite a big discussion while we were filming whether it would be, whether I should say “I.T” or “IT.” And his mind is Camazotz, and Sadie is Meg’s dad.\n\n\tI’d read it before, but I reread it in preparation for the role. I really love it. It’s a great book\n\t\n\t\tAre you in regular school?\t\n\n\tYeah, I’m in normal school, which I really like. I am a bit of a geek. I do really love my school. It was quite hard last year, keeping up with all the schoolwork. 2024 was incredible, but it was also like, tiring — a year away from my family. This year, I’ve just been going back to school, being a normal kid for a bit. But I’m really excited to see what kind of next year brings.\n\t\n\t\tYou’re going to get a million roles based on this. But do you know what you’re doing next, if anything? \t\n\n\tI’ve got nothing set in stone. But it only really means something to me now, because this is the first time I actually feel like I’m an actor. And I feel like I belong in this world, and I’m no longer just like a sort of lucky kid who stumbled across a film set. And I feel like I’m here to stay now. I’m still really looking forward to just continuing to tell more stories.\n\t\n\t\tDid you like living in Atlanta, or were you happy to come home? Or both?\t\n\n\tI mean, both! I loved living in Atlanta. We rented out a little house in Cabbage Town, which is where most of the other cast were. I developed this strange life and routine. My grandparents are coffee fanatics, and we’d walk 15 minutes to go to the best coffee place, and then we’d come back and go off to set. I developed this really lovely little life that — yeah, I kind of miss it!\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• The Duffer Brothers Answer Volume 1 Burning Questions• Noah Schnapp on Will’s Game-Changing Discovery• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Doha Film Institute is expanding its footprint as one of the Arab world’s most active talent incubators with new vocational training programs developed in partnership with France’s prestigious film school, La Fémis, and Gobelins Paris, the country’s leading animation school. The initiative, announced on Nov. 26 during the Doha Film Festival, marks one of DFI’s most ambitious education pushes to date, aimed at fast-tracking the next wave of creatives across the region.\n\t\n\n\tBacked by the Institut Français du Qatar and Qatar Museums, the programs represent DFI’s long-term strategy and investment in expanding access to industry-ready training as the demand for skilled crew, animators, and content creators is surging, particularly across the Gulf. The launch also arrives as Qatar positions itself as a growing creative hub, investing heavily in both production capacity and infrastructure.\n\n\n\t“Vocational training represents the future of learning,” said DFI CEO Fatma Hassan Alremaihi. “In a fast-changing world, we must empower young people with education that is practical, adaptable, and connected to real opportunities. Our partnerships with La Fémis and Gobelins Paris add to our year-round workshops and mentoring sessions that have helped build a thriving creative ecosystem in Qatar and the wider region.”\n\n\tThe La Fémis Cinematography Certificate Program, set for a June 2026 launch, will deliver a four-month, hands-on training course blending theory, exercises, and both online and in-person sessions. Designed to give participants a solid foundation in the creative and technical responsibilities of a director of photography, the program aims to give emerging cinematographers the industry-facing skills needed to compete on global productions.\n\t\n\n\tGobelins will lead a nine-month Animation Certificate Program, beginning in September 2026, structured around three modules in animation fundamentals, character performance, and visual storytelling. With a mix of lectures, practical workshops in Doha, and continuous online follow-up, each module culminates in a completed project, and graduates receive a Gobelins Certificate of Achievement. The program is also designed to complement DFI’s existing ToonBoom certification, creating a more complete training pipeline for regional animators.\n\n\tThe move underscores DFI’s strategy of pairing local talent development with global partnerships, a model the institute has leaned on across its labs, fellowships, and festival initiatives over 15 years. The new vocational tracks, which emphasize mentorship and real-world application, further signal an investment in building sustainable creative industries rather than short-term workshops alone.\n\n\tBy embedding internationally recognized schools directly into Qatar’s training landscape, the institute is looking to create not just access, but a pathway from introductory courses to specialized professional training, without requiring young creatives to leave the region.\n\n\t“Our focus is on placing skills, creativity, and hands-on experience at the heart of how we prepare the next generation of storytellers,” Alremaihi insisted. “These programs are pathways into the industry, bridges to global networks, and catalysts for creativity across our region.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat’s better than watching one Detroit legend rock the stage? A surprise mash-up from two of them.\n\n\tMotor City-native Jack White had been announced as the halftime performer for the Detroit Lions’ annual Thanksgiving football game at Ford Field (this year versus the Green Bay Packers). Still, the rocker upped the ante by bringing out Eminem mid-medley.  \n\n\tWhite kicked off his holiday setlist with “That’s How I’m Feeling,” from his 2024 album “No Name.” Then, Eminem rose from the bowels of the stage, sending the already amped-up crowd into a frenzy as he rapped over the White Stripes’ song “Hello Operator” and performed a rock-infused version of his own 2002 anthem, “’Till I Collapse.” To wrap things up, White launched into a stadium anthem of his own, the fan-favorite track “Seven Nation Army,” accompanied by the Lions cheerleaders. (The halftime show took place just a couple weeks after the now-defunct rock band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.)\n\t\n\n\tEminem, aka Marshall Mathers, who is arguably the Lions’ most famous fan, and his long-time manager and president of Shady Records, Paul Rosenberg, were recently tapped by the team as executive producers on the annual halftime show’s production through 2027. They’re involved in all aspects of production, including selecting performers — White was the first artist booked under the new deal.\n\n\n\t“We’re thrilled to be working with Marshall and Paul, who are two of the most accomplished and respected names in the music industry, not to mention longtime Lions fans,” said Detroit Lions president & CEO Rod Wood in a statement announcing the partnership. “Their reputation in the business will attract top-tier talent and help us solidify this annual performance as one of the most anticipated cultural moments on the NFL calendar.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Lions also announced that they hired Jesse Collins Entertainment (JCE) to produce the performance.\n\n\tTo note: White and Eminem weren’t the only two hometown heroes to perform at the NFL game; before kickoff, gospel singer Cece Winans delivered a rousing rendition of the national anthem.\n\n\tWatch a clip from the halftime medley below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIranian filmmaker Ali Asgari has long explored the quiet tensions and bureaucratic pressures of everyday life in Iran, from his acclaimed shorts to festival recognized features like “Disappearance,” “Until Tomorrow,” and “Terrestrial Verses.” In competition at the Doha Film Festival, he arrives with his latest work, “Divine Comedy,” which premiered earlier this year in Venice’s Horizons sidebar, and pushes his familiar themes into more overtly comedic territory.\n\t\n\n\tStarring director Bahman Ark as Bahram, the story centers on a mid-career filmmaker whose entire body of Turkish-Azeri-language work has never been screened in Iran. When his newest film is once again rejected by cultural authorities, he joins forces with his sharp-witted producer, Sadaf (Sadaf Asgari), to stage an underground guerrilla screening in Tehran. What begins as a simple act of defiance becomes a darkly funny journey through red tape, cultural gatekeeping, and the range of anxieties facing any artist determined to create freely.\n\n\n\tThe film is a multinational co-production between Iran, Italy, France, Germany and Turkey, with international sales handled by Goodfellas.\n\n\tAsgari, who has at times had his passport confiscated and continues to work without official permits, turns to satire as both a creative strategy and an act of resistance. His film “Terrestrial Voices,” which screened at Cannes’ Un Certain Regard in 2023, saw him banned from leaving the country or directing further films for months. In Doha, he spoke with Variety about the absurdities that shaped his latest act of defiance, “Divine Comedy,” the risks of shooting independently in Iran, and the surprising universality of his work.\n\t\n\n\tYou use humor in “Divine Comedy” to talk about a system that’s really anything but funny. What was challenging about balancing comedy with the realities of censorship?The situations you see in the film are based on reality, on things I’ve lived, and things Bahram, the lead actor, has lived as a filmmaker working in Azerbaijani Turkish. He’s always dealing with the authorities because of the language of his films. So the base of everything is real, but not 100% reality. I made the incidents more fictionalized and even more satirized in the film to show the absurdity of what we live with.\n\n\tGiven the constraints filmmakers face in Iran, what role do you think satire can play in pushing back against those limits?For many years, even 10 or 15 years ago, Iranian films relied on metaphor. Directors wanted to talk about serious issues but couldn’t do it directly. Part of that comes from the culture, but a big part comes from fear — fear of being accused of going against the government, so they chose metaphor as a weapon.\n\n\tThen a new generation started speaking more directly, people like Rasoulof and Panahi. They became more political, more audacious. I didn’t want to repeat that language. I felt satire was better for expressing what we’re living, because when you use satire, you show how silly and stupid the rules are. You diminish the system’s power.\n\n\tAnd at the same time, satire helps audiences outside Iran connect, because many people aren’t aware of what’s happening. If you present it too seriously, they may not understand it. Humor brings them in.\n\n\tYou shot the entire film in Iran. Did you worry about the risks of doing that without permits?Risk is part of making this kind of film. You have two options: make a film with permission and take no risks, or make it without permission and accept the consequences. I chose the second. I’m not making political films to provoke anyone, but I don’t like the idea of being censored. I believe a filmmaker must be free. If you go to the Ministry of Culture to apply for permission, you’re already giving up that freedom. It’s something I never do.\n\n\tHave you ever applied for permission in the past?Only once. It was a terrible experience. They wanted me to cut many scenes and add things that had nothing to do with my story. And most of the people there are not filmmakers — some don’t even know screenwriting or cinema. They’re just there to check religious elements.\n\t\n\n\tSo I decided not to go back. If I want to be free, sometimes there must be consequences.\n\n\tYou’ve had your passport confiscated more than once. How did that affect you?Yes, several times, but the last one was the longest – for eight months. For me, it’s not a big deal. If you choose to be free, that’s one of the consequences. As long as I’m alive, it’s okay. I told another journalist yesterday: “If they kill me, I won’t make films.” I don’t want to be sacrificed for cinema. But things like confiscating a passport… It’s part of the job. It’s something I’m not afraid of.\n\n\tDo you feel pressure to self-censor, consciously or unconsciously?There are two kinds of self-censorship. One you’re aware of — that one I try not to do. I write the dialogue and situations I want. But there is another kind, the unconscious one, that comes from how you grew up and the society around you. Sometimes I realize later that I avoided something even though I didn’t mean to. That’s the subconscious part. As long as I’m aware of it, I fight it.\n\n\tIn the film, Bahram keeps fighting for an audience that may never be allowed to see his work. Do you think about who your films are for?Honestly, no. After some years, you understand you may not be someone who makes films for a big audience. And I don’t think about nationality. Some Iranians have accused me of making films for Western audiences. I see that on social media, but it’s not true. To be honest, I never think of if I’m making a film for this audience or that audience. This film has references only Iranians will understand, but I truly just try to write what I think is interesting.\n\n\tBut cinema has no borders. I get messages from countries I’d never even heard of, telling me they connected with the film. That’s the beauty of art: you don’t make it for one group. You just make it.\n\n\tHow autobiographical is Bahram as a character? Were any scenes drawn directly from your life?Some parts are mine, some are his. We wrote the film together — Bahman Ark, his brother, Bahram, another writer who lives in Canada, Alireza Khatami (“The Things You Kill”), and me. We’ve all had similar limitations. It arose from discussing our experiences.\n\n\tThe basic idea came from when my film “Terrestrial Verses” was banned in Iran. I wanted to see how Iranians reacted, because I’m always accused of not making films for Iranian people. So I screened it secretly in cafés and friends’ homes, screenings of maybe 20 or 25 people. I carried a projector around, and had all kinds of strange experiences and varied reactions showing the film. That became the basis for this film.\n\t\n\n\tYou’ve screened the film in Venice and other festivals. How did the reaction in Doha compare? Does it feel like there’s some resonance specific to the region?Honestly, I was surprised. I didn’t expect a full theater. But the audience here connected a lot. Even during the screening, people were clapping at moments. Afterward, many stayed to ask questions, even outside the theater. The Doha audience is becoming more engaged with cinema because of what the Doha Film Institute has done over the last 10 to 15 years. The questions were very professional. I really enjoyed the screening here.\n",

    "description": "\n\tHallmark is bringing in country music royalty for their upcoming holiday film, “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas,” their first collaboration with the Opry",
    "body": "\n\tHallmark is bringing in country music royalty for their upcoming holiday film, “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas,” their first collaboration with the Opry as it celebrates its 100th year. But the cameos — by Pam Tillis, Megan Moroney and Brad Paisley, just to name a few — were only one bullet point on the long list of reasons it’s one of the most touching films of the year.\n\n\tThe power behind it started to hit star Nikki DeLoach, as she was getting her hair and makeup done backstage at the Opry, with Tillis sitting in the chair next to her.\n\t\n\n\t“The music’s on, and she’s just singing to it, and I’m just like, ‘Dear God, keep it together, Nikki. Voice of an angel! This is crazy,'” she told Variety in her dressing room at the Opry. DeLoach has been working with Hallmark Channel for 10 years and reads a lot of scripts. But this, time she didn’t even need to read it to agree to it.\n\n\t“There was no script yet. I heard ‘Grand Ole Opry,’ and I went, ‘Yes.’ Because it has been such a big part of my life since I was a little girl,” she said.\n\n\tDeLoach grew up in South Georgia and was extremely close with her father, whom she calls her “north star.” He passed away in 2021 after a battle with dementia.\n\n\t“Our love language was music. Because of him and my grandmother, I, at 3 years old, knew I wanted to be a performer. And between the two of them, they would get me to my dance lessons and my dad would drive me two hours each way to go to vocal lessons,” she explained. “He would say things like, ‘One day you could be up on that stage,’ and I would be like, ‘Daddy, don’t be ridiculous.’ And one of the places we always talked about going before he got sick was to the Grand Ole Opry together. I had never been because any opportunity that I had had was without him. I always said no, I’m going with my daddy. He got sick. We never got to come together.”\n\t\n\n\tShe continued, “So when this movie came along, and I learned that I was going to be coming to the Grand Ole Opry and getting to set foot on that stage and be a part of this, it just felt divine, like a full circle moment that started when I was a kid and happened decades later. We can’t control timing. When the time is right, the time is right. From the moment I’ve been here, my face has hurt from smiling so hard. I can feel my dad everywhere.”\n\n\tOne thing her father always talked about was Vince Gill’s “silky tone.” Then, the first time she came to the Opry before filming began, she was given a tour and tickets to a show. Vince Gill was the performer.\n\n\t“It’s really a dream come true — not just professionally, but on such a deep personal level,” DeLoach said.\n\n\tDeLoach plays Gentry, a songwriter who gave up her dream after her father, a country icon, died in a tragic accident. In the film, she travels back in time and gets to spend precious time with her father (Rob Mayes). In one scene between the two, Gentry is overcome with emotion — as was DeLoach. Her mom was in tears watching the scene on set, as were the film’s producers, gathered around the monitors in video village.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It’s so hard because I don’t use my personal life in roles. I don’t work with substitution; it’s all imagination and building these characters from the ground up because your experiences as a human are very finite, but imagination is infinite. It also allows me to be able to be emotional, not once, but take two and take three and take four,” she said. “But obviously that truth still lives in there. There is no stopping my little girl self from realizing that the magic of getting to see my dad again, going back in time and having one more minute. Then having to say goodbye to him again and choosing between leaving that and going back to the present…. When I read that in the script, I sobbed like a baby. It’s so beautifully written. That’s real. It also felt like an honoring for anyone who’s lost someone.”\n\n\tDeLoach stars opposite Kris Polaha in the film, who plays Gentry’s lifelong friend and talent manager. The actors had worked together three times before — in “North Shore,” “Awkward,” and “Ringer” — never on a Hallmark project.\n\t\n\n\t“We were backstage and all the artists were preparing to go on stage, practicing in their rooms and doors wide open, so everybody can just hear,” she recalled. “Our jaws are on the ground and Kris just looked at me with tears in his eyes and said, ‘It was just supposed to be this. That’s why we never worked together before because we were waiting for this.'”\n\n\tThe film and its message reminded DeLoach what it is that Hallmark does so well and the reason, in her opinion, it’s only grown in the last decade.\n\n\t“Our why is very clear to me. This is for our audience — everything that we do is for the fans in mind. We don’t have a network without them, and they are a complete reflection of what we are trying to put out into the world, which is community, love, hope and faith and the knowing that at the end of the day, it’s going to be okay,” she explained. “I think that at the end of the 90 minutes of our movie, that’s what everybody feels. We can go through hard things and then we can also be okay in the end. That is what they’re seeking every time they put that TV on. I am that audience. I have navigated my child’s three heart surgeries. I have watched my dad fight one of the most brutal diseases. My grandfather, too. I have watched them take their last breaths in this world. I know that desire and that yearning to just find some space where you can just believe and hope and hold on to that and know that it’s going to be okay at the end of the day.”\n\n\t“A Grand Ole Opry Christmas” airs on Saturday, November 29, at 8 p.m. on Hallmark and streams the next day on Hallmark+.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDanny Seagren, a “Sesame Street” puppeteer who also appeared as an early iteration of Spider-Man on “The Electric Company,” died on Nov. 10 at 81 years old. His cause of death was not listed. His family announced the news via an online obituary. \n\n\tSeagren was born on Nov. 15, 1943 in Minneapolis.\n\n\tFamily described Seagren as a “dancer, writer and producer,” who also served as a puppeteer and puppet maker for Jim Henson. This led to Seagren’s appearances on “Sesame Street,” where he occasionally portrayed Big Bird — not only on the show, but also at live events and appearances on “The Ed Sullivan Show.”\n\t\n\n\tSeagren also went on to create puppets for and perform puppet characters on “Captain Kangaroo”, “Who’s Afraid Of Opera” and “Miss Peach,” the last of which earned him a daytime Emmy.\n\n\tHe was also the first TV portrayal of Spider-Man when he appeared on “The Electric Company,” the popular kids’ show starring Rita Moreno and Morgan Freeman.\n\n\tIn his later years, Seagren enjoyed connecting with now-adult fans of his work at various conventions.\n\n\tSeagren worked in NYC and eventually retired to Little River, SC. He is survived by his longtime companion, Kate Vereau, brother Dr. Stephen L. Seagren, his wife Jill R. Seagren and their son, Sean G. Seagren.\n\n\t“Danny will be greatly missed by his family, friends and those throughout the community he loved living in,” the family wrote in the obituary.\n\n\tPer the family, a celebration of life will be held at a later date. Memorial donations are encouraged to be sent to the Entertainment Community Fund.\n\t\n\n\tWatch Seagren perform as Big Bird in the clip below.\n\n\n\n",

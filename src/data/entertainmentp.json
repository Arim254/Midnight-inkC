    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIf you see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/john-mulaney/\">John Mulaney</a> having a beer, don’t worry — he hasn’t <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nick-kroll-john-mulaney-intervention-1236411176/\">relapsed</a> on his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/john-mulaney-baby-j-matthew-perry-1235806684/\">sobriety</a>. The comedian is a non-alcoholic beer aficionado. So much so, he’s starring a new ad campaign for Years and become a partner in the non-alcoholic business.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the spot, Mulaney lounges poolside while recalling a time when his wife Olivia Munn thought he may have been drinking again when she spotted him downing several cans of non-alcoholic Years.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, Mulaney tells me that never actually happened.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“She’s well aware of my enjoyment of Years non-alcoholic beer,” he says. “But I have had friends who have been like, ‘I didn’t want to say anything but…’”</p>\n<p>\n\tMulaney has been a Years fan for years. “It’s sold at Wrigley Field,” the Chicago native says of the Chicago Cubs stadium. “It’s that exact Midwest pilsner that I like. Other people make a light non-alcoholic but most of them taste like a drink trying to taste like one versus just being a pilsner or a pale ale that just isn’t fermented.”</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tMulaney posted the commercial on his Instagram. I read him one of the comments on the post that hopes to see a “cage match” between him and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/tom-holland/\">Tom Holland</a> “to see who is the king of non-alcoholic beers.” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/shopping/news/tom-holland-non-alcoholic-beer-bero-shop-online-1236178861/\">The “Spider-Man” star launched non-alcoholic beer brand Bero</a> in 2024, two years into his own sobriety.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Is a cage fight like a physical fight like UFC because, you know, I fought three 14-year-olds on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/john-mulaney-netflix-talk-show-release-date-1236290332/\">‘Everybody’s Live,’</a>” Mulaney says, referring to a skit on his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/reviews/john-mulaney-netflix-review-everybodys-live-1236335973/\">Netflix talk show</a>. “It gets your heart rate going.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSure, but is he willing to do the same with Holland? “I’d fight three 14-year-old friends of his,” Mulaney cracks.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat does Mulaney love most about being sober? “When I go to the doctor and I have problems, we don’t have to kind of tiptoe around the minefield,” he says. “It’s like I say, ‘I’m urinating a lot at night, I have some numbness in my left hand.’ We don’t have to then discuss whether it’s all of the cocaine, Adderall, opioids or alcohol. They’ll take you much more seriously at the doctor.”</p>\n<p>\n\tI ask Mulaney which other sober celebrity he’d like to see in a Years campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I know Anthony Hopkins has something like 65 years of sobriety,” Mulvaney says. “I think he would be a natural. He can play an acting student of mine. He goes, ‘You’re such a good actor. You were on ‘The Bear’ and not many other things.’ I go, ‘That’s true.’ And then I say to him, ‘You’re getting better, sir,’ and then I hand him one.”</p>\n<p>\n\tYears is available across the Midwest, as well as on the West Coast and in Texas.

As an actor, you’re in tune with your emotions and feelings and having that eradicated and elevated is a difficult thing to do.”</p><p>Alcock has earned her wings after shooting “Supergirl,” where she plays the titular role of Superman’s cousin, Kara Zor-El. Though that film won’t be out until 2026, Alcock appeared in a brief but memorable cameo in the recent “Superman” to introduce the character — spitting out the already iconic line: “Thanks for looking after my dog, bitch!”</p><p>Though she has previously taken flight on HBO’s “House of the Dragon” as Rhaenyra Targaryen and just starred in the hit Netflix limited series “Sirens” with Julianne Moore, “Supergirl” is a huge step for the Australian actor, who has been studying drama since age 5. She even attended a performing arts school, dropping out when she landed her first TV role on the comedy “Upright” in 2018.</p><p>In 2023, Peter Safran, the co-CEO of DC Studios, approached Alcock for a general meeting, and in a few short weeks, asked her to put herself on tape for the part. Alcock admits to conflicted feelings. “I think most actors deal with that kind of duality where I want to work and do things people watch and are important, but I also want to have a long career and not get pigeonholed into one part,” she says. But as she researched the character, she also realized just what a great role Kara is.</p><p>“I was so blown away; she’s like the coolest one,” says Alcock. She flew to Atlanta where co-CEO James Gunn was prepping to shoot “Superman” and did a screen test. About a week later, she found out she got the part in an unusual way. “James just sent me the link to the [online] article,” she reveals. “I was kind of like, ‘Oh shit, it’s real!’” <br /><em>— Jenelle Riley</em></p></div>\n<p>\n\tReps Agency: CAA; Management: Entertainment 360; Legal: Goodman, Genow<br />Influences Her classmates Odessa Young and Sophie Wilde</p>\n</div></article>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Ella Anderson (“Song Sung Blue”)</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ella-Anderson.jpg?w=240\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ella-Anderson.jpg 700w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ella-Anderson.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ella-Anderson.jpg?resize=240,300 240w\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: David Higgs\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<p>\n\tWhen she was 5 years old, Anderson went on her first audition and she still remembers the line, “I want a teddy bear, Daddy.” On the drive over, she peppered her mother with questions — “Why do you think I want this teddy bear? Do you think it was promised to me? Did something happen at school?” So, it’s safe to say she always took acting seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnderson has worked steadily for the last 15 years as both singer and actor. She is probably best known for her role in the Nickelodeon series “Henry Danger” as the sister to the hero. But this year will see her opposite Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson in “Song Sung Blue,” the charming true story of a couple who start a Neil Diamond tribute band. Anderson plays Rachel, the strong-willed daughter of Hudson’s Claire and stepdaughter to Jackman’s Mike; she more than holds her own against the two Oscar nominees. Though she hadn’t met her onscreen family prior to being cast, she says they all quickly bonded. “We jumped into it, and it just felt right,” she notes. “It helps that Kate is the most warm, nurturing, motherly fun human, and Hugh just feels like a warm hug.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnderson previously played the young Jeannette Walls in the biographical “The Glass Castle” and considers it a privilege to be able to speak with her real-life counterparts. It’s also a responsibility she doesn’t take lightly. “To have the opportunity to be trusted to portray someone’s life with care and love and empathy is something I love to do,” she says. “I just want to do them justice.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso an accomplished singer — her EP “Evolving” was released in 2021 — Anderson is mulling over her next steps. “I’m really excited about the possibilities,” she says. “I’m filmmaker-driven, and if someone is really passionate about the story and has a strong perspective, I think we’re speaking the same language. So, I’m looking for like-minded people.” <br /><em>—</em> <em>J.R.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tReps Agency: Gersh; Management: Gilbertson Entertainment; Legal: Yorn, Levine, Barnes, Krintzman, Rubenstein, Kohner, Endlich, Goodell & Gellman</p>\n<p>\n\tInfluences Agnes Varda, Gena Rowlands, Clarice Lispector</p>\n</div></article>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Miles Caton (“Sinners”)</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Miles-Caton.jpg?w=240\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Miles-Caton.jpg 700w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Miles-Caton.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Miles-Caton.jpg?resize=240,300 240w\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Mihailo Andic\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<p>\n\tLife has changed a lot for “Sinners” star Caton.</p>\n<p>\n\tA few years ago, then-16-year-old Caton was on tour with H.E.R. before he got the call for his first movie. “Having that experience on tour, and being on my own, performing in front of large crowds was important and crucial for me with ‘Sinners’ and jumping into a project like this,” he notes. Touring gave him the confidence to make the leap and star as a preacher’s son with a unique talent<br />for singing.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the biggest hits of the year, “Sinners” is directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Michael B. Jordan as twins Smoke and Stack. Caton’s character Sammie is their cousin, recruited by the twins to sing at the juke joint. But his talent triggers a chain of supernatural events.</p>\n<p>\n\tCaton has earned rave reviews for his acting debut, and Hollywood is knocking on his door. The actor says, “I get recognized all the time, which is something that I’m still learning to adjust to, because I can’t tell if somebody’s staring at me like they’ve got a problem with me or just because they know me. So, I’m trying to differentiate that.” He adds, “People show me so much love.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOn set, it wasn’t so much advice he got from the filmmaker, it was observing Coogler in action. “I had no choice but to just have faith in him and his process. He taught me a lot as a young Black man with a vision and a dream to accomplish.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for what’s next, Caton is excited for the future and would specifically love to do action and adventure films. He’s taking calls and meetings. “I’ve got a lot of different things I want to do.” <br /><em>—</em> <em>Jazz Tangcay</em></p>\n<p>\n\tReps Agency: CAA; Management: Artists First</p>\n<p>\n\tInfluences Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Michael B.

The actor admits he didn’t have much trouble portraying an admirer of his scene partner. “That was very easy,” laughs Donovan, noting that he, Dafoe and co-star Greta Lee all share theater backgrounds.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was made by people who are incredibly selfless and team-oriented. Kent talks about [how] this film was made in the true spirit of camaraderie, and I also think that’s a theme of the movie,” he says. It was also a true indie film. Donovan only found out he was cast last December, and the film bowed at this year’s Venice Film Festival.</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking of theater, Donovan was seen earlier this year in “Your Monster,” portraying a selfish playwright who dumps his girlfriend after a cancer diagnosis. He notes he’s played quite a few “deplorable” people and tries to find a humanity in them. “It’s not useful if you think of them as a bad person. The best villains are people who really believe they’re justified.”</p>\n<p>\n\tUp next, Donovan will appear in a film from “This Closeness” actor-filmmaker Kit Zauhar, who he praises as “so singular and self-assured.” And he’d love to get back on stage. “One of the things I love about it is that you really feel used up,” he says. “It burns you to the filter. You know you’re going to be tired, but you also know you’re going to feel like you left it all<br />out there.” <br /><em>—</em> <em>J.R.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tReps Agency: UTA; Management: Entertainment 360; Legal: Lichter, Grossman, Nichols, Feldman, Rogal, Shikora & Clark</p>\n<p>\n\tInfluences Christian Bale, Tom Burke, Isabelle Huppert, Van Morrison</p>\n</div></article>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Chase Infiniti (“One Battle After Another”)</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Chase-Infiniti_PC-Stefanie-Frontera.jpg?w=232\" alt=\"Chase Infiniti_PC Stefanie Frontera Paris Reise Paris.Reise@ledecompany.com\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Chase-Infiniti_PC-Stefanie-Frontera.jpg 2133w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Chase-Infiniti_PC-Stefanie-Frontera.jpg?resize=116,150 116w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Chase-Infiniti_PC-Stefanie-Frontera.jpg?resize=232,300 232w\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Stefanie Frontera\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<p>\n\tInfiniti isn’t easily intimidated. Her first TV job ever found herself playing the daughter of Jake Gyllenhaal and Ruth Negga in the Apple TV+ series “Presumed Innocent.” And now her debut feature film finds her acting opposite heavyweights Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another.” While shooting, the young actor wasn’t aware of the anticipation surrounding the project, which is currently playing to rave reviews. “I didn’t understand the full possible scope of how much people were looking forward to it,” she admits. “But I’m so happy that people seem to be loving it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThat calm demeanor befits her character, Willa Ferguson, who keeps her cool as she evades capture, shoots guns and generally kicks ass in the film. And it served her well during the audition process; after a self-tape, she was called in to meet with Anderson.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Obviously, I wanted to book the part but those moments getting to workshop it were such a gift,” she says. “I was like, ‘If this is where my journey ends with this film, I will still be completely satisfied with my performance and grateful I got the opportunity to sit down and talk with Paul Thomas Anderson.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, the journey is just beginning. Infiniti has already completed her next project, a starring role in “The Testaments,” the spinoff of “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Once again, she has some impressive parents — Infiniti stars as Agnes, the grown daughter of Elisabeth Moss and O-T Fagbenle’s characters. Mention that she always has the coolest parents, and Infiniti agrees, noting, “Both in real life and in fictional life, yes.” <br /><em>—</em> <em>J.R.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tReps Agency: Gersh; Management: Brillstein Entertainment Partners</p>\n<p>\n\tInfluences Zendaya, Denée Benton</p>\n</div></article>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas (“Sentimental Value”)</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Inga-Ibsdotter-Lilleaas.jpg?w=240\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Inga-Ibsdotter-Lilleaas.jpg 700w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Inga-Ibsdotter-Lilleaas.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Inga-Ibsdotter-Lilleaas.jpg?resize=240,300 240w\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Signe Fuglesteg Luksengard\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<p>\n\tWhen Lilleaas was 18, she found herself truly falling in love with the prospect of acting during her final round of theater school auditions. “When I got to the last round, I started to realize that it was maybe actually something I could do for a living, and it wasn’t just this dream, but something that other people saw in me that weren’t just my parents.” Eighteen years later, Lilleaas has proven to be an upcoming voice in Norwegian cinema, where she’ll next be seen in Joachim Trier’s feature, “Sentimental Value.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLilleaas plays Agnes Borg Pettersen, the younger sister of Nora (Renate Reinsve)> She finds herself in the crossfire of her sister and father (Stellan Skarsgård) as he’s set to begin production on his next film. As the sisters have grown up with a father that has been largely absent from their lives, Agnes grapples with her own childhood as an actor on her father’s films and how the sisters have bonded as a result of generational trauma. “There’s a crisis all around her constantly. Both Nora and Agnes are in a family crisis at the same time, but Agnes really wants everyone to be together. She wants the family to work,” says Lilleaas.</p>\n<p>\n\t As “Sentimental Value” opens the discussion about family dynamics, Lilleaas hopes that siblings, sisters and chosen family members can watch the film and feel comforted by the subject matter. “I hope that audiences feel seen somehow, whether it’s with siblings or their life witnesses. I really opened up and all of me was put into making this film. Working with Joachim, the cast and crew made it feel safe with that feeling of making something together.”  <br /><em>—</em> <em>Leia Mendoza</em></p>\n<p>\n\tReps Agency: Curtis Brown; Management: Team Players</p>\n<p>\n\tInfluences Her mom, her dad, Julia Roberts</p>\n</div></article>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Jay Lycurgo (“Steve”)</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jay-Lycurgo.jpg?w=240\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jay-Lycurgo.jpg 700w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jay-Lycurgo.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jay-Lycurgo.jpg?resize=240,300 240w\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Connor Harris\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<p>\n\tA few years ago, Lycurgo attended the Toronto International Film Festival as a guest. “I remember being in the audience and watching the people talking about their films and thought I would love to be there and talk about something I’m proud of,” he recalls. Cut to 2025 and Lycurgo hit the fest with not one but two buzzy films — the epic romance “Eternal Return” and the Cillian Murphy-led “Steve.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe latter film, directed by Tim Mielants and adapted by Max Porter from his novel “Shy,” finds Lycurgo  portraying a teenager at a school for troubled youth where Murphy plays the teacher. And Lycurgo knew just the person to help with his audition. “My dad works in alternative educational units, just like Steve,” he notes. “I’d see him come home exhausted every day and it’s a different type of exhaustion because teenagers are unpredictable.” Though he notes his dad was already his best friend, he says their conversations “really gave me a newfound respect for his work.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLycurgo, who beat out 3,000 other actors for the role, never did a chemistry test with Murphy (who is also a producer on the film) but more than holds his own against the newly minted Oscar winner. “He’s a brilliant actor and a great scene partner but also just such a grounded person,” Lycurgo raves. “With him and Max and Tim, there is an unspoken synergy and energy where I really felt seen in a new way.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMurphy clearly approved; Lycurgo’s next two projects are related to his co-star. They reunite in the “Peaky Blinders” movie “The Immortal Man,” and Lycurgo has a role in the upcoming film “I See Buildings Fall Like Lightning,” adapted by frequent Murphy collaborator Enda Walsh from Keiran Goddard’s novel. “I don’t think he knew I was up for either but when he found out I believe he put in a good word for me,” Lycurgo says. “It’s always great to have people on your side.” <br /><em>—</em> <em>J.R.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tReps Agency: Artists First; Management: Insight; Legal: Jackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer Mandelbaum Morris Bernstein Trattner Auerbach Hynick Jaime LeVine Sample & Klein</p>\n<p>\n\tInfluences His mum and dad, Tyler, the Creator, the Beatles</p>\n</div></article>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Guillaume Marbeck (“Nouvelle Vague”)</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Guillaume-Marbeck.jpg?w=240\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Guillaume-Marbeck.jpg 700w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Guillaume-Marbeck.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Guillaume-Marbeck.jpg?resize=240,300 240w\" />\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<p>\n\tBefore he landed the lead in Richard Linklater’s “Nouvelle Vague,” Marbeck realized that if he was going to convince anyone to cast him as Jean-Luc Godard, it was going to take more than attitude and a disaffected Swiss accent. Marbeck knew he had to get the glasses right. When a producer asked him why he was late to the audition, Marbeck thought to himself, “The first impression is key, so I need to nail that.” What would Godard do? Getting into character, Marbeck decided that instead of offering an apology or an explanation, “I would just park my scooter and turn to her. ‘Of course I’m late. I needed these glasses.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the end, it wasn’t Godard’s signature shades, but Marbeck’s commitment to his persona that seemed to convince the filmmakers to bet on an unproven actor. Marbeck had attended film school in France, concentrating on cinematography, followed by a year in New York, where he focused on screenwriting and directing actors.</p>\n<p>\n\t“For 10 years, I’ve been doing every job that you can imagine on the set, and also on production and distribution. The only two jobs I didn’t do were makeup artist and hairdresser,” he explains. “I just wanted to know every point of view of the business, so I could have the most 360-degree view in my head when I’m writing the script.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Marbeck, acting for a director like Linklater was like grad school. But it could just as easily have ended his career, given how iconic his character is. “For people that love cinema, playing Godard is like playing the pope,” he says.</p>\n<p>\n\tFortunately, the film was well received at Cannes, with many singling out Marbeck’s performance. His goal is still to write and direct films of his own, but if this leads to more acting roles along the way, that experience can only help. <br /><em>—</em> <em>Peter Debruge</em></p>\n<p>\n\tReps Agency: CAA; Management: Untitled Entertainment</p>\n<p>\n\tInfluences Jean-Jacques Beineix, Leos Carax, Sean Baker</p>\n</div></article>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Tonatiuh (“Kiss of the Spider Woman”)</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tonatiuh.jpg?w=240\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tonatiuh.jpg 700w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tonatiuh.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tonatiuh.jpg?resize=240,300 240w\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Jackson Davis\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<p>\n\tIt would be a disservice to say Tonatiuh delivers a breakout performance in the musical film “Kiss of the Spider Woman” — as he technically delivers two.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe actor first appears as Luis Molina, a queer window dresser thrown into an Argentinian prison in 1993 on charges of public indecency. It’s a role that won William Hurt an Oscar in the 1985 film version and Brent Carver a Tony Award for the 1993 Broadway incarnation. But in Bill Condon’s new feature adaptation, Tonatiuh does double duty as Kendall Nesbit, a character inside the Golden Age musical that Molina tells his cellmate Valentin (Diego Luna) about. Where Molina is a nurturing soul trapped in a drab gray prison, Kendall is all bright, polished charm — the actor reveals: “I literally put up a picture of Errol Flynn and said, ‘I want this hair.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s such a bold juxtaposition, it might take viewers a beat to realize it’s the same actor. Tonatiuh is pleased to hear this, noting, “If I get to leave any legacy, I hope it’s as a shapeshifter,” he says. “Every character I want to be as different as possible — from the essence to the energy to the microexpressions.”</p>\n<p>\n\tPreviously seen in the Starz series “Vida” and the Netflix thriller “Carry On,” Tonatiuh transformed himself for the film, losing 45 pounds in the span of about 50 days to show the effects of prison and to juxtapose the two characters (the musical numbers were shot first). He embraced the challenge, although it was hard when they got to Uruguay to shoot because of the famous dulce de leche pastries.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor his first lead film role, the actor shares scenes with Luna and Jennifer Lopez, who plays the titular Spider Woman (among other roles). “Watching her work is like watching lightning strike,” he says. “She’s been such an inspiration to me, as a Latino in this industry, in showing how you just have to create what you want to create.” <br /><em>—</em> <em>J.R.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tReps Agency: CAA; Management: Untitled Entertainment; Legal: Gang, Tyre, Ramer, Brown & Passman</p>\n<p>\n\tInfluences Pedro Almodóvar, Alfred Hitchcock, Hayao Miyazaki</p>\n</div></article>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Mari Yamamoto (“Rental Family”)</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MY-Headshot-Tom-Newton-e1759888929195.png?w=197\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MY-Headshot-Tom-Newton-e1759888929195.png 657w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MY-Headshot-Tom-Newton-e1759888929195.png?resize=98,150 98w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MY-Headshot-Tom-Newton-e1759888929195.png?resize=197,300 197w\" />\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<p>\n\tYamamoto began her career as a journalist in Japan writing “for a culture magazine I was so in love with.” What she didn’t love was her editor, a man she nicknamed “The Devil Wears Rolex,” who had a habit of cursing and throwing things at her. The final straw came when she saw a man on the subway glumly hanging onto a bar “who just looked like he’d lost the will to live.” She noted the title of the book he was reading: “The Disease Called Being an Editor.” She took it as a sign and got out of journalism.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe next sign came as she started watching “Grey’s Anatomy” and saw Sandra Oh. “I’ve never seen somebody who truly looked like me playing a character, a person, like that,” she says. “It changed my life. I realized this is an art form an Asian person can do in America.”</p>\n<p>\n\tYamamoto moved to New York to study at Lee Strasberg and fell in love with the craft. Within a year she estimates she did about 30 off-off-Broadway shows — a lot of “experimental theater” she adored, including a show about a cult with an orgy scene where “the writer and director were also naked for the rehearsals in solidarity.”</p>\n<p>\n\tStandout roles on the Apple TV+ series “Pachinko” and “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” followed, and now Yamamoto will be seen opposite Oscar-winner Brendan Fraser in this fall’s “Rental Family.” The two play employees at a firm in Tokyo that lends out actors for various tasks. For research, she and fellow actor Hira Takehiro met with members of such an agency and learned about their work — and how often people just wanted someone to talk to. “I think because therapists aren’t very common yet in Japan, there aren’t a lot of places where you can be vulnerable and reach out for help. And these people are very good at telling what others really need.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMoving forward, Yamamoto is looking to marry her two loves. “I’m working on my own thing right now to write and act in,” she says. “That’s the dream.” <br /><em>—</em> <em>J.R.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tReps Agency: Gersh; Management: Suskin/Karshan; Legal: Yorn, Levine, Barnes, Krintzman, Rubenstein, Kohner, Endlich, Goodell & Gellman</p>\n<p>\n\tInfluences Hayao Miyazaki, Tilda Swinton, Richard Linklater</p>\n</div></article>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<h2 id=\"section-heading\">\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t</h2>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n<div>\n\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/steve-carell-john-krasinski-the-paper-set-1236499772/\">\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/office.webp?w=250&h=167&crop=1\" alt=\"John Krasinski and Steve Carell on \"The Office\"\" />\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n<div>\n\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/did-dunder-mifflin-shut-down-the-office-fate-the-paper-1236508428/\">\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TCDOFFI_EC059-e1757011016199.jpg?w=250&h=167&crop=1\" alt=\"THE OFFICE, (standing): Phyllis Smith, Paul Lieberstein, Oscar Nunez, Jenna Fischer, Angela Kinsey, B.J.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tFresh from launching his first Apple playlist earlier this year, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/king-charles/\">King Charles</a> is now fronting a new doc feature on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/amazon-prime-video/\">Amazon Prime Video</a>. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Finding Harmony: A King’s Vision,” set for release globally in early 2026, will chronicle what it describes as the monarch’s “lifelong commitment to the philosophy of Harmony and the environment as a whole.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHarmony, for those not in the know, is a principle development by King Charles which encourages humankind to see itself as “part of nature, not apart from nature.” He outlined his vision in the 2010 book “Harmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World,” while earlier this year he held a Harmony Summit in his Highgrove private residency. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Nature is our sustainer – we are a part of nature,” said King Charles. “Therefore, what we do to her, we do to ourselves. For much of my life I have sought to promote and encourage ways we can work with, rather than against nature. In other words, to restore balance to our planet which is under such stress.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Finding Harmony: A King’s Vision,” directed by Nicolas Brown, will explore the origins, evolution and scientific foundations of the philosophy, which was brought to life through a mission undertaken by The King’s Foundation, a charity founded in 1990 when Charles was Prince of Wales. </p>\n<p>\n\t“This film will, I hope, demonstrate just some of the remarkable work being done around the world to put Harmony into practice, from the forests of Guyana to sustainable communities in India – and, closer to home, through the work of my King’s Foundation at Dumfries House and Highgrove,” added the royal. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Never has it been more important for the world to make a concerted effort to protect and prioritise our planet, and to restore our relationship with it. It is therefore my fondest hope that this film may encourage a new audience to learn about the philosophy of Harmony – and perhaps inspire the same sense of determination it has given me to help build a more sustainable future.”</p>\n<p>\n\tNews of the British head of state working on a doc feature with Amazon was first announced earlier in the year. While exact details weren’t unveiled at the time, teaming with a major U.S. streamer was seen as a departure for the royal family, which has typically worked with U.K. networks for on-screen appearances. That being said, Prince Harry and Meghan have a major multi-million dollar deal with Netflix.</p>\n<div><p>\n\t“We are deeply honoured to bring His Majesty’s pioneering environmental philosophy to Prime Video audiences worldwide through this landmark documentary,” said Courtenay Valenti, head of film for Amazon MGM Studios. “Finding Harmony represents the culmination of The King’s lifelong dedication to sustainability and environmental stewardship. We believe this collaboration, championed by Amazon MGM Studios head of documentary features Brianna Oh, will not only showcase the King’s remarkable vision but also inspire viewers across the globe to consider their own relationship with the natural world.”</p><p>“Finding Harmony: A King’s Vision” is produced by Passion Planet in collaboration with The King’s Foundation for Amazon MGM Studios. It will launch exclusively on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide in early 2026.</p></div>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tA woman in her 60s experienced a health issue and died on Monday after riding the Haunted Mansion attraction at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/disneyland/\">Disneyland</a>, <em>Variety</em> has confirmed.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the Anaheim Police Department, the woman was unresponsive immediately after exiting the ride, which is currently themed to “The Nightmare Before Christmas.” According to the police, Disneyland security provided CPR until paramedics arrived and transported her to a local hospital, where she was later pronounced deceased.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tA cause of death has not yet been revealed. Per Sergeant Matt Sutter of the Anaheim Police Department, “There is no indication of any operating issue with the attraction, which reopened soon after.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHaunted Mansion is described on Disneyland’s website as a “slow-moving” attraction that is OK for “little ones.” It says under guest policies: “The ride itself is gentle, but young children may be frightened by the special effects.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe ride first opened at the California amusement park in 1969 in the New Orleans Square area. The seasonal makeover began as a yearly tradition starting in 2001. Haunted Mansion is not based on preexisting IP, but the ride spawned two movies, a 2003 film starring Eddie Murphy and a 2023 reboot with LaKeith Stanfield.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe ride takes visitors through a ghost-infested manor and features floating heads, dancing spirits and a room with an ever-expanding ceiling. According to EW, it’s one of the only Disney attractions that features explicit images of human death, including a dead body that hangs above visitors at the beginning of the ride.</p>\n<p>\n\tHong Kong Disneyland recently opened a Haunted Mansion-inspired attraction called Mystic Manor, which follows a monkey named Albert meddling with his owner’s magical antiques.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tFormer NBCUniversal communications exec <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/allison-rawlings/\">Allison Rawlings</a> is heading to Disney Entertainment, where she’s been tapped as the new head of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fx/\">FX</a>‘s publicity and communications department.</p>\n<p>\n\tRawlings replaces longtime FX publicity chief John Solberg, who announced in June that he would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fx-public-relations-john-solberg-depart-after-nearly-30-years-1236428653/\">retire from the post</a> after nearly 30 years. In her new gig, Rawlings will report to FX chairman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/john-landgraf/\">John Landgraf</a>. She’ll also have a dotted line report into Naomi Bulochnikov, Disney Entertainment Television & Direct-to-Consumer’s executive VP of communications.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“FX’s communications strategy has always been founded on a passionate support for the artists who make our brand their home, as well as an unwavering commitment to respect for the journalists who cover our industry,” Landgraf said in a statement. “With Allison at the helm of our publicity and communications team, we gain an admired leader whose experience, creativity and passion will continue and amplify FX’s work — and the integrity with which we pursue it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLandgraf and FX announced Rawlings’ hire on Wednesday. Per the news, Rawlings’ remit will include “the strategic direction and vision of the network’s publicity, communications and creative services functions,” including talent relations, awards, events and photo publicity. Her oversight includes consumer publicity campaigns for FX originals that are both streamed exclusively on Hulu and Disney+, and also run on the FX and FXX cable channels.</p>\n<p>\n\t“FX has long been synonymous with exceptional entertainment,” Rawlings said. “After years of admiring them from afar, it’s a privilege and a thrill to be joining this incredible team.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tRawlings, who joined NBCU in 2016, was most recently exec VP of communications for TV and streaming at NBCUniversal before departing earlier this year. In that position she oversaw communications strategy across NBC, Peacock and six cable networks. Last year, that included “repositioning Peacock leading up to and during the 2024 Paris Olympics.” She <a target=\"_blank\">departed in March</a> after a corporate restructuring saw her communications duties shift to New York.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore NBCU, Rawlings was head of public relations at DreamWorks Animation, building the company’s first integrated communications function and guiding publicity for Oscar-nominated films such as “The Croods” and “How to Train Your Dragon 2.” She also helped launch DreamWorks Animation Television in 2013. </p>\n<p>\n\tEarlier in her career, Rawlings focused on the nonprofit arts, serving as head of communications for the Geffen Playhouse, brand strategy for Center Theatre Group and publicity for the Hollywood Bowl. As part of the LA Philharmonic press team, she helped with the opening of Frank Gehry’s Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2003.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tA few months ago, Hollywood was convinced that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/michael-de-luca/\">Michael De Luca</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/pamela-abdy/\">Pamela Abdy</a> were about to be fired as co-heads of Warner Bros. Pictures. What a difference a few hits and one epic comeback can make. </p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, Warner Bros. Discovery chief <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/david-zaslav/\">David Zaslav</a> confirmed in an internal note to staff that De Luca and Abdy’s contracts were being renewed for an unspecified amount of time.</p>\n<p>\n\t“When I first arrived at the studio, recommitting this storied company to its theatrical roots, renewing Warner Bros. longstanding role as a home for the world’s best storytellers, and reestablishing this iconic studio to its position as an industry leader in terms of quality and box office success were among my key objectives,” Zaslav wrote. “Bringing Mike & Pam on to lead this team was an important step to achieve those goals, and I am excited to share with you that we have re-upped their deal to enable them to continue the stellar work they and this team will do over the next several years bringing the very best movies to cinemas around the world.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tZaslav, who had reportedly been interviewing replacements for De Luca and Abdy earlier this year in the wake of flops like “Joker: Folie à Deux,” “The Alto Knights” and “Mickey 17,” praised the duo for “surpassing $4 billion at the global box office with just 11 films.” After a rough start to 2025, the pair’s fortunes shifted with the release of blockbusters like “A Minecraft Movie,” which grossed nearly $1 billion, as well as zeitgeist-y hits like “Sinners” and “Weapons.” This year, nine of the studio’s films debuted in first place at the global box office. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNot everything has been a commercial success. “One Battle After Another,” Paul Thomas Anderson and Leonardo DiCaprio’s politically charged thriller, scored with critics when it debuted in September, but its global haul of just over $100 million is a disappointment given its $130 million budget. The coming months will see Warner Bros. make other bold bets, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Fennell\" target=\"_blank\">Emerald Fennell</a>‘s adaptation of “Wuthering Heights” and Maggie Gyllenhaal’s monster movie, “The Bride!” The studio will also release sequels to “Mortal Kombat” and “Dune.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIf there was any bad blood from having to twist in the wind for months as Hollywood speculated about their fate, Abdy and De Luca didn’t betray it in their own note to staff. </p>\n<p>\n\t“We knew from our first meeting with David that his unwavering vision, leadership and resolve to be a destination for filmmakers with singular visions would lead Warner Bros. back to its founding principles of making fearless, entertaining and cinema worthy films for audiences of all ages,” they wrote. “We have the privilege to do this job because of the support and trust he has put in us, and in all of you. We could not be more excited to be leading this team as we introduce an exciting slate of films in the coming years and continue making every film experience an event worthy of the Warner Bros. shield.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tElliot Tuttle knew that “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/blue-film/\">Blue Film</a>,” the fictional story of a camboy who reconnects with a former high school teacher who was fired for sexually assaulting a student, was going to be divisive. After all, it features an empathetic portrait of a pedophile. But he thought some festival would have the courage to screen the incendiary drama. Instead, Tuttle suffered 10 rejections in a row, including hard passes from indie bastions like Sundance and SXSW.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“A lot of the feedback that we got behind the scenes was that it was very polarizing, and it seemed like the powers that be were scared of the movie,” Tuttle says. “It was unbelievable to me. I believe in the quality of the film, and I also had a hard time believing American festivals were this risk-averse.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSalvation came from the Edinburgh International Film Festival, where the film premiered last summer, receiving overwhelmingly positive reviews. Many critics praised Tuttle for handling such a provocative subject with sensitivity. It will next screen on Oct. 11 at NewFest with more festival dates to come. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“It feels like it kind of took one festival saying, ‘No, it’s OK to program it,’ for lots of other festivals to come on board,” Tuttle says. “I’m still hoping it will find distribution.”</p>\n<p>\n\tCritics in Edinburgh also heaped praise on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/reed-birney/\">Reed Birney</a>, a stage veteran who is a revelation as Hank Grant, a disgraced middle school teacher obsessed with Aaron Eagle (Kieron Moore), his former student who has grown up to become a fetish performer. Grant hires Aaron to spend a night with him. He’s attracted to Aaron, but he also wants more than sex — absolution, understanding, connection — it all becomes <em>so</em> murky.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was dark, but it was so well written,” Birney says. “They were such great characters, that I didn’t hesitate for a second about it. Only afterwards, when we were watching it in Edinburgh for the first time with a room full of people, did I get embarrassed.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMoore, who makes his movie debut in “Blue Film,” had a visceral reaction to the script.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I was scared,” he says. “But the thing that scared me the most was the idea of watching another actor do it. I felt like I had something that would be worth showing.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Blue Film” was a bare bones production. Shot on a micro-budget in a house in L.A.’s Hancock Park neighborhood over 13 days, the filmmakers moved fast to get everything done on schedule. The days were long and Birney and especially Moore spent many of them half-naked. But the hardest part was the two actors’ searing exchanges, in which they share parts of their tortured souls with each other.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The character things that were more difficult for me than the intimacy stuff,” Moore admits. “The intimate scenes felt like a nice break from some of the dialogue … but making this movie forced me to ask myself, what kind of actor do I want to be? And I want to be a dangerous artist.”</p>\n<p>\n\tTuttle drew on his own childhood memories to create a story that clearly represents the kind of dangerous art Moore wants to keep making. He had been watching a lot of films by Catherine Breillat, the French auteur known for her edgy depictions of female sexuality, when the idea for “Blue Film” came to him. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I was reminded of how when I was in middle school, I really wanted my teacher to have sex with me — like, I really did,” he says. “I had been journaling a lot about that experience, thinking about it retroactively later in my life, and this was kind of a natural extrapolation.”</p>\n<p>\n\tTuttle knew the topic of pedophilia inspires passionate feelings, but he was impressed with how “Pervert Park,” a 2014 documentary about a Florida community of convicted sex offenders, compassionately examined its subjects’ lives and inner anguish. He wanted to do something similar with “Blue Film.” But Tuttle and Birney, whose Hank is witty, insightful and guilt-stricken over his aberrant desires, know that many people will condemn them for portraying a pedophile as a human being, not just a monster.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I will feel empathy for everybody. That’s just the way I live my life,” Tuttle says.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Nobody chooses to be a pedophile,” Birney says. He did, however, insist that Tuttle make it clear that Hank is not a predator. </p>\n<p>\n\t“He does not have a computer full of kiddie porn and he hasn’t rounded up kids,” Birney says. “We have a line in there where I say, ‘I know it’s wrong. I’ve always known it’s wrong.'”</p>\n<p>\n\tHank’s self-awareness might not be enough to convince skeptical viewers to see “Blue Film” with an open mind. At one of the final screenings in Edinburgh, some audience members made it clear this wasn’t an emotional journey they wanted to take. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I was sitting in the green room with my mom,” Tuttle says. “And one of our producers was in there watching the film and about halfway through he texted me, ‘Oh, there’s a walkout… and another one… and another one.’ But the Q&A was also lively and there were a ton of hands being raised. So for me, it still felt like a good screening.”</p>\n</div>",

Josh O’Connor and Glenn Close also star, but weren’t in attendance.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCraig flexed his signature charm when festival director Kristy Matheson asked him if he dives deeper into his character, the drawling detective Benoit Blanc, while preparing for each “Knives Out” installment. “First of all, I just want to say thank you for having us,” he said with a smile, before adding, “No is the answer,” resulting in chuckles from the crowd. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I mean, look at this cast,” added Josh Brolin, who plays the main antagonist, an evil priest with an axe to grind. “Rian is an amazing writer and an amazing director, so when you get the call to do something like this — play the worst person that cinema has ever seen — you go, that’s right!”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe London audience — which included Greta Gerwig and Andrew Lloyd Webber — couldn’t stop laughing throughout the two-hour crime comedy, which follows Blanc latest case, this time revolving around a charismatic priest, Monsignor Jefferson Wicks, and his devout congregation. O’Connor plays priest-in-training with a dark past who threatens to interrupt Wicks’ power-hungry plans.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Wake Up Dead Man” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/wake-up-dead-man-rian-johnson-daniel-craig-knives-out-tiff-1236510479/\">world premiered at Toronto Film Festival</a> in September, where it received a rapturous response. “You get called to be on a team of like all-stars, and you just sit there and watch each other breathe life into these incredibly written characters,” Washington said at the premiere. “We were constantly in awe of each other, and inspiring each other, and goofing off, and trying to mess each other up. And it just was such a delight.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film received positive reviews out of TIFF, with <em>Variety</em>‘s Owen Gleiberman writing it may be the franchise’s sharpest entry yet. “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/wake-up-dead-man-a-knives-out-mystery/\">Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery</a>” is an enticingly clever and droll, nearly pitch-perfect piece of murder-mystery fun — a whodunit that lives up to the expectations set six years ago by ‘Knives Out,'” he wrote.</p>\n<p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/knives-out-3/\">Knives Out 3</a>” will release in theaters on Nov. 26 before premiering on Netflix Dec. 12. </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong>MCA Records</strong> (formerly Universal Music Nashville) has announced that country music icon <strong>Vince Gill</strong> has signed a “lifetime record deal” with the label, “cementing decades of partnership and collaboration,” according to the announcement.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe terms of what is the first such deal <em>Variety</em>‘s music team has heard of “reflect the enduring trust and commitment that has defined their relationship while positioning Vince as a timeless figure in country music,” it continues, “continuing to influence both the current landscape and future generations of artists and fans alike.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAs part of the agreement, Gill will release an EP featuring new music every month for the next year. The series, titled “50 Years From Home,” will combine new music and catalog tracks that complement each EP’s theme. The first EP, “50 Years From Home: I Gave You Everything I Had,” is set for release on October 17 and will include the recent single, “Go Rest High on That Mountain.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the announcement, Gill has amassed 1.7 billion global streams and 19.4 million in domestic album sales. He is up to 28.5 million in total RIAA certified units and has scored six multiplatinum albums, five platinum and two gold.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Vince has been a major part of the MCA family for decades,” said MCA president/CEO Mike Harris.  “This lifetime agreement reflects our unwavering commitment to supporting his artistic vision and providing him artistic freedom while ensuring his legacy continues to grow.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m feeling the most creative I’ve ever felt in my career these last few years,” shared Gill. “I’ve collected a treasure trove of songs and with my friends and partners at MCA we’ve come up with a way to release all this new music.

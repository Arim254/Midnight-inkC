    "body": "\n\tMD Productions has unveiled the first teaser for “Khan Tumhara,” an action drama starring Bilal Ashraf (“Janaan,” “Superstar”) and Maya Ali (“Teefa in Trouble,” “Mann Mayal,” “Diyar-e-Dil”) that aims to raise production standards in Pakistani cinema through international collaboration.\n\n\tDirected by Ehteshamuddin (“Superstar,” “Udaari,” “Sadqay Tumhare”) from a screenplay by Mustafa Afridi, the film is produced by Momina Duraid (“Parwaaz Hai Junoon,” “Superstar,” “Sadqay Tumhare”) at MD Productions alongside Ashraf and Ehteshamuddin at Behive Transmedia. \n\t\n\n\tThe project blends action sequences with romance and drama, centering on the character Yusuf Khan, described as navigating power, love and vengeance.\n\n\n\tThe production employed multiple international crew members for its action sequences, with the team led by Nick Khan (Marvel’s “Eternals”) and Hussain Abdullah (“Skyfall”). The crew traveled to Pakistan to shoot the sequences and trained local crew members for several months.\n\n\tPrincipal photography lasted approximately 70 days for the action sequences alone. Ashraf performed his own stunts without body doubles, sustaining multiple injuries during filming. Ali also underwent extensive preparation for her role.\n\n\t“For years, Pakistani cinema has flirted with action but we have never truly let it bleed,” said Ehteshamuddin. “’Khan Tumhara’ is our answer to that hesitation. Yusuf Khan is not a hero you cheer for from a safe distance; he is the man who drags you into the dust with him where love is a wound; power is a poison; and vengeance is the only prayer left. This is our story, told with our sweat; our scars; our stubborn refusal to look away.”\n\t\n\n\tAshraf added:  “This was more than a film; it was a lifetime education in the craft, paid for with blood, sweat and tears. It has become the benchmark against which I’ll measure every project I ever do from hereon. This journey is dedicated to my late mother and sister, and I am forever thankful to everyone who has been part of this project.”\n\n\tThe visual effects were handled by Haider at Softmatrix, with post-production designed to meet international standards.\n\n\tProducer Duraid said: “’Khan Tumhara’ has something for everyone. A mix of action, romance and comedy. It offers full family entertainment for all age groups.”\n\n\tAli added: “Some projects truly stay close to your heart. ‘Khan Tumhara’ is one of them. From planning to pack-up, I had the privilege of witnessing this journey up close. It’s been an honour working with the finest director and actor, Ehtesham Bhai, and the amazing Bilal Ashraf – a brilliant actor; a wonderful human being; and now an exceptional producer. I am incredibly proud to be part of this film and can’t wait for everyone to experience the action and emotion of ‘Khan Tumhara’ this Eid ul Adha.”\n\n\tThe film’s soundtrack features songs in the Urdu, Punjabi and Pushto languages, aimed at appealing to diverse audiences across Pakistan.\n\n\t“Khan Tumhara” is scheduled for release in May 2026, timed for the Eid ul Adha holiday period. MD Productions and Behive Transmedia are handling distribution arrangements.\n\n\tWatch the teaser here:\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel opened Tuesday’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” with a heartfelt tribute to his childhood friend and late-night bandleader Cleto Escobedo III, who died Tuesday at 59.\n\n\t“We’ve been on the air for almost 23 years, and I’ve had to do some hard monologues along the way,” Kimmel said, crying. “But this one’s the hardest because late last night, early this morning, we lost someone very special who was much too young to go, and I’d like to tell you about him. If you don’t mind.”\n\t\n\n\tAs Kimmel recalled his lifelong friendship with Escobedo, photos from their childhood together in Las Vegas appeared on screen. Escobedo’s father, who is in Kimmel’s band, and mother were in attendance Tuesday night. They were visibly moved by the tribute. \n\n\n\t“There was a boy who lived on my block. He lived across the street and two houses over. He was a little over a year older than me. His name was Cleto, but we all called him junior,” Kimmel explained.  “Eventually, we met and became friends. And not just regular friends. We became 24/7, ‘Mom, please let me sleep over, please,’ kind of friends. One summer, I slept over at the Escobedo house 33 nights in a row. My mother used to make me get down on my knees and beg to sleep at his house in front of him. And I would gladly do it, because we were never bored. We were always up to something.”\n\n\tKimmel remembered his lifelong companion through stories of childhood mischief before explaining how he brought Escobedo on to “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Kimmel said Escobedo was his first choice to lead his band after landing the show in 2003, although he admitted his pitch of, “‘My best friend from growing up plays the saxophone, he could lead the band,’ didn’t sound good.” Despite his reservations, Escobedo and his dad nailed the audition. \n\t\n\n\t“They played ‘Pick Up the Pieces’ by the Average White Band,” Kimmel remembered. “Lloyd saw it. He saw the father and son. He said, ‘I love it!’ And he got up and left. And we’ve been working together every day for almost 23 years.”\n\n\tKimmel later added, “Everyone here at the show we are devastated by this. It’s just not fair. He was the nicest, most humble, kind and always funny person.”\n\n\tKimmel concluded by thanking the audience. He also noted that “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” will take “the next couple of nights off” in the wake of Escobedo’s death.\n\n\tKimmel had to abruptly cancel Thursday’s episode in order to tend to Escobedo as the musician’s condition had turned worse. The host shared the news of Escobedo’s death on Instagram, writing, “To say that we are heartbroken is an understatement. Cleto and I have been inseparable since I was nine years old. The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto’s wife, children and parents in your prayers.”\n\n\tThis week’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” episodes have been touted as 80s-themed; Tuesday’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” included Eddie Murphy, Morgan Fairchild and musical guest Men At Work.\n\n\tThat isn’t the first time Kimmel has taken a personal day; perhaps most notable, he took time off as his young son Billy underwent treatment for a heart defect, which required multiple surgeries. (Billy is now said to be doing well and fully recovered.)\n\n\tKimmel is known for his close loyalty to friends and family — many of whom he employs on the show — and given that the situation involved one of his best friends, it’s no surprise that he put them first and opted to pause the Thursday show.\n\n\tWatch Kimmel’s entire tribute below. \n\n\n\n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOrwell: 2+2 = 5\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Neon\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Documentary Feature Commentary (Updated Nov. 11, 2025): As the documentary race comes into sharper focus with DOC NYC ahead, and the Critics Choice Documentary Awards just announced, it’s clear this year’s lineup is as politically charged and emotionally resonant as ever.\n\n\tAt the top of the field, Geeta Gandbhir’s “The Perfect Neighbor” has established itself as the early frontrunner. Fresh off its CCA triumph — where it claimed best documentary feature, director, editing, archival documentary and best true crime documentary — the Netflix release has cemented its status as both a critical and popular favorite. Gandbhir’s gripping exploration of “stand your ground” laws through police bodycam footage has positioned the film as the kind of urgent, socially conscious storytelling that the branch tends to reward.\n\n\tNot far behind is Laura Poitras’ “Cover-Up,” another Netflix acquisition, and a cerebral and fiercely investigative work examining journalist Seymour Hersh’s lifelong pursuit of truth. Poitras, an Oscar winner for “Citizenfour,” is no stranger to the Academy, and this latest effort could easily return her to the winner’s circle.\n\n\tPBS is in strong contention with Mstyslav Chernov’s “2000 Meters to Andriivka,” a harrowing follow-up to his Oscar-winning “20 Days in Mariupol.” The film’s inclusion in DOC NYC’s Short List section, where 13 of the last 14 Oscar winners have appeared, only strengthens its case.\n\n\tHBO’s “The Alabama Solution,” from Andrew Jarecki, brings another socially conscious angle, examining systemic failures in the American justice system. A CCA winner for best political documentary, helps bolsters its campaign as one of the year’s most urgent entries.\n\n\tApple is betting big on “Come See Me in the Good Light,” a tender and deeply human portrait from director Ryan White and producer Tig Notaro chronicling the love and resilience of two poets facing terminal illness. It continues to build quiet but meaningful momentum after positive receptions that began at Sundance.\n\n\tWatch out for Neon’s “Orwell: 2+2=5,” directed by Raoul Peck and co-produced by Alex Gibney. The philosophical essay film — which won CCA honors for best score and narration — merges historical insight with contemporary urgency, drawing parallels between Orwell’s warnings and today’s modern political doublespeak.\n\n\tAs DOC NYC kicks off its 16th edition, the race for best documentary feature feels a bit wide open. With heavyweights from Netflix, PBS, HBO and Neon all in play, the question may not be which film wins — but which kind of film, Academy voters will choose to honor this year.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited producers are subject to change.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Apple TV/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Independent Lens\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Brian Hamill \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Films (Documentary Feature)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Bayerische Staatsbibliothek/Bildarchiv\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tIndian filmmaker Kanu Behl is developing “Loving Anais,” a star-crossed romance set between India and France, as his follow-up to Cannes Directors’ Fortnight title “Agra,” which opens theatrically in India.\n\n\t“It’s kind of like star-crossed romance mixed in with noir,” Behl tells Variety. “It’s essentially about an Indian guy who goes looking for someone from Gurgaon to Bordeaux, and in his search for that someone, life takes a different turn, and he falls in love with someone else, but they don’t speak each other’s language.”\n\t\n\n\tThe project, currently heading toward first draft, has secured CNC Development Fund support. William Jehannin (“Agra”) is producing.\n\n\n\tBehl’s sexually charged drama “Agra” will receive a limited theatrical release in India via distributor Mantra Luminosity, marking a significant milestone for the director who has long hoped to reach local audiences.\n\n\tThe film follows Guru, a young single call center employee who still lives with his parents. Consumed by frustration, he plunges into a fever bordering on insanity, between pathetic fantasies, dating apps and hysterical self-harm. The film also explores the role property can play in a young man’s emancipation.\n\n\tDebutant Mohit Agarwal stars as Guru, with Priyanka Bose, Ruhani Sharma, Vibha Chibber, Sonal Jha and Aanchal Goswami in pivotal roles. Rahul Roy, known for his romantic lead roles in 1990s films including blockbuster “Aashiqui,” plays Guru’s father.\n\n\t“Making a film for independent filmmakers is not really about going to a festival,” Behl, whose debut feature “Titli” bowed at Cannes’ Un Certain Regard strand, says. “We wanted our own Indian audiences to see the film. Finally, my happiest moment is, however small the release is, however limited the marketing is, it’s out there in the world for an Indian audience to see, because really it’s an Indian story.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film will launch with a platform release strategy across 100 screens and approximately 150 shows, with plans to expand in subsequent weeks based on audience response.\n\n\tBehl expresses frustration with the infantilization of Indian audiences by mainstream cinema. “Ninety-five to 96% of the stuff we see on Indian screens… is just Disneyfied, third class, fourth class, third grader, fourth grader, kids friendly content,” he says. “I have a deep faith that people want to see more complex content. They are actually now more starved than ever before.”\n\n\tFor “Agra,” Behl is aiming to reach beyond converted arthouse audiences. “Our whole attempt with ‘Agra’ has been to try a more organic, ground up approach, rather than a top down approach,” he explains. “Even if it’s slightly inauthentic to the film, to broad base, because you’re fighting competition that is grabbing eyeballs at a different rate.”\n\n\t“What I’m trying with ‘Agra,’ knowing the kind of film it is, is to even lose authenticity, maybe to 5 or 10% but try to fight the bigger monster in a slightly more guerrilla and different way,” he adds.\n\n\tThe film explores themes of sexual repression, desire and transactionality in contemporary India. “It’s a film that functions in the margins between sexuality, sexual repression, the idea of spaces, how sexuality affects the spaces that we live in, and how the spaces in turn affect our sexual lives,” Behl says.\n\n\tHe believes audiences who give the film a chance will find it resonates deeply. “The people that are inhabiting the film are pretty much a mirror to who we are now,” he says. “I think for people who might not conventionally be interested in a film like this, it’s an opportunity to feel again and to reach that point that we used to know, that state of slightly enhanced existence.“​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n\t“Agra” releases in cinemas across India Nov. 14. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe creative team behind “Jumbo,” Indonesia’s highest-grossing film of all time, is reuniting for another family-oriented project.\n\n\tVisinema Studios is producing a live-action adaptation of “Na Willa,” based on the children’s novel by Reda Gaudiamo. The project marks the second collaboration for director-writer Ryan Adriandhy, producer Anggia Kharisma and producer Novia Puspa Sari, who previously worked together on “Jumbo.”\n\t\n\n\tSet in 1960s Surabaya, “Na Willa” centers on an imaginative young girl navigating everyday life in Indonesia. The studio describes the film as a heartfelt story celebrating childhood and Indonesian family life.\n\n\n\tThe project represents Adriandhy’s live-action feature debut following his work directing and writing “Jumbo.” Newcomer Luisa Adreena will star in the title role, alongside Irma Rihi (“Women from Rote Island”) and Junior Liem.\n\n\t“’Na Willa’ goes beyond simply adapting a story, it carries forward the spirit that made ‘Jumbo’ so special,” said Herry Salim, group president of Visinema and CEO of Visinema Studios. “With ‘Na Willa,’ our goal is to deliver a film that not only moves people but also offers a rich visual and emotional experience — one that truly delights from start to finish.”\n\n\t“I fell in love with ‘Na Willa; the moment I read the novel, its honesty and simplicity were extraordinary,” Adriandhy said. “For years, I’ve imagined how the ‘Na Willa’ world could come alive on screen and the way a child sees life.”\n\n\tAuthor Gaudiamo added: “I know ‘Na Willa’ is in the right hands of those who truly love her, and I can feel that warmth in every detail.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film is currently in production for a 2026 release in Indonesia.\n\n\tVisinema Studios has had a banner year following the success of “Jumbo,” which became both the most-watched Indonesian film and the highest-grossing Southeast Asian animated film of all time. The company has also expanded into international co-productions, including “Panggil Aku Ayah” (Call Me Dad) with CJ ENM, adapted from the Korean box office hit “Pawn.” The studio recently collaborated with Pinkfong on a special episode of puppet series “Domikado.“​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs Millennials hit the age where classic rock channels now include their music, it’s no surprise that acts are striking while the nostalgia iron is hot. And what better way to recall your youth than through emo music, the genre best-equipped for obsessing about love and death and hope and all of life’s big questions?\n\n\t2025 has been a big year for emo milestones — My Chemical Romance headlined a stadium tour! Rilo Kiley reunited! The Academy Is… announced a 20th anniversary “Almost Here” tour! — but it hasn’t yielded much new music from the genre’s A-list.\n\t\n\n\tLuckily, there’s a new generation of pop punkers who were heavily influenced by the bands of yesteryear, and among the best is Michigan-based Hot Mulligan, whose ambitious fourth album “The Sound a Body Makes When It’s Still” dropped in August. Filled with tight riffs, sharp songwriting and lead singer Tades Sanville’s unique screams, it’s the kind of album that could sound more dazzling in a studio compared to a live setting. But unlike so many of their forebears who abandoned chops in order to focus on energy, Hot Mulligan amped things up while sounding great during their Nov. 8 headlining show at the Fillmore Philadelphia.\n\n\n\tThe band charged through the first side of “Sound a Body Makes” to start the set, with drummer Brandon Blakeley and bassist Jonah Kramer creating a twisty, moving foundation to anchor even the fastest pop-punk moments. The interplay of rhythm guitarist Chris Freeman and lead Ryan Malicsi was impressive, with fast riffing and tapping that evoked midwest emo heroes like American Football. Additionally, Sanville and Freeman’s co-mingling vocals were, depending on the moment, complementary in their harmony or shredded in their screaming, without screeching into off-key territory. It’s an impressive feat to see the band’s complex elements all lock in together, especially when many genre legends were eager to step aside and let the audience sing the high notes live.\n\t\n\n\tDespite the band’s focus on craft, they were also there to have a good time and pass those vibes onto the audience. Sanville’s lengthy hair was flying as he stalked the stage, occasionally stopping to scream wildly, his body contorting as if struck by lightning. New album highlights “And a Big Load,” a breakneck dance party about the challenges of sobriety, and “Monica Lewinskibidi,” a hooky yet mournful tribute to missing a sick loved one on tour, were as sharp and blistering as anything in the band’s early work.\n\n\tMeanwhile, the hugely energetic crowd was constantly crowdsurfing and smushing against the front rail. Electricity ran through the fans, with circle pits opening during older favorites like “Shhhh! Golf Is On,” “Equip Sunglasses” and “BCKYRD.”\n\n\tUltimately, for elder Millennial emo fans whose necks get tired from headbanging and feet get sore after standing (let alone moshing!) for a 90-minute set, it’s heartening to know bands like Hot Mulligan inspire the next generation of punks to get sweaty and crazy in the GA section.\n\n\t(Pictured above: Hot Mulligan on the Nov. 7 Brooklyn stop of their tour.)\n",

    "body": "\n\tSales veteran Pia Patatian has used this year’s American Film Market to launch production and sales banner Noora Films.\n\n\tAlongside unveiling her new company, Patatian has come onboard to handle international rights on alternative period drama “Madfabulous” from BAFTA Cymru winner Celyn Jones (“The Almond and the Seahorse”). Jones directs from the debut feature script by Welsh writer Lisa Baker.\n\n\n\tInspired by the life of the fifth Marquess of Anglesey, “Madfabulous” stars Callum Scott Howells (“It’s A Sin,” “The Beautiful Game”), Ruby Stokes (“Lockwood & Co,” “Rocks”), and Rupert Everett (“Napoleon,” “The Serpent Queen”).\n\t\n\n\t“Madfabulous is a fun, yet inspiring ensemble cast film with a meaningful message,” said Patatian. “Along with our superb partners at Mad as Birds Films and the director Celyn Jones, we look forward to introducing this incredible film to international distributors at AFM. They will love it,” said Patatian, who serves as Noora CEO.\n\n\tFrom Jones’ Mad as Birds production company, the film is produced by Nadia Jaynes (“Marcella,” “The Responder”) and Sean Marley (“Poms,” “Six Minutes to Midnight”). Nicola Pearcey (“Military Wives,” “The Almond and the Seahorse”) executive produces for Picnik Entertainment, alongside Paul Baker. Jay Cohen at Gersh will handle U.S. rights.\n\n\t“With its humour, heart, and sense of irreverence, Madfabulous is a rare gem,” said Cohen. “It’s a film brimming with personality and anchored by exceptional performances. We’re proud to bring it to U.S. buyers.”\n\t\n\n\tPatatian was recently president of Cloud 9 Studios (formerly Concord Studios), which she launched last year, and led sales on titles including Paul Schrader’s Cannes competition title “Oh, Canada,” Renny Harlin’s “Deep Water” and the romantic comedy “Under the Stars” starring Toni Collette and Andy Garcia, which she also produced. Prior to that, she served as senior vice president of sales for Capstone Pictures, running the company’s operations in London, and previously served as director, international sales at Blue Box International (a label of Red Granite International). She began her career at Universal Pictures in Madrid, where she worked on “Mamma Mia” and “Inglorious Basterds.”\n\n\tNoora Films, which has offices in Europe and the U.S., aims to develop, produce and finance content for film and TV.\n",

    "description": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Tuesday, Nov. 11 episode of “Dancing With the Stars.”\n\n\tIt’s official: “Dancing With the Stars",
    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Tuesday, Nov. 11 episode of “Dancing With the Stars.”\n\n\tIt’s official: “Dancing With the Stars” is in its 20s. Tuesday’s episode of Season 34 celebrated the anniversary of the reality competition series with returning favorites — from longtime host Tom Bergeron joining as guest judge to both original pros and past winners taking on the ballroom floor for the first time in years. Plus, the episode received the most votes of all time. \n\n\tThe show opened with a routine, choreographed by Derek Hough and set to a reimagined live version of the “Dancing with the Stars Theme.” Six original professional dancers from Season 1 joined the troupe: Alec Mazo, Ashly DelGrosso, Louis van Amstel, Jonathan Roberts, Charlotte Jorgensen and Edyta Śliwińska.\n\n\tThe show also honored performers lost with an emotional number choreographed and performed by Ezra Sosa and Rylee Arnold, set to “Always Remember Us This Way” by Lady Gaga.\n\n\tAmidst it all, the competition continued with two rounds. First, the couples danced a new style to a song inspired by a past iconic freestyle routine. Robert Irwin and Witney Carson earned the first perfect 40 of the season with a routine dedicated to his late father. Ahead of his routine, his video package revealed that Prince William FaceTimed him during rehearsal. At the end of his routine, a video played of him as a little boy with his father, causing him to fall to his knees and begin to cry.\n\n\tDylan Efron and Daniella Karagach blew the judges away with his Argentine Tango; Carrie Ann Inaba mentioned that Giles Marini (who was in the audience) used to hold trophy for her favorite Argentine tango routine — but now that title goes to Dylan. He landed the second perfect score.\n\n\tAlix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy also impressed the judges with a perfect 40, as did Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas.\n\n\tThe second round marked the return of the Relay Dance competition — with a twist. This time, instead of dancing with their professional dance partner, each celeb was partnered with a former mirrorball winner. For the challenge, one couple performed one half of a song and a different couple completed the second — the judges then chose the winner of the relay, which meant three teams received two bonus points each.\n\n\tJordan Chiles and Apolo Anton Ohno kicked off the relay, dancing against quickstep against Elaine Hendrix and Rashad Jennings. Jordan and Apolo won the round.\n\n\tAndy Richter and Kaitlyn Bristowe danced the viennese waltz against Dylan and Rumer Willis — and Andy brought out the “sex appeal,” as Carrie Ann put it. Ultimately, Dylan won the extra points. \n\n\tLastly, Robert and Xochitl Gomez danced the jive against Alix and Joey Graziadei. Although Xochitl never had done a jive before and both teams had some hard falls in rehearsals, you’d never know from the performances. Val had trained both women, so it wasn’t a surprise that both dances were so strong. The judges gave the extra points to Robert. \n\n\tIn the end, Dylan, Robert and Whitney tied at the top of the leaderboard, with Andy at the bottom. After combining the judges’ scores with the audience votes, Andy was sent home. \n\n\tScroll down for all of the scores from the night.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAlix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDance: Foxtrot to “Singin’ in the Rain” by Matthew MorrisonScore: 40/40\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRobert Irwin and Witney Carson\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDance: Foxtrot to “Footprints in the Sand” by Leona LewisScore: 40/40\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWhitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDance: Argentine Tango to “Cell Block Tango” from “Chicago The Musical”Score: 40/40\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDylan Efron and Daniella Karagach\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDance: Argentine Tango to “Ain’t No Sunshine” by Bill WithersScore: 40/40\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAndy Richter and Emma Slater\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDance: Quickstep to “Puttin’ on the Ritz” by Robbie WilliamsScore: 29/40\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tElaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDance: Salsa to “It Takes Two” by Rob Base & DJ EZ RockScore: 36/40\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDance: Cha Cha to “Get Up” by Ciara featuring ChamillionaireScore: 37/40\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tField & Stream, the outdoor lifestyle brand whose owners include country singer-songwriters Morgan Wallen and Eric Church, is wading into the streaming TV era.\n\n\tField & Stream and media company Outdoor America inked a strategic partnership under which Outdoor America’s free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) channel will be rebranded as Field & Stream TV in late January 2026. The two companies also plan to launch it as a broadcast channel, with details to be announced.\n\t\n\n\tWallen and Church were part of the investor group that acquired Field & Stream’s assets in 2024. The launch of Field & Stream TV is the next extension of the company’s media footprint, adding a 24-hour television network to its print publication, website, social platforms and podcasts. The rebranded channel will feature “exclusive new content, original series and special programming, offering sponsors the largest combined audience reach in outdoor media,” the companies said.\n\n\n\tThe Field & Stream TV channel will develop original programming in collaboration with “leading outdoor storytellers, top sports producers and music partners” — including Wallen and Church — spanning hunting, fishing, camping and outdoor cooking, according to the companies.\n\n\tField & Stream said it will host a launch event for the channel at the 2026 SHOT Show, where execs plan to unveil Field & Stream TV’s flagship original programming and production partners. The SHOT (Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade) Show, operated by the Firearm Industry Trade Association, is being held Jan. 20-23, 2026, in Las Vegas.\n\t\n\n\tCurrently, the Outdoor America FAST TV channel is available on smart TV platforms including Samsung TV+, Vizio WatchFree+, LG Channels and TCLtv+; and streaming devices Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and Google Chromecast.\n\n\t“We’re thrilled to partner with the Outdoor America team to launch Field & Stream TV with a powerful and immediate distribution footprint,” Field & Stream president Doug McNamee said in a statement. “This partnership allows us to tell more stories that celebrate life outdoors — through new, exclusive programming and an unmatched ability to reach audiences and sponsors across every channel. It’s a defining step in Field & Stream’s continued evolution.”\n\n\tNick Rhodes, CEO of Outdoor America Holdings, added: “The Field & Stream name represents the gold standard of authenticity in the outdoors. Together, we’re building a world-class outdoor lifestyle network with premium programming, dynamic partnerships, and a global vision.”\n\n\tField & Stream, whose origins dated back to 1871, has taught generations how to “hunt and fish, to camp and explore, to survive and thrive in the outdoors — all while leading the charge to conserve and fight for wildlife and wild places,” the company says. Under the new ownership, Field & Stream has relaunched a print publication and introduced a membership community, co-branded and licensed product lines, and experiential brand extensions including a “modern and affordable lifestyle lodge concept.”\n",

Few films in recent memory have generated this kind of sustained affection from festivalgoers across continents.\n\n\tBut the bigger question is what that affection means for Oscar season. “Hamnet” looks destined for an awards-season tug-of-war with Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” which also shows no signs of slowing. Beyond those two juggernauts, only a handful of other contenders — like Ryan Coogler’s gothic horror film “Sinners” and perhaps Josh Safdie’s high-octane sports film “Marty Supreme” — could spark passion among industry voters. \n\n\tElsewhere, Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” and Hikari’s “Rental Family” have each picked up their share of regional honors. “Frankenstein” claimed the top prize at the SCAD Savannah Film Festival, while “Rental Family” tied with “Hamnet” at Middleburg and earned runner-up status at SCAD.\n\n\tLet’s see where it all ultimately settles. \n\n\tThis week’s updates are below, and the first official charts for international feature, documentary feature and cinematography have been released.\n\n\tTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (films): “One Battle After Another” (14); “Sinners” (13); “Hamnet” (12); “Wicked: For Good” (10); “Sentimental Value” (7)\n\n\tTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (studios): Warner Bros.

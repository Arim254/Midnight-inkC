    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron has written a letter arguing that if Netflix is successful in its bid for Warner Bros.’ studio and streaming businesses, it could cause huge job loss, change the theatrical landscape and hurt the film export business. \n\n\tThe “Avatar” filmmaker sent his letter last week to Senator Mike Lee, chair of the Senate subcommittee on antitrust, and the letter was then recently obtained by CNBC.\n\n\n\t“I believe strongly that the proposed sale of Warner Brothers Discovery to Netflix will be disastrous for the theatrical motion picture business that I have dedicated my life’s work to,” Cameron wrote in the letter. “Of course, my films all play in the downstream video markets as well, but my first love is the cinema.”\n\t\n\n\tCameron predicted that if the number of big-budget films such as he makes contracts, “Theaters will close. Fewer films will be made. The job losses will spiral.”\n\n\t“The business model of Netflix is directly at odds with the theatrical film production and exhibition business, which employs hundreds of thousands of Americans,” he wrote. “It is therefore directly at odds with the business model of the Warner Brothers movie division, one of the few remaining major movie studios.”\n\n\tLee answered with a statement saying, “We have received outreach from actors, directors, and other interested parties about the proposed Netflix and Warner Brothers merger, and I share many of their concerns. I look forward to holding a follow-up hearing to further address these issues.”\n\n\tCameron also contends that exports of Hollywood films would suffer in a Netflix-Warners merger. “The U.S. may no longer lead in auto or steel manufacturing, but it is still the world leader in movies. That will change for the worse.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\t“WWE SmackDown” is getting a temporary new home this week thanks to the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\n\t“SmackDown” normally airs on the USA Network, but the channel has switched over to 24/7 Olympic programming until Feb. 22. Most scripted shows on USA Network are on pause during the Olympics, but since “WWE SmackDown” is a weekly live event — held in front of live arena audiences — it has had to find a new temporary broadcast home.\n\n\n\tWant to watch “Friday Night SmackDown?” The show moved to the Syfy channel for the Feb. 13 broadcast and will also air on Syfy for the Feb. 20 airing. You can watch “SmackDown” on TV with any cable package that includes the specialty channel in its offerings. The start time for the show remains the same, with an 8 p.m. ET air time.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow to Watch “WWE SmackDown” Live Online on Syfy\t\n\n\tDon’t have cable or want to stream “SmackDown” on Syfy online? You can watch the wrestling show online through DirecTV, which offers 90+ live television channels that you can stream without cable. DirecTV’s channel lineup includes a live Syfy feed, so you can use the streamer to watch “SmackDown” live online. Test drive the service with a five-day free trial here and use it to watch “SmackDown” on Syfy online free.\n\n\tDirecTV lets you watch Syfy and other live TV channels through your computer, tablet, smartphone or smart TV.\n\n\tAnother way to stream “SmackDown” on Syfy is by signing up for Sling. The live streamer’s Sling Blue package costs just $54.99/month for 40+ channels, including Syfy. Use Sling to livestream “WWE SmackDown” online without cable. Sling Blue lets you stream on up to three devices at a time and includes DVR so you can record the broadcast to watch a replay back on-demand later.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow to Watch “WWE SmackDown” on Peacock\t\n\n\tAnother way to watch “WWE SmackDown” online? Every episode of “Friday Night SmackDown” is available to watch on-demand through Peacock, the day after it airs on TV. That means the Syfy episodes will be on the NBCUniversal streaming service for you to stream online.\n\n\tIn addition to streaming the Olympics and the recent Super Bowl, Peacock is the official streaming partner for the WWE, and it’s also where you’ll be able to watch live wrestling events like “SummerSlam,” “Wrestlemania,” “Royal Rumble” and others.\n\n\tThe move from USA Network to Syfy won’t affect “SmackDown’s” air dates or schedule. The show still airs at 8 p.m. on Friday night and will remain a three-hour broadcast.\n\n\tThis week’s show brings the stars to the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville, Kentucky, with Carmelo Hayes vs. Trick Williams vs. Damian Priest in the men’s Elimination Chamber qualification match. It’s Nia Jax vs. Charlotte Flair vs. Kiana James for the women’s Elimination Chamber qualification. \n\n\tThe Elimination Chamber 2026 takes place a week later, on Feb. 28 in Chicago as a Premium Live Event airing on ESPN Unlimited.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDaniel Radcliffe was the latest guest on “Hot Ones” and revealed one of the worst pitches he’s ever gotten in his career was for a “Wizard of Oz” remake headlined by the original “Harry Potter” film franchise trio: Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. The idea was hatched during the heyday of the “Potter” movies.\n\n\t“One of the worst ideas I’ve ever heard, during Potter, somebody came to us and I think asked, like they wanted to cast all three of us, me, Emma and Rupert, in a remake of ‘Wizard of Oz,’ where Emma was Dorothy,” Radcliffe said. “I can’t remember what Rupert was, and I just remember that I was gonna be the lion but also he knew karate.”\n\t\n\n\t“I was like a karate kicking cowardly lion,” he continued. “And I remember I was like 14 or 15 and I was like, ‘I don’t know a lot about the world, but this is a bad idea and it should not be made.'”\n\n\n\tThis “Wizard of Oz” remake never got off the ground, although Hollywood dabbled with a return trip to Oz in 2013 with Sam Raimi’s prequel movie “Oz the Great and Powerful.” James Franco headlined the film in the title role opposite Mila Kunis, Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz as the witches of Oz. The movie was a decent box office success with nearly $500 million worldwide, although Oz truly flexed its big screen muscles with the “Wicked” movies in 2024 and 2025. The films grossed a combined $1.2 billion worldwide. \n\n\tAs for Radcliffe, he starred with Watson and Grint in eight “Harry Potter” movies released between 2001 and 2011. The trio’s work together on screen remains exclusively in the “Potter” movies. They reunited on television for “Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts,” which streamed in January 2022 on HBO Max.\n\t\n\n\tWatch Radcliffe’s full interview on “Hot Ones” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNew “Hello Kitty” comic books will soon launch as part of a collaboration between Japan’s Sanrio and comics giant IDW Publishing.\n\n\tThe new multi-title partnership will begin with the debut of the “Hello Kitty: Hello World” comic book series July 22 in connection with San Diego Comic Con.\n\n\tPer Sanrio and IDW, the new comic book is described as “a classic and lovable depiction of Sanrio’s characters as Hello Kitty and Friends go on a world tour to solve a riddle. As they discover new riddles around the globe, they will also meet new characters in every single issue!”\n\t\n\n\tThe “Hello Kitty: Hello World” series is written by Mariko Tamaki (“This One Summer,” “Zatanna: Bring Down the House”) and animated by artist Cody Lemieux (“Despite, Despite, Despite,” “Gnome Granny”).\n\n\n\tFollowing the launch of “Hello Kitty: Hello World” this summer, more “Hello Kitty” comics and some “crossovers” will be released from IDW Publishing in 2027.\n\n\tThe Hello Kitty brand has exploded in popularity since Sanrio first introduced the character in 1974, spawning an ever-growing merch line and multiple media projects, including the upcoming feature film from Warner Bros. Pictures Animation and New Line Cinema, set to release in July 2028.\n\n\t“It’s truly an honor to team up with Sanrio to create ‘Hello Kitty’ comics,” IDW Publishing CEO Davidi Jonas said. “We’re thrilled to craft comics that celebrate the cute and fun spirit of the franchise while uplifting readers of every age. We can’t wait for these comics to bring inspiring and joyful stories to comic shops everywhere.”\n\t\n\n\t“It’s time! Hello Kitty and her friends are coming to the comic world with IDW,” associate editor Bixie Mathieu said. ”These beloved characters have been delighting fans for generations, and it’s easy to see why– their joy, whimsy, and friendship make for uplifting storytelling! With so many talented people pouring their hearts into these series, we promise longtime and new fans alike that these stories will be a delight, from the core of their storytelling to the exuberant art on the page! If you’re interested in a heartfelt reading experience unlike anything else, hello!”\n\n\tSee below for a first look at two of the “Hello Kitty: Hello World!” comic book covers, the first by artist Justine King and the second by Min Ho Kim.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAn-Li Bogan has been cast in the untitled NBC drama pilot from Dean Georgaris and John Fox, Variety has learned. \n\n\tBogan will star alongside previously announced lead Emily Deschanel in the pilot, which is inspired by the real-life work of internationally renowned expert profiler and author Dr. Ann Burgess. \n\n\tThe logline for the pilot states, “Professor Georgia Ryan (Deschanel) is a trailblazing psychologist who challenges the field of criminology by shifting the investigative focus to the victim rather than just the perpetrator in order to uncover the crucial clues that more traditional methods leave behind. Alongside her team, this pioneering expert consults with the FBI to solve the most baffling and elusive cases.”\n\t\n\n\tBogan will play Natalie Washington. Per the official character description, “She lives with hyperthymesia, a rare condition that allows her to remember every moment of every day of her life with perfect clarity. This extraordinary gift makes her an unparalleled investigative asset: details others forget, she recalls instantly; patterns others miss, she sees immediately.”\n\n\n\tBogan is known for her roles in films like “The American Society of Magical Negroes” and shorts like “Let” and “Half Moon.” She recently wrapped shooting in the indie feature “Echo Lake.” She has also appeared in TV shows like “Bull” and “Elementary” at CBS\n\n\tBogan is repped by Gersh and Brillstein Entertainment Partners. \n\n\tGeorgaris and Fox are writers and executive producers on the pilot, with John Davis executive producing via Davis Entertainment. Deschanel will produce in addition to starring. Burgess is a consulting producer, as is Steve Constantine. Universal Television will produce.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRoblox is being sued by Los Angeles County over accusations of failing to protect children from predatory behavior, marking the latest of this kind of lawsuit leveled against the popular gaming platform.\n\n\tFiled Thursday, the lawsuit accuses Roblox of marketing “itself as a safe digital space for creativity” and says it “is in reality an unsafe online environment that has become a breeding ground for predators.”\n\n\n\tPer the county, “The lawsuit alleges that children in Los Angeles County have been repeatedly exposed to sexually explicit content, exploitation and grooming on Roblox because the company chooses to put corporate profit over the safety of children. The lawsuit further alleges that Roblox has failed to implement effective moderation or age verification systems, despite repeated public assurances that its platform is safe for kids.”\n\t\n\n\tRoblox has beefed up its safety protocols over the past year, including now requiring all users to verify their age with its facial estimation tech tool.\n\n\tStill, the company is currently facing lawsuits similar to the L.A. County suit over children’s safety protections in Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Florida and Kentucky. Roblox brass have previously said the claims in these suits are over events that “happened five years ago” and underline their current safety standards and ongoing changes.\n\n\tIn a statement issued to L.A.’s Fox11 Thursday, Roblox said: “We strongly dispute the claims in this lawsuit and will defend against it vigorously. Roblox is built with safety at its core, and we continue to evolve and strengthen our protections every day. We have advanced safeguards that monitor our platform for harmful content and communications, and users cannot send or receive images via chat, avoiding one of the most prevalent opportunities for misuse seen elsewhere online. Safety is a constant and consistent focus of our work. We take swift action against anyone found to violate our safety rules and work closely with law enforcement to support investigations and help hold bad actors accountable. There is no finish line when it comes to protecting kids, and while no system can be perfect, our commitment to safety never ends. Parents can visit our Safety Center to learn more about our safety work and ways to keep their children safe online: roblox.com/safetycenter, including talking with their children about internet risks.”\n\t\n\n\tRepresentatives for Roblox did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for further comment Thursday.\n",

Graynor is repped by Entertainment 360, Gersh, and LGN Law. \n\n\tSeason 4 of “The White Lotus” is due to start shooting later this year. The series has proven to be a major hit for HBO and a cultural touchstone since it originally debuted in 2021. The series has racked up 68 Emmy nominations to date with 16 wins, including back to back statuettes for Season 1 and 2 star Jennifer Coolidge.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tWho will Warner Bros. Discovery employees welcome as their new overlords? The feeling among the rank-and-file has changed over the last several months: Most WBD staffers are now supportive of Netflix‘s deal to acquire Warner Bros.’s studios and HBO Max rather than having WBD subsumed in its entirety by David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance, sources tell Variety.\n\n\tInside Warner Bros. Discovery, the “Paramount vs. Netflix” debate seems to largely have been resolved. Having more than two months to consider what an acquisition by either conglomerate might mean for the legacy of Warner Bros. — and more important, for the current workforce — there appears to be a rather large consensus now that Netflix would be preferable. \n\t\n\n\tBut that doesn’t mean that everyone is rooting for Netflix to win the prolonged sale process. On the Burbank lot, big pockets of skepticism remain about how Netflix’s ownership will affect the film studio and the future of theatrical distribution in general, despite the repeated pledges made by Netflix brass about committing to a 45-day exhibition window for theatrical films.\n\n\n\tBut Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters have won over many WBD staffers with their assurances and vision for how they plan to operate the combined company. There is now “some familiarity with the idea” and acceptance of the possibility that big chunks of WBD will become part of Netflix, says one Warner Bros. Discovery corporate exec.\n\n\tAt this moment, Warner Bros. Discovery is still in play: The company opened a seven-day window for talks with Paramount Skydance, with Netflix’s approval, to see if Ellison and his backers will raise their bid over the $30/share they have stuck with in their most recent offers. For now, WBD’s board is still recommending investors vote for the Netflix deal at the March 20 special meeting of shareholders. The negotiating window with Paramount ends Monday, Feb. 23, and Warner Bros. Discovery is set to hold its Q4 2025 earnings call just a few days later on Feb. 26 — when things could still be up in the air. (Netflix has four days to make a counteroffer in the event Paramount puts forward a higher bid.)\n\t\n\n\tAccording to insiders, following the Netflix-WBD Dec. 5 deal announcement — and Paramount’s launch of a hostile takeover effort — the initial sentiment inside Warner Bros. was divided depending on the division, based on where staffers thought strategically they might fare better: under Paramount or Netflix ownership.\n\n\tIn the early stages, there were definitely departments that thought Paramount might be a better choice. Some at HBO, for example, figured that HBO Max would easily be the bigger dog vs. Paramount+. And at the Warner Bros. studios, there was the fear that Netflix would shift the strategy for productions to feed its own streaming beast.\n\n\tBut Paramount Skydance’s unrelentless cost cutting and layoffs since that deal closed in August became a warning sign for WBD staffers that the same would likely happen at Warner Bros. Discovery should a merger happen. Paramount has forecast upwards of $6 billion in cost synergies if it merged with WBD — which would mean big job cuts.\n\n\tUnder Netflix, according to the company’s plan, the film studio, the lot, the TV studio will all survive — and remain Warner Bros.-branded. Many of the film folks inside Warner Bros., who initially bought into the worries that Sarandos would kill the theatrical exhibition business, have come to believe that Netflix plans to keep the Warner Bros. business mostly intact.\n\n\tOne WBD insider says that, when the bidding war first erupted, “nobody wanted a transaction.” There was already sense of “weariness from the integration of the two companies” following Discovery Communications’ merger with WarnerMedia, which closed in April 2022. When news of Paramount’s interest in acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery came out in September, WBD employees were still processing the company’s planned split into two entities: one with studios and streaming, and the other mostly housing linear TV networks.\n\n\tRegarding Netflix’s proposed acquisition, a key moment in changing hearts and minds at WBD came on Dec. 17 when, two weeks after announcing their deal with WBD, Sarandos and Peters visited the Warner Bros. studio lot, hosted by Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav, and the Netflix duo addressed employees in a town hall-style appearance.\n\n\t“Ted and Greg really worked at it,” a WBD exec says. “They spoke directly about their intentions and why they wanted it. That put a lot of people in a better place about it.”\n\t\n\n\tSays another insider, “Even HBO seems to be at peace with Netflix more than it was at the beginning.” HBO execs realized they could follow John Landgraf’s model of FX (housed within the Disney Entertainment division) of being a prestige, stand-alone brand inside the new company, for example.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Paramount Skydance’s Ellison cozy relationship with the Trump administration has given WBD staffers pause — as has the recent moves by the company to swing CBS News to the right, under the leadership of Bari Weiss, CBS News’ editor-in-chief. “People quickly saw the craziness of the Ellisons,” one WBD employee says.\n\n\tUnder the Netflix deal, WBD networks like CNN, TBS, HGTV and Food Network would be spun off into Discovery Global, a new company headed by Gunnar Wiedenfels as CEO. Paramount is proposing to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in toto. And Paramount’s recent moves with CBS News as well as CBS’s lawyers intervening to keep an interview with Democratic senate candidate James Talarico off “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” broadcast have disturbed those within the TV side of WBD’s house.\n\n\t“To watch CBS News crumble is disconcerting when Paramount is trying to come in and buy Warner Bros. Discovery including CNN,” says a CNN source. Under Weiss’ leadership, for example, 11 members out of a production staff of about 40 on “CBS Nightly News” have opted to take buyouts as a new round of layoffs could be coming. Variety recently reported that CBS News “is veering toward dysfunction, with a management team led by Bari Weiss that doesn’t value the standards held by veteran journalists.” The best outcome for CNN, the news network staffer believes, is to be part of the Discovery Global fold.\n\n\tMeanwhile, the evidence of what happened when Disney purchased the 21st Century Fox assets — which essentially erased an entire Hollywood studio — is fresh for Warner Bros. staffers, many of whom are lifers or have spent decades on the Burbank lot. There’s a specific Warner Bros. culture that comes from a company that has managed to stay mostly intact despite several ownership changes in recent years. The question of what happens to the Warner Bros. lot, as well as the Warner Bros. film and TV studios, is alarming when staffers there ponder the likelihood that, if Paramount is the winning suitor, those legendary properties could undergo a dramatic upheaval. For his part, Ellison has promised that a combined Paramount-Warner Bros. would produce at least 30 films for theatrical release annually.\n\t\n\n\tLong before Netflix signed a deal to buy Warner Bros., the studio’s personnel had resigned themselves to the fact that Zaslav’s ultimate plan was probably to sell the company. There are still widespread suspicions that Netflix would honor the film’s slate existing theatrical commitments — before ultimately shortening the windows to the point where the theater business is threatened.\n\n\tOne top media executive predicted that Sarandos might be more interested in theatrical than his public comments about its the moviegoing experience being “outdated” might suggest, noting that he loses out on many top projects because Netflix can’t promise a more robust rollout in cinemas. There’s also the incremental revenue streams that ticket sales could open up as well as a chance to raise the cultural profile of the films that hit theaters before they premiere on the service, to say nothing of Warner’s arsenal of intellectual property.\n\n\t“This is a long-term play,” the executive predicted. “It can get Netflix into consumer products and theme parks. It opens up a lot of avenues.”\n\n\tSarandos, for his part, has said his comments that were dismissive of the movie-theater experience came before Netflix was in a position to own a major supplier in the theatrical business. “I want to win opening weekend. I want to win box office,” Sarandos said in a recent interview with the New York Times.\n\n\tThe Warner Bros. film studio’s leaders, Pam Abdy and Michael De Luca, are riding high on a series of box office successes like “Sinners” and “Weapons” that could make them a valuable addition to either Netflix or Paramount. But those companies already have a talented crop of executives in place who may not want to share authority. As for James Gunn and Peter Safran, the heads of DC Studios, their jobs seem more secure with production about to start in a few weeks on “Superman: Man of Tomorrow” and the long-awaited sequel to “The Batman” potentially hitting cameras by the end of May. Replacing them at this juncture would likely be too disruptive.\n\n\tIf there’s any piece of advice Warner Bros. execs have for Netflix, it’s to keep the current Warner Bros. structure as intact as possible inside the new entity. Keep it functional, and that will help make the transition more of a success, sources say.\n\t\n\n\tOf course, the looming prospect of a major M&A event is top-of-mind for everyone at Warner Bros. Discovery’s divisions. But until a deal is done — and closed — it’s got to be business as usual. “Everyone is thinking about it,” one WBD staffer says. “The main vibe is, people want this to be resolved.” For now, this insider says: “It’s heads-down and truck along and do your thing.”\n\n\tAs one WB studio employee confessed: “People just want this to be over.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOnce can be written off. Twice can be explained. Three starts to look like a trend.\n\n\tThe Academy Awards’ supporting actress race is quietly approaching that kind of tipping point. With Teyana Taylor and Wunmi Mosaku both in contention, the Oscars could soon deliver something that has never happened before: three Black women winning the same acting category consecutively. If Taylor wins for “One Battle After Another,” or Mosaku wins for “Sinners,” it would mark the first time in the Academy’s 98-year history that Black women have won best supporting actress three years in a row. They would follow the triumphs of Da’Vine Joy Randolph for “The Holdovers” and Afro-Latina Zoe Saldaña for “Emilia Pérez.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the context of Oscar history, it would carry enormous weight, since no Black actresses have ever won three consecutive years — in the same category — at any major entertainment ceremony, including the Emmys and Tonys. Currently in the Broadway realm, Kara Young has won two consecutive Tonys, most recently for “Purpose,” following her win for “Purlie Victorious: A Non-Confederate Romp Through the Cotton Patch.” Perhaps the three-peat streak can continue in this year’s Tonys race where theater hopefuls such as Samira Wiley (“Proof”), Anika Noni Rose (“The Balusters”) and Kristolyn Lloyd (“Liberation”) will be looking to contend.\n\n\n\tThe showings for Black actresses in the entertainment space have been dire. Since the first Academy Awards ceremony in 1929, more than 3,100 Oscar statuettes have been awarded. Only 20 are held by Black women — roughly 0.6% of the total. To put it in further context, the number of Black actresses who have won Oscars (10) is less than the number of nominations Meryl Streep has received throughout her career (21). It’s a blunt measure of how often the industry’s most premier honor has overlooked Black women, particularly in acting categories, which shape careers and cultural memory, and factor into production and promotional budgets for future projects.\n\t\n\n\tTo be clear, a three-peat in supporting actress would not erase that imbalance. However, it would signal something the Oscars have rarely managed: sustained recognition rather than a one-off “moment.”I mean, look at how it all began.\n\n\tHattie McDaniel became the first Black acting winner when she won supporting actress for “Gone with the Wind” (1939) at the 12th ceremony. The next Black woman to win an acting Oscar wasn’t until 51 years later, when Whoopi Goldberg won for “Ghost” (1990). Another 11 years passed before Halle Berry became the first — and still only — Black woman to win lead actress for “Monster’s Ball” (2001).\n\n\tThat history helps explain why supporting actress has become a focal point. Of the 20 Black women who have won Oscars across all categories, 10 have been in the supporting actress category. In the last 20 years alone, the category has crowned eight of them, a run that reads like significant progress, but also serves as a reminder of how limited the pipeline has been elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTeyana Taylor in “One Battle After Another.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\tNew York-born Taylor blazed onto the film scene with her breakout turn in the indie drama “A Thousand and One” (2023), before taking on the role of radical revolutionary Perfidia Beverly Hills in Paul Thomas Anderson’s political action epic. Thus far, she’s won 10 precursor awards, including the Golden Globe, the second-most among her competitors. Trailing her by only one is Mosaku, the Nigerian and British actor who plays the hoodoo-practicing Annie in Ryan Coogler’s vampire drama “Sinners.”\n\n\tWith the BAFTA and Actor Awards still to come, and final Oscar voting set to open on Feb. 26, the two are in a tight race alongside their fellow nominees, Amy Madigan from “Weapons” and the “Sentimental Value” duo Elle Fanning and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas.\n\n\tThe race is also unfolding alongside a broader awards-season story anchored by “Sinners,” which is leading the 98th Academy Awards with 16 nominations. Across those nominations, 10 Black artists are recognized, tying the all-time record for a single film producing the most Black nominees in Oscar history.\n\n\t“Sinners” is also stacking firsts that help explain why a potential supporting actress streak would fit into a larger shift. Zinzi Coogler, one of the film’s producers and Ryan Coogler’s wife, is the first Filipina producer nominated for best picture and the third Black woman nominated in the category. In the crafts, Black and Filipina cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw is the first woman of color nominated in the category. Production designer Hannah Beachler extends her legacy as the only Black woman ever nominated for and to win production design for “Black Panther” (2018), earning her second invitation to the ceremony.\n\t\n\n\tAnd then there’s, of course, costume designer Ruth E. Carter, a name that has become the industry standard for record-making Black women. Her fifth nomination for “Sinners” makes her the most-nominated Black woman in Oscar history across any category, surpassing actress Viola Davis. In 2019, Carter became the first Black person to win a costume design Oscar for “Black Panther”; then, in 2022, she won again for the sequel “Wakanda Forever,” making her the only Black woman — actor, filmmaker or artisan — to have more than one Oscar in her possession.\n\n\tSome other awards bodies have also been telegraphing a shift. The last five Golden Globe winners for supporting actress have been Black women: Ariana DeBose for “West Side Story,” Angela Bassett for “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” Randolph for “The Holdovers,” Saldaña for “Emilia Pérez” and Taylor for “One Battle After Another.”\n\n\tTaylor arrives as a legitimate Oscar threat with the kind of adoration and critics reviews that make voters take notice. Mosaku arrives with something else: the full industry weight and love of “Sinners,” a film that has become both an awards-season juggernaut and a cultural moment.\n\n\tIt would be easy to treat a potential three-year supporting actress streak as trivia — the kind of stat that gets mentioned, applauded and filed away. But that 0.6% figure doesn’t allow for casual framing.\n\n\tFor nearly a century, Black women’s presence in the Academy’s official record has been disproportionately small, even as their influence on American performance, storytelling and style has been enormous. That’s what makes this season’s “firsts” both celebratory and instructive. They are still happening in a ceremony nearing its centennial, which means the barriers they represent remain. If Taylor or Mosaku wins on March 15, the Academy will do something it has never done. And the Oscars, for once, will not simply be offering a moment, rather confirming what we’ve known all along: Black women are great.\n\n\tFinal Oscar voting will take place from Feb. 26 to March 5. The 98th Oscars will be held March 15 and will air on ABC, hosted by Conan O’Brien. This week’s updated Oscar predictions are below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWunmi Mosaku in “Sinners”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOscars Predictions Tracking(Feb. 19, 2026)\t\n\n\tBest Picture: “Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — Zinzi Coogler, Sev Ohanian and Ryan Coogler\n\n\tDirector: Ryan Coogler, “Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\n\n\tActor: Ethan Hawke, “Blue Moon” (Sony Pictures Classics)\n\t\n\n\tActress: Jessie Buckley, “Hamnet” (Focus Features)\n\n\tSupporting Actor: Stellan Skarsgård, “Sentimental Value” (Neon)\n\n\tSupporting Actress: Teyana Taylor, “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)\n\n\tOriginal Screenplay: “Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — Ryan Coogler\n\n\tAdapted Screenplay: “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.) — Paul Thomas Anderson\n\n\tCasting: “Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — Francine Maisler\n\n\tAnimated Feature: “KPop Demon Hunters” (Netflix) — Maggie Kang, Chris Appelhans and Michelle L.M.

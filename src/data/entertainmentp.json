    "body": "\n\tChris Pratt appeared on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast on his press tour for “Mercy” and revealed that he has a “fucking great” idea for how to bring Star Lord back to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. What that idea is remains under wraps. Pratt last played Peter Quill/Star-Lord in 2023’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” which promised via credits scene text that Star Lord would return. \n\n\t“I’m happy to do anything they want me to do and will,” Pratt said about Marvel. “And also, I personally have a really strong vision of what I would want him to do. And I think it’s fucking great.” \n\t\n\n\tWhen asked if he pitched this idea already to Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige, Pratt responded: “Yep. And I think that, you know, I’m down to contribute any way I can to them setting up the next 10 years of storytelling, you know? And also, I have a pretty strong idea of how I think I could contribute to that.”\n\n\n\tIt remains to be seen whether or not Pratt’s Star Lord pops up in “Avengers: Doomsday” or “Avengers: Secret Wars,” although he was not included in the official cast announcement for the former Marvel tentpole. James Gunn directed Pratt in all three “Guardians” movies but has since moved on to oversee DC Studios with movies such as “Superman” and its upcoming sequel “Man of Tomorrow.”\n\n\t“In a dream world, it would be somehow James,” Pratt said of who would direct a new movie with Star-Lord. “But I don’t think that’s likely to happen. So I’d have to think about who would be the right director. There are amazing directors out there.”\n\n\tPratt remains close with Gunn. The actor said he even sent the director a photo of himself with a Batman mask photoshopped onto his face as an impromptu pitch to play the Dark Knight in “The Brave and the Bold,” which will introduce Batman into Gunn’s DC Universe.\n\t\n\n\t“I did it in photoshop and [James] just said, ‘Haha,'” Pratt said. ‘It’s safe to say I am not going to be Batman.”\n\n\tWatch Pratt’s full interview on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tA few days after announcing the first single from his new album, Harry Styles has released “Aperture,” the first taste of his upcoming fourth album “Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally.”\n\n\t“Aperture,” which Styles previewed for fans at global record stores on Wednesday, is a slow-burning, five-minute tune, kicking off with a throbbing synth line before the percussion kicks in. On the chorus, Styles sings, “We belong together, it finally appears it’s only love.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t“Aperture” arrives just hours after Styles announced his “Together, Together” tour that will see the singer performing 50 dates in seven cities including Amsterdam, London, Sao Paulo, Mexico City, New York City, Melbourne and Sydney. Styles will stage residencies in each location, including a staggering 30 nights at NYC’s Madison Square Garden. The 2026 tour will also feature special guests include Robyn, Shania Twain, Fcukers, Jorja Smith, Jamie xx, Fousheé and Skye Newman across select dates.\n\n\n\tAll of this is pushing towards “Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally,” which Styles announced last week. His fourth album, releasing on March 6, will feature 12 tracks and is executive produced by Kid Harpoon, who previously worked with Styles on his 2022 album “Harry’s House.”\n\n\tThe album was rumored to be in the works for months, and Styles began teasing it with a series of billboards and advertisements in cities from New York to Madrid and Rome. At the end of 2025, he kicked up buzz for the record with the surprise release of a music video for his instrumental “Forever, Forever,” shot at the final “Love on Tour” date in 2023.\n\t\n\n\tStyles last released “Harry’s House” in 2022, spawning the massive hit “As It Was.” That album went on to win the Grammy Award for best album the following year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDocumentary filmmaker Leslie Iwerks was in the middle of editing Disney+’s “The Imagineering Story,” watching archival footage, when she thought, “Wouldn’t it be cool if we could sit in the footage and not cut away to talking heads?” That idea became the foundation for her latest feature, “Disneyland Handcrafted”  – an inside look at Walt Disney’s dream to build the Happiest Place on Earth, known today as Disneyland, and the artistry and grit it took to create it.\n\t\n\n\tIwerks focuses on the trials and tribulations of the year leading up to the opening day of Walt Disney’s original magic kingdom in 1955. The documentary delves into the period using archival footage to examine what was happening on-site during Disneyland’s construction. Unearthed 16mm film reels, unused from the production of “Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color” and stored in vaults for years, along with original audio and video, help tell the story.\n\n\n\tThe title, she explains, came from the editing room. “There were so many shots of hands and the cameramen were really focusing on the craftsmanship. That’s really what we were leaning into,  [showing] that this was hand forged, this was handcrafted.”\n\t\n\t\tYou had this idea to tell a story purely through archival footage. Where did you begin?\t\n\n\tWe [made] a seven-minute proof of concept, and we put sound effects to it, because there was no sound to any of this footage. We had to carefully craft sound effects to make it come alive. That was a whole new layer of reality. We started thinking, well, “Let’s add sound bites.” We looked at audio interviews about the making of the park, and when we started researching all these interviews, we started realizing that so much of what people talked about was how difficult it was, what the challenges were, how impossible it was and how crazy it was. That became the story of what we wanted to tell.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a treasure trove of Disney archives. What was that footage like when you received it?\t\n\n\tDisney had scanned this stuff back in 2014. But to my knowledge, nobody had really used the 2K. We cut it and used it. Once we got to a rough cut, we took it to Different by Design, the post house in Santa Monica, and we were able to clean up the footage and restore some of the footage that had a lot of grain or hairs or lines in it. There were probably close to 4000 frames that we cleaned up hand by hand.\n\n\tFrom the audio standpoint, there was no audio, so my number one choice was Skywalker Sound. They came to me with Bonnie Wild, a re-recording mixer. She spent at least a week mixing this whole thing. They were editing and putting in sound effects, shot by shot, authentic to what you see.\n\n\tThey spent a day on sound effects – footsteps in the dirt to the cement getting dumped on the ground, to the scraping of the cement getting laid in, and the rock. Bonnie said it was one of the hardest projects she’s done, and this was harder because it’s real. You had to be completely authentic.\n\t\n\t\tGoing behind-the-scenes of the Jungle Cruise is fascinating, seeing the detail of the animatronics of the ride, but also how the alligator’s individual teeth were handcrafted and all that went into building it. What made you include that?\t\n\n\tWhen we were doing Jungle Cruise, we saw that footage. It was fascinating to see Harper Goff trying to put the rock work together. We saw his interviews, talking about the budget, and he wasn’t good at math. These are real human stories about trying to construct something and not really knowing, and Walt being able to say, “I actually know what the budget is, and you need to be cognizant of that.”\n\n\tThe sweetness of being on that boat is that he’s trying to figure out whether the people in the boat are going to get too wet. The fact that Walt sneaks on the back of the boat without him knowing was just really cute. You’re seeing the park in its original DNA.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWas there something that you learned about Walt as you were putting this together?\t\n\n\tWhat really stood out for me in this was Walt’s humility. Early on, when you see him being interviewed, they’re saying, “Well, you’re the greatest genius ever.” And he says, “Well, I hope I can live up to that.” I just felt this worry that he had at that point, that there are people over-promising, and is he going to under-deliver? Setting up the film in that way sets the stage for all the drama that’s coming after.\n\n\tWhen you hear at the very end, it’s not about holding a bunch of money, it’s about giving it back. It’s about putting it to use. I think a lesson, especially in today’s world, I feel like there’s a lot of purity lessons here that will remind us of just good values.\n\t\n\t\tDid Bob Iger give you any notes on the documentary?\t\n\n\tHe did. I showed him a fine cut, and he said it was very emotional. He really loved it, and he said, “I would add even more conflict.” He was like, “Go deep, go hard with the conflict.” When I saw him again, I said, “Thanks for your note.” He goes, “Oh, you took it. Oh, that’s sweet.” We probably would have done it anyway; it was still not finished yet because we were still editing.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\n\t“Disneyland Handcrafted” premieres Jan. 22 on Disney+ and Disney’s YouTube channel.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Very Important People” has returned for its third season on Dropout and Vic Michaelis‘ alter ego Host Vic is working overtime to make sure their interview subjects are as interesting as possible. But in typical Vic fashion, the host has zero control over the situation in Season 3, and that has never been truer than in last week’s episode, “Fanoli.” \n\n\tFeaturing comedian Angela Giarratana in the role of the fictionarl iconic-but-now-washed-up singer, the Season 3 episode sees Vic struggle through an interview they hoped would be all about speaking with Fanoli, one of their favorite singers, about Cher, another one of their favorite singers. Unfortunately, the feud between Fanoli and Cher immediately shuts that down.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to Michaelis, it’s really just a happy coincidence this episode, which was taped months prior, aired during 2026’s Cheraissance.\n\n\n\t“Little could we have known how topically relevant this would be with Cher, obviously, being in Bowen Yang’s last episode of ‘SNL,’ being very in the cultural zeitgeist with the Dax Shepard interview,” Michaelis told Variety. “So it’s kind of a perfect time for a new Cher feud to come about.”\n\n\tSee below for more from Variety‘s interview with Michaelis about Dropout’s “Very Important People” Season 3 and their role on Peacock’s Emilia Clarke and Haley Lu Richardson-led spy series “Ponies.”\n\t\n\t\tFirst, how is your tenure as honorary president of Dropout going?\t\n\n\tI feel like I’m making a lot of really important structural changes. There’s been a lot of pushback within the organization, and I’m not letting that stop me from fulfilling my agenda. And I think that’s really important. I’m making sure that we have TV screens in all of the bathrooms, so that way people can watch “Avengers: Endgame,” really know what we’re playing for. Henry the Pig has a really important position in the cabinet. There’s lots of big changes here. We’re spending money left, right and center, but I think it’s going to come back to us tenfold.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWith the upcoming release of “Avengers: Doomsday,” do you want to campaign to get that on Dropout as well?\t\n\n\tI don’t, because, if anything, I think that that’s going to help our goal of getting “Endgame” on the platform. We’ve got a new “Avengers” coming out. Disney, don’t be greedy. There’s too many “Avengers” on Disney+, let’s unload one for you\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKate Elliott/Dropout\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI know Host Vic turned it down in the episodes — but will you reconsider making Fanoli’s “I Don’t Want Money, I Don’t Even Like It, I Just Want to Throw It Away” the official “VIP” theme song?\t\n\n\tListen, it’s catchy. And here’s the thing about Host Vic — I want to say a firm no, but if people seem to really like it, then I’m willing to throw away any and every moral high ground I have in order to make people happy. So probably not, but also a definite possibility.\n\t\n\t\tAs we now know, Fanoli has a giant feud with Cher and this becomes a major part of his “VIP” interview. Did that start with you? At what point in the improv process was the Cher feud introduced to be such a heavy plot point for Fanoli?\t\n\n\tHonestly, I think when it comes to improving stuff like that, I like including things that I know a lot about and so can easily reference. And I was like, Cher it’s one of my favorite people on the planet. That’s somebody that I know. I can pull out any of her discography. I can talk about her life. I’ve read her autobiography twice — the audiobook is her and Stephanie J. Block that switch back and forth as the narrator because she didn’t want to read the whole thing; it’s iconic. I felt like that was something that I could reference a lot, and I did not realize that Angela knew, I think, nothing about Cher, other than maybe her name.\n\n\tIt elicited a pretty emotional reaction in me immediately, because I was so prepped to get into it and talk about it, and Angela immediately going, “No, pass,” I think it broke something in Vic the performer a little bit.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKatalin Vermes/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow did you approach your “Ponies” character, Cheryl, and did you see similarities between her and Host Vic?\t\n\n\tWhen you really get to live in a different character in a different time, I just am drawn to characters like this. I think that Cheryl is so reliant on specifically, a lot of the men around her, and her tactics to get what she wants is similar to host Vic, but a little bit different. It’s also just a different audience. So I wasn’t feeling too fearful of people being like, That’s Host Vic! \n\t\n\n\tI am very excited for people to get to see Cheryl. I think Cheryl also skews — I’m saying this because I’ve lived with Host Vic for so long, I have a lot of empathy for them as a character — a little bit meaner towards the people around her. I do think that Cheryl is unbelievably capable and has so much to give. And I think in another time would have been rising the ranks as the CEO of something, or been the head of something, and has all of that power; whereas I don’t think Host Vic has that ability. I think Cheryl is hyper competent, but just because of the time and the world that she’s living in, has an inability to rise above her station and is so reliant on the people around her. That’s such a hard position to be in. And I really feel for that situation.\n\t\n\t\tWhat can you tease about where Cheryl ends the season vs. where she starts it?\t\n\n\tThis show is so funny because the way in which it was shot, I know it is a spy thriller, but for me, it was just kind of an intimate family drama. You sometimes have to slowly fall apart to rebuild, that’s my thoughts on Cheryl. Sometimes everything has to unravel in order to start making some yarn for a sweater, and sometimes the sweater is better next time. Sometimes the sweater is a more fun, nice, red sweater. That’s what I want to say.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChris Noth is finally discussing the end of his friendship with Sarah Jessica Parker. The two were co-stars for many years on “Sex and the City” as Mr. Big and Carrie Bradshaw, roles they reprised in the “Sex and the City” movies and the HBO Max follow-up series “And Just Like That.” Noth said on an upcoming episode of “Really Famous With Kara Mayer Robinson” (via People) that Parker’s response to the sexual assault allegations against him effectively ended their personal and professional relationship.\n\t\n\n\t“We’re not friends, I think that’s pretty obvious,” Noth said. “The statement that they put out — which was nothing more than brand management, really — I don’t know, it was sad, it was disappointing, it was surprising. Because you need to call me and hear my side of this. You’ve known me for many years, and we’ve worked [together] for many years.”\n\n\n\tNoth was accused of sexual assault by two women in early December 2021. Three more women came forward with further allegations in the weeks that followed. He was quickly dropped by his management team at A3 Artists Agency and was fired from his series regular role on the CBS procedural “The Equalizer.” A scene he shot as Mr. Big for the “And Just Like That” Season 1 finale was also removed by HBO Max before airing in early 2022. Noth called the accusations “categorically false” in a December 2021 statement, adding, “It’s difficult not to question the timing of these stories coming out. I don’t know for certain why they are surfacing now, but I do know this: I did not assault these women.”\n\t\n\n\tShortly after the initial allegations were made, Parker and her “Sex and the City” co-stars Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis issued a joint statement that read: “We are deeply saddened to hear the allegations against Chris Noth. We support the women who have come forward and shared their painful experiences. We know it must be a very difficult thing to do and we commend them for it.”\n\n\tNoth now told Kara Mayer Robinson: “I get it, that’s more Hollywood than Hollywood. But before you make that statement, you know me, you’ve known me all these years, give me a call so I can give you the real scoop about this. And that didn’t happen, and that was too bad.”\n\n\t“What’s gained is good,” the actor added. “You know where people stand and you know who your real friends are and who they’re not. That’s important to know.  I just know if it had been on the other hand, I wouldn’t have done that… That was hurtful, and it really affected everything.”\n\n\tNoth and Parker’s soured friendship recently made headlines after Noth showed support for an Instagram comment that read “fuck SJP,” referring to Parker’s initials. The actor later clarified he was just making an “off-the-cuff, slightly sarcastic” comment. He spoke on the record to USA Today in 2022 about the allegations for the first time.\n\n\t“There’s nothing I can say to change anyone’s mind when you have that kind of a tidal wave,” Noth said at the time. “It sounds defensive. I’m not. There’s no criminal court. There’s no criminal trial. There’s nothing for me to get on the stand about and get my story out, get witnesses. And there’s even more absurd add-ons that are completely ridiculous, that have absolutely no basis in fact. And I don’t like talking about it because as soon as I do, you’ll get the Daily Mail or someone grabbing a part of it and doing it, and I don’t want my kids seeing that.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter seeing Abby Ellis’ urgent Sundance documentary “The Lake,” on the imminent collapse of Utah’s Great Salt Lake due to water overconsumption and rising temperatures, strolling around Park City, Utah, feels inevitably upsetting. \n\n\tThis January might be an anomaly, but the town’s warmer-than-usual temperatures, combined with grand vistas of mostly snowless hills (which would normally be under a thick white blanket during the Sundance Film Festival), look distressing upon in the context of the climate-change alarm bells Ellis rings throughout her environmental call to action about her home state. As if the drought weren’t concerning enough, our anxieties are compounded by legislators’ inability to address the threat the vanishing lake poses or to provide the immediate attention the issue demands.\n\t\n\n\tThankfully, there are tireless scientists and some lawmakers fighting an uphill battle every day to save Utah’s Great Salt Lake, the largest saltwater lake in the Western Hemisphere. Ellis’ documentary profiles three of them, following their joint work in a vérité style. One is Bonnie Baxter, a biology scientist we meet as she remembers her childhood around the lake during a plane ride over it. It’s an eye-opening journey that puts the emergency of present-day low water levels on display. Then there is the Great Salt Lake Commissioner Brian Steed, appointed to his newly created post by Governor Spencer Cox in 2023 as a political and scientific insider to oversee the efforts. And finally, there is Ben Abbott, a global ecologist whose science and everyday life make up the majority of “The Lake.” \n\t\n\n\tAll three characters bring a different quality and temperament to the economically assembled film (co-edited by Ellis and Emelie Mahdavian of “Bitterbrush”), balancing one another’s dispositions. Baxter’s soft-spoken but unimpeachable authority finds its perfect match in Abbott’s outwardly passionate charisma. Meanwhile, Steed brings a savvy adaptability to the table, despite the fact that his role as a bridge between politics and science sometimes seems at odds with the results the three try to achieve in unison.\n\n\tOne of the most noteworthy aspects of the trio is Abbott’s identity as a Mormon. As devoted to science and religion as he is to his loving family with young, adorable kids, Abbott doesn’t view prayer and scientific facts as mutually exclusive parts of his life, a quality that Ellis soundly portrays. Presenting Abbott as a man of both faith and science sets a refreshing tone, welcoming everyone into the climate change battle and scientific discourse. Elsewhere, Ellis’ care not to mention of divisive political parties achieves a similar inclusivity: The environment is and should be a bipartisan concern.\n\n\tPerhaps the grimmest fact “The Lake” spells out (and this is mentioned more than once) is the lack of any success stories from around the world for similarly scaled wetland disasters. In other words, scientists don’t have a case study to look up to or be inspired by in their quest to reverse the Great Salt Lake’s demise. And that slow death goes like this: With more of the water evaporating from the lake, more toxins that exist on the dry waterbeds get released into the air through worsening dust storms. Consequently, vast communities settled around the lake experience increased rates of cancer, reproductive health issues, respiratory problems and more. Even Baxter faces declining health during the making of the film, a devastating outcome for a selfless public interest fighter. Similarly, people who have lived around the lake for their entire lives now have to make an impossible decision: relocate for the future and health of their kids, or wait it out?\n\n\tExcept, sticking around doesn’t seem like a feasible option when Abbott, Baxter and Steed present a report that predicts the total collapse of the Great Salt Lake in five years. It’s infuriating to see how, after Utah sees historic rainfalls in late 2025, their report is met with skepticism. Their analytical explanations that the rainfall is an anomaly and doesn’t eradicate the long-term problem mostly fall on deaf ears. Similarly, their budgetary asks for necessary structures (like dust monitors to keep the communities safe) are only afforded the bare minimum amount. Along the way, the practical trio try to go a different route, diverting everyone’s attention to the endangered species of the region, like Wilson’s phalarope whose survival depends on the Great Salt Lake’s permanence. But even that winnable leverage doesn’t get them far enough.\n\t\n\n\tRest assured, there are some significant gains and victories in the end, like the money they eventually procure for sufficient dust monitors, along with sizable efforts to improve water flows and protect wetlands. Still, “The Lake” doesn’t end on an unrealistically uplifting note. (In fact, watching the lawmakers’ and federal government’s overarching apathy recalls Adam McKay’s cautionary political comedy “Don’t Look Up,” in which people refuse to acknowledge a comet that is about to destroy the planet.) “The Lake” instead leaves the aftertaste of a truthful note of caution, reminding audiences that when it comes to environmental battles, winning slowly is the same as losing. Science, in this case, requires us to sprint first and do the marathon later, not the other way around. On these grounds alone, “The Lake” is so much more than a regionally isolated issue documentary. Its lessons should apply to every single environmental fight around the world.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNatalie Erika James‘ new film “Saccharine” opens with a shot of a jelly donut getting devoured, and then the footage is spun in reverse, with the bloody-looking goo getting sucked back into the donut. It’s an intentionally disorienting start to James’ new horror film, which is an examination of diet culture.\n\n\t“My aim with the film was to sit the audience within the subjective experience of someone going through disordered eating and a disordered relationship to food,” says writer-director James. “It really swings from that grotesqueness of feeling like it’s too much but not enough, that endless kind of hunger. I wanted to convey that through really visceral shots of food. But it also swings to a glossy, dopamine-fueled space visually as well. Conveying both sides of that was really important.”\n\t\n\n\t“Saccharine,” which is opening on Thursday as part of Sundance’s Midnight section and was acquired by Independent Film Company and Shudder right before the festival, is a horror film that is frightening and provocative in equal measure. The plot concerns a med student named Hana (Midori Francis) who finds out that eating human ash is a shortcut to weight loss. Unfortunately, it also conjures the ghost of the person whose corpse was used for this diet hack.\n\n\n\tJames, whose previous films were the acclaimed 2020 family horror movie “Relic” and the 2024 “Rosemary’s Baby” prequel “Apartment 7A,” says the idea for “Saccharine” came from a personal place.\n\n\t“I grew up with parents who sat on opposite sides of the spectrum in terms of how they relate to their bodies and their relationship to food and eating,” she says. “On one hand, my dad really struggled with food addiction. My mom, almost in response to that, was extremely strict with her diet and very health-conscious. In the midst of that, it feels like meal times are a minefield. I grew up with a lot of warped ideas about body image, as so many of us do. It’s taken a long time to unpack those, and the idea came from that recovery process.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile many artists might not have been able to conceptualize telling Hana’s story through the lens of horror, James says it allows her a malleable canvas for heavy ideas.\n\n\t“I’m drawn to the fear of something dark within ourselves, the shadow self,” she says. “That’s the common thread I’ve found through a lot of my writing. It’s a way to excavate the dark recesses of your heart, or the fears and anxieties that live there. There’s such a freedom in the way you can use horror. It’s very freeing to use surreal imagery and externalize what’s internal through horror.”\n\n\tThe lush look of “Saccharine,” which James visualized alongside cinematographer Charlie Sarroff, drew upon unexpected sources.\n\n\t“We had both ‘candy’ and ‘grime’ as thematic,” she says. “Those pops of color, that slightly neo-noir wash of neons and slightly-stylized lighting, but also keeping the real darkness and grittiness as well. We were even drawing on older Wong Kar-wai films — just for inspiration, obviously not completely imitating them — but going for palettes that paint Hana’s inner world.”\n\n\tUltimately, James hopes that, along with delivering scares, “Saccharine” sparks thought and discussion about society’s complex relationship with food and weight.\n\n\t“The most worthwhile thing in making a film is to hopefully convey an experience that makes people feel seen, see a part of themselves on screen, and make them feel less alone,” she says. “I’m sure there’ll be a lot of discussion about, particularly at the moment, the glamorization of the uber-thinness being glamorized. It’s an important discussion to have, and just how much our diet culture and weight stigma permeates every facet of our culture. That’s the real problem and needs to change.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBela Bajaria was already on her second cup of coffee when Danielle Brooks and Lewis Pullman started reading out the list of this year’s Oscar nominees at 5:30 in the morning. By the time they had finished with all 24 categories, Netflix had racked up 18 nominations, tying with Neon for the second-most among distributors. \n\n\t“Frankenstein,” Guillermo del Toro’s long-gestating passion project, scored nine nods, while “Train Dreams,” a lyrical period piece that Netflix acquired at Sundance, nabbed four nominations. Both films were nominated for best picture. The company also scored a best animated feature nomination and best original song nomination for “Kpop Demon Hunters,” its streaming smash about, well, the title says it all.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m watching the nominations as a fan and supporter of these filmmakers,” said Bajaria, who serves as Netflix’s chief content officer. “So I’m texting and emailing all of them as it happens with lots of celebratory emojis and woo-hoos. Then later I follow up with phone calls.”\n\n\n\tOn paper, neither “Frankenstein” nor “Train Dreams” seem like slam-dunk Oscar contenders. Del Toro is a previous Academy Award winner for “The Shape of Water,” but voters don’t always embrace horror, and “Train Dreams” is a low-budget indie about grief and loneliness that could have struggled to get recognized among the crush of higher-profile contenders. \n\n\t“This story has lived with Guillermo for 50 years,” Bajaria says. “[‘Frankenstein’] is really exploring what it means to be a monster and what it means to be human, and examining father and son relationships. There’s so much about those characters that connected with people…’Train Dreams’ obviously looks breathtaking. But [director] Clint Bentley and [co-writer] Greg Kwedar are also telling a story of family and memories and love.”\n\t\n\n\tThough the top prize continues to elude the streamer, it marks the eighth year in a row that Netflix has fielded a best picture contender and the fourth time it’s had more than one film nominated in the category. Bajaria was also happy to see other Netflix features, such as the documentary, “The Perfect Neighbor,” score nods. She argues there are lessons from “Kpop Demon Hunter’s” outsized success with Oscar voters and subscribers. \n\n\t“‘Kpop Demon Hunters’ came from such a culturally specific, really personal place,” she said. “And the songs have a lot of fandom of all different ages. We’re a global service, but we always have to start with stories that come from a very authentic place. And that goes back to having a voice and a vision.”\n\n\tThough Netflix earned an impressive number of nominations, it was outplayed by Warner Bros., which tied its own record with 30 nods. The studio dominated the morning, earning 16 nominations for “Sinners” and 13 nominations for “One Battle After Another.” Netflix has a deal in place to buy Warner Bros. for $83 billion, and if the pact is approved by regulators, the streamer has said it plans to operate the studio as an independent distributor. On Thursday, Bajaria praised the studio chiefs Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy for their strong showing and said she expects the deal to inspire friendly inter-office competition.\n\n\t“Mike and Pam had such a great year, and they’ve obviously been working with some great filmmakers too,” Bajaria said. “What’s fun about it is once this deal closes, both of us will have very strong slates, and continue to not only push each other, but also support each other. It’s going to be exciting.”\n\n\t“There’s going to be some healthy competition,” she added. “That’s good for consumers, it’s good for filmmakers and it’s good for everybody.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBob Iger, in his second-to-last year leading Disney as CEO, saw his total compensation increase 11.5%, to a total of $45.8 million in 2025.\n\n\tDisney disclosed Iger’s pay package in its proxy statement filed Thursday with the SEC.\n\n\tIger’s base salary for 2025 was unchanged at $1 million. He also received Disney stock awards worth $21 million, $14 million in stock options, a $7.25 million cash bonus and $2.59 million in other compensation (including $1.85 million for security and $568,670 for personal air travel).\n\t\n\n\tIger’s contract with Disney is set to expire at the end of 2026 — and the Mouse House’s board is expected to announce a CEO successor to Iger as soon as next month. The leading candidates, per Wall Street analysts tracking the situation, are Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Experiences, who oversees the company’s parks, cruises and consumer products, and Dana Walden, co-chairman of Disney Entertainment.\n\n\n\t“The appointment of the next CEO will be determined by the full Board, and we currently expect to announce the appointment of the Company’s next CEO in early 2026,” Disney chairman James Gorman said in the proxy statement. The company did not identify who’s on the shortlist, of course, but said, “Each internal candidate is going through a rigorous preparation process, including mentorship from Mr. Iger, external coaching and engagement with all Directors.”\n\n\tIger, after serving as CEO of Disney for 15 years, previously retired at the end of 2021 and was replaced by then-CEO Bob Chapek. But in November 2022, the board ousted Chapek and brought Iger back as chief exec.\n\t\n\n\tDisney also announced in the proxy filing that the 2026 annual shareholders meeting will be held virtually (at virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DIS2026) on March 18, starting at 10 a.m. PT.\n\n\tIger is up for reelection to Disney’s board at the 2026 meeting for a one-year term.\n\n\tIn discussing his qualifications as CEO and for the board, Disney noted that Iger “has an unmatched knowledge of the Company and the creative content it produces, and an in-depth understanding of fostering innovation through technology and connecting to audiences in our markets around the world.”\n\n\t“Throughout Mr. Iger’s tenure at Disney, he has successfully expanded the Company’s geographic presence, identified new revenue streams and initiated the Company’s DTC efforts, expanding the scale and global reach of Disney’s storytelling and streaming services,” Disney said. “Mr. Iger has also furthered Disney’s rich history of storytelling through the successful landmark acquisitions and integration of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Comedy is my day job,” says Eddie Izzard. “Shakespeare started with his comedies, then he moved to his dramas and tragedies, and that’s what I’m doing.”\n\n\tEven the Bard might have to step back marvel at the malleability of Izzard on their current global tour, though, as Izzard moves not just from comedy into the realm of Elizabethan drama, but shifts through 23 different characters, in a one-person production of “Hamlet.” With a couple hundred shows already under their belt on the tour, they’re bringing the show to L.A.’s Ricardo Montalbán Theatre for seven performances, starting with a preview Thursday night and official opening Friday, running at the Hollywood venue through Jan. 31. (Tickets are available here.)\n\t\n\n\tIs it madness — doing what many consider the greatest ensemble drama of all time as a solo show — or is there method in it? No one will accuse Izzard of not having done their homework on every aspect of the historical backdrop of the show, as well as having done the difficult work of imagining the blocking and voicing that will help an audience keep all those characters straight. Izzard had some experience with a one-person production, first having done it with an adaptation of “Great Expectations” that similarly traveled around the world. Now, there’s no definite end in sight for Izzard’s “Hamlet,” with the actor having too good a time to not keep adding cities to the run. Reviews and accolades in prior engagements have been enthusiastic, including nominations from the New York Outer Critics Circle and the New York Drama League for a run back east.\n\t\n\n\tPrior to coming to L.A., the Tony-nominated, Emmy-winning performer (who is billed as just Eddie Izzard for this appearance but also goes by the name Suzy Eddie Izzard) Zoomed with Variety to talk about both the practical and theoretical underpinnings of this challenging achievement. (The following Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\n\tDo you have a count of how many times you’ve done this “Hamlet” now?\n\n\tIt’s 205 now. It is soaring on, and it’s about 50,000 tickets sold. Some people are going, “Oh, this is most unusual.” It’s not that unusual. A lot of people are doing solo shows all around the world. I like the idea of taking Shakespeare around the world — we’re  negotiating taking it to India, and Australia is this year as well, and the third leg of the tour of America. I just think it is a wonderful thing to do. I hope that Shakespeare would approve.\n\n\tAs you say, one-person shows are not totally uncommon, but the sheer amount of characters you play seems like it might be more taxing on you than perhaps someone who’s doing a monologue-type show. Is there any weariness that sets in when you’re doing two hours a night of all those characters?\n\n\tIt is a tough show. But when you mention people doing monologues, I mean, these are full shows that other people are doing, playing multiple characters, so I am really in the same bracket as them. So it’s as taxing as for them as it is for me. You have to be totally on top of it because it’s yourself out there for two hours. But it does mean that people can concentrate more on the text rather than saying, “Who’s wearing what costume?” You can really focus in on the story and the text and the wonderful poetry of Shakespeare. So I think that’s something which is unusual and gives it an interesting focus in that way. So I’ve been looking forward to getting back out there. That’s the odd thing. Because maybe now you’d be thinking, “Do you wanna keep doing this thing?” Yeah, I do. Every night is press night — that’s how I feel. It is tiring. If you got ill and did it, then I think it’d be really tricky. But I’m loving doing it, so I just wanna continue.\n\n\tYou said you wanted to pay special attention to the female characters.\n\n\tAbsolutely. I just want to, a trans person, give honor to all characters. You know, trans is getting such a buffeting at this time. But on a positive side, when I came out 40 years ago, January ‘85, no one was talking to us at all. We were just non-people. So even though there’s buffeting, even though there’s loud voices raised, left, right, and center, trans people exist. We’re not going anywhere, so it’s good to be out there. And people get obsessed about male/female. But most people who are thinking people see everyone somewhere on a spectrum. So to get out there and play classically male characters, classically female characters, it’s an intriguing thing to do. And as a trans person, as someone who’s gender-fluid, I don’t see much difference in my own personality, between a male version of me or a female version of me. It’s just me. It’s slightly more of a presentation to people or how people see me. But, yeah, to be the best version of Ophelia that I can be, the best version of Gertrude that I can be, is a wonderful challenge. So I go for it.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s funny that there’s so much Hamlet in the air now, in popular culture. Taylor Swift, named her single “The Fate of Ophelia,” which got young people looking the character up. Of course there’s the “Hamnet” movie now, which ends with a version of “Hamlet” that has been condensed into about 10 minutes. L.A. just had a very experimental adaptation of “Hamlet” at the Mark Taper Forum where the play was condensed into one hour, and then the second hour was a sort of modern-day sequel. In all, it’s a play that comes back and resonates for people, and it’s maybe just coincidental that there’d be some of that in the air at the time you have chosen to do this.\n\n\tIt is odd. I keep noticing it. I’m thinking, does this help me or hinder me? I think it helps. If there’s more “Hamlet” out and people saying, “Let us revisit, let us look at this,” and people coming from completely different directions on it, I think that’s kind of wonderful. And it has lasted for so long. “Hamlet’s” in the ether at the moment, so I’ll just keep riding that wave.\n\n\tWhat was most attractive to you about doing this? Was actually doing all those Hamlet soliloquies kind of the main attraction, or was it more about performing the 23 roles in one fell swoop?\n\n\tWell, it’s more actually just doing Shakespeare. It didn’t have to be “Hamlet.” I was a severely, atypically dyslexic kid, so I had great difficulty just reading off the page. But I was someone who was, from the age of 7, saying, “I really want to act,” trying to get into school plays desperately. Even with standard, modern-day text, I found that tricky, getting it from the page through my brain and out of my mouth. So I was always intimidated by Elizabethan verse and by Shakespeare. As time went on, I decided to concentrate on comedy. Then I started pushing into my dramas and going through Broadway and onto the dramatic films. But I really wanted to do Shakespeare. I wanted to really challenge myself. I considered “Richard III” and considered others where I could start. It was a fact that, because my career has been so unusual, I was not on top of everyone’s list (for Shakespearian productions). And I’m trans as well, so I’m just such an unusual person, putting everything together — I don’t think people say, “We’ve gotta build (a show) around this person.” It’s a very high bar. No one was that keen on putting me forward to do it.\n\t\n\n\tSo I just thought, “Well, I’ll do this myself.” When “Great Expectations” took off and worked so well, it came from something that I was already doing, performing against myself, something I had been doing in my comedy. I realized it could work for drama as well as it could work for comedy. I just decided, “Let’s do ‘Hamlet.’” And I could do that without getting permission from other people or making sure that they were setting the budgets for that. I wanted to do Shakespeare and I wanted to go towards this thing that had scared me as a teenager.\n\n\tAs you say, going back and forth between different characters is something that you have done as part of your comedy, so that didn’t feel like a totally unfamiliar thing. You had to figure out how people will understand that you’re shifting personas here.\n\n\tIn the first five, 10 minutes, some people do go — well, maybe most people go — “What are you doing here?” I haven’t watched everyone else’s solo shows, but sometimes they’re using screens, they’re using recorded videos. They’re talking to themselves as other characters on screens or videos or however they’re doing it. I’m playing it where I’m flipping and changing physicality, changing a voice. Not overtly, not in a caricatured way, but in a subtle way. And gradually, I feel the audience will pick up on who the character I’m playing is. And there are guides to that. And maybe we mention people’s names more often. You drop in a “Yes, Horatio.” …\n\n\tBasically you’re obeying Shakespeare’s script, however you’ve adapted it. But the bottom line is to be truthful in all your performances and all the arcs of the characters that you’re driving them through, and hopefully the audience can grab it. I’m sure some people are going, “I cannot get this. How this works is unusual to me.” It’s not for them. But, you know, we’re up to 50,000 tickets now, so people are coming back a second or third time, so I know it works. And I also have had so much experience, not just on stage — I spent four years as street performer. And if you think of Shakespeare’s actors, their training must have been pretty similar to that training, because they were not going to drama school. Just one generation before “Hamlet” was written, they were performing at festivals and fairs and market days, and then the Curtain Theater was built in the late 1570s, and this is only 1600, so it’s so close. At the Globe Theater in London, keeping everyone focused and interested was a tricky thing to do. My training has been through all that, so I know I can do something on stage which is a little unusual for most actors, and I bring all those skills to bear in every performance.\n\t\n\n\tAnd, yeah, no screens, and it works, but they have to tune into what I’m doing. I’ve worked very hard with my movement director, Didi Hopkins, who’s steeped in commedia dell’arte, to make these transitions between characters so that people can feel there is a sharp difference between them, as opposed to a confusing difference between them. I’m crisp on the architecture. If I move one character to another character, when I move back to that first character, they will not be somewhere else on the stage, they will be back where you left them. And that’s something I’ve been very dogmatic on. That must happen so that if Gertrude wanders across the stage, talking about the fact that her previous husband has died and then they pass through to eternity, Hamlet will be in the same place when you flip around.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEddie Izzard in “Hamlet”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCarol Rosegg\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDo you have a favorite character to play apart from Hamlet?\n\n\tOphelia is wonderful to play — the twin soul of Hamlet, some people say. The women are underwritten; Gertrude is underwritten. So as a trans person, I’m very keen to land those characters, separate ’em, and land them as well as I can, because I just feel they’re underwritten by Shakespeare. Claudius is someone who has a great [sweep in his arc and eventually is confessing to the audience, or to God, that he did it. it’s just an interesting thing to track him, trying to play him as magnanimous as possible. And Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, I play as hand puppets, and that is an unusual thing to do. Hamlet, I feel, is really pleased but confused to see them at the beginning, and he’s gradually unraveling the lies behind what they’re there for.\n\n\tIt’s interesting that conscience seems to be the main thing that I feel that underpins the whole thing. He has to be happy with his conscience, Hamlet, as he drives through. I grew up thinking: How did people look at religion years ago, say, back in the 1590s, when this was written or back in the 1000s, when it takes place. They’re all saying that conscience is the thing that you should be judging things on, so if you’re good with that… He’s talking about these Catholic ideas, even though he is in a new Protestant country. In the Elizabethan country, purgatory should not be happening in the lexicon, but he’s talking about the old days, so he can get away with it. And I think he probably was a secret Catholic. But Hamlet (believes he) can get to heaven because he’s had these people killed, but they were trying to kill him, so that’s fair, and he can argue at the pearly gates, or wherever it is you had to argue in those days. But they were thinking of it just like us: At the beginning of the play, they’re saying there aren’t any ghosts. Then, oh my God, there are ghosts! That’s how we are right now. It feels quite modern, how it is. … The audience watching must have been half of them Catholic, half of them not Catholic, some of them lip-service Protestants — a complete spread. It’s almost “Game of Thrones” when they talk about the old gods and the new. This was really a time of the old gods and the new, even though it was one God. It was all the old ideas and the new ideas. The amount of bloodletting that happened between the Catholics and the Protestants over the idea of how you should interpret the scriptures tragic. But all this rolls into a play where conscience is king.\n\t\n\n\tThe way I feel it, it could well be is that Hamlet’s personality personality is quite close to Shakespeare’s. Shakespeare’s a kid who didn’t go to university, who had this chip on his shoulder trying to work his way to the upstart crowd, trying to get his way through. When he dies, there isn’t a great triumphal parade. He isn’t taken as the great person. He doesn’t get all his plays published, which is really odd, in the first folio…\n\n\tSo in the end you have to serve that story, serve that play, and make it work for the for the public. And we’re very keen on that so that kids from 9 to 90 can come in and enjoy the beauty of the poetry, and see a storyline that isn’t so confusing. Because it is quite confusing, at times — what he does with going to England and then not going to England. ..The fact that number of things in the play happen off-stage… The whole pirate fight is off stage. The sort of semi-rape of Ophelia, that is a reported story. An unusual way to do a play. But he did it, and so we interpreted it as we see it.\n\n\tThere are so many different ways to play Hamlet, but it sounds like you are very sympathetic to the character at least.\n\n\tI feel very happy playing Hamlet. I have lived a life that has been through so many different phases and challenges that I felt very happy to take on his challenge. But the procrastination of him, I found fascinating, and the self-questioning. You say, “Well, what am I doing? I’m not bloody doing anything,” and he isn’t. He just isn’t getting it done. Then he kills Polonious, and what he does to Ophelia is disgusting; it is overtly horrific. … And regime changes happen. So playing him as mad, okay. It’s a trope that had happened before many times, and we see that down the ages. But then to take it out on Ophelia, and then when she’s died, to be at the funeral saying, “I loved her 40,000 times more than you.” Well, we weren’t seeing any of that, mate, because you weren’t doing that! So to track a human being through Hamlet is really a tough thing to do. You hope you can bring the audience with you on that character. He’s the trickiest to land.\n\n\tBut Ophelia dying, she has this song to sing, as she is going, as she is coming apart at the seams, and playing that is very affecting. The way we’ve chosen to do it is, she doesn’t really get going into the song, but she does sing as beautifully as she can, as beautifully as I can sing, with a control to her voice. But it is more like a broken record that she’s playing. So each night I do delight in all the characters. … Gertrude — didn’t she sense that something was weird, that he suddenly died. Were a lot of serpents biting people in those days. I don’t know, in Denmark, it seemed rather cold. Were there lots of snakes around? There’s so many questions in it. It’s so tricky and you can take it so many different ways. So you make your choices and you dive in and go for it.\n\t\n\n\tThere is a thing that any actor could feel if, going into it multiple times — you know, 10, 50 performances, a hundred, 150, and I’m over 200 now — that you could lose the joy, lose the passion of it. But it’s not happening and I’m happy to keep bringing it around the world.\n\n\tIs there anything you think might feel different in how you bring it to L.A.?\n\n\tNot necessarily, because I tend to try and pull the audience to me, as opposed to saying, “You are a Los Angeles audience. So I better be aware of that.” I would not have been that way whether I’m playing Los Angeles or I’m playing Sydney Opera House, as we’re doing next year, or Oakland or London or Manchester or France. I will pull that audience to my performance. I feel that’s the way every actor should do that.\n\n\tBut I’m looking forward to the Montalbon. I was last there, I think, with Robin Williams, performing with him at a benefit performance. It’s nice to be back there. And Ricardo Montalban’s a very interesting guy. I was just watching an episode of “Columbo” with him, a really fine performance. Ricardo Montalban is probably been known for “The Wrath of Khan.” But I could just see he must have had big status back in Mexico and then was someone who was breaking through in Los Angeles at whatever level he could, even though, at the time, probably they weren’t gonna build an entire film around him. Anyway, there’s such a history in that building. I will try and pull Los Angeles to me, as opposed to tailoring it to anyone, and say, “Come and see where my imagination has taken this, and our work has taken this.”\n\n\tYou’ve developed a great Shakespearian scholarship, it seems.\n\n\tIf you know anything about my standup, you know I’m a history savant. I inhale history, because I do feel the repetitions of human beings. Our brain pan size has been the same for a hundred thousand years or more. So the brightest, most interesting humans on the planet have had this ability to look at the world, to study, to articulate, in many fine ways down the centuries. And so to reach back into what this guy, William Shakespeare, was doing… Was he gay? Was he Catholic? Was he lying about things in his life? He didn’t go to university. He must have been pissed off about that. And going from his comedies to his tragedies, that journey, which I’m now just following in his footsteps, I find that fascinating. And so to be going through, traveling through his mind, and out into the audience…\n\t\n\n\tAnd particularly having this thing of the four years I worked on the street, that put me in such an unusual place, which I’m very happy to get where I can do the soliloquies to the audience. If you watch online, you can see Richard Burton in his famous “Hamlet,” where he seems to be performing at his soliloquies at the audience, rather than to them. But I think it is necessary to do these where you really are talking to them. I see them as the Greek chorus of Hamlet’s mind, and that’s how I talk to the audience: they’re on my side. They’re my gang. So that’s how I will do these soliloquies to them.\n",

    "body": "\n                    \n                          Lily Allen & David Harbour\n                          Score $7 Million For NYC Townhouse\n                      \n              \n    \n          David Harbour and Lily Allen are officially closing the door on their Brooklyn chapter ... 'cause TMZ has learned the estranged couple has found a buyer for their NYC townhouse following their very public -- and very ugly -- breakup.\n      \n    \n          Sources with knowledge of the sale tell TMZ ... the former couple closed on the property for $7 million, after it went into contract earlier this week. The home was originally listed for $8 million back in October, before the price was slashed to $7.3 million in January, and now, it's finally off their hands.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The place isn't just any brownstone. The late 19th century 5-bedroom, 4-bath Carroll Gardens townhouse sits on one of the most sought-after blocks in the neighborhood. The 4-level home was purchased by the couple in 2021 for $3.35 million, then completely reimagined with AD100 designer Billy Cotton and architect Ben Bischoff of MADE.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          But the timing of the sale is impossible to ignore. Harbour and Allen's breakup has been extremely messy, and Lily's new album, \"West End Girl,\" appears to pull zero punches. The title track is reportedly all about this very townhouse, turning their one-time dream home into a symbol of everything that went wrong.\n      \n\n          In the album, the \"Smile\" singer makes a series of explosive allegations, including claims Harbour lied about wanting an open marriage so he could cheat, and that his alleged infidelity nearly cost her her sobriety. On the track \"Relapse,\" she sings ... \"The ground is gone beneath me / You pulled the safety net / I moved across an ocean from my family, from my friends / The foundation is shattered / You’ve made such a f***ing mess.\"\n      \n    \n          Lily also opened up about a gut-wrenching moment she says sealed the end ... dropping off Harbour's belongings at what she believed was merely a workspace, only to allegedly discover signs he'd been cheating.\n      \n    \n          Now, with the townhouse sold and the album out in the world, it looks like both are finally making a clean break ... at least in real estate terms.\n      \n    \n          Carl Gambino of the Gambino Group at Compass held the listing ... he couldn't be reached for comment.\n      \n      ",

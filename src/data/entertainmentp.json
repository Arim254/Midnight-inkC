    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tDiane Ladd — the three-time Oscar-nominated character actress beloved for roles in “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” “Wild at Heart” and HBO’s “Enlightened” died yesterday at 89. In the wake of her passing, she and daughter Laura Dern‘s 2023 joint memoir, “Honey, Baby, Mine: A Mother and Daughter Talk Life, Death, Love,” takes on a newly poignant resonance as both a Hollywood history lesson and a final conversation between mother and child.\n\n\n\tThe book is available on paper and hardback, Kindle and an audiobook version on Audible narrated by Dern and Ladd.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe book was born out of Ladd’s diagnosis with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in 2018, during which she was given months to live and was her ultimate cause of death.  Dern urged her mother to walk for her lung health, and during those daily strolls, they recorded 14 sprawling conversations about love, ambition, parenting, regret, fame, faith and survival. \n\n\tAcross chapters, Ladd revisits her Mississippi childhood and early auditions, the car crash that killed her first daughter, the sexism and pay inequities of mid-century Hollywood and the unconventional career rebuild that led to her late-in-life acclaim. Dern, meanwhile, opens up about growing up on sets, navigating fame as a second-generation actor and the emotional cost of being raised by two working parents in the public eye.\n\n\tThe memoir is laced with the pair’s banter but it doesn’t shy away from harder truths. At one point, Dern admits she’s avoided asking certain questions for fear of hurting her mother. Ladd responds, “Of course it hurts. That’s how you know it matters.” \n\n\n\tNow, with Ladd’s death, Honey, Baby, Mine reads less like a celebrity memoir and more like a keepsake. Order a copy online here. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters” hit 14 million views during the week of Oct. 27-Nov. 2, becoming the second-most-watched movie of the week on Netflix. This is the animated musical’s 20th week on the chart so far —  it continues to break its own record, as the longest-charting title was previously “Red Notice” with 14 weeks — and marks its return to the No. 2 position. “KPop Demon Hunters” spent its first 17 weeks in either first or second place on the chart before slipping to third place during the weeks of Oct. 13 and Oct. 20, but that didn’t last long.\n\t\n\n\tIn terms of views, the week of Oct. 27 was actually slightly slower than the week before, during which the film hit 14.7 million views. Still, no other Netflix film since the June premiere of “KPop Demon Hunters” has matched that level of staying power, so other titles continue to slip behind it. It’s also likely that Halloween brought new and repeat viewers to the film, as the fictional girl group Hunter/x was a popular costume for both children and adults this year.\n\n\n\tMore to come…\n",

    "body": "\n\tMichiel Huisman is the latest addition to the cast of “Mayfair Witches” Season 3 at AMC, Variety has learned exclusively. \n\n\tHuisman joins fellow recently announced cast member Betsy Brandt as well as returning star Alexandra Daddario and Harry Hamlin, Tongayi Chirisa and Alyssa Jirrels. \n\n\tHuisman will play Michael. According to sources, the character is described as a carpenter who built an inn that he runs himself. Though he hides a dark secret, his carefully constructed life begins to crumble when he falls in love with Rowan Mayfair (Daddario).\n\t\n\n\tHuisman is best known for playing Dario Naharis in the megahit HBO series “Game of Thrones,” appearing on the show across three seasons. His recent TV roles include “Echo 3,” “Angela Black,” “The Flight Attendant,” and “The Haunting of Hill House,” while he will also appear in the upcoming Kurt Sutter Netflix series “The Abandons.” His film credits include both “Rebel Moon” movies at Netflix as well as “The Other Lamb,” “The Last Right,” and “The Age of Adaline.” \n\n\n\tHe is repped by UTA, Authentic Talent and Literary Management, Conway van Gelder Grant, Peikoff/Mahan, and Relevant.\n\n\t“Mayfair Witches” was renewed for a third season during AMC’s upfront presentation to advertisers back in April. Production is now underway in Vancouver. Per the official description, “The series’ third season will dive deeper into the mythology of witchcraft, introduce new ‘spellbound’ families and feature some of the historical happenings of Salem, MA, the infamous town of witch trials and folklore.”\n\n\tSeason 3 is executive produced by Mark Johnson, who oversees the Anne Rice Immortal Universe for AMC Networks. Co-showrunners Esta Spalding and Thomas Schnauz executive produce along with Michelle Ashford and Tom Williams.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSouth by Southwest will host more than 250 sessions for the festival’s 40th anniversary.\n\n\tThe next edition of the technology and arts festival — slated for March 12 to March 18, 2026, in Austin, Texas — will cover topics like AI, the creator economy, psychology of marketing, future of scent branding, DNA and the dark genome, how world peace is global health and designing for societal shifts.\n\n\n\t“This year, one theme stuck out above the rest: humans,” Greg Rosenbaum, SXSW’s SVP of programming, said in a statement. “Across all of our tracks — Tech & AI, Cities & Climate, Creator Economy, Culture, Design, and more — session submissions asked the fundamental question, ‘how does this impact humans and humanity?’”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “From these submissions, our programming team curated a broad collection of sessions to answer that question and many more. Whether it’s your first or your 40th time at SXSW, you don’t want to miss out.”  \n\n\n\tThe topics for the sessions were selected from SXSW’s PanelPicker submissions, a community-led platform that allowed festivalgoers to select what sessions are programmed at the conferences. Topics on AI dominated as the most popular submission with branding and marketing, healthcare innovations and mental wellness trailing behind. \n\n\tFrom the most popular topics in this year’s PanelPicker submissions, a few of the sessions include:\n\n\nTech & AI: How We Could Lose Control: Avoiding the Paths to Runaway AI: Physicist Anthony Aguirre and tech ethicist Tristan Harris share how opaque incentives, design flaws, systemic misalignment and power concentration could sideline humanity by its own creation, exploring concrete ways to prevent this outcome.\nBrand & Marketing: The Anime Advantage: Brand Strategy Meets Cultural Power: Darren Traub and Elizabeth Cohen from Crunchyroll, Robin Tilotta from Twitch and Uzma Rawn Dowler from Major League Baseball (MLB) will explore how talent, brands and creators are using anime as a narrative and business engine to build immersive worlds and drive long-term brand equity in pop culture. \nCreator Economy: An Influential Conversation with Jordan “The Stallion” Howlett: CCO Chris Detert and Jordan “The Stallion” Howlett discuss community building and navigating brand deals, audience engagement and online growth. \nHealth: The AI-Powered Bionic Revolution Has Already Begun: Bionic limb pioneer Aadeel Akhtar reveals how shared breakthroughs are transforming assistive technology into accessible, intelligent extensions of the body. \n\n\n\n\tAdditional keynote speakers, featured sessions and PanelPicker sessions will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n\tPenske Media Corporation, Variety’s parent company, is a shareholder of SXSW.\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tCritics and TV journalists are eviscerating Ryan Murphy’s “All’s Fair,” starring Kim Kardashian, calling the new legal drama “existentially terrible,” “tacky” and a “disaster zone.” \n\n\tThe series, whose first three episodes are now available on Hulu and Disney+, follows a team of female divorce attorneys who open their own practice in L.A. “Fierce, brilliant, and emotionally complicated, they navigate high-stakes breakups, scandalous secrets, and shifting allegiances — both in the courtroom and within their own ranks. In a world where money talks and love is a battleground, these women don’t just play the game—they change it,” a synopsis reads. \n\t\n\n\tIn addition to Kardashian, the 10-episode series stars Naomi Watts, Niecy Nash-Betts, Teyana Taylor, Sarah Paulson and Glenn Close. \n\n\n\tIn The Times’ zero-star review of the series, headlined “All’s Fair review: this may be the worst TV drama ever,” deputy TV editor Ben Dowell wrote: “Well done, Kim. You must have quite a healthy ego yourself to star in what may well be the worst television drama ever made. Because ‘All’s Fair’ (Disney+) is so bad, it’s not even enjoyably so. It thinks it’s a feminist fable about spirited lawyers getting their own back on cruel rich men but is in fact a tacky and revolting monument to the same greed, vanity and avarice it supposedly targets. All scripted, it feels, by a toddler who couldn’t write ‘bum’ on a wall.”\n\n\tGuardian TV critic Lucy Mangan also gave the series a zero-star rating, writing in her review, “I did not know it was still possible to make television this bad. I assumed that there was some sort of baseline, some inescapable bedrock knowledge of how to do it that now prevents any entry into the art form from falling below a certain standard. But I was wrong. The new series from Ryan Murphy, ‘All’s Fair’ – starring Kim Kardashian, Naomi Watts and Niecy Nash as the founders of an all-female law firm delivering divorce-y justice to incredibly rich but slightly unlucky women under the azure skies of California – is terrible. Fascinatingly, incomprehensibly, existentially terrible.” \n\t\n\n\tMost reviews panned the performances — particularly Kardashian’s as divorce attorney Allura Grant — with The Telegraph’s Ed Power writing, “Amid this disaster zone of soapy plotting and reeking dialogue, it is perhaps unfair to single out Kardashian. Her participation is just one disaster among many (she is an executive producer alongside her mother and manager, Kris Jenner). Yet there is no glossing over her stilted acting, already confirmed by her guest appearance in season 12 of Murphy’s ‘American Horror Story.’ Even more striking than her lack of thespian chops, however, is her complete absence of screen presence. She has no aura, no unfiltered charisma. Forget an X factor, Kardashian has a Zzzzzz… quality that threatens to lull the unprepared viewer into a stupor whenever she opens her mouth.”\n\n\tDowell, meanwhile, said of Kardashian: “Does Kardashian (who plans to take bar exams, we are told) make a convincing lawyer? No, she does not. She is to acting what Genghis Khan is to a peaceful liberal democracy, though of course the dialogue — a tsunami of clunking cliché that drowns this whole enterprise in the first five minutes — doesn’t help her cause.” \n\n\t“All’s Fair” marks Kardashian’s second collaboration with Murphy after starring in the 12th season of “American Horror Story,” subtitled “Delicate.” The reality TV star also serves as an executive producer on the legal drama alongside Murphy. \n\n\tGlamour editor Emily Maddick compared “All’s Fair” to watching an episode of “The Kardashians,” writing in her review, “And after sitting through the first episode of ‘All’s Fair,’ if ‘aspirational’ is what they’re aiming for, then god help us all. For it seems that Ryan Murphy, arguably one of the hottest names in TV, with countless brilliant and diverse, award-winning shows under his belt, including ‘Glee,’ ‘American Horror Story,’ ‘Pose,’ ‘Scream Queens’ and ‘Nip Tuck,’ has been fully Kardashian-ified. He’s drunk the Kris Jenner Kool Aid and the Murphy cinematic universe has been infected by this so-called ‘aspirational’ lifestyle the Kardashians dictate we should all be conforming to aspire to; which, in other words, translates as ‘behaving like a billionaire.’”\n\n\tNew episodes of “All’s Fair” will stream every Tuesday on Hulu and Disney+.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOne of my first assignments when I started working in entertainment journalism at the now-defunct movie magazine Premiere was to interview Nathan Lane for “The Birdcage.”\n\n\tIt was for a section in the magazine called “In the Works,” where we published a first-look image from a film with a 300-word article.\n\n\tAn English-language adaptation of the 1978 French comedy “La Cage Aux Folles,” “The Birdcage” stars Lane as Albert, a professional drag queen whose partner Armand is played by Robin Williams. Albert is asked to leave their house for a night when their son (Dan Futterman) comes home and plans a family dinner for his fiancé (Calista Flockhart) and her right-wing politician dad (Gene Hackman) and mom (Diane Wiest). All hell breaks loose when Albert shows up masquerading as Armand’s wife in full conservative middle-aged woman drag.\n\t\n\n\tThis was 1996. The Mike Nichols-directed movie was a watershed moment for gay representation on film. It was a mainstream movie made by a major studio. At the time, heterosexual Williams was called “brave” and “courageous” for playing a gay role. Lane, on the other hand, wasn’t an out gay actor back then. I was told by publicists before my phone interview with Lane that I could not ask him anything about his personal life.\n\n\tIn other words, there would be no questions about him being a gay man playing a gay man.\n\n\tLane came out publicly three years later, inspired to tell his truth following the brutal murder of Matthew Shepard.\n\n\tA lot has changed in the 30 years since my no-personal-questions interview with Lane.\n\t\n\n\tLGBTQ representation in Hollywood in front of and behind the camera has increased and progressed in ways I never could have imagined three decades ago: From Ellen DeGeneres, “Will & Grace” and “The L Word” to Anderson Cooper and Robin Roberts; from “Philadelphia” and “Brokeback Mountain” to “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and “All of Us Strangers.” In 2025, we’ve had “The History of Sound,” “The Wedding Banquet” remake, “Pillion” and “Boots.” The list can go on and on.\n\n\tAnd now, just last night, People magazine crowned Jonathan Bailey as this year’s “Sexiest Man Alive.”\n\n\tThe title is a frivolous one. It’s an achievement based on one’s physical appearance. Sure, Bailey is, as Ariana Grande said in a video congratulating her “Wicked” co-star, “the kindest and the most brilliant and beautiful inside as well,” but let’s face it, he would not be on the cover of People this week if he didn’t have movie-star looks. His many thirst trap photo shoots over the last few years certifying his status as an “internet boyfriend” only helped seal the sexiest deal.\n\n\tBut what’s most significant in this year’s pick is the milestone that Bailey is the first openly gay man to be chosen by People for its legacy franchise. One cover features Bailey submerged in water with just his smizing face and glistening wet hair and skin captured by the photographer. Another cover features him shirtless and holding his dog. Inside the magazine, he lays on the beach, his chiseled six-pack on full display. Gay-coded photos include Bailey in a spandex singlet and another one of him licking an ice pop.\n\n\tBut let’s forget about the physical looks for a moment and understand what it really means to have Bailey as the Sexiest Man Alive. Oh, how I would have loved to have an actor like Bailey to look up to when I was kid. To be a young person today and see Bailey being celebrated can go a long way in letting them know that it’s OK to be who you are and dream big. Visibility matters. Visibility can help save lives.\n\n\tThe Sexiest Man Alive will not erase the homophobia that is at the root of so many bullies’ physical and emotional torment of kids who are queer. Bailey’s photo shoot and videos won’t stop the political attacks on the LGBTQ community. Bailey’s visibility may make some, if not many, homophobes dig their heels in even deeper because his presence, fame and sex appeal are a threat to their twisted narratives that gay people are a danger to society.\n\t\n\n\tBut Bailey’s visibility can chip away at some of the homophobia as well as the isolation and fear that so many LGBTQ kids continue to face no matter how much progress has been made. And that’s what really matters.\n\n\tIn May 2024, on the Met Gala red carpet, I interviewed Bailey about his then-upcoming cameo on “Heartstopper,” the groundbreaking Netflix series about gay teens. “I wish I had that growing up,” Bailey told me about the show, continuing, “It’s not just for our community. It’s for every person who is a member of a family who has a member of the LGBT+ community. It helps all of us.”\n\n\tThe same could be said about this year’s Sexiest Man Alive: He is helping all of us.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tFox Entertainment, making another move to embrace creator-driven content, has acquired rom-com podcast company Meet Cute.\n\n\tTerms of the deal weren’t disclosed. Founded in 2019, New York-based Meet Cute had raised $9.25 million in funding from investors including Union Square Ventures, Lerer Hippeau, Shari Redstone’s Advancit Capital and LocalGlobe.\n\n\tMeet Cute founder and CEO Naomi Shah (pictured above) has joined Fox Entertainment as senior VP, operations and strategy. In that role, she will focus on “AI innovation, entertainment technology and IP expansion,” according to the company.\n\t\n\n\tUnder Fox Entertainment, Meet Cute will serve as “a rapid-development content incubator, producing premium scripted and soon-to-launch unscripted series,” the company said. Meet Cute’s “agile, cost-efficient production model” is a valuable collaboration tool for Fox Entertainment Studios “as it widens its storytelling reach.”\n\n\t“Innovation in digital storytelling is shaping the future of entertainment, and with Meet Cute, we’re building a space where creators can move fast, take risks, and shape what’s next,” said Hannah Pillemer, head of scripted at Fox Entertainment Studios, who is overseeing Meet Cute. “It’s a creative lab for storytelling — developing and testing new voices and IP in real time and connecting bold emotionally resonant stories to audiences everywhere.”\n\n\tMeet Cute has released more than 200 hours of original “bite-sized” scripted audio programming, reaching more than 2.5 million listeners globally, the company claims. It has published 51 shows to date, per its Apple Podcasts channel, including “Burn, Baby,” “Arlo’s Type,” “Einstein and Elena,” “Dump Him!” starring Minnie Mills, and “Imperfect Match” starring Arden Cho. The company’s name refers to “a cute, charming or amusing first encounter between romantic partners (as in a movie),” according to Merriam-Webster.\n\t\n\n\tThe Meet Cute acquisition is part of Fox Entertainment’s long-term, tech-focused growth strategy, which the Fox Corp. division says is global, platform-agnostic and “talent-first.” Fox Entertainment recently entered into a reciprocal first-look deal with HarperCollins Publishers and invested in in Holywater, a Ukrainian tech firm focused on vertical video and microdramas. The goal is to have “a three-pronged ecosystem where IP can originate from any format — books, audio, or digital — and evolve seamlessly across media, while shortening traditional development cycles and allowing the studio to make data-informed decisions on what to scale into series, films or multiplatform franchises,” per Fox Entertainment’s announcement.\n\n\tShah said in a statement, “From day one, Meet Cute’s mission was to build stories at the speed of culture. Joining Fox Entertainment allows us to scale that vision — giving creators a faster path from idea to audience, integrating real-time audience feedback, and bringing new voices and formats to life across Fox’s global platforms.”\n\n\tShah, prior to founding Meet Cute, was a member of the investment team at Union Square Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm in New York. Prior to that, she worked as an equities trader at Goldman Sachs. Shah holds a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering with a minor in human biology from Stanford University.\n\n\tFox Entertainment comprises the Fox Television Network, Fox Entertainment Studios and Fox Entertainment Global, its worldwide content sales and licensing unit. Its original series include “The Simpsons,” “Doc,” “Extracted,” “Memory of a Killer,” “The Masked Singer,” “The Floor,” “Animal Control,” “Going Dutch,” “Murder in a Small Town,” “Hell’s Kitchen” and “Lego Masters.”\n",

In his new role, Lichtman will oversee MCT’s corporate operations, as well as its business and legal affairs. His responsibilities not only apply to the company, but encompass its expanding portfolio, including the newly launched distributor, Row K Entertainment, and Eli Roth’s The Horror Section.\n\n\tLichtman joins MCT following his tenure as general counsel at Artists Equity, where he was instrumental in sourcing and negotiating major corporate, financial and content acquisition transactions for the company, which was launched by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. These included overseeing deals related to such releases as “The Accountant 2” and “Unstoppable” (Amazon), “Small Things Like These” and “Night Watchman” (Lionsgate), and “RIP” (Netflix). He previously spent nearly a decade at STX Entertainment as executive vice president, corporate strategy and associate general counsel, where he was instrumental in managing the company’s theatrical slate financing arrangements, corporate financings and multiple cross-border transactions.\n\t\n\n\tLichtman began his career at O’Melveny & Myers and later became a partner at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, where he represented major studios, producers and financial institutions across the entertainment industry.\n\n\n\t“We’re thrilled that Jordan is joining MCT at a moment when our business is growing on every front,” said MCT principals Christopher Woodrow and Raj Singh. “He’s spent his career helping build forward-thinking entertainment companies, navigating both creative, financial, and legal complexity with precision.

We’ve earned the trust of filmmakers, studios, and investors alike, and there’s an incredible future ahead of us as we solidify MCT’s position as a top-tier innovator across entertainment.”\n\n\tMCT is a media and entertainment investment company founded in 2019. The company is backed by a range of institutional investors, including MassMutual. MCT has been Lionsgate’s primary slate co-financing partner since 2023 and has invested in 20 films with the studio, including “Ballerina,” “Flight Risk,” “The Long Walk” and “Saw X.”\n\n\tIn early 2025, MCT partnered with iconic filmmaker Eli Roth to launch The Horror Section. The media company’s upcoming projects include Roth’s “Ice Cream Man,” which is slated for wide theatrical release in 2026, and “Don’t Go in That House, Bitch!,” with Snoop Dogg on board as a producer as well as writer and performer on the original soundtrack.\n\n\tIn August, MCT launched Row K Entertainment, a new U.S. theatrical distribution company. Its 2026 slate includes Gus Van Sant’s “Dead Man’s Wire,” Maude Apatow’s directorial debut, “Poetic License,” and Jaume Collet-Serra’s “Cliffhanger.” MCT and Row K are both represented by CAA.\n",

The ask was quickly on Trump's radar, and he even told the media about it.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          Diddy fell out of Trump's graces in 2020 when he supported Joe Biden for president, but Trump did not slam the door shut on showing Diddy mercy ... and now it sounds like Diddy is pretty confident Trump is going to swoop in and help.\n      \n    \n          Stay tuned ...\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Donald Trump\n              \n                          \n                Diddy\n              \n                          \n                President Trump\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Diddy Trial\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

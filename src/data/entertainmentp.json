    "body": "\n\tVecna has struck again!\n\n\tNetflix crashed for some useres Wednesday night as the series finale of “Stranger Things” premiered. The streamer also experienced technical problems a few weeks ago during the Season 5 premiere on Nov. 26.\n\n\tThe streamer crashed right at 5 p.m. PT, coinciding with the drop time for the “Stranger Things 5” finale. The crash lasted roughly a minute and was fixed after a few refreshes. As was the case last time, users encountering the error were met with an image from “Nailed It!” with the caption: “Something went wrong. Sorry, we’re having trouble with your request. You’ll find lots to explore on the home page.” \n\t\n\n\tDuring the Nov. 26 crash, Netflix was down for about five minutes when the first four episodes of Season 5 released at 5 p.m. PT. Season 4 of “Stranger Things” also caused some technical issues back in July 2022 when the final episodes dropped. Outside of the Upside Down, Netflix had livestream issues when the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing match aired live last year.\n\n\n\tNetflix survived the second batch of “Stranger Things” Season 5 episodes, which released on Christmas Day and had no technical problems. Those episodes powered Netflix to its highest viewership ever for Christmas Day. Season 5 was the most-watched title worldwide thanks to the three new episodes. Between Dec. 22-28, the fifth and final season received 34.5 million views. That marked the season’s second-best weekly total after its debut with 59.6 million views in November, which was Netflix’s best-ever opening week for an English-language title.\n\t\n\n\tThe highly anticipated series finale also premieres in select theaters on New Year’s Eve. According to co-creator Ross Duffer, 1.1 million people have RSVP’d to theatrical screenings. He added that 3,500 screenings are sold out across 620 theaters.\n\n\t“What a way to close out a 10-year journey — together,” he wrote on Instagram with his brother and co-creator Matt Duffer. “Maybe we’ll see some of you in LA.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn a windy winter morning in New York, Ryan Seacrest and Rita Ora pose for photos in front of the freshly revealed New Year’s Eve Ball.\n\tThe decorated ball, perched 25 stories high atop One Times Square, is the largest to date (fitted with 5,280 Waterford crystals and LED pucks). As photographers, journalists and publicists huddle around them in scarves and beanies, the hosts power through photo ops and interviews, sustaining the same charisma and smiles that families have grown accustomed to watching at the end of every year. \n\t\n\t“Any chance we can take this interview inside?” Seacrest quipped to Variety. “What’s great is families don’t have to leave the house for all the excitement. That’s what we do. For hours.”\n\n\tSeacrest and Ora may bundle up even warmer than usual. This year’s show (as the upgraded ball already indicated) is bigger than ever. “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest 2026” has been expanded by 90 minutes, marking the longest telecast in the show’s 54-year history. And for the first time, there’s a live Central Time Zone countdown from Chicago, co-hosted by Chance the Rapper, and parties across New York, Las Vegas, Chicago, Puerto Rico and L.A.Over 42 performers are set for the night, spanning more than 90 songs — a lineup that collectively boasts 925 million monthly Spotify listeners and 102 billion streams across their catalogs. Diana Ross will headline from Times Square, with additional performances from Post Malone, Chappell Roan, Ciara, LE SSERAFIM, Little Big Town, Maren Morris, and more. West Coast performers include Mariah Carey, Demi Lovato, OneRepublic, 50 Cent, Charlie Puth, and Huntr/x from “KPop Demon Hunters.”“You just know everyone’s going to be tuning in this year,” Ora said. It’s the British singer’s third year hosting the holiday event. For Seacrest, it’s his 21st.\n\tThis year hits differently for Seacrest. His father, Gary, died in October after a long battle with prostate cancer. “This was a tough year. I lost my best friend,” he says, noting that time with family has reshaped what this night means to him. “People want to feel good. You can watch this show and you can feel alright for a few hours. And then you can set the scene for a big start in the new year.”\n\t\n\tOra, with a fourth studio record and tour on the horizon, is approaching 2026 with intention. “It’s about getting in tune with my creativity,” she says. “Where I want to take it next year. I’ve been so inspired by the music coming out. I just want to see where that leads.” But she’s not ready to tease the music just yet. She kindly (but firmly) shut down the opportunity to tease what the sound of her new album will be like. Seacrest grins, “New album, let’s go!”“Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest 2026” airs live Wednesday, Dec. 31 at 8/7c on ABC, with next-day streaming on Hulu. Produced by Dick Clark Productions, NYRE remains the nation’s No. 1 New Year’s celebration, reaching an audience 2.5 times the size of its closest competition at 11:30, CBS’ “New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash.”",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Trump took to Truth Social on Wednesday afternoon to poke fun at George Clooney and his family for becoming French citizens. He also made sure to loop in some of his favorite political targets: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom.\n\n\t“Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden.” Trump wrote.\n\t\n\n\tHe contiuned, “Remember when Clooney, after the now infamous debate, dumped Joe during a fundraiser, only to go onto the side of another stellar candidate, Jamala(K!), who is now fighting it out with the worst governor in the Country, including Tim Waltz, Gavin Newscum, for who is going to lead the Democrats to their future defeat. Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies. He wasn’t a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics.”\n\n\n\tClooney is an outspoken critic of Trump and a staunch supporter of the Democratic Party. Back in April, the “Jay Kelly” star told CBS that he pays no mind to Trump’s insults and mocked the president as a “fake movie actor.”\n\n\t“I don’t care,” Clooney said. “I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time. My job is not to please the President of the United States. My job is to try and tell the truth when I can and when I have the opportunity. I am well aware of the idea that people will not like that. … People will criticize that. Elon Musk has weighed in [about me]. That is their right. It’s my right to say the other side.”\n\t\n\n\tIn a recent cover story with Variety, Clooney addressed Trump’s second-term lawsuits against the media and encouraged networks to stand up to the president rather than settle.\n\n\t“If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go fuck yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,” Clooney said. “That’s simply the truth.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s not as if music and politics haven’t been strange bedfellows for decades. But the bedding down got weirder than ever in 2025, when you were as likely to see music superstars pop up in the headlines of a D.C. news site like Politico as on Pitchfork. Here are some of the year’s highlights — or, let’s be real, lowlights — in that crossover zone:\n\n\tJan. 20 — Performers at President Trump’s inaugural events include such GOP-favoring artists as Jason Aldean and Kid Rock (who roars, “Is MAGA in the house tonight?”) as well as less obviously partisan Carrie Underwood, who takes the most heat from anti-Trumpers. She says she’s doing it because “we must all come together in the spirit of unity,” which in 2025 does not count as taking the temperature of the room.\n\t\n\n\tMay 15— Bruce Springsteen tells a British audience that America is “in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.” Trump responds by calling Springsteen “highly overrated,” “dumb as a rock” and a “dried out prune of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!).” The president did not lend the Boss any tangerine orange moisturizer tips.\n\n\n\tMay 16 — Unprompted by much of anything, the president contends that music’s biggest superstar has gone from hero to zero under his withering social Truths: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’” Three months later, as an addendum to his praise of Sydney Sweeney, he adds of Swift, “I can’t stand her (HATE!).” OMG, gag him with a spoon!\n\n\tMay 29 — In one of many conciliatory moves toward the hip-hop community, Trump pardons Young Boy NBA on a guns conviction. Pras and Diddy lobby for their own pardons (not yet successfully) since the’re being handed out like candy.\n\t\n\n\tOct. 8 — House Speaker Mike Johnson says Bad Bunny being booked for the Super Bowl halftime show is “a terrible decision… In my view, you would have Lee Greenwood, or role models, doing that. Not somebody like this… It sounds like he’s not someone who appeals to a broader audience.” We’ll see whether his math on the seats he needs to hold onto in 2026 is better than his math on Bad Bunny’s stats. Anyhow, way to court that Latino vote.\n\n\tNov. 7 — Trolling with the best, the White House begins a video meme campaign consisting of appropriating huge pop stars or hits for pro-ICE videos. Olivia Rodrigo blasts back: “Don’t ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda.” Sabrina Carpenter calls a meme using her music “evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.” Tweeted SZA: “White House rage baiting artists for free promo is PEAK DARK.” Of course, for this administration, triggering the world’s most beloved stars is a feature, not a flaw.\n\n\tDec. 7 —Kennedy Center honorees including Kiss and George Strait come to the White House for a medallion ceremony. Gene Simmons,  a longtime friend of the president, insists he is apolitical, but supports the president’s East Wing teardown: ““Have you ever been to Versailles? The American house of the people is shameful.” And he knows shame. So does Cheap Trick, which plays the Honors event to cover Kiss’ “Rock N Roll All Nite,” then lives to regret it every day. Many left-leaning supporters go online to renounce their CT fandom, leading the group to issue a Dec. 17 statement swearing they weren’t there supporting Trump.\n\n\tDec. 12 —Nicki Minaj goes after California governor Gavin Newsom for supporting trans kids, calling him a “wicked and evil man” who will be “obliterated” by her campaign against him. Newsom simply responds by posting Megan Thee Stallion’s anti-Minaj diss track, “Hiss.” It gets weirder when Vice President JD Vance, the recent subject of supportive Minaj posts, tweets “Nicki > Cardi” — further establishing that all adult political life is like high school, just not not as mature or noble.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe “Avengers: Doomsday” marketing campaign continued with a Thor-centric teaser that delighted many Marvel fans by standing in stark contrast to the divisively silly “Thor: Love and Thunder,” the 2022 tentpole that marked Chris Hemsworth‘s last outing as the God of Thunder. The teary-eyed Thor who appears in the “Doomsday” teaser praying before battle is miles away from the wise-cracking goofball Thor became in the MCU.\n\n\t“Father, all my life I’ve answered every call, to honor, duty, to war. Now fate has given me something I never sought. A child, a life untouched by the storm,” Thor says in the “Doomsday” theater in an ultra-serious tone. “Grant me the strength of the old fathers, so that I may fight once more, defeat one more enemy, and return home to her. Not as a warrior, but as warmth, to teach her not battle, but stillness, the kind I never knew. Please father heed my word.”\n\t\n\n\tGiving Thor his own brooding “Doomsday” teaser sends a clear message to Marvel fans that the superhero is changing tone for his return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While “Love and Thunder” earned a robust $760 million worldwide in summer 2022, it polarized fans by pushing Thor to the limit of silliness. Even Hemsworth criticized the movie, admitting in a 2023 GQ magazine profile that “Love and Thunder” was “too silly” for its own good.\n\n\t“I think we just had too much fun. It just became too silly,” Hemsworth said about the movie. “It’s always hard being in the center of it and having any real perspective…I love the process, it’s always a ride. But you just don’t know how people are going to respond.”\n\t\n\n\tHemsworth said his biggest critics were his son’s friends. “It’s a bunch of eight-year-olds critiquing my film. ‘We thought this one had too much humor, the action was cool but the VFX weren’t as good,’” he said. “I cringe and laugh equally at it.”\n\n\tThe actor doubled down a year later in Vanity Fair’s May 2024 issue, saying: “I got caught up in the improv and the wackiness, and I became a parody of myself. I didn’t stick the landing.”\n\n\tHemsworth added he grew frustrated with the character while playing him in four standalone Marvel films and additional “Avengers” movies, explaining: “Sometimes I felt like a security guard for the team. I would read everyone else’s lines, and go, ‘Oh, they got way cooler stuff. They’re having more fun. What’s my character doing?’ It was always about, ‘You’ve got the wig on. You’ve got the muscles. You’ve got the costume. Where’s the lighting?’ Yeah, I’m part of this big thing, but I’m probably pretty replaceable.”\n\n\tDespite the self-criticism, Hemsworth was always clear that he wanted to give Thor another shot and gives fans the God of Thunder they deserve after the misstep of “Love and Thunder.” He also told Entertainment Weekly in 2023 that his next Thor movie would need to be “unpredictable.” \n\n\t“I don’t want to continue to do it until people are so exhausted that they roll their eyes when they see me come on the screen as that character,” Hemsworth said “If an audience wants to see it, and if there’s something that we believe is exciting and fun, then great. I’ve loved being able to reinvent that character a few times. I don’t have the answer yet, but I would love to try and [figure out] how we can do that again and keep it a little unpredictable.”\n\n\t“Avengers: Doomsday” opens in theaters Dec. 18, 2026. Watch the Thor teaser in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix broke a record with one of its Christmas Day NFL games this year. 27.5 million viewers tuned in for the livestream of the Minnesota Vikings-Detroit Lions game according to Nielsen, marking the most-streamed NFL game in U.S. history.\n\n\tThat number represents the average number of viewers tuned in at any given moment of the livestream, though the game’s most-watched moment reached more than 30 million viewers. When isolating the halftime show, “Snoop’s Holiday Halftime Party,” viewership averaged at 29 million.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix also streamed the Dallas Cowboys-Washington Commanders game on Christmas Day, reaching an average audience of 19.9 million viewers. Another Christmas NFL game was streamed by Amazon Prime Video and ranked in between Netflix’s streams: The Denver Broncos-Kansas City Chiefs livestream averaged 21.1 million viewers and became Amazon’s most-watched Thursday Night Football regular-season game ever.\n\n\n\tNetflix’s first-ever Christmas games last year averaged 24.3 million and 24.1 million viewers, fewer than this year’s Lions-Vikings game but more than the Cowboys-Commanders game. Between last year’s games and this year’s Lions-Vikings game, Netflix has now been the distributor of all three of the all-time most-streamed NFL games in the U.S.\n\n\tWhile the above data from Nielsen refers to viewership in the U.S. alone, Netflix’s NFL games were available across the globe. The streamer reports that viewers from over 200 countries and territories tuned in to at least one of the 2025 games, with the Lions-Vikings game hitting an average minute audience of 30.5 million viewers worldwide and the Cowboys-Commanders game reaching 22.4 million.\n\t\n\n\tThe NFL games added to an already strong viewership day for Netflix, which also debuted Volume 2 of the fifth and final season of “Stranger Things” on Christmas Day. While exact an exact Christmas Day total wasn’t shared, the season was Netflix’s No. 1 most-watched title worldwide on Dec. 25 and achieved 34.5 million views throughout the week of Dec. 22-28.\n\n\tBesides the games themselves, the NFL telecasts featured an extensive lineup of entertainment including some Netflix talent: Snoop Dogg brought out the singers behind Huntr/x, the fictional girl group from the animated film “KPop Demon Hunters.” Snoop was also joined by Lainey Wilson, and Martha Stewart introduced the show with a Snoop-themed parody of “‘Twas the Night Before Christmas.” For the Cowboys-Commanders game, the halftime show was led by Sugarhill Gang.\n\n\tBoth games were produced by CBS Sports, with NFL Media producing the pre- and post-game as well as studio halftime programming. EverWonder Studio executive produced Netflix’s telecast.\n",

    "body": "\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\tDec 31, 2025 10:00am PT\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\tIf I Had an Oscar Ballot: Brazil’s Secret, Gaza’s Voice and the Year Sin and Grief Became Cinema\n\tAwards Circuit Column: The year’s defining films, plus the television series and performances that felt just as essential.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Images\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t2025 offered cinematic encounters of a rare kind. Thunderous spectacles unfurled alongside hushed, inward-facing character studies. Some films swung wildly and missed — gloriously so — while others landed with such quiet authority, they seemed to rearrange the room. It was a year defined by daring, by filmmakers who trusted audiences to lean in rather than sit back.\n\n\tStart with the consensus triumphs — films that felt instantly canonical.\n\n\tChloé Zhao’s “Hamnet” is a masterwork of grief rendered as poetry. Jessie Buckley delivers a performance of almost unbearable emotional clarity as a mother splintered by loss, yet somehow still breathing.\n\n\tRyan Coogler’s “Sinners” is something else entirely — muscular, ambitious and alive. It’s the work of a filmmaker proving, yet again, that his range knows no borders. Michael B. Jordan’s dual performances are feats of control and intensity. Breakout Miles Caton and the indelible Wunmi Mosaku provide the emotional ballast that keeps the film grounded even as it soars.\n\n\tStill, the pulse of my deepest excitement beats in Brazil, for the second straight year after Oscar winner “I’m Still Here.”\n\n\tKleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent” is a slow-burning thriller that tightens its grip almost imperceptibly. Wagner Moura is hypnotic, coiled with tension and weary intelligence, while Tânia Maria storms in with scene-stealing authority. Meanwhile, Tunisian auteur Kaouther Ben Hania’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab” is a gut punch — filmmaking that refuses comfort or distance. Saja Kalani, criminally overlooked, gives a raw performance of elemental power as an emergency call center volunteer in Gaza. And Oliver Laxe’s Spanish-language “Sirāt” is a fever dream that feels like the long-lost cousin of “Mad Max: Fury Road,” built for the biggest screen you can find.\n\n\tThen there are the films fighting for oxygen, the ones that slipped through the cracks or hovered just outside the safety of consensus.\n\n\tClint Bentley’s “Train Dreams” gives William H. Macy a late-career performance of startling grace, a meditation on American solitude etched into every line of his face. Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia” divided audiences with its trademark strangeness. Still, Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons are mesmerizing together, while Aidan Delbis announces himself as a talent of rare specificity and soul. Rian Johnson’s latest “Knives Out” whodunit, “Wake Up Dead Man,” offers Josh O’Connor another showcase for his chameleonic range, while James Vanderbilt’s “Nuremberg” sees Russell Crowe delivering his most commanding work in two decades in a historical drama that feels uncomfortably contemporary. And the discovery of multi-hyphenate Eva Victor with the poignantly moving “Sorry, Baby” is a moment we’re taking for granted.\n\n\tIf I had an Oscar ballot, I’d use it to honor films that risked misunderstanding, performances that revealed something frightening or tender about being human and directors who believed audiences would meet them halfway. \n\n\tWe can’t forget about the best of TV.\n\n\tTelevision is considered here with the same rigor as the films championed, and not through the mechanics of Emmy categories, but through cultural impact and artistic achievement. This list prioritizes series and performances that defined the year’s conversation, measuring critical distinction alongside visibility, virality and sustained audience engagement. These selections reflect television experienced in real time: debated, dissected, memed and argued over. It’s an Oscar-style snapshot of TV in 2025, honoring the shows and singular achievements that didn’t just excel, but dominated the cultural imagination.\n\n\tAlways nice to include a disclaimer. If a movie isn’t present in any given category, it doesn’t mean “I hated it.” Making the top five in anything is difficult. Every ballot tells a story about what we value in art. This is mine.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Picture of the Year\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“The Secret Agent” (Neon)\n“The Voice of Hind Rajab” (Willa)\n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\n“Hamnet” (Focus Features)\n“Sirāt” (Neon)\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix)\n“Sorry, Baby” (A24)\n“Bugonia” (Focus Features)\n“It Was Just an Accident” (Neon)\n“Nuremberg” (Sony Pictures Classics)\n\n\n\n\tWinner: “The Secret Agent” — Kleber Mendonça Filho, Emilie Lesclaux\n\n\tKleber Mendonça Filho’s slow-burning Brazilian thriller is a masterclass in atmospheric tension. Every frame feels loaded with moral ambiguity and political dread. It’s the kind of film that accumulates its brilliance, scene by methodical scene, until you realize you’ve been holding your breath.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “Dead Man’s Wire” (Row K Entertainment); “Eternity” (A24); “A House of Dynamite” (Netflix); “Is This Thing On?” (Searchlight Pictures); “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” (GKids); “The Plague” (IFC); “Superman” (DC Studios); “The Testament of Ann Lee” (Searchlight Pictures); “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” (Netflix); “Wicked: For Good” (Universal Pictures)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDirector\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Willa\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nRyan Coogler, “Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\nKleber Mendonça Filho, “The Secret Agent” (Neon)\nKaouther Ben Hania, “The Voice of Hind Rajab” (Willa)\nOliver Laxe, “Sirāt” (Neon)\nChloé Zhao, “Hamnet” (Focus Features)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: Kaouther Ben Hania\n\n\tBen Hania directs with urgency and restraint in equal measure, refusing to sensationalize Gaza’s ongoing tragedy while ensuring we feel every agonizing second. Her camera work is intimate without being invasive, and observational without being detached. She understands that bearing witness is an active choice, not a passive act, and “The Voice of Hind Rajab” becomes a document of both crisis and humanity. \n\n\tNotable mentions: Clint Bentley (“Train Dreams”); Mona Fastvold (“The Testament of Ann Lee”); Yorgos Lanthimos (“Bugonia”); Richard Linklater (“Nouvelle Vague”); Jafar Panahi (“It Was Just an Accident”)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Actor in a Leading Role\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nOscar Isaac, “Frankenstein” (Netflix)\nDwayne Johnson, “The Smashing Machine” (A24)\nMichael B. Jordan, “Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\nWagner Moura, “The Secret Agent” (Neon)\nJosh O’Connor, “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” (Netflix)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: Wagner Moura\n\n\tMoura delivers a performance of coiled intensity and weary intelligence as a man navigating Brazil’s labyrinthine political underworld. His work is largely internal with flickers of doubt, suppressed panic and dangerous calculations playing out behind tired eyes. This is acting rooted in the understanding that power isn’t loud; it’s the choice to stay silent when speaking out could cost everything. \n\n\tNotable mentions: Will Arnett (“Is This Thing On?”); Russell Crowe (“Nuremberg”); Paul Mescal (“Hamnet”); Sean Penn (“One Battle After Another”); Jesse Plemons (“Bugonia”); Tonatiuh (“Kiss of the Spider Woman”)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Actress in a Leading Role\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nJessie Buckley, “Hamnet” (Focus Features)\nKate Hudson, “Song Sung Blue” (Focus Features)\nSaja Kalani, “The Voice of Hind Rajab” (Willa)\nRenate Reinsve, “Sentimental Value” (Neon)\nEva Victor, “Sorry, Baby” (A24)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: Jessie Buckley\n\n\tBuckley’s portrayal of Agnes, a mother undone by grief, is nearly unbearable and impossible to look away from. She inhabits sorrow and its physical weight, bending posture, fracturing speech and draining energy from the body. Buckley captures the brutal truth that grief isn’t singular but cyclical: rage, numbness, guilt and suddenly, a piercing clarity colliding without warning. In “Hamnet,” her performance has the potential to be considered an all-timer — one that we may look back on 50 years from now and wonder how she ever did it.\n\n\tNotable mentions: Cynthia Erivo (“Wicked: For Good”); Ariana Grande (“Wicked: For Good”); Elizabeth Olsen (“Eternity”); Amanda Seyfried (“The Testament of Ann Lee”); Emma Stone (“Bugonia”)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Actor in a Supporting Role\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Warner Bros.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nJames Belushi, “The Chronology of Water” (The Forge)\nMiles Caton, “Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\nAidan Delbis, “Bugonia” (Focus Features)\nBenicio Del Toro, “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)\nWilliam H. Macy, “Train Dreams” (Netflix)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: Miles Caton\n\n\tCaton arrives in “Sinners” and immediately claims space alongside Michael B. Jordan’s dual powerhouse performance without flinching. His work is grounded, specific and emotionally and musically transparent. Caton brings a naturalism that anchors the film’s more heightened elements, reminding us that even in genre storytelling, the smallest human gestures matter most. This is a breakout performance that doesn’t feel like one; it feels like watching an actor who’s been doing this forever.\n\n\tNotable mentions: Damson Idris, “F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.); Jacobi Jupe (“Hamnet”); Lewis Pullman (“The Testament of Ann Lee”); Alexander Skarsgård, “Pillion” (A24); Leo Woodall (“Nuremberg”)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Actress in a Supporting Role\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nOdessa A’zion, “Marty Supreme” (A24)\nNaomi Ackie, “Sorry, Baby” (A24)\nMariam Afshari, “It Was Just an Accident” (Neon)\nKirsten Dunst, “Roofman” (Paramount Pictures)\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph, “Eternity” (A24)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: Odessa A’zion\n\n\tA’zion steals every scene she’s in with a turn that balances old Hollywood glamour with modern ferocity. She understands that supporting work isn’t about fading into the background — even if you are sharing the screen with Timothée Chalamet — it’s about knowing exactly when to step forward and take control of the entire room. A’zion plays intelligence as flirtation and ambition as survival, never letting the character become a type. Her work in “Marty Supreme” is electric, funny and surprisingly moving.\n\n\tNotable mentions: Emily Blunt (“The Smashing Machine”); Zoey Deutch (“Nouvelle Vague”); Regina Hall (“One Battle After Another”); Wunmi Mosaku (“Sinners”); Mari Yamamoto (“Rental Family”)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Original Screenplay\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Neon\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“Dead Man’s Wire” (Row K Entertainment) — Austin Kolodney\n“Eternity” (A24) — Pat Cunnane and David Freyne\n“The Secret Agent” (Neon) — Kleber Mendonça Filho\n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — Ryan Coogler\n“Sorry, Baby” (A24) — Eva Victor\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “The Secret Agent”\n\n\tFilho’s script is a miracle of structure and restraint. He builds tension through conversation, paranoia through silence, and political commentary through character. “The Secret Agent” never stops to explain itself, trusting that audiences can navigate moral complexity without a map. The dialogue crackles with subtext and every exchange feels like a negotiation over life and death.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “Black Bag” (Focus Features); “A House of Dynamite” (Netflix); “Is This Thing On?” (Searchlight Pictures); “It Was Just an Accident” (Neon); “The Voice of Hind Rajab” (Willa)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Adapted Screenplay\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Agata Grzybowska\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“Bugonia” (Focus Features) — Will Tracy\n“The Chronology of Water” (The Forge) — Kristen Stewart\n“Hamnet” (Focus Features) — Maggie O’Farrell and Chloé Zhao\n“The Life of Chuck” (Neon) — Mike Flanigan\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix) — Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “Hamnet”\n\n\tO’Farrell and Zhao adapt grief into something cinematic without diminishing its literary power. “Hamnet” never loses sight of what the story is actually about — a parent’s unbearable loss and a marriage tested by sorrow. The script makes space for silence, for the moments when language fails, and structures the narrative like memory itself.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “Frankenstein” (Netflix); “Lilo & Stitch” (Walt Disney Pictures); “Nuremberg” (Sony Pictures Classics); “Superman” (DC Studios); “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” (Netflix)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCasting\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Colle\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nNicholas Campbell and Jessica Wolhuter, “Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight” (Sony Pictures Classics)\nNina Gold, “Hamnet” (Focus Features)\nStéphane Batut, “Nouvelle Vague” (Netflix)\nRebecca Dealy, “The Plague” (IFC)\nFrancine Maisler, “Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “Nouvelle Vague”\n\n\tBatut’s casting for “Nouvelle Vague” feels like discovering a secret. The ensemble operates as a true collective, each actor bringing specificity without overwhelming the whole. Batut understands that casting isn’t just about finding the “right” actor for each role; it’s about building a chemistry that makes the entire film feel alive. Especially when looking for the actors to play Jean-Luc Godard, Jean Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “Bugonia” (Focus Features); “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” (A24); “Lilo and Stitch” (Walt Disney Pictures); “The Secret Agent” (Neon); “Sirât” (Neon); “Weapons” (Warner Bros.)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Animated Feature\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: GKids\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“Arco” (Neon)\n“In Your Dreams” (Netflix)\n“KPop Demon Hunters” (Netflix)\n“Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” (GKids)\n“Zootopia 2” (Walt Disney Pictures)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain”\n\n\tThis animated gem finds wonder in the most minor details. “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” is quietly radical in its refusal to overexplain or condescend. The animation is painterly and patient, allowing moments to breathe and images to linger. It truly is one of the year’s most delightful movies.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “The Bad Guys 2” (DreamWorks Animation); “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle” (Crunchyroll); “Elio” (Pixar); “Predator: Killer of Killers” (Hulu); \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Production Design\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Focus Features\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“Hamnet” (Focus Features) — Fiona Crombie and Alice Felton\n“The Secret Agent” (Neon) — Thales Junqueira\n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — Hannah Beachler and Monique Champagne\n“Superman” (DC Studios) — Beth Mickle and Rosemary Brandenburg\n“Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” (Netflix) — Rick Heinrichs, Kathryn Pyle and Raelyn Tepper\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “Hamnet”\n\n\t“Hamnet” doesn’t merely recreate the Globe Theatre — it conjures a world where grief is present within walls. Every room feels lived-in, and every texture worn by hands and time. This is design work that understands its job isn’t decoration but is to tell a story, using space and objects to make the invisible visible. \n\n\tNotable mentions: “Bugonia” (Focus Features); “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” (Marvel Studios); “Frankenstein” (Netflix); “Nouvelle Vague” (Netflix); Train Dreams” (Netflix)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Cinematography\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“No Other Choice” (Neon) — Kim Woo-hyung\n“The Secret Agent” (Neon) — Evgenia Alexandrova\n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — Autumn Durald Arkapaw\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix) — Adolpho Veloso\n“The Voice of Hind Rajab” (Willa) — Juan Sarmiento G.\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “Train Dreams”\n\n\tVeloso shoots the American West like a fading memory. It’s beautiful, harsh and disappearing even as we watch. His work in “Train Dreams” is all long takes and patient observation, allowing landscapes to dwarf the human figure while never losing sight of the man within them. The cinematography knows that loneliness is a spatial relationship. Shatters the heart into pieces.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “Black Bag” (Focus Features); “The Chronology of Water” (The Forge); “F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.); “Sentimental Value” (Neon); “Sirāt” (Neon)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Costume Design\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“Frankenstein” (Netflix) — Kate Hawley\n“Nouvelle Vague” (Netflix) — Pascaline Chavanne\n“Nuremberg” (Sony Pictures Classics) — Bartholomew Cariss\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix) — Malgosia Turzanska\n“Wicked: For Good” (Universal Pictures) — Paul Tazewell\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “Wicked: For Good”\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is a riot of color, texture and character specificity. Every outfit tells a story about who these characters are becoming, how power shapes presentation, and how rebellion looks when it refuses to be drab. The costumes balance fantasy with truth, never letting spectacle overwhelm character.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “Hamnet” (Focus Features); “Sinners” (Warner Bros.); “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” (20th Century Studios); “The Testament of Ann Lee” (Searchlight Pictures); “The Ugly Stepsister” (IFC)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Film Editing\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“The Alabama Solution” (HBO Documentary Films) — Page Marsella\n“Hamnet” (Focus Features) — Affonso Gonçalves and Chloé Zhao\n“The Secret Agent” (Neon) — Matheus Farias and Eduardo Serrano\n“Sirāt” (Neon) — Cristóbal Fernández\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix) — Parker Laramie\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “The Secret Agent”\n\n\tFarias and Serrano edit “The Secret Agent” like a suspense mechanism tightening one notch at a time. It plays to an impeccable rhythm. The editing creates paranoia through pacing, making every transition feel loaded with a potential threat. \n\n\tNotable mentions: “Bugonia” (Focus Features); “F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.); “A House of Dynamite” (Netflix); “Sinners” (Warner Bros.); “The Voice of Hind Rajab” (Willa)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Makeup and Hairstyling\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Marcel Zyskind\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“Marty Supreme” (A24) — Mike Fontaine, Kay Georgiou, Kyra Panchenko\n“The Smashing Machine” (A24) — Felix Fox, Kazu Hiro, Mia Neal\n“Superman” (DC Studios) — Alexei Dmitriew, Peter Swords King, Shane Mahan\n“The Ugly Stepsister” (IFC) — Thomas Foldberg, Anne Cathrine Sauerberg\n“Wicked: For Good” (Universal Pictures) — Laura Blount, Mark Coulier, Frances Hannon\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “The Ugly Stepsister”\n\n\tThe hidden, underseen masterful work this year is the reinvention of the “Cinderella” tale. The work is fantastical without being alienating, and bold without being garish. The transformations are total, but never lose the performance underneath, a balance that’s harder than it looks.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “28 Years Later” (Sony Pictures); “Frankenstein” (Netflix); “Kiss of the Spider Woman” (Lionsgate/Roadside Attractions); “Predator: Badlands” (20th Century Studios); “Weapons” (Warner Bros.)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Sound\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Neon\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.) — Al Nelson, Gwendolyn Yates Whittle, Gary A.

Every engine roar, every scrape of metal, every moment of sudden silence becomes a narrative beat. This is sound work that creates a sensory experience that demands the biggest, loudest theater you can find. \n\n\tNotable mentions: “Bugonia” (Focus Features); “Frankenstein” (Netflix); “KPop Demon Hunters” (Netflix); “Sinners” (Warner Bros.); “Warfare” (A24)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Visual Effects\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Apple Original Films\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.)\n“In Your Dreams” (Netflix)\n“Superman” (DC Studios)\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix)\n“Wicked: For Good” (Universal Pictures)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “F1”\n\n\tThe visual effects in “F1” are so seamlessly integrated that you forget you’re watching them. The racing sequences feel tactile and dangerous, putting you inside the car without ever breaking immersion. The effects team knows the spectacle means nothing without spatial coherence. Nonetheless, you always know where you are, how fast you’re going, and what the stakes are. This is effects work in the service of storytelling rather than spectacle for its own sake.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Original Score\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Eli Ade\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“Ballad of a Small Player” (Netflix) — Volker Bertelmann\n“The Fantastic Four: First Steps” (Marvel Studios) — Michael Giacchino\n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — Ludwig Göransson\n“Sirāt” (Neon) — Kangding Ray\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix) — Bryce Dessner\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “Sinners”\n\n\tLudwig Göransson’s music in “Sinners” is a miracle of mood. He knows when to swell and when to disappear, when to underscore emotion and when to let the visuals do the work. The music feels both period-appropriate and utterly contemporary, blending genres and textures into something that sounds like nothing else. \n\n\tNotable mentions: “A House of Dynamite” (Netflix); “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.); “The Plague” (IFC); “Superman” (DC Studios); “Wicked: For Good” (Universal Pictures)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Original Song\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Warner Bros.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“KPop Demon Hunters” (Netflix) — “Golden” by Ejae, Mark Sonnenblick\n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — “I Lied to You” by Raphael Saadiq, Ludwig Göransson\n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — “Pale, Pale Moon” by Brittany Howard, Ludwig Göransson\n“The Testament of Ann Lee” (Searchlight Pictures) — “Hunger and Thirst” by Daniel Pemberton\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix) — “Train Dreams” by Nick Cave and Bryce Dessner\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “I Lied to You” from “Sinners”\n\n\t“I Lied to You” is haunting and impossible to shake. The song functions as an emotional anchor, a blues lament that carries the film’s themes of loss, survival and resilience, partnered with the hope for the future. Aside from being, in my estimation, the scene of the year, it’s the kind of song that feels like it’s always existed and has been a part of us.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “Free” from “KPop Demon Hunters” (Netflix); “Last Time (I Seen the Sun)” from “Sinners” (Warner Bros.); “Clothed by the Sun” from “The Testament of Ann Lee” (Searchlight Pictures)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Documentary Feature\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Apple TV/Courtesy Everett Coll\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“The Alabama Solution” (HBO Documentary Films)\n“Come See Me in the Good Light” (Apple Original Films)\n“The New Yorker at 100” (Netflix)\n“The Perfect Neighbor” (Netflix)\n“Predators” (MTV Documentary Films)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “Come See Me in the Good Light”\n\n\tA meditation on memory, aging and dignity, the filmmaking of Ryan White’s beautiful ode to a beautiful life is patient and compassionate, never rushing its subjects or imposing external narrative. “Come See Me in the Good Light” lets people speak for themselves, trusts their stories to land without manipulation, and finds profound beauty in ordinary lives lived with intention. \n\n\tNotable mentions: “Apocalypse in the Tropics” (Netflix); “BLACKNWS: Terms & Conditions” (Rich Spirit); “It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley” (Magnolia Pictures); “Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost” (Apple Original Films); “2000 Meters to Andriivka” (PBS)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest International Feature\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Victor Juca\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“It Was Just an Accident” (Neon) \n“Nouvelle Vague” (Netflix)\n“The Secret Agent” (Neon)\n“Sirāt” (Neon)\n“The Voice of Hind Rajab”\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “The Secret Agent”\n\n\tBrazil’s “The Secret Agent” is a political thriller that feels urgently contemporary no matter where you’re watching it.

    "body": "\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\tDec 31, 2025 10:00am PT\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\tVariety’s 2026 Media Predictions: ‘The Odyssey’ Domination, Disney CEO Shuffle and Netflix Winning Warner Bros. Deal\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShannon McCarthy \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\tFrom megamergers to disruptive new technologies, the media industry has a lot to pack into the next 12 months. Artificial intelligence continues to reshape the way movies, shows and music is made, roiling a business that is worried it will lead to more job cuts. Bob Iger is finally ready to move on from Disney (he pinkie-promises this time), setting up a succession battle for the ages. And Netflix and Paramount are locked in an epic fight over Warner Bros., a clash of titans — and egos — that shows no sign of abating. All of this is taking place as the box office is in a rut, cable is in free fall and the overall economy is teetering. So yeah, fun times! \n\t\n\n\tWe can’t say for certain what 2026 has in store, but we’re going out on a limb and channeling Nostradamus with predictions about the drama to come. \n\n\n\t“The Odyssey” Will Be the Year’s Biggest Hit\n\n\tThe name on everybody’s lips is gonna be Odysseus. Some of the biggest franchises in Hollywood history are returning to screens with sequels and spinoffs to “Star Wars,” “The Avengers,” “Toy Story,” “Super Mario Bros.” and “Dune.” But the film that will reign above them all is based on a piece of IP that’s been in the public domain for millennia. Christopher Nolan’s adaptation of Homer’s “The Odyssey” will dominate popcorn season: Who but Nolan could put Imax tickets on sale an entire year in advance and have fans snap them up in record time? And if he could turn the creation of the atomic bomb into a blockbuster, having people show up for an epic survival story that dates to the sixth century B.C. should be a piece of cake. \n\t\n\n\tNetflix Will Win the Warner Bros. Deal\n\n\tThe year is ending on a major M&A cliffhanger: Will Netflix or David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance score Warner Bros. Discovery? It sure looks like Netflix’s to lose, having swayed the WBD board with strong financials, its status as the No. 1 subscription streamer and co-CEO Ted Sarandos’ promise to keep the studio putting films in theaters. But there’s some regulatory uncertainty about the tie-up, and Trump remains a wild card. Meanwhile, Ellison and ultra-wealthy dad Larry Ellison aren’t going away without a fight. But to prevail in the hostile takeover move, the Ellisons need to get 90% of WBD shares voted for their all-in offer. It’s hard to see that happening unless Paramount and its backers are willing to go higher than the $30-a-share proposal on the table.\n\n\tThe Next Leader of the Magic Kingdom Is …\n\n\tBob Iger (finally!) is exiting stage left with his Mickey Mouse gold watch at the end of 2026. Who will get the call? Wall Street expects the shortlisted candidates to be Dana Walden, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, and Josh D’Amaro, head of the conglomerate’s parks and experiences division. Walden has the entertainment bona fides; D’Amaro is a respected leader at the company. It’s possible the board opts for a co-CEO arrangement, but that doesn’t feel like the Disney way. The board could also throw a curveball — and hire someone from the outside. But the directors are surely doing their fullest due diligence, given how things turned out last time. Let’s give the edge to D’Amaro. \n\n\tCan Hollywood Get Its Arms Around AI?\n\n\tIn the Wild West of artificial intelligence, entertainment companies are trying to swing both sticks and carrots. Disney, Universal and Warner Bros., for example, have sued two AI startups alleged to have ripped off their intellectual property. And Disney is trying to control its own AI destiny by going into business with OpenAI. Ultimately, Disney is betting eventual technical and legal guardrails will let it participate in the gold rush — and not be sideswiped by the slop. Expect the rest of the industry to explore similar strategies.\n\n\tMeanwhile, the music industry faces its own struggles with AI. For a few months, it seemed as though the biz was on the same page in viewing generative AI as a looming threat to human creativity and compensation. In July 2024, Sony, Universal and Warner teamed with the Recording Academy for two copyright infringement cases against AI music services Suno and Udio. But as AI music has gone from fringe to foreground — Xania Monet, for instance, became the first AI act to debut on a Billboard radio chart in November — the majors have instead struck deals; by the end of 2025, Warner had partnered with Suno. The big three forged licensing deals with AI music startup Klay, and joined forces with Spotify to address issues with AI usage. The concern from artist and songwriter communities is valid — almost all of the deals were announced in amorphous terms. Proof of concept is likely to come in 2026, when the products resulting from these partnerships are expected to launch.\n\t\n\n\t Big Questions for the Small Screen\n\n\tIn 2026 all eyes will be on what two powerful ex-Netflix execs do at their new homes: Paramount Skydance streaming chief Cindy Holland’s ultimate vision for Paramount+ should come into view. And new Amazon MGM Studios head of global TV Peter Friedlander will put his stamp on that company. Meanwhile, as Versant kicks off as a stand-alone company, keep an eye on what its networks might do in live TV and program acquisitions. In broadcast, the future of CBS News under Bari Weiss will be a top concern. In late night, what happens on CBS after “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” ends its run (our prediction: The Eye network expands its 11 p.m. local news to an hour) will soon be known. In development, a hot topic will be the microdrama business — and how it might be adapted to TV. And the unscripted world is focused on runaway productions as more series find it cheaper to ship contestants overseas. Then there’s the looming specter of Hollywood strikes with the guild contracts expiring.\n\n\t",

But there was no need for anyone to go cold turkey on live music these past 12 months — not when there were major tours from contemporary chart-toppers like Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Dua Lipa,  the Weeknd and the combination of Kendrick Lamar and SZA. Or victory laps from performers as high in the firmament of veterans as Oasis, Paul McCartney, the Who and Paul Simon. Or everything from the reteaming of Brandy and Monica on the arena circuit to Tyler Childers selling out the Bowl to L.A.’s all-star FireAid concerts. Here’s a look at 50 great shows that got us off our duffs and ecstatically into a new era in 2025.  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDavid Byrne at the Dolby Theatre, Hollywood, Nov. 20\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Emilio Herce\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWhatever innovations may go down in the concert business, it rarely feels like the wheel is being entirely reinvented — until you go to a David Byrne show. Fans going into his “Who Is the Sky” shows already had some idea of just how untethered to tour norms these concerts might be, based on the previous round of touring that was captured in the “American Utopia” documentary. But everything about his 2025 outing seemed ratcheted up to transport us somewhere that felt a lot more magical than any description you could possibly come up with for an intimate yet dazzling mixture of dance, rock and multi-media wizardry. The show’s seven musicians traveled about the stage with as much cordless choreography as the seven dancers, on a wrap-around LED set that was about as impressive in its transportable way as Las Vegas’ Sphere. It’s a tour that’s high-tech but even higher-human, with the troupe’s sounds and movement making every nerve ending you’ve got feel suddenly newly receptive to joy and possibility. The most common sentiment we heard in the lobby? “That was the best concert I’ve seen in years.” The tour resumes in North America in late March through mid-May; it’d be worth a plane flight and a scalped ticket to catch. —Chris Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBeyoncé at SoFi Stadium, Inglewood, Calif., April 28\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFor those who missed out on the “Renaissance” world tour (and its accompanying concert film, now a victim of lost media), Beyoncé didn’t entirely abandon its theatrics for her “Cowboy Carter” revue. Instead, she incorporated some of it into the broader world of her three-act opus, this time exploring the tropes and themes of country and Americana. The “Cowboy Carter” tour wasn’t just a spectacular (though it should be stated, it absolutely was), brimming with highly choreographed performances and hair-raising vocal runs; it was also a history lesson, a reinforcement of the care and research that Beyoncé brings to any one of her projects. At the tour’s opener in Los Angeles, Beyoncé debuted an experience with resonance, one that somehow raised the bar even higher. —Steven J. Horowitz\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLady Gaga at T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas, July 16\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Live Nation\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tLady Gaga debuted a maximal version of her “Mayhem Ball” show as a Coachella headliner in April, leaving some Little Monsters wondering what she had left in the creative tank for an arena tour of her seventh album. And the opening show at Vegas’ T-Mobile Arena may have shrunk the stage show, but lost none of the scope. For over two hours, Gaga grappled with the dichotomies of life and death, of light and darkness, whether it meant squaring off against the Gaga of her past or confronting the nature of celebrity as she writhed in a sandbox. By the end of the night, she had stripped away all the artifice and reemerged to take her final bow in a Cramps t-shirt and beanie — a reminder that Gaga will always be Gaga, no matter the context. —Horowitz\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCynthia Erivo and Adam Lambert in ‘Jesus Christ Superstar’ at the Hollywood Bowl, Aug. 3\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThere may never have been a better production of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice’s 55-year-old classic than the one put on to perfection for three nights this summer at the Hollywood Bowl. For once, Judas and Jesus were evenly matched, solving a problem that has often vexed a classic where the antagonist arguably gets a juicier role than the King of Kings. The fix for that: casting a queen among queens, Cynthia Erivo, as Christ. Her “Gethsemane” was the single most transfixing musical moment I saw on a stage in any context this year. But Adam Lambert, as God’s own foil, was no slouch, and not just because he appeared to be about 10 feet taller than Erivo. He was as born to wail “Heaven on Their Minds” as Judas was to take that bag of coinage, in this libretto’s take on tortured predestination. Further helping the show defy gravity: orchestrations and conducting from one of Erivo’s partners in “Wicked”-ness, Stephen Oremus. If only we could get a reprise of this practically fully staged “concert presentation” in 2026, this time with cameras set up to catch it for posterity. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRhiannon Giddens, Our Native Daughters and Steve Martin in ‘Rhiannon Giddens: American Tunes’ at the Hollywood Bowl, June 18\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThere was a T-shirt on sale at the Bowl’s merch booths for this show bearing words guaranteed to bring a laugh among the intended audience: “The Banjo: woke since the 1600s.” For years, Rhiannon Giddens has been on a not-quite-one-woman crusade to educate the world about the Black roots of her primary instrument, which came to America via the slave trade. It’s serious stuff, but she also has a sense of levity to go with the gravity of that mission. And so we got an all-star Bowl blowout, focused to a large extent on the pride of its contemporary Black practitioners, with an overdue reunion of Our Native Daughters, her banjo-picking supergroup with Allison Russell, Amythyst Kiah and Leyla McCalla. It also had Steve Martin as one of the featured guests, performing with and without recent bluegrass partner Alison Brown, interrupting his own expert picking with well-honed comedic material about how the banjo has been a source of shame for some of his fellow white people. In the entire history of the instrument, there may never again be a night as starry or wonderfully holistic as this delightful culmination of the banjo’s humble journey through the diaspora to the Hollywood hills.  —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPaul McCartney at the Bowery Ballroom, New York, Feb. 11\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: MJ Kim for MPL Communications Ltd.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIt arrived at noon, with no advance warning: “PAUL McCARTNEY ROCKS THE BOWERY 5:00 Doors 6:30 Showtime; Tickets on sale now only at Bowery Ballroom box office. First come, first served.” Yes, the ex-Beatle, who normally headlines arenas if not stadiums, would perform at one of New York’s most intimate venues that night. And for the 575-odd people who crammed into the building, it was a night worth screaming over. At 6:44 p.m. on the nose, the band — led by McCartney — walked onstage and launched straight into “A Hard Day’s Night,” soaring through a two-hour-ish career-spanning set, from 1963 (“From Me to You”) to his 1970s solo hits and even last year’s “final” Beatles song, “Now and Then.” In between were big crowd singalongs on “Hey Jude” and “Ob-la-di Ob-la-da,” romps through “Get Back,” “Jet” and “Got to Get You Into My Life”; deeper cuts like “Letting Go” and “Mrs. Vandebilt”; acoustic songs like “I’ve Just Seen a Face” and a solo “Blackbird.” McCartney was in strong voice — stronger than he was on “Saturday Night Live” 50 th anniversary show later in the week — and kept up a steady stream of banter with the audience throughout the show. “This has been a blast — we’ve looved it,” he said as the band left the stage, speaking for every lucky person in the room. —Jem Aswad\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKendrick Lamar and SZA at MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, NJ, May 8\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tA combo tour by two of the most vital artists working in the hip-hop/R&B realm is inevitably going to be both long and not long enough — when both artists can easily play two-hour-plus sets on their own, obviously you’re not going to hear every song you’d like. But Lamar and SZA both delivered in diminished circumstances (which were diminished even more by light rain and 55-ish degree temperatures), with the former bringing his full-size GNX car and a battery of dancers, and the latter bringing several props from her insect-themed latest tour and her own crew. Both leaned heavily on their latest albums but brought out classics like “King Kunta,” “Humble,” “DNA,” “Money Trees” and “Alright” (Lamar); “Love Galore,” “The Weekend,” “Broken Clocks” and even her song covered by Rihanna, “Consideration” (SZA); and of course several numbers performed together. Stadium shows are tough for any artist, but this formidable double bill delivered. —Jem Aswad\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Who at the Hollywood Bowl, Oct. 1\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Randall Michelson/Live Nation-Hewitt Silva\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAmong the album titles the band left untouched over the years was “Who’s Crying,” but that could have served as an unofficial name for the Who’s farewell tour, which had fans coming prepared for one final head-bang to “Substitute” and winding up unexpectedly weeping to “The Song Is Over.” These last shows provided a highly satisfactory answer to questions we might have had going in, like: Should they have turned in their badges just a tour or two sooner? Would Roger Daltrey still be able to hit the high notes at 81? Can Pete Townshend still athletically tilt at windmills at 80? Those issues fell by the wayside early in the Bowl performance, but the real bowling over came when they got to “Love, Reign O’er Me,” with Daltrey delivering those climactic howls as well and as cathartically as he ever did, against all odds. “That always fucking blows my mind, Rog,” said Townshend, in what felt like a spontaneous compliment. At the end, the two surviving mainstays lingered on stage; the song was over, but the banter wasn’t, quite. “It’s so ridiculous, doing this farewell tour,” Townshend said, “‘cause we’re still learning how to do the fucking thing.” “One day we’ll be good, really good,” promised Daltrey — even as they both swore that this really was it. We will get fooled again, but we won’t ever see these guys’ likes again. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDua Lipa at the Kia Forum, Inglewood, Calif., Oct. 8\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tOther recent pop outings like Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour may have bigger emotional dynamics, but when it comes to pure, unadulterated bliss, nothing delivers as constantly as the nonstop, highly energized morphine drip that is a Dua Lipa show. You already knew that, if you caught the barely-post-pandemic “Future Nostalgia” tour a few years ago, and if we don’t have quite as much pent-up frustration to exorcise now as we did then, her tour behind “Radical Optimism” still let us feel like we’ve been waiting years to exhale as contentedly as we could during these couple of hours of breezily choreographed fun and dames. Each night on her international outing had a geotargeted moment, and at the end of a week-long run at L.A.’s Forum, Lipa brought in no less a local than Gwen Stefani to duet on “Don’t Speak.” But there was no higher point than the steady stream of songs from the underrated “Radical Optimism,” presented with a crowd-pleasing spirit that made that album title feel not like Pollyanna-ism but a real, actual thing. —Willman\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGwen Stefani and Dua Lipa at the Kia Forum\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChris Willman/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHerb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass at the Dolby Theatre, Hollywood, Nov. 15\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tGoing to see Alpert on this tour involved coming to grips with some “wait a minute, what do you mean” issues. Like: Wait a minute, what do you mean Alpert hasn’t done a fully Tijuana Brass-themed tour since he and that group practically owned America in the 1960s? And wait a minute, what do you mean, Alpert is freaking 90? Honestly, this show would have been nearly as enjoyable even if Alpert had just come out as a figurehead and played or sung a few occasional bars while the newly assembled version of the Brass resumed where a previous crew left off more than a half-century ago. But he remains fully equipped to lead the charge, as the trumpeter anyone of a certain age recalls from their stereo consoles and TV tube sets, and as a raconteur able to tell just the right amount of stories about the days when his border-crossing pop instrumentals were in every home. A succession of film clips from yesteryear reinforced the vintage chic that made this tour surpass even whipped cream as a delight. He was already an ongoing contender for coolest guy alive, but deciding to resurrect the “Lonely Bull”/”Taste of Honey”/”Mexican Shuffle” era for our benefit in 2025 just about cinched it.

Yet the R&B singers, long rumored to be at odds, gave the people what they wanted at one of several Los Angeles stops on “The Boy Is Mine” trek. That meant trading off stage time to run through their extensive discographies and the dozens of hits between them, the type of performance where you’re reminded of just how impactful each artist has been over the decades. The fact that they did it together this many years into their careers — and at the highest level — made it all worth the wait. —Steven J.

The Wild Honey Foundation typically puts on one of these tribute shows every year to benefit autism causes, and their Zevon salute brought in a few of the man’s co-workers and contemporaries — namely, his original producer, Jackson Browne, and his most frequent co-writer, Jorge Calderon — as well as acolytes like Dwight Yoakam, Shooter Jennings and Fountains of Wayne. Billy Valentine’s extended take on “Accidentally Like a Martyr” as a soul song, alone, was worth the price of submission to these four hours of homage. Kudos to music directors Jordan Summers and Nick Vincent, the Johnnies that struck up the band. A month later, Zevon got inducted into the Rock Hall at last, but this felt like the real ceremony. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tChappell Roan with Elton John at the Elton John AIDS Foundation Oscar Viewing Party, West Hollywood, March 2\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris WIllman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tChappell Roan made Elton John an honorary member of the “Pink Pony Club,” placing a fringe-laden, pink cowboy hat upon his head as she dueted with the legend at his annual Oscar night party in West Hollywood, practically kitty-corner from the nightspot that inspired her signature song. Although Roan’s hour-long set with her all-female band included the most popular staples of her catalog, she celebrated the occasion with some value-added Elton content — starting with an earnest solo rendition of “Your Song.” Later, she called John himself up from his table to the stage, where they traded vocals as he played piano on “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me” before rounding the night out with a version of “Pink Pony Club” that had Elton enthusiastically joining in on vocals. Her rapt adoration as she gazed at him was touching, if not as sweet as the giddy glee that took over Elton when he got that hat. Seeing the music world’s eldest and youngest gay superheroes consummate a love affair on stage was a gas. —WIllman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTyler Childers at the Hollywood Bowl, June 10\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tTyler Childers made remarks more than once during his sold-out Hollywood Bowl debut that it was surprising that so many southern Californians would turn out to see a Kentucky hillbilly, or words to that effect. But most of us are past the point of being surprised now that a mass audience has taken to what could easily have been envisioned, within the wider expanse of popular entertainment, as niche. The straight country bits were wildly entertaining exercises in high-minded shit-kicking, but it was quickly apparent why he holds such appeal for fans of singer-songwriters or jam bands. Things really took a turn during the closing minutes of the Bowl show, when a Hare Krishna devotional chant was followed by a rare, one-time performance of one of his most famous songs, “Long Violent History,” in what seemed to be a nod to the “no kings” protests happening that week. He’s one complicated holler-dweller. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOasis at the Rose Bowl, Pasadena, Sept. 7\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Rich Polk for Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIt would be hard to overstate just how much emotion a majority of the capacity crowd for Oasis’ two Rose Bowl shows had invested in this resurrection. Thinking back on some of the other acts who have headlined the venue over the years, it was as if the Rolling Stones, ‘N Sync and Billy Graham somehow all joined forces and came back to lead an ecstatically cultish mass-scale rock ‘n’ roll ceremony, reaffirming for the elders in the audience that they are not nearly dead, and initiating the younger enthusiasts in a kind of Britpop bar-or-bat mitzvah. Near the end of their two-hour performance, Noel Gallagher had the visuals team train a camera on a young woman in the front whom he said had been weeping throughout the whole show, and indeed, she looked like she’d been directly transported from the Ed Sullivan Theatre in 1964 to this spot. Looking around at the tens of thousands of other punters, there was no shortage of similar rapture, if not occasional tears. If this stuff tended to get written off back in the ‘90s as phony Beatlemania, it certainly hasn’t bitten the dust. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHalsey at the Hollywood Bowl, May 14\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tHalsey’s “For My Last Trick” Tour was one of this year’s most impressive pop road shows — and really two tours in one, joined at the hip. The first half of the show was a highly stylized succession of Broadway-style setpieces, with drastic changes in scenery, costuming and choreography from one production number to the next, plus lots of filmed content, in the tradition of elaborately theatrical tours by Taylor Swift or Madonna. But in the second half, Halsey delivered a straight-up rock ‘n’ roll show, offering highly charged versions of her greatest hits with a smoking band and hardly anything in the way of unnecessary adornment. Whether you favor an elaborately designed conceptual show or a back-to-basics, club-worthy concert, Halsey was able to offer a canny combination of both. We actually reviewed her in three different swings in SoCal this year, as she returned in the summer to do a tour-closing free-for-all show at the Yamavaa’ resort, then brought a “Badlands” 10th anniversary tour to Hollywood Forever in the fall. At all three shows, it was clear Halsey is as good of a young rock star as we’ve got going right now.  —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKamasi Washington in ‘Harmony of Difference’ at the L.A.

But for an opening attraction, the museum’s overseers could not have picked anything less polarizing than Kamasi Washington‘s three-night stand, which unfolded in the still-empty gallery spaces — an epic-scale performance by more than a hundred musicians that came off as the symphonic-jazz equivalent of a home run. The new David Geffen Galleries, which will not open for art exhibition purposes until April 2026, encompass 110,000 square feet, and nearly all that expanse was filled with the sound of music during Washington’s 90-minute sets. There were 10 different staging areas for different groups of musicians from one end of the amoeba-shaped structure to the other, all performing elements of “Harmony of Difference,” an existing suite that the saxophonist-composer expanded for this hyper-unusual live premiere. Attendees were encouraged to walk around and hear overlapping variations on the same pieces being simultaneously performed by a choir, two string sections, a woodwinds section, a brass section and four other full jazz septets on top of the one that included the composer himself. A stunt? Absolutely. A stunt that happened to work as a gorgeous, experiential tapestry? That, too.  —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWillie Nelson and Bob Dylan at the Hollywood Bowl, May 16\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tNot to make this into some kind of AARP tract, but: Are there any figures in American music more inspirational than these two? It was true when they were still mere sprouts of, like, 64 and 72, but all the more so now that they are seriously defying gravity at 84 (for Dylan) and 92 (for Nelson). They played the Hollywood Bowl as a stop on their Outlaw Music Festival tour, just as they had the summer before. They may count as half of a living Mount Rushmore of music, but they are not up there just as the objects of your national-monument tourist gaze: They are embracing the spirit of each night’s moment in an accomplished and downright frisky way that most younger achievers can only aspire toward. (Although, to give credit where it’s due, most of the younger acts they’ve picked as openers, like Billy Strings and Sierra Hull at the Bowl, seem like the type of kids who can and will absorb these lessons.) Dylan is still rearranging his classics, but in a fashion that seems particularly crowd-pleasing now — you’ll enjoy that your favorite song of his suddenly sounds more like a Dire Straits or Johnny Cash classic. Willie doesn’t mess with the material much, of course, but that doesn’t make his ability to pull off transcendent acoustic guitar solos any less absorbing. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDead & Company in ‘Dead Forever’ at Sphere, Las Vegas, March 20\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAs Dead & Company returned to Sin City for a second residency, the question on the minds of many fans was, of course, what, if anything, had been updated for 2025 after a groundbreaking run in the world’s most advanced concert venue the summer before? The answer was: just enough to still make Sphere seem as fresh as it ought to, without reinventing the orb. The video design of the ’25 show still followed much the same template as ’24, with the same spectacular bookends (from Haight-Ashbury to deep space and back again) and a return of some of those favorite visualizer setpieces … but with maybe 30-40% new eye candy… a refresh, but far from a total reset. On a given evening, you might be privy to a fun, giant-sized reenactment of the Grateful Dead’s “Mars Hotel” album cover, or a skeletal Uncle Sam’s motorcycle trip to the Vegas Strip. But the core of the show remains the American beauty of the band’s music. That goes for John Mayer’s graceful, alternating duels with Bob Weir and pianist Jeff Chimenti, and it goes for percussionist Mickey Hart’s nightly drum solo, which now, with mind- and butt-bending haptics in the seats, counts as one of the greatest live experiences you could have, even apart from the rest of the show. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHaim at the Santa Barbara Bowl, Oct. 11\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tHaim‘s tour finale at the Santa Barbara Bowl was full of reassurances. First of all, it was good to see for certain that Alana Haim’s head looks just fine, and completely intact, after her recent appearance in an Oscar-contender film led to a bad end for her minor character. Secondly, the band is sounding better than fine. The only squib marks left on anyone were on the almost 5,000 patrons who braved one of the most refreshingly moderate ocean breezes California has to offer to see maybe still the best homegrown group California has had to offer in any recent year. To paraphrase their frequent partner in crime, Paul Thomas Anderson: One banger after another! Seriously. The “I Quit” tour’s simple but smart production design included a ticker that mostly flashed “I quit” messages relating to the songs about to be performed, or to positive meanings that could be drawn out of such a negative-sounding phrase. Like: “I quit apologizing.” “I quit regret.” “I quit bad kissers.” “I quit envy.” “I quit saying I’m okay.” “I quit your shit.”  (And, on the wittier side, “I quit clothing,” right before Danielle sang “All Over Me,” the band’s lustiest song.) The only thing audience members had to be resigned to, meanwhile, was sheer pleasure. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Weeknd at SoFi Stadium, Inglewood, Calif., June 29\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tPart of what makes the Weeknd such an enduring force is that he has a sound that’s specifically his own — line up the parade of hits he’s had over the past decade and he’s a reliable throughline. The Weeknd is such a gifted performer that he absorbs every sound and song into his orbit, accentuated by the theatrics he stages around it. At one of the four stops on his “After Hours Til Dawn” show, which has been going since 2022, he created a demonic world rife with blasts of fire, shrouded dancers and a larger-than-life golden statue that centered the whole show. At the start of his career, the Weeknd was subsumed in mystery, his identity largely kept a secret. Years later, seeing him in plain sight as he led a maximalist spectacle only proved that showmanship can captivate at any scale. —Horowitz\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCarly Rae Jepsen at the Troubadour, West Hollywood, Aug. 19\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFor one night only, fans lucky enough to snag a ticket to the 10th anniversary show of Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Emotion” got to experience the high highs and emotional depths of her definitive album. The singer delivered a spot-on, beginning-to-end performance of the record that elevated her from one-hit-wonderdom to pop auteur. Jepsen was joyous and jubilant as she revisited songs like “Run Away With Me” and “Boy Problems,” keeping the arrangements simple and the theatrics light. It was an ephemeral celebration of an album that has since grown canonical roots, and hasn’t lost any of its charm. —Horowitz\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAl Jardine & the Pet Sounds Band at the Cerritos Center, Nov. 23\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe story of the Beach Boys is a story of family, obviously, in all its ups and downs. As a latter-day corollary to that, anyone who went to see Brian Wilson’s “solo” shows over his last quarter-century of performing couldn’t help but notice that a chosen family had built up in his inner musical circle — one that put on a fantastic show and supported him even when he was being most affected by his physical and psychological issues. It felt like it would be a shame if that band fell apart after Wilson’s death… but, like family, it is carrying on. And carrying on gloriously, as a matter of fact, with fellow Beach Boy Al Jardine now stepping up as their jovial and capable leader, if just one of several guys carrying out those lead vocals every night. What is now being dubbed “the Pet Sounds Band” isn’t just keeping the legacy alive for its own sake; they are brilliantly keeping those arrangements alive into the future, just like a good symphony orchestra would do with a classical repertoire. Maybe Daddy never has to take the T-bird away after all.

Like, I’m gonna influence the fuck out of you tonight,” he promised. The crowd at McCabe’s could consider itself properly influenced. For his first tour in 19 years, Burnett picked places to play that count as proper listening rooms, even if the size of the venues didn’t provide the supply to meet all the demand for his return. With guitarist Colin Linden, fiddler-mandolinist David Mansfield and bassist Dennis Crouch in tow, Burnett strung us along with repartee and wisdom in a parlor performance that just happened to feature the greatest string band in the world. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPaul Simon at Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, July 9\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tPaul Simon wrapped up his official farewell tour seven years ago. There was reason to believe he had valid reasons for marking that as his real goodbye to road shows, and not as the kind of fake-out retirement that so many performers cash in on and then renege on. But he has found solutions to the issues that might have kept him off-stage. On his 2025 “Quiet Celebration” outing, he was sounding… yes, softer (as promised in the tour title!) but, really, undiminished. We’ve never had a better reason to be glad someone went back on their word. The tour’s name didn’t mean it was an all-acoustic outing, although that was the tone of the first half, when Simon and his band played back his most recent album, “Seven Psalms,” front to back. In the second act and encores, we got 15 catalog selections, including some tunes that count as rabble-rousers by Simon standards; the evening did turn into a party, despite his best intentions to keep it down. He sounded like an 83-year-old choirboy, and how fortunate were we to unexpectedly get to share his sanctuary again? —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLucy Dacus at the Ryman Auditorium, Nashville, Tenn., April 28\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tLucy Dacus has a voice that just feels like home, in some comforting and abiding way, even when she’s addressing uncomfortable truths. And so it makes sense that the set design for her “Forever Is a Feeling Tour” has some elegantly homey aspects to it, from the giant throw rug she sings from to the actual couch that is brought out for a more acoustic segment of the show. Behind Dacus and her band is a backdrop of picture frames that sometimes displayed ambitious art pieces, as if we were in a gallery, and sometimes endearing illustrations of the musicians, as if we were just in her living room. Naturally, Dacus played a lot of her prior solo material, plus her most masterful Boygenius contribution, “True Blue.” But it was the unabashedly open-to-love moments from her latest album that left the most touching impression. Extra points at the show we caught in Nashville for using that couch segment to bring out fellow indie-pop queer icon Joy Oladokun for “Bullseye,” a duet that really did hit it. —WIllman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJason Isbell at the Henry J.

Some fans or critics have made the point of saying “Foxes in the Snow” is Isbell’s “Nebraska” equivalent, but one crucial difference is how much finger-picking goodness this expert lead guitarist brings to his acoustic playing, versus the more elementary strumming of a Springsteen. So even if you’re a fan of the 400 Unit sound (as presumably every extant devotee of his is), this solo tour felt like optimal Isbell, with the clarity of music and lyrics that the honed-down, zoned-in solo format allowed. —WIllman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJesse Welles at the Troubadour, West Hollywood, March 28\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThey don’t really make folk heroes any more — as in, you know, heroes who play folk music. So, despite occasional promises of another Great Folk Scare, Jesse Welles is close to being a one-man phenomenon right now. And he’s up to the task, judging from this galvanizing show at the Troubadour, where the venerable club name really fit for once. He performed the first three-quarters of this tour stop stop solo-acoustic, then was joined by two musicians to form an electric power trio for the last fourth, before going it alone again for the encore. By now you probably at least know that he’s become an online sensation for his topical songs, like a Dylan who never felt trapped by the pressure to keep speaking to the moment. And his words pour out in torrents — how does he get through a gig like the Troubadour’s without a prompter for those thousands of quickly spun lines? Biting irony meets better brain chemistry in Welles, one of the most exciting additions to the pantheon of obvious career artists who are just getting started. —WIllman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLainey Wilson at the Kia Forum, Inglewood, Calif., Aug. 23\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWilson got the CMAs’ top Entertainer of the Year prize yet again in 2025, after being given the year off the previous year, and it’s hard to imagine they won’t keep giving it to her again and again, she so exemplifies every stated and unstated criterion for the trophy. At the Forum, she was well into the first of what will certainly be many, many arena tours, looking and sounding like she’d already been headlining at that level for as long as she’s been alive. The Dolly comparisons might seem tiresome, but they’re worthy — the swaggering rockers and the glitz of her rhinestone-cowgirl outfits are never going to outshine the homespun brilliance that really comes to the fore when she does an acoustic segment. Extra credit on this tour for bringing along Kaitlyn Butts as her opening act, and onto her stage during the headlining set, as rare proof that in star-level mainstream country as well as elsewhere, sisters can be doing it for themselves. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAllison Russell at the Belasco, Los Angeles, May 20\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIn the parlance of Van Morrison, an Allison Russell show is a true “did ye get healed?” experience. Just as much as it’s a concert, her performance feels like an activation… in the old-school, spiritual sense. There was a bonus to the delayed gratification of this tour, which was originally set to begin in 2023, before she took on an unexpected Broadway role: She brought “Hadestown” with her. That’s literally, in how she closed the show with a cover of that production’s “We Raise Her Cups.” But it’s also in the sense of how much she seems to have grown physically as a performer through her short but sure turn on Broadway. Taking a rooting interest in Russell almost feels bigger than investing in just one artist, when she represents the best of what music could be and sometimes is, with that stunning voice as a trigger for righteous anger, empathy, self-understanding and forgiveness. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCharlie Puth at Blue Note, Hollywood, Oct. 16\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAmong his pop peers, Charlie Puth is certainly one of the most studied and technically proficient musicians in his graduating class. He made sure to put those skills to the proper test at the beginning of his Los Angeles residency at the recently opened Blue Note, where he staged eight shows across four nights this past fall. Throughout the 75-minute set, he revisited some of his biggest hits — “Attention,” “See You Again” — and reframed them in a jazz context, melting the often rigid boundaries of pop structure and making for a loose yet altogether precise performance. —Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCynthia Erivo at the Plaza Theatre, Palm Springs, Dec. 1\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Tara Howard\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFinding the ideal artist to reopen the historic Plaza Theatre in Palm Springs might have seemed like a tall order, at least if the 89-year-old venue’s new operators wanted to touch every possible important base for a refurbishment-celebrating gala. Someone whose concert repertoire touches on vast decades of musical and show-biz history, but who also happens to be utterly and unmistakably of the moment? An acclaimed classicist of sorts, and, by the way, a current superstar? There is really only one needle in that haystack, and they got her: Cynthia Erivo. In a night focused mostly on standards, the “Wicked” singer-actress got in plenty of time with the full brassiness of the 20-piece-plus Palm Springs Pops Orchestra but also doing numbers that stripped things down to a four-piece jazz combo or even just piano accompaniment. It was a show that felt epic or quietly in-your-face from moment to moment, exactly the dynamic range you’d expect from the Erivo you already know from the big screen. She didn’t just settle for songs like “At Last,” in any case, though she could nail that; she and her pianist also pulled out surprises like an 11-minute jazz improvisation that stunned the house. The world outside of Palm Springs should be so lucky as to get a full tour of this, but Erivo is off to play Dracula in London. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t‘What the World Needs Now: The Burt Bacharach Songbook Live in Concert’ at the Wiltern, Los Angeles, March 23\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris WIllman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSo, you say you like melodies? A bit of manna from a more euphonious heaven arrived this spring in the form of “What the World Needs Now: The Burt Bacharach Songbook Live in Concert,” a multi-artist outing that couldn’t have been better-cast, with Todd Rundgren as perhaps the only true marquee attraction but plenty of other voices who do the catalog just as much justice. And it was especially solidly anchored, with Bacharach’s longtime music director/conductor, Rob Shirakbari, making sure that everything sounded exactly as you’d hope, even with a fairly modest lineup of nine players and/or singers on most nights. Rundgren’s vaunted Philly-soul side was appropriate for the many ballads he fronted. But two leading ladies also killed it: Wendy Moten sounded like she was Dionne Warwick, almost as much as Tori Holub was a live ringer for Karen Carpenter. Every great pop composer should get a tribute this expert and adoring, even if few would deserve it this much. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMaggie Rose and the Secret Sisters at the Schermerhorn Center, Nashville, Sept. 9\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSome performers’ repertoires lend themselves to an orchestral treatment better than others, and these two country-adjacent-but-not-really-country artists could not have been better suited to a night with the Nashville Symphony. Maggie Rose spent the year further coming into her own, no longer Nashville’s best-kept secret, as she shared stages with jam bands and even appeared at the MusiCares salute to the Grateful Dead with friend Jim James. But it’s her own music that most deserves the spotlight, whether it’s the more solemn material of her “No One Gets Out Alive” album or her alternately sprightly and feisty new EP, “Cocoon.” To know her is to be knocked out by her, and the orchestra didn’t overpower her but rather offered a majestic turbo boost. Her encore segment with the Secret Sisters, harmonizing on “I Can’t Make You Love Me,” made you wish they could take this trio act on the road. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRobert Glasper at the Blue Note, Hollywood, Dec. 18\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe new Blue Note club in Los Angeles would merit its existence if for no other purpose than to serve as an occasional landing spot for a few nights’ worth of investor Robert Glasper. The jazz world in L.A. can not, or at least should not, survive on the Catalina alone, and having a new room with vibe and international pedigree to spare may count as one of the most significant cultural developments in the city in 2025. Glasper brought up the rear of the year with a multi-night stand that included the kind of guest appearances only he could draw, from Stevie Wonder to, on the night that we stepped in, the inestimable Lalah Hathaway and a show-ending set-within-a-set by Lupe Fiasco. But Glasper and band would have been worth the cost of admission even if it was just his comic banter making a cameo appearance. On the night I attended, I was practically ready to go home after Isaiah Sharkey turned in one of the most intense electric guitar solos I’ve ever heard in my lifetime; with Lalah up next, I was of course happy not to have been so hasty. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tShania Twain and Brandi Carlile at Girls Just Wanna Weekend, Riviera Maya, Mexico, Jan. 17\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWhen titans of music meet on stage, it tends to be pretty scripted, or at least rehearsed. And the meeting of Twain and Carlile at the latter’s annual Girls Just Wanna Weekend festival in Mexico was planned out, up to a point, with Shania bringing Brandi out midway through her headlining set for a mutual lovefest that included harmonizing on “Can’t Help Falling in Love” and “From This Moment On.” But what is undervalued about Twain is just how loose she can be as a performer, which usually evidences itself only in her interplay with audience members. Having one of her own current musical heroines join her on stage, Twain was determined not to waste This Moment, adding an impromptu duet of “I Will Always Love You” before landing the plane with “Party for Two.” What a delight, at this nearly all-women festival, to celebrate two female icons getting their pop-country freak on together.  —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tIvan Cornejo at the Kia Forum, Inglewood, June 29\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tBy the time Ivan Cornejo signed his first major-label record deal with Interscope at the age of 19, (the result of a bidding war), .the música mexicana artist and Southern California native was already known as a defining voice for Gen Z Latinos, thanks to his emotive songwriting and unique blend of regional Mexican and alternative rock music. When he appeared at the Kia Forum for two nights to play material from his Billboard 200-charting (No. 17) “Mirada” album, Cornejo signaled some of influences with a pre-concert playlist that included Billie Eilish, the Marias and Tame Impala, along with nostalgic classics like Bobby Pulido’s 1995 hit “Desvelado.” You wouldn’t necessarily identify Cornejo as a rock star, but there are certainly commonalities. He left a lot of room for solos and power chords from the electric guitar, which is at the core of his three-album catalog. You can easily recognize a song is his by the twangy inflection of his voice. A defining quality of the best música mexicana artists is their ability to sing clean register breaks with a whining tone and with great force — Cornejo is no different. The night went without long speeches but he did take the time to address his L.A. fans directly, emphasizing the importance of community and to “stay strong during these rough times.” —Thania Garcia\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGillian Welch & David Rawlings at the Wiltern, Los Angeles, March 7\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAre we in a golden age for acoustic music? You’d just about have to think so, if you saw Jason Isbell’s solo tour this spring, or the outing from Welch and Rawlings. More than six months into touring behind their excellent 2024 joint effort, “Woodland,” their Wiltern show was a reminder not just of what an influence they’ve surely been on someone like Isbell, but how they remain the unshakable queen and king of folk or folk-adjacent music. Of course, while Isbell and some of their other contemporaries might dip their toes in and out of a purely acoustic mode, Welch and Rawlings have been keeping it quiet for close to 30 years now. Every once in a while, they threaten to go electric, but thankfully, it never quite seems to completely take. The mystery in the timeless tales they tell generally does work best on a lower boil, even as nothing electrifies quite like Rawlings’ 1935 Epiphone, when he really lets his fingers do the amplifying. For an encore, the L.A. audience got a pretty rare bonus: their fantastic version of the Jefferson Airplane’s “White Rabbit,” which turned the dynamic duo from Deadheads into Feed-Your-Head-heads for a few minutes. —WIllman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJon Batiste at Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, May 19\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJon Batiste is renowned as a band leader; that goes without saying when that was his literal job description for years on the Colbert show. But he might be even better as a one-man band. He has done a handful of solo shows in what are normally symphonic settings in support of his 2024 album “Beethoven Blues (Batiste Piano Series, Vol. 1),” and this was the musical polymath at his very best, with no backing band to funk up the proceedings, and not even allowing himself any between-song commentary to let his force-of-personality take over. (Not to worry, his frequent grin still does some audience gladhanding.) His epic opening number, “Symphony No. 5 Stomp,” lasts less than two minutes on record, but was expanded out to about 10 times that in concert — a tour de force of classical, jazz and even discordant sounds melded together in such exhaustingly improvisational fashion that it felt like a concert unto itself. It did go on — and he did bust out the melodica, as well as the human voice, for some of his trademark material — but we’ll never forget how he flipped a lid on Ludwig. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Go-Go’s at the Roxy, West Hollywood, April 9\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“We’re all holding up pretty good, huh?” asked Charlotte Caffey early into the Go-Go’s’ performance Wednesday night at the Roxy, where the full, founding fivesome was playing a public show together for the first time in more than seven years. It was unclear whether she was just referring to the band members, or to the more collective us, which included a good amount of O.G. fans. But the short answer either way was: Good God, yes! That certainly went for the band, sounding as good as they ever have, and went for the part of the audience that’s been along for the ride, too. To hear vintage girl-power anthems like “Skidmarks on My Heart” and “How Much More” performed this muscularly at this late date was to feel… upheld. (And not just because the packed-beyond-capacity crowd at the way-oversold Roxy didn’t allow an inch of space for slouching.) This was the start of a practice run for their Coachella shows, but the best possible way to recapture the glory was by leaving a skid mark in WeHo on the way to Indio. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tA Salute to the Grateful Dead, MusiCares’ Person of the Year Gala at the L.A.

Be careful what you don’t wish for: Weir is still out there 60 years later slugging it out — happily, as far as anyone can tell — with the offshoot group Dead & Company, whose mini-set climaxed this black-tie-optional evening downtown. Their performance followed tribute segments by artists as varied as Noah Kahan, Billy Strings, Vampire Weekend, the War on Drugs and Maren Morris, in front of a house band assembled by Don Was. Many of these were memorable, but John Mayer turned in what was easily the night’s most riveting performance — a nearly 12-minute version of “Terrapin Station,” performed in acoustic trio format on the B-stage, with the kind of solos that further proved that Mayer was the best and only pick to fill Jerry Garcia’s shoes in any fashion. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMegan Moroney at the Greek, Los Angeles, Oct. 3\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe last time Megan Moroney headlined in L.A., she kept remarking, it had been at the 500-capacity Troubadour, and now, two years later, she was filling the 5,900-seat Greek two nights in a row. With demand to spare: Tickets on resale sites for the two shows in the weeks leading up to the shows weren’t going for much less than $300, even in the cheap seats. This was a leap for Moroney that counted as, locally, at least, a coronation. Probably the last time we heard a womanly roar this loud and this sustained during a concert there was when Olivia Rodrigo made her first headlining appearance there. On this night, aside from when Moroney slipped in a Brooks & Dunn cover most of the crowd was too young to know, nearly every word was sung along with at top volume, as if this were a slimmed-down version of the Eras Tour in which Taylor’s country era was still the only era. It’s no surprise that Moroney is making a quick return to L.A. in early 2026, this time at the Crypto Arena. Bring your earplugs, not for what will be coming out of the PA, but for just how reliably the crowd can be counted on to shout back clever rhymes that speak directly to them. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tYola at the El Rey, Los Angeles, June 12\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris WIllman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFrom Post Malone to Lana Del Rey, sometimes it can seem like the whole world is going Americana, if not country. Yola is headed the opposite direction, and that’s actually pretty wonderful. The Bristol-born singer made a huge impact in 2019 with the decidedly Americana-leaning album “Walk Through Fire,” but wasn’t been singing any of the material from that on her current tour, instead focusing on her recent EP, “My Way,” which introduces a marked change of direction. The nightly covers really show where her heart’s at: Anita Baker’s “Sweet Love,” Yarbrough & People’s “Don’t Stop the Music,” Rene & Angela’s “I’ll Be Good,” Prince’s “Let’s Go Crazy”… In short, the European import who was introduced to us skewing toward American roots music was making it clear that some of her truest roots are in R&B, where she can find the most proper setting for her inner and outer Tina. On top of that, nobody’s a more entertaining between-song storyteller. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRobert Plant at the United Theater, Los Angeles, Nov. 22\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tRobert Plant likes to share. He proved it with his two albums in tandem with Alison Krauss, he proved it before that by inviting Sandy Dennis onto a Zeppelin track, and now he’s doing it again with an album and subsequent tour where even the marquee gives equal billing to his band Saving Grace and co-lead singer Suzi Dian. There’s no doubt he’s the commander in chief on these shows, but he has too great a sense of music history as well as British decorum to do anything but promote the fact that this latest folk-rock discursion is a village effort. You know there’s a segment of the audience that would love a bit more than the taste of the classic catalog he gives them, yet there’s no sense that anyone leaves these vastly satisfying shows hungry. There’s no greatness like modest greatness… Also, extra credit for indulging his love of rockabilly by bringing L.A. veteran Rosie Flores along as opening act.

But there was nothing stripped-down when Wet Leg took to the stage for one of the museum’s last programs of the year. They put on pretty much an abbreviated version of the show they’d done at the Greek a couple months earlier; I’m not sure they even turned the volume level down from 1100, in making the transition. And it was a glorious thing, even if there had never been such a comical sight at the home of the Recording Academy than 200 attendees all simultaneously reaching into their pockets or purses to search for something to stick in their ears. The best part was having the performance preceded by a Q&A — conducted by “KPop” singer Audrey Nuna — in which Rhian Teasdale came off as the most soft-spoken, unassuming singer in the world. Watching her suddenly transform into a roaring lion was a glee-stirring example of just what a magic trick music can be. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t‘Jillith Fair: A Tribute to Jill Sobule’ at McCabe’s, Santa Monica, June 1\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIn some ways, among musicians whose catalogs are not chock-full of universally recognizable hits, Jill Sobule‘s catalog is exceptionally well-suited for a tribute show. The late singer-songwriter’s songs are universally clever, vivid, high-concept, direct, usually (but not always) funny and instantly relatable. The truth of just how instantly her material comes across in any setting was born out when McCabe’s produced the first in a series of nationwide celebrations of her music legacy, just one month after her tragic passing. (A second, equally good L.A. tribute was held at Largo a month after this one with an entirely different cast.) A superb lineup included Dan Navarro, Willie Aron, Cindy Lee Berryhill, Steve Postell, Amy Engelhardt, Perla Batalla, Jesse Lynn Madera, Lisa Loeb and Tom Morello. But among the biggest standouts were Kay Hanley and Michelle Lewis, who covered Sobule’s last song — which managed to be one of her most notorious — “JD Vance Is a Cunt,” and Margaret Cho, who found just the proper mixture of comedy and pathos in the classic unrequited-love lament “Mexican Wrestler.” Which is not to say that the real star of the night sang at all; that would have to be “I Kissed a Girl” video star Fabio, who sweetly came out just to say that his heart, like all of ours, was broken. —Chris Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNathy Peluso at the Novo, Los Angeles, March 15\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: @individuaph\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDowntown L.A.’s Novo transformed into a portal of opulence for Argentine singer-songwriter Nathy Peluso, who made the most of this space, and very clearly demanded more of it. In a nearly two-hour showcase, Peluso nimbly maneuvered from genre to genre, with no limit on the number of twists: poignant power ballads, razor-sharp raps and salsa sequences with elements of Brazilian funk, EDM and bachata scattered throughout. The setlist reflected the best of her catalog but placed a shining light on “Grasa,” Peluso’s 16-song LP that won three Latin Grammys last year. Peluso airly pranced across the stage during the salsa portions of the evening for songs like “Mafiosa,” “Puro Veneno” and “La Presa,” with the latter featuring a theatrical delivery from Peluso calling out to la policia and dancing against a makeshift cage. Peluso followed these red-hot moments with emotional shifts. Before you know it, she’s on the floor, her body sloped across the carpeted steps of her stage design. And all throughout, her vocals never flounder — her vibrato is as honeyed and robust as it is on the floor as when she’s standing upright, nor does it tremble when her hips sway to “Erotika,” a lavish and erotic salsa reminiscent of the genre’s ’90s classics. For Peluso, who sings and dances and acts with a palpable swagger, it seemed she was completely engrossed in a colorful world of her own making, and was overjoyed by having us watch. —Garcia\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAmericanaFest’s Tribute to John Hiatt at the Troubadour, West Hollywood, Feb. 1\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Let’s go to WeHo in the meantime” doesn’t have the same ring to it, but legendary singer-songwriter and longtime Tennessean resident John Hiatt returned to his old haunts in L.A. to be serenaded by a parade of boldface admirers at the Americana Music Association’s annual Grammy eve salute to a legend. The combination of classic material and an A-list of artists from multiple generations would have been enough to melt anyone’s icy blue heart. At this late date, you might think you don’t need to hear one more person cover his “Have a Little Faith in Me,” but that would have been before you heard Michael McDonald do a spectacular version of it at this event that made it seem brand new again; his gospel rendition really did turn it into a faith-based ballad. Other highlights included turns by I’m With Her, Little Feat, Cedric Burnside, Joe Henry, Robbie Fulks, Joe Bonamassa, Tom Morello (yes, he solos with his teeth even when he’s covering Hiatt), Shemekia Copeland, Maggie Rose, Lyle Lovett, Milk Carton Kids, Los Lobos, Brandy Clark (pictured above) and more. You could call it a murderer’s row that the AMA is able to round up for these L.A. tribute shows each Grammy season, or you could say that, in this case, they brought the family. —Willman\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZach Bryan Marries Girlfriend Samantha Leonard in Private Ceremony\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBeyoncé Is Officially a Billionaire\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow Facial Recognition Tech Took Over U.S. Sporting Events\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStyle Icon and Philanthropist Countess Jacqueline de Ribes Dies at 96\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Watkins was charged with armed robbery, grand theft, criminal mischief, and exposure of sexual organs.\n      \n    \n          Florida man strikes again!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Explains\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

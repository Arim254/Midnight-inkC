    "body": "\n\tIn the documentary “Holding Liat,” director Brandon Kramer follows elderly American Israeli couple, Yehuda and Chaya Beinin, as they fight for the release of their 49-year-old daughter, Liat Beinin Atzili, and her husband, Aviv, who were kidnapped and taken into captivity in Gaza after the October 7 attacks.\n\n\tThe film, which won the top nonfiction prize at the Berlin Film Festival earlier this year, follows the kibbutznik couple, originally from New Jersey, as they navigate bringing their daughter and son-in-law home while also contending with the Israeli government’s handling of the crisis, their hopes for peace and a two-state solution, and Yehuda’s criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\t\n\n\t“Bibi understands what every right-wing politician understands: never to waste an opportunity to serve your agenda,” Yehuda Beinin tells his other daughter, Tal, who, in the doc, joins him in Washington, D.C., to lobby Congress and ask then-President Biden for help. Upon his arrival in the U.S., Beinin can’t hide his disgust for the pro-Zionist propaganda being spewed at nationalistic rallies.\n\n\n\t“This is bullshit,” he fumes, before storming out of a 2023 MAGA convention.\n\n\tTwo months into the ordeal, Kramer documents Atzili’s release from captivity and her husband’s burial.\n\n\tEarlier this week Variety spoke to Kramer and Atzili, who currently resides in Israel with her three children, about the documentary and the recent release of the remaining Israeli hostages.\n\t\n\t\tLiat, how are you feeling since the release of the hostages?\t\n\n\tAtzili: It’s amazing to see the living hostages coming home. It’s a huge relief to see that. I’ve been saying all along that after a war of this scale we can’t have things go back to what they were. [The hostage release] is a game-changer, and things will be different, and I’m hopeful that they will be better.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSo, you do believe that this war is over?\t\n\n\tAtzili: For the most part, yes.\n\t\n\t\tBrandon, in the documentary Liat’s father says things about the Israeli government and about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that are not favorable. Are you worried about his safety?\t\n\n\tKramer: A big part of making this film has been pushing through fear. This is not a film about the entirety of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, or even October 7th, or even the hostages. This is a film about one family, and that’s the frame. As we were editing the film, we would feel fear around showing certain things that people feel in the film because it was too controversial, or because it might upset this person or this audience member. We would have these rough cuts, and you could tell where we edited out of fear. Part of the process of editing this film over a year was blushing those fears out and having the restraint to stay true to the different lived experiences that the family had.\n\t\n\t\tThe doc makes it clear that in Israel Netanyahu is not universally liked, while in the U.S. not liking Netanyahu can be seen as anti-Israel. Why do you think that is?\t\n\n\tKramer: In my opinion, there is a false expectation that you need to pick a side where your empathy lies. If you feel that the devastation that is happening in Gaza is absolutely horrific, then for you to acknowledge that the pain that Liat and her family went through is a betrayal of that empathy that you are having for Palestinians, or vice versa. If you have been living in your heart with this feeling of deep empathy for the Israeli victims and the hostages, acknowledging that tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed and that the children have been starved is a betrayal of that grief. Liat spent 54 days in captivity, and her husband was killed. She came out and immediately said, ‘I don’t want a single person in Gaza to be harmed or killed in retribution for what happened to my family.’ So, I think Liat is modeling how it’s not a choice between having empathy for one side or the other. You can have empathy for all people who are affected by this conflict.\n\n\tAtzili: It has been one of our goals to put forward a message that being pro-Israel doesn’t necessarily mean being anti-Palestine and vice versa. There is a conflict, and people on both sides are being hurt terribly by it. That’s why we have to work together to solve it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe film has screened all over the world, including in Tel Aviv and most recently at the Hamptons Film Festival. The conflict is especially polarizing in the U.S. How have audiences responded?\t\n\n\tKramer: What happens is that at the end of the screening, people are having conversations that they have never had before. It’s  breaking a paralysis in dialogue around this conflict. I think a majority of people actually just have empathy and don’t want people to be suffering. I’m hopeful that the distributors will catch on to that and see that. We have had a lot of success all across Europe and the rest of the world.\n\t\n\t\t“Holding Lait” follows in the footsteps of “No Other Land,” which claimed the Berlinale’s top doc honor in 2024 but despite winning an Academy Award earlier this year, never found mainstream distribution. Brandon, this film also does not have U.S. distribution. What’s the plan?\t\n\n\tKramer: We are doing a theatrical release with The Film Collaborative. The film will open at Film Forum in January. I’m hoping that a distributor, in particular a streamer and broadcaster, will come around and share this film.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRob Williams, the veteran film executive who spent a decade at the now defunct Participant Media, has been named president of content strategy at Sumerian Pictures.\n\n\tFounder and CEO Ash Avildsen announced the hire Friday, and has tasked Williams with expanding the unit’s film slate. Sumerian bills itself as an “artists-led independent creative studio,” and Williams will focus on bulking up releases for North America. Sumerian’s primary business is in the music space, publishing genres like rock and metal.\n\t\n\n\t“Rob brings a wealth of experience, relationships and strong instincts in independent film. Most importantly, he shares our passion in telling and discovering compelling stories that deserve theatrical releases,” said Avildsen. “I have dedicated many years of my life to the Sumerian cause in music and now with Rob, we will bring that ethos into cinema. I am grateful to work alongside him and the company we are building together.”\n\n\n\tWilliams will be based in Los Angeles and oversee strategy, acquisitions and distribution for the film division. At Participant, Williams was responsible for a large portfolio including sales, distribution and acquisitions across movies and series. His credits include the Oscar-nominated “All the Beauty and the Bloodshed,” “Green Book,” “Roma” and “American Factory.”\n\n\tHe previously held executive roles at Netflix and Indomina Media and most recently consulted for Neon. Williams is an AMPAS member and an advisory board member for the Independent Film and TV Alliance and Mercato Internazionale Audiovisivo.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m thrilled to work with the Sumerian team to support great films and build a greater distribution capacity for the company,” Williams added. “We are looking for bold, distinctive films of any genre.”\n\n\tEarlier this year, Sumerian theatrically released “Queen of the Ring,” directed by Avildsen and starring Emily Bett Rickards, Josh Lucas, and Walton Goggins. They also rolled out Brendan Yates and Pat McCrory Tribeca player “Turnstile: Never Enough.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLYON, France — As Hungary took center stage as country of honor at this year’s International Classic Film Market (MIFC) in Lyon, the spotlight fell on an institution that tells a remarkable story of cultural resurrection.\n\n\tWithout a national cinémathèque, the National Film Institute (NFI), along with the Film Archive and Filmlab, set about restoring, digitizing and sharing Hungary’s cinema. “When I took over in 2017, it started from scratch – it was a ruin,” György Raduly, director of the Hungarian National Film Archive, told Variety. “The most difficult part was to change the mindset. For 10 years there had been no development, no change, and people were really on the floor.”\n\t\n\n\tEight years on, Raduly says the system now functions like a “Rubik’s cube”: “It’s a perfect model. We work as a team to put together the picture,” he says, describing the tight collaboration between archive, lab and fund.\n\n\n\tAt a roundtable in Lyon titled An Inverted Model: Concrete Action to Promote Hungary’s Cinematographic Heritage, Raduly joined Viktoria Sovák Lelievre, director of the Filmlab, and Csaba Bereczki, director of international affairs and sales at the National Film Fund, to explain how the system has evolved – all three in fluent French. \n\n\t“We choose the titles [to restore] not only according to their era but also their relevance today,” said Raduly. \n\n\tAround 30 feature films are restored every year, from silent works to post-1989 titles – a selection based on the condition of the film materials, anniversaries or distributor interest.\n\t\n\n\tSince 2017, the NFI has restored over 350 films and digitized hundreds more. Many are available on Filmio, the national streaming platform, and on a nationwide online catalogue for schools. The films are subtitled in English and the ambition, Bereczki said, is to reach audiences across Europe, even where distribution is weak.\n\n\tBereczki traced the origins of this integrated system to the reforms of 2011, when the Film Fund was established to consolidate a fragmented sector. The results now extend beyond restoration, said Bereczki: Filmio combines rights from the NFI catalogue’s pre-1990 films – whose rights are held by the Institute – with new releases whose producers opt in. “Our ambition is to make Hungarian films accessible globally, and ultimately to overcome geo-blocking,” he said.\n\n\tFor Sovák Lelievre – who emphasized that her team works both on heritage and fresh films – the lab is the heart of the system. “We manage the entire process from A to Z – photo-chemical and digital restoration, color correction, reverse scanning,” she said. “We’re in a fortunate position because the laboratory and the archive belong to the same institution. We can work closely together on selecting the best elements all along the restoration chain.”\n\n\tShe also stressed the importance of preserving analog originals: “Hungarian films are very, very well preserved.”\n\n\tHungary’s lack of a cinémathèque has forced creative solutions. The NFI partners with cinemas and schools to organize some 3,000 screenings a year and a subsidy scheme with the education ministry enables students to attend for a symbolic €1.5 ($1.75) – filling off-peak hours and turning screenings into classrooms.\n\n\tFor international exposure, festivals and partnerships play a key role. Restored films now screen in Cannes, Berlin or Annecy, while the Budapest Classics Film Marathon has grown into a landmark event. Running every year in September, the six-day festival screens over 120 films and scores tens of thousands of admissions.\n\n\tGuests this year included David Cronenberg, István Szabó and producer Robert Lantos. “Film heritage plays this strange role as an intermediate medium between ages. It’s not our mission to promote contemporary film, but of course we open minds: When people see 125 years of Hungarian filmmaking, they realize it’s a filmmaking country,” said Raduly.  \n\t\n\n\tEuropean cooperation has been essential. The recent restoration of  “After Death” (“Un Revenant”) by Christian Jaque brought together Hungary, Belgium and France.\n\n\t“The only surviving copy of this 1922 silent film was found in Belgium,” Raduly explained. “Because it’s based on a French novel by Gaston Leroux, we reached out to the Cinémathèque Française, and thanks to European funding, we made this beautiful cooperation possible.”\n\n\tHungary’s restorations have become tools of cultural diplomacy: they have screened at Bologna’s Il Cinema Ritrovato, MoMA in New York and in Japan. “Every time we can show our newest restoration, we open a window to a filmmaker or a period – we are speaking about our film culture as a whole,” Raduly told Variety.\n\n\tThat visibility is paying off. “The invitation for Hungary to be Country of Honor at France’s Annecy Animation Festival this year was born from meetings at the Film Marathon,” Raduly said. “We started with film heritage, and it went far beyond – but the guiding light was always the heritage.”\n\n\tPlans for a Budapest cinémathèque are now taking shape: a site has been found and plans are being drawn up. But final approval and funding remain political decisions. That progress is significant in a country where cultural institutions operate within a highly centralized system. Yet within that framework, the archive-lab-fund alliance has managed to thrive, focusing on preservation, education and access.\n\n\tFor Raduly, that mission runs deep. “Even in 1917 and 1918, Hungary was producing more than 100 feature films a year,” he said. “It’s in our DNA.”\n\n\tThe MIFC runs alongside the Lumiere Film Festivals in Lyon and wraps on Oct. 17.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter Death\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrince Andrew has announced he will step away from public life and cease using his royal title and honors, following discussions with King Charles III and other senior members of the Royal Family.\n\n\t“In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,” Andrew said in a statement released Friday evening U.K. time. “I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “With His Majesty’s agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honors which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.”\n\n\n\tThe royal, 65, will remain a prince, but will no longer be the Duke of York, a title which was conferred upon him by Queen Elizabeth. He has been under intense scrutiny since 2019 following allegations linked to his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. While Andrew has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing, the scandal led him to withdraw from royal duties and lose a number of patronages.\n\n\tHe stopped using the style His Royal Highness, or HRH, in 2022 amid the civil case brought by Virginia Giuffre, which he eventually settled without admitting wrongdoing. An upcoming posthumous memoir by Giuffre, who died by suicide on April 25, has expanded upon her allegations against Andrew. Set for release on Tuesday, “Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice,” which was finished before Giuffre’s death, alleges she and Andrew had sex three times and that he played a “guessing game” before mentioning that she was older than his daughters.\n\t\n\n\tFriday’s statement formalizes what has been a gradual retreat from public life. The move signals a further effort by Buckingham Palace to distance the monarchy from ongoing controversies as it seeks to refocus attention on the work of King Charles and the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBroadway’s elite turned out on Thursday for the opening night of Lincoln Center Theater’s “Ragtime” revival, a production that artistic director Lear deBessonet thinks will resonate with audiences today even more powerfully than when it first premiered over 25 years ago.\n\n\t“It is so profound to watch an audience connect with this material,” deBessonet told Variety on the red carpet at the Vivian Beaumont Theater. “It holds all of the beauty of the dreams of this country, and it also holds our wounds. It holds the things that we’re still working through to be a more perfect union — and I think all of that is felt very poignantly today.”\n\t\n\n\tAdapted from E.L. Doctorow’s 1975 novel of the same name, “Ragtime” interweaves the stories of a white family from New Rochelle, a Black pianist from Harlem, and a Jewish father-daughter duo fleeing Latvia at the dawn of the 20th century. The original production premiered in Toronto and Los Angeles before opening on Broadway in 1998.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNEW YORK, NEW YORK – OCTOBER 16: (EXCLUSIVE COVERAGE) Ben Platt and Noah Galvin pose at the opening night of the revival of the musical “Ragtime” on Broadway at The Vivian Beaumont Theatre at Lincoln Center on October 16, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Bruce Glikas/WireImage)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBruce Glikas/WireImage\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe starry guest list included Rachel Zegler, Hillary Clinton, Ben Platt and Noah Galvin, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Celia Keenan-Bloger, Danielle Brooks, Matthew Rhys, Michael Urie, Phillipa Soo and Michael Kors.\n\n\tSix-time Tony winner Audra McDonald reflected on how her generation has shaped (and perhaps strained) the American Dream.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m sorry to the younger generation,” McDonald lamented. “We seem to have screwed it up, but I have faith that they will fix it.”\n\n\tThe question of whether the American Dream is still attainable echoed through the night, including at the show’s afterparty at the Metropolitan Opera House. \n\n\t“I absolutely believe the American Dream can be achieved,” said Joshua Henry, who stars in “Ragtime” as Coalhouse Walker Jr. “I think about my Jamaican parents who came to America wanting a better life for their family. I’m a recipient of their hard work ethic, and I’m able to do what I do now.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNEW YORK, NEW YORK – OCTOBER 16: Joshua Henry attends the opening night for “Ragtime” at Vivian Beaumont Theatre at Lincoln Center on October 16, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFor Rodd Cyrus, who portrays Harry Houdini, the inclusion of the real-life illusionist (he appears alongside other historical figures like Booker T. Washington and Henry Ford) underscores the immigrant experience and the lasting imprint of ambition.\n\n\t“He came from nothing,” Cyrus said. “He was an immigrant also, and now 100 years later, Dua Lipa’s putting out a song called ‘Houdini.’ He made a legacy.”\n\n\tCyrus added with a laugh, “I think he would love Dua Lipa’s music. He probably listened to ragtime — because ragtime was the music that came out during the time he was coming to prominence. It was probably a mix between ragtime and some deep organ music.”\n\n\tDeBessonet previously staged a run of “Ragtime” at New York City Center uo coincide with the week of the 2024 presidential election. The timing proved apt for a show that both celebrates and critiques the great American experiment set forth by the Founding Fathers.“There’s a line in the play: ‘the dream of what this country can be,’” deBessonet said. “It’s not saying that it already is that, but it can be that.”\n\n\tIn addition to Henry and Cyrus, the principal cast members of the latest production includes Caissie Levy, Brandon Uranowitz, Colin Donnell, Nichelle Lewis, Ben Levi Ross, Shaina Taub, Anna Grace Barlow, John Clay III, Nick Barrington and Tabitha Lawing. \n\n\tThe musical runs through Jan. 4, 2026 at Lincoln Center’s Vivian Beaumont Theater.\n",

    "body": "\n\tXbox‘s new handheld device has been out for 24 hours and the response to the ROG Xbox Ally and pricier ROG Xbox Ally X has been overwhelmingly positive from early reviewers.\n\n\tBut as with every major release within the gaming community, the Ally’s launch has prompted questions surrounding cost vs. value, who exactly the handheld console is meant for, and how the new on-the-go-PC-style product (made in partnership with Taiwanese electronics company Asus) might impact Microsoft Gaming’s plans for more full-scale Xbox gaming consoles.\n\t\n\n\tFirst up, Xbox president Sarah Bond tells Variety that the price tags for the Ally ($599.99) and Ally X ($999.99) were determined with guidance from manufacturer Asus based on the features.\n\n\n\t“We looked at, how do we create multiple options for people? And it really was Asus, because this is their hardware,” Bond said Thursday during a launch event for the Ally devices. “That is all of their insight into the market, into the feature set, into what people want, to determine the ultimate prices of the devices.”\n\n\tDespite the steep price, Bond says that when pre-orders opened in September, “the reaction was overwhelming demand for the device.” “We sold out on the Xbox Store. We sold really quickly at a number of other places around the world,” Bond said. “I feel really good about the value that we’re giving gamers for the price, based off the reception to the hardware.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Microsoft\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBond says the pre-launch results are “a real confirmation of something that we know and have been working towards for a really long time, which is gaming should act like all entertainment: it should be something you can have with you anywhere. You should be able to play any game you want with anyone you want on any device.”\n\t\n\n\tXbox decided to partner with Asus to develop the Ally line of handhelds “to really begin to transform the experience and take it to that next level in a way that we could do partnered much quicker, and in a much more innovative way, than we could [individually] with what we were each doing,” Bond says.\n\n\tThe first step in the process was prioritizing the ergonomic design of the Ally and Ally X: “We took everything we knew about what it took to make a controller, what it actually feels like for things to work in a variety of hand sizes, what it feels like to play for three hours and worked on the ergonomics of the device to make it super, super comfortable,” the Xbox president said.\n\n\tOnce the hands-on experience was sorted, Bond says the Xbox team’s next call was to Microsoft’s PC department.\n\n\t“We partnered with the Windows team to think about the Windows experience on the device and to make sure it was optimized,” Bond said. “There isn’t a keyboard on this. We had to optimize it for controller and touch all the way through the UE, all the way through jumping into your games. So Windows is actually built to run on a handheld and on this form factor and on something that is built especially for a gaming.”\n\n\tSome early discourse around the Xbox handhelds is questioning who exactly the products are meant for, seeing as Asus is first and foremost focused on PC-handheld devices, and there are skeptics who think the ROG Xbox Ally was going to be little more than an existing Asus product with an Xbox button and branding.\n\n\tWhile not an internally made product, Bond insists it is Xbox through and through — whether you’re a more causal gamer and want an Ally, or a hardcore gamer who is eyeing an Ally X.\n\n\t“We want to make sure that people have a choice,” Bond says. “We want to make sure there’s an option for the power players who want the latest innovations, that want to push the edge of what’s possible, the most demanding players. And then, if someone is looking for PC gaming on the go, they’re a casual gamer, they’re a gaming enthusiast, then there’s Xbox Allys for them. Giving multiple choices for people, so we can actually meet people where they are.”\n\n\tThe announcement of the ROG Xbox Allys and Xbox’s partnership with Asus also sparked some confusion over whether Xbox was out of the in-house-made console game. Bond confirms the Xbox team is still hard at work on its next-gen consoles, the follow-ups to the Xbox Series S and X, and there’s even the possibility of internally made handhelds.\n\t\n\n\t“We are 100% looking at making things in the future,” Bond said. “We have our next-gen hardware in development. We’ve been looking at prototyping, designing. We have a partnership we’ve announced with AMD around it, so that is coming. What we saw here was an opportunity to innovate in a new way and to bring gamers another choice, in addition to our next-gen hardware. We are always listening to what players and creators want. When there is demand for innovation, we’re going to build it.”\n\n\tThe launch of the Xbox Ally and Ally X comes on the heels of several price increases at Xbox (for both consoles and its Game Pass subscription service) and just before the holiday season, when Xbox has a slate of much-anticipated AAA game launches still to come, including “Call of Duty: Black Ops 7” and “Outer Worlds 2.” Bond notes this frenzy of releases and business updates are “the start of a new pace the team is executing.”\n\n\t“There’s a ton more innovation to come, including things like further optimizing the experience here, scaling out the handheld compatibility program, offering more benefits and improvements to the experience and other features and adds that we’re going to give to people and more choices and more games,” Bond says.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere has been no shortage of hot takes about Bari Weiss’ appointment as CBS News’ top editorial exec — and speculation that David Ellison paid $150 million for her contrarian outlet The Free Press mainly to appease the likes of Donald Trump by trying to show that he wants to make CBS News “anti-woke” and root out alleged liberal bias.Predictably, Weiss’ arrival at CBS News rattled the troops. WGA East warned staffers to not reply to her memo asking for details on “how you spend your working hours” until the union received assurances that the responses wouldn’t factor into layoffs or “discipline.” CBS told the WGA that employees would not be disciplined for not responding.But the episode reflects the fear and uncertainty of what Weiss plans to do at CBS News. A number of observers have expressed dire warnings and anger over Ellison’s putting her in charge of news operations.\n\n\tDan Rather, longtime anchor of the “CBS Evening News,” called Weiss “one of the most polarizing figures in today’s American media landscape” and lamented that her appointment marks “a dark day in the halls of CBS News.” (His post was titled “MAGA Tested, Trump Approved News.”) New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie , Weiss’ former colleague at the paper, called her impending CBS News appointment “a heartwarming story of how being an unethical and talentless hack is no barrier to your success when you are willing to endlessly flatter the wretched views of rich dipshits.” Jon Oliver slammed Weiss as having “spent years putting out work that, in my opinion, is at best irresponsible and at worst deeply misleading.” And so on.Weiss maintains that she simply wants to “seek the truth and tell it plainly.” The Free Press’ 170,000 subscribers “demonstrated that there’s a market for honest journalism,” she wrote on X Oct. 6. “And they’ve given us a mandate to pursue that mission from an even bigger platform” at CBS News. She has supporters, by the way: Conde Nast’s Anna Wintour said Weiss is “a very accomplished young woman” who has the makings of a great leader.”It’s true that trust in the news media is at an all-time low. Per a Gallup poll fielded Sept. 2-16, 28% of Americans agreed they had a “great deal” or “fair amount” of trust in newspapers, TV and radio to report the news “fully, accurately and fairly.” That’s the lowest the figure has been since Gallup began measuring Americans’ confidence in news reporting in 1972. To Weiss and others, that’s proof that news organizations must change if they want to remain going concerns.Meanwhile, as Variety’s Brian Steinberg has pointed out, CBS News does need some shaking up: The news division’s series of senior execs over the past few years have been unable to turn around “CBS Evening News” and “CBS Mornings,” whose ratings remain stuck in third place behind time-slot rivals at NBC News and ABC News.However, a major factor in the decline of Americans’ trust in media has been the attacks on the news media by Donald Trump and his fellow MAGA travelers. Over the course of 10 years, Trump has written nearly 3,500 social media posts that attack the press. On Thursday, the president’s lawyers refiled a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times, alleging its reporters have knowingly and maliciously maligned his achievements. (The Times says the refiled suit is meritless and that “nothing has changed.”) This comes after he received $16 million payouts from suits he filed against ABC News and CBS News’ “60 Minutes”; he’s also filed a $20 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal over its reporting on the bawdy birthday letter he once sent to Jeffrey Epstein.Why is Trump relentlessly antagonistic toward the news media? (Note that he’s lashed out at ostensibly friendly outlets like Fox News when it suits him.) According to “60 Minutes” correspondent Lesley Stahl, after Trump won the 2016 election she asked him why kept railing against the press. Per Stahl, Trump replied, “You know why I do it? I do it to discredit you all and demean you all, so that when you write negative stories about me, no one will believe you.”\n\t\n\tRecall that Trump’s “60 Minutes” lawsuit claimed that the program’s editing of an interview with Kamala Harris violated Texas consumer fraud law, causing “widespread confusion and mental anguish of consumers” including Trump himself and somehow harmed Trump’s business interests. Editing interviews for length and clarity is standard journalistic practice, and the “60 Minutes” edits did not change the meaning of what Harris was trying to say. Initially, Paramount Global called the suit “meritless” and an “affront to the First Amendment.” However, then-controlling shareholder Shari Redstone, eager to sell her family’s media business to Skydance Media, decided that paying off Trump was the right business decision. The $16 million settlement with Trump was “absolutely” the right thing to do, Redstone said last month. The lawsuit was a “distraction” that “took up way too much time in the news, which really had an impact on our employees and our ability to do other transactions.”In the context of Trump’s anti-media firehose, there may be nothing Weiss can really do to change the perception (or misperception) that mainstream media is irreparably unfair. Regardless, additional changes are undoubtedly ahead for CBS News under her watch — not least of which are looming job cuts, as Paramount Skydance is about to make thousands of layoffs. It’s bound to be a bumpy ride.",

    "body": "\n\tPBS president and CEO Paula Kerger is in a race against time. Usually, public TV and radio stations across the country receive their annual financial grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in November. But after President Donald Trump signed a rescission bill in July, the $1.1 billion in federal funding that had been earmarked for public broadcasting in 2026 and 2027 was eliminated — forcing a scramble to fill that financial gap. That’s particularly urgent for smaller stations in rural markets that depended more on federal funds to remain in operation.\n\t\n\n\tAlready, several PBS stations are in danger of shutting down: Penn State University announced plans to close its public TV outlet WPSU (which may now carry on via an acquisition by Philadelphia pubcaster WHYY), while New Jersey PBS said its band of stations will likely go dark next year. Meanwhile, state legislatures in places like North Dakota and Indiana have also cut funding for local public broadcasters.\n\n\n\t“I’m most worried about the most vulnerable stations, so I have spent a fair amount of time working with a few others and some key foundations to try to put a corpus of money together that will give those stations a glide path — so they have a couple years of funding that they can figure out whether they consolidate or they merge,” Kerger says. \n\n\t“Some of the smaller stations are looking at coming together in some sort of shared agreement, which would change the way they operate, but would keep local media in communities around the country,” she adds. “I think that’s a really good model. There are some stations that are looking at merging with an adjacent station and serving a larger market. And then I think there will be some that will find this a bridge too far and will decide not to continue.”\n\t\n\n\tIn light of those budget shortfalls, PBS cut the dues it requires from member stations. But that means less money coming in to cover PBS’ own budget. The broadcaster recently announced it would lay off around 15% of its workforce; hardest hit was its PBS Kids programming operation, after the U.S. Department of Education eliminated the CPB’s Ready to Learn grant in May. \n\n\tKerger has also been looking to raise money through the nonprofit PBS Foundation to cover the cost of fare that it funds or that is produced by partner stations like WGBH Boston, WNET New York and WETA Washington.\n\n\t“Obviously, the first priority is ‘PBS NewsHour,’ because that’s an ongoing news operation where you’re burning through money all the time,” Kerger says. “And we’re looking at some of the big series where CPB was helpful, like ‘Nova,’ ‘Nature’ and ‘Great Performances.’”\n\n\tBut Kerger says PBS will have to adjust its output. The long-running series “American Experience,” for example, will be put on hiatus after its two-part “Kissinger” airs at the end of this month.\n\n\t“By the end of the year, there will be no more ‘American Experience’ staff,” says executive producer Cameo George. “There will be no new films. We did have films that were in production for 2026, but when the  news came of the defunding and PBS deciding that they did not want to fund a future season, those films were killed… I will always hold out hope that PBS will bring ‘American Experience’ back, because I think it’s foundational to understanding America’s history.”\n\n\tKerger says next year, PBS will rebroadcast episodes from the show’s library that fit the theme of the U.S.’ 250th anniversary. Beyond that, for 2026, PBS still has plenty of original fare in the pipeline, but the service might also rely more heavily on repeats of signature programs like Ken Burns’ “The Civil War” to make up for budget deficits.\n\n\t“With some series, we’re going to potentially have fewer episodes and maybe leverage a little deeper off of our library,” she says. “We do have unbelievable assets, and much of the content that we have is has not been seen by a lot of people.”\n\n\tThe threat of ending federal funding for public broadcasting has lurked since the moment President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. Famously, “Mr. Rogers” host Fred Rogers spoke to Congress in a 1969 hearing, defending the need and use of funds to support the service. \n\t\n\n\tBut with as the threat became real under a Trump administration, some filmmakers feared their stories may be watered down in order to avoid any sort of controversy. Mark Levin, the filmmaker behind the recent “American Experience” installment “Hard Hat Riot,” tells Variety that he was asked to remove an ending that showed Ronald Reagan in 1980 saying, “we will make America great again.” Says Levin: “They were concerned that in this political atmosphere, it might not get on the air.” (George says it was a creative decision, “not a political one.”)\n\n\tAsked about whether the current environment might impact PBS editorial decisions, Kerger notes: “They’ve already taken away our funding. I think if there was a risk of that, you would have seen it before, which we obviously did not do…   I just feel like we have been buffeted through this entire year, and we have not held back from the programs that we put forward. We did, I think, a very fair and very honest assessment of the first 100 Days of the Trump administration on ‘Frontline.’ The NewsHour continues to do the same kind of quality journalism that it’s done in the past. There were some that asked me when we were in the federal fight, ‘what if you agreed to give up on your news programming?’ That, to me, feels totally against our mission and what we’re supposed to be doing. I think in this moment, people are relying on us even more for information that they can trust. The best thing for us to continue to do is to just keep moving ahead and doing the work that the public is counting on us to do.”\n\n\tKerger listed a litany of ways public broadcasting has been under fire over the past 10 months, starting with FCC Chairman Brendan Carr sending PBS a letter accusing the pubcaster of running ads, and if so, that he’d tell Congress to defund them. That was then followed by letter of inquiry from the FCC, which continues. Then came the executive order that made it illegal for federal funds to come to PBS or NPR. There was House subcommittee hearing where Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.), accused PBS and NPR of becoming “radical left-wing echo chambers.” There was the defunding of the kids service, and removal of the Democratic members of the CPB board.\n\n\t“We have a lot of conservative donors that support us because they believe that the work we’re doing is really not only fair, but it’s of high value,” Kerger says, pointing to series like “Breaking the Deadlock” and “Firing Line.” “There has to be a place where various viewpoints are brought forward in a way that is not antagonistic, that encourages people to like at least hear from each other. It’s up to us to really work even harder to make sure that we’re bringing the vast array of perspectives from around the country forward.”\n\t\n\n\tThe challenge forward, she added, is finding ways to still work with the filmmaking community as resources have now shrunk. “In the near term, we may not be able to do quite as much as we attempt to do, but I am determined, as we move forward, that we’re just not going to just stick with the series that have been on the air for a long time. We have to keep investing in programs that are meeting the moment.”\n\n\tWith the current government shutdown, there’s obviously no movement at the moment on efforts to restore public media funds. But Kerger says she’s not giving up the fight. “It’s not over,” she says. “We’re back in the conversation again. I’ve spent some time up on the Hill talking to people on both sides of the aisle and I think there are some possibilities, particularly in next year’s budget. It may take a while for that to lumber forward. I just want to be really clear that we’re not giving up on the on the federal [funding].”\n\n\tHowever, Kerger is also realistic that a “white knight” won’t be coming in to save public broadcasting. And that’s why in the long term, PBS is looking at things like reducing its real estate, the kinds of shows to greenlight, where PBS should focus its output in this changing media landscape and how to better rely on philanthropic support.\n\n\t“We have been very heartened by the fact that so many people have been stepping up,” Kerger says. “All of these contributions that are coming into our PBS Foundation are hugely helpful as we’re trying to figure out how exactly to rightsize the organization so that we can operate based on the amount of resources that we have.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOscar Isaac had the time of his life playing one of literature’s most tortured souls.\n\n\tIn Guillermo del Toro’s reimagining of “Frankenstein,” Isaac takes on the role of Victor Frankenstein, describing his performance as unexpectedly pleasurable despite the character’s darkness. He even admitted to del Toro that he was concerned by how much he was enjoying portraying a man consumed by rage and obsession.\n\n\n\t“I didn’t expect that playing this character was going to be so fun and joyful,” Isaac says during the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast. “I mean, some dark stuff. This guy’s got a lot of rage, he’s got a lot of damage, and yet, I’m finding it really enjoyable.”\n\t\n\n\tOn this episode, Isaac discusses taking on one of the most prolific characters in all of literature, finding family in Guillermo Del Toro, and why that has formed the way he thinks about who to say ‘yes’ to in Hollywood.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANKENSTEIN, Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein, 2025. ph: Ken Woroner / © Netflix / courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDel Toro’s explanation for this paradox revealed to Isaac that Victor Frankenstein operates without doubt or hesitation—until his catastrophic moment of reckoning.\n\n\t“He smartly said, ‘Well, maybe because you’re playing a character that doesn’t have any doubts,’” Isaac recalled. “The whole first half of the movie, maybe more of it, he’s just doubtless about what he wants to do and what he needs to do, even though it’s fueled by rage and resentment and defiance.”\n\n\tThe Netflix film, which features an ensemble cast including Jacob Elordi, Christoph Waltz and Mia Goth, presents a visually striking Frankenstein. Isaac sports flowing dark hair that evokes rock icons — a deliberate choice that positions Victor as more artist than scientist.\n\t\n\n\t“Guillermo and I talked a lot about him being much more like an artist than a scientist, that he moves through space like a musician, like Prince, or like Jimi Hendrix,” Isaac explained, noting that costume designer Kate Hawley drew inspiration from Hendrix’s 1960s style.\n\n\tThe look required eight months of commitment, with production lasting 105 days. Isaac worked with his longtime hair artist Tim Nolan, who has collaborated with him since 2017 and helped create memorable looks, including his character’s distinctive beard in “Dune.”\n\n\tDel Toro’s approach to the classic tale involves a crucial narrative device: the entire story is told from Victor’s perspective, making him an unreliable narrator. This framework allowed Isaac to explore the character’s psychological distortions.\n\n\t“It’s a story that he is telling about himself, so it’s not necessarily true,” Isaac shares. “He says some of it is fact, some is not, but it’s all true — meaning that this is what it felt like.”\n\n\tThe casting of Goth in dual roles as both Victor’s mother and Elizabeth further contributes to the unreliable narration. “In his mind, that’s the only woman he’s ever seen — his mom,” Isaac explained, suggesting Victor remains emotionally frozen at age 12, when his mother died and he blamed his father.\n\n\tIsaac interprets the creation of the creature as Victor’s attempt to resurrect his own wounded inner child. “It’s too painful to even look at it, so he decides to try to destroy it,” he expresses. “And this child — this resurrected child from the dead — has to chase him down to the ends of the earth to forgive him.”\n\n\tUnlike naturalistic performances, del Toro directed Isaac toward a heightened, almost operatic portrayal. The director described the character as a Jungian archetype, which required Isaac to prioritize technical precision over psychological realism.\n\n\t“Guillermo quickly, when we started, said, ‘This is not a naturalistic performance,’” Isaac recalled. “He’s like a Jungian archetype. Now, you can’t play an archetype, but the idea is to lean into his darkness — to his id going wild. There’s something elemental about him.”\n\n\tThe approach contrasts with typical method acting. Isaac consulted with Waltz about whether actors should watch their own takes, with Waltz warning that believing you’re doing well “is a real problem.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production deepened Isaac’s relationship with del Toro beyond a typical director-actor collaboration. Isaac describes it as “finding a lost family member,” comparing the experience to “making a movie with my tío.”\n\n\t“I think not a day has gone by that we don’t speak since then,” Isaac says.\n\n\tThis bond has shifted Isaac’s approach to selecting projects. After balancing indie films like “A Most Violent Year” with blockbusters like “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” he now prioritizes the people involved over script quality alone.\n\n\t“It’s not enough that it’s a good character in a good script with a good director,” Isaac reflects. “It’s: Who am I going to be living life with? Who am I going to be disrupting the routine of my family to go off somewhere and collaborate with?”\n\n\tDel Toro’s infectious enthusiasm for cinema creates an atmosphere Isaac finds rare in the industry. He notes the director’s generosity toward other filmmakers and his focus on celebrating what he loves rather than criticizing what he doesn’t.\n\n\t“He’s so much more interested in the things that he loves than the things that he hates,” Isaac observed. “It’s much more interesting and exciting to share about the things that he loves.”\n\n\t“Frankenstein” represents what Isaac calls a “Latin American telling” of the Gothic tale — one led by emotion and desire. It’s a punk-rock interpretation of Romantic literature, filtered through del Toro’s decades of absorbing the source material and refracting it through his distinctive vision.\n\n\tFor Isaac, the role may represent one of his most technically demanding and emotionally complex performances to date. Not bad for a rock star.\n\n\tAlso on this episode, Oscar-nominee Ethan Hawke talks about playing Lorenz Hart in “Blue Moon” and why he doesn’t think he’ll never do another “Before” movie.\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

    "body": "\n\tThis year’s Animation Is Film Festival is all about advocating for the growing stature of the flourishing medium in the filmmaking capital of the world.\n\n\tThe three-day event, unspooling at Hollywood’s TCL Chinese Theatres from Friday to Sunday, is set to program and champion new films from around the world, including the opening night premiere of Mamoru Hosoda’s “Scarlet,” the world premiere of Laika’s “ParaNorman: The Thrifting,” a short film that will have an exclusive introduction with director Chris Butler and Anna Kendrick, and Li Wenyu’s “A Story About Fire,” following a monkey and a dog as they travel through dangerous forests, tundras, and jungles to reach the Holy Mountain. \n\t\n\n\t Presented by GKIDS in collaboration with Annecy International Animation Film Festival and Variety, the event, which launched in 2017, will also be presenting a sold-out panel with the filmmakers and animators behind Netflix’s “Kpop Demon Hunters,” hosted by Variety‘s Chief Film Critic Peter Debruge.\n\n\n\t“With the case of ‘Kpop Demon Hunters,’ you’re dealing with a cultural phenomenon,” says festival director Matt Kaszanek. “It’s one of these things where it can always be tricky when you’re programming, because the film is out and everyone has seen it. We came up with a really innovative idea of having a conversation with the two directors and the producer with the character designers and the head of animation to have an in depth conversation about this moment that the film is experiencing right now, and we’re really excited about it.”\n\n\tWith additional programming that honors student animators from around the world, Kaszanek hopes young animators can connect with future collaborators, industry veterans, and the opportunity to see their work on the big screen. “Over the course of just a single weekend in Los Angeles, we really set out to be the first to present these films that are really important in shaping what the future of animation is,” Kaszanek reveals. “The idea that the next generation of animators and animation fans in Los Angeles are seeing these films, the opportunity that you’re seeing it for the first time is gratifying, and something that we’re really proud of.”\n\t\n\n\tThe goal of Animation Is Film is to break barriers for animation. “Animation Is Film is a little bit different from the other festivals because it has a very purposeful mission, which is to celebrate animation and to make sure that it is talked about in a respectful way,” said Kaszanek.\n\n\t“Animation is a word that is used as a qualifier when people are talking about the best films of the year, so they’ll say, ‘It was the best animated film of the year.’ I don’t like [using] animated as a qualifier. We want to continue to see that conversation evolving.”\n\n\n\n",

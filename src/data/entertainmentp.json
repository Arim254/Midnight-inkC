    "body": "\n\tParis-based auteur-driven sales boutique Alpha Violet has acquired world distribution rights to two titles set to world premiere in competition at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival (PÖFF), running over Nov. 7-23.\n\n\tOne candidate for Tallinn’s main Grand Prix, “18 Holes to Paradise” is helmed by Portuguese filmmaker and New York Film Academy graduate João Nuno Pinto, known for his acclaimed debut “America” (2010), “Mosquito,” which was a Rotterdam Fest opener in 2020, and crime series “Natural Law.”\n\t\n\n\tPenned by “Mosquito’”s Fernanda Polacow, the drama is set at a drought-stricken Portuguese country home. It tells of “landowners and staff who recount the same events from irreconcilable perspectives, revealing a fractured world on the brink of collapse,” reads the logline. In the title roles are Margarida Marinho (“The Drought,” “A Shot in the Dark”) Beatriz Batarda (“Night Train to Lisbon,” “Finisterra”), Rita Cabaço (“Great Yarmouth-Provisional Figures”) and Jorge Andrade.\n\n\n\t“18 Holes to Paradise” is a film that was born out of our experience of watching our country dry out and be sold cheap. So we went about creating a beautiful and decadent country side property and its three siblings who can’t agree on its future: to sell or not to sell,” Pinto told Variety. “When a big forest fire surrounds them, internal social crises erupt, bringing the land workers in the conversation.\n\n\t As the rich owners of the property try not to go insane, cows simply observe as the clock ticks fast.”Following its world debut in Tallinn Nov. 13, the feature, backed by pubcaster RTP, will roll out in national cinemas via NOS. Trent Film will handle Italian distribution.\n\t\n\n\t“Goodbye Sisters,” one of 10 pics to be showcased at Doc@PÖFF International Competition, is directed by emerging French-Irish filmmaker Alexander Murphy for Paris-based prodco Goodseed Productions and co-producer Underground Talkies Nepal.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGoodbye Sisters\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: Goodseed Productions\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe filmmaker turns his camera on Jamuna (20) and her younger sister Anmuna, from the bustle of Kathmandu to the high ridges of the Himalayas. The young girls are going back to their remote mountain village to take part in the perilous harvest of the yarsagumba, a rare creature, half mushroom, half insect, whose value exceeds that of gold. For Jamuna, selling it in the city would enable her to support her family and fund her studies abroad.\n\n\tMurphy says his pic explores “the strength it takes to hold on to a dream against all odds.” “Jamuna refuses to accept the life laid out for her in Nepal, daring to fight for the future she envisions. But that choice comes at a cost, saying goodbye to the people she loves most. It’s an intimate glimpse into what migration truly means,” he claims.“Goodbye Sisters” will be released by established French outlet Dulac Distribution.\n\n\tCommenting on their pick-ups, Alpha Violet co-heads Virginie Devesa and Keiko Funato said: “We are thrilled to world premiere our two new films in the Tallinn Black Nights Competition. Both films address urgent and polarizing social issues: the threat of ecological disaster and devastating forest fires in Portugal in “18 Holes to Paradise,” and the lack of opportunities for girls in Nepal, and their search for a way out in “Goodbye Sisters.” We believe that both films will attract buyers seeking strong themes and compelling narratives.”\n\n\tAlpha Violet is also representing Toronto-Fipresci winner “Forastera” by emerging Spanish talent Lucía Aleñar Iglesias, due to screen in Tallinn as part of a Focus on Catalonia.\n\n\tThe feature was just sold to the U.S. (Grasshopper Film), Japan (Starcat) and Sweden (Folkets Bio).\n",

    "body": "\n\tJennifer Coolidge and Nicole Scherzinger have joined the cast of Rebel Wilson‘s upcoming comedy “Girl Group.”\n\n\tThe film, which Wilson is writing, directing and starring in, sees her playing a “pop diva who has been kicked out of her own girl group’s reunion tour and slapped with a sentence of court-ordered community service,” its synopsis reads. She then “seizes the change to stage a comeback by coaching a group of misfit teen girls for a major record label audition.” \n\t\n\n\tCoolidge and Scherzinger’s roles remain under wraps, but the project will see Scherzinger reunite with her fellow former Pussycat Dolls member Ashley Roberts, who is part of the film’s fictional band Girlfriends alongside Wilson. Melanie Chisholm of Spice Girls fame and All Saints’ Shaznay Lewis complete the group. \n\n\n\tThe “Girl Group” cast also includes Randall Park (“WandaVision”, “Fresh off the Boat”), Sheridan Smith (“Mrs Biggs”, “Cilla”), Jamie Lee O’Donnell (“Derry Girls”, Leonard & Hungry Paul), Guz Khan (“Man Like Mobeen”, “The Gentleman”) and Jolene (“Star Trek: Enterprise”) and Loren Gray.\n\n\tThe film is produced by Wilson under her Camp Sugar banner alongside Matt Williams of Future Artists Entertainment and is executive produced by Live Nation Studios. Chris Scott, who most recently worked on “Wicked,” is the choreographer.\n\n\tCoolidge, known for her roles in “Legally Blonde” and “American Pie,” won two Emmys and a Golden Globe for her scene-stealing performance in the first two seasons of HBO’s “The White Lotus.” Scherzinger is fresh off her critically acclaimed run in Jamie Lloyd’s “Sunset Blvd.” on both the West End and Broadway, which earned her a Tony for best actress in a musical. \n",

    "body": "\n\tGreg Berlanti accepted the inaugural Greg Berlanti Social Impact Award at the UCLA Center for Scholars and Storytellers‘ annual Teens and Screens Summit on Thursday in Los Angeles. The writer, director, producer and showrunner behind movies and shows such as “Love, Simon,” “Dawsons Creek,” “Riverdale,” “You” and multiple series in the CW’s “Arrowverse” delivered a heartfelt acceptance speech reflecting on his journey towards self-acceptance, which led him to create shows that help audiences feel represented, seen, and loved.\n\t\n\n\t“As storytellers in Hollywood, we get to heal our own old stories, crafting new ones that are honest and vulnerable, and those stories, in turn, can change hearts and minds and remind the audience how much more universal human experience is than different,” a dewy-eyed Berlanti explained, “We all still want to connect. We all still want to be seen and understood. We all want love.”\n\n\n\tBerlanti shared some of those “old stories” that he’s had the opportunity to heal and expand upon throughout his illustrious career. He started with his own childhood, reminiscing about his boyish love for television while also realizing  “there was still a great void. I was a closeted gay teenager, and there were only a smattering of LGBTQ characters on TV.”\n\n\tHe reflected on how a haphazard encounter with an AIDS march in New York City gave him his first positive representation of queer people, but when one of the marchers reached out a hand to him, he rejected it. “He waited for me to take it, but I didn’t. I didn’t have the courage. I feared my parents or someone would figure out my secret if I took that hand, so I just looked away,” he said, “I spent much of my youth running from that out-stretched hand, first afraid, but then, over time, finding the strength to come out and ultimately come to love myself.”\n\t\n\n\tThe event came full circle decades later, when Berlanti screened “Love, Simon” in Olathe, Kansas in 2018. After the screening, a 14-year-old boy came out publicly and thanked Berlanti for providing him with shows and movies that allowed him to feel a little less alone. “As he reached out his hand to shake mine,” Berlanti recalled, “It wasn’t lost on me that I was getting a second shot to make up for the hand that I didn’t take so many years before.”\n\n\tBerlanti’s writing partners Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson introduced the award and its namesake. “When you work with Greg, you cry a lot, and that’s not by accident. There’s always big, heartfelt emotion at the center of Greg’s work, because that’s what Greg is,” Williamson said, with Plec adding, “He’s given us some of the most heartfelt, diverse, ambitious storytelling and television, whether it’s a superhero in a cave, a teenager falling in love for the first time, or a family finding its way, his shows don’t just entertain us. They see us.”\n\n\tMolly Ringwald, who starred in “Riverdale,” also sent in a video comparing Berlanti to John Hughes. She said that her iconic YA collaborations with Hughes from the 1980s have “stood the test of time, but they are also of their time,” adding “Greg Berlanti has built upon this legacy, shaping our modern portrayals of adolescence in much the same way, but with more representation of our diverse society.”\n\n\tThe ceremony’s focus on Berlanti’s contributions to the YA space was a fitting emphasis for the Summit, which comes in the wake of the Center for Scholars and Storytellers’ annual Teens and Screens report. The report provides insight into the media tastes and consumption habits of Gen-Z Americans. Among the findings were that young Americans still value traditional movies and television, though it is oftten consumed in small bites on TikTok and YouTube, they have a notable preference for animation, don’t care for over-sexualized love stories and crave content that offers authentic representations of lives like their own.\n\n\tThe summit unpacked these findings across multiple panels and discussions featuring media executives, content creators and academics. The most memorable panel may have been the “Ask The Teens” panel, where four teenagers took the stage for a conversation about their tastes, moderated by Roblox Youth Engagement Program Manager Andres Cuervo. The young panelists affirmed much of what the study suggested, expanding upon teens’ aversion to “trend chasing” media that feels artificial and out of touch in lieu of more earnest storytelling. As 14-year-old Hollyn Alpert said, “Teens, like adults, aren’t monoliths. They all have different opinions. They all have different views, beliefs, races, sexualities, religions. Just explore that and embrace that.” A room full of seasoned Hollywood professionals listened intently.\n\t\n\n\tBerlanti summed up the importance of heeding these young voices, saying, “What a gift it is to make a positive influence on the young lives of audiences by reminding them of these things and to give them a sense of belonging and empathy and self worth. In return, they give us hope. Young people are the ones I get my greatest sense of hope from these days. No matter how dark things seem today or as rocky as the journey to our future may end up being, I believe that the future will be brighter because of our young people.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSinger-songwriter EJAE is about to step into what she calls “unknown territory.” Having spent most of her time behind the scenes as a songwriter, EJAE has just released her first single, “In Another World,” accompanied by a music video. \n\n\tEJAE soared to global success with “KPop Demon Hunters,” where she served as the singing voice of Rumi. Huntr/X, the fictional girl group from the Netflix animated film, scored four Billboard Top 10 songs. \n\t\n\n\tEJAE has also been named one of Variety’s 10 Artisans to Watch in Songwriting. As “Demon Hunters” continues to break records, EJAE is excited for people to discover a new side of her as she flexes this very different creative muscle. The song was co-written by EJAE, Ted Andreville and Breagh Isabel, who also produced alongside Vitals and Daniel Rojas.\n\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety, EJAE says, “I’ve always been a songwriter, and that was always the first thing. I guess the only difference between a songwriter and artist, for me at least, is that I’m having people hear all my demos. But now, it’s not a demo; it’s the final form.”\n\n\tWhile she’s excited, she’s also feeling scared. “Behind the scenes, I’m hiding. But when you’re bringing your whole self to it, you’re allowing people to judge you. So I think that’s the scary part.” \n\n\tHere, EJAE discusses the songwriting process behind “In Another World” and the filming of its music video.\n\t\n\t\t‘In Another World’ has such beautiful lyrics, and we’ve always known about your songwriting skills. But what does it mean to be on this new journey, releasing the single?\t\n\n\tSongwriting is what defines my artistry. The song was personal to me and my fellow co-writers. I personally wish that the song receives more attention than me, and that’s the main goal. As a songwriter, I’m not trying to bring attention to myself or my personal life. I’m trying to bring attention to the lyrics and the melody so people can feel what I felt when I was listening to music. Music helped me get through a hard time. Adele’s “Someone Like You” helped me get through a really difficult period, and I wish that’s what this song brings to other people as well.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWith so much happening due to the success of “KPop Demon Hunters,” can you talk about the timing of the single and what made now feel like the right time?\t\n\n\tI feel like people have already been hearing my lyrics and message. It was just through a different messenger, right? Whether it be “Psycho” for Red Velvet or something else, the difference is that I’m the one now who’s actually singing it. I think the timing of it all is just quite organic. It was more because of “KPop Demon Hunters” that people were finding out about my singing voice, and people were being so nice — they wanted to hear more. I was like, “I’m down if you guys are willing.” As an artist, I don’t want myself to be boxed into being a “K-pop” artist because I don’t really view myself as a K-pop artist or a pop artist. I view myself as a songwriter of every genre.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s talk about “In Another World.” What’s the meaning behind the lyrics?\t\n\n\tI wrote this two years ago during a songwriting camp in Canada. Every time I hear it, there’s a different meaning, and that’s what I love about this song. But we were all going through something. I was going through this personal relationship thing with my fiancé. It was an important time, and things weren’t working out. We had a break, and it was an important decision-making time for me. I think it inspired this idea of, what if we met at a time when I didn’t have my baggage? What would that be like? And if we decided not to be together, what’s a way for me to be OK with that decision to let it go?\n\n\tThat mindset helped me. Maybe in another world, we would have been perfect, and I’m leaning on that parallel world with no jealousy. I have no insecurity issues that I brought into the relationship, and it would have been perfect. It very much feels like a “Sliding Doors” situation because that’s something we all do — where we wonder, “What if?” The lyrics helped me accept reality in a way, but at the same time, be OK with it by knowing to just be real with yourself. I chose this song because it felt exactly how I felt with Rumi and the movie. Accepting your demons, then accepting that part of yourself — that is when true growth happens.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘In Another World’ artwork\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou wrote this a few years ago. Is there going to be more music in the future?\t\n\n\tYes, absolutely. It’s just about picking and choosing what is right for me, what I want to speak on, and what I feel people can relate to. It doesn’t always have to be a sad song. It could be anything.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou also filmed the music video. What’s the story behind the video?\t\n\n\t“In Another World” can mean so many different things. It was initially about the relationship, but it evolved into this thing where, as a kid, in another world, I chose a different path. I had different paths I could have taken. So, it’s a love letter to my younger self. You see me back and forth playing the piano as a kid and as an adult, and what it means to me now. It’s about those two worlds colliding.\n\n\tListen to the single here.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\n\tWatch the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tA trailer has been released for “Mother Bhumi,” the latest feature from Malaysian director Chong Keat Aun, starring Chinese superstar Fan Bingbing in her return to international cinema.\n\n\tThe film has its world premiere in competition at the Tokyo International Film Festival. \n\n\tThe drama, which also stars Hong Kong’s Natalie Hsu, Taiwanese-Japanese actor Bai Run-yin, and Malaysian stage veteran Pearlly Chua, is set in late-1990s Malaysia amid political unrest. Fan plays Hong Im, a widowed farmer and ritual healer who struggles to protect her family in a multi-ethnic rice-farming village while resisting land seizures by day and performing exorcisms by night.\n\t\n\n\tThe film explores how colonial-era conflicts resurface through supernatural events, with spirits returning and black magic stirring as the legacy of empire haunts the land and its inhabitants in Bujang Valley.\n\n\n\tChong, whose previous film “Snow in Midsummer” won the Musa Cinema & Arts Award at Venice and the Firebird Award at Hong Kong, brings personal history to the project. The director grew up in a rice-field village on the Malaysia-Thailand border.\n\n\t“The legacy of colonialism persists in ongoing land and border disputes, some of which trace back to the 1909 Anglo-Siamese Treaty,” Chong said. “‘Mother Bhumi’ follows women from the margins, quietly wielding their feminine power to confront hatred and injustice rooted in borders, ethnicity, politics, and patriarchy.”\n\n\tFor Fan, the role marks a continued comeback following her appearance in “Green Night,” which premiered in the Panorama section at Berlin in 2023. She previously won best actress at the San Sebastián International Film Festival and the Asian Film Awards for “I Am Not Madame Bovary.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production is a Malaysia-Hong Kong-Italy-Saudi Arabia co-production between Janji Pictures Production, Volos Films Italia and Southern Islet Pictures. Wong Kew Soon, Stefano Centini and Zoey Teng serve as producers, with support from the Hong Kong-Asia Film Financing Forum and the Red Sea Fund.\n\n\tThe film features cinematography by Leung Ming Kai, costume design by Elaine Ng, and editing consultation by Walter Fasano. The original score is composed by Yii Kah Hoe and Chong himself, with sound design by Tu Du-Chih and Fiona Chang.\n\n\tDialogue is in Mandarin, Hokkien, Thai and Malay, reflecting the multi-ethnic setting of the story.\n\n\tRediance is handling international sales.\n\n\tWatch the trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 36th Singapore International Film Festival has unveiled its full lineup, with international star Shu Qi‘s award-winning directorial debut “Girl” set to open the event, while Oscar-nominated filmmaker Deepa Mehta becomes the first-ever female recipient of the Cinema Honorary Award.\n\n\tThe festival will showcase over 120 films from more than 45 countries as part of the Singapore Media Festival hosted by the Infocomm Media Development Authority. SGIFF marks several historic firsts, including Mehta’s groundbreaking honor and Oscar-winning “Minari” actor Youn Yuh-jung as the first South Korean recipient of the Screen Icon Award.\n\t\n\n\tShu Qi, a regular collaborator of Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien with over 90 acting credits, will attend the opening alongside lead actor Bai Xiao-Ying and actor-singer 9m88. The film premiered in Venice and won Shu Qi the best director award at Busan.\n\n\n\tThe acclaimed actor is also in Chinese filmmaker Bi Gan’s “Resurrection,” which screens in the festival’s Undercurrent section for experimental filmmaking. She’ll participate in an In Conversation session with returning festival ambassador Rebecca Lim. \n\n\tThe festival’s local programming has expanded significantly, with more than 30 feature and short films by Singaporean filmmakers and co-producers. Doubling SGIFF’s local short film selection compared to last year, the festival will present these works across the Southeast Asian Short Film Competition and Singapore Panorama, a section dedicated to features and shorts reflecting the nation’s evolving social and cultural landscape.\n\t\n\n\tSeveral world premieres headline the Singaporean slate. “Sandbox,” directed by James Thoo, is a mockumentary featuring Peps Goh, Benjamin Kheng, Estelle Fly, Nathan Hartono, Fauzi Azzhar and Oon Shu An. Also in Singapore Panorama features are documentary “At Home with Work” directed by Adar Ng and Dave Lim, “The Old Man and His Car” by Michael Kam and “Coda” by Jac Min, a Singapore-Japan co-production. In the extensive selection of Singaporean shorts, veteran actor Qi Yuwu makes his directorial debut with the short film “Cendol,” starring Sharon Au.\n\n\tThe festival’s Asian Feature Film Competition has expanded in a significant evolution beyond emerging directors to include filmmakers at every stage of their careers, with Argentinian filmmaker Lucrecia Martel serving as jury head. The competition lineup presents a vibrant cross-section of regional cinema featuring 10 titles.\n\n\tFrom Japan, Yuriyan Retriever’s “Mag Mag” played at Beyond Fest, Sitges Film Festival and the Festival du Nouveau Cinéma de Montréal. Tan Siyou’s “Amoeba,” a Singapore co-production, played at Toronto, while Thailand’s Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke brings “A Useful Ghost,” which won the Grand Prize at Cannes Critics’ Week. \n\n\tIndia’s Rohan Parashuram Kanawade competes with “Cactus Pears,” which won the World Cinema Grand Jury Prize at Sundance – the first Indian fiction film to achieve this honor. Compatriot Tribeny Rai’s Indo-Korean co-production “Shape of Momo” played at Busan, where it won the Taipei Film Commission Award and Songwon Vision Award, and also played at San Sebastián’s New Directors section. \n\n\tThai filmmaker Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit’s “Human Resource” played at Venice’s Horizons section, Busan, Vancouver and the BFI London Film Festival. \n\n\tJapan’s Sho Miyake presents “Two Seasons, Two Strangers,” which won the Golden Leopard at Locarno and played in competition at Busan. Sri Lanka’s Lalith Rathnayake competes with “Riverstone,” which won best script and best cinematography at the Shanghai International Film Festival’s Asian New Talent section.\n\n\tFrom China, Chen Deming’s documentary “Always” played at CPH:DOX, where it won the main prize, and also received the best film award at Jeonju. \n\n\tIranian filmmaker Shahram Mokri’s “Black Rabbit, White Rabbit,” a Tajikistan-UAE co-production, played at Busan and won the inaugural IFFI Vision Asia Award. The film also played at the BFI London Film Festival and Chicago International Film Festival, and has been selected as Tajikistan’s entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 98th Academy Awards.\n\t\n\n\tDeepa Mehta will receive the Cinema Honorary Award, and participate in In Conversation session. The festival will also showcase her acclaimed Elements trilogy – “Fire” (1996), “Earth” (1998) and “Water” (2005) – alongside “Funny Boy” (2020) in the Deepa Mehta in Focus retrospective as part of the festival’s Landmark section dedicated to newly restored classics.\n\n\tIntroduced in 2014, the Cinema Honorary Award celebrates filmmakers who have made exceptional and enduring contributions to Asian cinema. Past recipients include Japan’s Takashi Miike, Indonesia’s Garin Nugroho, and Iran’s Jafar Panahi in 2024.\n\n\t“I am pleased to receive the Cinema Honorary Award from the Singapore International Film Festival,” said Mehta. “Previous recipients of this accolade include filmmakers I really admire, and it is meaningful to be counted among them. We are living in uncertain times, where the general mantra in the geopolitical world, especially in art institutions, reverberates with what is politically correct. This vulnerability of the arts makes those of us involved in the creation and preservation of cinema more alert than ever as to the importance of our unique voices, ensuring they are not diluted by autocratic demands.”\n\n\tYoun Yuh-jung will receive the Screen Icon Award and also take part in an In Conversation session. \n\n\tThe festival’s Foreground section will feature a special presentation of “This City Is A Battlefield (Perang Kota),” welcoming Indonesian filmmaker Mouly Surya and lead actors Chicco Jerikho, Ariel Tatum and Jerome Kurnia. The seven-country co-production includes Singapore. The section opens with “Arco,” a hand-drawn animated feature co-presented with the vOilah! French Film Festival, with animator Adam Sillard in attendance.\n\n\tThe female-driven Landmark section expands from the Deepa Mehta showcase to include restored classics that trace a cinematic lineage of women who transformed Asian cinema. “The Arch” (1968) by T’ang Shushuen, Hong Kong’s first female film director, had its 4K restoration premiere at Cannes Classics earlier this year. “Gehenu Lamai (The Girls)” (1978) by Sumitra Peries, Sri Lanka’s first female filmmaker, also received a 4K restoration that premiered at Cannes Classics. “The Razor’s Edge” (1985) by Jocelyne Saab, Lebanon’s pioneering female filmmaker, rounds out the showcase.\n\t\n\n\t“At its heart, the film offers an intimate, autobiographical perspective, capturing the teenage struggles of living and surviving in a hostile adult world, while examining questions of identity, resilience and self-discovery,” said SGIFF Programme Director Thong Kay Wee about the opening film. “As a powerful gateway into the festival’s wider slate, ‘Girl’ invites audiences to connect personally with films that do not shy away from difficult, challenging topics, while reaffirming the festival’s commitment to programming works that embrace raw, human and authentic storytelling.”\n\n\tSGIFF is in active discussions with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth to include eligible local film programs under the SG Culture Pass, a nation-wide scheme to enhance Singaporeans’ access to local arts and heritage experiences. The festival’s industry platform, SGIFF Industry Days, will also return following its successful inaugural edition in 2024.\n\n\tThe Singapore International Film Festival runs from Nov. 26-Dec. 7.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBoxed sets celebrating classic rock albums offer the joy of discovery, in all those abandoned alternate versions being brought into the light as bonus tracks, but usually also some simultaneous historical relief: How interesting these early arrangements sound… and thank God they didn’t ultimately get stuck there. In all those Beatles early takes you can almost always pick out something that didn’t quite work, that they found a way to fix for the better at the last minute. For the most part, though, Bruce Springsteen’s “Nebraska ’82: Expanded Edition” isn’t like that. Hearing all the different versions of songs that appeared on “Nebraska” or his next album, “Born in the U.S.A.,” there’s rarely any sense of “Glad that road was not taken.” Nearly all the alternate takes put on view here are pretty great; it’s easy to start imagining a multiverse with completely different versions of “Nebraska” nearly as wonderful as the one we got 43 years ago.\n\t\n\n\tWhat those theoretical other versions wouldn’t have been, though, is influential — or at least impactful enough that somebody would have been making a feature film about them in 2025. In the run-up to Scott Cooper’s “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,” some wild claims have been made for the homemade, rough-hewn “Nebraska,” like: Bruce invented lo-fi! Not quite, but in spirit, close enough. In 1982, there was not yet a four-track cassette demo machine in every garage; “Unplugged” had not yet been invented; synths and garish, gated drum sounds were on the way in … and not many arena rockers were thinking, “How can I make a record that sounds like ‘Folkways meets Sun Studios’ — but with more murder?” Springsteen made a stripped-down aesthetic something that could forever after be defended in a corporate suite (if not always as successfully as in the slightly corny Columbia Records scenes in “Nowhere”). He made a record that didn’t just have edgy lyrics but sounded like someone cut a six-inch valley through the middle of his skull, to borrow a phrase.\n\t\n\n\tUltimately, we wouldn’t have wanted “Nebraska” any other way — but listening to the two discs of outtakes in this new set, you get glimpses of how it could have been executed differently and perhaps turned out just about as good, just not as culture-rattling. The most long-awaited component here is the disc labeled “Electric Nebraska,” which offers band versions of six songs that wound up as solo tracks on “Nebraska,” plus two that would go the opposite way and wind up bigger and slicker when finally heard on “Born in the USA.” The disc titled “Nebraska Outtakes,” meanwhile, includes solo recordings of nine compositions that didn’t make it onto “Nebraska,” making the case it could’ve been a terrific double-LP.\n\n\tBuyers also get two other discs: One is a remastering of the original album (given the aesthetic here, wouldn’t a de-mastering seem more apropos?). The other is a decent enough live performance of the album’s tracks filmed in stark (Starkweather?) B&W for Blu-Ray by longtime collaborator Thom Zimny. Springsteen went into the Count Basie Theatre in New Jersey to do this new rendering, joined in the subtlest possible way by two sidemen whose contributions are so slight, they’re practically sidelined. (Although these extra players are not as ghostly as the audience — there isn’t any.) It’s worth a look and a listen, to hear that material presented with a voice weathered by another 43 years, although the fandom would have found it more intriguing to see that stage overtaken by the E Street Band for an entire set of fresh rearrangements, not a replication of the original album with extra rasp. Anyway, better to hear Springsteen reinhabit these songs in the style to which everyone has become accustomed than not get a contemporary take at all.\n\n\tBut what you are really here for is the soul of the departures … that is, all those ‘82 outtakes. With “Electric Nebraska,” are these E Street Band renditions really the nirvana that fans have hungered to hear for four-plus decades? Yes and no — some of them don’t quite come off, but some are stunning. Although he clearly made the right overall call in not making “Nebraska” a band album after all, if you’re the type of person who can hold opposing thoughts, you may come away thinking that at least a couple of these songs really do feel superior jacked up for the E Street Band, or a few members thereof. \n\t\n\n\tThe real keepers are a trio of songs Springsteen recorded with just two E Streeters as a “rockabilly punk” power trio: “Open All Night,” “Born in the U.S.A.” and “Reason to Believe.” This is where the biggest what if comes into play. What if he’d gotten around to recording all the ”Nebraska” material with that particular tight unit on that particular day? Then the resulting album could well have been a very different masterpiece in its own right. He did not keep going, at least in this wing of the multiverse, so we can be glad for the three we’re getting in that style; to my mind, that trio merits thinking about as its own EP.\n\n\tAs for the remaining five tracks on “Electric Nebraska” that feature the full E Street lineup, perhaps only the version of “Born in the U.S.A.” that was released as this collection’s first teaser track is that galvanizing. But there are no outright clinkers in the bunch, either. The two that comes the closest to just not working on this disc are “Johnny 99” and “Downbound Train.” They’re too fleshed out — and to be specific, they both sporting roadhouse-piano parts that make what we know to be woeful tunes sound altogether too jolly. Roy Bittan is an eternal agent of happiness, of course, but a musical smile is not what those songs require; I think this marks the first time in history when I’ve thought whether a recording would sound better stripped of his piano.\n\n\tBut then, you can feel Springsteen wrestling through a lot of these unreleased takes about whether to accentuate the inherent darkness of the songwriting or to filter that through a brilliant disguise. It’s always been fascinating to do a compare-and-contrast on the “Nebraska” and “Born in the U.S.A.” albums in that regard, with the former LP eager to wallow in depression and the latter a little more inclined to wiggle through it. With the eventual release of the songs “Born in the U.S.A.” and “Working on the Highway,” Springsteen ultimately came down on the side of an ebullience that is in no way suggested by the lyrics. That was a great call on his part — we’re all grown-ups, we can handle irony — but in his earlier attempts, it also feelings valuable to hear him escort these songs to the lesser-lit side of town.\n\n\tOf any of the songs from this period, “Working on the Highway” went through the most fascinating  transformations. It appears twice on the “Nebraska Outtakes” disc, sort of. First it arrives as a substantially but not wholly different composition called “Child Bride,” which is, obviously from the title, an extremely “Nebraska”-ian take on a tune that Springsteen had not yet had the audacity to reimagine as a rockabilly rave-up. To play up that the narrator has run afoul of the law for marrying an underage girl, or to bury the lede there and just emphasize the deep fun of forced prison-gang labor? It’s not exactly surprising Springsteen went the way he did, but you’ve got to admire the brute integrity of the song’s beginnings.\n\t\n\n\t“Child Bride,” if you count it as a separate song apart from “Working on the Highway,” is one of four previously unreleased titles that appear in Springsteen’s solo sessions, included here on the “Nebraska Outtakes” disc. Even if none of them was essential, all four would have been worthy additions to “Nebraska” if it’d been released in the first wave of CDs, where longer albums were suddenly de rigueur, instead of toward the tail end of the original vinyl era. “On the Prowl” would’ve added a nice color just for how primal, even feral, it is. “Losin’ Kind” is probably the weakest of the four, as a somewhat narratively overwrought tale of just how wrong a night with a prostitute can go, although it’s hard to turn down any Springsteen song that ends with a wreck on the highway, isn’t it? \n\n\tProbably the most interesting of the four unheard compositions is “Gun in Every Home,” in which nothing nearly so dramatic happens, but that’s part of why it would’ve offered a slightly different color to the album. Yes, there’s a gun in the first act, but it doesn’t go off in the third; the fact that the threat is violence is placed in an affluent neighborhood gets at how paranoia infiltrates the suburbs, too, and hardly just forsaken small towns.\n\n\tKind of the coolest thing about the “Outtakes” disc, though, is how it includes discarded solo recordings that have more early-Elvis energy than those that made the album. Imagine a “Nebraska” with “Pink Cadillac” on it! That sounds wrong, right? But that and a few other alternate versions of familiar tunes sound like something that could have come out of Memphis, suggesting a possible version of the album that could have balanced out the brooding with some greasy fun.\n\n\tBut no one should regret that the final LP was streamlined to be more of a downer. Arguably, the Reagan years demanded it, to fully consider the power outage in that shining city on a hill — or that mansion on the hill — before Springsteen lit everything up again with “Born in the U.S.A.” After his simpler-sounding one-off, we would never feel so simple again.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 45th Hawai’i International Film Festival wrapped its awards ceremony with a reception at the Halekulani Hotel, distributing $58,000 in prizes across categories celebrating international cinema, Pacific Island storytelling and homegrown Hawai’i talent.\n\n\tLeon Le’s “Ky Nam Inn,” a tender Vietnam-set drama exploring grief and desire in post-conflict Saigon, claimed the Kau Ka Hōkū (Shooting Star) Award presented by Hawaiian Airlines. The prize recognizes emerging filmmakers working on their first or second feature.\n\t\n\n\t“Elegance and simplicity can be deceptive — they require deep intention and precision to resonate so deeply,” the jury said of the film, which follows a young translator and an older widow navigating unspoken emotions. “Through its beautiful weaving of poetry, music, and literature, ‘Ky Nam’ not only tells a story — it reminds us of the quiet power of artistry rooted in humanity.”\n\n\n\tThe jury comprised Academy Award-nominated producer Diane Quon, Third Culture Content co-founder Janica Chua and David Magdael & Associates founder David Magdael.\n\n\tDaniel H. Lin’s “Remathau: People of the Ocean” captured the Pasifika Award and its $5,000 cash prize. The documentary follows Micronesian explorer Nicole Yamase as she descends to the Mariana Trench while uncovering her identity and ancestral legacies.\n\n\t“Our Pasifika Award recipient shines a light on the islands of Micronesia – often abused, misunderstood, and overlooked,” the jury stated. “Nicole, you are indeed our future and our hope.”\n\n\tThe Pasifika jury featured Heather Guigni, founder of Uluʻulu at UH West Oʻahu; filmmaker Alika Tengan; and Catherine Cruz, host of “The Conversation” on Hawai’i Public Radio. The award is presented in partnership with Pacific Islanders in Communications.\n\t\n\n\tIn a rare tie, two films shared the Best Made in Hawai’i Feature honor: Matty Schweizter’s “Lahaina Rising,” chronicling the nonprofit Lahaina Strong’s fight for accountability after the devastating wildfires, and Kimberlee Bassford’s “Before the Moon Falls,” a documentary following trailblazing Samoan writer Sia Figiel through soaring triumphs and devastating setbacks, offering a profound meditation on the fragile line between creativity and madness.\n\n\tAlexander Bocchieri’s “Dasher” won Best Made in Hawai’i Short, with Sonny Ganaden’s “The Arrangements” receiving an honorable mention. The Made in Hawai’i program, now in its ninth year, has awarded $1.3 million in cash, equipment and production services to local filmmakers to date, supported by the Hawai’i Film Office.\n\n\tHao Zhou’s “Correct Me If I’m Wrong,” a China-Germany co-production exploring a Southwest Chinese family’s struggle with their queer heir’s identity, took Best International Short. The Academy Award-qualifying prize came with praise from jurors for its “vulnerable and personal storytelling that delicately immortalizes a heartbreaking practice with grace.” Hung Yi Wu’s “The Fishbowl Girl” earned an honorable mention for bold directorial vision.\n\n\tKath Akuhata-Brown’s “Kōkā” won the Netpac Award, selected by the jury for “its magical and moving intergenerational journey of healing and reconciliation through language, culture and community.” HIFF is the only U.S. festival authorized to present the Network for the Promotion of Asian-Pacific Cinema award, which is given at major fests including Berlin, Cannes, Venice and Toronto.\n\n\tThe festival also presented special honors to industry figures. Japanese director and action choreographer Kenji Tanigaki received the Halekulani Maverick Award for his nearly three-decade career spanning titles including “Rurouni Kenshin,” “Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In” and “The Furious,” which world premiered at Toronto’s Midnight Madness strand.\n\n\tComedian and performer Yuriyan Retriever claimed the Halekulani Vanguard Award, HIFF’s “rising star” honor. The Japanese talent, who became the country’s top solo comedian and gained international attention from “America’s Got Talent,” recently made her directorial debut with “Mag Mag,” a meta J-horror satire produced by K2 Pictures.\n\t\n\n\tThe Leanne K. Ferrer Trailblazer Award, presented by Pacific Islanders in Communications, went to the Kānaka Maoli and Pacific Islander creative team behind Apple TV’s “Chief of War.” The series, created by Pa’a Sibbett and Jason Momoa, marks a historic achievement in bringing Hawaiian history, language and identity to the screen at a major production scale.\n\n\tVeteran actress Nina Paw received recognition as this year’s Hong Kong Filmmaker in Profile spotlight. Her career peaked with Ann Hui’s “The Way We Are” (2008), earning her Best Actress honors at both the Hong Kong Film Awards and Hong Kong Film Critics Society Awards. HIFF screened the U.S. premiere of Juno Mak’s “Sons of the Neon Night,” co-starring Paw.\n\n\tThe BMW Hawaii Driven Student Filmmaker Award went to Tiffany Liu, with honorable mentions for Hunter Daru’s “The Remover” and Lucas Stenvens’ “Clean.exe.”\n\n\t“This year’s theme of convergence reflects the heart of HIFF over the last decade, where stories, cultures, and generations come together through the shared language of cinema,” said Beckie Stocchetti, HIFF executive director. “The 45th edition award winners reflect both the artistic excellence of our filmmakers and their commitment to truth, community, and the spirit of aloha that connects us all.”\n\n\tAudience Awards for Favorite Narrative Feature, Documentary and Short Film, presented by Hawai’i News Now, will be announced Nov. 17 following neighbor island screenings.\n\n\tHIFF45 WINNERS:\n\n\tKau Ka Hōkū Award:“Ky Nam Inn” (Vietnam) Director: Leon Le\n\n\tPasifika Award:“Remathau: People of the Ocean” (U.S.) Director: Daniel H.

At the Middleburg Film Festival, the Audience Award ended in a second consecutive year of a tie between two awards hopefuls: Focus Features’ “Hamnet,” Chloé Zhao’s intimate adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s novel, and Searchlight’s “Rental Family,” Hikari’s offbeat and emotionally resonant dramedy. \n\n\tMeanwhile, AFI Fest opened with 20th Century Studios’ “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,” Scott Cooper’s biopic chronicling the making of Nebraska, which opens nationwide this weekend. \n\n\tAnd down south, the SCAD Savannah Film Festival kicks off Saturday with A24’s “Eternity,” a high-concept romance that premiered at Toronto and has its fair share of fans. \n\n\tUpdated predictions are below.\n\n\tTop 3 projected Oscar nomination leaders (films): “One Battle After Another” and “Sinners” (13); “Hamnet” (11); “Wicked: For Good” (10)\n\n\tTop 3 projected Oscar nomination leaders (studios): Warner Bros.

Chronicle says they asked Maritn if he was armed, to which he replied \"Kinda\" ... though he wouldn't clarify what he meant by that. When they allegedly tried to search Martin, he reportedly became agitated and resisted a police officer's attempt to handcuff him. Officers allegedly found three bags of cocaine and a 12-inch chef’s knife on Martin at the time.\n      \n    \n          The incident resulted in Martin being put on a 72-hour psychiatric hold, and the San Francisco Chronicle reports the charges were likely going to be sent to the prosecutor's office for review ... however, it's unclear if anyone looked it over before his untimely death.\n      \n    \n          We broke the story ... Doug passed away while in police custody after a break-in at an Oakland home. Martin's family had called authorities earlier in the evening for \"medical assistance.\"\n      \n    \n          According to the family, Doug had become disoriented earlier in the evening ... which resulted in him leaving the home and entering a neighbor's residence a couple doors down. Oakland Police said responding officers had a \"brief struggle\" with Martin during his detainment and he became unresponsive. He was rushed to the hospital, where he ultimately died.\n      \n    \n          Doug was 36.\n      \n    \n          RIP\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Doug Martin\n              \n                          \n                RIP\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Death\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Drugs & Alcohol\n              \n                          \n                Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n              \n                          \n                NFL\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

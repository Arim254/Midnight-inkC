    "body": "\n\tTaskovski Films has come on board as the sales agent for “We Have to Survive,” which has its world premiere at the Thessaloniki Intl. Documentary Festival, which runs March 5-15.\n\n\tThe film, written and directed by Tomáš Krupa, reveals the challenges of a changing world, and the quiet strength of those living through it, illustrated with a number of character-driven stories.\n\n\tThe film travels from the fragile Outer Banks of the U.S., where the ocean slowly reclaims the land, to the vast Mongolian desert, where a family plants trees against the wind, and on to the underground town of Coober Pedy in Australia, where people build their lives beneath the burning earth, and the icy shores of Greenland, where ancient fishing traditions have new beginnings.\n\t\n\n\tIrena Taskovski, head of acquisitions at Taskovski Films, says: “ ‘We Have to Survive’ brings us face to face with lives already reshaped by a changing climate. But it is not just the scale of the crisis, but the human dignity, and care that emerge within it. These stories remind us that climate change is not distant, it is lived, shared, and deeply human. At a time when the future can feel uncertain, Tomáš Krupa’s film offers something essential: a sense of connection, responsibility, and a reminder that we are all under the same sky.”\n\n\n\tThe film is produced by Krupa for Hailstone. The co-producers are Christian Popp (Yuzu Productions), Peter Drössler (Golden Girls Film), and Arash T. Riahi (Golden Girls Film). Cinematography is by Martin Čech and Ondřej Szollos.\n\n\tKrupa was the recipient of the Sun in a Net National Film Award, the IGRIC Film and TV National Award, and the Slovak Film Critics’ Award for his feature documentary “The Good Death” (2018).\n\t\n\n\tIn 2013, he founded his production company, Hailstone, which focuses on creative documentaries and art-house feature films.\n\n\tHis profile was recognized internationally when he was selected for the Emerging Producers 2020 program, presented at Ji.hlava Intl. Documentary Festival. Most recently, he co-produced the Austrian-Slovak historical drama “Perla,” which won Best Austrian Film at Viennale in 2025.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Sinners” and “One Battle After Another” took home  the live action feature awards at the 76th ACE Eddie Awards.\n\n\t“Sinners” editor Michael Shawver said, “Ryan Coogler took a big risk, and I think gave audiences something that maybe they didn’t even know they were hungry for something new, different, fun, and total experience.”\n\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters” took home the award for best edited animated feature film. The awards were handed out Friday night at UCLA’s Royce Hall, and to Oscar watchers provided insight into the Oscars race for best editing. The winners in best film drama editing and best film comedy/musical editing has gone on to match the best editing Oscar 17 times in the past 26 years.\n\n\t“The Perfect Neighbor” took home the award for best edited documentary. The Netflix documentary is also nominated for an Oscar in the best documentary category.\n\t\n\n\tDamian Rodriguez who won best edited documentary series for “Pee-wee as Himself” – Part One dedicated his win to team and Paul Reuben. Rodriguez said, “We wouldn’t be here without him. He was such an amazing artist, and he influenced so many people, including myself. I wish he was here.”\n\n\tOn the TV side, “The Studio” and “The Pitt” won in their respective categories for best edited comedy and best edited drama.\n\n\tThe ACE Eddies recognize outstanding editing in film, television, documentaries, shorts and digital content. Ang Lee received the ACE Golden Eddie Filmmaker of the Year Award. Kim Larson & YouTube Will were honored with the ACE Visionary Award, and Film Editors Arthur Forney, ACE, and Robert Leighton were given ACE Career Achievement Awards.\n\n\tLee dedicated his award to his go-to editor Tim Squyres. “When you give me this award, you actually give me it to Tim Squyres.” Lee shared how Squyres had cut all his movies except “Brokeback Mountain.” “He missed that one because I told him, after ‘Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,’  I’m retiring, I said ‘I had enough.’ So he took another movie.” Lee said he had stuck with Squyres for over 35 years. \n\t\n\n\tSpeaking about what editing means to Lee, he said, “It’s very hard to say, but let me put this way, my wife said, I can only do two things, right, making movies and cooking. So let me use cooking as a metaphor. Shooting is like buying groceries, and the real cooking is on the editing table. That’s how I feel about editing. I’ve feel I have this editing machine in my head when I’m making movies, every section, every setup, editing is at the center of my consciousness. Every working day I have to answer, hundreds of questions about what I want. The only reason I can give directions and put the whole movie together is because I have that editing table in my head.” Lee added, “We’re in a particularly difficult moment, challenging moment, in our life of cinema. But I do believe, as long as there is as long as there are moving images, there will be editors.”\n\n\tErin Casper who won best edited short for “All The Empty Rooms” that goes into the bedrooms of children killed in US school shootings, dedicated her win to the victims and the families “who opened their doors to us and welcomed us into their sacred spaces of their child’s bedroom preserved just as it was since the last day they saw their child alive.” She went on to say, “The word gun is never mentioned in our film, and this was intentional on our part, because we’ve all grown so numb to this epidemic.”\n\n\tShe said their goal was to center the humanity and “the life that was in these rooms.”\n\n\t“South Park’s” Twisted Christian episode won best edited animated series. During his acceptance speech, editor David List said, “It was especially gratifying to work on these last 10 episodes because Trey and Matt really, really went for it. They challenged the boundaries of censorship and how far all of us can exercise our First Amendment rights, whether it’s political commentary, mocking celebrity or that expertly timed fart joke.” He added, “Our freedom of speech should ultimately be protected and celebrated regardless of political party affiliation.”\n\n\tFull list of winners below.\n\t\n\n\tEDITED FEATURE FILM (Drama, Theatrical)“Sinners”Michael P.

    "body": "\n\tSusan Sarandon is speaking out about her current film and television career, saying that after she spoke out and called for a ceasefire in Gaza that she was unable to take on roles in the United States.\n\n\t“I was fired by my agency, specifically for marching and speaking out about Gaza, for asking for a ceasefire,” Sarandon said. “It became impossible for me to even be on television. I don’t know lately if it’s changed. I couldn’t do any major film or anything connected with Hollywood. I found agents ultimately in England and in Italy, and I work there. I just did a film in Italy, and I did a play at the Old Vic for a number of months. I know this Italian director that just hired me — he was told not to hire me, so that’s still recently. He didn’t listen, but they had that conversation. Right now, I kind of specialize in tiny films with directors who have never directed, in independent films.”\n\t\n\n\tThe “Thelma and Louise” star also said that Spain has more intellectual freedom than the United States.\n\n\n\t“In a place where you feel repression and censorship, to see Spain and to see the president and what he says and the support that he’s giving about Gaza, and to have actors like Javier Bardem come forward with such a strong voice, is so important to us in the United States,” she said.\n\n\tHer comments came during a Feb. 27 discussion ahead of receiving the International Goya award in recognition of her career, including “Dead Man Walking” and “Atlantic City.” The Spanish Film Academy’s Goya Awards ceremony is set to take place on Feb. 28 in Barcelona.\n\n\tIn 2023, Sarandon was dropped by UTA after she spoke at a pro-Palestine rally in New York City.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the full discussion below, courtesy of Reuters.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe official “Survivor” podcast is hitting pause for Season 50.\n\n\t“‘Survivor’ 50 was designed as a celebration, and it features one of the most exciting game designs we’ve ever done,” Probst said in a statement to Variety. “Because of that, we made a conscious decision not to immediately pull back the curtain while it was happening. We wanted fans to discover it on their own and experience it in real time. Then at the live finale, we’ll have the opportunity to reflect on all parts of the season together.”\n\t\n\n\t“On Fire With Jeff Probst” debuted at the start of Season 44 in 2023. Each week, directly after a new episode aired on CBS, a new episode would reveal Probst giving listeners a look behind the curtain at the making of “Survivor,” sharing his view as the executive producer, showrunner and host.\n\n\n\tRick Devens joined Probst and producer Jay Wolff as co-host for Season 45; Dee Valladares co-hosted for 46; Charlie Davis joined for Season 47; Rachel LaMont took over for 48; and Jeremy Collins joined for 49.\n\n\t“Survivor” 50 premiered on Feb. 25 and averaged 5.06 million viewers over its three-hour debut — the biggest same-day audience for Season 45’s penultimate episode in December 2023. It became CBS’ best Wednesday night performance since the Season 42 finale of “Survivor” in 2022.\n\n\tThe milestone “Survivor” is a huge one for CBS and Probst, as they introduce new twists, fan voting and celebrity twists. During the premiere, a Billie Eilish idol was revealed; a Jimmy Fallon twist and integration of Zac Brown and Mr. Beast will come later in the season — but the game won’t change, Probst promises.\n\t\n\n\t“I think it’s a legitimate concern when you start adding layers like celebrities, that they can overshadow the game and take it off course,” he told Variety. “Our job was to make sure that we stayed true to what we’re doing on ‘Survivor,’ which is exploring this continuous social experiment. And now we’re adding another layer.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tTed Sarandos had just wrapped up a White House meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday when Warner Bros. Discovery released a statement ",
    "body": "\n\tTed Sarandos had just wrapped up a White House meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday when Warner Bros. Discovery released a statement announcing that Paramount’s latest bid for the media company was a “superior proposal” to the one that Netflix had offered. With his deal to buy the 100-year-old film and television giant hanging in the balance, Sarandos quickly consulted with a key team of executives, which included CFO Spencer Neumann and his co-CEO Greg Peters, who had been overseeing Netflix’s bid for Warners, sources say.\n\t\n\n\tUnder the terms of its agreement to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix had four business days to equal or surpass a better offer. But the numbers didn’t lie. Paramount was now willing to pay $31 per share to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its struggling cable business. Netflix, which only wanted Warners’ studio and streaming business, did not want to dramatically enhance its bid of $27.75 per share. Sarandos didn’t see the point of dragging things out.\n\n\n\t“If you know you’re not going to match an offer on day one, why wait until day four?” a source with knowledge of the deliberations said. \n\n\tSarandos placed a call to David Zaslav, Warner Bros. Discovery’s CEO, to let him know the streamer was walking away from a pact that would have given Netflix control of a library that included everything from Harry Potter to Batman and Tony Soprano. Then Sarandos and Peters released a joint statement in which they said, “We’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive.”\n\t\n\n\t“This transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price,” they added. \n\n\tAn internal email was sent out to Netflix staffers that hit similar notes; namely that the streamer didn’t want to overextend itself and would concentrate on growing organically rather than by acquisitions, as it has done for most of its nearly 30-year history. However, the brave face put on by the co-CEOs could not shade the truth that the company had been gearing up for what was likely to be a transformational acquisition — and then suddenly, it wasn’t.\n\n\t“This deal could have accelerated Netflix’s growth on top of a strong existing trajectory by attracting new subscribers, reducing churn and driving more engagement,” wrote Robert Fishman, media analyst with MoffettNathanson Research. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn December, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav hosted Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters on the Warner Bros. Studio lot to meet with leaders across the company.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoe Pugliese and John Nowak for Warner Bros. Discovery\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNetflix was wholeheartedly preparing for a regulatory fight to close the deal at the moment earlier this month that it agreed to WBD’s unusual request for a waiver from the merger agreement reached on Dec. 5 in order to hold negotiations with Paramount Skydance, according to an individual with knowledge of the situation. At the same time, WBD’s board was under pressure from investors and corporate watchdogs to engage with Paramount Skydance, which went from making unsolicited offers last fall to filing a lawsuit against WBD in January in an effort to force it to disclose more details about the valuation methodology used in reaching Netflix’s $27.75 per share offer. It all added up to a lot of noise. Netflix was ready to fight fire with fire — until Sarandos and Peters decided to bow out. That decision too — described by one observer as “putting shareholder value above executive ego” — is drawing praise from the investment community.\n\n\t“It signals that Netflix believes in its internal growth story enough to maintain M&A discipline. We also believe the future Paramount Skydance Warner Bros. Discovery — they’ll need a better name — could finally transform two subscale media companies into a more serious industry player, provided management has the financial flexibility to execute on its vision,” Fishman wrote.\n\t\n\n\tParamount’s new owner, David Ellison, has been relentless in his pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery, working his connections on Capitol Hill, while making a spirited case that his company was offering a better deal for shareholders. This month, he and his team pulled off what many analysts and industry figures thought was impossible, forcing Warner Bros. Discovery to come back to the negotiating table.\n\n\tAnd Ellison was determined to make the most of the opportunity. While fine-tuning his pitch, he relied on a core team of trusted advisors and board members such as Safra Katz, Justin Hamill and Gerry Cardinale. Paramount’s Chief Operating Officer Andy Gordon worked closely with his investor relations group and advisor Faiza Saeed of the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Melissa Zukerman, Paramount’s chief communications officer, also was involved in the strategy sessions. Conspicuously absent from all WBD-related proceedings was Paramount president Jeff Shell, who is currently embroiled in controversy over allegations he leaked sensitive financials in CBS’ $7 billion UFC deal.\n\n\tDuring the seven-day negotiating period that ran Feb. 17 to Feb. 23, WBD and Paramount Skydance leaders never once met as a group in person. All the discussions were held via video conference calls, emails and by phone. There was an evident chill — or at least lack of chumminess — between the sides. Some of that has to do with the tangled history between the players. Paramount’s unsolicited offer to buy WBD last September set off a domino effect that forced Zaslav and his team to hold an auction for the company much sooner than they had planned. And Paramount’s desire to buy WBD’s linear cable channels derailed the plan that was in the works to spin them off into a standalone company dubbed Discovery Global.\n\n\tDespite the bad blood, a weekend of virtual talks between Paramount and WBD saw Ellison’s ninth offer sweetened from $30 per share to $31. Paramount also offered shareholders a “ticking fee” for each quarter the acquisition might be stuck in the regulatory process. It was an offer David Zaslav couldn’t refuse.\n\n\tEllison was taking meetings at Skydance’s sleek Santa Monica headquarters on Friday when word came down that the path had been cleared for Paramount to take WBD. Shortly before Netflix publicly bowed out, champagne was rolled into the executive suite at Paramount’s Melrose lot. The mood was ebullient, partly because while Netflix deemed Warner Bros. “nice to have,” Ellison always saw the studio as “must have” if he was going to realize his ambitions to create a new media leviathan.\n\t\n\n\tBut now comes the even harder part. If Paramount is able to secure regulatory approval, a process that insiders predict will take at least a year, it will have to find a way to grow the company’s streaming business while overseeing the decline of cable. And it will have to pull off that transition while servicing more than $78 billion in debt. That’s left some industry executives skeptical that Paramount will make good on its promise to increase its output of streaming programming, while making 30 theatrical film releases a year, the most of any studio by a wide margin.\n\n\tIndeed, if the WBD transaction is completed, Team Ellison will have an even steeper climb to bring the enlarged Paramount back to the summit of Hollywood. The vertical merger of Paramount and Warner Bros.’ film and TV studio operations is guaranteed to be a bloodbath of layoffs and a senior management “Game of Thrones” environment as the new regime decides who stays and who goes between Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures as well as Warner Bros. Television, CBS Studios and Paramount Television Studios, among many other imprints. The same questions loom over HBO Max and Paramount+ and the management of WBD’s large portfolio of linear cable channels that include CNN, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, Food Network and HGTV.\n\n\tGiven the behind the scenes drama that has enveloped CBS News since Ellison took over Paramount Skydance, the mood was grim at CNN after the news broke in real time Thursday. One persistent sentiment shared by staffers from various divisions of WBD was what one studio insider described as “complete and total fucking merger fatigue.”\n\n\tIf completed, the Paramount transaction will mark the third time that Warner Bros., HBO, CNN, TNT and other channels have been sold to new owners just since 2018, when AT&T sealed its purchase of Time Warner, after winning an antitrust trial in the first Trump administration. That was followed in 2022 by the WarnerMedia merger with Zaslav’s Discovery Inc. In both cases, WB and HBO endured a long period of limbo while legal and regulatory processes ensued. And all of that has unfolded under the backdrop of massive disruption across the entertainment business.\n\n\tWBD troops were bracing for another long merger slog regardless. But as the tables turned quickly on Thursday afternoon, many rank and file staffers expressed regret that the studio would not be hitched to the industry’s dominant subscription streaming platform but rather to a smaller, struggling rival legacy media conglomerate. There is great skepticism about Ellison’s ability to make the high-wire act work while Paramount Skydance shoulders a mountain of debt supplied by a consortium that includes Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds.\n\t\n\n\t“Debt is debt,” says Rick Morris, a professor at Northwestern University’s School of Communication. “Debt will stop them from taking new initiatives, from investing in content, and it’ll take a period of time to work off. And many companies fail at working off the debt, and that is part of the reason that Warner Bros. is for sale.”\n\n\tThere is little doubt that Paramount Skydance will make massive cuts to WBD operations for the sake of de-leveraging the balance sheet. If all goes as planned, the company will carry a debt ratio of nearly 7 times its annual earnings — a huge red flag for credit agencies and many investors. Paramount has pledged to swiftly cut its debt-to-earnings ratio down to 4.4 times earnings, which means finding billions of dollars in cost savings from the jump. The WBD transaction is backed up to an unprecedented degree by a guarantee made by Larry Ellison against his personal fortune, buoyed by shares in Oracle, the software giant that he co-founded in 1977 when computing was in its infancy. Larry Ellison is also on the hook to invest many more billions should the enlarged Paramount Skydance struggle to maintain enough cash flow to support operations.\n\n\tLaurent Yoon, media analyst with Bernstein, sees WBD as a necessity for Paramount but one that will not be easy on the rank and file tasked with running the businesses.\n\n\t“Overpaying for WBD to accelerate growth is perhaps better than facing a mediocre standalone trajectory — at least this gives [Paramount] a shot at greatness, in our view.. But we do not expect them to come out swinging too hard,” Yoon wrote in a Feb. 26 research note. “Before they can invest in growth, they’ll need to cut deep and fast, and allocate most of their free cash flow to interest expense and de-levering. This is effectively the same position WBD was in from ‘22 (post-merger) through ‘25, a period that constrained growth despite having quality studios and IPs.”\n\n\tIn the Netflix-WBD merger scenario, filmmakers were concerned about Netflix’s commitment to the theatrical business, noting that Sarandos had earlier dismissed cinemas as “outdated.” That left them skeptical of the company’s promises that it would continue to release Warners films on the big screen and honor traditional home entertainment windows. Paramount, in contrast, has loudly argued that it is the true defender of the cinematic experience and has promised to increase the number of films that the combined studios will release in theaters.\n\t\n\n\tYet having Paramount own Warners Bros. Discovery has raised other concerns for artists, some of whom worry that Ellison’s coziness with the Trump administration will stifle free expression. They’ve been alarmed by his moves at CBS News, where he has installed Bari Weiss, a conservative columnist best known for her anti-woke jeremiads, as editor-in-chief. It’s expected that Weiss will have a big role in steering CNN down the road.\n\n\t“Ellison scares the shit out of me,” says one A-list director. “Are the movies they put out going to be catered to Trump’s taste? Are they going to start cracking down on content that they don’t find to be ideologically aligned with the right?” \n\n\tEllison has earned that skepticism. In his aggressive pursuit of WBD, he has not been shy about flexing his family’s wealth (his father Larry Ellison is one of the world’s richest men) and connections to President Donald Trump. In lobbying publicly and privately for Paramount’s unsolicited WBD bids, Team Ellison sought to amp up concerns about Netflix exerting monopoly power over the streaming pay TV marketplace and having the ability to dictate pricing and deal terms for Hollywood’s creative community. The Ellisons also made their case to regulators in the U.K. and European Union, which have a track record of tougher enforcement of antitrust and concentration issues. David Ellison went so far as to attend Trump’s State of the Union address to Congress Tuesday as a guest of Sen. Lindsey Graham, a key confidant of the president. One observer compared Ellison’s trek to the Capitol earlier this week to the row of tech leaders who attended Trump’s inauguration in January 2025 — an image that has become symbolic of the fact that big business and moguls — the likes of Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook — are kowtowing to Trump’s authoritarian style of leadership.\n\n\t“This process speaks volumes,” says J. Christopher Hamilton, a professor of Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Public Communications and an attorney. “Companies don’t have to go behind the scenes any longer to court lawmakers and this administration doesn’t feel like it has to be subtle about who it wants to reward and who it prefers to own businesses.”\n\n\tNetflix’s Sarandos also invested in personally lobbying political leaders on the merits of the deal. He endured a two-hour grilling in the Senate at a hearing on Feb. 4 that demonstrated the depth of the fight that Netflix would face. In addition to federal pressure, state attorneys general are lining up to launch their own local probes into the transaction. Now they will focus more on vertical-merger issues for two companies with mostly overlapping operations versus the specter of monopoly power — a loaded term that raised the stakes for Netflix no matter how many times Sarandos pointed to independent Nielsen audience data showing that even combining the streaming service with HBO did not rise to the level of what is traditionally considered to be a monopoly-level of market share.\n\t\n\n\tOn Friday, as Netflix staffers digested all the news, more than a few executives expressed the feeling that the streamer may have dodged a bullet. And for their troubles, Paramount Skydance will pay them the $2.8 billion breakup fee that Netflix negotiated in the agreement it inked with WBD’s board on Dec. 5.\n\n\t“I think there’s a sense of relief on the Netflix side that we came close to getting it, and now we have an out and we got paid for the time we spent doing it. There’s some disappointment in not getting what you want and a relief that you didn’t get it,” said a senior entertainment lawyer with knowledge of the situation.\n\n\tNow, as the town’s attention shifts from the bidding war to what is likely to be a war of attrition, there are fears that the union of Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures will result in one fewer buyer of films — and that WB will be hamstrung on dealmaking and big long-term swings while it waits for the sale to close. Already, filmmakers say that it’s taking longer for them to get an answer from the studio on the status of their projects, noting that the company is wary of committing too much money to new films when a different ownership team is waiting in the wings.\n\n\tEllison’s politics have alarmed many in left-leaning Hollywood, but some people are impressed with the executive team he has installed at Paramount. Josh Greenstein, who was brought over from Sony Pictures to help oversee the film studio with Dana Goldberg, has earned high marks for making tough calls on film projects, while urging the studio to land splashy projects from the likes of James Mangold and Timothée Chalamet.\n\n\t“Josh is the real deal,” says one media executive who has worked with him. “He is a straight shooter. And in a matter of months he’s stocked a cupboard that was bare.” \n\n\tAt the same time, Warner Bros. Pictures has been on an unprecedented roll at the box office since the second half of 2025, after enduring some painful flops in 2024 and early in 2025. To many, it feels as though just as WB Pictures chiefs Pam Abdy and Michael De Luca were hitting their stride with commercial and critical successes — the studio’s “Sinners” and “One Battle After Another” are this year’s top film award season contenders — the executive turnstiles are about to swing once again.\n\t\n\n\t“If they’re smart, they’ll keep Mike and Pam,” says the media executive. “But there’s only so much executive power to go around. Decisions will need to be made.” \n\n\tFor Paramount, the road ahead will be paved with key management and strategic decisions, as well as a herculean effort to revitalize two media giants that have often struggled to navigate the streaming era. Up the road from Paramount’s Melrose lot in Hollywood, Netflix brass also face momentous decisions about their future. But first they’ll need to figure out what to do with the $2.8 billion check that Paramount wrote them on Friday. Think of it as a dowry that a jilted suitor gets to keep.\n\n\tMatt Donnelly and Todd Longwell contributed to this report. \n",

    "body": "\n\tZack Snyder joined the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast to mark the 10th anniversary of “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” his highly-divisive comic book movie that opened to negative reviews on March 25, 2016 but went on to gross a mighty $874 million worldwide. The tentpole was Snyder’s sequel to the already-polarizing “Man of Steel,” which sent comic book fans into a tizzy for depicting Superman killing Zod, and “BvS” only divided fans further with Batman killing criminals, the two heroes bonding over their moms both being named Martha and more. \n\t\n\n\t“My 100% honest reaction to ‘BvS’ and how it’s received in the world is… Do you really want a movie that’s had all the edges shaved off it by the focus groups?” Snyder said in defense of the movie 10 years later. “Do you really want a movie where the decisions have been made in a boardroom, or tested ideas have been rendered for your enjoyment? Do you really want the Kmart version of your story? Is that what you really want?”\n\n\n\t“Batman v Superman” was the second movie in Snyder’s DC Universe, dubbed the ‘SnyderVerse’ online by his legion of fans. “Justice League” came next with its own polarizations after Snyder left the production due to a family tragedy and the studio brought in Joss Whedon to rewrite scenes and conduct reshoots. This led to a social media movement of Snyder fans calling Warner Bros to release the “Snyder Cut” of “Justice League,” which the studio permitted. “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” debuted on HBO Max in 2021.\n\n\t“I love the mythological journey we went on in these three movies,” Snyder said. “The intensity of where we ended up with ‘Justice League’ and how it evovled and where it came from. That whole insanity. When we were trying for the PG-13 rating on ‘BvS,’ the MPAA kept kicking the movie back to us saying, ‘It’s still an R.’ I remember someone saying we got a report from the MPA saying, ‘We just don’t like the idea of Batman fighting Superman. That kind of makes it an R. He really hits him hard with that sink. That’s rude. That feels like an R.’ I’m just like, ‘Okay… let’s just pretend it’s not Batman vs. Superman for one second.'”\n\t\n\n\t“You realize then that we were kicking the zeitgeist in the nuts and that we were going to anger people,” Snyder continued. “Not only do they not want their heroes deconstructed, they don’t want their heroes battling each other on a road to deconstructing the why of their existence. That’s another sacrilege.”\n\n\tThe Snyder Verse ended before Snyder got to make two more “Justice League” movies, although he admitted on the podcast that he’s “absolutely talked about” bringing those two movies to life somehow in other mediums like a comic book or animation. Snyder added: “We live in a world where all that is possible.” \n\n\t“I would never say there is no way,” Snyder said when asked about his fans’ continued pleas for the SnyderVerse to continue. “I was on the ride that created ‘Justice League,’ and if you were in my shoes there were numerous times, dark times, when there was no chance that there will ever be my version of it. It will never exist. It can’t… cost, politics, everything stood against. And yet it exists. The fans should never forget they did that. They also raised a ton of money for suicide prevention. They did a lot of good. They catch a lot of flak for being toxic or whatever, but they literally saved human lives. You can go fuck yourselves if that’s what you think.”\n\n\tThe DC Universe has since been revived at Warner Bros. under the leadership of James Gunn and Peter Safran. Gunn directed a new “Superman” movie that was greeted with a mostly positive critical and fan reception upon release last year.\n\n\t“James is cool. I wish them all the best. It is what it is,” Snyder said. “That three movie trilogy is a weed that just won’t die. It grows on its own. It has its own life. It’s not concerned with James’ Superman, which is amazing and all the best to them. I can’t wait to see the next movie. It’s awesome. To me, it’s not the same thing. It’s a different thing.”\n\n\tWatch Snyder’s full interview on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers for “Scream 7,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\tGhostface is back in theaters, and so is Neve Campbell’s Sidney Prescott after sitting out “Scream 6.” In “Scream 7,” Sidney is now a mother to a teenage daughter named Tatum (Isabel May), who gets caught up in her own twisted cat-and-mouse game with the masked killer. Like past “Scream” movies, there’s buckets of blood, shocking kills and one big unmasking at the end of the movie — plus several cameos from past films.\n\n\tThe Ghostface killers rack up quite the bodycount in “Scream 7.” Right off the bat, horror movie lovers Scott (Jimmy Tatro) and Madison (Michelle Randolph) are murdered after renting the home that belonged to Matthew Lillard’s Stu Macher in the original “Scream.” Over in Pine Grove, Sidney receives an eerie message from Stu, apparently back from the grave. He claims that he survived his death in “Scream” and is back as Ghostface to get his revenge on Sidney and her family. One of the Ghostfaces then kills Tatum’s classmate Hannah (Mckenna Grace) at her high school’s play rehearsal then goes to Sidney’s house. \n\n\tAfter a fight with Sidney, her husband Mark (Joel McHale) and Tatum, that Ghostface is run over by reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), who’s joined by her new camera crew Mindy (Jasmin Savoy Brown) and Chad Meeks-Martin (Mason Gooding) from the past two “Scream” movies. Ghostface is revealed to be an unknown murderer who escaped from an insane asylum and had been stalking Sidney. After visiting the mental institution and talking to a supervisor, Sidney finds out that Stu had apparently survived his death. \n\n\tThe real Ghostface starts picking off his victims one by one: Tatum’s friend (Celeste O’Connor), Sidney’s neighbor’s son Lucas (Asa Germann) and Tatum’s boyfriend Ben (Sam Rechner) all die. Mark is wounded, but later survives. It’s also revealed that “Stu” is an AI deepfake created by Marco (Ethan Embry), the supervisor at the mental institute. He makes the AI video transform into late sheriff Dewey Riley (David Arquette), Nancy Loomis (Laurie Metcalf), who was the Ghostface from “Scream 2,” and Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), the killer from “Scream 3.”\n\n\tHowever, the real brains behind the Ghostface killing spree turns out to be Sidney’s neighbor Jessica (Anna Camp). After unmasking, she says she was inspired by Sidney’s autobiography and thought she needed to murder her own husband to reach the same levels of success. When that didn’t work, she discovered where Sidney lived, met Marco and decided to kidnap Tatum to put her through the same Ghostface killings that Sidney survived. But in the end, Sidney and Tatum are able to kill Marco and Jessica (who’s shot repeatedly in the head) and escape with their lives. \n\n\tWith Sidney, Tatum and Mark alive, could they star in an eighth movie and face off against another Ghostface? Mindy and Chad also survive the finale, and in the mid-credits scene they shoot their own news broadcast about the killings; perhaps they could follow in Gale’s reporting footsteps. “Scream” creator Kevin Williams has ideas for an eighth movie, but so far nothing has been officially announced.\n\n\tSee the past “Scream” cameos that appear in the seventh movie below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tStu Macher (Matthew Lillard)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tStu was one of the original Ghostfaces in the original “Scream,” alongside Sidney’s boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), and fans have long theorized that he may have survived his death in the 1996 film after a TV fell on his head. Matthew Lillard returns to play the deranged horror movie fan, but it’s eventually revealed he’s an AI deepfake used to torment Sydney.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNancy Loomis (Laurie Metcalf)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tLaurie Metcalf plays local reporter Debbie Salt, who’s later revealed to be original Ghostface Billy Loomis’ vengeful mother Nancy in “Scream 2.” She has it out for Sidney after the heroine killed Billy in the original “Scream.” Nancy later turns on her fellow Ghostface Mickey Altieri (Timothy Olyphant), but is killed in her final showdown with Sidney. She appears as an AI recreation toward the end of “Scream 7.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRoman Bridger (Scott Foley)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tScott Foley played Roman Bridger, director of the in-universe film “Stab 3” who’s revealed to be Sidney’s half-brother in “Scream 3.” Roman was the only solo Ghostface in the franchise, and his actions secretly dated back to the original “Scream.” He was the product of his and Sidney’s mother Maureen being sexually assaulted, but Maureen later rejected him as a son. Spurned by his mother, Roman filmed her affair with Billy Loomis’ father years ago and showed Billy the footage, causing him to go on the original murder spree in “Scream.” Sidney kills Roman in the “Scream 3” finale, and he appears as AI at the end of “Scream 7.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDewey Riley (David Arquette)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDavid Arquette first starred as Dewey Riley, deputy sheriff of Woodsboro, in the original “Scream” and appeared in every film until his death in “Scream 5.” He had survived stabbings by multiple Ghostfaces throughout the years, but he was finally killed for good in the 2022 reboot (or “requel”). He appears as an AI recreation at the end of “Scream 7.”\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tIs the 1977 album “The Beach Boys Love You” a classic and essential part of this great American band’s catalog, or a lark? It’s so different from virtually every other album the group ever recorded over a nearly 50-year period, there will always be some split over that — maybe even internally, because even core member Al Jardine says he wasn’t that high on the record until relatively recently. But it’s fair to say that if you are really, really, really into the recorded output of Brian Wilson, there’s an outstanding chance you have consumed whatever Kool-Aid is necessary to have joined the choir of fans who have been singing the praises of “Love You” ever since it came out and flopped. \n\t\n\n\tNow, it’s getting its due and then some. Al Jardine and the Pet Sounds Band — which is essentially the group that toured with Brian Wilson as a solo artist for many years — have been doing tour dates where they’ve performed most of the “Love You” album live. On Friday night, for the very first time ever, the ensemble will play the entire record, not leaving out a single track. Anyone who has heard them perform any of this material live will know it’s well worth the pilgrimage… as is any set of theirs that’s mostly limited to the core canon, given how faithfully they have been bringing any Brian song to full-fleshed life for decades before and months since the pop genius’ death.\n\n\n\tBefore a different SoCal show recently, Variety caught up backstage with Jardine and one of the key architects of the Brian Wilson/Pet Sounds Band, Darian Sahanaja, who was known as a member of the L.A. group the Wondermints before he began training virtually all his passion onto the Wilson ouevre. Following is an edited version of that conversation.\n\t\n\n\tIn the meantime, for anyone reading this before Friday night’s show, it takes place at the United Theater on Broadway in downtown L.A. at 8 p.m. Tickets can be found here. For an itinerary of other upcoming shows, in which a good chunk of “Love You” might still be played, check here.\n\n\t(For those who can’t make it to a show — or those who can — there is also a new boxed set out from UMe that focuses on the “Love You” album and its outtakes, along with material from right before and after that project. Read more about that collection in Variety‘s previous coverage here.)\n\n\tAl Jardine: We should bring in some of the fellas in the band, because it’s fascinating from their point of view. They’re the ones that talked me into doing this “Love You” album. It’s a pretty big deal. They call Darian the librarian. He’s got all this stuff in the back of his head, and he wanted to do this in a bad way. And I thought it was a great way to put the band back together, after Brian passed. Well, even before Brian passed, we’d been trying to get the band back together.\n\n\tDid it help, in reforming Brian’s band, to have kind of an excuse to do something different than what you were doing when he was around?\n\n\tJardine: Yeah, it gave us a focus a priority, this long-awaited completion of the idea to do the “Love You” album and bring it to the forefront of our activity, musically. The band hadn’t worked since ’22, and I just wanted to to get it back together. Thanks to Darian, we’d been sharing this idea for quite a while, but for some reason, it just never happened while Brian was with us, even though it was a very personal thing for him, especially. Who knows why. But it’s happening. [To Darian] I’m so glad you convinced me, because we kept going back and forth. He said, “If you do this, if we accomplish this, people are gonna come out of the cities, they’re gonna come out of the woods, Al…”\n\n\tDarian Sahanaja: Yeah, you were doubtful. I think you were kind of like, “Really? People like that album?”\n\n\tJardine: Well, it was very, very understated, and my participation in it was (just) as a vocalist, coming out of the woods in Big Sur to come down to do a session. It was a major thing in itself, just physically and mentally getting into the process of recording it, and it didn’t sound like a Beach Boy album to me. It was great, but it seemed like more of a Brian project, which of course it was. It was dedicated to him by his brothers, and particularly Carl (Wilson). Carl was the de facto producer, really, and pulled us all together so that Brian would be at ease, writing these songs.\n\t\n\n\tSahanaja: He was coming out of an era when he was sort of hiding out in his room and not really doing much. Well, there was that whole “Brian’s back” campaign, right?\n\n\tJardine: With “15 Big Ones” [the album immediately preceding “The Beach Boys Love You”]. And he wasn’t really entirely back. It was a big promotion that Mike (Love) put together with his brother, trying to make something out of nothing, quite honestly.\n\n\tSahanaja: But the way you described how Brian put this music together and brought you guys in sort of in the late stage to sing on it, I don’t know why, but I see that as a very similar — maybe in a completely different context —to the way you did “Pet Sounds” [in the mid-‘60s]. Because in the same way, you guys were on tour, so it was very personal for Brian at the time. He put all the tracks together, and then the guys came into town and you laid down the tracks. I almost see that as a similar approach for Brian.  And that’s why I consider “Love You” probably Brian’s second-most-personal album, after “Pet Sounds,” because basically, he wrote all the songs. I mean, even more personal in a way, because he wrote most of the lyrics. With “Pet Sounds,” he had Tony (Asher as lyricist), as you know.\n\n\tJardine: Of course, Mike and I did write a couple songs, but they pale in comparison to his personal stuff. It’s just remarkable. And I admit I didn’t really appreciate it, because we were in the hit mode. We were on tour all the time. We were like, “We gotta have another hit. We gotta have another single.” And this wasn’t about that.\n\n\tSahanaja:  Well, that’s why Brian is an artist. He takes risks, he does things… If they fail, they fail. If they’re successful, they’re successful.\n\n\tJardine: I mean, I don’t even remember singing some of this stuff. I don’t remember singing on “Solar System,” for instance.\n\n\tSahanaja: You are in that vocal stack.\n\n\tJardine: Am I? Are you sure? You would know. He (Sahanaja) knows how to pull this stuff out. But who writes a song with that kind of context, about the planets? t’s just beautiful.\n\n\tSahanaja: Very sincere, very childlike.\n\n\tJardine: You know, “Airplane.” Oh my God. “Airplane” is one of my favorites of all time.Now I’m completely…\n\t\n\n\tSahanaja: Well, this was my favorite thing in the process of all this, is how he was skeptical at first, and just to watch him become reoriented with this music again and discovering it… maybe because the first time, it wasn’t successful, so onto the next… I love seeing him getting really, really into the music and realizing, “God, these are really, really beautiful songs.” And of course, in the wake of us losing Brian, it’s just his soul and his spirit are with us…\n\n\tJardine: He’s right there. He’s right there.\n\n\tSahanaja: That’s how we feel on stage. Every time we play these songs. I’m just like, ahhh, you can feel Brian’s soul.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAl Jardine and the Pet Sounds Band at Cerritos Center\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChris Willman/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJardine: The guys in the band carry these leads really well, and do it justice. You carry Carl’s leads amazingly. How you do that? “God, please let us go on this way…” You won’t believe that, his performance, how he carries the spirit of Carl. Dennis (Wilson)…\n\n\tSahanaja: I don’t do Dennis. “I Want to Pick You Up”… I can’t really sing that like Dennis. … To be fair, I’ve met people who maybe are not big fans of the record for one reason or another, but I would imagine a lot of it is because the way it’s executed is very raw…\n\n\tJardine: Well, the amazing thing, it’s a synth-driven record, right? And your peers relate to that. Brian was in the forefront of all that stuff. He didn’t use bass guitars on this. He had a Moog synthesizer [as the bass]. It was a different style of production than the Beach Boys were accustomed to. And he literally brought that world to us, and so I’m sitting there with a guitar and going, “What the hell am I supposed to do?” So I really didn’t relate in that sense musically to it at first. Now I get it, because it’s so cleverly written.\n\n\tSahanaja: With all the synths and really odd sort of production decision-making on it, I think it appealed to that next generation, especially going into the ‘80s and beyond, because it’s got that synth-pop thing going on. But, typical Brian: he wasn’t intellectualizing it at all. He wasn’t calculating it. He was like, “This sounds good to me and I could do this. I can just grab a keyboard and play these notes, and there it is. I’m happy.” But the way it all came together in that sort of DIY approach, little did he know…\n\t\n\n\tJardine: But at the same time, he writes a song called “Roller Skating Child,” which is totally Beach Boys. That almost harkens back to the days. And “Honkin’ Down the Highway,” those two that are like that, I could relate to, and I sing the lead on (“Honkin’”). It just feels natural to me when you feel Brian’s.ability to go backwards and forwards, or retro and future. Amazing. I learned a new chord, by the way, the other day, in my book. Did you know there’s a sus4 in “Roller Skating Child”?\n\n\tSahanaja: Is there?\n\n\tJardine: That’s what it says. I found a little book in my stack of memorabilia called “The Beach Boys: Volume One.” It’s got all the songs that we wrote, and “The Beach Boys Love You” is in it, of all things. So, look at me. showing him some new chords.\n\n\tSahanaja: I’ve gotta take a look.I’ll have to check that. Because Brian didn’t like sus; he didn’t like sustained chords.\n\n\tJardine: Well, maybe the book’s wrong, then!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDarian Sahanaja\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tScott Dudelson\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen you guys are playing the “Love You” songs now, have you rearranged it to fit in a little more with the other classic Beach Boys stuff that doesn’t sound anything like that, or are you trying to recreate the original synthy sounds?\n\n\tSahanaja: It’s one thing is to say recreating. Another thing is just to embody the spirit and feel of the record, the original sensibilities of the record, which was Brian’s … It’s like when we do “Pet Sounds.” You can cut corners and simplify the chords and all that, but that’s not what Brian wrote, and that’s not what he came up with in the studio. So you can say, “Yeah, let’s get the exact paint-by-numbers thing,” but if you do paint by numbers but if it’s not done with the right feel and the spirit of it…\n\n\tJardine: They nail it. This band, they nail it.\n\n\tPaul Von Mertens (multi-instrumentalist and musical director): I remember during “Pet Sounds” (on a tour performing that entire album), we would even debate in rehearsal … There’s a funny banjo entrance. You know, is that a mistake or intentional? “No, let’s keep it because it’s on there.”\n\n\tSahanaja:  And even one in this record. How about “Johnny Carson”? It’s so clearly a mistake. There’s this errant symbol crash that’s completely not (right),  and we just love it, because, again, I picture Brian just going, “Pssssh, that’s it! That sounds great. Keep it.”\n\t\n\n\tJardine: Well, how about in the third verse? Is it the third verse where he goes “da-da-da” and he does the resolve.\n\n\tSahanaja: Yes, yes, you’re right.\n\n\tJardine: And Bob (in the Pet Sounds Band) plays it just like it! He plays the mistake, perfectly.\n\n\tSahanaja: I gives it an out-of-the-box feel. It’s just like, what?  But when you listen back to even the golden-era Beach Boys recordings of Brian conducting the studio musicians (in the mid-‘60s), many times they’ll play something and say, “Is that right?” And Brian will go, “Yeah, that’s great. Just keep that,” because he just loves the vibe of it.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAl Jardine and the Pet Sounds Band joined by Weird Al Yankovic and Eric Idle in concert in Cerritos, Calif, with Rob Bonfiglio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tScott Dudelson\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt feels like there might be different audiences coming to shows like this. There are some people coming who really just want to hear “The Beach Boys Love You.” And then at most of these shows, there will be people who don’t know the albu at all. Do you feel like there’s kinda like two audiences that you’re playing for?\n\n\tJardine: Probably, I’m sure.\n\n\tSahanaja:  I don’t know. In the spirit of Brian Wilson, I like the idea that we just forge ahead and be bold.\n\n\tVon Mertens: I think that the idea is partly to bring the audience along with us. I can remember on the “Smile” tour, we were playing a festival in Belgium, and it was kind of drizzling on a soccer field, and there were beer stands encircling the entire field where the audience was. We hadn’t been playing “Smile” for very long. and we’re playing this outdoor festival and people are sliding around in the mud. And I remember the whole band — Jeff (Foskett) in particular — was like, “We can’t do ‘Smile.’ They’re gonna kill us! They’re gonna hate it.” And finally we just like bit the bullet and said, “OK, we’re gonna do it and we’re just gonna throw down like we always do.” When we finished the set, we left the stage and the audience was singing that soccer chant that they do that’s like an audio equivalent of a standing ovation. They were all going, “Ohhh-wayyyy-ooh,” and we were like, “OK. I guess, I guess it worked.”\n\n\tSahanaja:  Exactly. I always believe that if the material is really good and it’s performed well with love and care, it doesn’t matter if an audience is familiar with the music. I think they walk away feeling like, “Wow, that was really good.”\n\t\n\n\tJardine: But I do like the first note of the show… It’s an anthem, “California Girls,” and as soon as you hit that first ding.\n\n\tSahanaja: You’re making me sentimental because, because our dearly departed guitarist, Nick Walusko, I remember when I met him in 1983. And Nick would always say, “What Brian could do with just one note. Like the intro of ‘California Girls,’ listen, I know it’s one note, but it’s like a whole atmosphere in that one note.” And I totally understood that.\n\n\tHow many members of the Brian Wilson Band have carried over to this band now?\n\n\tJardine: There’s 12 on stage. All of us.\n\n\tSahanaja: Almost everybody; one of us, Probyn (Gregory), couldn’t do this tour because he was out with “Weird Al” Yankovic on that incredible, successful tour. So we have another fellow filling in for him named Emeen Zarookian, who plays with Micky Dolenz. It’s been really fun. … Just to go back really quickly to the audiences: I love that this new music, us performing the “Love You” material, is just because of its kind of DIY approach in the synths, and we’re getting a lot of young people coming out to the shows, and freaking out. We just see them chanting and jamming along and jumping and up and down. It’s insane. It’s great, because I know what they’re excited about: Brian being Brian, which is somebody eccentric…\n\n\tJardine: The big sing-along is a tune called “Ding Dang.” You know the album. It’s 52 seconds long, right? But it gets the audience; they go crazy immediately with the biggest reaction, and they start going “woo” with this, just carrying on like a bunch of kids. It’s really a childlike experience. We add a little extra, actually, at the end. We actually have a chord change now. We will surprise you with it.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for Season 4, Part 2 of “Bridgerton,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tEverything has changed for Hannah Dodd",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for Season 4, Part 2 of “Bridgerton,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tEverything has changed for Hannah Dodd‘s Francesca in Season 4 of “Bridgerton.” Dodd took over the role of Francesca for the show’s third season, after the departure of Ruby Stokes. Since then, Francesca debuted in society, and then met, fell in love with and married John Stirling, Earl of Kilmartin (Victor Alli). Fans of Julia Quinn’s “Bridgerton” novels — the source material for Netflix’s mega-hit drama — know that the story doesn’t end there. Francesa’s book, “When He Was Wicked,” is the sixth installment in the series, and focuses on her romance with Michael Stirling, her late husband John’s cousin, who has loved her from the moment they met.As Season 3 set up Francesca and John’s love for each other, John’s rakish cousin finally made an appearance in the finale — as a woman named Michaela (Masali Baduza), in a dramatic gender-flipped departure from the book.While “Bridgerton” has introduced same-sex relationships to the show, it is unclear how the theme will be tackled in upcoming seasons. Francesca’s brother, and Season 4 lead, Benedict, was previously introduced as bisexual and came out to his now-wife, Sophie, during a heartfelt conversation in Part 2. Regardless, Francesca and Michaela (dubbed “Franchaela” by fans) will be Bridgerton’s first central couple to be queer, as well as the show’s first Sapphic storyline. As for when that will happen, though Shondaland and Netflix haven’t yet announced who will be the lead character for Season 5, Francesca’s arc in the fourth season make her the prime candidate. (When Variety‘s Jenny Maas asked showrunner Jess Brownell this question about Francesa, Brownell said, “Can you just put ‘laughs’?” And then added, “Interesting theory.”)Although no overtly romantic moments have passed between the duo yet, they’ve shared several scenes as Michaela’s outgoing and impulsive nature grates against Francesca’s need for order and repressed feelings. Much to the happiness of their mutually beloved John, the two eventually clear the air between them and strike up a friendship. Everything seems to be on track for the newly formed Kilmartin family, until John, suffering from a headache, lies down for a nap in Episode 6 and never wakes back up.The next two episodes feature a devastated Francesca as she attempts to navigate her grief, her suppressed emotions hard to read, until she reveals she is trying to stay calm for the sake of her pregnancy. But when the pregnancy turns out to be a false alarm, she has a devastating meltdown in her mother’s arms.\n\n\n\tThrough it all, her one steady source of comfort remains Michaela, the only one who understands the depth of her loss. Poles apart in character, Michaela proposes a joyful celebration of life for John, where Francesca finally smiles and thanks her for her support. Seemingly a united front, Michaela agrees to stay in London upon Francesca’s request, but secretly flees in the finale.Here, Baduza and Dodd, and Alli in a separate interview, speak with Variety about the trio’s love for each other, what’s next for Francesca’s character arc — and what John’s death means for Francesca and Michaela’s romance.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis is the first time we’ve seen a queer relationship in the spotlight on “Bridgerton.” Is there any added pressure to depict this particular storyline?Hannah Dodd: We’re mainly really, really excited and very proud to get to tell that story, and tell it in a way that it’s the lead storyline and not just the side characters. They get a full eight-episode arc as they deserve, and hopefully there’s audiences that feel really represented and included.Do Francesca and Michaela have feelings for each other at this point? And, more importantly, are they aware of them?Masali Baduza: I think Michaela has feelings for Francesca. I think that she has pushed them down to the very bottom, but they are there, and she isn’t really acknowledging them. Obviously, Francesca is her cousin’s wife, so it’s a lot for her, but she’s definitely feeling that level of attraction for Francesca.Dodd: I think Francesca isn’t even aware of that as a possibility. As much as she’s feeling feelings, she doesn’t really know where they come from and why. For the most part, it’s a confronting energy for her. [Michaela] is somebody who lives their life in quite an opposite way. It’s a little bit like triggering for Francesca, and makes her question herself. There’s a response that comes from Francesca when she’s with Michaela, but I don’t think she has any idea what that is — yet.After helping each other navigate their grief, Michaela promises Francesca she’ll stay in London but ends up leaving without a word. Why is that?Baduza: Michaela’s feeling a lot of emotions, and she’s very overwhelmed. I think that her coping mechanism is to just run away and pretend like nothing is happening. If she’s not there to face it, then she doesn’t have to deal with it. She’s constraining herself, and in doing so, is hurting Francesca a lot. She’s just looking out for herself.It’s clear to viewers that Michaela has an overwhelming effect on Francesca, who ends up being a bit stand-offish toward her. How does Michaela read Francesca’s confusing behavior toward her?Baduza: Michaela thinks maybe that Francesca’s lived a very sheltered life. She’s not used to anything or anyone that really disrupts her state of peace. Michaela reads that as friction and tension. But again, she’s not someone who really loves to interrogate what she’s feeling in the moment. If it’s very hard for her, she’ll give it back to her, or deflect, or just not be in the space and in the environment whatsoever.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJohn’s last scene is him completing a puzzle with Francesca and Michaela, where he does the ground, and Michaela finishes the sky. His last shot in the show is him looking at Francesca and Michaela getting along with fondness. Did you play into the symbolism of that? What was John feeling in that moment?Dodd: I think that whole scene is a metaphor, and is sort of a symbol for their relationship. I think it’s very, very clever and very well-written that they both complete Francesca’s puzzle [and the pieces they choose] really represent their characters as well. Whether or not the characters are aware of things, I do think it’s something that you can look back on, and it feels like a bit of a blessing.Victor Alli: It’s interesting because John doesn’t know what’s happening next, so I had to play every moment as is, and not think about it being my last. It is really symbolic, but I didn’t want to lean into it too much, and wanted to [keep] it sort of simple.What does John hope for Francesca and Michaela individually?Alli: That post John’s passing, Francesca is able to find her feet again. John would want her to be happy, and would be behind whatever she decides to do. She shouldn’t feel the pressure of having to stay in this wallowing rut, and he expects her to bloom. And with Michaela, he would want her to shine in every single way. She’s such a big part of his life, and he’d want her to carry on the family name and be a Stirling ambassador, whatever that may mean.How is John going to continue to influence Michaela and Francesca’s relationship as it builds?Dodd: John’s an integral character for both of us, and he’s had such an impact on both our lives. He’s what connects them, but also what separates them. He’s going to be with them, as anybody who leaves you is, forever.\n\n\tBaduza: Exactly, and they’ll always be family on some level, because they shared John.Alli: I think there will always be a part of John in Francesca and Michaela, because ultimately, he’s the thing that united them both. Of course, they have to find their own feet and their own journey together. But he’s the glue. So, hopefully, there might be moments where he’s spoken about and remembered, because he’s an integral part of their relationship.What’s next for Francesca and Michaela in terms of reconciliation after Michaela’s departure?Dodd: It is gonna take some work, definitely. They’re both in pain, so I do hope that there’s grace given to both of them. Everybody goes through those things very differently, and it can do things to you. You’re not always your best self in those situations.Baduza: I hope that Michaela comes back to apologize, sets the record straight with Francesca and explains why she did what she did. It would be lovely to see that. I hope so. Fingers crossed.Throughout the season, Francesca is struggling with being unable to have a baby. After John’s passing, there’s a moment where she thinks she might be pregnant but realizes she isn’t, followed by a particularly difficult conversation with her mother, when Francesca says she feels she failed John by not being able to make him a father. How much of Francesca’s grief is her not having a baby versus guilt over not being able to do something for her husband, whom she loved?Dodd: I don’t know if she knows. She’s got a tsunami of feelings. I think it’s something that connects her and her mum, and there’s this idea that this is how her mum got through [the loss of her husband]. I don’t completely know if she’s aware of what is “societal” and what are her own thoughts. I do think that she really, really wanted a baby, and I think that [having one] would have also been devastating in its own right, but also been a piece of John that she gets to keep. It could have given her a purpose, and she’s somebody who would have benefited from that. But sometimes when life goes in unexpected ways, that’s where you can grow the most. There’s so much pressure on women and expectations, and I think for her to work out what she wants and who she is, she needs to break away from all of that. One of the major plot points in Francesca’s book, “When He Was Wicked,” is her struggle with infertility and wanting a child. Is that something that will be incorporated into the show for Francesca and Michaela’s storyline?Dodd: I’m sure what the writers will come up with will be beautiful and wonderful, and there’ll be elements of the book incorporated. Obviously, we have done the infertility storyline, so whether or not that continues, I don’t know, but I do think it’s a really interesting dynamic, and queer couples are included in that story as well. Just because we’re doing a queer storyline, it doesn’t mean that that won’t fit into it, and I’m excited to find out. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrancesca is very overwhelmed by all of the attention from her family is giving her, but does continue to seek Michaela out. In addition to her being John’s cousin, is there a reason why Francesca finds her presence comforting?Dodd: I think it’s a combination of things. There is an instinctual thing — an unspoken and not really understood connection there. Michaela is somebody that she is drawn to, whether or not it’s because she frustrates her, whether or not it’s because she represents home and knows John. But nobody knew John like Francesca and Michaela. She’s really looking for comfort in somebody who is actually experiencing what she’s feeling. As much as everybody around the family loved John, Michaela is the only one who is grieving in the same way as she is, so she’s looking for that familiarity and that comfort from her. But there is a bit of an instinctive pull there as well.Speaking of John and Michaela’s relationship, there’s a scene at Michaela’s welcome-to-society party, where John is adamant that Francesca not attempt to set Michaela up with suitors and gets quite upset when she does. Is there a reason behind that?Baduza: It was never explicitly said. But Victor and I talked a lot about the fact that Michaela would have shared her sexuality with him, or her figuring it out, with him. John is very protective over Michaela. They have a very close sibling relationship, so he knows her very well. He knows that she’s not in the market for her husband, probably never will be. He knows what society expects of her and that she’s just not willing to do that.Alli: He knows Michaela really well and knows that Francesca means well. But John is sort of like, “It’s more than that.” Michaela is not ready for marriage and all that comes with it. She’s pretty content being single and seeing people, and she’s just waiting for the right time and the right love.Does John pick up on any of the romantic tension between the two of them?Baduza: I don’t think so. He would never expect his cousin to be into his wife.Alli: I don’t think he does. He’s so invested in his marriage that he just wants that. It wouldn’t even cross his mind that there’s something there.Throughout the season, Michaela gives Francesca a lot of difficult-to-decipher looks, especially during John’s funeral. How was she feeling overall and dealing with a confusing mix of emotions?Baduza: I think Michaela was definitely in her own world at the funeral. She couldn’t have been there for Francesca, because she was grappling with the loss of her brother. She was just overwhelmed and maybe was thinking of possible exit plans. She was just going through it and also grieving her brother with this family that she’s also getting to know. So she’s just not in the most comfortable environment.The pregnancy test Francesca undergoes is, quite frankly, very invasive. How does that add to the stress of the situation for Francesca?Dodd: It’s awful. It’s just horrible. You’ve got a grieving woman who has also been quite sheltered, so it’s so invasive, even filming it. I think [being pregnant] was something that she was hanging on to. If there was any hope in that situation, it was the baby. So to have that ripped away from her as well, it’s just like, what else can you take? She’s at absolute ground zero, especially once Michaela leaves; she doesn’t know what life looks like anymore. She’s worked so hard to create that life. It’s an opportunity for her to start again, which is horrendous for anybody to have to do, but there’s an opportunity there for her to actually get to know [herself]. There’s a really interesting dynamic of you can’t take anything else from me. I’m hoping that that will kind of contribute towards growth, because she’s been quite a little girl scared of the world, and “what else can you do to me?” is a really interesting place to take her.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJust to switch gears for a second, how do you envision the Bridgertons breaking the Sophie scandal to Francesca in the middle of everything she’s dealing with?Dodd: I know! I know! Francesca is still very close to her family, so I like the idea of Eloise [telling her], just because I think they’re sort of besties. But Francesca would have been like, “OK, do you know what’s going on in my life?” Maybe she would have had something to say in support, like “love whilst you have time.” As awful as it is, maybe there was some motivation that’s given.Speaking of the Bridgertons, they’re a very close-knit family, and you really see that they want to be there for Francesca. Benedict and Hyacinth are really upset by John’s passing in particular, and it affect their actions throughout the next few episodes. How do you think his death affects the family at large?Dodd: It’s really interesting, because the death of our father has connected us as a family. It’s sort of the core of what the Bridgertons are and why we are so close as a family. To see them all kind of go through it again, it’s quite a visceral reaction. They are so close, and they do really feel for Francesca, but I do think it’s because some of them have been there before as well, that reality is probably quite difficult to replay and go through. It’s a beautiful family dynamic where they really lean on each other. There’s still a lot to explore within the siblings and their different relationships. I’m looking forward to hopefully getting to explore some other relationships out of this situation. But it definitely shakes all of them to their core.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

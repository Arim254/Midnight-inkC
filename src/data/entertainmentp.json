    "body": "\n\tProducer Harman Baweja and director Arati Kadav are teaming up for a new film, marking their second collaboration following last year’s critically acclaimed drama “Mrs.”\n\n\tThe duo unveiled their reunion timed to coincide with the one-year anniversary of “Mrs.,” the Sanya Malhotra-starrer that became a cultural touchpoint for its exploration of domestic identity and gender dynamics.\n\n\t“Mrs.,” produced by Baweja’s Baweja Studios with backing from Jio Studios’ Jyoti Deshpande, earned widespread acclaim, including at Black Nights Tallinn and IFFI Goa, and collected multiple awards across major platforms. The film reimagined Jeo Baby’s Malayalam-language cult hit “The Great Indian Kitchen” through a North Indian cultural framework, incorporating traditions like Karwa Chauth while chronicling the gradual erosion of a woman’s sense of self. Baweja also served as co-writer on the project alongside Kadav.\n\t\n\n\tDetails of the new projects are under wraps at the moment.\n\n\n\t“‘Mrs.’ reaffirmed my belief audiences are ready for audacious cinema that is intimate and transformative all at once,” Baweja said. “Collaborating with Arati evoked a thrill that you get from being on the same page with someone, while also being challenged. I’m excited to have her bring honesty, intelligence, and immense emotional clarity to our fresh collaboration, which we have the pleasure of announcing on ‘Mrs’ first anniversary. When a collaboration is built on trust and shared intent, you naturally want to create again. This next project is born from that very faith, and I’m looking forward to once again pushing boundaries together.”\n\t\n\n\tKadav added: “I feel very happy, safe, inspired, and delighted to work with Harman Baweja. He and his team, including our creative producer Tasneem Lokhandwala, have always helped me do my best. As a team, we have a lot of mutual respect and faith in each other, which I feel is the foundation of a great relationship. Mrs. was a great collaboration, and it was because of the team that Baweja Studios brought together for me, including my actress Sanya Malhotra. I am actually very happy to collaborate with Harman for the rest of my life. As I said, Baweja Studios feels like home.”\n\n\tThe announcement comes as Baweja Studios maintains momentum with recent release “Haq” and an active development slate for 2026 that includes “Dil Ka Darwaza Kholo Na Darling,” “Captain India” and “Boy From Andaman,” along with several projects in development.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor too long now (it’s starting to feel like 1,000 years), Dracula movies have been an industry, a monster brand unto themselves. At this point, it’s like seeing the umpteenth version of a Shakespeare warhorse or a musical like “Annie” — what is there left to discover? The saga of Dracula has become an endless rerun. And even if you don’t feel like you’ve already lived through a century’s worth of Dracula movies, and that they’ve wrung this story dry, there have been two elaborately eye-catching and overproduced recent versions — “Renfield,” in which Nicolas Cage did his thing as Dracula (the same thing he’s been doing since “Vampire’s Kiss,” in 1989), and Robert Eggers’ “Nosferatu,” in which the ratio of awesome production design to interesting drama was about seven to one. (I’d say something similar about Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein,” but that’s another story.)\n\t\n\n\tSo here we are again, caught up in the never-ending slow-drip flood of cinematic Dracula mythology, now with Luc Besson’s wan, derivative, dutifully time-period-hopping, different-but-not-really-new take on the vampire legend. The movie, big surprise, wants to be more “romantic” than horrific (my sarcasm descends from the fact that this is already an entire category of Dracula movie, dating back to the 1979 Frank Langella version). Come for the fangs, stay for the swoons. As the kids used to say, BFD.\n\n\n\tCaleb Landry Jones, a very good actor, starts off by playing Dracula as a shockingly direct descendant of what Gary Oldman did in the opening 45 minutes of “Bram Stoker’s Dracula.” The makeup is a total knockoff: the white hair piled in a neat bun (in this case with two long side bangs), the rotting parchment skin, the fossilized teeth, all enhanced by the winning delicacy of Jones’ performance, starting with the way he says (à la Oldman), “I am Vlad, the second prince of Volokia. Count…Dragoool.” Jones’s Dragoool suggests a fusion of Oldman, Karloff’s Mummy and the Cryptkeeper, with shades of Klaus Kinski, Willem Dafoe, Heath Ledger and a grimacing carp.\n\t\n\n\tDracula hosts Jonathan Harker (Ewens Abid) in his spired castle (it’s as huge as Notre Dame) at the foot the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. But we meet him when he’s a young prince in 1480 Eastern Europe, drawn into battle and away from his beloved wife, Elisabeta (Zoë Blue). The two are first seen cavorting in the sheets, but she soon gets slaughtered, and this causes him such anguish that he can no longer accept God’s provenance. He says to the priest, “Tell God that until he brings back my wife, my life no longer belongs to Him.” Cue a thunderclap and a statue of Jesus dripping a tear of blood.\n\n\tDanny Elfman’s score, echoing the waltz theme of “Rosemary’s Baby,” is more atmospheric than anything else in “Dracula,” which Besson has staged like a music-video director who has grown too weary for fast cutting. Once the film leaps ahead to Paris in the late 1800s, Jones appears as a dandified version of his princely self. But here, as in “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (which I always thought should have been called “Francis Ford Coppola’s Bram Stoker’s Dracula”), the lead actor is more compelling as the ancient, ethereal, elfin-demon Dracula than he is as the long-haired Lothario in a top hat speaking in a vague Transylvanian accent. “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” went to sleep during the more contemporary sections, and so goes Besson’s “Dracula,” which is basically about its title vamp trying to romance Mina, who is presented as the reincarnation of Elisabeta (Zoë Bleu plays both roles). Dracula: “Madame, it is an honor and a pleasure to see you again.” Mina: “Have we met before?” Dracula: “In a dream, perhaps. I have this strange feeling that we have known each other…for a long time.” The audience: “Zzzzzz.“\n\n\tIt’s not as if we needed to see “Dracula” remade as a blood-soaked Valentine’s Day movie. Christoph Waltz is on hand as the Van Helsing character, known simply as the Priest, and he does his tastefully understated scenery-chewing. There’s one splashingly gory sequence, when Maria (Matilda De Angelis), Dracula’s first disciple, goes demon and gets decapitated and staked-through-the-heart. The film finally returns to Dracula’s castle, where four stone gargoyles come to life, and where there is bad swordplay, schlocky cannon fire, and a fortune-cookie theological lecture from Waltz’s Priest. At the end of the movie he says, “The spell is broken.” Watching this “Dracula,” we know just what he means.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Season 1 finale of “Spartacus: House of Ashur,” now available on Starz.\n\n\tSteven S. DeKnight has helped create several cinematic universes over the years. He wrote on “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and the spinoff “Angel” in the early aughts, lent his talents to Superman on “Smallville,” ran a “Transformers” writers’ room in 2015, directed “Pacific Rim: Uprising” in 2018 and served as showrunner for Marvel’s “Daredevil” on Netflix.\n\t\n\n\tBeginning in 2010, however, DeKnight has been expanding a universe of his own with “Spartacus.” Though the series shares a title and general timeline with Stanley Kubrick’s 1960 feature, the Starz and Lionsgate television series takes the historical epic into new territory, matching the conventions of sword and sandals with sex and slaughter for a visceral dramatization of history. \n\n\n\tThe series began with “Spartacus: Blood and Sand” in 2010. A prequel series, “Spartacus: Gods of the Arena,” later premiered in 2011, and the timeline continued with “Spartacus: Vengeance” in 2012 and “Spartacus: War of the Damned” in 2013, which saw the title gladiator’s death in the final episode.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Matt Klitscher/Starz\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLate last year, “Spartacus” returned to television after more than a decade, but the show did not reemerge with new tales of the eponymous Thracian. Instead, the new series, titled “Spartacus: House of Ashur” focuses on the subtitular character: the Assyrian Ashur (Nick E. Tarabay) who stood enemy to Spartacus in the original series and met a gristly demise at the end of “Vengeance.”\n\t\n\n\tNevertheless, the new series opens with Ashur in the underworld, where he is given the opportunity to reexperience life in a different timeline, one in which he evaded death, killed Spartacus and now stands Dominus in his own House. Ashur awakes in this alternative timeline, but not all is blissful. Throughout the series, he still must navigate the politics of the Roman Empire, contending with the crass authority of Julius Caesar (Jackson Gallagher) and his wife Cornelia (Jaime Slater), aiming to elevate his House’s notoriety in the arena by introducing the ferocious gladiatrix, Achillia (Tenika Davis), and all the while, trying to maintain peace within and without in his new chance at rewriting history. \n\n\tAnd rewrite history he does! The “House of Ashur” season finale, which premiered on Starz on Feb. 6, concludes with Ashur murdering Caesar, thus subverting the Ides of March and revising one of the most infamous deaths in human history. After Achillia gains victory in the arena and brings triumph to the House of Ashur, Caesar dismisses the agreement that would see Ashur gain favor among the Roman Empire. The two then engage in an intense and intimate battle of fists and blades, culminating in Ashur delivering a fatal blow to the mighty Caesar. In the penultimate shot, Ashur stands over the Emperor’s dead body in a pool of blood and utters the episode’s now-ironic title: “Hail Caesar.”\n\n\tAhead of the finale, Variety caught up with DeKnight to discuss his return to “Spartacus,” the uncoupling of history in “House of Ashur” — and the future of all the franchises he’s touched over the years.\n\n\tAnd the other main thing that I wanted to do was work with Nick Tarabay again. I loved working with Nick; I worked with him on a couple of projects. He’s a complete pro, and I thought he really deserved to be front and center, because he’s such a fantastic actor.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s start by stating the obvious: Ashur was decapitated in “Spartacus: Vengeance.” What made you want to resurrect the character and make a season in an alternative timeline, focusing on him as the hero?\t\n\n\tTwo main things: first and foremost, I just thought it was an incredibly juicy character and that there was more to explore. When we see Asher in “Spartacus: Gods of the Arena,” we see a guy who’s eager to be part of the Brotherhood. He wants those relationships, but through a series of circumstances, he’s ridiculed, humiliated and injured — and that makes him really bitter. So I always thought it would be interesting to explore whether he can rediscover his humanity. Can he find his heart again?\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Matt Klitscher/Starz\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow did you and the writers decide on the story?\t\n\n\tAbout three years ago, I pitched this crazy idea to Lionsgate and Starz. They said that they wanted more “Spartacus,” so I went through the usual permutations: What if we focused on Caesar? What if we focused on the triumvirate? What if we did Antony and Cleopatra? But none of them felt like “Spartacus” in the true sense of the series. I really love the confined upstairs-downstairs storytelling with the political intrigue. In the original show, Ashur says, “This is the rise of the house of Ashur.” The writers and I mused about, what if we actually did that show, and eventually we said, “Why the hell not? Why not do a ‘What If…’ where we can uncouple from history so the audience doesn’t know what’s coming and explore this great character?”\n\t\n\t\tDid you always know that you wanted to reintroduce Caesar into the universe of“Spartacus”?\t\n\n\tWell, we had Caesar in the original show, played by Todd Lasance, and he was unfortunately not available because he’s starring in his own show and we’re very happy for him. But when I first talked to Nick, I called him up after Lionsgate and Starz said yes to the show. He was in France at the time, and I pitched him the story and he was immediately on board, and part of that pitch was I told him, “At the end of Season 1, you kill Caesar and the last line is ‘Hail Caesar.’” He loved it and now, here we are.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Matt Klitsche/Starz\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSo you knew from the beginning that the season would end with the battle between Ashur and Caesar, and the further rewriting of history?\t\n\n\tYeah. A lot of people watching the show keep asking, “When are we going to see Caesar, Crassus and Pompey take over the Republic?” Obviously, I couldn’t tell them, but we had a different plan. The interesting thing about the show is that now that Ashur is alive again, he knocks over the historical dominoes, and starts changing history. The first change is that he introduces the female gladiator about 70 years earlier than it actually happened. And the next big one is that he murders Julius Caesar, which obviously completely upsets history and the triumvirate. And what happens from there is really interesting to me. So, yes, I had this idea from the very beginning. I thought it would be a super cool, different approach to history, and really show the audience that we are now truly uncoupled from history.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDespite the ending, though, Caesar’s wife, Cornelia, really has more of a presence throughout the season. Why did you decide to make her the more prominent and consequential character in the story?\t\n\n\tWell, I talked to my historical consultants and they explained that Julius Caesar is the most famous Roman in history, but at this point in time, his wife, Cornelia, was actually more powerful, richer and better known, and she was helping Caesar rise up through the ranks because she truly loved him. It was a love relationship. I think there’s a story when Caesar was banished — or on the run and had to live in a cave — and she joined him because she loved him so much. So really this came from the historical consultants saying that she was actually the one that everyone wanted to suck up to at this point in history. She was the daughter of Cinna, who was the previous dictator of the Roman Republic, and she had a lot of notoriety and power and public presence. I thought it would be very interesting to subvert those expectations of Caesar being front and center, and instead have it be his wife who’s working on his behalf.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Matt Klitsche/Starz\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAnother interesting character that you introduce in this season is Achillia. How did you and your fellow writers develop her and decide to introduce the concept of gladiatrixes to “Spartacus”?\t\n\n\tOn the original show, Rob Tapper and I always wanted to introduce the female gladiator, because we just thought it was really cool, but we were sticking much closer to history and we ultimately decided that it was a bit too far since it was like 70 or 80 years out of the time period. But we really wanted to do it, so this time around, with the uncoupling of history, we went for it. It introduced a cool, different visual element for the show, and from there, we started building a character with a mysterious past that’s fighting her own demons. We found a way for her to be thrown into this brutal world where no one, including Ashur, expects her to survive. She’s a gimmick. Ashur just uses her to get his foot in the door, but then, against all odds, she survives, barely. And then he’s really got a hot property — and a hot property like that, of course, in classic entertainment fashion, is mimicked. All the other promoters want to copy it, so that’s where the Scythian came in. She’s the next one as it’s catching on. People in the show want to see more gladiatrixes. So that story will continue, and we’ll see more female gladiators.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDoes that mean that you have more “Spartacus” in the pipeline? Will there be a Season 2 of “House of Ashur”?\t\n\n\tYeah, we’ve actually already written Season 2. It all depends on the audience and the viewership, but we’re very happy with the response so far, and we’re ready to go.\n\t\n\t\tAcross all of the seasons of “Spartacus” do you ever get notes from the studio regarding the amount of sex and violence? Do they ever ask you to tone it down, or, contrarily, do they ever insist that you amp it up, given that it’s part of what makes the show unique?\t\n\n\tThankfully no. Starz and Lionsgate were both very supportive from early on, and they were clear that they wanted more of the same show. They didn’t want us to tone it down for the times. Their opinion from the start was, “Look, we know this show isn’t for everybody —we’re not trying to make it for everybody. We want to make another ‘Spartacus.’” So that was fantastic to hear in this day and age, that they didn’t put restrictions on us. They were very happy with what we were delivering and they felt it was very much in the spirit of the original show.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhere does the unique dialogue of “Spartacus” come from? How did you create this unique Shakespearean dialect riddled with profanity?\t\n\n\tA lot of people think that the syntax is Latin, but it actually has nothing to do with Latin. It was a pure creative invention from the beginning of the original series, just because I wanted to convey to the audience the sense of a different time. I have a background in playwriting; that’s what I studied in college and I was deeply steeped in Shakespeare, but I didn’t want to go full Shakespeare because with a modern audience, it’d be incredibly difficult to understand. The show’s already challenging as it is, so I just mashed two of my favorite things together: Shakespeare and “Conan the Barbarian.” I just wanted to put those together and then run it through the lens of growing up in South Jersey, which means I curse a lot. I wanted that kind of juxtaposition of the highfalutin language with a lot of cursing, which just felt right for the world.\n\t\n\t\tNow that you’ve created this alternative timeline, are there other “Spartacus” characters that you’d be interested in revisiting or resurrecting?\t\n\n\tDefinitely. I always wanted to do a Gannicus spin off from the original series, played by the fantastic Dustin Clare. At the end of “Gods of the Arena,” he gains his freedom from the arena and goes off wandering. He disappears in the time period of the show for five, six or seven years, and then reappears in “Spartacus: Vengeance.” And I always thought it would be great to do like a Spaghetti Western kind of version, you know, a “Have Sword, Will Travel,” with Gannicus wandering the lands, looking for redemption for his own past deeds as he gets involved with helping people. Like, a Man with No Name Spaghetti Western, but with a sword- and-sandal bent.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLastly, beyond “Spartacus,” you’ve been involved in so many franchises over the years from Marvel, DC, “Transformers” and “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.” Some of these series, notably “Buffy” and “Daredevil” are getting new life right now in the form of reboots. Would you be interested in returning to any of those universes as a writer, director or producer, as you’ve served in the past?\t\n\n\tI’m always open, but I also love to see what the next generation of creatives are going to bring to the table. It’s like, I’ve had my go and it was a great time. I loved working on “Buffy” and “Daredevil,” but I’m really excited about the “Buffy’ reboot. I cannot wait to see what they do. I was especially excited when I heard Sarah Michelle Gellar was going to be part of it, which, to me, makes it even more exciting. So, would I answer the call if I was available? Of course. I love those worlds, but I think they’ll do just fine without me, and I’m just excited to see what these creatives do with the properties.\n\t\n\t\tAny advice for the folks rebooting “Daredevil” on Disney+ right now?\t\n\n\tI think they got a handle on it. Quite frankly, my advice is always the same for all creatives: swing for the fences. Just absolutely go for it and people will show up. Particularly with“Daredevil,” they’rebenefiting from having Charlie Cox, Vincent D’Onofrio, Jon Bernthal, and, of course, the incredible Deborah Ann Woll. You absolutely cannot go wrong with that talent. They are just amazing. I’d watch those guys read the phone book, so I’m sure that they’re going to do great.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has settled a defamation lawsuit brought a Vanity Fair staffer who claimed that she was falsely portrayed in the Shonda Rhimes series “Inventing Anna.”\n\n\tRachel DeLoache Williams, a former friend of con artist Anna Sorokin, sued in 2022, claiming that the series gave the false impression that she had abandoned and betrayed Sorokin and depicted her as “snobbish” and “greedy.”\n\n\t“Williams and Netflix have resolved the lawsuit,” said a Netflix spokesperson and her attorney, Alexander Rufus-Isaacs, in matching statements on Friday.\n\t\n\n\tThe series was based on a New York magazine article about the fake heiress, who went by Anna Delvey and who served nearly four years in prison for fraud. \n\n\tWilliams argued that the Netflix series sought to get audiences to root for Sorokin, transforming her from a real-life villain into a more palatable anti-hero. In the process, she alleged that she was turned from a victim into Sorokin’s foil.\n\n\t“Shonda Rhimes and the others responsible for creating and writing ‘Inventing Anna’ believed that the Series needed a villain,” Williams’ lawyers wrote in a court filing. “Out of animus toward Williams, they cynically decided to portray Williams as that villain.”\n\n\tNetflix tried to throw out the lawsuit in 2024, arguing that the show’s creators had a literary license to give their interpretation of events. A federal judge in Delaware denied that motion. \n\n\tNetflix next filed a motion for summary judgment following extensive discovery. That motion was still pending when the case settled.\n\n\tRufus-Isaacs has also filed suits against Netflix on behalf of Nona Gaprindashvili, a Georgian chess champion who alleged she was disparaged in “The Queen’s Gambit”: and on behalf of Francisco “Pipin” Ferreras, who claimed that the film “No Limit” falsely implied that he had killed his wife.\n\t\n\n\tRufus-Isaacs has argued that films based on true events do not enjoy a special exemption from defamation law. While deposing Rhimes in November 2024, he asked her whether she had any rules about fictionalizing the behavior of real people.\n\n\t“We had a position on accurately portraying people based on the facts and their behavior and then fictionalizing moments that made those facts even clearer,” Rhimes said. “I feel like I wanted to capture the essence of what that person was in those moments that we were portraying, and I definitely had a rule that we would never portray a woman in a severely negative way. That’s not what we do. We create three-dimensional people.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Mystery Science Theater 3000” stars Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett know a thing or two about bad movies. \n\n\tWith the news that the show is being revived for four new episodes and the veteran “MST3K” trio are returning, fans have wondered which movies they might skewer. In an interview with Variety, Nelson, Murphy, and Corbett said that they are zeroing in on just the right choices.\n\n\n\t“[Our] eyes are on films that are more like the ones that we used to do — sort of corny, nothing too absolutely current,” Murphy told Variety. “Sort of classic bad, if that makes any sense, rather than modern bad.”\n\t\n\n\tGiven that their Kickstarter campaign for the new episodes blew past its funding goal in a matter of hours, the audience’s appetite for cheesy movies (and seeing these three riff on them) is as strong as ever. Corbett calls the excitement around their return to the show “great and vindicating and exciting and a little terrifying.” But as they are celebrating the 20th anniversary of RiffTrax — largely the spiritual successor to “MST3K” — the trio has certainly not been sitting idle.\n\n\tStill, this marks their first return to “MST3K” both in front of and behind the camera since the original show signed off the Sci-Fi Channel (now Syfy) back in 1999. It is also the beginning of a new era of the show since it was officially announced just a few weeks ago that original creator Joel Hodgson had sold his interest in the series to Shout! Studios parent company Radial Entertainment. \n\n\tBut fans seemingly have little to worry about, as these three are as game as ever to try to keep their sanity with the help of their robot friends. \n\t\n\n\tCheck out the full Q&A below. \n\n\tThis interview was conducted on Feb. 4. It has been edited and condensed.\n\t\n\t\tThe Kickstarter campaign has raised over $1.3 million in just two days. How does it feel to see that kind of support right out of the gate? \t\n\n\tBill Corbett: It feels great and vindicating and exciting and a little terrifying. We have to justify that now, and I think we can. But, you know, it’s been a while. \n\n\tKevin Murphy: It’s really nice that even after all this time, people still have a fondness for the show, the way we did the show. And I think that’s what we’re seeing there. \n\t\n\t\tI looked this up and the budget of the Joe Don Baker film “Mitchell” was $1.16 million, so you did a “Mitchell” in one day. \t\n\n\tMurphy: Wow, we did a “Mitchell!”\n\n\tMichael J. Nelson: We’d have to look at the dollar amount in the calculator and see are we still ahead in today’s money.\n\t\n\t\tWell, no one is ever going to be ahead of Joe Don Baker. \t\n\n\tCorbett: I wouldn’t recommend it. He’d knock you right over.\n\t\n\t\tBut seriously, when did the conversations between RiffTrax and Shout! Studios to bring back “MST3K” start?  \t\n\n\tCorbett: That was at least six months ago, but more, really, I think. Right, guys? Like maybe nine months ago, eight months ago?\n\n\tMurphy: Yeah, it was last year, I think in the spring, but in the meantime, Shout! Factory went through this merger, which sort of delayed things for a while…And they were in the middle of, as everyone learned, acquiring all the rights to the show from Joel.\n\n\tCorbett: I just want to make it clear, we are perfectly happy AARP guys. They asked us. And I think the thing that we came up with that sounds exciting also sounds risky too, like if we don’t recapture the magic, or if somebody gets a glimpse of me and goes, “Oh my god, what happened to him?!” Me specifically. But the thing that I think ameliorated it for us was we said, “Can we take a relatively small bite and do four?”\n\t\n\t\tKevin, you referenced doing the show the way you guys used to do it. What does that mean specifically? \t\n\n\tMurphy: Well, when I first heard that they might want to do this, I talked to our old DP, Jeff Stonehouse…And he said, “Oh, do it old school. We need to do this old school the way that we did it then.” He was such a wizard at doing in-camera effects. And then having all our props hand built, and not relying on any sort of digital compositing or green screen beyond what we need to do in order to make the shadow work and go through the doors, simple things like that…It really makes the thing that much more fun for us and for everyone involved, because it’s all hands on.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAnd you guys are celebrating the 20th anniversary of RiffTrax this year. What sorts of things have you learned in that time that you want to bring to these new episodes of “MST3K?” \t\n\n\tNelson: Well, I would speak for Kevin here. Kevin has learned nothing in 20 years.\n\n\tMurphy: Not a damn thing. Really, one thing I know that we’ve learned to do better is to is how to riff. We’ve learned to take our time, let the movie be the straight person, and set up the jokes for us better. So we have a lot of punch lines. And I know we’ve learned to feel like dead space is not what we think it is. People aren’t yearning for us to keep doing an endless stream of jokes.\n\t\n\t\tIt’s strange to me that outside of “MST3K” and RiffTrax, not too many people have tried to take riffing to the level you all have taken it to. Why do you think that is? \t\n\n\tNelson: I think one of the reasons for that…It’s that it’s really hard to to riff the way that we do. And it’s a writing that’s not very rewarding for the average person who just wants to be a writer…This is very technical writing. I happen to enjoy it. I think everyone that works with us enjoys it and loves that outcome of it, but it is really, really difficult. And I don’t mean to say that — we’re not nuclear sub runners here or anything — but I’m just saying it’s hard. And people often go like, “This sounds like fun!” Then they do it for two minutes and they go “Wow, this is really hard.”\n\n\tCorbett: There is almost an element of masochism in writing it. I mean, I think we’ve gotten over it because we’ve gotten good at it. It’s a weird thing to be good at, but we are absolutely the specialists in the world…We are not intimidated by many movies, although some we just feel like that’s not going to be fun, or that’s one we should just pass on. We have a pretty good nose for movies that are just not going to work. And that’s most of them, really.\n\n\tNelson: We always have some people complain. They’re like, “Hey, why would you do this movie? That’s a good movie!” We’re like, “Yeah, we’ve done a lot of good movies, movies that we like,” but the commentary then would match the thing. If you sit with a good friend of yours and you’re watching a movie that you like, and then he’s riffing on it, you’d say, “Hey, man, come on.” So that’s our intent. We also enjoy this movie, and therefore the comments match it, but we’re still being funny. So that’s a challenge that I actually love.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI know you guys are going to reveal the four movies you’ll be doing over the course of the Kickstarter campaign, but what can you share about them? Are you targeting older movies like “MST3K” typically did or more modern ones? \t\n\n\tMurphy: Well, I’d say since we know that we’re revisiting “Mystery Science Theater,” the way that we knew it and loved it, that our eyes are on films that are more like the ones that we used to do — sort of corny, nothing too absolutely current. Sort of classic bad, if that makes any sense, rather than modern bad…We’re casting the net to find just the right bad for us that fits with the puppets, rather than the three of us and our voices. And there is a little bit of a difference there. “Mystery Science Theater” was always more family friendly. RiffTrax tends to be a little bit…more out there these days.\n\n\tNelson: We hate families at RiffTrax.\n\t\n\t\tThen you announced that all four episodes will be released on RiffTrax later this year. Was there any discussion about partnering with a platform like Netflix like they did for the other revival seasons? \t\n\n\tMurphy: I think we always wanted to do it ourselves, because once someone like Netflix is involved, as good as they are what they do, you’ve got more people maybe wanting to tell you what to do with it, rather than just us. We’re responsible for the success or failure of this thing ourselves, and that feels right. And to have other people –as well meaning as it might be — sticking their fingers in the pie, it’s just not something that I think any of us would be comfortable with. We like finger free pies.\n\n\tCorbett: Get out of my pie! I will also add that…we have had RiffTrax stuff go out on other platforms and the way that they pay you changes depending on what mood they’re in. And it only goes in one direction. So, we don’t want to be at the mercy of that so much either.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFilmmaker Michał Marczak carves out a unique space for his documentary “Closure” within the non-fiction world. The film is set up as a moody mystery about a teenager who disappears one day and his father’s relentless search for him. Yet as it unfolds it cleverly becomes a drama that tries to answer the bigger life questions about family relationships and love. This might sound lofty, but it is actually what this potent humanist film accomplishes. With a standout central protagonist and an urgent quest that is every parent’s nightmare, the film plays like a thriller but manages to deliver honest and piercing emotions at almost every sequence along the way.  \n\t\n\n\t“Closure” starts off with a foreboding scene set along the Vistula river in Warsaw. A man throws a dummy off the bridge into the river, then the camera moves along the heavy currents of the brown water as the same man tries to find the body. This is Daniel, recreating a scenario in which his 16-year-old son Chris threw himself into the river. He’s searching for him and hoping that by recreating this jump, something he isn’t sure even happened, he can find answers. \n\n\n\tChris disappeared one early morning and CCTV footage showed him getting to the bridge. That’s where it ends. Did he jump, taking his own life? Or did he walk back away from the bridge? For months Daniel and his wife Agnieszka have been living in debilitating limbo, hoping that Chris is still alive and will appear back in their lives one day soon. At the same time, Daniel takes matters into his own hands and starts to search the river for his son’s body. While the case is being handled by the police and has been reported in the local media, leading many to join in the search, Daniel’s dogged pursuit becomes his passionate obsession, and he dedicates most of his time to it. \n\t\n\n\tIn Daniel, Marczak found an absolutely spellbinding protagonist. Like a Shakespearean grand character, he is haunted by ghosts of his past while pursuing an almost impossible endeavor in his present. He is always questioning himself, examining his memory for clues of what could have happened to make Chris leave and what he may have missed. Marczak, who shot the film himself, keeps the camera close to Daniel’s face so that the audience is privy to every flicker of emotion and every sign of hope. Marczak captures Daniel in silent despair with his wife Agnieszka, as the parents can’t bring themselves to accept that Chris may never return. Yet Agnieszka also wishes for an end, whatever it may be. In that liminal space, Marczak gives the audience a complete narrative of a family in turmoil and a man conflicted. His probing sensitive camera makes this story utterly palpable. As as the cycle of hope and despair keeps being repeated with hopeful clues that amount to nothing, the audience is engulfed along with the parents into their nightmare. \n\n\tPerhaps most perceptively captivating is the sweetly cunning way Marczak inserts himself into the film. He’s never seen on camera, but his voice is heard probing Daniel to open up and talk about how he is feeling. In these compassionate scenes, “Closure” takes flight and arrives at something resembling its title. Or as close to it as can be in the circumstances. Daniel tries to make sense of losing Chris, and in these conversations he opens up to Marczak, and by extension everyone watching, about what he’s learned and what it will mean for his life with Agnieszka and his other son, Patryk. He arrives at a poignant realization that maybe life is about people helping each other, like he failed to help Chris. Complementing this emotional catharsis is Marczak’s breathtaking cinematography. He plays with light and frame to express melancholy mood. The camera roves around as it follows Daniel in the river under the dense unforgiving water, on the road and into the surrounding forest as the search continues. \n\n\t“Closure” never pretends to be about solving the mystery of a son’s disappearance — instead, it considers the unbearable weight of not finding an answer. Marczak refuses easy answers or narrative release, and that restraint is precisely what makes the film so devastatingly honest. Yet somehow at the same time Daniel, his family and the audience arrive at a complete and moving narrative by the time the film ends. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe winter Olympic games are often seen as more of an appendix to their larger summertime counterparts than a tentpole in themselves. But in 2026, the parallels between Milan — which co-hosts the 25th winter Olympics with Cortina d’Ampezzo, a ski town near the Austrian border — and 2024 host city Paris are impossible to ignore. They also paid dividends in an opening ceremony that, much like the Seine-set one a year and a half ago, drew on the traditions of a European cultural capital to deliver a playful, detail-dense tone setter for the weeks to come. (The ceremony was covered live on NBC and its affiliated streaming service Peacock, preceded by an acknowledgement of “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie’s absence amid the ongoing search for her missing mother.) Even if Milan’s ceremony didn’t match the Paris one in scale, it made for an equally enthusiastic welcome to the world’s largest sporting event.\n\t\n\n\tFrom a dance number that paid homage to the works of sculptor Antonio Canova to a performance of the iconic Puccini aria “Nessun dorma” by singer Andrea Bocelli, the ceremony’s producers opted to emphasize Italian identity throughout. (Apart from a random-seeming cameo by Charlize Theron to encourage peace among nations, that is. At least Mariah Carey sang a bit of Italian when she covered “Volare”!) The creative portion of the ceremony, bracketing the parade of athletes led by guides in full-length parka gowns, spanned high art and low: a procession of models in suits by the namesake house of the late designer Giorgio Armani in the hues of the tricolor Italian flag and a gloriously goofy, Eurovision-esque dance number led by Sabrina Impacciatore of “The White Lotus” and “The Paper.” The Italian ethos spans both refined tailoring and shiny metallic ski suits paired with face glitter, and the ceremony reflected both extremes.\n\t\n\n\tWhile Impacciatore is known to international audiences thanks to her work in American TV, the ceremony incorporated other Italian talents who have yet to become as recognizable on the world stage. Actress and comedian Brenda Lodigiani performed a miming act riffing on the Italian trope of communicating with one’s hands, while actor Pierfrancesco Favino staged a dramatic reading of Giacamo Leopardi’s famous poem “L’Infinito.” Model Vittoria Ceretti, best known stateside for her romantic relationship with Leonardo Dicaprio, acted as a courier for the Italian flag. \n\n\tThe deployment of local talent, which extended even to figures outside the entertainment industry like astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, was a meaningful gesture. But the apotheosis of the ceremony arrived early, and had little to do with individual personalities. An ecstatic dance to Rossini’s “William Tell Overture” united a rainbow-hued cast — dressed as everything from Rome’s Colosseum to Milan’s Duomo to dress cutouts to Moka pots — under three enormous tubes of paint, each representing a primary color. The segment was a gloriously chaotic tribute to Italy’s successes across the arts, and carried the tone even through slower lulls like a call for peace by rapper Ghali, featuring the aforementioned Theron cameo. (Though it is amusing to think of United States Vice President JD Vance, who attended the ceremony with the Second Lady, listening to Theron’s definition of peace as prosperity regardless of race, class or sexuality. Come to think of it, the entire uniting theme of “Armonia,” an agreeable platitude about harmony among nations, felt pointed in the presence of the isolationist Vance.)\n\n\tLike the games themselves, the ceremony was split between Milan’s San Siro Stadium and Alpine venues like Rasen-Antholz, with two separate cauldrons lit via Olympic flame at the evening’s end. The divided focus could sometimes be awkward; I pity the athletes who had to trudge through a snowy street instead of circumnavigating the stadium. But the ceremony did serve to highlight the breadth of Italian geography along with the breadth of Italian culture. The winter Olympics will likely never feel as major as their warm-weather siblings. They can still create grandeur and hometown pride in and of themselves.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Milan Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics kicked off on Friday with an unprecedentedly widespread opening ceremony that was certainly more somber that the Paris 2024 opener but still delivered a classy spectacle and projected an overall elegance that reflects its Italian spirit.\n\n\tHeld in the two host cities and in several Alpine venues, the event featured more than 1,000 performers — including Mariah Carey and Andrea Bocelli — who celebrated Italian history, culture and fashion.\n\t\n\n\tMilan’s San Siro 75,000-seat stadium was the main venue for the roughly three hour live Olympic opener. The ceremony took place amid tight security with thousands of Italian police officers, aided by surveillance drones and robots that patrolled the area around the stadium where dozens of heads of state, including U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, watched the show.\n\n\n\tThe lead-up to the games had been marked by protests over the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who will not be in the streets but are instead there as security for Vance and Rubio, as well as a Russian cyberattack aimed at some Olympics-related websites and hotels. Tensions over the presence of ICE in Italy caused the official hospitality hangout space for the U.S. Olympic team in Milan to undergo a name change from The Ice House to The Winter House.\n\n\tVeteran Olympic ceremonies wizard Marco Balich, who produced the opener, built the multi-location show around the Greek concept of “harmony,” intended to bring together city and mountains, man and nature and the 2,900 athletes from cultures that share the Olympic space.\n\t\n\n\tBalich told Variety that, unlike previous Olympic openers such as the star-studded Paris 2024 opener, “This is the first time we’re going to have a somber ceremony.” Olympics organizers are focusing on deploying less glitz and more ecological sustainability, while still generating lots of excitement.\n\n\tWhich they did, in a more understated manner than the bombastic, and fun, Paris 2024 Olympics spectacle held on the River Seine.\n\n\tRead on for the biggest moments from this year’s Winter Olympics opening ceremony.\n\t\n\t\tWelcome to Italy\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t06 February 2026, Italy, Mailand: Olympia, Olympic Winter Games Milan Cortina 2026, opening ceremony in Milan, San Siro, dancers from the Accademia del Teatro alla Scala perform during the opening ceremony under the motto “Armonia”.

Canova’s 18th century statue depicting the myth of Cupid and Psyche was brought to life on stage, intending to become symbolic tale of attraction, transformation, and union, visually embodying the concept of  “Armonia,” or “Harmony” in English, that organizers say is inspired by the word’s original Greek meaning of a harmony as a dialogue between diverse elements. \n\n\tThe piece, in which the stadium was transformed into a living museum, featured 70 young dancers from Milan’s Accademia del Teatro alla Scala. This segment showcased reproductions of four iconic works by Antonio Canova: the Venus Italica, the Genius of Death, the Bust of Paris, and the Naiad.\n\t\n\t\tItalian Harmony: Fantasia\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMatilda De Angelis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tItalian actress Matilda De Angelis (C) performs during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games at the San Siro stadium in Milan, northern Italy, on February 6, 2026.

The music shifted between different registers: from a trumpet reminiscent of Nino Rota’s film scores for Federico Fellini movies to a stadium choir, then from an Antonio Vivaldi aria to the pop music of the late Raffaella Carrà, the iconic Italian singer, actor, and dancer who was a TV sensation across Europe and Latin America. \n\n\tThe musical medley culminated in an electronic remix of of Gioachino Rossini’s opera “La Gazza Ladra” and ended with the aria “Vincerò” from Giacomo Puccini’s “Turandot,” performed by the late great Luciano Pavarotti, in a recorded version.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tGrand Parade/Mariah Carey Sings\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMariah Carey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUS singer Mariah Carey performs during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games at the San Siro stadium in Milan, northern Italy, on February 6, 2026. (Photo by WANG Zhao / AFP via Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA grand parade of characters inspired by symbolic categories of Italian creativity through the ages culminated in Mariah Carey Carey, surrounded by a kaleidoscope of colours on stage, performing entirely in Italian for the first time. Carey sang Domenico Modugno’s “Nel Blu, dipinto di Blu” – known internationally as “Volare.”\n\n\tWritten by Domenico Modugno and performed at the 1958 Sanremo Festival, “Volare,” with its famous refrain – “volare! oh, oh!” – marked a milestone in the history of Italian song, becoming a global phenomenon and winning two Grammy Awards, an unprecedented achievement for Italian music at the time. Carey’s “Volare” performance was conceived as a symbolic gesture, again underscoring the event’s “harmony” theme and the ambition to highlight local culture while giving the broadcast global appeal. \n\n\tCarey segued from “Volare” into her hit single “Nothing is Impossible” from the 2025 studio album “Here For It All.” She wore a an Art Deco-inspired gown featuring beads and crystals on the bodice, waist and skirt. And a diamond necklace, earrings and bracelet, valued at $15 million.\n\t\n\t\tPresidential Entrance, Followed By Giorgio Armani Tribute\t\n\n\tThe President of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella, and the President of the International Olympic Committee, Kirsty Coventry, took their seats in the San Siro grandstand.\n\n\tTheir symbolic grand entrance was followed by a fashion show inspired by the Italian flag and based on one of Armani’s last drawings before he died at 91 last September.\n\n\tThree groups of models walked the runway wearing Armani creations in green, white, and red, transforming the Italian flag into a living image. It was a moment of collective recognition, a tribute to Italian fashion and the elegance of one of its most celebrated figures.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMILAN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 06: Models wearing creations designed by Giorgio Armani walk during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics at San Siro Stadium on February 06, 2026 in Milan, Italy.

(Photo by Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMilan joined Cortina in this unprecedented multi-location ceremony, with the Olympic circles multiplying in a dance number that embraced the city and the mountains, until they recomposed into the emblem of the Games, with music played by a Stradivarius violin as accompaniment. As the Olympic emblem appeared, the ceremony shifted into multi-location mode.\n\t\n\t\tFirst Widespread Parade of Athletes\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTOPSHOT – Iran’s flag bearers Danyal Saveh Shemshaki (R) and Samaneh Beyrami Baher parade during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games at the Predazzo Ski Jumping Stadium in Predazzo (Val di Fiemme), on February 6, 2026. (Photo by Javier SORIANO / AFP via Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tReflecting the fact that these are the most spread out Olympics in the games’ history, the athletes’ parade took place in the sites closest to where they will compete. Milan’s San Siro Olympic Stadium is hosting the athletes competing in ice sports. Livigno has the Livigno Snowboard Park. So athletes competing in Bormio and Livigno will compete in freestyle skiing, snowboard, and also men’s Alpine skiing. Predazzo has the ski jumping stadium. And Cortina will host athletes in ski jumping, cross-country skiing and Nordic combined, besides sliding sports and curling, among others.\n\n\tOrganizers are proud of pulling off the feat of transforming the geography of the Games into what they call a single, shared stage with TV coverage weaving it into a seamless narrative. There are more than 2900 athletes from 92 participating delegations, including four skiers from Iran. Benin, Guinea-Bissau, and the United Arab Emirates are participating for the first time.\n\n\tRussian skiers and lugers at the Games are not displaying a national identity with team colors, a flag or an anthem and were not part of the opening ceremony.\n\n\tThe last team to parade was host Italy. As soon as they began, the music switched to the rambunctious “Largo Al Factotum” number from Rossini’s “The Barber of Seville.” \n\t\n\t\tSabrina Impacciatore Dazzles With Time-Traveling Musical Number\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMILAN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 06: Sabrina Impacciatore performs a musical during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics at San Siro Stadium on February 06, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSabrina Impacciatore, known to U.S. audiences for roles in “The White Lotus” and “The Paper,” performed a time-traveling musical number celebrating 100 years of Winter Olympics history featuring a panoply of on-stage costumes, including a fabulous vintage ski outfit designed by Emilio Pucci for jet-setting Princess Soraya of Iran who wore it in Cortina where Italy’s first Winter games were held in 1956.\n\n\tThat year no artificial snow was used in Cortina. But in today’s global warming world there are plans for snow cannons to spew nearly 2.4 million cubic meters (3.1 million cubic yards) of fine-grained flakes. Organisers are vowing to use entirely renewable energy to power the cannons which should guarantee sufficient cover for the 116 Olympic medal events scheduled over 17 days.\n\t\n\n\tImpacciatore’s live stage performance featured scenes spanning from the 1920s to the 1990s, and into the present day, with a musical selection featuring jazz and swing music, and iconic Italian singer Adriano Celentano’s hit song “Prisencolinensinainciusol,” considered the first Italian rap song ever written. The song’s improvised text is an invented language that phonetically mimics English.\n\n\t“Prisencolinensinainciusol,” which is said by Celentano to stand for universal love, features in Spike Lee’s film “Highest 2 Lowest” recorded by Aiyana-Lee with the title “Prisencolin (Americano Joint).”\n\t\n\t\tItalian President Opens the Games – Bocelli Sings “Nessun Dorma”\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMILAN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 06: Andrea Boccelli performs during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics at San Siro Stadium on February 06, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrom the presidential box, the President of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella, officially declared the Olympic Winter Games Milan Cortina 2026 open. Then a pair of torchbearers entered the stadium, kicking off a symbolic relay. The Olympic flame was first entrusted to a group of three Italian athletes and then the relay movement continued uninterrupted. The sequence was segued by Andrea Bocelli belting out Puccini’s aria “Nessun Dorma” culminating in the flame’s exit from San Siro, symbolically opening the path for the Games to kick off beyond the ceremony venue.\n\t\n\t\tCharlize Theron Delivers Message of Peace\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMILAN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 06: Charlize Theron, UN Peace Ambassador, delivers a speech inspired by Nelson Mandela during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics at San Siro Stadium on February 06, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscar-winning actor Charlize Theron addressed the opening ceremony as a U.N. Messenger of Peace, delivering a message of hope inspired by Nelson Mandela.\n\n\t“Peace is not just the absence of conflict. Peace is the creation of an environment where all can flourish, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, gender, class, caste or any other social markers of difference,” Theron said. “Today, this message seems more relevant than ever. So let these games be more than just sport. Let them be a reminder of our common humanity, our respect for one another, and a resounding call for peace everywhere.”\n\n\tThe South African-born actor, known for her performances in “Monster,” “Bombshell” and “Mad Max: Fury Road,” spoke during the ceremony’s protocol segment focused on the Olympic Truce and symbols of peace. Her address concluded a section exploring peace symbols found across different cultures, religions and traditions, representing reconciliation, hope and the rejection of violence.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLang Lang and Cecilia Bartoli Light up San Siro\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMILAN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 06: Cecelia Bartoli performs a song with Lang Lang performing a piano piece during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics at San Siro Stadium on February 06, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter the Olympic flag was raised simultaneously in Milan and Cortina, mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli sang the Olympic anthem accompanied by Lang Lang, clad in white at a white grand piano, and the Teatro alla Scala Children’s Choir. Their performance was followed by the Olympic oath performed in Italian. The oath was first pronounced by Belgian athlete Victor Boin at the Games of the VII Olympiad Antwerp in 1920. The oath of the modern Games was originally written by Pierre de Coubertin, the French educator and historian who founded the International Olympic Committee but it has been modified over time.\n\t\n\t\tGrand Finale: Olympics Flame and Lighting of the Cauldrons\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinal torchbearer Italian skier Sofia Goggia (C) uses the torch of the Olympic flame to light the Olympic cauldron designed by Marco Balich during the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Cortina d’Ampezzo, northern Italy, on February 6, 2026. (Photo by Stefano RELLANDINI / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn Milan and Cortina, for the first time in the history of the Winter Olympics, the flame was passed from hand to hand to reach two Olympic cauldrons, one for each host city. The one in Milan is at the Arco della Pace (Peace Arch) that is one of the city’s iconic monuments and represents the idea of peace achieved after conflict. The cauldron in Cortina is in the central Piazza Dibona. \n\n\tBoth cauldrons feature more than 1,400 parts and are modelled after the intricate knot design of Leonardo da Vinci’s “Nodi Vinciani.” Leonardo embedded these intricate knot patterns in several of his masterpieces, including the tapestry in the Last Supper and the decorative embroidery on the neckline of the Mona Lisa. The flame became transformed into Armonia, the ceremony’s overriding theme. Fireworks and a cascade of sparks from the Olympic rings followed.\n\n\tIn the U.S., the Games are getting full-court-press treatment from NBC and Peacock. In Europe, HBO Max is streaming the Olympic competition alongside local broadcasters.\n\n\tAs for American representation, the U.S. is fielding its largest Winter Olympics team ever, with 232 athletes including Lindsey Vonn, whose comeback attempt at age 41 is being threatened by the recent rupture of her left anterior cruciate ligament. We will known on Sunday if Vonn manages to compete.\n\n\tLet the Games begin!\n",

    "description": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following story contains plot details from “Eyes Without a Face,” Season 4, Episode 5 of “Industry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n",
    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following story contains plot details from “Eyes Without a Face,” Season 4, Episode 5 of “Industry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tOn “Industry,” heroes are hard to come by. But in the HBO series’ audacious Season 4, Sweetpea Golightly (Miriam Petche) is about the closest the show gets to one. Introduced in Season 3 as an entry-level employee at the since-collapsed bank Pierpoint & Co., Sweetpea fit right into the finance drama’s salacious intrigue, where sex is often just as transactional as the latest high-stakes business deal. In addition to her day job as an eager new analyst, Sweetpea had a side hustle on OnlyFans, where she sold pictures to the same older businessmen who talked down to her on the trading floor. Along with her name, Sweetpea’s extracurricular pursuits helped her quickly stand out even in a cast stacked with rising stars.\n\n\tIn Season 4, however, Sweetpea’s starting from a more vulnerable place. Her anonymous accounts have been made public, thanks to recently disgraced dirtbag Rishi Ramdani (Sagar Radia); now, the only job she can get in her career field of choice is working for Harper Stern (Myha’la), a Machiavellian striver who’s allergic to intimacy, and hardly a reliable boss. But beggars can’t be choosers, so Sweetpea follows Harper from Mostyn Asset Management to her independent venture SternTao. On “Industry,” however, underdogs are always the best motivated to succeed — and in the season’s fifth episode, “Eyes Without a Face,” Sweetpea finally gets her time to shine.\n\n\tHarper had previously bet the fate of SternTao, a shorts-only fund that makes money when its targets fail, on the demise of Tender, a fintech start-up that’s suspiciously pivoted from facilitating porn payments to making growth-minded acquisitions in Africa. With SternTao’s short position squeezed by Tender’s stubbornly ascendant stock price, Harper agrees to send Sweetpea and Kwabena (Toheeb Jimoh), another SternTao trader Harper also happens to be sleeping with, to Ghana so they can take a look at Tender on the ground. There, Sweetpea puts her dogged investigation skills to use and returns with proof hard enough to save SternTao from ruin. Now Harper won’t have to commit fraud to secure more funding!\n\n\tThis being “Industry,” the win comes at a cost. On a quest to track down Swift GC, a company Tender acquired for an eyebrow-raising $50 million, Sweetpea goes to their office (it’s a PO Box), interrogates the M&A lawyer (his tiny office doesn’t scream “massive deals”) and interrogates Tender’s Africa chief Tony Day (Stephen Campbell) under the pretense that she still works at Mostyn. Day smells a rat and gives Sweetpea a blandly threatening phone call while she and Kwabena are kicking back a few beers on the beach. Shortly afterward, Sweetpea goes to the bathroom, where she’s assaulted by a stranger who breaks her nose along with her sense of security. \n\n\tRather than back down, Sweetpea resolves to “run a fucking train” on her adversaries. (She also sleeps with Kwabena to blow off some steam.) The men who look down on her for sex work are mostly faceless, but Tender offers a more specific target for her frustration. Luckily, a family friend of Kwabena’s provides the missing piece of the Swift GC transaction: Tender only said they paid $50 million for the company, which is little more than a decrepit office building. The falsely inflated acquisition was primarily a way of getting falsely inflated revenue off the books before prying eyes could apply real scrutiny. Having uncovered Tender’s house of cards, Sweetpea makes her triumphant return to London — but rather than accept Harper’s offer of a shoulder to cry on, Sweetpea flatly comes clean about the Kwabena hookup, makes clear she expects to be paid, and heads back to her apartment to break down in sobs.\n\n\t“She believes that if she can see this through, then she is of some value that she feels she’s lost,” Petche says of her character’s motivation for seeing the Tender takedown through. A recent graduate of the prestigious Guildhall conservatory, Petche is, like Sweetpea, a relative newcomer who’s quickly established herself in a high-pressure environment. Petche spoke with Variety about shooting on location, how getting doxxed has affected Sweetpea’s mindset and what “Industry” has taught her about the art of making good TV. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThis season is such a great one for Sweetpea overall. Headed into it, did you have a conversation with creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay about where they saw the character going?\t\n\n\tI had a call with one of our producers much earlier on, specifically about Episode 5, before I’d even got the scripts for Episodes 1 and 2 and 3 and 4. So it was more just keeping that conversation alive and making me aware of what was going on, because this episode is so crucial — not only for Sweetpea, but for the arc of the season. I was like, “OK, I need to understand how she gets here. If she’s arriving here emotionally, what do I need to do, working backwards, to build up to this moment? If this is the peak of her arc, how do I plan every step before and then after?”\n\t\n\t\tI assume that call was partly about going on location. Can you tell me a bit about filming in Africa?\t\n\n\tWe actually went to South Africa. We went to Durban in South Africa for, actually, a very short while. Most of the episode was filmed in Cardiff in the U.K. So there were only the shots that we couldn’t really — the ones that were necessary for us to be on location. For example, the beach shot, the moments when me and Toheeb are at the beach bar. \n\n\n\tI mean, going on location is obviously so incredible as an actor, because you’re put into a different set of circumstances. But it wasn’t the entirety of the episode, which was a very interesting way to do it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tChronologically, how did the Durban trip slot into the shoot?\t\n\n\tIt was at the very end. So we had done everything else and then, if I remember correctly, it was at the very end of that episode. It was pretty much 72 hours we were out there. It was a very, very, very short time. It was this whirlwind experience of wrapping up this episode.\n\t\n\t\tAfter what happened to Rishi’s wife in the Season 3 finale, the possibilities for the show widened, and violent, scary things can happen. So as a viewer, the bathroom scene was quite alarming — I was curious what that scene was like for you to film as an actor.\t\n\n\tI personally feel like that scene isn’t played for shock value. I think what matters the most to Sweetpea is this loss of control and safety, and how her sense of agency over the situation very quickly dissipates. And then from that moment on, she becomes different in her approach to Tender, to relationships. It really stays with her for a long time after that moment itself. \n\t\n\n\tWith the practical part, you want to make sure everyone is safe and everyone feels happy. We had stunt coordination. Everyone was checking in with one another. It’s like choreography, like anything that needs to be done with care. You go through it step by step, moment by moment, making sure everyone feels that they know what’s happening. Once you understand the choreography, you can then effectively communicate the scene to the audience. Once you have those steps in place, you can then really engage with the scene.\n\t\n\t\tYou speaking about Sweetpea feeling a loss of agency and control reminds me of how she must be feeling in the wake of this horrible violation and doxxing that she’s experienced. Do those feel like similar mindsets to you?\t\n\n\tI think that in Episode 5, the stakes for her are quite existential. I think she pushes through these extremes, not because she feels admirable or she feels heroic, but because these stakes are so existential for her. This is her career, her credibility — and really, at the end of the day — her sense of self-worth. She believes that if she can see this through, then she is of some value that she feels she’s lost. It’s the lengths that she’ll go to to prove herself, and as seen at the end of the episode, what it costs her to keep going. But I think that loss of agency is implemented at the very beginning of the season, like you said, with the OnlyFans leak. I think this is her grappling with having a sense of control over her own narrative.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen Sweetpea and Kwabena talk about if there needs to be a “why,” I agree your character doesn’t need one for pursuing sex work. But in terms of her motivation for being in this incredibly cutthroat industry and working as hard as we see her work this season, what do you feel like propels her in this financial world?\t\n\n\tI think that she is a person who believes her worth has to be proven, and that’s why she’s drawn to this high stakes environment. Because if she does these things, and if she’s brilliant enough, and if she’s useful enough and indispensable enough, then she can survive anything, even if it costs her emotionally or physically. She thinks that her brilliance is her safety. And I think what specifically this episode shows us is that it doesn’t keep her safe at all. In fact, it kind of collides with everything that’s going on. At the end of the episode, when she breaks down, I feel like that moment is the price of her composure finally being paid off. I wanted that moment to just feel like a relief and a letting go of everything from this season and the episode.\n\t\n\t\tThis episode also moves the Sweetpea-Harper relationship forward. On the one hand, Harper gives Sweetpea this job where no one else will. But at the same time, Sweetpea seems very clear-eyed about Harper’s faults and says no to her coming upstairs. What do you feel like Sweetpea’s attitude toward Harper is?\t\n\n\tTheir relationship is fascinating to me, because when I go back to Season 3 in my mind, when Sweetpea joins Pierpoint, Harper has already left. So all she has is these stories of Harper. I think Sweetpea admires Harper and sees her as this uncompromising, extremely intelligent, self-driven woman. So when Sweetpea has the opportunity to work with Harper, she grasps it with both hands. But then when they’re working with each other, the idealized version of someone gives way to the real person, and you realize what they’re actually like. There’s a frustration from Sweetpea that Harper, particularly at the beginning of the season, isn’t operating at her highest level for the entire team. And it frustrates Sweetpea, because she sees how brilliant Harper is, and how brilliant she can be. \n\t\n\n\tShe’s never really had an issue in saying that to her, or being quite blunt with her about how she feels. When she sees Harper not working for the team’s best interests, there’s this mix of admiration but frustration. When you want someone to be different, it’s a very interesting dynamic. Particularly in Episode 5, when Sweetpea comes back and says, “I want to be paid.” She’s putting up these walls to protect herself from what’s been taken on that trip away. She’s sort of protecting herself from the world.\n\t\n\t\tThere’s also a fascinating contrast between your character and Toheeb’s where Sweetpea comes straight out and says, “I hooked up with this person you’re also hooking up with,” and he doesn’t take the opportunity to be honest. You see that streak in Sweetpea where she’s able to be very straightforward, very blunt. Where do you think that tendency comes from with the character?\t\n\n\tFunnily enough, when I was thinking about who she was in Season 3, I think she observes people around her. I think she observes how people succeed. I think she observed how people succeeded within the world of Pierpoint. She’s aware that it’s a very cutthroat dynamic. And I think that she psyched herself up to say, well, if I want to succeed, I have to be like the people that I’ve seen be successful before me. I have to be cutthroat. I have to be honest. I have to have an opinion. And maybe part of that confidence initially is bravado. Initially, it’s fake it until you make it, and then as time progresses, and particularly within this season, she is a lot more upfront with her genuine opinions and feelings. That bravado has given away to this woman who actually really wants to be very good at her job. So yeah, it’s a mix of learned behavior and also innately what was already there that she’s now giving space to as well.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHarper has become so compromised, and in contrast, Sweetpea is incredibly easy to root for. As the person who plays her, are you worried at all that over the long term, she will become a little more corrupted?\t\n\n\tI am worried for her! I am worried for her, but it’s also one of the things I love about the show. These characters aren’t straightforward. They are morally complex, like human beings can be. They can change over time, and they can be one way one year, and a completely different person the year next. That’s what I really liked when I watched the first two seasons, before I was in the show — that you could be rooting for a character, and then the rug would be pulled from underneath you, and you think, “Oh, no, why did you do that?” That’s what I found endearing about the show. So I suppose, as much as I personally want the best for Sweetpea, I think that in line with the show, if she finds herself in some more complex situations or doing some more compromising things, I would understand why the character might have gone in that direction.\n\t\n\t\tLike a lot of other people who have come into their own on the show, you’re very early in your career. What have you learned from being on this particular show that you hope to take forward with you into other projects?\t\n\n\tI learned how TV is made, to be honest with you.\n\t\n\t\tThat’s important!\t\n\n\tIt really, honestly is. I like to know everything that’s going on. I’m like Sweetpea in that way. And honestly, it’s really helpful as an actor. I went to drama school, and you’re prepared with technique and emotional insight and all of these things. But I wasn’t taught about how a show is made, what it means to be a part of a season, how a set works. I’ve learned so much from this show, not only just technically as an actor, but just professionally.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\t\n",

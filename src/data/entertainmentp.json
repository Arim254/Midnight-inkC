    "body": "\n\tNBC is ending its linear run of Peacock’s “The Paper” earlier than expected. Instead, starting on Jan. 5, NBC will air episodes of its freshman comedy “Stumble” in the Monday at 8:30 p.m. ET time slot — where broadcast-friendly versions of “The Paper” have been airing since Nov. 10. \n\n\tNew episodes of “Stumble” will continue to air on Fridays at 8:30 p.m., behind “Happy’s Place.” But NBC execs hope to give “Stumble” some extra exposure by placing repeats, starting with the show’s pilot episode, on Mondays behind “St. Denis Medical.”\n\t\n\n\tThat means “The Paper” won’t quite get a full 10-episode run on Mondays, but NBC plans to air the remaining three episodes on Saturday, Jan. 3. That show, of course, has been available on Peacock since Sept. 4 — where viewers can already catch the entire Season 1 run. And an option for Season 2 of “The Paper” was already picked up, which means the show will return with more episodes in 2026 on the streamer.\n\n\n\tNBC execs hope to add more momentum to “Stumble,” which will air in the additional Monday slot through Feb. 2 (with the exception of an NBA game on Jan. 19). That Monday 8:30 p.m. slot will eventually be taken over by new comedy “The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins,” which premieres with an hour-long episode on Feb. 23 at 8 p.m. ET, before settling into 8:30 p.m. the following week, on March 2.\n\n\t“The Paper,” which is Peacock’s No. 2 comedy so far (behind only “Ted”), added nearly 6 million viewers to its cross-platform reach during the NBC run, according to the network. When it originally decided to air a second run of “The Paper” on NBC, folks in the know said an internal study showed that there was only around 4% duplication in viewership between NBC and Peacock audiences. Peacock viewers are also about a decade younger than those for NBC, and the network hoped this would expose “The Paper” to a very different demographic.\n\t\n\n\tAs for “Stumble,” the show was created by Jeff Astrof and Liz Astrof, and is set in the competitive world of junior college cheer squads. The series stars Jenn Lyon, as well as Taran Killam, Ryan Pinkston, Jarrett Austin Brown, Anissa Borrego, Arianna Davis, Taylor Dunbar and Georgie Murphy, while Kristin Chenoweth is billed as a recurring guest star. Other guest stars in Season 1 include Jeff Hiller, Ashlie Atkinson and Dascha Polanco.\n\n\tThe Astrofs are executive producers, along with Dana Honor and Monica Aldama (from Netflix’s “Cheer”). Jeff Blitz is director/EP. Universal TV is the studio behind the single camera comedy, which has been picked up for 13 episodes in Season 1. \n\n\tVariety TV critic Aramide Tinubu gave the show a thumb’s up, calling it “a hysterical mockumentary about the high-stakes arena of junior college cheerleading. For viewers who adored the ‘Cheer’ docuseries and Aldama’s no-nonsense approach to coaching, this light-hearted twist on that world introduces a cast of wildly colorful characters and a woman determined to win, no matter the cost.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tA “60 Minutes” report yanked by Bari Weiss about the “horrific treatment” of detainees deported from the U.S. to a prison in El Salvador has leaked ",
    "body": "\n\tA “60 Minutes” report yanked by Bari Weiss about the “horrific treatment” of detainees deported from the U.S. to a prison in El Salvador has leaked online after appearing on a Canadian TV app. Canada’s Global News aired the “60 Minutes” episode without the segment on television, as did CBS, but the network’s Global TV app mistakenly uploaded the wrong episode to its streaming app.\n\n\tFootage of the nearly 14-minute segment circulated on social media despite being pulled from the CBS News schedule about three hours before airtime on Sunday. In the segment, reviewed by Variety, correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi interviewed a man forcibly removed from the U.S. and sent to the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT) prison by the Trump administration, despite having no criminal record.\n\t\n\n\t“There was blood everywhere, screams, people crying, people who couldn’t take it and were urinating and vomiting on themselves,” said Luis Munoz Pinto, a college student in Venezuela who sought asylum in the U.S. He said he spent six months detained by customs, waiting for a decision on his asylum case, before he was deported.\n\n\n\t“Four guards grabbed me, and they beat me until I bled, until the point of agony. They knocked our faces against the wall. That was when they broke one of my teeth,” Pinto added.\n\n\tCBS News has not yet commented on the leak.\n\n\tOn Monday morning, the network’s editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, told staffers she axed the report on Saturday “because it wasn’t ready,” although “60 Minutes” correspondents felt it was “not an editorial decision” but “a political one.” According to The New York Times, Weiss suggested “numerous changes to the segment” and wanted it to feature an interview with Stephen Miller or another senior Trump administration official. She said the piece was centered on information that had already been reported by the Times, and “we simply need to do more.”\n\t\n\n\tAlfonsi said she already requested comment from the Department of Homeland Security, the White House and the State Department. In a leaked email to her CBS colleagues on Sunday, Alfonsi wrote, “Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices. It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”\n\n\tThe last-minute decision to pull a “60 Minutes” segment critical of the Trump administration comes after repeated complaints by the president about “unfair treatment” by the David Ellison-owned network. On Dec. 16, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before. If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!” A week before that, Trump blasted “60 Minutes” for its interview with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom he called a “very poorly prepared Traitor,” and said of parent company Paramount: “THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP.”\n\n\tEllison’s Paramount Skydance has launched a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, attempting to convince shareholders to reject WBD’s agreed upon deal with Netflix, which is set to acquire the Warner Bros. studios operations and HBO Max. Trump previously asserted that he would be “involved” in approving the M&A deal, which would require sign-offs from regulators including the U.S. Justice Department and FTC. \n\n\tEarlier this year, Ellison’s Skydance Media acquired Paramount Global in an $8 billion deal. A few months later, Ellison announced a deal reportedly worth $150 million to acquire Weiss’ independent media outlet The Free Press, appointing Weiss as CBS News’ head of editorial. Those moves were seen as an attempt to improve CBS News’ standing with Trump and the MAGA movement. Since then, Weiss has moderated a town hall with Erika Kirk, the CEO of right-wing advocacy group Turning Point USA and the widow of Charlie Kirk, and promised future events with guests like JD Vance and Sam Altman. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMichael Douglas says he and Rob Reiner often connected over their sons’ troubles before the “Stand by Me” director was killed.\n\n\tAs part of CBS’ “Rob Reiner – Scenes from a Life” special, Douglas said dealing with the addiction of his own son, Cameron Douglas, helped him relate to Reiner and the problems with his son, Nick.\n\n\t“I also had a son who had had drug issues. I’m happy to say he’s overcome them and living a prosperous life,” Douglas said. The two-time Oscar winner added that he and Reiner would “talk a lot about that and what you can do as a parent, what you can’t do.”\n\t\n\n\tReiner and his wife, Michele Singer, were found stabbed to death in their home on Dec. 14. Their son, Nick, was arrested hours later and, on Tuesday afternoon, he was charged with two counts of murder in the death of his parents. The LAPD later said in a statement, “Nick Reiner, the 32-year-old son of Robert and Michele Reiner, was responsible for their deaths.”\n\n\tDouglas called Reiner’s death a “terrible tragedy,” later adding, “Knowing with all of that going on behind the scenes, this was a man who always gave it his best.”\n\n\tReiner and Douglas collaborated on the 1995 political drama “The American President” and the 2014 romance, “And So It Goes.”\n\n\tDouglas’ son was released from prison in 2016 after serving roughly seven years in prison from drug related charges.\n\n\tThe CBS special also included interviews with Jerry O’Connell, Kathy Bates, Albert Brooks, Annette Bening and Mandy Patinkin.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tJust in time for the peak of holiday programming, Christina Aguilera is set to spread holiday cheer across homes tonight. “Christina Aguilera: Christmas in Paris,” a musical special that doubles as both a concert and a reflection on her career, will air Monday night at 9 p.m. ET/PT on CBS and stream live for subscribers on Paramount+.\n\n\tThe one-hour live event marks the 25th anniversary of Aguilera’s beloved 2000 holiday album “My Kind of Christmas,” and will capture the Grammy-winning artist performing festive classics and career highlights against the stunning backdrop of the Eiffel Tower,  transformed into a luminous Christmas tree, atop a terrace above the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris. \n\n\n\tFans can expect a blend of Aguilera’s powerhouse vocals and intimate moments woven throughout the program. The setlist features holiday standards, Aguilera’s own classics and special guest appearances, including performances with percussion legend Sheila E. and French star Yseult. Between numbers, Aguilera is set to share personal reflections on “love, motherhood, reinvention,” according to a CBS press release.\n\n\tThe event will broadcast live on CBS but the best way for cable-cutters to tune in is on Paramount+. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can stream the CBS broadcast live through the service’s live TV feed, making it easy to watch on phones, tablets, smart TVs or streaming devices. Those with a Paramount+ Essential plan won’t get live access, but the special will be available on demand the day after it airs.\n\n\tFans can also access the CBS broadcast through other live TV streamers such as DirecTV, Hulu + Live TV and Fubo TV — all of which offer free trials.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Mighty Ducks” star Shaun Weiss posted on social media Monday that he is offering help to Tylor Chase, a former child actor who appeared on the Nickelodeon series “Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide.” Chase recently went viral after a social media video showed him homeless and living on the streets of Riverside, Calif. \n\n\t“I have received many messages about [Tylor Chase],” Weiss said in a video shared to his Instagram. “I reached out to some friends of mine, and we have a bed for him at a detox, and we have a place for him to go and get long-term treatment.”\n\t\n\n\tWeiss added, “All we need to do now is find him. I’m not in Los Angeles, or I would go look for him myself.” He noted that if anyone can “get a face-to-face” with Chase, “please DM me so we can get him some help in time for the holiday.”\n\n\tChase played Martin Qwerly, a talkative and intelligent middle school student, on “Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide” throughout the show’s three-season run. His other credits include an appearance on “Everybody Hates Chris” and a role in the 2007 indie film “Good Time Max,” starring James Franco.\n\n\tIn the viral video of Chase, the person recording asks if he was on Disney Channel, to which the former child actor clarifies that he was on Nickelodeon. When asked the name of the show, he responds, “‘Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide.'”\n\n\tWeiss is best known for portraying goalie Greg Goldberg in the 1992 film “The Mighty Ducks,” along with its sequels “D2: The Mighty Ducks” and “D3: The Mighty Ducks.” He has been open about his sobriety journey, including sharing in 2022 that he celebrated his two-year anniversary of sobriety, writing the caption, “Recovery is possible.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tOona Chaplin is the actor behind “Avatar: Fire and Ash” villain Varang. She’s also the granddaughter of film icon Charlie Chaplin. Oona, whose credits also include “Game of Thrones,” recently told The Times of London that she considered changing her name after graduating from Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and starting her pursuit of a full-time acting career.\n\n\t“It’s been a journey to feel deserving, because I know that doors have opened for me that potentially wouldn’t have opened if I wasn’t associated with this brilliant man,” Oona Chaplin said. “It’s definitely tricky to feel undeserving of the place you’re in.”\n\t\n\n\tShe decided against changing her name, however, because her mindset shifted “from guilt to gratitude by working really hard and knowing that whatever I do is never going to compare to what my grandfather did. If all my purpose in this realm is for people to say, ‘Oh, Charlie Chaplin’s granddaughter’, and they google him and watch a movie of his, then I’m happy because he’s such a genius.”\n\n\tOona’s mother, Geraldine Chaplin, was Charlie’s daughter and was also an actor in her own right. While “Avatar: Fire and Ash” marks Oona’s first major Hollywood blockbuster film, she’s been acting professionally since 2007. Her credits also include “Taboo,” “The Crimson Field” and “Black Mirror.”\n\n\tThe actor told The Times of London that she believes Charlie Chaplin “would’ve been on board” with the “Avatar” movies, adding: “I feel like James Cameron is probably one of the closest things that we have to Chaplin now, even though they’re really different. They know what they’re talking about, so people listen.” \n\t\n\n\tCameron told IndieWire during his latest “Avatar” press tour that he was originally “seeing women whose names you would know instantly, who were already stars and people that I had really wanted to work with” when he was casting the role of Varang. \n\n\t“It was a hard decision to turn against faces and names that I already knew, but Oona surprised me with her perception of the character, her way of moving, and her utter fearlessness,” he added about casting Chaplin. “And she was well-prepared — she knew the scene cold, and it was seven or eight pages.”\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” is now playing in theaters nationwide.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVince Zampella, the co-creator of hit video game franchise “Call of Duty,” died in a single-car accident on Sunday near Los Angeles, NBC LA confirmed Monday. He was 55. \n\n\tZampella was involved in a Ferrari crash on Southern California’s Angeles Crest Highway around 12:45 p.m. on Sunday. The accident happened north of Los Angeles in the San Gabriel Mountain as the car was heading south and hit a concrete barrier. The car caught on fire, and the driver was pronounced dead at the scene, according to NBC Los Angeles. The passenger was ejected from the vehicle and later died at a hospital.\n\t\n\n\t“This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work,” video game company EA said in a statement. “Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.”\n\n\n\tWith Jason West, Zampella was the co-founder of video game developer Infinity Ward, which created the hugely successful “Call of Duty” series in 2003. After being fired by parent company Activision, for which he later sued for wrongful termination and received a settlement, Zampella co-founded Respawn Entertainment in 2010. After Zampella left in 2013, the studio was acquired by EA and went on to make hit games like “Titanfall,” “Apex Legends,” “Star Wars Jedi: Survivor” and more. In 2021, EA put Zampella in charge of the popular “Battlefield” franchise.\n\t\n\n\tZampella started out in the video game industry at publisher GameTek, then later met West while working at SegaSoft. They became lead designers on 2002’s “Medal of Honor: Allied Assault,” a first-person military shooter that was set during WWII and counted Steven Spielberg as a co-writer.\n\n\tZampella and West founded Infinity Ward along with Grant Collier in 2002, and the company made a deal with Activision to create a rival to “Medal of Honor.” That would become “Call of Duty,” dubbed their “‘Medal of Honor’ Killer.” Under Zampella’s leadership, Infinity Ward released four “Call of Duty” games, including the mega hit “Modern Warfare.”\n\n\t“Call of Duty” has gone on to become of the most prolific and successful video game series of all time. It’s the third best-selling franchise in the world after “Mario” and “Tetris.” The games have sold more than 500 million copies of its games, has 100 million monthly players and has generated more than $30 billion. In October, it was announced that Taylor Sheridan would direct a live-action “Call of Duty” movie for Paramount.\n",

    "description": "\n\tFans left the Dec. 19 performance of “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” buzzing after a once-in-a-lifetime moment: Jamie Campbell Bower, who plays ",
    "body": "\n\tFans left the Dec. 19 performance of “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” buzzing after a once-in-a-lifetime moment: Jamie Campbell Bower, who plays Henry Creel/Vecna on the hit Netflix series, made a surprise cameo in the show’s epilogue.\n\n\t“That was one of the coolest reveals of all-time,” one fan told his partner on the escalator after the performance at Broadway’s Marquis Theater. \n\n\n\tBower appeared briefly in the final scene of the play, which centers on an adolescent Henry Creel (Louis McCartney) grappling with his dark powers after moving to Hawkins, Indiana, in 1959. In the epilogue, an older Creel is introduced to a young Eleven in the iconic Rainbow Room location of Hawkins Lab, a moment that directly links the Broadway prequel to the timeline of “Stranger Things.”\n\t\n\n\t“Getting to see Henry’s full humanity in his childhood, it’s something I took a lot of care over building the character,” Bower told Variety the night before making his Broadway debut. “So to see that, and for fans to experience that — and get to know him and feel him — is a gift.”\n\n\n\tWithin minutes, videos of Bower bowing on stage alongside “The First Shadow” cast began circulating on social media. Reactions ranged from fans asking how the play connects to the TV series to calls for a taping of the production to be streamed on Netflix. “Wow, so jealous!” one user wrote. “I would have love[d] to see that.”\n\n\tThe surprise appearance, which was only revealed to a select group of reporters under strict embargo, instantly ignited buzz, curiosity and FOMO across the “Stranger Things” fandom.\n\t\n\n\t“Bower’s cameo was billed as a one-time appearance,” Netflix said in a statement, “though its impact on fans — and the show’s mythology — will likely linger far longer.”The meticulously timed moment arrives amid a surge of momentum for “The First Shadow,” which has seen a sustained spike in ticket sales across both its Broadway and West End productions following the launch of the final season. According to production sources, sales are now at their highest levels since the show’s initial openings, with audiences booking not only for the traditionally strong holiday weeks but well into 2026 — a sign of continued fan appetite for the franchise’s expanding universe.\n\n\t“The First Shadow” expands the “Stranger Things” mythology in a way that contrasts with Marvel’s Disney+ model, which often introduces characters and plot threads in limited series that later surface in theatrical releases with minimal recap. Many of the pivotal moments that define Henry Creel’s origin in “The First Shadow,” meanwhile, will be rehashed on screen in Volume 2 of the final season in the form of Vecna’s memories. “That’s what we call our new Russia storyline,” Matt Duffer told Variety. “We’re very happy with how it integrates with the other storylines.”\n\n\tAnother benefit favoring the Broadway production is its tight focus on the small-town bubble of Hawkins residents that fans grew to love on “Stranger Things.” Every character listed in the playbill either appears in — or is directly connected to — someone on the Netflix series:\n\n\nVirginia Creel (Rosie Benton) — Henry Creel/Vecna’s mother\nDr. Martin Brenner (Alex Breaux) — a younger Dr. Brenner (Matthew Modine)\nPatty’s Mom (Ta’Rea Campbell) — mother of Patty Newby, Bob Newby’s sister\nAlice Creel (Lia Christina, Francesca Yhlen) — Henry Creel/Vecna’s younger sister\nCharles Sinclair (Robert T. Cunningham) — Lucas Sinclair’s father\nSue Anderson (Ayana Cymone) — later known as Sue Sinclair, Lucas’ mother\nWalter Henderson (Ian Dolley) — father of Dustin Henderson\nKaren Childress (Dora Dolphin) — later Karen Wheeler (Cara Buono)\nLonnie Byers (Logan Gould) — Joyce Byers’ abusive ex-husband (Ross Partridge)\nClaudia Yount (Shea Grant) — later known as Claudia Henderson, Dustin’s mother\nPrincipal Newby (Andrew Hovelson) — Bob Newby’s father\nJoyce Maldonado (Alison Jaye) — later known as Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder)\nVictor Creel (T.R. Knight) — Henry Creel/Vecna’s father\nChief Hopper/Captain Brenner (Ted Koch) — father of Jim Hopper\nTed Wheeler (Jamie Martin Mann) — Mike Wheeler’s father\nHenry Creel (Louis McCartney) — later transforms into Vecna\nBob Newby (Patrick Scott McDermott) — a younger Bob Newby (Sean Astin)\nPatty Newby (Gabrielle Nevaeh) — Bob Newby’s sister\nJames Hopper Jr. (Burke Swanson) — a younger Jim Hopper (David Harbour)\nAlan Munson (Eric Wiegand) — Eddie Munson’s father\n\n\n\n\t“Stranger Things: The First Shadow” also earned four trophies at this year’s Tony Awards, including best scenic design of a play (Miriam Buether and 59), best lighting design (Jon Clark) and best sound design (Paul Arditti). The production also received a Special Tony Award honoring its illusions and technical effects team: Jamie Harrison, Chris Fisher, Gary Beestone and Edward Pierce.\n\n\tHow long the production will play on Broadway remains unclear, but with the final episodes of “Stranger Things” releasing on Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve, there’s little indication that the momentum will die down anytime soon.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLewis Horwitz, the American film executive and producer dubbed Hollywood’s “King of Indie Film Finance,” died on Dec. 19. He was 90.\n\n\tHorwitz began his career as a bank teller in Los Angeles in the 1960s. He eventually founded the entertainment division at Beverly Hills National Bank. At the time, few banks would lend money to movie studios, and Beverly Hills National Bank’s location on Wilshire Boulevard made it highly accessible for creative clientele. \n\t\n\n\tMore versed in the entertainment industry’s inner-mechanisms than many of his banker colleagues, Horwitz convinced Beverly Hills National Bank to lend Mary Tyler Moore a loan against a deal memo, which helped her create “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” in 1970 as well as her MTM Production Company. It was the first of many star-driven deals that Horwitz would facilitate for the bank before it was bought by Wells Fargo.\n\n\n\tHorwitz then moved to the First Los Angeles Bank, where he continued to serve clients such as Roger Corman, Avi Lerner, Lloyd Kaufman, Stephen Paul, Mark Damon and Arnold Kopelson.\n\n\tIn 1980, he founded the Lewis Horwitz Organization, where he pioneered the independent film financing method of attaining production loans against foreign pre-sales. This is the method by which many independent films are still financed, and attaining foreign pre-sales is the aim of many producers attending film markets around the world. Throughout the 80s and 90s and into the new millennium, Horwitz weathered precarious economies to shepherd in the successful productions of “Bloodsport,” “Kickboxer,” “Attack of the 50ft Woman,” “Crash,” “Jack Frost,” “The Man in the Iron Mask,” “The Virgin Suicides,” “My Big Fat Greek Wedding,” “Monster” and more indie films. \n\t\n\n\tHorwitz retired in 2004, but continued to provide financial consultation on independent productions. He was notably involved in the financing of “Oculus,” “Pawn Sacrifice,” “Mojave” and “The Lost City of Z.”\n\n\tBeyond film and television, Horwitz was also a talented and devoted magician, often incorporating magic into his speeches and pitches. He was Anthony Hopkins’ magic consultant on the 1978 Richard Attenborough film “Magic,” and he served as treasurer of The Magic Castle in Hollywood, where he was inducted into The Academy of Magical Arts’ Hall of Fame.\n\n\tHorwitz was married to his wife, Hermine Fischman Horwitz, for 70 years before her passing this past June. He is survived by three children, seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild, several of whom also work in the entertainment industry. His son, Edward R. Horwitz, is the television producer behind “Unsolved Mysteries,” “The Talk” and “The Jennifer Hudson Show”; two of his grandsons are Andy Horwitz and Aaron Horwitz, both producers and now partners at their newly launched Big Swell Entertainment.\n",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tDec 22, 2025 2:20pm PT\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty/Variety\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tLooking back at the year in music, it was very much a “Golden” age. But, demon hunting aside, did it also count as golden with a small G? As we dived through our favorite music of 2025 to consider individual and collective lists of the year’s best songs, it sure felt like we were living through some of the good old days of music, whether or not that’s born out in history. With a wealth of riches from artists ranging from Lady Gaga and Sabrina Carpenter to Bad Bunny and Rosalía to Kendrick Lamar and Clipse — and from delightful newcomer Olivia Dean to the eras-meister herself, Taylor Swift — here are a few dozen of the songs that offered escapism and catharsis, in minor keys or on a major scale.   \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLily Allen, ‘Pussy Palace’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tNo one did true confessionals in 2025 like Lily Allen, with her “West End Girl” concept album, which had this bracing pop gem as its uneasy centerpiece. But If you listened to the song only for its splendid melody and arrangement, and not Allen’s comically horrified words, you could almost imagine that “Pussy Palace” was a song of rapture, rather than emotional wreckage. Of course, there is no overlooking these lyrics, in which the singer visits her husband’s secondary apartment and comes across love letters, hundreds of condoms and other fairly certain signs that the “dojo” has been rented for one very singularly horny reason. Yet, after the sin-cataloguing revelations of the verses, why is there such a weird feeling of uplift in Allen’s grand sing-along of a chorus? Maybe it’s because even when these kinds of realizations are that rough, there can still an underlying relief, if not elation, in the understanding that the truth shall set you free. Even if the truth arrives via tell-tale butt plugs. —Chris Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKendrick Lamar and SZA, ‘Luther’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tKendrick Lamar and SZA can build a bridge across hip-hop and R&B in a way that recalls the magic of the turn-of-the-millennium pop, when an R&B hook rarely felt out of place on a rap song and vice versa. Yet they’ve redefined that approach regularly over the past decade with their growing discography of collaborations, making space for each other on duets in ways that rarely feel formulaic. “Luther,” their chart-topping single from late 2024’s “GNX,” pingpongs from one artist to the other as they sing of giving someone the world they deserve. It’s lush and lovely, a true ballad for the ages in a way that only Lamar and SZA can deliver. — Steven J. Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHuntr/X, Ejae, Audrey Nuna, Rei Ami, KPop Demon Hunters Cast, ‘Golden’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tLove it, hate it, will projectile-vomit if you hear it one more time in this or the next lifetime — whichever describes your reaction, you can’t deny “Golden,” the most gigantic pop song in memory. It was practically genetically engineered to be a hit (with seven songwriters and four producers on a song that lasts 3:14) and, as on-the-street evidence from parents, elementary schools and block parties will attest, it’s a bullseye for the same spot in the brain as irresistible candy; not since “Let It Go” has a song so enraptured the under-12 set. Yet that appeal belies its deep songcraft: From the celestial reprise that begins and ends the song to its slalom-like verses leading inexorably to the tease of the “No more hiding” pre-chorus and then into the release of the sky-scraping chorus — which is really, really difficult to sing on key — it is a deceptively complex song that never stays in one place for long. Yet most of all, the indestructible optimism of the lyrics — with their emphasis on self-belief, overcoming obstacles and togetherness, and verses in Korean, no less — dovetails with the music to create a song that’s as powerful as its message. — Jem Aswad\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLady Gaga, ‘Vanish Into You’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t“Vanish Into You” has the emotional propulsion of a great ballad and the cathartic singalong potential of a great dancefloor anthem. So Lady Gaga, in a stroke of pop genius, gave us a taste of the former before committing to the latter. (Performing live, she has occasionally stripped away the disco-funk flair in favor of a slower vocal showcase.) In the verse and pre-chorus, Gaga sings of faraway lovers separated by time and space. He’s high on a hill, she’s been waiting for him, cryin’ out. Then, suddenly, she’s next to him, their faces side by side in a photograph on her bedside. A surge of dance-pop bliss snaps the song into place as Gaga asks, longingly, “Can I vanish into you?” It’s a primal sort of song about how there’s no such thing about being too close to the one you love. —Ethan Shanfeld\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSabrina Carpenter, ‘Manchild’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tCarpenter is the best comedienne, or light satirist, that we have going in pop music today. She had already evidenced an inclination to explore the battle of the sexes in a somewhat comic way in her past work, but “Manchild” found her topping herself in that regard. Some men saw her derogatory attitude toward doofuses as a kind of misandry, but boys, I’m here to tell you, after untold millennia of indeed subjecting women to “stupid(ity), slow(ness) and useless(ness)” — and, historically, that was on some of our good days — we ought to be able to take a joke. Of course, Carpenter (writing with Amy Allen and Jack Antonoff) includes herself as a target of the gags, admitting that she may be destined to fly off with these alluring Peter Pans again and again. Marry this wit to a track that recalls the synthy wonders of the Pointer Sisters or Doobie Brothers in their prime and you’ve got a recipe for an irresistibly cheeky chart-topper. —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKehlani, ‘Folded’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tThere’s something timeless about Kehlani’s “Folded,” not just because the primary theme — packing up a relationship into a box and giving it back to your ex — is so common, but because it calls back to the glistening simplicity of early 2000s R&B. “Folded” plays as though it’s directly inspired by Faith Evans’ “I Love You,” a guitar lick reverberating against rich drums and topped with voluptuous harmonies. The song already felt like a hit before it took off, so it’s no surprise that it did, eliciting remixes featuring Toni Braxton, Brandy and JoJo. The community-powered smash these days is rare, yet with “Folded” it was inevitable. — Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBad Bunny, ‘NuevaYol’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tIt shouldn’t be considered a subversive act to have to remind citizens and even leaders that Puerto Rico is an American territory, but that is where we find ourselves with the bizarre controversy over Bad Bunny being booked for the Super Bowl. As if he saw it coming, the artist put together a remarkable album, “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS,” that spoke to Puerto Rico’s independence, interdependence and pride through both its bold lyrics and fascinating musical hybrids. There was no better example of all of this coming together in rich fashion than “‘NuevaYol,” a salute to Puerto Ricans starting new and different lives in NYC in the past and present — with a nod in the music video, as you see in the image above, to the 1977 unfurling of a flag from the crest of the Statue of Liberty. Meanwhile, the sensitive combination of old-school salsa and contemporary reggaeton allowed for a spirited showcase that made room for actual callouts to Willie Colón, Washington Heights, “Un verano en Nueva York” by El Gran Combo, Frida Kahlo, Jamaican dancehall, rappers El Lápiz Conciente and Big Pun, and Juan Soto. And, oh yeah, to Donald Trump, with a vocal imitator heard on a faux radio broadcast apologizing for his attitude toward immigrants. As if! Bad Bunny’s massive popularity even among non-Spanish speakers means you didn’t have to catch all this backstory to find something thrilling in the way “‘NuevaYol” moves back and forth between traditionalism and sounds that more predictably tickle the ears of today. —WIllman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTaylor Swift, ‘Ruin the Friendship’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tHer “The Life of a Showgirl” album took on a generally happier tone than anything she’s done before, with songs like “Opalite,” which seems bound to be Swift’s next smash. But she’s not so moved on to Kelce World that she couldn’t use the record to bring up some beefs… or, in the case of “Ruin the Friendship,” to go all the way back to school days to feel rueful. Getting the call to come home to attend the funeral of a classmate she hasn’t seen in forever is occasion to reminisce and think that she should have made a move to kiss the boy in question, rather than spend the rest of her life wondering “what if.” Of course, the butterfly effect of such a brave move might have resulted in her present personal satisfactions never existing, so she can’t regret it too hard., But most of us have been there, in thinking back decades to the times we took the coward’s way out, even if virtually none of us could write an acoustic ballad about it as hauntingly gorgeous as “Ruin the Friendship.” —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOlivia Dean, ‘Nice to Each Other’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tClearly, the world is falling for Olivia Dean right now. Nothing has been able to knock her debut album, “The Art of Loving,” out of the top 10 lately — not even December’s traditional influx of charting Christmas albums. “Man I Need” has been the big hit to date, but “Nice to Each Other” goes even further in showing why we feel confident in counting Dean as a keeper among this season’s Grammy best new artist nominees. It includes the kind of writing about an “it’s complicated” romance that is so specific in its complications, you know it can’t have been made up out of whole cloth. Specifically, Dead sings about a relationship that is on the casual side, and being fine with accepting that probably tentative status, even as the partners still seem to have some issues to work out that aren’t entirely clicking. It’s not clear whether Dean is writing with a little bit of ironic detachment or is really trying to talk herself into accepting this situation. But regardless, what is most remarkable about the tune is her vocal, which sounds just a little different from anyone else’s out there right now. It’s a voice so appealing smooth that you just want to keep riding it like a gentle wave. If she has the ability to make great singing sound so effortless, you may be thinking, why does her relationship have to be such hard work? —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHayley Williams, ‘True Believer’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tParamore’s lead singer seems drawn to stirring up a little trouble now and again, whether it’s in the occasional statements she offers on current events or singing about being in a “racist singer’s bar” in the title track of her latest solo album, “Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party.” She starts off “True Believer,” one of the highlights of the 20-song release, by singing about how rampant development has led her native Nashville to go to hell — a sentiment so widely shared by the locals that it may not count as controversial. But she has more universal stuff on her mind, like what she views as hypocritical Christianity — something she frequently has something to say about, as an ex-vangelical. In the choruses, she presents her version of faith as something more sincere, that doesn’t involve exiting church through the gift shop: “I’m the one who still loves your ghost / I reanimate your bones with my belief.” She gets into the politics as well as religion of the religion, saying “the South will not rise again till it’s paid for every sin,” referring to Nashville as “Southern Gotham” (seemingly a reference to the so-called “Batman building,” seen in the image above). She’s not going to win any Miss Tennessee pageants with that kind of talk, but it makes for good, smart-mouthed pop at a time when most musicians are content to avoid the divisive elephants in the room. —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRosalía feat. Björk & Yves Tumor, ‘Berghain’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tNo one made any bigger of a big-picture album in 2025 than Rosalía, who took an interest in actually addressing God in a serious fashion rarely found outside of the genres exclusively devoted to faith. Her “Lux” album  was in no way easy to boil down, though, even with (or maybe especially with) its recurring spiritual focus. As the greatest evidence of that, take its leadoff single, “Berghain,” which lasts barely more than three minutes yet requires more unpacking than most artists’ entire careers. I’m still not entirely sure how or why, in that short length, it goes from Rosalía singing quite operatically about her troubled relationship with the divine to the climactic appearance of guest star Yves Tumor, who repeats the phrase “I’ll fuck you till you love me”… oh, and with a brief stop for a few plaintive bars of Björk in-between. I can have my theories about what the song really means, but in the meantime I can just enjoy the sheer maximalism of a composition that includes a symphony orchestra and choir blasting so loudly you’d think they were soundtracking an especially beautiful “Omen” reboot. (The music video plays up the horror angle a bit, with bleeding critters… after the first funny jump-scare of an entire orchestra appearing inside Rosalía’s kitchen.) Here’s to a Spanish artist who had every reason to play it safer and sexier, to overtake the international market, and instead kind of scaled that commercial peak by biting off more God than she could chew. —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Marías, ‘Back to Me’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tWith a range of influences that span from shoegaze to Latin music to jazz, the Marías don’t sound like anyone else — and their breakthrough single “No One Noticed” sounds like absolutely nothing that’s been on the mainstream charts in decades, if ever. The group’s most recent single, “Back to Me,” continues in that vein and expands on it: It’s brimming with longing but also a tentativeness and uncertainty — more of a wish than a promise — that is communicated in the song’s gauzey mixture of sounds, which center around the opening ominous, booming bass synthesizer that implies daunting odds. Yet from there the song builds and swirls, with an elaborate arrangement and a dreamlike middle eight, climaxing with triumphant countermelodies and a shower of celestial sounds that leave little question as to the outcome of the song’s yearning. — Aswad\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCameron Winter, ‘Love Takes Miles’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tTo include or not to include on best of ‘25 lists? That is the question when it comes to “Love Takes Miles” by Geese frontman and new indie-rock savior Cameron Winter. Yes, Winter’s debut solo record “Heavy Metal” was technically released on Dec. 6, 2024 – but most year-end lists come out before this date anyway and, spiritually, 2025 was the Year of Winter. The most commercial track from “Heavy Metal,” “Love Takes Miles” combines jazzy instrumentals reminiscent of Vince Guaraldi with a simple yet profound message beyond his 23 years: “Love takes miles / Love takes years.” Despite the debate, it’s an earworm that we’ll have trouble shaking even in 2026. — Ellise Shafer\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTate McRae, ‘2 Hands’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tAdmittedly, yes, this was released as a single in November 2024, but it’s still being included since its parent album, “So Close to What,” arrived this past February. Tate McRae has been edging towards Main Pop Girl since she shrugged off the sad girl vibes of her first album and dove directly into millennium-era pop, evoking Nelly Furtado and Timbaland on her breakthrough singles “Greedy” and “Exes.” And while much of “So Close to What” pulls from the same palette (“Sports Car” and “It’s OK, I’m OK” get honorable mention here), “2 Hands” embodies pop perfection — or, at least, is so close to it. With verses that speed across pattering drums, the track hits its stride on its undeniable chorus, a siren blaring in the background to create a sense of tension as her vocals stretch towards the skies. Much criticism has been lobbed at McCrae for lacking personality in her songs, yet it’s of little consequence when a banger like this sticks the landing so well. — Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTyler, the Creator, ‘Sugar on My Tongue’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tTyler’s “Don’t Tap the Glass” is ostensibly a dance-music album, but it’s really just vintage Tyler with bouncier beats. “Sugar on My Tongue” is the set’s standout track and also a showcase for Tyler as a producer, with an irresistible Pharrell-esque elastic beat, plinking synth lines and an increasingly busy arrangement that morphs as the song progresses, even incorporating some synthesizer tones we last heard from the Human League — not to mention (conceptual link) what sounds like someone tapping on glass. — Aswad\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tChappell Roan, ‘The Giver’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tPicking between Chappell Roan’s “The Subway” and “The Giver” is like playing favorites, and yet the latter tipped the scales this year in terms of its more genre-specific appeal. Roan is a powerhouse vocalist, gifted in her ability to belt with raw emotion and dial it back to a sensitive murmur, and on “The Giver,” she completely recontextualizes it for a hoe-down throwdown romp into country. Not many pop artists can pull off a country pivot so convincingly, yet Roan marches right down to the rodeo and plants her flag promptly. And in classic Roan fashion, she infuses it with personal flair — she calls it “cuntry,” and the song could very well be about how she navigates relationships (particularly in the bedroom) — making a compelling argument for a viable backup gig if this whole pop thing doesn’t work out. — Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLady Wray, ‘My Best Step’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tThe perfect introductory track for her third album “Cover Girl,” “My Best Step” has all the hallmarks of what makes the record such an epiphany for Lady Wray. Her aching vocals over tinkering piano keys recall the rawness of Aretha Franklin’s earlier work as she celebrates the joy of romance in the face of the inevitable hardship it brings. Throwback soul can be gimmicky when it pushes too many of the right buttons — the recent critical reappraisal of Silk Sonic contended with this school of thought — yet Wray is far too seasoned and authentic to code as pastiche. — Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLucy Dacus, ‘Best Guess’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tReturning to her solo career after a stint with Boygenius, Dacus seemed to have a whole different attitude — an honestly romantic one that found its full culmination in this beautiful ballad. Befitting someone who doesn’t necessarily jump into passion easily, it expresses the cautiousness of a woman who knows how fragile and temporal relationships can be, but has decided to lay all her chips on this one anyway, because — based on a calculated assessment of evidence and odds — “you are my best guess” for a salvation that might actually last. Yes, there’s a tentativeness to that sentiment, but describing that doesn’t really get at just how moving and heartwarming the song is, as Dacus takes that gorgeous voice and uses it not for the deadpan tone she’s sometimes had in the past but something deeply and openly delirious. It might be the best and/or innately truest love song of 2025. —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tClipse feat. John Legend and Voices of Fire, ‘The Birds Don’t Sing’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tWith age comes wisdom, as does the looming threat of our own mortality and how we cope with it. Clipse’s Pusha T and Malice haven’t always been particularly emotional in their raps, but they tap into something deep and real on “Let God Sort Em Out” opener “The Birds Don’t Sing,” a mournful meditation on what it was like to lose both of their parents just a few months apart. That pain is communicated in a way that only Clipse can: with precision amid distress, and they reflect on that sorrow with a vulnerability we’ve yet to see from the brothers Thornton. Their bars linger with you long after the song fades — the final line on Malice’s verse, “‘I love my two sons’ was the code to your phone, now you’re home,” ricochets like a shot to the heart. — Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAddison Rae, ‘Fame Is a Gun’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tThe Addison Rae experiment has become impossible to deny following the release of her debut album “Addison,” a tightly written and sharply produced collection of pop songs that confronts the nature of celebrity while unabashedly embracing it. What’s given Rae’s discography so much weight hasn’t just been the conversation around it — Stan Twitter sure had its fair share of hyperbole this year — but rather Rae’s framing of the concept of celebrity in the TikTok age. “Tell me who I am, do I provoke you with my tone of innocence?” she asks at the song’s onset, a synth chirping beside her like a sound effect from “Super Mario.” Is Rae here to entertain, she suggests, or does fame’s artificiality merely entertain her? “Fame Is a Gun” concludes that both can be true: We’ve got a front row seat, and she certainly has the glamorous life. — Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCharlie Puth, ‘Changes’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tTaylor Swift was right when she said that Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist, because the breadth of his musical expertise and ability to put that knowledge into action continues to go unmatched in contemporary pop. After leaning a bit on overly polished pop on 2022’s “Charlie,” Puth went into full dad mode with the Phil Collins-indebted “Changes,” the first single off his upcoming fourth album “Whatever’s Clever.” “Changes” exhumes the ’80s touchstones of Peter Gabriel and Bruce Hornsby and repackages them for 2025 tastes, making for a propulsive, exuberant tune about accepting and acknowledging the sometimes uncomfortable shifts that come with the end of a relationship. But boy, when that gospel choir kicks in during the last chorus? Few artists can pull that off so naturally, and of course Puth is up for the task. — Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWet Leg, ‘Davina McCall’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tWet Leg has an image for songs that are either arch (the debut album’s “Chaise Longue”) or aggressive (the latest release’s “Catch These Fists”). But if lead singer Rhian Teasdale can devote herself on the excellent “Moisturizer” album to defensively singing “Mangetout” — as in, “man, get out” — she can also disarm herself and invite a new partner to come inside in an honestly love-besotted rock song like this one. Of course, she and the band have to come at it from an odd angle, which is naming this song of devotion for a TV presenter in London, singing, “I’ll be your Davina… never gonna let you go.” What exactly that connotes, us Yanks can only guess, but it sure sounds flattering. And it sure is sweet to have a few love songs that rock as hard as the handful on their sophomore effort. —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDijon, ‘Yamaha’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tIn many ways, Dijon’s impressive sophomore album “Baby” rejects songwriting conventions while constantly reminding you that, if he wanted to, the R&B singer-producer could make a helluva pop song. Hooks are buried under glitchy drum samples, and catchy melodies are tossed aside in sparse sonic landscapes. So when, midway through the album, Dijon belts out over steady drums and sparkling ‘80s synths in “Yamaha,” it sounds like soaring: “Baby, I’m in love with this particular emotion.” It’s a perfect example of Dijon’s ability to mix studio sorcery with the timeless power of a good chorus. —Shanfeld\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTurnstile, ‘Sole’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tIn 2025, the Baltimore hardcore quintet continued introducing new sounds in their work, and their audience grew alongside them. While other songs from their most recent album, “Never Enough,” had more buzz, “Sole” is a hard-charging blend of the band’s classic sound with a layer of their newly-found dreampop sensibilities. With a syncopated central riff that shows off drummer Daniel Fang’s dexterity, a near-wordless chorus melody from singer Brendan Yates that evokes a football hooligan chant, a spacey bridge and a walloping outro breakdown, headbanging is unavoidable. — William Earl\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLorde, ‘What Was That’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tWhere were you when Lorde revealed the first single from her long-awaited fourth album to a crowd of screaming fans in Washington Square Park? Even if you didn’t experience it in person, if you pay attention to pop, it was one of the most defining music moments of the year. I happened to be in New York City at the time, and the song came to define my trip — it was blasted every morning, with its hammering synths and electrifying chorus (“MDMA in the back garden, blow our pupils up / We kissed for hours straight, well, baby, what was that?”) setting the tone for the day. At night, my friends and I played it in the streets, walking from bar to bar, shouting “This is the best cigarette of my life” as if we’d written the lyrics ourselves. It marked a return to form for Lorde after the acoustic, down-to-earth “Solar Power,” and — from a singular artist of our generation — served as a reminder that growing up doesn’t have to be so scary. — Shafer\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBrandi Carlile, ‘Long Goodbye’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tCarlisle has been known to do an epic album-closer before (see “Party of One” from her breakthrough “By the Way, I Forgive You”). She really goes all-out with the conclusion to her “Returning to Myself” album, offering bits and pieces of her own easily identifiable history, as well as passing anecdotes about other people’s fates, on her way to offering a lovely lesson in how fleeting life is and how much we need to seize love by the reins while we have them to grasp. The first verse recounts her very first plane trip outside of the Seattle area to nearby Idaho, having an epiphany as she eyes the ancient flood plains in Washington beneath her; the second tells the tale of people dying in suicide or accidents, and how “we’re all just a broken heart away from making a promise that we’re forced to keep.” In the final stretch, she invokes the bonds of her own marriage and children, even as she’s aware — in the spine-tingling coda — that all the interactions are part of a “long goodbye.” A small masterpiece of macro and micro philosophizing, it’s heartwarming and sad, and there are jokes embedded, too; what more could you want out of a song? —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDoja Cat, ‘Stranger’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tDoja Cat can often get in her own way when it comes to giving into her more pop predilections, which can be frustrating for those of us who didn’t see her breakthrough records as “cash grabs” (her words!). On “Vie,” an album that strikes a healthy medium between slick pop and sharp rap, she lands in a space where she sounds the most like herself, particularly on “Stranger,” an absolutely seamless front-to-end bop. Like much of “Vie,” “Stranger” is an ’80s-kissed ode to finding someone who matches your freak. There’s a warmth to the tune as she sings of striking connection with another misfit, chipped tooth with a broken nose and all. — Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJustin Bieber, ‘Go Baby’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tIf there’s one line from the “Swag” universe that’s going to stick to your brain, it’s “That’s my baby, she’s iconic / iPhone case, lip gloss on it.” It’s a mundane detail that emphasizes just how high a pedestal he places his wife Hailey, the subject of much of his pair of “Swag” albums, and how easily impressed he is with her accessorizing. Yet “Go Baby,” perhaps the best song on “Swag” for its yearning chorus and hypnotic melody lines, is less about valorizing his wife than it is about protecting her, encouraging her to turn her face into his shoulder to shield herself from the world’s woes. “You better believe I can hold all the weight that you feel inside” is romance at its purest, and R&Bieber sells it. — Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHaim, ‘Relationships’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tIt’s a universal experience to fall into the same patterns across romantic trysts, and relationship burnout is a real thing. That’s what the Haim sisters bemoan on the plainly titled “Relationships,” a song that’s stitched together by old school breakbeats, schoolyard chants and cherry-sweet piano stabs. Haim zigzags between sound and style, yet it’s here where the trio thrives in making sense of musical chaos, particularly when it’s matched with ruminations on the equally chaotic nature of romance. Danielle, Este and Alana have become creatures of reinvention (or, perhaps more accurately, refinement) over the years, and “Relationships” is Haim at their best. — Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMegan Moroney, ‘6 Months Later’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tMoroney, one of country’s hottest rising stars, allows herself a moment of wondering whether she made the right move in breaking up with a no-account guy. But as the sprightly music suggests, it’s really just a moment, because she knows that he will be dialing her up for a reconciliation months down the road, if she needs that as a safety net. Which, apparently, she does not. This uptempo song about how “what doesn’t kill you calls you six months later” is another fine example of how Moroney and her co-writers continue to be able to take the seemingly exhausted subject of breakups and wring new life and wit out of it. It’s a highly promising teaser for her third album, due in early ’26. —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJai’Len Josey, ‘New Girl’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tClocking in at just over two minutes, Jai’Len Josey’s “New Girl” instantly thrust open the doors of a more-than-promising new era for the former Broadway star. Now signed to Def Jam after releasing a few EPs, Josey sidles up to a U.K. garage beat on “New Girl” with R&B flair, making for unexpected yet consistently satiating musical turns. Synths cartwheel behind her as she welcomes come-ons from a suitor — “Closed mouths don’t get fed ’round here,” she sings — as the track whips and careens towards a chorus where the instrumentation pulls almost entirely back, leaving her harmonies exposed. It’s one of the most unexpected yet alluring songs this year, just a taste of what Josey has to offer on her upcoming debut album, “Serial Romantic.” — Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPinkPantheress, ‘Stateside’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tA cross-Atlantic fling has never seemed so fun in PinkPantheress’ ode to American boys, “Stateside.” Her unbothered facade is cracked by a new love interest abroad, as she plots in that cool British monotone: “It sounds insane, right? / I’ll take the same flight / Wait at your bedside / I’ll land right next to you.” With a producing assist from the Dare, the song is a collage of wobbly bass lines, club drums and Y2K guitar stylings. But the most fun part is a play on the Estelle and Kanye West classic, as Pink floats cheekily: “You could be my American — ha, ha — boy.” —Shanfeld\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSombr, ’12 to 12′\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tTwenty-year-old wunderkind Shane Boose rode in on bedroom pop but began branching into something else with his first major hit, “Back to Friends.” But on “12 to 12” he (almost literally) kicks the door down with a swaggering pop song that packs all of the punch it promises. The song has all the trademarks of his sound — the soaring chorus, the intricate instrumental hooks — but this time with a strutting, powerful beat and, most of all, attitude. — Aswad\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGeese, ‘Getting Killed’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tFrom what has been hailed by critics as the year’s strongest rock album, one could pluck basically any song for this list. Many have spotlighted “Taxes,” the warbly, jangly first single that may or may not be a protest song, or the twinkly “Au Pays du Cocaine,” about desperately trying to hold onto a fleeting relationship. But the most striking and under-discussed entry on “Getting Killed” is the title track. Over a heavy-blues guitar riff, chaotic drums and what sounds like tribal chanting, Cameron Winter wails and screams about how he can’t even hear himself talk or taste his own tears. None of it should work, and yet it does, as the song morphs between a soft and skittering croon and a relentless force of sound. “I am taking off my pants / I’m getting out of this gumball machine,” Winter sings, convincingly. In an album full of songs about breaking free, no other song so perfectly describes the feeling of rejecting the oppression of normality. —Shanfeld\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJason Isbell, ‘Crimson and Clay’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tThis song about the ups and downs of hailing from a place as “red” as Alabama takes its title from all the ways that the area earns that shade, not all of which have to do with the electoral map, although there’s that, too. “Red clay under my nails, deep crimson on my skin,” sings the troubadour who in no way will be mistaken for a redneck, even though he grew up around a lot of them. Having long since moved to a metropolis where inclusiveness is taken for granted, Isbell still has a deep sympathy and affection for those like him who may not fit in to their tiny burgs: “Guess the small town didn’t suit me after all / There’s still so many lonely kids surrounded by the rest of y’all / And I can’t seem to keep myself away / So I head back to the crimson and the clay.” Like the rest of his “Foxes in the Snow” album, it benefits from being given the intimacy of the solo-acoustic treatment; we feel like we can almost hear the crimson coursing through his veins. —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRose Gray, ‘Party People’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tRose Gray’s “Party People” is the main character theme song blaring in your brain as you step into the club. Almost like a spiritual sonic cousin to Annie’s “Heartbeat,” the Sega Bodega-produced single is a song of surrender, consumed by the idea of giving in to the quick pace of city life and flash of strobe lights across a dark room. But even as an admitted party person, Gray sings as an enchantress, finding focus in a world of distraction, pulled by the yarn of romance towards a longtime lover. “In the city of strangers, you’re the only one that I want / And it feels like it’s the first time,” she sings, seductive and confessional all at once. — Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSasha Keable, ‘Act Right’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tSasha Keable spent 2025 planting the seeds for what’s sure to be a bountiful new year, particularly on the back of her one-off singles (her cover of Jill Scott’s “Gettin’ in the Way” was striking) and latest EP “Act Right.” That project brought her mellifluous alto to new R&B corners, a much more mature and revealing look into the inner workings of the heart. The title track is as much a gold standard for Keable as any on the EP, yet it stands out for its confrontational tone underwritten by pain and frustration. “If you loved me, you would never hurt me / That’s to put it simply, whether we were lovers or just friends,” she sings, her vocal runs cascading like a waterfall. Keable is conversational to a point that you can feel her singing directly to you — a gift as valuable as her capacity to translate her emotions into song. — Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tElla Langley, ‘Choosin’ Texas’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tLangley, a big winner at the CMAs and ACMs as a freshman artist, has thankfully stretched out far beyond being a one-hit-wonder with her “You Look Like You Love Me” breakout last year. She got a pretty big co-sign on this one from no less a co-writer and backup singer than Miranda Lambert (Luke Dick and Joybeth Taylor also got in on the writers’ room). There is a long history of country classics about people who are either headed into or out of the Lone Star state — there should be a royalties checkpoint at the eastern and western borders — and the lyrics to this one actually reference another transitory tune: “He always loved ‘Amarillo By Morning’,” she tells herself, rationalizing why she knows her beau is going to fall for, and and follow, a Texas-based rival. But with the rich vocal tone Langley brings to the song, it’s hard to imagine a mere two-step champion luring her guy away. —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKesha, ‘Love Forever’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tKesha coronated the latest phase of her career — full independence, a victory after the very public conflicts she endured both personally and professionally — with “Joyride,” one of the most bizarre yet provocative tunes to impact last year. She followed with the compulsively listenable album “Period,” released on July 4 (naturally) this year, which featured the under-heralded “Love Forever” that asks the question: What would Kesha sound like if she made a Daft Punk song? On “Love Forever,” French touch suits Kesha well, playing like a track that could have comfortably soundtracked an H&M dressing room in the early 2000s (for an even French touchier version, try DJ David Michael’s remix). Kesha has been known to embrace her inner chameleon, and this color looks very good on her. — Horowitz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWednesday, ‘Wound Up Here (By Holdin On)’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tOn Wednesday’s latest album “Bleeds,” Karly Hartzman sings about false teeth, Four Lokos and fruit flies as if from a bingo card of her daily observations in North Carolina. The most fun-to-sing  item arrives in “Wound Up Here (By Holdin On),” in which Hartzman wails, in tongue-twisting fashion, “You saw a pitbull puppy pissin’ off a balcony.” Borrowing a refrain borrowed from Evan Gray’s book of poetry (“I wound up here by holdin’ on”), Hartzman relays a friend’s story about pulling a dead body out from a creek. Guitars and pedal steel spiral upwards until Hartzman is swept away by the sound, screaming into siren-like distortion. The song reaches its gloriously noisy climax when Hartzman’s voice cracks and wavers — barely holding on. —Shanfeld\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAudrey Hobert, ‘Sue Me’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tAfter co-writing many of the songs on childhood friend Gracie Abrams’ blockbuster album “The Secret of Us,” Hobert stepped out with her strong debut record, “Who’s the Clown?” Over a big, bright synth, Hobert quickly tosses off a waterfall of lyrics about hooking up with an ex and not feeling guilty. The topic, the delivery, her witty attention to detail (“Just me or does he look amazing / When he’s all in his Amazon Basics?”) and quirky songwriting feels fresh, and is a fitting introduction to her unique style. — Earl\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tElton John and Brandi Carlile, ‘Little Richard’s Bible’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tOn the collaborative John/Carlile album from early this year, Elton took the lead on a track paying eloquent homage to one of the legendary piano-pounding rockers who preceded him as the artform was born. The lyric by Bernie Taupin is about Little Richard being torn between believing he had a call to the ministry and his rather more obvious call to be his flamboyant self as a rock ‘n’ roll pioneer. Implicitly tied in to that is Richard being gay and closeted — and it’s interesting that John and Carlile start their joint album with two tribute songs devoted to gay musicians who came before them, the other one being a salute to Laura Nyro. In any case, examining the curious case of Little Richard and his angels and demons is an excuse for Elton to do one of the most flat-out rockers he’s written and performed in a very long time, as seen in the “SNL” clip included above. His roadhouse piano solos are still a thing of wonder; thank you, Sir Elton, for not being similarly tempted by the ministry. —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRomy Mars, ‘A-Lister’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tThe teenage daughter of Sofia Coppola and Phoenix frontman Thomas Mars delivered this sly ode to love and fame that mixes the keen observations of her mother and the indelible hooks of her father. “I met an actor last night, he called me a star / Said he hates the spotlight, I hate his big red car” is the wry opening of one of the year’s most hypnotic choruses, a sweet and sour ode to Hollywood dreams. — Earl\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBlondshell, ‘T&A’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tSabrina Teitelbaum’s second full-length album as Blondshell, “If You Asked for a Picture,” proves that she’s one of the best singer-songwriters in indie-rock right now. No song better exemplifies this than “T&A,” a friends-to-lovers-to-strangers anthem full of disdain for the actions of a man and self-loathing in equal measure. Amid fuzzy guitars and a driving drumline, the reason for the title is revealed — “I asked him why he had these feelings / He said your tits and ass don’t really hurt” — just ahead of an explosive chorus, with Teitelbaum asking in a controlled wail: “Letting him in / Why don’t the good ones love me?” It’s punchy and relatable, the kind of song you want to scream in a crowd full of other women scorned. — Shafer\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAmanda Shires, ‘Piece of Mind’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tOn her riveting “Nobody’s Girl” album, recently divorced singer-songwriter Shires wrestles with plenty of unresolved questions — like whether she can count herself reasonably healed or is still in the thick of more pain than she realizes… and whether to spill the details of what went down in the split or demurely move on. In “Piece of Mind,” she’s embracing the anger and the tea-spilling, knowing she’s got a full album to also ensure we know she’s moving closer to whatever closure will come. For a few fiery minutes, at least, she’s taking no prisoners… and ending each chorus with the line “wherever you are tonight,” to let listeners know that she is still standing her ground, now as a newly liberated true solo artist. It’s rough stuff, but Shires was too  candid before any of this stuff publicly went down to suddenly go shy on us now. It’s the very model of how to balance vulnerability and fierceness in the confessional. —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tArmand Hammer and the Alchemist, ‘Scandinavia’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t“Mercy” is the second collaborative record between NYC rap duo Armand Hammer and legendary producer the Alchemist, and “Scandinavia” has the trio operating on all cylinders. Over a minimalist, sinister beat, Billy Woods and Elucid trade verses while expertly modulating flows to deliver complex storytelling and poetry (“Might sell you a bridge, but it’s no regrets when you examine the metalwork / Just say he’s best, the arch like a lover’s neck”). A standout track in a year of strong underground hip-hop. — Earl\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tI’m With Her, ‘Ancient Light’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tMembers Sarah Jarosz, Aoife O’Donavan and Sara Watkins, all heroines of roots music, have worked on very worthy solo projects since they last convened for a supergroup album as the collective I’m With Her back in 2018. But their reconvening as a trio did not come a moment too soon, for those of us who look to vocal harmony as some kind of substitute for the kind we’re missing in the outside world. The opening song on their first album back after the break, “Ancient Light,” isn’t just about being in the company of one another again. It’s about basking in the kind of shared history that goes back before their births, and taking joy in communing with figurative (probably?) spirits of the past, whether you take that to mean gatherings of women or of musicians or both. “Thinkin’ of who camе before / I hear them knock at the door / They’ve been a long time comin’ / Mmm, when I let ’em in / I feel their breath on my skin.” If you’re a ghost, you should be so lucky as to get to haunt these three when they’re making magic. Barack Obama just had this at the top of his 2025 songs list, and he’s got great taste. —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThis Is Lorelei, ‘Dancing in the Club (MJ Lenderman Version)’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tIndie Rock Dudes had a great 2025, and what’s better than a collab between two of the genre’s reigning champions? On this track from the deluxe edition of This Is Lorelei’s stellar 2024 record “Box for Buddy, Box for Star,” dad-rock torchbearer Lenderman strips down the original song’s hyperpop disposition in a way that gives it a brand-new meaning. Played acoustically, “Dancing in the Club”’s lyricism stands out, anchored by a subtle yet brilliant metaphor: “And I know it’s only cards / But love I feel your heart in spades / While you were dancing in the club / I gave my diamonds all away.” Lenderman’s crackly voice and penchant for yearning give those words the quietly heartbreaking delivery they deserve. — Shafer\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTyler Childers, ‘Bitin’ List’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tAlt-country superstar Tyler Childers is a man of many unusual extremes. For instance, his latest album, like some of his sold-out concerts, includes elements of a Hare Krishna chant and other Indian influences, which would seem to be a long way from his Appalachian origins. But he hasn’t gone total peacenik on us, at least not when it comes to “Bitin’ List,” which became a viral hit off the “Snipe Hunter” record. “I just don’t like you,” he announces in the song, “and if there ever come a time I got rabies, you’re high on my bitin’ list.” It’s meant playfully, naturally, but it would not have become one of the year’s defining Americana songs if there weren’t a lot of folks out there able to identify someone they’d like to take down with them if they contracted a communicable disease. So sing or growl along, and then atone with 20 Hare Krishnas. —WIllman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJessie Murph, ‘Blue Strips’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tMuch has been made of the fusion of hip-hop and country in recent years, from Nelly’s groundbreaking collaborations to the fact that many of the biggest singers to arise from Nashville in the past decade, from Morgan Wallen to Jelly Roll, started as would-be rappers. But more than most, 20-year-old Jessie Murph has hip-hop in her DNA — she can be singing a ballad and her phrasing still has rap rhythms in it — and nowhere is that more obvious than on “Blue Strips.” The song has a wildly intuitive chorus where the alliteration leads the melody — “Boy I ain’t mad, boy I ain’t mad, boy I ain’t mad at you / I had to get back at you / Got a new man, got a new damn mansion in Malibu” — and unexpectedly slots perfectly with the slinking trap beat. But that chorus, which opens the song, grabs your attention like a lap-dancer pushing their client into a chair. — Aswad\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLucius, ‘Gold Rush’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tNot-quite-twin singers Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig blend their voices nearly full-time as the frontwomen of Lucius, and hearing the blood-leavel harmony they continually pull off is as sweet a treat as any you can regularly count on in modern music. It’s so easy to focus on the miracle of their preternaturally paired singing that it can be easy to forget that Lucius is a great band, too, and not just a chosen-sister act. You won’t lose sight of that, though, listening to what for them is an unusually gnarly mid-tempo rocker with a wonderfully cutting guitar lick. The “rush” they describe may be down to the singers’ partners or to their respective infants, but you believe them when they swear “I’ll never leave, I’ll never leave,” since Laessig and Wolfe have already proven so steadfast at not leaving each other’s sides, even for a few notes. —WIllman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRatboys, ‘What’s Right’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tRatboys are experts in making the simplest rock songs sound vast and atmospheric. The latest single from the Chicago alt-country four-piece warms its engine on a three-chord runway, then a four-on-the-floor drumbeat kicks it into gear. Listening to “What’s Right” feels like speeding down an open highway, one where the telephone lines “go forever, they go forever.” Julia Steiner sings of a relationship on the fritz, reassuring in the chorus: “You know what’s right / You know what’s right this time.” The mystery is whether she’s talking to her partner or herself. —Shanfeld\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHot Mulligan, ‘Monica Lewinskibidi’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tThe emo-punkers returned in 2025 with their bold fourth album, “The Sound a Body Makes When It’s Still,” and this lament about a loved one dying while you’re a world away on tour is a highlight. Per usual, the band offsets deep emotions with an outrageously silly song title, and lead singer Tades Sanville pushes his vocal cords to the brink with plainspoken lyrics that go straight to the gut: “It’s 5 AM in Tokyo, and half a world away / I’m sitting in a parking lot, you’re lying in your grave.” The rest of the band nails a busy, tuneful backdrop, with Brandon Blakeley’s drums adding a palpable tone. It’s a collision of beauty and grief, gorgeous chords and screaming, and the result is unforgettable. — Earl\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSara Bareilles feat. Brandi Carlile, ‘Salt Then Sour Then Sweet’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tIf you’ve seen the Apple+ documentary “Come See Me in the Good Light” — and everyone should — you already know the unusual providence of this song. It started as Bareilles’ way of incorporating some poetry from the late Andrea Gibson into a song that would be part of the ending of the doc about her, and then Bareilles sweetened the deal by asking Carlile to write a verse and sing co-lead and harmony. What they came up with was a love song, for Gibson and her partner Megan Falley, spearheaded by the singer-songwriter who once claimed she was’t going to write anything of the sort. Both the documentary and the song are shortlisted in their respective Oscar categories, quite deservedly, with the first historic recorded collab between Bareilles and Brandi, baked in a beautiful pie.—Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMarina, ‘C—issimo’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tGreek-Welsh singer Marina Diamantis — previously known as Marina and the Diamonds and now just Marina — opened a new chapter in her 15-year career with this arch and urbane song and its parent album, which combines deliciously pulsating electronic rhythms with hilarious and risque lyrics that contrast startlingly with her intentionally mannered singing style, which can vault suddenly into a sky-scraping soprano. This track combines a world of musical influences — ABBA, Queen, Madonna, a string quartet, bubbling electronic rhythm and celestial synthesizers — with a taboo title, F-bombs and comically droll lyrics like “We go to Lake Como / And take over a château / Do people still say YOLO?” — Aswad\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRobbie Fulks, ‘Ocean City’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tOne of the great modern folk, Americana or alt-country singer-songwriters (however you want to look at it), Fulks set his frequent trademark humor aside for a beautifully earnest memory song about experiencing childhood bliss on family vacations growing up in the ’70s. Now, quite a long time later, he writes about reexperiencing those happy trips in unsettling dreams, whether neither he nor the family ghosts he sits in with quite understand why they’re such different ages now. The bittersweet split between cheerful reminiscing and sadness about old times being gone is born out by a song that jumps from minor to major chords to exquisite and haunting effect. You can’t listen to it and not know you’re in the presence of one of acoustic-oriented music’s modern mastes. —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tShelly, ‘Cross Your Mind’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tClairo’s side project with her Syracuse University classmates, the band Shelly — also consisting of Claud, Josh Mehling and Noa Frances Getzug — reappeared for the first time in five years in July with a two-track EP. “Cross Your Mind,” with its lo-fi production and jangly guitars, harkens back to Clairo’s early EPs. Its nostalgic sound and lyrics instill a longing for suburban teenage summers: Biking around the neighborhood, having no plans, trying to make eye contact with your crush at the pool. “Hard to recreate / The way I felt when I was 17 / I’ll keep trying if it kills me, baby,” Clairo croons in a soft and sweet tone. — Shafer\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBar Italia, ‘Cowbella’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tLondon post-rock trio Bar Italia have long been bubbling in the underground, and this year’s release “Some Like It Hot” proved to be their most commercial project yet. Though critics were divided on the band’s cleaner, more-produced sound, “Cowbella” — the first single released from the album — is undeniable. The call-and-response singing the band has become well-known for is in top form here, with Nina Cristante’s sharp and seductive ad-libs layering over Sam Fenton’s chorus and Jezmi Tarik Fehmi adding his angry growl in the bridge. At nearly four-and-a-half minutes, it’s one of the longest songs Bar Italia has ever released, but it proves that they have staying power, allowing time for a piercing guitar solo to cut through the crunchy wall-of-noise, and for an outro worthy of getting lost in until the track ends with a thud. — Shafer\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOklou feat. Bladee, ‘Take Me By the Hand’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tFrench experimental artist Oklou broke through in a big way this year with her first studio album, “Choke Enough,” and single “Take Me by the Hand” sees her team up with Swedish rapper Bladee for a track that feels like floating. A steady twinkling synth takes us seamlessly through several beat switches, with Oklou’s tranquil voice contrasted by Bladee’s Auto-Tuned delivery. As the song continues, all of the elements layer and combine, leading to a kind of electronic ecstasy that just scratches the brain. — Shafer\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFlock of Dimes, ‘Long After Midnight’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tCo-dependency reaches its poignant extreme in “Long After Midnight,” a song about being a perennial sucker in the service of a partner or loved one who is destined to just be a time-suck and money-suck for the rest of their lives. Perhaps you know someone in either of the situations described by Wye Oak singer-guitarist Jenn Wasner, who has Flock of Dimes as her recurring solo project. The music video puts a more quietly humorous spin on it, as friends or movers pack up Wasner’s entire department as she sings to her unseen benefactor: “All the money I gave to you / I know I will never get it back / Don’t be sad and don’t be sorry…. / Please take the keys to my car.” It’s almost to the point of being played for laughs, but Wasner is describing an all-too-serious and real one-way dynamic that may bring up some painful recognition in her audience. —Willman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOasis, ‘Slide Away (Live From Cardiff)’\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tIt’s true, “Slide Away” came out more than 30 years ago. But the fan-favorite Oasis anthem took on a different meaning in 2025, when the Gallagher brothers laid down their arms and reunited, embarking on the year’s most triumphant tour. On “Slide Away,” a highlight of the greatest-hits setlist, Liam snarls and Noel shreds. It’s the best either of them have sounded in decades. In footage from an infamous gig one month before Oasis broke up in 2009, Liam is seen sitting down and sulking as Noel takes over his vocal part: “I don’t know / I don’t care / All I know is you can take me there.” And sixteen years later, at stadiums across the world, the brothers finally sang it together. —Shanfeld\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhere to Buy Tickets to Florence + the Machine’s ‘Everybody Scream’ Tour\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGold and Silver Prices Have Reached Record Highs Amid Geopolitical Turmoil\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChiefs Land Record $1.8B in Public Money to Cross Kansas State Line\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEverything to Get (for Less) at Nordstrom’s Half Yearly Sale: From Gift-Worthy Pajama Sets to Designer Faux Fur Coats\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has unveiled “Tygo,” an action thriller that will see Blackpink member Lalisa “Lisa” Manobal’s star alongside Korean action powerhouse Don Lee and “Squid Game” actor Lee Jin-uk.\n\n\tThe project is an expansion of Netflix’s “Extraction” franchise, bringing Korean filmmaking prowess to the streamer’s most successful action property. Big Punch Pictures, AGBO and TGIM are producing, with Nova Film Inc and B&C Group serving as co-producers.\n\t\n\n\tThe film is based on an original graphic novel created by Anthony and Joe Russo with Ande Parks. The producing team includes Don Lee for Big Punch Pictures; Anthony and Joe Russo, Angela Russo-Otstot, Michael Disco, and Albert J. Kim for AGBO; Won-ki Choi for Nova Film; and Chris S. Lee for B&C Group.\n\n\n\t“Tygo” follows Tygo (Don Lee), a former child soldier turned mercenary who launches a revenge mission through Korea’s criminal underworld after an operation goes awry. The film will be written by Cha Woo-jin and directed by Lee Sang-yong, who previously helmed “The Roundup” and “The Roundup: No Way Out.”\n\n\tLisa, who starred in “The White Lotus” Season 3, said: “I’m so honored to be a part of this project and grateful for the opportunity to work alongside such incredible actors. Being in an action movie has always been a dream of mine, so for my film debut to be such an exciting project feels very special.”\n\n\tDon Lee’s credits include “The Roundup” franchise and Marvel’s “Eternals.” “I’m thrilled that this project, which I’ve been developing for years with AGBO, is finally moving into production,” Lee said. “’Tygo’ brings a distinctly Korean identity into the global ‘Extraction’ universe. We can’t wait to unleash its explosive energy on audiences worldwide.”\n\t\n\n\tLee Jin-uk added: “As a fan of the ‘Extraction’ franchise, it’s a great honor for me to join this universe. I’m especially excited and grateful to be working with Don, whom I’ve always admired, and with Lisa as well.”\n\n\tAngela Russo-Otstot, producer and chief creative officer of AGBO, said: “We’re thrilled to explore the world of ‘Extraction’ through a South Korean lens, teaming up with legendary action star Don Lee and visionary director Lee Sang-yong, whose dynamic choreography exemplifies the world-class craft of Korean cinema. Together, we proudly welcome Lisa, a truly multitalented global phenomenon, and Lee Jin-uk, one of Korea’s most charismatic and versatile actors, to lead our cast alongside Don.”\n\n\tThe “Extraction” franchise has proven remarkably successful for Netflix, with 90 million households watching the first film within its initial four weeks. The second installment remained at No. 1 on Netflix’s Global Top 10 Movies list for seven weeks, accumulating over 123 million views.\n",

    "description": "\n\tA consortium of top industry players have sent an open letter full of alarm to Congress, describing a potential economic and institutional meltdown ",
    "body": "\n\tA consortium of top industry players have sent an open letter full of alarm to Congress, describing a potential economic and institutional meltdown in Hollywood if Netflix succeeds in its effort to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\n\tThe letter was sent via email to members of Congress from both parties on Thursday from an anonymous collective identifying themselves only as “concerned feature film producers.” The group explained it was leaving the letter unsigned “not out of cowardice” but fear of retaliation given Netflix’s considerable market power as a buyer and distributor. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment. \n\t\n\n\tOne well-placed source confirmed to Variety that the group includes a number of prominent filmmakers.\n\n\n\tThe communication outlines three areas of great concern, including that Netflix could stand to “destroy” the theatrical film marketplace” by escalating or eliminating the amount of time Warner Bros. films would play in theaters before hitting a combined Netflix-HBO Max streaming platform. Sources told Variety earlier on Thursday that Netflix’s current proposal for Warner Bros. would have a theatrical window as thin as two weeks of exclusivity before debuting on streaming. Another insider familiar with the deal process flatly denied this, saying the periods would be longer. Rival bidders Comcast and Paramount both have robust theatrical distribution outlets. Paramount has specifically pledged to keep Warner Bros. operating as a standalone business that will make a minimum of 14 films for theaters per year.\n\n\tThe producers argued that Netflix would “effectively hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace,” with what they assert would be enough market power to reduce the footprint of theatrical movies and force down subsequent licensing fees paid in post-theatrical windows.\n\t\n\n\tThe letter to Congress also references the many times Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, has extolled that Netflix’s business model has nothing to do with movie theaters (including a quote from a 2023 earnings call, where Sarandos said, “Driving folks to a theater is just not our business”).\n\n\tThe note concludes by urging members of the House and Senate to speak out publicly against the acquisition and afford the potential deal “the highest level of antitrust scrutiny.” The stakes, the letter concludes, represent millions of jobs and a treasured art form.\n\n\tMore to come …\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s time to break out those shades. Sony Pictures has tapped Chris Bremner, the writer of “Bad Boys For Life” and “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” to draft a script for a fifth film in the “Men in Black” franchise.\n\n\tIt’s unclear if Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones will return as Agent J and Agent K, the two alien-hunting operatives who anchored three of the four previous films. However, Bremner’s involvement could prove enticing for Smith, who did star in the two “Bad Boys” films that he wrote. Sony previously tried to reboot the series with 2019’s “Men in Black: International,” bringing in Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson as new agents, but the film was a financial disappointment, grossing $253.9 million on a budget of more than $100 million. But Sony clearly thinks the property still has value. Collectively, the films have grossed more than $1.9 billion. \n\t\n\n\tBremner also wrote “The Man From Toronto,” a mistaken identity comedy that starred Kevin Hart and Woody Harrelson. It premiered on Netflix in 2022. He also wrote “Fast & Loose,” a Netflix film that is expected to star Smith. \n\n\n\tThe first “Men in Black” hit theaters in 1997 on the heels of “Independence Day.” Smith and Jones’ chemistry helped turn it into a summer blockbuster, and sequels followed in 2002 and 2012. Smith’s company, Westbrook, recently announced a deal with Paramount, but the actor has kept a lower profile since the Oscar slap controversy.\n\n\tBremner is repped by WME and Kaplan/Perrone Entertainment.\n\n\tSony had no comment on this report. Deadline first reported that a new “Men in Black” is in development. \n",

    "body": "\n\tBilly Porter has joined the Oscar-qualified documentary short, “Freeman Vines,” as an executive producer.\n\n\tDirectors André Robert Lee and Tim Kirkman’s film is a haunting portrait of 82-year-old Freeman Vines, a sculptor and guitar-maker in rural Fountain, N.C., who carves some of his instruments from lumber taken from a tree used in the lynching of a young Black man named Oliver Moore. As Vines faces multiple myeloma and diabetes late in life, the film captures his philosophy, humor and unflinching confrontation with the legacy of racism in the American South. \n\t\n\n\t“Freeman Vines was a fierce, extraordinary human, and this expression of his story is simply gorgeous,” Porter said in a statement Thursday. “The life of an artist can be a hard road, and Freeman navigated a complicated community and history, but he discovered what it meant to live in truth with a freedom he claimed for himself. We should all be so lucky. ‘Freeman Vines,’ directed by André Robert Lee and Tim Kirkman, offers a profound lesson about human connection, resilience and creativity. I am honored to be part of this project, and I hope audiences will truly witness it.”\n\n\n\tThe film took home top honors at multiple Academy-qualifying festivals, including best documentary short at the Tallahassee Film Festival and screened at Tribeca, RiverRun and Florida Film Festivals, as well as selections at Woodstock, Nantucket, Indy Shorts, SCAD Savannah, and other leading showcases.\n\n\tEarlier this fall, the film was acquired by Switchboard Magazine and is currently available to screen via their YouTube Channel. \n\t\n\n\tIn addition to Porter’s company Incognegro, producer Gill Holland’s company The Group Entertainment presents the film in association with Lee’s Many Things Productions, Kirkman’s T42 Entertainment and Music Maker Foundation.\n\n\t“Billy Porter is an American icon in the arts, and it is an honor to partner with him on ‘Freeman Vines,'” Lee and Kirkman said. “We are excited to have Billy’s extraordinary talent and voice on this journey to help bring Freeman’s life story and life’s work to an even greater audience.” \n\n\tSwitchboard founder and editor in chief Celia Aniskovich said, “’Freeman Vines’ story sits at the intersection of music, art, race and spiritual inquiry — the exact kind of layered, character-driven storytelling Switchboard was built to support. As we bring together four Oscar-qualified shorts for a collective awards campaign, ‘Freeman Vines’ is a soul-stirring cornerstone of that slate. We’re thrilled to welcome Billy Porter to the team as we introduce this film to wider audiences.”\n\n\t“Freeman Vines” is one of four Oscar-qualified shorts — alongside “Poreless,” “Rat Rod” and “Saving Superman” — being championed in Switchboard’s collective awards campaign this season.  \n\n",

    "body": "\n\tWho knew the end of the world could be so life-affirming? And who would have guessed that a Stephen King short story adapted by fellow Master of Horror Mike Flanagan would result in the feel-good movie of the year?\n\n\tThe challenge with talking about “The Life of Chuck” is that it’s a film that should be discovered — the less you know going in, the better. Which made it challenging to market. Is it a drama? A musical? A romance? A coming-of-age story? A movie that does nothing less than ask about the meaning of life? Well, yes.\n\t\n\n\tThe film is broken into three acts, told in reverse chronology. The first act finds the world crumbling due to an unspecified apocalyptic event. The internet is down, there’s no television — and yet mysterious billboards and commercials thanking someone named Charles “Chuck” Krantz begin popping up everywhere. In the second act, we meet a grown Chuck (played by Tom Hiddleston) on a pivotal day in his life. The third act details Chuck’s childhood, where he’s raised by his grandfather Albie (Mark Hamill, never better). All questions about Chuck will be answered as the story examines big questions about the universe through the life of one ordinary man. \n\n\n\tIt’s an act of courage to be earnest and optimistic in a world where audiences aren’t accustomed to sincerity. “We live in a cynical world and we work in a cynical industry,” says Flanagan. “We’re kind of instructed to be cynical, to be on guard and not to lead with our emotions, because that’s vulnerable.” To that end, Flanagan and company knew their film wouldn’t appeal to everyone. \n\t\n\n\tBut people have responded — the film was the winner of the coveted Audience Award at last year’s Toronto International Film Festival. Hamill’s wife is also a fan. “She never hesitates to say: ‘This is my favorite thing he’s ever done,’” the actor reveals. And perhaps the greatest endorsement came from King himself, who the filmmaker says told him: “I don’t know how it will play for everyone, but this works for me because its heart is on its sleeve.”\n\n\tHuge credit is due to the outstanding ensemble — in addition to Hamill and Hiddleston, Flanagan regulars like Jacob Tremblay, Kate Siegel and Annalise Basso make appearances, proving the old adage that there’s no such thing as a small role. Karen Gillan (also a return player) and Chiwetel Ejiofor play a divorced couple in one of the most romantic scenes of the year. And Nick Offerman gives one of the best performances of the year simply by lending his voice to the Narrator. But it’s Benjamin Pajak as 11-year-old Chuck and Hamill who provide the heart and soul of the film. Flanagan is known for his gorgeous dialogue, and it may sound like a joke, but Hamill articulates a monologue to Pajak about the importance of math that sounds like poetry.\n\n\tIt’s a stunning achievement, especially considering King himself never thought it would happen. Asked why Flanagan is such a good interpreter of his work, he declared the director to be fearless. “I never would have believed, out of all the stories I’ve ever written, that ‘The Life of Chuck’ would ever be a movie,” King notes. How happy he was to be proven wrong.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothée Chalamet joined Lucid Motors for a speed-round interview and got asked to name the greatest actors of all time. The “Call Me By Your Name” and “A Complete Unknown” Oscar nominee answered: “Denzel’s the Goat, Christian Bale’s the Second Goat and Joaquin’s the Strange Goat.” Chalamet starred with Bale in the 2017 Western drama “Hostiles.”\n\n\tWhen asked who is the best person to get a text from, Chalamet’s answer was another iconic actor: Leonardo DiCaprio. The “One Battle After Another” star actually texted Chalamet shortly before he did the video interview. \n\t\n\n\t“He fried me today. He said, ‘I heard you shaved your head. Say it ain’t so,'” Chalamet said of DiCaprio’s text about his viral haircut, which presumably was done for his return as Paul Atreides in Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part 3.”\n\n\n\tChalamet counts DiCaprio has one of his Hollywood mentors. The two starred together in “Don’t Look Up.” During that film’s press tour, Chalamet revealed that DiCaprio once gave him brief but essential career advice: “No hard drugs and no superhero movies.”\n\n\tSpeaking to The New York Times last year, Chalamet said the door on starring in comic book movies is not completely shut the way it might be for DiCaprio: “Well, Leonardo DiCaprio said to me, ‘No superhero movies, no hard drugs.’ Which I thought was very good. I follow them both! But the movie that made me want to act is a superhero movie, ‘The Dark Knight.’ If the script was great, if the director was great, I’d have to consider it.”\n\n\t“The Dark Knight” factored into Chalamet’s answer when he was asked about the greatest villain in movie history. His pick is Heath Ledger’s Joker. Chalamet has spoken about the performance with adoration many times throughout his career.\n\t\n\n\t“When I was 12 years old, after attending one of my sister Pauline’s [ballet] performances, I petitioned my Mom and grandma to see Christopher Nolan’s ‘The Dark Knight’ with me,” Chalamet said during his best actor acceptance speech in 2018 at the New York FiIm Critics Circle awards. “We went to AMC Empire 25 in Times Square for a 7:30 screening. I left that theatre a changed man, and I’m serious about that. Heath Ledger‘s performance in that film was visceral and viral to me, and I now had the acting bug.”\n\n\tWatch Chalamet’s full video interview in the post below.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tAfter a long studio session in Los Angeles, Rosé needed to let her hair down. So she taught her collaborators — songwriters Omer Fedi and Amy Allen ",
    "body": "\n\tAfter a long studio session in Los Angeles, Rosé needed to let her hair down. So she taught her collaborators — songwriters Omer Fedi and Amy Allen — a Korean drinking game over late-night McDonald’s. It involved a chant that casually resurfaced the following day. “She randomly started saying, ‘Apateu, apateu,’” producer Cirkut recalls. “And that was it — we knew we had to make that song.” \n\n\tThat song became “APT.,” a Grammy-nominated collaboration with Bruno Mars that bridges languages, cultures and genres in a way not seen since Psy’s 2012 smash “Gangnam Style.” For Rosé, the success of “APT.” provided validation. “It feels surreal, because the song carries so much of my culture,” she says. “It proves to me that even if I can stay true to my authentic self, I can still break records and have the whole world sing and dance along.” \n\t\n\n\tIt’s an incredible outcome for a song that was almost canned. “I had it on repeat till morning,” Rosé says. “Then a rush of emotion came through, and I was like, ‘I need to get everybody to delete it’ — I was overwhelmed.” However, the genie was out of the bottle. “Everyone I played it for kept texting me saying they couldn’t get it out of their heads.” \n\n\n\t“Looking back, my biggest contribution to ‘APT.’ was jumping on the idea the moment it hit the room,” Cirkut says. Rosé and the assembled songwriters got to work on the “apateu” hook, while he focused on the beat. “My mind immediately went to pop-punk drums and that high-energy, cheerleader kind of vibe — that helped set the tone for the whole song.” \n\t\n\n\tThat approach aligned with another facet of Rosé’s identity: her upbringing in Australia. The song’s iconic chant reminded her of the country’s go-to sporting cry. “It’s kind of like the Aussie ‘Oi! Oi! Oi!,’” she says. “Even if you don’t know what it means, you just want to shout it.” As the crosscultural concoction took shape, the team still felt like an ingredient was missing. \n\n\tThat’s where G Rouzbehani, senior VP of A&R at Atlantic Records, enters the story. “Rosé expressed how much she looked up to Bruno Mars,” Rouzbehani recalls. “So when she came to L.A., we introduced them, and they clicked right away.” Later, Rouzbehani played Mars a handful of demos, and “APT.” stood out to him. \n\n\t“The skeleton of the record was there from the very beginning,” Rouzbehani explains. “When Bruno No. 20 jumped on, they rewrote the first verse together, elevated the production and took it to another level.” That energy was felt by everyone in the room. Rouzbehani says, “They’d come out of the studio and play me a new version, go back in and come out again.” She adds, “We all felt it was special.” \n\n\t“One of the biggest turning points was when Bruno heard the song,” Cirkut says. “He got really hands-on, playing live drums over my programmed drums, bass, everything.” Mars turned out to be the perfect creative foil for Rosé. “His vocals complemented hers perfectly,” Cirkut adds. “That’s when I realized it could be huge.” \n\n\tFor Rosé, the record was transformative. “It still feels like I’m dreaming,” she says. That gratitude carried over to her debut solo album, “Rosie,” which she describes as “a time capsule of my 20s. It’s me becoming independent and reflecting on my emotions and being my full, authentic self,” she says. “I poured my heart and soul into it.”\n\n\tEven with solo success, Grammy nominations and chart records to her name, Rosé is focused on what’s next. “Next year feels like another chapter,” she says. “I have so many ideas, but I’m taking it a day at a time.” She pauses as if to ponder the possibilities ahead of her. “I’m just excited,” she beams. “I’m a human being who’s excited for life.” \n\n\tSongwriters: Chae Young Park, Amy Allen, Christopher Brody Brown, Rogét Chahayed, Omer Fedi, Philip Lawrence, Bruno Mars, Theron Thomas, Henry Walter, Michael Chapman, Nicholas Chinn \n\t\n\n\tProducers: Bruno Mars, Cirkut, Omer Fedi, Rogét Chahayed \n\n\tHitmakers: \n\n\tAmy Allen, songwriter \n\n\tCirkut, producer \n\n\tOmer Fedi, songwriter \n\n\tG Rouzbehani, SVP, A&R, Atlantic Music Group \n\n\tTheron Thomas, songwriter\n",

    "body": "\n\tClint Bentley’s “Train Dreams” follows the Joel Edgerton as Robert Grainier, a logger and railroad worker living in the Pacific NorthWest.\n\n\tSet in the late 1960s, “Train Dreams” is directed by “Sing Sing” co-writer Clint Bentley who called on Adolpho Veloso to be the film’s cinematographer.\n\n\tThe images are lush. The tall green trees pop against the clear blue sky, until a wildfire ravages the forest and changes Grainger’s life. Suddenly, the palette is ash and grey reflecting the aftermath.\n\t\n\n\tVeloso’s imagery is one that lingers long after the film credits have rolled. In one scene, it’s a grand moment, as the tall trees get sawed down all in the name of progress.\n\n\tVeloso sat down with Variety for Inside the Frame and said, “For 99% of the movie, we used natural light.”\n\n\tWith Bentley shooting in real-life locations, the idea was to simulate the audience looking through memories and putting a life together where those the images were being shown. In this case, those memories belong to Edgerton’s character, Robert.\n\n\tFor research, Veloso looked through a lot of old pictures from the era and even as far back as 1920. As he was going through them, it dawned on him that they looked like the 3:20 aspect ratio. Says Veloso, “We just kept going back to this memory feeling. We were like, ‘Why we just don’t use that aspect ratio?’”\n\n\tOnce they had that, Veloso knew this would be an intimate film, and also tried to capture the beauty of the natural setting. To properly film in natural light and capture the beauty of the landscape, Veloso says, “We knew we needed a smaller camera and because of the natural light…we just decided to go with the Alexa 35 to have a lot of dynamic range.”\n\t\n\n\tSimilarly, for the scenes at night, natural was key, so he used real fire and candles to light those. He says, “We wanted to keep it that way to feel a bit more grounded.”\n\n\tThe lush imagery in the film was captured using Kowa Spherical lenses. At night, he switched to Zeiss Super Speeds lenses.\n\n\tAfter the forest fire devastates much of the landscape, and Grainger’s home, the earthy tones disappear with very little pops of green. That was all natural, Veloso says.\n\n\tWatch the video above.\n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLeonardo DiCaprio, director Paul Thomas Anderson in “One Battle After Another”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett C\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCritics Choice Awards Commentary (Updated: Dec. 4, 2025): As awards season shifts into high gear, all eyes turn to the Critics Choice — one of the most reliable predictors of Oscar success. \n\n\tSelected by roughly 575 voting members, the Critics Choice Awards tend to reflect broader industry consensus, offering a temperature check on which films have captured critical hearts and minds.\n\n\tLast season proved the organization’s predictive power. “Anora” used a Critics Choice best picture win to reassert itself after being shut out at the Golden Globes and SAG Awards — momentum it carried all the way to the Academy Awards. Three acting winners — Adrien Brody, Kieran Culkin and Zoe Saldaña — also repeated at the Oscars.\n\n\tThis year, the CCA race appears to be taking shape around two clear frontrunners. Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” and Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” are expected to lead the tally, followed closely by “Frankenstein,” “Hamnet,” “Wicked: For Good” and “Marty Supreme.” The diversity of this top tier — spanning prestige drama, genre filmmaking, literary adaptation and musical spectacle — shows a year without a single dominant narrative.\n\n\tFor the first time in its history, the CCA released an official shortlist across 11 artisan categories, spotlighting the behind-the-scenes craftspeople who created some of the year’s most acclaimed films. There is still an opportunity for “Avatar: Fire and Ash” from James Cameron to pop up in a few artisan races, and perhaps even best picture, especially coming after AFI and NBR top 10 mentions.\n\n\tThe group doesn’t always embrace non-English language films early in the race, as evidenced by “Anatomy of a Fall” nabbing a single nomination for international feature at the 2023 ceremony before later garnering multiple Oscar mentions including best picture and winning original screenplay. Joachim Trier’s Norwegian drama “Sentimental Value” should perform solidly enough to secure several nominations, but Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just an Accident” may struggle to replicate its recent critical success with the organization. \n\n\tThe CCA film nominations will be announced Friday, Dec. 5. \n\n\tRead the final nomination predictions below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Picture\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)\n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\n“Hamnet” (Focus Features)\n“Marty Supreme” (A24)\n“Frankenstein” (Netflix)\n“Sentimental Value” (Neon)\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix)\n“Wicked: For Good” (Universal Pictures)\n“Jay Kelly” (Netflix)\n“F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.)\n\n\n\n\tAlternates: “Avatar: Fire and Ash” (20th Century Studios); “Bugonia” (Focus Features); “It Was Just an Accident” (Neon)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDirector\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Agata Grzybowska\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson, “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)\nRyan Coogler, “Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\nChloé Zhao, “Hamnet” (Focus Features)\nGuillermo Del Toro, “Frankenstein” (Netflix)\nJosh Safdie, “Marty Supreme” (A24)\nJafar Panahi, “It Was Just an Accident” (Neon)\n\n\n\n\tAlternates: Joachim Trier, “Sentimental Value” (Neon); Jon M.

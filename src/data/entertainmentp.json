    "body": "\n\tWillie Colón, a legendary salsa musician who played a pivotal role in the Nuyorican salsa movement, died Saturday, his family confirmed in a statement posted to his Facebook account. He was 75. \n\n\t“It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved husband, father and renowned musician, Willie Colón. He passed away peacefully this morning, surrounded by his loving family,” the statement reads. “While we grieve his absence, we also rejoice in the timeless gift of his music and the cherished memories he created that will live on forever.”\n\t\n\n\tThe statement continued: “Our family is deeply grateful for your prayers and support during this time of mourning. We kindly ask for privacy as we navigate our grief.” \n\n\n\tBorn on April 28, 1950, in the South Bronx neighborhood of New York City, Colón began his career with his first album, “El Malo,” recorded with vocalist Héctor Lavoe at just 16 years old. The two went on to form a salsa duo on the Fania record label and have been credited with revolutionizing Latin music as a genre; in 1969, their song “Che Ché Colé” is regarded as an especially pivotal moment. \n\n\tAlongside Lavoe, orchestrations by Colón popularized songs like “Calle Luna, calle Sol,” “Abuelita,” “Ah, ah, oh, no,” “Ghana’e,” “El día de mi suerte,” “La murga” and “Juana Peña,” among others. Following the pair’s partnership, Colón launched his singing career in the late 1970s with albums including “The Good, the Bad, the Ugly” in 1976 and “Solo” in 1988. His discography includes more than 40 albums. \n\t\n\n\tColón earned nine gold records and five platinum records over the course of his career, selling more than eight million records worldwide. The musician also collaborated with other artists, including Rubén Blades and Celia Cruz. He was nominated for eight Grammy Awards in the tropical music category. \n\n\tIn addition to his prowess as a musician, Colón was also an avid sociopolitical activist, lending his voice to endorse New York politicians and on the stages of Latino neighborhoods. The musician also made appearances in a range of film and television productions, including “Vigilante,” “The Last Fight,” “Salsa,” “Miami Vice” and “La Intrusa.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story discusses spoilers for “How To Make A Killing,” now playing in theaters\n\n\tGrowing up with a father in the FBI, John Patton Ford’s bedtime stories and dinner table conversations often involved criminals. That’s probably where his fascination with the world of crime originated. \n\n\t“There was always something really familiar about those things to me,” Ford tells Variety. “I grew up thinking of them as people, and not as bad guys in a movie.” \n\t\n\n\tBoth of Ford’s films deal with the immoral; the writer-director’s debut feature, “Emily the Criminal” focuses on a college graduate who, saddled with debt, becomes a dummy shopper in an elaborate credit card scam; his latest, “How To Make A Killing,” centers on the blue-collar Becket Redfellow (played by Glen Powell, the “hardest working guy in the business,” according to Ford), whose mother was disowned by her obscenely wealthy family when she got pregnant with him. In an effort to escape his ordinary life in New Jersey, Becket decides to kill off his seven relatives to claim a $28 billion inheritance.\n\n\n\tThe A24 movie is a loose reimagining of the black comedy “Kind Hearts and Coronets,” which Ford first watched back in 2012. “I was pretty stunned with how contemporary it was,” he says. “It’s a movie that came out in the U.K. in 1949, and yet it wrestles with issues that just seem so prescient. At what time wouldn’t this concept be relevant?” \n\n\t“How To Make A Killing” follows similar beats as its precursor; Becket succeeds in killing off each family member, falling for his deceased cousin’s girlfriend, Ruth (Jessica Henwick), in the process. In the end, he gets arrested and sentenced to death, not for any of the murders he actually committed, but instead after being framed by Julia (Margaret Qualley), his childhood crush and a modern-day femme fatale, for the murder of her husband. \n\t\n\n\tAs it turns out, Julia, who visits Becket in prison hours before his execution, actually has her late husband’s suicide note that would exonerate him — on the condition that he signs over his inheritance to her. Becket obliges.  \n\n\tWhat follows is where Ford’s take on the British crime film most differs from the source material. When Becket is released from prison, Ruth is waiting in the parking lot — but only to end things with him face to face. She leaves, revealing Julia, dressed in a funereal black Chanel set, waiting outside a chauffeured Rolls-Royce. Wordlessly, Becket goes to her, gets in the car and the two are driven back to the gargantuan Redfellow estate on Long Island, with tears in his eyes. Compare it to “Kind Hearts and Coronets,” where both women are sitting outside in their carriages (spoiler: the Becket of that film, Louis, chooses Sibella, the Julia, of his own volition). \n\n\t“For a modern audience, I don’t think anyone would have enjoyed Ruth standing by him after all of that,” says Henwick. “Ruth had to remove herself. It’s just too depressing.” \n\n\tWhile Becket ultimately evades justice in the traditional sense, Ruth’s exit leaves Becket a “totally disempowered man,” explains Henwick. “[Ruth] has taken away his option for joy, and Julia is not going to be the life that he actually wants. She’s going to be a terror, and she held his fate in his hands. So it’s his comeuppance.” \n\n\tFord agrees: “At the end of the movie, he gets what he always thought he wanted, but it’s too late, and now he knows he would have been better off with a different kind of life. So he gets his goal, but only after he realizes that he actually doesn’t want it. There’s an irony there that’s deliberate.” \n\n\tOriginally, Ford had a different, “way more severe” ending in mind. In the initial script, Becket gets out of jail with Ruth, who had given birth to their child while he was incarcerated, waiting for him. “He’s going towards her, and then he sees that Julia is there as well,” says Ford. “And in that moment, he changes his mind and decides to leave Ruth, leave the child, and go with Julia, because he realizes that’s who he really is after all this time.”  \n\n\tIt had to change for a few reasons — the most notable one being that Ford agreed it would’ve been “especially punishing for audiences” who’d spent the past hour and 45 minutes attempting to understand, and even sympathize, with Becket. That’s one of the perks of casting Powell, “a golden retriever of a human being,” to play a serial killer, says Ford: you want to root for him! \n\t\n\n\t“Glen is kind of an unlikely candidate to go and, like, kill eight people; he’s just irrepressibly good,” explains Ford. “He has the air of someone who is working really hard and working towards a goal. There’s a popular feeling that he’s working at being a movie star, and he’s on this Tom Cruise trajectory. And I thought, if it’s Glen, [the audience will] be like, ‘This guy thinks he’s doing the right thing. This guy is just trying to do his best.’ And the irony is that he has absolutely no moral or ethical code whatsoever.”\n\n\tBut that ending went a beat too far. “I think the studio was kind of freaked out,” Ford adds. “They were like, ‘You can’t have people sit through this entire movie and then punish them at that level.’”\n\n\tThough, as Henwick points out, Becket choosing Julia would’ve felt true to the character. “Is it really jaded and sad to say I think most people would make the same choice as him? When confronted with [Ruth] and her beat-up Honda, or Julia and her billions, I do think most people would go with Julia.” \n\n\tAnother reason for the change was that it would’ve left Becket entirely unscathed — out of jail, still a billionaire, still in love, or at least lust — rather than how it does end for him: free, rich, but doomed to a life devoid of meaning.  \n\n\t“I didn’t want to just completely let him off the hook and get away with everything,” says Ford. “And yet I didn’t want it to be totally punishing and one-dimensional. I wanted it to be complex. I wanted him to get something but lose something and have mixed feelings about it.” \n\n\tAnd in case anyone needs clarification, Becket’s tears as he’s back through the gates of the estate aren’t happy ones. “He will certainly come to regret things, but he may not admit it,” Ford confirms. “Or admit it to himself.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tEric Dane’s closest friends started a GoFundMe to raise money for his wife and two daughters after the actor’s death on Feb. 19.\n\n\tThe GoFundMe page says of Dane, who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, in 2025, “Following his diagnosis, Eric became a passionate spokesperson for the ALS community, using his voice and platform to advocate for fellow patients and to push for greater awareness. Even as his own health declined, he remained deeply committed to helping others facing the same devastating disease. As his illness progressed far more quickly than anyone could have imagined, Eric’s friends have come together to create this GoFundMe to support his girls and their future needs.”\n\t\n\n\tIt concluded, “Any contribution, no matter the size, will help provide stability during this incredibly difficult time and in the future for Eric’s wonderful daughters.”\n\n\n\t$178,064 has been raised so far of the $250,000 goal. “Euphoria” director Sam Levinson and executive producer Ashley Levinson are currently the top donors with a joint donation of $27,000 dollars.\n\n\tFollowing news of Dane’s death, tributes poured out online from his closest collaborators. “Grey’s Anatomy” creator Shonda Rhimes, who gave Dane his most widely recognized role of Dr. Mark Sloan, aka “McSteamy,” released a statement of remembrance on Instagram. She wrote that Dane’s “portrayal of Dr. Mark Sloan left an indelible mark on the series and on audiences around the world.”\n\n\tThe statement continued, “We are grateful for the artistry, spirit, friendship and humanity he shared with us for so many years. Our hearts are with his family, loved ones, and all who were touched by his work.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMajor Brazilian streamer Globoplay has worked extensively over the last five years to solidify its international presence in a bid to achieve what few others have: to make local content from South America that not only resonates globally but also generates tangible impact within international markets and events. The streamer has had an original series play the Berlinale Series Market for the last three years, and, earlier this week, won the coveted Studio Babelsberg Production Excellence Award for “Emergency 53.” \n\t\n\n\tThe newly introduced award is significant for Globoplay’s internationalization efforts, given that it honors outstanding creative projects that combine artistic ambition with international potential. “Emergency 53” comes from the same creative team as Globoplay’s major hit procedural series “Under Pressure,” Andrucha Waddington and Cláudio Torres, plus creator and consultant Márcio Maranhão. The series, scheduled to launch later this year, follows a group of doctors, nurses and drivers of a special mobile service unit as they navigate personal and professional dramas. “Emergency 53” is produced by Torres and Waddington’s leading Conspiração banner. \n\n\n\tIn their statement, the Berlinale Series Market jury responsible for choosing the winner of the inaugural Studio Babelsberg Production Excellence Award said the series “distinguished itself with a confident grasp of the procedural form, a compelling young protagonist, and a diverse ensemble rich with emotional and narrative potential.”\n\n\t“Its setting is one of the series’ greatest achievements: a vibrant, complex environment portrayed not as a backdrop but as an active force shaping the narrative,” continued the statement. “This specificity lends the show both texture and social relevance, elevating it beyond the conventions of emergency room or police procedurals. Its setting — rarely seen in high-production mainstream drama — gives the series substance, urgency, and social depth. It is ambitious, fresh, and profoundly rooted in the world it portrays.”\n\t\n\n\tAlex Medeiros, head of content and fiction at Globoplay and Globo Filmes told Variety he and his team are “incredibly proud to be the recipients of this award, which not only recognizes the artistry of the series, but also reaffirms the power of quintessentially Brazilian stories to resonate with audiences around the world.” The executive adds that, “there seems to be great Latin American momentum in international film and television, and we are honored to be part of that.”\n\n\tTanja Meissner, director of the Berlinale Pro, added that she and her team are “delighted about the successful first collaboration with Studio Babelsberg.” “The joint event was a great success – featuring surprised winners and very positive feedback. This experience leaves us optimistic, and we look forward to hopefully continuing this promising partnership in the future to further promote outstanding global scripted series and set new creative standards together.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder Pressure\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobo\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWaddington emphasized his desire to share the honor not only with his team but also “all Brazilian public healthcare workers.” Speaking with Variety ahead of the series first screening in Berlin, the director highlighted how the project feels deeply specific to a particular area of Brazil’s healthcare system while maintaining a vital element of universality in how it broaches class inequality — all while avoiding the possible traps of the formulaic. \n\n\t“Globoplay really trusted us when we pitched the project,” he said. “We were a bit unsure at first. Today, watching all 10 episodes, we firmly believe in the format. Audiences liked to be prodded and we shouldn’t underestimate viewers. With ‘Emergency 53,’ we are broaching major societal issues without repeating ourselves with every episode.”\n\n\tTorres added that it is “wonderful” to be a creative working within an international landscape that is much more open to projects from different countries and cultures, citing the watershed best picture Oscar win for Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite” in 2019. “Nowadays, you see young people watching stories rooted in the reality of South Korea, Sweden, Iceland…. I think Brazil has a lot to offer because it is a paradoxical country, and this very paradox is the foundation of our series.”  \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 76th Berlin Film Festival winds down on Sunday, Feb. 22 but new deals are still brewing. Among them is that from France’s Epicentre Films, which has boarded “Dog Legs” (“Patas de perro”), the latest feature from Chile’s Matias Rojas (“A Place Called Dignity”), starring Chile’s inimitable Alfredo Castro (“The Count,” “The Club”).\n\n\tIt joins producing partners from Chile (Tomás Gerlach Mora – A Simple Vista), Colombia (Federico Durán) and Germany (Linus Günther – Klinker).\n\t\n\n\tLed by Daniel Chabannes, Julie Bergeron, Birgit Kemmer and Corentin Sénéchal, Epicentre’s truly international slate includes Colombia’s Oscar-entry “A Poet,” to which it picked up French distribution rights ahead of its Cannes premiere last May.\n\n\n\tInspired by the 1965 eponymous novel by Chilean literary giant Carlos Droguett, winner of Chile’s National Prize for Literature in 1970, “Dog Legs” takes place in a remote Southern Chilean town where Bobi, a young boy born with dog legs, is kept hidden by his family. The status quo changes when Carlos, a loner who is new in town (played by Castro), decides to help Bobi integrate into society. He is instead met with increasing hostility as people view him as a madman and the boy a monster.\n\n\t“Castro loves this book. He sees it as a sharp reflection of the current identity crisis affecting the youth of today,” said Durán (“El Paramo,” “Rebellion”), speaking on behalf of his fellow producers and who has boarded the film as an individual producer.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAlfredo Castro\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Masala Films\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Widely regarded as one of the most extreme and influential works of 20th-century Chilean literature, it has long been described as strange, hybrid and ‘monstrous,’ much like its central character: Bobi, the boy with dog’s legs,” said Rojas, adding: “The first time I read it, I was deeply moved; I immersed myself in its stream of consciousness, which evokes loneliness, the struggle of living with an untreated psychiatric condition, the search for belonging and the fear of losing what one has learned to love.”\n\t\n\n\t“In today’s world – shaped by mass migrations, widening inequalities and urgent debates on diversity and human rights – ‘Dog Legs’ resonates with unsettling relevance. The film reflects on how societies construct symbolic borders between the ‘normal’ and the ‘abnormal’ and how these borders generate pain, isolation and violence. At its core, it engages with hybridity, liminality and the monstrous as forms of resistance,” he reflected.\n\n\tSpeaking of his plans on how to shoot the feature, Rojas said: “The camera will follow Bobi in his passage between the human and the animal, the intimate and the collective, shaping a film that moves between the contemplative and the visceral.”\n\n\tThe project’s development journey included participating in the Guadalajara Co-Production Meeting; Sitges FanPitch; Cinéma en Développement Toulouse; Venice Production Bridge and Cannes Marché du Film before it landed at the EFM Berlinale.\n\n\tLead produced by A Simple Vista, Rojas’ third feature is in its advanced financing phase, with Chilean funds already secured and additional funding from each co-producing country expected in 2026. A location shoot is planned for Valdivia, Southern Chile, in 2027.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBack in June 2010, James “Jamie” Carroll’s body was discovered by Louisville police.\n\n\tThe house on 1435 South Fourth Street, owned by Jeffrey Mundt and his boyfriend Joseph “Joey” Banis, became a crime scene. At the time, Banis and Mundt were dating, and a wild night involving sex and drugs led to a bloody murder. But who did it?\n\n\tIn HBO‘s two-part true-crime doc “Murder in Glitterball City,” now streaming on HBO and HBO Max, filmmakers Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato seek to put the pieces together.\n\t\n\n\tOver the two-part series, they use community to help tell the story of this couple and how, at the center of it all, was a very toxic relationship. The doc opens with what appears to be Banis confessing on camera, but as the story unfolds, that doesn’t appear to be the case.\n\n\n\tAs gruesome as the murder was, Bailey says, it was important to honor the victim. “This is a true crime story. It’s also a queer story. David, who wrote the book, is gay, and we’re queer filmmakers.” He adds, “In telling it, we wanted to avoid being coy about the details, but also present the details, and that was the best way to tell Jamie’s story and remember him.”\n\n\tBoth Banis and Mundt were tried for murder, but Banis remains in prison, while Mundt walks free. Bailey and Barbato sat down to talk about the film, and share thoughts on the film’s ending.\n\t\n\t\tWhen did you both discover, or when did you learn about this murder, and what happened next?\t\n\n\tRandy Barbato: It was over five years ago. Lisa Heller and Nancy Abraham from HBO said, “We have a book we’re going to send to you. Take a look at it.” We read David Dominé’s “A Dark Room in Glitter Ball City: Murder, Secrets, and Scandal in Old Louisville,” and we were like, “What is this?” So, we flew to Louisville and spent a few days ringing people, knocking on doors, and tracking people down in the book. We came back and called HBO, and we said, “We have to make this, and we don’t know what it’s going to be.” We spent the next four years talking about it, going back and forth.\n\t\n\n\tAt the heart of it is a gruesome crime, but there are these concentric circles of fascination and incredible characters and just who inspired us and made us laugh. We asked, “Wait, how are we going to make all this fit together? And I don’t know if we did, but I do know we finished it.”\n\t\n\t\tI went down a rabbit hole after I finished it, and I saw a headline that said, “It’s a real-life ‘How to Get Away With Murder.’” And that’s exactly what it is, but how did you find the right people to tell this story? You’ve got Angelique X Stacy for one, and then you have John and Missy, and you go to the legal side of people.\t\n\n\tFenton Bailey: It’s a large cast of characters, isn’t it? And in a way, this is looking at it after the fact, but it’s a bit like the disco ball itself. You’ve got this single event; it hits the disco ball, and all these different versions, reflections and ideas bounce off it.\n\n\tIn the case of John and Missy, that’s how David’s book begins, and it’s so good because we said, “We’ve got to find them.” When we met with them, they were such great characters. And you’ve got an enclave of Old Louisville that is just a few blocks that was saved from the demolition ball by these gay guys. They’re not in the film. But, other gay people moved in, and artists came, so you have this unique little time capsule with these Bohemian, creative characters, all within a tight few blocks.\n\t\n\t\tAside from the characters, there’s a wealth of archival footage that helps piece this puzzle together. Talk about going through that and how you were putting your own CSI crime board together.\t\n\n\tBarbato: We are archive queens, and you know this about us, but we have an incredible team that we work with, and they are also archive queens. It’s interesting because now that you mentioned it, there’s a lot of archive in this. That archive is a character that we used and needed, and it was part of the gig of putting the story together.\n\n\tBailey: One thing that happened was partway through, we were speaking to Joey in prison, and he gave permission to his lawyer to let us have a copy of his laptop. And so we suddenly found all this stuff. And this was in 2012-2013, when even though there were texts, iPhones and emails and all that in abundance, policing hadn’t really caught up to that with those sorts of departments, and so there was so much stuff that they just had never been able to look at. That material ends up being the linchpin to the whole story, because it begins with this videotape of Joey appearing to confess to the crime at the very beginning, and then, of course, as everything unfolds, you realize that is not what it appears to be. But there is an enormous amount of information at a time when I don’t think the authorities really were able to process it. Even now, with the Epstein files, they don’t seem able to process it all. It’s just the volume. Some of what Joey himself captured, either by phone calls or texts, or videos, is pretty extraordinary. Such as when, for reasons best known to them, it looks like Jeffrey started a counterfeiting operation. It’s pretty mind-blowing.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tGoing back to what you said, Randy. You are the archive queens and documentary queens. Going in, having read the book, what questions did you go in wanting to know, or were hoping to get answered, and then at the end of it, when you were done, what questions did you still have?\t\n\n\tBarbato: The primary question was, had justice been served, and what don’t we know about the crime and the story? But as we started making the film, a million other questions surfaced. We started learning about the community, the city and different characters and their connection to it. There was a different question every day. A lot of it became organic. We stuck with trying to better understand the crime, and what it becomes is this psycho drama as well. So you’re trying to understand and build out these character portraits of these two people, and of course, Jamie, who is very important for us to humanize him and to not label him as a victim buried in a basement. So it was an endless course of discovery.\n\n\tAnd that thing of how do you connect the discovery we made of all the ancillary characters with the crime at the heart of this story, and what is that connection? That became a huge obsession for us, because it was, “Why are these people as important as what’s in the center and the crime, and what is their connection?\n\n\tBailey: We had an education witness, LaTanya, and she was brought in to talk about domestic abuse and how it works, and the dynamics of it.\n\n\tBarbato: She helped us understand why community is so important when it comes to crime. There are these horrific crimes that happen that you think have no relationship to you, and you have no connection to, but that’s actually not the case at all. We are all impacted, and we all can learn in some way. And so we didn’t even know that was a question we were going to need an answer to, and we never would have thought she was the one to give it to us.\n\n\tBailey: In the immediate context of the trial, she was there to help support Jeffrey’s defense argument that he was a victim of domestic abuse and that he was terrified, and that didn’t really entirely sit with the way we felt when you look at the everything of it all. But she was saying that toxic relationships are dangerous, not just to the people in them, but more alarmingly, that people should know that they can be dangerous to innocent bystanders, and that people around can get caught up in it. It’s very true in this case, and because Jamie was really an innocent bystander.\n\t\n\n\tAnd what did we go in with, and what is the question we have at the end, who did it? You know, although I think really after, like, talking about it for hours and months and years. I think Randy and I both think that two people should be in jail, not just one.\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a lot of humanity in this. How did you find that balance while telling the story?\t\n\n\tBarbato: We were really trying to do that. It’s because of who we are, and regardless of what role anyone played, including potentially being the murderer, we are all human, and to understand anything is to connect with that, and to communicate with empathy and to have a connection with people you know, including all the attorneys. You can watch so many true crime stories or programs, and they do a great job. They’re amazing, but they’re very procedural, and I don’t often feel a connection with any of the people, and so for us that’s really important.\n\n\tIn Joey’s case, it’s just being curious about how he came to be who he is, because clearly, when his first boyfriend talks about them, and they’re falling in love, it’s this beautiful story until it turns dark, but it’s so sweet that you realize even monsters have some soft spot.\n\t\n\t\tIt’s interesting saying that, because you wonder when people become monsters, at what point, do you turn into that person?\t\n\n\tBailey: Unless the monsters do exist, and they’re the ones who escape justice. If a monster is there, and the monster is those who escape justice or being held to account. And I think to some degree that might have happened in this story.\n\n\tWatch the trailer below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tConsidering all the horror movies I’ve seen, I’m a pretty easy jump scare. I can sit through the degraded slasher-film trash of the week, and when that formula shock cut arrives, synced to a bombastic music cue, I’m gullible enough to get goosed.\n\n\tThat said, there are only three times in my life when I’ve seen a movie that chilled me to the bone of primal fear. The first one was “Carrie” in 1976. That incredible finale, when Amy Irving’s Sue is reaching down to Carrie White’s grave and Carrie’s blood-stained hand pokes out of the rubble, made me literally stand up out of my seat in terror. The next time I got scared on that level was my first viewing of “Psycho,” which didn’t happen until a few years after I’d seen “Carrie.” I could feel the fear factor of the shower scene ripping a hole in my soul.\n\t\n\n\tBoth of those moments were jolts. They are, to me, the two greatest jolts in cinema history, but they’re still powerfully visceral and kinesthetic. But the third time I had that experience, where a movie so terrified me I felt almost too scared to stay in the theater, it was a very different thing. It was the scene where Tom Noonan, who died Wednesday at 74, first appears as the serial killer of Michael Mann’s extraordinary “Manhunter.”\n\n\n\tNoonan’s killer is unnervingly tall, with a stocking mask over the top half of his head, strands of gray-blond hair poking out the back. He has thick lips, one of them scarred, that curl into a leer. Clad in a long silk shirt that’s dark blue with blobs of white, he stands next to a victim he has abducted — a trembling sleaze from a tabloid newspaper — whom he has epoxied to a wheelchair. After tearing off the blindfold that’s glued to the victim’s eyelids, he stares down at him, and at us, and says, “Here I…am.” And we behold.\n\t\n\n\tHe wants his victim to look at photographs (of his murders), which he’s clicking through on a slide projector. “Do you see?” he says. The voice — this is part of the terror — is far from what we were expecting. It’s not an ominous voice. It’s quiet and weirdly neutral, almost delicate in its staccato insecurity; it’s the sound of someone whose emotions are totally divorced from his actions. And at that moment, listening to this unhinged freak, you forget every psycho killer you’ve ever seen in a movie.\n\n\tBecause they were mere movie characters. This, on the other hand, is what one of these people really looks like and sounds like. And this is just what it might feel like to be in his clutches. For this is no mere villain. This is a sick puppy who will do…anything. And that, watching “Manhunter” for the first time, was the primal terror I experienced. I felt like I was in that wheelchair, waiting to be confronted with a horror beyond description.\n\n\tI first saw “Manhunter” at a preview screening the week it was released, in August 1986, and I’d never seen anything like it. I still haven’t. “Manhunter,” originally entitled “Red Dragon” (the name of the 1981 Thomas Harris novel on which it’s based; the studio slapped on that schlock title), is rightly thought of as “the original ‘Silence of the Lambs’.” It’s the movie that introduced Dr. Lecter, who is played with sinister impishness by Brian Cox. But it’s an even greater film than “The Silence of the Lambs.” To me, it’s the greatest thriller ever made. And Tom Noonan’s haunting performance is a huge part of what makes it so memorably unnerving.\n\n\tStanding at a distance, we get to know the character he’s playing, a photo-lab technician named Francis Dollarhyde, who lives in an eccentric ramshackle river house, who worships the moon (he’s got giant posters of it in his dankly lit living room), and who thinks that he’s the Red Dragon, an avenger who will “change” people by slaughtering them into figures who will want him. He has been murdering families in different parts of the country. (He travels to them in his van.) He’s an utter depraved psycho. But he is also a visibly damaged, oddly complicated human being. Lecter, tracing Dollarhyde’s moves from his prison cell, calls him “a very shy boy.” You feel that in Tom Noonan the giant shrinking violet.\n\t\n\n\tMichael Mann wrote and directed “Manhunter” with a masterful clinical gliding techno lyricism. He staged a labyrinthine detective story as a hypnotic ’80s rock psychodrama, with songs like Shriekback’s “This Big Hush” and the Prime Movers’ “Strong as I Am” used as seductively as any Scorsese needle drop. One of the ways that Mann departs from the book is the characterization of Dollarhyde, who the director says he based, in part, on a killer he got to know. In collaborating with Mann, Noonan, a New York stage actor (he was in the original Off Broadway production of Sam Shepard’s “Buried Child” in 1978), knew precisely what he was doing, even though he was cavalier about landing the role.\n\n\tAccording to a story Mann tweeted out this week, Noonan nearly blew his audition by getting irritated at having to wait around for an hour-and-a-half. After the audition, he slipped out without talking to Mann, who had wanted to meet with him. They finally did meet, and Mann told Noonan that he thought he was “scary,” and was curious to know how the actor achieved that. Noonan said: by being scared. That, in a way, is the key to his performance. Noonan’s Dollarhyde is physically overwhelming when he wants to be, yet he’s tangibly vulnerable, and the fear he feels is threaded through the violence he inflicts. He lives on the dark side of the moon (the film’s soundtrack quotes that Pink Floyd classic), where he’s trying to fill the void with blood.\n\n\t“Manhunter” is a head-spinning forensic mystery about the hunt for this man. It was really the first forensic movie thriller, with William Petersen living and breathing the role of FBI agent Will Graham, who tracks down homicidal predators by entering their mindset. As he gets to know Dollarhyde through a fantastic jigsaw of clues, and the film ushers us into Dollarhyde’s lair, Tom Noonan takes us into his fractured being. The performance is as delicate as a veil, as cutting as a razor’s slash.\n\n\tI went through a period of watching “Manhunter” over and over again (it’s one of my three favorite films), and what I came to appreciate is that every moment of Noonan’s acting is possessed by something uncanny. The scene where he first speaks to Reba (Joan Allen), the blind woman who works in the photo lab (“Take my word for it. I’m smiling”); the scene where he brings her to a veterinarian’s operating theater so that she can feel the heartbeat of a tiger who’s being put under sedation, and as Dollarhyde closes his eyes in private rapture we realize the tiger is him; the moment when he’s so enraged that he grabs the sheet plastic glued to a dashboard and tears it off with one hand; and the momentous shootout at the end, set to Iron Butterfly’s “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida” (the one rock ‘n’ roll song as insane as Dollarhyde), where he moves his lanky body like a ballet dancer of survival.\n\t\n\n\tTom Noonan had a rich and varied career. He built and ran a small black-box theater in New York’s East Village called Paradise Factory, where he wrote and staged plays, like “What Happened Was…” and “Wifey,” both of which became independent films (“What Happened Was…” won the grand jury prize at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival). He made his presence felt in many films (like “RoboCop 2” and “Synecdoche, New York” and “Heat”) and TV series (like “Law & Order” and “Louis” and the “Paper Hearts” episode of “The X-Files”).\n\n\tI got to meet him once, at a 1991 party for Jim Jarmusch’s “Night on Earth,” where he was nice as pie (though it was still, I confess, a little bit like meeting Francis Dollarhyde). When I told him how much I loved his performance in “Manhunter,” he was taken aback, as if the film wasn’t really all that. But I think that was just his way of being modest. And it was still relatively early in the long life that “Manhunter” would have. The movie is 40 years old now, and my perception is that more and more people have discovered it, have entered its heady realm of saturnine mystery. At the pivotal moment when Dollarhyde is scalded by a delusion of betrayal, he feels the Red Dragon taking him over, and he says, with mournful defiance, “Francis is gone. Francis is gone forever.” Yes. But Tom Noonan’s performance in “Manhunter” will live on.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothée Chalamet has been quiet about “Dune: Part Three,” which opens in theaters this December. But while speaking with Matthew McConaughey at Variety and CNN’s town hall event at the University of Texas at Austin, Chalamet revealed some new details that have inspired his portrayal of Paul Atreides in Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi trilogy.\n\n\t“What I think you see at the end of the second one, and across the third one, is yourself in ‘Interstellar’ and Heath Ledger in ‘The Dark Knight’ and Marlon Brando in ‘Apocalypse Now’ and stuff like that,” he said to McConaughey — before backtracking a bit. “Actually, wait, let me rephrase all of that! Hold up. I cannot put myself in that same boat,” he said, laughing. “Let’s just say, it’s these big movies where you could sneak in something. A curveball.”\n\t\n\n\tOscar Isaac, who played Paul’s father Leto Atreides in the first “Dune” film, was another inspiration to Chalamet. “He treated it in a Shakespearean way — to play it heightened and not really care about it being heightened,” Chalamet said. Watching Isaac encouraged him to take “more liberty than ever.” On the first “Dune” film, “I felt kind of thrown by the futurism,” Chalamet said. “I was coming off ‘Beautiful Boy’ and ‘Call Me by Your Name’ and movies that were a lot more naturalistic, and this was a huge movie, so I felt intimidated. But especially on this third one, all the great shit you see on screen is from freedom of movement and freedom of choice. And with Denis, we really had a good rhythm. It’s the eeriest one. It’s a big swing.”\n\n\tChalamet didn’t say much about the plot of the new film, but he did discuss the sci-fi technology. “On the first ‘Dune,’ we had an ornithopter sequence that I got a chance to do again in the third, but this time I was way more geared up,” he said. “On ‘Dune 3,’ as opposed to the first movie, I came out early and studied the control panel — all sorts of hieroglyphics and things that aren’t tethered to reality. I wanted to know what each button did, and invent a dynamic for myself with it.”\n\t\n\n\tChalamet felt that “the bat was red-hot” while filming “Dune: Part Three” after his roles in “Marty Supreme” and “A Complete Unknown,” which both earned him Oscar nominations for best actor. “I didn’t want to be complacent about a single moment. Everything was sacred, and it was my last time doing a ‘Dune’ film, so I really wanted to treat it as sacred. Because people can get complacent, but I was more intense on the third one. It felt like that was the natural momentum, so I wanted to push against that as hard as I could.”\n\n\t“A CNN & Variety Town Hall Event: Timothée Chalamet and Matthew McConaughey” airs on Saturday, Feb. 21 at 7 p.m. on CNN and streams on the CNN app. \n",

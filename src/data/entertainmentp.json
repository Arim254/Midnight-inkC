    "body": "\n\tQuinta Brunson, creator, writer, executive producer, and star of ABC’s hit comedy series “Abbott Elementary,” will receive the Variety Showrunner Award at the 14th annual SCAD TVfest. The festival returns this year in Atlanta from Feb. 4 to Feb. 6.\n\n\tThe series, which is produced by Warner Bros. Television and 20th Television is currently airing its fifth season and recently received multiple award nominations including the 2026 Critics Choice Award for Comedy Series, Golden Globes for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy and Actors Award for Cast Ensemble in a Comedy Series. \n\t\n\n\tIn 2022, Brunson became the first solo Black woman to win the Emmy Award for comedy writing and in 2023 became the first Black actress to win lead comedy actress in over 40 years and only the second ever to do so. Brunson’s Emmy streak continued in 2025 as she became the first Black woman to earn three comedy writing nominations for a single series. Additionally, her fourth acting nomination made her the third-most nominated Black woman for lead comedy actress.\n\n\n\t“With ‘Abbott Elementary,’ Quinta Brunson has come up with a show that should be considered right up there with some of the greatest sitcoms of all time,” said Variety senior TV features editor Emily Longeretta. “The cast, the storytelling, the subject matter, and, most importantly, the laughs, are why ‘Abbott’ remains at the head of the class. Quinta is the textbook example of what the Variety Showrunner Award is all about.”\n\n\t“Quinta Brunson is a trailblazing force in television, redefining what it means to be a creator, writer, and performer with the groundbreaking success of ‘Abbott Elementary,’” said SCAD Executive Director of Theaters and Festivals Christina Routhier. “The series has resonated with audiences through its sharp humor, heartfelt storytelling, and authentic portrayal of educators. Her ability to blend comedy with genuine insight has redefined the modern sitcom, and we are thrilled to honor her outstanding contributions to television with the Variety Showrunner Award at SCAD TVfest, where we celebrate the creators shaping the future of the medium.”\n\t\n\n\tBrunson currently appears in Walt Disney Animation Studios’ record-breaking “Zootopia 2” as the voice of Dr. Fuzzby and will next lend her voice to Warner Bros.’ “Cat in the Hat” and star in Universal Pictures’ “Par for the Course” alongside Stephanie Hsu.\n\n\tBrunson will accept the award at a special ceremony on Feb. 6, where the festival will screen an episode of “Abbott Elementary,” followed by a discussion moderated by Longeretta.\n\n\tPasses are on sale now at scadtvfest.com. The full festival lineup will be announced Jan. 23, including gala premiere screenings, spotlights, panel discussions, Q&A events and other original content. \n\n\tPrevious recipients of SCAD TVfest’s Variety Showrunner Award include the Duffer Brothers (“Stranger Things”); Charlotte Stoudt (“The Morning Show”); Jen Statsky, Paul W. Downs, and Lucia Aniello (“Hacks”); and Sterlin Harjo (“Reservation Dogs”).\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount Skydance‘s David Ellison is still trying to make its case to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders that it’s the better suitor — after WBD’s board again rejected its latest takeover offer this week.\n\n\tIn an announcement Thursday, Paramount noted the “Warner Bros. Discovery decision not to engage on Paramount’s $30.00 per share, fully financed all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD.” On Wednesday, WBD’s board formally rejected Paramount’s latest offer, telling shareholders it recommended the $83 billion sale of Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max to Netflix.\n\t\n\n\t“Throughout this process, Paramount has diligently and constructively addressed each concern raised by WBD,” said Paramount Skydance, which was formed by the takeover of Paramount Global by David Ellison’s Skydance Media.\n\n\n\tParamount Global did not signal any plans to raise its per-share offer for Warner Bros. Discovery higher than $30.\n\n\tAccording to Paramount, in its Dec. 22 amended proposal and subsequent filings, the company “cured every issue raised by WBD” on Dec. 17, “most notably by providing an irrevocable personal guarantee by Larry Ellison for the equity portion of the financing.” Nevertheless, WBD continues to raise issues in Paramount’s offer that we have already addressed, including flexibility in interim operations.\n\n\t“Our offer clearly provides WBD investors greater value and a more certain, expedited path to completion,” David Ellison, Paramount Skydance’s chairman and CEO, said in a statement. “Throughout this process, we have worked hard for WBD shareholders and remain committed to engaging with them on the merits of our superior bid and advancing our ongoing regulatory review process.”\n\t\n\n\tParamount’s argued that the Netflix deal “contains multiple uncertain components and has already decreased in total value. When announced in December, the Netflix transaction offered WBD shareholders $23.25 in cash, $4.50 in Netflix stock and a share in the pending spin-off of Discovery Global. Today, Netflix’s stock price is trading well beneath the low end of its collar, reducing the value offered to WBD shareholders.”\n\n\tIn addition, according to Paramount, while the WBD board “has not disclosed any analysis to help its shareholders value their potential ongoing ownership of the linear stub, Versant Media, its closest comparable, debuted shares this week and its performance to date illustrates the challenged path ahead for Discovery Global.” According to Paramount’s analysis, the total value of the Netflix transaction to WBD shareholders currently is $27.42/share, given the decline in Netflix’s share price since that deal was announced – implying that shares in the proposed Discovery Global spin-off are worthless under the Netflix deal.\n\n\tUnder Netflix’s agreement with WBD, the streaming giant would pay $27.75/share for Warner Bros.’s films and TV studios businesses, HBO and HBO Max, and games division. That transaction would be completed after WBD’s spin-off in the third quarter of 2026 of Discovery Global, which is set to include CNN, TBS, HGTV, Food Network and Discovery+.\n\n\t“The ball is once again in [Paramount Skydance’s] court,” Bernstein & Co. analyst Laurent Yoon wrote in a research note. A “modest increase” in Paramount’s WBD bid “would likely only trigger another round of tit-for-tat. NFLX seems determined to move forward, backed by a superior balance sheet and growing cash flow — resources that even the second-richest man in the world” — meaning Oracle co-founder and multibillionaire Larry Ellison — “could not easily match.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNew York-based indie distributor Cinema Guild has acquired the North American distribution rights to Palestinian director Kamal Aljafari’s personal documentary “With Hasan in Gaza,” which recently screened at the New York Film Festival.\n\n\t“With Hasan in Gaza” follows Aljafari and Hasan, a local guide, on a 2001 road trip as they travel down the Gaza coastal strip in search of Abdel Rahim, a man the director met in 1989 when they were serving time together as teenagers in the juvenile section of Israel’s Naqab Desert prison.\n\t\n\n\tEdited from three MiniDV tapes that were shot in Gaza in 2001 and rediscovered years later, Aljafari’s documentary “transforms recovered footage into a profound cinematic meditation on memory, loss and the passage of time,” according to promotional materials.\n\n\n\tThis portrait of a Gaza Strip that no longer exists has been described by Aljafari as “an homage to Gaza and its people, to all that was erased and that came back to me in this urgent moment of Palestinian existence, or non-existence.” \n\n\tBorn in the Israeli city of Ramle, which is a mixed Jewish-Arab town, Aljafari studied at the Academy of Media Arts in Cologne, Germany. The now Berlin-based director has taught at The New School in New York and the Deutsche Film-und Fernsehakademie in Berlin. Aljafari’s work, including his previous feature “A Fidai Film” (2024), has screened widely at major festivals and institutions worldwide. His visual arts installation “The Camera of the Dispossessed” was shown at the 35th Bienal de São Paulo.\n\n\t“With Hasan in Gaza” world premiered in competition last summer at the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland. The film — which was directed, shot and edited by Aljafari in collaboration with Hasan Elboubou — subsequently screened widely on the festival circuit, including at the 2025 Toronto and New York film festivals. “With Hasan in Gaza” is produced by Kamal Aljafari Productions in tandem with executive producer Flavia Mazzarino.\n\t\n\n\tCinema Guild is planning a 2026 U.S. release. \n\n\tThe “With Hasan in Gaza” deal was negotiated by Cinema Guild chief Peter Kelly alongside the film’s executive producer Flavia Mazzarino and Aljafari.\n\n\t“Director Kamal Aljafari has put together a touching and moving piece of art. We are honored to be releasing the film in theaters and beyond,” Kelly said in a statement.\n\n\tMazzarino and Aljafari commented: “We are profoundly moved that ‘With Hasan in Gaza’ will be distributed in North America through one of the great champions of world and independent cinema in the U.S. We look forward to sharing the life and humanity captured in this film.” \n\n\tCinema Guild’s other upcoming U.S. and North America releases include Hong Sangsoo’s “What Does That Nature Say to You” and Aleksandre Koberidze’s Dry Leaf. \n",

I have been an Aardman super-fan since the earliest days of the studio, from the Academy Award-winning ‘Creature Comforts’ and original ‘Wallace & Gromit’ shorts, through’ Rex the Runt’, ‘Chicken Run,’ ‘Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,’ and of course the beloved ‘Shaun the Sheep’.” He added, “For decades, Aardman has forged a unique place in the hearts of fans by infusing so much love, humor, and humanity into the hand-crafted art of stop-motion. Aardman is absolutely one-of-a-kind and we could not be more thrilled to be working together at long last.”\n\n\t“We are so delighted to announce today that Shaun the Sheep is ready for his next big U.S. adventure, and Studiocanal couldn’t ask for a better partner than GKIDS to make it happen,” said Studiocanal’s Chloé Marquet. “Their passion and expertise in animation make them the ideal home for Shaun and his very welcome return to the big screen in 2026.”\n\t\n\n\tAardman MD Sean Clarke said, “We have been longtime friends and fans of GKIDS.” He went on to say “Their unparalleled track record in bringing acclaimed international animation to American audiences makes them an ideal partner for us, and we are excited to be working together to bring ‘Shaun the Sheep: The Beast of Mossy Bottom’ to American’ audiences this Halloween”\n\n\tThis latest film continues Aardman’s handcrafted stop-motion animation combined with mischievous comedy and family-friendly storytelling.\n\n\t2026 also sees Aardman celebrate its 50th anniversary with a roster of events and celebrations highlighting the craft and legacy of the studio.\n\n\t“Shaun the Sheep: The Beast of Mossy Bottom” marks the first-ever collaboration between GKIDS and Aardman.

    "body": "\n\tTikTok has been set as FIFA’s first-ever “preferred platform” partner in a deal ahead of the 2026 World Cup that aims to make the social media app the “go-to place for fans and creators throughout the tournament,” taking place this summer.\n\n\tThe TikTok pact, which comes on the heels of the team-up between the brands for the FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2023, will allow FIFA’s official 2026 World Cup media partners to livestream parts of matches, post more curated clips and access special content produced by FIFA for TikTok, while broadcasters will have the opportunity to monetize FIFA World Cup coverage through TikTok’s ad product.\n\t\n\n\tDuring the partnership, which will run through the end of the year, TikTok will launch an immersive FIFA World Cup 2026 hub, described as a “bustling nexus powered by TikTok GamePlan that will enable fans to discover engaging content that brings the 48-team tournament to life alongside match ticket and viewing information, as well as participation incentives like custom stickers, filters and gamification features.”\n\n\n\tFIFA and TikTok will launch a creator program that “will provide a select group of global TikTok creators with game-changing access to incredible behind-the-scenes moments — such as press conferences and training sessions — and in the process give fans unique, relatable perspectives on the FIFA World Cup experience on TikTok.”\n\n\tAs part of the deal, a “wide group of creators” will be able to use and co-create FIFA archival footage.\n\n\tThroughout the FIFA campaign, TikTok says it “will implement anti-piracy policies that support and protect FIFA’s intellectual property.”\n\t\n\n\t“FIFA’s goal is to share the exhilaration of the FIFA World Cup 2026 with as many fans as possible, and we can’t think of a better way to further that mission during the biggest event in sports history than to have TikTok as the tournament’s first Preferred Platform,” FIFA Secretary General Mattias Grafström said. “This is an innovative and creative collaboration that will connect more fans across the globe to the FIFA World Cup in unprecedented ways, bringing them behind the curtain and closer to the action than ever before. As football grows and evolves — uniting an increasing number of people — so should the way it is shared and promoted.”\n\n\t“Football has experienced explosive global growth on TikTok over the past few years, and as FIFA’s first-ever Preferred Platform we’re excited for fans to experience the FIFA World Cup 2026 beyond the 90 minutes, with exclusive content and unprecedented creator access,” TikTok’s global head of content James Stafford said. “TikTok GamePlan turns fandom into measurable business results for our sports partners, with fans being 42% more likely to tune in to live matches after watching sports content on TikTok. We’re reaching the next generation of football fans — particularly younger and female audiences — and converting that passion into real tune-in and engagement at unprecedented scale.”\n",

The dinner and role are being auctioned off during The NYC LGBT Community Center’s Center Dinner gala taking place in April.\n\n\tThe benefit will also honor the show’s creators — writer-director-producer Jacob Tierney and executive producer Brendan Brady — with the Cultural Impact Award.\n\n\n\t“Tierney and Brady have elevated and centered queer characters as fully realized leads whose desires, conflicts and tenderness are treated with dignity,” Center CEO Dr. Carla Smith said in a statement Thursday. “By championing our voices, they have brought queer joy and storytelling to the mainstream media and have created work that affirms and advances our community.” \n\t\n\n\tCenter Dinner takes place on April 16 at Cipriani Wall Street and serves as the organization’s largest annual fundraiser.\n\n\tPrior to creating “Heated Rivalry,” Tierney co-created, co-wrote and directed the acclaimed Crave/Hulu television series “Letterkenny” and the first two seasons of its spinoff show “Shoresy,” winning nine Canadian Screen Awards in the process. Before his success as a showrunner in television, Tierney wrote and directed four feature films, including “Twist,” which premiered at the Venice Film Festival, the Genie-winning “The Trotsky” starring Jay Baruchel and the cult hit “Good Neighbors” starring Baruchel, Emily Hampshire and Scott Speedman.\n\n\tBrady is a Canadian Screen Award-nominated producer, writer and director based in Toronto. In 2023, Brady and Tierney formed Accent Aigu Entertainment. “Heated Rivalry” is their first production for Canadian streamer Crave and has become a global sensation, selling to HBO Max in the U.S., Australia, Europe and Asia, as well as to Sky U.K. and New Zealand. Prior to starting Accent Aigu Entertainment, Brady served as a producer on a number of feature films such as “Giant Little Ones” and “Fitting In,” as well as “Letterkenny” and “Shoresy.”\n\t\n\n\tFor more information about The Center and the gala, go to gaycenter.org.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone exchanged texts on the morning the Screen Actors Guild nominations were announced this week, joking about the outcome after Stone landed a nod and Lawrence did not.\n\n\t“We’re in a group chat and she got nominated for a SAG today and I did not,” Lawrence said during an interview with podcast host Josh Horowitz at the 92NY on Wednesday night. “I wrote ‘WHAT!’ and all her friends were like ‘Congratulations Emma’ and I just do a sad face.”\n\t\n\n\t“Every time she tries to talk today, I’m like ‘Why are you not saying sorry,'” she joked. “She’s been beating me for decades but it’s an honor.”\n\n\n\tOn Tuesday morning, Stone received a SAG nomination for her performance in “Bugonia,” Yorgos Lanthimos’ darkly comic sci-fi drama, while Lawrence’s latest film, “Die My Love,” a psychological drama adapted from Ariana Harwicz’s novel, was not among the nominees announced by the actors’ union. The exchange reflects the long-running discourse surrounding the two actresses, who have been frequently compared throughout awards seasons over the past decade. \n\n\tThat said, Lawrence and Stone have rarely competed directly in major awards categories. While both emerged as leading actresses in the early 2010s and won Oscars at a young age, their nominations have often fallen in different years or categories. Lawrence won the Academy Award for “Silver Linings Playbook” in 2013, and Stone later won best actress for “La La Land” in 2017, a season in which Lawrence was not a serious awards contender.\n\n\tStone and Lawrence head into this weekend’s Golden Globe Awards with acting nominations. Stone is nominated for Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for “Bugonia,” while Lawrence is competing in the Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama category for her role in “Die My Love.” Check out the full list of Golden Globe nominations here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s early, but “Greenland: Migration” is already a candidate for worst movie of the year. I don’t say that because I have some knee-jerk aversion to Gerard Butler movies. I’ve been reviewing about one of them per year for longer than I can count (usually in January, the dumping-ground release period that’s become the Butler zone), and a few of them, like “Plane” and “Den of Thieves” and its sequel, have a pleasing pulp flair. When Butler plays bruiser cops or underworld dogs, he’s got a gruff charisma. But “Greenland: Migration” is one of the soggiest excuses for a sequel in memory. The first “Greenland,” released at the end of 2020, was an environmental disaster movie. The new one is a post-disaster slog. It should have been called “Rubble.”\n\t\n\n\tThe end-of-days scenario of “Greenland,” about a comet getting ready to hit the earth, rhymed, in a coincidental but resonant way, with the pandemic. It was like “Deep Impact” made on a B-movie budget, with a calamitous mood that was effective in a vérité way. But it was also a banal family-splits-apart-and-comes-together movie.\n\n\n\tSo now that that comet — or, in fact, a collection of rock fragments — has hit the earth, what is there left for “Greenland: Migration” to show us? I figured that the director, Ric Roman Waugh, returning from the first film, would find a contrived way to stage another extinction-level event. But no. “Migration” starts off in a bunker, where Butler’s John Garrity is waiting out the apocalypse with his wife, Allison (Morena Baccarin), and teenage son, Nathan (Roman Griffin Davis). Most of the planet has been destroyed; America, Canada, Iceland — all gone. The earth’s cities are wastelands (we see the twisted bottom of the Eiffel Tower sticking up out of the ruins), and if you go outside the radiation can kill you. \n\t\n\n\tYet there’s a place that awaits in Western Europe, an oasis of green salvation like that Whole Foods commune in the last “Mad Max” film. It’s called the Crater, and once the bunker is destroyed by a cosmic storm, that’s the destination that Garrity and his family head for. This means they will journey, with a handful of comrades, from the bunker to a small metal covered tugboat that takes them across the ocean (it’s like a bunker on waves), until they reach Liverpool (which is covered in water). Then they find dry land and hook up with a Nigerian van driver who tells them, “The world is a dangerous place now. People are so desperate they will kill you for scraps of food.” They wind up in the ruins of London in a cramped apartment full of Alzheimer’s patients that’s like one more bunker. \n\n\t“Greenland: Migration” is a dystopian dud. It’s like the boring middle section of a picaresque disaster film, minus the showy kickoff and catchy climax. The characters sit, then drive, then fend off marauders, then come upon the former English Channel, which is now drained and looks like something out of “Dune” if it were set on earth. Butler, bearded and morose, has rarely registered with so little force onscreen. There are two action sequences that briefly wake you up: a comet shower over the woods, and a walk across a canyon on a treacherous rope bridge. But by the time enough people die in this sequence, it’s just John, Monica, and Nathan plodding onward.\n\n\tI think the problem with “Greenland: Migration” is that the folks who made it (Butler is one of the producers) actually think that they’re crafting a serious social statement; that’s why they forgot to entertain us. The film has not one but two free-floating “political” themes. Like almost every disaster film, it presents itself as a didactic metaphor for man-made environmental catastrophe. But the other theme, suggested by the title, is that Garrity and his fellows aren’t just survivors wandering the wilderness. They’re migrants, which means that the movie can chime with the current global crisis regarding migrants and refugees everywhere. The trouble is that “Greenland: Migration” is so dull it makes you want to migrate out of the theater.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn September 2024, Brunello Cucinelli received a surprising invitation.\n\n\t“Emily in Paris” creator Darren Star requested the fashion mogul’s presence at the Rome premiere of the Netflix hit’s fourth season. And frankly, Cucinelli was confused. Though he’s used to being invited to VIP gatherings — from fashion shows to meetings with presidents and kings — this seemed outside his wheelhouse.\n\n\n\t“Why should I go to Rome to see the premiere of ‘Emily in Paris’? I have nothing to do with it!” Cucinelli, speaking in boisterous Italian through a translator, recalls with a booming laugh. He’s seated in his stark-white, minimalist office at the headquarters of his billion-dollar clothing brand in Solomeo, Italy, but his inviting demeanor and slightly flashy burgundy-checkered sports coat lend more than a bit of warmth.\n\t\n\n\t“So I didn’t go,” Cucinelli, 72, continues. “And the day after that, worldwide — from India, China — they showered me with emails!”\n\n\tAs it turns out, Cucinelli had inspired an entire storyline in “Emily in Paris” — he just didn’t know it. Played by Eugenio Franceschini, Marcello Muratori is an Italian heir to a luxury cashmere company founded by his late father, Umberto, and the latest love interest of Lily Collins’ Emily Cooper. When she visits him in Rome, he whisks her away to his hamlet of Solitano, where she falls in love with the way his employees are treated like family and even takes a break from posting to social media to protect the sanctity of the village.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrunello Cucinelli with cashmere goats in Mongolia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Stefano Schirato\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe storyline was inspired by a visit that Star, the prolific TV creator, paid to Cucinelli. Star had been aware of the cashmere-centric brand — which he calls “the epitome of quiet luxury, refined taste and style” — for years, and in October 2023, some fashion industry friends arranged for him to go to Solomeo, a picturesque village 100 miles north of Rome, to meet the man behind it all. There, Star found the missing piece of Marcello.\n\t\n\n\t“I was a little nervous, hoping he would be pleased, since I admire him so much,” Star says. “The surprise was how much the reality of Solomeo and Brunello himself surpassed my imagination. As beautiful as our fictional Solitano is — we didn’t do it justice!”\n\n\tStar is just one of Hollywood’s many power players enamored with Cucinelli. He has been called the king of cashmere for decades, with everyone from Mark Zuckerberg to Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey to Gwyneth Paltrow, drawn to his pricey yet comfy sweaters. Now Cucinelli is about to take his brand to thebig screen. His life story is the subject of a new drama, mixing documentary and traditional narrative, called “Brunello: The Gracious Visionary.”\n\n\tThe Cucinelli brand doesn’t stop at the red carpet: Cucinelli strives to share his philosophy and way of life. Inspired by the ideals of Socrates and Kant, Cucinelli prides himself on “humanistic capitalism” and giving back to his community, so much so that in 1985 he purchased the Castle of Solomeo — and over time, the rest of the village in which his wife grew up — and has since renovated its historic buildings, moved his headquarters there and employed thousands of locals.\n\n\tHis new film is a testament to his love of collaboration. A devoted cinema fan, Cucinelli recruited a pair of Oscar winners in “Cinema Paradiso” helmer Giuseppe Tornatore and “Life Is Beautiful” composer Nicola Piovani to help recount how he went from a peasant’s son to the founder of a world-class luxury brand. The two-hour film features docu-style interviews — alongside his wife and daughters, Winfrey, Patrick Dempsey and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman make appearances — and reenacted scenes with actors including “Love & Gelato” breakout Saul Nanni.\n\n\tTo make “Brunello: The Gracious Visionary,” Cucinelli had to woo Tornatore, whose 2021 doc “Ennio,” about legendary composer Ennio Morricone, played festivals worldwide.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSaul Nanni plays a young Cucinelli in “Brunello: the Gracious Visionary.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Stefano Schirato\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCucinelli loved “Ennio” and wanted his film to be made by a “poet,” but Tornatore was reluctant. “It was very difficult to wrap my head around his request,” the director told journalists at a December press conference in Rome. Cucinelli wouldn’t take no for an answer. “He insisted, as only he can do — he insists a lot.”\n\t\n\n\tIt also helped that Cucinelli didn’t give Tornatore any financial constraints. The film ended up costing $17 million and was mostly self-financed, save for roughly $4.7 million in Italian tax film credit support received by executive producer MasiFilm. \n\n\tCucinelli had hoped to share his life story while he was still around to see its ripple effects. “These documentaries are made after people have died. Some of the ones I’ve seen are of people that I have known — I don’t like them very much,” Cucinelli explains. “They are not as profound as the value of the human being.”\n\n\t“The Gracious Visionary” opened in Italy on Dec. 9 and has done brisk business at the box office, scoring more than $1 million during its limited seven-day run. Other release dates have not yet been set — Cucinelli says he is aiming for the end of February in the U.S. — but the film’s posters adorn the windows of every Cucinelli store. It’s undoubtedly a love letter to Cucinelli himself, and when it’s released worldwide it will also serve as an extension of his brand — his life philosophy wrapped up in the luxury coats and sweaters that got him this far.\n\n\n\tIt’s easy to see why Star was so charmed by Solomeo. Situated atop a sun-soaked hill, the medieval village is anchored by a 14th-century castle — which now houses the brand’s tailoring workshop and signature boutique — known to be frequented by celebrities like Paltrow (who vacations at the nearby Castello de Reschio). Peppered throughout the village are busts and plaques bearing quotes from Cucinelli’s favorite minds, from Mahatma Gandhi to Leonardo da Vinci. From the village’s small parking lot, one can see the vineyards where Cucinelli produces his own wine, a community soccer field — and, of course, the Cucinelli headquarters.\n\n\tDown on the ecru-colored campus, the office is clean and bright, with Renaissance art adorning the walls. At 1 p.m. daily, employees enjoy a meal together in the wood-beamed dining hall — antipasti, pasta al pomodoro, wine and dessert. And at 5:30 p.m., the lights in the main office turn off. Overtime is forbidden.\n\n\tMuch of the designer’s work ethic and philosophy can be traced to his late father, and Cucinelli was honored by the nods to him in “Emily in Paris.” The fictional brand bears his father’s first name, Umberto, and the surname Muratori evokes the Italian word for mason, “muratore.” Though his father was a farmer in the Umbrian hamlet of Castel Rigone, where Cucinelli was born in 1953, in his teenage years the family moved to the Ferro di Cavallo neighborhood of nearby Perugia, where his dad began working in a cement factory to provide a better life. This represented a major sacrifice.\n\n\t“He would never complain about his wages or the fact that it was cold in the factory; what he did complain about was that he was being belittled,” Cucinelli says wistfully. “That really killed me. … You see, human beings need dignity even more than they need bread.”\n\t\n\n\tCucinelli founded his company in 1978 at the age of 25 after finding success dyeing cashmere in bright colors at a time when that hardly existed, especially for women. He barely had any experience in fashion and didn’t go to university; instead he credits his business savvy to the card-playing skills taught to him by his grandfather, the philosophy he learned in his local bar as a young man and the stylistic eye of his wife, Federica Benda, who already had her own boutique when he was just getting started.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCucinelli with his family in Solomeo, Italy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Brunello Cucinelli\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEven as the company grew, his values stayed the same. Cucinelli considers his employees not just workers but “thinking souls,” and they earn about 20% more than the average Italian manufacturing or industrial wage. If one employee offends another, they are fired on the spot. After relocating to Solomeo in the 1980s, Cucinelli gradually expanded, broadening the company’s product line from sweaters to full prêt-à-porter and veering into menswear, a sphere in which he started to “become the new Armani,” notes Alex Badia, style director at Women’s Wear Daily.\n\n\tSince going public in 2012, Brunello Cucinelli S.p.A. has consistently shown year-on-year revenue growth averaging in the double digits, with recent forecasts pointing to 10%-12% growth for 2025 and 10% for 2026. This is exceptional at a time when many established luxury conglomerates — such as Kering and LVMH — are hurting.\n\n\t“He came from nothing, and it’s really remarkable what he’s done,” says Badia, who has covered Cucinelli for more than a decade. “If I had to invest, I would invest in Brunello Cucinelli, because I see that the future is bright.”\n\n\tMore recently, Cucinelli’s daughters, Camilla and Carolina, have placed a renewed emphasis on women’s wear. This is now 50% of the company’s output, which Badia says is “where the growth potential is.”\n\n\tThat’s also where Hollywood comes into play. More than ever, celebrities are the ones moving fashion products, cutting through the clutter in an oversaturated media environment.\n\n\tIn his Solomeo office, a corner of the room is set up like a shrine to the stars who have worked with Cucinelli. It all started when Prince William wore a Cucinelli sweater in his official engagement photos with Kate Middleton in 2010 — their picture is smack-dab in the center of one wall. Surrounding the royals are photographs of some of the biggest names in Hollywood: Paltrow, DiCaprio, Julia Roberts, Daniel Craig, Angelina Jolie, George Clooney. From April to October, his assistant says, the office is inundated with requests from the rich and famous wanting the full Cucinelli experience, which often includes a tour of the facilities and lunch in the dining hall. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe designer in the cellar of his winery, Castello di Solomeo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOK McCausland for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDuring our walk-through, we bump into Cucinelli on his way to a meeting. He’s not fluent in English — though he is taking classes — but his greeting is communicated with a pat on the elbow and a cheerful smile. Through a translator, he offers us coffee before heading to the workshop to proof the brand’s latest couture creations — heavy knit dresses with sequins hand-sewn onto the cashmere. Each dress weighs three pounds and is the result of more than 60 hours of work. \n\n\t“You go to see him, and instantly he treats you like you’re part of a family,” Badia says. “He offers you coffee. He feeds you — he’s bringing mozzarella, pasta al pomodoro. Even his physicality, the way he approaches you, is so disarming. And he enchants celebrities.” Cucinelli underlines that the brand does not “sponsor anyone” to wear its clothes — it’s all organic. “So if Gwyneth or Angelina opt for one of our dresses, it’s their choice,” he says. “We don’t pay them to do that.”\n\n\tJust like the late Armani, Cucinelli personally dresses movie stars — including Robert De Niro, who he recounts does not like the label’s signature style of trousers that taper below the knee to an abbreviated cuff.\n\n\t“What are these fucking short pants?!” Cucinelli recalls De Niro saying in Italian at a recent fitting.\n\n\t“I made them a bit longer for him,” Cucinelli says, chuckling at the memory. “But not full-length.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA view of the vineyard\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOK McCausland for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOutside Solomeo, Cucinelli regularly hosts star-studded events at Los Angeles’ Chateau Marmont, celebrating his humanist ideals with guests like Chris Pine, Jennifer Lopez, Jon Hamm, Ava DuVernay and Sharon Stone — “who will only come if she gets to sit next to me,” he says.\n\n\tCucinelli has also been hobnobbing with Silicon Valley, starting with Zuckerberg, whom he’s been outfitting in $400 custom gray T-shirts. In 2017, Cucinelli appeared at Dreamforce, Salesforce’s annual conference, where he took the stage for a fireside chat with founder Marc Benioff, who sported a Cucinelli pin-striped suit.\n\t\n\n\tThough it would seem that technology — especially the advent of artificial intelligence —directly opposes Cucinelli’s humanist philosophy, he’s learning to embrace it. When asked his thoughts on the threat of AI taking away so many human jobs, Cucinelli declares: “I love AI!”\n\n\t“Let me show you something,” he adds, rising from his seat and striding across the room. Amid dozens of framed news clips documenting the ascent of the Cucinelli brand is a manifesto on AI, signed and dated in roman numerals.\n\n\t“Will it substitute human intelligence? Never,” Cucinelli reads from the document. “AI is born from reason; it cannot include any folly. But creativity is born from folly. Therefore, AI cannot create.”\n\n\tThe brand has started to employ AI-powered smart boards to aid with quality control — particularly in finding flaws in the hand-knit cashmere — but Cucinelli is firm that it will never replace human work.\n\n\t“I think that technology is a blessing from creation, but risks losing the soul that we have,” he says. “We need to strike that balance again.”\n\n\tSitting with Cucinelli is like conferring with a living history book. He casually quotes philosophers — Rousseau, Marcus Aurelius, Socrates — and speaks in riddles as if he’s one himself. A theme that resonates throughout our conversation, and a message Cucinelli hopes viewers take from his film, is that there needs to be a new kind of revolution to take the world back to humanistic ideals.\n\n\t“There is a very strong malaise in everybody’s soul,” he says. “We have now reached a very high level of harshness in how we express ourselves — in politics, in daily life, in work, in family.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPremiere of Brunello Cucinelli documentary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Brunello Cucinelli \n\t\n\n\n\n\tPart of this revolution, he says, should be returning to villages as opposed to dwelling in bustling cities. Though he often travels for work — Cucinelli has just returned from Korea and Japan — he is most at home in nature. Our photo shoot takes place in his vineyards, and Cucinelli makes the short drive there himself behind the wheel of a muddied silver Rolls-Royce. Outfitted in clothes from his latest collection, he stops to say hello to a snail making its way up a statue before expertly posing among the trellises. He picks a wrinkled red grape off the vine and pops it in his mouth with a mischievous smile, urging us to dothe same. Later, he insists we try the mosto, grape juice from the September harvest that is fermenting in oak barrels in the cellar.\n\n\tThough his philosophy may seem at odds with the fast-paced nature of Hollywood, it’s easy to see why the famous and wealthy have been seduced by Cucinelli’s way of life. It’s slow and simple, focused on enjoying the little moments and giving back where possible. When celebrities like Paltrow come to visit, Cucinelli says, they spend time in the garden and pick tomatoes for that night’s feast.\n\t\n\n\t“There’s no stardom there,” he says. “Just normality.”\n\n\n\tCucinelli may have been reluctant to make the trip to Rome for “Emily in Paris,” but on Dec. 4 he had a premiere of his own to host.\n\n\tHeld at Cinecittà Studios, just steps away from the re-created Colosseum, the debut of “Brunello: The Gracious Visionary” could have been mistaken for that of an A-list Hollywood production. Jonathan Bailey, fresh off his People Sexiest Man Alive honor, giggled with Jeff Goldblum in a “Wicked” reunion. Jessica Chastain wore a custom Cucinelli gown dripping in diamond accents and talked shop with DuVernay. Pine, Édgar Ramírez and Kyle MacLachlan looked sharp in the brand’s signature double-breasted suits, and Ramírez told Variety on the beige carpet that wearing Cucinelli “makes me feel like my family is with me.”\n\n\t“I’m clad by legacy, by family values, by tradition, by subtle, timeless elegance, and that to me is very important,” he added.\n\n\t“The brand stands for something,” DuVernay said. “I think about family, about advocacy for the land, something that goes beyond just aesthetics.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPart of Cucinelli’s extensive library\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOK McCausland for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter the screening, hundreds of candles led guests through the ancient Rome set to a dinner space surrounded by 100,000 of Cucinelli’s favorite books. As attendees enjoyed rigatoni al pomodoro, Goldblum and Pine told Cucinelli how touched they were by the film.\n\n\tCucinelli was elated by the response. “I didn’t sleep for quite a few nights. I’m still a bit going gaga,” he says over Zoom two weeks later.\n\n\tBesides telling his story and touting his brand, for Cucinelli “The Gracious Visionary” is all about legacy. Perhaps that’s why he decided to make the film while he’s still around to see it.\n\n\t“I want to promote the culture of our company,” he says. “But it is also a time when I believe that a human revolution can start. And I want to be there.”\n",

She says Ham later had penetrative sex with her when she was just 17 in 2003.\n      \n    \n          Orrico claims her abuse was known to other defendants in the lawsuit ... including Electric and Music Industries label executives Greg Ham and Eddie DeGarmo.

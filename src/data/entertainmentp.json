    "body": "\n\tAfter launching a home-invasion franchise with the simple premise of three masked figures terrorizing a couple on the rocks, “The Strangers” creator Bryan Bertino has maintained his sensibility as a writer-director, spinning other original horror chamber pieces unmoored by sympathy. Now, the horror helmer’s latest effort shows characteristic daring in its detachment. \n\n\tGenerically titled “Vicious,” the film offers a spare setup — a depressed young woman is wracked by hallucinations — with little definition of what is afflicting her or why. The writer-director doesn’t solicit sympathy for Polly (played by Dakota Fanning) or impose meaning on her suffering. It’s a very naked approach to horror, entirely propped up on formal execution. In other words, he risks leaving the audience with nothing. And that comes to pass in “Vicious,” which trickles down to Paramount’s streaming service after being slashed from the studio’s theatrical slate.\n\t\n\n\tBertino finds an ample engine in Fanning, at least. The opening introduces her character aglow in red light, complemented by a narrated monologue, vaguely written but delivered as pure, possibly suicidal despair. It’s clear that something is eating away at her, and that impression sticks in proceeding scenes, with the holiday season shut-in Polly half-heartedly preparing for a job interview and calming down her concerned mother over the phone.\n\n\n\tThese early, somber moments cast a mood, but the film is eager to hold Polly’s feet to some fire. “Vicious” has the devoted attention for its lead that Roman Polanski’s domestic horror classics “Repulsion” and “Rosemary’s Baby” did, but Bertino has a more gung-ho gameplan. Instead of gradually boiling into insanity, the film hits fever pitch hallucinations right away and quickly exhausts itself attempting to keep pace. \n\t\n\n\tThe rubber meets the road when Polly receives a mysterious box from a bewitching, raspy old woman (Kathryn Hunter, the current go-to for that type of thing — and deservedly so). It comes with a ticking hourglass and a series of vague challenges: Give the box “something you hate, something you need, something you love.” It’s an instruction brimming with technicalities, forcing Polly to excavate her most personal traumas. It also leads to some sliced body parts and grimy-looking strangers, who tap Polly on the shoulder for a scare before disappearing.\n\n\tThat’s all disappointing, familiar horror imagery, but “Vicious” gets by on atmosphere for a good while before that. A crackling fireplace casts a dull pall over Polly’s living room, but it’s the only warmth in her stupendously cavernous home. The house appears to exist at the end of the universe, so much so that it comes as a surprise when Polly briefly dashes to a neighbor’s place seeking a lifeline. But when that stranger ends up possessed within minutes, stabbing herself in the face and sending Polly back out into the cold, it seems like no other development would’ve made more sense. There are no helping hands when the entire movie may or may not be unfolding inside someone’s head.\n\n\tThat credo reasserts itself as Polly begins to be haunted by visions of her loved ones. Bertino strictly withholds from elaborating on her personal history — a self-imposed limit that ultimately keeps the film from getting under the skin, but does serve to further emphasize Polly’s isolation. One memorable moment comes early, when another call between Polly and her mother tilts into dread as the voice on the phone morphs into a more callous, sinister being. It’s a trick that “Vicious” is smart to return to, with its scant side characters offering Polly brief warmth before revealing themselves as vessels for the demon haunting her. Fanning’s tensed, squirrelly performance comes to life in these spots, with Polly’s waning trust and fear of betrayal cluing into a wounded self-loathing that becomes the film’s best lasting impression.\n\n\tBut “Vicious” is mostly a numbing slog. Fanning flatlines when left to be a solo show as Bertino whacks her around like a pinball, hitting big, loud scares that seem to keep resetting. As Polly excavates the darkest parts of herself, the film can’t string together a build to match the depths of her soul-searching. The movie devolves into something inexact and thoughtless, without anything distinct to recenter it. It’s hardly a sin for cruelty to be the point, especially in horror. But you have to at least land your punches.\n\t\n\n\t“Vicious” is now streaming on Paramount+.\n"

    "body": "\n\tThe first two movies directed by Bradley Cooper revealed a couple of key things about him. The most essential is that he’s a born filmmaker — not just a good one but a great one. The other thing they revealed is that Bradley Cooper, for all his searching intelligence and humanity, is a consummate creature of showbiz. His entrancing 2018 remake of “A Star Is Born” was steeped in the entertainment industry (arena rock, dance-pop videos, the Grammys), and part of the film’s power lay in the granular authenticity with which it portrayed those worlds. As for “Maestro,” Cooper’s haunting Leonard Bernstein biopic, it told the story of a classical musician who was baptized in the limelight; that he had to keep his private life offstage only threw the luminous sheen of his celebrity into higher relief.\n\t\n\n\tAfter those two visions of the high-maintenance inner lives of artist/entertainers, “Is This Thing On?,” Cooper’s third outing as a director (it premieres tonight at the New York Film Festival), comes off as a deliberately shaggy and casual change of pace. It’s a tale of marital separation and impending divorce, shot in an easy-flow voyeuristic hand-held style, and it’s about two people who are supposed to be ordinary enough to represent the lot of us.\n\n\n\tAlex and Tess Novak (Will Arnett and Laura Dern) have been married for 20 years. They live in a handsome old house in the New York suburbs, where they have two sons who are both 10 (they’re “Irish twins,” as Alex explains). Alex works “in finance,” which is as detailed a description of his job as we ever hear; we never once see him at work (which is strange for a character who’s in finance, given that work is pretty much all they do, but never mind). Tess is a stay-at-home mom, though with a high-powered past that looms large.\n\t\n\n\tThe film opens with the two of them trying to find the right moment to tell their boys that they’re separating. There is no right moment, and the early scenes are about fumbling steps and the tentativeness of awkward new roles. Alex moves into an apartment in the West Village — a sterile place that he barely gets around to furnishing, though as divorce crash pads go it doesn’t exactly look cheap. To mark his new life, Alex buys a blue-and-white VW van, shuttling back and forth between the city and the burbs; he also has his kids over to stay with him. The co-parenting seems to go reasonably smoothly, with a minimum of rancor.\n\n\tBut there’s a showbiz wild card at play. On his first night alone in the city, Alex is wandering around the Village and tries to get a drink at the Olive Tree Café, the fabled spot on MacDougal Street that’s attached to the Comedy Cellar (which is the floor below). There’s a $15 cover charge, which Alex doesn’t have the cash for, so to get in for free he agrees to do an open-mic comedy set. We in the audience roll with this in a way that goes down easy, though maybe a little too easy. Will Arnett, after all, is a comedian, and when Alex first gets up there, staring into the black void of an audience, we don’t really have the feeling that this is a “finance guy” who has suddenly stepped into the existential spotlight of stand-up. Looking confident and relaxed, he starts talking about his divorce predicament, and despite a silent stretch or two he gets off a few good lines about it. He glides into the stand-up zone without much fuss.\n\n\tThen again, the movie provides a context for that. At the club, Alex is surrounded by other stand-up comics, as he of course would be, but it’s not just “Oh, here’s what happens at a comedy club.” The other acts we see are all personal and confessional comics (played by real comedians like Jordan Jensen, Chloe Radcliffe, Reggie Conquest, and Dave Attell), who draw jokes out of spilling their lives out onstage. That this  has become the new normal in comedy is the legacy of many great stand-up artists, from Richard Pryor to Sarah Silverman, but it also says something about our therapeutic culture of too much information. Just as the rise of “American Idol” marked the transition into a world where everyone, it seemed (or, at least, a hell of a lot more people than there used to be), knew how to sing, “Is This Thing On?” unfolds in a society where the democratization of stand-up has spread the comedy impulse far and wide.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s now what people do. They get up in front of a crowd to make light of themselves, attack their exes and enemies, and turn their most intimate stories into laughter. And maybe that’s why “Is This Thing On?” doesn’t feel all that “inside” in its presentation of the stand-up-comedy world. It’s not nearly as incisive a view of what goes down in comedy clubs as the one conjured by Mike Birbiglia’s brilliant “Don’t Think Twice” (2016). Then again, Alex isn’t trying to “make it” as a stand-up. He’s using open-mic night for therapy, and he’s not bad at it — he’s just okay enough to generate some chuckles of recognition and avoid embarrassing himself.\n\n\tWe can certainly buy all this. Cooper, who wrote the script with Arnett and Mark Chappell, based the movie on the life of a British pharmaceutical rep named John Bishop whose marital-separation fling with stand-up was a story Will Arnett had heard about. But even though it doesn’t necessarily strain credibility, the stand-up-comedy plot of “Is This Thing On?” does turn a marriage story into a real-life showbiz fairy tale. Alex, his marriage having disintegrated, feels like he’s lost everything, and stand-up offers him a lifeline — a way to save himself, and maybe to save other things too.\n\n\tIt’s an observant, bittersweet, and highly watchable movie, yet there’s an inner softness to it, a slightly pandering quality. Will Arnett, who has the look and demeanor of a less energized Michael Keaton, is a likable enough actor in a rather mopey way, but he has done a lot of sitcom work, and it shows. In “Is This Thing On?,” Arnett seems, in essence, to be playing Alex as a sitcom dad — sharp-tongued yet benign, lost in his daze of self-interest, with an essential quality of harmlessness that’s the opposite of movie-star danger.\n\n\tLaura Dern, so brilliant as a divorce lawyer in “Marriage Story,” here invests Tess with a sharpness that never veers too far from sadness. We pick up on the idea that the separation has been driven by her, but Tess’s sense of regret hangs over the movie, especially when her backstory gets filled in: She was a member of the U.S. Olympic volleyball team (a star athlete — there’s that hint of showbiz rearing its head again), and she is now bent on getting back to her athletic roots by becoming a coach. She gets together with Laird (Peyton Manning), who can connect her to that world, and in one of those we-know-it’s-only-a-movie-but-come-on! coincidences, their drink, which morphs into a date, results in their heading over to a nearby comedy club…where Alex just happens to be performing! She hears his unfiltered portrait of their marital spats, and their sex life, compacted into one five-minute monologue. But that’s okay! It’s essentially the film’s version of couples therapy.\n\t\n\n\tCooper has unerring showbiz instincts. He surrounds Alex and Tess with friends and relatives — like Alex’s goofy second-rate stage-actor brother, Balls (played by Cooper with a cheesy grin under a variety of facial hair), and his wife, Christine (Andra Day), who expresses a great deal of righteous hostility toward men so that Tess doesn’t have to, along with some friends, played by the likes of Sean Hayes and Scott Icenogle, nattering in the background. As Alex’s parents, Christine Ebersole and Ciarán Hinds are the film’s crowd-pleasing billboard for what even a happy marriage is: affection and empathy, sure, but also two people who have agreed to tolerate more about each other than they don’t.\n\n\tThere are far worse things that a gifted filmmaker could offer an audience these days than a feel-good divorce comedy. Yet “Is This Thing On?” is a minor movie that cushions the agony of a marital split in ways that can feel like it’s cutting corners. Alex and Tess are well-off enough to have a very posh separation, their disconnect hinges more on misunderstanding than anger, and while Alex is supposed to be moonlighting as a comic, the truth is he hardly seems to do anything but stand-up comedy. In a funny way, the film treats even marriage as a form of showbiz. It says that once the demons have been acknowledged, the show must go on.\n"

    "body": "\n\tAmazon Prime Video has released the first teaser for the upcoming “Invincible” Season 4, set to premiere in March 2026, out of New York Comic Con. One of the comic book series’ most dangerous villains has also been cast: Lee Pace will voice the evil Viltrumite Thragg.\n\n\t“Invincible” Season 3 aired its eight episodes in February 2025 and picked up an early Season 5 renewal in July at San Diego Comic Con. It was also revealed that Matthew Rhys is voicing an unknown character in Season 4. \n\t\n\n\tAfter a nearly three-year break between the show’s first two outings (plus an unpopular mid-season break in the sophomore season), Season 3 was a return to form for the show and thrilled fans with its ultra-violent superhero action and compelling comic book storylines.\n\n\n\tSeason 3 ended on several cliffhangers for Steven Yeun’s Mark Grayson, aka Invincible. He survived the Invincible War, where universe-hopping villain Angstrom Levy (Sterling K. Brown) recruited an army of Invincibles from alternate dimensions to wage war on Earth. The prime Invincible saved the day, but Rex Splode (Jason Mantzoukas) died and several heroes were gravely injured. Angstrom Levy is also revealed to have survived by teleporting to another universe.\n\n\tJust as the world is rebuilding, a deranged Viltrumite named Conquest (voiced by Yeun’s former “Walking Dead” co-star Jeffrey Dean Morgan) arrives on Earth to survey Invincible’s not-yet-started takeover of Earth. The two have a ferocious battle, with Mark’s girlfriend Atom Eve (Gillian Jacobs) getting caught in the crossfire. Just when it seems like Conquest struck a fatal blow to both Eve and Invincible, Eve’s powers rebuild her body and she incapacitates the evil Viltrumite. With Conquest defeated, Invincible reveals that he’s going to take a more pro-killing stance on taking down his villains. There’s also an alien Sequid army slowly forming, Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins) is secretly keeping Conquest incarcerated, the battle-hungry Battle Beast is alive and the demonic detective Damien Darkblood is summoning a hellish monster to fight Invincible.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the Season 4 teaser below.\n\n\n\n"

He is up to 28.5 million in total RIAA certified units and has scored six multiplatinum albums, five platinum and two gold.\n\n\t“Vince has been a major part of the MCA family for decades,” said MCA president/CEO Mike Harris.  “This lifetime agreement reflects our unwavering commitment to supporting his artistic vision and providing him artistic freedom while ensuring his legacy continues to grow.”\n\n\t“I’m feeling the most creative I’ve ever felt in my career these last few years,” shared Gill. “I’ve collected a treasure trove of songs and with my friends and partners at MCA we’ve come up with a way to release all this new music. It’s a partnership that’s lasted 36 years and I’m grateful for it.”\n\n\tPictured above, L-R: MCA’s Mike Harris and Rob Femia, Gill’s longtime manager Larry Fitzgerald, Gill, MCA’s Katie McCartney and Stephanie Wright.\n\n\t+ Spotify and BMG have struck a new publishing licensing deal covering the U.S., the companies announced on Wednesday morning.\n\n\tThe two companies characterize their agreement as originating from a “shared interest in building a direct relationship that ensures songwriters share more directly in the value created by their work” and will establish that “BMG songwriters benefit more directly in the growth of streaming.”\n\n\tIt’s the latest in several deals that have brought publishers and Spotify beyond the compulsory Copyright Royalty Board model for composition remuneration. The announcement comes in the wake of Spotify reaching direct publishing agreements with all three major labels – Universal and Warner earlier this year and Sony in September – as well as a recent deal with Kobalt that covers the U.S. market.\n\n\t+ The National Independent Talent Organization (NITO) and Sweet Relief Musicians have unveiled a wide-ranging auction of instruments and memorabilia from such artists as Ringo Starr, Bonnie Raitt, the Eagles, Metallica’s James Hetfield, Jason Isbell, Def Leppard and more. Proceeds from the auction, which runs Oct. 8-22, will benefit NITO and Sweet Relief.\n\t\n\n\t“We want to thank all these amazing artists who have donated their time and instruments to this auction, the funds will be going to two great organizations pushing for a healthier music industry for everyone,” NITO executive director Nathaniel Marro said in a statement.\n\n\tNITO is an advocacy organization that focuses on issues such as the reforming of ticket regulations, performance rights organizations, artist visa programs and radio royalties.\n\n\tSweet Relief Musicians is a 501(c)(3)-designated charity that provides grants to musicians and industry professionals for basic expenses like insurance premiums, prescriptions and other medical treatments as well as housing and food costs.\n\n\t+ Warner Chappell Music, the publishing arm of Warner Music Group, on Wednesday announced a new global deal for publishing with Rico o Muerto, an independent label in Mexico co-founded last year by the artist Oscar Maydon and songwriter/manager Alexis “Chachito” Fierro. The label was helped to launch under the guidance of music-industry polymath Yusim Aladro.\n\n\t“I’ve had the pleasure of getting to know Chachito and Oscar Maydon, and it’s clear that beyond being gifted songwriters – and in Oscar’s case, a super talented artist – they have a remarkable instinct for discovering and developing promising talent,” said Gustavo Menéndez, Warner Chappell’s president of U.S. Latin and Latin America, in a statement.\n\n\tRico o Muerto recently became, in partnership with Downtown Artist and Label Services, the home of rising songwriter Víctor Mendívil, who has previously worked with Yng Lvcas, Ganggy and El Padrinito Toys.\n\n\t+ After being acquired earlier this year by Gebbia Media, Big Machine Label Group’s rock-focused imprint, Big Machine Rock, declared Wednesday that it has entered a “new era.”\n\n\tThe label has announced a revivified leadership team as part of its refresh, the topline of which is now: general manager Heather Luke, SVP of promotion Allison Smith, VP of digital strategy Brooke Nixon and project manager Tara Curran.\n\n\tIt also announced a live event series, titled “Off The Record with Big Machine Rock,” to launch Oct. 15 in Chicago and featuring Ryan Perdz. The first release under its new regime will be a new live album from Sammy Hagar, titled “Sammy Hagar & the Best of All Worlds Band – The Residency.”\n\t\n\n\t“We are thrilled to be a part of the next chapter of Big Machine Rock,” Greg Murphy, executive vice president at Gebbia Media, said in a statement.\n\n\tMonday, October 6\n\n\tHybe America has announced the launch of Hybe Label Services (HSL), the company’s first global organization specifically designed to bolster the growth of its artists in international markets. Ryan Hyeong Woo Noh has been promoted to chief business officer of Hybe America. \n\n\tNoh, who previously served as the chief strategy officer of Hybe America, will take on an expanded leadership role overseeing key business operations in the region. Based in the Los Angeles office, Noh will report directly to Hybe CEO Jason Jaesang Lee and to Hybe America CEO and Chairman Isaac Lee.\n\n\tHLS will provide enhanced support across distribution, manufacturing, and marketing and promotion services worldwide. The division will be an integrated, single support center for all Hybe labels and their artists, streamlining essential services for maximized global reach. \n\n\tAdditionally, Mike Rittberg has been appointed as president of global distribution. Rittberg will oversee the strategic distribution of Hybe’s expansive catalog and new releases globally, focusing on efficiency and market penetration. \n\n\tMark Flaherty also joins Hybe as president of global M&P. Flaherty will be responsible for leading worldwide marketing and promotional strategies to maximize artist exposure and fan engagement across international territories.\n\n\t+ Hayley Williams and Zac Farro have signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group.

    "body": "\n\t“Shogun” star Anna Sawai and “The White Lotus” breakout Aimee Lou Wood are circling the roles of Yoko Ono and Pattie Boyd in the upcoming four-part “Beatles” biopic by director Sam Mendes, Variety has confirmed.\n\n\tOno, an artist and singer-songwriter, is the widow of John Lennon and one of his biggest creative influences. Sawai would star alongside Harrison Dickinson as Lennon, who was married to Ono from 1969 until his death in 1980. Lennon was shot and killed by a deranged fan outside of their Upper West Side apartment building, the Dakota.\n\t\n\n\tBoyd, a model, met George Harrison (who will be played by Joseph Quinn) when she was 19 on the set of the Beatles 1964 feature “A Hard Day’s Night,” and became a sensation in her own right in 1960s swinging London. They married in 1966; after the Beatles broke up in 1970, their marriage began to deteriorate, and they ultimately divorced in 1977. She was subsequently married to Eric Clapton from 1979 to 1989. On Oct. 10, she posted to social media that the prospect of Wood playing her was “big news” and she was “looking forward (hoping) to meet” the actor “at some point in the future.”\n\n\n\tThe deals for Sawai and Wood are not signed, however, and it’s not certain they will be cast. A representative of Sony Pictures had no comment.\n\n\tAs for the rest of the Fab Four, Paul Mescal is playing Paul McCartney and Barry Keoghan will star as Ringo Starr. Saoirse Ronan has been cast as McCartney’s first wife, Linda, who also performed in his post-Beatles band, Wings; Mia McKenna-Bruce is set to play Starr’s first wife, Maureen Starkey.\n\t\n\n\tMendes is making four separate movies, one from each Beatles member’s point of view. They will intersect to capture the band’s improbable journey from Liverpool to the center of global culture, leading to their 1970 breakup. The tagline, in other words, is “Each man has his own story, but together they are legendary.” All four installments will debut on the big screen in April 2028 in what Sony Pictures is dubbing the “first binge-able theatrical experience.” The exact release timeline is unclear.\n\n\tMcCartney, Starr, and the families of the late Lennon and Harrison have granted full life story and music rights for the scripted films, making these the first features sanctioned by the band.\n\n\t“I’m honored to be telling the story of the greatest rock band of all time, and excited to challenge the notion of what constitutes a trip to the movies,” Mendes said when the project was announced earlier in 2025.\n\n\tSawai, 33, rose to fame in Japan as a singer in the girl group Faky before breaking through internationally on the Apple TV+ series “Pachinko.” She scored an Emmy for the series “Shogun,” making her the first Japanese actress to win for lead actress. Sawai will also appear onscreen in director David Leitch’s heist film “How to Rob a Bank” and the Jeremy Allen White and Austin Butler-led crime drama “Enemies.” \n\n\tWood, 31, first starred in the Netflix teen dramedy “Sex Education” over four seasons from 2019 to 2023.  She’s also appeared opposite Bill Nighy in the 2022 film “Living,” and she earned her first Emmy nomination in 2025 for her role in the third season of HBO’s “The White Lotus.”\n\n\tAlex Ritman contributed to this report.\n"

    "body": "\n\tWhen director Simon Stone first read the script for Netflix‘s latest psychological thriller “The Woman in Cabin 10,” it was as if he was transported back in time.\n\n\t“I was really intrigued by how much it felt like it came from an era of movies that we don’t really do anymore,” Stone tells Variety of the film, which is based on Ruth Ware’s 2016 novel of the same name. “The script itself is very Hitchcockian — it’s of a period of thrillers that were made the last time the world went crazy politically, post-Watergate.”\n\t\n\n\tOut on Netflix now, “The Woman in Cabin 10” follows Lo Blacklock, an investigative journalist aboard a mysterious billionaire’s luxury cruise ship who is convinced she saw a passenger being thrown overboard. As Lo gets closer and closer to the truth, paranoia seeps in while everyone else on the ship tells her she is losing her mind. The tense film is anchored by none other than Keira Knightley, who delivers a layered performance as a woman refusing to back down in the face of injustice.\n\n\n\tAuthor Ware was shocked when she found out Knightley was attached to the project, but says the Oscar nominee really got to “the heart of Lo’s character.”\n\n\t“On the one hand she’s got a fragility, a sort of vulnerability, and on the other she’s got a real inner strength — a core of steel and an unshakeable sense of what is right. I think Keira nails that,” Ware says.\n\n\tTo prepare, Stone asked Knightley to watch a series of iconic thrillers: Francis Ford Coppola’s “The Conversation,” starring Gene Hackman; “The Parallax View” with Warren Beatty; and the Robert Redford films “All the President’s Men” and “Three Days of the Condor.” Knightley, who has been on a run with the genre lately thanks to her hit Netflix series “Black Doves,” was eager to take on another edge-of-your-seat project.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m a big fan of the thriller genre, I love it, and all of those films that he mentioned have been films that I’ve just loved,” Knightley says. “So the opportunity to play that lead character — that is normally a man — was just one that I thought, ‘Oh God, this is exciting.’ You wouldn’t necessarily look at me and think Gene Hackman type, you know?”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKeira Knightley and David Ajala in “The Woman in Cabin 10.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tParisa Taghizadeh/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tKnightley says she took inspiration from the “calm” performances of Hackman, Redford and Beatty, while at the same time making it her own by dialing up the paranoia. “You were like, ‘Warren Beatty does nothing in ‘Parallax View,'” Stone recalls with a chuckle. “And I said, ‘Well maybe give me a little bit more than that.’ And Keira finds this extraordinary nuance.” \n\n\t“It’s a relaxed, cool path that they choose, which is super interesting when you’re dealing with tension. That’s basically what a thriller is — it’s how you serve that kind of tension,” Knightley adds. “There’s a leaning against a wall or constantly chewing or constantly thinking and watching everybody else, but actually the action is happening with everybody around them.”\n\n\tGuy Pearce convincingly portrays the billionaire in question, Richard Bullmer, while Knightley’s Lo is aided in her search for the truth by her photographer ex-boyfriend Ben, played by David Ajala. \n\n\t“The one thing I really enjoyed about this story is how claustrophobic it felt and intense, in the right way,” Ajala says. “There was a good thrilling energy to it, if captured correctly on camera. And I don’t mind being involved in a whodunit murder mystery because then we all become armchair detectives trying to figure out who it is.”\n\n\tThe character of Bullmer marks yet another shady figure in the repertoire of Pearce, who scored an Oscar nomination last year for his haunting performance as another filthy rich and ill-intentioned man in Brady Corbet’s “The Brutalist.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGuy Pearce in “The Woman in Cabin 10.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tParisa Taghizadeh/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPearce says that he finds himself drawn to “characters that have internal darkness and things that they’re dealing with themself because it’s just interesting stuff to play.” \n\n\t“More so than playing a romantic lead,” he adds. “I’m not very good at that stuff anyway… but yeah, I gotta be careful not to be typecast.”\n\t\n\n\tPearce will next star in Ridley Scott’s post-apocalyptic sci-fi film “The Dog Stars,” while Knightley is set to deliver a second season of “Black Doves” for Netflix. Also in the works at the streamer is a new series adaptation of Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice,” a text that Knightley is more than familiar with, having starred in the beloved 2005 film alongside Matthew Macfadyen.\n\n\tAsked if she has any advice for the new cast — led by Emma Corrin as Elizabeth Bennet and Jack Lowden as Mr. Darcy — Knightley says with a smile: “I can’t wait to see it. I mean look, you don’t need words of advice. With that cast, it’s a no-brainer. That cast, that book, what could go wrong? It’s going to be amazing.”\n"

    "body": "\n\t“Yellowjackets” will conclude with its upcoming fourth season, Variety has learned. \n\n\tThe Showtime/Paramount+ Premium series, produced by Lionsgate TV, originally debuted in 2021, with the third season airing between February and April 2025. The fourth season will premiere in 2026, with an exact release date to be revealed at a later time. The writers’ room for Season 4 is now open.\n\n\t“After three incredible seasons, and great consideration, we’re excited to announce that we will be bringing the story of Yellowjackets to its twisted conclusion in this fourth and final season,” said series creators and co-showrunners Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson. “We’ve always known there would come a point when the story would tell us it wants to end, and it’s our belief that our job — our responsibility — is to listen. Telling this emotional, wild, and deeply human story has been a profoundly meaningful experience and a true honor for us, and we’re so very grateful to the brilliant cast, crew and writers who have bravely gone on the journey with us to bring it to life. Most of all, we want to thank the fans who have stuck with us through every moment, mystery and meal — the Hive is nothing without you! We can’t wait to share the final chapter with you and hope you find it…delicious. All the best, A & B.” \n\t\n\n\tAccording to an individual with knowledge of the situation, conversations are underway for Lyle and Nickerson to continue their relationship with Paramount beyond the ending of the series. \n\n\n\tThis is the latest Showtime series to announce its ending in the wake of the Paramount-Skydance merger. Most recently, it was reported that “The Chi” would be ending after eight seasons, while Variety exclusively reported that the prequel series “Dexter: Original Sin” had been canceled. Thus, the only two remaining Showtime originals at present are “The Agency,” which is prepping its second season, and “Dexter: Resurrection,” which recently announced its Season 2 renewal. \n\t\n\n\tSeason 3 of “Yellowjackets” starred Melanie Lynskey, Christina Ricci, Tawny Cypress, Lauren Ambrose, Sophie Nélisse, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Sophie Thatcher, Samantha Hanratty, Courtney Eaton, Liv Hewson, Steven Krueger, Warren Kole, Kevin Alves, Sarah Desjardins and Simone Kessell. Elijah Wood appeared in a recurring role, while Hilary Swank, Joel McHale, and Ashley Sutton appeared in guest star roles.\n\n\tLyle, Nickerson and fellow showrunner Jonathan Lisco are all executive producers on the series. Drew Comins of Creative Engine also serves as executive producer along with Jeff W. Byrd, Sarah L. Thompson, Ameni Rozsa and Brad Van Arragon. The series is produced for Showtime by Lionsgate Television and distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution.\n\n\t“Yellowjackets” has proven popular with both critics and audiences. Per Paramount, Season 3 was the most-watched season of the show to date, with the finale marking the most-watched episode in series history. The show has received 10 Emmy nominations in total, including consecutive nods for best drama and best actress in a drama (Lynskey).\n\n"

I'm just happy to be free and I'm sorry for the negative press it has caused my family.\"\n      \n    \n          He adds he's ready to put this chapter behind him ... saying he just wants peace for himself and his family moving forward.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Michael Lohan\n              \n                          \n                Kate Major\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                The Lohans\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          "

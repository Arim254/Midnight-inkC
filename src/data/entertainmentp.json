    "body": "\n\tIt’s been a stressful year for Firelight Media, the nonprofit that supports documentary filmmakers of color. In September, the company lost 41% of its annual funding when monies provided by PBS shrank and federal funding agencies such as the NEA and Corporation for Public Broadcasting shut down. \n\n\t“The total 41% covered a lot of our programming and a lot of our institutional infrastructure,” says Loira Limbal, President and CEO of Firelight. “Some of that money was used to provide mentorship and to create programs and retreats. Some of it was for our overhead, and some of it was for re-granting.”\n\t\n\n\tFounded in 2000 by producer Marcia Smith and her husband, Oscar-nominated filmmaker Stanley Nelson, Firelight Media has been an instrumental part of the doc community, providing resources including funding, mentorship, and creative development. “Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool,” “Freedom Riders,” and “Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple” are among the numerous documentaries that the org has produced and supported.  \n\n\n\tFirelight’s most recent project, “Short: In the Making”, about artists becoming masters of their disciplines,  was produced in partnership with PBS’ American Masters and debuts at DOC NYC on Saturday. In all, 12 Firelight supported feature docs will screen at DOC NYC, including Oscar contenders “The Perfect Neighbor,” “Cutting Through Rocks,” and “Seeds.”\n\n\tTo keep Firelight Media afloat, Limbal plans to embark on a new initiative to reach out to independently wealthy individuals to make up for the CPB and PBS funding deficit.\n\t\n\n\t“It is something that we are very interested in being intentional about pursuing, because I read a statistic recently about arts giving in the United States, and basically, corporate giving is negligible for the arts,” Limbal says. “Private philanthropy is decreasing, and the only area of giving that is increasing is individual giving. So, if the trends are correct, then we somehow need to crack that major gifts, individual donor world and space.”\n\n\tLimbal joined Firelight Media in 2009 and led the expansion of Firelight’s flagship Documentary Lab as well as the launch of its Groundwork Regional Lab, William Greaves Research & Development Fund, Impact Campaign Fund, and the In the Making documentary short film series. She ended her tenure at the company in 2021, when she served as Firelight Media’s senior VP of programs.\n\n\t“I stepped away partly because I wanted to have a bit more time for my children,” Limbal says. “Then the 2024 election happened, and all the things that we are now living began to come to life. The organizer in me felt a real need and urge to be of service in this community in this really challenging, to put it mildly, and horrific, to put it perhaps more accurately, moment.”\n\n\tIn April, Limbal was appointed CEO of Firelight Media.\n\n\t“I didn’t come into the role thinking that things were going to be easy or rosy,” says Limbal. “I wanted to be part of the fight for documentary film. The approach has been to double down. We hear corporations saying ‘Let’s tone this down. Let’s tone that down.’ That is not at all how I am looking at it. Documentary film is not a luxury. It is an essential part of a healthy arts and story narrative ecosystem. And our voices as filmmakers of color are essential right now.”\n\n\tDoubling down meant shutting down two programs – Firelight’s William Greaves Research & Development Fund and Firelight’s Impact Campaign Fund – in order to establish the Firelight Fund, which supports Black, Brown, and Indigenous stories from development through distribution, with a focus on those who are telling urgent stories and using their craft to advance social justice. In all 16 projects will receive money from the $580,000 Firelight Fund. Grant sizes will range up to $50,000 per project.\n\t\n\n\tThe 16 projects selected for the Firelight Fund will be announced on Nov. 15 at the company’s 25th anniversary fundraiser gala at Lincoln Center.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndia’s WAVES Film Bazaar has joined forces with ProducerLAND to present this year’s NFDC (National Film Development Corporation) Producers’ Lab, a professional development initiative aimed at supporting mid-career producers throughout India.\n\n\tThe program is designed to strengthen producing foundations and build clarity of practice among participants. It will run from Nov. 20-24 as a closed-door event for 12 selected producers.\n\t\n\n\tThe partnership follows ProducerLAND’s recently concluded Transmedia Lab, which concentrated on long-form, worldbuilding-based intellectual property design and cross-platform storytelling. That initiative took a creator-focused and audience-facing approach, reconsidering impact not only in terms of reach but in how narratives sustain meaning and community across platforms.\n\n\n\tStoriculture, ProducerLAND’s parent company, aims for the pilot program to establish architecture for storytelling phenomena from the Global South, rather than simply franchises.\n\n\tThe NFDC Producers’ Lab features two tracks: a Career Track supporting producers shaping their professional trajectory, and a Project Track for producers developing specific film projects. Fellows from the Transmedia Lab will attend the bazaar, creating opportunities for curated networking and collaboration.\n\n\tThese initiatives represent a growing emphasis within India’s film and media ecosystem on developing producers capable of navigating contemporary creative, financial and technological environments.\n\n\tStoriculture continues to lead strategic IP development in India, working on high-end properties that address ecology, gender, identity, technology, society and culture, while also supporting ecosystem-building and emerging voices.\n\t\n\n\tAmong Storiculture’s programs is “Monsters of My Mind,” a transmedia storytelling universe engaging with mental health in young adults. The initiative visualizes internal experiences such as grief, anxiety, identity and resilience as “monsters” within a shared narrative world. It currently runs a six-month Comic Book Lab where 10 young creators develop an anthology of diverse narratives with dedicated mentorship, development and distribution support. Over the next three years, the universe will expand into a broader ecosystem across digital, print and community-based experiences.\n\n\t“ProducerLAND has always kept producers at center stage, bringing new perspectives to an industry in transition,” said Celine Loop of ProducerLAND. “As technology reshapes our roles, we’re choosing to be catalysts and embrace what’s ahead. Our partnership with WAVES Film Bazaar brings these vital conversations to the forefront.”\n\n\tWAVES Film Bazaar, part of NFDC’s ongoing efforts, serves as a platform for emerging talent, co-production, story exchange and project incubation in Indian cinema and independent storytelling. It runs concurrently with the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMD Productions has unveiled the first teaser for “Khan Tumhara,” an action drama starring Bilal Ashraf (“Janaan,” “Superstar”) and Maya Ali (“Teefa in Trouble,” “Mann Mayal,” “Diyar-e-Dil”) that aims to raise production standards in Pakistani cinema through international collaboration.\n\n\tDirected by Ehteshamuddin (“Superstar,” “Udaari,” “Sadqay Tumhare”) from a screenplay by Mustafa Afridi, the film is produced by Momina Duraid (“Parwaaz Hai Junoon,” “Superstar,” “Sadqay Tumhare”) at MD Productions alongside Ashraf and Ehteshamuddin at Behive Transmedia. \n\t\n\n\tThe project blends action sequences with romance and drama, centering on the character Yusuf Khan, described as navigating power, love and vengeance.\n\n\n\tThe production employed multiple international crew members for its action sequences, with the team led by Nick Khan (Marvel’s “Eternals”) and Hussain Abdullah (“Skyfall”). The crew traveled to Pakistan to shoot the sequences and trained local crew members for several months.\n\n\tPrincipal photography lasted approximately 70 days for the action sequences alone. Ashraf performed his own stunts without body doubles, sustaining multiple injuries during filming. Ali also underwent extensive preparation for her role.\n\n\t“For years, Pakistani cinema has flirted with action but we have never truly let it bleed,” said Ehteshamuddin. “’Khan Tumhara’ is our answer to that hesitation. Yusuf Khan is not a hero you cheer for from a safe distance; he is the man who drags you into the dust with him where love is a wound; power is a poison; and vengeance is the only prayer left. This is our story, told with our sweat; our scars; our stubborn refusal to look away.”\n\t\n\n\tAshraf added:  “This was more than a film; it was a lifetime education in the craft, paid for with blood, sweat and tears. It has become the benchmark against which I’ll measure every project I ever do from hereon. This journey is dedicated to my late mother and sister, and I am forever thankful to everyone who has been part of this project.”\n\n\tThe visual effects were handled by Haider at Softmatrix, with post-production designed to meet international standards.\n\n\tProducer Duraid said: “’Khan Tumhara’ has something for everyone. A mix of action, romance and comedy. It offers full family entertainment for all age groups.”\n\n\tAli added: “Some projects truly stay close to your heart. ‘Khan Tumhara’ is one of them. From planning to pack-up, I had the privilege of witnessing this journey up close. It’s been an honour working with the finest director and actor, Ehtesham Bhai, and the amazing Bilal Ashraf – a brilliant actor; a wonderful human being; and now an exceptional producer. I am incredibly proud to be part of this film and can’t wait for everyone to experience the action and emotion of ‘Khan Tumhara’ this Eid ul Adha.”\n\n\tThe film’s soundtrack features songs in the Urdu, Punjabi and Pushto languages, aimed at appealing to diverse audiences across Pakistan.\n\n\t“Khan Tumhara” is scheduled for release in May 2026, timed for the Eid ul Adha holiday period. MD Productions and Behive Transmedia are handling distribution arrangements.\n\n\tWatch the teaser here:\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTencent Music Entertainment Group, China’s dominant online music and audio platform, reported strong third-quarter financial results, with online music service revenues climbing 27.2% year-over-year to RMB6.97 billion ($979 million) for the period ended Sept. 30, according to unaudited figures released Thursday.\n\n\tThe Chinese music streaming giant’s growth was fueled by increases across multiple revenue streams, including music subscriptions, offline performances, advertising services and artist merchandise. Music subscription revenues rose 17.2% to $632 million, primarily driven by expansion of the company’s SVIP membership program.\n\t\n\n\tMonthly average revenue per paying user grew to $1.6 from $1.5 in the same period last year, reflecting the success of TME’s premium tier offerings. The company’s total operating profit increased 26.4% year-over-year to $381 million.\n\n\n\tTME expanded its music catalog through partnerships with labels in South Korea and Japan, while collaborating with game developers to broaden its content offerings. The company partnered with Tencent Games to co-produce the Honor of Kings 10th-anniversary theme song “Atlas of Tomorrow,” performed by JJ Lin, which generated over 600 million social media mentions within two weeks of release.\n\n\tThe streaming service introduced a new ad-supported membership tier that attracted free-tier listeners and increased daily usage time. Artist-driven content, including digital albums and collectible NFC cards such as Eason Chan’s “Fear and Dreams,” helped drive SVIP subscription growth.\n\t\n\n\tTME strengthened its position in live music during the quarter, hosting 14 sold-out G-Dragon concerts across Sydney, Melbourne and Kuala Lumpur that drew over 150,000 attendees. The company launched the TMElive International Music Awards, featuring 22 artists and groups from China and other Asian countries, which attracted over 20,000 attendees across two days.\n\n\tThe company’s annual TMEA 2025 event gathered 35 artists and groups, drawing over 10,000 attendees. TME also supported concert tours for artists including Fiona Sit, Tia Ray and Gai, with some performances scaling from arena-level to stadium-level venues.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

    "body": "\n\tField & Stream, the outdoor lifestyle brand whose owners include country singer-songwriters Morgan Wallen and Eric Church, is wading into the streaming TV era.\n\n\tField & Stream and media company Outdoor America inked a strategic partnership under which Outdoor America’s free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) channel will be rebranded as Field & Stream TV in late January 2026. The two companies also plan to launch it as a broadcast channel, with details to be announced.\n\t\n\n\tWallen and Church were part of the investor group that acquired Field & Stream’s assets in 2024. The launch of Field & Stream TV is the next extension of the company’s media footprint, adding a 24-hour television network to its print publication, website, social platforms and podcasts. The rebranded channel will feature “exclusive new content, original series and special programming, offering sponsors the largest combined audience reach in outdoor media,” the companies said.\n\n\n\tThe Field & Stream TV channel will develop original programming in collaboration with “leading outdoor storytellers, top sports producers and music partners” — including Wallen and Church — spanning hunting, fishing, camping and outdoor cooking, according to the companies.\n\n\tField & Stream said it will host a launch event for the channel at the 2026 SHOT Show, where execs plan to unveil Field & Stream TV’s flagship original programming and production partners. The SHOT (Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade) Show, operated by the Firearm Industry Trade Association, is being held Jan. 20-23, 2026, in Las Vegas.\n\t\n\n\tCurrently, the Outdoor America FAST TV channel is available on smart TV platforms including Samsung TV+, Vizio WatchFree+, LG Channels and TCLtv+; and streaming devices Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and Google Chromecast.\n\n\t“We’re thrilled to partner with the Outdoor America team to launch Field & Stream TV with a powerful and immediate distribution footprint,” Field & Stream president Doug McNamee said in a statement. “This partnership allows us to tell more stories that celebrate life outdoors — through new, exclusive programming and an unmatched ability to reach audiences and sponsors across every channel. It’s a defining step in Field & Stream’s continued evolution.”\n\n\tNick Rhodes, CEO of Outdoor America Holdings, added: “The Field & Stream name represents the gold standard of authenticity in the outdoors. Together, we’re building a world-class outdoor lifestyle network with premium programming, dynamic partnerships, and a global vision.”\n\n\tField & Stream, whose origins dated back to 1871, has taught generations how to “hunt and fish, to camp and explore, to survive and thrive in the outdoors — all while leading the charge to conserve and fight for wildlife and wild places,” the company says. Under the new ownership, Field & Stream has relaunched a print publication and introduced a membership community, co-branded and licensed product lines, and experiential brand extensions including a “modern and affordable lifestyle lodge concept.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOscar-winning director Giuseppe Tornatore‘s upcoming documentary about Brunello Cucinelli, the fashion designer known as Italy’s “King of Cashmere,” is being launched in earnest at the American Film Market by London-based sales and production company Twenty-Nine Palms Entertainment.\n\n\tVariety can exclusively reveal first-look images of the buzzy hybrid film, which mixes documentary and fiction and is titled “Brunello: The Gracious Visionary.” It chronicles Cucinelli’s rise from being a farmer’s son to becoming creative director and executive chairman of a global luxury lifestyle brand with a market capitalization of more than $7.8 billion. The film is described in promotional materials as “an intimate portrait of Brunello Cucinelli, a ‘philosopher-designer’ revered for his distinctive integration of humanistic values, craftsmanship and ethical entrepreneurship.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter a soft launch in September at the Toronto International Film Festival and market, Twenty-Nine Palms — a new outfit that debuted at Cannes headed by former Amazon MGM Studios exec Edoardo Bussi — is now ramping up sales efforts on “Brunello: The Gracious Visionary” ahead of its release via RAI Cinema’s 01 Distribution in Italy on Dec. 9, followed by an international roll out in 2026. \n\n\n\tCucinelli, who was born in the ancient Umbrian hamlet of Castel Rigone in 1953, founded his company in 1978 and became successful by dyeing cashmere in “pop colors” at a time when, as he has put it, there was no colored cashmere for women. Cucinelli has said the doc, which was shot in Umbria, will depict key moments in his career, showcasing his passion for Italian craftsmanship and commitment to a concept he calls “humanistic capitalism,” under which every stitch of clothing his company creates is made in Italy and mostly in the area where he comes from.\n\t\n\n\t“Brunello: The Gracious Visionary” will feature re-enactments in which Cucinelli is played by several actors. The image above with the neon “BAR” sign features the actor Francesco Ferroni, while the younger actor in the wheat field (image below) is Francesco Cannevale. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStefano Schirato/Courtesy DDA\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCucinelli is also being re-enacted by rising Italian star Saul Nanni, who played the prince’s nephew Tancredi Falconeri in Netflix’s lavish Italian original “The Leopard.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStefano Schirato/Courtesy DDA\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Brunello: The Gracious Visionary,” which is produced by Italy’s Masi Film, pairs Tornatore with Oscar-winning composer Nicola Piovani (“Life Is Beautiful”). In the past, Tornatore often worked with the legendary late composer Ennio Morricone, who was the subject of his previous doc “Ennio” that sold widely following its Venice Film Festival bow in 2021.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStefano Schirato/Courtesy DDA\n\t\n\n\n",

Escobedo’s father, who is in Kimmel’s band, and mother were in attendance Tuesday night. They were visibly moved by the tribute. \n\n\n\t“There was a boy who lived on my block. He lived across the street and two houses over. He was a little over a year older than me. His name was Cleto, but we all called him junior,” Kimmel explained.  “Eventually, we met and became friends. And not just regular friends. We became 24/7, ‘Mom, please let me sleep over, please,’ kind of friends. One summer, I slept over at the Escobedo house 33 nights in a row. My mother used to make me get down on my knees and beg to sleep at his house in front of him. And I would gladly do it, because we were never bored. We were always up to something.”\n\n\tKimmel remembered his lifelong companion through stories of childhood mischief before explaining how he brought Escobedo on to “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Kimmel said Escobedo was his first choice to lead his band after landing the show in 2003, although he admitted his pitch of, “‘My best friend from growing up plays the saxophone, he could lead the band,’ didn’t sound good.” Despite his reservations, Escobedo and his dad nailed the audition. \n\t\n\n\t“They played ‘Pick Up the Pieces’ by the Average White Band,” Kimmel remembered. “Lloyd saw it. He saw the father and son. He said, ‘I love it!’ And he got up and left. And we’ve been working together every day for almost 23 years.”\n\n\tKimmel later added, “Everyone here at the show we are devastated by this. It’s just not fair. He was the nicest, most humble, kind and always funny person.”\n\n\tKimmel concluded his monologue by thanking the audience. He also noted that “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” will take “the next couple of nights off” in the wake of Escobedo’s death.\n\n\tKimmel had to abruptly cancel Thursday’s episode in order to tend to Escobedo as the musician’s condition took a turn for the worst. The host shared the news of Escobedo’s death on Instagram, writing, “To say that we are heartbroken is an understatement. Cleto and I have been inseparable since I was nine years old. The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto’s wife, children and parents in your prayers.”\n\n\tThis week’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” episodes have been touted as ’80s-themed; Tuesday’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” included Eddie Murphy, Morgan Fairchild and musical guest Men at Work.\n\n\tThat isn’t the first time Kimmel has taken a personal day; perhaps most notably, he took time off as his young son Billy underwent treatment for a heart defect, which required multiple surgeries. (Billy is now said to be doing well and fully recovered.)\n\n\tKimmel is known for his close loyalty to friends and family — many of whom he employs on the show — and given that the situation involved one of his best friends, it’s no surprise that he put them first and opted to pause the Thursday show.\n\n\tWatch Kimmel’s entire tribute below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Trump has said he plans to go ahead with his lawsuit against the BBC after it emerged they doctored footage of his Jan. 6 Capitol speech.\n\n\tAsked by Fox News’ Laura Ingraham on “The Ingraham Angle” whether he planned to sue, Trump responded: “Well, I guess I have to.”\n\n\t“Well, why not?” he continued. “Because they defrauded the public and they’ve admitted [it] and they’re top echelon. This is within one of our great allies, this is supposedly a great ally. The BBC — the government has a chunk of that one, I guess.”\n\t\n\n\t“That’s a pretty sad event,” Trump said of the edit. “They actually changed my Jan. 6 speech, which was a beautiful speech, which was a very calming speech and they made it sound radical. And they actually changed it. What they did was rather incredible. They showed me the results later on, the results of what they did, how they butchered it up. But it was very dishonest. And the head man quit and a lot of the other people quit.”\n\n\n\tBoth BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness resigned on Sunday a week after a report from former BBC adviser Michael Prescott, detailing a litany of editorial errors and misjudgments, was leaked to the press. While the top story to emerge was a “Panorama” documentary about Donald Trump in which two sentences made 55 minutes apart were seamlessly spliced together, the report also flagged concerns about reporting on the Israel-Hamas war and trans issues.\n\n\t“Well, I think I have an obligation to [sue the BBC] because you can’t allow people to do that,” Trump told Ingraham. “I couldn’t allow ’60 Minutes’ — you know we settled that one for many millions of dollars. I couldn’t have allowed that to take place.”\n\t\n\n\tTrump previously sued Paramount over his lawsuit relating to “60 Minutes” in which he accused CBS of deceptively editing an interview with Kamala Harris. They settled for $16 million.\n\n\tAlejandro Brito, Trump’s lawyer, has indicated the president may file a billion-dollar lawsuit in Florida unless the BBC provides a “full and fair” retraction and compensate him “for the harm caused.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe creative team behind “Jumbo,” Indonesia’s highest-grossing film of all time, is reuniting for another family-oriented project.\n\n\tVisinema Studios is producing a live-action adaptation of “Na Willa,” based on the children’s novel by Reda Gaudiamo. The project marks the second collaboration for director-writer Ryan Adriandhy, producer Anggia Kharisma and producer Novia Puspa Sari, who previously worked together on “Jumbo.”\n\t\n\n\tSet in 1960s Surabaya, “Na Willa” centers on an imaginative young girl navigating everyday life in Indonesia. The studio describes the film as a heartfelt story celebrating childhood and Indonesian family life.\n\n\n\tThe project represents Adriandhy’s live-action feature debut following his work directing and writing “Jumbo.” Newcomer Luisa Adreena will star in the title role, alongside Irma Rihi (“Women from Rote Island”) and Junior Liem.\n\n\t“’Na Willa’ goes beyond simply adapting a story, it carries forward the spirit that made ‘Jumbo’ so special,” said Herry Salim, group president of Visinema and CEO of Visinema Studios. “With ‘Na Willa,’ our goal is to deliver a film that not only moves people but also offers a rich visual and emotional experience — one that truly delights from start to finish.”\n\n\t“I fell in love with ‘Na Willa; the moment I read the novel, its honesty and simplicity were extraordinary,” Adriandhy said. “For years, I’ve imagined how the ‘Na Willa’ world could come alive on screen and the way a child sees life.”\n\n\tAuthor Gaudiamo added: “I know ‘Na Willa’ is in the right hands of those who truly love her, and I can feel that warmth in every detail.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film is currently in production for a 2026 release in Indonesia.\n\n\tVisinema Studios has had a banner year following the success of “Jumbo,” which became both the most-watched Indonesian film and the highest-grossing Southeast Asian animated film of all time. The company has also expanded into international co-productions, including “Panggil Aku Ayah” (Call Me Dad) with CJ ENM, adapted from the Korean box office hit “Pawn.” The studio recently collaborated with Pinkfong on a special episode of puppet series “Domikado.“​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe trailer has debuted for Marta Bergman’s drama “L’enfant bélier” (The Silent Run) before it world premieres in International Competition at Cairo Film Festival.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe film centers on Sara and Adam who, with their two-year-old daughter, have entered Belgium illegally and are now trying to reach England. Crammed with other migrants in the back of a van, fear starts to overtake hope. Redouane, a police officer for 20 years, spends his nights chasing smugglers on Belgium’s busy motorway network. That night, as his team attempts to stop a van suspected of transporting migrants, everything changes.\n\t\n\n\tThe cast of the film, shot in French and Arabic, includes with Salim Kechiouche, Zbeida Belhajamor, Clara Toros and Abda Razak Alsweha.\n\n\n\tThe writers are Bergman, Camille Mol, Ely Chevillot and Sacha Ferbus.\n\n\tThe producers are Cassandre Warnauts and Jean-Yves Roubin for Frakas Productions, and Geneviève Lavoie and Richard Angers for Productions des Années Lumière.\n\n\tInternational sales are being handled by B-Rated Intl. International distributors so far attached include Cineclub Internazionale (Italy), Destiny (France), O’Brother (Benelux) and Axia (Canada).\n\n\tBorn in Bucharest, Bergman first worked as a freelance journalist for print and television, before turning to documentary filmmaking. Her documentaires, which explore Romania and the Roma communities, include “Clejani Stories, Histoires, Povesti …,” “Happy Stay,” “One Day My Prince Will Come,” “Bucharest, Anonymous Faces,” and “The Ballad of the Snake, A Gypsy Story.” \n\t\n\n\tIn 2018, she directed her first fiction feature “Alone at My Wedding,” produced by Frakas Productions and shot between Belgium and Romania. It was selected at ACID in Cannes. “The Silent Run” is her second feature film.\n",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIt’s been about a year and a half since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/music/news/dua-lipa-radical-optimism-houdini-training-season-interview-1235945095/\">Dua Lipa released her third album, “Radical Optimism,”</a> a project perfectly suited to soundtrack a pleasant day at the beach. She recorded it during scraps of time on her 2022 tour for “Future Nostalgia,” a record that exhumed the tropes of disco past and mapped them to a contemporary pop sound. “Optimism” wasn’t met with the same enthusiasm as her previous record — perhaps because “Nostalgia,” released at the onset of the pandemic, offered the fantasy of escape at a time when it was needed most — yet it still succeeded in broadening the scope of her pop powers, folding in new influences while refining the bombast of its predecessor.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLipa brought that album to life for the first of four sold-out performances on her “Radical Optimism” tour last night at Los Angeles’ Kia Forum, making for a pop spectacular that never ran out of breath. It’s easy to forget just how many hits she’s amassed since her 2017 self-titled debut — so many, in fact, that her “Barbie” smash “Dance the Night” was relegated to a 30-second blip during the encore — yet here they were on full parade for nearly two hours, strung together like a greatest hits retrospective without coming across as a grab at, for lack of a better word, nostalgia.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAt 30, Lipa is a curious artist, one who clearly attained Main Pop Girl status with “Future Nostalgia” but feels separated from the trappings that come with it. She doesn’t have as rabid a fan base as her peers — her fandom name is “Loves,” in case you were wondering — yet she manages to occupy a space of her own in the competitive world of pop. She’s present in the discourse but doesn’t oversaturate the conversation, giving us glimpses into her glamorous life with regular updates on social media, carefully curating her persona as an alluring yet ultimately unattainable figure.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s why her “Radical Optimism” tour felt so immediate. Lipa was fully present and in fuller command, never missing a note or a cue as she played ringleader to a full band and dance crew. If we’re talking about living the life of a showgirl, then Lipa surely lives up to its demands with at least five glittery outfit changes (fur boa and floor-length coat included), lasers galore and vanity mirror light bulbs flashing on the screens behind her. She embraced the “Optimism” aesthetic with the set, designed like a cresting wave to mirror her much-discussed album cover, and punctuated the most explosive moments during songs like “Break My Heart” and “Hallucinate” with jettisons of confetti.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere’s something to be said about how much Lipa has improved as a performer since her early days of gigging across town at the Belasco and Hollywood Palladium. Her dance moves have been memed to death (some called her most viral one the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PooDad09JEU\" target=\"_blank\">“pencil sharpener”</a>), yet these days, there’s little reason to needle them. She was constantly on the move, flanked by dancers on the lip of the stage for “One Kiss” and strutting down the walkway to the throbbing beat of “Electricity.” The only times she stayed still were to really center the song, standing in a swirling ring of fire on “Love Again” and posing as the nucleus of her band for a spot-on cover of Fleetwood Mac’s “The Chain.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then there’s the voice. One of Lipa’s most significant attributes is the husky tone of her mezzo-soprano, lending a gritty roughness to her songs’ pop polish. Perhaps the most dynamic vocal moment of the entire evening came during “Falling Forever,” when she stood atop the stage and brought out two backup singers mid-song. The music cut out, leaving the three of them to deliver powerful harmonies before the band kicked back in. It was joyous and elevated, the type of sophisticated touch that reinforced that this was more than just your average pop show.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe only time the evening felt like it could have fallen off the rails was during her crowd work. She descended into a barrier between the stage and pit, taking selfies and chatting with clearly starstruck fans who struggled to respond. But she handled it with grace, as she tends to do, running along the lip of the B-stage and slapping hands with audience members as the very hard-working crew members dismantled and assembled new stage setups in real-time.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIf “Radical Optimism” felt like a more measured successor to “Future Nostalgia,” as some fans complained, her show at the Forum may be cause for its reconsideration. “Illusion,” “Maria” and “Training Season” felt just as vibrant as “Levitating” and “Physical,” as if she assembled them all on the same sparkly factory line. That’s part of her charm, that no matter how much she tinkers with her formula, she manages to make it all feel specifically her. That she’s able to bring it all to life and tie such a neat bow on it is yet another testament to how singular she remains in the ever-changing pop landscape.</p>\n</div>",

I apologize,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/vanjones68/status/1974712992085246174?s=46\">Jones wrote</a>. “The suffering of the people of Gaza — especially the children — is not a punch line. I’m deeply sorry it came across that way. What’s happening to children in Gaza is heartbreaking. As a father, I can’t begin to imagine the pain their parents are enduring, unable to protect their kids from unimaginable harm.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe continued, “I’m praying and working for an immediate end to this war — and for peace and safety for every family caught in its path.

He said, “Iran and Qatar have come up with a disinformation campaign that they are running through TikTok and Instagram that is massive. If you are a young person, you are opening up your phone, and all you see is—dead Gaza baby, dead Gaza baby, dead Gaza baby, Diddy, dead Gaza baby, dead Gaza baby.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe war in Gaza has been top of mind for many in Hollywood.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAnd that’s the life of a showgirl. </p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift/\">Taylor Swift</a>‘s “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl,” a cinematic complement to the pop star’s 12th studio album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” sauntered to No. 1 at the worldwide box office with an estimated $46 million over the weekend. Those ticket sales — including $13 million from 54 international territories as well as <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/taylor-swift-release-party-showgirl-box-office-debut-smashing-machine-bombs-1236540485/\" target=\"_blank\">$33 million domestically</a> — represent a massive turnout for a release that wasn’t on anyone’s radar until a few weeks ago.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSwift chose again to bypass the traditional Hollywood system and partner with AMC Theatres to distribute “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl.” The cinema chain also handled the rollout of Swift’s prior theatrical venture, 2023’s wildly successful “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” concert film, which opened to $123 million globally on its way to setting all kinds of box office benchmarks. “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl,” an undisputed win for Swift and theater owners, will have a <em>much</em> shorter theatrical life because it’s only slated to play on the big screen for three days. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was simply a wonderful gift to her passionate and enthusiastic fans, who got to see, on our giant screens, behind the scenes footage and insight into ‘The Life of a Showgirl.’ AMC Theatres is so proud to have collaborated with Taylor,” said the company’s CEO, Adam Aron. “What an honor and privilege and joy it has been for us to once again play a role in her incomparable success.”</p>\n<p>\n\tElsewhere, Leonardo DiCaprio’s action comedy “One Battle After Another” surpassed the $100 million mark in its second weekend of release. The Warner Bros. film, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, has earned $58.9 million internationally and $101.7 million globally to date. That’s an impressive tally for an original, R-rated adventure with a nearly three-hour runtime. And it’s now the highest-grossing film ever for Anderson, overtaking 2007’s “There Will Be Blood” ($76.4 million, not adjusted for inflation). \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, “One Battle After Another” needs to generate a lot more coinage — roughly $300 million worldwide — to break even theatrically against its budget above $130 million. International audiences might be the saving grace. So far, “One Battle After Another” is holding better in overseas markets; the film added $21.7 million from 77 foreign territories in its sophomore outing, a mere 17% decline from its debut. For comparison, ticket sales dropped a standard 53% at the domestic box office.</p>\n<p>\n\tRegardless if “One Battle” manages to turn a theatrical profit, Warner Bros. has been enjoying an epic box office hot streak with 2025 successes that range from “Sinners” and “Weapons” to “A Minecraft Movie” and “Final Destination: Bloodlines.” This weekend, the studio’s horror sequel “The Conjuring: Last Rites” hit a major box office milestone, crossing the $450 million mark. The ninth entry in the paranormal series, which already stood as the highest-grossing entry, has generated a scary-good $290 million overseas and $458.2 million globally.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, “Avatar: The Way of Water” swam back to the big screen and earned $6.8 million overseas and $10 million globally over the weekend. Disney re-released the blockbuster sequel to generate excitement for the third installment, “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” which debuts theatrically in December. Prior to this weekend, “Avatar: The Way of Water” had already earned $2.32 billion and ranks as the third-highest grossing movie in box office history.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tNBC has the past several weeks detailed many changes at “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/saturday-night-live/\">Saturday Night Live</a>,” particularly among the show’s cast. But one of the most important shifts at the program has gone undisclosed — until the program’s 51st season premiere.</p>\n<p>\n\tCredits rolling early Sunday morning after a hosting stint by Bad Bunny revealed the elevation of longtime producer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/erin-doyle/\">Erin Doyle</a> to the top echelon of the show’s production staff. Doyle joins two “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/snl/\">SNL</a>” stalwarts, Steve Higgins and Erik Kenward, at the top levels of managing the series, which continues to be executive produced by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/lorne-michaels/\">Lorne Michaels</a>.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAn NBC spokeswoman for the show declined to comment on Doyle’s new role. Neither the network or the show have made any announcements about any changes in production staff.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDoyle’s overall responsibilities may not change that much. After joining “SNL” in 2009 as a intern and working as one of Michaels’ many assistants, she has risen in the show’s ranks. “She has a palpable warmth and, like Michaels, a knack for dealing with high-strung famous people; she also produces shows for his production company, Broadway Video,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/lorne-michaels-biography-snl-saturday-night-live-nbc-susan-morrison-1236302517/\">according to a recent biography of Michaels </a>written by New Yorker editor Susan Morrison that was released earlier this year. Doyle “sometimes functions” as the show’s conscience, Morrison wrote, “flagging jokes that the audience could find offensive.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBut she is rising to a new level that does not change much at “SNL.” Kenward has been one of the program’s senior producers since 2011, having joined the program in 2001 as a writer. Higgins, who also appears regularly as a sideman on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” has been with “SNL” since 1995.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tHaving conquered the world’s biggest stadiums with her sold-out concert tours, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift/\">Taylor Swift</a> is proving again she can rule the big screen, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tHer newest theatrical effort, “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl,” is dancing to the top of box office charts with $33 million over the weekend. The “cinematic experience,” as the project has been dubbed, collected another $13 million at the international box office for a global total of $46 million. It’s a significant tally given that “Showgirl” was <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/taylor-swift-film-theaters-october-showgirl-1236524158/\" target=\"_blank\">announced just over two weeks ago</a> and landed in theaters with minimal promotion outside of Swift’s social media feeds. AMC is distributing “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl,” which isn’t a traditional movie, or a concert film like Swift’s<a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/taylor-swifts-the-eras-tour-highest-grossing-theatrical-concert-film-1235863956/\" target=\"_blank\"> record-breaking “The Eras Tour,”</a> but instead a 89-minute listening party that offers fans a look at a new music video and behind-the-scenes footage for her 12th studio album, “The Life of a Showgirl.” This is Swift’s second No. 1 box office debut after 2023’s “The Eras Tour,” which opened to a staggering $93.2 million.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“No other musical artist on the planet can do this,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tA self-proclaimed fan of numerology, Swift put tickets on sale for $12, which is above the national average price but below the cost in major cities like New York City or Los Angeles. Audience reception has been stellar (a rare “A+” grade on CinemaScore exit polls), but no matter the feedback, “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl” is only slated for the weekend of Oct. 3 through 5. That means the Swift-induced box office bump will be brief.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“On behalf of AMC Theatres and the entire theatrical exhibition industry, I extend our sincerest appreciation to the iconic Taylor Swift for bringing her brilliance and magic to movie theatres this weekend,” AMC’s CEO Adam Aron said in a statement. “Her vision to add a cinematic element to her incredible album debut was nothing less than a triumph.”</p>\n<p>\n\tElsewhere at the box office, audiences couldn’t smell what the Rock was cooking. This weekend’s other newcomer, Dwayne Johnson’s R-rated sports drama “The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/smashing-machine/\">Smashing Machine</a>,” cratered in third place with $6 million from 3,345 venues. Those ticket sales were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/taylor-swift-showgirl-projected-box-office-smashing-machine-1236534820/\">below projections of $8 million to $15 million</a> and marked a career low for Johnson, below his 2010 thriller “Faster” ($8.5 million, not adjusted for inflation). Ignominious records aside, it’s a blow to A24, which spent $50 million to produce the movie — and many millions more on promotional efforts, including stops at Venice and Toronto Film Festival. Heading out of the Lido, “The Smashing Machine” was <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/festivals/the-rock-venice-smashing-machine-premiere-standing-ovation-1236493253/\" target=\"_blank\">greeted with a lengthy standing ovation</a> and considered an Oscar contender, but it’s unclear now if the disastrous commercial turnout will hurt the film’s awards chances.</p>\n<p>\n\tPart of the disconnect is that “The Smashing Machine” features a rare dramatic performance from Johnson, who is best known for family friendly franchises like “Jumanji” or “Fast and Furious.” He plays wrestler and UFC champion Mark Kerr as he makes a career comeback after battling substance abuse. Emily Blunt plays Kerr’s then-girlfriend, Dawn Staples. Though critics were kinder (a 73% on Rotten Tomatoes), audiences dismissed the film with a “B-” grade on CinemaScore exit polls. Benny Safdie, who rose to arthouse fame with his older brother Josh on films like “Uncut Gems” and “Good Time,” directed “The Smashing Machine” in his solo debut.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt are strong leads who have elevated bigger pictures. It’s not happening here,” Gross says. “American wrestling is a local phenomenon, and that will limit it abroad.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond place was Leonardo DiCaprio’s comedic action epic “One Battle After Another” with $10.3 million from 3,634 theaters, declining 53% from its debut. So far, the film has earned $41 million in North America and $101.7 million globally. On one hand, it’s officially the highest-grossing film of director Paul Thomas Anderson’s career, overtaking 2007’s Western “There Will Be Blood” ($76.4 million globally). On the other, “One Battle” cost above $130 million to produce and doesn’t seem to have the staying power needed to justify its outsized budget. Since ticket sales are typically split 50-50 between studios and theater operators, “One Battle After Another” requires roughly $300 million to break even theatrically.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn limited release, the Focus Features drama “Anemone,” starring Daniel Day-Lewis in his first film role in eight years, was largely ignored by moviegoers. The movie earned a paltry $700,000 from 856 screens, translating to $817 per location. The acting legend’s son, Ronan Day-Lewis, directed “Anemone” from a script they co-wrote together. Reviews have skewed negative (a 57% on Rotten Tomatoes) for the film, which follows the elder Day-Lewis as a recluse and former British soldier who has been living in isolation in the woods for two decades when his brother (Sean Bean) unexpectedly shows up.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso this weekend, Disney re-released “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which swam to $3.2 million from 2,140 domestic locations. The blockbuster epic added another $6.8 million overseas, bringing its weekend tally to $10 million. The studio brought director James Cameron’s sequel back to screens to stoke excitement for the third entry, “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” which opens in December. The original “Avatar” and its looooong-delayed sequel “The Way of Water” each grossed over $2 billion globally and stand as two of the biggest movies in history. Will “Fire and Ash” complete the trifecta? </p>\n</div>",

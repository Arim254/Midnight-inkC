    "body": "\n\tBelgian-Rwandan filmmaker Jonas d’Adesky (“Twa Timoun”) brings his latest feature, “Kwibuka, Remember,” to the Red Sea Film Festival, a drama inspired by questions of identity and the long-term impact of Rwanda’s 1994 genocide. The film follows Lia, a Belgian-Rwandan professional basketball player raised in Europe, who returns to Rwanda to play for the national team and finds herself confronting a family history she never fully understood.\n\t\n\n\tD’Adesky says the project grew from his own experience navigating two cultures. “I wanted to talk about this feeling of living in one place but being linked to a second country, this desire people have to reconnect, to know, and understand.” He adds that portraying Rwanda beyond its most familiar narrative was equally important. “Rwanda often has this image of genocide that is very prevalent,” he says. “I wanted to make a film that takes place today and shows not only that history but the country in general, its energy, its vitality, and to be outside the cliches.”\n\n\n\tAs Lia settles into the team’s world, D’Adesky builds a narrative structure that mirrors her evolving sense of identity. “The film is really built on two lines,” he explains. “There’s a moment when she realizes that part of what she imagined about her past isn’t true. That leads her on a kind of quest. And there’s a resonance between what happens in the tournament and what happens in her personal search.”\n\n\n\tFor French-Rwandan actor Sonia Rolland, who plays Lia, portraying someone so disconnected from the country proved an unusual challenge. “I had to build everything,” she says. “I was born in Rwanda, I know the language, I go there several times a year. But Lia left too early, in dramatic conditions, without knowing her story. She has so many questions.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film includes scenes shot in memorial sites and underground crypts, still home to victims’ remains, spaces that pushed Rolland to navigate the line between the character and herself as a Rwandan woman. “It was confusing. I didn’t know if it was the actress or the woman expressing herself,” she says. “It created very strong, very real scenes.”\n\n\tFor D’Adesky, that blurring of emotional lines reflects one of the film’s central ideas. He describes “Kwibuka, Remember” as a work about how the past and present continually intersect. “The particularity of genocide is precisely the fact that its effects last a very, very long time,” he says. “It remains present somewhere, which impacts the present today.” Through the film, he sought to explore how those repercussions move across generations.\n\n\tBoth D’Adesky and Rolland say the film also reflects Rwanda’s broader story of rebuilding in the decades since the genocide. On the question of reconstruction, D’Adesky says, “It must be rebuilt by the Rwandans and not by someone who’s going to come from the outside,” drawing a parallel between Lia’s journey and the country’s own process of recovery.\n\n\tRolland adds that many audiences still underestimate the scale of Rwanda’s transformation. “People can’t imagine how much it took strength and vitality from the people in Rwanda,” she says. “Through the smaller story of Lia, we already understand the great story of Rwanda.”\n\n\tThe film’s title, “Kwibuka,” the Kinyarwanda word for the annual remembrance period, emerged only late in the edit, D’Adesky shares, but ultimately felt inseparable from the story. “You see the word everywhere during the commemoration,” D’Adesky says. “Little by little I found something poetic in the idea of memory and the journey she makes. The double title also resonates with the idea of double identity.”\n\n\tMuch of the film was shot in Rwanda, with roughly 80% of the crew drawn from the country’s growing production sector, a milestone for the local industry. “It is the biggest Rwandan film shot in the country with a Rwandan team,” D’Adesky says. “At the beginning it was complicated, but little by little there was a real progression.” He says building the project within Rwanda was always part of his intention. “Beyond what the film can become, that is already a kind of success.”\n\t\n\n\tRolland sees the production as part of a broader cultural shift. “It shows we’re able to make films that reflect the evolution of the country,” she says. “There’s a will now to support cultural projects, and that Rwanda is a safe, possible shooting destination.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt doesn’t take long for Taylor Swift’s Disney+ docuseries “The End of an Era” to get emotional. The first of the series’ six episodes quickly opens a window on something that had stayed publicly unseen until now: just how the pop star reacted behind the scenes to the violence and threat of terrorism that cast a pall on the otherwise joyful experience of the European leg of her Eras Tour in 2024.\n\n\tThe debut episode, which premiered at 3 a.m. ET/midnght PT on Friday morning, gets off to a celebratory start. But it does not waste too much time in getting to a mid-episode segment that documents the tour’s darkest hours. In footage shot at the time, Swift is seen shedding tears and sharing profound anxiety in the wake of two terrifying incidents — a thwarted terrorist plot around her Vienna concerts, and a deadly attack on children attending a dance class in Liverpool.\n\t\n\n\t“I thought that this would be a tour I was very proud of. But this is more than a tour,” she says in Episode 1. “It’s a force to be reckoned with in global culture. So never in my life did I think we would have a terrorist plot.”\n\n\n\tThe three Vienna concerts slated for August of last year were canceled after Austrian officials arrested two men who had plotted to attack Swift’s fans. As her shows in London went on as scheduled after that, she approached the first of those concerts with far more fear and trepidation than she was about to let on, the episode shows.\n\n\t“Basically it’s a weird feeling going into these last five shows in Europe because … we’ve done 128 shows so far,” she says in the 2024 footage, “but this is the first one where I feel like I’m skating on thin ice or something. We just had this series of very violent, scary things happen to the tour. We dodged a massacre situation. There was this horrible attack in Liverpool at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party. And it was little kids that, uh…” At this, she trails off, unable to complete the sentence and say that three children died after being assaulted by a knife-wielding attacker.\n\t\n\n\tA messae on screen says that Swift met with survivors of the Liverpool attack before each of the concerts in London. No footage of those meetings is included, but the cameras do catch Swift saying she will stop crying and become stoic in time to meet the families.\n\n\t“It’s gonna be fine, because when I meet them, I’m not gonna do this. I swear to God, I’m not gonna do this,” she vows. “I’m gonna be smiling.”\n\n\tWhich is an attitude she took into doing the concerts themselves. “Any of this gets out of the way before you ever go upstage. You lock it off for three and a half hours. They don’t have to worry about you. It’s like you’re a pilot flying the plane. And if you were like, ‘Ooh, there’s turbulence up ahead; I don’t know if we’re actually gonna land in Dallas; I’m gonna try hard, but I don’t know if I can actually figure out how to land through this turbulence,’ everyone on the plane’s gonna freak out.” She knows how to navigate a crowd through the friendly skies. “You just have to have a calm, cool, collected tone of, ‘We will be landing in in Dallas at 6:05 p.m. Got a little tubulence up ahead, but it’s nothing we haven’t seen before. Just keep your seat belts fastened and welcome to the Eras Tour.”\n\n\tSwift is seen in the episode getting some help through the buddy system, as Ed Sheeran lifts her spirits and confidence when he arrives to practice a version of their duet “Everything Has Changed,” performed on the first night in London.\n\n\t“It’s very cool that he would come and do this,” she says, “because I think it’s just gonna really delight people, in a moment when a lot of the fans need a pick-me-up, because I know I do.”\n\n\tSwift also gets a pep talk from her mother, Andrea Swift, after admitting that she is “twitchy and fidgety” and her hands are shaky going into the first London gig. After getting through it, she is exultant and, as she puts it, ready to stay back on the horse.\n\n\tBy the end of Episode 1, she is back to being focused on the “euphoria” she sees in her crowds — and the intra-audience visual communication she witnesses from the stage. “There’s so many hundreds of moments of individual eye contact throughout the course of the show. I see the mass quantities of joy that everyone’s feeling. What’s interesting is, there’s some joy in the show, but there’s a lot of emotions in this that aren’t just like ‘Put on your smiley face and come to the Eras Tour.’ It is so much more. You look out in the crowd and these are millions of stories and all these counter-narratives, all colliding in one place where we feel safe to be demonstrative about a whole spectrum of emotion. That stuff is really powerful.\n\t\n\n\t“Life contains multitudes and we are kind of exploring all of the dramatic edges of those things” in the concerts, she believes. “That’s what might be unlocking feelings of joy… feelings of euphoria… and it still gets me. It does.”\n\n\tThe second episode, which is also premiering Friday morning, focuses on more consistently upbeat subject matter, like the creation and execution of the tour’s original choreography and especially a “Tortured Poets Department” segment that was added after that surprise album came out in the spring of 2024.\n\n\tEpisode 2 also spends much more time apart from Swift herself to meet with some of the celebrated members of her Eras Tour team, including choreographer Mandy Moore and fan-beloved dancer Kameron Saunders. (Look for Variety’s coming review of the first two episodes.)\n\n\tSwift premiered these episodes at a morning screening in New York City Tuesday morning, attended by her family and dancers and a handful of members of the media.\n\n\t“It was a year ago yesterday that we played the last show of the Eras Tour,” Swift said in briefly introducing Tuesday’s screening. “It feels insane. I know it does for me… It feels like the Eras Tour was a lifetime within my life, so it’s so crazy to square it with it ending a year ago. And with that said, you know, I think since I started performing when I was 14 years old, I have been obsessed with the idea of trying to learn how to entertain people… All the lessons that I learned over 20-plus years are what it ended up being… And I know that’s the case with not just me, but the dancers and the band and the backing vocalists and our lighting and technical departments and our choreography; everything that went into this was all the lessons we’ve learned all of our lives.”\n\n\tShe continued, “And I think one thing that our amazing directors, Don Argott and Sheena Joyce, who are here did was that they told and expanded upon the stories of not just me, but everyone who was a part of this and their stories and what it took to get them to the place where they’ve learned the lessons that it took to get them on that stage to execute this as well as they did.\n\n\t“But there’s a lot of magic and mystery and destiny and all that stuff,” Swift added. “We can’t explain what happens when something goes as well as this did, but anything that we can explain to you about how we did it, these amazing directors did that. And so I’m so grateful that they put so much time and thought and care into this docuseries.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter Tuesday’s screening of the two episodes concluded, Swift quickly stepped out in the screening room and began making some closing remarks, before being reminded that she was speaking off-mic and not audible to everyone scattered throughout the large screening room at Disney. “I’ve been off tour for a year and I forgot about what microphones do,” she quipped.\n\n\tThe six episodes of “The End of an Era” are being released two at a time in one-week intervals. Episodes 3 and 4, which have not screened, will come out on Disney+ Dec. 19, and the final two will debut Dec. 26.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Red Sea Film Festival closed its fifth edition on Thursday night with a star-studded awards ceremony in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia that saw Akio Fujimoto’s “Lost Land” take home the festival’s top honor, the Golden Yusr for Best Feature Film. The ceremony opened with honorary awards given to Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, Darren Aronofsky and Saudi director Ahd Kamel (“My Driver and I”), with Johnny Depp and Shailene Woodley among the star guests in attendance.\n\t\n\n\t“Lost Land,” the first Rohingya-language feature, follows two young siblings fleeing persecution in Myanmar on a perilous journey to join an uncle in Malaysia. Presenting the Golden Yusr to Fujimoto, Sean Baker, head of the feature jury, said the film “confronts the plight of displaced children with unflinching empathy and poetic urgency.” Top honors also came with a $100,000 cash prize. The film had its world premiere in the Horizons section at Venice this year, where it was awarded the Special Jury Prize.\n\n\n\tThe Silver Yusr for Feature Film went to Palestinian director Cherien Dabis’ “All That’s Left of You.” Jurors said the film “reminds us of our shared humanity with extraordinary tenderness,” calling it “a deeply life-affirming film that moved us profoundly.” The feature traces three generations of a Palestinian family marked by displacement that never loses hope of returning to their ancestral home. Accepting, Dabis called the film’s very existence “an act of resistance.” The Silver Yusr comes with a $30,000 prize.\n\n\tBaker, who presided over the jury that included Riz Ahmed, Naomie Harris, Olga Kurylenko and Nadine Labaki, said the slate of films had themes that “felt urgent and resonant.”\n\t\n\n\tJuliette Binoche earned the Al Sharq Award for Best Documentary for “IN-I: IN MOTION,” marking the Oscar-winner’s first turn as a director. Binoche, who was in Jeddah last week, but wasn’t at the closing, sent remarks crediting the festival for encouraging her new craft.\n\n\tSeo Su-Bin won Best Actress for “The World of Love,” with Kurylenko noting her “remarkable depth that left the jury heartbroken.” George Khabbaz took Best Actor for “Yunan,” with Ahmed praising a performance that “mesmerized us … digging deep to inhabit a lived experience.” The film also nabbed the best director prize of $10,000 for Ameer Fakher Eldon.\n\n\tCyril Aris won Best Screenplay for “A Sad and Beautiful World,” a full circle moment for a project developed in the festival’s Red Sea Labs, with a prize of $10,000.\n\n\tThe Yusr for Cinematic Achievement went to “Nighttime Sounds,” directed by Zhang Zhongchen.\n\n\tSaudi standout “Hijra” by Shahad Ameen won both the Yusr Jury Prize and the Film AlUla Best Saudi Film Award. Harris said of the film, “It illuminates a community and journey that rarely take center stage. Cinema’s power to challenge and to heal is evident here.”\n\n\tIn the shorts competition, the Golden Yusr for Best Short Film and its $25,000 accompanying prize was awarded to “Coyotes” by Said Zagha, while the Silver Yusr went to “Empty Lands” from Egyptian filmmaker Karim Eldon Elalfy. The award comes with a $12,500 cash prize. Jorj Abou Mhaya’s “Jeem 1983” received a Special Mention.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Matlock” is undergoing some changes. \n\n\tIn early October, David Del Rio, who portrays associate Billy Martinez, was removed from the set and fired after a sexual assault allegation. Season 2 was already in production when the incident occurred, and Del Rio had already filmed seven episodes. “Prior Bad Acts,” which aired on Dec. 4, marked his final appearance, showrunner Jennie Snyder Urman confirms to Variety.\n\n\n\tThat episode ended with Billy telling his pregnant girlfriend, “I do want to get married,” an odd-sounding line that appeared to have been mashed together later. While Snyder Urman didn’t confirm that was the case, she said, “I’ll just say there were creative changes that we had to make, and we made them. We’re ending up in a different place than what our plans were, but we really stopped and tried to think about how we can have an exit that makes sense in the world of our show and for the character.”\n\t\n\n\tDuring the Dec. 11 midseason finale, Sarah (Leah Lewis) reveals Billy has taken a personal day from work, then later learns his pregnant girlfriend has had a miscarriage. “His exit will be explained in the course of the next two episodes, and it is really in line with the character and in line with what’s happening with the firm at large,” Snyder Urman says. “We want to remain true to the character.”\n\n\tWhile Snyder Urman said she’s “not able to discuss the events” surrounding the allegations made against Del Rio that led to his firing, she added: “We just sort of plugged in and kept moving forward. We’re just all happy to be back, and focused on the work. I think that’s the thing — we want the show to be great. We want it to be joyful for the audience to watch.”\n\t\n\n\tThough Lewis has never confirmed her involvement with the allegations, after the news broke that Del Rio had been fired, she shared a message via Instagram in which she wrote, “Mom is here, we’re moving forward in love and strength. I’m in good hands. Thank you to everybody for any kind of support and care. Truly, we’re moving forward in strength. Key word, strength. Please, let that be the takeaway.” Del Rio’s wife, in turn, posted and deleted a photo of her and her own mom with text that read, “Mom is here. We’re moving forward in love and strength after what Leah did to our family. Thank you all for the love and support!”\n\n\tOn the show, Lewis’ character is facing a tough road ahead in Season 2, having been she was removed from Olympia’s (Skye P. Marshall) team during the midseason finale after lying to her boss. Plus, the merger is moving full steam ahead, which means no one’s jobs are safe. One positive note? Olympia and Matty (Kathy Bates) are finally back on the same team again.\n\n\t“That relationship is just everything to me,” Snyder Urman said of Matty and Olympia. “If I could headline the back half of the season, it’s joy, because we have so much fun coming in with some new characters, some returning, and then we start flipping cards left and right. There’s a certain amount of joy that that brings, in terms of telling the story and getting answers. And then we get to have Matty and Olympia working together — this intergenerational friendship that was unexpected, but means everything to them both. They look at all these obstacles, but work on them together, which to me is a relief, because I hate writing them in conflict.”\n\n\tPlus, two new characters will be introduced in the back half of Season 2: Sarah Wright Olsen as Gwen, an efficiency expert analyzing the firm; and Henry Haber as Hunter, a younger associate and “total bro.”\n\n\t“Matlock” returns to CBS with new episodes on Thursday, Feb. 26.\n",

    "description": "\n\tBandai Namco Entertainment announced the next installment in its beloved flight-shooter franchise “Ace Combat” Thursday to much fanfare during the 2",
    "body": "\n\tBandai Namco Entertainment announced the next installment in its beloved flight-shooter franchise “Ace Combat” Thursday to much fanfare during the 2025 Game Awards.\n\n\tTitled “Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve,” the game takes place after the events of “Ace Combat 7” and before “Ace Combat 3.” The title will debut in 2026 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S and for PC via Steam.\n\n\tBefore the show, Bandai Namco Entertainment CEO Nao Udagawa gave Variety a sneak peek at the new game, “Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve,” and some updates on A24’s upcoming “Elden Ring” movie (Disney vet Peter Rice has joined the project) and her overall strategy since taking the helm at the Bandai video game studio.\n\t\n\n\t“The graphics are something that we really, really leaned into heavy for ‘Ace Combat 8’ and visual expression of the sky itself,” Udagawa said. “I think of how the clouds are shown and rendered — I would get different development updates and the developer would show me what the progress is, and every time, wow the sky and the clouds, it’s so amazing, and how it ties into the weather change as well. So I think that’s something the fans are going to really And it is a franchise IP, so certainly the gameplay, I think the fans can know what to expect, so keeping everything that worked really well, but we’re really adding value in the story and the narrative and the sort of cinematic presentation of how it’s delivered. It’s gonna feel like this epic movie that you’ll want to see on a big screen.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBandai Namco Entertainment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBandai Namco Entertainment\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPer Bandai Namco’s description for “Ace Combat 8,” “You’re a fighter pilot, adrift at sea in a rescue boat until the outdated aircraft carrier, Endurance, pulls you aboard. Your homeland’s navy is shattered. The aging vessel, its decks crowded with refugees, has already retreated far from the front lines. It’s July 2029. The Federation of Central Usea (FCU) has fallen under a lightning invasion by the Republic of Sotoa. Most of the nation is occupied, the military is scattered, and the Endurance is just one fragment of what remains. On this ship, you’re given a single name: “Wings of Theve.” A legendary ace, a symbol of hope, a name tied to Theve, the FCU capital. But that legend was a lie, mere propaganda—a story to keep morale alive. Now, you must carry that name and take to the skies again. With three new comrades at your side, fight to reclaim your lost homeland.”\n\t\n\n\tFor development on the new game, Bandai Namco Entertainment launched new studio Bandai Namco Aces, so that the “Ace Combat” franchise team could operate as their own business with one targeted IP focus.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“One thing that I’m looking at right now is really the speed and cycles of development that we have,” Udagawa (who has retained her Chief Pac-Man Officer title since being promoted to the company’s overall CEO in 2021) said about her strategy for Bandai Namco’s game studios. “I think it’s great that we’re developing internally and having these discussions to improve the quality of the experience, but at the end of the day, until something reaches the market, the fans aren’t going to be able to get their hands on it. So translating all of these discussions and healthy development into output quicker is something that I’m looking at while maintaining the quality.”\n\n\tBack in the spring, Bandai Namco Entertainment revealed it is working on a film adaptation of its “Elden Ring” game franchise with A24 and director Alex Garland. Little has been said about the project since, but Udagawa can now share the Hollywood vet Peter Rice has joined the project.\n\n\t“Development right now is steady in terms of the project at the moment and catch, yeah, so we have A24 helming up the project with Alex Garland and Peter Rice — a lot of very well-known names and heavy hitters in the film industry,” Udagawa said. “So we’re very excited right now about how it’s going to shape up. But I think that’s kind of where the development and pre-production is.”\n\n\tAs for what aspect of the “Elden Ring” franchise the movie will focus on, Udagawa can only reveal that the focus for her is on pleasing fans.\n\n\t“Our first priority is really the ‘Elden Ring’ fans, so the fans who have supported the franchise for so long, making it sure that they feel like it’s a great movie and a great experience,” Udagawa said. “And for those who have perhaps not been exposed to the game yet and have seen the film, for them, maybe [thinking,] I’ll try the game to see the world and the perspective from multiple angles and experience it that way.”\n\n\tWatch the teaser for “Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmazon Game Studios and Crystal Dynamics revealed a first look at their highly anticipated new “Tomb Raider” game Thursday during The Game Awards — and announced a remake of the original 1996 “Tomb Raider” title will be launching next year.\n\n\tLaunching in 2027, “Tomb Raider: Catalyst” is a new title from Amazon, which will be preceded by reimagining “Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis” next year. Actress Alix Wilton Regan is the voice and motion-capture star portraying Lara Croft in both games. (“Dragon Age: Inquisition,” “Cyberpunk 2077” and “Mass Effect 3”).\n\t\n\n\tPer Amazon Game Studios and Crystal Dynamics’ description for “Catalyst,” the game “marks a bold direction for the series as Lara Croft embarks on a new adventure across Northern India.” “Tomb Raider: Catalyst is set in the wake of a mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened the mysterious forces that guard them. When the most notorious treasure hunters from around the world descend on the region, Lara races to uncover the truth buried beneath the fractured landscape and stop those who would use its power for their own gain. As the ancient world collides with the present, Lara must decide who to trust among rivals and allies to prevent a catastrophe and protect a secret that could reshape the future.”\n\n\n\t“Tomb Raider: Catalyst” is set to launch in 2027 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam.\n\n\tBefore “Catalyst” releases, Amazon Game Studios, Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog will launch “Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis,” which is described as “a modern reimagining of Lara Croft’s genre-defining 1996 debut.” \n\t\n\n\t“Developed in partnership between Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog, the game features stunning visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5, modern game design, and new surprises that honor the spirit and atmosphere of the original game,” Amazon said in a press release announcing the game Thursday during The Game Awards. “As Lara Croft, players will harness their wits and athleticism to explore exotic locations lost to time, traverse treacherous landscapes, solve deadly contraptions, and face lethal predators in their quest for the scattered pieces of the Scion—an artifact of immeasurable power.”\n\n\t“Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis” will launch in 2026 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam.\n\n\tBoth games are being developed as Amazon is also prepping a new live-action “Tomb Raider” TV series starring Sophie Turner as Lara Croft.\n\n\t“The two games we announced at The Game Awards and the TV series from Amazon MGM Studios are being developed in parallel; they share a core DNA but each project is making choices that are correct for its medium,” Crystal Dynamics head of studio Scot Amos told Variety. “For now, we’re focused on the games and will have more details to share on Legacy of Atlantis and Catalyst next year.”\n\n\tRegarding the development timeline for the two games, Amos said: “We have two parallel and powerful development teams inside of Fellowship Entertainment, complementing each other yet each owning their respective game, whether that’s Catalyst or Legacy of Atlantis. We are connected by shared technologies and gameplay systems where it makes sense, and by a shared leadership group who oversees the creative alignment and ensures all things are within the Tomb Raider canon. Our partnership with Flying Wild Hog on Legacy of Atlantis has been incredible—they truly feel like a parallel Crystal Dynamics team. This development approach means Legacy of Atlantis can arrive in 2026 to celebrate that meaningful 30th anniversary milestone, while Catalyst follows in 2027 with the scope and ambition that game requires.”\n\n\tWatch the teasers for both games below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBlizzard gave “Diablo” franchise fans what they’ve all been waiting years for Thursday during The 2025 Game Awards: the addition of the Paladin class to “Diablo IV,” followed by the upcoming release of “Lord of Hatred” expansion next April.\n\n\tPer the developer’s description for the Paladin: “The Paladin is Sanctuary’s quintessential holy warrior: a sword-and-shield champion empowered not only by faith, but by the Light itself. More than mere armored knights, Paladins are forged as holy conduits. When their unwavering devotion joins with the Light, the two become an unstoppable force against the darkness. Built on beloved mechanics that have shaped the Paladin identity, the class brings forth iconic abilities with fresh, new skills. Classic skills like Auras, Blessed Hammer, Blessed Shield, and Zeal return with a revitalized feel that blends Diablo II nostalgia with the visceral combat and grounded visual style of Diablo IV. Where Crusaders embody martial might, the Paladin leans fully into divine power.”\n\t\n\n\tBut Blizzard was far from the only video game developer to make a big splash with an announcement during The Game Awards, where many a new title, release date reveal and new teaser debuted. See more announcements from the 2025 Game Awards below.\n\n\t\n\t\tHIGHGUARD \t\n\n\tWild Entertainment has unveiled “Highguard,” a free-to-play PvP raid shooter launching Jan. 26, 2026.\n\n\tAn official description reads, “Players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.

Evan Peters (“American Horror Story,” “X-Men: Days of Future Past”) provides the voice and live-action performance for Bradley.\n\n\tWatch the trailer below. \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEXODUS \t\n\n\tWizards of the Coast and Archetype Entertainment have released a new trailer for “Exodus,” providing the most detailed look yet at Jun Aslan — the next hero of the sci-fi RPG.

Orlev, portrayed by Academy Award–winning actor Matthew McConaughey in his first-ever video game role.”\n\n\tWatch the trailer below. \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWARLOCK: DUNGEONS & DRAGONS \t\n\n\t“Warlock: Dungeons & Dragons,” developed by Invoke Studios, is a single-player, third-person action-adventure that takes players into a dark-fantasy open world inspired by “Dungeons & Dragons.” “The game places players in the role of Kaatri, a veteran warrior who makes a pact to wield otherworldly magic against dark powers,” according to a press release. \n\n\t“Warlock” is currently in development for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox.

    "body": "\n\tThe long-awaited sequel to the critically acclaimed, multi-award-winning video game “Control“ will debut in 2026 according to developer Remedy Entertainment. Formerly known as Control 2 or Codename Heron, the follow-up now has an official title: “Control Resonant.” \n\n\tThe continuation of the “Control” universe sets players back in the same supernatural New York setting as the first. Though this time with the main protagonist is Dylan Faden, Jesse Faden’s brother who was kidnapped years ago following a series of paranormal events. \n\t\n\n\tThe game picks up as Dylan’s former captors, the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), are deploying him at the peak of a supernatural crisis to combat a mysterious cosmic entity. Per the official logline, “Dylan must harness his new found powers to take the fight to the myriad threats overwhelming Manhattan. On the path to unlocking the full potential of his supernatural abilities Dylan will also seek out his sister, FBC Director Jesse Faden, as he struggles to comprehend and contain the dangers that have spilled beyond the confines of the Oldest House to tear the world apart.”    \n\n\tNews of the much-anticipated followup game was announced out of The Game Awards Thursday and comes nearly seven years after “Control” was first released.\n\n\tThe game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, and Mac via Steam and the App Store. Annapurna Pictures are co-financing and co-producing “Control Resonant” as part of a strategic partnership with Remedy Entertainment, who will self-publish. \n\t\n\n\tA cult-classic hit, “Control” sold more than 2 million copies in the first 15 months following its debut. As of August, lifetime sales for “Control” have since exceeded 5 million copies, Remedy announced. \n\n\t“’Control Resonant’ pushes our paranatural action RPG series into an expansive, reality-warping playground of choice, power, and consequence,” said Mikael Kasurinen, the creative director of the game, in a statement. “You don’t have to know the first game to jump into the sequel, we’ve made this one easy to pick up and hard to put down. We’re pushing the scale beyond anything we’ve done before, elevating combat, exploration, and storytelling into a bigger, more memorable experience. It’s ambitious, a little wild, and we can’t wait for players to get lost in it.” \n\n\tWatch the “Control Resonant” announcement trailer below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Van Der Beek is seeking additional finances to help cover costs for his cancer treatment. The 48-year-old “Dawson’s Creek” star has elected to team with Propstore to sell memorabilia he’s obtained through his career.\n\n\tThe catalog includes wardrobe, props and set pieces, with listings such as the prom necklace that Van Der Beek’s Dawson gifted Joey (Katie Holmes) for prom in “Dawson’s Creek” and the cleats and West Canaan Coyotes Hat worn by Van Der Beek in the 1999 feature “Varsity Blues.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve been storing these treasures for years, waiting for the right time to do something with them, and with all of the recent unexpected twists and turns life has presented recently, it’s clear that the time is now,” Van Der Beek told People. “While I have some nostalgia tugging at me as I part with these items, it feels good to be able to offer them through Propstore’s auction to share with those who have supported my work over the years.”\n\n\n\tThe items will go on sale through Propstore’s annual Winter Entertainment Memorabilia Live Auction, which runs from Dec. 5 to Dec. 7. All proceeds go to Van Der Beek’s medical costs.\n\n\tVan Der Beek was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer last year. Colorectal cancer, which begins in the colon or rectum, is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society. In the U.S., about 1 in 23 men and 1 in 25 women will be diagnosed with this form of cancer in their lifetime.\n\n\t“I’ve been privately dealing with this diagnosis and have been taking steps to resolve it, with the support of my incredible family,” Van Der Beek told People when revealing his diagnosis to the public. “There’s reason for optimism, and I’m feeling good.”\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, colorectal cancer has the second-highest treatment cost of any form of cancer. More than $24.3 billion was spent on treatment in the U.S. in 2020, accounting for 11.3% of cancer treatment costs in the country.\n",

    "description": "\n\tABKCO Records, which owns the rights to the master recordings of the Rolling Stones up to 1970, has sued Behr Paint, alleging copyright infringement",
    "body": "\n\tABKCO Records, which owns the rights to the master recordings of the Rolling Stones up to 1970, has sued Behr Paint, alleging copyright infringement over the use of the group’s 1966 song “Paint It, Black” in one of its online commercials.\n\n\tThe complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, Southern Division, and obtained by Variety, alleges that “Behr, without ABKCO’s authorization, without compensating ABKCO, and for its sole commercial benefit, reproduced, distributed, publicly performed, transmitted, prepared a derivative work embodying, and otherwise exploited the ABKCO Recording in a commercial advertisement to promote BEHR’s products and business.”\n\t\n\n\tIt adds, “Behr is a sophisticated, multi-billion-dollar corporation that, upon information and belief, routinely licenses recorded music for its commercials, yet it inexplicably chose in this case not to seek a license for ‘Paint It, Black.’”\n\n\n\tABKCO is seeking unspecified damages as a result. The ad appears to have been removed from Behr’s robust Instagram archive, although unofficial versions can be found online.\n\n\tVariety has contacted Behr representatives for comment. \n\n\tWilliam Pittenger, General Counsel for ABKCO noted, “The type of commercial use exploited by Behr undergoes some of the highest level of scrutiny in the world of music licensing and carries some of the most substantial licensing fees. Because of Behr’s decision not to request and obtain the necessary license, this commercial brand association has been forced upon ABKCO and the artists without any consideration or compensation.”\n\t\n\n\tThe online ad, posted to Behr’s official Instagram account, shows a house being painted not black but a greyish-green color while the song plays. In one version of the clip found on Instagram, a brief snippet of dialogue from the Martin Scorsese 1989 film “Goodfellas,” which features the song, is heard, suggesting that the recording was taken from the film, potentially resulting in further copyright issues.\n\n\t“Paint It, Black,” written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1966 and is one of the Rolling Stones‘ biggest hits, although its lyrics — written from the perspective of a person whose outlook is so dark that he wants to paint everything black — are unusual for an ad with an otherwise upbeat tone.  \n\n\tABKCO, which was founded by the late former Stones and Beatles business manager Allen Klein, has a long history of aggressively protecting the copyrights it owns and oversees. Perhaps the most famous was over the Verve’s 1997 hit “Bittersweet Symphony,” which samples a five-second portion of a cover of the Stones’ song “The Last Time” by the Andrew Loog Oldham Orchestra. The Stones had agreed to license the segment in exchange for 50 percent of the royalties, but ABKCO claimed the clip was longer and violated the agreement. It filed a successful plagiarism case that resulted in the Verve relinquishing all royalties and publishing rights to ABKCO, and the song credit reverted to Jagger and Richards. However, this decision was reversed in 2019 when the two Stones signed over the publishing on “Bittersweet Symphony” to Verve frontman Richard Ashcroft, allowing all future royalties to go to him.\n\n\tABKCO is represented by Benjamin S. Akley and Shamar Toms-Anthony of the law firm Pryor Cashman LLP.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFX has canceled “English Teacher” after two seasons, Variety has confirmed.\n\n\tThe comedy series was created by Brian Jordan Alvarez, who starred as Evan Marquez, a high school English teacher in Austin that navigates several personal and political scandals at work. The cast also included Stephanie Koenig, Sean Patton, Carmen Christopher, Enrico Colantoni and Jordan Firstman.\n\n\tFX had no comment.\n\n\n\t“English Teacher” premiered in September 2024, with Season 2 following in September of this year. While Season 1 followed a week-to-week model for new episodes, FX opted for a binge release on Season 2, debuting all 10 episodes at once.\n\t\n\n\tDays before the release of Season 1, Alvarez was accused of sexual assault by Jon Ebeling, his former friend and co-star on “The Gay and Wondrous Life of Caleb Gallo,” a 2015 webseries that Alvarez created and starred in. Ebeling first made the allegations on Instagram, then expanded on the issue in a December 2024 New York Magazine article. Ebeling also accused Koenig — his ex-girlfriend and Alvarez’s close friend, who wrote on “English Teacher” in addition to starring — of helping to uphold the harmful dynamic between him and Alvarez.\n\n\tNews of the allegations did not initially impact the fate of “English Teacher” at FX, which renewed the series for Season 2 less than two months after the New York Magazine story broke. About the story, a spokesperson for FX said, “We reviewed the allegations presented to us by another media outlet prior to the show’s launch. Mr. Ebeling never reached out to us with any concerns. We will have no further comment at this time.” \n\t\n\n\tThe network did not mention of the allegations in its press release about the renewal, instead providing a celebratory statement from president Nick Grad: “’English Teacher’ was one of the most critically acclaimed new shows of 2024 and we are grateful to the producers, writers, cast, directors and crew for the show’s creative excellence. We look forward to the new season.”\n\n\t“English Teacher” was executive produced by Alvarez, Paul Simms, Jonathan Krisel, Dave King, Kathryn Dean, Jake Bender and Zach Dunn and produced by FX Productions.\n",

Rajamouli has unveiled the first look of Priyanka Chopra Jonas as Mandakini in his upcoming globe-trotting adventure film. \n\n\tThe film is described as “an original action-adventure epic following heroes on a series of perilous missions around the world.”\n\n\tEver since the global smash hit “RRR” claimed the Oscar for best original song and recalibrated Indian cinema’s global ambition, Rajamouli has set his sights higher. The film unites the director with Telugu cinema superstar Mahesh Babu and welcomes international star Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Malayalam powerhouse Prithviraj Sukumaran. \n\t\n\n\tThe title of the film will be revealed at a fan event in Hyderabad this weekend. \n\n\n\tRajamouli’s earlier two-part “Baahubali” saga, re-edited as “Baahubali: The Epic,” landed this year as a single film. \n\n\tJonas returns to Indian cinema with a splash with Rajamouli’s film, portraying the enigmatic Mandakini’ in a first look that sees her in a mustard saree, pistol in hand, balanced on a cliff edge.  Her recent credits include her Prime Video film “Heads of State” (2025), alongside Idris Elba and John Cena, and her short-film contribution to the Oscar-nominated “Anuja.”\n\n\tTelugu cinema superstar Mahesh Babu is working with Rajamouli for what is billed as his 29th film (hence the working title SSMB 29).  His recent release, “Guntur Kaaram” (2024) was a box office success and now he’s stepping into a much larger, globe-spanning canvas.  \n\n\tOriginating from Malayalam cinema, Prithviraj Sukumaran is now a pan-India star with film like “Salaar” and the “Lucifer” franchise. Already known for intense roles across systems, his participation signals the project’s ambition to blend South Indian star power into a unified global offering. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tEmily Blunt sat down with Elle magazine for its Women in Hollywood cover series and looked back at her first movie audition, which was for Paweł Pawlikowski’s 2004 romance drama “My Summer of Love.” Blunt was 19 years old at the time. The movie encouraged improvisations, so there was no script to read from during the audition. \n\n\t“Paweł sat by the window and he had this mad hair,” Blunt said. “He’s filming me on his camcorder and in his Polish accent he goes, ‘Okay, so we’re going to do a little reading. You look out the window and you see your dad and he’s fucking his secretary, and I want you to be horrified. You get very, very mad. Then get very upset and cry about it. And then at some point, pretend the whole thing’s a joke. Okay, go.’”\n\t\n\n\t“He gave me no opportunity, but to put my feet to the fire,” Blunt added, noting that she immediately called her agent afterward and recounted how awful and embarrassing she thought she did in the audition. Blunt ultimately got the role, starring opposite Natalie Press in the film.\n\n\t“It was about living in the moment, and really becoming somebody else,” Blunt said about acting in the film, which centers on the romance between two young women. “Paweł taught me a lot about ambiguity and spontaneity, which was completely terrifying to me at first. To work without any conformity was super scary. But I learned swiftly afterward from watching the movie how compelling ambiguity can be.”\n\n\tBlunt continued, “It just really created this foundation for me of, you can do really scary things, you can create, you can change the lines, you can stretch a scene around—you can do that. So I’d say that movie was a big turning point, a big lesson for me. Like being chucked in the deep end with a weight around my ankles.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile not an enormous box office success, “My Summer of Love” was strongly embraced by film critics and won the best British film prize at the BAFTAs. The movie was Pawlikowski’s second feature directorial effort and he would go on to helm the likes of “Ida” and “Cold War,” the former of which won the Oscar for best international feature and the latter of which earned Pawlikowski a best director nomination.\n\n\tBlunt’s performance in “My Summer of Love” was widely praised, with Variety’s review calling her “terrific” and praising her for adding a “sense of menace” to the film with her “mysterious, mixed-up” character.\n\n\tHead over to Elle magazine’s website to read Blunt’s latest profile in its entirety.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Magazine Dreams,” the violent bodybuilding drama from director Elijah Bynum that earned critical acclaim at Sundance in 2023 only to get caught up assault allegations against its lead star Jonathan Majors, is now set to hit cinemas in the U.K.\n\n\tThe release comes through a unique distribution partnership between BUFF Studios, the distribution arm of the British Urban Film Festival, alongside Celsius Entertainment and Aaryan K. Trivedi. Celsius is continuing to sell the film at the American Film Market.\n\t\n\n\tThe deal marks BUFF Studios’ ongoing expansion into distribution following its releases of “No Shade” and “Ireke: Rise of the Maroons.” The U.K. release is set for Dec. 5 2025, with Vue Cinemas confirmed to roll out the film across multiple sites in London, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and Nottingham.\n\n\n\t“A film festival like BUFF’s move into distribution with a film of this quality represents an important innovation for the market,” said Trivedi, who released “Magazine Dreams” in Africa through his company WTHW films (“Kneecap,” “Mapantsula”). “We’re thrilled to have made this deal and are eager to see how collaborations like this can evolve the international distribution landscape.”\n\n\tEmmanuel Anyiam-Osigwe, head of global theatrical distribution at BUFF Studios, described the film as a “statement release” for the company.\n\n\t“This partnership with Celsius Entertainment and Aaryan K. Trivedi reflects BUFF’s commitment to bringing bold, artistically fearless stories to UK audiences,” he said. “Our slate represents the next chapter in BUFF’s evolution – from festival platform to full-service distribution brand.”\n\t\n\n\tProduced by Los Angeles Media Fund and distributed in the U.S. earlier this year by Briarcliff Entertainment, “Magazine Dreams “follows Killian Maddox, a driven but troubled bodybuilder struggling with identity, fame, and obsession. The film premiered to strong buzz following its debut at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival, sparking a bidding war won by Searchlight Pictures for a reported mid-seven figure sum. But the distributor dropped the film in January 2024 after Majors was accused of domestic violence against his ex-girlfriend. \n\n\tThe “Magazine Dreams” U.K. deal was brokered between Trivedi, Anyiam-Osigwe for BUFF Studios and Celsius Entertainment .\n",

The Austin-based jewelry brand has reunited with Dolly Parton for a third limited-edition collection, which dropped Tuesday morning and draws directly from her song “Change It,” written for “9 to 5: The Musical.”\n\n\t“If you don’t take the reins it’s gonna stay the same, nothin’ gonna change if you don’t change it.

It’s so much fun to have all this beautiful jewelry and to be able to change it, whatever your mood is.”\n\n\n\tThe 8-piece lineup includes pendant necklaces, huggie and statement earrings, cocktail rings, chains and more, with pieces ranging from $75-$650. It’s available online at KendraScott.com and in select Kendra Scott retail stores.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIMITED-EDITION \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKendra Scott x Dolly Parton ‘Change It’ Collection\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tThe last Dolly Parton x Kendra Scott collaboration, “I Will Always Love You,” came out in June and tapped into Dolly’s famous iconography. Now, drawing inspiration from Parton’s song “Change It” from “9 to 5: The Musical,” the holiday collection captures the spirit of reinvention with convertible, mix and match designs that reflect the iconic country singers evolving artistry and optimism. True to the partnership’s storytelling roots, each piece embodies motifs that define Dolly, woven into Kendra Scott’s signature silhouettes and finished in gold tones and jewel-bright hues.\n\n\tLast month, amid health concerns, Dolly Parton posted a video reassuring her fans that she is indeed “not going anywhere.”\n\n\n\t“Do I look sick to you? I’m working hard here!” she cried out in her signature country twang from a commercial shoot where she is promoting the Grand Ole Opry. Case in point: a slew of partnerships and new launches, including this Kendra Scott jewelry lineup. \n\n\tShop the full collection here, and a few standout pieces below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Batgirl” and “Orange Is the New Black” actor Ruby Rose has taken to Threads to slam Sydney Sweeney as a “cretin” following the release of “Christy,” Sweeney’s biopic on the wrestler Christy Martin that disappointed in its box office debut with just $1.3 million. The drama opened in more than 2,000 theaters in North America and has a $15 million production budget.\n\n\t“The original Christy Martin script was incredible. Life changing,” Rose wrote on Threads. “I was attached to play Cherry. Everyone had experience with the core material. Most of us were actually gay. It’s part of why I stayed in acting. Losing roles happens all the time.”\n\t\n\n\t“For her PR to talk about it flopping and saying SS did it for the ‘people.’ None of ‘the people’ want to see someone who hates them, parading around pretending to be us,” Rose added about Sweeney. “You’re a cretin and you ruined the film. Period. Christy deserved better.”\n\n\n\tRose appears to be knocking Sweeney for her alleged ties to the Republican party, which Sweeney has never outright confirmed or denied. Various news outlets, including The Guardian, reported over the summer that Sweeney listed her party affiliation as Republican while registering to vote in Florida in June 2024, a few months before Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. Trump celebrated those reports on Sweeney.\n\n\tVariety has reached out to Sweeney’s representatives for comment in addition to Black Bear, the production and distribution company behind “Christy.” Rose’s reps have also been tapped. \n\n\tSources with knowledge of the project told Variety that Black Bear was never attached to “Christy” with Rose involved, so any possible involvement the actor had with the film occurred before Black Bear joined its development. Another source told Variety that Rose had circled the role of Christy’s high school girlfriend in a version of the film prior to Black Bear’s involvement.\n\t\n\n\tSweeney’s “Christy” is directed by David Michôd and co-stars Ben Foster. The film chronicles the boxer Christy Martin’s rise to fame in the ring, as well as the abuse she faced from her coach-turned-husband. In Variety’s review, chief film critic Owen Gleiberman praised Sweeney’s performance and described the feature as a “wrenching portrait of abuse, enabling, gaslighting, and just how far domestic violence can go.”\n\n\tAfter the film’s disappointing start at the box office, Sweeney issued a statement on her Instagram profile in which she wrote: “We don’t always just make art for numbers, we make it for impact. And ‘Christy’ has been the most impactful project of my life.”\n\n\t“This film stands for survival, courage, and hope. Through our campaigns, we’ve helped raise awareness for so many affected by domestic violence. We all signed on to this film with the belief that Christy’s story could save lives,” Sweeney added. “Thank you to everyone who saw, felt, and believed and will believe in this story for years to come. If Christy gave even one woman the courage to take her first step toward safety, then we will have succeeded.”\n\n\t“Christy” continues to play in theaters nationwide from Black Bear.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSara Joe Wolansky left her job as a video producer at The New Yorker in 2022 to pursue a  feature documentary career. After a few months of reflection, Wolansky decided to make a film about a topic that she was passionate about: cheesemongers.\n\n\tLike a sommelier whose expertise is wine, cheesemongers are experts in cheese. A vaunted, prestigious career in Europe, American cheesemongers are, for the most part, not held in such high esteem. Wolansky spent close to three years following America’s greatest cheesemongers as they attempted the impossible:  beating the French at their own game and winning the Mondial du Fromage, the Olympics of cheese. The result is Wolansky’s first feature doc “The Big Cheese.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the film, the director follows a team of eccentric and determined U.S.-based cheesemongers led by Adam “Mr. Moo” Moskowitz as they compete and overcome personal obstacles during training for the Mondial du Fromage, which is held in France every two years.\n\n\n\tVariety spoke to Wolansky ahead of the premiere screening of “The Big Cheese” at DOC NYC on Nov. 13.\n\n\tYou have made several short docs. Why did you think this film needed to be a feature?\n\n\tThis story had so many layers. Beyond just the competition element and the “cheese knowledge” element, there were so many personal stories from nearly every American cheesemonger I spoke to that each could have sustained their own doc. There is also a whole world of international cheesemongers with entirely different cheese cultures and entire other cinematic universes’ worth of incredible personal stories. Editing down some of the interviews we did with the international cheesemongers at Mondial and excluding most of them entirely was a painful challenge.\n\t\n\n\tWhat was the biggest challenge of making “The Big Cheese” as a first-time feature doc director?\n\n\tFunding for documentaries has always been challenging, but [it’s] particularly right now. As this is my first feature as director, I didn’t have an extensive track record or established funding relationships to rely on, which made things even tougher. I’m deeply grateful to our funders and investors for believing in the vision of this project, trusting me with it, and for embracing a more unconventional, out-of-the-box approach. It took a lot of “no’s” and a lot of perseverance to make this happen.\n\n\tWith competition docs it’s always nerve-racking because if one of your subjects doesn’t win, it’s a bit of a let-down for the audience. Was that a concern of yours during filming?\n\n\tThe challenge of making an underdog doc is that, by definition, the underdog is unlikely to win. The very tension that makes the story compelling is the same tension that makes a “Hollywood ending” improbable in real life. You have to approach it assuming they won’t win, and if they do, it’s an extra, unexpected bonus. So a key question I always asked myself, in both development and while filming, was, “What is our story about if the Americans lose?” I had always imagined Adam’s journey with addiction and sobriety as a key emotional backbone of the film. In 2019, during his last trip to the Mondial du Fromage, he hit rock bottom and even contemplated taking his own life. The 2023 competition, the first he’s attended since then, marks a powerful return. This isn’t just a story of redemption for the American cheese community; it’s also a deeply personal redemption story for Adam himself.\n\n\tYou wanted to make this doc “light” and funny? Why?\n\n\tThis film does get into a suicide attempt and drug and alcohol addiction, so it’s not without its darker themes. But I felt leading with the fun and approachable elements of the film would be an easier entry point for a prospective viewer into an exploration of those more serious issues. Humor can be an incredibly powerful way to build empathy and while there are many heartbreaking stories on this topic, I think it’s important to also highlight hopeful and inspirational narratives.\n",

    "body": "\n\tValve, the maker of the popular Steam Deck handheld PC gaming console, is launching new video-game hardware, Steam Machine, in 2026.\n\n\tThe Steam Machine, a 6-inch cube gaming console meant for stationary play vs. the portable Steam Deck option, will debut next year along with the Steam Controller and VR headset Steam Frame. \n\n\t“With over six times the horsepower of Steam Deck, Steam Machine has the power to play your whole Steam library, including your favorite AAA titles,” Valve says. “Just sign with your Steam account and your entire library is there.”\n\t\n\n\tPer Valve, all three devices “are optimized for Steam and designed for players to get even more out of their Steam library.”\n\n\n\tPricing has not yet been revealed for the new devices, which are now available for wishlisting on Steam.\n\n\tWatch Valve’s announcement of the new Steam Machine hardware and accessories below.\n\n\n\n\n\tSee more gaming news from this week in the roundup below.\n\t\n\t\tNEW RELEASES\t\n\n\tFirst-person sci-fi adventure and immersive sim “Ambrosia Sky” debuted with “Act One” of the video game Monday across PC via Steam and Epic Games Store. Acts Two and Three of the game will launch in 2026.\n\n\tPer developer Soft Rains, “In ‘Ambrosia Sky,’ players assume the role of Dalia, a field scientist belonging to an enigmatic order in pursuit of human immortality. Dispatched to a farming colony on Saturn’s outer rings, a place she once called home, she finds it abandoned and overrun by hostile fungi. Those she knew are now dead, missing, or perhaps complicit. It’s up to Dalia to cleanse the contamination, discover the truth, and lay the dead to rest.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the first act, “Ambrosia Sky” “thrusts you into a mind-bending world of death, decay, and what comes after. Armed with a chemical sprayer and grappling hook, you’ll face unpredictable alien growths across the colony.”\n\n\tWatch the launch trailer for “Ambrosia Sky” below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTRAILERS\t\n\n\tMicrosoft’s Activision and Treyarch debuted a new trailer for the Milo Ventimiglia-led “Call of Duty: Black Ops 7” ahead of the game’s launch Nov. 14.\n\n\tNew details were also revealed about the game’s co-op campaign “Endgame,” which takes place after the conclusion of the first 11 missions. \n\n\tPer Xbox, “Endgame is the culmination of the story, where the world fully opens up for 1-32 players in squads of up to four. Working together on Avalon across a variety of missions, players will wield personalized abilities and face unexpected challenges, putting everything they’ve mastered throughout the story to the test.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRELEASE DATES\t\n\n\tProbablyMonsters announced an enhanced version of its action rogue-like “Storm Lancers” will launch Dec. 9 on Nintendo Switch and for PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. \n\n\tPer the video game developers, “This version of ‘Storm Lancers’ will have HDR support, run at a smooth 60 frames-per-second and allows players to group up online through Nintendo GameShare and Steam Remote Play Together.\n\t\n\t\tTECH\t\n\n\tRoblox has made its rewarded video ads product available to “all ads-eligible creators” on the website. The goal with this development is “providing our developers with a more predictable, easy-to-implement solution to increase their earnings and gain more control over ad revenue,” according to Roblox.\n\n\tAdditionally, Roblox has launched a self-serve option for its License Manager tool, which allows any eligible IP holder—from major studios to brands with registered IP — to offer their IP for use on the gaming platform, and gives any eligible creator the chance to apply to adapt an experience to use it. \n\n\tAccording to Roblox, since the launch of the License Manager with founding partners Lionsgate, Netflix, Sega, and Kodansha in July, creators have submitted over 1,500 license requests from the selection of available IP.\n\t\n\n\t“We launched the licensing platform to fundamentally change how IP holders and creators collaborate across the platform,” said Greg Hartrell, Senior Product Director, Creator Content Ecosystem in a blog post. “This new system dramatically streamlines a historically complex IP licensing process, which previously involved lengthy negotiations and restricted partnerships to a select group of studios.\n\t\n\t\tCOLLABORATIONS\t\n\n\tRiot Games has released a music video for the “Valorant” Game Changers Championship 2025. Titled “Go Off,” the music video features a reimagined version of “M.I.A.” by KATSEYE, which is this year’s championship anthem. It is available across streaming platforms.\n\n\tThe music video tells the story of the women in “Valorant” and the women who play it, celebrating the connection and community that they foster through the game. \n\n\tThe “Valorant” Game Changers Championship 2025 will take place Nov. 28-30 at at Riot’s LoL Park in Seoul.\n\t\n\t\tMONETIZATION\t\n\n\tFortnite developers now have the ability to make in-island transactions with new tools from Epic. They will soon be able to publish games in-island and sell items directly from their islands using V-Bucks. These transactions are part of the Unreal Editor for Fortnite Creator Ecosystem Update and offer developers monetization opportunities beyond engagement payouts.\n\n\tSee the full list of items that developers are authorized to sell, how to join in the monetization and the updated developer guidelines on the Fortnite website. \n",

    "body": "\n\tA film of deceptive simplicity, Jason Osder and William Lafi Youmans’s investigative documentary “Who Killed Alex Odeh?” often struggles against its own straightforward style, but in the process, embodies the helplessness of its grieving subjects. Its focus is the 1985 assassination of a Palestinian activist in California, the specifics of which it lays out through archival footage. However, contemporary interviews and investigations turn up surprising answers about who was responsible — not because their identities are unknown, but because the specifics have been in plain sight for decades.\n\t\n\n\tThe film’s very premise presents a challenge, especially in the age of the true crime documentary. The suspects who bombed the office of Alex Odeh have long been identified by the FBI, and while one was imprisoned for unrelated crimes, the other two have been living comfortably in Israel for many years. In the film, this is treated halfway between a major reveal and an inevitability — it’s hard to be quite sure of the intent — but what’s surprising isn’t these known facts about the alleged terrorists, but rather, the ease with which Israeli investigative journalist David Sheen follows up on these leads, which the authorities consider cold.\n\n\n\tUsing both old and contemporary footage, the movie captures — often plainly — the perspectives of Odeh’s widow and his daughter, in the form of sit-down interviews that help catch us up on various details. These talking-head segments seldom probe further than the surface of the subjects’ grief; such a thing might theoretically be invasive, but this is the nature of the filmmakers’ chosen topic. “Who Killed Alex Odeh?” is, or ought to be, as much about the question posed by its title as the secondary, implied question underneath: “Who was Alex Odeh?” This query is largely left up to news clips, from ‘80s and ‘90s, of people discussing him in death — both supporters and detractors alike. This gradually pivots the narrative toward the possible culprits in the form of the Jewish Defense League (JDL), an organization in Europe and North America branded a right-wing terrorist group by the FBI. However, who Odeh was outside these parameters of this death is given only glancing attention, making it hard to fathom who and what was lost.\n\t\n\n\tThe investigation itself takes curious turns, with surprises that are less about the facts themselves and more about the ease with which necessary information can be found online — a simplicity of access that ends up applicable to alleged perpetrators too. Reporters including Sheen can be seen concocting covert plots to meet with them face to face, the success or failure of which briefly becomes an intense point of interest. As the directors paint a portrait of the JDL and its founder Meir Kahane, the film becomes undoubtedly informative, with enough by way of violent statements made against Arabs, accompanied by spooky music, to really hammer home how scary these forces are.\n\n\tHowever, what goes unsaid even amidst the most surprising parts of the reporters’ quest — including discoveries the camera captures in real time, about why the case was unceremoniously dropped — is the “why” of it all. The film can’t help but leave lingering questions about its bigger picture, i.e. the entwinement of American and Israeli politics, which still continues to influence why a case like Odeh’s might go unsolved or un-prosecuted. In its laser focus on Odeh’s death, it leaves out not only much of his life, but the more chilling global ripple effects of why this subject is of such vital importance today.\n\n\tOn one hand, a wider political purview is something each audience member ought to bring into a film themselves. On the other, “Who Killed Alex Odeh?” is left occasionally languishing in an awkward middle ground between probing the universality of this story and leaving it to the imagination. All in all, however, the movie’s straightforward aesthetic approach ends up jostled by the very nature of the story at hand, where it turns out, some 30-odd minutes into its runtime, that its most major twist is the fact that it lacks one altogether. It makes for an especially intriguing oddity where the sheer lack of stylistic flourish — for better or worse — feels rooted in an anti-mystery, where the dearth of available options for justice ends up paralyzing and defeating. By the end, its lack of catharsis is the point.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDaniel Radcliffe recently joined ScreenRant for a video interview and urged press moving forward not to ask the new “Harry Potter” actors about the original cast. Dominic McLaughlin is taking over the lead role in HBO’s “Harry Potter” series reboot opposite Arabella Stanton as Hermione and Alastair Stout as Ron.\n\n\t“When these kids got cast, there is a whole thing around the internet being like, ‘We have to look after these kids!'” Radcliffe said. “If you really mean that, then one of the things you can do is don’t ask about us – me, Emma [Watson] and Rupert [Grint] – all the time. I would like not to be weird spectral phantoms in these children’s lives. Just let them get on [with it], it’s going to be a new, different thing. I’m sure Dominic is going to be better than me.”\n\t\n\n\tRadcliffe revealed on “Good Morning America” last year that he wrote a letter to McLaughlin after the newcomer was announced as HBO’s Boy Who Lived. The young actor later said it was “insane” to receive Radcliffe’s support and “I was going mad.” \n\n\n\t“I wrote to Dominic and sent him a letter and he sent me a very sweet note back,” Radcliffe said. “I don’t want to be a specter in the life of these children but I just wanted to write to him to say, ‘I hope you have the best time, and an even better time than I did — I had a great time, but I hope you have an even better time.’ And I do, I just see these pictures of him and the other kids and I just want to hug them. They just seem so young. I just look at them and say, ‘Oh, it’s crazy I was doing that at that age.’ But it’s also incredibly sweet and I hope they’re having a great time.”\n\t\n\n\tRupert Grint similarly wrote a letter to Alastair Stout as the young actor takes over the role of Ron Weasley. As Grint told the BBC last year: “I wrote him a letter before they started, passing the baton as it were. It was really just wishing him all the best with it. I had so much fun stepping into this world, and I hope he has the same experience… It’s quite strange to have the cycle happening again. I’m really intrigued what it’s going to be like.”\n\n\tWhile Radcliffe’s “Harry Potter” experience is near and dear to his heart, he told ScreenRant that he’s only ever watched his own “Potter” movies once or twice. He quipped that he’s actually excited to show his children HBO’s reboot instead. \n\n\t“I’ll probably show my kid that so he doesn’t have to watch me,” Radcliffe said. “I think that will be more fun. I would probably enjoy it more… I hate watching myself, generally. I would like to watch the earlier films more because I’m so much further away from them. When I was 18 or 10, I was embarrassed by my 10 or 11 year old self.”\n\n\tWatch Radcliffe’s full interview with ScreenRant in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBrian Tyree Henry is headed to Netflix with the adult animated series “Bass X Machina.”\n\n\tHenry will executive produce and star in the show which is set to debut on Oct. 6\n\n\tJoining Henry in the voice cast are: Janelle Monáe as Glory, Tati Gabrielle as Dana, Cree Summer as Ahni, Chaske Spencer as Lighthorse, Currie Graham as Rivenbark and Starletta DuPois as Etta.\n\n\n\t“Bass x Machina” is set in a lawless steampunk West overrun by brutal outlaws, machines, and supernatural terrors, where a father is forced to become judge, jury, and executioner — knowing that every act of justice meant to protect his family may ultimately cost him the very people he’s fighting to save.\n\t\n\n\tOn board for the show’s original music  are Roman GianArthur and Nate Wonder at Wondaland. \n\n\t LeSean Thomas, Jennifer Wiley-Moxley, Chad Handley are also on board as executive producers.\n\n\tHenry is no stranger to the world of animation. Aside from voicing Bass in the upcoming series, Henry voiced Jefferson Davis in “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” and its sequel “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” He’s set to return to the next installment “Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.” When asked about what to expect, Henry told Variety’s Marc Malkin, “We have to conclude it. It has to be concluded. Can you imagine if we were like, ‘That’s it. He’s in a portal and that’s it.'” He went on to say, “It takes time, but we got to make you wait a little bit. You know what I mean? But it’s coming. It’s coming. There’s not going to be a dry eye in the house. I’ll tell you that. Good luck. It’s not going to wrap up in a nice little bow.”\n\t\n\n\tThe animation for “Bass x Machina” will be done by South Korea’s Studio Mir.\n\n\tHenry is repped by Jennifer Wiley-Moxley of JWM Entertainment Group, CAA, Jill Fritzo PR, and Jackoway Austen et al. \n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. has joined a parade of studios in blasting ByteDance for “blatant infringement” on its new AI video service, accusing the Chinese company of facilitating user-generated knockoffs of its iconic characters.\n\n\tThe studio’s legal counsel fired off a letter on Tuesday to John Rogovin, the general counsel of ByteDance who happens to have previously worked as general counsel at Warner Bros. The letter takes note of Rogovin’s prior service in defense of the copyrights of Superman and Batman.\n\t\n\n\t“These characters are the lifeblood of the company,” wrote Wayne Smith, the executive VP of legal at Warner Bros. Studios. “ByteDance is now engaged in blatant infringement of the very same properties you spent many years protecting.”\n\n\n\tWarner Bros. demanded that ByteDance cease training on its characters and implement guardrails to prevent further infringement.\n\n\tByteDance, the owner of TikTok, released Seedance 2.0 last week, announcing it represents a “substantial leap in generation quality” over the prior versions. Within days, social media sites were flooded with cinematic-looking clips of Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt, Batman fighting Spider-Man, Superman fighting Thanos, and other permutations.\n\n\tUsers also posted “alternate endings” to films and TV shows, including one of the HBO series “Game of Thrones.”\n\n\tThe Motion Picture Association and SAG-AFTRA quickly denounced the new platform, while Disney and Paramount sent cease and desist letters last week. On Monday, ByteDance pledged to implement additional safeguards “as we work to prevent the unauthorised use of intellectual property and likeness by users.”\n\t\n\n\tThat promise did not satisfy Warner Bros., which said in its letter that the focus on users is misplaced.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“[T]he users are not the ones at the root cause of the infringement,” Smith wrote. “They are merely building on the foundation of infringement already laid by ByteDance as Seedance comes pre-loaded with Warner Bros. Discovery’s copyrighted characters. That was a deliberate design choice by ByteDance.”\n\n\tThe letter cites posts on X, formerly Twitter, that include Seedance videos of characters from “The Matrix,” “The Lord of the Rings,” “Harry Potter,” “Rick and Morty,” and “Game of Thrones.” It also cites fight scenes involving Batman, Catwoman, and Superman.\n\n\tWarner Bros. acknowledges that ByteDance appears to be taking steps to block text prompts involving its characters.\n\n\t“While this is a promising indication that we may resolve this dispute business to business, it nonetheless begs the question why guardrails that can so quickly and easily be implemented were not present upon Seedance’s release,” the letter states.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTed Sarandos isn’t hiding his frustration at the hurdle that emerged Tuesday in Netflix‘s plan to acquire Warner Bros. and HBO Max through an $83 billion sale agreement reached in December. \n\n\tSarandos told CNBC in an interview Tuesday that Paramount Skydance has spread falsehoods designed to destabilize the Netflix transaction. Under pressure from shareholders, WBD sought a seven-day waiver from Netflix in order to begin new negotiations with the Paramount group. Netflix granted the waiver in an effort to end the uncertainty and move on with a key shareholder vote that has been set for March 20.\n\t\n\n\tParamount Skydance has been on a campaign of “flooding the zone with misinformation, creating a bunch of what-ifs and scenarios that are very wild, and even in any end of that range, let alone the top end of that range,” Sarandos told CNBC’s Julia Boorstin. “The most likely outcome is, there’s no adjustment at all. Warners had been very clear that their intent is to maximize cash for the shareholders.”\n\n\n\tSarandos asserted his confidence that Netflix will complete the deal, nor does he see any reasons for the federal goverment to “block the deal.” He also took aim at Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison’s assertions that it would have an easier path toward securing regulatory approval for the deal than Netflix, given the streaming giant’s stature in entertainment’s new world order.\n\n\tParamount Skydance “does not have a faster regulatory path. I don’t know why the Ellisons would insinuate they have some inside track in the Department of Justice, but I can assure you they don’t, and that, and in terms of our regulatory in Europe and around the world, we are known entities and trusted entities with all the players in Europe,” Sarandos said. “And, in fact, our deal, by not acquiring Discovery Global, we don’t disrupt the European broadcast system at all.”\n\t\n\n\tSarandos explained that granting the waiver to allow WBD to engage in talks with Paramount, despite the signed acquisition agreement, was an effort to allow the deal to move forward.\n\n\t“We have given the opportunity to get those shareholders exactly what they deserve, which is complete clarity and certainty about what the value of these deals are,” Sarandos said. “And what we’re certain is, is that the Netflix deal to acquire these assets is the best deal, generates the best value for their shareholders. And they think so too. That’s why they recommended the deal and why they reiterated recommending that deal post this. So give them seven days to put their money where their mouth is.”\n\n\tSarandos would not get into specifics when pressed about the notion floated in WBD’s Securities and Exxchange Commission filings that a Paramount source had floated the idea of raising the company’s bid to $31, from $30 where it stands at present. \n\n\t“Our goal here is to make sure that folks take the seven days to figure out exactly where they stand. And then, on March 20, there is a vote and they will make the decision. And we’re confident that the Warner Bros. Discovery board, which continues to endorse this [Netflix] deal, and the shareholders will come to the same conclusion — that this is the best value for Warner Bros. Discovery,” he said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFox‘s reboot of “Baywatch” is bringing back original series star David Chokachi, Variety has learned. \n\n\tChokachi will reprise the role of Cody Madison in the Fox version, where he will appear alongside recently announced series lead Stephen Amell. Amell will play Hobie Buchanon, the son of legendary lifeguard Mitch Buchanon from the original show. \n\n\tPer the official character description, Cody now runs “The Shoreline, the unofficially official Baywatch bar-and-grill, and still puts on the red trunks for the occasional shift saving lives. He’s a mentor to and a friend, providing a second home for his fellow lifeguards… and always offering free wings after a big save.” \n\t\n\n\tChokachi starred in “Baywatch” beginning with the show’s sixth season, staying with it through the ninth. He also starred in shows like “Witchblade” at TNT and the Noggin surf drama “Beyond the Break.” His film credits include “Atlantic Rim,” “Psycho Beach Party,” and “Soul Surfer.” \n\n\tHe is repped by LINK Entertainment and Singular Talent.\n\n\t“Baywatch” was picked up for the 2026-2027 broadcast season by Fox back in September 2025 with a 12-episode order. Fox is set to host an open casting call for the show on Feb. 18, with production set to begin this spring in Los Angeles.\n\n\tMatt Nix is the showrunner and an executive producer on the reboot along with McG, Michael Berk, Greg Bonann, Doug Schwartz, Dante Di Loreto and Mike Horowitz. McG will also direct the series premiere episode. The series is co-produced by Fox Entertainment and Fremantle.\n\n\tAt its peak, “Baywatch” was the most-watched show in the world, airing in over 200 countries. The ensemble cast included David Hasselhoff as head lifeguard Mitch Buchannon and helped launch the acting careers of stars like Pamela Anderson, Jason Momoa, Yasmine Bleeth, and Carmen Electra. The show also spawned the short-lived spinoff, “Baywatch Nights,” and was rebooted as a feature film starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Zac Efron in 2017.\n",

The Spotify show was teased as far back as May 2025, when fans noticed that a TBD Tokyo date for March, along with the Spotify logo, was included in the itinerary for the “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” world tour.\n\t\n\n\tThough the event comes amid his global tour, it’s being billed as a standalone one-night-only show to celebrate his catalog. The concert will be staged exclusively for Bad Bunny‘s top fans on Spotify in Japan.\n\n\n\tBad Bunny joins the growing slate of artists who have performed as part of Spotify’s Billions Club Live series.

    "body": "\n\tMargot Robbie recently joined “Wuthering Heights” co-star Jacob Elordi for a GQ Australia video interview moderated by fellow Aussie actor Joel Edgerton. When asked how much she considers the moviegoing audience when working on a new movie, Robbie responded that’s all she’s ever thinking about. One group the Oscar nominee is not worried about is film critics.\n\n\t“I consider audience always. I’ve never, ever been on set and thought, ‘What are the critics going to think of this?'” Robbie told Egerton. “I’m like, ‘What’s an audience going to feel right now? What’s their emotional response going to be?’ I believe you should make movies for the people who are going to buy tickets to see the movies. It’s as simple as that.”\n\t\n\n\t“I love working with Emerald [Fennell] because she always prioritizes an emotional experience over a heady idea,” Robbie continued. “She’s very smart. She’s got great ideas, but she’ll let a cool idea fall by the wayside to offer the option that’s going to be most exciting for the audience. I really appreciate that about her.”\n\n\n\tFennell directed Robbie and Elordi as Cathy and Heathcliff in “Wuthering Heights,” which opened in the top spot at the domestic box office amid polarizing responses from audiences. Fennell’s previous movies, “Promising Young Woman” and “Saltburn,” similarly divided viewers. Robbie has produced all three of Fennell’s feature directorial efforts. \n\n\tHate it or love it, audiences can’t stop talking about “Wuthering Heights.” That’s exactly what Robbie wants when she’s making a movie. Last year, fellow A-lister Jennifer Lawrence spoke honestly about the anxiety she gets right before her movies are about to be received by the public.\n\t\n\n\t“The experience only adds to the dread, because I’ve had so many experiences of working so hard on something, loving something so deeply, and then releasing it to the world, and the world just being like, ‘Boo! Hate you!’ It is so awful,” Lawrence told V magazine. “And [yet] somehow, I read a script, I meet with the director, we get on set, we start doing it, and somehow I’m able to forget that this part of the process will happen. I mean, I’m very blessed and very lucky. But it’s a very scary few months.”\n\n\t“My husband was so confused because he doesn’t have as much experience with this stuff,” she continued. “So I was telling him about my anxiety, and he was like, ‘But the movie’s incredible.’ And I was like, ‘I know, but that doesn’t matter. People might not get it.’ And he was like, ‘But they’re wrong.’ Like, as if that was supposed to make me feel better.”\n\n\tWatch Robbie and Elordi’s full GQ Australia conversation in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe American Black Film Festival was a key step in Ryan Coogler’s journey to become an Academy Award-nominated filmmaker. It also gave him a leg up in wooing his future wife and producing partner Zinzi Coogler.\n\n\tIn 2011, Coogler’s short film “Fig” was selected to be part of ABFF and HBO’s annual short film competition, helping the “extremely broke” aspiring director launch his career — and take his “hot girlfriend” on a beach vacation to Miami, where the festival is held annually.\n\t\n\n\t“I didn’t know that we had a festival like that, that had a relationship with HBO, where your short film could get put on television. And that was what I was after, the opportunity for access. And I didn’t know that that prize came with a little cash reward,” Coogler said at the ABFF Honors on Monday night, laughing along with the well-heeled crowd assembled at the SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills.\n\n\n\t“Y’all are laughing, but I was extremely broke at the time. The only one not laughing is Zinzi because she knew how broke I was,” the “Sinners” director quipped, adding, “It’s a lot of work having a woman that hot when you’re that broke.”\n\n\tEven the director of the most-nominated film in Oscars history had to start somewhere.\n\n\t“With that $40k, I immediately went home, back to the Bay, put a down payment on an apartment, you know, slick-talked this cutie into moving in with me, and we was off to the races, for real,” Coogler recalled.\n\n\tIt wasn’t just the money that changed everything. “That was the first time that was a vote of confidence in me that came with some capital that enabled me to really focus and get ‘Fruitvale [Station]’ made,” Coogler continued, looking to ABFF co-founders Jeff and Nicole Friday, who were seated in front of him. “I’ll be forever indebted to you guys for being such incredible cultivators. Whenever I make a film, I think about y’all. I think about this community. It’s got to work for us first, before it works for anybody else. And it means so much when it connects.”\n\t\n\n\tRyan Coogler has taken the stage at pretty much every awards show in existence since “Sinners” earned a record-breaking $368 million at the box office, and this year’s ABFF Honors ceremony was just the latest spotlight that the blockbuster movie commanded. Truth be told, Coogler isn’t the biggest fan of attention, but when it’s about celebrating the entire creative team behind “Sinners,” that’s something he can get involved with.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Sinners” producers Ryan Coogler, Zinzi Coogler and Sev Ohanian at 8th annual American Black Film Festival Honors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe film’s Oscar-nominated stars Michael B. Jordan and Wunmi Mosaku introduced the Cooglers and their Proximity Media co-founder Sev Ohanian to the stage, with Dwayne Johnson (who was honored later in the program) leading the crowd in a standing ovation.\n\n\tZinzi Coogler took the mic first, reflecting on her personal connection to the film, set in 1932 Mississippi; her father was born in 1931 in the Southern state before his family moved to Chicago.\n\n\t“Working on ‘Sinners’ allowed me to dive into the history of my family, my not far-distant ancestors, and imagine a fantastical life they might have lived — despite,” Zinzi Coogler said, wrapping up her remarks by saluting trailblazing filmmakers like Spike Lee, Ava DuVernay, Oscar Micheaux, John Singleton and Euzhan Palcy. “Thank you for bearing the burden of paving a path for filmmakers like ourselves to dream big so that our history, our myths and our legends may carry on across the biggest screens,” she said.\n\n\tIn his speech, Ohanian, who is Armenian, extolled the virtues of allyship across cultures. “My family immigrated here to America from Iran as political refugees when I was very young,” he said, then cracked: “All of which is a long way of saying, in case you guys were not aware, I’m not Black. But what I am is deeply honored to stand here as an ally to my Black colleagues and friends to help them bring their stories to life, and I’m extra proud not to be the first Armenian American to do so.”\n\n\tWhile producing Proximity’s 2021 film, “Judas and the Black Messiah,” Ohanian learned about an Armenian American man named Charles Garry — aka Charles Garabedian — who represented the Black Panther Party.\n\t\n\n\t“He connected first-hand with their struggle for dignity and civil rights. Charles fought beside them at great personal risk, and that example always stayed with me,” Ohanian shared. “When we tell specific stories rooted in culture and lived experience, I believe they, too, can help connect with people across cultures, to show everyone our shared humanity.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSalli Richardson-Whitfield, center, on the rose red carpet at ABFF Honors with Nice Crowd’s Nicole and Jeff Friday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAaron J. Thornton/ABFF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLike Coogler, director and executive producer Salli Richardson-Whitfield (“Task,” “The Gilded Age”) reflected on her full-circle relationship with ABFF as she accepted the Evolution Award.\n\n\t“ABFF isn’t just a film festival. It’s history. It’s proof that Black stories matter and that Black artists endure,” Richardson-Whitfield said, accepting the award from Mario van Peebles and noting that she’d been coming to the fest since its inception 30 years ago. Back then, she was a young actress with big dreams.\n\n\t“Evolution doesn’t stop when you’re recognized,” Richardson-Whitfield said, reflecting on her career transition from on-camera to the director’s chair. “It continues when you’re brave enough to imagine what’s next.”\n\n\tThen, “F1” star Damson Idris was recognized with the Horizon Award presented by uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who lauded the rising talent as the next great movie star.\n\n\tIdris’ journey with ABFF started in 2017 with a special screening of the pilot of his FX show “Snowfall.” Only 17 people showed up for the screening, but Idris never forgot what series creator, the late John Singleton, whispered to him: “Damson, remember, as long as Black people love you, you’ll always have a home.”\n\n\tLearning he’d be honored by the same film festival made him reminisce about the journey from South London to Hollywood. “The early auditions, the rejections, the small wins that meant everything,” the British actor said. “And now to be here, the past few years, stretching me in ways I didn’t expect. Stepping into the world of Formula One recently, the scale of precision working alongside some of the absolute greats sharpens you. It reminds you to stay a student no matter where you are.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDamson Idris, right, poses onstage with “F1” producer Jerry Bruckheimer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKelvin Bulluck / Nice Crowd\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOne of Keke Palmer’s great teachers in this business has been film icon Angela Bassett, whom she presented with the Excellence in the Arts award for her acclaimed body of work.\n\t\n\n\t“I got more starstruck than you’d expect a 10-year-old to be,” Palmer said, sharing what she learned from working alongside Bassett on the set of “Akeela and the Bee,” including how to cry for a key scene in the drama. “She was teaching me not just how to cry on cue, but how to not tear myself apart to get there.”\n\n\tEven more impactful than Bassett’s acting talent, Palmer explained, is how gracefully she’s navigated the entertainment business and all its pitfalls, especially for people of color.\n\n\t“She has survived, not only to share her gift with the world, but with her spirit intact,” Palmer said. “Clarity on who you are as a person and a performer in an industry that’s built on perception is the greatest thing she’s taught me of all. And she never had to say a word for that one; all I had to do is watch. I’m still watching you, Ms. Angela Bassett, and imitating you is the greatest form of flattery I can show for the inspiration that you have been to me.”\n\n\tBassett then delivered the most powerful oration of the evening —a speech about “endurance, commitment, the decision to keep showing up” amid the challenges of a changing world.\n\n\t“We are living in a moment where the language of inclusion and belonging is being challenged, rebranded, and in some cases, erased altogether. Words that once felt good — ‘promise’ and ‘possibility’ — are now treated as words to avoid,” Bassett said. “At the same time, our industry is transforming at lightning speed. Technology is moving faster than wisdom. Business models are shifting under our feet. Stories are being shortened, flattened and sometimes stripped of their soul in the name of efficiency and projected progress.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKeke Palmer and Angela Bassett on stage during the ceremony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKelvin Bulluck / Nice Crowd\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBassett shared what it took her to succeed in an industry that provided few examples that a Black woman could “live a full, complex, enduring life on screen, and even fewer that suggested that she could shape what happens behind the camera.”\n\n\tIt was the community of Black artists around her – and their persistence — that carried her through those trying times.\n\n\t“Those peers who told the truth, those audiences who showed up anyway, and a persistent sacred belief that our stories are not trends. They are truths,” Bassett said. “Targets are being put on our backs as people by those at the highest heights of power in the world, and the only way to combat such vitriol and racism and misinformation about who we are is to keep telling our own stories. By showing the power of our individual and collective journeys. To not just show the world the kings and queens that we have always been, but to also show them that we do belong, we do matter, and we are not going anywhere because we are home. No one gets to determine or define our own humanity.”\n\t\n\n\tBassett closed her speech with words from Harriet Tubman. “Every great dream begins with a dreamer,” she said, quoting the legendary abolitionist. “Always remember that you have within you the strength, the patience and the passion to reach for the stars and to change. Thank you for continuing to dream. Thank you for believing and pushing forward our stories and thank you for imagining a future where excellence includes not just some, but all of us.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJennifer Hudson with her son, David Daniel Otunga Jr., on the ABFF Honors red carpet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEGOT winner and talk show host Jennifer Hudson, who received the Renaissance Award, also spoke about dreams when she accepted the Renaissance Award from her fellow “Dreamgirl,” stage and screen star Sheryl Lee Ralph. Beyond fulfilling her own dreams of being recognized among this lineup, Hudson was focused on inspiring the next generation.\n\n\tHudson brought her son David to the event and, before they arrived, she’d asked who in the industry he hadn’t met that he’d still like to. He answered: Ryan Coogler. She didn’t tell him the filmmaker would be in attendance.\n\n\t“When they got here, I said, ‘You manifested that. Look at the power of the brain and what you can do,’” she said, turning to David and a group of young men he’s grown up with. “Take these moments in. This is why I bring you around, so you can see all the greatness that we can possess.”\n\n\tThe evening’s final award, the Entertainment Icon prize, went to Dwayne Johnson. “Wicked” director Jon M. Chu introduced the actor — jokingly nicknamed “franchise Viagra” — whom he’d cast in 2013’s “G.I. Joe: Retaliation.” On the first day of filming, Johnson wanted to chat.\n\n\t“He put his arm around my puny little shoulders, and said, ‘Can you believe a person who looks like you and a person who looks like me can be directing and starring in this giant movie from a big ass studio for the world to enjoy? I just want you to know I got you. We’re gonna kill this shit together,’” Chu recalled. “I never really thought about my cultural identity on a Hollywood set — at least not out loud. He immediately called it out. And that whisper never left me and inspired me in all my work going forward.”\n\n\tJohnson was visibly emotional as he took the stage, contemplating that idea of identity and those who paved the way for him to be in this position, including his late father, wrestling legend Rocky Johnson.\n\t\n\n\t“He came up as a black man in the ‘60s and the ‘70s, here in the States, in professional wrestling. That’s a different crowd back then; it’s a different audience. And he still chased that excellence and that greatness that this whole room embodies,” Johnson began.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDwayne Johnson speaks onstage at ABFF Honors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKelvin Bulluck / Nice Crowd\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs he mused over the concepts of Black excellence and the pursuit of greatness, Johnson realized that excellence was connected to endurance. “And what endurance is connected to is resilience, and that’s this room — resilient men and women,” he said. “Then, I started to think that resilience is connected to survival. And that’s what we are. Survivors, who have that warrior spirit in us [from] our ancestors and our loved ones. … It’s in us. It’s in our DNA.”\n\n\tThat survivor spirit is how Johnson found his way in a business that didn’t include anyone quite like him, a half-Black, half-Samoan former wrestler with dreams of becoming a movie star. For a while, he tried to fit into the mold Hollywood wanted to put him in, but eventually, he realized he had to buck the odds to truly succeed.\n\n\t“When someone says, ‘Hey, you should do it like this,’ or ‘You can’t do it like that,’ or, ‘Stay in your lane. It’s working.’ I want to take a brass ring and take it to places that it’s never been taken before,” Johnson said. “And if I fail, that’s okay, because I failed being myself, and that’s important.”\n\n\tTo conclude, Johnson shared a final tidbit of wisdom: “Just because something has never been done doesn’t mean that it can’t be done. Just means that we haven’t figured out how to do it yet. And we will figure out how to do it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn his darkest hour, pop singer David Archuleta was so overwhelmed by feelings of shame and guilt over his sexuality that he reached the point of either admitting he was gay or ending his life. He grimly recalls this moment in his debut memoir “Devout,” which was released today via Simon & Schuster/Gallery Books, by detailing his plans to drive off a cliff amid his third engagement to a woman in 2020. “I’d prayed so many times,” he writes. “God had apparently given up on me.”\n\t\n\n\tUp until that point, the 35-year-old had been known as the cherubic “American Idol” runner-up who briefly flirted with major chart success and moonlighted as a picture-perfect Mormon poster boy. But behind the veil of innocence were lifelong struggles: with his controlling father, who he realized years after “American Idol” had been emotionally abusing him; with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose firm stance against homosexuality pushed him deeper into the closet; and with his sexuality, which he first addressed publicly in a 2021 coming-out post on social media.\n\n\n\t“I felt like I had to portray myself a certain way for so long, and now I can finally say hey, just like I came out, I want to be able to give the whole story in the full picture, because it’s not always daisies and roses to get to where you are,” Archuleta tells Variety. “And I felt like I had to present myself that way all my life. Especially as a Mormon and especially on ‘American Idol.’ I always have to be the sweet kid, always grateful for everything that was taking place, but I think a lot of people, especially the queer community who was watching, could relate because they could see the silent struggle that I was going through on a public level in front of millions of people and didn’t know how to process it all. That’s why I wanted a full picture.”\n\t\n\n\tArchuleta tells his story as a now-ex-member of the Church, which he left in 2023. In “Devout,” he briefly recounts his time on “American Idol” but frames it around his overbearing father, focusing on how a false accusation of molestation against him forever strained the family’s dynamic. He writes of leaning on the Church and using the rigidity of its teachings to minimize the feelings it consistently told him were wrong, no matter how detrimental it was to his mental health. It reaches a crescendo as he comes to a crisis of faith, only for the Church to reject his pleas to reconsider its stance on the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n\tNow, Archuleta has a newfound sense of liberation, having grappled with the heaviness of unraveling his foundation of faith. “I just feel motivated to keep moving forward and connecting with people who relate to whatever part of the journey they relate to,” he says, “whether it’s watching me as a kid on ‘American Idol’ or having a difficult parental relationship dynamic, growing up religious, trying to come out, whatever it is. I just hope I can connect with as many people as possible.”\n\t\n\t\tWhat was the lightning strike moment for you where you realized you needed to start working on this memoir?\t\n\n\tI think once I realized how many people were reaching out to me after I came out, I kind of just looked at it as, you know what? Okay, this is done. I’ll move on with my life. And I saw so many people who related to the story who wanted to know about it more and a lot of people asking me how to get there. And a lot of people already have, but it doesn’t hurt to help someone feel seen on their journey if they’re still working on it. Especially within the Latter-day Saint culture, there are many people who are still in this. I was seeing from all the DMs I was getting. And when I was still going to church, people were coming up to me and secretly trying to say, “I’m like you.” I just felt like this whole subculture that existed that I didn’t even know about, ’cause I was always the good Mormon boy. And so I never heard about people who were struggling… I was struggling too, but I never would dare admit that, you know? So I just realized, okay, this conversation needs to be had because so many people are unnecessarily struggling and there’s something that can be done about it, but people have to be willing to listen to the story.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIt was hard to read about the dynamic between you and your father without you realizing it was emotional abuse. What was the experience like revisiting the epiphany around how your father had been treating you?\t\n\n\tThe moment of realization wasn’t hard to revisit because I had relived that, talked about it, I had processed it, and I was fully present by that point with myself, from that point on. It was having to revisit everything else prior to that that I’d blocked out, and that was hard. It was difficult because I didn’t understand. I was very confused. And I didn’t want to have to go back to that confused place as a young kid and as a teenager when I just didn’t have the tools to process it all. My feelings were still as if I were when I was a child. And I was very scared and very troubled and I wanted to run away from it. That’s how I handled it as a kid and that’s how I was able to process it and move on from it. So to have to go back as an adult was very difficult.\n\t\n\t\tYour time on “American Idol” doesn’t take up much of the book. What are your feelings now looking back on that experience?\t\n\n\tIt’s an ongoing healing process for me because I wasn’t able to appreciate the experience at the time. All I knew was to smile and tell people how grateful I was to be there. When the reality was, I couldn’t wait for it to be over. There were times where I even considered running away. But I felt dutiful too. I was like, no, have a duty. People are counting on me and I, but I could care less. I was like, oh my God, I don’t care if I get to the end. I want this to be over with. \n\n\tI had to go look at all the clips while I was writing the book because I had literally blocked it out. It was just cringe. It was the way I’d always felt about myself at that time. Like, I think I was holding on to the feelings that I had when I was going through it, which was, “That kid is so disgusting.” And it was the first time that I was able to look at those feelings, process them, and think, why do you feel that way about him? It was just a reality check. I was like, wow, I really hated myself during that time. But I was starting to realize, wait a second, David, that’s your reaction right now, but you don’t have to feel that way towards yourself anymore. We’ve worked through that.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAs you’re writing “Devout,” are you thinking about how the Church is going to react to the way that you’re writing about them?\t\n\n\tYeah, I tried to be really intentional about the way I navigated that whole topic because I had a lot of frustration with the church, but it was my world, it was my community, it was my friends, it was my safe place for so many years. While at the same time, like there were reasons that I also felt I had to keep my guard up there because I hadn’t fully processed things about sexuality and they have a lot of opinions about people who are gay or queer. And I think they associate too much like, oh, if you’re gonna talk about sexuality, you’re really just referring to sex. And it was overlooked so much that it’s like, well, the gay identity and the queer identity is not just sex. It’s about human connection, it’s about companionship, relationships, and how you perceive the world. \n\n\tMy goal is to hold them accountable, but also have change. And I believe that there’s change. I feel like I make valid points that they have to consider. They must consider. If they are what they say that they are, which is that they want to do what God wants to guide all of God’s children, there are queer children of God always being made every day in the world, whether they accept it or not, like they are here. I’m hoping that this sets a fire for change and burns down unnecessary walls, and builds bridges in place of that. \n\t\n\t\tAfter everything you’ve experienced, how are you doing now?\t\n\n\tI mean, aside from the anxiety about this book coming out, I’ve been doing great. I know that people will always want to have an opposing opinion just because, that’s just how life is. I’ve watched it in sports. I watched it on “American Idol” with people picking their favorite and they want everyone else to be the bad guy. I’m like, man, does it always have to be like that? \n\n\tI don’t want people to think my dad is this horrible, evil person anymore. I want people to see him as a human being as well, who just did the best that he could under his given circumstances and wanted to help his son be as best as he believed he could be. Those are the things I worry about. But with that said, I feel so just enthusiastic to live my life, to tell my story. I feel emboldened and I feel so confident in my skin and in my message. I’ve spent so many years reflecting on it and thinking about how to say it. I feel like I’m in a great spot.\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

But smaller companies work with law enforcement, so it's another avenue for the FBI to pursue.\n      \n\n          Even if there's not a direct match on a genealogy search, there's still a path to finding a criminal. The profile could closely but not exactly resemble the target, and that could be a relative. We're told the FBI would then look to see if someone on the family tree fits the profile -- a man, between 5'9\" and 5'10\" with an average build who lives in the Tucson area.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          As we reported, although the Pima County Sheriff's Dept. sent DNA to a lab in Florida, the FBI sent DNA to a lab in Arizona.

He basically got his ass kicked until the police showed up.\n      \n    \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n    \n          The \"Transformers\" star was taken to the hospital for his injuries and later arrested and charged with 2 counts of simple battery.\n      \n    \n          The incident is not a good sign for Shia's sobriety journey ... he entered court-mandated rehab after a 2017 arrest in Savannah, Georgia, for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. Since then, he's been intermittently sober ... but has sought long-term sobriety support, including therapy and structured recovery programs.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Shia LaBeouf\n              \n                          \n                Mia Goth\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Breakups\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

In the docs, Demi alleges that not only did Marciano have a reputation for sexual misconduct and predatory behavior ... she claims he was \"proud of it.\"\n      \n    \n          She says Marciano bragged about how his workplaces had to make a \"special policy prohibiting him from sleeping with other employees\" because she claims Marciano said he had \"slept with an 'extraordinary' number of employees.\"\n      \n    \n        Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n      \n    \n          Notably, Marciano actually posted an Instagram reel following his lawsuit filing last year, which featured a trending sound about \"getting even.\"\n      \n    \n          Demi wants Marciano's lawsuit dismissed and for him to pay her attorneys' fees and costs as well.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Demi Engemann\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Rape and Sexual Assault\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

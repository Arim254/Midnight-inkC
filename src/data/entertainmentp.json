    "body": "\n\tNabis Film Berlin, a producer on Sofía Exarchou’s “Animal,” Radu Jude’s “Dracula” and Maureen Fazendeiro’s “The Seasons,” is developing “Michael M.,” the first solo feature of Laura Bierbrauer, whose “Far From Us,” co-directed with Verena Kuri, was selected for the 2019 Berlin Film Festival’s Forum.\n\n\tThe project features among the 12 titles selected for pitching at the upcoming edition of Proyecta, the co-production platform at December’s Ventana Sur, jointly organized by the Cannes Festival’s’ Marché du Film and the San Sebastián Film Festival. \n\t\n\n\tAlso written by Bierbrauer, “Michael M,” is set in part in 1930s Buenos Aires where exiled writer Michael attempts to continue his work, though the overwhelming city make his hands tremble, a synopsis runs. “Decades later, he reenters the life of Argentine artist Mari through a book. She engages with his fantasies and begins to follow him, until one day he hears her whistling.”\n\n\n\tDescribed by Nabis as telling a “story of longing and exile, and of the transformative power of art,” “Michael M.” Will star Romina Power, star of Santiago Mitre’s debut The Student and director and subject of doc-fiction hybrid “Again, Once Again,” a San Sebastián Horizontes Latinos winner, is set to play Mari. Michael will be portrayed by German director-cinematographer Gerd Roscher (“Ritual der schwarzen Sonne”).\n\n\t“Through a single book, the lives of two figures from different times intertwine: Michael, writing in exile in the 1930s, and Mari, seeking refuge in its pages to escape the demands of the present,” said Bierbrauer. “As their paths unfold, memory and presence, fact and illusion merge in montage, shifting spaces, and within the image itself, culminating in their encounter on the streets of contemporary Buenos Aires.”\n\t\n\n\tMore on the Nabis Filmgroup\n\n\tFounded by filmmaker-producer Lukas Valenta Rinner, who directed 2015’s “Parabellum,” selected for Rotterdam main competition and winner of a Jeonju Special Jury Prize, and 2016’s “A Decent Woman,” operating between Austria, Germany, and Argentina, Nabis Filmgroup \n\n\t“We are dedicated to producing bold, author-driven films that expand cinematic form and language. Our focus lies on projects that connect Europe and Latin America, both culturally and artistically, and that embody a strong, personal directorial vision,” Nabis Film Berlin producer Iris Janssen told Variety.   \n\n\tShe added: “Bierbrauer’s new project bridges Argentinian and Central European film cultures, uniting high-profile actors and creative teams from both regions — a synthesis that lies at the heart of Nabis’ artistic identity.”\n\n\tUpcoming films from Nabis include new titles from Kiro Russo and Nelson Carlo de los Santos Arias, “fostering long-term partnerships and a strong reputation for daring, formally inventive cinema with international reach,” Janssen said.\n\n\tNabis is also a producer on Hernán Roselli’s upcoming “Hard-Boiled School.”\n\n\t“Each project is developed around the director’s voice, while leveraging multi-territorial support from European film funds and Latin American partners,” said Janssen. “With the increasingly hermetic structure of public funding in Europe, we are also developing closer collaborations with equity investors and private film funds that share our vision for high-quality, author-driven international features,” she added.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTwo strong indie European players, Spain’s Amore Cine and the Netherlands’ Baldr Film, are boarding “False Poisitive” (“Falso Positivo”), the anticipated sophomore feature by Colombian filmmaker Theo Montoya, following up to “Anhell69,” his acclaimed goth doc-fiction hybrid on the fate of Colombia’s LGBT community.\n\n\t“False Positive” is produced by Montoya’s Colombian outfit Desvío Visual in co-production with France’s Parcelles Films, the recently launched company led by former CG Cinéma executive Romain Blondeau.\n\t\n\n\tThe project figures among the 12 titles selected for pitching at the upcoming edition of Proyecta, the co-production platform presented at December’s Ventana Sur, jointly organized by Cannes’ Marché du Film and the San Sebastián Film Festival. \n\n\n\tHaving won the support of Cannes’ Cinéfondation and Rotterdam’s Hubert Bals Fund, “False Positive” is in advanced development, with shooting pencilled for late 2026.\n\n\tThe project marks a major step forward for Montoya, whose work fuses poetic form and political urgency. \n\n\tSet in early 2000s Colombia, “False Positive” reconstructs one of the country’s darkest episodes — the “false positives” scandal, in which civilians were killed and falsely presented as guerrillas slain in combat.\n\n\tThrough a fragmented, dreamlike structure, the film interlaces multiple perspectives: two siblings who unwittingly recruit victims under the guise of casting for an action film; a trans woman searching for her missing brother and Commander Montoya, a decorated officer preparing a speech titled “Cutting Off the Serpent’s Head.”\n\t\n\n\t“I don’t want to tell what we already know. I want the audience to feel what still hasn’t been understood,” Montoya said, describing the project as a cinematic act of collective mourning.\n\n\tWith Normandy’s Parcelles Films steering the European leg of the project -– following Blondeau’s previous collaborations with emerging auteurs such as Pietro Marcello, Lola Quivoron and Alain Guiraudie –  and Desvío Visual leading from Medellín, “False Positive” is gaining the support of two additional players strengthening its international base.\n\n\tMadrid-based Amore Cine, the company founded by Paz Lázaro, Juan Pablo Félix and Edson Sidonie, has quickly established itself as a bridge between Spain and Latin America.\n\n\tIts recent credits include Chilean supernatural drama “Dæmon,” directed by Valeria Hofmann, teaming with Máquina; and “Morir de Pie,” by María Paz González, in collaboration with Basque Country’s Txintxua Films in Spain and Quijote Films in Chile. \n\n\tAmore’s growing slate also features “The Message,” Iván Fund’s black and white drama, winner of this year’s Silver Berlin Bear Jury Prize.\n\n\tBased in Amsterdam and led by Frank Hoeve, Baldr is building a reputation for fostering innovative filmmakers and forging co-productions that bridge documentary and fiction. Recent highlights include “All We Imagine as Light,” a Cannes Grand Prix winner in 2024; the Sundance player and Oscar-nominated “Soundtrack to a Coup d’État” and “Alpha,” a Venice Days winner. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAmazon Web Services experienced a significant outage on Monday morning, taking Snapchat, Roblox, Reddit and several major banks offline for users in North America and Europe.\n\n\tAs of 11:35 a.m. U.K. time, “most AWS Service operations are succeeding normally now,” according to the cloud computing division’s status page.\n\n\tWebsites and apps affected by the outage included Amazon services like Amazon Music, Prime Video, Ring and Alexa, as well as other platforms such as Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, Reddit, Signal, Duolingo, U.K. bank Lloyds and HM Revenue and Customs. According to BBC News, Downdetector received more than 4 million reports from users around the world for over 500 companies.\n\t\n\n\tThe outage began around 8 a.m. BST and stemmed from Amazon’s US-EAST-1 region in Virginia, the tech giant’s largest hub for web services. By 10:30 a.m., Amazon Web Services reported “significant signs of recovery.” Though the reason for the outage is unclear, in its 11:35 a.m. update Amazon Web Services said “the underlying DNS issue” had been “fully mitigated.” DNS, which stands for Domain Name System, translates website names into IP addresses that are then read by computers and direct users to where they need to go.\n\n\n\t“Some requests may be throttled while we work toward full resolution,” the statement continued. “Additionally, some services are continuing to work through a backlog of events such as Cloudtrail and Lambda. While most operations are recovered, requests to launch new EC2 instances (or services that launch EC2 instances such as ECS) in the US-EAST-1 Region are still experiencing increased error rates. We continue to work toward full resolution.”\n\t\n\n\tDespite much of the internet being affected, not all websites and apps use Amazon Web Services. Google, Meta and X continued to run as normal, with Elon Musk posting on his platform: “X still works.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndian director Muzaffar Ali‘s freshly restored 1981 classic “Umrao Jaan” will be shown outside the country for the first time at Saudi Arabia’s upcoming Red Sea International Film Festival, which has unveiled the lineup of its Treasures strand dedicated to six classic international and Arab films.\n\n\t“Umrao Jaan,” starring susperstar Rekha in her Indian National Film Award-winning performance as a courtesan-poetess in 19th-century Lucknow, has been restored by the National Film Development Corporation-National Film Archive of India under the National Film Heritage Mission.\n\t\n\n\tOther titles in the Treasures section comprise Alfred Hitchcock’s 1944 psychological thriller “Spellbound,” starring Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck, which marks the Red Sea fest’s first film from Martin Scorsese’s The Film Foundation dedicated to global cinema preservation. Then there is Luc Besson’s 1988 cult diving epic “The Big Blue,” making its big-screen debut in Saudi Arabia. For the fest’s first-ever silent film spectacular, the U.K.’s silent film musical specialist Neil Brand will be providing live accompaniment to three silent slapstick shorts from Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy.\n\n\n\tThe Treasures strand will also feature two films by Egyptian director Ahmed Badrakhan, both starring Egyptian singer-actress and international icon Umm Kulthum, considered the Arab world’s greatest singer. Fresh from their restoration by the Red Sea Film Foundation and Egypt’s Media City, Badrakhan’s “Aida” (1942) and “Song of Hope” (1937) will be shown at the Red Sea fest as 4K restored copies for the first time.\n\t\n\n\t“This year’s Treasures lineup spotlights true legends of film, showcasing moments and performances which are immortalized in the cinematic canon brought back to life for local and international audiences,” said Red Sea Film Foundation CEO Faisal Baltyuor in a statement. “All of the titles selected broke new ground with their original releases, and it’s a particular privilege to have played a part in the restoration of two of Umm Kulthum’s most memorable performances, as part of our ongoing commitment to bringing the best of cinema to Saudi Arabia.”\n\n\tThe fifth edition of the fest will run Dec. 4-13 in Jeddah, on the Red Sea’s eastern shore.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBefore he could officially sign on to star in Edgar Wright’s film adaptation of the Stephen King novel “The Running Man,” Glen Powell had to get approval from the legendary author himself.\n\n\tPowell revealed at New York Comic Con (via People) that Wright offered him the lead role of Ben Richards on the condition that King gave him his blessing. “Edgar offered me this movie, and I was like, ‘Yes.’ I’m like, ‘Let’s go…’ And then, like, later that night [Edgar says], ‘By the way, like, you have to be approved by Stephen King. He’s gonna watch ‘Hit Man’ tonight,” Powell recalled.\n\t\n\n\t“And so I had to wait overnight for Stephen King to watch ‘Hit Man’ and hope that I still had the role in the morning. It’s terrible,” he continued. Luckily, King “loved” “Hit Man,” Powell’s 2023 romantic crime comedy directed by Richard Linklater, and agreed that he could take on the role. \n\n\n\tIn “The Running Man,” Powell plays Ben, a working-class man desperate to help his sick daughter who decides to compete on a TV show where “contestants, known as Runners, must survive 30 days while being hunted by professional assassins, with every move broadcast to a bloodthirsty public and each day bringing a greater cash reward,” according to the film’s synopsis. King’s original 1982 novel was first adapted for the big screen in 1987 starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, but Wright said at NYCC that his movie is “more faithful to the book” while incorporating 21st-century elements.\n\n\t“The coolest part about this [film] that I’m just really excited about is Edgar decided to take this [story] — loyal to the book — out in the real world,” Powell added. “Citizens can record [and] report you. They can take you out. So there’s this sort of, like, ever-present feeling of tension that’s throughout the entire movie. It’s relentless.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Running Man” hits theaters on Nov. 14 via Paramount Pictures.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBerlin-based sales company Picture Tree Intl. has acquired worldwide sales rights including Germany and Austria from C-Films to “Hello Betty,” the upcoming feature from director Pierre Monnard, who also directed “Winter Palace,” the first Swiss series co-produced by Netflix.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe film centers on the true story of Emmi Creola, the visionary advertising pioneer who created the Swiss culinary icon Betty Bossi in 1956 — a fictional figure who went on to become a household name across generations and language regions in Switzerland.\n\t\n\n\t“Hello Betty,” which stars Sarah Spale, portrays a woman navigating ambition, creativity and the limitations of a male-dominated society. What began as a clever marketing idea became a cultural phenomenon, shaping the way a nation cooked and viewed modern domesticity.\n\n\n\tProducer Peter Reichenbach of C-Films said, “Everyone in Switzerland knows Betty Bossi. This film finally tells the story of the brilliant woman behind the name. It’s a story with humor, heart, and universal resonance.”\n\n\t“ ‘Hello Betty’ is a rare mix of strong emotional storytelling and commercial accessibility,” added Andreas Rothbauer, managing director of Picture Tree Intl. “It has all the ingredients to travel widely — a charismatic female lead, a fascinating real-life story, and broad audience appeal.”\n\n\tThe film will premiere on Nov. 4, 2025, and will be released nationwide across all language regions of Switzerland starting Nov. 20, through Ascot Elite Entertainment.\n\n\t“Hello Betty” is produced by C-Films in co-production with SRF Swiss Radio and Television, SRG SSR and CH Media TV AG, with support from the Federal Office of Culture, Zurich Filmfund, Cinéforom, Loterie Romande, Stage Pool Focal/Ernst Göhner Foundation and Suissimage, in collaboration with Ascot Elite Entertainment.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFifteen years after Lucca Comics and Games expanded its scope with a dedicated film and TV section, the Italian geek meet held in the medieval Tuscan town of Lucca has upped its game as a global launching pad for premium scripted fare.\n\n\tThis year, Netflix’s final “Stranger Things” season and HBO Max’s “It” prequel “Welcome to Derry,” along with other types of buzzy goods like Japanese video game legend Hideo Kojima’s “Death Stranding 2: On the Beach” are set for launches in the town known for its perfectly preserved 16th and 17th century ramparts. \n\t\n\n\tAs announced, the Duffer Brothers will be attending a fan gathering in Lucca on Halloween along with “Stranger Things” stars Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, and Noah Schnapp.\n\n\n\tIt may be the biggest coup ever scored by the event – which runs Oct. 29-Nov. 2 – though last year Lucca Comics hosted a similarly high-caliber “Squid Game” junket. Basically, every edition this massive meet – attended by more than 200,000 fans – dedicated to fandom, cosplay and the whole world of comics, including movies and TV, manages to gain more international traction.\n\n\tVariety speaks to Lucca Comics director Emanuele Vietina and Giovanni Cova, who is head of Milan-based entertainment marketing company QMI – Cova leads programming of Lucca’s film and TV strand – about why they are particularly proud of their “Stranger Things” score.\n\n\tEmanuele, how significant is it to get this “Stranger Things” fan gathering event on Halloween?\n\n\tEmanuele Vietina: The presence of “Stranger Things” at Lucca marks a high spot for several reasons. Netflix is creating a major narrative around Lucca. Getting [to launch] their top content, places us on a par with the world’s major capitals that we certainly can’t compete with in terms of number of inhabitants. Similarly, being chosen for what is being dubbed the “gran finale” of Hideo Kojima’s “Death Stranding 2: On the Beach” global tour, following stops in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Sydney, Los Angeles, is a major highlight for us. We’ve placed Lucca within a circuit of cities that have populations in the millions. There are these cities, and then there is Lucca with a population of 80,000. The other significant aspect of having Kojima in Lucca is that Kojima Productions certainly revolutionized the video game world, but they also created a touchpoint between the languages of video games and film.\n\t\n\n\tThe Lucca Comics experience has now been turned into a movie by multi-hyphenate Manlio Castagna [see separate story]. Are you pleased with the result?\n\n\tVietina: There have been other films made at festivals, but probably not with the same level of ambition. We hope this one marks something more significant. We sold the rights to make one, or more, [Lucca Comics-themed] movies [to Italian outfit] I Wonder between 2025 and 2030. And we are delighted to be treated not just as content, but as a work of art. It’s a huge recognition for us. The only thing we asked – and we believe Manlio Castagna heeded our call – is that Lucca Comics and Games be used to tell timeless stories that frame universal values. This is truly the beauty of this project, since these stories can speak to kids from Manila, Melbourne, Toronto and Stockholm. That’s because everyone plays the same games: everyone lives within the same emotional framework.\n\n\tLucca is synonymous with cosplaying. What are the biggest parades going to be this year?\n\n\tVietina: In terms of parades, the “Death Stranding” world is clearly revving up as a frontrunner. Inevitably, something big is brewing for Nov. 1st for “Death Stranding.” But also for “Critical Role” [the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game]. Matthew Mercer’s genius was to create a broadcast on Twitch that later became an animated TV show on Amazon Prime. So Kojima and Mercer, the two great gods of gaming and video games, will certainly get the most important parades.\n\n\tGiovanni, How is Lucca’s rapport with the U.S. studios and streamers evolving?\n\n\tGiovanni Cova: We are still split roughly 50/50 in the sense that both studios and streamers invest in this event. Disney has always been a big player at Lucca, and they are a bit of both. This year it’s a bit more on the Disney+ side [with previews of “Twisted Wonderland: The Animated Series” and “Cat’s Eye”], although Disney’s [action sci-fi film] “Predator: Badlands” is also launching. So, on the one hand, we have the studios that focus on a specific title, depending on the year. And on the other, we have the streamers. Both Netflix and Prime Video have a big presence. Prime, among other things, is experimenting with Lucca to launch its unscripted format “The Traitors” in Italy. I think it will go very well because the show lends itself to the idea of a game being played in Lucca. So we are happy that Amazon has been bold enough to do this. We are also glad to have Crunchyroll because they choose very few events of this type around the world and they really believe in Lucca. This year Sky [the Comcast-owned pay TV platform] also has a big presence thanks to “Welcome to Derry.” They will use Lucca to its full potential, first with screenings of the show’s two related movies,”It” and “Chapter Two.” And then the world premiere of an episode of the show, followed by an immersive experience on a “Derry Bus” that will transport fans to the mysterious town where the chilling disappearances in the series take place.\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n\tPictured below, from left to right, Emanuele Vietina and Giovanni Cova\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Lucca Comics/\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAna Elena Tejera’s “Culebra Cut,” Theo Montoya’s “False Positive” and Roxana Stroe’s “Houses Are Silent” feature among the lineup at the upcoming Proyecta co-production platform, running  during early December’s Ventana Sur 2025 in Buenos Aires.\n\n\tNow on its 8th edition, Proyecta — a joint initiative between Ventana Sur, Cannes’ Marché du Film and the San Sebastián Film Festival — showcases 12 new features, all first or second films, confirming its reputation as one of Latin America’s key gateways to Europe.\n\t\n\n\tAmong this year’s highlights, “Culebra Cut” unites Panama’s Mestizo, France’s Fulgurance and Capicua Films from Chile in one of the strongest international alliances of the selection. The project has just added Arte France Cinéma as a co-producer, following a path that already includes selection for the Torino Feature Lab, Venice Production Bridge and Ibermedia support.\n\n\n\t“False Positive” marks a step-up for Theo Montoya, building on the success of his award-winning doc hybrid “Anhell69.” His company Desvío Visual leads a four-country co-production with Parcelles Films in France, Spain’s Amore and Netherlands’ Baldr. Backed by Cannes Cinéfondation and Rotterdam’s Hubert Bals Fund, the project arrives in Buenos Aires with festival buzz and strong market momentum.\n\n\t“Houses Are Silent,” which earned its Ventana Sur invitation at San Sebastián’s Europe–Latin America Co-Production Forum, extends Bucharest-based Atelier de Film’s reach through a Romania–Bolivia partnership. Gabi Suciu’s company has produced San Sebastián Golden Shell 2021 winner “Blue Moon,” and Cannes Directors’ Fortnight player “When Night Meets Dawn.”  \n\t\n\n\tRunning Dec. 1-5, this year’s Ventana Sur will see Proyecta filmmakers tackle political ghosts, ecological loss and personal reinvention. Several projects blend hybrid aesthetics — animation, performance, archival material — with a storytelling precision aimed at both festivals and buyers.\n\n\tProyecta also offers incentives designed to fast-track production and visibility. The San Sebastián Film Festival Invitation grants two producers accreditation, accommodation and access to the festival’s industry activities. The Sideral Cinema Award ensures a €10,000 ($11,634) pre-buy for one project’s international rights, while the Sørfond Pitching Forum Award will take one producer to Norway’s 2026 Sørfond Pitching Forum, with travel and accommodation covered.\n\n\tThe 2025 Proyecta projects selection: \n\n\t“The Boa and the Bamboo” (Maitane Carballo Alonso; Spain, Switzerland)\n\n\tSet deep in Brazil’s Maranhão region, the film follows an Awá-Guajá couple who adopt an orphaned monkey as sacred kin while their forest is devoured by industry. Drawing on Indigenous cosmology and blending animation with oral storytelling, it explores resilience amid ecological collapse. Produced by the Basque Country’s Gariza Films (“20,000 Species of Bees”) in collaboration with Swiss company MediaFisch, the project played at San Sebastián’s Europe–Latin America Co-Production Forum 2025.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Boa and the Bamboo\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Culebra Cut” (“Corte Culebra,” Ana Elena Tejera; Panama, France, Chile)\n\n\tTejera reimagines Panama’s hidden history through a feverish odyssey in the former U.S. Canal Zone, where ghosts of the displaced linger in the jungle. With Arte France Cinéma now on board, the project is also backed by CNC, Ibermedia and the World Cinema Fund. Chile’s Capicua Films has joined as a minority partner. Tejera’s camera drifts between the political and the dreamlike. “The film moves through low-lit spaces where latent violence rubs against tenderness,” she notes.\n\n\t“False Positive” (“Falso Positivo,” Theo Montoya; Colombia, France, Spain, Netherlands)\n\n\tFollowing the acclaimed “Anhell69,” Montoya delves into Colombia’s darkest chapter with a poetic reconstruction of the “false positives” killings. Produced by Desvío Visual with Parcelles, Amore and Baldr, the film blends memory, mourning and surrealism. “I don’t want to tell what we already know. I want the audience to feel what still hasn’t been understood,” Montoya says. Supported by the Cannes Film festival’s Cinéfondation residency program and the Hubert Bals Fund.\n\t\n\n\t“God’s Favorite Girl” (Diego Ulloa Alvear; Spain, Ecuador)\n\n\tA 16-year-old girl invents Marian apparitions to cope with her parents’ divorce — only to trigger a nationwide religious frenzy. The dark comedy marks a further international step for Spain’s Funicular Films, the label behind acclaimed series “This Is Not Sweden.” Co-produced with Abaca Films in Ecuador, it won top honors at ESCAC Opera Prima Lab and Guadalajara’s BDC Award. “A satire about faith, fame and the absurdity of modern belief,” says producer Marta Baldó.\n\n\t“Goodbye, Boys” (“Adeus, meninos,” Sacha Amaral; Brazil, Portugal)\n\n\tDescribed as a lyrical journey through fractured childhood, Amaral’s debut follows two brothers navigating unstable homes after their mother’s death. Developed at the Sam Spiegel Film Lab in Venice, the project blends social realism with visual poetry and, its makers say, an emotional precision. “I’m drawn to explore the justice of childhood, how kids perceive cruelty and affection,” Amaral says. Co-produced by Brazil’s Quadrophenia Films and Portugal’s Crim.\n\n\t“Hermosa no es como antes” (Kattia G. Zúñiga; Costa Rica, Chile)\n\n\tA second Costa Rican project, in which Paz feels the heat of the tropics, perimenopause and contained anger — all at once. That inner fire pushes her to dance, shout and set boundaries in her life and in the privileged beach community she inhabits, a beautiful place stifled by tourism. Presented at Cinélatino Toulouse under the title “Rabiosa” and at Tres Puertos Panamá, the project has backing from both Costa Rican and Chilean cultural funds.\n\n\t“Houses Are Silent” (Roxana Stroe; Romania, Bolivia)\n\n\tIn a secluded Bolivian Mennonite colony, a 16-year-old girl becomes pregnant after an assault she can barely recall. Developed by Atelier de Film, the project won its Ventana Sur invitation at the San Sebastián’s Europe–Latin America Co-Production Forum. “Silence can protect tradition but also hide pain,” Stroe says.\n\n\t“Love & Rebellion” (Sarah Miro Fischer; Germany, Colombia)\n\n\tIn Colombia, an 18-year-old visits her estranged mother — a former guerrilla turned bride-to-be — hoping to find a revolutionary heroine but instead encounters silence, regret and love unspoken. Produced by Unafilm in Germany, the film explores the spaces between memory and myth, fear and responsibility, and what it means to grow up in the shadow of unfinished ideals, its backers say.\n\t\n\n\t“The Lovers Who Didn’t Know Too Much” (“Los amantes que no sabían demasiado,” Baltasar Albrecht, Gastón del Porto; Argentina)\n\n\tA Paraná River trip turns fatal when a body falls onto a couple’s boat, pulling them into a spiral of guilt and obsession. Produced by MuchaSiesta with El Cielo Cine, and backed by the Argentine INCAA’s 2024 Feature Award, the project is “a love letter to ’70s genre films — an auteur thriller built over curiosity, coincidence and danger,” says producer Arturo Castro Godoy.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lovers Who Didn’t Know Too Much\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Michael M.” (Laura Bierbrauer; Germany, Argentina)\n\n\tTwo souls separated by time — a 1930s exiled writer and a modern artist — find each other through a book that transcends eras, interlacing memory and imagination in a reflection on exile, creativity and longing. The film extends Nabis Film Berlin’s cross-continental mission, joining producers Iris Janssen, Lukas Valenta Rinner and Yael Svoboda. Supported by Germany’s BKM Fund.\n\n\t“The Other Voice” (“La otra voz,” Agustina Pérez Rial; Argentina, Spain, France)\n\n\tDrawing from an unseen private archive, the film crafts an intimate portrait of Mercedes Sosa, Latin America’s legendary protest singer. Letters and photographs from her exile years reveal a woman caught between fame and displacement. Co-produced by Gaman Cine, Fiørd Studio and Lorolo and supported by the IDFA Bertha Fund.\n\n\t“Spells to Revive a Witch” (“Hechizos para revivir una bruja,” Natalia Solórzano Vásquez; Costa Rica)\n\n\tA casting call to portray a 1960s fortune teller turns into a ritual of remembrance in Solórzano’s debut. The film explores how women reclaim erased histories through reenactment and imagination. Supported by the Costa Rican Film Fund, DocLisboa’s Arché and the Rueda Residency, it reflects Sputnik Films’ focus on hybrid, auteur-driven cinema. Producer Mariana Murillo calls it “a film about memory as performance — where remembering itself becomes a political gesture.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSpells to Revive a Witch\n\t\n\n\n",

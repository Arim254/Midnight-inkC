    "body": "\n\tIndonesian filmmaker Joko Anwar has been awarded the Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government, receiving the prestigious cultural honor at a ceremony held at the French Ministry of Culture in Paris.\n\n\tFrench Minister of Culture Rachida Dati presented the award, recognizing Anwar’s two-decade career and his impact on both Indonesian and international cinema. The honor places the director among a distinguished list of recipients that includes Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, Tim Burton, Pedro Almodóvar, Meryl Streep, Cate Blanchett and Miyazaki Hayao.\n\t\n\n\t“He established a unique artistic signature, exploring collective fears, social tensions, myths, and beliefs that shape our collective imagination,” Dati said. “His filmography spans a wide range of genres with rare freedom. He reinvented these genres with deep narrative vision and a singular aesthetic – blending traditional culture, social commentary, and gripping suspense.”\n\n\n\tDuring his acceptance speech, Anwar reflected on his approach to filmmaking. “Through stories packaged in horror, thrillers, or comedies, I try to talk about things that are often difficult to discuss directly: injustice, power, humans and the environment in which they live,” he said, noting that many of his works emerge from concerns about social and ecological issues.\n\n\tThe award arrives as Anwar prepares to release his twelfth feature, “Ghost in the Cell,” a horror-comedy co-produced by Barunson E&A, which is also handling worldwide sales. Set for release in 2026, the film uses a prison setting as a metaphor while addressing themes of environmental degradation, power and moral responsibility.\n\t\n\n\t“‘Ghost in the Cell’ is part of the same conversation I’ve always wanted to build through my films,” Anwar said. “Using genre to entertain, but also to encourage audiences to think about the world we live in.”\n\n\tThe Ordre des Arts et des Lettres represents one of the highest cultural honors bestowed by the French government, recognizing significant contributions to arts and literature internationally.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Woods, who has been vocally pro-Donald Trump, is speaking out against the “distasteful” comments made about Rob Reiner.\n\n\tWoods, who starred in Reiner’s “Ghosts of Mississippi” in 1996, opened up about his late friend during an appearance on Fox News on Monday night, revealing that he was at a low point and landing that job turned it around.\n\n\t“Rob literally saved my career and really put me back on track in a way that was so important and rewarding in my life. He really fought for me when a studio didn’t want me in a movie,” Woods said. “I went from really being basically out of a job to getting an Academy Award nomination, and I give all the credit to Rob.”\n\t\n\n\tGetting choked up multiple times during the interview with Jesse Watters, Woods explained that friends would often ask him how he could be friends with the director, despite their opposing political views; Reiner was a liberal activist, while Woods has been outspoken about supporting Trump.\n\n\t“I judge people by how they treat me, and Rob Reiner was a Godsend in my life. We got along great, we loved each other… He was always on my side,” Woods said. “When people would say to me, ‘What do you think of his politics?’ I would say, ‘I think Rob Reiner is a great patriot. Do I agree on many of his ideas on how that patriotism should be enacted, to celebrate the America that we both love? No. He doesn’t agree with me either, but he also respects my patriotism. We had a different path to the same destination, which was a country we both love.”\n\n\tHe added, “Because you disagree with people doesn’t mean that you have to hate people.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter noting that Reiner was “a real thinker” and “a lot of people just don’t think anymore,” Woods brought up how Reiner spoke about Charlie Kirk after he was assassinated in September. (In his last interview, Reiner was asked about Kirk’s death, and he called it “horrible,” adding, “I don’t care what your political beliefs are. That’s not acceptable. That’s not a solution to solving problems.”)\n\n\t“I knew Charlie Kirk, I supported him… people said some such horrible things, and Rob did not,” Woods said on Monday night. “When people say horrible things about Rob right now, I find it, quite frankly, infuriating and distasteful. Did I agree with his politics? I did not. Did I love him as I friend, as an artist, as an icon of Hollywood, and as a patriot? I most certainly did, and I am just absolutely devastated.”\n\n\tReiner and his wife, Michele Reiner, were murdered on Sunday, December 14, in their home in Brentwood, Calif. Following the deaths, Trump posted on TruthSocial that the director “passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.”\n\n\tIn a press conference later that day, he added, “I wasn’t a fan of his at all. He was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned. … I thought he was very bad for our country.”\n\n\tWatch Woods’ segment below:\n\n🚨 MUST WATCH: Legendary Actor JAMES WOODS gets EMOTIONAL when talking about ROB REINER’S MURDER 🚨“Rob literally SAVED my CAREER and really put me back on track in a way that was so important and rewarding in my life” 🤯“People would go, ‘How is it that you and Rob Reiner… pic.twitter.com/XTCc0LYkfR— Jesse Watters (@JesseBWatters) December 16, 2025\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has canceled “Boots” after just one season, Variety has learned. The coming-of-age queer drama series debuted on the streamer on Oct. 9.\n\n\tExecutive produced by Norman Lear, who greenlighted the show back in 2023, and created by Andy Parker, “Boots” was based on Greg Cope White’s book “The Pink Marine.” Miles Heizer starred as Cameron Cope, a disillusioned, closeted ‘90s teen who signs up for the Marine Corps with his best friend Ray McAffey, played by Liam Oh. Despite the unwelcoming environment (LGBTQ people were banned from the military at that time), the pair grow into themselves and form lifelong friendships with their fellow recruits as they navigate the social and physical hazards of boot camp.\n\t\n\n\tOther cast members include Ana Ayora, Blake Burt, Cedrick Cooper, Dominic Goodman, Nicholas Logan, Kieron Moore, Angus O’Brien, Rico Paris, Max Parker, Vera Farmiga, Brandon Tyer Moore and Mattie Liptak.\n\n\n\tDuring a recent sitdown with Variety, Heizer said the possibilities for queer stories in the military are endless. He shared his hopes for many more seasons.\n\n\t“There are a lot of stories to tell, from more of Greg’s different experiences in the Marines to Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, to when it was repealed,” he said. “I would do it for 10 seasons if they let us.”\n\n\tJennifer Cecil served as showrunner and executive producer. Series creator Parker served as co-showrunner and executive producer. Rachel Davidson, Peter Hoar, Scott Hornbacher and Brent Miller also served as executive producers. Todd Lewis and Cyndi Brenner produced the show\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Momsen revealed in Vulture’s oral history on “How the Grinch Saved Christmas” that Jim Carrey once stopped production in the middle of filming when a stunt involving his child co-star nearly harmed her. Momsen was 7 years old when she filmed “Grinch,” which marked her feature film debut in a major Hollywood studio movie. \n\n\t“I remember when we were shooting the scene coming down the mountain on the sled. It was this real sled that was up on a giant spring that was being controlled and moving from side to side, very aggressively,” Momsen told Vulture. “Jim is leaning over and being extravagant Jim. There was a moment where I almost fell out of the sled, and he freaked out. He called cut and started checking in on me. I was having a great time. I was laughing; I wasn’t thinking about the fact that I just almost fell very high off the ground.\n\t\n\n\t“I always felt really safe with Jim,” Momsen continued. “I liked being around him. At such a young age, to watch an artist who is that serious at what they’re doing even while playing this very over-the-top character, it was clear to me how much he was putting into it and how much of an artist he was.”\n\n\n\tCarrey told Vulture that he could tell instantly that Momsen was “an incredibly precocious child” and “smart beyond her years” when they first met before filming on the “Grinch” movie started, adding: “Her comedy timing was impeccable. A total pro. I don’t think she ever went up on a line or missed a cue or anything like that.”\n\n\tMomsen “never knew what Jim looked like” in real life, as she only ever saw him in full Grinch makeup when they were filming scenes together. The first time she actually met the real Jim Carrey was at the film’s premiere. The two recently made headlines after they reunited in November at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony and posed together for photos. It was the first time Momsen and Carrey saw each other in 25 years.\n\t\n\n\t“I turned around in the hallway, and she was standing there,” Carrey told Vulture about the unexpected reunion. “I don’t know if she had heels or not, but she’s towering. I’m going, ‘What?’ She has a really powerful manner. I was so glad she’s done so well for herself. She’s been through some challenges in her life and come out the other side. It was very exciting to see her again. And she brought me a Crunchie, which is my favorite chocolate bar. That was awesome.”\n\n\tHead over to Vulture’s website to read the full “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” oral history.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJoe Ely, the singer-songwriter who helped drive a new wave of Texas-based music that united rock and country fans in the 1980s and beyond, died Monday. The cause of death was complications from Lewy Body Dementia, Parkinson’s disease and pneumonia. \n\n\tAn announcement from the family said that Ely died at his home in Taos, New Mexico, with his wife and manager, Sharon, and daughter, Marie, at this side.\n\n\n\tEly had announced his diagnosis of Lewy body dementia and Parkinson’s in a Facebook post on Sept. 9, “not to dwell in hardship, but to bring understanding, awareness and hope through the healing power of music,” he and his wife said in a statement at the time.\n\t\n\n\t“My hero… my template… my friend… Joe Ely passed today,” tweeted Monte Warden, of another pioneering roots-rock act to rise up in that era, the Wagoneers. “He means as much to me as Buddy, Elvis or Don Everly. Such an artist. Texan. I’m just…heartbroken.”\n\n\t“Joe Ely performed American roots music with the fervor of a true believer who knew music could transport souls,” said Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. “His distinctive musical style could only have emerged from Texas, with its southwestern blend of honky-tonk, rock & roll, roadhouse blues, western swing, and conjunto.” While hailing Ely’s long catalog of recordings, Young said that “his true measure came through in the dynamic intensity of his powerhouse live performances, where he could stand his ground aside fellow zealots Bruce Springsteen, who recorded duets with Ely, and the Stones and the Clash, who took Ely on tour as an opening act.”\n\t\n\n\tEly was recognized as one of the more poetic souls of the Texas-rooted country-rock scene to rise up in the late ’70s and ’80s, but his shows often turned into sweaty rave-ups, as if Willie Nelson were overtaken by the spirit of rockabilly.\n\n\tIn 1999, Modern Twang writer David Goodman called the Lubbock-bred Ely “the consummate alternative country artist of the last 25 years,” and the passage of another quarter-century and change since that remark was made has not dimmed the accuracy of the description, in the minds of many roots-rock aficionados.\n\n\tA famous fan, Bruce Springsteen, said of Ely, “I’ve been blessed to sing on his records and be onstage with Joe on occasion and the only thing I can say is: Thank God he wasn’t born in New Jersey. I would have had a lot more of my work cut out for me.”\n\n\tHowever much his music was country-based, at least in its earliest stages, Ely was beloved by several generations of rockers, many of whom first discovered him in plum spots opening for the biggest artists of the day, at their behest. Forty-five years ago this week, Ely was working as a support act for the Rolling Stones on a stadium tour, and he is equally renowned and remembered for his stint opening for the Clash. He also opened for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers 17 times, along with acts including Stevie Nicks, Linda Ronstadt, the Pretenders, the Kinks and Jimmy Cliff.\n\n\tThe fans he made doing those warmup gigs tended to stay fans throughout the decades, well after the fame by association of being favored by the Stones had worn off. \n\n\tHis best-known album may have been “Musta Notta Gotta Lotta,” which was the fourth recording he put out with MCA Records, with whom he signed in the 1970s. Earlier albums, including 1977’s self-titled debut, 1978’s “Honky Tonk Masquerade” and 1979’s “Down on the Drag,” may have been just as good, and produced at least as many classic country songs. But it was the harder-rocking tone of “Musta Notta…” — along with all those gigs with the superstars — that kicked his career into gear with a wider audience.\n\n\tEly’s mercurial streak did not mean that he limited his output to “outlaw country.” Indeed, with his next album, 1984’s “Hi-Res,” he looked to broaden his sound beyond his essential roots appeal. But the reception to the departure this new music represented was mixed, and he soon parted ways with MCA, although he and the company would reunite in the ’90s.\n\t\n\n\tOther career highlights included “Lord of the Highway” from 1987, the first of two albums he would cut for Hightone Records. The most recent of his 17 studio albums was “Love and Freedom,” released earlier this year.\n\n\tHis signature songs included “Honky Tonk Masquerade,” “Fingernails,” “Dallas,” “Hard Livin’,” “Wishin’ for You” and “She Never Spoke Spanish to Me.” \n\n\tEly was born in Amarillo and moved to Lubbock at 11. He formed the Flatlanders in 1971 with Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Butch Hancock, whose material he recorded during his later solo career, as well. They released only one album during their initial lifespan, but reunited for “Now Again” in 2002 and a followups in 2004, 2009 and 2021.\n\n\tAfter the Flatlanders broke up after one album, he had a stint working for the Ringling Brothers Circus, then found employment as a roofer. Forming his own band in Austin in the mid-’70s, he played the venue that would later become Stubb’s, alternating nights with Stevie Ray Vaughan.\n\n\tIt was Jerry Jeff Walker’s recommendation that was said to have led to the MCA signing in 1975.\n\n\tEly’s association with the Clash extended beyond his opening their gigs. He sang backup on “Should I Stay or Should I Go?,” and he was mentioned by name in the “Sandinista!” song “If Music Could Talk” (“Well there ain’t no better blend than Joe Ely and his Texas Men”).\n\n\tIn the 1990s, he formed a short-lived supergroup called the Buzzin’ Cousins with John Mellencamp, John Prine and James McMurtry, which resulted in his sole Grammy nomination.\n\n\tHis “Hi-Res” album in the mid-’80s was not his only more experimental work. His album “B4 84” was reported to be one of the first albums ever recorded on an Apple II desktop computer, and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs wrote the liner notes.\n\n\tHe was inducted into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame in 2022. Prior to that, in 2007, Ely was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for Live Performance by the Americana Music Association; named the Texas State Musician for 2016; and, in that same year, inducted into the Texas Heritage Songwriters’ Association Hall of Fame that same year.\n\n\tHis family said that more information would be forthcoming in the coming days.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKevin Bacon was on the verge of tears as he posted an emotional video tribute on Instagram to Rob Reiner, who directed him in the 1992 legal drama “A Few Good Men.” It was nominated for four Oscars.\n\n\tReiner and his wife Michele were found dead in their Los Angeles home Sunday, and their son Nick is being held on suspicion of murder. \n\n\tBacon co-starred as a young Marine captain in the film, which starred Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise. “I’m not sure how to do this,” Bacon starts out in the video, sounding emotional. “But Rob Reiner gave me a job in ‘A Few Good Men.’ Sometime in the ’90s, I guess it was. I was over the moon to get that job — people may or may not know but ‘This Is Spinal Tap’ is my all-time favorite movie and when he called me, I was just so thrilled.\n\t\n\n\t“The making of that movie was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had on a set,” Bacon continued. “He was so fun. It really comes down from the top, you know? You can set a tone where people feel like we are working hard but also working hard in a safe and pleasant and fun situation. You know, we had lunch together every day. I’ve never done that with a director before or since, I’d never gone to have lunch. And Michele would be there, and the two of them were so great together. Kyra would come by, she was pregnant, and bring Travis. It was a magical time.\n\n\t“So I’m just sending love to everybody that knew him because I know that everyone’s hurting today,” Bacon concludes.\n\n\n\tBacon’s co-star Demi Moore also had some heartfelt thoughts about her “A Few Good Men” director. \n\t\n\n\t“There are no words to truly express the unfathomable devastation of losing Rob and Michelle Reiner,” Moore wrote on Instagram. “Our kids grew up together, we worked together, and as our lives intertwined personally and professionally I will always cherish the moments and memories of what we shared.\n\n\t“They were amazing people and wonderful parents who gave of themselves to make the world a better place. My heart, thoughts, and prayers are with their family, friends, and all that are affected by this tragedy.”\n\n\n\tKiefer Sutherland, whose first film with Reiner was “Stand By Me” before he went on to play a second lieutenant in “A Few Good Men,” said in a statement, “Like so many, my heart was broken today when I heard the news about Rob Reiner and his wonderful wife, Michele. Rob was one of the kindest gentleman I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with, when I was very young he gave me an opportunity that changed my life, and I will forever be grateful.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump has followed through on his threat to sue the BBC over the U.K. broadcaster’s documentary that edited his comments during the",
    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump has followed through on his threat to sue the BBC over the U.K. broadcaster’s documentary that edited his comments during the rally leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\tThe lawsuit was filed Monday by Trump’s lawyers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami, alleging defamation and violation of Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. Trump’s lawsuit demands no less than $5 billion in damages for each of the two counts, amounting to more than $10 billion total.\n\t\n\n\t“This action concerns a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump, which was published in a BBC Panorama documentary, that was fabricated and aired by the Defendants one week before the 2024 Presidential Election in a brazen attempt to interfere in and influence the Election’s outcome to President Trump’s detriment,” the 33-page complaint reads. (A copy is available at this link.)\n\n\n\tThe Trump lawsuit says, “The BBC, faced with overwhelming and justifiable outrage on both sides of the Atlantic, has publicly admitted its staggering breach of journalistic ethics, and apologized, but has made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses. Accordingly, President Trump brings this action for compensatory and punitive damages for the extensive reputational harm inflicted upon him by the Defendants.”\n\n\tThe BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump’s lawsuit.\n\t\n\n\tBBC chair Samir Shah last month told staff in an email that the broadcaster was “determined to fight” any Trump lawsuit. “There is a lot being written, said and speculated upon about the possibility of legal action, including potential costs or settlements,” Shah said in the email, as reported by Sky News. Shah wrote, “I want to be very clear with you — our position has not changed. There is no basis for a defamation case and we are determined to fight this.”\n\n\tThe episode of BBC’s “Panorama” documentary program in question, titled “Trump: A Second Chance?”, aired in Oct. 24, 2024 — but only erupted into a firestorm after a leaked memo published in early November 2025 by The Telegraph accused the broadcaster of editing Trump’s speech to make it sound like he encouraged the Jan. 6 riots.\n\n\tA BBC review found that “Panorama” edited Trump’s Jan. 6 speech to be: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not gonna have a country anymore” — and that the part beginning with “and we fight” came 54 minutes after “we’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be with you.”\n\n\tTrump’s lawsuit cited the BBC’s internal review, which concluded that there had been “a string of incidents that demonstrate serious bias in the corporation’s reporting.”\n\n\tThe resulting scandal led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and CEO of news Deborah Turness. \n\n\tA previous letter from Trump’s lawyers to the BBC demanded a full retraction of the documentary, an apology and payment to “appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused.” Last month, the BBC issued an apology to Trump but refused to offer compensation. In a Nov. 14 statement, the corporation said, “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.” The BBC also said it has no plans to rebroadcast the “Trump: A Second Chance?” documentary on any BBC platforms.\n\n\tIn seeking to establish the U.S. District Court’s jurisdiction over the matter, Trump’s lawsuit notes that the U.S. president is a citizen of Florida while all defendants “are citizens of the United Kingdom.” However, the suit claims, “during the operative period alleged in this Complaint,” the BBC “engaged in substantial and not isolated business activities in Florida” — including through the bbc.com website and the U.S.-based BritBox streaming service. The “Panorama” episode in question was available via BritBox; in addition, Florida residents likely used VPN software to access the documentary via the BBC iPlayer (normally restricted to access in the U.K.), the lawsuit alleges.\n\t\n\n\tMoreover, “as plainly seen in the very beginning of the Panorama Documentary, the BBC’s producers and a film crew contracted by the BBC’s producers traveled to Florida to film significant portions of the Documentary at and around President Trump’s home, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida, spending substantial amounts of time in Florida and capturing extensive footage on and around the grounds of Mar-a-Lago, and surrounding areas, that the BBC ultimately used in the Documentary,” the Trump lawsuit alleges.\n\n\tTrump has a long history of suing news outlets alleging defamation and attacking the media.\n\n\tTrump recently sued the New York Times, alleging its reporting about his finances and business career defamed him, in a lawsuit seeking at least $15 billion in damages. (Trump lawyers refiled the suit in October after a judge had dismissed the original complaint for being “tedious and burdensome.”) The New York Times said Trump’s lawsuit was without merit and called it “merely an attempt to stifle independent reporting and generate PR attention.”\n\n\tSeparately, Trump this summer sued the Wall Street Journal, its parent companies Dow Jones and News Corp, Rupert Murdoch and two Journal reporters, alleging defamation over a WSJ story that described details of a birthday letter Trump sent in 2003 to Jeffrey Epstein. According to the lawsuit, Trump is demanding “not less than $10 billion” on two counts of defamation, for at least $20 billion total. Lawyers for the Wall Street Journal filed a motion to dismiss the suit, saying that Trump’s suit should be thrown out because the WSJ article in question “is true,” noting that in response to a congressional subpoena, “Epstein’s estate produced the Birthday Book, which contains the letter bearing the bawdy drawing and [Trump’s] signature, exactly as The Wall Street Journal reported.”\n\n\tIn 2024, Trump also sued ABC News and CBS News’ “60 Minutes.” Disney (parent of ABC News) and Paramount Global (parent of CBS) each paid $16 million to settle the cases. Trump sued ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos after Stephanopoulos falsely asserted on air that Trump had been found liable in a court case for raping writer E. Jean Carroll; in fact, a jury found Trump guilty of sexual abuse of Carroll. In the “60 Minutes” case, Trump had alleged a pre-election interview with former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris was deceptively edited and thereby interfered with the 2024 election.\n",

    "body": "\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWelcome to Variety Awards HQ — your weekly command center for the Oscars race.\n\n\n\tIt’s Dec. 15, 2025, and this edition is dedicated to the magnificent Rob Reiner.\n\n\tThe news out of Los Angeles is devastating. Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer, are no longer with us, and the shock of that loss still hasn’t settled in. In moments like this, language feels inadequate. I won’t focus on the tragedy. Instead, all we can do is look back — at the work, at the moments, at the stories — and say thank you.\n\n\n\tThe first Rob Reiner film I ever saw was “A Few Good Men.” I was too young to understand the mechanics of military law or the intricacies of courtroom procedure, but I understood the electricity of conviction. The thrill of watching ideas collide. The power of words when they felt sharp as a blade.\n\t\n\n\t“You can’t handle the truth!”\n\n\tJack Nicholson roared onto the screen, and even then, it felt like a cultural moment being born in real time. Reiner received his sole Academy Award nomination as a producer on “A Few Good Men” (1992), a fitting recognition for a film that crackles with intelligence and moral urgency. Nominated for best picture, it didn’t win the top prize, but it didn’t need to. The film entered the bloodstream of American cinema and never left.\n\n\tFrom that moment on, I was hooked.\n\n\tReiner’s career is one of the most quietly astonishing in modern Hollywood history. Not because he chased prestige — on the contrary, he chased truth across genres that rarely get that kind of respect.\n\n\t“Stand by Me” (1986) remains one of the purest coming-of-age films ever made. It understands childhood not as nostalgia, but as a fragile, fleeting state of grace. “I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve,” the film tells us. Neither did we.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSTAND BY ME, Director Rob Reiner on set, 1986.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe train bridge. The leeches. The way he captured River Phoenix, one of my all-time favorite actors — it’s all encapsulated in a film that meets you where you are and stays with you long after.\n\t\n\n\t“The Princess Bride” (1987) created joy without irony. Romance without embarrassment. Humor without cruelty.\n\n\t“Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.”\n\n\tWhat once struggled at the box office became a generational heirloom, passed down like a favorite bedtime story, reminding us that sincerity is not something to outgrow.\n\n\t“When Harry Met Sally…” (1989) changed romantic comedies forever, proving they could be adult, literate and honest. Nora Ephron’s dialogue sings, and Reiner’s direction let it breathe. The fake orgasm at Katz’s Deli. The way the film builds to Harry’s New Year’s Eve confession. It showed the entire genre what was possible.\n\n\tReiner carried that belief into “The American President” (1995), offering a vision of leadership rooted in decency, eloquence and moral clarity. It was romantic, yes, but also aspirational, planting the seeds for what would later grow into “The West Wing.” It reminded us what politics could sound like when it aimed higher.\n\n\tReiner could terrify us too. “Misery” (1990) turned psychological horror into something intimate and unbearable, and Kathy Bates’ Oscar-winning performance remains one of the most indelible in Academy history.\n\n\tAnd then there was “This Is Spinal Tap” (1984), a film so inventive it essentially created the mockumentary, forever changing the language of comedy. It goes to eleven, and it always will.\n\n\tBefore directing, Reiner became part of television history as Michael “Meathead” Stivic on “All in the Family,” earning two Emmy Awards and helping redefine what a sitcom could confront and contain. Later, he co-founded Castle Rock Entertainment, the company behind “The Shawshank Redemption,” “Seinfeld” and so many other landmarks of film and television.\n\n\tWhat made Reiner special was never the trophies. It was his belief that comedy could carry heartbreak, that drama could still be funny, and that genre was not a limitation — it was an invitation. He trusted viewers to be smart, curious and open. He trusted all of us. Not many filmmakers do that.\n\n\tSo thank you for “A Few Good Men,” the film that started it all for me. Thank you for “Stand by Me,” “The Princess Bride,” “When Harry Met Sally…” and “The American President.” Thank you for teaching us that love can be earnest, friendship can be eternal, and truth, no matter how uncomfortable, is worth fighting for.\n\t\n\n\tYour light lives on in every rewatch, every line read aloud, every perfect moment you gave us. That is immortality. And that is what lasts.\n\n\tRest peacefully, Rob Reiner. We’ll love you forever.\n\n\tPlease read my colleague Peter Debruge’s beautiful tribute on Variety as well.\n\t\n\t\t‘Sinners’ Turns the Town Red With SAG and Academy Power Plays\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Sinners” continued its high-profile awards-season rollout with back-to-back industry events targeting key voting bodies.\n\n\tOn Sunday, Dec. 14, Viola Davis moderated a SAG-AFTRA Foundation Q&A at the Meryl Streep Center for the Performing Arts, joined by actors Michael B. Jordan and Wunmi Mosaku, along with casting director Francine Maisler. The event drew a packed house of SAG-AFTRA members, underscoring the film’s strong appeal with actors as guild voting intensifies.\n\n\tEarlier in the week, Austin Butler hosted a tastemaker screening at Soho House on Monday, Dec. 8, co-hosted by WME. The evening featured a Q&A moderated by Chris Columbus with director-writer-producer Ryan Coogler, Jordan and Maisler, with producer Zinzi Coogler also in attendance.\n\n\tThe room was filled exclusively with Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences members, signaling a targeted push as phase one Oscar voting heats up.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBaz Luhrmann, Michael Keaton and Edward Norton Host Star-Driven ‘Train Dreams’ Events\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA – DECEMBER 09: (L-R) Baz Luhrmann, Joel Edgerton, and Clint Bentley attend Netflix’s “Train Dreams” Baz Luhrmann Hosted Cocktail Reception at Chateau Marmont on December 09, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.

The event drew a notable crowd that included Oscar nominees Edward Norton and Steven Yeun, in addition to Tobey Maguire, Phoebe Dynevor and Christina Hendricks.\n\n\tMomentum carried through Thursday, Nov. 11, when Oscar nominee Michael Keaton (“Birdman”) hosted a screening and Q&A at CAA with Edgerton and the film’s director and co-writer Clint Bentley.\n\n\tThe event attracted a full room of AMPAS, along with major guild voters of WGA, DGA and PGA.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPeacock Celebrates ‘All Her Fault’ With Decision-Free Dinner at Chateau Marmont\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tALL HER FAULT — Decision-Free Dinner — Pictured: (l-r) Shelley Zalis, Eve Rodsky, Dakota Fanning at the Chateau Marmont on December 10, 2025 — (Photo by: Todd Williamson/Peacock)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTodd Williamson/Peacock\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPeacock and The Female Quotient marked the awards-season momentum of breakout TV hit “All Her Fault” with an intimate dinner on Wednesday, Dec. 10, at the Chateau Marmont.\n\n\tThe “decision-free” evening celebrated the series — Peacock’s biggest original launch to date — as it begins its early Emmy run for next year amid Golden Globe and Critics Choice nominations.\n\n\tHosted by pop culture critic and “Shut Up Evan” creator Evan Ross Katz, with Dakota Fanning serving as the night’s special guest, the gathering was designed as a rare pause for women accustomed to carrying the mental and emotional load of daily life. Every detail was handled, allowing guests to simply arrive, unwind and engage in discussion centered on the show’s themes of female resilience, empowerment and self-preservation.\n\t\n\n\tThe dinner brought together a cross-section of influential voices spanning advocacy, entertainment and pop culture, including Shelley Zalis, Eve Rodsky, Gabrielle Stone, Haley Melikian, Blakely Thornton, Hannah Pistoia, Anna Konkle, Cheri Oteri, Megan Stalter, Parvati Shallow and Renata Ribeiro.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Chan-wook and Paul Feig at the Los Angeles premiere of “No Other Choice,” with director Park Chan-wook \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJay L.

    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel slammed Donald Trump during his Monday night broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” for saying Rob Reiner died “due to the anger he caused others” through his “Trump derangement syndrome.”\n\n\t“What we need at a time like this, besides common sense when it comes to guns and mental health care, is compassion and leadership. We did not get that from our president, because he has none of it to give. Instead, we got a fool rambling about nonsense,” Kimmel said. “For Rob and Michele Reiner, we got this post.”\n\t\n\n\tKimmel then recited Trump’s Monday morning Truth Social post, which read, “A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood. Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.”\n\n\n\tThe president continued, “He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before. May Rob and Michele rest in peace!”\n\n\t“It’s so hateful and vile,” Kimmel said of the post. “When I first saw it, I thought it was fake. My wife showed it to me this morning. I was like, ‘Even for him, that seemed like too much.’ But nothing is ever too much for him.”\n\t\n\n\tKimmel then turned his attention to an Oval Office press conference, where Trump was given “the chance to take another shot to act like a human being” and take back his post on Reiner. Trump instead doubled down.\n\n\t“I wasn’t a fan of his at all,” Trump told reporters Monday. “He was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned. He knew it was false. In fact, it’s the exact opposite. He said I was a friend of Russia, controlled by Russia. You know, the Russia hoax. He was one of the people behind it. I think he hurt himself career-wise. He became like a deranged person. Trump derangement syndrome. So, I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way, shape or form. I thought he was very bad for our country.”\n\n\t“That corroded brain is in charge of our lives,” Kimmel said. “If you voted for that, it’s okay to reconsider. It’s perfectly fine. I have to say, I know from my personal interactions with Rob Reiner that he would want us to keep pointing out the loathsome atrocities that continue to ooze out of this sick and irresponsible man’s mouth. So we’re going to do that over and over again until the rest of us wake up.”\n\n\tKimmel wasn’t the only late-night host to discuss Reiner. While not discussing it during the show, Colbert opened his Monday night broadcast with a preface in light of Reiner’s death, as well as the shootings at Bondi Beach and Brown University. \n\n\t“Hello, everybody,” a somber Colbert said at his desk. “Normally, we start the show with a short cold open about a major news story of the day. But after the terrible news this past weekend, the horrifying Hanukkah massacre at Bondi Beach, the tragic shootings at Brown University and the heartbreaking deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner, all of the major stories are too dark for that. Other people’s tragedy is sacred ground, and we try very hard not to walk there. But we are going to do a comedy show tonight, in light of and in spite of the darkness.”\n\n\tReiner, a prolific filmmaker who broke into Hollywood starring in “All in the Family” before directing films like “Stand by Me,” “When Harry Met Sally…,” “This Is Spinal Tap” and “A Few Good Men,” was found stabbed to death Sunday afternoon in his Brentwood home alongside his wife of 36 years, Michele Singer. Reiner was 78 and Singer was 68.\n\t\n\n\tNick Reiner, the son of Rob and Michele, was arrested on Sunday at 9:15 p.m. and booked on Monday at 5:05 a.m. on suspicion of his parents’ murder, per the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department online records.\n\n\tLAPD Chief Jim McDonnell confirmed during a Monday morning press conference that Nick Reiner had been “booked for murder.” He added that it was a “very, very tragic incident.\n\n\tCharges have not been filed. The LAPD said in a press release that investigators are expected to submit the case to the D.A. for filing on Tuesday.\n",

Nick was arrested Monday morning and booked for murder.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Michele Reiner\n              \n                          \n                Nick Reiner\n              \n                          \n                Rob Reiner\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                          \n                Police\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

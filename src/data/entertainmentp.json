    "body": "\n\t“There are no small parts, only small actors” is a phrase often attributed to Konstantin Stanislavski, meant to emphasize how much every role matters. But William H. Macy says there is a follow-up to that rule. “There are no small roles. There are, however, larger roles,” Macy suggests. He’s joking, of course, as few actors are better at leaving a lasting impression onscreen than the Emmy winner and Oscar nominee. “Small roles define my career. I would rather do a small role in a successful film than the lead in something that’s not going to work.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlisa Gao for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEvery character is important, as anyone who has ever been distracted by a bad background player knows to be true. And this year has seen a wide variety of actors taking characters with brief screen time on a whole journey in just a few scenes. Several films, such as “One Battle After Another,” feature a plethora of shorter but pivotal performances, from revolutionaries to members of the Christmas Adventurer’s Club to the nurse who helps Leonardo DiCaprio’s character escape by hinting he should claim to be diabetic. The pinnacle of “Hamnet” involves the reveal of Noah Jupe as an actor playing a character meant to represent Shakespeare’s late son in “Hamlet.” It’s made even more impactful by the fact that Jacobi Jupe, Noah’s younger brother, plays the tragic Hamnet.\n\n\n\tVariety spoke to a trio of actors — whose combined screen time totals less than 30 minutes — about their standout scenes.\n\n\t ‘Dream’ Role\n\n\tDenis Johnson’s 2011 novella “Train Dreams” moves through the life of an ordinary man named Robert Grainier and is peppered with brief but memorable encounters with others. Director Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar penned a loyal screenplay adaptation that allows every actor a moment to shine. One memorable character is Arn Peeples, described as “a gadabout of unknown origin” played by Macy. In approximately 12 minutes, Arn is established as a logger and explosives expert who likes to talk more than actually work. \n\t\n\n\tPart of Arn’s purpose is comedic — his skill with explosives is unreliable and the way he avoids work is relatable. He also indicates the unpredictably of life; after being hit by a falling branch, Arn takes days to die as the others look after him. But he also speaks to the themes of the film and the idea that every person affects one another. “This world is intricately stitched together, boys,” he says at one point. “Every thread we pull, we know not how it affects the design of things.”\n\n\tMacy says he tore through the script in one sitting. “I saw Arn Peeples in my head, clear as a bell,” he recalls. “I heard his olive oil Southern accent immediately and could picture this man with his beautiful speeches. I called immediately and said, ‘I’m in.’”\n\n\tBut Macy doesn’t go into a role trying to draw attention. “If a scene-stealing role is written that way, I’ll fight for it,” he says. “But the pitfall of this is reading a small part and thinking, ‘I can really do something with this.’ It’s the kiss of death because if you’re trying to do something with it, you’re not doing what the writer wanted you to do. It’s the writer’s job to do something with the character, not the actors. Our job is to do it simply and directly.”\n\n\tMacy mentions how his household is a theatrical one. “Both my wife, Felicity Huffman and daughter Sophia are also in the business. When we watch TV and we see a waiter come up and ask, ‘Would you like another cup of coffee?’ and it’s loaded with attitude, we notice,”  he says. “But when we see someone do a line like that clearly and truthfully, we have a tendency to go, ‘Oh, that was good. I like that guy.’ When we see someone trying to make something of the role, we go, ‘Oh Lord, protect us.’”\n\n\tThough he only shot for a few days, Macy says he prepared for the role as seriously as any other, particularly as he wanted to have Arn’s lengthy speeches memorized. “When you get beautiful writing, it’s not unlike a song, in that it has meter and rhythm and it literally feels good to say those lines,” he says. And though he lasts only minutes on screen, the character stayed with him. “I’ll remember Arn Peeples for the rest of my life.”\n\n\t ‘Kelly’ Green Envy\n\t\n\n\tNoah Baumbach’s latest film stars George Clooney as the titular “Jay Kelly,” a beloved movie star who is starting to realize the personal sacrifices he made for his career. But the film also offers a powerful look at the flip side of that life — in a character played by Emmy and Tony winner Billy Crudup. \n\n\tCrudup appears as Timothy, a former actor who started out with Jay and feels the latter stole his life after accompanying his friend to an audition. Now a child therapist, Timothy approaches Jay at a funeral and they go out for a drink. What occurs in the next 10 minutes is a roller coaster of emotions. What begins as friendly banter turns into passive-aggressive jabs, before Timothy politely admits his resentment: “I’m going to be honest with you; I can’t stand you.” Timothy goes from gentle to manic to violent, leading to a lawsuit that hangs over Jay the rest of the film, even though Timothy is never seen again on screen.\n\n\tCrudup says Baumbach was upfront about the size of the role when they met for coffee. But reading the script by Baumbach and Emily Mortimer, he immediately saw the importance of it. “My first response was it’s a hard thing to pull off,” he admits. “The whole movie is kind of predicated on that — it’s dramaturgically the point of no return for Jay Kelly so you have to execute it just right.” But his second thought was: “I really wish there was a couple more scenes because this film is so lovely, and I would love to be a part of it more.” (In fact, he inquired about the role of Jay’s manager, but learned it was being played by Adam Sandler, to which he responded, “Fair enough.”)\n\n\tBut Crudup also recognized that the script was packed with meaningful roles. “Many times, supporting characters are just there to promote the protagonist,” he states. “But that’s not how Noah works at all. He wants to flesh out and investigate each and every role and give them their own real, fully drawn-out life. Otherwise, he doesn’t put them in the movie.” \n\n\tEven a scene in which Timothy tears up as he “performs” the menu at Jay’s request is revealing — only Crudup could imbue the words “a wedge of iceberg lettuce and shrimp cocktail” with so much emotion. “I spent an inordinate amount of time with that monologue,” he admits. Part of that was because as an actor, Crudup works very differently from the character of Timothy, who relies on sense memory to get emotional. “I’m not a result-oriented actor, I just try to play the event of the scene,” Crudup reveals. “The idea of crying on cue is anathema to the way I think — and this scene is specifically designed to do that.”\n\t\n\n\tSo Crudup found himself researching the kind of acting Baumbach wanted Timothy to display. He wasn’t sure how it would go. “I said, ‘Guys, I have no idea if this is going to work or not.’ But once we were rolling and I was thinking of traumatic things and the tears started rolling, that river did not stop flowing.” Crudup admits he even went home after to his wife (actress Naomi Watts) and announced: “Honey, I can cry about anything!”\n\n\tCrudup took the scene so seriously that he almost passed on shooting it. At the time, he was performing the one-man show “Harry Clark” — a bravura turn that has him playing 19 different characters. “When I’m doing that play, I’m a shell of a man,” he admits. “It’s incredibly rewarding but pushes me to the creative limits.” When he learned Baumbach wanted to shoot his scene primarily in one day, he felt he couldn’t do the role and then do “Harry Clark” that night. “Netflix, who is incredibly supportive of Noah, said, ‘OK, we’ll buy out the house that night.’ At which point I had to answer, ‘I guess I’ll see you Tuesday.’”\n\n\t ‘Sinners’ Standout\n\n\tIt’s not just familiar faces that make an impression. Aadyn Encalarde had just turned 13 when she shot her scene in Ryan Coogler’s vampire hit “Sinners.” With about two minutes of screen time playing a character known only as “Teenager,” the young performer found herself standing out among an impressive cast as a young girl who guards the truck of Michael B. Jordan’s gangster Smoke. \n\n\tEncalarde made such an impact even her co-stars took notice. In an interview with Variety, Wunmi Mosaku, who plays Hoodoo practitioner Annie, called it her favorite character. “You have a full journey from this little girl pulling petals who doesn’t know how to barter to someone who stands up to a criminal and says, ‘Bullshit.’ In two minutes, she’s grown more than most characters in an entire movie and that’s the kind of clarity and specificity Ryan fills the characters with.”\n\n\tEncalarde lives in New Orleans where “Sinners” was filmed and where she has also shot roles in the series “Claws” and the film “Girls Trip.” For her audition, she was given her character’s entire scene. For her callback, she performed it a few different ways: “I did one that was shier and more built up to her being courageous and one where she started out confident and courageous.”\n\t\n\n\tBut mostly,  she talked about volleyball with producer Zinzi Coogler, Ryan’s wife. \n\n\tAt the time, Encalarde had no idea what happened in the rest of the script — her best guess was that it was about the mafia. “I didn’t find out it was a vampire movie until after I filmed. I think I saw an advertisement talking about Ryan Coogler’s new vampire movie and I had no idea.” But Encalarde was overjoyed: “I love ‘The Vampire Diaries,’ and I love ‘Twilight,’ so I was excited.”\n\n\tThough she was only on set three days, Encalarde says, “This is the longest amount of time I’ve been on a set for a role this small.” She adored the experience, and in addition to working with Jordan, was excited to learn her on-set teacher was the mother of Oscar nominee Quvenzhané Wallis, who also began her career at a young age. \n\n\t“Sinners” has proven to be a box office and cultural phenomenon and Encalarde says she noticed the response pretty quickly as people began posting congratulations on her Facebook page. She’s also been recognized outside her local Starbucks, “which was new and exciting and unexpected,” she says.\n\n\tBut perhaps the biggest thrill thus far came from Encalarde being singled out by Mosaku. Though the two have never met, Encalarde hopes they can someday. And she says Mosaku’s comments surprised her. “That’s crazy, because her character was my favorite character!”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn the surface, Chloé Zhao and Josh Safdie are not similar filmmakers. But together, in a one-on-one conversation, the directors bond over the importance of achieving a frequency while on set — whether that’s the contemplative hum of 300 extras meditating outside a replica of the Globe Theatre in “Hamnet” or the cast of “Marty Supreme” riding the rattle of an urban jungle, playing hustlers and operators. \n\n\t With “Hamnet,” starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, Zhao peels back the legend of William Shakespeare and reveals a domestic tragedy that shaped his art. She examines how a seemingly happy family is shattered by the death of one its members, in a style that is melancholic and dreamlike. And with the propulsive “Marty Supreme,” Safdie lights a fuse that sends Timothée Chalamet, as table-tennis striver Marty Mauser, bouncing across New York, London and Tokyo. At each stop, he spreads chaos and sprints away from trouble, all while narrowing in on his dream to become a superstar. \n\t\n\n\tThe two acclaimed films have put the directors in the middle of the Oscar race. Zhao, who seems Zen in person, and Safdie, who radiates nervous intensity, meet up in New York to discuss their passion for cinema and their surprisingly simpatico approaches to moviemaking.  \n\n\tCHLOÉ ZHAO: There’s a kind of a paradox of emotions that weaves through your films. \n\n\tJOSH SAFDIE: I like to think of my movies as about happiness and trying to chase it. \n\n\tZHAO: But that’s the saddest thing. \n\n\tSAFDIE: A hundred percent. Happiness is a very sad thing, which is a strange thing to say. It’s so haunted and fleeting. \n\t\n\n\tZHAO: I’ve seen many of your films, including the earlier ones. And there is a running away from self, like the fear of staying still. \n\n\tWhy did you cast Timothée?  \n\n\tSAFDIE: I met him before “Call Me by Your Name” came out. He was just this kid who had this supreme vision for himself. He felt like a dreamer — an intense one. And the dreaming was almost pathologized. I could tell he was trying to control where he was going. \n\n\tZHAO: You capture that so well. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBenedict Evans for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSAFDIE: I was watching him in other films, and I was like, no one’s exploring that. He did great in those other films, but I was like, “Oh wow — this side is still kind of untapped.”\n\n\tHe played Bob Dylan and Marty in the same year, and he had about four months in between. So when he wrapped, that day, he came to my office. He was still in Dylan’s voice — he was still acting like Dylan. [That’s when] I gave him 300 pages of images and research and the script. \n\n\tThe apex of “Hamnet” is being in touch with nature. All your other films are about nature in many ways. But this one was psychedelic almost. \n\n\tZHAO: I think both of our films are pretty good to watch on psychedelics. \n\n\tSAFDIE: Oh, really? I can’t. My relationship with drugs is such a bad one. When I would smoke weed a while ago, it was a self-punishing experience. I would do it to inspect all of the things that I hated about myself and then put them in a category to study. \n\n\tZHAO: [That’s] your inner dialogue with all your shadows. But what I love about your films is that, like Shakespeare’s plays, they’re not afraid of the shadows. It’s hard for me to get my characters to the places you get your characters to, storywise. \n\n\tSAFDIE: What do you mean by that?\n\n\tZHAO: The situations they’re in; allowing their shadows to come up. And to let these compulsions grab them completely, and then they do things that are almost unthinkable and sometimes unforgivable. And yet, [you] still give them humanity. That’s what a lot of characters in Shakespeare’s plays are like. He was swimming with his shadows nightly. \n\n\tSAFDIE: Your films feel very free. \n\n\tZHAO: I find that being on set, working with the actors, trying to go, “Can you hold the tension between knowing and not knowing? Because I need you to have a container for the character, but I also need you to let go to the mystery.” \n\t\n\n\tSAFDIE: You’re having that exact conversation with them? \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBenedict Evans for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tZHAO: Well, I asked them at the beginning, I said, “Hold it.” That means coming in, having some intention, but not knowing where the scene’s going to go; they don’t practice where it’s heading, so we’ll just see how it goes. If I come in every day knowing what’s going to happen, then [the film] is just mine, and that’s pretty small. There’s something so much bigger. But if you don’t have a container for it, then it’s just chaos. It’s not going to be a film. So how do we find that balance — to be half of the time a container, half the time a channel for whatever comes through? \n\n\tSAFDIE: Time is kind of a container in general. \n\n\tZHAO: For sure. \n\n\tSAFDIE: There are a few things that exist outside of time. Love exists outside of time. I remember Einstein once tried to explain relativity to somebody and said, “Everyone knows that an hour with your hand on a stove is an eternity. An hour with the person you love is over in a second.” And I’m pretty sure Einstein said that in kind of layman’s terms to try to explain relativity.  \n\n\tI try to find meaning in the micro. I believe in psychoanalysis. I believe in the development of a brain, early childhood trauma. I try to give all the actors that, so that they can have some semblance of internal monologue, which is some version of … \n\n\tZHAO: That is absolutely a container. \n\n\tSAFDIE: Yeah. When I’m on set, sometimes I’m chasing something. I spend all this time writing the scripts — six years with this one — and in the scenes, I’m chasing. I’m somehow always trying to transcend the situations — trying to get the actor to transcend — but you can only do it so much. And I would rely on being on set with the performer and seeing them attach themselves to a moment, and all of a sudden, it transcends past the page — the camera even. You push the actors to that place, and the best way to do it is by throwing stimuli at them so it catches them off guard. \n\n\tZHAO: Give me examples. Because clearly you brought things out of a lot of your actors that we haven’t seen them do before. \n\n\tSAFDIE: It’s a huge moment in the movie, so small though. Tyler, the Creator — Tyler Okonma — plays Wally, [Marty’s] friend who doesn’t have the luxury to dream. And there’s a frustration there. They’re doing this hustle at the bowling alley, and Marty’s playing the heel and Wally’s playing the victim, and he’s getting everybody to rally behind him. \n\t\n\n\tAnd I told Tyler to really push it in his anger at Marty. And one take, he really pushed it: He threw his hand into Timmy and pushed his glasses into his face. And in that moment, you’re seeing all the extras — I had extras throwing lines in all the time to catch Timmy off guard, so he’s constantly having to interact with them. And in that moment, you’re seeing Timothée Chalamet kind of be like, “Oh my God, this guy just pushed me in my face in front of all these people.” And there’s a humility in that moment, but it’s underneath the performance. It’s one of the most moving moments in the film. And I always tell Timmy that, and I thank Tyler for being able to go there. Those are the moments where you’re seeing your actor transcend and kind of fuse with themself.  \n\n\tZHAO: So satisfying. \n\n\tSAFDIE: It really is. I felt that at the end of “Hamnet,” the beautiful moment when everyone’s reaching their hand out; you really can feel. It’s the faces, it’s the costumes, the beautiful way the film is shot. \n\n\tZHAO: It’s also the energy of the people there. There was a synchronization. There’s an energy that builds, builds, builds, and it comes through on-screen. We worked with this amazing woman, Kim Gillingham; she’s a dreamwork coach who comes from a Jungian tradition. So before I even wrote the script, Jessie and I were doing dreamwork together. Our dreams had already started mingling. By the time we got to the Globe, the cast and crew all went through dreamwork. She would be on the stage, and she would drop 300 people into a somatic meditation. \n\n\tSAFDIE: Everyone went through them? \n\n\tZHAO: Oh, yeah. They’re all in a collective dream. There’s something about harmonizing the vibration of people, because we are made of vibrating particles from the universe. Once they vibrated at the same pace, it’s incredible how little I needed to do, because then they’re moving as one organism. \n\n\tSAFDIE: I saw your film in the theater, and I could feel the energy around me during that final scene. There were some older women who were completely hysterical, inconsolable, to the point where I’m like, “Oh no!” But it added to the moment. It speaks to the power of a theatrical experience. I’ve seen some of my favorite films on my 10-inch television at the foot of my bed, but then you go and revisit them when they’re in theaters, and all of a sudden you’re feeling some sort of collective energy. Time doesn’t exist anymore.  \n\t\n\n\tDoes seeing films in theaters matter to you? \n\n\tZHAO: It does matter to me. But I spent time on a reservation in South Dakota for many, many years. And the fact that your film “Daddy Longlegs” can be seen by a kid there, who may have had similar experiences to what you did, is because they can access it online. The accessibility aspect [of streaming] is great. \n\n\tSAFDIE: You’re pointing out the right thing. They’re two completely different experiences and they’re both incredibly meaningful.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe behind-the-scenes changes on “CBS Evening News” continue: Variety has confirmed that the newscast’s No. 2 producer, Javier Guzman, was let go following Wednesday night broadcast. It’s the latest wrinkle to come during new anchor Tony Dokoupil’s bumpy first week behind the anchor desk.\n\n\tKim Harvey remains as the newscast’s executive producer. “The CBS Evening News With Tony Dokoupil” has made headlines almost every day since Dokoupil took over the anchor chair this week, a major change orchestrated by new CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss. \n\t\n\n\tThe week started with CBS News forced to scrap plans to send Dokoupil on a week-long broadcast tour across the country after the U.S. invaded Venezuela — leading Dokoupil to start his tenure early last Saturday, with a three-segment interview with U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. \n\n\n\tOn Monday, Dokoupil’s first official broadcast was marred by technical difficulties, as recounted by Variety‘s Dan D’Addario: “He babbled confusedly, then fell silent, when a segment about Sen. Mark Kelly jumped ahead of a segment about Gov. Tim Walz in the lineup — the kind of shift an anchor is supposed to be able to handle without painfully long seconds of dead air. ‘First day, big problems here,’ Dokoupil said with evident frustration.”\n\n\tThen on Tuesday, the show was also criticized for an unusual sign-off by Dokoupil — which featured a quite unconventional tribute to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “Whatever you think of his politics, you’ve got to admit it’s an impressive résumé,” Dokoupil said before showing AI memes casting Rubio in other jobs such as the prime minister of Greenland, the head of Hilton Hotels and the Michelin man. The move was seen as tone deaf given the current global unrest and uncertainty over the U.S.’ actions in Venezuela.\n\t\n\n\tInsiders say Guzman’s departure is unrelated to any of this, but comes as the new telecast restructures. Guzman had just taken on the role of senior broadcast producer at the CBS Evening News in August. He had previously served as a senior producer on the newscast since January 2018.\n\n\tGuzman joined the CBS Evening News soon after Jeff Glor took over as anchor at the end of 2017. Among Guzman’s first assignments was serving as senior producer on a revival of the “Eye on America” CBS News series, featuring long-form reporting and in-depth storytelling. Dokoupil was a contributor to that “Eye on America” revival.\n\n\tGlor was replaced by Norah O’Donnell in 2019; in January 2025, John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois took over as co-anchors. They anchored their final newscast in December, to be replaced by Dokoupil at the start of 2026. . “CBS Evening News” has run in third place, well behind ABC’s “World News Tonight” and NBC’s “NBC Nightly News,” for years.\n\n\tGuzman joined CBS News in 2017 as a supervising producer for “CBSN: On Assignment.” Prior to that, he spent a year as a senior producer on “Vice News Tonight,” the broadcast that Vice Media produced for HBO. Guzman’s other credits include stints at Fusion Media Group and as a line/show producer on WNYC radio’s “The Takeaway.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAngela Bassett will be saluted for her career achievement at the 8th American Black Film Festival Honors in February.\n\n\tThe screen icon will receive the Excellence in the Arts award for her acclaimed body of work, which includes such films as “Malcolm X,” “Waiting to Exhale,” “How Stella Got Her Groove Back” and “Black Panther.” Bassett’s portrayal of Tina Turner in “What’s Love Got to Do With It” and reprising her role as Queen Ramonda in “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” both garnered Academy Award nominations; she was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2024. \n\t\n\n\tOn television, Bassett stars in and executive produces ABC’s hit drama “9-1-1” and won her first Emmy for narrating the NatGeo docuseries “Queens.” Bassett also directs and produces through Bassett Vance Productions, which is partnered with 20th Television. Her honors include multiple Emmy nominations, a SAG Award, two Golden Globes and 16 NAACP Image Awards, among other accolades.\n\n\n\t“Angela Bassett is the embodiment of excellence,” said Nice Crowd CEO Jeff Friday and President Nicole Friday. “Her body of work is both extraordinary and enduring, defined by performances that are fearless, powerful, and deeply human. She has set a standard for artistic integrity and cultural impact that continues to inspire generations, and we are honored to celebrate her remarkable career with the Excellence in the Arts Award.”\n\n\tPresented by Nice Crowd, the 2026 ABFF Honors will take place on Feb. 16 at the SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills. Comedian and New York Times best-selling author KevOnStage will host the non-televised ceremony. \n\t\n\n\tAs Variety previously announced, Dwayne Johnson will receive the Entertainment Icon Award. Oscar winner and talk show host Jennifer Hudson will be presented with the Renaissance Award, director and executive producer Salli Richardson-Whitfield will accept the Evolution Award and “F1” star Damson Idris will be recognized with the Horizon Award. ABFF Honors will also pay a special tribute to the creative team behind Ryan Coogler’s hit movie “Sinners.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe family feud is over. \n\n\tBam Margera has signed an agreement to appear in “Jackass 5” via never-before-seen archival footage. While things could change, Variety understands that Margera will not be filming new stunts for the movie, which will premiere in theaters June 26 via Paramount Pictures.\n\n\tA spokesperson for Paramount declined to comment.\n\n\n\tThe deal marks an armistice between Johnny Knoxville’s “Jackass” team and Margera, an original cast member who was booted from 2022’s “Jackass Forever” after allegedly violating the terms of a “wellness agreement,” which required regular drug and alcohol tests. In a lawsuit that was later dropped, Margera claimed he was coerced into signing the agreement while he was in rehab in 2019, and that he was fired from “Jackass” after testing positive for Adderall, which he said he had taken by prescription for a decade.\n\t\n\n\tIn recent years, Margera suffered from various health issues and went in and out of rehab for substance abuse. Knoxville told Variety in 2022 that he hadn’t spoken to Margera in more than a year, saying “I love Bam” and “I want him to get well and stay well.” He left the door open to Margera’s return to the franchise, saying, “I only want him to get better. That’s the first step. He has to take that step and maintain that step.” \n\n\tAs recently as last summer, Margera had ruled out a “Jackass” reunion, saying, “What they did to me, making me go to treatment and paying for it, and then not putting me in a movie, and, you know, I had to go to court over it. You couldn’t offer me enough money to want to do another ‘Jackass’ with them. The damage has been done.”\n\t\n\n\tMargera, a former professional skateboarder, was part of the “Jackass” television series on MTV, going on to shoot three movies plus various specials. His most famous stunts include being branded on his buttocks, being placed inside a cage with a cobra and treating golf carts like monster trucks.\n\n\tKnoxville and the official “Jackass” Instagram account posted yesterday that the franchise would return to theaters in June, which Variety confirmed as a new “Jackass” movie. The film will include new stunts and never-before-seen archival footage scrapped from previous projects.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDavid Bowie’s childhood home south of London will be restored and opened to the public late in 2027, Heritage of London Trust announced on Thursday.\n\n\tThe property, located at 4 Plaistow Grove in Bromley, Kent, was the young David Jones’ artist’s home from ages 8 to 20 (1955–1967), which includes the early years of his musical career. After releasing several singles under his born name, the singer began performing as David Bowie in 1966 to avoid confusing with Monkees singer Davy Jones.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy David Bowie Estate\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe heritage project, due for completion in late 2027, will restore the “two up, two down” railway workers’ cottage to its original early 1960s appearance, according to the announcement. In collaboration with curator Geoffrey Marsh (co-curator of the Victoria and Albert museum’s popular “David Bowie Is” exhibition) and utilizing archival research, “the restoration will recreate the interior layout exactly as it was when Bowie’s father commuted to work at charity Dr. Barnado’s and his mother worked as a waitress,” the announcement states, adding “This experience will center on Bowie’s 9 ft x 10 ft bedroom.”\n\n\n\tThe announcement was made on January 8, 2026, which would have been Bowie’s 79th birthday. He died in 2016 after a battle with cancer.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy David Bowie Estate\n\t\n\n\n\n\tInspired by Bowie’s collaborative Beckenham Arts Lab in 1969, which offered opportunities “for everybody,” the site will host creative and skills workshops for young people. Through the Trust’s Proud Places and Proud Prospects programs, the house will act as a “solid foundation for the next generation,” teaching confidence and communication skills in the arts, the announcement states. A major £500,000 grant from the Jones Day Foundation, a charitable foundation funded by attorneys and staff of the Jones Day law firm, has been secured to anchor the restoration, with a public fundraising campaign launching this month.\n\t\n\n\tThe house is near the Edwardian “Bowie bandstand,” where the young musician performed in 1969, which was restored by Bromley Council and Heritage of London Trust in 2024.\n\n\tUnfortunately, Haddon Hall, the sprawling Victorian mansion in nearby Beckenham that Bowie rented from 1969-73 and wrote some of his most legendary work, was demolished in the 1980s.  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy David Bowie Estate\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMarsh says, “It was in this small house, particularly in his tiny bedroom, that Bowie evolved from an ordinary suburban schoolboy to the beginnings of an extraordinary international stardom – as he said ‘I spent so much time in my bedroom. It really was my entire world. I had books up there, my music up there, my record player. Going from my world upstairs out onto the street, I had to pass through this no-man’s-land of the living room.’”\n\n\tDr. Nicola Stacey, Director of Heritage of London Trust, said: “David Bowie was a proud Londoner. Even though his career took him all over the world, he always remembered where he came from and the community that supported him as he grew up. It’s wonderful to have this opportunity to tell his story and inspire a new generation of young people and it’s really important for the heritage of London to preserve this site. We are thrilled to have already secured a major grant of £500,000 from the Jones Day Foundation towards the project, and hope that people everywhere will want to be involved.”\n\n\tGeorge Underwood, artist, musician and David Bowie’s lifelong friend (and the person responsible for Bowie’s famous dilated pupil, the result of a fistfight over a girl), said: “We spent so much time together, listening to and playing music. I’ve heard a lot of people say David’s music saved them or changed their life. It’s amazing that he could do that and even more amazing that it all started here, from such small beginnings, in this house. We were dreamers, and look what he became.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy David Bowie Estate\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAhead of Netflix’s Friday launch of the eagerly anticipated film adaptation of Emily Henry‘s best-selling romance “People We Meet on Vacation,” the streaming service has announced it’s furthering its partnership with the author.\n\n\tNetflix has picked up the movie adaptation of her book “Funny Story,” and will be shifting its already-in-the-works “Happy Place” adaptation from a TV series into a film.\n\n\n\t“Happy Place” follows former couple Harriet and Wyn, who pretend to still be together for one last summer trip with their best friends at a Maine beach house while struggling with the tension of their broken engagement.\n\t\n\n\tHenry’s “Happy Place” is being produced by Nuyorican’s Jennifer Lopez, Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Benny Medina. Previously, Leila Cohan was set up as showrunner for the series that will now be a film.\n\n\t“Funny Story” is being produced by Lyrical Media and Ryder Picture Company (RPC) with Lyrical Media’s Alexander Black, as well as RPC’s Aaron Ryder and Andrew Swett, attached to produce. Henry is writing the script herself. The film does not yet have a director attached.\n\n\tPer its official logline, “Funny Story is a shimmering, joyful tale about a pair of opposites with the wrong thing in common. The story follows Daphne, a children’s librarian coping with her broken engagement to Peter, who realized too late that he loved his childhood best friend, Petra. Stranded in her ex’s lakeside hometown, Daphne becomes roommates with Petra’s ex, Miles, and despite their differences, they form a tenuous friendship and a plan to get back at…or with their exes.”\n\t\n\n\tNeither project has set its cast yet.\n\n\tHenry currently has film adaptations of her books “Beach Read” and “Book Lovers” set up with other studios and distributors, with “People We Meet on Vacation” marking the first of Henry’s five planned book-to-screen adaptations to be released so far.\n\n\tProduced by 3000 Pictures and Temple Hill, “People We Meet on Vacation” stars Emily Bader and Tom Blythe as longtime best friends and travel buddies Poppy and Alex, who end up on one last getaway together while working through their complicated romantic feelings for each other. The film is directed by Brett Haley from a script written by Yulin Kuang (the director and screenwriter working on Henry’s “Beach Read” for 20th Studios and Original Film.\n\n\t“Emily Henry has a gift for creating characters that truly connect with audiences, and it’s no surprise her books have resonated with so many,” Alex Black, Founder and CEO of Lyrical Media said. “We’re excited to be following up People You Meet on Vacation and collaborating with her on Funny Story — it’s going to be such a thrill bringing her beloved characters to the big screen.”\n\n\tSee Variety’s interview with Henry below about “People We Meet on Vacation’s” upcoming release, the state of her other on-screen adaptations and when she’ll be releasing her next book.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA – JANUARY 06: (L-R) Brett Haley, Emily Bader, Tom Blyth and Emily Henry attend the premiere of Netflix’s “People We Meet On Vacation” at The Egyptian Theatre Hollywood on January 06, 2026 in Los Angeles, California.

I remember the first time that I got to see a cut of the film was kind of a long time ago now. I knew how hard everyone had worked on it, so I wanted to be thrilled with it, but I also knew I was going to be measuring it against the fans’ expectations and just probably like one of the harshest critics you could have. And so I was very, very tense, and then when the movie ended, I just felt such immense relief. That was the first major feeling, more than joy and excitement, which came later, but at first it was just immense relief, because I felt like they had pulled it off, and I felt like the readers were going to be extremely happy, which has been my biggest concern. The book already exists, and I’m very happy with it. And I personally didn’t need as much from this movie, I don’t think, as I felt like the readers did, and I really wanted it to be something that they were thrilled with. And when I finished watching it that first time, I felt pretty confident that the majority of them would be thrilled.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou usually have announced what your next book will be by this point, but we don’t yet know what are working on or if there will be a release in 2026.\t\n\n\tI haven’t formally talked about any of this, but essentially, it’s going to look like the movies pulled my focus for a minute and so I’m on a delay. But what actually happened was I had just been writing on this really intense schedule for six years, or however long it’s been. And I feel like I’m the luckiest person in the world a lot of times, because my editor and my agent both really pushed me to take a little break. And that’s not normal. Like, every time I’m on a writer’s retreat and I’m stressed out and I’m burnt out, and whatever all my friends say to me, “Well, you have to be the one to ask if you want a break. No one’s ever going to offer that to you,” because typically they don’t. Typically they’re like, come on, we’re waiting. And my editor and agent were both like, you know what, you should just take a minute and let yourself do other things. \n\n\tSo I traveled a lot more in 2025 than I typically get to do. I kind of crammed as much travel as I could, and then I wrote these scripts, and I wrote some spec scripts just for fun that I’m not doing anything with at this exact moment but I’m going to go back to. I didn’t write a book in the last year and that’s the first time I haven’t written a book in a year since I was probably 20 years old. It’s funny, because that was my year off — and it wasn’t really a year off, because I looked back and I did write five scripts, a short story and an essay. But it was a year off as far as these bigger projects that take a lot longer and that stay in your brain for so long. And now I will say I am so ready to get back to books. It was exactly what I needed. I feel very inspired at this moment. I know what the next one is, and I’m gonna be diving in and hopefully I will be able to start sharing something soon. It’s gonna start moving quickly, hopefully. I’m very ready to be back in the world of books.\n\t\n\t\tWhat has the casting process been like for the other adaptations, like “Happy Place” and “Funny Story”? Are you finding it’s been difficult to find the right fit for the characters, or that it’s hard to find actors who want to do the project?\t\n\n\tOh, honestly, a little bit of both. Another thing that Brett and I have been saying all week in all of our press is that I genuinely think in two years, we wouldn’t have been able to get Tom and Emily. I think that they’re such incredible actors. And I mean, you are very much in this space, I think that you’re aware there’s still really a stigma against romance in Hollywood. I think publishing has come so far in the last 10 years, because they’ve had to. They’ve had to accept that this is the genre that people are buying the most, reading the most. This is kind of what’s keeping the boat afloat, which doesn’t mean that every other genre isn’t just as worthy of existing, but we do have to fund those books existing, that money has to come somewhere to make every book exist. And romance just has such a voracious readership that romance readers read multiple books a week, a lot of us. So I think publishing has really embraced the fact that romance as a genre is legitimate and valid and valuable, and that it’s an audience that needs to be served, and they need to be served by people who actually believe in it, not just like trying to cater to people you don’t respect. \n\t\n\n\tSo that has been such huge progress, but I think Hollywood is probably at least five years behind that, and I still have been surprised by a lot of the ways that I feel like I’ve come up against a stigma. And part of it, I will say, is I think it’s really hard to cast these movies. I think there are a lot of actors who are very wary of this genre. There’s also the fact that Brett and I are still somewhat unknown quantities. He’s had some beautiful movies, I’ve had some popular books. But within the larger picture, we don’t have that necessarily going for us yet. And then on top of that, I think actors are very afraid that if they do one of these movies, they will be taken less seriously, or they they’ll be stuck in this genre, and they won’t be able to do anything else. And ultimately, romance is just a very human story. It’s kind of like a genre where you cannot hide behind anything else — the plot, the arc, like the conflict, all of it is so grounded in, at least within this sub genre of romance, and there’s nothing to hide behind. So if the actors aren’t fantastic, the movie is going to sink or swim based on that. And watching Tom and Emily in this movie, I find them so moving. I find them so just irresistible. I feel like the camera loves them, and you feel everything they’re feeling. \n\n\tI feel like people can sometimes treat it like a initiation, where it’s like, we have to do a romance to prove we can do a romance so we can get cast in other things. I mean, romance launches careers. I would point to “Normal People,” which is not shelved as romance, but it is, at its core, just a love story; that is the bare bones of the story and the miniseries as well. And now Paul Mescal is one of the biggest working actors, and I think that that’s because he got to showcase what he’s capable of in a beautiful love story. \n\n\tAnd you have to find someone who you feel like the audience will be excited about, you are excited about, the director and producers are excited about, the studio is excited about and they’re free, available and excited to do this. So it is shockingly hard, but there is movement. And I also feel like Tom and Emily both did such a such an incredible job at this that it’s going to be a lot easier to cast after this movie comes out, because I think people are going to see how they are able to like bring this story to life. And I think and hope that other actors will be excited by the ability, the opportunity to do that same thing.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe only one of your projects that has not yet been picked up for an on-screen adaptation is your most recent release, “Great Big Beautiful Life.” Are you actively working on selling those rights?\t\n\n\tJust kind of for fun I do this. I did write a script of that just for fun. We’ve met with a ton of wonderful producers, but ultimately, we decided to slow down on that, because we have these other things in the works and we wanted at least to let [“People We Meet on Vacation”] go and soar and fly. So we have not been letting anyone at “Great Big Beautiful Life.” So that’s kind of fun, because I feel like in the past, I’ve been almost manic about wanting to get these things made and offload them, and this was the first time that it felt like we’re not in a rush. I do love the script that I have. Obviously, it needs work, and will get work, but I had a wonderful time writing it and I’m excited to get back to it sometime in the next couple months, hopefully.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tJan 8, 2026 12:03pm PT\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe waiting is the hardest part, when it comes to some recording artists. And if a lot of them come through on their promises, threats or hints of delivering new material in 2026, it will be like a pop drought ending. Bruno Mars has announced his first album in more than eight years; it’s been eight for Robyn, too. A$AP Rocky is about to hit with his first project in seven years. BTS will be offering the group’s first fresh batch of material in six, and it’s been that long that we got new solo albums from Madonna, Paul McCartney and Phoebe Bridgers, too. U2 is working on the the group’s first batch of new material in nine years. Jill Scott and Hilary Duff might take the prize: their imminent albums are their first in a decade. \n\n\tSo we know it’s going to rain, and maybe, just maybe, if everyone comes through, it’s going to pour, too.\n\n\tThere are only slightly less long-awaited albums definitely or reportedly on the way from Doechii, Harry Styles, Olivia Rodrigo, Lana Del Rey and Raye, among others… along with efforts from the somewhat more recently prolific Zach Bryan, Drake and Charli XCX. Here’s a look at 30 of the albums that music aficionados are most counting on over the next 12 months.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tZach Bryan, ‘With Heaven on Top’ (Jan. 9)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Christopher Polk for Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe country-rock superstar with a Springsteenian bent is issuing his first album since making a $350 million catalog deal. Even his less overtly commercial albums have done bonkers business these last few years, so this one may also  out of the gate strong enough to make Bryan’s business partners feel like they made a wise investment. He went up to the minute with it; in December, he tweeted that he was heading into the final five days of recording. (In other words, don’t expect the vinyl version any time soon.) Even with the release imminent, a track order was hard to come by, but songs he’s indicated will make the cut include “In Dreams,” “Madeline,” “Bowery,” “In Dreams,” “Plastic Cigarette” and “Rockaway.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tA$AP Rocky, ‘Don’t Be Dumb’ (Jan. 16)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Burak Cingi/Redferns\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tYou might feel just a little dumb for believing any release date for the rapper’s first album since 2018, but this one sure seems fixed in place. How many updates have fans gotten? “Leaks and sample clearances are disrupting the album… I’m sorry for the wait,” Rocky tweeted in summer 2024, as the album was then supposedly about to come out after multiple delays. But with a video tease for “Punk Rocky” released Jan. 2 and featuring no less a leading lady than Winona Ryder, this time it’s for real. Look for an all-star roster of collaborators… from Mike Dean, Tyler, the Creator, Madlib, Swedish House Mafia and Metro Boomin all the way to Danny Elfman and Tim Burton.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tYe, ‘Bully’ (Jan. 30)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tYes, we know that some may consider this one of 2026’s most dreaded, due to his biggest recent record — his record of toxicity. But there is still a significant audience out there hoping that his recent withdrawal from social media could signal a time of getting things together creatively as well as personally. Technically, the artist formerly known as Kanye West released “Bully” — or a version of it — in March 2025 as the soundtrack to a Hype Williams-directed film starring his son Saint. He prefaced the release by stating on social media that the album was “not finished and half the vocals AI,” and took down the films essentially a day later. After a string of pushbacks that r/Kanye fans tracked like the phases of the moon, “Bully” appears to be actually, really dropping on Jan. 30 after pre-orders recently popped up on his site. Longtime collaborator Mike Dean confirmed that he co-produced all songs on the project, which several Ye associates promised would not have any traces of AI.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCharli XCX, ‘Wuthering Heights’ (Feb. 13)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Billboard via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCharli has been known to veer between pure pop and edgier modes, and her soundtrack for Emerald Fennell’s Emily Bronte movie adaptation is surely veering toward the latter, based on the first teased song, a collaboration with Velvet Undergrounder John Cale. So maybe it won’t show up as a meme affecting pop culture and even electoral politics, but even a side project from Ms. XCX is an event, post-“Brat.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJill Scott, ‘To Whom This May Concern’ (Feb. 13)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFans have waited patiently for Jilly from Philly to head back to the studio for her first record since 2015’s “Woman.” And wouldn’t you know it, the R&B singer started off the year by announcing that her sixth album “To Whom This May Concern” would arrive just in time for Valentine’s Day. Along with the release of the first single “Beautiful People,” Scott revealed that the project will feature collaborations with Ab-Soul, J.I.D., Tierra Whack and Too Short, and will include production from DJ Premier, Adam Blackstone, Om’Mas Keith, Camper, Andre Harris, Trombone Shorty, Seige Montracity, Eric Wortham, DW Wright and VT Tolan.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDanny L. Harle, ‘Cerulean’ (Feb. 13)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tHarle may not be a household name but he’s collaborated with Charli xcx, Dua Lipa, Caroline Polachek and many others — some of whom appear on his solo album, which also features PinkPantheress, Clairo, Oklou and more. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMegan Moroney, ‘Cloud 9’ (Feb. 20)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chris Willman/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe fastest-rising female star in country is making the move from amphitheaters to arenas with her spring tour. She officially entered her “Cloud 9” era last year with “6 Months Later,” her third album’s debut single, which became a country airplay top 5 hit. In a recent interview with Variety during CMAs Week, she explained the album’s and tour’s pink color scheme, as opposed to the previous green and blue. “I chose pink because I think there is a softness about this music that isn’t in my other albums,” she said. “And I think it’s come from the confidence that I have now. It’s about falling in love and falling out of love, but when you’re truly confident, it’s not the end of the world when it doesn’t work out, you know what I mean? And my other albums, maybe I perceived it as the end of the world. Now this new music is just more carefree and confident. So I thought pink was a perfect color to feel empowering and confident, but also soft, and that’s what the new music is like.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHilary Duff, ‘Luck… or Something’ (Feb. 20)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Lauren Dunn\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWe last heard from this one-time teen queen, musically, all the way back in 2015. No wonder she’s being slightly sly in naming her comeback single “Mature.” On Jan. 7, she released video footage teasing what might be the second single from the forthcoming release, with provocative lyrics including: ““I only want the beginning, I don’t want the end/I want the part where you say goddamn/Back of a dive bar giving you head/Then sneak home late, wake up your roommates…” The song longs for a time “before we swept us under the bed/And we became practically roommates/I’m touching myself by the front door/But you don’t even look my way no more.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBruno Mars, ‘The Romantic’ (Feb. 27)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for The Recording Academy\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tHas Mars really not released an album since 2016, when the Grammy-hoarding blockbuster “24K Magic” came out? It’s true, although if it doesn’t seem quite that long, it’s because he’s hardly been dormant. In 2021 he released a project as one-half of Silk Sonic alongside Anderson .Paak, which earned them Grammys for record of the year, song of the year, best R&B performance and best R&B song. And his one-off duet with Lady Gaga, “Die With a Smile,” became one of the biggest songs of the 2020s, before he joined up with Rosé for “APT.,” currently nominated for record of the year, song of the year and best pop duo/group performance at the Grammys next month. At this rate, an actual solo followup eight and a half years later is practically just gravy.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCharlie Puth, ‘Whatever’s Clever’ (March 6)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Ricky Alvarez\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tPuthers, rejoice. Charlie Puth gave a long lead heads-up for his fourth album “Whatever’s Clever,” releasing the excellent lead single “Changes” in October 2025 and giving a tease of what to expect. The project, co-executive produced by BloodPop (Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga), could see Puth heading in a more mature direction based on the sound of “Changes,” which pulls from ’80s pop like Phil Collins and Bruce Hornsby. Fans can likely expect the song “Sideways,” a duet with Coco Jones, to appear on “Whatever’s Clever” after the two debuted the ballad during his Blue Note LA residency last fall.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBTS, TBA (March 20)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: iHeartRadio\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tTheir collective South Korean military service is done — and so is their first brand new group album since “Be” in 2020 (unless you count the anthology album “Proof” from 2022). “Guys, we just finished recording,” Jimin said in November. “It can come out next spring.” That was manna, or butter, to the ARMY’s ears. An official announcement on New Year’s Day offered a March release date but no title. Their world tour will be announced Jan. 14.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLuke Combs, ‘The Way I Am’ (March 20)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Jeremy Cowart\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCombs’ sixth album will be his first since “‘Fathers & Sons” in 2024. A good amount of the 22 tracks have already been released a number of tracks from the 22-song set, including the No. 1 airplay single “Back in the Saddle,” “My Kinda Saturday Night,” “Days Like These” and “Giving Her Away.” The country superstar kicks off a stadium tour in Las Vegas the day after the album comes out.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRobyn, ‘Sexistential’ (March 27)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Marili Andre\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIt turns out the Swedish emo-dance-pop queen is on a reliable schedule of a new album every eight years. Just as that long a period passed between 2010’s “Body Talk” and 2018’s “Honey,” so will that much time have elapsed leading into her 2026 release. The Swedish pop singer first teased the project in the fall with the release of first single “Dopamine,” then released the title track and “Talk to Me” when officially announcing the album earlier this week, so a third of its nine songs are already out. “Sexistential,” the song, is “possibly the world’s first rap about having one-night stands while 10 weeks pregnant after IVF,” she noted — good of her to add that “possibly” in case she’d been beaten to the punch.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLana Del Rey, ‘Stove’ (TBA)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Stagecoach\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDel Rey’s purportedly country/Americana-leaning album is on its third title and is now also into its third year of being promised for release. Just like “The Right Person Will Stay” (to cite a former title), the right release date also will stay, right?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNicki Minaj, TBA\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tLast year, the rapper teased a March 26 release date for her sixth album… but that was before she announced she was quitting music… which was before she announced that wasn’t true… which was before she went full MAGA at an appearance with Erika Kirk in December. Will the music she’s been working on be retrofitted with anti-trans raps to mollify her new “boys should be boys” fan base?  \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKacey Musgraves, TBA\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for ABA\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tShe’s been leaning into folk-pop with every album since the Grammy-winning “Golden Hour,” but there have been at least hints that her new one will mark more of a return to her original country sound, if only in part. When last spring she announced re-signing with Lost Highway, the newly restarted label that was actually the imprint she first signed with at Universal Music Group, she discussed the direction she was taking. Talking with THR at the time, she said, “There was ‘Same Trailer’; then ‘Pageant Material’ went even harder in the country direction — it was a love letter to all the classic country I love. Naturally, it felt good for me to explore some other sounds, and I went into ‘Golden Hour’ territory. Then I went through a divorce and was in a really intense place in my life, and I went in the opposite direction with ‘Star Crossed.’ With ‘Deeper Well,’ I swung back in toward my center…” Now, she said, “I’ve been feeling really good playing around with some more… I want to say ‘traditional’ songs, but at the same time, there always has to be a modern edge there in some way.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRaye, TBA\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Dave Benett/Getty Images for The Ivors Academy\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe British vocal gymnast, multiple BRIT Awards winner and Grammy nominee is coming off of a U.K. No. 1 single with “Where Is My Husband!” and promised in a recent SiriusXM interview that the follow-up to her 2023 debut is coming “definitely first half of [2026] at least. Hopefully sooner!” If the single is any indication, it will be an effervescent blast of R&B, pop and future nostalgia.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRolling Stones, TBA\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIt seemed like the album the Rolling Stones had been recording for 15 years might never get done until producer Andrew Watt, who is nearly 50 years younger than the band members and acted as a sonic fountain of youth for Elton John, Ozzy Osbourne and others, got in the studio with them — and presto, there was 2023’s unexpectedly lively “Hackney Diamonds.” According to multiple insiders, the Stones and Watt reunited last year and there’s another album finished and on the way.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOlivia Rodrigo, TBA\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tNot much is known about the album dubbed “OR3,” but both Rodrigo and co-writer/producer Daniel Nigro have said her next missive is basically finished. Some fans believed or hoped it might be announced this week when she teased something on the way, but the actual news there turned out to be that she was aligning with other artists on a series of covers of songs from her five-year-old “Sour” album, starting with a David Byrne interpretation of “Drivers License.” But if that rollout ends with the May five-year anniversary of “Sour,” that still leaves the whole second half of the year to truly fulfill fans’ wishes for album #3.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMadonna, TBA\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit:  Courtesy of Sky Original\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIs a return to the dance floor in the cards for her Madgesty? Just as her milestone 2005 album “Confessions on a Dance Floor” turned 20, Madonna teased that she was at work on a potential sequel to the sweaty dance project. She posted images of herself back in the studio with “Dance Floor” producer Stuart Price, and in September revealed that a brand new dance album would impact in 2026 following her re-signing with Warner Records nearly two decades after leaving the label. Time to dust off the leotard.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHarry Styles, TBA\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner for Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWhat a tease Harry Styles is, releasing a video just at the end of 2025 that suggested new music would be arriving imminently. Turns out that clip was just for an instrumental rendition of “Forever Forever” that he performed during the final night of his “Love on Tour” trek in 2023. But that hasn’t stopped rumors from swirling otherwise that a follow-up to 2022’s “Harry’s House” is in the works. Several outlets have speculated a tour is also brewing — could 2026 once again be the year of Harry? All signs could be pointing in one direction.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDrake, ‘Iceman’ (TBA)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: MLB\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe Toronto rapper has been teasing out his ninth studio album “Iceman” amid the fallout from his very highly publicized feud with Kendrick Lamar (and subsequent legal dealings with UMG), giving fans glimpses of what the project may sound like via hours-long livestreams bearing the album’s name. Through those streams, he debuted several tracks “What Did I Miss?,” “Which One” featuring Central Cee and “Dog House” featuring Yeat and Julia Wolf, all of which would later become available on streaming. Who’s to say when “Iceman” will actually arrive, but based on past release strategies, it could come at any moment.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJ.

Cole has teased “The Fall Off” since at least 2018, when he included “1985 — Intro to ‘The Fall Off'” as the concluding track on “KOD.” There have been years of rumors and teases from the man himself, plus subsequent releases including 2024’s “Might Delete Later” that dropped amid his brief involvement in the Kendrick Lamar and Drake beef. It’s unclear where the record stands, but Cole fans still have hope it’ll surface this year.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKehlani, TBA\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tKehlani has been riding the “Folded” wave as it gradually picked up steam since its release in June 2025. That throwback R&B sound fitted her buttery vocals nicely, setting the stage for the next single, “Out the Window.” Not much is known about her untitled fifth album, though she did claim in a November interview with “The Cruz Show” that it’s a “very confident body of work.” “I wanted to make a great R&B album and I’m working on making a great R&B album with some of my favorite people of all time who I’ve always loved,” she said. “For some reason, everything is falling perfectly into place.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tU2, TBA\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Olaf Heine\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIt’s coming up on nine years since U2 released its last album of new material, 2017’s “Songs of Experience.” Considerable time has been spent in the studio, over the years and recently, with the band reportedly starting from scratch on a new album in August 2024. Could it be… time? ““Everyone in the band seems desperate for it,” Bono told Esquire last year. “It’s like their lives depend on it. … And, as I tell them, they do.” It’s not as if the pressure hasn’t been on from fans. ““I hope they’re going to still be there for us,” he said. “We’ve pushed them to their elastic limit over the years. And now it’s a long time that we’ve been away. But I still think that we can create a soundtrack for people who want to take on the world.” \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPaul McCartney, TBA\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Tara Howard\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tIn the recently released book about Wings, McCartney said, “Right now, I have 25 songs that I’m finishing in the next few months, new songs that are interesting.” This was good news for fans who wondered if the work he had reportedly been doing with producer Andrew Watt on and off for years would finally result in McCartney’s first album since his DIY pandemic album in 2020. And, in a fansite Q&A at the end of 2025, when he was asked what he is most looking forward to in 2026, he answered, “My new album!” He added, We’re just starting to think about how to put that together,” so don’t expect him to suddenly jump out in January with a surprise release after this long wait.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBeyoncé, TBA\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for The Recording A\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tLike many Beyoncé projects, little is known about when the final act of Beyoncé’s trilogy will arrive, let alone sound like, but the Beyhive has been buzzing for years that it could very well be a rock album. That, of course, is based on the tiniest of clues — that she dressed as Betty Davis for Halloween in 2024, or that her Levi’s campaign was rock-influenced. Beyoncé runs on her own schedule, but with the conclusion of the “Cowboy Carter” tour last July, the timing for a new record in 2026 makes sense.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDoechii, TBA\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Universal \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDoechii got some new music in under the end-of-2025 wire with her collaboration with SZA, “Girl, Get Up,” released as a single on Dec, 30. It seems a little silly to say out loud that we are still waiting on Doechii’s debut album after all this time. There are probably few fans who don’t consider 2024’s “Alligator Bites Never Heal” to have been a debut album, even if it bore the technically disqualifying “mixtape” tag. And all the songs released in 2025, including her re-recorded version of 2019’s “Anxiety,” sure make her seem almost like a veteran artist at this point. Nevertheless, we will celebrate with everyone else when she lands with what everyone can certify as a proper full-length.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPhoebe Bridgers, TBA\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Jingyu Lin for Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tNot a peep, publicly, about this one yet, but we’re putting it on our inevitable list… fine, wish list. Bridgers hasn’t had a solo album out since “Punisher” in 2020, so we’re almost positive six years is the longest gap she’s going to go with before sating fans. And Boygenius cohorts Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker did both return to their own solo careers last year, so the deck is properly clear is avoiding stepping on their release dates was at all an issue.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSky Ferreira, ‘Masochism’ (TBA)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for The Met Museum/\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThat TBD is doing a lot of heavy lifting considering that this album has been promised for, what, a decade? Still, we’re blindingly holding out hope that 2026 could be the year that the very long-awaited follow-up to 2013’s “Night Time, My Time” touches down. Fans once again got their hopes up when she said “Masochism” would come in 2025, and it seemed legit considering she mentioned it amid the press blitz for her “Babygirl” soundtrack song “Leash.” And yet, another year, another bullet point on a most anticipated albums list.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAlso on the way…\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tProjects are either reported or strongly rumored to be coming from:\n\n\tSteve LacyMegan Thee Stallion4 Non BlondesEvanescenceFoo FightersBjorkMassive AttackSublimeMumford & SonsGorillazMadison BeerLouis TomlinsonMegadethElla MaiRobbie WilliamsPeter Gabriel\n\n\tBruce SpringsteenFleaMitskiLucinda WilliamsNick JonasSnail Mail\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFKA Twigs: ‘I Love Telling the Truth.

    "body": "\n\tGiulio Base began his journey with the Torino Film Festival from the ground up.\n\n\t At just 17, in 1982, he attended the very first edition, then called Cinema Giovani (“Festival of Young Cinema”) and co-founded by Alberto Barbera. From that moment, he was hooked. \n\n\tOver the next four decades, as the festival grew in name, scope, and reputation, Base built a career both in front of and behind the camera, earning acclaim for his directing work and gaining international recognition for his theologically themed films. Forty-one years after that first encounter, he returned to where it all began as the festival’s artistic director.\n\t\n\n\t“The Torino Film Festival has always been known as a prestigious, auteur-driven event,” Base says. “That will never change, it is who we are. But I wanted to add another dimension, something more popular, glamorous, and open. I wanted films that appeal not only to cinephiles and students but also to those who might not usually attend festivals. My goal is to preserve Torino’s auteur spirit while making it more accessible and exciting for everyone.” \n\n\n\tBase also sought to rekindle the youthful spark that first drew him to the event. He kept the focus on debut and sophomore features while renewing the selection committee, appointing six new members under the age of 30. \n\n\t“Let’s be honest,” he says with a laugh. “Italy can be a country of old men. I wanted a fresh perspective. Their vision and their approach to cinema helped shape a competition that remains true to the festival’s founding spirit: youthful, daring, and determined to change the world, or at least change cinema.” \n\t\n\n\tNow in his second year at the helm, Base has focused on clarity and curation to create a festival that feels both manageable and memorable. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTorino Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I am not a fan of overly complicated or cluttered lineups,” he explains. “Some festivals screen hundreds of films, and as a viewer, that can be overwhelming. I prefer quality over quantity. Our festival runs for eight days with three main competitions: features, documentaries, and shorts, each presenting 16 titles. That means two films per day per section. The program is clear, balanced, and easy to navigate.”\n\n\tA figure of wide-ranging tastes and curiosities, Base holds doctorates in literature and philosophy as well as in theology. His eclecticism is most apparent in the festival’s Zibaldone program, one of his signature contributions. Named after poet Giacomo Leopardi’s celebrated “hodgepodge,” the section follows no single path, blending restorations, tributes, special screenings, premieres, and works connected to the festival’s guests. \n\n\tAlongside a 24-title Paul Newman retrospective, this year’s Zibaldone will showcase standouts from festival guests such as Terry Gilliam with “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” and Alexander Sokurov with “Russian Ark,” interspersed with playful programming that follows broader thematic rhythms. \n\n\tTo mark the 50th anniversary of Pier Paolo Pasolini’s final film, the festival will screen “Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom” exactly 50 years to the day of its first public screening on Nov. 22, 1975.\n\n\tAt the same time, the festival’s artistic director is bringing a similar creative energy to his curatorial vision.\n\n\t “In English, the term ‘director’ means both the director of a film and the director of a festival,” Base says. “I think that is fitting, because I approach the festival as I would a movie: with a vision, a sense of timing, and a belief in collaboration. For our opening ceremony, both Alexander Sokurov, a Russian honoree, and Sergei Loznitsa, a Ukrainian jury member, will appear on the same stage. For me, that is deeply symbolic. Cinema stands against war. It stands for dialogue, for peace, and yes, for love.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Love Island” fans can rejoice: New bombshells will be entering “Love Island: Beyond the Villa.”\n\n\tPeacock has renewed “Love Island: Beyond the Villa” for a second season, set to premiere in early 2026. Production on the series will begin the week of Nov. 10. The series will follow the lives of the “Love Island” contestants from Season 7 after leaving the competition. \n\n\n\tThe cast of “Love Island: Beyond the Villa” will include Bryan Arenales, Gracyn Blackmore, Jeremiah Brown, Clarke Carraway, Amaya Espinal, Hannah Fields, Pepe Garcia, Iris Kendall, TJ Palma, Andreina Santos, Chris Seeley, Belle-A Walker, Coco Watson and Taylor Williams, along with other islanders from season seven.    \n\t\n\n\t“Love Island: Beyond the Villa” will follow the former islanders as they navigate their newfound fame, testing out romantic relationships outside of the island, and resolving unfinished business from the summer. \n\n\n\tBefore fans can watch Season 2 of “Love Island: Beyond the Villa,” Season 7 islanders Brown, Espinal, and Kendall will appear at this year’s BravoCon, set to take place on Nov. 16. \n\n\tSeason 1 of “Love Island: Beyond the Villa” followed previous contestants from Season 6 such as Leah Kateb, Serena Page, JaNa Craig, Olivia Walker, Kaylor Martin, Miguel Harichi, Aaron Evans, Kendall Washington, Connor Newsum and Kenny Rodriguez. Previous islanders from Season 6 made guest appearances throughout the first season, which premiered on Peacock this summer.

David George, Adam Sher, Jordana Hochman, Sarah Howell, Brian Appel, Tom Ciaccio and Blake Garrett executive produce, alongside Chet Fenster.     \n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney World’s Animal Kingdom theme park has introduced a new show, “Zootopia: Better Zoogether.”\n\n\tThis nine-minute immersive experience opens Friday at the Florida park, celebrating the biomes of “Zootopia.” The show marks a full-circle moment for “Zootopia 2” co-directors Jared Bush and Byron Howard, who began discussions over three years ago about bringing something unique to Animal Kingdom.\n\n\n\t“We began our journey on the first ‘Zootopia,’” Bush says. “We came here as part of our research, spending a lot of time with the animals here and behind the scenes.” Howard adds that working with Walt Disney Imagineers to conceive the idea was a great warm-up for the duo as they prepared to dive into “Zootopia 2.” “We hadn’t touched these characters for a while, so getting our character animators involved and learning how to move them around to do crazy things was exciting.”\n\t\n\n\tAmong those “crazy things” are spitting walruses, an ice-skating spectacular and a mouse drone show.\n\n\tThe show itself blends 3D technology with 4D elements, immersing audiences in the sights, sounds, and smells of the “Zootopia” world. Bush and Howard collaborated closely with Chris Beatty, a Creative Portfolio Executive at Walt Disney Imagineering. Beatty emphasizes that the key to creating the show was telling a clear story in a short format.\n\n\t“We don’t have a two-hour time period to settle into character development, their relationships, and who they are,” Beatty explains. “We have to be very clear about the story we want to tell and how we want to convey it to our guests.” For Imagineering, everything begins with the story. The team focused on the idea of interconnectedness among all living things and how these elements are symbiotic with each other. “Zootopia’s” narrative of harmony among different biomes provided Beatty’s team with a strong foundation. Once that was established, “It was easy to start imagining places like Tundra Town, Sahara Square, and new environments in development, like Marsh Market.”\n\t\n\n\tMarsh Market is a fresh addition to the aquatic and reptilian environments of “Zootopia 2.” To submerge audiences in this world, Beatty says, “We’re using water — not just 3D animation of giant tongues coming out and lathering the audience.” He adds, “The water effects are synchronized perfectly, and the audience goes crazy.”\n\n\tIn addition to Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde returning, the show centers around Officer Clawhauser, voiced by Nate Torrence. Howard describes the beloved character Clawhauser as “our lucky charm.” He adds, “Everyone loves Claws. He’s a part of the first movie, the second movie, and now he’s a huge part of this show.” Howard concludes, “It makes complete sense to center the show around Clawhauser’s shenanigans.”\n\n\t“Zootopia 2” opens in theaters nationwide on Nov. 26.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 56th International Film Festival of India has unveiled the 10 films competing for the ICFT-UNESCO Gandhi Medal, an international honor that recognizes cinema promoting peace and inter-cultural dialogue.\n\n\tInstituted at IFFI‘s 46th edition, the award is presented in collaboration with ICFT (International Council for Film and Television) Paris under the aegis of UNESCO, celebrating work that honors Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of non-violence and peace.\n\t\n\n\tLeading the lineup is Iraqi filmmaker Hasan Hadi’s directorial debut “The President’s Cake,” which won both the Audience Award and Caméra d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival’s Directors’ Fortnight section. The film, selected as Iraq’s entry for the international feature Oscar at the 98th Academy Awards, follows nine-year-old Lamia in 1990s Iraq as she scrambles to bake the President’s birthday cake amid U.N. food sanctions and political unrest.\n\n\n\tAlso competing is Chilean auteur Sebastián Lelio’s musical drama “The Wave,” which premiered at Cannes. Loosely inspired by the 2018 Chilean feminist protests, the film follows university student Julia as she navigates a recent sexual assault within the context of a burgeoning movement.\n\n\tOther contenders include Nadia Falls’ “Brides,” which premiered at Sundance and earned a grand jury prize nomination in the World Cinema Dramatic category. The British-Muslim coming-of-age drama follows two teenage girls who run away from troubled lives, confronting radicalization, identity and belonging.\n\n\tNorwegian filmmaker Eirik Svensson’s “Safe House,” which won the Audience Dragon Award for best Nordic film at the Göteborg Film Festival, depicts 15 harrowing hours inside a Doctors Without Borders hospital during the 2013 Central African Republic civil war.\n\t\n\n\tKosovian filmmaker Ujkan Hysaj’s debut “Hana” makes its world premiere at IFFI, exploring an actor who joins an art-therapy program at a women’s rehabilitation center in Kosovo, helping war survivors transform pain into expression.\n\n\tIranian actor Ebrahim Amini’s directorial debut “K Poper,” which screens at Tallinn Black Nights, follows an Iranian teenage girl obsessed with a K-pop idol who dreams of traveling to Seoul despite her mother’s refusal.\n\n\tJapanese auteur Kawase Naomi’s “Yakushima’s Illusion,” starring Vicky Krieps, premiered at Locarno with a Golden Leopard nomination. The existential drama follows a French transplant coordinator in Japan searching for her missing partner who has become a “Johatsu” — one of Japan’s thousands of annual disappearances.\n\n\tRounding out the selection are Anupam Kher’s “Tanvi the Great,” about a woman with autism who resolves to complete her deceased father’s dream of saluting the flag at Siachen Glacier; Praveen Morchhale’s Urdu-language drama “White Snow,” about a young filmmaker whose work is banned by a religious leader; and Jitank Singh Gurjar’s Toronto Netpac Award winner “Vimukt” (“In Search of The Sky”), a Braj-language film about an elderly couple taking their son with intellectual disabilities on a pilgrimage to Maha Kumbh festival.\n\n\tThe jury will be chaired by Ahmed Bedjaoui, artistic director of the International Film Festival of Algiers, alongside Xueyan Hun, vice-president of ICFT and director of the Platform for Creativity and Innovation; Serge Michel, vice president of UNICA; Tobias Biancone, former director-general of the International Theatre Institute; and Georges Dupont, director-general of ICFT and former senior international civil servant at UNESCO.\n",

    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers for all eight episodes of “All Her Fault,” now streaming on Peacock.\n\n\tThe wild ride that is Peacock’s “All Her Fault” stars Sarah Snook and Jake Lacy as Marissa and Peter Irvine, ultra-wealthy Chicago parents of 5-year-old Milo (Duke McCloud) driven to the edge when he’s kidnapped. That Milo’s kidnapper is Carrie (Sophia Lillis), the nanny of another couple at their private school, sets off a series of events that, by the end of “All Her Fault,” have completely unraveled the Irvines’ lives. To say the least! In the finale of the limited series — created by Megan Gallagher, from Andrea Mara’s 2021 novel of the same name — Marissa has murdered (yes, murdered!) Peter in order to protect herself and Milo.\n\n\t“All Her Fault” is Snook’s first television role since she won the drama lead actress Emmy for the final season of “Succession,” and since winning both an Olivier and a Tony award for the feat of playing all 26 characters in “The Picture of Dorian Gray” on stage. (She filmed “All Her Fault” in Melbourne, Australia, her home base, in between the play’s first run on the West End and its move Broadway last spring.) As an executive producer on the show, as well as its star, Snook tells Variety that she was attracted to “All Her Fault” because she’d “never done a thriller — I’ve never really dived into this world.” The character, who is under duress from the show’s first minute, also posed an acting challenge, she says, because she “wanted to see what it’s like to live inside a harrowing moment.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Also, I read the book,” Snook says. “And it’s got a plot twist that just couldn’t say no to, you know?” That’s actually plot twists, plural. With its cliffhanger endings, and gasp-inducing reveals, “All Her Fault” joins recent thrillers such as “The Hunting Wives,” “Paradise” and “Presumed Innocent” as chaotic new entries in the 2.0 version of OMG TV.\n\n\tA synopsis: the blast radius from Milo’s kidnapping causes chaos among the Irvines, specifically with Peter’s siblings, Lia (Abby Elliott) and Brian (Daniel Monks). Their family mythology — an insidious fiction of Peter’s, as it turns out — is that, during their early childhood, Lia had caused an accident that’s left Brian disabled and in chronic pain. The fallout changed all of their lives: A guilt-ridden Lia has continuously struggled with addiction, Brian is depressed and has no self-worth — and both of them rely on Peter for their livelihoods. But then, in the show’s sixth episode, Peter finally confesses that he was the one who had tripped Brian when they were kids. This revelation is significant, because it shows Marissa that Peter is willing to lie about just about anything.\n\n\tIncluding the fact that Milo isn’t their biological son! Which Marissa discovers in the most batshit possible way. Five years earlier, during their drive home from the hospital after Milo’s birth, Peter and Marissa were in a horrific car wreck with another car, driven by a young mother named Josie (Carrie’s real name) and carrying her infant son, both of whom survived the accident. In the finale, Peter admits to Marissa, who had been knocked unconscious in the crash, that he had switched Josie’s living baby with their newborn who’d been killed.\n\n\tYears later, Carrie figured this out after meeting Milo, immediately establishing a connection with him and realizing that he too has synesthesia (long story!). Yes, it’s a stretch, but the mentally unstable Carrie is in fact correct, and, after becoming fixated on the idea that her baby had lived through the crash, poses as a nanny for Jenny (Dakota Fanning) — a parent at Milo’s school — so she can infiltrate Milo’s life.\n\n\tBut before Carrie can expose Peter to Marissa as the villain he really is — that is, not only a baby-snatcher himself, but a killer who’d also bludgeoned Carrie’s father (and fellow kidnapper) to death — Peter shoots Carrie in their living room. Milo had just been “found,” because Peter had taken him from the motel room where Carrie and her dad were keeping him, leaving the child in a car to be turned into a police station. Carrie’s dad had recorded his interaction with Peter (including the murder!); rather than let Carrie play the recording, Peter silences her at any cost. Marissa does listen afterward, but what’s she to do? Peter is right that the police will take Milo away, should Marissa tell them what he’s done.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSo as you can see, Marissa is really in a bind. But the Chekhov’s gun of “All Her Fault” is Peter’s deadly allergy to soy. After subbing out his EpiPen with an expired one, and getting rid of the First Aid kit in their car, Marissa she deliberately kisses him …. after just eating soy-filled food. And then she watches him intently as he goes into anaphylaxis — at first seeming like she wants to help, and then revealing her clear purpose. And Detective Alcaraz (Michael Peña) even figures it out eventually, but because he’s done some morally questionable things for the sake of his own son, he tells Marissa he won’t come after her for murdering Peter.\n\n\n\tWhew! Right? In its final moments, “All Her Fault” deliberately gives the finger to its title, and ends with the pleasingly matriarchal image of Marissa and Jenny (who’s also gotten rid of her husband, though not via crimes) drinking wine and looking lovingly at their two sons playing together.\n\n\tIn an interview this week, Snook talks about choosing the role of Marissa, what the show’s final shot means to her and what the most recent message on the “Succession” group chat is.\n\n\t\n\t\tThis is your first TV acting role after “Succession.” What was it that about this project and the part itself that made you want to do it?\t\n\n\t“Succession” is a career-defining highlight that I really have had to work hard to put into a separate category — it’s not something that can be repeated. There’s no trying to find projects that are going to be like “Succession” — “Succession” is its own thing, and I’d like to keep it that way!\n\t\n\n\tBut I’d never done a thriller. I’ve never really dived into this world. They’re a popular genre at the moment, and I wanted to see what it’s like to live inside a harrowing moment. Like, what is the sustainability of doing that as an actor? Also, I read the book, and it’s got a plot twist that just couldn’t say no to, you know?\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI read the book to prepare for this, and the ending is very different — it’s just a news article about Peter’s death six months later from an allergy attack abroad. Were you talking to Megan Gallagher about the kinds of things she was changing to fill out that ending?\t\n\n\tI respectfully let Megan take the lead on that, obviously, and she’s such a brilliant writer, and had really expanded the universe of what the book offers. There’s the novel that explores it in different ways, and it’s set in Dublin — and then we’ve got the series that is set in Chicago and really goes into different worlds.\n\n\tChanging the ending in the ways that we did — obviously, the major part isn’t changed as much. But having Marissa have that last say was really important to wrapping up our story.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s go into the spoilers! So at the beginning of the finale, Marissa learns that Peter is not only is a literal murderer, but that he’d switched Milo — I can barely say this — with their infant who had died in the car accident. How do you even approach figuring out how a person would deal with such revelations?\t\n\n\tExactly! How do you begin? It felt very Greek tragedy to me. It felt very much like these are gods and deities fooling around with human lives, and making bad decisions. Marissa definitely had to have the last word, I think. In the book, it’s a quiet final moment — an allusion to Peter dying via poisoning. But here, it’s much more activated for Marissa to take back the control of her own narrative.\n\n\tAnd dealing with the revelation that Milo isn’t her son — if it was real life, you receive that information, and it doesn’t all sink in in that one moment. There’s going to be something beyond Episode 8 and the show’s final moments: The revelations will still continue to sink in, and the shock will still continue to ricochet for Marissa and for Milo. Fortunately, she has the friendship of Jenny to find strength from.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou alluded to this, but in “All Her Fault,” there are so many scenes of heightened emotion — within five minutes, she’s found out that her child is missing, and that pitch is sustained over eight episodes. Yet “Succession” was so singularly restrained. What was your experience of that? \t\n\n\tYeah, I mean, that’s part of the reason I said yes, and I wanted to be a part of the project as well. Shiv was such a restrained and repressed character emotionally. She had short outbursts of rage and other kind of bites. And also, her maternal instincts — who knows?\n\t\n\n\tWhereas Marissa definitely, confidently, wants to be a mum. Always has wanted to be a mum! Always wanted to have that close family life. It’s something that she didn’t have growing up. We hear a little bit about her history. But she’s got a sort of small life with her husband, her brother-and-sister-in-law and her kid. And that’s what she likes. It’s cozy. And to have it all sort of blown up is — that’s a challenge coming in as an actor to think, “OK, we’re gonna have to sustain this for how long?” But it’s also a rewarding challenge.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAt first, it seems like maybe Marissa is going to have to stay quiet about all the things Peter did, because, as he says, she’s scared that Milo will be taken away from her. Did you decide for yourself when it is that Marissa decides to kill Peter?\t\n\n\tYeah, there’s a moment in the scene with Jenny. It’s one of those things where you kind of go, “OK, now there’s no turning back.” So the “now there’s no turning back” is the moment she’s just kissed him, I think. There’s turning back up until the deed is done.\n\n\tI think she knows intuitively that she can’t have this revolting human being around her anymore, and have any kind of influence over her son. Imagine the custody battle with that man! So she knows that he has to go. He just has to go. And he deserves to.\n\n\tBut what does the future hold for Marissa if that truth ever comes to light? Which is why I really loved that scene with Detective Alcaraz, where he sort of infers that, yes, he knows everything, and yet still has the grace to tell her that he knows everything — and also to stand back and say, but I’m gonna let it go.\n\t\n\t\tYou don’t have a line in that scene, I think! What was that like to play with Michael Peña?\t\n\n\tIt’s amazing. I mean, acting is always reacting and listening, and so there may not be actual lines, but there’s all sorts of things going on in her head. Listening to these revelations and calculating, “OK, am I safe? Am I not? Is this good for me? Is this bad for me?” And just getting to watch Michael Peña act is great. \n\t\n\t\tThe scene when Marissa kills Peter by kissing him with her soy-infected mouth — can you talk about filming that with Jake Lacy as Marissa watches Peter die? \t\n\n\tIt’s a really complex scene to approach, because you don’t want to lean into melodrama or histrionic kind of, like, “Die!” — like throwing the eyebrows up and eyeballs down. There’s just so much release going on, and it’s a very complex, very difficult scene to play. And hopefully we got the tone right, but it was one I was worried about.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAnd it seems like she doesn’t want to indicate too early to him that she’d done it on purpose in case, maybe, someone is about to appear with an EpiPen or something.\t\n\n\tYeah, absolutely.\n\t\n\t\tBut it’s so clear in those final moments, when he’s looking at her and she glares at him, and says, “That’s true — I manage your allergy for you.” Were there other versions when she reveals it earlier?\t\n\n\tProbably in the edit there were times when in enacting it, there’s indications earlier. But it’s better for tension to leave it right to the last minute, because you want to know, “Is he gonna die knowing? Is he gonna die not knowing?” There’s much more tension in that. I think.\n\t\n\t\tI mean, he sure dies knowing! In the final scene, when Jacob and Milo are playing as Marissa and Jenny are watching — hilarious. Can you talk about that scene, and how you decided to play it?\t\n\n\tYou have to be able to breathe out with a story like this. You’ve got to be able to go, [exhales], “Oh, OK.” Like, everything’s probably gonna be OK. You have to find, what’s the rainbow here? And the risk is to make something too shiny and too wrapped up and too like, “Aha! Now the two friends can be friends forever, and what’s gonna happen next?”\n\n\tSo we had to try and strike a balance between too shiny and also realistic. But realistically, what Marissa and Jenny really found in their friendship was that it was the strongest bond in their lives. So for me, it totally made sense: I’m gonna move as close as I can to create a community, to really, to really start again in the way that I’m in control of my own narrative. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCouSarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBy the end of the show, Marissa has murdered her husband — which she’s gotten away with — after she has learned that her son was stolen from the woman who’d kidnapped him. This is all traumatic! What do you think Marissa would do next?\t\n\n\tIt’s crazy. I mean, for a little while, just deal with the whiplash of all those revelations. I think at some point Milo is going to have to know or find out, or he’s going to cotton onto something, and she has to support him in the dealing of grief of losing his father. He’s gotta get over all the trauma of being away from us, and being kidnapped. But then also, he’s going to deal with the grief of losing his father as a 5-year-old. And the difficulty for Marissa to uphold which memory: The memory of this amazing dad, the one that Milo remembers? Or the real truth of who Peter really was. And that’s going to be difficult for Marissa.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tMarissa is extremely rich, which is Shiv Roy-like, though the characters are so different. Did you ever think of Shiv as you were creating Marissa?\t\n\n\tOnly in the sense of like that they’re wealthy characters. I think Shiv is in a different category. She’s in this astronomical wealth elite, whereas Marissa is more socially wealthy and you might meet her on the street. You wouldn’t meet Shiv on the street.\n\t\n\t\tNo, Shiv doesn’t go on the street! \t\n\n\tI think Marissa is more of a reflection of myself, maybe — much more personable, warm. Whereas Shiv is much more of a cold-hearted bitch. She’s a different kind of stern character.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat do you think Marissa sees in Jenny that creates that immediate bond? I mean, she really risks her well-being by telling Jenny what Peter did.\t\n\n\tI think she sees a comrade, a compatriot. In the shooting of the scene in the bathroom — where they turn up in the same dress — we had to make sure that that was a really believable rapport-building, grounding, beginning of a friendship. That you go, “I really like that person.”\n\n\tSome people just have chemistry, and you can’t fake it; Marissa and Jenny, they have chemistry. They go well together. And this is a kind of circumstance that, unfortunately, has thrown them together. But they found real strength and empowerment from each other. And yeah, it is a risk to let her know what her plans are regarding Peter. But in some ways, you kind of have just got to offload, and share it with somebody. Maybe that’s the takeaway — keeping secrets to yourself is often doomed to fail.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t“Cold-hearted bitch” as she was, I do miss Shiv! Do you ever find yourself imagining what she might be up to?\t\n\n\tI think Jesse Armstrong, the creator, put it really well, when he said at one point, “I don’t really believe that people can change. They’re always going to be who they are, inevitably.” There’s an inevitability, I think, about people. And there’s something about that with Shiv, like she probably is still second next to Tom. In some ways, still in charge, and in some ways scratching, scrapping, reaching for — but always just missing out. And that’ll always be the source of great frustration and annoyance for her.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was the last text on the “Succession” group chat?\t\n\n\tLet me find out! I’ll see if I can say it — one second [looks at phone]. It’s been active recently, because they all came to the show, and I sent them a smiley face with love hearts and a celebratory-like emoji. But Dag wrote, “Can’t wait to see you later, Sarah!” And Fisher [Stevens] was like, “Good luck! Wish I could be there, but not in New York.”\n\t\n\t\tBoring! You filmed this in between your two stints of “The Picture of Dorian Gray.” Was it a relief to play one person instead of 26?\t\n\n\tYes! Although I don’t know if you could ever really describe this character — and what Marissa goes through — as a relief. But a different kind of compartmentalizing going on, yeah.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat’s next for you, do you know?\t\n\n\tDon’t know yet! Other than that, at the end of this press tour, I am unemployed. [cackles] And I’m quite happy about it.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJust when you thought there was nothing left to reboot, remake or revive, TV is riding a new wave of nostalgia. And this time, there’s a turn-of-the-century twist.\n\n\tShows from the late 1990s and early 2000s are back in play: “Scrubs,” which ran from 2001 to 2010, relaunches on ABC on Feb. 25 with new and returning cast members. Sarah Michelle Gellar returns as part of the “Buffy, the Vampire Slayer” (1997-2003) sequel series from Chloé Zhao, expected to premiere on Hulu in 2026. And Disney+ is behind the limited-series reunion of “Malcolm in the Middle” (2000-06), expected in the spring and featuring Bryan Cranston, Frankie Muniz and the rest of the original cast. \n\t\n\n\tThat’s just the top of the list of reboots and revivals in the works. Hulu just ordered to series a new version of “Prison Break” (2005-09, with a 2017 revisit), from Elgin James and starring Emily Browning. Kerry Washington is developing a new take on “Desperate Housewives,” dubbed “Wisteria Lane,” at Onyx Collective. The teams behind “blue sky” series like “White Collar” and “Royal Pains” are also attempting to revive their shows. And a “Community” movie has been greenlit by Peacock, though scheduling conflicts have held up production.\n\n\n\tThese projects all join recent entries including a double shot from TV megaproducer Greg Daniels, whose updated take on “King of the Hill” (with Mike Judge) was met with rave reviews — and has just been renewed for two more seasons — while his “The Office” offshoot, “The Paper” (created with Michael Koman) did well for Peacock and premieres on NBC for a linear run this Monday.\n\t\n\n\tWhat’s driving this trend, in part, is demographic shifts: As millennials hit middle age, they’re more interested in nostalgia for the shows from their youth. And their Gen Z children, who binged them on streaming, are intrigued too.\n\n\t“Millennials are reaching that age where they’re watching things because they want to pass a lot of them to their kids, and they have a lot more force as a consumer group because of their size, as well as just having nostalgia for these things,” says former The WB president Jordan Levin, who was instrumental in programming for that age group when they were teens.\n\n\tReboots, remakes and revivals have been a part of the TV landscape since the beginning (think of the many iterations of “The Honeymooners,” “Dragnet” or later, “The Brady Bunch”). The idea of “getting the band back together” intensified in the multichannel age, as programmers leaned on familiar titles because their built-in awareness made them easier to market in a cluttered landscape.\n\n\tStreaming in its early days was built on the backs of revivals: “Arrested Development,” “FullerHouse” and “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” were early Netflix entries, while Hulu ramped up its slate with “Veronica Mars” and “Animaniacs” revisits, Peacock launched with “Punky Brewster,” “Saved by the Bell” and “Bel-Air” and Paramount+ came out of the gate with “The Real World” reunion seasons, new “Rugrats,” a return to “iCarly” and a new take on “The Twilight Zone.”\n\n\tBut it’s not easy to recapture the magic of the original — which is why the majority of these revivals don’t last more than a handful of seasons. The return of “Will & Grace” opened big in 2017 but quickly fizzled, as did attempts to bring back “Murphy Brown” and “Mad About You.” “Punky Brewster” and “Saved by the Bell” quickly went away, and more recently, “Frasier,” “That ’90s Show” and “Night Court” couldn’t go the distance. (CBS Studios tried to shop “Frasier” to other platforms after the show was canceled at Paramount+, but had no luck.) \n\n\t“They’re never as good, and you can’t help but compare it to the original,” says one TV showrunner who has chosen not to reboot their show.\n\t\n\n\tSeries that have successfully been revived include “Roseanne,” which continued as “The Conners” for seven seasons even after Roseanne Barr was fired. In animation, besides the roaring return of “King of the Hill,” the new seasons of “Futurama” and “Phineas and Ferb” have also made a splash in their comebacks.\n\n\tWith so much stigma on trying to revive long-dormant shows, some stars and showrunners would rather just gather for a reunion special. “Friends” did one on HBO Max in 2021, while CBS just taped a 30th anniversary “Everybody Loves Raymond” event that will air on Nov. 24. And in January, the cast of “Married … With Children” is coming together onstage in Los Angeles for a non-televised reunion. Then there are the countless rewatch podcasts hosted by former stars of fan favorite shows.\n\n\tPerhaps there’s a lesson somewhere that not everything needs a revival. “It fundamentally comes down to, is there a reason for it to be that is artistic?” says Levin. “Is there a purpose? Is there a catalyst for it that goes beyond simply economics and marketing and awareness? We certainly have seen underlying intellectual property that gets rebooted in a fresh way because someone takes it and makes it their own.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDavid Harbour is not having a good month. But attendees at the Los Angeles premiere event on Nov. 6 for the fifth and final season of Netflix’s “Stranger Things” might not have noticed.\n\n\tHarbour was all smiles on the red carpet, particularly as he playfully hugged co-star Millie Bobby Brown, and they took selfies with fans. The two arrived at the event together, and even traded compliments in interviews on the carpet: Brown told “Entertainment Tonight” that she “obviously had a really special bond with David because we have a father-daughter relationship, and we do every scene together… It’s been so special to have him along the journey for me.” When Harbour spoke with ET, the only outlet he granted an interview, he said of Brown: “I adore her, and I’ve been proud to watch all of them grow up and become such great artists… this particular project is so special, and we’ve gotten to know each other so deeply.”\n\t\n\n\tIf the two seemed overly chummy on Thursday, perhaps that was the point: The premiere event came just days after the U.K.’s Daily Mail Nov. 1 report that Brown had filed a complaint of bullying and harassment against Harbour prior to the start of production of Season 5. Neither star commented on the story, and Harbour limited his interactions with the press at the premiere.\n\n\n\tThe news of Brown’s complaint against Harbour has threatened to overshadow coverage of the final season of “Stranger Things.” But insiders say that even before the recent news, Harbour wasn’t expected to take part in press junkets for the show due to his busy filming schedule. (His upcoming projects next year include HBO’s “DTF St. Louis” — with Jason Bateman and Linda Cardellini — and Marvel’s “Avengers: Doomsday,” opening December 2026.)\n\t\n\n\tPR experts suggested to Variety that the red carpet choreography — as well as the full cast’s appearance together on stage at the TCL Chinese Theater prior to screening Episode 1 — was meant to send a message that the cast is united, and that the show is bigger than any one person. “The goal in these situations is to make it no worse,” one crisis PR exec said.\n\n\tInstead, Netflix leaned into the imagery of Harbour and Brown being playful on the carpet, posting a video of the two as they greeted fans. Brown’s fashion brand, Florence by Mills, liked the video and posted a heart emoji, and many of the fan comments on the post suggested that they thought the reports of drama between the two stars was much ado about nothing. Photos taken inside the party also show the two being chummy.\n\n\n\tSources with knowledge of the situation have confirmed to Variety that there was an investigation into Brown’s complaint, and that it was resolved. As father and daughter on the show, as well as comrades in arms, Brown and Harbour share multiple scenes in Season 5 of “Stranger Things,” including a scene observed by a reporter for Variety during a day-long visit to the set in July 2024.\n\n\tRepresentatives for Brown, Harbour and Netflix did not respond to requests for comment. On the carpet, the show’s creative leaders — creators Matt and Ross Duffer, and executive producer Shawn Levy — were asked about the complaint directly by the Hollywood Reporter; while they declined to speak about the actors by name, they all spoke about the importance of ensuring their cast feels safe within the “family” atmosphere of the show.\n\n\t“I’ve read a bunch of stories and they range from wildly inaccurate to…there’s so much noise around it,” Levy told the outlet. “But the truth is that we view this crew and this cast as family, and so we treat each other with respect, and that’s always been bedrock.” Said Ross Duffer: “We’ve been doing this for 10 years with this cast, and at this point they’re family and we deeply care about them. So, you know, nothing matters more than just having a set where everyone feels safe and happy.”\n\n\tIn the first four seasons of “Stranger Things,” Brown’s character, Eleven (introduced in Season 1 as a quiet, pre-teen girl with extraordinary telekinetic abilities), and Harbour’s character, Hopper (introduced as the burnout chief of police of Hawkins, Indiana), form a surrogate father-daughter bond. In Seasons 2 and 3, Eleven and Hopper experience some friction due to Hopper’s overprotective concern for Eleven’s safety; by Season 4, the characters operate in totally separate storylines and don’t share a scene until the last minutes of the season finale.\n\t\n\n\tThe Daily Mail report was sourced to “a friend” of Harbour’s ex-wife Lily Allen. That’s of note because the story of Brown’s complaint broke amid a flurry of attention surrounding Harbour’s divorce from singer-songwriter Allen, whose new album, “West End Girl,” goes into extensive detail about Harbour’s alleged infidelity, as in the song “Pussy Palace.” In his review in Variety, Chris Willman said the album “is a divorce record with a capital D,” and that Allen and Harbour split up “after five years of marriage that apparently started as a fairy-tale romance for her and ended in the devastation strewn throughout every track on the album.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNina Hoss enters a conversation about “Hedda” the way her character Eileen Lövborg enters that fateful party: She commands the space, is unapologetically present and utterly impossible to overlook.\n\n\tThe German actress, who spent six years performing “Hedda Gabler” on stage in Berlin’s demanding repertoire system, now takes on Nia DaCosta’s bold reimagining of the Ibsen classic — playing a character that didn’t exist in the original text. It’s a transformation that reflects Hoss’s artistic fearlessness and the kind of creative risks that make century-old material feel urgent again.\n\t\n\n\t“When I read the script, I thought, why has no one ever thought about that?” Hoss tells Variety‘s Awards Circuit Podcast of DaCosta’s decision to gender-swap the male character Eilert Lövborg into Eileen. “It makes it so interesting for the other female characters. All of a sudden it becomes this triangle of three very, in their own right, complicated, nuanced, colorful female characters. And that wasn’t in the play.”\n\n\n\tFor Hoss, the lasting appeal of “Hedda,” both on stage and now on screen, lies in its exploration of internal conflict and social paralysis. “What is it that we, being male or female, don’t allow ourselves to do? To live the life we really want, to follow the desires or passions we feel inside?” she asks. “We think we can’t do it because society expects something of us, or because we feel we’re queer, and we think, no, I can’t live that life. That is what I find so interesting, and always fascinating.”\n\n\tIn DaCosta’s version, Eileen is no longer a boozy male intellectual but a woman fighting to be taken seriously — as a writer, an academic and a person. “Her struggle to enter the academic world, to be respected as a writer, as a person — even as an openly queer person — became so much more front-facing and deep,” Hoss explains. The gender reversal reshapes not only Eileen but the entire narrative architecture.\n\t\n\n\tOscar buzz is building for Hoss’s fierce, emotionally expansive performance, with many industry observers positioning her as a formidable contender for best supporting actress — what would be her first Academy Award nomination. The recognition feels long overdue for an actress who has delivered consistently extraordinary work across two decades, yet was overlooked for her haunting turns in “Barbara” (2012), “Phoenix” (2015) and most recently as the calculating partner to an enigmatic musician in “Tár” (2022). Her work in “Hedda” showcases the full range of her gifts. If the Academy is finally ready to embrace one of international cinema’s most compelling actors, this could be her moment.\n\n\tWorking with DaCosta — who joins Todd Field and Christian Petzold in the roster of visionary directors Hoss has collaborated with — was another transformative experience. “What they all have in common is that, at the end of the day, they’re deeply curious about what we bring to the table as actors,” she says. “They have this kind of childlike curiosity — ‘What are you going to do with it?’ And that’s the best, because you feel so trusted.”\n\n\tFor Hoss, who describes herself as “very much an interpreter” rather than a producer or director, that trust is essential. Splitting her time between German theater and international films, she approaches each role with a careful mix of instinct and collaboration. “I’ve done theater. I always go back home and do German films, because I find having that base important,” she says. “I don’t belong to anyone. I’m open to the right material and the collaborators who are fascinating to me.”\n\n\tIn “Hedda,” Hoss embodies a woman who refuses to shrink herself. Her costume — a custom-made dress with a corset and voluminous skirt — reflects a character who, while recovering from addiction, walks boldly into a space designed to undo her. “She’s unapologetically female,” Hoss says. “She walks into a room full of men in suits and says, ‘Here I am.’ She’s not hiding. She’s not seductive in the conventional sense — she just is.”\n\n\t“There’s something weirdly joyous about Hedda,” Hoss adds, speaking of a character defined by entrapment. Perhaps that’s because she recognizes the universal truth beneath the period costumes and theatrical origins: we are all, in some way, “these weird creatures that have a free will, but we’re kind of stuck inside ourselves.” In DaCosta’s pressure-cooker reimagining, that suffocation becomes not just visible but visceral — and through Hoss’s performance, unexpectedly, powerfully alive.\n\n\tOn this episode of the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast, she discusses her role in DaCosta’s film, reflects on a changing Hollywood and what we can expect from her future roles. Listen below!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNina Hoss, “Hedda” (Amazon MGM Studios /Everett Collection)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©MGM/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRead excerpts from his interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n\tYou played Hedda Gabler on stage for six years. What was that experience like, and how did it prepare you for this film?\n\t\n\n\tJust to explain — that’s possible because of the repertoire system we have in Germany. I might perform “Hedda Gabler” six times a month, or sometimes just twice, depending on what else is running. One night might be “Medea,” the next “Hedda.” At one point, I had six plays in rotation at the same time. So you’re not doing the same play every night for six years.\n\n\tThe beauty of that system, despite its challenges, is that you grow older with the characters. You understand them differently each time. I never got bored — not once. She’s trapped, but there’s also an invitation to explore that entrapment. Those questions make “Hedda” endlessly fascinating to me.\n\n\tHow did the gender reversal in the film affect your character and the overall story?\n\n\tIn the original play, Eilert Lövborg is a man — Hedda’s former lover. There’s tension between them, but it’s never fully realized. He’s an alcoholic who tells her wild stories, always returning to her with tales of his debauchery.\n\n\tBut Nia reimagined it completely. Instead of talking about the party, we’re all in it — this one-night pressure cooker. And Eilert becomes Eileen, which changes everything. Now she’s a female writer, openly queer, trying to survive in an academic world that still doesn’t take her seriously. Her battle — to be seen, to be heard, to be respected — is more immediate, more layered.\n\n\tIt also makes the dynamic between the women electrifying. Suddenly, you have this triangle of three complex, nuanced and deeply human female characters. That wasn’t there in the original, and I thought, it was a brilliant decision.\n\n\tYou’ve worked with incredible directors like Nia DaCosta, Todd Field and Christian Petzold. What draws you to these collaborations?\n\n\tIt always begins with the material. That’s the foundation. If something excites me on the page, and I meet the director and we can talk for hours — that’s the sign. We’re aligned in how we see the world, how we want to tell stories. If we connect in conversation, I know we can work well together.\n\n\tWhat’s remarkable about Todd, Christian and Nia is that they trust actors. They have a strong vision, yes — but they’re also curious. They want to see what you’ll bring. That sense of trust opens you up. You want to give everything.\n\n\tWith “Hedda,” playing Eileen was a journey through every emotion imaginable. At first, she seems to have it all under control — but then it unravels. There’s something heartbreaking in that, but also something very alive. And being supported by an ensemble like Tessa Thompson, Imogen Poots and Tom Bateman — it was a joy, honestly.\n\n\tThe costumes in the film are visually striking. What was your involvement in shaping Eileen’s look?\n\t\n\n\tOh, they were essential. Lindsay, our costume designer, was brilliant. We could have gone the expected route — suits, masculine tailoring, a Katharine Hepburn type. But I felt Eileen should be intellectual, yes, but not hiding her body. She doesn’t lead with her sexuality, but she also doesn’t minimize it.\n\n\tThere’s a key scene where her dress becomes translucent when wet, so the fabric had to be carefully chosen. I also thought she needed a corset — she’s a recovering addict stepping back into temptation. The corset helps her hold it together. And the skirt takes up space. When she walks into a room full of men in suits, she claims that space.\n\n\tEven the imperfections in the costume — the slightly off-shoulder veil, the asymmetry — hint at the cracks in her composure. When a costume does that for you, you don’t have to act it. It’s already speaking.\n\n\tYou split your time between theater and film. How do you choose your projects?\n\n\tI’ve never made lists of dream roles. Maybe that’s a bit naive, but I believe the right things find you. I’m not Reese Witherspoon or Nicole Kidman, producing my own work — though I admire them deeply. But I trust that if I stay open and committed, the right projects come.\n\n\tFor example, I always dreamed of doing something like “Wild” — a road movie on foot. And this May, I shot “The Other Side” with Mariko Minoguchi, a half-German, half-Japanese director. It’s a dystopian story set in the Alps. I could never have imagined that script, but when it came to me, I grabbed it.\n\n\tAre you hopeful about the roles available to women, especially those over a “certain age”?\n\n\tYes. I really believe it’s our time now — women in our 40s and 50s. There are more of us telling stories, more of us wanting to see our full selves on screen. And I think we’re finding each other. As collaborators, as creators, we’re building space for that representation.\n\n\tWith “Hedda,” there was some hesitation. It’s three women at the helm, and that made some people nervous. But it premiered in Toronto and people wanted to talk about it. The studio stood behind us. Sometimes it takes a moment — but those experiences make me hopeful.\n\n\tI’ve realized I’m not the one who pushes things into the world — that’s a particular skill set. I help develop and shape the work, and I hang in there. If nothing comes for a while, I trust something will. And that trust, that faith in the work — that’s what keeps me going.\n\t\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

    "body": "\n\tWhen Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi first auditioned for “Predator: Badlands,” he didn’t know he was trying out to play the first of the titular aliens to be the hero, instead of a villain, in the 38-year-old franchise. In fact, he didn’t know he was auditioning for a “Predator” film at all. He wasn’t even provided with any written lines.\n\n\t“All it said was ‘a creature,’” Schuster-Koloamatangi says. “The little character brief just said, ‘It’s all up to your interpretation.’”\n\t\n\n\tThe 24-year-old actor has had to rely on his own imagination. As a kid in Auckland, New Zealand, he relished going to his local cinema and drank in movies as often as he could. But as the child of a Tongan father and Samoan mother, “I grew up not really seeing too many Polynesians on screen,” he says. “I didn’t think it was possible, to be honest, to have a brown face on screen, especially from my end of the world.” \n\n\n\tInstead, as part of a family of athletes, Schuster-Koloamatangi saw rugby as a possible career path. “Growing up, it’s either rugby or go to university and get a nine to five,” he says. “Acting was never, never something I thought was even possible.”\n\n\tEven so, he found himself drawn to performing. In middle school, he started his own YouTube channel — until it was taken down for copyright infringement (which he didn’t know at the time would be an issue). In high school, he acted in school plays and took a media studies course his final year, where he met two Tongan filmmakers and peppered them with questions. A few months later, they called him in to audition for a small role in a New Zealand miniseries about a Kiwi rugby player. He nailed it.\n\t\n\n\t“It was only, like, three scenes, and my character died,” he says. But from there he landed an agent, and then the lead role in the 2021 miniseries “The Panthers,” about a group of Polynesian youths who form their own political movement inspired by the American Black Panther Party. It was then “the switch started.”\n\n\t“I’ve never been good at anything off the bat,” he says. “I’ve always just kind of been average or below average, so I’ve had to really work at things to be good. It’s cultivated just a ruthless work ethic.” He took acting courses to hone his craft and dedicated himself to the profession.\n\n\t“I have big ideas,” he says, breaking into an infectious grin. “When I decided fully that this is the career path that I want to chase, it came with a lot of big visions. … I see myself going to the Oscars. I see myself with all the top players. I see myself being on the biggest stage possible. And I’ll get there somehow.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi, Elle Fanning and Dan Trachtenberg at the “Predator: Badlands” premiere in London.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLia Toby/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWith his performance in “Predator: Badlands,” Schuster-Koloamatangi has taken his first big step into that spotlight. He plays Dek, a young member of the alien species known as Yautja who is cast out by his father for being the “runt” of the clan. To prove himself, Dek travels to Genna — known as one of the deadliest planets in the galaxy due to its profusion of lethal animal and plant life — so he can hunt and kill the Kalisk, understood to be an unkillable predator in its own right.\n\n\tBecause the role is so intensely physical, for Schuster-Koloamatangi’s second audition, director Dan Trachtenberg (who also helmed the 2022 “Predator” prequel film “Prey” and the animated feature “Predator: Killer of Killers,” released in June) had the actor tackle an obstacle course with a team of stunt performers — some of whom were also gunning for the part.\n\n\t“The way Dimitrius moved was so cool, so ferocious — so much cooler than the stuntmen were doing it, frankly,” Trachtenberg says. “What I was not prepared for was him throwing down on set and really being incredibly powerful and intense. He just insanely elevated the movie far past what we could have expected.”\n\t\n\n\tSchuster-Koloamatangi’s only co-star, Elle Fanning, plays Thia, an android who’s been stranded on Genna without her legs. Dek carries her on his back for most of the film. It’s a fitting metaphor for the task that faced Schuster-Koloamatangi, who has the weight of the entire film on his fearsome shoulders, in a performance delivered entirely in the invented Yautja language, wearing a full Yautja body suit with his face replaced via performance capture CGI.\n\n\tHe spoke with Variety about his unconventional audition process, the how he bonded — literally and figuratively — with Fanning, the experience of shooting in his home country and how he mastered the Yautja language.\n\n\t\n\t\tSince you didn’t know the character, let alone the movie, at first, how did you audition for “Predator: Badlands”?\t\n\n\tI had to do one in English, one in an alien language that’s up to you to make up. I had a lot of fun just remixing Samoan and Tongan and gibberish. From there, I got a call back, and it was an obstacle course. I was like, what is this job? \n\t\n\t\tHow did you approach the obstacle course?\t\n\n\tBecause I am competitive, I had to keep reminding myself, “It’s not a race.” I had to keep slowing down to focus on performance, just show as much creature as I could. They had been drip feeding us information throughout. I was finding out, like, the director is Dan Trachtenberg, the studio is [20th Century]. I was doing a little research in the background, like, “Wait, this could be Predator, but I’m not sure.” So I just took a swing and was aiming my performance towards a Predator-like creature. I think it worked.\n\t\n\t\tHad you done obstacle course, Ninja Warrior-type stuff before?\t\n\n\tNo, that was my first time. I was like, “What am I even doing here?” They had stunt men hanging around doing flips and whatnot. The people that I was auditioning with, a few of them were stunt people that had been in the game for a long time. It would have been easy to kind of overthink it. But I don’t know. I grew up playing sports and just having the mindset, “You’re supposed to be here.” Not getting too caught up in imposter syndrome, you know? Just give it your best. If it doesn’t work out, it’s not mean to be. But it was really exciting. I felt like I was in “Wipeout.” I was just missing the big red balls. It was cool, man.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t20th Century Studios\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOnce you got the part, when did you understand that you were going to be carrying Elle Fanning on your back?\t\n\n\tSo that’s funny, too. The first read through of the script, I saw that Dek carries Thia on his backpack, and I was like, “This is a great idea, but this will be like, CGI, right? This isn’t actually going to be a thing because she has legs in real life.” But with Dan, he can make anything a reality. We were rehearsing with the stunt team for a month all the different rigs that they had come up with to carry Elle on my back. It worked really well. Elle’s legs were in a sling. They both had us in harnesses. When we were strapped up, we couldn’t get ourselves out. Someone had to unscrew us to release us. It was a massive learning process. They were making up rigs on the spot to accommodate the both of us. I think it adds texture to the film, and it makes it feel real and authentic. You can see it on Dek’s face.\n\t\n\t\tI understand that you met Elle when you started work in rehearsal. How did you break the ice there?\t\n\n\tIt happened so naturally that I couldn’t even tell you when exactly we just started clicking. I had my reservations a little bit before meeting her. She’s a massive name, and with that comes a little bit of uncertainty on how she might be. But Dan said that Elle was really down to earth and lovely to work with, and from the first second of properly talking to her, I could tell she was going to be a breeze. Once we were strapped up, I was always checking in and making sure she was good, and I think she really appreciated that. So the trust formed quite fast. \n\n\tWe had literal hours strapped together. A lot of the time they would just leave us strapped because it was too much time and effort to release us while they moved around cameras. There would be days where we just stayed linked up and would just talk about random things. \n\t\n\t\tI imagine bathroom breaks must have been very tricky.\t\n\n\tOh man, those were the worst. In the suit, you can’t really get in and out too easy. So I’m kind of cramped up in the bathroom stall. My body’s in a C shape, trying to track the aim. It was a whole process. If someone had a camera in there, they would make a lot of money from the positions I tried to be in to go to the bathroom.\n\t\n\t\tYou also performed in the Yautja language, invented by linguist Britton Watkins solely for this film and “Predators: Killer of Killers.” \t\n\n\tI thought I wouldn’t have to learn any lines because in the audition process — they were like, “Make up a language.” So I was like, “Man, I can just freestyle the whole time. This is great!” Later on, they told me I had to learn a whole language. So that was fun.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat was your process to learn that language?\t\n\n\tI was on Zoom calls with the linguist, probably three to four times a week the month before [filming]. When I wasn’t doing stunt work and training, I was at home, drilling the language over and over. That’s the only way to learn any language. You just have to fully immerse yourself in it. And because it was constructed like a real language, there was a lot of material that Britton had come up with to learn. I’d just have it in the car when I’m driving everywhere, on my speaker at home, when I’m chilling, practicing. The clicking with the throat was probably the hardest just get my head around, because you have to breathe out while breathing in at the same time. It was just getting my mouth and my throat used to those movements, and a lot of honey ginger teas.\n\t\n\t\tWere you always speaking the language on set, or were you sometimes doing it in English?\t\n\n\tThe majority of the time was in the language. There would be a few days where we’d get new lines, like, 10 minutes before we shot, and we couldn’t get the translation fast enough from Britton, so those would have to be shot in English and then later [recorded] again in Yautja. \n\t\n\t\tYou grew up in New Zealand, so how did it feel to shoot in your home country?\t\n\n\tI was very proud to show off my backyard. You’d hear all the Americans raving about the landscape, and I’m standing there like, “Yeah, this is standard” — but in actuality, I hadn’t been to some of these locations before and I was just as in awe. Hūnua Falls, Bethells Beach, the Redwoods in Rotorua — these were all places that I had never been before, even though it was my home. A lot of locals don’t really take the time to see their own country. They always feel like they have to sightsee somewhere else. I was very blessed and fortunate because of the access the film gave us. If it wasn’t for the shooting, I wouldn’t even be allowed in some of these places that are blocked off to the public. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t20TH CENTURY STUDIOS\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat was it like to see your performance transformed into Dek’s face as a Yautja for the first time?\t\n\n\tI only just watched the full cut when we were in London for the premiere. I hadn’t seen any cuts with CGI when I started doing ADR. It was just still my face. So I didn’t really know if this was going to work. I worked really hard on the Predator’s animalistic and primal behaviors, that presence that he has in all the previous films. But at the same time, I was also trying to inject my own unique flavor to Dek — they shouldn’t all look and be the same. \n\n\tBut once I saw all of the finished product, it was so cool to see. And it was really cool to be able to separate myself from it as well. A lot of the times when I’m watching things that I’m in, I can’t help but just nitpick at things. But since it looks like an alien, I can just watch the story and fully invest, like an audience member.\n\t\n\t\tNow that you’ve got your first Hollywood movie behind you, what about the past year has most surprised you?\t\n\n\tIt sounds really bad, but I think because I’ve seen it so clearly in my mind before that it didn’t really come as too much as a surprise. The best thing that has come out of this year was I was able to bring my family to the premiere in L.A., and they got to see me work. None of them are in the industry, so none of them really know anything about what I do. I’ll go home and tell them, like, “Work was good,” but they didn’t really know even what to ask. \n\t\n\t\tDo you know what you’re next going to do?\t\n\n\tI’m working on a local New Zealand film at the moment. I land on Saturday back home. I go into rehearsals on Sunday and then we start shooting on Monday. I get to get back to my roots a little bit. It follows a young Tongan immigrant who is trying to make a living for himself back in the ’90s. It goes from a comedy-drama to a thriller. I’m really excited for it. I get to play human for this one, which is great.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

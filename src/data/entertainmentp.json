    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tHudson Williams is getting people to read again.\n\n\tSince the “Heated Rivalry” star signed onto Crave’s adaptation of “Yaga,” physical copies of Kat Sandler’s original screenplay instantly sold out online. It’s officially back in stock on Amazon, where it’s rushed back to the top of bestseller lists.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tSandler, a Canadian playwright, will serve as writer and showrunner on the eight-episode TV series. The genre-blending play reimagines the Baba Yaga myth as a modern murder mystery. The story follows a detective investigating the disappearance of the young heir to a yogurt fortune in a small town, where the case becomes entangled with local folklore, a sharp and enigmatic university professor, and a web of suspicious characters. As the investigation deepens, the play mixes whodunit suspense with fairy-tale elements, using the Baba Yaga legend to explore power, gender, ageism, and the way “wicked women” are portrayed in stories.\n\n\n\t“’Yaga’ has evolved from myth to stage to my first greenlit series, reclaiming the wicked witch and reshaping her as an incendiary feminist antihero for our time,” Sandler said upon on the adaptation’s announcement. “It reflects the kind of storytelling I love: propulsive, accessible, dark, funny, and unapologetically bold. I’m incredibly excited to bring Crave’s first-ever half-hour drama to life alongside longtime collaborator Mackenzie Donaldson, Front Street Pictures, Blink49, and Bell Media.”\n\n\tProduction is underway on the series, which is co-directed by David Frazee and Rachel Talalay and also stars Carrie-Anne Moss and Noah Reid. The production of “Yaga” comes on the heels of the surprise global success of “Heated Rivalry,” which put Crave Originals on the radar (and in the U.S. became a hit for HBO Max, which had acquired that series domestically in a last-minute deal).\n\n\n\tPurchase the “Yaga” screenplay here.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Scrubs” is back.\n\n\tThe hospital comedy series, which premiered on NBC 25 years ago in 2001, returns to ABC and Hulu with a revival season that sees original stars Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Sarah Chalke and Judy Reyes returning to Sacred Heart Hospital.\n\n\tI caught up with the cast at the revival’s red carpet premiere on Monday night at the Academy Museum in Los Angeles. Braff, who plays John Michael “J.D.” Doria, was working as a waiter when he learned he first booked “Scrubs” years ago.\n\t\n\n\t“I wore a beige tunic and served French Vietnamese food and was often yelled at that we didn’t serve bread, and so I was lucky enough to audition six times and get this show and it changed my life,” Braff said.\n\n\n\tHe admits he never imagined in “1,000 years” that a revival would happen. “I never thought that the demand would continue this many years later and it would still have such a global audience, and it’s crazy that the show just kept going,” Braff said. “In some international countries it’s even bigger than it ever was here.”\n\n\tFaison, who plays Christopher Turk, auditioned three times for what he remembers was “the hottest pilot of that season.” “I remember being in a restaurant when my agent called me and told me I got it,” he said. “I remember the wait in between when I heard I got until when we started filming and it was such a long wait and I didn’t have that much money at the time and I was like, ‘I need this thing to start going.’ But once it started going, this has been such an amazing ride and I can’t believe we’re back here.”\n\t\n\n\tChalke and her best friend were coming home from a concert when her audition script was dropped off at her door. “I remember opening the envelope and being like, ‘Oh no, oh no, this is the best thing I’ve ever read, and my audition’s in nine hours,’” said Chalke, who plays Elliot Reid. “I remember reading that script and thinking like it was so groundbreaking and so different. I love the combination that [series creator] Bill Lawrence does with all of his shows. There’s heart and comedy and pathos and hope, and I just remember it was so unique and different than anything I’ve read and I just wanted to be a part of it.\n\n\t“And then you go through the series of auditions that are like the first one and then the callback with Bill and then the studio and then the network,” Chalke continued. “I remember Bill called me and said, ‘You got the job,’ and I just thought, ‘Oh, my God, I’m so lucky. This is going to be incredible.’ It was life changing.”\n\n\tReyes, who plays head nurse Carla Espinosa, said the first day of filming the revival was a “surreal” experience. “They rebuilt the entire hospital in the stages in Vancouver, so it was kind of hard to get my bearings because it was so strange, but other than that it was it was just like going back because knew each other. The crew had more getting used to each other than we do.”\n\n\n\tWhile a second season of the revival has not been given the go-aheard just yet, I asked the cast about possible dream guests stars.\n\n\t“I want Kate McKinnon to be my patient in an episode,” Chalke said.\n\n\tWhat kind of ailment should the former “Saturday Night Live” player suffer from? “I’m actually not a real doctor so I don’t know,” Chalke said. “But it’s got to be something recurring do that she can stay around for awhile.”\n\n\tFaison would like two of his acting idols to make appearances: “Harrison Ford, because he’s one of the reasons why I’m an actor. It’s him and Denzel [Washington].”\n\n\tReyes has few ideas. “I wouldn’t mind a Boris Kodjoe. I wouldn’t mind an Idris Elba. I wouldn’t mind a Bad Bunny,” she said.\n\n\tI asked Reyes to brainstorm a storyline for the Grammy-winning Super Bowl halftime performer superstar: “This rapper comes to the hospital. Carla’s a huge fan and every time she goes to see him, she can’t treat him because she feels like throwing up.”\n\t\n\n\tBraff pitched the return of former guest star Scott Foley: “He used to play Sarah’s love interest. Scott Foley is one of the funniest straight men ever. A lot of people know this because he’s usually playing the heartthrob somewhere, but I’d love for Scott Foley to come back and be my nemesis again.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMaggie Winters will debut her new comedy special, “Marguerite,” on March 17 on YouTube. \n\n\tThe stand-up hour comes from a partnership between Abso Lutely Productions and comedy talent incubator Upright Citizens Brigade. “Marguerite” was filmed at the UCB Theatre in Los Angeles.\n\n\tThe special is described as a one-woman show “culled from Winters’ life experiences coming of age in Chicago.” Winters first toured the show in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York in 2023 before embarking on a month-long run at the 2024 Edinburgh Fringe Festival.\n\t\n\n\t“Marguerite” is directed by Winters’ proudly Irish brothers Bart and Liam Winters (note that the special debuts on St. Patrick’s Day), who perform as part of Chicago-based band Melkbelly. It’s produced by UCB and Abso Lutely, the banner founded by Tim Heidecker, Eric Wareheim and Dave Kneebone.\n\n\n\t“’Marguerite’ is a killer showcase for Maggie Winters’ voice,” said Kneebone in a statement. “It’s sharp, personal, and funny as hell — and it really shows what’s possible when Abso and UCB team up to give artists real support and room to take big swings.”\n\n\tWinters has opened for comedians including Colin Jost, Conner O’Malley and Meg Stalter, and she recently completed her nationwide Fibs & Friends tour with Connor Wood. In 2023, she was named a Just for Laughs “New Face.”\n\n\tWinters hosts the podcast “Literally Life Changing With Maggie Winters,” and she can be seen as a recurring cast member on Season 3 of Danny McBride’s HBO comedy “The Righteous Gemstones.”\n\n\tWatch a clip from “Marguerite” below.\n\n\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsM6UlfnaDU&feature=youtu.be\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery veteran Karen Horne has been named executive director of showrunner Mara Brock Akil‘s Writers’ Colony talent development program designed to nurture underrepresented writers.\n\n\tHorne will be responsible for expanding the residency program that Brock Akil has spearheaded for the past few years. The Writers’ Colony offers three-month intensives for writers from underrepresented backgrounds with the goal of helping them strengthen their craft. The curriculum includes networking and mentoring opportunities and direct help with writing and storytelling development.\n\t\n\n\tBrock Akil is the creator and showrunner behind “Girlfriends,” “The Game,” “Being Mary Jane,” “Love Is,” “Forever” and other series. She has supported Writers’ Colony program for a handful of cohorts since 2023. Horne will be tasked with raising industry awareness of the program as well as boosting participation.\n\n\n\t“I am ultimately touched to have Karen join the Colony Family. Her leadership, integrity, and the way she champions creatives at every stage of their journey makes her such a beautiful fit for what we’re building. I am confident her years of industry experience, especially her gift for discovering and supporting young talent, will both amplify and expand the Colony experience,” Brock Akil said.\n\n\tHorne left Warner Bros. in 2023 after three years as senior VP of North America diversity, equity and inclusion for the studio. She previously worked in talent development and inclusion for NBCUniversal and for Nickelodeon.\n\n\t“Joining the Writers’ Colony family is a true honor. I admire the passion for community behind this Colony, and I am excited to step into the Executive Director role which I believe is both meaningful and thoughtfully aligns with my purpose. I can’t wait for this next chapter,” Horne said. \n\t\n\n\tHorne’s appointment comes amid a busy week for Brock Akil, who is preparing to shoot Season 2 of Netflix’s coming-of-age drama “Forever.” The busy showrunner announced a deal with Crown to publish her first novel, “The Revelation Dionne Daphne,” and on Sunday she will receive the Norman Lear Achievement Award as part of the Producers Guild Awards ceremony.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA “Bride Wars” TV show starring Emma Roberts is in development at Peacock. \n\n\tThe project is described as a “loose reimagining” of the original 2009 film starring Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway. Roberts is set to star as a big-city wedding planner who arrives in North Carolina, sparking an epic showdown with a beloved local planner. “As the two women battle to plan the same wedding, their rivalry quickly escalates into a larger clash over friendship, community, and, ultimately, love,” according to the logline.\n\t\n\n\t“Bride Wars” does not yet have an official series order. New Regency will serve as the lead studio on the series adaptation, with 20th Television and UCP as co-studios and Roberts’ Belletrist and Alexandra Milchan’s Crescent Line serving as executive producers. Emmy winner Sascha Rothchild (“GLOW,” “XO Kitty,” “The Baby-Sitters Club”) serves as writer, and she executive produces alongside Arnon Milchan, Yariv Milchan and Natalie Lehmann for New Regency; Roberts, Karah Preiss and Matt Matruski for Belletrist; and Alexandra Milchan and Martin Salgo for Crescent Line.\n\n\n\tThe original “Bride Wars” followed two childhood best friends (played by Hudson and Hathaway) who turn into rivals when they are forced to share the same wedding venue and date. Directed by Gary Winick, the movie was released by 20th Century Fox and reached $115 million at the global box office. The film was remade in China in 2015.\n\n\tRoberts is currently in production on the film “Hal” opposite Alexander Ludwig, and she serves as an executive producer on “Tell Me Lies.” She is represented by Sweeney Entertainment, and her lawyer is JR McGuiness. Crescent Line and Alexandra Milchan are represented by attorney Gavin Wise. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Zootopia 2” has cemented yet another box office benchmark, surpassing “A Minecraft Movie” to stand as the highest-grossing domestic release of 2025.\n\n\tDisney‘s animated sequel, which has been a theatrical juggernaut since Thanksgiving, had notched just about every other one of the year’s box office records, including Hollywood’s biggest earner internationally ($1.425 billion) and worldwide ($1.85 billion). However, “A Minecraft Movie” loomed larger in North America with $424.08 million. Now, after 13 weekends in the top 10 on domestic charts, “Zootopia 2” has officially pulled a hair ahead with $424.2 million in North America. \n\t\n\n\tLast year marked Disney’s biggest year on record since pre-pandemic times, with “Zootopia 2,” as well as two other billion-dollar behemoths, “Lilo & Stitch” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” helping to propel ticket sales past $6 billion globally.\n\n\n\tReleased nine years after original, “Zootopia 2” hit theaters ahead of Thanksgiving with $158 million in North America and $559 million worldwide over the five-day holiday weekend. Those revenues ranked as the second largest Thanksgiving launch, the best start ever for an animated film, as well as the fourth-biggest worldwide debut in box office history (following “Avengers: Endgame,” “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home”). \n\n\tBuoyed by great reviews and stellar word-of-mouth, the family film soon became the fastest PG release ever to reach $1 billion worldwide, crossing the milestone in 17 days. It has since surpassed “Inside Out 2” to become Hollywood’s highest-grossing animated film of all time, and it overtook “Avengers: Endgame” as the biggest Motion Picture Association (MPA) title ever in China. On all-time charts, “Zootopia 2” is currently the eighth-biggest film in box office history.\n\t\n\n\tJared Bush and Byron Howard directed “Zootopia 2,” which takes place in a metropolis inhabited by animals and follows a rabbit police officer (Ginnifer Goodwin) and con artist fox (Jason Bateman) as they reunite to pursue a mysterious new reptilian resident (Ke Huy Quan). Given the never-ending box office accolades, it’s only a matter of time before Disney announces the inevitable “Zootopia 3.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tUkrainian filmmaker Sergei Loznitsa will be the Special Guest at the 57th edition of documentary film festival Visions du Réel, which runs April 17-26 in Nyon, Switzerland.\n\n\tLoznitsa will conduct a masterclass on April 18, and present a selected retrospective of his documentary work.\n\n\tEmilie Bujès, artistic director of Visions du Réel, said Loznitsa was “a master of contemporary montage cinema.”\n\n\n\tShe added, “His work notably includes the meticulous re-examination of archives highlighting state violence and the stutter of history, as the images’ subtext is revealed with force and perseverance.\n\t\n\n\t“In both his documentary and fiction works, Sergei Loznitsa retraces decisive moments in 20th-century history and questions the structures of power and memory through cinema of great rigor and precision.”\n\n\tAmong the films screening are three that look at the political situation in Ukraine over recent decades.\n\n\tIn “Maidan” (2014), which was made in just four months and then presented in a special screening at Cannes, Loznitsa chronicles the demonstrations that triggered the Ukrainian Revolution.\n\n\tAlso playing is “Donbass” (2018), whose script was based on amateur videos found on YouTube. The filmmaker depicts the takeover of the Donbass region by Russian-speaking militias who entered into conflict with the Ukrainian army.\n\n\tIn “The Invasion” (2024), Loznitsa continues his Ukrainian chronicles with a film about his country’s struggle against the Russian invasion. Filmed over a period of two years, the film depicts the lives of civilians across the Ukrainian territory and captures the population’s resilience in the face of the Russian war of aggression.\n\t\n\n\tAlso screening is “Austerlitz” (2016), which examines the trivialization of Holocaust memory and uses lingering black-and-white static shots to capture tourists visiting a former concentration camp turned memorial.\n\n\tOther films question “the processes that shape the creation of post-communist collective memory,” the festival said. “Blockade” (2005) was assembled solely from footage shot during the Siege of Leningrad, which ran from Sept. 8, 1941 to Jan. 27, 1944, and leaves the war off-screen, focusing on the day-to-day survival of the population. “The Event” (2015) revisits the August 1991 coup in Moscow. “Babi Yar. Context” (2021) unfolds without narration, recounting the largest massacre of Jews in World War II, which took place near Kyiv. The film was awarded L’Œil d’or’s Special Jury Prize at Cannes.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTogether Films has acquired world rights excluding Canada to Kenya-Jade Pinto’s feature doc debut “The Sandbox” ahead of its world premiere on March 17 in CPH:DOX’s flagship international competition section DOX:AWARD.\n\n\t“The Sandbox” explores modern border control, where surveillance, AI and militarization decide who lives and who dies, using testimony from survivors, journalists and witnesses. \n\n\n\tFrom the Arizona desert to the drone-policed Mediterranean, migrants flee unforgiving landscapes while rescuers face the task of keeping them safe.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, tools tested at borders spill into databases and daily life, collapsing distance between watcher and watched. No villain stands at the center of the film, only processes and protocols. \n\n\tPinto comments: “There was a moment, standing at the border wall that bisects the town of Sasabe – between the USA and Mexico – that I realized I’m not really trying to tell a “tech” story. I understand this will likely be the entry point for many: a futuristic, algorithmic hook that implicates drones, robo-dogs, and AI. But on that day the wind was snaking its way through giant steel rods that jut out of the ground like a rusted-out grin and it all felt eerily familiar. A tidal metronome. If I closed my eyes I could just as easily have been standing on the shoreline of a Greek Island. Just as the ocean steals many of the lives who dare cross it, so too does the harsh landscape of the Sonoran desert. We are not so far away from one another, each of us.”\n\n\tPinto is an Indo-Kenyan-Canadian documentary photographer, whose work has been published in The Globe and Mail and Business Insider, and on Al Jazeera. She has participated in DOC Institute’s Breakthrough Program as well as HotDocs’ Emerging Filmmaker Program and Incubator. In 2021, she was invited to be a National Geographic Explorer.\n\t\n\n\tJess Reilly, head of sales and acquisitions at Together Films, said: “We are thrilled to be representing ‘The Sandbox’ From the moment we saw the film, we recognized both its urgent cinematic power and its international sales and impact potential. It speaks to one of the defining issues of our time – the rapid expansion of surveillance, AI and militarized border infrastructures – in a way that is both deeply human and globally resonant.”\n\n\t“The Sandbox” is produced by Shasha Nakhai and Pinto for Canadian outlet Compy Films with Rich Williamson, Bob Moore and Jennifer Baichwal exec producing. The film has been commissioned by TVO and Knowledge Network with Alexandra Roberts as commissioning editor and Shane Smith as production executive. EyeSteelFilm will also distribute the film domestically in Canada.\n\n\t“The Sandbox” has been produced with the participation of EyeSteelFilm, Canada Media Fund, Telefilm Canada, Ontario Creates, TVO, Ford Foundation JustFilms, Knowledge Network, Hot Docs Funds, Rogers Telefund, and Canadian federal and provincial tax credits.\n\n\tThe film has been developed with the support of Canadian Creative Accelerator, DOC Institute, Hot Docs Accelerator, Hot Docs Forum & Deal Maker, Hot Docs Netflix Incubator, Women Make Movies, and the Voices of Canada Roundtables at DOC NYC.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt was around five in the morning on Disneyland’s 70th birthday in the summer of 2025, and tens of thousands of staffers and guests had arrived early to watch Josh D’Amaro and Bob Iger ring in the anniversary in the park’s esplanade.  \n\n\tD’Amaro, then the chairman of Disney Experiences — and soon to be named the company’s CEO — was set to deliver welcoming remarks onstage in front of the iconic garden boasting 5,900 flowers planted in the shape of Mickey Mouse’s face. A marching band was on hand to welcome the executives; Minnie and Goofy were waiting in the wings; Snow White, Chip ’n’ Dale and other beloved characters were packed into a train car ready to be rolled along the tracks of the Disneyland Railroad; and a parade was scheduled to glide down Main Street. Cameras were set up to record the celebration for a gauzy special on ABC.  \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZohar Lazar for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere was only one problem: D’Amaro was nowhere to be found.  \n\n\n\tHandlers scrambled to find the chairman of the parks as fans pushed against the gates. The executives were set to ring the New York Stock Exchange bell and take a photo with 36,000 cast members, and the clock was ticking.  \n\n\tFinally, the handlers located D’Amaro. He had slipped under the ropes and gone to the back of the crowd, and was walking among clusters of employees shaking hands and chatting. “That’s a custom of his — to always go to the people furthest from the stage and do his Josh thing,” says Marcus Buckingham, a leadership expert who shadowed D’Amaro for his upcoming book, “Design Love In: How to Unleash the Most Powerful Force in Business.”  \n\t\n\n\tThere’s a phrase that’s used around the Magic Kingdom to describe this phenomenon: “the Josh Effect.” D’Amaro — tall, slender and silver-haired — has a politician’s ability to make anyone he encounters feel seen and heard.   \n\n\t“He’s so relatable,” says Joe Gavigan, a 25-year veteran of the parks division. “He looks people in the eye. He’s extremely confident but not cocky.”  \n\n\tD’Amaro is also fiercely competitive. When Gavigan and D’Amaro worked for Disney in Hong Kong, they played tennis almost weekly. Despite his aura of affability, D’Amaro fought to win every match.  \n\n\tThe 55-year-old executive will need to show that same drive as he takes on the biggest challenge of his career; Iger, who became CEO in 2005, will hand him the keys to the Mouse House on March 18. Though The Walt Disney Co. remains the most storied brand in Hollywood, the entertainment landscape it once dominated is shifting dramatically, forcing D’Amaro and the company he will lead to adapt with it. \n\n\tDisney’s rivals not only include traditional media conglomerates like Comcast that make their money by producing and distributing films and TV shows, but streaming giants such as Netflix that have transformed the way that people watch them. That’s to say nothing of tech players like Apple and Amazon, which have muscled their way into the business by launching their own streaming services. And then there’s YouTube and TikTok, which are siphoning off younger viewers at a dizzying rate with user-generated content.   \n\n\t“Disney and Josh have to get Hollywood back in the center of gravity of our culture,” says Kevin Mayer, former head of Disney’s global streaming business and co-CEO of Candle Media.   \n\n\n\n\n\tBut viral videos may not have the same tsunamic impact as artificial intelligence, which Disney is still trying to navigate, engaging in legal battles over copyright with some startups in the space while investing $1 billion in OpenAI. Animation is synonymous with Disney’s brand, and AI is reducing the cost of producing those movies. However, it is also flattening the playing field, allowing users to create animated work without the backing of a major studio. It will take a deft hand to navigate AI, an inevitable force and yet a major point of sensitivity in the creative community. Iger has described D’Amaro as someone who views technology as an opportunity rather than a threat.  \n\n\t“You’re seeing it supercharge these creatives in amazing ways,” D’Amaro, who declined to be interviewed for this story, told Disney-owned ABC News. “If you were to walk over to their studios today and see them using AI, harnessing 70 years of history, this is when The Walt Disney Co. thrives — when technology intersects with brilliant people and creativity.”  \n\n\tDisney has long maintained that its library of animated characters, from Cinderella to Stitch — as well as the brands that Iger snapped up during his tenure as CEO, such as Marvel and “Star Wars” — enabled the company to overpower the competition. That may be true. However, they can’t alter the fact that the shift to streaming is leading to the collapse of the cable business, depriving Disney of a major source of its profits.    \n\t\n\n\tCable is uniquely valuable and thus nearly impossible to replace. Disney not only brings in subscription and ad revenue from its cable channels, but also pockets retransmission fees from operators paying to broadcast its programming. Viewers may be signing up for Disney+ and the company’s other streaming services in greater numbers, but that business barely breaks even, and the money that Disney is generating pales in comparison with what it once made from cable.   \n\n\t“The problem Josh faces is the one we’re all struggling to solve: How do you manage the decline of cable and replace those earnings with streaming?” says one rival entertainment company chief. “You have to oversee that transition while simultaneously finding ways to grow your business.”   \n\n\tD’Amaro, who joined Disney in 1998 as a sales and marketing exec, was tapped to lead the company because his part of the Magic Kingdom is growing. Last quarter, Disney Experiences, which includes the parks, cruise ships, hotels and consumer products, topped $10 billion in revenue for the first time in its history. Even more impressive, under D’Amaro, that division was responsible for 71% of Disney’s operating income. In contrast, D’Amaro’s rivals for the CEO job — Dana Walden and Alan Bergman — came from the entertainment division, which saw profits decline by 35%, and the operating income of ESPN, led by Jimmy Pitaro, another challenger, dropped by 23%.  \n\n\t“For a lot of folks on Wall Street, there’s a degree of comfort in Josh taking over the role,” says Kutgun Maral, media analyst at Evercore ISI.   \n\n\n\n\n\tDuring the first of his two terms as CEO, Iger opted to deploy Disney’s treasury to buy Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, believing that the company with the greatest stockpile of intellectual property wins. How will D’Amaro make his mark now that he’s calling the shots? It may not be the kind of transformative $71.3 billion deal that Iger signed to buy 20th Century Fox, given that Disney is carrying more than $45 billion in debt.   \n\t\n\n\tD’Amaro is a self-proclaimed risk-taker, and his moves as parks chief offer some clues. Disney is breaking ground on a theme park in Abu Dhabi, its first attraction in the Middle East. At the same time, D’Amaro successfully pushed for the company to buy a stake in Epic Games, believing that partnering with the “Fortnite” creator would introduce a new sandbox for Disney’s iconic IP. During a Q&A with Disney fan bloggers, D’Amaro teased how he hoped to lean into the gaming universe. “It could be a new film premiering [on ‘Fortnite’]. It could be the place that you decide to book your next cruise vacation,” he said of Disney’s plans for the platform. “You could participate in the Super Bowl in some way there.”  \n\n\tEven as Disney moves more aggressively into gaming, it needs to get the Magic Kingdom in order. Analysts and rival companies believe that some of Disney’s most durable franchises suddenly look shaky. In partnership with Walden, who was promoted to the newly created role of president and chief content officer, D’Amaro will have to focus on reviving everything from the superheroes to the sci-fi series. Overall, the company needs to develop new franchises to maintain the flywheel effect that feeds into streaming and the theme parks. “Marvel is definitely in a rut,” Doug Creutz, an analyst with TD Cowen, says. “They haven’t had a ‘Star Wars’ movie in more than six years,” he says, while noting that “The Mandalorian & Grogu” is slated for a May release.  \n\n\tInternally, there are concerns that an unconventional 36-second Super Bowl spot for “The Mandalorian & Grogu” that featured the title characters riding a wagon pulled by Tauntauns failed to generate the kind of excitement the marketing team was hoping to spark. The film itself is something of a question mark, given that it’s based on a streaming series and, consequently, may not seem like a big-screen proposition for any but the most die-hard Baby Yoda lovers. There’s a sense that “Star Wars: Starfighter,” a spinoff from “Deadpool & Wolverine” director Shawn Levy, is more likely to satisfy fans when it hits theaters next spring, with sources who have seen footage praising Ryan Gosling’s performance and suggesting Levy has recaptured the franchise’s spirit of fun.  \n\n\t“Star Wars” isn’t the only franchise facing questions. Walden and D’Amaro will also have to determine if Disney should continue to fund James Cameron’s cinematic journeys to Pandora. The most recent “Avatar” film, last year’s “Fire and Ash,” brought in more than $1.4 billion globally. That’s nearly $1 billion less than the previous installment earned. Given the cost of these films, every “Avatar” installment needs to be massive to break even. “If you make $1 billion on the next movie, you still lose hundreds of millions,” notes one insider.    \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRafa Alvarez\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThen there’s Marvel, a crown jewel of the Disney empire. When Disney+ launched, the division was tasked with producing streaming shows that tied in with the “Avengers” movies. Some, such as “WandaVision,” were watercooler hits; others, like “She-Hulk,” struggled. The result was oversaturation, leading to audience fatigue. Recent Marvel films “Thunderbolts*” and “Captain America: Brave New World” fell far short at the box office. Some pundits argue the future of the superhero franchise may ride on the hotly anticipated “Avengers: Doomsday,” although sources inside the company’s film division believe the health of the MCU does not hinge on an individual title. Executives are pleased with what they’ve seen for the December release, and rival studio heads privately predict “Doomsday” will be the year’s highest-grossing film.   \n\n\tIf D’Amaro is going to revitalize Disney’s franchises, he must maintain a healthy relationship with Walden, considered to be one of the industry’s strongest creative executives. After all, D’Amaro lacks any film or TV experience, something that bedeviled Bob Chapek when he was CEO for less than three years. Unlike Chapek, who alienated Disney’s creative divisions by having the media chiefs report to his handpicked ally, Kareem Daniel, there’s a sense that D’Amaro will approach the task with more delicacy, giving Walden a level of autonomy.  “Josh is not afraid to surround himself with people who know more about something than he does,” says Spencer Neumann, a former Disney executive who now is Netflix’s chief financial officer.  \n\t\n\n\tTom Staggs, co-CEO of Candle Media and a former head of Disney’s parks, says while D’Amaro hasn’t greenlit movies or TV shows, he has an intimate understanding of what audiences want to see. “There’s not much difference between what a guest at the parks wants and what the audience wants,” he says. “It’s all part of the same equation.” \n\n\n\n\n\tChapek failed to make inroads with the agents and filmmakers who are vital to the production of Disney’s movies and shows. His legal battle with Scarlett Johansson over the company’s decision to send “Black Widow” to streaming during the pandemic did nothing to endear him to the artistic community. Disney’s board, looking to avoid another blunder, opted to promote Walden so she could serve as a cultural ambassador for D’Amaro. That has reassured many of the showrunners who forged deep bonds with Walden during her stint as the company’s TV and streaming chief, where she established herself as a talent whisperer.   \n\n\t“When you’re working on a project and it isn’t gelling, panic sets in and you throw shit against the wall,” Dan Fogelman, creator of the Hulu series “Paradise,” says. “Dana steps back, takes a breath and calls you into her office. She has this unique ability to zoom out and look at the big picture. And it can be as simple as ‘This drama is not dramatic enough’ or ‘This comedy isn’t funny.’”  \n\t\n\n\tWalden, who was a top TV executive at Fox, which maintained a Darwinian style of corporate governance, has adapted to the Disney way, which embraces a more collegial ethos. Most of the top Fox executives who tried to make the transition flamed out, but Walden thrived. \n\n\t“The two cultures could not be more different,” says Bryan Lourd, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. “But Dana bothered to get to know the people at Disney and find out what their challenges were. She didn’t bring any assumptions. She brought her curiosity.”   \n\n\tShe also ensured a smooth transition for the hundreds of shows moving under the Disney umbrella. \n\n\t“Will Peter Griffin suddenly have to wear a pair of mouse ears? That was the concern, and it just never materialized,” says “Family Guy” creator Seth MacFarlane, who praises Walden’s “self-assuredness” and ability to “socialize as a friend” with creative people. “She’s like the ship’s captain who is able to be a leader and, at the same time, the big sister to the crew.” \n\n\tSuccession fights often end with bruised egos, but Walden has told confidants she’s excited about her new role, which includes overseeing film. But that means Bergman, who used to have a direct line to the CEO as movie chief, will report to Walden. It’s unclear if he embraces the new relationship; however, Bergman has not indicated he plans to leave.   \n\n\tAs for D’Amaro, he’s already made overtures to Hollywood, stopping by a recent luncheon for Academy Award nominees, where he mingled with the likes of Steven Spielberg and Timothée Chalamet. “When you watched Chapek at these things, it was painful,” one observer notes. “Josh seemed completely at ease.”   \n\t\n\n\n\tD’Amaro has managed to steer clear of the controversies and culture wars that perennially plague the Mouse House. He avoided Chapek’s disastrous “Don’t Say Gay” battle against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and he didn’t have to play bad cop during the strikes or muddy himself in the ugly free speech drama between Jimmy Kimmel and the FCC, unlike Walden and Iger. But as CEO, D’Amaro will have to get his hands dirty.  \n\n\tOn Sept. 29, 2020, a few months after D’Amaro was named chairman of Experiences, he showed how he might handle a crisis. When mass layoffs struck Disney’s theme park business, D’Amaro was tasked with telling thousands of cast members they were being evicted from the happiest place on Earth. \n\n\tHe didn’t just send a memo; instead, he visited Downtown Disney to comfort crying employees. He listened to them as they vented and shared their fears. But he also made it clear that the COVID crisis had decimated tourism, leaving Disney with little choice but to make painful cuts.   \n\n\t“Josh was both being a good corporate soldier by handling the furloughs due to the reality of the COVID shutdown and also giving the frontline cast members the time to grieve over a very difficult situation,” says Gavin Doyle, founder of the news site Mickey Visit.  \n\n\tThe central objection about Disney’s parks over the past few years has been affordability. As their leader, D’Amaro has overseen price hikes that have seen one-day passes at Disneyland and Disney World top $200 and annual passes reach upwards of $1,628. That’s stirred up complaints that what was once a family destination has become a getaway for the rich.  \n\n\n\n\n\t“There is a hope among Disney fans that Josh D’Amaro will lower prices,” says AJ Wolfe, author of “Disney Adults: Exploring (and Falling in Love With) a Magical Subculture.” “I don’t think he’s going to do that. Why would he?”  \n\n\tDespite the blowback on pricing, Disney enthusiasts revere D’Amaro. He’s a celebrity among employees and parkgoers, who see him as the executive most loyal to Walt Disney’s original vision. When Buckingham followed D’Amaro across Disneyland, he says, “it took us half an hour to get 30 yards. He is constantly accosted by guests who want to hug him and take pictures with him. I’ve walked the park with dozens of Disney execs over the years, and this mobbing has never happened before.”  \n\n\tOne morning last year, before the gates opened, D’Amaro spent time in the sprawling “Star Wars” land with a Make-a-Wish recipient. “For half an hour, he’s just on his haunches with this 12-year-old girl chatting about the stupid robots that have walked up,” Buckingham says. “And no one’s watching; there are no cameras.”  \n\t\n\n\tWhile D’Amaro made tough decisions during COVID, he was also an empathetic leader as the pandemic upended the business. With all meetings relegated to Zoom, D’Amaro would cover his name tag with masking tape and scribble his emotional state with a blue pen. One day it was “Pain.” Another, “Fear.”  He’s also known to get in the weeds. At Disneyland, he has a reputation for being obsessed with everything from the color of the trash cans to the taste of the popcorn. He recently spent nearly three hours in a meeting with 30 operators and Imagineers to brainstorm a potential redesign of the Millennium Falcon ride. “He even designs his own PowerPoint presentations, which is kind of weird,” Buckingham says.   \n\n\tD’Amaro’s hands-on approach doesn’t just apply to the attractions. In 2022, shortly after Mattel announced a deal to make Disney Princess and “Frozen” dolls and other products, D’Amaro drove himself to the toy maker’s headquarters in El Segundo.   \n\n\t“Josh wanted to meet the people who actually do the work, the product designers and developers,” says Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz, a former Disney digital exec. “That was very telling about his approach: It was about the people and the work.”   \n\n\tWhen he ran the Experiences division, D’Amaro had thousands of employees under him. Yet he maintained personal relationships with the security guards, cooks and princesses scattered across the park. He once went viral for picking up trash on Main Street. And on one Halloween, he served as a costume contest judge and chased down the losers to convey how much he admired their outfits.   D’Amaro lives in Orange County with his wife, Susan, and two children. He’s two hours from the klieg lights of Hollywood, but he’s relocating to L.A. to be closer to Disney’s Burbank headquarters. Having won the succession battle, D’Amaro is poised to become one of the most recognizable figures in corporate America. His every public utterance will be dissected for clues about the direction he wants to take the Magic Kingdom. Friends and former colleagues think he will have no trouble adjusting to the higher profile, along with the new zip code.   \n\n\t“Josh lives, eats and breathes the brand,” says Mayer. “I don’t think he’ll shrink from the spotlight. He’s a perfect ambassador for Disney, because he embodies its ethos.”   \n\n\tD’Amaro is fond of telling his children, “Just say yes.” It’s a mantra he’s relied on when facing choices and challenges in his career. “There’s so much serendipity in life — you’ve got to open yourself up and explore,” D’Amaro told students at Georgetown University, his alma mater, last April. “Everything is never lined up perfectly. Sometimes you just have to hold your breath and go for it.”  \n\n\tThis month, another one of those life-altering opportunities came D’Amaro’s way. On Feb. 2, the day the board voted unanimously in his favor, D’Amaro was invited into a room with Iger and board chairman James Gorman, where he was asked to be the next CEO of The Walt Disney Co.  \n\n\t“It’s surreal,” D’Amaro confessed at a global town hall a couple days later. “A lot goes through your head in that moment. I got a little embarrassed. I got a little choked up. Because it’s a big responsibility.”  \n\n\tD’Amaro took his own advice. He held his breath and went for it. Todd Spangler and Matt Donnelly contributed to this story.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tDear Academy member,\n\n\tFinal voting will soon open, and with it comes the annual Oscar rite of passage: Doing your civic duty for cinema, making tough artistic choices and trying desperately to remember who won last year.\n\n\tNow, the Academy introduced real updates meant to make voting cleaner, fairer and less confusing. The headline change is simple: Members are now formally required to demonstrate they’ve watched a film before voting for it in that category. That’s always been the expectation. What’s new is the technology enforcing it, plus a few ballot tweaks that will change how voting feels in practice.\n\t\n\n\tOnly 50 films are recognized across all categories, matching last year and marking the lowest total since 2008. It was a profoundly top-heavy year. Whether that reflects shrinking viewing habits, an oversaturated landscape or simply an unusually dominant crop of contenders remains to be seen. Watching 50 movies is, and should always be, enjoyable, even if you’re not a fan by the end credits.\n\n\tBelow is the plain-English guide to what’s new, what counts, what doesn’t, how best picture works (because it still confuses some of us who are bad at math) and how to be a top-of-your-game voter without turning the living room into a screening committee.\n\n\tConsider this your cheat sheet, or your Oscar voting “tech support” — with a gentle attempt to ensure you actually contact the official Academy tech support (which, yes, is open seven days a week), because I honestly cannot help you during the week.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tFAQ’s for Final Oscar Voting\t\n\n\tQ: Is watching all the movies a brand-new rule?\n\n\tNot exactly. The Academy has always encouraged and asked members to vote only in categories where they’ve watched the nominees. What’s new for the 98th Oscars is that final voting now requires you to certify through the Academy Screening Room (ASR) that you’ve viewed the nominated films in that category before you’re eligible to vote. Same expectation, new “proof you did the homework” button.\n\n\tQ: Where do I have to watch them?\n\n\tPretty much anywhere you’d normally watch during the season: theatrical releases, festivals, FYC screenings, guild screenings, or on ASR. The Academy isn’t grading your venue. It’s grading whether you marked it.\n\n\tQ: What do I have to watch to be eligible to vote in a category, and \n\n\tThe simple version: watch all nominated films in that category — typically all five (and all 10 best picture nominees) to vote in those specific categories. But if you don’t watch one of the movies in your category, you can’t vote. So do your homework!\n\n\tQ: How do I get credit for watching a film?\n\n\tNo ticket stubs required, no receipts needed and you don’t have to be an AMC Stubs member. It’s still the honor system, just with a checkbox and accountability.\n\n\tUltimately, there are two ways it records your viewing:\n\n\nAutomatic: Watch the film in full on ASR and it can record automatically.\nManual: If you watched it anywhere else, you’ll need to MARK WATCHED on ASR (or the member site  or Academy Members app).\n\n\n\n\tQ: OK, but how do I MARK WATCHED? Where is it?\n\n\tYou can MARK WATCHED in three main places:\n\n\nOn the film’s detail page in ASR, the member site, or the Academy Members app.\nBy selecting the Eligibility button inside a category in ASR/member site/app, it shows what you still need and lets you mark films you’ve already seen elsewhere.\nDuring voting on the voting site: if you’re locked out, select View Eligibility and you’ll be routed to the same Eligibility Notice to fix what’s missing.\n\n\n\n\tQ: I watched it, but the ballot won’t let me vote. Now what?\n\n\tStop spiraling, dude! This is usually a logging issue, not a personal assault against you. Try these:\n\n\nClick View Eligibility (or the category’s Eligibility button).\nUse the Eligibility Notice to see what the system thinks is missing.\nIf you watched it elsewhere, MARK WATCHED.\nReturn to the ballot and try again.\n\n\n\n\tAlso, reminder emails leading up to voting often include direct links to each category’s Eligibility Notice — the Academy is basically preemptively saying, “You don’t have to call tech support if you just look at your e-mails.”\n\n\tQ: Do clips, Bake Off videos or craft explainers count as watching?\n\n\tNice try, but no. Helpful isn’t the same as watched. Bake-offs and explainer content are there to inform your vote, not replace the actual films. You still need to watch the nominated films in full to be eligible — yes, even for best original song, where the clip is extremely tempting as a shortcut.\n\t\n\n\tQ: So what are the Bake-offs for, then?\n\n\tKnowledge is power! They’re your cheat codes for context — especially in casting, makeup and hairstyling, sound and visual effects. You can see the in-person presentations that took place in Los Angeles, New York and London. You can watch virtually and find excerpts with interviews with the artists from the shortlisted films. Great for understanding craft. Not a substitute for watching.\n\n\tQ: What other resources can help me vote smarter?\n\n\tA few genuinely useful ones:\n\n\n“Academy in Brief” explainer videos on voting and final eligibility requirements.\nScene at the Academy (behind-the-scenes content on contenders)\nPeer-to-peer nominee interviews (notably for Production Design)\nThe Academy Reading Room (where all nominated screenplays are available)\n\n\n\n\tThink of these as your study guides for your final exam.\n\n\tQ: Do AMPAS membership screenings count toward my record?\n\n\tNot automatically. If you watched outside ASR — including membership screenings — the safest move is still to MARK WATCHED manually. Certain official voting events tied to required processes may be recorded, but if you don’t want surprises on ballot day, treat manual marking like flossing: annoying, but it prevents pain later.\n\n\tQ: What’s new about the ballot itself?Two noticeable changes:\n\n\nAll designated nominees’ names now appear directly on the ballot (craft teams included — as they should).\nName order follows legal billing/credit submissions, so don’t expect alphabetical order for people. Films, however, are listed alphabetically.\n\n\n\n\tQ: How does best picture voting work?\n\n\tWell, Variety put together a beautiful explainer video that puts it in the simplest terms we can (watch above). Best picture uses preferential voting (ranked choice):\n\n\nRank the best picture nominees in order.\nIf a film gets 50% plus one of first-place votes, it wins.\nIf not, the film with the fewest first-place votes is eliminated.\nThose ballots move to the next highest-ranked choice still in contention.\nRepeat until someone crosses the threshold.\n\n\n\n\tRank all the movies, folks — and definitely more than one or two. Ranking additional titles does not weaken your No. 1. It keeps your ballot active in later rounds if your favorite is eliminated early.\n\n\tQ: How do the other categories work?\n\n\tThe other 23 categories are plurality: Most votes wins. It’s the Academy’s version of, “Whoever has the biggest pile at the end takes it.”\n\n\tQ: Who counts the votes?\n\n\tPricewaterhouseCoopers tabulates the ballots, as it has for decades. The Academy does not count its own votes.\n\n\tQ: What does all this mean for winners?\n\t\n\n\tIf members actually watch broadly, the ballot gets stronger and the outcomes get more informed. If members watch narrowly, the new eligibility rules can reshape who’s even voting in certain categories — which can lead to fewer steamrolls and more chaos.\n\n\tThe best-case scenario: More viewing = better winners.\n\n\tThe most entertaining scenario: The upsets = very fun TV.\n\n\tThe honest answer is that both are possible. The best-case scenario is that more members see more films, strengthening the ballot. The slightly more fun scenario is that it also strengthens the Oscars’ favorite genre: The upset.\n\n\tQ: When does voting close?\n\n\tFinal voting closes at 5 p.m. PT on March 5. Set a reminder if you must — though the Academy is sending out e-mails and texts every day until you vote. \n\n\tQ: So how do I stop all the e-mails and texts?\n\n\tSend in your ballot, silly.\n\n\tQ: Fine. How can I earn the respect of cinephiles and journalists everywhere?\n\n\tIf you want the simplest route to honor and respect, be an excellent voter. How do you become an excellent voter? Follow these five steps.\n\n\nWatch all the movies. It’s the job.\nDon’t skip the shorts. That is where some extraordinary filmmakers are doing extraordinary work.\nRank best picture like you mean it.\nIn everything else, pick your winner. Plurality rules.\nIf you haven’t seen the movie, skip it. Leave it to the people who did their homework.\n\n\n\n\tCinema thanks you. The Academy thanks you. Take it seriously. We’re depending on you. Also, don’t hit “Reply All.”\n\n\tSincerely, \n\n\tCinephiles.\n",

Katherine was beloved by all and will be remembered for the light and joy she brought into the world.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Katherine -- the daughter of Short and Nancy Dolman, Martin's wife of 30 years, who passed away in 2010 of ovarian cancer -- worked as a social worker in Los Angeles after receiving her bachelor's degree from NYU and her master's in social work from USC several years later.\n      \n    \n          While her father is obviously very famous, Katherine mostly stayed out of the public eye ... attending a few events with her father throughout the years. She was the eldest of Short's three children.\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

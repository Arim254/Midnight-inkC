    "body": "\n\tDisney has settled its differences with YouTube over the departure of Justin Connolly, a high-level exec who now oversees YouTube’s media and sports operations.\n\n\tConnolly left Disney in May after 25 years at the company. Disney immediately sued YouTube for poaching him, and sued Connolly for breaching his contract. According to the suit, Connolly was just five months into a new three-year contract as president of platform distribution.\n\t\n\n\tDisney’s lawyers filed a notice of settlement on Tuesday, which did not reveal any details of the resolution.\n\n\n\tConnolly was paid $6 million in 2024, making him one of Disney’s highest paid executives. He oversaw a team of 300 people who were responsible for content distribution deals with cable and satellite providers, streaming services and YouTube TV. He reported to Jimmy Pitaro, Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, who in turn report to Disney CEO Bob Iger.\n\n\tAccording to Disney, Connolly’s defection came at a critical time, as the company was beginning its billion-dollar license renewal negotiations with YouTube — with Connolly as lead negotiator. Disney argued that Connolly was effectively switching sides, and would bring a wealth of inside knowledge about Disney’s strategy in those negotiations.\n\n\t(As of now, those talks appear to be at a standstill. Last week, Disney warned customers that its programming could be dropped from YouTube TV imminently if a deal is not reached.)\n\n\tDisney also feared that as YouTube enters into direct competition with ESPN for sports rights, Connolly would have inside information about ESPN’s ability to pay — putting Disney at a competitive disadvantage.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to Connolly, he was personally warned by Iger and other top executives that Disney would seek to block him from moving to YouTube.\n\n\tYouTube argued in court that Connolly would be walled off from all negotiations with Disney, and would be required to adhere to his confidentiality obligations to Disney. YouTube’s lawyers also suggested that Disney was merely seeking to use its claim over Connolly’s services as a chip in the license renewal talks — seeking to expedite those talks by offering to release Connolly’s obligations once the talks were concluded. \n\n\tYouTube also argued that Connolly’s contract was effectively at-will, and not a fixed-term agreement, as Disney retained the right to terminate him at any time without necessarily paying out the remainder of his deal absent a release.\n\n\tIn June, Judge James Chalfant denied Disney’s motion for a restraining order to block Connolly from working for YouTube. The judge found that Disney had not shown the requisite emergency and had not shown that it was likely to succeed on the merits.\n\n\tConnolly told the court that he was grateful for the opportunities he received at Disney, and “saddened, though not terribly surprised, that Disney filed a lawsuit against me.”\n\n\t“I desire nothing more than to pursue my dream job at YouTube,” he stated. “And I hope that, in time, Disney will move on from their disappointment over my departure and that I will be able to restore my relationships with so many Disney colleagues.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter several years in development, Warner Bros. Animation and New Line Cinema are finally moving ahead with the “Hello Kitty” feature film, dating it for July 21, 2028. \n\n\t“Hello Hollywood 🎀🌴🎬 #HelloKittyMovie is coming to theaters July 21, 2028!,” said an Instagram post from the studio on Wednesday.\n\n\t“The film marks Hello Kitty’s Hollywood theatrical debut as Hello Kitty and her friends embark on a cinematic adventure sure to delight audiences of all ages,” the studio said in a statement.\n\t\n\n\tLeo Matsuda is directing, while Dana Fox (“Wicked”) wrote the most recent draft of the script. Matsuda directed the short “Inner Workings” and worked as a story artist on films including “Zootopia” and “Wreck-It Ralph.”\n\n\tJapan’s Sanrio first introduced the adorable big-headed feline in 1974 and quickly unleashed a merchandising juggernaut, with entire stores devoted to thousands of items branded with Hello Kitty and her friends, such as Dear Daniel and superhero alter ego Ichigoman. There’s a Hello Kitty theme park in Japan, Hello Kitty cafés, dozens of video games and numerous collaborations for high-end clothing and other adult-targeted products.\n\n\tThe English-language feature project was first announced by New Line in 2019, and was the first time Sanrio had licensed film rights to the classic cat. It’s not yet known whether Kitty White (yes, she has a last name) will speak in the film, but lacking a mouth, she has been completely silent to date in several animated series about her adventures. Sanrio also licensed rights to other characters, including the cracked egg character Gudetama, the rabbit character My Melody, and Little Twin Stars, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see them play in the same sandbox as Hello Kitty.\n\t\n\n\tMatsuda is repped by Verve and manager Stacey Lubliner’s SEL media company.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAI is “the next frontier” for YouTube, according to CEO Neal Mohan — and it might result in the video platform’s shrinking its employee headcount.\n\n\tMohan, in a memo Wednesday to YouTube staffers, announced a major reorg of its product team into three groups: Subscriptions Products (headed by Christian Oestlien), Viewer Products (led by Johanna Voolich, formerly YouTube’s chief product officer), and Creator & Community Products (with a lead yet to be hired).\n\t\n\n\tAccording to Mohan, the moves are related to positioning YouTube for an AI-centric future. “Looking to the future, the next frontier for YouTube is AI, which has the potential to transform every part of the platform,” Mohan said in an internal memo, as first reported by Alex Heath’s Sources AI newsletter. “We need to set ourselves up to make the most of this opportunity.”\n\n\n\tAs part of the shift to AI, YouTube is introducing a “voluntary exit program” for employees, per Mohan’s memo.\n\n\tA YouTube rep, asked for more info, confirmed that YouTube is offering a voluntary exit program with severance for U.S.-based employees who may want to leave the company. However, currently, there are no role eliminations or layoffs happening as part of these changes, the spokesperson said.\n\n\tOther big tech companies are already cutting jobs in anticipation of massive changes introduced by AI. On Tuesday, Amazon said it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, representing about 4% of the total corporate workforce, citing rapid developments in AI; more cuts are expected by the ecommerce giant in 2026.\n\t\n\n\tMohan’s AI-driven reorg memo came prior to parent company Alphabet reporting Q3 earnings. YouTube ad revenue for the period was $10.26 billion, a year-over-year increase of 15%, beating Wall Street analyst forecasts.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBarco, the cinema projection company, is expanding its premium HDR by Barco format in Germany.\n\n\tStarting in November, the company will install the Barco HDR format at select Cineplex Germany locations and in Cinedom Cologne. This expansion marks a major footprint in European moviegoing, as Cineplex is a leading German exhibitor, and Cinedom Cologne is one of the country’s largest cinemas.\n\n\n\tThe initiative will bring premium large format cinema to Cineplex Goslar for the first time and build on the current premium offerings at Cineplex Paderborn and Cineplex Münster to take the moviegoer experience to the next level of technological innovation. As part of the international expansion, HDR by Barco is available as “ULTIMATE. in HDR by Barco” at these locations. Cineplex Münster, also celebrating 25 years of operation this month, will be the first theater in the world with two HDR by Barco enabled auditoriums.\n\t\n\n\tCineplex Münster, celebrating 25 years of operation this month, will be the first theater in the world with two HDR by Barco enabled auditoriums. At Cinedom Cologne, the new HDR theater will launch the circuit’s new “CinedomX” experience, a freshly conceived premium cinema concept from the brand. Installations are underway now so moviegoers in Germany will be able to enjoy major holiday tentpoles opening in HDR by Barco this holiday season.\n\n\t“We’re proud to bring HDR by Barco to German audiences through our partnerships with Cineplex and Cinedom—two of the country’s most respected cinema brands,” said Gerwin Damberg , EVP of Barco Cinema. “As someone who grew up in Germany, this milestone is personally meaningful. It’s exciting to see our vision and technology come full circle, enhancing the cinematic experience in the very theaters that once inspired my love of film.”\n\t\n\n\tThe company’s CEO An Steegen, who is on Variety‘s Women’s Impact report for 2025, said: “The accelerated drive for innovation and elevating cinema experience is transforming and reinvigorating the industry. The 2026 slate looks strong, and audiences will have a lot to look forward to. Many of the technology initiatives announced this year will continue, or in some cases rapidly expand, into next year, bringing more options and more access to exceptional cinema.”\n\n\tShe added the company is focused on the expansion of HDR by Barco using Lightsteering technology. “Innovation is at the heart of everything we do. We’re always working on our portfolio roadmap to fuel a pipeline of solutions that are capable of powering the world of entertainment today and tomorrow,” she said. “Whether that means more efficient technologies, a lower environmental impact, advanced image quality or cutting-edge experiences, we’re on a mission to leverage innovation to drive results for the industries we work in, and the people who benefit from them. In cinema, this means taking care of partners in exhibition for the long-term and delivering what they need to keep moviegoers coming back week after week.”\n\n\tPast releases in the format have included “Superman,” “F1” and “28 Years Later.” The upcoming “Wicked: For Good” will also be released in HDR format this year.\n\n\tStateside, Barco is also expanding the reach of its HDR format through partnerships with exhibitors and will have more than 30 HDR locations by the end of the year. Regal Cinemas has committed to establishing 20 RPX screens in the U.S. by the end of this year, and Alamo Drafthouse is also scheduled to add several HDR screens. \n\n\tBased on the company’s patented Lightsteering technology, Barco’s approach to HDR works by strategically redistributing light on screen to produce highlights that are over six times brighter than traditional projection, while retaining rich details in the darks for greater depth, clarity and range. HDR by Barco delivers expansive creative possibilities for filmmakers, producing a wide color gamut with high-contrast images that captivate audiences.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNew Zealand-based sales outfit Black Mandala has acquired “Nightfall: A Paranormal Investigation,” an Australian horror film directed by Myles McEwen and Ripley Stevens, with the production-sales company eyeing franchise potential, it was revealed on the sidelines of TIFFCOM, the Tokyo International Film Festival‘s market arm. \n\n\tSet in 1988, the paranormal thriller follows investigators Mick Sutherland and Archie Charlesworth as they respond to a desperate call from Elizabeth Blair’s isolated home, where they encounter a malevolent presence that unravels their sanity over seven days in what becomes known as Case 13.\n\t\n\n\tThe Adelaide-based filmmaking duo wrote, directed and star in the feature. The film pays homage to classics like “The Exorcist” while offering a fresh take on the paranormal-investigation subgenre.\n\n\n\tMcEwen revealed the project was inspired by unsettling personal experiences. “The film was inspired by a series of haunting events — I watched my co-star Ripley sleepwalk and speak for an entire week in a deceased man’s apartment in Budapest, whilst back in Adelaide, I was told my bedroom light switched on by itself several times,” he said. “It felt as though something spiritual — maybe even demonic — was haunting us.”\n\n\t“Nightfall” has drawn comparisons to James Wan and Leigh Whannell’s work, positioning McEwen and Stevens as part of a new wave of Australian horror filmmakers.\n\n\tBlack Mandala confirmed ongoing collaborations with McEwen and Stevens following the acquisition. The company recently boarded “Hollywood Hells,” a thriller that takes aim at the entertainment industry’s dark side. \n\t\n\n\tMichael Kraetzer and Nicolas Onetti launched Black Mandala in 2017, building it into a leading player in independent horror and genre distribution. Operating from Auckland, New Zealand, the outfit handles north of 100 titles and maintains a presence at major markets, championing visually striking material and cultivating ongoing relationships with genre filmmakers globally.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFilm co-production in Asia is still a complex game with substantial challenges, especially in cash flow financing, according to the creative team behind Tokyo International Film Festival competition title “Morte Cucina.”\n\n\tSpeaking at a seminar at TIFFCOM, the festival’s market arm, the team behind the five country co-production, which included Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, France, and Luxembourg, discussed the difficulties balancing the requirements of film funds from each country.\n\t\n\n\tThe complex structure necessitated the producers parcelling out creative and technical roles based on each country’s contribution.\n\n\n\tSingapore’s IMDA, for example, has shifted its funding model to prioritise work experience for locals, requiring the production to hire 10 Singaporean “media talents,” the IMDA’s term for a selected list of above and below the line crew.\n\n\tFor “Morte Cucina,” this included a lead cast member, first assistant camera operator, wardrobe, and camera grip, who travelled to Thailand for the shoot.\n\n\tLuxembourg took charge of sound mixing, while VFX, foley and colour grading was done in Taiwan.\n\n\tDirector Pen-ek Ratanaruang explained how he worked with producer Soros Sukhum to juggle these shifting demands while prioritising his vision for the film.\n\n\t“I would tell Soros: ‘Only a few [key crew elements] that I must have, but the rest, I don’t care’ so that it frees him to become more creative in his producing,” said Ratanaruang. “As a director, I would require only a few things but, but the few things that I required must not move. It has to stay, and then the rest you can do.”\n\t\n\n\tHe pointed to his collaboration with cinematographer Christopher Doyle as an example of how trusting key crew elements made post-production easier.\n\n\t“I know how he works, I know the way he lights, every scene is so consistent, the color correcting is easy. So I would say, I don’t know Taiwanese color grading, but I’m more than fine for you to go there and do it.”\n\n\tBeyond these operational issues, however, Asian co-productions also face structural hurdles in financing.\n\n\tEven with film fund pledges and, in the case of “Morte Cucina,” a minimum guarantee from French distributor The Jokers, co-productions in Asia suffer from a lack of options in cash flowing their productions.\n\n\t“What we really lack in Asia is sort of like a cash flow facility. Banks do not give loans [to film productions] in this region, compared to Europe or in America,” said seminar moderator, Mylab founder and producer Lorna Tee.\n\n\t“Lots of producers struggle with this when we want to do international co-productions, because a lot of the trenches of payment for the funding is very complicated and does not work according to what the production needs,” Tee said.\n\n\t“Morte Cucina” producer Soros Sukhum agreed, pointing to unorthodox methods they turned to, to cash flow the $1.3 million production.\n\n\t“We do take loans, not from banks, but from wealthy individuals and we’ll give them a credit.” said Sukhum. “And for investors [in the film], if they transfer all the money [ahead of time], we will offer them a premium. When everybody recoups, we will give a premium of 5%.”\n\n\tProducers must also contend with frequent and unpredictable changes in the policies and leadership of national film bodies, which can complicate long-term planning.\n\n\t“In Europe, you have a network which is very much stronger, in fact, between every other country and every co-producer knows very well the rules from each country, whereas in Asia, the rules are also changing a lot every time,” said co-producer Stefano Centini.\n\n\t“And this is another thing that makes it harder for us to always explain with other co-producers, is like, no, actually, what was true yesterday is not true anymore today.”\n\n\tAn added complication within Asia, is how national film organizations are often subject to the shifting politics in their respective countries, with leadership often changing hands depending on the ballot box.\n\t\n\n\tOne aspect that is simpler in Asia compared to Europe is that agencies are more flexible  regarding the percentage of investment required to qualify as an official co-production.\n\n\t“In Asia, regulations are a bit more loose, and they allow us, for example, to participate in co-productions, even with a little share, for example,” said Centini. “For this case, I think Taiwan is below 10% which in Italy wouldn’t qualify as an official co-production, but I’m still able to be part of this, because in Asia, we don’t have this kind of very tight structure.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAndrea Benjamin Manenti’s debut feature “I Have to Fuck Before the World Ends,” a cross-cultural coming-of-age comedy set between Italy and the Philippines, is seeking financing and animation partners at the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market.\n\n\tThe film follows Ren, a 16-year-old Filipino-Italian teenager trapped in his mother Mia’s possessive love, who must break free during a three-day Filipino wake as Typhoon Edith approaches Manila. When news arrives that Mia’s mother Moini is dying in the Philippines, mother and son return to Manila, where Ren finds himself enchanted by Jolina, his cousins’ babysitter, and coached in the art of love by his eccentric cousin Monique. As Typhoon Edith nears and family dysfunction brews, Ren must claim his independence.\n\t\n\n\tThe project blends live action and animation, reinventing archetypes of lost innocence and discovering one’s roots within the rarely seen setting of a Filipino wake in Italian cinema.\n\n\n\t“I’m aiming for a film that’s tender and punk at once: a portrait of the awkward, wondrous attempts to connect with others; a hybrid, cross-cultural cinema that speaks to second- and third-generation audiences caught between two distant worlds,” Manenti tells Variety.\n\n\tThe project is structured as a co-production between four countries – two in Asia and two in Europe – with Italy’s Volos Films and the Philippines’ Epicmedia already attached. \n\n\t“Since the signature of the coproduction treaty between Italy and Japan, we feel there are many more opportunities for collaboration between Italy and Asia, and the TIFFCOM market has been instrumental in fostering these partnerships, so it makes much sense for us to be here at this stage,” producer Stefano Centini of Volos Films Italia tells Variety.\n\t\n\n\tThe project recently won the Development Award for Outstanding Film Project at MIA Rome, where it received its first industry pitch. “The reception has been overwhelmingly warm so far,” says Manenti, who co-wrote the script with Rossella Inglese and Antonio La Camera. Filipino editor Carlo Francisco Manatad, whose work as both editor and director Centini says he admires deeply, is attached to the project.\n\n\tManenti wrote the film following his mother Edith’s death. “I went through a private ‘end of the world’ that demanded to be faced. Perhaps the only way I found to cross it was by writing a story within it: a comedy about my mother’s morbid devotion to me, about dysfunctional families, and about those clumsy yet wondrous attempts to rebuild relationships,” he says.\n\n\tThe project previously participated in Milano Film Network’s InProgress Lab in 2023, where Manenti met Carlo Hintermann – first a mentor, now a creative lead and producer – who subsequently brought in producers Centini and Serena Alfieri from Volos Films. “The strength of this team is its culture of care: the film is growing as a collective creative process while remaining deeply personal,” Manenti says.\n\n\tCentini praises the energy of the new generation of Italian filmmakers. “There is a revived energy in these young creators which reminds me a lot of my previous experience in Asia, especially in the Philippines, for the mutual care and collective will to create something which is inspiring and moving at the same time,” he says. “Working with Epicmedia, our Filipino co-producer who shares our ideals of co-production, was the most natural for the film.”\n\n\tManenti, who also works as a director of photography collaborating with Italy’s new wave filmmakers, speaks to the collaborative spirit of his generation. “There is real sharing; we are first and foremost a group of people who respect and care for one another, far from toxic forms of competition; we are building an ecosystem that, in the long run, will be our strength,” he says.\n\n\tThe team aims to close financing in 2026 and begin production in 2027, with plans for a research trip to the Philippines and casting for the protagonist scheduled for next year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a Tokyo screening room filled with filmmakers and creators from around the world, Oscar-winning art director Tim Yip delivered a clarion call for preserving human emotion in an age of artificial intelligence. \n\n\t“Technology is so strong, you have to get something more than, higher than the technology to make it as a tool, so not as a god,” Yip said during the KlingAI NextGen Creative Contest awards ceremony and panel discussion.\n\n\n\tThe event, held alongside the Tokyo International Film Festival, showcased winning films from a competition that attracted more than 4,600 submissions from 122 countries and regions, competing for a $42,000 prize pool. But rather than celebrating technical prowess alone, the evening’s most powerful moments centered on deeply personal stories of memory, humanity and the creative partnership between humans and machines.\n\t\n\n\tZeng Yushen, representing Kling AI, set the tone for the evening by framing the contest as more than mere competition. “Tonight isn’t just about awards, it’s about celebrating creators and all the stories they bring to life,” he said. “At Kling AI, we always want to empower creators to give them tools to expand their creative freedom, as well as to give them new tools to do very new storytelling.”\n\n\tYip, who won the Academy Award for art direction for “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” praised the grand prize winner “Alzheimer” for its exploration of memory loss. The film, created by Chinese student C·one and inspired by a team member’s relative suffering from the disease, uses an oil painting aesthetic to depict the inner world of someone experiencing cognitive decline.\n\t\n\n\t“When you are young, the energies come from you, so that you always have a new energy to build up new ideas,” Yip reflected. “But at the end, you are leaving your body, your spirit, and living more and more. So I feel this is really important, no matter AI film or some modern film, or the classical film — they always talk about humans and the relationship with the world and the environment too.”\n\n\tSouth Korean director Lee Hwan-kyung, whose 2013 film “Miracle in Cell No. 7” became a box office phenomenon, echoed the emphasis on emotional authenticity. “I think it’s better to think about how we can collaborate together with AI so that we can bring this human emotion to the movies,” Lee said, drawing laughter when he joked: “I’m just personally hoping that the AI technology really slowly develops.”\n\n\tThe winning creators themselves spoke about how AI tools enabled them to realize deeply personal visions that would have been impossible through traditional filmmaking. Leammonn, a South Korean media artist and adjunct professor who won an official selection award for “I’m Not a Robot,” envisioned AI’s potential to create new forms of storytelling. “I imagine the future of the interactive film,” she said. “If we are making some kind of playground, using the things with technology or with some kind of network, it will be very powerful.”\n\n\tPolish filmmaker and motion designer Dawid Meller, whose “Lost & Found” also received an official selection, described AI as liberating. “I was collecting a lot of ideas, and there are many limits when you’re creating films and stories — you are limited by budget and technology and sometimes bad time of your collaborators,” he said. “But with AI, I could finally free myself and do a lot of these kind of things alone.”\n\n\tC·one, the grand prize winner, described the creative process behind “Alzheimer.” “When I use this AI tool, I just take the clean AI as the first step, like my camera,” he said. “It’s a process for me to start to organize this story and to do real thinking about this storytelling.”\n\n\tYip shared his own experimental journey with AI, describing how he created an alien character searching for human ruins in empty space. “I talked to him, and he changed. He will react to me,” Yip said of the AI tool. “Every time I’m not asking him to do what kind of things, but I am just asking him questions, and then they come up with all these reactions. So that I follow the reaction, and I come more deeper and deeper.”\n\t\n\n\tThe evening highlighted both the possibilities and anxieties surrounding AI in filmmaking. Yip warned against the medium becoming too focused on spectacle. “I worry about when we are still only working on the exciting moments, maybe after five years, no people have the really strong reaction of all that,” he said. “The most important thing is to going back to reality, try to repeat, try to create. But I think AI is really for me, it’s very exciting because I try to push it in some human touch, really sensible human touch.\n\n\tYet the panel’s overarching message was one of collaboration rather than competition. Lee suggested AI could help bridge the traditional conflict between screenwriters and directors by enabling rapid visualization of scenarios. “I believe that there’s a chance that we can actually integrate the one point between the script writer and the person who tries to direct it,” he said.\n\n\tMeller provided a concrete example of AI’s democratizing potential, describing how a scene that would have cost half his film’s budget and taken weeks with traditional effects was roughed out in five minutes using Kling AI. “Now, like, not only big Hollywood studios could afford to make really high quality productions,” he said. “Everyone, even smaller teams or single creators can can actually do it.”\n\n\tThe event was hosted by Kling AI, a platform that has surpassed 45 million users globally and reached an annualized revenue run rate exceeding $100 million within 10 months of launch. The NextGen Creative Contest offered a $42,000 prize pool, with China, the U.S., and India leading in submissions.\n\n\tAs the evening concluded, C·one announced plans to create a new AI film about his hometown region grasslands, while exploring how to better integrate AI with traditional storytelling techniques. Leammonn expressed interest in developing interactive films that could help combat social isolation, while Meller revealed he’s working on both a traditional sci-fi comedy and a fully animated AI series.\n\n\tPerhaps the most memorable insight came from Yip when asked what advice he’d give emerging AI creators. “I think you can do anything,” he said simply, before describing the creative process as moving “from outside to inside.”\n\n\tThe panel was moderated by Hanqing, founder of AI Talk. \n\t\n\n\tIn an era of rapid technological change, the Tokyo gathering suggested that the future of filmmaking may depend less on choosing between human and artificial intelligence, and more on their thoughtful synthesis — with human emotion firmly in the driver’s seat.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs social media undertook its own task of informally picking an MVP during the World Series‘ epic Game 3 this week, a surprise candidate emerged… and we’re not even talking about the Los Angeles Dodgers‘ underdog relief pitcher Will Klein (although, sure, him too). We’re talking about Dodgers organist Dieter Ruehle, who stood along Shotei Ohtani, et al., when fans were discussing their favorite things about the grueling but thrilling game. Ruehle is practically legendary in baseball now for the wit inherent in his song cues, as well as for making sure the energy doesn’t flag in the stadium. And that was never more relevant than in a game that lasted nearly seven hours, with almost as much intrigue created by Ruehle’s canny choices as in whether anyone would ever score another run before daylight.\n\t\n\n\tRuehle’s choices aren’t always humorous. For instance, when Clayton Kershaw left the mound after his last regularly scheduled game of the season — and of his career — this year, the organist caught the mood by playing a bit of the Verve’s “Bittersweet Symphony.” But more often than not, he’s offering his own amusing play-by-play, with obvious songs like “Walk Like an Egyptian” or “Walk of Life” during a walk — or far less blatant picks, like a song by the group 311 when the score is 3-1; “Piano Man” when it gets to be 9 o’clock on a Saturday night, “Clocks” for “We Can Work It Out” during a mound visit, or “I Am the Walrus” when Tommy Edman is up (because “eggman”/Edman… close enough).\n\n\n\tWith Game 5 just hours away on Wednesday, Variety talked with Edman about what it was like pulling up appropriate songs for a nearly record-length game like Monday night’s, and his thoughts about the organ’s importance in ballparks and humor’s role in his playing in general. (And since he is the king of Major League Baseball easter eggs, we had to ask if there is any mysterious significance to his repeat playing of Taylor Swift’s “Opalite,” or “Kpop Demon Hunters'” “Golden.”)\n\t\n\n\tIn all the social media threads about you during the World Series, we keep seeing Blue Jays fans being jealous, saying, “We need an organist back in Toronto.” We get spoiled in L.A. and don’t realize that not every team has one, but when the whole world is watching the Series, suddenly everyone is hyperaware.\n\n\tThat’s great to hear that, that people could actually hear and feel the difference. Obviously, I’m biased, but I feel it when I watch games from other places and they just have recordings. To me, it just automatically just feels like it could be so much better. You could add some life, some personality to a venue that doesn’t have live music. But fortunately, a good amount of ballparks still have the organ, and those fans get to experience it. It’s kind of like I’m soundtracking to what happens out there on the field, just reacting. Because the game isn’t scripted, it’s live. So what better way to do it than with a live accompaniment?\n\n\tOf course it’s not totally uncommon for a Dodgers game to go into a couple of extra innings. But in Game 3, it was a whole different-level — overtime overtime — and eventually it’s appropriate to bring out some songs that allude to the epic length. Are these songs you’ve already just got in the back of your mind, even though there wouldn’t be many chances to use them?\n\n\tWell, I have a few in the back of my mind, if games last a long time. For example, if the game goes three hours, I usually play the “Gilligan’s Island” theme because the lyrics talk about “a three-hour tour.” When we hit the six-hour mark Monday night, I was thinking, “Wait a minute, what if I played ‘Gilligan’ again because it’s three hours times two?” I thought that was some kind of deep (reference)… but actually, to my surprise, people noticed it, and I was like, yes, they got it!\n\n\tAnd then some other things just came to mind, like Billy Joel — “The Longest Time,” I played a little bit of that. And then I played the theme to “The Never Ending Story,” because it felt like the game was just like never-ending. That just occurred to me, maybe a few minutes before I played it — I thought, “Oh, this would be great.” So fortunately I already knew how to play those songs and don’t have to learn ’em on the spot.\n\t\n\n\t“Never Ending Story” can’t be one that you pull out very often, though.\n\n\tNot very often, no. But I used to play it because there was a baseball player named Trevor Story who played on the Colorado Rockies for a long time, and whenever they came here, I played a little bit of that. But yeah, I don’t get to play it often.\n\n\tPeople were collectively adding on social media to playlists of the songs you were getting in there in Game 3: “Final Countdown,” “All Night Long,” “Just Can’t Get Enough”… which just sounds great in an organ snippet whether it has anything to do with the game or not.\n\n\tYeah. I love Depeche Mode. “I just can’t get enough of this baseball game,” right? I just try to add little, little, little, little things here and there and hopefully it might bring a smile to the fan’s face if they catch it.\n\n\tPeople who have baseball as their favorite sport often have it because of the parts of the game that cannot be duplicated in any other sport. And that applies here: You’ve got a very tense game, and yet, in a way, you are introducing bits of comedy into it, without taking away from the tension. There is just no comedy allowed in football.\n\n\tBut if I may, though, I think the thing is, when you do it with the organ, it’s not exact — it’s more subtle. It’s not in your face, with the lyrics blasting. And obviously we have the technology to play all the tracks, right? But with the organ, it’s a little more subtle and it lets it remain part of the game, but yet not bigger than the game. Because people are coming here to see the World Series. And so the organ, I think, can add that fun comedy, if you will, here and there, but in a subtle way that doesn’t take anything away. We’re not bigger than the game, anyway. That’s what I think.\n\n\tDo you have any estimation of how many people are getting the references or in-jokes, if they’re not on social media and just sitting there enjoying the game? Obviously most people are not tuned in to that. Is it 10% or 20%?\n\n\tI don’t know how many are. All I know is, I have a social media account — just the one; I got to be too overwhelmed having more than one —  on Twitter, or X. The 14th inning stretch that I posted from the other night has over 140,000 views. I’m like, wow, that’s a lot, you know? But I’m not posting everything. I can’t record and play. So I’m not sure how many people are noticing those things. Sometimes it’s more than I think. I’m pretty pleasantly surprised sometimes.\n\t\n\n\n\tYou did have a 14th inning stretch Monday night? Those of us watching at home were cheated out of that.\n\n\tYeah, every seven innings we play “Take Me Out to the Ballgame,” so when we hit the 14th inning, it was time to stretch again. People just got such a kick out of it, because the normal stretch is a pretty happy part of coming to a baseball game, and now we get to do it again a couple hours later, and it’s such a rare thing.\n\n\tAny Taylor Swift fan who’s been to a game you played recently immediately recognized “Opalite,” from her new album. And you’ve been doing “Golden” and “Soda Pop” from “Kpop Demon Hunters.” Are those in there as references of some sort, or just because they’re fun songs that people are currently loving?\n\n\tNo, just because they’re fun. Although sometimes with “Golden,” I might do it after a pop-up, because we’re going “up, up, up,” and the ball’s up, up, up. I might do it then, but that’s kind of a stretch. But usually with the current things, I’ll just play them because they’re currently popular. There’s not really always a tie-in or a connection. Sometimes there is, sometimes there isn’t.\n\n\tWith “Opalite,” I started looking it up, like: Are there blue-shaded opalites, and that relates to Dodger blue? And of course there are. But I was overthinking it.\n\n\tNo, that’s totally cool. I mean, I’ll get that on social. People will say, “Oh, you played it for this reason,” and I really didn’t, but that kind of does work, you know?\n\n\tI am immediately attuned to recognize the “Twin Peak” theme, but that one wasn’t easy to figure out the meaning on first thought. Then there’s one I would never recognize, but many people do — a song from “The Goofy Movie” called “I2I.”\n\n\tThe song’s called “I2I” — pronounced “eye to eye” — but it looks like “1-2-1.” And on the scoreboard will say “one ball, two strikes, one out” when that happens, so that’s when I play “I2I.” It was really surprising how many people caught onto that. At the same time, a lot of people were curious like, what’s the connection here? When I explained it, they’re like, “Oh yeah, of course.”\n\n\tPeople loved hearing the Ewok celebration song in Game 3, which you’ve played before.\n\t\n\n\tYeah, yeah, yeah. Usually I’ll play that near the end of a game because that song took place at the end of “Return of the Jedi,” and I thought, okay, usually in the eighth or ninth inning, when we’re about to win, it’s kind of a happy, celebratory song, so I thought, “Oh, maybe I’ll play it there.” I also play “Con te partirò,” which is “Time to Say Goodbye,” by Andrea Bocelli. So that’s another one I’ll do in the ninth inning. As long as we’re winning.\n\n\tIn Game 3 people kept wondering, are the players getting tired? What about you — were you getting tired? Was is it taxing you?\n\n\tYeah, we were all getting tired. Even the organist got tired. But adrenaline got me through it and my love of this job got me through it. You know, it takes energy, and I’m always thinking ahead… So yeah, I was tired. But it was a fun tired, for sure.\n\n\n\tWe’ll hear more from you in the final home game of the series Wednesday night. But the Dodgers is not your only gig. We can look forward to hearing you with the Kings in the-off season, right?\n\n\tYeah. Actually I have a Kings game tomorrow. Hockey season starts in October, so we’re on our third or fourth game now, and so yeah, a Kings game tomorrow and another Kings game Saturday. They’re both fun. They’re very different, obviously, you know, summer, winter, outdoors, indoors; one can be hot weather, the other one’s in the arena, where it can be pretty chilly. They’re different but each fun in their own way, that’s for sure.\n\n\t(To read Variety’s interview with country star Brad Paisley about coincidentally singing the National Anthem at the two longest World Series games in history, click here.)\n\nI talked to Brad Paisley about his streak of prefacing Series games that go overtime… Brad Paisley on Singing the Anthem Before the Only Two 18-Inning Games in World Series History: ‘I Had No Idea There Would Be Major Cosmic Ramifications’ https://t.co/SGJPc3G2iR via @variety— Chris Willman (@ChrisWillman) October 29, 2025\n\n",

The jury began deliberations Tuesday morning and returned the verdict Wednesday afternoon.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Remember ... Grayson was arrested in July 2024 after he killed Massey, who had called 911 in the first place about a possible prowler. Horrific body cam footage came out in the aftermath of the shooting ... which showed the conversation take a deadly turn after Massey turned off a burner on her stove and brought a pot of boiling water over to the sink.\n      \n\n        \n                    \n                      7/6/24\n                  \n      \n    \n          With another deputy looking on, Grayson loses his cool and tells her repeatedly to drop the pot ... before stepping around the counter and shooting her. The Sangamon County Sheriff's Office later fired Grayson -- who claimed he feared Massey meant to throw the boiling water at him.\n      \n    \n          Famed civil rights attorney Ben Crump -- who represented Sonya's family -- told us he and Sonya's father, James Wilburn, weren't buying Grayson's excuse after the body cam footage was released. The family has since secured a $10 million civil settlement connected to her death.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

According to ABC7 Los Angeles, further investigation also uncovered rapes he committed against several women over more than a decade -- he was also convicted of multiple counts including forcible rape, sexual penetration by use of force, rape of an unconscious person, and sodomy by use of force.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Prosecutors said Pearce reportedly met Giles and Cabrales-Arzola at an after-hours rave and later drugged them to facilitate a sexual assault.\n      \n\n          The details of Giles' and Cabrales-Arzola's last moments are disturbing. On November 13, 2021, Giles -- a model and aspiring actress -- was already dead when she was taken to Southern California Hospital at Culver City in the L.A. area, ABC7 reports.\n      \n    \n          Cabrales-Arzola -- an architect -- was in critical condition when she arrived at Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Hospital. Her heartbroken family made the difficult decision to take her off life support later that month.\n      \n    \n          Prosecutors told jurors Pearce and co-defendant Brandt Walter Osborn were the ones who dropped the women off at the respective hospitals 2 hours apart ... after they overdosed at the apartment the men shared.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Giles reportedly died of a lethal mix of cocaine, fentanyl, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, and ketamine ... while Cabrales-Arzola died of multiple organ failure, with cocaine, ecstasy, and other undetermined drugs found in her system.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Pearce reportedly denied giving them the drugs that killed them, but after two and half days of deliberation, the jury decided they weren't buying it.\n      \n    \n          Osborn, 46 -- who was facing 2 counts of being an accessory after the fact -- is awaiting a potential retrial after jurors said they were deadlocked over his verdict.\n      \n    \n          Giles' mother, Dusty, reportedly said she was \"so proud\" of the prosecution for winning the case, and happy that Pearce's sexual assault victims \"finally had their day in court\" too.\n      \n      ",

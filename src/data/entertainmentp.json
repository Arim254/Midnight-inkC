    "body": "\n\tAnne Hathaway, Elizabeth Hurley, Tom Ford, Anna Wintour and Donatella Versace are among the global film and fashion celebrities that attended the funeral on Friday of beloved designer Valentino Garavani, who died aged 93 at his Rome residence Monday.\n\n\tValentino, as the iconic fashion mogul was known, appeared as himself in the hit 2006 film “The Devil Wears Prada” alongside Hathaway, who made the trek to Rome to pay her final salute accompanied by husband Adam Schulman. The funeral service was held in Rome’s central Basilica di Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri church. Hurley attended with her son Damian Hurley.\n\t\n\n\tModels Claudia Schiffer and Natalia Vodianova, and veteran British fashion journalist Suzy Menkes also travelled to Rome to mourn the legend known for his “Valentino red” gowns, who dressed some of Hollywood’s biggest stars. \n\n\n\tAlessandro Michele, who is the current creative director at Valentino, was also seen at the ceremony, as was Pierpaolo Piccioli, who led the Valentino brand from 2008 until 2024. Following his retirement in January 2008, a feature-length documentary directed by Matt Tyrnauer about Valentino’s career and life, titled “Valentino: The Last Emperor,” premiered at the Venice Film Festival.\n\n\tIn past days, thousands of mourners lined up to honor the “last emperor” at the headquarters of the Valentino foundation in Rome, where his coffin was adorned with one red rose surrounded by white flowers.\n\n\tRome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri hailed Valentino as one of “Italy’s most luminous and beloved figures,” as tributes poured in from Sophia Loren, Gwyneth Paltrow, Carla Bruni, Cindy Crawford and Colman Domingo, to name a few.\n\t\n\n\tOver the years, Valentino has designed custom wedding dresses for Hathaway, Jennifer Lopez, Gwyneth Paltrow, Courteney Cox and Nicola Peltz Beckham, and continues to be a red-carpet favorite of stars like Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett, Florence Pugh, Zendaya, Dakota Johnson and Elle Fanning.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrime Video has ordered U.K original series “Dirty,” created by Oscar-nominated writer Matt Charman (“Bridge of Spies,” “Treason,” “Hostage”) and described as a “gripping, emotionally charged crime thriller.”\n\n\tThe ongoing series — which marks the first greenlight by Nicole Clemens since joining Amazon MGM Studios as vice president of international originals last year — is billed as a “fresh and provocative” take on a British police drama, exploring universal themes of family loyalty, moral compromise and the corrosive nature of power through an “intricate game of cat-and-mouse between mother and daughter.”\n\t\n\n\tProduction is set to begin in Sept. 2026 in the U.K.\n\n\n\t“Dirty” follows trainee Detective Eva Bennett, who returns to Manchester and joins a new homicide investigation run by her fearsome estranged mother, the legendary Detective Chief Inspector Lois Mercer. As they navigate their complicated relationship and long-buried truths resurface, Eva starts to uncover Lois’ crimes, forcing an impossible choice between justice and blood.\n\n\t“I love the power and the volatility of these two women,” said Charman. “There are no limits on what either of them is capable of, which makes the potential of every scene explosive. Nicole and the entire team at Amazon understood the show instantly — they’re deeply passionate about the blend of character-driven drama and relentless propulsion. I can’t wait to share what we’ve been cooking up.”\n\n\tDirty is produced by Charman’s production company Binocular in association with Amazon MGM Studios. Foz Allan serves as executive producer and the series is created and written by Charman.\n\t\n\n\t“Having long admired Matt’s exceptional work, I am thrilled we are collaborating with him on this remarkable project,” said Clemens. “Centered on two extraordinarily powerful women, it delivers the bold, character-driven storytelling that Global Prime Video audiences have come to expect, and we look forward to sharing it with viewers around the world.”\n\n\t“Dirty” will premiere exclusively on Prime Video globally. \n",

    "body": "\n\tRising stars Aaron McVeigh and Emily Carey are set to star in “Stray,” the latest feature film from BAFTA-winning director David Blair.\n\n\tWritten by Darren James King, “Stray” is a billed as a “gritty, character-driven British thriller set on a London housing estate ruled by fear and manipulation.” The film follows Dylan, a fatherless 17-year-old desperate for belonging, who is groomed by a violent local kingpin offering protection, power, and a warped sense of family, pulling him into a brutal struggle between loyalty, survival, and the life he may never escape.\n\t\n\n\tMcVeigh was recently discovered as a standout new talent in Netflix’s crime series “Dept. Q” and will play Dylan in his first leading role in a feature. Carey, who’s known for their role in “House of the Dragon” and has just wrapped production on Netflix’s “Geek Girl,” stars opposite him in a key role.\n\n\n\t“I was attracted to the story originally because of the misfortune and heartbreak that grows from the collision of emotional famine and ambiguous guidance; a coming-of-age story under siege,” said Blair. “I was enticed, also, by the relationships in the movie which deliver pure dramatic voltage; intimate, unbalanced and precarious. Begging the question, is escape ever truly possible once love and loyalty are bound to brutality?”\n\n\tA two-time BAFTA TV winner with a storied career across TV and film spanning several decades, Blair’s catalog of titles as director includes “Takin’ Over the Asylum” and “The Street,” while he’s worked with the likes of David Tennant, Olivia Colman, Timothy Spall and Christopher Eccleston. “Stray” marks his latest exploration of morally complex, socially grounded British storytelling.\n\t\n\n\t“I am so honoured to be a part of this project,” said McVeigh. “The exploration of humanity, masculinity and the vulnerability of youth is so important now more than ever and I look forward to working with Emily and David.”\n\n\tAdded Carey: “I was drawn to Jenny due to her grounded magnetism. ‘Stray’ is such a raw and fragile coming of age story, set against the backdrop of a dangerous high stakes/high reward environment, and this gives the film such an interesting pace. The script stayed with me for some time after I first read it, and I’m very excited to be on board with this incredible team of creatives.”\n\n\tAdded King: “I wrote this story to explore how mental health is quietly shaped, and sometimes wounded, when young minds are controlled and conditioned before they even understand themselves,”\n\n\t“Stray” — which is currently in development, with further casting and production details to be announced — is produced by Djonny Chen of Silent D Pictures (“High Wire,” “Finding My Voice”), with casting by Ajo Kacmar of IO Casting (“High Wire,” “Dr Campbell”).\n\n\tMcVeigh is repped by Maryam Hunwick (Hunwick Associates) & Laura Stokes (The Artists Partnership).Carey is repped by Curtis Brown Group.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRaabta International is stepping into an increasingly crowded global marketplace as a new Spanish international sales outfit.\n\n\tThe Madrid-based company has launched with a mandate to represent indie features and documentaries with clear commercial upside, aiming to strengthen projects’ international positioning through festival and market exposure and tightly targeted distribution campaigns.\n\n\n\tRaabta International is part of Raabta Pictures, the distribution label of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria-based Garajonay Producciones, led by producers Carlota Amor and Juan Carlos Jiménez, as a pipeline designed to extend that company’s remit from domestic-facing distribution into international sales representation.\n\t\n\n\tFraming itself as a bridge between Spain – and Europe-based producers – and international buyers, Raabta will make its inaugural market appearance at the European Film Market (EFM), which runs alongside the 76th Berlin International Film Festival. It will then in March attend Mafiz, the industry arm of the Málaga Film Festival, now in its 29th edition.\n\n\tRaabta’s arrival comes as Spanish content continues to travel strongly, propelled by streamer demand and heightened buyer interest in premium local-language fare. The company is pitching itself as part of that international drive, focused on ensuring that mid-budget, high-concept titles can cut through a saturated market and find the right partners across territories.\n\n\tA Genre-Fluid Early Slate\n\n\tRaabta’s opening lineup blends food-centric documentary, horror and socially-rooted comedy.\n\t\n\n\tLeading the nonfiction slate is “Noor: Eating History,” a documentary centered on three Michelin star chef Paco Morales, whose menu at his Noor restaurant is inspired by recipes from the 10h century Abderramán III Caliphate. The project’s access to a high-profile culinary figure gives it a clear marketing hook for international buyers.\n\n\tOn the narrative side, Raabta is introducing David Hebrero’s “House of Atreyus” (“La Casa de los Monstruos”), a horror feature starring Antonio Resines (“Father There Is Only One 5”) and “Money Heist” breakout Jaime Lorente. The package pairs recognizable Spanish talent with a genre category that remains among the most bankable in international sales.\n\n\tAlso on the slate is Alberto Utrera’s “Ownerships” (“Nuda propiedad”), a dark comedy tackling the real estate crisis, starring “Valeria’s” Maxi Iglesias and Susana Abaitua (“Los Farad”). \n\n\tExecutive Leadership\n\n\tTo steer its commercial strategy, Raabta has appointed Yvette de los Santos as head of international sales. De los Santos brings experience across promotion, distribution and international marketing for indie films from Latin America and Europe. \n\n\tHer background also includes coordinating festivals and industry events and serving as a jury member and panelist at MiradasDoc, Dones Visuals, DOK Leipzig and the Cannes Short Film Corner.\n\n\t“We consider this the right moment to start Raabta International, and to do so by beginning at the European Film Market in Berlin – one of the strategic markets for the international circulation of Spanish and European cinema,” De los Santos said. \n\n\t“Berlin allows us to present our positioning from the outset, test market interest, and build key relationships with distributors, programmers and international agents,” she noted.\n\n\tOn Raabta’s competitive proposition, De los Santos pointed to a agile operating model and title-by-title execution. “Raabta International was born with a flexible structure that allows us to react quickly to market needs and work each title strategically,” commented. \n\n\t“We back films with a clear identity and international potential, developing tailored sales plans and staying very close to each project to optimize positioning and performance territory by territory,” she added.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDüsseldorf-based boutique outfit Patra Spanou Film has boarded international sales on Brazilian Janaína Marques’ debut feature “I Built a Rocket Imagining Your Arrival” (“Fiz Um Foguete Imaginando Que Você Vinha”). \n\n\tThe pickup comes ahead of the film’s world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival’s Forum section, a key launchpad for more experimental and first-time auteur-driven indie cinema.\n\n\n\tFor Patra Spanou, the acquisition fits its festival-first playbook: working with producers on positioning their festival market launch while representing international rights for distinctive indie features and documentaries.\n\t\n\n\t“I Built a Rocket Imagining Your Arrival” follows Rosa (Verônica Cavalcanti), a woman in her fifties who, during an MRI scan, is instructed to “think of a happy memory” – a prompt that triggers a search for her mother, Dalva (Luciana Souza).\n\n\tDalva’s absence is tied to a defining event: she was imprisoned after killing a man who was about to murder a woman, a trauma that has shaped Rosa’s adult life.\n\n\tMarques structures the film as a memory-driven road movie, cross-cutting Rosa’s clinical present with the imagined reunion she builds with her mother. \n\n\tThe feature adds to the contemporary women-led auteur canon, with touches of magical realism and a queer emotional sensibility.  \n\n\t“Our very own bodies, as a means for survival, wind up embracing certain aspects of delirium,” Marques said, framing imagination as a survival strategy. \n\n\tMarques says the film is built from Rosa’s point of view: Locations shift with her emotions and sound design links what she actually lived to what she imagines. \n\t\n\n\tConceived during the height of the pandemic in Brazil, she added that the film’s insistence on joy and care is a deliberate response to a moment of acute crisis.\n\n\tCreative pedigree and production\n\n\t“I Built a Rocket Imagining Your Arrival” marks Marques’ first feature  following a decorated short-form run. A graduate of Cuba’s EICTV and Spain’s Universidad Carlos III, she broke out with short “Los Minutos, Las Horas,” which premiered at Cannes’ Cinéfondation and went on to win prizes at Clermont-Ferrand, San Sebastián and Havana, among others.\n\n\tThe film is produced by Maurício Macêdo at Moçambique Audiovisual, based in the Brazilian northeastern city of Fortaleza. Delírio Filmesis also behind the film. Moçambique Audiovisual also handles domestic distribution, with consultancy by Fistaile.\n\n\tInstitutional and partner support includes Instituto Mirante de Arte e Cultura, high-profile philanthropic initiative Projeto Paradiso, Show Me The Fund and the Embassy of Brazil in Berlin.\n",

    "description": "\n\tWith “The History of Concrete,” John Wilson takes the least interesting subject imaginable — the dull gray composite used for sidewalks, overpasses ",
    "body": "\n\tWith “The History of Concrete,” John Wilson takes the least interesting subject imaginable — the dull gray composite used for sidewalks, overpasses and pretentious art films like “The Brutalist” — and crafts what’s likely to be the most entertaining documentary of the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. Trying to extract laughs (and deeper insights, on occasion) from a free-associative look at people and projects with ties of some kind to the ugly building material, Wilson feigns interest in “something that occupies so much of your visual environment,” presenting what feels like a parody of nonfiction filmmaking (the loosely structured essay form, at least).\n\t\n\n\tA key conceit of “The History of Concrete” is that no one in their right mind would finance such a film, much less want to watch it. The helmer (and host of HBO’s “How To With John Wilson”) would also like you to think he’s totally unqualified to oversee such a project. And yet, here it is, premiering on opening night of Sundance’s final edition in Park City, Utah. Unless you work for the concrete industry (and those look like fun folks, from a visit to a Las Vegas convention), it’s hard to imagine you saying, “Enough with the jokes. Tell us more about concrete!”\n\n\n\tWilson opens the film in his signature second-person style, telling you what “you” are experiencing in his nasal New York accent, using ultra-specific details that clearly apply only to himself (such as “You unfortunately blew 100% of your film’s budget on your trip to Rome,” where he went to see the 2,100-year-old concrete dome that sits atop the Pantheon). Before settling on concrete as the loosely unifying theme — the cement that binds “the stuff you like” wedged into the film — Wilson bemoans the end of his HBO series and the dwindling residual checks it brings.\n\t\n\n\tBored — which manifests itself more as bemused curiosity, as Wilson collects whatever absurdities catch his interest — he decides to attend the only class the Writers Guild offered during the 2023 strike: “How to Sell and Write a Hallmark Movie.” Wilson has no intention of making one of those cookie-cutter made-for-TV romances, but it’s amusing to infiltrate the spaces where the formula is shared, followed by a trek to a dreary Canadian soundstage where those dreams are spun from recycled props. You can bet that Wilson will refer back to the emotional tricks he learned in class later in his own film, even as pretty much everything else about his approach rejects the “aspirational escapism” Hallmark movies offer.\n\n\tArmed with his handheld Sony camera (or else his iPhone in a pinch), Wilson seems to be rolling at all times, obsessively collecting and chronicling a world from which the device serves a paradoxical function. On one hand, it serves as an invitation for strangers to engage with him, but it’s also a convenient social buffer, delivering a certain ironic distance (room for him to insert sarcasm and judgment in the edit). In the tradition of essay filmmakers like Ross McElwee and Kirsten Johnson, Wilson uses the camera to comment on the world around him, as well as to process his own life choices, building in dead ends, exasperating detours and other shameless digressions for comedic effect — the more random they seem, the more amusing audiences are apt to find them (and the more satisfying, when he finds a way to make those tangents relevant).\n\n\tDoes Wilson really care about concrete? I’m not sure it matters, as the topic provides all the excuse he needs to venture out and pose questions to complete strangers. For example, anyone who has lived in New York City is likely to have noticed the countless chewing gum stains that besmirch the city’s sidewalks. “Gum is like the bird shit of people,” Wilson muses, observing patterns of how and where humans spit out their chud before going out of his way to track down a guy dedicated to blasting discarded wads off the otherwise pristine concrete. “That gum is busted,” the man beams after each successful removal.\n\n\tWith this sequence, Wilson has answered a question you probably never thought to ask, stitching together the weird tangents his brain follows with wry voice-over. It can be hard to follow how the easily distracted director gets from one thought to the next, as in a visit to Bellefontaine, Ohio, to observe the oldest concrete street in America. Wilson interviews a driving instructor, who introduces him to a woman who keeps a swatch of her husband’s skin framed on her wall. That leads Wilson to interview the company that specializes in preserving the tattoos of dead loved ones, and down the rabbit hole he goes.\n\t\n\n\tAt times, Wilson teases himself for not being a more sophisticated director, jumping around from the concrete hand- and footprints outside Hollywood’s famous Chinese Theatre to an unreleased DMX Christmas album. Looking for a way to raise fresh funds for the meandering project (based on a bad joke about it being a “rockumentary”), Wilson goes looking for a working musician with a compelling personal tragedy. He lands on Jack Macco, lead singer of the obscure heavy metal band Nebulus, whom he meets offering free samples at his neighborhood liquor store. Elsewhere in Queens, Wilson observes the contestants in guru Sri Chinmoy’s 3,100-mile self-transcendence race, who circle the same stretch of concrete for weeks on end.\n\n\tAre we dealing with a comedic genius here or some kind of buffoon? The day before seeing “The History of Concrete,” I made a guest appearance at a seminar on Agnès Varda at CalArts, where a student described the French director’s work as “deceptively naive” — the perfect phrase to encapsulate the way Varda assembled “The Gleaners and I,” an intricate essay film so intuitive people often mistake it for being simple. Is Wilson capable of such low-key sophistication? Not really, but he does recognize (the way Hallmark movie writers and AI predictive language models do) how circling around to and ultimately cementing one or two solid ideas can excuse the cracks in an otherwise frivolous endeavor.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA cross-cultural tale of grief and dance, Josef Kubota Wladyka’s “Ha-chan, Shake Your Booty!” stems from an intimate place, but ends up emotionally inert thanks to its style. Its key strength is a committed lead performance from Rinko Kikuchi, who fits effortlessly into a role inspired by the director’s mother. However, while trying to confront grief with a sense of mischief, the movie’s impish tonal approach takes the sting out of death a little too often, rendering its catharsis null. It’s hard not to respect a big swing, but Wladyka ultimately misses.\n\t\n\n\tForty-six-year-old Haru (Kikuchi) lives with her Mexican husband Luis (Alejandro Edda). As partners on the Tokyo ballroom circuit, they have an easygoing relationship, frankly critiquing each other’s form while reviewing clips on a digital tablet over dinner. They also make an added effort to understand each other, and to be understood, by speaking not only in broken English, but in bits of each other’s first languages too. The Japanese and Spanish subtitles are presented in different colors, allowing viewers to more easily nestle themselves in the couple’s comfortable dynamic.\n\n\n\tWhen Luis suddenly dies, Haru is left adrift. After his family insists on repatriating his remains, rather than having him cremated in Tokyo, she can’t find closure, and even imagines him visiting her in the inexplicable guise of a cutesy raven mascot. This makes “Ha-chan, Shake Your Booty!” the umpteenth recent American festival bow to follow this pattern — death also took avian form in last year’s Sundance premiere “The Thing With Feathers” and 2023’s “Tuesday” — though few of these films wield their symbolism with much depth or emotional nuance.\n\t\n\n\tIt certainly helps that Haru can be seen detaching herself from her friends and her hobbies over several months, but the film’s ostensible turning point is a rather strange one. Forced by her longtime dancer pals to return to salsa, samba and cha-cha classes, she’s immediately smitten with her new instructor, a Cuban man named Fedir (Alberto Guerra), though she’s wracked with guilt at the very thought of acting on her feelings. This is a tremendous starting point for any story: Grief tends to take inexplicable forms, including the sensation that moving on romantically might be akin to cheating. It’s through the language of infidelity and open marriage that Haru begins to navigate these complex feelings, but this symbolic mode of confronting death ends up superseding the underlying reality. Beyond a point, “Ha-chan” plays out with the relative simplicity of a film about white lies and infidelity, rather than one about mourning.\n\n\tWladyka, who has a mixed Japanese-Polish background and has spent considerable time directing in Latin America, gracefully navigates some of the film’s cross-cultural specifics, which also result in an earwormy soundtrack drawn from Japanese and Latin influences. His visual approach, however, flattens the ensuing emotional layers. There’s a tongue-in-cheek quality to the way he films Haru and Luis, using crash zooms to enhance moments of mischievous infatuation ultimately built on trust. But it’s with this same visual language that he first brings Fedir into Haru’s purview as well, rendering the sensations of deep, fulfilling, decades-long romance and instantaneous lust with the exact same brushstrokes. It certainly doesn’t help that we aren’t granted nearly enough of Luis’s presence to eventually feel his absence, or enough by way of intoxicating movement before his death to contrast with stifling stillness afterwards.\n\n\tColorful chapter titles — each announced with text cards and enthusiastic Japanese and English voiceover — make “Ha-chan” feel akin to a bubbly Japanese game show, rather than a tale in which a woman’s perspective is tinted by emotional agony. Kikuchi, for her part, imbues the character with dimensions by turns gentle and thorny, but Haru’s unwillingness to meaningfully confront her loss is a blind spot that ends up applied to the story as a whole. The notion of grief gradually fades into the backdrop, finally re-emerging in a manner that is, thanks to the film’s lumpy tonal mixture, more confusing than emotionally cleansing.\n\t\n\n\tOccasional song-and-dance diversions are presented with dull simplicity, as the camera observes choreography at a distance, rather than embodying or enhancing it. And anytime a popular needle drop is deployed, it ends up harkening back to famous musical moments from better films, like “Goodfellas” or “Dirty Dancing.” Even in its strongest moments, “Ha-chan, Shake Your Booty!” is cursed to set the bar much too high for itself. The result is mostly fine — but just “fine” can’t help but feel like a failing when the material has so much promise. In trying to make grief wholly digestible, Wladyka ends up making it bland.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOpening the Göteborg Film Festival on Jan. 23 with “The Quiet Beekeeper” is not only an honor for “Love & Will” director Marcus Carlsson and “The Ugly Stepsister” actor Adam Lundgren – it’s a long-awaited homecoming. The two met at the festival several years ago and vowed to one day work together, a desire that finally became a reality when Carlsson got in touch with Lundgren to say he needed another pair of hands on a script he couldn’t quite crack. \n\t\n\n\tThe friends spent a week in a remote cabin and then a few months more working on what would become the script for “The Quiet Beekeeper,” finetuning their poignant look at grief through the relationship between widower Olof and his teenage daughter Lise (Hedvig Nilsson). Göteborg-born Lundgren, who did not have previous experience with screenwriting, tells Variety he appreciated the time he and Carlsson spent breaking down their own family histories and the textures of the small communities both come from. \n\n\n\t“I tried to squeeze Marcus into the classic structure of a story, and he immediately went, ‘No, that is not what I want to do,’” he says, laughing. “Then he showed me many films, and I got it. Marcus is a very intuitive director. I call him a method director, because he is right there with you, sweating with you in a scene, always close.” \n\n\tSome of the films Carlsson showed Lundgren include Kelly Reichardt’s “Certain Women” and Bruce Beresford’s “Tender Mercies,” especially Robert Duvall’s performance in the 1983 drama. \n\n\tCarlsson praises his lead actor for how well he incorporates the essence of Duvall’s performance, as well as “beautifully” communicating Olof’s inner world despite the sparse dialogue. “It’s great for a director when you have an actor like Adam, especially because I wanted the film to portray what is happening inside the character. We struggled with writing dialogue because we were hesitant about how much we wanted to say, and how much Adam was to play. When I saw Adam on set, it became clear.”\n\t\n\n\tCommunicating much with few words, however, was not Lundgren’s biggest challenge. To play Olof, the actor worked extensively on his accent so that it would match the one in the county of Värmland, where they shot the film over the course of a summer. “In the film, I speak with a very thick, very specific Swedish accent usually used for comedy,” says the actor. “Two weeks before shooting, I tried to get out of it because it was so much work. I am glad I did not chicken out because it would not be authentic to make the film in this region and then talk in a Stockholm accent. It’s also an ode to the people from the region, because we are so bad at working with accents in Sweden.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Quiet Beekeeper,” courtesy of Göteborg Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFilming in the west-central region of Sweden greatly influenced not only the work of the cast, but the overall tone of the film, with Carlsson saying it was “vital” to him to shoot “The Quiet Beekeeper” in Värmland. “It is such a culturally rich district,” says the director. “The temperature and the feeling of the film very much come from its landscape, too. I don’t think I could have shot the film in any other place. It was very important to me.” \n\n\tThe film, shot on Alexa Mini with 16mm crop lenses, has a grainy, tangible texture that also permeates the beautifully crafted opening credits. “I’m a nostalgic person,” Carlsson points out. “I was thinking about my childhood, my hometown. Those textures of memory, to me, are warm and grainy. I was looking at something similar to what was done recently in ‘Train Dreams,’ and was also inspired by the look of ‘EO.’ It’s such a wonderful film.”\n\n\t“It was very hard to land on what we have because I didn’t want it to feel like it was digital,” he adds. “We spent a long time working on the grains and mimicking that on the title sequence, so the entire film had the same look and feel. I’m very pleased with the result.”  \n\n\tCarlsson’s career is deeply intertwined with the Göteborg Film Festival, having won the Audience Award for his 2014 “Dirtbags” and screening his feature debut “Love & Will” at the Swedish fete in 2018. Now, readying himself to open the festival that helped launch his career, the director is taking a moment to reflect on his national film industry. \n\t\n\n\t“Today, Swedish films do very well outside of Sweden,” he says. “But I wish we had more money and could work on different stories and more original screenplays. It’s been a little more American lately, and I think we have so much great storytelling in Sweden. This film is proof of that, in a way.” \n\n\tLundgren echoes his collaborator, saying that, today, Swedish audiences “do not want to go to cinemas to watch Swedish films.” “We lost the audience’s trust a few years back, and I think we are just now starting to rebuild it. It’s going to take time, so more money would help. It’s like that quote from an old politician that goes: the problem with film workers is that, if you get money, you work. If you don’t get money, you work. And it’s a real issue. Also, I think we must look at the whole country, not just the big cities. If we only look at the capitals, we miss the small stories, and Sweden has so much to tell the world.” \n\n\t“The Quiet Beekeeper” is produced by Lovisa Charlier Ginday at Mariedamfilm. It is also part of the Göteborg Film Festival’s Nordic Competition.\n\n\tThe Göteborg Film Festival runs Jan. 23-Feb. 1.\n",

    "description": "\n\t“We are sad it’s the last Sundance in Park City, but we will see what Colorado is all about,” Judd Apatow said at Thursday’s opening night premiere ",
    "body": "\n\t“We are sad it’s the last Sundance in Park City, but we will see what Colorado is all about,” Judd Apatow said at Thursday’s opening night premiere of the documentary “Paralyzed by Hope: The Maria Bamford Story.”\n\n\tThe director vocalized the uneasy feeling that many festival-goers were experiencing as they headed up the mountain one last time before Sundance departs for Boulder in 2027. The festival has been under financial pressure since COVID forced its organizers to cancel two in-person editions — and as the indie film business it celebrates struggles to draw crowds. Colorado is offering tax breaks and financial incentives, but it’s hard to leave the place that filmmakers have called home for more than 40 years.\n\t\n\n\tYet Sundance rolled out the red carpet for filmmakers like Apatow and stars including Chris Pine, Jenny Slate and Riz Ahmed. It was a packed first day of programming with Pine and Slate hitting the Eccles, the festival’s largest venue, for the afternoon premiere of “Carousel,” a lyrical drama about a divorced doctor who reconnects with his high school girlfriend after she returns to their hometown. Ahmed was on hand for his new Amazon series “Bait,” in which he plays an actor whose star rises when he auditions to play James Bond, while observational humorist John Wilson touched down in Sundance to debut his new documentary “The History of Concrete.”\n\n\n\tDespite the challenges that have been roiling the industry, Pine insisted he’s optimistic about the future of arthouse films and feels strongly that independent cinema “is still alive and kicking.”\n\t\n\n\t“People want to go see cinema. Whether or not it looks anything like 20 years ago or 30 years ago, it doesn’t really matter,” he told Variety on the red carpet prior to the “Carousel” premiere. “We may have some diminishment in terms of cinema being the center of the zeitgeist, but my god, people still want to see it.”\n\n\tOne of the opening night’s most warmly received offerings, comedic drama “Ha-chan, Shake Your Booty!,” entered the festival with a relatively low profile. However, the story of a widow (Rinko Kikuchi) whose love of dancing helps her break out of a deep depression struck a chord with the evening crowd at the Eccles, who leapt to their feet as the credits rolled. The film’s director and co-writer Josef Kubota Wladyka said “Ha-chan” was intended as a tribute to his 80-year-old mother, who was in the audience as he basked in the applause.\n\n\t“My mom has been through a lot of tribulations in her life,” Wladyka said. “She had to raise three boys on her own, and the one thing that she always fell back on to help her get through the hard times was dancing. So we wanted to create this film that was an homage to her, to show that no matter how messy life gets, you’ve got to keep moving forward, and you’ve got to keep dancing.”\n\n\tThe festival’s opening day was unseasonably warm. Instead of dazzlingly white mountains and massive drifts, there were only patches of snow. It was also quiet on Main Street, with overpriced boutiques showcasing “Farewell” gear. The Marquis, an upscale club in the middle of scores of installations, advertised a series of DJ sets billed as “The Last Dance,” with A-listers like Anderson .Paak (as his alter ego, DJ Pee .Wee) and Diplo set to fête the host city’s final days. The Egyptian, an iconic hub for downtown premieres, isn’t showing new films tied to the festival. Instead, plastered posters out front advertised a musical tribute to “Little Miss Sunshine,” one of Sundance’s biggest breakouts, that’s set to run during the fest.\n\n\tDays before Sundance started, Festival Director Eugene Hernandez admitted this edition was bittersweet, because it’s the last hurrah in Utah and it’s being held shortly after its founder Robert Redford died in September at the age of 89.\n\n\t“Everything became much more poignant with the passing of Mr. Redford,” Hernandez said.\n\t\n\n\tIt also made Hernandez, who has been coming to Sundance since the early ’90s as a journalist for IndieWire and later as a festival programmer, think about the impact that the gathering has had on indie cinema. It’s one that helped launch the careers of everyone from Quentin Tarantino, who debuted “Reservoir Dogs” in Park City in 1992, to Ryan Coogler, who premiered “Fruitvale Station” to raves in 2013. Other alums include Steven Soderbergh, Kenneth Lonergan, Ava DuVernay, Damien Chazelle and Richard Linklater. Many also participated in the Sundance Institute, where they were mentored by other, more established filmmakers.\n\n\t“Mr. Redford created a space to bring established and emerging artists together so that their stories could be workshopped and rehearsed, and their scripts could be rewritten and evolved. Then he held a festival where their work could be shown,” Hernandez said. “That legacy is so woven into my own personal understanding of what independent cinema can be.”\n\n\tThere was an elegiac vibe to what is traditionally a celebratory occasion, as countless conversations mentioned “the last Sundance,” with others quick to add “…in Park City” — as to not sound too bleak about the future in Boulder. At the Ray Theater, a melancholic Apatow reflected on saying goodbye to Utah.\n\n\t“It’s heartbreaking. I have so many great memories here,” Apatow told Variety. “It’s a bummer, but life changes — and I need to accept that.”\n\n\tAntonio Ferme and William Earl contributed to this report.\n",

As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events.

Jordan, director Ryan Coolger, on set, 2025. © Warner Bros. / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tOscars Commentary (Updated: Jan. 22, 2026): In one morning, the Oscar race went from settled to chaotic, and the reason is simple: “Sinners.”\n\n\tFor months, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” looked like a juggernaut poised to coast to the finish line. Instead, the race cracked wide open thanks to Ryan Coogler’s audacious vampire epic “Sinners,” which stormed the nominations with a record-breaking 16 mentions — the most ever for a single film.\n\n\t“One Battle After Another” remains a formidable contender with 13 nods, a sign of deep industry respect for both the film and the auteur, now a 14-time nominee who has yet to take home a competitive Oscar. But a surprise omission — Chase Infiniti missed the best actress race — may expose just enough vulnerability to invite a challenger, and that challenger is Coogler’s box office smash.\n\n\tOther contenders landed respectable hauls, but none assembled the kind of nomination package that usually produces a best picture winner.\n\n\tChloé Zhao’s “Hamnet,” with eight nominations, is elegant and admired. Still, key misses — notably Paul Mescal in supporting actor and the film’s editing — make an upset difficult, even with lead actress Jessie Buckley positioned as the most likely acting winner of the season.\n\n\tGuillermo del Toro’s Gothic adaptation of “Frankenstein” received nine nominations. But the absence of a directing nod is historically tough to overcome, especially in a year dominated by two heavyweight frontrunners.\n\n\tWhat separates “Sinners” isn’t merely the volume it amassed. It’s also that it clearly resonated across all 19 branches of the Academy. Coogler enters the race having shattered records for Black representation. Ten Black artists are nominated for their work on the film, tying “Judas and the Black Messiah” (2021) for the most from a single movie. Coogler is only the third Black filmmaker nominated in the same year for producing, directing and screenwriting, joining Jordan Peele and Spike Lee, and the seventh Black man nominated for directing. His producing partner and wife, Zinzi Coogler, also made history as the first Filipina producer and the third Black woman nominated for best picture.\n\n\tThe film’s impact stretches across the crafts, with breakthroughs in cinematography — Autumn Durald Arkapaw is the first woman of color to be recognized — and costume design for two-time winner Ruth E. Carter, now the most-nominated Black woman in Oscar history.\n\n\tMore important, there’s precedent for an upset.\n\n\tThe race between “La La Land” and “Moonlight” from 2016 proved that a timely and urgent drama could overtake a seemingly unstoppable musical frontrunner. And “Moonlight” achieved that with only a Golden Globe for best picture (drama) and a WGA prize under its belt.\n\n\tWhen the World War I epic “1917” (2019) swept key precursors, only for the Academy ultimately to crown Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite” the first non-English-language best picture winner, it showed the group could rise to the occasion of a historic moment, even though the film had just a SAG ensemble win to its name.\n\n\tOverall, the noms revealed an unusually top-heavy year. Only 50 films were recognized across all categories, matching last year’s total and marking the lowest number since 2008. Whether that reflects shrinking viewing habits or an oversaturated landscape remains up for debate.\n\n\tIn some areas, the Academy continued to expand its horizons. A landmark four non-English-language performances earned acting nominations, and international cinema placed two films in both best picture and international feature for the second consecutive year. Latino artists posted historic gains across producing (Guillermo del Toro), acting (Wagner Moura for “The Secret Agent”) and animation (Yvett Merino for “Zootopia 2”). At the same time, women reached new highs in directing, sound — with “Sirāt” fielding the first all-women sound team — and overall representation, with a record 74 women nominated.\n\n\tTaken together, this year’s nominations paint a portrait of an Academy in transition. Still imperfect and still evolving, it is increasingly responsive to films that marry craft, ambition and cultural relevance.\n\n\tWhat once felt like an inevitable model now feels thrillingly uncertain.\n\n\tProjected winner leaders (films): “Sinners” (7), “One Battle After Another” (3), “F1,” “Frankenstein” and “Sentimental Value” (2)\n\n\tProjected winner leaders (studios): Warner Bros.

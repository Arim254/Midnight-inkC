    "body": "\n\tLabubu cinema is real. Sony Pictures has acquired screen rights to the Chinese brand and has set its sights on developing a feature film, and potentially a franchise, based on the ubiquitous and very trendy dolls that became pop culture fixation over the past year.\n\n\tThe project remains in an extremely nascent stage, with no talent or producers attached. Sony Pictures had no comment. \n\n\n\tThough Labubu first hit the market in 2015, the line of collectible figurines only exploded in popularity over the past year — first among a cultish niche, then hitting a mainstream gotta-have-it mania. The toys, from Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, are available in a “blind-box” format, meaning the exact character one is buying is a mystery until opened — a packaging strategy that has with contributed to the product’s fiendish secondary market. \n\t\n\n\tA series of celebrity endorsements, particularly in the K-pop space, skyrocketed the brand and made it into a household name.\n\n\n\t“Labubu is my baby,” Blackpink’s Lisa said in a Teen Vogue interview earlier this year.\n\n\tNBA player Dillon Brooks was seen wearing a Labubu on a chain while arriving to a playoff game in May.\n\n\t“I like the Labubus. I got like four of them,” Brooks said in an interview in October. “I like the trend. It’s cool and… Um… It’s cute.”\n\n\tMore to come… \n",

    "body": "\n\tOffering prizes to Almodóvar lead and rapidly-risen star Milena Smit (“Parallel Mothers”) and evergreen Spanish comedy icon Fernando Tejero (“Aquí no hay quien viva”), notable as the ethically spineless priest in Alejandro Amenábar’s “The Captive,” the resilient Huelva Ibero-American Film Festival bows on Nov. 14 with an powerfully enticing line-up of Latin American titles in main competition, a reminder of Spanish cinema’s current power in section Acento and five doc-features in Talento Andaluz. \n\t\n\n\t10 takes on why Huelva, a festival in an Andalusian seaport, remains an essential part of the international film circuit:\n\n\n\tHuelva’s Vital Role \n\n\tHuelva’s 51st edition has one innovation: Latidos (see below). Apart from that, it will continue to do what it does best: Throwing further light on titles – Latin American or Spanish and sometimes Andalusian – which have bowed to critical acclaim, but merit far more international attention. That now is a pressing need. In 2003, Latin America and the Caribbean produced 179 features, according to Omdia. That figure shot up to 761 by 2023. Unless it wins big time at a big festival, such as Cannes Un Certain Regard Award laureate “The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo,” at Huelva this year, a Latin America movie need further promotion platforms. Huelva is one of the most prominent. \n\n\tGenre Build\n\n\tSome of Huelva’s largest pleasures this year are afforded by genre, understood in a broader sense. Of Competition movies, “The Reborn” is an Argentine classic hard-boiled actioner,“A Bright Future,” from Uruguay’s Lucía Garibaldi, a touching sci-fi retro futuristic allegory, Colombian Tomas Corredor’s “Noviembre” a gripping siege thriller, Chile’s “Isla Negra” a hard-hitting home invasion suspense drama. That said, all four films retain the hallmark ADN of Latin American cinema: its social point. “A Bright Future” questions capitalism;, in “Isla Negra,” one ends up sympathising with the invaders, victims of wholesale home evictions along Chile’s coast. \n\t\n\n\tHuelva: Not So Far From Hollywood\n\n\tSean Penn came to champion the Oscar candidacy of Huelva 2024 standout “Manas,” boarding as an executive producer. “It Would Be Night in Caracas,” in this year’s Huelva competition, stars Edgar Ramírez (“American Crime Story”) who also produces and originated the project, alongside Natalia Reyes (“Terminator: Dark Fate”). Reyes is also the most identifiable face in hostage crisis thriller “Noviembre,” also in Huelva Competition this year. “The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo,” playing out of competition at Huelva, is Chile’s Oscar entry. Huelva is 5,500 miles from Hollywood. But, despite most titles meriting far more attention, they are not entirely off everybody’s radar in Hollywood. \n\n\tHuelva’s Range\n\n\t“Many Latin American cineastes have grown up with another generation of cinema, mixing social denunciation with more open formats for the public,” says Manuel H. Martín, Huelva Ibero-American Film Festival director, talking about the rise of Latin American genre. “What we’re trying to do is mix these films with others which might not be for a broad public but still have an audience,” he adds, citing Clarisa Navas’ 212-minute “The Prince of Nanawa,” a kind of Paraguayan “Boyhood,” studying modern masculinity through a 10-year real life coming of age narrative. Equally, J.M. Cravioto’s ‘Wheels, Weed & Rock n’ Roll, “gives a far broader, diverse vision of Latin American filmmaking,” says Martín. \n\n\tRafael Cobos: Andalusia’s Spanish Cinema Drive\n\n\tAndalusia, like Catalonia and the Basque Country, is a Spanish cinema driving force. This year alone, the Seville-based Cobos has co-written “Tigres,” one of the biggest movies of 2025, and “The Anatomy of a Moment,” hailed as the Spanish series of the year. He has also directed his first feature, “Golpes,” an inspired mix of early ‘80s “quinqui” heist thriller  and brothers reconciliation drama of large social point. It’s not just Latin America which is ringing that combination. Somebody should erect a monument to him, or give him a prize; which is exactly what Canal Sur, Andalusia’s public broadcaster, will do at this year’s Huelva.  \n\n\tSpain’s Filmic Powerhouse\n\t\n\n\tRarely has Spanish cinema fired on so many cylinders. Huelva’s Acento, Cine Español strand is a case in point. It features “Tigres” and “Golpes,” but also Carla Simón’s admired Cannes Competition player “Romería” and “Sundays,” the San Sebastián Golden Shell laureate from Alauda Ruíz de Azua, whose “Querer” won the Grand Prix at March’s Series Mania, Europe’s biggest TV fest. Even its smallest films are large pleasures, such as “Flores for Antonio,” a Goodfellas pick-up. Spain looks set to have a marvellous year in 2026, with movies from Almodóvar, Rodrigo Sorogoyen and Javier Ambrossi and Javier Calvo in the hopper. Huelva offers a chance to sample its talent before international talk breaks out of Spain’s firepower.          \n\n\tAndalusian Premieres \n\n\tTalento Andaluz showcases the best of recent Andalusian doc features. Rafael Cobos. for example, has also produced and co-penned doc feature “Ellas en la Ciudad,” a standout in Huelva’s Talento Andaluz section, recognising the role of women in building Seville’s new barrios, humble outlying neighbourhoods which now form a key part of the city. Another doc feature in Talento Andaluz on which word is also good, “Pendaripen,” from Alfonso Sánchez, whose “Sembrando Sueños opened Huelva in 2019, reps a vigorous revisionist take on the Roma people, victims of 600 years of racism and ignorance.       \n\n\tYon González: Spain’s New Generation of Stars\n\n\tHuelva is a film festival. Its stars these days, however, often come from TV. One case in point, who receives a Luz Award alongside Milena Smit: suave charmer Yon Gónzalez. He starred in “Grand Hotel” (2011-13), one of the first Spanish series to light a fire in Latin America without being dubbed into neutral Spanish. He led again Netflix’s first series in Spain,  “Cable Girls” (2017-20). He’s now broken into the U.S. Hispanic market toplining Telemundo Studios “Velvet. El Nuevo Imperio.” González receives a Huelva Premio Luz. His export potential will sure soon be put to good use.        \n\n\tHiking Local Impact: Latidos \n\n\tHuelva’s biggest 2025 departure, a new section, Latidos, recognises what it has already done before, free-of-charge charity screenings and concerts. The initiative now gets an official name and a boost. This year’s inaugural Latidos lineup takes in “Andy and Lucas,” a portrait of the Cadiz musical duo, odd friendship tale “El cielo de los animales” and a new film from Santi Amodeo, a “vibrant and idiosyncratic” director, Variety has said, director of memorable titles such as “Doghead” and the underrated “The Gentiles” in 2021. \n\t\n\n\tHuelva’s Industry Drive: Education\n\n\tThe Andalusia Agency for Cultural Institutions (AAIICC) authorities launched earlier this year a residency program for Andalusian screenwriters, teaming with the Huelva Festival. A second Residency initiative will mentor four film projects from Extremadura, Huelva director Manuel H. Martín notes. “Industry activities are great but education, professional training as important: If we don’t have audiences which watch our films on the big screen, it’s very difficult maintain an industry,” he added.  And he’s dead right. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 2025 Ibero-American Huelva Film Festival offers far fewer titles than many festivals. That sense of curation is one of its pleasures. That said, because of that same choice selection, it’s immensely difficult to select 10 titles. Variety’s 10 titles have focused in the main part on broader audience thrillers and largely titles which have bowed quite recently. Variety could have easily have chosen completely different titles.   \n\t\n\n\t“A Bright Future,” (Lucia Garibaldi, Cimarrón, Uruguay, Argentina, Germany)\n\n\n\tA touching sci-fi retro futuristic allegory of the false lure of capitalism, set in an unspecified part of Latin America’s plagued by pests and the mass extinction of cats and dogs. There its most brilliant youth are offered a one-way ticket to a said-to-be prosperous and hugely productive North. One ticket winner, Camila, however, increasingly wants out of travelling. This year’s Tribeca Viewpoints winner, building Garibaldi’s caché after debut “The Sharks.”\n\n\n\t“Ellas en la Ciudad,” (Reyes Gallego, Movistar Plus+, Las Afueras Films, Canal Sur)\n\n\tGallego’s feature debut, co-written and produced by Rafael Cobos, a portrait of the women who helped create the outlying districts of Seville in the ‘70s, proving the backbone of their communities and part of Spain’s cultural patrimony. Talking to the camera, the women themselves also voice their frustrations at having lived there lives just housewives. A buzzed up title in Huelva’s Talento Andaluz. \n\n\t“Flowers for Antonio,” (Elena Molina, Isaki Lacuesta, Boomerang TV, Caballo Films, Spain)\n\t\n\n\tA lovely man and a loving father, Antonio Flores, also talented singer composer, died from overdose in 1995, two weeks after his mother. “Money Heist” star Alba Flores, his daughter, who was eight at the time, asks why and attempts to capture his essence, his duende. Movistar Plus+ is famed for its fiction series. “Flowers for Antonio,” directed by Molina and Lacuesta, in his prime, speaks well of its attempt to address Spain’s recent history through bio-docs or broader focuses. A moving discovery for anyone who wants one.\n\n\t“Isla Negra,” (Jorge Riquelme Serrano, Laberinto Films, El Quisco, Chile)\n\n\tSet at a luxury beach house, based on real events and starring the “reliably superb” Alfredo Castro, Variety once said, in a hard-hitting, discomfiting home invasion thriller highlighting Chile’s class gulf and the rash of evictions thanks to real estate development schemes on Chile’s stunning coast. Riquelme’s third feature after “Camaleón” and San Sebastián 2019 New Directors Award winner “Some Beasts,” an Audience Award winner at Switzerland’s Filmar fest. 70    \n\n\t“It Would Be Night in Caracas,” (Marité Ugás, Mariana Rondón, Redrum, Absolute Artists, Impression Entertainment, Mexico, Spain)\n\n\t“Natalia Reyes and Edgar Ramírez star in a tense, moving and sorrowfully instructive story of surviving social collapse, set against the backdrop of the 2017 riots in Caracas,” Variety enthused in October. “The line between historical recreation and genre reimagining has seldom been as effectively blurred,” reviewer Jessica Kiang went on, praising how the film mines “pulp pleasures” and its “expertly tooled dystopian rollercoaster ride.” Further consecration for Ugás and Rondón whose “Bad Hair” won San Sebastián’s top prize, its Golden Shell, in 2013.    \n\n\t“November,” Tomás Corredor (Burning, Piano, Vulcana Cinema, Tordenfilm, Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, Norway)\n\n\tShot like an action doc, often in dark, with long shots but a claustrophobic box format, interspersed by archival footage. After M-19 forces assault Colombia’s Palace of Justice in November 1985, guerrilla fighters, magistrates and civilians end up trapped together in one of its bathrooms, certain that when Colombia’s army retake the Palacio they will most likely die. “‘November’ explores human fragility faced by an unmanageable reality: Imminent death. It’s about resistance,” Corredor tells Variety. Picked up by Cineplex for sales and also acquired by Prime Video.\n\t\n\n\t“Pendaripen,” (Alfonso Sánchez, Enciende TV)\n\n\tWhere did the Roma people – gitanos in Spanish  – come from? Answer: Kannauj in Northern India. How did it enter Spain?Answer: via Huesca in the Pyrenees. Setting the record right on the history of the Roma people, this vigorous revindication chronicles centuries of racism and recent historic legislation, though discrimination remains.  Backed by national pubcaster RTVW and Andalusian state TV Canal Sur. The latest from Huelva Premio Luz winner Sánchez.\n\n\t“The Reborn,” (Santiago Esteves, Le Tiro, El Otro Film, Zabriskie Films, Yagán Films, Rio Films, Argentina, Chile, Spain)\n\n\tFrom the producers of “La Residencia” and “Upon Entry,” Shanghai’s Golden Goblet winner and a taut, propulsive hard-boiled thriller as brothers Manuel and Oscars battle for survival after faking a man’s death for the mob, with the operation going hair-raisingly awry. Esteves’ “Rey’s Education” (2017) impressed. Favourably reviewed  – “an intelligent exploration of complex emotional dynamics,” said Argentina’s La Nación – and set against majestic Mendoza Andes, “The Reborn” should enhance Esteves’ reputation. Sold by Latido Films.\n\n\t“Vainilla,” (Mayra Hermosillo, Redrum, Mexico)\n\n\tSet in the late ‘80s, a family of seven women from different generations and ideologies battles to save the house they live in, seen from the POV of the youngest, Roberta, aged 8. The warm-humored first feature of actor-turned-director Hermosillo set up at Stacy Perskie’s Redrum, a co-executive producer on “Narcos: Mexico” and producer on Rodrigo Prieto’s “Pedro Paramo.” One of the hottest upcoming titles at last year’s Ventana Sur, eventually bought by Spain’s Bendita Film Sales, and world premiering in Venice Days to applause from those who caught it. \n\n\t“Wheels, Weed & Rock n’ Roll,” (José María Cravioto, Mexico) \n\n\tFrom top-flight maverick Cravioto, a director on “El Chapo” and now Alex Pina’s “Billionaires’ Bunker.” Here he delivers an often comedic knockabout mockumentary about what he calls one of the most critical episodes of Mexican counter-culture: the Festival de Avándaro. Meant to be a car race, it ballooned into Mexico’s Woodstock, “a hell of naked depravity, blood, potheads and death,” one far-right critic trumpeted. Mexico’s government cracked down on rock ’n’ roll, which took a decade to recover.\n",

    "description": "\n\tWith 11 stand-up specials under his belt, Jim Gaffigan is one of the most prolific comedians this side of George Carlin.\n\n\tHis family-friendly jokes",
    "body": "\n\tWith 11 stand-up specials under his belt, Jim Gaffigan is one of the most prolific comedians this side of George Carlin.\n\n\tHis family-friendly jokes about parenting and food made Gaffigan a household name — try strolling down the frozen aisle without thinking of that high-pitched whisper: “Hot Pockeeettt.” He has anchored TV series, written books and held serious acting roles in films like “Chappaquiddick” and “Linoleum.” And he reinvented himself in the extended role of vice presidential candidate Tim Walz on “Saturday Night Live.”\n\t\n\n\tOn Sunday, Variety presented Gaffigan with the inaugural Comedy Vanguard Award in association with the New York Comedy Festival. Gaffigan accepted the honor at the Upright Citizens Brigade in Downtown Manhattan and sat down for a wide-ranging interview in front of a live audience.\n\n\n\tBelow is an edited transcript of that interview.\n\t\n\t\tI’m going to start with a softball question: What do you find funny?\t\n\n\tMy kids make me laugh the most — the sarcasm and inappropriateness I’ve instilled in them. It annoys my wife. Otherwise, a really well-crafted stand-up joke, whether it’s Brian Regan or Chris Rock.\n\t\n\t\tHas your sense of humor changed over time?\t\n\n\tOh yeah, it’s definitely evolved. That’s what’s really interesting about having children — the value of irreverence. When you’re 19 or 21, the excitement around irreverence is so much more appealing than nuance. You appreciate nuance later on. When I was in college, I worked as a doorman at a comedy club, and I remember thinking, “Oh, these boring comedians.” I liked the edgy guys. I would have disliked my own comedy back then.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou’re generally known as a clean comic. Was that always the case when you were starting out?\t\n\n\tNo, I tried on a lot of different hats. I tried being edgy. There’s footage of me smoking on stage. A lot of it is just trial and error. Eventually, you end up being the person you actually are on stage. That’s kind of unavoidable in stand-up, if you want to embrace authenticity.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does that trial and error look like, in a practical sense? How long did it take you to get to who you are now?\t\n\n\tSome of it is the 10,000 hours and transferring what makes you funny with your friends onto the stage. But the trial and error is being educated on how the audience perceives you. It’s similar to being a character actor, which I also am, which is code for “ugly.” You need self-awareness. When I’d go onstage at Pips in 1993, the crowd had just seen Andrew Dice Clay, and they’d see me and think I’m John Tesh. I wanted to not be John Tesh, but eventually I had to face the reality that this is what I look like. It’s unfortunate.\n\t\n\t\tBy the way, Jim, you’re a very good-looking guy.\t\n\n\tI’m married, but thanks.\n\t\n\t\tDo you think there are certain personas you could not access on stage — or couldn’t make funny — because of your appearance?\t\n\n\tComedians get a lot of credit or criticism for the comedy they do, but the reality is, they do exactly what they’re kind of allowed to do. I’m a big, lumbering white guy. If I was angry, I don’t think that would be appealing. Louis Black can be angry, even Bill Burr can be angry. But if I’m angry, it just makes the audience uncomfortable. If I’m silly and self-effacing, that’s palatable to the audience.\n\t\n\t\tAre you a silly person off stage?\t\n\n\tI’d say I’m a silly person with my comedian friends. What I love about stand-up is that element of play — giving someone shit, that sarcastic banter. I wouldn’t describe it as roasting; it’s just play. Some comedians are always in play and doing bits, like Todd Glass. That’s why comics gravitate toward each other: it’s a play environment. But when I’m with my kids, no — I’m very focused. I’m also someone who has to work hard. I don’t know what kind of learning disabilities I have, but even studying lines for an acting role takes me longer than it would take my wife.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve talked a lot about how you are obsessed with the writing and editing of stand-up comedy. What does that process actually look like for you?\t\n\n\tIt’s always changing. Some of it is conversational. Twenty years ago, I would often discuss bits with my wife, and now I might be discussing them with my opening comedian, Ted Alexandro. The writing and rewriting is really valuable, and that’s something I do when I tour. I don’t have that luxury at home because kids are too much work. If you’re thinking of having children, don’t. The luxury of doing shows out of town is that I can spend those days listening to a set and dissecting how I could expand it. For me, it’s not that I have to walk away from a writing session with a joke — I just feel good if I made the effort.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJason Alpert-Wisnia\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI want to go back to your early days in the 1990s in New York. You were an ad salesman during the day, and you’d perform at clubs at night. Is it true you were woken up at the office to be fired from your day job?\t\n\n\tAbsolutely. And the cruelty is that a friend of mine, Dave Attell, already had a joke about being woken up to be fired. Whenever this comes up, out of respect, I have to mention the fact that Dave Attell had this joke. But yes, I worked in advertising, and I’m really grateful for that experience. As a copywriter, the editing process, figuring out the shortest way to say something, is incredibly valuable, and that carries over into stand-up. But I was also a coward! Tons of my friends didn’t have day jobs, they would just do shows to make ends meet. I waited until they fired me, because that’s the kind of guy I am.\n\t\n\t\tYou worked the clubs for nearly a decade before getting your “big break.” Did you ever make a deal with yourself that if you hadn’t “made it” by a certain time you would quit comedy? What motivated you to keep going?\t\n\n\tI was just so relieved when I discovered the creative reward of stand-up. I was definitely delusional. After six months of doing stand-up, I remember thinking, “I can’t believe I haven’t been on ‘Letterman.’” And then I didn’t get on for seven years. So, I did a lot of work on myself — therapy and stuff like that — but there was no expectation of “I’m going to stop doing this.” I remember sitting in a therapist’s office going, “Everyone in my peer group has done ‘Conan’ or ‘Letterman’ or ‘The Tonight Show.’ I’m never going to do that. I’m never going to have any monetary success in stand-up. Am I comfortable with that? Am I essentially comfortable being the weird uncle?” Because I didn’t have a girlfriend, either. And then I went, “You know what? I enjoy stand-up, I find it fulfilling. I’ll be the weird uncle.” When I made that decision and gave up on trying to make things work, then things started coming together.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou mentioned the word “delusional.” Is that a necessary trait for any artist to have?\t\n\n\tAll comedians are delusional — you have to be. If insanity is repeating something and expecting a different result, even the quickest careers involve five years of failure, and that’s insanity, right?\n\t\n\t\tWhen you did find success, you were on “Letterman” and then quickly given a TV show, “Welcome to New York,” which was canceled after one season. What was it like to reach that peak and then have it taken away? What were the lessons you learned?\t\n\n\tI feel like my career is this balance between creative fulfillment and getting caught up in other people’s expectations. And when you get caught up in other people’s expectations, that’s when you become frustrated. But having that opportunity to do that show was a really strong educational experience.\n\n\tIt’s weird, because comedians are very much self-servers, but they also have to be cooperative and compliant. They go into a club environment and they have to be deferential to the person who books it, the person who oversees it. So, they have to be audacious to get there, but they also have to be deferential. They need some schmoozing skills. But in the entertainment industry — particularly when creating and executing a show — you have to be protective of your ideas. I’m not saying you have to be Roseanne [Barr], but you have to be protective.\n\n\tThe skills that work in stand-up — not just the writing, but the business of stand-up — are completely different from the sitcom or television world. Acting is something I love, but it’s insane. I used to say auditioning is like stripping, but you don’t get a dollar. There’s an amount of humiliation and rejection every creative person has to embrace.\n\t\n\t\tAre you still having to make those compromises?\t\n\n\tDefinitely. I can pick and choose what I want to do, or how I want to do it, but there is constant compromise. Anyone who says they don’t have to compromise is not being honest.\n\t\n\t\tWhat are the boundaries you would not cross?\t\n\n\tIt sounds corny, but being a comedy nerd and having studied stand-up, I do think there’s an aftertaste to stand-up that people don’t realize. I don’t want my stand-up to leave people with that icky feeling. I don’t want to punch down. We all have friends who are super bitchy and gossipy, and they’re great to hang out with. But an hour after that, you’re like, “I feel kind of bad. We were making fun of Melissa forever.” I’m not saying I’m not guilty of this, because there is a lot of anger, and I have a very dark heart. But it’s better to bring insight and make a joke as a commentary on all humans.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI don’t bring this up as an example of punching down, but in your latest special you have a joke about Pat Sajak retiring from hosting “Wheel of Fortune.” You say, “You can’t retire from playing hangman” and talk about how ridiculous his job was. Have you ever spoken to Pat Sajak?\t\n\n\tEvery day. No — honestly, that’s a good example, because I wouldn’t want Pat Sajak to be like, “Why is he picking on me?” That’s where it’s imperfect. I tried to set it up where he seems like a loving guy. But the point of that joke is he was making $17 million per year — for playing hangman! The meat of that joke is more a commentary on how our priorities in our society are all over the place. Pat Sajak was compensated because people had an affinity for him. He was efficient, he was likable, he was charming. But maybe a teacher should make more than him!\n\t\n\t\tI imagine that can be an awkward thing, though, when you joke about somebody and then run into them.\t\n\n\tI have friends who are comedians who do that a lot, and it can be awkward. I typically don’t do that. Anything I say — particularly about my children, even if it’s hyperbole — is something I would say to them. I have a joke where I talk about being grateful that people come to my shows because it lets me afford to raise five kids, but now I realize my final task is to leave them with nothing. I say a version of that to my children. I’ll say, “I’m spending all the money,” and they get nervous: “Why would you do that?” And I say, “Because you don’t deserve any of it.” The core idea is that I want them to succeed and be self-sufficient.\n\t\n\t\tMike Birbiglia tells a story about how when he was in college at Georgetown, he cold-called you and invited you to lunch in New York because he wanted to become a comic and pick your brain about the business. What do you remember about him at that time?\t\n\n\tFirst of all, I love Birbiglia, but he’s a lunatic. All comedians are lunatics. He called me and said he wanted to have lunch. And I said, “Look, I don’t know what I can tell you.” But he said, “I’ll buy you lunch.” So I’m like, “All right.” Granted, I’m a 30-year-old guy. He’s 19. Obviously I should have bought him lunch. Anyway, he came up, and I slept through the time we were supposed to meet and showed up late.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s weird because my daughter and my son both want to go into the entertainment industry, and you want to provide insight and guidance, but the reality is there’s no easy answer. We all scroll through these clips of “the perfect piece of advice,” but it’s so fluid.\n\t\n\t\tHe said the advice you gave him was: “Don’t move to New York until you’re really good.” Would you give the same advice to a young comic today?\t\n\n\tI don’t know if it applies today, but I do think that was good advice. You’re only allowed to be new once, meaning new in New York City. People carry their first impression of you for a while. New York was such an important hub for stand-up. It still is, but there are so many different clubs and shows, and so you could be in New York and do a lot of shows and not arrive at the Comedy Cellar until you’re ready.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJason Alpert-Wisnia\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGenerally, you are not a political comedian. But last year, you played Tim Walz on “SNL” and hosted the Al Smith Dinner, which is a bipartisan campaign event. Was being thrust into the political discourse an uncomfortable experience for you?\t\n\n\tOh, absolutely. I’ve always liked the fact that at my shows, a lesbian couple could sit next to a Mormon family and enjoy the stand-up I’m doing. But I do find politics fascinating. We live in an age where you can’t really articulate anything [without it being misconstrued]. My best friend from childhood was furious that I did the Al Smith Dinner. He said, “I can’t believe you didn’t destroy Trump.” And I’m like, “I know it’s not going to change anything.” And the task was to attack both sides — in a setting where you’re surrounded by billionaires.\n\n\tThe Tim Walz thing, I was within the environment of “SNL,” and there’s a cultural interpretation of every sketch. I intellectually know this: No one is going to listen to me. At the same time, I want to be able to look my children in the eyes and say I didn’t allow some horrible thing to happen. I also feel comfortable that people know my views. But I don’t know if me being an advocate helps — like with the Mamdani thing, that ended up being very divisive.\n\t\n\t\tYou’re talking about the Sarah Sherman bit on “SNL”?\t\n\n\tNo, just comedians supporting the mayor. I remember seeing Stavvy [Stavros Halkias] and all these guys [supporting Zohran Mamdani], and I’m like, “I don’t know if that’s helping him.” Maybe I’m being naive.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWell, we’re in an interesting time where comedy is at the forefront of politics. You have guys like Andrew Schulz and Theo Von interviewing politicians on their podcasts. You say no one is listening to you, but maybe people are!\t\n\n\tPeople are coming to a show to have a break from some of this drama. That’s not to say there aren’t great comedians who talk about social commentary — the spirit of George Carlin is very important. I remember when Trump was first elected, and my opening act had some political jokes. During 2016 and 2017, the audience would kind of look at the ceiling. The jokes were well-constructed, and they weren’t on one side or the other, but it was just too much.\n\n\tThere are great comedians who participate in that conversation, but people are already getting 24-hour news, and everything is clipped and [proliferated] everywhere. Not only is the material not evergreen — it’s so topical that it lasts half a day. People are looking for a break from that. They’re not ignoring the serious issues, but they’re going, “At least I can go see Jim Gaffigan and hear him complain about being a parent.” That’s not to say he doesn’t care about someone being tackled in the streets; it just means maybe people want a break from that.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve done 11 stand-up specials. How has the press tour evolved over time?\t\n\n\tThere’s still the power of the late-night shows. Some of that is the prestige, but a lot of it is the clips that come out of those appearances, whether you’re on “The Tonight Show” or “Kimmel.” But obviously, the power of podcasts is significant. You end up getting very strategic about how you place these things. \n\n\tEven the outlet for a comedy special is always moving. I had two specials on Comedy Central, then I did one on my website. Then I did a couple on Netflix, a couple on Amazon, one on Hulu. It’s always moving. Is Apple going to get into the business? Is Ellison going to buy HBO and then they’re going to try to compete with Netflix? It’s constantly changing, so you have to guess ahead. In some ways, the powerhouse now might be YouTube. That doesn’t take anything away from how important Netflix is, but comedians have become so successful by posting their specials on YouTube that it can actually allow them to go to Netflix.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBesides eyeballs and money, what are the metrics you weigh when choosing which distributor to partner with?\t\n\n\tI see a special as harvesting crops. You always want to be expanding your audience. If I’m going to Baltimore or Denver every two years, I don’t expect that the people who enjoy my stand-up are coming every two years. That’s not realistic. Some of them are busy. Some don’t have the disposable income. You always want to be expanding the audience that enjoys your comedy. So, when I first went to Amazon, I knew they had a reach that, at that time, Netflix didn’t. With Hulu, I knew there were viewers who consumed a ton of stuff there, so why not spread the wealth? It’s easier for me to do that than someone like Dave Chappelle, who’s getting a huge check. He doesn’t have to factor in, “Maybe I can get more people.”\n\t\n\t\tWhat excites you about the future?\t\n\n\tIt’s an exciting time for creative people. I know things are scary, but I think that translates to a certain independence. Creative people who are self-starters are going to be fine.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, the duo behind “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” and the screenplay for “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” are enlisting in Starfleet. They’ve been hired to write, produce and direct a new “Star Trek” film that will seek to revitalize the franchise after it has languished for nearly a decade without a big screen adventure.\n\n\tHowever, as Variety previously reported, the new film will not be a continuation of the J.J. Abrams-led reboot of the series and won’t feature Chris Pine or any of the actors from those movies (Pine starred in Goldstein and Daley’s “D&D” film). In fact, while plot details are being kept under wraps, this project is not connected to any previous or current television series, movie, or prior movie development projects. So you’re out of luck Jean-Luc Picard and Kathryn Janeway!\n\t\n\n\tSince “Star Trek Beyond” opened in 2016, the road to mounting a new film in the franchise has been bumpier than a Klingon’s forehead. Chris Hemsworth almost returned as the (seemingly deceased) father of Capt. Kirk from 2009’s “Star Trek.” Quentin Tarantino almost directed a “Star Trek” movie set in a world of 1930s gangsters. Noah Hawley and Matt Shakman each got so close to directing a “Star Trek” movie that sets were being built, but neither project came to fruition, and both filmmakers moved onto other franchises, Hawley with FX’s “Alien: Earth” and Shakman with Marvel’s “The Fantastic Four: First Steps.”\n\n\n\tIn 2024, Variety reported that Steve Yockey (“The Flight Attendant”) was writing a draft for the “final chapter” “Trek” movie starring the cast led by Pine, Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldaña. And Toby Haynes (“Andor”) had been tapped to direct a “Star Trek” origin story written by Seth Grahame-Smith (“Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter”). But now both productions appear to be stranded in deep space with life support failing.\n\t\n\n\tGetting a new “Star Trek” out of dry-dock has been a priority for Paramount since David Ellison’s Skydance took control of the company in August, because the series is one of the most enduring properties in the studio’s library. Daley and Jonathan Goldstein are known to Ellison and company, having recently written, directed, and produced the Skydance film “Mayday” starring Ryan Reynolds and Kenneth Branagh, which they produced through their GoldDay banner. It will premiere on Apple TV+.\n\n\tDaley and Goldstein previously helmed New Line’s comedy “Game Night,” and wrote and directed the studio’s “Vacation” reboot. The duo’s additional writing credits include “Horrible Bosses” and “Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2.” \n\n\tGoldstein and Daley are represented by CAA, Fourth Wall Management, and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren, Richman, Rush, Kaller, Gellman, Meigs & Fox.\n",

    "body": "\n\tValve, the maker of the popular Steam Deck handheld PC gaming console, is launching new video-game hardware, Steam Machine, in 2026.\n\n\tThe Steam Machine, a 6-inch cube gaming console meant for stationary play vs. the portable Steam Deck option, will debut next year along with the Steam Controller and VR headset Steam Frame. \n\n\t“With over six times the horsepower of Steam Deck, Steam Machine has the power to play your whole Steam library, including your favorite AAA titles,” Valve says. “Just sign with your Steam account and your entire library is there.”\n\t\n\n\tPer Valve, all three devices “are optimized for Steam and designed for players to get even more out of their Steam library.”\n\n\n\tPricing has not yet been revealed for the new devices, which are now available for wishlisting on Steam.\n\n\tWatch Valve’s announcement of the new Steam Machine hardware and accessories below.\n\n\n\n\n\tSee more gaming news from this week in the roundup below.\n\t\n\t\tNEW RELEASES\t\n\n\tMicrosoft’s Activision and Treyarch debuted the Milo Ventimiglia-led “Call of Duty: Black Ops 7” Friday.\n\n\tNew details were also revealed about the game’s co-op campaign “Endgame,” which takes place after the conclusion of the first 11 missions. \n\n\tPer Xbox, “Endgame is the culmination of the story, where the world fully opens up for 1-32 players in squads of up to four. Working together on Avalon across a variety of missions, players will wield personalized abilities and face unexpected challenges, putting everything they’ve mastered throughout the story to the test.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t*\n\n\tFirst-person sci-fi adventure and immersive sim “Ambrosia Sky” debuted with “Act One” of the video game Monday across PC via Steam and Epic Games Store. Acts Two and Three of the game will launch in 2026.\n\n\tPer developer Soft Rains, “In ‘Ambrosia Sky,’ players assume the role of Dalia, a field scientist belonging to an enigmatic order in pursuit of human immortality. Dispatched to a farming colony on Saturn’s outer rings, a place she once called home, she finds it abandoned and overrun by hostile fungi. Those she knew are now dead, missing, or perhaps complicit. It’s up to Dalia to cleanse the contamination, discover the truth, and lay the dead to rest.”\n\n\tIn the first act, “Ambrosia Sky” “thrusts you into a mind-bending world of death, decay, and what comes after. Armed with a chemical sprayer and grappling hook, you’ll face unpredictable alien growths across the colony.”\n\n\tWatch the launch trailer for “Ambrosia Sky” below.\n\n\n\n\n\t*\n\n\t“Winter Burrow” has officially launched. The game is available on Steam, Game Pass, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\n\n\t“Winter Burrow” follows a big city mouse as it returns home to fix up their childhood burrow. The game allows players to explore, gather resources, knit sweaters, bake pies, make crafts, and meet the locals back home.\n\n\tThe game is developed by Pine Creek Games and published by Noodlecake. \n\n\n\n\n\t*\n\n\t“Horizon Steel Frontiers,” a new MMORPG was unveiled at G-Star 2025. In addition, NCSOFT has launched the official “Horizon Steel Frontiers” website, featuring the debut trailer and exclusive developer interviews.\n\n\tThe game will build on “Horizon’s” hunting-action gameplay while adding new advanced MMORPG systems, such as customizable combat and extensive player freedom. \n\n\tWatch the trailer below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRELEASE DATES\t\n\n\tProbablyMonsters announced an enhanced version of its action rogue-like “Storm Lancers” will launch Dec. 9 on Nintendo Switch and for PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. \n\n\tPer the video game developers, “This version of ‘Storm Lancers’ will have HDR support, run at a smooth 60 frames-per-second and allows players to group up online through Nintendo GameShare and Steam Remote Play Together.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCOLLABORATIONS\t\n\n\tRiot Games has released a music video for the “Valorant” Game Changers Championship 2025. Titled “Go Off,” the music video features a reimagined version of “M.I.A.” by KATSEYE, which is this year’s championship anthem. It is available across streaming platforms.\n\n\tThe music video tells the story of the women in “Valorant” and the women who play it, celebrating the connection and community that they foster through the game. \n\n\tThe “Valorant” Game Changers Championship 2025 will take place Nov. 28-30 at at Riot’s LoL Park in Seoul.\n\t\n\t\tMONETIZATION\t\n\n\tFortnite developers now have the ability to make in-island transactions with new tools from Epic. They will soon be able to publish games in-island and sell items directly from their islands using V-Bucks. These transactions are part of the Unreal Editor for Fortnite Creator Ecosystem Update and offer developers monetization opportunities beyond engagement payouts.\n\n\tSee the full list of items that developers are authorized to sell, how to join in the monetization and the updated developer guidelines on the Fortnite website. \n\n\t*\n\n\tRoblox has made its rewarded video ads product available to “all ads-eligible creators” on the website. The goal with this development is “providing our developers with a more predictable, easy-to-implement solution to increase their earnings and gain more control over ad revenue,” according to Roblox.\n\n\tAdditionally, Roblox has launched a self-serve option for its License Manager tool, which allows any eligible IP holder—from major studios to brands with registered IP — to offer their IP for use on the gaming platform, and gives any eligible creator the chance to apply to adapt an experience to use it. \n\n\tAccording to Roblox, since the launch of the License Manager with founding partners Lionsgate, Netflix, Sega, and Kodansha in July, creators have submitted over 1,500 license requests from the selection of available IP.\n\n\t“We launched the licensing platform to fundamentally change how IP holders and creators collaborate across the platform,” said Greg Hartrell, Senior Product Director, Creator Content Ecosystem in a blog post. “This new system dramatically streamlines a historically complex IP licensing process, which previously involved lengthy negotiations and restricted partnerships to a select group of studios.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tGAME UPDATES/DLC\t\n\n\tARC Raiders has introduced its first major update, launching on Nov. 13. \n\n\tThe update will introduce Stella Montis, a new region north of the Rust Belt. The debut of the Breaking New Ground community unlock event, where players can team up and unite to help restore tunnels inside Stella Montis and earn rewards.\n\n\tNew ARC enemies such as Matriarch and Shredder, the Aphelion Rifle, and Stella Montis-themed questlines will be added onto the gameplay. The new update will lead towards the next update titled Cold Snap, set to arrive in December. \n\n\n\n\n\t*\n\n\t“Digimon Story: Time Stranger” is receiving its first DLC this winter in the form of “Additional Digimon & Episode Pack 1: Alternate Dimension.” The addition includes new Digivolution routes for Mega Digimon and a special questline in the RPG.\n\n\tThe game is available on PlayStation5, Xbox Series XS and PC via Steam. Players need the base game to add the new DLC. It is available for the game’s Deluxe and ultimate editions as well.\n\n\tWatch the DLC announcement trailer here:\n\n\n\n\n\t*\n\n\t“Elden Ring Nightreign” is launching “The Forsaken Hallows” DLC on Dec. 4. The DLC introduces three new bosses, two new Nightfarers and a new shifting Earth feature that changes the maps and provides new geography to explore in the multiplayer co-op survival game.\n\n\tThe game is available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series XS and PC via Steam. Players with the Deluxe or Collectors editions of the game will automatically receive the DLC update when it launches and other players can purchase it separately.\n\n\tWatch the DLC reveal trailer here:\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTESTING\t\n\n\tFans can now access “World of Warcraft: Midnight” as beta testing has begun. The beta testing is now live in the test client, allowing players to test out new features.\n\n\tThose invited will include anyone who pre-purchased the Midnight Epic Edition, alongside fans who signed up from the opt-in page of the Midnight website. Players who purchase or who upgrade to the Epic Edition of Midnight during the beta will also gain immediate access. \n\t\n\n\tFans can also experience upcoming features like the level-up quest campaigns in the zones, exploring the newly revamped Eversong Woods and Silvermoon City player hub. \n\t\n\t\tTRAILERS\t\n\n\tA new trailer has launched for the Nintendo Switch 2 edition of “Metroid Prime 4: Beyond,” which releases for the consol as well as the Nintendo Switch 1 on Dec. 4.\n\n\tPlayers take on the role of bounty hunter Samus Aran, defending the Galactic Federation across various worlds in this sci-fi first-person shooter. The release concurs with the availability of a new Sylux amiibo figure in addition to the Samus figures available now.\n\n\t The game is available to preorder on Nintendo eShop and in select retailers.\n\n\tWatch the trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tRegina Hall defies expectations.\n\n\tShe reinvents herself every few years, prompting audiences to reconsider their perceptions of her. From the slapstick absurdity of “Scary Movie” to the layered nuance of the indie gem “Support the Girls,” Regina Hall has navigated Hollywood’s narrow categorization with grace, range, and an unshakable instinct for truth. Now, with Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” Hall delivers what may be her most profound performance yet—a portrayal that carries the accumulated weight of loss, resilience, and hard-won wisdom.\n\t\n\n\tAs Deandra, a quiet member of the militia group French 75, Hall doesn’t speak much. However, what she conveys physically, emotionally, and through her sheer presence is nothing short of extraordinary. “There was a lot of talk with Paul [Thomas Anderson] about Deandra — who she is, what she felt, what she’d been through,” Hall tells the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast. “I think Deandra is kind of a lens into the stakes of what is happening, what transpired, what went wrong. There’s a weight that Deandra carries, and the only way you know — if you aren’t going to be talking about it — is you usually feel or see someone’s weight.”\n\n\n\tAnderson, known for guiding actors into raw, unguarded territory, shoots much of the film in close-up, leaving no place to hide. Hall’s restraint becomes a force of gravity. “Paul shoots a lot of close-ups in this film,” she explains. “There is a lot to convey in those moments and in those seconds, without it necessarily having to be spoken—that kind of nonverbal use of expression that Deandra uses.”\n\t\n\n\tThe final shot, with Hall’s eyes glistening, and her face a terrain of conflicted emotion, has become the anchor of the film. It’s a reminder that certain actors embody their characters. And that some performances don’t fade when the credits roll.\n\n\tOscar buzz is building around Hall’s work, positioning her as a leading contender for best supporting actress, which would mark her first Academy Award nomination. It feels long overdue. From the pitch-perfect comedic chaos of “Girls Trip” to the quiet devastation of “Master,” Hall has consistently delivered, often in roles that demand an interiority rarely recognized by mainstream accolades. “It’d be great. It’d be hard,” she admits. “It’s an exciting thing. I remember the first time I got nominated for a Gotham and then a Spirit — I’ve lost all three times. It was fun to get nominated, and you really do feel like it’s an honor… until you lose. Then you’re like, damn, I actually did want to win.”\n\n\tHall’s journey to this moment has been shaped by personal grief, the kind that doesn’t fade but lingers beneath the surface, subtly and profoundly shading her work. She lost her mother in 2021. “Those things add layers to a grief that you carry, and to what loss is, and to what life is and the meaning of life,” she reflects. “You lose enough where you understand what there is to lose. I guess I walk with that sense of grief, so it probably shows. My eyes probably have changed.”\n\n\t“One Battle After Another” represents an artistic breakthrough and a personal reckoning for Hall —  in a role that allows her to channel years of experience into something indelible. In an industry that often confines its actors, especially women and especially Black women, Hall continues to carve a path defined by risk, depth and courage.\n\n\tOn this episode of the award-winning Variety Awards Circuit Podcast, Hall discusses her role in Anderson’s film, her return as Brenda in “Scary Movie 6”, and what’s next for one of Hollywood’s most underestimated talents. \n\n\tAlso on this episode, Chloe Zhao, the writer and director of the emotional drama “Hamnet.” Additionally, the Awards Circuit Roundtable discusses the main contenders for Netflix, the winners of regional festivals, and the dark horses in the Oscar race. Listen below!\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWarner Bros.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRead excerpts from her interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\t\n\t\tPaul Thomas Anderson is famous for pushing actors into vulnerable places. What was your process like for developing Deandra?\t\n\n\tThere was a lot of talk with Paul about Deandra, who she is, what she felt, what she’d been through. I think Deandra is kind of a lens into the stakes of what is happening, what transpired, and what went wrong. It was the idea that you really have to trust Deandra, her commitment to the French 75, and then that’s her commitment, ultimately, to Willa.\n\n\tThere’s a weight that I think Deandra carries. The only way you know — if you aren’t going to be talking about it — is you usually feel or see someone’s weight. Seeing how Paul shoots — he shoots a lot of close-ups in this film. Every film he does is so different, but in this film, there is a lot to convey in those moments and in those seconds, without it necessarily having to be spoken — that kind of nonverbal use of expression that Deandra uses.\n\t\n\t\tYour co-star, Chase Infiniti, is a revelation in the film. What was it like working with her in her first major role?\t\n\n\tChase is great. That started from the moment she came in for the audition. She was the last person we read with that day, after seeing several other people who were really good. She came in steady, and she had this truly special quality about her — a quiet resilience, a strength she carried. Then she tested, and she was great.\n\n\tThere’s also this part of her that still maintains such innocence, which you need for Willa — to want to protect her, to think, “People are going through a lot to get this girl.” But at the same time, you have to show that she’s her mother’s child. As a person, Chase is a wonderful human being. The same way you want her to win as Willa, you want to see her shine.\n\n\tIt’s her first film. And the fact that she was able to, despite whatever nervousness or fear she may have had, steady herself and deliver such an incredible performance — it was remarkable. What I love most about her is that she’s funny, smart, and caring. The things she’s interested in are just sweet. There’s a goodness to her, and I think that resonates.\n\t\n\t\tLooking back at your career, you seem to reinvent yourself every few years. Is that intentional, or does it just happen organically?\t\n\n\tInitially, you’re just saying yes to work. I think “The Best Man” was one kind of role, and so was “Love & Basketball.” With “Scary Movie” — because no one really knew me at that point — it became so big that people were like, “Oh, she’s a comedian.”\n\t\n\n\tBut I didn’t want to be known just as a comedian. I wasn’t a comedian at all—I’d never studied comedy or done stand-up. Many people thought I had. After “Scary Movie,” I returned to auditioning for the types of roles I typically pursued. You’re still auditioning, still trying to work. But I made a conscious decision. I thought, “I want to be able to do something else.”\n\n\tIt wasn’t completely random. When you start saying no to certain things, you do get offered the same kinds of roles again and again. You have to say, “No, I want to hold out for something else,” so you don’t get stuck. But at the same time, you also think, “I need to work.” You’re living in both realities—trying to pay the bills while still hoping to make thoughtful choices.\n\t\n\t\tAfter “Scary Movie,” did you feel misunderstood by the industry?\t\n\n\tDefinitely, after “Scary Movie,” people saw me as someone who only does broad comedy. But then, when I didn’t do broad comedy for a while, I remember people asking my agents, “Well, does she even do comedy?”\n\n\tI think a lot of people haven’t seen the breadth of the work. It’s just about what they’ve seen. That happened again after “Girls Trip.” It was strange — suddenly they were asking if I could do comedy, because I was playing the straight role. Which is funny, because I was the straight one in “Think Like a Man,” but definitely not in “About Last Night.” It all comes down to visibility. If the work isn’t part of the mainstream conversation, people don’t know it exists.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve spoken before about how your mother’s faith grounded you. Did that spiritual core help you navigate the emotional toll of this role?\t\n\n\tAbsolutely for sure. I lost my mom during “Master.” Those things add layers to the grief you carry, to what loss is, to what life is, and to the meaning of life.\n\n\tThere’s a matter-of-factness to nature and life. No one is exempt from loss, pain, heartbreak, or struggle. It may come in different ways or amounts, and maybe there are layers added depending on how things unfold and what closure you get — but it doesn’t take away from what it is.\n\n\tIn life, you learn more and lose more. You gain, and you lose. There’s a constant learning—of yourself and of others. You lose enough, and you begin to understand what there is to lose. You start to realize the fragility of everything. I walk with that sense of grief, so it probably shows. My eyes have probably changed.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSocial media exploded when it was announced you’d be returning as Brenda in “Scary Movie 6.” What made you say yes?\t\n\n\tI read the script — and it was really funny. I knew what they were intending to do. I always think a work of art is in flux until it’s done and in someone’s hands — you just never know. But the original cast coming back was exciting. Having the Wayans involved again, and Anna Faris too — Brenda can’t live without Cindy. And she’s no better a friend to Cindy this time than she was before, even though they’re still best friends.\n\n\tI think the nostalgia and timing just made it feel right. It was a good time to do something so broad and fun. I read the script and thought, “This is funny.” And I think something is refreshing about doing something a little bit irreverent right now.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve hosted the Oscars before, but what would it mean to you to attend the ceremony as an Oscar nominee?\t\n\n\tIt’d be great. It’d be hard [laughs]. My assistant is probably going to hear about it the most. It’s an exciting thing. I remember being incredibly excited the first time I was nominated for a Gotham Award and then a Spirit Award. I’ve lost all three times. It was a lot of fun to be nominated, and you really do feel like it’s an honor — until you lose. Then you’re like, “Damn, I actually did want to win.” That competitive nature kicks in.\n\n\tWhen “Scary Movie” first came out, it got panned by critics — even though people loved it. At the time, comedies like that weren’t taken seriously. With “Support the Girls,” it was different. Critics really loved the work, and that was actually wonderful. People always say, “I don’t care what critics think,” but when they say nice things? It feels good.\n\t\n\t\tWhat’s next for you after “One Battle After Another?”\t\n\n\t“Scary Movie 6,” which we’re still shooting — I’m going back to work tomorrow. We started on October 1. And then “Judgment Day,” which I did with Will Ferrell. That was great. And then SpongeBob — it was my first animated film. And then “Three Bags Full,” a sheep detective story.\n\n\tAnd of course, RH Negative, my production company — we’re really excited about that. We have several projects that we’re working on and plan to complete. We’re looking forward to developing and producing more. Next year, we want something out there — or at least green-lit. A lot is coming down the pipeline.\n\t\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

    "body": "\n\tAs revealed in the show’s midseason trailer unveiled at BravoCon on Friday, Karen Huger — the once and perhaps future star of “The Real Housewives of Potomac” — has done a sitdown interview with Andy Cohen, the executive producer of “The Real Housewives” franchise. The trailer played during the show’s panel, “Potomac Takes Vegas,” which featured its Season 10 cast (without Huger, though she is at the fan convention this weekend). Cohen’s interview with Huger will air during the season finale. \n\t\n\n\tHuger was released from prison on Sept. 2, after having served six months. She was arrested in March 2024 in Potomac, Maryland for driving under the influence and driving while impaired, among other charges. She’d had three previous alcohol-related driving offenses in the past. During the entirety of Season 9 of “The Real Housewives of Potomac,” she proclaimed her innocence, and maintained she would be exonerated. Huger was convicted on all charges at trial in December 2024, and entered a treatment facility. She did not attend the Season 9 reunion, which was taped after her conviction, and aired in February of this year, but did record a video message saying, “No, I’m not an alcoholic, let’s be clear.”\n\n\n\tHuger appears to take a different path in the interview with Cohen. At the end of the trailer, a voice calls out, “Karen!” and a soft-spoken, unseen Huger says, “Hello?” Off camera, she then says, “I’m good, thank you.” Then, Huger’s husband, Ray, greets Cohen at the door, seeming exuberant, and after he sits down, Cohen says, “Here we are — you are a free woman.” Huger, looking cozy in a beige sweater, looks at him and says, “It’s time to talk about my addiction.”\n\t\n\n\tHuger was sentenced to two years in prison with one year suspended and five years of probation on Feb. 26. She immediately was taken into custody, and her early release date was announced in August.\n\n\tShe’s not the only “RHOP” cast member dealing with legal issues. The trailer also showed that the show restarted, also for the finale, to shed light on the current plight of Wendy and Eddie Osefo, whose arrest on multiiple fraud charges in October shocked the Bravosphere. \n\n\t“We’ve gone through a lot in our lives together,” Eddie Osefo says to Wendy. “But this takes the cake.” She replies, “How do you think this is gonna affect our marriage?” The two then embrace one another.\n\n\tWendy Osefo appeared on the BravoCon panel, and said she can’t comment on the specifics of the allegations.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThirty years after its release on Nov 13, 1995, “GoldenEye” remains one of the most important films in the James Bond franchise. Much like today, the series stood at a crossroads ahead of “GoldenEye”— producers were turning over, a new Bond was being cast and the world around the super spy was moving in a direction that threatened to leave his particular brand of hedonistic heroism in the past.\n\n\tThe situation forced the creatives behind the franchise to adapt, to make critical decisions about what the character looked like in the modern world. They needed to determine what needed updating and what needed to remain the same and, most imperatively, who, both in front of and behind the camera, could execute on the gargantuan task of launching Bond back into audiences’ minds and hearts.  \n\t\n\n\tTHE STATE OF BOND CIRCA 1990\n\n\n\tThe early 1990s was a time of turbulence for the Bond movies. Shortly after the lukewarm critical and commercial performance of Timothy Dalton’s sophomore outing as the character in 1989’s “License to Kill,” businessman Giancarlo Parretti bought Bond distributor MGM, putting the franchise on hold until his ownership ended in a wave of lawsuits in 1991.\n\n\t“We had been in an extended lawsuit with MGM which was finally settled when the new management team of Alan Ladd Jr. and Jay Kanter took over,” says “GoldenEye” producer Michael G. Wilson of Eon Productions. By the time the opportunity for more James Bond movies came about, though, some questioned whether the franchise was even worth reviving.\n\n\t“MGM hired a national research group to do a study to see where Bond fit into moviegoing culture,” reflects Jeff Kleeman, the executive vice president of MGM-United Artists at the time. “The study came back and it reported that pretty much every teenage boy in American had either never heard of James Bond or said, ‘Yeah, that’s the guy my dad likes.’”\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, there were shifts within the offices of Eon, where longtime Bond producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli was handing off the franchise’s reins to his daughter and step-son, Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. “Cubby couldn’t be part of this film,” says Bond historian John Cork, who consulted on the franchise during the period. “His health was not going to allow it. He was in meetings when I was there, but not all the time. His input and wisdom was always appreciated, but he was very hands off.” While Barbara Broccoli and Wilson had been involved in the franchise for years, this was their first opportunity to properly take up their father’s mantle. They were big shoes to fill.\n\n\tMeanwhile, the world itself had changed around Bond. Months after “License to Kill” was released, the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. James Bond was a Cold War hero, so now that the conflict was over, the creative team had to figure out Bond’s purpose in the new global political climate.  \n\n\tMGM’s new president Frank Mancuso Sr. was rightfully skeptical, but Broccoli, Wilson, Kleeman and fellow United Artists colleague John Calley were determined to figure out a story that worked.\n\n\tIn the years since “License to Kill,” a few treatments and drafts of a new Bond film had been considered. One was from writer Michael France. “When John Calley and I got to United Artists, the Michael France draft already existed,” says Kleeman. “Michael and Barbara were pretty fond of the France draft. Calley and I were not especially fond of it, and when we said we wanted to make another Bond movie, we felt the script needed a lot of work and we wanted to bring in new writers.”\n\n\tDRAFTING THE RIGHT DIRECTOR\n\n\tAs they searched for new writers to polish the script, they also had to find a director. “We made a very strong case to Frank Mancuso to let us make the film,” Kleeman says. “He eventually said, ‘OK, I’ll give you $49 million all-in to make a Bond movie, but no more.’ So part of the calculus for who was going to direct this movie was, could we find somebody who we thought was a really strong, interesting director, but would also really stretch that $49 million as far as it could possibly go.”\n\t\n\n\tNew Zealand-born director Martin Campbell had a limited filmography at the time. Though he had been directing since the 1970s, only his three latest features had reached wide audiences, and even then, they were far from blockbusters. The team, however, was impressed with his work on television and his apparent resourcefulness in telling action-adventure stories.\n\n\t“I had just finished shooting a movie in Australia and I came back to L.A.,” recalls Campbell. “I got a call from John Calley to come visit and he said ‘How would you like to direct the Bond film?’ And so I said, ‘Sure, why not.’ It was as simple as that.”\n\n\tFINDING THE NEXT 007\n\n\tThe new Bond film had its director, but the question that loomed largest was who would play Bond. “Barbara and Michael wanted to bring Timothy back, and we thought Timothy was a great person and a great actor, but we didn’t want this to feel like a continuation of the Dalton Bond movies,” says Kleeman. “We explored Mel Gibson. We explored Liam Neeson. We explored Ralph Fiennes.”\n\n\tHowever, Kleeman and Callie were keen on Pierce Brosnan, a dashing young Irish actor who had auditioned for the part alongside Dalton during the franchise’s last transition. He got the role, but had to drop out when his TV show, “Remington Steele” was unexpectedly renewed. He starred in the series throughout the 1980s, and by the early ’90s, he was playing side-characters in movies like “Mrs. Doubtfire” and “Love Affair.” Despite his lack of leading man pedigree, he had the charm, look and sophistication to become the next Bond.\n\n\tAs confident as Kleeman and Calley were that Brosnan was their guy, they still had to convince Broccoli and Wilson. “We ended up having a meeting with Barbara and Michael and Cubby, because Cubby was still involved at this point. Barbara and Michael made their case for Timothy and we made our case for Pierce,” says Kleeman. “And there was silence and then Cubby gently tapped his walking stick on the floor. We all turned to him and he said ‘Let’s make it with Pierce.’ And that was that.”\n\n\tCampbell felt more confident from the beginning. “Everybody had to agree on who should play Bond, but to be honest, I think Pierce was always going to get it,” he says. “We went around the world to different places for other potential Bonds, but really we knew it was going to be him.”\n\t\n\n\tAgreeing on who would slip into Bond’s tux was a relief, but the expanding team was far from the finish line. As Keene explains, “We had a package that was not that exciting to MGM. We had a TV actor who is now playing supporting roles in movies as our James Bond. We had a director who had directed three feature films, all of which flopped. We had a script that even we admit still needed a lot of work. We had one ailing veteran producer in Cubby and two essentially neophyte producers in Barbara and Michael. And we had IP that the research said was very old and rickety and of no interest to the contemporary movie audience.”\n\n\tWRITERS, WRITERS, WRITERS\n\n\tWhile the producers had faith in Brosnan and Campbell, generating interest in the IP depended on finding a compelling story. The Michael France script still needed work, so they hired English screenwriter Jeffrey Caine to do a rewrite. Like Campbell, Caine had a modest list of credits at the time, having only written for television, but Broccoli trusted him from their past work together.   \n\n\t“Michael France turned in his second draft of the film that would become ‘GoldenEye’ and I think [Barbara] realized that she needed to change writers. She wasn’t happy at all, so she hired me and I did a page-one rewrite,” says Caine. “Barbara gave me a free hand and I did a total rewrite, started it where it should have started and put it into three acts.”\n\n\t“Everybody seemed happy with the result,” Caine continues. “Except at some point they brought in another writer to do things that I could have done, but nobody asked me to do it. You know how it goes in this industry.”\n\n\t“We worked with Jeffrey for quite a bit,” reflects Campbell, “And then Kevin Wade came in. Wade wrote ‘Working Girl’ for Mike Nichols and we had him for a month. I think that’s all we could afford. We had literally thirty days with Kevin Wade, who kicked the structure into where it should be. I mean, he really put the architecture of the script together.”\n\n\tAfter Wade’s thirty days, the team hired Bruce Feirstein, author of the bestselling satire book, “Real Men Don’t Eat Quiche,” to come punch up some of Bond’s dialogue. “I was writing for Vanity Fair and the editorial page of the New York Times,” says Feirstein, “And one afternoon Barbara called and said, ‘How would you like to come to London and write a couple of jokes for Bond?’ So then, I went and I met Michael for the first time and saw Martin.”\n\t\n\n\tIt ended up being more than just a few jokes. “I read the script and thought that Caine’s work was fantastic,” he remembers. “It was great and I loved the script, but I thought it needed a point of reference. We were six years out from the last Bond and my idea was: ‘The world had changed, but Bond hadn’t’”\n\n\tCorroborating this mantra, Cork, who MGM hired to develop pitches for future Bond films, wrote up a document for the studio called “Bond in the Nineties.” “I tend to refer to it as kind of a character Bible,” he said, “I talked about a return to the glamour and the sexiness of Bond” through a rigorous study of the character from Ian Fleming’s original novels to the latest movies.\n\n\tArmed with these guiding principles, Feirstein worked on a rewrite that gave shape to Bond within the story. That story involved contemporary technology, where the threats are rogue post-Soviet soldiers who hijack a satellite weapon capable of wiping out all communication in the Western world. At some point, Wilson suggested that the satellite be called “GoldenEye,” after the name of Ian Fleming’s Jamaican estate where he wrote the Bond books.\n\n\tDespite the story’s modern elements, it was imperative that Bond retain his quintessential elements. He would still be smooth and sophisticated. He would still sleep with lots of women, sip vodka martinis and kill bad guys, and the world around him may react a little differently to the roguish spy, but he would still save that world in the end.\n\n\tASSEMBLING THE ENSEMBLE\n\n\tThe Brosnan Bond was figured out, but as the script received its final touches, the rest of the characters were still being cast. Bond is not the only recurring archetype in the franchise, and the “GoldenEye” script included new Bond villains and Bond girls that fit into the modern era.\n\n\tPivotally, the script’s main antagonist was Alec Trevelyan— a.k.a. 006, who turns against MI6 out of vengeance for his parents’ death, which was caused by Britain’s neglect of the Soviet Union a generation ago. “What we really wanted was an adversary for Pierce who felt physically, intellectually equal to him. We had this concept of 006 versus 007, so in some ways we needed someone who could have been James Bond playing the villain,” says Kleeman.\n\t\n\n\tCasting director Debbie McWilliams identified Sean Bean, the Yorkshire-born actor who performed in the Royal Shakespeare Company and was more recently recognized as the titular soldier in the TV series “Sharpe.”\n\n\tTrevelyan was not the only villain in the film, though. They also had to find someone who could play Xenia Onatopp, a beautiful Russian assassin capable of seducing her targets and crushing their heads between her legs. The search for someone who could play the intense villainess was ongoing when Clive Barker brought a young Dutch actress named Famke Janssen to his MGM project, “Lord of Illusions.”\n\n\t“She was great,” says Kleeman. “We liked her so much in ‘Lord of Illusions’ that we put her up for the role in ‘GoldenEye’”\n\n\t“I was asked to come in and audition and I think I was one of the three who was asked to do a screen test with Pierce Brosnan. I will never forget that audition,” recalls Janssen. “I was a struggling actress who had gotten some parts and a lot of rejections, so it was an incredible opportunity and I just went for broke. I had nothing to lose so I just really went big.”\n\n\tBig was exactly what Xenia needed and Janssen’s audacity paid off as she was cast in the part. The rest of the cast was filled in with some new and familiar faces. Samantha Bond was the new Miss Moneypenny, Alan Cumming joined as tech henchman Boris Grishenko, Robbie Coltrane as Russian mafioso Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky, Tchéky Karyo as Defense Minister Dmitri Mishkin, Gottfried John as General Arkady Ourumov, Joe Don Baker as CIA operative Jack Wade and Judi Dench as the newly imagined female M— a gender switch for the character inspired by MI5’s recently appointed first female Director General, Stella Rimington. The only returning cast member from “License to Kill” was Desmond Llewelyn, reprising his long-running role as Q.\n\n\tStill, a pivotal character was yet to be cast. Two weeks away from production, they still hadn’t found the right fit for “GoldenEye”’s Bond girl, Natalya Simonova. They had searched far and wide for someone who could play the smart and beautiful Russian programmer opposite Brosnan’s Bond. “We just couldn’t find her,” recalls Campbell, “I remember sitting with Debbie and I said, ‘You’ve covered every country in Europe.’ She said, ‘Except Sweden,’ so Barbara put her on a plane that night.”\n\t\n\n\tIn Sweden, McWilliams scouted a modeling shoot on the island of Gotland, where she spotted a young actress named Izabella Scorupco, who bore a striking resemblance to the Natalya of Campbell’s storyboards.\n\n\t“I did an audition for Debbie in Gotland. I just thought it was amazing that I was going to be part of the audition. I really didn’t expect anything more.” says Scorupco. “And a week later, I was asked to go to London to meet Martin Campbell. I came in and I read for him. It was only me and him in the room, and I had no idea that, by that time, I already got the part from the previous audition I did in Sweden. Literally, as I was done with my scene, the whole production just storms in and fires up champagne.”\n\n\tThere was due cause for celebration. “GoldenEye” was finally cast, with just two weeks to spare before cameras started rolling.\n\n\tPRODUCTION\n\n\tThe globe-trotting film shot on locations around the world, from the mountains of Switzerland to the jungles of Puerto Rico. “It was probably 115 or 16 days,” says Campbell. “You go to different countries, all of which have to be incorporated into a tight schedule.”\n\n\tIronically, the trickiest location to lock-in may have been the sound stage back in London. The iconic Bond stage at Pinewood studios was booked, so they had to find somewhere else to build their sets.\n\n\t“We had to build a makeshift studio for the production,” recalls Wilson, “Which we did at a former Rolls Royce engine factory in Leavesden outside London, the site that later became Warner Bros Studios Leavesden. It was very challenging building the studio framework at the same time as we were constructing the sets for filming and would not have happened without our production designer, Peter Lamont who had been in the art department of the Bond series since ‘Goldfinger.’”\n\n\tIn addition to Lamont’s production design work, “GoldenEye” also marked the final film of miniature effects artist Derek Meddings. “One of the things that ended with ‘GoldenEye’ was the use of miniatures in special effects,” recalls Kleeman, “Derek did staggering work with miniatures for the satellite station and all sorts of stuff in ‘GoldenEye.’ It’s become a lost art in Hollywood.”\n\t\n\n\tBetween Lamont’s sets and Meddings’ miniatures, “GoldenEye” was committed to practical effects at a time when CGI was accelerating. “We could go CGI or we could go physical effects,” continues Kleeman. “And most of the films were heading in the CGI direction. And so when you see that bungee jump at the beginning of the movie, that was really Martin planting a flag and very intentionally shooting it and doing it in a way where he is saying ‘This is a movie where we have made a choice not to go the CGI route, but to go, in every possible moment, the genuine physical effects route.’”\n\n\tThough the opening scene where Bond bungee jumps from a towering dam into a Russian military force was not actually directed by Martin, but by second unit director Ian Sharpe with stunt coordinator Simon Crane, it was a thrilling introduction to the movie to come— bold, exciting, and visually striking while still remaining relatively grounded.\n\n\t“They won that audience with that opening scene of the dam jump,” says Cork, reflecting on the movie’s premiere at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, “I mean, that audience was just holding their breath during that shot.”\n\n\tEDITING, MARKETING, AND RELEASE\n\n\tBecause of Campbell’s resourcefulness and thorough storyboards, the expansive production ran smoothly and editing was efficient. “I shoot to edit,” explains Campbell. “Plus, Terry Rawlings was the editor, who is terrific.”\n\n\tDuring post, the marketing campaign got underway ahead of the November release. Campbell and the actors did a global press tour, and trailers began to appear in cinemas and on television. “Maybe the unsung hero of bringing Bond back into popular culture was an executive at MGM named Joe Nimziki,” says Kleeman. “Joe was the guy who came up with the idea for, directed and shot the teaser trailer for ‘GoldenEye.’ It was this little bit that had the tag, ‘You Know the Name, You Know the Number’ and it revealed Pierce’s Bond for the first time.” Nimziki would also direct the full-length trailer, which showcased shots from the film and revealed some of the story.\n\n\tA few private screenings were held in Los Angeles, generating buzz, but the film’s big public premiere was in New York City on Nov. 13. “They decided to rent out Radio City Music Hall and they did this big old time premiere,” says Cork. “There was a whole Bond convention the day before in New York City. Radio City Music Hall was packed to the gills and it was just glittering with excitement. It just felt like Bond was back and the world was damn happy about it.”\n\t\n\n\tIndeed, Bond was back. The film was a hit with critics and audiences, grossing over $350 million at the worldwide box office— more than twice of what “License to Kill” grossed six years prior— proving that the franchise had a life ahead of it.\n\n\tLECACY\n\n\t“GoldenEye”’s success gave Eon the ability to continue the franchise at MGM. Brosnan starred in three additional films, as the Bond of the ’90s evolved into the Bond of the aughts. His tenure as the character ended in 2002 with the release of “Die Another Day.” Campbell did not direct another Brosnan film, but returned when Broccoli and Wilson reimagined Bond again in 2006, with Daniel Craig taking up the role in “Casino Royale.”\n\n\t“Everybody who’s played Bond was really good in some way,” says Feirstein. “The scripts and the actors were representative of their time. Connery was the perfect Cold War Bond. Roger Moore reflected the Reagan-era. Tim Dalton, who had far too few films, hit all the right notes for the fall of the Soviet Union, and Daniel Craig was perfect as the post 9/11 Bond.”\n\n\tThe Brosnan films, with “GoldenEye” as their flagship, seems to be the connective tissue between these decades, retaining the cheeky wit of the older Bond films, while elevating them with bigger set pieces, bolder stunts and a more contemporary story.\n\n\tIts legacy looms large, not least of all because of the wildly successful “GoldenEye” video game, which Nintendo released in 1997. “The video game was a massive success,” says Kleeman. “It made it so not only did every teenager once again know who Bond was, but all of the kids who weren’t yet teenagers, who hadn’t heard of the movies, saw their older siblings playing the game with their friends and were excited to become Bond fans”\n\n\tFeirstein remarks, “When I tell young people that I wrote ‘GoldenEye,’ they all ask, ‘The video game or the movie?’ I say, ‘the movie,’ and they’re always disappointed, because this entire generation grew up playing that game.”\n\n\tAccordingly, the first Bond property being released under its new owners at Amazon is not a film, but a video game: “007 First Light,” set to release next year. Amazon bought MGM and the Bond library in 2022, after the release of Daniel Craig’s fifth and final outing as Bond in 2021’s “No Time To Die.” Cubby Broccoli died months after “GoldenEye’”s release, but Barbara and Wilson continued to produce all of the Bond movies throughout Craig’s tenure before Amazon bought out their creative control of the franchise earlier this year.\n\t\n\n\tThe series is yet again facing a transition, not unlike the era leading up to “GoldenEye.” David Heyman and Amy Pascal will produce the next Bond film, with Denis Villeneuve attached to direct. They are all experienced in the art and business of moviemaking, but new to James Bond moviemaking. Likewise, the world has once again changed dramatically since the franchise’s last reinvention in 2006. Just as “GoldenEye” had to figure out who Bond was in the ’90s, the next film must determine who Bond is today, and what kind of world he’s saving.\n",

Tony catches up to Flyy and shoves him with force.

Tony -- who has appeared in \"Battle Camp\" and \"The Mole\" on Netflix -- says he loudly called Flyy and others \"NPCs\" -- Non-Player Characters, a Gen Z insult referring to someone as \"bot.\"\n      \n\n          Flyy got offended and started yelling back, according to Tony. Flyy, Tony says, then claimed to be a gang member who has beaten up \"40 guys\" just like him.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Tony says he dared Flyy to \"make it 41\" -- and that's when things got physical on video. But ... when the cameras were finally turned off, Tony says he and Flyy hugged it out and apologized with no police involvement.\n      \n    \n          BTW, we caught up with Flyy this week after he was detained by authorities for having a mental health episode. TMZ broke the story ... Flyy was given a psychiatric evaluation and released from a hospital after 3 days\n      \n    \n          We interviewed Flyy, who told us he took \"multiple substances like pills\" before he was taken into police custody. Flyy says he's doing just fine now and is on a spiritual journey.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Antonio \"Tony\" Castellanos\n              \n                          \n                Flyysoulja\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Hip Hop\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Viral\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Influencers\n              \n                          \n                Fights & Feuds\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

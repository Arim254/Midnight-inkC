Whether it’s gold-foil “World Champs” tees, trophy-patched caps, fan-favorite jerseys or limited-edition Funko Pops, there’s no limit to stylish merch to celebrate the Hollywood-loved team.\n\n\n\tThe Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series on Saturday night, notching back-to-back championships after a fierce battle against the Toronto Blue Jays that came down to a Game 7 that went 11 innings. The game ended 5-4, making the Dodgers the first Major League Baseball team to win back-to-back championships since the New York Yankees won three in a row from 1998-2000. The Blue Jays had been angling for their first World Series victory since 1993, when they also logged consecutive win as the reigning champs from 1992.\n\n\tFox also hit a home run with their broadcast of the game. The telecast was the most-watched Game 7 in the World Series since 2017, when nearly 28.3 million viewers tuned in for the final showdown between the Dodgers and the Houston Astros. Houston won the game and the tournament. Viewership for Saturday’s telecast on Fox was up 10% over the most recent Game 7, in 2019, when nearly 23.3 million viewers watched the Washington Nationals defeat the Astros.\n\n\n\tBelow, shop the best Dodgers merch to celebrate their World Series win:\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIMITED-EDITION\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWorld Series Champions Pop!

    "body": "\n\tParamount Pictures has named longtime Lionsgate executive Shaun Barber as head of domestic theatrical distribution. \n\n\tIn his new role, he’ll oversee the studio’s North American distribution strategy and operations for all big-screen releases, including this December’s “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants” and upcoming titles like “PAW Patrol: The Dino Movie” and “Aang: The Last Airbender”.\n\n\n\tBarber is taking over for Chris Aronson, the veteran executive who is exiting his role at Paramount on Dec. 1 amid the executive shakeup surrounding the company’s $8 billion merger with Skydance. \n\t\n\n\tBarber, who begins on Dec. 1, will work closely with the studio’s international theatrical distribution chief Mark Viane. Both Barber and Viane will report directly to Josh Goldstine, Paramount’s newly appointed president of global marketing and distribution.\n\n\n\t“Shaun is a deeply respected leader who has spent his career building meaningful partnerships across exhibition and the industry at large,” Goldstine said. “He brings extensive expertise in domestic distribution strategy and will help us strengthen our theatrical business and deliver exceptional experiences for moviegoers.”\n\n\tBarber was most recently at Lionsgate as co-president of worldwide theatrical distribution. During his 18-year tenure at Lionsgate and its subsidiary Summit Entertainment, he worked on blockbuster franchises including “John Wick,” “The Hunger Games” and “Twilight,” as well as original hits like “Knives Out,” “La La Land” and “The Hurt Locker.”\n\n\tBarber began his career at 20th Century Fox in New York City before moving to Los Angeles in 1998 to work at Warner Bros. There, he spent nearly a decade in theatrical distribution and worked on films such as “Harry Potter,” “The Matrix,” “Batman Begins” and “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” He joined Summit Entertainment in 2007 and helped launch the domestic distribution arm of the company, which was acquired by Lionsgate in 2012.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m honored to join Paramount Pictures at this defining moment in its storied history,” Barber said. “I look forward to collaborating with the exceptional team guiding the studio’s next phase of growth. Together with our exhibition partners, we’re committed to championing and elevating the power of the theatrical experience for audiences everywhere.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLate political activist Assata Shakur is set to be the subject of a documentary feature and a scripted project by filmmakers Giselle and Stephen Bailey (HBO’s “Seen & Heard: The History of Black Television”). \n\n\tShakur, also known as Joanne Chesimard, was a member of the Black Liberation Army and had been a fugitive sought by the U.S. since escaping prison in 1979. Shakur died on Sept. 25 in Havana, Cuba, where she had received political asylum. She was 78 years old. The forthcoming projects are authorized by Shakur’s daughter, Kakuya Shakur, and produced and co-directed by the sister-brother filmmaking team through their banner, Indigo Films.\n\t\n\n\t“Assata’s story is important to all Americans as it reveals the powers that divide us and our capacity to heal,” co-directors Giselle and Stephen Bailey said in a statement announcing the projects.\n\n\n\tCivil rights lawyer Lennox Hinds, who served as counsel to Shakur, granted the filmmakers exclusive access, and political activist, professor and author Angela Davis is also on board as executive producer. The documentary is supported by Sundance, Firelight Media, the Concordia Fellowship and Chicken & Egg Films (which delivered a key research and development grant, supported by Netflix’s fund for creative equity). \n\n\tGiselle and Stephen Bailey are Jamaican-American film and TV directors who have been featured on DOC NYC’s 40 under 40 list. Giselle Bailey was also awarded a Concordia Fellowship for directing and the William Greaves grant from Firelight Media. She most recently directed and produced the HBO documentary “Seen & Heard,” for which Stephen served as director of photography. The siblings also collaborated on HBO’s “The Legend of the Underground” (with Giselle as co-director and producer and Stephen as producer and DP) and Netflix’s “Ladies First: A Story of Women in Hip-Hop.” Stephen Bailey is also billed as a co-producer on the HBO doc, “Armed With Only a Camera: The Life and Death of Brent Renaud.” Giselle and Stephen Bailey are represented by WME.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story discusses major plot points and reveals the ending for “Bugonia,” currently playing in theaters.\n\n\tYorgos Lanthimos and his go-to composer, Jerskin Fendrix, began discussing “Bugonia,” back in 2023.\n\n\tBut Lanthimos had one request. “He said he’d like me not to read the script and not know anything about it,” Fendrix says. Additionally, Lanthimos directed him not to watch the original film it is based on, the 2003 South Korean film “Save the Green Planet!“ by Jang Joon-hwan. \n\t\n\n\tThe approach marked a new chapter for their collaboration. On “Poor Things,” Fendrix had access to the script and a lot of concept art. For “Kinds of Kindness, he had the script. This time around, Lanthimos only shared three words with Fendrix: bees, basement and spaceship.\n\n\t“If you’ve seen the film, it makes sense. However, without having seen the film, it was quite challenging to identify the commonalities between those three concepts. If anything, it was unconventional,” Fendrix admits, though he agreed it was a fun approach.\n\n\t“Bugonia” stars Emma Stone as Michelle, the CEO of a pharmaceutical company. She’s kidnapped by Teddy (Jesse Plemons) and his cousin Don (Aidan Delbis), who keep Michelle in a basement as they press her to confess she is an alien. Teddy also lives in a remote ranch house where he keeps bees.\n\n\tFendrix says he spent months researching those three words and the concepts around them. “I looked into the different meanings and applications they could have and then tried to see what kind of connective tissue I could find between them before actually writing the music.”\n\t\n\n\tIn finding the score behind the bees, he says, “Bees have an interesting and familiar sound which is employed a great deal in the film.”\n\n\tHe goes on to say he was interested in systems, “I was interested in geometric ideas. Honeycomb is such a big part of imagery around bees. That’s very representative of how uniform and equal, and also how complicated they are as a social structure. I saw a lot of things coming up through designs and systems in basements and other architectural theories to do with that. And also spaceships. There are literally spaceships that have honeycomb patterns on the side of them, because they tessellate in a way that seems conducive to their purpose.”\n\n\tOn reflection, Fendrix reveals, “If I’d known what the film was about, I would have written in a very different way, which is a testament to Yorgos’ direction.”\n\n\tFor the film’s basement sequences, Fendrix says, “You’ve got this conspiracy theory guy who’s gone way too far down this internet rabbit hole. It’s just a very sad story about him and his cousin. In reality, he’s fighting for the fate of the world, like this is an apocalypse film. … The score is basically there in the background, saying, the stakes are high.”\n\n\tThat’s because the third act reveals that Teddy was right all along, and Michelle is an alien. She’s an Andromeda, an ancient species that has been watching over humanity since the dawn of time.\n\n\t“The spaceship music I wrote was purely orchestral, the basement music I wrote was purely synthesizer, and then the bees’ stuff was a combination of the two.”\n\n\tBut Lanthimos didn’t use the music Fendrix assumed he would. “The synthesizer is the only bit that made it into the film for the final scene of the spaceship. The music isn’t this big final fanfare. The spaceship music is quite ambient and peaceful in a certain way, but also alien in a sense.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount didn’t want to keep Stephen Colbert at CBS, but the company has signed Jon Stewart for another year of hosting “The Daily Show” once per week on Comedy Central.\n\n\tStewart will continue to serve as executive producer for the series through December 2026, the company said Monday, with the show’s pack of contributors taking the helm of the late-night program Tuesday through Thursday.\n\n\n\t“Jon Stewart continues to elevate the genre he created. His return is an ongoing commitment to the incisive comedy and sharp commentary that define ‘ Daily Show,'” said Ari Pearce, head of Comedy Centra, in a statement. “The renewal is a win for audiences, for Comedy Central and for all our programming partners.  We’re proud to support Jon and the extraordinary news team.”\n\t\n\n\tStewart’s renewal comes at a fraught moment for late-night TV. Paramount’s CBS is getting out of the format, and shocked the industry earlier this year by announcing its intention to cancel Colbert’s “Late Show” in May of next year. Disney recently sidelined Jimmy Kimmel for a few days after some of his monologue remarks spurred two of his nation’s largest TV-station owners to threaten not to broadcast his ABC program, “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”\n\n\n\tLate-night shows have been grappling with the erosion of their traditional audiences, who can increasingly watch clips of the programs the following day via social media rather then having to stay up late to view them live. The shows have also come under scrutiny during President Trump’s two terms in office, with many of the hosts using barbed humor to lash out at various White House policies and pronouncements.\n\t\n\n\t“Daily Show” may have added appeal to Paramount because its cost structure has been revamped. The program does not rely on a single host, though Stewart, who left the program in 2015, and returned to it in 2024, commands much of the spotlight. Stewart hosts only on Mondays, with a ersatz “news team” comprised of Ronny Chieng, Josh Johnson, Jordan Klepper, Michael Kosta, Desi Lydic, Troy Iwata and Grace Kuhlenschmidt, taking up more on screen duties on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. on occasion holding forth on other days of the week. \n\n\tThe program is one of only a handful of original series on the network, which may have also bolstered its case.  In the past, advertisers have typically had to buy a bigger package of Comedy Central commercial inventory in order to get spots on “Daily,” according to people familiar with the matter. In other words, “Daily Show”  has served as an economic force at Paramount’s cable properties, even as they have suffered viewer erosion in the streaming era.\n\n\tStewart is slated to continue in his role as executive producer, working with showrunner and executive producer Jen Flanz as well as his manager, James Dixon, who also has a producer role at the series. \n",

The Justin Hartley starrer returned on Oct. 19 with 12.97 million viewers, according to Nielsen’s live+7-day multiplatform data.

Among other series premieres, the Oct. 17 premiere of “Sheriff Country” (a spinoff of “Fire Country”) averaged 7.73 million viewers (up 35% from the season average last year of previous timeslot holder “S.W.A.T.”), while new comedy “DMV” launched on Oct. 13 with 6.6 million viewers, up 46% from the season average of last year’s time slot holder “Poppa’s House.”\n\n\tAmong other CBS returnees, the Season 23 premiere of “NCIS” averaged 8.6 million viewers; the Season 5 premiere of “Ghosts” averaged 8.27 million viewers; and the first two episodes of “Elsbeth” Season 3 averaged 8.26 million viewers. \n\t\n\n\tAlso: The Season 2 premiere of comedy “Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage” averaged 7.85 million viewers and the Season 8 premiere of “FBI” averaged 7.58 million viewerts.\n\n\tThanks to the return of those series, according to CBS it now leads the fall in live+7 ratings for entertainment fare, averaging 6.8 million viewers in total multiplatform numbers, followed by ABC (6.5 million), NBC (5.7 million) and Fox (3.1 million).\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tIn the shifting wardrobe of modern Hollywood – from power meetings to backlot lunches and press junkets — one brand has quietly carved out a niche among agents, producers and studio executives: Collars & Co. Their mission is simple: to empower men to look and feel their best with elevated casual wear. \n\n\tLaunched in 2021 by founder Justin Baer, the brand’s origin story is refreshingly relatable. After years of wearing stiff dress shirts under sweaters in New York, Baer wanted something polished yet breathable. The result was the Dress Collar Polo — a performance polo with a real English spread or semi-spread collar engineered for versatility. The design quickly became the uniform for those who spend their days moving between offices, sets and red carpets. \n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Hollywood’s embrace of Collars & Co. really validates what we’ve believed from day one, style doesn’t have to shout to make an impression,” Baer tells Variety. “It’s about pieces that move with you, feel incredible, and quietly elevate every moment.”\n\n\n\tThe brand’s appeal dovetails with Hollywood’s “quiet luxury” movement, popularized by series like “Succession“ and “Industry,” which boast the understated aesthetic of the new elite. Clean lines, minimal branding and subtle tailoring define the Collars & Co. ethos. On any given day, a Semi-Spread Collar Polo can be spotted under a navy blazer at CAA or paired with sneakers in a Beverly Hills production office. \n\n\tThe product lineup extends beyond the hero polo: the Maverick Performance Blazer, now available in a new knit unstructured version, offers tailoring without rigidity, while the Apex Performance Dress Shirt brings stretch and breathability to traditional officewear. For fall, the Bellagio Long Sleeve Polo adds an elevated layer for LA’s cool evenings. \n\t\n\n\tShop through all of Collar & Co’s offerings here, and a few standout pieces for this season below: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tDiana Silvers is right where she’s supposed to be. \n\n\tThe 27-year-old actress and model — who you may recognize from films like “Booksmart” and “Ma” or high-profile campaigns for Celine and Prada — has been charting a new path in music lately, making her live debut at the storied Newport Folk Festival in July before joining the Grammy- and Oscar-winning musician Jon Batiste on his sold-out “Big Money” tour across the U.S. With all of this happening before she officially released any music of her own, calling the past few months a whirlwind would be an understatement.\n\t\n\n\t“When I first got home, I think I sat on my couch and cried for five minutes,” Silvers tells Variety over Zoom from her apartment in New York City, back for a weeklong break before the tour’s final stretch. “I feel very, very lucky and privileged that opening for Jon is my first experience with touring. And I do not take it for granted. It’s been, honestly, an unbelievably transformative experience.”\n\n\n\tAfter I ask how she got here, Silvers suddenly sounds distant. “Sorry if you hear me shuffling away from my computer for one second because I’m gonna grab my journal,” she says from across the room before settling back into her chair. Here, Silvers has kept track of every “serendipitous moment” and sign from the universe during her trek; the one she shares with me happened in Austin, Texas, while on the hunt for coffee at 4 p.m. (which, it turns out, is a daunting task when not in NYC). \n\n\t“Nothing was open and I was in a weird part of town, but I went to this one place and there was a jar of fortune cookies,” she says. “I dug around, grabbed one and opened it, and it said: ‘Keep true to the dreams of your youth.'”\n\t\n\n\tSilvers grew up in Los Angeles in a household of classical musicians, where her instrument of choice was the cello. At 10 years old, after discovering artists like Taylor Swift and Avril Lavigne, she begged her father to let her pick up the guitar. “He was like, ‘Girls don’t play guitar.’ And I was like, ‘Well, that’s not true!’ So I started teaching myself guitar in secret,” she says. Silvers also began writing songs, but kept her artistry behind closed doors — except for the occasional Joni Mitchell cover posted to her Instagram — until her Newport performance over the summer. In September, she released her first single from her forthcoming debut album “From Another Room” (out this Friday via Capitol Records) — a sun-soaked, Wurlitzer piano-led tribute to new love titled “June.” That very month was on the back of the fortune, Silvers reveals.\n\n\t“I was like, that’s insane that this fortune has the name of my first single,” she continues. “And I bring this up because what I’ve noticed is I feel the most myself and the most connected to my inner child when I am singing and playing music. It’s just the purest form of expression.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJEN ROSENSTEIN\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSo what took her so long to let her voice be heard? Silvers simply didn’t feel that she had anything to say — until September 2024, when a song “came out like a stream of consciousness” after a plane ride from New York back to Calgary, Canada, where she was shooting the upcoming Netflix Western series “The Abandons.” Filming the show was a “really challenging experience,” Silvers says, and on top of that she was reading “Missoula,” the 2015 book by Jon Krakauer that recounts a series of sexual assaults at the University of Montana that were ultimately linked back to the school’s football team. As the plane flew over the Rocky Mountains, a newborn baby girl the row in front of her began to cry, and Silvers watched as a grown man grew visibly irritated.\n\n\t“I was like, this is all so unfair,” Silvers says. “This baby, she’s brand new to the world and there’s already a man who has it out for her, you know what I mean? Just by her being, there’s already a man that’s angry about her existence. She doesn’t deserve to know the fear already.”\n\n\tOn the somber track “Airplane” — Silvers’ second single, released Oct. 10 — she captures poignantly how it feels to move through this world as a woman, and how for many of us, fear is a feeling all too familiar. “I was only 15/ And now I’m scared,” Silvers croons over a softly strummed guitar, before the chorus repeats: “I fear what I feel/ I fear what I feel/ I fear what I feel.”\n\t\n\n\t“For centuries, men have abused and used and shamed and humiliated and gaslit women for their own personal amusement and personal gain, and the question somehow always ended up as, and continues to be — ‘Well, what did she do to bring that abuse upon herself?'” Silvers wrote in her newsletter the day “Airplane” debuted. “It’s a question I’ve asked myself too many times. Was I too nice? Did he mistake my kindness for something more? Was I too this? Was I too that? What did I do to deserve this? It’s the questioning I hope and pray my generation’s daughters won’t have to ask themselves.”\n\n\n\n\n\tWriting “Airplane” was the call to action that Silvers needed. “I was like, ‘This song scares the hell out of me, but I think this is important,'” she remembers. “And then a little over a month later, fucking — excuse my language — Donald Trump gets reelected and I was like, man, OK. I really have something I need to say, because I’m so angry. But I don’t just want to be angry, I want to do something with this energy and mobilize it. And as someone who is inspired by artists over history who have courageously spoken out through their art, I was like, ‘I need to put it out there, into the world, because I think that we deserve better.'”\n\n\tIndeed, it seems that the speaking-truth-to-power spirit of folk giants before her, like Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell, lives on in Silvers. Their sound does too — Silvers’ mezzo-soprano voice has already been compared to that of Mitchell, and her plainspoken lyricism has a certain Dylan-esque quality to it. All of this, plus simple guitar or piano instrumentals and Silvers’ insistence on recording every track live in one take, makes “From Another Room” sound like it’s from another time. Recorded at the legendary Electric Lady Studios in New York, it was imperative to Silvers that her album sound raw and without gimmicks or filters, which she made sure of by self-producing it alongside studio managing partner Lee Foster. The result is a nostalgic, thoughtful introduction of an artist with her heart on her sleeve — from “For Dad’s” soul-wrenching rumination on the passage of time to the hopeful, salted-air sweetness of “Big Sur” to a eulogy for a love lost too young on “The Dream.”\n\t\n\n\tAs for releasing some of her most vulnerable feelings into the world, Silvers admits she’s weary. “But if your art doesn’t scare you a little bit, it’s not really worth it,” she says. “I think for me, the cathartic part was writing and making the songs. And now, to release it into the world is to let go. My hope and my wish is that these songs, this record, whatever I make moving forward — that someone listens and sees themself in it, you know?”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDavid O’Donohue\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSilvers is also designing the vinyl for “From Another Room,” which will contain a secret track. “I just want this to be a weird thing that’s only on the vinyl because some of my favorite artists have done that too,” she says. “It’s a nice little surprise to get to at the end, because it keeps spinning and you’re like, ‘Wait!’ You think it’s over and then it’s not.”\n\n\tDiving headfirst into music has fueled Silvers’ other creative pursuits, including her desire to direct. She helmed both music videos for “June” and “Airplane,” showing off her unique, vintage-inspired vision and employing all-female crews.\n\n\t“I’ve just been learning so much over the years being on the receiving end as the actor or model, taking direction and seeing how these sets operate,” she says. “And to then step into the role of like, OK, how do I communicate my creative ideas in a way that is productive and kind? It’s just really fun.” \n\n\tAnd as for balancing her still-thriving acting career with music, Silvers plans on letting curiosity reign.\n\n\t“As long as what I’m doing is fulfilling and brings me joy and pushes that curiosity, that’s what I’ll follow. Presently, it’s definitely music,” she says. “Simultaneously, it’s like hey, if Sofia Coppola wants to make a movie, I’m not gonna say no. I just am open — I feel very open right now to whatever the universe and life wants to throw at me.”\n",

The lineup also boosted acting prospects for Benicio Del Toro, Teyana Taylor and breakout Chase Infiniti, while best actress frontrunner Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”) continues to solidify her standing after months of critical praise.\n\n\tTunisia’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab” found a home with indie distributor Willa, setting it up for an awards-qualifying run in Dec.\n\n\tOn the studio front, “Wicked: For Good” continues to charm with early raves as a “heartbreakingly tender conclusion” to the blockbuster saga and emerging as a top contender in multiple races. Meanwhile, Golden Globes submissions are starting to shape the comedy and drama fields: “Is This Thing On” will compete as a drama, giving Will Arnett and Laura Dern clear paths for lead consideration, while “The Testament of Ann Lee” will vie in comedy/musical, bolstered by two original songs that could double its Oscar appeal.\n\n\tOn the comedy/musical side of the Golden Globes, a deep bench of contenders is beginning to take shape, with hopefuls such as Kate Hudson for “Song Sung Blue,” which premiered at AFI Fest, and Brendan Fraser’s “Rental Family,” which continues to rack up audience awards on the festival circuit.\n\n\tThis week’s updates are below.\n\n\tTop 4 projected Oscar nomination leaders (films): “One Battle After Another” and “Sinners” (13); “Hamnet” (11); “Wicked: For Good” (10); “Sentimental Value” (7)\n\n\tTop 4 projected Oscar nomination leaders (studios): Warner Bros.

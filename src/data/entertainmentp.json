    "body": "\n\t“Euphoria” creator Sam Levinson is paying tribute to Eric Dane, who played Cal Jacobs on the HBO Max show. Dane died Thursday.\n\n\t“I’m heartbroken by the loss of our dear friend Eric. Working with him was an honor. Being his friend was a gift. Eric’s family is in our prayers. May his memory be for a blessing,” Levinson said in a statement to Variety.\n\n\tDane went public with his ALS diagnosis just last year.\n\n\n\tHBOMax said on Instagram, “We are deeply saddened by the news of Eric Dane’s passing. He was incredibly talented and HBO was fortunate to have worked with him on three seasons of Euphoria. Our thoughts are with his loved ones during this difficult time.”\n\t\n\n\tDane told Variety last year, “I’ve always had a profound respect for the craft of acting, but I never considered myself an artist. I could never admit it, until I started making ‘Euphoria.’ That’s when I gave myself the allowance to feel like I was an artist.”\n\n\tAbout working with Levinson, Dane said, “I just have so much trust in Sam Levinson that I don’t really need to know what’s happening. On the day, he can just tell me what to do and where to go, and I’m good with it.”\n\n\tKnown for his role as “McSteamy” on “Grey’s Anatomy,” Dane went on to play the complicated father of Jacob Elordi’s character on “Euphoria.” Over the years, the California native also appeared on “Gideon’s Crossing,” “Charmed” and “The Last Ship” and in films including “Marley and Me,” “Valentine’s Day” and “X-Men: The Last Stand.”\n\n\tLast year, he also appeared on Amazon Prime’s “Countdown” as a special agent.\n\t\n\n\tDane advocated for support for ALS through I Am ALS and told the Washington Post, “Not to be overly morbid,” he said. “but you know, if I’m going out, I’m gonna go out helping somebody.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\t“WWE SmackDown” is getting a temporary new home this week thanks to the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\n\t“SmackDown” normally airs on the USA Network, but the channel has switched over to 24/7 Olympic programming until Feb. 22. Most scripted shows on USA Network are on pause during the Olympics, but since “WWE SmackDown” is a weekly live event — held in front of live arena audiences — it has had to find a new temporary broadcast home.\n\n\n\tWant to watch “Friday Night SmackDown?” The show moved to the Syfy channel for the Feb. 13 broadcast and will also air on Syfy for the Feb. 20 airing. You can watch “SmackDown” on TV with any cable package that includes the specialty channel in its offerings. The start time for the show remains the same, with an 8 p.m. ET air time.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow to Watch “WWE SmackDown” Live Online on Syfy\t\n\n\tDon’t have cable or want to stream “SmackDown” on Syfy online? You can watch the wrestling show online through DirecTV, which offers 90+ live television channels that you can stream without cable. DirecTV’s channel lineup includes a live Syfy feed, so you can use the streamer to watch “SmackDown” live online. Test drive the service with a five-day free trial here and use it to watch “SmackDown” on Syfy online free.\n\n\tDirecTV lets you watch Syfy and other live TV channels through your computer, tablet, smartphone or smart TV.\n\n\tAnother way to stream “SmackDown” on Syfy is by signing up for Sling. The live streamer’s Sling Blue package costs just $54.99/month for 40+ channels, including Syfy. Use Sling to livestream “WWE SmackDown” online without cable. Sling Blue lets you stream on up to three devices at a time and includes DVR so you can record the broadcast to watch a replay back on-demand later.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow to Watch “WWE SmackDown” on Peacock\t\n\n\tAnother way to watch “WWE SmackDown” online? Every episode of “Friday Night SmackDown” is available to watch on-demand through Peacock, the day after it airs on TV. That means the Syfy episodes will be on the NBCUniversal streaming service for you to stream online.\n\n\tIn addition to streaming the Olympics and the recent Super Bowl, Peacock is the official streaming partner for the WWE, and it’s also where you’ll be able to watch live wrestling events like “SummerSlam,” “Wrestlemania,” “Royal Rumble” and others.\n\n\tThe move from USA Network to Syfy won’t affect “SmackDown’s” air dates or schedule. The show still airs at 8 p.m. on Friday night and will remain a three-hour broadcast.\n\n\tThis week’s show brings the stars to the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville, Kentucky, with Carmelo Hayes vs. Trick Williams vs. Damian Priest in the men’s Elimination Chamber qualification match. It’s Nia Jax vs. Charlotte Flair vs. Kiana James for the women’s Elimination Chamber qualification. \n\n\tThe Elimination Chamber 2026 takes place a week later, on Feb. 28 in Chicago as a Premium Live Event airing on ESPN Unlimited.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron has written a letter arguing that if Netflix is successful in its bid for Warner Bros.’ studio and streaming businesses, it could cause huge job loss, change the theatrical landscape and hurt the film export business. \n\n\tThe “Avatar” filmmaker sent his letter last week to Senator Mike Lee, chair of the Senate subcommittee on antitrust, and the letter was then recently obtained by CNBC.\n\n\n\t“I believe strongly that the proposed sale of Warner Brothers Discovery to Netflix will be disastrous for the theatrical motion picture business that I have dedicated my life’s work to,” Cameron wrote in the letter. “Of course, my films all play in the downstream video markets as well, but my first love is the cinema.”\n\t\n\n\tCameron predicted that if the number of big-budget films such as he makes contracts, “Theaters will close. Fewer films will be made. The job losses will spiral.”\n\n\t“The business model of Netflix is directly at odds with the theatrical film production and exhibition business, which employs hundreds of thousands of Americans,” he wrote. “It is therefore directly at odds with the business model of the Warner Brothers movie division, one of the few remaining major movie studios.”\n\n\tLee answered with a statement saying, “We have received outreach from actors, directors, and other interested parties about the proposed Netflix and Warner Brothers merger, and I share many of their concerns. I look forward to holding a follow-up hearing to further address these issues.”\n\n\tCameron also contends that exports of Hollywood films would suffer in a Netflix-Warners merger. “The U.S. may no longer lead in auto or steel manufacturing, but it is still the world leader in movies. That will change for the worse.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMelissa Barrera is heading to Broadway.\n\n\tVariety has learned exclusively that the “Scream” and “In the Heights” star will make her Broadway debut in the campy spoof “Titanique,” stepping into the role of Rose for the musical’s upcoming Main Stem bow at the St. James Theatre in New York.\n\n\tThe award-winning comedy reimagines James Cameron’s 1997 blockbuster “Titanic” through the perspective and song catalog of Céline Dion.\n\n\n\tBarrera takes on the role of Rose DeWitt Bukater, immortalized on screen by Kate Winslet, in a spoof that asks what “really happened to Jack and Rose on that fateful night,” all filtered through Dion’s biggest hits. The musical features songs including “My Heart Will Go On,” “Because You Loved Me,” “All by Myself” and “To Love You More,” woven into a comedic retelling that leans into broad humor and theatrical absurdity.\n\t\n\n\tMarla Mindelle, the show’s co-creator, will reprise her role as Céline Dion. She co-wrote “Titanique” with Tye Blue and Constantine Rousouli. Also joining the Broadway company is four-time Emmy winner and Tony Award nominee Jim Parsons, who will play Rose’s mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, a role originated by Frances Fisher in the film. Grammy nominee Deborah Cox will play Unsinkable Molly Brown, portrayed by Kathy Bates in the film.\n\n\t“Titanique” first opened off-Broadway in June 2022 at the Asylum Theatre, then transferred to the Daryl Roth Theatre, where it ran for three years, closing in June 2025. During its off-Broadway run, the production expanded internationally with engagements in Sydney, London, Chicago and Paris.\n\t\n\n\tWith Barrera at the helm as Rose, the splashy send-up is poised to bring powerhouse vocals. Her most recent credits include Netflix’s “Your Monster.”\n\n\tSome of Barrera’s other recent credits include the Peacock television series “The Copenhagen Test” with Simu Liu. Her upcoming projects include roles in Renny Harlin’s action thriller “Black Tides” and the film adaptation of “The Collaboration,” directed by Kwame Kwei-Armah and starring Jeremy Pope and Paul Bettany.\n\n\tThe production will debut on Broadway this spring for a 16-week limited engagement. Previews begin March 26, with an official opening set for April 12. The production will conclude on July 12.\n\n\tBarrera is repped by IAG, imPRint and Range. \n",

    "body": "\n\tEric Dane, best known for his role as Dr. Mark Sloan (“McSteamy”) on “Grey’s Anatomy” and as complicated father Cal Jacobs on “Euphoria,” died February 19, his family confirmed to People Magazine.\n\n\tDane was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, in 2025.\n\n\t“With heavy hearts, we share that Eric Dane passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS. He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife, and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the center of his world. Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight. He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he’s received. The family has asked for privacy as they navigate this impossible time,” the statement from his family said.\n\t\n\n\tBorn in San Francisco in 1972, Dane grew up in the Bay Area, attending Sequoia High School in Redwood City and San Mateo High School in San Mateo. After graduating from the latter, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting. In the 90s, he played bit parts on television series “Saved by the Bell,” “The Wonder Years,” “Roseanne,” and “Married… with Children” before landing the recurring role of Dr. Wyatt Cooper on “Gideon’s Crossing” in 2000. That same year, he made his film debut in Rich Cowan’s “The Basket.”\n\n\n\tHe appeared in other movies throughout the early aughts, including “Zoe,” “Duncan,” “Jack & Jane,” “Sol Goode,” “Feast,” “X-Men: The Last Stand” and “Marley & Me.” He also had a starring role in “Open Water 2” and played Jason Dean for two seasons on The WB’s “Charmed.”\n\t\n\n\tIn 2005, he made his first guest appearance as Dr. Mark Sloan on a Season 2 episode of “Grey’s Anatomy.” His character was so well-received that he became a regular in the following season and remained so until he was written off in Season 8. Nevertheless, he still appeared in two Season 9 episodes and reprised the character once more, 19 years later, in the Season 17 episode “Breathe.”\n\n\tABC and 20th Television, the companies behind “Grey’s Anatomy,” issued a statement Thursday night: “We are deeply saddened by the loss of Eric Dane,” it read. “His remarkable talent and unforgettable presence on ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ left a lasting impact on audiences around the world, and his courage and grace during his battle with ALS inspired so many. Our hearts are with his family, friends, and colleagues, as well as the many fans whose lives were touched by his work.”\n\n\tThroughout the 2010s, he appeared in the A&E television movie “Wedding Wars” and the theatrical rom-com “Valentine’s Day.” He was a main cast member on Michael Bay’s “The Last Ship,” which ran on TNT from 2014 through 2019.\n\n\tIn 2019, he began playing Cal Jacobs, the secretly bisexual father of Nate Jacobs (Jacob Elordi), on HBO’s “Euphoria,” appearing in 12 episodes across the show’s first two seasons. He reprised the role for the show’s third season, which will premiere in April.\n\n\tThe final performances in Dane’s career include roles in the films “Borderline,” “Into the Beautiful,” and “Family Secrets” and the television series “Wireless,” “Countdown” and “Kabul.”\n\n\tAfter going public with his diagnosis, he became an advocate for others with ALS, working with I Am ALS on legislation and fundraising.\n\n\t“I have been an open book about certain things in my life. This is something I felt compelled to share with people,” Dane told the Washington Post. “I don’t really have a dog in the fight, per se, when it comes to worrying about what people are going think about me. This is more of a: ‘How can I help? How can I be of some service?’”\n\n\t“Not to be overly morbid,” he said. “but you know, if I’m going out, I’m gonna go out helping somebody.”\n\n\tHe is survived by two daughters.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLike many TV watchers, I first took notice of Eric Dane on “Grey’s Anatomy.” His Dr. Mark Sloan — “McSteamy,” in the show’s parlance — was a gleeful agent of chaos, remixing the show’s existing couplings, thanks in large part to Dane’s smoldering charisma, wielded to great effect.\n\n\tDane, who died on Feb. 19 after a much-publicized diagnosis of ALS, was a magnetic figure. But in the years after his time on “Grey’s” ended (he left the show in 2012), Dane also became a more interesting actor, thanks in large part to one dynamite role. The kids of “Euphoria” get all the attention, but it was Dane’s pained performance as a man fighting against his every impulse that lent that show’s first two seasons genuine ballast. Without Dane’s performance as Cal Jacobs, a closeted dad whose desires have become an all-consuming enemy, neither Jacob Elordi (playing Cal’s son) nor Hunter Schafer (playing a high-school girl caught up in an unhealthy relationship with Cal) would have nearly as much to play. \n\t\n\n\tBut his performance on “Euphoria” is brilliant on its own terms. As Cal, Dane could barely express what he truly wanted: What came so easily to the sexually fluent McSteamy at the anything-goes Seattle Grace Hospital was suddenly bound up and hidden when he had to play chaperone to the teens at Euphoria High. That we who’d seen “Grey’s” knew how readily Dane could play friendly and funny and sexy only made the triumph of Dane’s frigidity on “Euphoria” more apparent. Here, he was a man so uncomfortable in his own skin that he demanded to elicit that discomfort in others. His son, as well as Jules, a trans teen who’d been intrigued by his admittedly inappropriate entreaties, recoiled at his touch. And why wouldn’t they? Cal — taciturn, and yet quick to startling waves of anger — seemed like the kind of man who’d blanch at his own reflection. \n\t\n\n\tBack in Season 2, before Dane’s health took a turn, I recall thinking to myself that the mere fact of this performer taking this role was quite daring. Yes, actors need to work, and this was a job with HBO, but there’d been no guarantee that “Euphoria” would perform quite like it did (coming to dominate culture every Sunday night during its run), and, well — he’d been McSteamy! Wouldn’t other roles like that, leading-man parts with a twist, appeal more? Instead, Dane leaned into a part that got its own standout episode, one in which we saw a flashback to Cal’s past exploring his sexuality with men before seeing present-tense Cal, drunk and despondent, excoriate his family before literally pissing on the floor as he walks out on them. \n\n\t“Euphoria” gets a lot of heat for being over-the-top, but, within its loopy creative universe, the performances must be carefully calibrated so as to keep the whole thing from crashing down. And Dane did just that; he returns for the upcoming Season 3, and I have every belief his performance will be a highlight. \n\n\tI’d assumed it was the Shonda Rhimes training that kept his “Euphoria” performance coherent, but, when I interviewed Dane last year, he told me there was something else at work, too: a new willingness to be freewheeling and to take risks. “I’ve always had a profound respect for the craft of acting, but I never considered myself an artist,” he said. “I could never admit it, until I started making ‘Euphoria.’ That’s when I gave myself the allowance to feel like I was an artist.”\n\n\tAnd it was art he made: Dane brought to life someone pushing so hard against walls that cannot come down in his understanding of his sexuality that the effort had to break something. In this same interview, I had felt obliged to ask Dane (delicately, to the point of awkwardness) about his living with ALS. The diagnosis had been announced months prior, and Dane was now promoting the Amazon series “Countdown,” on which he played a supporting role, but the news hung in the air. “I really don’t want to talk about it,” he said. “I made the announcement. That’s what’s going on with me; it’s very personal to me.”\n\n\tFair enough. But, attempting to move on from a head-on discussion of the private matter of health, I wondered: What work did Dane envision doing going forward? “I am ready and willing to do just about anything, but I have limitations that I understand will preclude me from playing certain roles,” he said. “I’m working on ‘Euphoria.’ I finished ‘Countdown.’ As far as that goes, I’m pretty capable.”\n\t\n\n\tThe clock is cruel; an actor who will live forever in youth as a hunky surgeon is gone before his time. But the passage of time is the whole point of his final major performance, too. Cal Jacobs let his life slip away from him piece by piece until he realized, all at once, that it was gone. The cordial, insightful Eric Dane who, even when sick, raved in our interview about his younger colleagues and told me that he’d come to realize that how one conducts oneself on a set — and off it — is the measure of a performer? I met him only briefly, but I don’t think he made the same mistake. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAn-Li Bogan has been cast in the untitled NBC drama pilot from Dean Georgaris and John Fox, Variety has learned. \n\n\tBogan will star alongside previously announced lead Emily Deschanel in the pilot, which is inspired by the real-life work of internationally renowned expert profiler and author Dr. Ann Burgess. \n\n\tThe logline for the pilot states, “Professor Georgia Ryan (Deschanel) is a trailblazing psychologist who challenges the field of criminology by shifting the investigative focus to the victim rather than just the perpetrator in order to uncover the crucial clues that more traditional methods leave behind. Alongside her team, this pioneering expert consults with the FBI to solve the most baffling and elusive cases.”\n\t\n\n\tBogan will play Natalie Washington. Per the official character description, “She lives with hyperthymesia, a rare condition that allows her to remember every moment of every day of her life with perfect clarity. This extraordinary gift makes her an unparalleled investigative asset: details others forget, she recalls instantly; patterns others miss, she sees immediately.”\n\n\n\tBogan is known for her roles in films like “The American Society of Magical Negroes” and shorts like “Let” and “Half Moon.” She recently wrapped shooting in the indie feature “Echo Lake.” She has also appeared in TV shows like “Bull” and “Elementary” at CBS\n\n\tBogan is repped by Gersh and Brillstein Entertainment Partners. \n\n\tGeorgaris and Fox are writers and executive producers on the pilot, with John Davis executive producing via Davis Entertainment. Deschanel will produce in addition to starring. Burgess is a consulting producer, as is Steve Constantine. Universal Television will produce.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe movies we call faith-based often take the form of disaster porn. It only makes sense. These movies, framed as tests of faith, are built around a literalization of the spirit of Job and Jesus — the Biblical figures who found transcendence by facing the worst that life could dish out. (That’s how a lot of us find our faith.)\n\n\t“I Can Only Imagine,” the 2018 Christian rock drama that was framed as a biopic of Bart Millard (John Michael Finley), the lead singer of MercyMe, may have been a feel-good parable pegged to one of the biggest Christian pop hits of all time (the title song, which was released in 2001). But it was all about overcoming the darkness — in this case, the fact that Bart was drowning in daddy issues, with a father, played by Dennis Quaid (who lent a veteran great actor’s force to the movie), with violent abusive ways that shadowed Bart. How do you find your faith when your father has taught you to hate yourself? That’s the dilemma “I Can Only Imagine” tapped into, though of course it was also a sentimental disease-of-the-week movie in which the bad dad sees the error of his ways, and the kid becomes a whopping success. In faith-based cinema, the miracles never cease.\n\t\n\n\tIf you’re wondering why it took eight years to make “I Can Only Imagine 2,” the answer is: It wasn’t until 2017 that MercyMe released a song, “Even If,” that was even half a big as “I Can Only Imagine” (the movie involves the writing of that song). Nevertheless, with Bart’s daddy war behind him, you wonder what the directors, Andrew Erwin and Brent McCorkle, are going to come up with for drama. The addictive temptations of fame? Nope. Bart, still played by John Michael Finley, is now a devoted family man, shaggier and a bit bulkier than before (which makes him seem all the more like the G-rated Eddie Vedder of power-chord Biblical uplift). But the movie opens with the discovery that his young son, Sam, has type 1 diabetes; this means that the kid is going to have a life of insulin shots and general caution. Okay, we think, and that means…?\n\t\n\n\tIt means that 10 years later, Bart is moody, addled, struggling to write another hit song, staring at his notebook as he waits for the inspiration to strike. And it means that Sam (Sammy Dell), now a surly teenager, balks at how his dad is always pestering him to measure his insulin levels and take his shots on time. They fight about it; it’s starting to toxify their relationship. “Dreams don’t pay the bills,” says a voice on the soundtrack, and we recognize it as Dennis Quaid’s Arthur, dispensing that don’t-follow-your-dream advice that made Bart’s youth such a joy.\n\n\tSo when the moment arrives for Bart to go on the road again, piling onto the MercyMe tour bus, an idea comes to the fore: What if Sam went on tour with them? ‘I’m worried it might break him,” says Bart. His wife, Shannon (Sophie Skelton), replies, “Or he just might fix you.” Spoiler alert! \n\n\t“I Can Only Imagine” had a clean dramatic line of despair and redemption, and that’s why it worked as a movie (and made $83 million domestic). Yet even if you go into “I Can Only Imagine 2” feeling immersed in the Bart Millard saga, the new movie is a bit of an odd duck, like a faith-based drama on tranquilizers, because it keeps tossing out conflicts that aren’t all that major (or convincing). The tension between Bart and Sam is on a low enough simmer that any parent will recognize it, but we also can’t help but notice the following: that Sam is an aspiring musician, so it would be the most natural thing in the world for his benevolent Christian-family-man rock-star dad to, you know, pick up a guitar and play with him. But no! Bart has to learn the lesson that he’s been ignoring his son’s dream, just like his dad did. It’s a bit of “Cat’s in the Cradle,” though fuzzier and less biting than it is in the song.\n\n\tAnd then there’s Tim Timmons (Milo Ventimiglia). He’s the singer-songwriter who’s been chosen to be MercyMe’s opening act, and he’s an irascible contradiction: a bearded folk-rock hipster who specializes in busting people’s chops, yet he’s also the most pious person on the tour bus, devoted to his book on the history of hymns. When he asks Sam to be his guitar tech, we wonder if he’s going to emerge as a rival father figure for Bart. But no. He’s just on hand to give Bart some badly needed pep talks about what faith really means — which is being grateful for each and  every day, and doing so by finding the beauty in it. (He draws a “tattooed” cross on his wrist each day to remind himself.) Ventimiglia is such an appealing actor that I was touched by this lesson, even as I snapped back to the gauzy feeling that I was being given a fortune cookie dressed up as Sunday school.\n\t\n\n\tJohn Michael Finley play Bart as a surly good man in a funk. You could say that he has privileged problems, and the film never strains to make it look otherwise. That’s what’s mildly genuine about it; it’s not overinflating Bart’s crisis of faith into a melodramatic big deal. But I also think that could limit the audience for “I Can Only Imagine 2.” On the tour bus, Bart and his buddies, like the band manager, Brick (Trace Adkins), who’s like an aging biker with the voice of Sam Elliott, engage in a form of badinage that I would characterize as bro Christianity. They’re devout, but they’re just dudes. And that’s kind of the point. “I Can Only Imagine 2” isn’t really caught in some Christian niche. It’s as universal a warm bath as a Hallmark Channel movie, leaving you to decide for yourself if that’s what Jesus had in mind.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNew “Hello Kitty” comic books will soon launch as part of a collaboration between Japan’s Sanrio and comics giant IDW Publishing.\n\n\tThe new multi-title partnership will begin with the debut of the “Hello Kitty: Hello World” comic book series July 22 in connection with San Diego Comic Con.\n\n\tPer Sanrio and IDW, the new comic book is described as “a classic and lovable depiction of Sanrio’s characters as Hello Kitty and Friends go on a world tour to solve a riddle. As they discover new riddles around the globe, they will also meet new characters in every single issue!”\n\t\n\n\tThe “Hello Kitty: Hello World” series is written by Mariko Tamaki (“This One Summer,” “Zatanna: Bring Down the House”) and animated by artist Cody Lemieux (“Despite, Despite, Despite,” “Gnome Granny”).\n\n\n\tFollowing the launch of “Hello Kitty: Hello World” this summer, more “Hello Kitty” comics and some “crossovers” will be released from IDW Publishing in 2027.\n\n\tThe Hello Kitty brand has exploded in popularity since Sanrio first introduced the character in 1974, spawning an ever-growing merch line and multiple media projects, including the upcoming feature film from Warner Bros. Pictures Animation and New Line Cinema, set to release in July 2028.\n\n\t“It’s truly an honor to team up with Sanrio to create ‘Hello Kitty’ comics,” IDW Publishing CEO Davidi Jonas said. “We’re thrilled to craft comics that celebrate the cute and fun spirit of the franchise while uplifting readers of every age. We can’t wait for these comics to bring inspiring and joyful stories to comic shops everywhere.”\n\t\n\n\t“It’s time! Hello Kitty and her friends are coming to the comic world with IDW,” associate editor Bixie Mathieu said. ”These beloved characters have been delighting fans for generations, and it’s easy to see why– their joy, whimsy, and friendship make for uplifting storytelling! With so many talented people pouring their hearts into these series, we promise longtime and new fans alike that these stories will be a delight, from the core of their storytelling to the exuberant art on the page! If you’re interested in a heartfelt reading experience unlike anything else, hello!”\n\n\tSee below for a first look at two of the “Hello Kitty: Hello World!” comic book covers, the first by artist Justine King and the second by Min Ho Kim.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe BBC will file a motion to dismiss President Donald Trump‘s $10 billion defamation lawsuit, challenging the case on jurisdictional grounds and disputing claims the broadcaster acted with malice, according to court papers filed Monday and reported by BBC News.\n\n\tThe legal battle stems from fallout over a “Panorama” documentary’s controversial editing of Trump’s January 6, 2021 speech – an issue that contributed to the November resignations of BBC director–general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness after an internal memo criticizing the edit leaked publicly.\n\t\n\n\tTrump filed the lawsuit in a Florida court last month, alleging defamation and trade practices violations. The BBC’s planned defense will argue the Florida court lacks proper jurisdiction over the British broadcaster and that Trump has failed to demonstrate a valid legal claim, court documents cited by BBC News show.\n\n\n\tCentral to the BBC’s defense strategy is the argument that Trump cannot prove actual damages from the program, which aired before he won re-election and carried Florida by a commanding margin. The broadcaster will also maintain Trump cannot establish the documentary was produced with “actual malice” – a critical threshold in U.S. defamation law.\n\n\tThe corporation disputes Trump’s claim that the documentary was available on BritBox and emphasizes the program never aired in the U.S. The BBC will note the disputed footage comprises approximately 15 seconds of an hour-long documentary that extensively featured Trump supporters and provided balanced campaign coverage.\n\n\tThe controversy centers on how “Panorama” condensed Trump’s speech before the U.S. Capitol riot. Trump originally told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” More than 50 minutes later in the address, he said: “And we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\t\n\n\tThe documentary edited these segments together, showing Trump saying: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol… and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\n\tWhile the BBC has apologized for the edit and acknowledged it created “the mistaken impression” that Trump had “made a direct call for violent action,” the broadcaster rejected Trump’s compensation demands and maintains there is no basis for a defamation claim.\n\n\tThe BBC will also ask the court to pause pre-trial evidence exchange procedures until a ruling on the dismissal motion is issued.\n\n\tIf the case proceeds, a trial date in 2027 has been proposed. The BBC previously indicated in December it would defend against the lawsuit.\n\n\tA BBC spokesperson told Variety: “As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case. We are not going to make further comment on ongoing legal proceedings.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPhilippine theater actor Lhorvie Nuevo-Tadioan has secured the title role in director Sonny Calvento‘s “Mother Maybe,” joining previously announced star Anthony Jennings, Southern Lantern Studios revealed.\n\n\tThe horror-comedy-drama, a tri-national co-production between Southern Lantern Studios (Philippines), E&W Films (Singapore) and Volos Films Ltd. (Taiwan), follows Marco (Jennings), a young man who reunites with his long-lost mother during a high-stakes Asian game show, only to discover she transforms into something monstrous at night. Nuevo-Tadioan will play Minda, the mother at the center of the supernatural narrative.\n\t\n\n\tIn the role, Nuevo-Tadioan portrays a parent who communicates minimally and keeps much of her emotional life hidden. The character required a performer who can build tension through what goes unexpressed – through hidden truths, contained feelings and deliberate physical choices. The film uses supernatural horror to examine the overseas Filipino worker experience and the emotional toll of migration. \n\n\n\tThe casting represents just Nuevo-Tadioan’s second film project –  after her screen debut in “Phantosmia,” a film by director Lav Diaz that premiered at the Venice Film Festival – though she brings extensive stage credentials to the production. A veteran member of Tanghalang Pilipino – the Cultural Center of the Philippines’ resident theater company – Nuevo-Tadioan has built a reputation for performances requiring both emotional depth and physical discipline.\n\n\tHer work in “Anak Datu” brought her dual honors: the Gawad Buhay Award for Outstanding Performer and the Aliw Award for Best Featured Performer. Playing the character Potri Loling without any spoken lines, Nuevo-Tadioan demonstrated an ability to convey complex emotional states through physical performance alone.\n\t\n\n\tThat particular skill caught Calvento’s attention. “In theater, Lhorvie carries an extraordinary authority,” Calvento said. “What moved me most was her ability to hold an audience even in silence. She doesn’t need dialogue to be felt – her body and stillness already speak.”\n\n\tThe director also praised Nuevo-Tadioan’s natural screen presence. “There’s something deeply cinematic about her,” he added. “The smallest shift in her movement, the way she holds a pause. Those nuances already tell a story. That’s essential for this role.”\n\n\tCalvento believes Nuevo-Tadioan’s stage training has prepared her to maintain the role’s understated intensity and emotional complexity.\n\n\tProduction on the film resumes in February. The project has secured significant industry recognition, winning the TAICCA Development Grant at Full Circle Lab Philippines and the Malaysian Development Lab for Feature Films in 2022, followed by the TAICCA x CNC Award for Best Project and the MPA Grand Award at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest in 2023.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNBC will no longer air an upcoming episode of “Law & Order: SVU” in which Timothy Busfield appears in a guest star role. \n\n\tVariety has confirmed that the broadcast network has shelved the episode, which was set to air on Jan. 15. Instead, NBC will air the “SVU” episode originally scheduled to air on Jan. 22. Busfield was set to play a judge in the now pulled “SVU” episode, which is titled “Corrosive.” He previously guest starred on the long-running series in 2011 and directed two other episodes in 2019.\n\t\n\n\tIt was recently reported that an arrest warrant was issued for Busfield in New Mexico on charges of sexual abuse involving a minor. The accusations stem from his time as director on the Fox drama series “The Cleaning Lady.” One of a pair of twin boys who worked on the show claims that Busfield touched his “private areas” when he was seven years old, and again when he was eight, while they were on set. \n\n\n\tWarner Bros. Television, which produced “The Cleaning Lady,” had conducted an internal investigation into Busfield’s behavior towards the boys onset in 2025 following an anonymous tip involving a separate incident. The studio previously issued a statement regarding the accusations stating: \n\n\t“The health and safety of our cast and crew is always our top priority, especially the safety of minors on our productions. We take all allegations of misconduct very seriously and have systems in place to promptly and thoroughly investigate, and when needed, take appropriate action. We are aware of the current charges against Mr. Busfield and have been and will continue to cooperate with law enforcement.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn this week’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart covered the whirlwind of stories from over the weekend, which included Donald Trump’s handling of Venezuela after the capture of Nicolás Maduro, proposed U.S. millitary action in Cuba, Greenland and Iran, as well as backlash from the shooting death of Renee Good, a 37 year old American citizen who was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minnesota.\n\n\t“How was your weekend? Was it good?” Stewart said at the top of Monday’s show. “How was your weekend? Yeah. What the fuck is happening? What the fuck is happening in this country? From Minnesota, to Venezuela, to Iran, to Greenland, Cuba, Mexico, Colombia.”\n\t\n\n\tStewart went on to say that with all the chaos happening in the U.S., it feels like America is on the “Donald Trump gravitron,” adding, “We don’t know what up or down is. We just know it feels like we are all going to vomit.”\n\n\n\tThe late-night pundit deemed Trump “the catalyst of all this chaos and confusion,” and slammed the president for “TGIFing” it while the rest of the world scrambles for stability.\n\n\t“Meanwhile, our state department says, ‘If you’re an American, there are armed gangs [in Venezuela] trying to kill you,’” Stewart said. “So you would think that maybe this calls for a little gathering in the situation tent or wherever is operationally right for talking about Venezuela right now. But the president had a different idea.”\n\n\tStewart then cut to a clip from ABC News, reporting that over the weekend, Trump gathered “top oil executives at the White House to talk about divvying up Venezuela’s oil.”\n\t\n\n\t“What the fuck is happening?” the late-night pundit exclaimed. “By the way, lest you worry that Donald Trump is in any way feeling the burden of this moment, the terrifying responsibility of so many lives held in his hands. Let me reassure you, he’s fine.”\n\n\tThe show then cut to a clip from the meeting, in which Trump interrupts the sit-down to look out the window and admire the construction of his new ballroom.\n\n\t“And look at Rubio and Vance,” Stewart joked. “Look at the faces on Heckle and Jeckle over here. Looking like, ‘Oh! Pawpaw! He is so cute! You should see him when the ice cream truck goes by!’”\n\n\tWatch the entire monologue below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tFans of chef René Redzepi and his groundbreaking Noma restaurant can start getting in line on Monday, Jan. 26 for the Los Angeles residency this spring. Well, not literally in line, since the Noma will pop-up at what is reportedly a historic venue in a Silver Lake residential neighborhood where the address won’t be revealed until reservations are made. \n\n\tAspiring diners can sign up for Noma’s newsletter by Jan. 23 to have a chance at reservations that will be released starting Jan. 26 — as long as they agree to a crew filming on the premises during service for a future documentary project. If a reservation is granted, the $1500 per person is due immediately — though it will include beverage pairing, tax and tip.\n\t\n\n\tFounded in Copenhagen in 2003, Noma has been named the world’s No. 1 restaurant four times and its elaborate tasting menus emphasize foraging, fermentation and local ingredients in conversation with Redzepi’s Nordic roots.\n\n\n\tRedzepi is going to great lengths to establish the L.A. outpost from March 11 to June 26. After previous residencies in cities including Tokyo, Kyoto and Tulum, Mexico, the L.A. location will be the first longer-term project in the U.S. outside of a four-day stint in Brooklyn in 2022. Also planned for somewhere in Silver Lake is a Noma Projects shop where housemade items such as vinegar, garum and coffee will be for sale. \n\n\tRedzepi explained in a statement how he chose the location. “It had to be Los Angeles,” he wrote. “I love this region. The vast Pacific. The farmers’ markets overflowing with produce in the middle of January. A place where you can have tacos for breakfast and a Thai tasting menu in an alleyway for dinner. Oaxacan mole from a strip mall. A great-grandmother’s kimchi soup served at 2 a.m. in Koreatown.\n\t\n\n\t“L.A. is a city of wild contrasts — a place that makes you ask: how can these things go together?”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRedzepi is considering using California-sourced ingredients including cactus, crab, citrus and flowers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAudrey Ma\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“For this residency, our work will be shaped by the landscapes surrounding the city — from the Pacific to the mountains and deserts beyond — and by the people who know them best,” the Noma team added in a statement. “We’ve spent the past few months listening, learning, and building a new pantry of flavors rooted in this place, filtered through our imagination and the experience we bring with us from Copenhagen. We can’t wait to share this work over the next coming months.”\n\n\tIn addition to collaborations with other L.A. restaurants, Redzepi will bring other chefs from Copenhagen for pop-ups, and his MAD non-profit will host talks like the October event that included director Lulu Wang.\n\n\tRedzepi is bringing numerous kitchen staffers, their families and children to L.A., which explains part of the high cost of the meal. The restaurant will also provide work experience and mentorships to students from underserved communities. \n",

    "body": "\n\tElliot Page and Naomi Watts are among the bold-faced names starring a new American Civil Liberties Union public awareness campaign in support of transgender youth.\n\n\tLaunching Monday ahead of oral arguments at the U.S. Supreme Court in West Virginia v. BPJ Little v. Hecox — two cases challenging state laws that ban transgender girls from participating in school sports — More Than A Game also features Megan Rapinoe, Sue Bird, Benito Skinner, Brianna Turner, Naomi Watts, and a group of young people, including the lead plaintiff in one of the cases.\n\t\n\n\tThe campaign includes photos and videos of participants wearing exclusive merchandise designed by award-winning fashion designer and ACLU Artist Ambassador Willy Chavarria. The photos were captured by artist and fashion photographer Collier Schorr and videography captured by Sundance award-winning writer and director Alessandra Lacorazza\n\n\n\t“This week the Supreme Court is set to consider a case that will have major implications for women’s sports, civil rights and the future of our country,” said U.S. Women’s National Team legend and two-time World Cup winner Rapinoe. “I am not going to be tricked into sacrificing hard fought civil rights protections because of anti-trans rhetoric. All women will be harmed if the Court rules against the young trans people at the center of these cases and I wanted to make unambiguously clear that I am on the side of equality and justice.”\n\n\tThe More Than A Game campaign’s first ad buys are during the Unrivaled women’s basketball series on Jan. 12 and will continue through in-person activations at Unrivaled playoff games in Miami in early March, featuring a 30-second ad with athletes, celebrities, artists, advocates and youth, both cisgender and transgender.\n\t\n\n\t“Supporting trans youth isn’t just about sports,” Skinner says in the 30-second video spot before Watts says, “It’s about freedom.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“This moment in our country’s history is a test of our willingness to stand up and speak out for the most vulnerable,” said the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project co-director Chase Strangio. “And while we will absolutely defend our rights and our humanity in the courts, we know that transgender people’s path out of this moment of crisis will also require a broad, diverse coalition leading change in our communities and our culture. More Than A Game is our rejection of the efforts to divide us against one another and is instead a call for the unity we need to defend the freedom we deserve on and off the field.”\n\n\tPage disclosed in a social media post five years ago that he was transgender. “”I love that I am trans. And I love that I am queer,” he wrote, in part, on Twitter.\n\n\tWatts’ daughter, Kai, with ex-husband Live Schreiber is trans. Kai, 17, is a model who has worked with has Valentino and Jason Wu. In May, she and her father and his wife Taylor attended Ali Forney Center’s A Place at the Table Gala in New York City. The center, which provides housing and support for homeless LGBTQ youth, currently serves more than 2,200 young people through its 24/7 Drop-In Center and network of 13 emergency and transitional housing sites.\n\n\tTo learn more about the ACLU campaign, go to aclu.org.\n\n",

It’s an exploration not just of the planet’s edges, but of some of the most extraordinary people living there. From the coldest ice to the deepest jungles, the beauty of our world inspired my every step with awe and hope.”\n\n\tThe National Geographic series was first announced back in February of 2022, though it was likely pushed back following the “Oscar slap” a month later. The show marks Smith’s third project with National Geographic, after “Welcome to Earth” and “One Strange Rock.”\n\n\t“Pole to Pole With Will Smith” premieres with back-to-back episodes on Jan. 13 with two new episodes airing each Tuesday evening, and a finale episode on Feb. 3. You can watch the show live online through Sling. The episodes stream on-demand on Disney+ and Hulu the next day.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHBO Max launches today in Italy with several Italian originals to follow soon, the standout one being Marco Bellocchio’s limited series “Portobello” that reconstructs one of the country’s most clamorous travesties of justice.\n\n\tThe HBO Max streaming service is also launching today, Jan. 13, in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein.\n\n\t“Portobello” – to which Variety has been given exclusive trailer access – is the true story of popular Italian TV host Enzo Tortora who, among other programs, conducted a primetime game show by the same title that aired on Italian state broadcaster RAI for seven seasons starting in 1977. The six-episode  show is a vivid account of how Tortora, in 1985, went from being a top-rated TV star to being wrongly convicted of conspiring with the Neapolitan crime syndicate known as Camorra.\n\t\n\n\tTortora is played by frequent Bellocchio collaborator Fabrizio Gifuni who starred as former Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro in Bellocchio’s previous limited TV series “Exterior Night,” about the 1978 kidnapping and assassination of the country’s leader by Red Brigades terrorists. \n\n\n\t“Portobello,” which premiered last September to positive reviews at the Venice Film Festival and travelled to Toronto and Busan, will be the first HBO Original Italian production to launch on the HBO Max streaming platform in Italy on Feb. 20.  \n\n\tThe series is produced by Mediawan-owned Our Films and Kavav Film, in co-production withArte France and in collaboration with RAI Fiction and The Apartment Pictures, a Fremantle company.It is produced by Lorenzo Mieli and Mario Gianani for Our Films, and by Simone Gattoni for Kavac Film.\n\t\n\n\tBellocchio’s series is expected to be available in coming months on HBO Max globally, including the U.S., U.K., Latin America and Europe, excluding France and Germany.\n\n\tOther upcoming HBO Max Italian originals include docuseries “Gina Lollobrigida: Diva Contesa,” exposing the battle over the legacy of a cinema icon, and “Saman,” depicting the struggle of a young Pakistani woman who was murdered by her own family in Northern Italia for refusing an arranged marriage.\n\n\tWatch the “Portobello” trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tYou may be a global comedy superstar, but that doesn’t get you out of spousal support duties at the Golden Globe Awards.\n\n\tKevin Hart exited the Beverly Hilton’s International Ballroom on Sunday night at the end of a long Golden Globe Awards ceremony holding up the long train of the beautiful beaded frock worn by his wife, Eniko Hart. Kevin Hart was a good sport about the whole thing, just as he was about the number of jokes and comments that came his way during the three hour and 15-minute ceremony.\n\t\n\n\tWith so many stars packed into a small space — enhanced with sushi and Champagne — the star-gazing is a huge part of the fun of going to the Globes IRL.\n\n\n\tHere’s a rundown of some things that you couldn’t see on TV:\n\n\tPower table: Keri Russell, Matthew Rhys, Claire Danes and “The Beast in Me” writer Daniel Pearle seemed to have a heck of a time at their table. Russell was animated in waving at friends and fans throughout the ceremony. Brett Goldstein, who sat at a neighboring table, had a chat with Rhys. Emma Stone also stopped by to talk with Russell. So did Jacob Elordi.\n\n\tHBO Max’s Sarah Aubrey and “The Pitt” executive producers John Wells and R. Scott Gemmill sat together with “Hacks” creators Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky. Aubrey and Wells celebrated with a first bump when “The Pitt” star Noah Wyle won for actor in a TV drama. The “Hacks” trio shot to their feet with applause and cheers when Jean Smart won for TV comedy actress. Wells and Gemmill later squeezed their way through the tables to collect their trophy for best drama series.\n\t\n\n\tTeyana Taylor demonstrated her roots as a choreographer by dancing all the way down the wings as the “One Battle After Another” star left the stage after winning the first trophy of the night, for film supporting actress in a comedy.\n\n\tPresenters pass the time: Queen Latifah bopped to Chic’s “Good Times” as she waited to hand out a trophy. Colman Domingo did the same to Kool and the Gang’s “Hollywood Swinging” as he waited for his presenter slot. Ayo Edebiri turned to someone in the crowd and made a heart sign with both hands as she waited for her moment alongside a very pregnant Hailee Steinfeld.\n\n\tBill Maher and Mel Robbins exchanged greetings during a commercial break. Same for Judd Apatow and Brett Goldstein.\n\n\tAnother power table: Sarah Snook and Elle Fanning sat with NBCUniversal’s Pearlena Igbokwe. That group rose up in applause when Amy Poehler won for best podcast.\n\n\t“The White Lotus” creator Mike White stood for Erin Doherty’s win for “Adolescence.”\n\n\tAdam Sandler and Dwayne Johnson stood to clap for Wagner Moura’s win for “The Secret Agent.”\n\n\tTed Sarandos, Nicole Avant and Guillermo del Toro stood up as the “Kpop Demon Hunters” stars claimed the original song prize for “Golden” and for animated film.\n\n\tNikki Glaser’s opening monologue played really well in the ballroom. It wasn’t tame, but it wasn’t vicious. She threaded the needle perfectly to get the crowd on her side.\n\n\tBy contrast, the one bit that went over like a lead balloon with the industry crowd was the moment when two UFC fighters briefly took the stage, followed by the wink-wink-nudge-nudge presenter banter between “Heated Rivalry” stars Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams. You can’t win ‘em all.\n\n\t(Pictured: Jacob Elordi and Teyana Taylor)\n",

    "body": "\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWelcome to Variety Awards HQ — your weekly command center for the Oscars race.\n\n\n\tIt’s January 12, 2026, and Oscar nomination voting is officially underway.\n\n\tAfter a quiet holiday break, the first 12 days of the new year have kicked the race into overdrive. Every strategist and studio is pounding the pavement, treating this final stretch like the last hour of Election Day: “If you’re in line, stay in line.” Translation: It’s a close race everywhere, and one more screening, one more call, and one more push could make all the difference.\n\n\n\tJust ask Fernanda Torres. Last year, she not only squeezed into the actress category for “I’m Still Here” but pulled her film along for the ride with a surprise best picture nomination. Do we have another one of those waiting for us?\n\t\n\n\tAs we head into the final stretch before nominations are revealed on January 22, here are the 20 questions keeping me up at night that I’m not going to answer here (at least not yet):\n\n\nWill “One Battle After Another” and/or “Sinners” tie or break the all-time Oscar nomination record of 14?\nIs there such a thing as too many non-English films in the race? Could vote-splitting become a factor?\nAfter the DGA and SAG matched 5/5 in directors (only the second time in history), will the Academy follow suit—or throw us a curveball with an international or under-the-radar filmmaker?\nThere’s always a “normal people” movie in the mix. Is that “F1,” “Wicked: For Good,” or “Avatar: Fire and Ash”?\nWill Golden Globe winner Wagner Moura (“The Secret Agent”) or Globe and SAG nominee Jesse Plemons (“Bugonia”) claim the final best actor slot? Or could we see a surprise entirely?\nWill Rose Byrne (“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”) and Kate Hudson (“Song Sung Blue”) become best actress nominees as the sole representatives for their films?\nPundits have locked in the same five men for supporting actor — Benicio Del Toro, Jacob Elordi, Paul Mescal, Sean Penn, and Stellan Skarsgård. But is that actually correct?\nHow many women from “Sentimental Value” will be nominated?\nAre the Oscars cool enough to nominate Amy Madigan, Miles Caton, and “The Ugly Stepsister” all in one year?\nDid the PGA nomination for “Weapons” signal a best original screenplay nod lurking? Or even best picture itself?\nWill “Bugonia” land one, or more technical nominations?\nDid the ASC snub for “Hamnet” (cinematographer Łukasz Żal) mean anything?\nWill production design and costume design recognize the same five films?\nCould there be a non-best picture nominee in film editing?\nWill “Sinners” score two original song nominations?\nCan Crunchyroll’s “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle” break into the animated feature lineup?\nWill Neon sweep all five international feature slots? “It Was Just an Accident” (France), “Sirât” (Spain), “The Secret Agent” (Brazil), “Sentimental Value” (Norway), and “No Other Choice” (South Korea).\nWill the Documentary Branch pull another jaw-dropper and snub the frontrunner—like they did with “Jane,” “Apollo 11,” “Three Identical Strangers,” and “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?”\nWhat are the casting directors ACTUALLY considering when voting on casting?\nWill I accurately predict the three shorts categories? (Spoiler: Probably not).\n\n\n\n\tOscar nomination voting closes Jan. 16 at 5 p.m. Pacific. Nominees will be announced Jan. 22.\n\n\tSee some of the highlights of the New Year below.\n\t\n\t\tAriana Grande Toasts the Art of Casting at Soho House West Hollywood and Says Goodbye to ‘Wicked’ at CAA\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn Monday, Jan. 5, a standing-room-only crowd packed Soho House West Hollywood as Ariana Grande moderated a spirited and insightful Q&A with casting directors Bernard Telsey and Tiffany Little Canfield. Balancing sharp humor with genuine admiration, Grande “roasted and toasted” her collaborators while guiding a conversation that demystified the casting process behind their blockbuster success. The lively exchange kept guild voters laughing while offering real insight into the creative decisions that shape a film from the ground up.\n\t\n\n\tThe next day on Jan. 6, demand was so high that attendees wrapped around CAA’s offices — with turnaways — for a screening and Q&A with Ariana Grande, moderated by Kevin McCarthy. Speaking candidly to a room filled with AMPAS members and industry insiders, Grande reflected on spending five years with the role in “Wicked: For Good,” framing the project as a heartfelt farewell. Following the Q&A, she stayed to mingle one-on-one with attendees, even FaceTiming children of guests, turning the event into a rare, personal moment of connection.\n\n\tVariety also sat down with the Golden Globe, Critics Choice and SAG nominated star, where she talked about her love for acting.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYorgos Lanthimos, Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons Draw Full House for All-Guild Q&A\t\n\n\tOn Jan. 7, a Los Angeles all-guild screening of “Bugonia” brought together director Yorgos Lanthimos, Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons for a wide-ranging Q&A moderated by Nathan Fielder. \n\n\tIt followed a week of events for the filmmaking team.\n\n\tOn Jan. 6, The American Cinematheque’s Aero Theatre hosted a packed screening and Q&A with Plemons, moderated by Adam Scott. Plemons offered thoughtful insight into his performance and the film’s darker comedic edge.\n\n\tAnd last weekend, screenwriter Will Tracy took center stage for an all-guild screening and Q&A, moderated by David Hemingson. \n\n\tJesse Plemons is also the cover story for this week’s Extra Edition of Variety, penned by yours truly. Give it a read!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tChloé Zhao Joins Seth Rogen at the Directors Guild\t\n\n\tA Los Angeles special screening of “Hamnet” featured a Q&A with director Chloé Zhao, Jessie Buckley, Jacobi Jupe, artisans and producers on Jan. 5. \n\n\tOn Wed. Jan. 7, Zhao returned for a Directors Guild screening and Q&A moderated by recent Golden Globe winner Seth Rogen, focusing on her approach to adaptation, tone and visual storytelling. \n\n\t\n\t\tDemi Moore and Al Pacino Stomp for Kate Hudson in ‘Song Sung Blue’\t\n\n\tSoho House hosted a Tastemaker screening and Q&A with Kate Hudson, moderated by Demi Moore. The evening drew a high-profile crowd of A-listers and Oscar nominees and winners including Leonardo DiCaprio, Al Pacino, Mark Ruffalo and David O. Russell — and showcased Hudson’s performance alongside a warm, reflective conversation.\n\n\tThe support is building for Hudson’s outstanding work in Craig Brewer’s impactful drama, which also stars Hugh Jackman.\n\n\tA special screening of “Song Sung Blue” paired director Craig Brewer and star Kate Hudson with moderator Rian Johnson for an engaging Q&A. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA – JANUARY 06: Rian Johnson, Kate Hudson and Craig Brewer seen at Focus Features’ “Song Sung Blue” Special Screening at DGA Theater Complex on January 06, 2026 in Los Angeles, California.

In 2023, newspapers began dropping his famous cartoon strip after he advised white people to \"get the f*** away\" from Black people in a controversial episode of his podcast.\n      \n    \n          At the time, Scott suspected his cartoons were actually removed because he started to comment on \"wokeness\" in his work.\n      \n    \n          He told Fox News, \"It was part of a larger overhaul, I believe, of comics, but why they decided what was in and what was out, that's not known to anybody except them, I guess.\"\n      \n    \n          During its prime, \"Dilbert\" was published in 2,000 newspapers in 65 countries.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Family\n              \n                          \n                Podcasts\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Books\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

He wrote he'd set up the GoFundMe, which has a goal of $550,000, \"after seeing all the media bs about a domestic terrorist\" -- referring to Good -- getting her own GoFundMe campaign.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Emmons wrote Ross' actions were \"1000 percent justified\" and said funds from the campaign were going to help the ICE agent.\n      \n\n          The campaign's biggest donor was billionaire businessman Bill Ackman, who donated a whopping $10,000 to the campaign. He justified his donation in a post on X, writing he wanted to donate the same amount to Good's campaign ... which was closed after it received more than $1.5 million in donations.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Ackman wrote he's a \"big believer in our legal principal that one is innocent until proven guilty,\" and described the whole situation as a tragedy.\n      \n    \n          It's unclear if Ross will be able to accept the donations ... federal government employees can't receive any supplementations to their salaries as compensation for their services, according to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.\n      \n    \n          However, government employees can solicit and accept gifts from people when it's clear the gift is motivated by a familial or personal relationship ... but not a federal position.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          FYI ... Ross shot Good in traffic on a residential street in Minneapolis last week, on January 7. Good attempted to drive away from the scene as ICE officers ordered her out of her Honda Pilot. Ross, standing at the front of her vehicle, fired three shots at Good, fatally striking her in the head. The intentions of Good and of Ross at the scene are both in dispute.\n      \n    \n          The Trump administration, including Vice President J.D. Vance and Kristi Noem, has praised Ross' actions, claiming he was acting in self-defense when he shot Good.\n      \n      ",

    "body": "\n\tBlack Mandala has picked up international sales rights to “The Realm of Eldervin,” a British fantasy feature from filmmaker Oliver Hollingdale.\n\n\tThe film centers on Jonas, a troubled practitioner of magic who assembles a group of companions – including rogue Dagon, elf Nimue and assassin Solomon – to investigate a mysterious corruption spreading through a quiet village in the mystical Realm of Eldervin. As they journey through haunted woodlands and forgotten ruins, the group discovers the darkness may be connected to their own pasts.\n\t\n\n\tThe cast includes Craig Standen, Tess Dimos, Lewis Sycamore and Martin Portlock, who recently gained attention through his appearance as “The Witch” on “Britain’s Got Talent” and his role as Peter Pan in “Neverland Nightmare” as part of “The Twisted Childhood Universe.” Jason Flemyng, known for his work in “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,” “Snatch,” “X-Men: First Class,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” and “Kick-Ass,” provides voiceover narration.\n\n\n\t“Our movie, at its core, is a grounded approach to fantasy, built on atmosphere, character, and emotional truth rather than relying on large-scale spectacle,” Hollingdale said. “I’ve always been drawn to stories where magic is ancient, intimate, and woven into the fabric of nature.”\n\n\tThe director cited “The Lord of the Rings,” “The Green Knight” and “The Fountain” as influences, noting the film blends mythic storytelling with emotional resonance.\n\n\t“The landscape of Eldervin is as much a character as any of the heroes,” Hollingdale added. “We embraced natural light, handcrafted textures, and moments of quiet surrealism to give the world a poetic, lived-in quality.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production features costume work by Norse Dragon Armoury, an original score by composer Siddhartha Barnhoorn and cinematography by Morgan Andrews. Palm Haven Studios and Morgan Films supported the production.\n\n\tAuckland-based Black Mandala, founded by Michael Kraetzer and Nicolas Onetti in 2017, handles more than 150 titles and specializes in independent horror and genre distribution.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs HBO Max goes live today in eight new European countries — including Germany, Italy and Austria — the streamer has announced a new bundling deal with Prime Video in those territories that extends their existing partnership in France, Spain, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands. \n\n\tThe global streaming service from Warner Bros. Discovery that operates in more than 100 countries has just added Italy, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Israel and Greece to its footprint as it moves closer to being available across all of Europe, with the U.K. and Ireland launching at the end of March. \n\t\n\n\tFollowing its announcement last week of a distribution deal with German’s RTL, HBO Max has now revealed that in Germany, besides Prime Video and RTL+, the service will be available on Waipu.tv. They have also struck deals in Switzerland deals with Sunrise and Swisscom. In Italy, customers of Telecom Italia’s TIM platform with also have HBO Max access.\n\n\n\tAs previously announced, for the first time, viewers in these territories will be able to enjoy content from HBO, Warner Bros. Pictures, Warner Bros. Television, the DC Universe and Max Originals all in one place. Some of the streamer’s most popular shows include “The Pitt,” “It: Welcome to Derry,” “House of the Dragon,” “The Last of Us,” “The White Lotus” and “Euphoria,” while movie offerings include “Superman,” “The Batman,” “Dune” and the “Harry Potter” franchise. The news also comes in time for the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026, which will broadcast live on HBO Max from Feb. 6 to 22.\n\t\n\n\t“It is exciting to kick off the new year by expanding into some of the biggest economies in the world, as we continue to deliver HBO Max to new viewers,” said JB Perrette, CEO and president of global streaming and games at Warner Bros. Discovery. “Next up is the launch of HBO Max in the U.K. and Ireland in late March, which will complete HBO Max’s rollout across Europe.”\n\n\tHBO Max, which first launched first in the U.S. in 2020, has since expanded across Latin America, Europe and Asia. For Q3 2025, Warner Bros. Discovery reported 128 million global streaming subscribers. \n\n\tThe bombshell news of Netflix’s acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery has cast some doubt over the future of HBO Max, but the streamer is forging ahead with its European expansion.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe BBC will file a motion to dismiss President Donald Trump‘s $10 billion defamation lawsuit, challenging the case on jurisdictional grounds and disputing claims the broadcaster acted with malice, according to court papers filed Monday and reported by BBC News.\n\n\tThe legal battle stems from fallout over a “Panorama” documentary’s controversial editing of Trump’s January 6, 2021 speech – an issue that contributed to the November resignations of BBC director–general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness after an internal memo criticizing the edit leaked publicly.\n\t\n\n\tTrump filed the lawsuit in a Florida court last month, alleging defamation and trade practices violations. The BBC’s planned defense will argue the Florida court lacks proper jurisdiction over the British broadcaster and that Trump has failed to demonstrate a valid legal claim, court documents cited by BBC News show.\n\n\n\tCentral to the BBC’s defense strategy is the argument that Trump cannot prove actual damages from the program, which aired before he won re-election and carried Florida by a commanding margin. The broadcaster will also maintain Trump cannot establish the documentary was produced with “actual malice” – a critical threshold in U.S. defamation law.\n\n\tThe corporation disputes Trump’s claim that the documentary was available on BritBox and emphasizes the program never aired in the U.S. The BBC will note the disputed footage comprises approximately 15 seconds of an hour-long documentary that extensively featured Trump supporters and provided balanced campaign coverage.\n\n\tThe controversy centers on how “Panorama” condensed Trump’s speech before the U.S. Capitol riot. Trump originally told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” More than 50 minutes later in the address, he said: “And we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\t\n\n\tThe documentary edited these segments together, showing Trump saying: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol… and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\n\tWhile the BBC has apologized for the edit and acknowledged it created “the mistaken impression” that Trump had “made a direct call for violent action,” the broadcaster rejected Trump’s compensation demands and maintains there is no basis for a defamation claim.\n\n\tThe BBC will also ask the court to pause pre-trial evidence exchange procedures until a ruling on the dismissal motion is issued.\n\n\tIf the case proceeds, a trial date in 2027 has been proposed. The BBC previously indicated in December it would defend against the lawsuit.\n\n\tA BBC spokesperson told Variety: “As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case. We are not going to make further comment on ongoing legal proceedings.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tHBO Max launches today in Italy with several Italian originals to follow soon, the standout one being Marco Bellocchio’s limited series “Portobello” that reconstructs one of the country’s most clamorous travesties of justice.\n\n\tThe HBO Max streaming service is also launching today, Jan. 13, in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein.\n\n\t“Portobello” – to which Variety has been given exclusive trailer access – is the true story of popular Italian TV host Enzo Tortora who, among other programs, conducted a primetime game show by the same title that aired on Italian state broadcaster RAI for seven seasons starting in 1977. The six-episode  show is a vivid account of how Tortora, in 1985, went from being a top-rated TV star to being wrongly convicted of conspiring with the Neapolitan crime syndicate known as Camorra.\n\t\n\n\tTortora is played by frequent Bellocchio collaborator Fabrizio Gifuni who starred as former Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro in Bellocchio’s previous limited TV series “Exterior Night,” about the 1978 kidnapping and assassination of the country’s leader by Red Brigades terrorists. \n\n\n\t“Portobello,” which premiered last September to positive reviews at the Venice Film Festival and travelled to Toronto and Busan, will be the first HBO Original Italian production to launch on the HBO Max streaming platform in Italy on Feb. 20.  \n\n\tThe series is produced by Mediawan-owned Our Films and Kavav Film, in co-production withArte France and in collaboration with RAI Fiction and The Apartment Pictures, a Fremantle company.It is produced by Lorenzo Mieli and Mario Gianani for Our Films, and by Simone Gattoni for Kavac Film.\n\t\n\n\tBellocchio’s series is expected to be available in coming months on HBO Max globally, including the U.S., U.K., Latin America and Europe, excluding France and Germany.\n\n\tOther standout HBO Max Italian originals in the pipeline include “In Utero” a series set in a Barcelona fertility clinic starring Sergio Castellitto (“Conclave”), directed by Maria Sole Tognazzi (“Petra”), and produced by ITV-owned Cattleya in association with Paramount Television International Studio. The lineup also includes previously announced docuseries “Gina Lollobrigida: Diva Contesa,” exposing the battle over the legacy of the cinema icon, and “Saman,” depicting the struggle of a young Pakistani woman who was murdered by her own family in Northern Italia for refusing an arranged marriage.\n\n\tWatch the “Portobello” trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tYou may be a global comedy superstar, but that doesn’t get you out of spousal support duties at the Golden Globe Awards.\n\n\tKevin Hart exited the Beverly Hilton’s International Ballroom on Sunday night at the end of a long Golden Globe Awards ceremony holding up the long train of the beautiful beaded frock worn by his wife, Eniko Hart. Kevin Hart was a good sport about the whole thing, just as he was about the number of jokes and comments that came his way during the three hour and 15-minute ceremony.\n\t\n\n\tWith so many stars packed into a small space — enhanced with sushi and Champagne — the star-gazing is a huge part of the fun of going to the Globes IRL.\n\n\n\tHere’s a rundown of some things that you couldn’t see on TV:\n\n\tPower table: Keri Russell, Matthew Rhys, Claire Danes and “The Beast in Me” writer Daniel Pearle seemed to have a heck of a time at their table. Russell was animated in waving at friends and fans throughout the ceremony. Brett Goldstein, who sat at a neighboring table, had a chat with Rhys. Emma Stone also stopped by to talk with Russell. So did Jacob Elordi.\n\n\tHBO Max’s Sarah Aubrey and “The Pitt” executive producers John Wells and R. Scott Gemmill sat together with “Hacks” creators Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky. Aubrey and Wells celebrated with a first bump when “The Pitt” star Noah Wyle won for actor in a TV drama. The “Hacks” trio shot to their feet with applause and cheers when Jean Smart won for TV comedy actress. Wells and Gemmill later squeezed their way through the tables to collect their trophy for best drama series.\n\t\n\n\tTeyana Taylor demonstrated her roots as a choreographer by dancing all the way down the wings as the “One Battle After Another” star left the stage after winning the first trophy of the night, for film supporting actress in a comedy.\n\n\tPresenters pass the time: Queen Latifah bopped to Chic’s “Good Times” as she waited to hand out a trophy. Colman Domingo did the same to Kool and the Gang’s “Hollywood Swinging” as he waited for his presenter slot. Ayo Edebiri turned to someone in the crowd and made a heart sign with both hands as she waited for her moment alongside a very pregnant Hailee Steinfeld.\n\n\tBill Maher and Mel Robbins exchanged greetings during a commercial break. Same for Judd Apatow and Brett Goldstein.\n\n\tAnother power table: Sarah Snook and Elle Fanning sat with NBCUniversal’s Pearlena Igbokwe. That group rose up in applause when Amy Poehler won for best podcast.\n\n\t“The White Lotus” creator Mike White stood for Erin Doherty’s win for “Adolescence.”\n\n\tAdam Sandler and Dwayne Johnson stood to clap for Wagner Moura’s win for “The Secret Agent.”\n\n\tTed Sarandos, Nicole Avant and Guillermo del Toro stood up as the “Kpop Demon Hunters” stars claimed the original song prize for “Golden” and for animated film.\n\n\tNikki Glaser’s opening monologue played really well in the ballroom. It wasn’t tame, but it wasn’t vicious. She threaded the needle perfectly to get the crowd on her side.\n\n\tBy contrast, the one bit that went over like a lead balloon with the industry crowd was the moment when two UFC fighters briefly took the stage, followed by the wink-wink-nudge-nudge presenter banter between “Heated Rivalry” stars Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams. You can’t win ‘em all.\n\n\t(Pictured: Jacob Elordi and Teyana Taylor)\n",

Instead, NBC will air the “SVU” episode originally scheduled to air on Jan. 22. Busfield was set to play a judge in the now pulled “SVU” episode, which is titled “Corrosive.” He previously guest starred on the long-running series in 2011 and directed two other episodes in 2019.\n\t\n\n\tIt was recently reported that an arrest warrant was issued for Busfield in New Mexico on charges of sexual abuse involving a minor. The accusations stem from his time as director on the Fox drama series “The Cleaning Lady.” One of a pair of twin boys who worked on the show claims that Busfield touched his “private areas” when he was seven years old, and again when he was eight, while they were on set. \n\n\n\tWarner Bros. Television, which produced “The Cleaning Lady,” had conducted an internal investigation into Busfield’s behavior towards the boys onset in 2025 following an anonymous tip involving a separate incident. The studio previously issued a statement regarding the accusations stating: \n\n\t“The health and safety of our cast and crew is always our top priority, especially the safety of minors on our productions. We take all allegations of misconduct very seriously and have systems in place to promptly and thoroughly investigate, and when needed, take appropriate action. We are aware of the current charges against Mr. Busfield and have been and will continue to cooperate with law enforcement.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPhilippine theater actor Lhorvie Nuevo-Tadioan has secured the title role in director Sonny Calvento‘s “Mother Maybe,” joining previously announced star Anthony Jennings, Southern Lantern Studios revealed.\n\n\tThe horror-comedy-drama, a tri-national co-production between Southern Lantern Studios (Philippines), E&W Films (Singapore) and Volos Films Ltd. (Taiwan), follows Marco (Jennings), a young man who reunites with his long-lost mother during a high-stakes Asian game show, only to discover she transforms into something monstrous at night. Nuevo-Tadioan will play Minda, the mother at the center of the supernatural narrative.\n\t\n\n\tIn the role, Nuevo-Tadioan portrays a parent who communicates minimally and keeps much of her emotional life hidden. The character required a performer who can build tension through what goes unexpressed – through hidden truths, contained feelings and deliberate physical choices. The film uses supernatural horror to examine the overseas Filipino worker experience and the emotional toll of migration. \n\n\n\tThe casting represents just Nuevo-Tadioan’s second film project –  after her screen debut in “Phantosmia,” a film by director Lav Diaz that premiered at the Venice Film Festival – though she brings extensive stage credentials to the production. A veteran member of Tanghalang Pilipino – the Cultural Center of the Philippines’ resident theater company – Nuevo-Tadioan has built a reputation for performances requiring both emotional depth and physical discipline.\n\n\tHer work in “Anak Datu” brought her dual honors: the Gawad Buhay Award for Outstanding Performer and the Aliw Award for Best Featured Performer. Playing the character Potri Loling without any spoken lines, Nuevo-Tadioan demonstrated an ability to convey complex emotional states through physical performance alone.\n\t\n\n\tThat particular skill caught Calvento’s attention. “In theater, Lhorvie carries an extraordinary authority,” Calvento said. “What moved me most was her ability to hold an audience even in silence. She doesn’t need dialogue to be felt – her body and stillness already speak.”\n\n\tThe director also praised Nuevo-Tadioan’s natural screen presence. “There’s something deeply cinematic about her,” he added. “The smallest shift in her movement, the way she holds a pause. Those nuances already tell a story. That’s essential for this role.”\n\n\tCalvento believes Nuevo-Tadioan’s stage training has prepared her to maintain the role’s understated intensity and emotional complexity.\n\n\tProduction on the film resumes in February. The project has secured significant industry recognition, winning the TAICCA Development Grant at Full Circle Lab Philippines and the Malaysian Development Lab for Feature Films in 2022, followed by the TAICCA x CNC Award for Best Project and the MPA Grand Award at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest in 2023.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFans of chef René Redzepi and his groundbreaking Noma restaurant can start getting in line on Monday, Jan. 26 for the Los Angeles residency this spring. Well, not literally in line, since the Noma will pop-up at what is reportedly a historic venue in a Silver Lake residential neighborhood where the address won’t be revealed until reservations are made. \n\n\tAspiring diners can sign up for Noma’s newsletter by Jan. 23 to have a chance at reservations that will be released starting Jan. 26 — as long as they agree to a crew filming on the premises during service for a future documentary project. If a reservation is granted, the $1500 per person is due immediately — though it will include beverage pairing, tax and tip.\n\t\n\n\tFounded in Copenhagen in 2003, Noma has been named the world’s No. 1 restaurant four times and its elaborate tasting menus emphasize foraging, fermentation and local ingredients in conversation with Redzepi’s Nordic roots.\n\n\n\tRedzepi is going to great lengths to establish the L.A. outpost from March 11 to June 26. After previous residencies in cities including Tokyo, Kyoto and Tulum, Mexico, the L.A. location will be the first longer-term project in the U.S. outside of a four-day stint in Brooklyn in 2022. Also planned for somewhere in Silver Lake is a Noma Projects shop where housemade items such as vinegar, garum and coffee will be for sale. \n\n\tRedzepi explained in a statement how he chose the location. “It had to be Los Angeles,” he wrote. “I love this region. The vast Pacific. The farmers’ markets overflowing with produce in the middle of January. A place where you can have tacos for breakfast and a Thai tasting menu in an alleyway for dinner. Oaxacan mole from a strip mall. A great-grandmother’s kimchi soup served at 2 a.m. in Koreatown.\n\t\n\n\t“L.A. is a city of wild contrasts — a place that makes you ask: how can these things go together?”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRedzepi is considering using California-sourced ingredients including cactus, crab, citrus and flowers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAudrey Ma\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“For this residency, our work will be shaped by the landscapes surrounding the city — from the Pacific to the mountains and deserts beyond — and by the people who know them best,” the Noma team added in a statement. “We’ve spent the past few months listening, learning, and building a new pantry of flavors rooted in this place, filtered through our imagination and the experience we bring with us from Copenhagen. We can’t wait to share this work over the next coming months.”\n\n\tIn addition to collaborations with other L.A. restaurants, Redzepi will bring other chefs from Copenhagen for pop-ups, and his MAD non-profit will host talks like the October event that included director Lulu Wang.\n\n\tRedzepi is bringing numerous kitchen staffers, their families and children to L.A., which explains part of the high cost of the meal. The restaurant will also provide work experience and mentorships to students from underserved communities. \n",

    "body": "\n\tElliot Page and Naomi Watts are among the bold-faced names starring in a new American Civil Liberties Union public awareness campaign in support of transgender youth.\n\n\tLaunching Monday ahead of oral arguments at the U.S. Supreme Court in West Virginia v. BPJ Little v. Hecox — two cases challenging state laws that ban transgender girls from participating in school sports — “More Than a Game” also features Megan Rapinoe, Sue Bird, Benito Skinner, Brianna Turner, Naomi Watts and a group of young people, including the lead plaintiff in one of the cases.\n\t\n\n\tThe campaign includes photos and videos of participants wearing exclusive merchandise designed by award-winning fashion designer and ACLU artist ambassador Willy Chavarria. The photos were captured by artist and fashion photographer Collier Schorr and videography captured by Sundance award-winning writer and director Alessandra Lacorazza.\n\n\n\t“This week the Supreme Court is set to consider a case that will have major implications for women’s sports, civil rights and the future of our country,” said U.S. Women’s National Team legend and two-time World Cup winner Rapinoe. “I am not going to be tricked into sacrificing hard fought civil rights protections because of anti-trans rhetoric. All women will be harmed if the Court rules against the young trans people at the center of these cases and I wanted to make unambiguously clear that I am on the side of equality and justice.”\n\n\tThe “More Than a Game” campaign’s first ad buys are during the Unrivaled women’s basketball series on Jan. 12 and will continue through in-person activations at Unrivaled playoff games in Miami in early March, featuring a 30-second ad with athletes, celebrities, artists, advocates and youth, both cisgender and transgender.\n\t\n\n\t“Supporting trans youth isn’t just about sports,” Skinner says in the 30-second video spot, before Watts says: “It’s about freedom.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“This moment in our country’s history is a test of our willingness to stand up and speak out for the most vulnerable,” said the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project co-director Chase Strangio. “And while we will absolutely defend our rights and our humanity in the courts, we know that transgender people’s path out of this moment of crisis will also require a broad, diverse coalition leading change in our communities and our culture. More Than A Game is our rejection of the efforts to divide us against one another and is instead a call for the unity we need to defend the freedom we deserve on and off the field.”\n\n\tPage disclosed in a social media post five years ago that he was transgender. “I love that I am trans. And I love that I am queer,” he wrote.\n\n\tWatts’ daughter with ex-husband Liev Schreiber, Kai, is trans. Kai, 17, is a model who has worked with Valentino and Jason Wu. In May, she and her father and his wife Taylor attended Ali Forney Center’s A Place at the Table Gala in New York City. The center, which provides housing and support for homeless LGBTQ youth, currently serves more than 2,200 young people through its 24/7 Drop-In Center and network of 13 emergency and transitional housing sites.\n\n\tTo learn more about the ACLU campaign, go to aclu.org.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn this week’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart covered the whirlwind of stories from over the weekend, which included Donald Trump’s handling of Venezuela after the capture of Nicolás Maduro, proposed U.S. millitary action in Cuba, Greenland and Iran, as well as backlash from the shooting death of Renee Good, a 37 year old American citizen who was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minnesota.\n\n\t“How was your weekend? Was it good?” Stewart said at the top of Monday’s show. “How was your weekend? Yeah. What the fuck is happening? What the fuck is happening in this country? From Minnesota, to Venezuela, to Iran, to Greenland, Cuba, Mexico, Colombia.”\n\t\n\n\tStewart went on to say that with all the chaos happening in the U.S., it feels like America is on the “Donald Trump gravitron,” adding, “We don’t know what up or down is. We just know it feels like we are all going to vomit.”\n\n\n\tThe late-night pundit deemed Trump “the catalyst of all this chaos and confusion,” and slammed the president for “TGIFing” it while the rest of the world scrambles for stability.\n\n\t“Meanwhile, our state department says, ‘If you’re an American, there are armed gangs [in Venezuela] trying to kill you,’” Stewart said. “So you would think that maybe this calls for a little gathering in the situation tent or wherever is operationally right for talking about Venezuela right now. But the president had a different idea.”\n\n\tStewart then cut to a clip from ABC News, reporting that over the weekend, Trump gathered “top oil executives at the White House to talk about divvying up Venezuela’s oil.”\n\t\n\n\t“What the fuck is happening?” the late-night pundit exclaimed. “By the way, lest you worry that Donald Trump is in any way feeling the burden of this moment, the terrifying responsibility of so many lives held in his hands. Let me reassure you, he’s fine.”\n\n\tThe show then cut to a clip from the meeting, in which Trump interrupts the sit-down to look out the window and admire the construction of his new ballroom.\n\n\t“And look at Rubio and Vance,” Stewart joked. “Look at the faces on Heckle and Jeckle over here. Looking like, ‘Oh! Pawpaw! He is so cute! You should see him when the ice cream truck goes by!’”\n\n\tWatch the entire monologue below. \n\n\n\n",

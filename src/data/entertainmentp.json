    "body": "\n\tThomas Dewitt Causey, Jr., a veteran production sound mixer who worked on films like “Dick Tracy” and “Broadcast News,” died on Sunday in Cathedral City, Calif., after a battle with a long illness. He was 76.\n\n\tHis death was confirmed by his daughter-in-law, Crystal Causey.\n\n\tCausey worked as a sound mixer on over 85 films throughout his four decades in Hollywood. He was nominated for an Oscar for his work on Warren Beatty’s 1990 film “Dick Tracy.” His other major credits included “Gardens of Stone,” “The Fisher King,” “Bulworth” and “Defending Your Life.” He was also a frequent collaborator of horror icon John Carpenter. They made 11 films together, including all three “Halloween” films, “Escape from New York,” “Escape from L.A.” “The Thing,” “Big Trouble in Little China,” “Christine,” “Starman,” “Prince of Darkness” and “Village of the Damned.”\n\t\n\n\tBorn in New Orleans in 1949, Causey fell in love with the business while working as a driver for the sound team of a British production that was shooting in Louisiana. That experience pushed him to purchase his first sound equipment with a $5,000 loan from his father, and he worked on local film shoots and recorded live albums for local jazz musicians. In 1977, he moved to L.A. with his wife to pursue a career in sound mixing. The move was spurred by a court ruling that opened up IATSE membership for any non-union sound mixer who worked at least 90 days on L.A. sets in the last year.\n\n\n\tCausey is survived by his wife, Christina Causey, his son, Jesse Causey, and his brother, Matthew Causey.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBare Knuckle Fighting Championship and Bare Knuckle Fight League are making their official entry into India, marking a significant expansion into one of the world’s largest combat sports markets.\n\n\tThe move is being spearheaded by World League of Fighters, BKFC’s license holder, which is co-founded by Rajesh Banga, Sunil Mathew and Siraj Gill. The organization has brought in prominent film producer Parag Sanghvi and Bollywood star and martial artist Tiger Shroff to join the board alongside BKFC founder and president David Feldman and former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor, who became a part-owner of BFKC in 2024. \n\t\n\n\tWLF previously delivered a sold-out BKFC event in Dubai last year, which the organization describes as the biggest bare-knuckle fighting event held in the Middle East.\n\n\n\tThe India expansion will introduce a team-based bare-knuckle league format – marking the first time such a structure has been implemented in the history of the sport. The format will feature six inaugural teams: Crushers, Punishers, Warriors, Phantoms, Gladiators and Infernos, transforming individual fights into a franchise-based competition.\n\n\tRahul Saxena has been appointed CEO to lead the platform. He brings experience in scaling global brands to the role.\n\n\t“India is not just a market – it is the future of global combat sports,” Banga, Mathew and Gill said in a joint statement. “Together with BKFC, BKFL and WLF, we are building an ecosystem that will develop Indian fighters, create global stars and deliver world-class fight entertainment to millions of fans.”\n\t\n\n\tSanghvi positioned the venture as an opportunity to build a sports intellectual property from India with global reach. “This is where world-class storytelling meets raw, uncompromising sport,” he said. “With WLF, BKFC and Conor McGregor, we are not just launching a league – we are architecting a global sports IP from India that will command attention, talent and fandom worldwide.”\n\n\tFeldman emphasized India’s longstanding position in the organization’s expansion strategy. “India has been on our roadmap for a long time,” he said. “The scale, the energy, the culture — there is no place like it. With the leadership team we have assembled and our partnership with WLF, we are bringing the purest form of combat sports to a nation ready for it.”\n\n\tMcGregor, who serves as a global partner for BKFC, framed the expansion as transformative. “India has warriors in its DNA,” he said. “What we’re building with BKFC and BKFL in India will be something the world has never seen before. This is not just expansion – this is a revolution.”\n\n\tShroff, joining McGregor as a board member, highlighted the cultural significance of the venture. “Honored to stand alongside Conor McGregor as we create something truly historic for Indian sport,” he said. “This is more than a fight – it’s a global movement, and history is being written. Just like cinema, sport is a celebration of talent and skill, and Parag [Sanghvi] and I are committed to turning this into a landmark moment for India.”\n\n\tThe first official BKFC and BKFL team-based events are scheduled for 2026, with venue and fight card details to be announced.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has greenlit production on “The Dealer,” a Korean casino crime drama produced by “Squid Game” creator Hwang Dong-hyuk, and revealed its principal cast.\n\n\tThe drama centers on Geonhwa, a skilled casino dealer whose marriage preparations unravel after falling victim to a housing fraud scheme. Drawn back into a realm she previously chose to escape, Geonhwa descends into gambling’s treacherous underworld and must deploy long-concealed abilities to reclaim agency over her circumstances. Ohnooy and Lee Tae-young penned the screenplay. \n\t\n\n\tJung So-min (“Love Reset,” “Alchemy of Souls”) headlines as Geonhwa, portraying a dealer who has spent years repressing capabilities that provide her with an extraordinary advantage at gaming tables.\n\n\n\tRyoo Seung-bum (“Good News,” “Tazza: One Eyed Jack”) takes on the role of Hwang Chisu, a financially struggling gambler surviving through precarious wagers who gets drawn into Geonhwa’s perilous scheme.\n\n\tLee Soo-hyuk (“S Line,” “Queen Woo”) portrays Jo Jun, a formidable casino competitor whose keen instincts and inscrutable demeanor position him as an unpredictable presence.\n\n\tRyu Kyung-soo (“The Bequeathed,” “Jung_E”) plays Choi Wooseung, Geonhwa’s fiancé, whose gentle domestic persona stands in sharp contrast to his determined approach as a detective.\n\n\tThe series represents the directorial debut of celebrated cinematographer Choi Young-hwan, whose credits include “Smugglers,” “Veteran,” “Tazza: The High Rollers” and “The Thieves.” Choi has earned recognition for dynamic visual work that enhances genre narratives. Hwang joins the project as producer, assembling a seasoned creative team with credits spanning some of Korea’s prominent entertainment properties.\n\t\n\n\tFirstman Studio, the production company behind “Squid Game,” is producing “The Dealer.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tLionsgate has sold its South Asian and Southeast Asian streaming operation Lionsgate Play to Rohit Jain, the executive who developed the service during an eight-year tenure as president of Lionsgate Play Asia.\n\n\tThe studio disclosed the deal Tuesday. Jain will leave Lionsgate to take ownership of the streaming platform, while the studio retains its theatrical distribution and television production operations across the two regions.\n\n\n\tJain has secured a multi-year licensing deal that grants him rights to use the Lionsgate Play branding and draw from the studio’s content catalog for the streaming service.\n\t\n\n\tLionsgate Play maintains active operations in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, and the Maldives. The service primarily utilizes a B2B2C distribution model through long-term partnerships with telecommunications providers. In India, the platform is integrated into various aggregators such as JioHotstar, Airtel Xstream, and Amazon Prime Video Channels. For 2026, the company is executing a content slate that includes 100 planned premieres for the year, with a specific focus on expanding its regional Indian library with 25 new titles across the Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada languages. \n\n\t“We thank Rohit for his outstanding leadership in building and scaling Lionsgate’s business in India over the past eight years,” said Lionsgate COO Brian Goldsmith. “Under his stewardship, the Lionsgate brand has gained greater resonance with audiences in South Asia and Southeast Asia, and Lionsgate Play has emerged as a distinctive premium streaming platform in one of the world’s fastest-growing digital entertainment markets. Rohit is an entrepreneur with a deep understanding of the Asia landscape, and he has the expertise and experience to lead Lionsgate Play into an exciting new phase of growth.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’m deeply grateful to Jon Feltheimer and Brian Goldsmith for the trust and freedom to build Lionsgate’s India business and transform Lionsgate Play into a premium streaming platform across Asia,” said Rohit Jain. “Lionsgate Play has established itself as a leading destination for Hollywood content in India and is now positioned to expand well beyond that – shaping a differentiated, future-ready streaming platform for the region.”\n\n\tFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“24” star Kiefer Sutherland was arrested early Monday after an alleged physical altercation with a Hollywood ride-share driver, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\n\tAuthorities said that around 12:15 a.m., the LAPD responded to a call about an assault involving a rideshare driver near Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. Officers concluded that the suspect, identified as Sutherland, entered a rideshare vehicle, allegedly assaulted the driver and made criminal threats toward them. The victim sustained no injuries that required immediate medical attention. Sutherland was arrested for making criminal threats toward the victim, in violation of California Penal Code section 422. Detectives from the Hollywood Division are currently investigating the incident.\n\t\n\n\tSutherland’s reps did not immediately respond to Variety’s request for comment.\n\n\n\tSutherland was bailed out on a $50,000 bond late Monday morning. His initial court date is set for Feb. 2.\n\n\tSutherland, son of Shirley Douglas and the late actor Donald Sutherland, broke into Hollywood starring in Rob Reiner’s 1986 coming-of-age drama “Stand By Me,” and Joel Schumacher’s 1987 subversive teen horror “The Lost Boys.” Some of his other early works include “Crazy Moon,” “Bright Lights, Big City,” “Flashback,” “The Flatliners,” “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me” and “A Few Good Men.”\n\n\tSutherland is probably best known for playing counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer across eight seasons of the Fox thriller series “24.” It won 20 Emmys during its run, including two acting prizes for Sutherland. In 2012, the show was rebooted into 12 episode mini series, “24: Live Another Day.”\n\t\n\n\tHis recent credits include films like “Tinsel Town,” “Stone Cold Fox,” “Juror #2” and “They Cloned Tyrone.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNBC has given a pilot order to “Protection,” a drama series written by Josh Safran. Jenna Bush Hager and Ben Spector executive produce the project along with Safran. Universal Television is the studio.\n\n\tThe official logline for “Protection” reads, “When a U.S. Marshal falls in the line of duty, a seemingly cut-and-dry case turns into a deadly conspiracy as a family of law enforcement agents become the target of a mysterious assassin. Bridging personal differences and crossing professional boundaries, the Thornhill family must use the expertise from a lifetime of protecting civilians and politicians to protect one another and bring the killer to justice … even if it means betraying their sworn code.”\n\t\n\n\tThis is the second drama pilot ordered by NBC this season, following a reboot of “The Rockford Files,” which ran for six seasons on the network from 1974 to 1980.\n\n\n\tSafran is best known for his work on “Gossip Girl”; he joined the famed CW teen drama as a writer and consulting producer in Season 1 and rose to become an executive producer by the time the show ended, then created and executive produced the HBO Max reboot that aired for two seasons from 2021 to 2023. He was also the creator and showrunner of “Quantico,” the conspiracy thriller that aired on ABC for three seasons from 2015 to 2018. Safran’s other credits as a writer include NBC’s “Smash,” Netflix’s “Soundtrack” and the 2014 film “Endless Love.”\n\n\tBush Hager, daughter of former president George W. Bush, is best known for her work with NBC News. Currently a co-host of “Today,” she first joined the network in 2009. She has also written multiple books and has an imprint at Penguin Random House called Thousand Voices Books. \n\t\n\n\tSpector previously served as president of TV and film at Eva Longoria’s production company before becoming Bush Hager’s producing partner when she entered a first-look deal at Universal Television in 2022.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix is readying a revised offer — in all cash — to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery‘s streaming and studios businesses, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\tUnder the terms of Netflix’s original agreement, each Warner Bros. Discovery shareholder would receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 worth of shares of Netflix common stock for each share of WBD common stock outstanding at the closing of the transaction. With those parameters, that deal has an enterprise value of $82.7 billion.\n\t\n\n\tNow, Netflix is prepared to switch to an all-cash offer, according to the Journal, which cited anonymous sources. Bloomberg News previously reported that Netflix was contemplating such a move.\n\n\n\tA Netflix rep declined to comment. A WBD spokesman referred inquiries to Netflix.\n\n\tNetflix’s reported change-up on the deal terms comes as David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance has continued to press its case to shareholders for why its $30/share all-cash hostile bid is superior to the Netflix pact. On Monday, Paramount filed a lawsuit seeking to compel WBD to disclose financial details of the Netflix deal including how WBD is valuing the proposed Discovery Global cable TV networks spin-off. Paramount also officially declared that it would launch a proxy fight, with plans nominate its own WBD board candidates for election at Warner Bros. Discovery’s annual shareholder meeting who would back the Paramount bid.\n\n\tShares of Netflix have dropped more than 12% since the Warner Bros. deal was announced Dec. 5 — falling below the “collar” of $97.91/share in the WBD agreement that would reduce the total value of the acquisition. (In that case, under the terms of the original agreement, WBD shareholders will receive 0.0460 Netflix shares for each WBD share, instead of $4.50 worth of Netflix stock per WBD share.) Netflix’s stock closed at $90.32/share Tuesday, up 1% on the day.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to Paramount’s Jan. 8 analysis, the total value of the Netflix transaction to WBD shareholders is $27.42/share, given the decline in Netflix’s share price. Paramount Skydance alleges that shares of Discovery Global would be worthless, based on an analysis comparing it with Comcast’s recent Versant spin-off.\n\n\tUnder Netflix’s deal with WBD, the streaming giant would acquire the Warner Bros. film and television studios, HBO and HBO Max, and its games division. Netflix’s original bid included $59 billion in debt financing from Wells Fargo, BNP and HSBC.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Paramount Skydance is offering to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety, with the backing of David Ellison’s father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, and other partners including RedBird Capital Partners and the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. \n",

But the ceremony also competed directly with NBC’s telecast of the NFL wild card game that saw the New England Patriots beat the Los Angeles Chargers to secure a playoff berth.\n\t\n\n\tNikki Glaser hosted the Globes for the second year in a row and was once again positively received. Variety critic Alison Herman wrote that “Glaser continued to confidently strut the thin and delicate line between landing punches while seeming infectiously excited to be in the Beverly Hilton ballroom,” and producers of the ceremony told Variety they “certainly hope” she’ll return as host again next year. \n\n\tGlaser’s opening monologue generated 14 million views across social media platforms after 36 hours. On the Golden Globes’ YouTube page as of Tuesday evening the 11-minute monologue was up to 3.7 million views. CBS said the ceremony delivered the most “social interactions” in Globes history with some 42 million interactions on Sunday night.\n\n\tGlenn Weiss and Ricky Kirshner of White Cherry Entertainment served as showrunners and executive producers of the Golden Globes. The ceremony was produced by Dick Clark Productions, which is owned by Variety parent company PMC in a joint venture with Eldridge.\n\t\n\n\tThe Globes also aired in 165 international territories.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the first three episodes of “Tell Me Lies” Season 3, now streaming on Hulu.\n\n\tJust when you thought “Tell Me Lies” couldn’t get any more toxic, Hulu dropped the first three episodes of Season 3. As the group returns to Baird College after Christmas break, the dynamics are messy, almost immediately. Pippa (Sonia Mena) and Wrigley (Spencer House) are back together, but she’s also now sleeping with Diana (Alicia Crowder). Wrigley, who watched his brother die last season, seems to be the only one with his head on straight. One thing helping that is a new friendship with Bree (Catherine Missal); the pair bond while on MDMA and have an unexpected sleepover at a bus stop. They are also taking photography classes together to keep him busy and he looks to actually be enjoying himself.\n\t\n\n\t“There are always those people in friend groups who spend a lot of time in the same space, but never alone. You’ll be in a friend group, and you’ll realize I’ve never actually had a private conversation with this person. So they know of each other, but they don’t know each other on a personal level,” says showrunner Meaghan Oppenheimer. “They are, by Season 3, in a lot of ways, the people who have dealt with the most serious trauma in their lives. I always like stories where people who are at rock bottom connect and find healing within each other and find a surprising safe space with another person. So it felt just very organic to me.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBree, however, is not doing great on her post-Oliver (Tom Ellis) spiral. Plus, Evan (Branden Cook) has now realized that Oliver was the older man she was sleeping with. At the end of Season 2, Oppenheimer told Variety that she wasn’t planning to bring Ellis back for Season 3… but once she began breaking the season, that changed.\n\t\n\n\t“There were so many questions that were still coming at me from people, and you don’t want to leave potential conflict that you don’t use,” she explains. “And, we never had him and Evan confront each other, and it just felt like wasted potential. So it just made sense to bring him back, but not in such a front-and-center way. It just felt unrealistic that he wouldn’t have some kind of interaction just a few weeks after all of that happened. He and Branden are really good friends, so it was nice to give them a little something to do together!”\n\n\tOn the Lucy (Grace Van Patten) and Stephen (Jackson White) front, they give it a go again for about five minutes — he waits for her to come clean about Evan, but when she doesn’t, he breaks up with her. Soon, he starts threatening to tell Bree, then decides to blackmail her after forcing her to record a video of herself admitting that she lied about being sexually assaulted the previous semester. Lucy is so overwhelmed that she has a panic attack.\n\n\t“She starts to disassociate this season. She’s someone who’s always had struggles with her mental health since her father died. We talked about, maybe she’s depressed in Season 1, and she feels numb. And I think that she is,” says Oppenheimer. “That is the truth of what she was experiencing Season 1, and I think that made her the perfect target for this unhealthy relationship. You’re watching someone who doesn’t have the tools to deal with it and doesn’t have the support of adults.”\n\n\tThe executive producer notes that due to what Lucy has been through recently, this “felt like an honest outcome — for her to finally have this break where the inside of her cannot handle what is happening in her outside world, and so that fracture starts to happen where she’s literally disassociating.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTo distract herself, Lucy hooks up with Alex (Costa D’Angelo), the kind-hearted campus drug dealer, who happens to have grown up in foster care with Bree.\n\n\t“The idea of bringing in someone from her foster family was always something that was in the back of my mind. I wasn’t sure how it was going to manifest, and then having it someone that was also tied to Lucy just was an organic thing that happened,” says Oppeneheim. Alex’s backstory will be revealed further as the season goes on, but at the end of the third episode, Lucy and Alex have very intense sex as she asks him to call her pathetic.\n\t\n\n\t“On paper, the character’s a lot harder, and Costa came in with so much vulnerability and such a brokenness that he just blew off the screen for me,” says Oppenheimer. And while the series has featured explicit love scenes over the past two seasons, even Oppenheimer was shocked when she saw the final cut of the Alex and Lucy scene at the end of Season 3. “I was like, we’re really doing it. We’ll see what people say. I thought they both did so well in that scene. I thought it was beautiful, and I haven’t seen anything like it before.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTony Dokoupil, newly installed anchor of “CBS Evening News,” landed an interview with President Donald Trump — and the news program aired Trump’s comments uninterrupted for almost half the broadcast.\n\n\tDokoupil interviewed Trump Tuesday on the floor of a Ford Motor Co. factory in Dearborn, Michigan, and the segment aired on the “CBS Evening News.” CBS News aired the interview with Trump for roughly the first 14 minutes of the evening newscast, without commercial breaks or apparent edits. \n\t\n\n\tTopics covered in Dokoupil’s interview with Trump spanned the U.S. economy; the killing of a Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent; Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell — who is the target of a Justice Department investigation into whether he lied to Congress over the scope of the Fed’s headquarters renovation; and the ongoing protests in Iran and the Iranian government’s killing of protestors.\n\n\n\tAbout the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minnesota by an ICE agent, Trump said that “her actions were pretty tough” and said, referring to videos of the incident, “when you look at that tape, it can be viewed two ways… There are a couple versions of that tape that are very, very bad.”\n\n\tTrump asserted that “We have the strongest economy maybe in the history of the country” and said his focus is on the U.S. economy. At the same time, Trump said, he is also working to address foreign threats. “We’ve had a big victory with Venezuela,” Trump said. \n\n\tIf Kamala Harris had won the 2024 presidential election, Trump told Dokoupil, “You probably wouldn’t have a job right now.” Dokoupil later in the interview, countered, “For the record, I do think I’d have this job even if the other guys won” to which Trump replied, “Yeah, but at a lesser salary.” Trump repeated his oft-made claim that “We now have the hottest country in the world” whereas a year and a half ago it was “dead.”\n\t\n\n\tAbout Powell, Trump said, “He’s been a lousy Fed chairman,” and reiterated his longstanding criticism that Powell has been “too high on interest rates.” Trump alleged the Federal Reserve HQ construction project has encountered billions of dollars in overruns and said about Powell, “He’s either corrupt or incompetent.”\n\n\tDokoupil cited Trump’s recent comment in a New York Times interview that only his “own morality” limited his power as commander in chief in international affairs, and he asked the president whether there’s anything that limits his power in the U.S. “I’m a moral person. I don’t like seeing death,” Trump said. “So yeah, it’s limited by my morality and I have a very high grade of morality, so therefore it’s limited.” Dokoupil responded, “Not the Constitution, not the courts? That’s what I thought you were going to say.” Trump said, “Well, the Constitution and courts, of course. That goes without saying.”\n\n\tOn Tuesday, Dokoupil anchored “CBS Evening News” live from Detroit at GM’s new global headquarters, as part of his multicity “Live From America” tour. The back half of the telecast featured an Dokoupil’s interview with GM CEO Mary Barra, who said Trump’s tariffs resulted in “a few billion” dollars in additional costs to the company in 2025.\n\n\tDokoupil, a veteran of CBS News’ morning show, was appointed anchor of “CBS Evening News” by Bari Weiss, the founder of The Free Press who is now overseeing the TV news division. Paramount Skydance chairman and CEO David Ellison bought her company in October, at which point he named Weiss editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n\n\tHe was supposed to start his “CBS Evening News” hosting duties Jan. 5 but took to the air two days sooner than planned: On Saturday, Jan. 3, he had an extended three-part interview with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth following the Trump administration’s invasion of Venezuela to apprehend former president Nicolás Maduro.\n\n\tFrom Jan. 5-9, overall viewership of “CBS Evening News” with Dokoupil was down 23% compared with same period for the newscast a year ago.\n\n\tAhead of his “CBS Evening News” debut, Dokoupil — parroting points that Weiss has made — said that “People do not trust us like they used to” and that mainstream news outlets have placed “too much weight in the analysis of academics, or elites, and not enough on you.” The show also outlined five principles ahead of his first broadcast, including: “We love America. And we make no apologies for saying so.”\n\t\n\n\tIn some of Dokoupil’s “CBS Evening News” segments, critics have perceived a less-antagonistic stance toward the Trump administration compared with other traditional news networks. On a broadcast last week, in a teary-eyed report from Miami, Dokoupil said about Trump’s secretary of state, “Marco Rubio, we salute you. You’re the ultimate Florida man,” adding: “Whatever you think of [Rubio’s] politics, you’ve got to admit, it’s an impressive résumé.” Reporting from Minneapolis after the killing of Good, Dokoupil said that both pro- and anti-ICE beliefs were “deeply American sentiments” while he appealed to viewers to “find a way to live with people who are genuinely different from us.”\n\n\tThe new CBS News regime was skewered by Golden Globes host Nikki Glaser on Sunday’s broadcast of the awards show — on CBS. Glaser quipped that “the award for most editing goes to CBS News,” adding: “CBS News: America’s newest place to see B.S. news.”\n",

Inside, there's a private movie theater, wine room, full spa, and not one but TWO full kitchens decked out.\n      \n    \n          Boat people, listen up ... the property comes with a 100 foot deep water dock capable of handling large yachts, making it a true waterfront flex.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Location wise, it's prime real estate ... just minutes from Palm Beach Island and Palm Beach International Airport, perfect for anyone bouncing between private jets and boats.\n      \n    \n          Bottom line here ...

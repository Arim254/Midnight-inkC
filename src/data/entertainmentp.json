    "body": "\n\tAfter a three-week wait, “South Park” is back with a new episode and a new season.\n\n\tIn an abrupt turn of events, the short-lived Season 27 has ended after just five episodes, instead of the previously determined 10, a spokesperson for Comedy Central confirmed. No details were provided as to why. Wednesday’s Season 28 premiere saw South Park Elementary enveloped in the “6-7” TikTok trend, and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel thinks the Antichrist is to blame.\n\t\n\n\tThe episode opens on a rally led by PC Principal, who is determined to get South Park Elementary back on track after catching wind of some “santaic numerology shit” going on.” To set things straight, he brings in a guest speaker to talk some sense into the student body: The “absolute expert on the end of days and the coming of the Antichrist,” Peter Thiel.\n\n\n\t“Hello, kids, I’m Peter Thiel, and I’m here to talk to you about the Antichrist,” he says. “Ok, so first, what is the Antichrist? The Antichrist is a newer, more human form of Satan that will soon walk the Earth. We don’t know how soon it will walk the Earth, but it could be within the next six to seven weeks.”\n\n\tThe South Park Elementary student body then explodes in unison, “6-7!”\n\n\tConfused, Thiel continues his impromptu TED Talk. He explains that Satan wasn’t able to have a child until Donald Trump came along, who has the perfect-sized manhood to fit inside Satan’s “pinhole” sized rectum. How big is Trump’s manhood? Thiel estimates it’s between “six and seven centimeters.”\n\n\tOnce again, his Gen Alpha audience shouts, “6-7!”\n\n\tNow frustrated, Thiel yells back at the kids, “The Antichrist is coming! The Bible refers to the eagle, which refers to America, the fourth seal broken, and hell coming to Earth. It’s right here in Revelations Six… Six-Seven.”\n\t\n\n\tDead set on putting an end to the seemingly demonic “6-7” craze, Thiel dives into the school data center with PC Principal and South Park Elementary’s counselor, Jesus Christ, to look for answers.\n\n\t“I’ve downloaded all the students’ information and loaded them into an AI face detection program so the school’s security cameras can watch their every move,” he says. “Now look. Two students passing each other in the hallway. They give each other the sign: six, seven. Exactly 67 seconds later, this odd parka-wearing child makes the same gesture. And then inside the girls’ bathroom, two girls doing the same thing!”\n\n\tA concerned Jesus stops him, “Wait, why is there a camera inside the girls’ bathroom?”\n\n\tThiel returns, “To stop the Antichrist!”\n\n\tAll the while, Thiel has been secretly working for JD Vance, who is determined to stop the Antichrist from being born so that he can take Trump’s place instead of the devil child. He tells Vance, while en route to a child he suspects is connected to the demon spawn, “I’m very close to finding the secret of the numbers. I’ve narrowed it down to one little boy who seems more possessed than the others.”\n\n\tThe child in question: Eric Cartman.\n\n\tAla “The Exorcist,” Thiel walks up to Cartman’s room to free him from the possession.\n\n\tThiel tells a giggling Cartman, “I came to see you in an Uber. You know how long it took me to get here? Around six or seven minutes.” Cartman starts laughing so hard that he projectile vomits all over Thiel. \n\n\tUnable to complete the exorcism, he tells Ms.Cartman that he must take her child to D.C., and that “everything we hold dear could end” if he doesn’t “unlock the secrets he holds.”\n\n\t“6-7” (pronounced “six seven”) is a viral lyric from the rap single “Doot Doot (6 7)” from American artist Skrilla. The phrase skyrocketed into the cultural zeitgeist through TikTok, proving especially popular with younger users. As demonstrated by “South Park,” “6-7” is often recited in tadum with a hand gesture popularized by a TikTok user named Maverick Trevillain, fittingly known as “The 67 Kid.” The phrase doesn’t appear to have any real meaning and functions more as an internet inside joke.\n\n\tThiel recently made headlines after the Washington Post published the contents of his invite-only, off-record lectures on religion and the tech industry. Across the four, roughly two-hour-long talks, the venture capitalist accused Greta Thunberg as well as all those who are critical of the rapid development of artificial intelligence of being “legionnaires of the Antichrist.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWith his debut memoir “You Thought You Knew,” Kevin Federline is telling his side of the story. The 47-year-old first came to public prominence as Britney Spears‘ second husband after they married in 2004, plucked from his rising career as a dancer and thrust into a chaotic world of paparazzi and superstardom. But things soon turned acrimonious following the birth of their two sons, Preston and Jayden, leading to years of infighting over custody out of concern for Spears’ mental health and his ridicule as a public figure.\n\t\n\n\tFederline outlines much of his experiences with Spears in “You Thought You Knew,” out Oct. 21, while shedding light on his personal trajectory. From the start, the Fresno native reflects on his burgeoning dance career on tour with LFO and Pink amid his relationship with Shar Jackson, with whom he has two children. But much of his story focuses on Spears and their tumultuous romance, from the whirlwind of attention to their inevitably contentious dynamic. Through it all, he reiterates his devotion to being a father to his six children, stating that he only cares to protect them from the ills of the world.\n\n\n\tIn a statement to Variety, a rep for Spears says, “With news from Kevin’s book breaking, once again he and others are profiting off her and sadly it comes after child support has ended with Kevin. All she cares about are her kids, Sean Preston and Jayden James and their well-being during this sensationalism. She detailed her journey in her memoir.”\n\n\tNow living in Hawaii with his wife Victoria Prince, Federline traces the shocking moments from his life in “You Thought You Knew,” divulging how it all unfolded.\n\t\n\n\tFederline Was Thrown Into the Deep End\n\n\tAfter meeting Spears at Hollywood club Joseph’s and sparking their romance, Federline was brought into her circle, as she demanded that her team include him on her European tour. Her security warned him to “be careful” and that he was “on a sinking ship,” which he said was “the first real warning,” but it was a night in Amsterdam that ultimately changed his perspective. They returned to their hotel room after a night of partying when Spears said she’d be right back. Federline later found her making out with a dancer named Theresa and swiftly packed to leave the tour, only to change his mind after she apologized. Still, he recalled, “that moment was a turning point for both of us,” one where she realized that he wasn’t there for the “fame or perks.”\n\n\tSpears Had ‘Unfinished Business’ With Justin Timberlake\n\n\tThe night before Federline married Spears in 2004, he recalls that she had a phone call with her ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake outside of where they were staying in Santa Monica. He said he could “tell Britney still had some unfinished business” with Timberlake, and that she had been crying. She explained that she needed to call Timberlake “to end one chapter of her life before starting a new one” and wanted closure. But “even after the wedding, I could tell she hadn’t fully moved on,” he writes. “Looking back, especially after hearing what she said in her book, I realize it was deeper than that. She never really got over him. She might’ve loved me, but there was always something there with Justin that she couldn’t let go of.”\n\n\tHe Learned of Their Divorce Through an Interview\n\n\tFederline claims throughout his memoir that he had several breaking points during his relationship with Spears, but points specifically to one evening where he knew “this was the beginning of the end” for their marriage. In 2006, Federline was celebrating the release of his debut album with a party at Los Angeles’ Paramount Studios on Halloween. Spears initially said that she would not be attending, but inevitably did show up along with her brother Brian, father Jamie, agent Jason Trawick and an unnamed actress. Federline walked in on her in his dressing room doing cocaine with the actress, something that he’d seen her do before, but was shocked to witness as she was breastfeeding at the time.\n\t\n\n\tFederline confronted her about using cocaine, telling her, “Please don’t go home and breastfeed the kids like this. Call your mom or someone. We need to get formula. You can’t do this.” Spears then threw a drink in his face and stormed off, while Federline called her mother and insisted that she not let Spears breastfeed at her home. The next morning, Federline called his lawyer Mark Kaplan to draft a legal letter demanding that Spears stop breastfeeding their children, and Federline left town to promote his record, ignoring her calls and messages. While he was in Toronto for an interview at MuchMusic, a producer asked him just before he went on air, “How do you feel about Britney filing for divorce?” — the first he’d heard of their split.\n\n\tHe Details Spears’ Erratic Behavior Towards Their Children\n\n\tFederline spends much of “You Thought You Knew” insisting that his main priority has always been protecting his children and providing them with a safe life. But he writes of several instances where he claims Spears acted abusively and erratically around their two children. In perhaps the most shocking moment in the book, he describes how their sons Preston and Jayden awoke several nights to Spears standing in the doorway watching them sleep with a knife in her hand. “Oh, you’re awake?” she said, only to “turn around and pad off without explanation.”\n\n\tThe book also details several other incidents that his children relayed to him, including one where Preston claimed that Spears punched him in the face. Federline states that Spears bleached their hair down to the scalp, leaving them with burns, and that Preston once asked him when he was 10 or 11 why Spears kept forcing him to bathe with her. The boys recorded some incidents with Spears on their phones, including times that she verbally berated them and once woke up Jayden at midnight to put lotion on his face on a school night. He says that Spears also gave Jayden shellfish, knowing that he was allergic to it. In what Federline describes as another breaking point, Preston went to Europe with his girlfriend’s family on vacation where he received a call from Spears, blaming Federline for everything. After Preston confronted her and called her out, Federline recalls, “Her response was chilling: she told him she wished he, his brother, and me were all dead.”\n\t\n\n\tHe Reflects on Spears’ Infamous Paparazzi Moments\n\n\tIn her memoir “The Woman in Me,” Spears explains that her split from Federline and severe postpartum depression led to her infamous episode where she shaved her head and attacked a paparazzo’s car. Federline reflects on that period in “You Thought You Knew,” describing the time that Spears locked herself in a bathroom with Jayden and claimed that Jayden was being abused at Federline’s house. After a standoff that lasted for hours, Spears was removed in a straitjacket and placed in a 5150 hold as their children were inspected by doctors due to her “outlandish claims.” “I felt sick over what she was going through,” he states. “This was someone I had loved.”\n\n\tFederline Couldn’t Get Behind the Free Britney Movement\n\n\tAfter Spears was put in a conservatorship, Federline says that he “supported the decision because I believed it was the only way to stabilize her situation, and more importantly, provide a safer environment for our kids.” He turns his attention to the Free Britney movement, which rallied for her freedom from the conservatorship. “I tried to understand where they were coming from, but I could never fully get behind it,” he writes. “At times, it felt more like a fandom’s mob mentality than genuine concern for Britney’s well-being.” He theorizes that the judge who terminated the conservatorship in 2021 felt “pressure” from the Free Britney movement, which “led the judge to ignore professional reports and cave to public opinion, especially with her own election on the line.”\n\n\tWhen the conservatorship ended, he “braced for the worst.” “The Free Britney movement got it wrong,” he says. “All of those people who put so much effort into that should now put the same energy into the Save Britney movement. Because this is no longer about freedom. It’s about survival.”\n\n\tHe’s Concerned for Spears’ Well-Being\n\n\tThough Federline has not spoken with Spears in years, he says that he feels “an increasing urgency that I can’t ignore” and that her situation is “racing toward something irreversible.” “The signs are all there: the erratic behavior, the isolation, the cycling of people around her, the refusal to accept help. It’s become impossible to pretend everything’s okay,” he writes. “From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we’re getting close to the eleventh hour. Something bad is going to happen if things don’t change, and my biggest fear is that our sons will be left holding pieces. They love their mom. They’ve seen the red flags. But they don’t know how to help without being attacked, misunderstood, or blamed.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDiane Keaton‘s family have made a statement revealing her cause of death. Her family thanked fans for their messages of support and told People magazine that the actress died of pneumonia on Saturday.\n\n\t“The Keaton family are very grateful for the extraordinary messages of love and support they have received these past few days on behalf of their beloved Diane, who passed away from pneumonia on October 11,” the statement said.\n\n\n\tThe family suggested that her fans could make donations in her memory to a local food bank or an animal shelter. “She loved her animals and she was steadfast in her support of the unhoused community, so any donations in her memory to a local food bank or an animal shelter would be a wonderful and much appreciated tribute to her,” the family told People.\n\t\n\n\tKeaton died in Los Angeles on Saturday. Paramedics had responded to her home and transported her to a nearby hospital.\n\n\tA friend said her health had “declined very suddenly” in the past few months, according to People, and that only her close family was aware, and chose “to keep things very private.” \n\n\tSince Saturday, tributes have poured in from her co-stars and friends for the Oscar-winning actress, who in addition to starring in dozens of notable films was known as a passionate architectural preservationist and animal lover. Starting on Friday, AMC Theatres will be rereleasing “Annie Hall” and “Something’s Gotta Give” for one week runs to commemorate her memory. Keaton won the best actress Oscar for Woody Allen’s “Annie Hall” and was nominated for best actress for “Reds,” “Something’s Gotta Give” and “Marvin’s Room.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA woman died in an “apparent suicide” on Tuesday outside Disney World‘s Contemporary Resort in Florida, according to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office.\n\n\t“We can confirm this was an apparent suicide,” a spokesperson for the Orange County Sheriff’s Office told Variety in an email.\n\n\tThe suicide’s proximity to the famous Disney World monorail sparked unconfirmed reports online about the cause of death. However, a spokesperson from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office told People that the victim was “NOT struck by the monorail,” and deemed any reports suggesting she was “erroneous information.”\n\t\n\n\tLocal outlet WKMG reported that local authorities received word around 6:40 p.m. local time about a body on North World Dive, which runs through Disney’s Contemporary Resort.\n\n\n\tA video by an onlooker posted online showed employees erecting a white pop-up tent on the terrace of the Contemporary Resort in the wake of the incident. Police cars can be seen congregating in the parking lot below.\n\n\tOriginally opened in October 1971 as the Tempo Bay Hotel, the Contemporary Resort is one of the two original residences built at the Disney World Complex. On the Disney World website, the hotel is described as an “ultra-modern” lodging featuring the “iconic A-frame Contemporary tower” and a “90-foot-tall mural by Disney Legend Mary Blair — responsible for the distinct look and feel of the ‘it’s a small world’ attraction.”\n\n\tThe suicide comes a week after a woman in her 60s experienced a health issue and died after riding Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion attraction in California. Anaheim Police confirmed that the woman was unresponsive after exiting the ride, and that Disneyland security administered CPR until first responders rushed her to the hospital. She was later pronounced dead.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe tribe has spoken… and they’re voting Andrew Cuomo off the island.\n\n\tSeveral recent “Survivor” contestants — including Teeny Chirichillo (Season 47), Yam Yam Arocho (Season 44) and Katurah Topps (Season 45) — have returned to tribal council to advocate for Zohran Mamdani in a new campaign advertisement paid for by the New York City mayoral candidate.\n\n\tThe spot, which aired locally on WCBS-TV in New York during Wednesday night’s episode of “Survivor,” is one of several in a seven-figure ad buy to reach different demographics of the voting public. Mamdani’s campaign ran a “Bachelor”-inspired ad during a recent episode of “The Golden Bachelor.”\n\t\n\n\t“Andrew, New Yorkers want a mayor who will make groceries and childcare affordable, not sell us out to their billionaire donors,” Chirichillo says in the ad while holding up a piece of the show’s signature voting parchment with Cuomo’s name on it, as if voting him out of the race.\n\n\n\n\tIn a spin on the confessionals shown during “Survivor” elimination ceremonies, Brandon Donlon (Season 45) pushes for “a mayor who will make buses fast and free,” while Arocho hopes to elect someone who will “not defund the MTA.”\n\n\tBefore Cuomo’s fictional torch is snuffed out, Natalie Anderson (Season 29) makes a final plea: “We’re with assemblyman Zohran Mamdani. He’ll stand up to Trump, freeze the rent and deliver universal childcare.”\n\n\tMamdani appears at the end of the spot to conclude: “We’re going to build a city where no one has to struggle to survive.”\n\n\tWCBS ran a disclaimer before the ad to make sure this wasn’t seen as an endorsement by the brand: “The Following Message Is Not Associated with Either ‘Survivor’ or CBS.” It’s understood that CBS and the “Survivor” producers weren’t consulted about the use of the “Survivor” concept or appearance by previous contestants.\n\t\n\n\t“Federal law required our New York station WCBS-TV to run this candidate ad despite there not being any relationship to either ‘Survivor’ or WCBS-TV,” a CBS spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\tMamdani, a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist and state assemblyman whose progressive economic platform has galvanized younger voters, won the Democratic primary in a stunning upset. He and his rivals — former Gov. Cuomo, running as an independent, and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee — are expected to spend millions of advertising dollars ahead of the mayoral election on Nov. 4. \n",

In other words, he falsified reports for the family’s Gallatin, Mo., farm in order to receive subsidies and insurance payments they weren’t authorized to get. In a memo from Oct. 6, prosecutors asked U.S. District Court Judge Stephen R. Bough to sentence McBee to 41 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release and more than $4 million in restitution.\n\n\tOn the show, the economics of McBee Farming Operations are always presented as precarious. Because of these legal problems, McBee appeared only twice in the show’s second season, after taking center stage in Season 1.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAccording to ratings provided by Bravo, Season 2 of “The McBee Dynasty” — which ran from June 30-Sept. 1 — averaged 1.3 million weekly viewers across platforms. Compared with Season 1, its ratings were up 82% on Peacock and 213% on DVR. The second half of the 10-episode season showed gains of +16% on Peacock and +8% on Bravo through seven-day viewership. In an interesting statistic, about one-third of the second season’s “McBee” audience, Bravo says, “co-viewed with someone else on both Bravo and Peacock, making it a Top 4 Original Series of 2025 on both platforms – fueled by female viewers watching with male viewers.”\n\n\n\tIn Steve McBee Sr.’s absence, the second season focused on Steven Jr. and his brothers Jesse McBee and Cole, as they tried to save the farm and engaged in their messy personal lives. The show’s official logline reads, “On the heels of a wedding and the arrival of two new babies, the McBee clan is growing — and so are the challenges of balancing love, legacy, and life on the ranch.”\n\n\t“The McBee Dynasty” is produced by Jeff Jenkins Productions, in association with 3BMG. Jenkins, Russell Jay-Staglik, Luke Neslage, Brandon Beck, Ross Weintraub and Reinout Oerlemans executive produce.   \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 7 of “Gen V,” now streaming on Amazon’s Prime Video.\n\n\tIt turns out Marie (Jaz Sinclair) had a very good reason for originally thinking Dean Cipher (Hamish Linklater) had no powers: He doesn’t.\n\n\tToward the end of this week’s episode of “Gen V,” Marie, her sister Annabeth (Keeya King), Cate (Maddie Phillips) and Emma (Lizze Broadway) look on in horror as they discover the elderly burn victim man they correctly assumed was Thomas Godolkin (Ethan Slater) has been controlling Cipher this whole time. It wasn’t Cipher who had the power to control others, it was Thomas Godolkin. And from his hyperbaric chamber, Godolkin was controlling the man known as Cipher (who has no powers at all), and jumping in and out of others’ bodies as well, while he remained on life support. \n\t\n\n\tUntil, that is, Marie brought the century-old supe back to fighting form on this week’s “Gen V,” in the hopes thatThomas Godolkin would help them stop Cipher. But too bad, he is Cipher! Now, Marie and Annabeth have Godolkin’s pending massacre plans to deal with, on top of trying to mend their fragile sibling relationship: Annabeth confesses she knew Marie was going to kill their parents by accident before it happened, and it’s haunted her ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJaz Sinclair as Marie Moreau and Keeya King as Annabeth Moreau in “Gen V” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJasper Savage/Prime\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“She’s been completely removed from the supes, living with her Aunt Pam, and she thinks that supes are monsters. She doesn’t fully grasp her powers, nor does she really understand them,” King told Variety abiut playing Marie’s precog sister.\n\t\n\n\tAnd in her confusion over what happened to them and their parents, Annabeth’s pain and shame after their deaths turned into resentment toward Marie — she chose to blame her sister for something Annabeth knew was not Marie’s fault.\n\n\tThe twist in the sisters’ story raises the stakes for not only Marie and Annabeth, but also for Cate, Emma, Jordan (Derek Luh/London Thor), Sam (Asa Germann) and Polarity (Sean Patrick Thomas) going into the “Gen V” Season 2 finale next week. It shifts the perspective from what the audience saw in the opening scene of Season 1 — the deaths of Marie and Annabeth’s parents — and revealed that Marie is not solely responsible for her parents’ deaths. Annabeth could have said something and stopped it.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHamish Linklater as Dean Cipher in “Gen V” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJasper Savage/Prime\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I’ve watched the show, and I’m like, ‘OK, Annabeth thinks that Marie killed her parents,'” King said. “And then when I sat down with our showrunner, Michelle, she actually explained to me the path that the writers had for Annabeth, which is that she actually had these visions and she’s been holding onto them for a very long time. \n\n\t“As an actor, it’s sort of weaving in little moments of pain and regret of not acting on those visions, and then also sort of blaming my sister as well,” she continued. “Because when you’re upset with yourself, sometimes it’s like, ‘Where do I place that hurt?’ So sometimes she does place it on Marie, her sister.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMark Ruffalo revealed on the “Where Everybody Knows Your Name” podcast that he saved Woody Harrelson from an epic bar fight when the two were in New Orleans filming 2013’s “Now You See Me,” Louis Leterrier’s heist thriller about a group of illusionists who carry out robberies. Ruffalo played an FBI agent trying to capture the group.\n\n\t“We were shooting ‘Now You See Me’ in New Orleans, completely on the streets. Totally wild,” Ruffalo said (via Entertainment Weekly). “Capturing stuff on a long lens, getting dragged into bars during the middle of a scene, like in the middle of Mardi Gras.”\n\t\n\n\tRuffalo and Danson stayed out after filming wrapped for the day and went to “a packed place” to grab a drink when things escalated.\n\n\n\t“A woman came up to [Woody] and she said, ‘Oh my God, I love you so much,'” Ruffalo said. “Woody put his hand on her arm and he said, ‘Oh, thank you. Thank you, darling.’ And this guy comes over and he pushes her outta the way, and he shoves Woody. Bad. Because Woody’s first response is not ‘shove someone back,’ but ‘immediately punch them in the face.’ Which is the right thing to do, by the way. It’s the absolute right thing to do. But then a whole melee broke out in this bar. I was in the middle of it and it was turning into a— it was getting to become a whole thing… And I grabbed [Woody].”\n\n\t“I grabbed [Woody] and I pulled him out,” Ruffalo continued. “Because I was like, ‘This could be fun, but it also just could go so disastrously wrong because you and I might be able to handle ourselves but the rest of the folks we were with… I don’t think so.”\n\t\n\n\tRuffalo and Harrelson starred in “Now You See Me” alongside Jesse Eisenberg, Mélanie Laurent, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco and Morgan Freeman. The movie was a box office hit with $351 million worldwide and spawned a franchise that led to 2016’s “Now You See Me 2” and the upcoming “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” in theaters Nov. 14.\n\n\tWatch Ruffalo’s interview on the “Where Everybody Knows Your Name” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

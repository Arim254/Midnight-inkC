    "body": "\n\tRight from its title, Oscar Hudson’s droll debut “Straight Circle” evokes paradoxical oddities, which the writer-director layers atop his deadpan satire on nationalism and geographical boundaries. A tale of two enemy soldiers patrolling a militarized border from inside a common outpost, the movie’s fictitious premise gradually transforms, and eventually transcends the shortcomings of its broad political scope the more it leans into abstraction.\n\t\n\n\tThe film arrives with a bang, introducing the fragile ceasefire between its warring (though unnamed) desert nations via a smart split-screen prologue during its first five minutes. Amid pomp and circumstance, leaders on either side of a rickety fence stand on ceremony, inadvertently interrupting one another through microphone feedback, as the dueling images — each with their own jittery, handheld camera movements and unique color timing, one warm and one cool — swap places and subjects. This tongue-in-cheek flourish aestheticizes the point Hudson hammers home ad nauseam across 109 minutes, to vary degrees of success: these nations, despite their differing military garbs and traditions, may as well be one and the same.\n\n\n\tAlthough consistently amusing, “Straight Circle” is at its strongest when literalizing the blurred line between borders through this two-pronged visual approach, though it only takes this form for a few more minutes near the end. However, in the meantime, Hudson still plays alluring tricks, beginning with his casting. The story’s focus is, for the most part, a pair of soldiers with opposing allegiances, viewpoints, and ideologies. One of them, a bald, bespectacled man filled with jingoistic fervor, dons a large black beret and a white uniform, and enacts a showy, gestural salute that earns his countrymen the epithet of “slap heads.” The other, a raggedy, bearded civilian from his country’s military reserve, is less enthused, and often strips off his service greens and his Ottoman-style fez to smoke cigarettes and lounge in the sun. However, what viewers may not realize at first is that these characters are played by real-life twin brothers Elliott and Luke Tittensor (of “House of the Dragon” fame) respectively, imbuing the film’s sardonic goings on with an uncanny quality.\n\t\n\n\tThe made-up countries in question don’t seem to matter, which makes for a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows the film’s distinctly English characters to immediately make clear Hudson’s all-encompassing point about how, beyond our most outward and boisterous details, people are all the same, and we should just get along. Politically, “Straight Circle” has a tendency to play like a “Coexist” bumper sticker with all specificities stripped away, until real-world comparisons begin to hurt it. A tale such as this is bound to bring to mind existing equivalents,whether India and Pakistan’s ceremonial Wagah border, or the DMZ between North and South Korea, or numerous ongoing border disputes across the world, which stem from not only social and geopolitical specifics, but a history of western imperialism — and, in some cases, specifically British imperialism. The film’s British production, and its British filmmaker, can’t help but occupy a large section of the movie’s negative space, inviting questions about who and what exactly is being satirized (or perhaps patronized) in this tale of warring desert nations.\n\n\tHowever, despite the movie’s gaze verging on orientalist, “Straight Circle” slowly but surely disengages from all forms of reality, and becomes a far more absurd and anthropological study when an incoming dust storm disorients the characters and viewers alike. Beyond a point, both sides of the border become identical, just as the physical and psychological lines between both patrolmen begin to blur, resulting in surprisingly touching drama through personal anecdotes, sprinkled with surrealism, and performed with emotional gusto by its sibling leads, as they dig into what haunts and drives each character. The film is made even more inviting by composer Maxwell Sterling’s rapturous horns, and cinematographer Christopher Ripley’s vivid textures of the parched environment, rooting even the movie’s zaniest happenings in a visceral reality.\n\n\tThe less realistic the movie feels — in a geopolitical sense — the more human it becomes. This is perhaps Hudson’s greatest sleight of hand, and it transforms the initial weaknesses of “Straight Circle” into its most entertaining strengths. No one watching the film is likely to come away with a deeper understanding of military conflict, but there is, eventually, a wonderful psychology to the story, expressed through fleeting flourishes that are sorely missed once they’re cast aside. Perhaps it should’ve been stranger than it already is, but it’s a bold swing to begin with, and marks a fitting first chapter for Hudson, in what is sure to be an interesting career.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe “Stranger Things” series finale is shaping up to be a major theatrical event.\n\n\t1.1 million people have RSVP’d to watch the final episode of the Netflix sci-fi series in theaters on New Year’s Eve, according to an Instagram post from co-creator Ross Duffer, who also said that 3,500 showtimes across more than 620 theaters are completely sold out.\n\n\tDuffer teased that he and his brother Matt Duffer, his co-creator, would be attending a screening or two. “What a way to close out a ten-year journey—together,” Duffer wrote. “Maybe we’ll see some of you in LA.”\n\t\n\n\tVolume 1 of Season 5 premiered with four episodes on Thanksgiving Day, and Volume 2 followed with three more episodes on Christmas Day. Along with the theatrical release, the series finale will be concurrently released on Netflix on Dec. 31.\n\n\tThe finale will bring to a close what has been one of Netflix’s most important ventures ever. As exclusively reported by Variety, “Stranger Things” recently crossed 1.2 billion views, and has contributed more than $1.4 billion to the U.S. GDP. Season 4, which was released in 2023, still stands as Netflix’s No. 2 most popular English-language TV title of all time. Given that Season 5 achieved Netflix’s biggest opening week ever for an English-language TV series after Volume 1 debuted, it’s expected that the season will enter the most popular list soon after its eligibility window opens in January.\n\n\t“Stranger Things” is executive produced by the Duffers via their Upside Down Pictures banner alongside Shawn Levy of 21 Laps Entertainment and Dan Cohen.\n",

    "body": "\n\tArise Sir Stringer Bell!\n\n\tIdris Elba is set to receive a knighthood in the U.K. after the star led the list of names in the 2026 new year honors. \n\n\tDespite coming after another busy year for the actor, in which he — ironically — played both the U.S. president and British prime minister  in “House of Dynamite” and “Heads of State,” respectively, Elba is being recognized for his charity work, notably an anti-knife crime campaign and the Elba Hope Foundation he set up alongside his wife. \n\t\n\n\tAnother top honor went to comedian, writer and actor Meera Syal, best known for groundbreaking TV show “The Kumars at No 42,” who becomes a dame for services to literature, drama and charity. \n\n\n\tMeanwhile on screen, Cynthia Erivo is appointed an MBE (Member of the British Empire), with the “Wicked: For Good” star saying it was “an honor I could never have thought would happen.”\n\n\tMBEs also went to Tina McFarling, the British Film Institute’s much-loved former head of strategic communications (and founding member of the UK Film Council), and it’s former film laboratory lead at the BFI National Archive, David Gurney. Both stepped down from their positions in the summer of 2025. \n\n\tOBE (Order of the British Empire) honors went to “Thursday Murder Club” author and TV host Richard Osman, “Little Britain” comedian Matt Lucas, “Last of the Summer Wine” writer Roy Clarke, actor Sally Lindsay, comedian Bill Bailey, children’s TV star Paul Chuckle and Warwick Davis. \n\n\t“This is the best thing that’s ever happened to me — and I’ve been in Star Wars,” said Davis.\n\t\n\n\tAlongside the usual array of politicians, campaigners and athletes, other honorees in the annual new year list included singers Ellie Goulding and Eve Graham, TV chef Marcus Wareing, reality TV presenter Phil Spencer, sports presenter Gabby Logan and soccer commentator Clive Tyldesley. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTwo more acts have canceled their upcoming performances at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in the wake of Donald Trump adding his name to the historic forum, according to the New York Times.\n\n\tA veteran jazz septet known as the Cookers canceled two New Year’s Eve performances. They announced the move in a statement on Monday, writing, “Jazz was born from struggle and from a relentless insistence on freedom: freedom of thought, of expression, and of the full human voice.”\n\t\n\n\tThe group’s drummer, Billy Hart, told the Times that Trump’s name change “evidently” influenced the Cookers’ decision to bow out.\n\n\n\tNew York dance troupe Doug Varone and Dancers also canceled two of its performances slated for April. The shows were to coincide with the company’s 40th anniversary. Varone told the Times that they were losing $40,000 by dropping out. He wrote of the decision in an email, “It is financially devastating but morally exhilarating.”\n\n\t“The artists who are now canceling shows were booked by the previous far left leadership,” said the center’s president ambassador, Richard Grenell, in response to the recent cancellations. “Their actions prove that the previous team was more concerned about booking far left political activists rather than artists willing to perform for everyone regardless of their political beliefs. Boycotting the Arts to show you support the Arts is a form of derangement syndrome.”\n\n\tA rep for the Kennedy Center said the organization will not tolerate discrimination and book talent that appeals to all backgrounds and beliefs. \n\t\n\n\tThe Cookers and Doug Varone and Dancers are only the latest acts to pull their performances from the Kennedy Center calendar. Jazz musician Chuck Redd abruptly canceled his Christmas Eve concert in protest of Trump’s name change. Grenell said the organization would seek $1 million in damages.\n\n\tIn a Dec. 26 letter to Redd, Grenell wrote, “Your decision to withdraw at the last moment — explicitly in response to the Center’s recent renaming, which honors President Trump’s extraordinary efforts to save this national treasure — is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution.”\n\n\tTrump’s name was added to the center on Dec. 19 after the White House announced that the Kennedy Center board of trustees unanimously decided to rename the venue “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJoe Rogan is the latest industry heavyweight speaking out against Donald Trump‘s repeated attacks against Rob Reiner after the director’s tragic death. Trump alleged that Reiner’s death was “due to the anger he caused others” from being outspokenly anti-Trump. Reiner’s son, Nick, has been arrested in connection to his parents’ deaths.\n\n\t“The Rob Reiner thing is not funny,” Rogan said on a recent podcast featuring comedian Shane Gillis (via Entertainment Weekly). “When you see it with no empathy, that’s when it’s hard to like. Listen, there’s no justification for what he did that makes any sense in a compassionate society. It’s no different than people that were celebrating when Charlie Kirk got shot. It’s the same kind of thing.”\n\t\n\n\t “Imagine if Obama tweeted something about someone after they died in this way. That this person was a deranged person that hated Obama.” Rogan continued. “It just shows you how crazy it is, the way Trump thinks and talks. It’s just like, the guy got sliced up by his kid, you know? Anybody that doesn’t see that and go, ‘Fuck, man.’”\n\n\n\tRogan said someone should’ve taken Trump’s “fucking phone” away from when he decided to weigh in on Reiner’s death and added that he was  “so disappointed” by Trump’s comments: “It’s so disappointing. It’s like why… if you say that privately that’s one thing, which is also crazy, but it’s so disappointing.” \n\n\tTrump made his statement on Reiner in a Truth Social post that read: “A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood. Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS. He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before. May Rob and Michele rest in peace!”\n\t\n\n\tTrump doubled down on his criticism of Reiner hours later when asked during a press conference about Republicans condemning his original statement. He responded: “Well, I wasn’t a fan of his at all. He was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned… I thought he was very bad for our country.”\n\n\tThe U.S. president was widely condemned by Hollywood for his statements on Reiner. Josh Gad posted on Threads: “There is no low that is too low for this fucking psychopath. Rob Reiner was 1000 times the man you are and unlike you, he actually cared about the American people. Go paint your hand on your gold fucking toilet and destroy things like the White House. That’s what you do best.”\n\n\tJimmy Kimmel bashed Trump as “hateful and vile” for going after Reiner after such a tragic death. The late night host added: “What we need at a time like this, besides common sense when it comes to guns and mental health care, is compassion and leadership. We did not get that from our president, because he has none of it to give. Instead, we got a fool rambling about nonsense.”\n\n\tWhoopi Goldberg on “The View” condemned Trump and also every Republican staying silent on the matter by saying: “There’s no justification for him to have written what he wrote. There’s no way to justify it and all those Republicans who are quiet, damn you all. Damn you all.”\n\n\tListen to Rogan and Gillis’ full conversation on “”The Joe Rogan Experience” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBucking 2025 global cinema theater results that in many key markets that look set to at least edge up or come in flat when compared to 2024, total box office in Spain plunged 8% in 2025 to €453 million ($534.5 million), made off 65 million admissions, Comscore Movies Spain announced Tuesday. \n\n\tOverall Spanish box office returns for 2024 were already 22% below a pre-COVID 19 average over 2017-19, the weakest performance of Europe’s big five markets. \n\t\n\n\tOf 2025’s biggest hitters in Spain, Disney’s “Lilo & Stitch” topped its box office charts, grossing €24.7 million ($29.1 million), followed by “Jurassic World Rebirth” (€18.8 million: $22.2 million). \n\n\n\tSpain’s biggest – indeed only – blockbuster, was “Father There Is Only One 5,” the final installment of Santiago Segura’s family comedy saga, punching €13.4 million ($15.8 million). The franchise’s films have topped Spanish film charts in five of the last seven years. \n\n\t“It’s been a frustrating year. Looking at first half results, which were up 3% on 2024, everything pointed to 2025 either being up or at least flat on 2024. But October, down 28% when Spain saw Spring-like weather, and November, dropping 31%, put pay to that,” said David Rodríguez, Comscore Movies general manager for Spain and Portugal.\n\n\t“Beyond ‘Father There Is Only One 5,’ no other Spanish film really scored big box office,” he added. \n\n\tAction movies suitable for family consumption dominated Spanish box office in 2025, Rodríguez observed. They were accompanied by straight family fare, both film strains playing off virtual filmmaking: “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” “A Minecraft Movie,” “Zootopia 2,” “How to Train Your Dragon,” “Mufasa, The Lion King” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” all made Spain’s 2025 Top 10, according to Comscore Movies provisional estimates through Dec. 29.\n\t\n\n\tNo U.S. movie, however, made the spectacular €45.5 million ($47.3 million) gross for “Inside Out 2” in 2024 in Spain, the second best result for any movie in the country since “Spanish Affair” in 2014. \n\n\tOn the positive side for Spain, four upscale auteur titles made the national Top 10, led by Alejandro Amenábar’s “The Captive” (€5.3 million: $6.2 million). \n\n\tMost eye-catching, however, was the €3.9 million “($4.6 million) for Alauda Ruiz de Azúa’s San Sebastián top winner “Sundays” and €2.9 million ($3.4 million) box office for Cannes Jury Prize laureate “Sirāt,” now shortlisted for the International Feature Oscar, both showing how Movistar Plus+’s strategy of creating auteur event movies can pay dividends in theatrical results.   \n\n\tPacked with potential U.S. animation and live-action behemoths, as Gower Street Analytics has observed, 2026 should be the highest-grossing global year since 2019. “Should,” however, is sometimes a sad word when talking about box office, not only in Spain. \n\n\tSpain Top 10 Highest-Grossing Films, 2025\n\n\t1. “Lilo & Stitch,” Walt Disney, May 23, €24.70 million ($29.14 million) \n\n\t2. “Jurassic World Rebirth,” Universal, July 2, €18.80 million ($22.18 million)\n\n\t3. “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” Walt Disney, Dec. 19, €16.58 million ($19.56 million)\n\n\t4. “A Minecraft Movie,” Warner Bros, April 4, €16.03 million ($18.91 million)\n\n\t5. “Zootopia 2,” Walt Disney, Nov. 28, €13.75 million ($16.22 million)\n\n\t6. “How to Train Your Dragon,” Universal, June 12, €14.76 million ($17.41 million)\n\n\t7. “The Conjuring: Last Rites,” Walt Disney, Sep. 5, €13.63 million ($16.08 million)\n\n\t8. “Father There Is Only One 5,” Sony, June 26, €13.40 million ($15.81 million)\n\n\t9. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” Walt Disney, Dec. 20, 2024, €11.33 million ($13.36 million)\n\n\t10. “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” Walt Disney, July 24, €9.48 million ($ million) \n\n\tSpain’s Top 10 Spanish Highest-Grossing Films, 2025\n\n\t1. “Father There Is Only One 5,” Sony, June 26, €13.40 million ($15.81 million)\n\n\t2. “The Captive,” Walt Disney, Sep. 12, €5.28 million ($6.23 million)\n\t\n\n\t3. “Sundays,” Bteam Pictures, Oct. 24, €3.92 million ($4.62 million)\n\n\t4. “Wolfgang,” Universal, March 14, €3.97 million ($4.68 million)\n\n\t5. “La cena,” A Contracorriente, Oct. 17, €3.70 million ($4.36 million)\n\n\t6. “El casoplón,” Walt Disney, April 16, €3.31 million ($3.90 million)\n\n\t7. “Un funeral de locos,” Sony, April 11, €3.02 million ($3.56 million)\n\n\t8. “Sirāt,” Bteam Pictures, June 6, €2.89 million ($3.41 million)\n\n\t9. “Sin cobertura,” Sony, Aug. 22, €2.92 million ($3.44 million)\n\n\t10. “Romería,” Elastica, Sep. 5, €1.78 million ($2.10 million)\n\n\tLorena Jaramillo contributed to this article.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Community” director Jay Chandrasekhar is interviewed in the upcoming CNN documentary “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” and recalls that he “was there, directing, the night that Chevy Chase got fired” from the NBC sitcom (via People). Chandrasekhar, who is best known for his work with the Broken Lizard comedy group, said the actor had a “meltdown” on set after an incident in which he used the N-word on set leaked to the press.\n\n\tThe alleged incident occurred between Chase and co-star Yvette Nicole Brown, with Chandrasekhar explaining: “I know that there was a history between [Chevy and Yvette] around race, and she got up and stormed out of there. Chevy storms off, so the producer is like, ‘We need Yvette in the scene, right?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, she’s in the next scene.’ And he goes, ‘Well, she won’t come out unless Chevy apologizes to her.’”\n\t\n\n\tChandrasekhar said Chevy eventually returned to the set but claimed he “didn’t say anything” to upset Brown, adding: “[Chevy] goes, ‘You know, me and Richard Pryor, I used to call Richard Pryor the N-word, and he used to call me The Honky, and we loved each other.’ And I’m like, ‘I know, man, I love that bit.’ I said, ‘You know, can we just have a little apology?’ He goes, ‘For what?’” \n\n\tWhatever was said by Chase on the “Community” set happened during a “blackface” hand puppet bit written for the comedian’s character, Pierce Hawthorne, Chandrasekhar said. The incident was later reported on by The Hollywood Reporter, who claimed Chase was “frustrated” with his character arc and used the N-word “when questioning the dialogue.” The report stressed that Chase did not use the racial slur directly at his Black co-stars Brown and Donald Glover, although both actors were reportedly on set at the time.\n\t\n\n\tChandrasekhar said that when production resumed after the THR story broke, Chase arrived on set and had a “full meltdown” as he came “storming onto the set, and he goes, ‘Who fucked me over?’ … My career is ruined! I’m ruined!’ Like, it’s a full meltdown. ‘Fuck all of you!’ And I’m like, ‘Alright, let’s shoot the scene.’ He never ended up coming back after that.” \n\n\tVariety has reached out to Chase’s representative for further comment.\n\n\tGlover told The New Yorker in 2018 that Chase repeatedly made racist jokes on the “Community” set. According to the profile, Chase “often tried to disrupt” his scenes with Glover by making “racial cracks between takes,” one of which was the following: “People think you’re funnier because you’re Black.”\n\n\t“Chevy was the first to realize how immensely gifted Donald was, and the way he expressed his jealousy was to try to throw Donald off,” “Community” creator Dan Harmon said at the time. “I remember apologizing to Donald after a particularly rough night of Chevy’s non-P.C. verbiage, and Donald said, ‘I don’t even worry about it.’”\n\n\tGlover interpreted Chase’s racist cracks as the comedian “thrashing in the water,” adding, “I just saw Chevy as fighting time—a true artist has to be ok with his reign being over. I can’t help him if he’s thrashing in the water. But I know there’s a human in there somewhere—he’s almost too human.”Chase told CBS Sunday Morning in 2022 that he “doesn’t give a crap” about headlines and former co-stars painting him as problematic on set, adding at the time: “I don’t give a crap. I am who I am. And I like who I am. I don’t care. And it’s part of me that I don’t care. And I’ve thought about that a lot. And I don’t know what to tell you, man. I just don’t care.”\n\n\tChase exited “Community” after Season 4 following the N-word incident and a public spat with Harmon over creative differences. Chandrasekhar says in the CNN documentary that “it was out in the open that Chevy Chase was a little difficult on ‘Community,’ and I’m being nice. People were talking about it, enough that Dan did that thing at the wrap party,” referring to when Harmon got party guests to chant “Fuck you, Chevy!” \n\n\t“My dad was super excited to bring me and my mom to the wrap party,” Chevy’s daughter Caley says in the documentary. “We walk in, Dan, he had had some drinks. He had gotten the whole cast and crew to yell, ‘Fuck you, Chevy!’ ‘Fuck you, Chevy!’ I’m there, he’s showing his daughter, like, ‘This is the show I did,’ and we walk in to ‘Fuck you, Chevy!’ That’s rough and mean.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” director Marina Zenovich told Variety that she tried to get more of Chase’s “Community” cast members and crew members to participate in the documentary but “every single person said no” because “there are things people don’t want to talk about.”\n\n\t“I ran into Dan Harmon at a screening of ‘Deaf President Now!’ and I got his number,” she added. “I was so excited. I thought it was going to happen, but then he declined. I was so lucky to get Jay Chandrasekhar. He has such an amazing delivery and he was willing to go there. If Jay had said no, I would have been screwed.”\n\n\t“I’m Chevy Chase, and You’re Not” airs Jan. 1 on CNN.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThis year, there are two films vying for the best international feature film Oscar which are set in Iran, following a group of people, mostly strangers to each other, traveling in a van with a person that they may have to bury in the desert. \n\n\tOne is Jafar Panahi’s Palme d’Or-winning “It Was Just an Accident,” which the Iranian regime would never consider submitting for the Academy’s consideration. Panahi is legally embattled at home for his outspoken criticisms of the government. The thriller is instead representing France. The other title with that shared premise is “Cause of Death: Unknown,” Iran’s official entry, by writer-director Ali Zarnegar, a filmmaking debut from a seasoned screenwriter which could have garnered him deserved international attention under a different set of circumstances, but did not make the category’s shortlist. \n\t\n\n\tThough inevitably overshadowed, “Cause of Death: Unknown” is by no means a toothless state-sanctioned selection, which becomes more of a surprise as it reveals itself to be a politically laced narrative at every turn and in the backstory of each of the characters in the top-notch ensemble — albeit in a less overt manner than in Panahi’s more confrontational project.\n\n\n\tWith a stern demeanor, Ahmad (Banipal Shoomoon), a mustachioed man, tries to soothe a younger guy crying inside a car in the opening scene. Later, while riding in a taxi van across an arid landscape, Ahmad will disclose that he spent time in prison. Bits of piecemeal information about each of the passengers emerge, the deeper they become involved in a situation that could land them all behind bars. \n\t\n\n\tThe driver, Majid (Ali Mohammad Radmanesh), has romantic feelings for his copilot, Najveh (Zakieh Behbahani), a deaf woman in a relationship with a domestic abuser. Naser (Alireza Sani Far), a man whose father was a mortician, carries a suitcase that he will eventually barter for money. Sitting in the back are Peyman (Soheil Bavi) and Bahar (Neda Jebreili), a young couple seeking to leave the country illegally because his political activism has put him at risk of apprehension. Traveling with them is Esmaeil (Reza Amouzad), a down-on-his-luck, desperate man whose tattered clothes and shoes betray he’s in the clutches of near-abject poverty.\n\n\tThere’s one more passenger on board, a man asleep who falls from his seat when Majid abruptly brakes early in the trip. The unplanned stop marks a watershed in their collective journey. A large sum of money enters the picture, but so does a dead body they have to deal with. Zarnegar operates with a superbly calibrated screenplay. He must tread lightly when approaching controversial subjects in his homeland or face the fate of Panahi (recently sentenced to a year in prison and banned from leaving Iran). The exasperated traveler’s exchanges, often cautiously accusatory, play out as if they are all testing how potently they can imply that the others want to keep the cash for themselves. The taut scenes provide the actors with a playing field to shine individually in heated arguments, sobering moments of empathy and painfully honest talks about what comes after a life-altering event.\n\n\tTheir decision on how to proceed must be made before reaching a checkpoint. Both lying and telling the truth about what happened could land them in similar trouble. If they all can agree on something, it is their distrust of institutions. That they get accosted halfway through by police officers who treat them with suspicion despite not knowing what they hide proves their hesitation. In turn, the stacks of dollar bills offer a chance that none of them thought possible. Naser, for example, could pay for his wife’s medical treatments. Their respective sorrows could be, if not erased entirely, at least diminished. When the men discuss the exchange rate between the U.S. currency and the Iranian toman, the precariousness of their realities is presented in a materially concrete way.\n\t\n\n\tAgainst the blank backgrounds in the middle of nowhere, cinematographer Davood Malek Hosseini can concentrate on the most notable elevations in sight: the sulking faces of these men and women who wish to uphold their honor, at least in front of the others, but who are tempted to act selfishly, facing a moral conundrum while in need. The causes of their affliction are not only known but hovering over them, and they all lead back to those in power and their handling of the country. The explicit mention of the death penalty as the source of one passenger’s misery, and their need for blood money — a possibility for everyday citizens — as well as Peyman’s youthful rage against the injustices forcing him to flee, feel definitely charged with defiance, even if measured.\n\n\tIn the end, the only witness to their choices is the sand that will hide their secret and one another’s consciences. In the tradition of Panahi, Asghar Farhadi, Mohammad Rasoulof and other Iranian filmmakers whose stories hinge on impossible tests of morality under unimaginable sociopolitical constraints, Zarnegar delivers a gut-punch of an ending that renders whatever modicum of hope they’d attained null. Their win can only come at the expense of someone else’s suffering. Though they all knew that from the onset of the ordeal, guilt settles in.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCary Elwes, who starred in Rob Reiner’s 1987 fantasy classic “The Princess Bride,” released a statement on Instagram Monday night in remembrance of the director and his wife, Michelle Singer, who were found dead in their Brentwood home on Dec. 14.\n\n\t“Enough time has passed that I can finally put my grief into words,” Elwes wrote in the caption of his post. “I was 24 when I first met Rob Reiner on ‘The Princess Bride.’ And from that very first meeting I fell in love with him. I was already a fan of his work so meeting him in person was a dream come true. As we began spending more time together I knew this was someone I wanted in my life.”\n\t\n\n\n\tElwes recalled that the first thing he noticed about Reiner was that he “wore his heart on his sleeve,” and “always tried to find the best in people.” He added that Reiner “loved making movies,” but more than that, he loved “the experience itself” of creating a film.\n\n\t“He used to say, ‘Once the movie is released it belongs to other people. But while you are making it, that’s your time on the planet, so you wanna make it good,’” Elwes remembered. “And boy was my time with him on ‘The Princess Bride’ beyond great. I can’t remember a single day without laughter. The movie is about love, loyalty and sacrifice. Things that Rob held dear. Which is among the many reasons he was the perfect person to direct it.”\n\n\tElwes closed his statement by thanking Reiner and Singer for sharing their life with him and the world at large.\n\t\n\n\tHe concluded, “Because my heart still aches every time I think of you, I know the grief of losing you too soon will likely never go away. Sure, death cannot stop true love but life is pain without you.”\n\n\tReiner and Singer’s cause of death was “multiple sharp force injuries,” according to records from the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner. Hours after they were found dead, their son, Nick Reiner, was arrested and booked on suspicion of murder on Monday morning. He was charged with two counts of murder in the death of his parents on Tuesday afternoon.\n",

China’s animated sensation “Ne Zha 2” is ready to watch on HBO Max after earning $2.1 billion worldwide, which makes it the top grosser of 2025.

Its creep factor begins with Sally Hawkins’ impishly disturbing performance as a foster mother from hell, who takes a couple of orphaned siblings — 17-year-old Andy (Billy Barratt) and his legally blind sister, Piper (Sora Wong) — under her broken wing… the movie finds terrifying ways to get under your skin, pushing everything to the brink of transgression, using domestic trauma to create a symphonic projection of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, all sealed by Hawkins’ gargoyle grin of evil.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBugonia (Peacock)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tYorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone’s latest collaboration “Bugonia” was named the fourth best movie of 2025 by Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman: “Lanthimos’s wild and woolly kidnap drama is a violent, hate-fueled, thrillingly warped act of cinematic screw-tightening. It’s also rooted in a humanity that sneaks up on you… For a while, it’s like watching ‘Misery’ restaged as a riveting culture-war two-hander. But Stone and, especially, Plemons keep deepening their characters. (He does a piece of acting that’s like tragedy on the high wire.)

From Variety’s review:  “The movie is a likably bent portrait of a community whose residents revel in their energized dysfunction, which is never so cartoonish that it can’t inspire an honest laugh.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Perfect Neighbor (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tNetflix picked up the acclaimed documentary “The Perfect Neighbor” out of Sundance earlier this year in a deal worth nearly $5 million. The movie examines Florida’s Stand Your Ground laws and gun regulations and uses police bodycam footage to tell the story of how a neighborhood dispute slowly escalated into a shocking act of violence. It follows a tragedy that captivated national attention, one in which a woman named Ajike “AJ” Shantrell Owens was shot and killed by her neighbor, Susan Lorincz, after Lorincz kept complaining about children playing near her apartment.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Phoenician Scheme (Peacock and Prime Video)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWes Anderson’s “The Phoenician Scheme” arrives on Prime Video at no extra cost to describers after streaming on Peacock earlier this year.

From Variety’s review: “It’s a throat-ripping vampire movie. And a simmering, layered portrait of a small-town Mississippi Delta community in 1932… it’s exhilarating to take a ride in a popcorn fantasy this heady, where the forces of evil add up to an oppressive destiny. Coogler has vowed that there will be no sequel, but the Marvel-style post-credits teaser leaves you wanting and imagining one.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSorry Baby (HBO Max)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tEva Victor’s Sundance darling “Sorry Baby” was named by Variety as one of the best of 2025: “Writer-director Victor plays a promising young grad student named Agnes whose academic career is all but derailed when her thesis adviser crosses the line. The incident occurs off-camera but redefines how Agnes perceives the world — from the judgmental classmate who sees no big deal in sleeping with her professor to the supportive best friend (Naomi Ackie) who offers unconditional understanding.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSteve (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCillian Murphy plays a troubled teacher in Netflix’s “Steve,” which Variety praised as the year’s “best Netflix movie” last month: “Reteaming with ‘Small Things Like These’ director Tim Mielants, the ‘Oppenheimer’ star plays a desperate reform school teacher opposite a rowdy ensemble of totally convincing young actors… A profoundly moving and superbly acted diamond in the rough, ‘Steve’ is better than anything the streamer has pushed for best picture to date.

That lends the film emotional stakes.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTogether (Hulu)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDave Franco and Alison Brie play a husband and wife whose move out of the city takes a horrific turn when their bodies start to literally mesh together in this Sundance horror sensation. From Variety’s review: “Michael Shanks’ movie is megaplex-ready, but it’s an over-the-top horror film with something on its mind… this is more of an over-the-top roller-coaster acid-trip if-it-looks-weird-do-it freak-out of a movie.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTrain Dreams (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Clint Bentley’s moving adaptation of Denis Johnson’s Pulitzer Prize finalist novella has steadily emerged as one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year — and a potential dark horse best picture contender, Variety’s Clayton Davis recently wrote about the Netflix original “Train Dreams.” Set in the early 20th-century Pacific Northwest, the film stars Joel Edgerton as Robert Grainier, a solitary railroad worker navigating profound personal loss as the American frontier expands around him.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Ugly Stepsister (Hulu)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“The Ugly Stepsister” freaked out the Sundance Film Festival at the start of the year and is now arriving on Hulu this month.

But ‘Weapons’ came out of the box as a bold new breed of chiller. What made Zach Cregger’s film the sleeper sensation of the year wasn’t just that it seemed to erupt out of nowhere, but that it was such a tingly and enticing off-ramp drama, influenced less by the dictates of horror than by the puzzle-piece gamesmanship of ‘Pulp Fiction.’”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Wedding Banquet (Paramount+)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAndrew Ahn’s “The Wedding Banquet” is a thoroughly enjoyable dramedy based on Ang Lee’s 1993 original of the same name. The film follows Angela (Kelly Marie Tran) and her girlfriend, Lee (Lily Gladstone), who are trying to have a baby through IVF but can’t afford to pay for another round of fertility treatment. Their closeted friend Min (Han Gi-chan), who is also the heir of a multinational empire, has a student visa that’s about to expire. When his boyfriend Chris (Bowen Yang) rejects his marriage proposal for various reasons, he pops the question to Angela instead.

As the officer approaches, he says matter-of-factly, \"Bet you know why I'm here ...\"\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    Ashwaubenon Dept. of Public Safety\n          \n    \n          When she acts aloof, the officer explained it was because of the video he had just seen of her getting belligerent with two customers.\n      \n    \n          She gives her side of the story, claiming ... \"They came here and harassed me. I have PTSD. They knew exactly that I was ill. This is not the first time.\" But when pressed on what they did to her, she says, \"I don't know. They started threatening me. I don't know. I have no idea.\"\n      \n\n          What's even more bizarre ... when asked how they threatened her, she claimed she also didn't know. Then, the officer -- just as confused as all of us -- pleads with her to cooperate so he doesn't have to arrest her for disorderly conduct.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    Ashwaubenon Dept. of Public Safety\n          \n    \n          While she gives him her name and information, she gets testy with the officer, again, and accuses him of being sent there by someone the officer has clearly never heard of.\n      \n    \n          Check out the second video ... the couple in question details the interaction from their point of view after the cop's back and forth with the employee.\n      \n    \n          As you may recall  ... the employee was recorded using the n-word multiple times at the couple while also proudly proclaiming herself a racist -- speaking directly to the camera and saying she doesn't care if the whole world knows it, and making lewd gestures. No surprise -- she was subsequently fired.\n      \n    \n          Check out the audio of the man calling police to report the situation.\n      \n    \n          The nature of the woman's PTSD is unclear, or how that prompted their exchange ... after all, it appears they just wanted a snack.\n      \n      ",

People are pointing to messages where I was polite, grateful, or vulnerable — and trying to use that to discredit me.”\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          He continues, “When someone has influence over your career, your income, your future, you don’t feel free. Survivors often stay cordial. They often ask for help when they feel desperate.”\n      \n    \n          Rodriguez adds that the messages don’t negate his allegations. “That does not mean abuse didn’t happen. Those text messages were sent at a time when I was especially vulnerable, as can be seen from the context. Continued financial support and access are not inconsistent with abuse — they are often part of the power dynamics that follow it.”\n      \n\n          We broke the story ... the texts allegedly show Rodriguez asking Perry for financial help to address a dental health issue. The messages also appear to show Rodriguez thanking Perry repeatedly for his support and friendship.\n      \n    \n          The texts were allegedly sent before Rodriguez filed a sexual assault and sexual battery lawsuit against Perry on Christmas, accusing the movie mogul of making unwanted advances and, in one instance, allegedly grabbing his penis.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Perry’s attorney, Alex Spiro, strongly denies the claims, telling TMZ ... “This is nothing but a $77 million money grab scam.”\n      \n    \n          Tyler denies all allegations against him.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Mario Rodriguez\n              \n                          \n                Tyler Perry\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Comedy\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tProducers Xavier Yamamoto and Simon Barrionuevo have come aboard the animated feature “Neelu,” marking a significant milestone for director Saraswathi’s four-year passion project through an international co-production deal spanning Spain, France and Belgium.\n\n\t“Thrilled to sign the contract and hire Saraswathi as the director of the film,” said Barrionuevo, who is joining Yamamoto to formally announce their collaboration on the animation feature.\n\t\n\n\tThe deal brings together producers from three European countries to support the India-set story, which follows a 19-year-old tribal girl from south India who moves to the city to pursue her dreams. After marrying the man she loves, she uncovers a female foeticide plot threatening her friend and must choose between her marriage and saving an unborn child when her husband accepts a bribe to silence the illegal gender-based pregnancy scheme.\n\n\n\tSaraswathi, known professionally as Vani, first pitched “Neelu” at the Film Bazaar’s Co-Production Market in 2023, where it gained early support from industry figures including Anu Singh, Vivek Mirchandani, Dora Babu and Mike Yattam. The director is a celebrated leader in the animation and VFX space who was instrumental in setting up the Academy Award-winning studio Rhythm & Hues in India, Malaysia and Taiwan. Her credits include visual effects work on “The Hunger Games,” “The Incredible Hulk,” “R.I.P.D.” and “Snow White and the Huntsman.”\n\n\tHer production company Dancing Atoms raised approximately $225,000 in angel investment from Los Angeles to help finance the project.\n\t\n\n\tYamamoto is CEO of Cinema Libre and Sunyata Films, French and Belgian production companies, respectively. His credits as producer include “The Dance of Reality,” “Il padrone delle note: Josquin Desprez” and “Waorani Omede Beye Ante Nee Adani.”\n\n\tBarrionuevo has worked on several productions as an animator and producer.\n\n\tWith the international producers now attached, the French and Belgian teams are preparing to expand the property beyond the feature film. They are gearing up to transform “Neelu” into a graphic novel and webtoon series in 2026 to build out the universe for the characters. The film’s script is currently being translated into French as part of the strategy to secure additional funding.\n\n\tSaraswathi participated in the 2025 WAVES Film Bazaar, as the International Film Festival of India’s (IFFI) market component is now known. She credits her success to the strong support system provided by fellow filmmakers who “support her and cheer for her and her projects.”\n\n\tPavan Balagam serves as executive producer and VFX director on the project. His extensive visual effects credits include “The Rundown,” “Assassin’s Creed,” “Superman Returns,” “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,” and “Robin Hood.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tAcclaimed filmmaker Shekhar Kapur delivered a stark warning to Hollywood studios and tech giants at WAVES Film Bazaar, declaring that artificial intelligence will trigger the collapse of traditional entertainment industry hierarchies and predicting that major corporations built on high entry barriers may not survive the transition.\n\n\tSpeaking at a session titled “Bringing AI and Creativity Together to Craft Stories that Inspire,” moderated by Sujay Sen, executive VP and global head of interactive services at LTI Mindtree, the director of “Elizabeth” and “Bandit Queen” emerged from judging entries for India’s first AI Film Festival with a provocative assessment: “Large corporations are about to fall because the pyramid is going flat. New corporations will be formed.” \n\t\n\n\tWAVES Film Bazaar is the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), where Kapur is the festival director.\n\n\n\tKapur’s comments came after viewing entries from 181 teams who participated in a 48-hour AI filmmaking hackathon, creating two-minute films on the theme of “memories” using only AI tools. The participants were not professional filmmakers but artists, students and writers exploring AI’s creative potential. “The first thing I said is that we should retire. Literally, I’m not kidding,” Kapur stated, noting the quality of work produced in such a short timeframe would have been impossible with traditional filmmaking methods.\n\n\tCentral to Kapur’s thesis is what he calls “the collapse of the pyramid” – the breakdown of traditional hierarchical structures in both corporate and creative industries. He illustrated this with a parable about a CEO preparing to raise $10 billion who discovers that his cleaning lady, armed only with AI prompting skills and intuition, can write a better investment pitch than his MIT and Harvard-educated team.\n\t\n\n\t“The cleaning lady knows more about raising $10 billion than he does because she learned the art of prompting and went at it with full force and emotion,” Kapur explained. “She had intuition, and she used her intuition with all the help from AI.”\n\n\tThe director argued that AI drastically lowers entry barriers to filmmaking. “The best thing about AI is it’s the most democratic technology. There is a $300 million film that can now be made in $300,000. If it’s India, it can be made in $30,000,” he said.\n\n\tKapur predicted that major studios and large corporations will face collapse as AI democratizes content creation. He pointed to practical limitations already constraining traditional cinema: “In India, we have only 8,000 working screens. We keep talking about India as the greatest filmmaking nation in the world, but we have only 8,000 screens,” he noted, adding that similar constraints exist in the U.K. and the U.S.\n\n\tHis solution: AI will create its own distribution platforms, much as TikTok and YouTube have done. “We have to assume, if you want to tell stories and you can’t get to a theater, an AI film could do very quickly. I can make an ‘Avatar’ for YouTube of the same quality with AI.”\n\n\tKapur also issued pointed warnings to executives: “CEOs tell me, ‘Oh my God, what’s going to happen to jobs?’ And I tell them, be careful of your job, because people will not want to work for you. AI will allow people to explore themselves. Everybody will want to be their own CEO.”\n\n\tHe cautioned tech companies with massive AI valuations as well: “Don’t trust tech companies and their trillion dollar valuations. It’s like poker. Nobody’s seen any money, nobody’s seen their cards. We are in the potential of the valuation of these huge AI companies being driven by Wall Street.” The filmmaker believes places like India and China will lead AI adoption because “here we need AI for people to progress.”\n\n\tDespite AI’s capabilities, Kapur emphasized that the technology cannot replace fundamental human experiences. “AI cannot be human. AI is artificial intelligence. We don’t even know where intelligence resides,” he said, noting recent neuroscience research suggesting intelligence may reside in the heart and microbiome as much as the brain.\n\n\tThe director argued that human qualities like hope, fear and faith remain beyond AI’s reach. “The only time that AI can take over humanity is if we have so much inertia that we become predictable,” Kapur explained.\n\t\n\n\tWhen asked about AI’s current limitations in filmmaking, Kapur identified a major challenge. “In AI, we still don’t know how to create close-ups, and there’s a very specific reason: we have something that science has not worked out yet – a relationship between pupils,” he explained, noting that human pupils change thousands of times per second in ways current technology cannot replicate.\n\n\tAddressing concerns about shorter attention spans driven by social media, Kapur suggested the causality might be reversed: “Is it getting shorter and shorter because we are becoming as human beings having shorter attention spans? Or is it getting shorter because films are getting shorter?”\n\n\tDespite this, Kapur insisted storytelling fundamentals remain unchanged. “Storytelling never changes. Storytelling is the way we communicate with each other. Everything is a story,” he said, citing influences from Japanese director Kurosawa Akira, whose visual storytelling transcends language barriers.\n\n\tDuring a lighter segment, Kapur revealed his favorite actor is his uncle, late Bollywood icon Dev Anand, and identified Kurosawa as his greatest directorial influence. \n\n\tThe session concluded with Kapur’s philosophical response to a time machine thought experiment, noting that time itself is relative: “Time is your perception of past, present and future. There is no time unless you perceive it.”\n\n\tThe AI Film Festival’s hackathon entries will be screened on Nov. 26. LTI Mindtree is partnering with Shekhar Kapur Films on the initiative, with plans to introduce AI filmmaking to students at a music school in Mumbai that Kapur helps run.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndia’s Reliance Animation has secured character IP rights to develop an animated series based on the life of soccer legend Diego Maradona.\n\n\tThe Mumbai-based studio, a division of Reliance Entertainment, will create a scripted series chronicling Maradona’s journey from his early years to international stardom for streaming and television platforms. The project is currently in development, with details on the creative team, distribution partners and launch timeline to be announced.\n\t\n\n\tThe deal was brokered in partnership with SATTVICA SA, the Argentina-based rights holder of Maradona’s IP, and mediated through Bridge Marketing Group Inc. The series will explore key moments in Maradona’s career, his personal struggles and his cultural influence both on and off the pitch.\n\n\n\t“We are thrilled to bring the extraordinary story of Diego Maradona to a new generation through animation,” said Shibasish Sarkar, CEO of Reliance Entertainment. “His journey of resilience, passion, and achievement transcends sports, and we believe it will inspire audiences worldwide.”\n\n\tTejonidhi Bhandare, CEO of Reliance Animation, described the project as a landmark moment for the studio. “Our team is committed to capturing the spirit, struggles, and triumphs of Maradona’s life in a way that resonates with viewers across ages and cultures,” Bhandare said.\n\n\tRita Maradona, representing SATTVICA SA, added: “We, Diego’s sisters, are very happy and proud of this new project with such a prestigious company as Reliance, with which we will seek to reach the children’s audience and for all the children of the world to know our brother.” \n\t\n\n\tSamuel Nieto, CEO of Bridge Marketing Group Inc., the global licensing agent for the Diego Maradona brand, added that the partnership “will help extend the legacy of the great Diego Maradona in the mind of future generations of young athletes around the world. It is going to be a beautiful story told through the magic of animation.”\n\n\tThe news was unveiled on the sidelines of WAVES Film Bazaar, the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa.\n\n\tReliance Animation is part of Reliance Group’s entertainment sector, with operations spanning production, digital platforms, gaming and music.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndia’s Platoon One Films has boarded Pramati Anand’s debut feature “A Late Autumn Dream” as lead production company.\n\n\tThe project was among six titles selected for the Women in Film India delegation to the Toronto Film Festival earlier this year and was a official selection at the NFDC Screenwriters’ Lab at the WAVES Film Bazaar in Goa, as well as Rewrite 1.2 by Studio Ainak.\n\n\tWritten and directed by Anand, “A Late Autumn Dream” blends socio-political drama with lyrical mystery, exploring themes of identity, displacement and human connection. Set against the mist-covered hills of Meghalaya, the story follows Jonaki Das, a Bengali anthropology student, and Banteim, an Indigenous Khasi girl, who become lost in a mysterious forest rumored to be haunted by a mythical serpentine creature. As an interstate border conflict intensifies around them, the two young women must navigate both the wilderness and their cultural differences to survive.\n\t\n\n\tThe project aligns with Platoon One Films’ focus on IP-driven storytelling with cross-platform potential. “Today, films are deeply IP-driven – and that influence extends far beyond the screen into games, merchandise, and other immersive experiences,” said Shiladitya Bora, founder of Platoon One Films. “We have been looking for stories that can live across formats, worlds that are universal yet adaptable to this market. In many ways, ‘A Late Autumn Dream’ fits perfectly into that vision – it’s a world rich enough to grow, evolve, and expand far beyond the film itself.”\n\n\n\tAnand’s screenplay draws from personal experience. “I worked on a UNESCO project documenting the Indigenous craft of weaving living root bridges. It was there that a close friend’s near-death experience deep in the forest and my own unsettling premonition of it compelled me to write about what had happened,” Anand said. “The film grew from that moment, and from my own desire to understand the nuances of identity, the invisible lines we draw between ourselves and others, and the quiet ways we continue to seek belonging.”\n\t\n\n\tPlatoon One’s “Bayaan” premiered at Toronto earlier this year and “Bindusagar” at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa, of which WAVES Film Bazaar is the market component.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEmily Watson will be honored with the Richard Harris Award at this year’s British Independent Film Awards.\n\n\tThe award celebrates an actor’s outstanding contribution to British film and has previously been bestowed upon Samantha Morton, Riz Ahmed, Kristin Scott Thomas, Daniel Day-Lewis, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Julie Walters, Stephen Graham and Sophie Okonedo. \n\n\tWatson began her career on stage in the ’90s as part of the Royal Shakespeare Company. She received her first Oscar best actress nomination for her debut film role in Lars von Trier’s “Breaking the Waves” (1996), and was also nominated two years later for Anand Tucker’s “Hilary and Jackie.” Her other memorable films include “The Boxer” (1997), “Punch-Drunk Love” (2002), “Red Dragon” (2002), “Corpse Bride” (2005), “Synecdoche, New York” (2008), “War Horse” (2011), “The Theory of Everything” (2014) and “Small Things Like These.” More recently, Watson starred alongside Cillian Murphy in the Netflix drama “Steve” and opposite Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley in Chloe Zhao’s Oscar-tipped “Hamnet.” \n\t\n\n\t“Emily’s first film was Lars von Trier’s epic ‘Breaking the Waves,’ which is like saying the first mountain she climbed was Everest,” Richard Harris’ children Damian, Jared and Jamie Harris said in a statement. “It was a fearless and devastating performance and was rightly recognized with multiple honors, and her first Oscar nomination. Since then, there have been a succession of Emily Watson performances that have again rightly been acknowledged with nominations, honors and awards, including a BIFA. Emily is too young to be called a national treasure, but any performance of hers is a cultural event and she enhances the quality of everything in which she appears. She rightly takes her place alongside the past recipients of the Richard Harris Award.” \n\t\n\n\tAdded Watson: “I’m delighted and deeply honored to be receiving this award. I’ve had the great privilege of spending time with Jared as an actor and raconteur, hearing thrilling wild tales of his dad and the force that he was. I’m so grateful to the Harris family for thinking of me. Truly an honor. Thank you BIFA.”\n\n\tThe 28th BIFA Awards ceremony will take place Nov. 30 at London’s Roundhouse. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThere are no mistakes: Late artist Bob Ross‘ happy trees are about to once again help out public broadcasting. On last week’s 2025 finale of “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver,” the host convinced the Bob Ross estate to auction another of the PBS TV stars’ paintings to support public media. And it has paid off: Ross’ “Cabin at Sunset,” which he painted on a Season 10 episode of PBS’ “The Joy of Painting” in 1986, had fetched around $1,044,000 after 35 bids.\n\t\n\n\tAs bids closed on Monday night at midnight ET, this represented a new auction record for a Bob Ross painting. Earlier this month, Bonhams Los Angeles auctioned off three more of Ross’ “Joy of Painting” works, to support American Public Television — the company that continues to distribute “Joy of Painting.” On Nov. 11, “Winter’s Peace” (1993) sold for $318,000, while “Cliffside” (1990) went for $229,100 and “Home in the Valley” was sold at $114,800. All told, those three paintings nabbed $662,000 — and are now dwarfed by this new figure.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn the show’s Nov. 16 episode of “Last Week Tonight,” Oliver detailed how the decision by the Trump Administration and Congress to eliminate $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting earlier this year has severely impacted radio and TV stations, particularly in rural areas. That’s why the show launched “John Oliver’s Junk,” a website with 65 items (most from the show) that were up for bid to support public broadcasting — including “Cabin at Sunset.” \n\n\tAll told, the auction raised nearly $1.54 million for the Public Media Bridge Fund, which is assisting local public broadcasters in temporarily finding new funds in the wake of the CPB closure.\n\t\n\n\tThe Bob Ross painting was, of course, the majority of that sum. But other major items included a chance for someone’s photo to appear in a graphic over Oliver’s shoulder during an episode (as well as two VIP tickets to a live show taping), which fetched $100,025. A trip to New York to meet Oliver netted $51,600, while a signed case of “SauvignJohn” wine grabbed $13,025.\n\n\tOther items included Russell Crowe’s jock strap (“worn by Russell Crowe in the major motion picture Cinderella Man and later purchased by ‘Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,’ during season 5 of the show, as part of Crowe’s ‘Art of Divorce; auction in which Crowe sold his personal belongings to pay for his divorce”), which earned $21,000; and “Mrs. Cabbage Oliver” (“John Oliver’s on-screen wife, married during an on-screen wedding officiated by Steve Buscemi. Part of ‘Last Week Tonight’s’ season 9 segment on AI-generated art in which John marries a cabbage in the studio”), which scored a bid of $11,111.\n\n\tAlso: A large, gold-plated re-creation of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s balls (“Sculpture of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s scrotum, part of the season 12 segment on presidential libraries”) landed $25,500, while five wax Presidents of the United States ranged from $6000 (Bill Clinton) to $3,333 (William Henry Harrison). Golden Adidas sneakers (“Gold sneakers John Oliver promised to wear in a season 2 episode of ‘Last Week Tonight with John Oliver’ if scandal-ridden FIFA President Sepp Blatter stepped down”) picked up $5,148.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“We’ve actually accumulated a bunch of weird artifacts on this show over the years that we could definitely auction off to raise some much needed money,” Oliver said on last week’s show. “I am proud to announce last week tonight’s first ever auction in aid of public media. This is real!” Proceeds will go to the Public Media Bridge Fund, which is assisting local public broadcasters in temporarily finding new funds in the wake of the CPB closure.\n\n\tIn the case of the Bonhams auctions, those three paintings were part of 30 Bob Ross works that will be sold over the next year, with American Public Television directing all of its proceeds to support public TV stations across the country.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTokyo-based filmmaker Anshul Chauhan is expanding his independent production banner Kowatanda Films into India, with horror feature “Nava” marking the company’s first local production. The project reunites Chauhan with actress Shweta Tripathi, who will star and produce through her newly formed company Bandarful Films.\n\n\tSet in the wetlands of Sundarbans, “Nava” follows Tara Sen as she returns home and becomes entangled in a generations-old mystery involving river gods and family secrets. Writer Akash Mohimen penned the screenplay for what’s being described as a culturally rooted genre piece.\n\t\n\n\t“As an Indian who has spent many years living in Japan, people sometimes find it unusual that I make Japanese films,” Chauhan said. “Japan, and especially Tokyo, has given me everything. It shaped me as an artist and as a person. But at the end of the day, I am Indian too, and a part of me has always wanted to tell stories in Hindi.”\n\n\n\tThe director revealed he spent three years attempting to break into the Indian market before deciding to establish his own production infrastructure. “There are only a handful of true producers here, people who actually know how to see a film through, explore co-production funds, work with subsidies, incentives, and find solutions when private or studio financing doesn’t land,” he explained.\n\n\tKowatanda Films India will be led by Chauhan as producer and director, alongside producer Mina Moteki and executive producer Sohrab Bozorgchami. Bozorgchami brings 14 years of line producing experience on projects including “Maidaan,” “Chup” and upcoming films “Sumo Didi,” “Lala & Poppy” and “Happy Patel.”\n\t\n\n\tChauhan and Moteki founded Kowatanda Films as a Tokyo-based independent studio. The company has produced “Bad Poetry Tokyo,” “Kontora,” “December” and latest feature “Tiger,” which premiered at Busan International Film Festival 2025 and had its Indian premiere at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa, where Japan is the focus country. “Tiger” is set for release across Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, with North America and Europe targeted next.\n\n\tTripathi said the collaboration aims to transcend international boundaries. “‘Nava’is a film that draws from the soil of Bengal and the complexities of coping with one’s ancestral past, and yet speaks a universal language of haunting and healing,” she said. “I’m excited to join hands with Kowatanda Films as we bring this atmospheric, unforgettable world to life for global audiences.”\n\n\tMohimen, a Drishyam-Sundance Screenwriters’ Lab 2015 fellow, has co-written projects including “Rukh” and crime series “Bhaukaal.” He is also developing a Japanese-language film with Chauhan scheduled to shoot in Tokyo next year, plus another Japan-set horror project.\n\n\tBandarful Films is simultaneously preparing LGBTQ+ love story “Mujhe Jaan Na Kaho Meri Jaan,” co-starring Tillotama Shome and written and directed by Sonjoy Nag. The company also has a detective crime dramedy and a satire about image maintenance in development.\n\n\tChauhan relocated to Tokyo in 2011 after working as an animator on projects including Indian National Film Award winner “Delhi Safari.” His directorial debut “Bad Poetry Tokyo” won the Grand Prix at Brussels International Film Festival, while “Kontora” received the Grand Prix at Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival and the Obayashi Award in 2020. “December” premiered at Busan in 2021 and enjoyed theatrical release across five territories.\n\n\tThe director is represented by CAA and Range Media Partners, with plans for production in the U.S. and across Asia.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLeading Indian filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani drew a full house at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) with a dynamic session unpacking how writing and editing shape a film’s emotional core, using examples from “3 Idiots,” “Lage Raho Munna Bhai” and his wider filmography to show how meaning, tension and character can shift entirely through the arrangement of shots, sound and structure. \n\n\tJoined by longtime collaborator Abhijat Joshi, he explored the idea that writing is emotion imagined while editing is emotion experienced, arguing that conflict remains the heartbeat of cinematic storytelling.\n\t\n\n\t“A good editor plays with your emotion,” he said, referencing American filmmaker D.W. Griffith. “Magic can happen while editing.”\n\n\n\tWhile editing, Hirani said, “Editing can really change the meaning of a story. And how does it happen? When you write something, your unit of writing is a word, and many words make a sentence, sentences make a paragraph, a chapter, and finally a book. Similarly, the unit of editing is a shot. The shots by themselves might not contain the entire meaning, but when they’re put together with many other shots, a new meaning emerges. Now imagine being able to change the shots, flip the shots. A shot also will have sound. Take the sound from here, put it somewhere else. A film will have 10,000 shots. You have the liberty of using transitions, music, sound effects. So you can actually completely transform from what it was intended to be.”\n\n\tHirani and Joshi spoke about their process which begins with the concept that “writing is emotion imagined” while editing is “emotion experienced.” A film, they said, begins when a character “wants” something, conflict is “oxygen” while exposition must be hidden under drama and conflict.\n\t\n\n\t“Conflict in life is not something which is welcome. But in cinema, without conflict, things get very boring very quickly. Conflict is the heart of cinema,” Joshi said, adding that the strongest drama arises when two valid, opposing truths collide.\n\n\tHirani urged writers to ground their stories in lived experiences. “A good writer must pick triggers from life,” he said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAvani Films has rolled out a new documentary slate featuring two projects nearing completion and a science series in development.\n\n\tThe production company’s lineup includes feature documentaries “Comedians in Bars” and “Dispatch,” both in late-stage production, alongside “Rebus,” a three-part science series currently in development.\n\n\t“Comedians in Bars” ventures behind the scenes of stand-up comedy, capturing the art form’s development in bars, backrooms and late-night venues where material is tested and refined. Partially filmed at the Edinburgh Fringe, the world’s largest arts festival, the documentary features interviews with comedians who view themselves as outsiders despite securing programming at the prestigious event.\n\t\n\n\tThe film presents performers from various countries and subcultures discussing ambition, instability, self-doubt and the combination of determination and discipline necessary to build comedy careers. Drawing from director Anu Vaidyanathan’s touring experience, the documentary examines stand-up comedy as labor, survival mechanism and personal reckoning.\n\n\n\t“Dispatch,” which was selected for the NFDC Producers Lab at the WAVES Film Bazaar in partnership with Storiculture and Netflix, presents an intergenerational exploration of women’s experiences. The documentary unfolds across six movements, following a daughter as she grapples with dual inheritances from her birth family and marriage.\n\n\tThe film examines the transmission of care, discipline, labor and faith through women’s daily work spanning different geographies and generations. Rather than focusing on loss, the project emphasizes themes of continuity through intimate observation and remembered voices.\n\t\n\n\t“Rebus,” the three-part science series, explores human, artificial and ecological intelligence. Developed from Vaidyanathan’s technical background — she holds a doctorate in electrical and computer engineering — the series aims to make AI and quantum computing accessible to general audiences.\n\n\tThe project investigates why advanced systems handle complexity effectively while struggling with simple tasks, and examines what the global technology race reveals about power, ethics and imagination. The series combines cinematic presentation with a comedic tone to illuminate transformative technologies.\n\n\tVaidyanathan is a filmmaker, comedian, author and academic. She authored the HarperCollins bestseller “Anywhere But Home.” \n\n\tHer debut stand-up hour “BC:AD” premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe before running Off-Broadway. Her second show “Blimp” has been adapted into a short narrative film starring Carlos Bardem and developed into a feature screenplay titled “Mis(s)Chief.”\n\n\tWAVES Film Bazaar is the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe toniest screening at last year’s Marrakech Film Festival happened off-site.\n\n\tThe jury president arrived in Morocco with a rough cut of his latest film, which, as luck would have it, starred another juror. With the day’s screenings and deliberations behind them — and months before the finished version would make its world premiere — Luca Guadagnino welcomed Andrew Garfield to a discreet hotel showing of “After the Hunt.” \n\n\n\tThis year’s edition brings that clubby informality squarely into the spotlight. The festival’s longtime president Melita Toscan du Plantier (who is also a producer) has once again assembled a powerhouse jury, presided over by Bong Joon-ho, the Oscar-winning director of “Parasite,” with Anya Taylor-Joy, Jenna Ortega, Celine Song, Julia Ducournau, Karim Aïnouz, Hakim Belabbes and Payman Maadi. Over the course of one week, starting this weekend, they’ll be discovering 13 films by emerging directors playing in competition.\n\t\n\n\t“We’ve tried to position the festival as a bridge between leading figures of world cinema and emerging talents,” says artistic director Remi Bonhomme. “Marrakech is a gateway between Europe and Africa, which allows us to operate both internationally and regionally. At the same time, being at the end of the year places us right in the middle of the Oscar race. We want to embrace that strategic position both geographically and in terms of the calendar.”\n\n\tThis year’s program features many International Feature Oscar contenders – among them “Palestine 36,” “Calle Malaga,” “The President’s Cake,” “A Poet” and “No Other Choice” – alongside gala screenings of “Frankenstein” and “Hamnet,” and conversations with Jafar Panahi, Kleber Mendonça Filho, Jodie Foster, and AMPAS CEO Bill Kramer, making its awards-season footprint unmistakable.\n\t\n\n\tFor Bonhomme, however, this new focus simply foregrounds what was already there. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe festival will close with Palestine’s International Oscar submission “Palestine 36”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Guests want to be here,” he explains. “They value the chance to meet each other in a relaxed setting. Unlike Cannes or Venice, where everyone bumps into each other without real time to connect, Marrakech allows for genuine exchanges. And as the Academy has opened significantly to diversity, many Arab and African filmmakers and producers we invite are now Academy members as well.” \n\n\tBut Marrakech is more than a picturesque version of an FYC screening, swapping the Hollywood Hills for the Atlas Mountains. Bonhomme also wants to leverage that intimacy to integrate emerging filmmakers into the global circuit. \n\n\t“I wanted the festival to be a place where international figures genuinely engage with the region,” he says. “Because these conversations have never been more important.” \n\n\tHe points to Andrew Garfield, who continued promoting last year’s top winner, Scandar Copti’s “Happy Holidays,” long after the festival wrapped. He highlights 2022 juror Vanessa Kirby, who was so moved by best-director winner “Thunder,” helmed by Carmen Jaquier, that she signed on as an executive producer, helped guide the film to Switzerland’s official Oscar submission, and remained involved on the filmmaker’s next feature.\n\n\t And he speaks with particular pride of 2023 jury president Jessica Chastain.\n\n\t“After the closing ceremony, Chastain and her producing partner met with all the filmmakers in competition and committed to following their projects,” Bonhomme says. “She even told me she thought the lineup was stronger than the competition she judged at Cannes — which, I admit, I was very happy to hear.” \n\n\tBonhomme sees the trend continuing with incoming jury president Bong Joon-ho, who awarded the Golden Lion at Venice to “Happening” and then cast its lead, Anamaria Vartolomei, in his very next project.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGuillermo del Toro will receive a tribute before a gala screening “Frankenstein.” He is one of several awards contenders participating in Marrakech’s conversations series as well.  \n\t\n\n\n\n\tFour of the competing titles this year were developed through the festival’s Atlas Workshops incubator, though Bonhomme stresses that participation in the program does not guarantee selection. But he does take particular satisfaction in following projects from their earliest stages to premiere, and then further still.\n\t\n\n\tDrawing on that holistic view — and his previous stint running Cannes’ Critics’ Week sidebar — Bonhomme has strategically positioned Marrakech in the wider festival circuit. To wit: the fact that Copti’s “Happy Holidays” and Asmae El Moudir’s “The Mother of All Lies” both claimed Marrakech’s top prize after earlier recognition from Venice’s Horizons and Cannes’ Un Certain Regard is no coincidence.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Aisha Can’t Fly Away” won the top post-production prize at last year’s Atlas Workshops before premiering in Un Certain Regard. Next it screens in competition in Marrakech.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarrakech Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The market is tough for first and second films,” he explains. “Even if you play in a sidebar at San Sebastián, Locarno, or Venice, it’s hard to get the exposure a first film needs. Sales agents increasingly target two or three key festivals to launch a film, rather than relying on just one. We’ve been shaping Marrakech to be one of those essential stops, positioning films for complementary exposure.” \n\n\tThe Atlas ecosystem — now encompassing development, marketing, distribution, and press initiatives under the Atlas Programs banner — has been central to that strategy. This year, the festival introduces the Atlas Distribution Meetings, bringing together 60 distribution professionals from the Arab world, Africa, and Europe. \n\n\tWhile not a traditional market, this influx of buyers has had a knock-on effect on programming, helping Marrakech secure world premieres like Marwan Hamed’s “El Set,” Meryem Benm’Barek’s “Behind the Palm Trees,” and the international debut of the Australian feature “First Light.”\n\n\tLooking ahead, Bonhomme aims to expand the industry side further, inviting megawatt stars, sales and distribution vets, awards hopefuls and emerging auteurs to connect at the same picturesque setting — and in doing so, creating “another tool within the festival ecosystem that can have a real international impact.”\n\n\t“We’re at a moment when it’s important for international and regional films to be discovered not just in Europe but on the African continent,” he says. “Arab and African filmmakers still rely heavily on European financing and festivals, yet their home audiences are growing. Marrakech can give these films a platform to launch internationally while remaining rooted in their region. That’s my goal going forward.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“First Light” will make its international premiere at Marrakech\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarrakech Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n",

Haro is not eligible for probation.\n      \n    \n          Rebecca and Jake first claimed their son was kidnapped from a Big 5 Sporting Goods parking lot in Yucaipa -- with Rebecca telling cops she was knocked out while changing Emmanuel’s diaper, and woke up to find him gone.\n      \n    \n          But by August, investigators found major holes in her story.

    "body": "\n\tReformation is breaking up — and it’s doing so with Hollywood’s most famous divorce attorney on retainer.\n\n\tThe sustainable fashion label has tapped Laura Wasser — the high-profile attorney who has worked with Angelina Jolie, Kim Kardashian (in her divorces from Kris Humphries and Kanye West) and Britney Spears — as the face of its latest “Divorce Collection.”  Shot by Zoey Grossman, the campaign frames the partnership as a departure from the brand’s recent “boyfriend” era, featuring a campaign with Pete Davidson.\n\n\n\t“We understand this may come as a surprise, given that we just announced last year that we got a boyfriend,” the brand wrote in their campaign announcement Tuesday morning. “But things change… We’re just ready to move on, get back out there, feel sexy again.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tIn the campaign, Wasser models a lineup of sophisticated Ref staples — including slinky, body-skimming dresses and elevated separates — alongside a limited-edition gray sweatshirt emblazoned with the blunt directive: “DUMP HIM.” The sweatshirt anchors the collection’s philanthropic element: 100% of its net proceeds will benefit the Harriett Buhai Center for Family Law, which provides free legal services to individuals navigating difficult domestic situations.\n\n\tThe campaign leans into Reformation’s longtime association with romance — wedding guest dresses, date-night silhouettes — while reframing the conversation. “Our new campaign is all about moving into a sexier chapter of your life, on your own terms,” the brand says, nodding to Wasser’s broader mission to destigmatize divorce and remind clients “that you’re never married to one decision”\n\n\tThe lineup also leans into Reformation’s longtime association with romance — wedding guest dresses, date-night silhouettes — while reframing the conversation. “Our new campaign is all about moving into a sexier chapter of your life, on your own terms,” the brand says, nodding to Wasser’s broader mission to destigmatize divorce and remind clients “that you’re never married to one decision.”\n\n\n\tShop Reformation’s entire “Divorce Collection” here.\n",

Eleanor seems vulnerable, opening up about her own marriage, but as she glides up the stairs, talking about the sacrifices she made, the hardships endured, she drops a bomb on Rachel from the steps above, telling her she will never be good enough for her son.\n\n\tThe scene begins with them on the same level, but by the end, Eleanor has wielded her power over Rachel.\n\n\tEverything Everywhere All at Once\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichelle Yeoh in Everything Everywhere All At Once – 2022\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEvelyn Wang (Yeoh) wants to finish paying her taxes, but she’s exhausted — and the story takes a wild and crazy twist.

    "body": "\n\tReality competition show “King of Drag” has been renewed for a second season at LGBTQ+ streaming service Revry.\n\n\tCasting applications for Season 2 opened Tuesday.\n\n\t“The success of Season 1 made it clear that the reign of the drag kings is upon us,” Revry co-founder and chief creative officer Christopher J. Rodriguez said. “This community has been vying for a platform to highlight their unique take on drag for years, and they’ve embraced the show as their own, which is such an honor for us. We’re also honored to welcome back e.l.f. Cosmetics as our presenting sponsor for the triumphant return of this beloved franchise. We could not hope for a better partner to join us in unleashing a new group of supremely talented drag kings onto the world stage.”  \n\t\n\n\tSeason 1 was hosted by “Somebody Somewhere” star Murray Hill.

We’re building Season 2 for them, and for a new batch of drag kings ready to share their talent with viewers everywhere. It’s a one-of-a-kind opportunity for everyone involved.”\n\t\n\n\tThe inaugural season has surpassed 32 million views to date and yielded more than 30 million social media impressions and over 3.8 billion press impressions, according to Revry.

    "body": "\n\tAfter debuting on Billboard’s Hot 100 more than a year ago, Bad Bunny‘s “DtMF” has finally topped the chart, representing his first time capturing that top spot as a solo artist and not just a featured guest. He previously had a No. 1 credit to his name as one of the artists on Cardi B’s “I Like It” eight years ago, but getting there on his own had eluded him. Iit’s not surprising that a Super Bowl halftime appearance gave him just the edge he needed.\n\t\n\n\tLooking at the newly released top 10 of the Hot 100, you might think Bad Bunny had always been its king. He owns four out of those 10 slots, with the other high-achieving songs being “Baile Inolvidable” at No. 2, “Nuevayol” at No 5 and the four-year old track “Tití Me Preguntó” at No. 7.\n\n\n\t“DtMF” had previously peaked at No. 2 when it came out in January 2025, and as of last week stood at No. 10 on the Hot 100.\n\n\n\tBillboard reports that this is the fourth all- or mostly-Spanish-language song to top the chart. Its predecessors were “Despacito” by Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee featuriung Justin Bieber in 2017; “Macarena (Bayside Boys Mix)” by Los Del Rio in 1996; and “La Bamba” by Los Lobos in 1987.\n\n\tIn this latest chart week, the single enjoyed 43 million streams, up 85% — representing the highest weekly streaming figure for any song in 2026 so far, and the best number for a non-English-language song this decade. Airplay audience impressions stood at 5.3 million, up 56%.\n\n\tThis is not the first time Bad Bunny has four songs in the top 10; he also did it in 2022, when his “Un Verano Sin Ti” album came out and had four of its songs launch that high all at once.\n\t\n\n\tOlivia Dean‘s “Man I Need” is the highest non-Bad-Bunny song of the week, at No. 3, and may yet be poised to finally reach No. 1 if Bad Bunny has some post-Bowl slippage.\n\n\tThe previous leader on the chart, Ella Langley’s country smash “Choosin’ Texas,” falls from No. 1 to No. 4 this week.\n\n\tTaylor Swift‘s “Opalite” had a huge week in many metrics after finally being officially released as a single and music video, although with all the competition this week, that was only enough to get the song back up to No. 8. It debuted at No. 2 back in October when the album “The Life of a Showgirl” came out, and had enjoyed a lot of time in the top 10 since then even without being an official single. Streams for the song increased 76% to 14.2 million after the video’s the Feb. 6 bow. The song sold 7,000 downloads during the chart week. The sales figure will likely be higher in the coming chart week, as pre-orders of 7-inch singles Swift had sold in advance via her website will be shipping.\n\n\tOther tracks in the top 10 include Alex Warren’s “Ordinary” at No. 6, “Golden” at No. 9 and Bruno Mars’ “I Just Might” at No. 10.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrom his earliest works, control has been a theme in Trent Reznor‘s music: Who has it, who craves it and how it’s being deployed. On the Feb. 14 date of Nine Inch Nails‘ Peel It Back Tour in Newark, New Jersey, Reznor, the sole permanent band member since its 1988 inception, took firm control of his band’s legacy, remixing and recontextualizing deep cuts and hits alike to create an urgent, noisy tapestry of his work.\n\n\tOpening on a smaller stage in the middle of the floor, Reznor played the heartbreaking ballad “(You Made It Feel Like) Home,” from his “Bones and All” soundtrack with Atticus Ross, as a solo piano and voice piece. While it was miles from the flood of noise to come, the longing lyrics about young cannibals that just can’t make it in the world were co-opted by scores of goth couples earnestly crooning to each other at the Valentine’s Day show.\n\t\n\n\tReznor was then joined for deep cut “Non-Entity” and remixed early hit “Piggy (Nothing Can Stop Me Now)” by most of the band, with his right-hand man (and only other permanent member) Ross on keys, brand new bassist Stu Brooks and longtime guitarist Robin Finck. Gradually cranking up from the quiet opening, “Piggy” ended with an extended drum outro from recently rehired phenom Josh Freese, which allowed the group to assemble at the main stage for a plugged-in segment.\n\n\n\tFrom the first notes of fan-favorite “Wish,” it was clear Reznor and company were using volume as texture, with roaring guitars that would leave eardrums thumping days later for those without protection. Yet the sound was mixed expertly, especially given an echo-prone arena like the Prudential Center. It was all the more impressive given that, depending on where on the “industrial” and “metal” scale the song landed, Reznor could be on guitar or keys, Freese could be playing in tandem with programmed drums, and Brooks could be on synth bass — yet the balance felt totally in control, if eye-wateringly loud.\n\t\n\n\tThe opening trio of songs — “Wish,” “March of the Pigs” and “The Frail” — made it crystal clear that no matter how many films he scored, Reznor can easily slip into his rock star shit. Impossibly cool at 60 years old, Reznor is all swagger, with his soaring, sneering vocals sounding as strong as his first decade recording. Additionally, the NIN stage show is calibrated with interesting visuals that range from nearly obscuring the band in smoke to projecting them larger-than-life, with skittering lights and strobes that could render the uninitiated (or too stoned) speechless.\n\n\tDuring an inspired middle section, Reznor and Ross travelled back to the B-stage and were joined by tour opener DJ Boys Noize, who did live remixes of some of NIN’s more electronically minded tracks. Opening with “Year Zero” deep cut “Vessel,” the trio didn’t wholly reinvent the songs, but instead added enough drama to remain a vital part of the live music process. This section also included one of the night’s biggest crowdpleasers, the outrageously horny “Closer,” which had the Valentine’s crowd buzzing. The final song on the B-stage was a bit more unexpected, with a take on their bold “Tron: Ares” track “As Alive as You Need Me to Be.” As inessential as the film was, the song felt like a comfortable fit alongside the group’s best material.\n\n\tThe last act of the show was a return to the main stage, where NIN bashed out some beloved fan fare like “The Downward Spiral” album opener “Mr. Self Destruct” and the skittering, catchy “The Perfect Drug,” which was written for David Lynch’s “Lost Highway” well before Reznor was an Oscar-winning film composer. \n\n\tThe closing victory lap — dance-rock track “The Hand That Feeds,” the group’s signature “Head Like a Hole” and mournful closing ballad “Hurt” — was a perfect encapsulation of Reznor’s strength as an artist, able to turn songs about anger, defiance and pain into arena-shaking rockers. And even if he is spending part of his time scoring Pixar movies, he can still blow the roof off a rock show.\n\n\tPictured above: Nine Inch Nails performing on Feb. 5 in New Orleans.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMichelle Yeoh was immortalized in Oscar history when she became the first Asian woman to win an Oscar for best actress for “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” This time, she will be immortalizedon Hollywood Boulevard when she receives a star on the Walk of Fame on Feb. 18.\n\n\t“I remember when I first went to the Walk of Fame because it’s very iconic. You want to go there because all your big heroes who’ve been in the business since you were a kid are there. And I remember looking, ‘Oh, here’s so and so!’ So now just to think that I’m getting it, it’s a dream come true,” Yeoh told Variety.\n\t\n\n\tYeoh was a superstar in Asia, but her Hollywood career began when she played James Bond sidekick Wai Lin in 1997’s “Tomorrow Never Dies.” \n\n\n\tBut her big breakout with Western audiences was in the Mandarin-language “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” (2000).\n\n\tThe international co-production is still the highest-grossing non-English language film in the U.S., with $128 million in domestic box office. \n\n\tYeoh continued to act in Hollywood films, such as “Memoirs of a Geisha.”\n\n\tThen came 2018’s “Crazy Rich Asians.” \n\n\tDirected by Jon M. Chu, it was one of the first English-language films in 25 years to feature an all-Asian cast — including Constance Wu, Awkwafina, Ken Jeong and Ronny Chieng – and it grossed over $239 million worldwide.\n\n\tYeoh became more in-demand for films — including Marvel tentpole “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” — but in 2022, everything changed again. Her lead turn in “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” a twisty, multiverse-leaping drama in which she plays a mother and wife who’s seemingly on her last nerve, brought her Oscar buzz.\n\t\n\n\t“They initially wrote it for a man. I think it’s the norm, because it would be easier tofinance,” said Yeoh at the time. “It would be easier to understand that a guy would multiverse jump. But then they changed it into a mother role, which actually suits the directors [Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert] so much more, because they’re surrounded by very strong, smart women.”\n\n\tThen, in March 2023, she won the Oscar. “For all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight, this is a beacon of hope and possibilities,” Yeoh said from the stage. “This is proof that dreams do come true. And ladies, don’t let anybody tell you that you are ever past your prime Never give up.”\n\n\tShe never gave up. \n\n\tAfter her win, Yeoh went back to London, where she was filming “Wicked.” Chu had cast her as Madame Morrible, a role she was hesitant to take on since she’d also be singing along with performing. Chu remembered, “She would lip-sync, and I was wondering why. I’ve never seen Michelle scared. She is down for anything.”\n\n\tNo matter what he said, he could see how intimidated Yeoh was, but it was one of the film’s stars who stepped in to help.\n\n\t“Cynthia [Erivo] finally said to her, ‘You should sing. Don’t worry, you sound beautiful.’ I think that permission from Cynthia really allowed Michelle to get comfortable, and she was able to become Madame Morrible in that moment where singing wasn’t a song, it was just expression. It was beautiful to see.”\n\n\tYeoh has found herself connecting to younger audiences while continuing to break glass ceilings; she was, in fact, the first Asian woman to play Madame Morrible, and won’t be the last.\n\n\tAfter earning her Walk of Fame star, Yeoh will be seen in fourth and fifth installments on the “Avatar” franchise and will return to the action genre in “The Surgeon” before leading Amazon Prime Video’s “Blade Runner 2099” series.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSean Hannity is promising to show a more casual side of himself on “Hang Out With Sean Hannity,” a new podcast coming next month from Fox News Media.\n\n\tThe twice-weekly podcast will premiere March 3. On “Hang Out With Sean Hannity,” the longtime Fox News Channel host will engage in “unfiltered conversations” with figures across culture, business, sports, politics and beyond. The show will be shot from Hannity’s new set in Florida, dubbed the personal “man cave.”\n\t\n\n\tWith the launch of “Hang Out,” Hannity will be ending his interview show “Sean” on the Fox Nation streaming service.\n\n\n\tHannity said in a statement, “I’ve always been interested in how people got to where they are. The risks they took, the failures they pushed through, and the lessons that don’t make it on TV. This podcast is a chance to slow down and have those conversations, no scripts, no talking points, just real discussions with people who have something meaningful to say.”\n\n\t“Hang Out With Sean Hannity” will be available initially on YouTube and Spotify. The new podcast is separate from his nationally syndicated radio program “The Sean Hannity Show,” which is also distributed across podcast platforms.\n\n\tAccording to Fox News Media, Hannity’s hangout podcast will feature “real, down-to-earth dialogue” that will “spotlight guests’ defining moments, personal setbacks, hard-earned lessons and the true grit the drives achievement.”\n\n\t“Sean Hannity remains one of the most influential voices in media, grounded by the same values and work ethic that defined his early days,” Porter Berry, president of Fox News Digital and New Media, said in a statement. “We’re thrilled to expand our podcast portfolio with one of the most accomplished broadcasters to ever pick up a microphone.”\n\t\n\n\tThe launch of “Hang Out With Sean Hannity” is the latest addition to Fox News Media’s new media division which features an established suite of podcasts such as “Ruthless,” “Will Cain Country,” “Planet Tyrus” and “The Riley Gaines Show.”\n\n\tHannity, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, has spent three decades at Fox News Channel. His primetime program has the highest viewership among cable news outlets in his timeslot, averaging 3.2 million viewers for the full Nielsen year of 2025.\n\n\tThroughout his tenure at Fox News, Hannity has interviewed numerous newsmakers and political figures, including Trump, Elon Musk, Calif. Governor Gavin Newsom, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, actor and director Sean Penn, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and more.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s the morning after the Critics Choice Awards, and “KPop Demon Hunters” has scooped up two trophies: best animated feature and best original song for “Golden.” It marks the first big award win of the season for the Netflix blockbuster.\n\n\tRei Ami, the singing voice of the film’s Zoey, describes the feeling as “vindicating,” adding that there’s finally “validation. It’s long overdue,” she says. “We worked our asses off. We’ve had the door shut in our faces. We were told we were too little, too much.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter years of hard work and rejection, the film and “Golden” (written by EJAE, Mark Sonnenblick, IDO, 24 and Teddy Park) have changed the lives of EJAE (the singing voice of Rumi in the film), rapper and singer Ami, singer Audrey Nuna (the singing voice of Mira), and actors Arden Cho (the speaking voice of Rumi), Ji-young Yoo (the speaking voice of Zoey) and May Hong (the speaking voice of Mira). “Golden’s” lyrics: “I’m done hidin’, now I’m shinin’ like I’m born to be. We dreamin’ hard, we came so far. Now I believe,” seem fitting for their personal stories. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt all began with director Maggie Kang, who helmed the film alongside Chris Appelhans. As a story artist on “Puss in Boots” and “Kung Fu Panda 3,” Kang was driven by a desire to showcase this side of Korean culture “because it didn’t exist.” As the love of K-pop music and Korean food began to rise in America and Europe, Kang recalls, “I felt there was this hunger for Korean content and seeing more culture. I wanted to ride that K-wave and take that opportunity to create something that could embrace all parts of our culture.”\n\t\n\n\tKang’s determination to tell an authentic story has paid off. Since its release last June, “KPop Demon Hunters” has exploded into a cultural phenomenon, becoming Netflix’s most-watched title over a six-month period with 482 million views. Meanwhile, “Golden” topped the Billboard’s Global Exl. U.S. chart for a record-breaking 20 weeks. Wins at both the Golden Globes and Grammy Awards followed. It was nominated for two Oscars: animated feature and original song (“Golden”).\n\n\tOn a sunny January morning in Los Angeles, EJAE, Ami, Nuna, Yoo, Cho and Hong cozy up together on a cream-colored couch at Netflix’s Hollywood office, sipping iced coffee, jasmine green tea and water. Scheduling conflicts had kept them apart until now. It’s the first time all six are sitting down together to talk about the film’s success and the challenges they’ve overcome.\n\t\n\t\tEJAE, you’ve been with this project the longest. What was it that made you say, “Yes, I want to be a part of this?”\t\n\n\tEJAE It was the fact that it was the first Korean-based animated film [from U.S. producers]. I love animation, and I’d never seen animation or anime that had Korea as a background. I’ve seen “Kung Fu Panda” and “Big Hero 6.” There were other Asian cultures represented. I wanted to see Korea, so I was very excited for that, and the story was genius. The fact that they were able to incorporate a concept that could have both historical Korean culture and modern culture mixed into one was genius. And using Korean shamanism as part of a superhero-powered thing in music, I was, “Yeah, I’m sold.”\n\t\n\t\tAnd for the rest of you?\t\n\n\tJI-YOUNG YOO I had a first audition in September of 2022. I read for Rumi first, and six months passed, and I forgot that I had auditioned for it, and they called me back in to read for Mira. Another six months passed, and they called me back in to read for Zoey. And that pattern of several months passing continued.\n\n\tFor my final audition, I went into Sony Pictures Animation and read 25-30 pages. By the time I finished that, between auditioning for Rumi, Mira and Zoey, I think I read the whole script. I did it because I thought it’d be fun, and I thought the project was going to be a really enjoyable time and something that was going to be artistically fulfilling. And it absolutely was.\n\t\n\n\tThe reception of it has been mind-blowing. There’s a good lesson in there somewhere about following your passions and what you love. So it’s been a bit of a journey, but it’s been very fun. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRei Ami, left, and Ji-young Yoo, the singing voice and speaking voice of Zoey, respectively.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tREI AMI I got the audition in late May of 2024 and when the brief came in everyone else had been confirmed. Zoey’s singing voice was last — they couldn’t find her, and I was shocked. I was like, “There are so many talented people who could do it.”\n\n\tBut the only information I got pertaining to the movie was very generic. It said, “KPop girl group, also demon slayers by night, powerful music, and they’re badass and cute.”\n\n\tWith Zoey, the only description I got was that this person needs to be able to sing in Korean and English, but they need to be able to rap extremely fast. I got the material, and it was different snippets of the songs. I recorded on a very cheap $40 mic. I don’t know what this movie is going to do, but it’s everything I love in terms of animation. It’s a Netflix film. It’s music, and it’s based in Korean culture. It’s everything that I am. I said, “OK, let me do this. Let me try.” And I recorded every segment except for the A5 (high note) in “Golden.” I told my manager, Aaron Tropf, “Tell them Rei cannot hit this note. She does not want to hit this note.”\n\t\n\t\tYou kept that note in, right, EJAE?\t\n\n\tEJAE Yes.\n\n\tAMI When I went into the first session, I met Michelle Wong, the producer. She said, “When they sent in your audition and your EPK,” which was my TikTok and music videos, they were like, “Oh, we found her.” She told me that story. And I was super honored.\n\n\tARDEN CHO I did my very first audition in August 2022, and I auditioned for Celine. I remember seeing the storyline and thought, “This is incredible, and this is so cool.” I got all of Celine’s backstory, so I feel like I came into it knowing more than we’re supposed to. I did a little voice recording on my iPhone. It was so funny because I remember, even in the email, I looked back, and I said, “Here you go. Were we supposed to do more than one take? I just did one.”\n\n\tBut I remember being like, “Let me do my most mature, adult, low-pitched, very mom-like voice.” I listened to it again, I thought, “I sound like Rumi.” I remember when I got the callback, but it was for Rumi. They asked, “Would you be interested?” I thought, “But they know I auditioned for Celine, right?” and they said, “They think your voice might fit better for Rumi.”\n\t\n\n\tIt’s mind-blowing that I started recording in December 2023 and then finished a year later. It’s a crazy journey, but I feel super blessed to be able to say that I took a shot for Celine and was super happy to be a part of it, but then to somehow end up the lead. I hope that inspires people that you just never know, and sometimes you might think that you might only be good enough or something, but maybe someone’s got bigger plans for you.\n\n\tMAY HONG I signed an NDA on June 14, 2022. I auditioned for all of them. I recorded from home. I don’t think I had a setup at that point. The callback is the reason why I bought a mic, because I was just doing it on my phone, and I’d never done voices before, and so I did all three on my phone in my tiny office, and it was so obvious from the beginning that Mira was the one. I also did a bunch of sessions in New York; it really did feel like a playpen with Maggie and Chris. It felt so intimate and fun. I can hear in their voices that they’re seeing it as they’re saying the lines – they have a vision. It was fun to see Chris having his eyes closed a lot when we were doing it. I would do the line that he liked, and he would mark with his finger in the air for him to flag that take.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAudrey Nuna, top, and May Hong, the singing voice and speaking voice of Mira, respectively.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAUDREY NUNA It was super organic, because I was in the thick of promoting my second album, “Trench,” at the time, and I’d been asked if I wanted to be involved. My No. 1 core memory of this process was when I performed at SXSW in Austin. I played a set, and I remember getting off stage, and I was not feeling good about the set. I had given it my all, but my sound was horrible. I was super sweaty, and I remember someone named Jojo from Sony Pictures Animation came up to me and was so excited, and I didn’t know who he was. He pulled up from the dark corridor and said, “I think you’d be perfect for this thing we’re looking to do.”\n\n\tI was fixated on the show and a few weeks later, my team asked me if I wanted to hop on a call with Ian Eisendrath, who was executive producing for the project. I was down to hear what it’s about. What sold me when I got on the call with Ian, the first thing he talked about was that it was a movie about Korean American women who are outside the box. They are learning about their identity and who they have to be in this world. From the moment he talked about that core concept, I felt really excited about it, because this was something that I relate to so much, and always walking this tightrope between worlds and trying to understand how I can be more of this or more of that, or rebelling against that in my entire artist project as well. I felt so seen by the concept of the film, and I had to be a part of it. I don’t know where this is going to take me, but I need to be a part of it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThese are all great stories because, in a way, you’re battling demons of rejection, acceptance and being seen, and you end up with this incredible success story. How has this journey helped you battle or overcome some demons?\t\n\n\tAMI We’ve been told we were too little, too much. Every step of my career. You think we started this two years ago? No! We’ve been in this game for a long time. To get this recognition — two out of two last night [at the Critics Choice], we deserve it. And all the demons I have to personally fight and be like, “You know what? You are the bitch. You are that girl. You are that shit.” I had to tell myself every single fucking day, even when I didn’t believe it.\n\n\tCHO On a slightly different note, when you said, this is the first time Variety was having six Korean American, Korean women, Asian women, on the cover, it made me feel emotional, because my entire career, I’ve always felt a bit like being Korean or a woman or Asian American was such an obstacle in this career, in this business, right? I’ve been working for 23 years as an actor, and you get a lot of notes along the way, or you get a lot of things that don’t work out. And I feel like we know — from all of us, from EJAE’s story, from everybody who shares throughout this press run — so much [from each other] that we do have a lot coming into this. You start to hear all these stories of, “Wow, everyone brought so much into it and had the same goal, we just wanted to be seen. We wanted to feel like we belong.”\n\n\tAs Rei said, it is deserving, and it is exciting. Why didn’t we think that we deserved this? We grow up feeling that there’s this expectation of how we should be, and there’s a responsibility of how we should act. But this movie gets to show so many different types of personalities and characters and boldness and fearlessness, and these su- per-hot, badass women who are also goofy, silly and cute. When a guy shows up who’s super smoking hot, things get a little bit cuckoo, and little cray-cray, and all of a sudden they forget that they’re demon hunters, but they’re like, “Ooh, he’s cute.” It’s fun. It just plays that you can be badass, beautiful, soft, and you can still be vulnerable. I love all of that, and I feel all of us in some realms have found some healing in it as the world has. I think that’s what keeps bringing people back to the movie, is that the story is incredibly healing and a connector for everyone.\n\t\n\n\tHONG More than anything between that gap of auditioning in 2022 and getting a callback, it was less about “Did I not get it?” and being disappointed. First of all, I am able to forget that I sent in an audition. That’s a skill we need to have. When I got the callback, I thought, “Yes, this is being made.” I thought it had died, and it wasn’t going to happen because when I read that script, I was excited that it even existed and had come far enough for auditions to begin. We grew up with so little …\n\n\tCHO We never had an opportunity to see Asian girls like that. Even Maggie said it took so long, and there were so many obstacles. And I think there were many points that I’m sure it felt like maybe it’s not going to happen.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEJAE, left, and Arden Cho, the singing voice and speaking voice of Rumi, respectively.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEJAE It was really hard. It was so new in every way. There had never been representation, and this whole hybrid of pop and musical. It was new in every way: Maggie’s first film as a director, Ian’s first time doing animation and K-pop, Mark [Sonnenblick’s] first time doing K-pop, my first film, [music producer] Black La- bel’s first time doing a film. It was very interesting to see everyone come together and work on this incredible story. We had to fight a lot, and I think every single person can understand that part. But because of that struggle, and all the demons that we had to deal with, that’s what made the movie so beautiful and genuine. I think that struggle was needed. I think all those demons were needed for this film, because through that, we were able to find depth in our writing and acting. It hit home. Looking at what Rumi is going through, I was able to relate to that. I think it was really about knowing that your demons will be there no matter what, and just knowing how to navigate, and not to hide that anymore.\n\n\tNUNA The archetypes of the women who are represented in this film … I feel the special thing about this project, in terms of people being able to take something away and be like, “OK, this is how I can,” as EJAE said, “approach my relationship with the demons that I have.” I think a huge part of that is understanding that the three characters, their demons, are also different. Rumi, who’s a perfectionist, that leads to a lot of the darkness and her shadow side. Zoey doesn’t feel enough. Mira has this very tough exterior to defend herself against a world that doesn’t accept her. When you see different types of those struggles being represented, it gives such a nuanced and humanistic view of the human experience, and the fact that it is through Korean culture is an honor of a lifetime.\n\t\n\n\tHONG I very much expected that people would be like, “Oh, I love how badass Mira is.” But a lot of people show up and they’re like, “I love how soft she is.” It’s so nice that that is the feedback, that people see that human side.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve had so much feedback on the film, but is there a story that has stuck with you?\t\n\n\tEJAE I met someone who was saying how much he loved the film because he was transitioning. He said, “This movie made me confident to make this choice to transition.” I was like, “Wow.” Accepting who I am and being confident in who I am, both my flaws and my good, that’s how much it gave life to his life. So that was really impactful.\n\n\tHONG It’s resonating with the queer community. I’ve met a lot of people who are transitioning that say, “I’m done hiding.” A lot of parents of autistic kids tell me that this is one of the first movies that kids have been able to sit through. Someone told me the other day that their nonverbal autistic kid spoke as a result of the movie. It’s intense to have that shared with you, because you know what it means to you, but then when you feel how it’s impacting other people that deeply, there is a weight that you walk away with too, and I’m so humbled by that.\n\n\tYOO We began this year in a state of only [known]IP works. Musicals and stories around people of color and women don’t work. All of these preconceived notions we had of what films work in today’s mar- ket. And I think what’s been exciting to hear is a lot of filmmakers feel reinvigorated that we’re only one movie away from rewriting all of the rules of how we make the industry work. At every step of this process, the film has broken some notion of what we thought the ceiling was like. We didn’t think a streaming movie that had been out for a few months could top the box office for one week- end. We set a record for the most number of songs from a movie soundtrack on the Billboard Top 10. None of these things were things that we thought were still possible in the industry, or at least, a lot of people around me have felt that. So it’s been lovely to hear young and seasoned filmmakers talk about how the movie has been inspiring in terms of what the rules are in Hollywood right now.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIt’s also inspiring seeing how Korean culture, from the food to music, has been embraced by non-Koreans. What does that mean to you to see that? \t\n\n\tNUNA At the premiere, everyone was laughing and having a jolly time. I’m sitting there bawling my eyes out, because it hit such a deep nerve of pain and trauma that we’ve all experienced, of being first generation or from immigrant families, and having to step into rooms where you’re just not welcome at the end of the day. Experiencing that as a kid, especially with food for me – specifically with bringing gimbap to school and kids being, “Ew. What is that? That’s gross.” As a kid, you’re in such a vulnerable place where you don’t understand where it’s coming from or why.\n\t\n\n\tWe grow up and we learn to assimilate into a world that doesn’t accept you, or hopefully decide not to assimilate in that way. I think it’s really interesting the types of things that move me when it comes to the film, because it’s the deeply personal things that seem like small details to me that are the ones that hit the hardest.\n\n\tYOO Major props to Maggie. Chris once said, it takes a lot of guts to be who you are, but it also takes a lot of guts for Maggie as a first-time director, asking to make this movie more Korean. She had to fight for it. Every bit that they fought to keep in the movie pays off.\n\n\tMaggie told the story about how in her elementary school classroom, Korea wasn’t on the map. I remember kids around me not understanding that there were countries outside of China, Japan and Asia. It’s exciting to know that kids won’t have to go through something like that.\n\n\tHONG The retroactive healing that Maggie and Chris provided for all of us.\n\n\tEJAE We are so thankful to Maggie for being determined to bring this story to audiences and for creating these characters, but she also created this incredible sisterhood. \n\n\tCHO I feel it’s so important and meaningful, and Maggie talked about this a lot: these accolades and these wins are so crucial because everybody risked so much to be so culturally specific to fight for these things. Now we’re validated. I feel as Asian Ameri- cans, we’ve had many wins in this industry. With “Crazy Rich Asians,” everyone’s “Oh, my gosh. Is it changing?” With “Shang-Chi,” they were, “Is it changing?” But it’s still such a risk if your movie is Asian American, it’s such a risk if it’s a woman. I hope that this is the movie changes the game for filmmakers.\n\n\tAMI We’ve had to fight — and you can talk to our parents and our grandparents, they’ve suffered under imperialism. They’ve had to fight famine. So when we see these girls have an obsession, love and appreciation for food, it’s because that runs deep in our culture, food is our language and love. It’s how we apologize, it’s how we connect and build community, and to see that, and to see Maggie fight for that, and for that to be finally accepted, respected and kept in the film — huge win!\n\n\tHONG It is vindicating. This is the ultimate Korean revenge film.\n\t\n\n\tCHO Culturally, I’ve noticed a lot of people who aren’t Asian or immigrants didn’t really understand why Rumi felt like she had to listen to Celine so much and obey and respect so much. Every interaction with Celine, I found that unless they were a minority, people were like, “Hmm, that’s weird. Why don’t you be like, ‘F you, I’m out,’” It was so interesting, because it made me have deeper conversations of culture. Our culture is so much about respect, honor and doing the right thing. I realized we have this repressed weight and stress. It’s trauma. In Korean, there’s a very common saying that means “You just have to do it.” I found that finally talking about and having these conversations, at least for minorities, has been super healing. I really love the respect in Korean culture. I love that and forever will love that, but I think there’s still a healthy mind.\n\n\tEJAE I heard from a Korean director who said that if it were made by a Korean director, it would not be the same. The fact that it was made by a Korean Canadian means that we were able to make a film like this that can resonate with both Korea and the world, because our perspective of Korea is also very different.\n\n\tCHO This movie is now, and I feel this is the beginning of showing the world that K-pop, K-fashion, K-beauty … The K is …\n\n\tAMI … It’s no more.

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Are You Happy Now, That I’m on My Knees?,” the series finale of “Tell Me Lies,” now streaming on Hulu.\n\n\tIt’s the end of a very toxic era.\n\n\tAfter three seasons, “Tell Me Lies” came to a very dramatic end, and included the perfect needle drop: Britney Spears’ “Toxic.” To sum up the series finale’s key moments, in the college timeline, Bree (Cat Missal), in a rage of anger after finding out that Lucy (Grace Van Patten) was the person Evan (Branden Cook) had cheated with, releases the tape of Lucy admitting to lying about being raped. As a result of that lie, Lucy gets expelled from college and assumes Stephen (Jackson White) was the one who leaked it. Later, Marianne (Gabriella Pession) flips on Bree, calling Oliver (Tom Ellis), Bree’s mom and Amanda (the underage girl Oliver is sleeping with) in for a meeting to tell Bree that if she doesn’t stop harassing them, Bree will lose her scholarship. Her mother believes them, despite the fact that Oliver and Marianne are gaslighting Bree and lying about what happened.\n\t\n\n\tIn the future timeline, it’s revealed that Bree and Wrigley began having an affair at Bree and Evan’s engagement party. When it comes time for the wedding, Stephen figures out that it was Bree who released the tape of Lucy and decides, in typical Stephen form, to ruin the wedding by revealing all. He grabs the mic and shares a few bombshells: Bree released the tape; he and Lucy slept together that morning; Evan and Lucy had sex in college (even though Bree already knew, but Lucy didn’t know she knew); and that Wrigley and Bree have been sleeping together. Afterward, Bree tells Lucy they can get through this, but Stephen asks Lucy to leave with him instead.\n\t\n\n\tIn true Lucy form, she does leave with Stephen — only for him to leave her stranded at a random gas station in the middle of nowhere. Luckily, she’s able to laugh, as a cover of “Such Great Heights” by The Postal Service plays — the song that first played during a Season 1 party during which Lucy and Stephen wore garbage bags.\n\n\tAhead of the finale, “Tell Me Lies” creator Meaghan Oppenheimer shared that this episode will be the series finale. Below, Oppenheimer and Van Patten break down their collaboration, share why it was the right time to end the show — and answer all the burning questions not answered in the finale.\n\t\n\t\tI want to go back and start with the collaboration between you guys, and what you really remember about this connection from the start.\t\n\n\tGrace Van Patten: I remember our first meeting ever on Zoom. And I loved the meeting so much, it made me even more passionate. I had only read the pilot. Once I met with Meaghan, I was like, “Oh, this person wants to tell a real, human story about these young people going through such a relatable thing, and that is just something I’ve always wanted to be a part of.” I thought it was such a new, fresh angle to see it through these young people’s eyes. And I just loved how passionate Meaghan was about it. So it was instantly a deep conversation about what these characters were going through, which was such a relief that it wasn’t just another young adult cliché show. It was really dealing with layered emotions.\n\n\tMeaghan Oppenheimer: Grace, you were so young! I remember talking to you about the instability of that time in life and those initial relationships. I remember being so struck by Grace’s stability and maturity, because she has such depth. I know that you don’t feel this way always on the inside, but you present as a very steady presence to people, in a really great way. Whenever you’re working with Grace, you feel safe. You feel like the material is in safe hands. You feel like she gets it. There’s just a real reliability about her that is so rare and such a blessing in your No. 1.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMeaghan, how early on did you know about this ending, and when did you tell Grace?\t\n\n\tOppenheimer: We took it one season at a time. I put in my very initial pitch pages that the two timelines were going to culminate together, and one timeline needed to end with Lucy and Stephen’s worst and biggest breakup. That would explain the mental state that she’s in later in her adulthood, where you kind of get the sense that this is a recovering addict. I knew that public downfall we would see unfold, while we also saw the wedding unfold. And I think I talked to Grace about that, that there was going to be some sort of public humiliation. We didn’t know exactly what that would be. But then at the beginning of every season, I talked through the arc with everyone. I think at the end of last season, I said, “I think you probably get expelled.”\n\t\n\n\tVan Patten: Yeah, at the end of Season 1, you were like, something very, very bad has to happen to Lucy.\n\t\n\t\tAs opposed to all the great things that have happened to her! \t\n\n\tVan Patten: Right? Something even worse! I was like, what could be worse than what she’s been through? But you figured it out! It was so great that before every season, Meaghan walked me through the arc. Especially with this show, it’s nice to know what we’re going into, because we know it’s gonna be fucking crazy, so to be prepared for what we’re about to go down is nice. It’s nice to have that mental preparation.\n\t\n\t\tMeaghan, you announced the show will not be returning. When and why did you make that decision?\t\n\n\tOppenheimer: I felt like the story had reached its natural conclusion, and I really didn’t want it to become something else. This story, to me, was always a closed-ended story. It has a beginning, middle and end. This was always a question of what happens to this friend group when there’s a poisonous dynamic at the center? And what happens when they reunite years later? So I felt like this should be the ending. The fans are so loud and loyal, and that’s kind of all you can hope for. We definitely talked about whether there are any other organic ways to move forward. We just kept coming back to the same thing: It felt like anything else would feel like an epilogue.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGrace, Lucy made one last horrible choice at the end — getting in Stephen’s car, only for him to desert her at a gas station. But at least he left her purse! How do you feel about Lucy’s ending?\t\n\n\tVan Patten: I really do have hope that it was the last wrong choice. I think she needed that final confirmation of who this guy is. I think it had been enough time where you forget! How long had it been? Six years since they saw each other? But it wasn’t a real end to the cycle. It wasn’t her doing, so she’s clearly been thinking about him. He’s still consuming her mind, and at a very vulnerable spot at the wedding, once he blows everything up, I think that’s when she’s most susceptible to running back to him. She’s always subconsciously looking for a sliver of an opening to go back to him, and she did, and she got that confirmation she needed. That’s why I love that she laughs at the end, because you think she might cry, and then it’s like, “Oh, my God. I see it perfectly now.” There’s freedom in that, relief in that. I like to hope that it’s exactly what Lucy needed to start a new chapter of her life.\n\t\n\n\tOppenheimer: Totally. Because also, even though she was away from him, it was still within the confines of this group and all the secrets that were still being kept within this group. She was still so full of shame toward Bree over Evan, not knowing that Bree knew, not knowing what Bree had done to her. She had never chosen Stephen over her friends. So now in her mind, she’s like, well, maybe it would be different if I chose him over my friends — and obviously it’s not. We’ve learned that Stephen will only let someone go if he makes the decision, and so if she had turned him down, she wouldn’t be free of him. He’d come back around in a couple of years. He has to be the one to cut that cord and to feel like he has the last laugh for her to actually be free.\n\n\tIt felt like the perfect ending to me, because it felt inevitable. One of the themes of this season, for me, was inevitability and the consequences of these actions during this time of your life where you think nothing is that permanent and nothing is that serious, and then actually finding out that it is. The consequences can really matter. I really wanted to show serious stakes of what happened for Lucy and making these decisions around Stephen, because I think it is a little bit of a cautionary tale.\n\t\n\t\tGrace, how did you react to learning Bree was the one who released the tape?\t\n\n\tVan Patten: I was really surprised, especially because that friendship is so tight and so beautiful at the beginning of the season. It’s really emphasizing their closeness. In Season 2, they were totally each other’s confidants, and have been through a lot together and have found safety in one another. So to hear that, it was like, what the hell happened? But also, it makes sense. \n\n\tI love how Bree did it so impulsively. Then you instantly see her feel so bad, and you can feel the regret. Lucy finding out at the wedding is a complete betrayal. But also, I can see them working things out. I can see Lucy thinking, “All right, we’re even now.” I’m hoping that after the finale, it pushes Lucy to really do some work on herself and focus on the relationships that actually mattered in her life. Bree was one of them, and I think that she could work it out with her, and I hope she does.\n\t\n\t\tMeaghan, people online have been very vocal about the many burning questions they had going into the finale — and not everything was answered, so I’m going to do some rapid-fire questions here about what wasn’t answered. Maybe you have a backstory for them, maybe not. Let’s start with: Did Oliver and Marianne just get away with it?\t\n\n\tOppenheimer: So I have thought about this. I think they got away with it. But he’s gonna get #MeToo’d. We haven’t gotten to that [time period] yet.\n\t\n\n\tVan Patten: Will Bree be the one to do it?\n\n\tOppenheimer: No, I think Bree’s got enough of her own shit.\n\n\tVan Patten: She’s, like, on a farm somewhere with Wrigley!\n\n\tOppenheimer: Yeah, she doesn’t need to take that on. But yeah, he gets #MeToo’d. I don’t think he and Marianne are still together in 2015. That’s a very toxic relationship.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDid Bree ever find out about Evan’s lie about her mom? She wasn’t at the wedding, right? He really became a villain this season!\t\n\n\tOppenheimer: No. That’s what she believes is a betrayal from her mom, and she doesn’t forgive her for that. She just kind of digs in with Evan after that.\n\n\tIt felt like, if you’re hanging out with someone like Stephen, it’s going to influence people. I think there’s this idea of how guys sort of defend their guy friends about things that they would never defend other people in. I wanted to play with that, and Wrigley going the other way. Wrigley becoming the guy that is, like, “No, fuck it. I’m gonna stand up for these girls.” Evan, turning, it was definitely a decision that happened later.\n\t\n\t\tWhat happened to Lucy after she was expelled, and how did she re-meet Max?\t\n\n\tOppenheimer: I think Lucy had a few months where she was in therapy, getting better. I think she went to some not-as-great school, probably the following year, graduated a year after her friends. As we know, she went into sales instead of writing. I think she probably met Max in New York. They connected, and he probably heard what happened to her, and he’s a good guy and had empathy for her. I think she probably reached out to be like, “Hey, I’m sorry that I was insane,” but it was a safe relationship that required a bit of delusion on both of their parts.\n\n\tVan Patten: She doesn’t deserve him. He’s so good. I just want the best for Max. He’s so innocent, he’s so sweet. But I get it, the sweet guys always end up with the crazy girls. That’s what happens, so it makes sense. It’s not unrealistic to me. But they probably shouldn’t have been together. Lucy probably shouldn’t date for a while.\n\t\n\t\tHow did Stephen and Lydia get together? \t\n\n\tOppenheimer: I’ve had people ask that a lot! That moment at the end of Season 2, when she’s talking about what a dick Lucy is, and he’s like, “Oh, maybe I’ll see you around sometime,” that’s the clue. He’s gonna seek this girl out, out of a shared enemy, basically. I think that after she gets expelled, he still doesn’t feel like he beat her. Stephen believes that Lucy might have had something to do with him not getting into Yale. I think he just assumes that that was her doing, and also, she fucking chose Bree! He sees them hugging, and he’s still mad. He doesn’t feel like he’s won. So he reaches out to Lydia and tells her everything she wants to hear about what an evil dick Lucy is. They get together based on a shared hatred. I actually read some study that said the most successful relationships are ones that have a common enemy, which I don’t know if I agree with! But yeah, what’s not to like with Lydia? She’s hot, she’s rich, she offers him a lot of things that he likes — but I think he’s definitely using her.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDid Chris also get #MeToo’d?\t\n\n\tOppenheimer: I feel like he probably didn’t.\n\n\tVan Patten: I feel like he got away with it.\n\n\tOppenheimer: So many people after #MeToo were like, “Did we cancel all the men? Was it too much?” And I know so many men that are living their best lives right now. They’re probably wondering when it’s gonna happen, but they’re fine. And they shouldn’t be. So I think a lot of people get away with things.\n\t\n\t\tWhat happened to Alex, and why wasn’t everyone’s favorite drug dealer at the wedding?\t\n\n\tOppenheimer: Bree, probably, in her relationship with Evan, needed to distance herself from different aspects of the darker parts of her past, and I think that he served a purpose for her when they came back together in college. He’s someone who is a loner and goes his own way, and if she’s not the one reaching out to him to keep that connection, he’s going to respect that space. I think they probably just fell out of touch kind of organically, but have no hard feelings with each other. Also, it would have been really awkward for him to be invited, with Lucy as her bridesmaid. Even though fucking Stephen was invited, but that’s because of Evan. I wonder if Lucy and Alex find each other in their 30s, maybe.\n\n\tVan Patten: I know, maybe!\n\n\tOppenheimer: I like them together a lot.\n\n\tVan Patten: I feel like they could figure it out. They’re both damaged in a similar way.\n\n\tOppenheimer: They’re both very non-judgmental people, which is something I really appreciate about Lucy.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen did you decide you wanted Bree and Wrigley to be together?\t\n\n\tOppenheimer: It was always a possibility. I always do about six weeks of prep before I start the writers room, when I kind of figure out what I want the season to be. And it was during that time, I always send a long email to everyone about what I think the season is going to be. And at the end of it, I was like, “Bree and Wrigley are endgame.” Everyone was like, what? But then as soon as we got into it, it worked.\n\n\tOne of the reasons I gave him such a hero moment this season, not just with the Bree stuff, but with all the other stuff that happens is [because] Spencer gave an interview, like, a year and a half ago. He was like, “I feel like we know that he’s not going to win in the future, because we see where he’s at. And I wish he could have a win, but I respect whatever happens.” And I was like, “I’m gonna give you a win.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tStephen is still the worst of the group, right?\t\n\n\tOppenheimer: For sure. He’s the poison that creates all the other mayhem. I think a lot of these people would not be as bad if it wasn’t for his influence. But I think it’s funny, I get a little bit upset about how so many people are like, “Oh, Lucy’s as bad as Stephen.” What show are you watching? Stephen has done things that are so much worse than everyone else. I think he also has a lot of qualities that are incredibly charming, and you can’t help but watch, but I think he’s the worst!\n\t\n\t\tGrace, how do you feel when you hear people say Lucy’s as bad as Stephen? \t\n\n\tVan Patten: She’s not innocent in the situation, 1,000%. It takes two to tango. This relationship is not toxic just because of Stephen. But the main difference to me with Lucy and Stephen is that Stephen’s toxicity is ingrained in him. It’s compulsive. I don’t think he has any control over it. Lucy is trying to play the game or something. I do truly believe that Lucy has good intentions; she just is incapable of manifesting them in the right way. You see her fail at that over and over, and but she’s also so young. I have complete faith that Lucy will figure herself out in a way. Stephen is who he is, and he will never change.\n\n\tOppenheimer: She’s very reactive. Her toxic moments are pretty much always in reaction to something, trying to make something, trying to stop something, trying to undo something. She is depressed when we meet her. I think that coldness that they talk about, that’s how her depression has manifested. Some people, when they’re depressed, are just more reactive. They’re not coming from a stable place. They’re kind of batting away whatever is coming at them.\n\n\tVan Patten: And you see her with guys besides Stephen — she doesn’t treat them great either. Her dad died. She has no fatherly figure. She has no healthy love from a man, and she probably has no idea what she needs or deserves or even wants. I think she’s going by trial and error, and wants different things from these different people that come through her life — but is completely controlled by how Stephen has made her feel, and just continues to project that feeling onto every relationship she’s had since him, which is so tragic to watch.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

Then, Thomas passed just days before turning 95.\n      \n    \n          Thomas' death marked another heartbreaking chapter in Wendy's very public personal and legal struggles.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          She's been in a highly restrictive guardianship for more than 3 years, despite the latest neurologist testing saying she doesn't have frontotemporal dementia -- the medical condition is what a judge used to justify the guardianship after Wendy's guardian claimed Wendy was suffering from dementia.\n      \n    \n          In light of the new medical confirmation ... Wendy's powerhouse lawyer Joe Tacopina has said he will demand a jury trial and ask jurors to free Wendy if the judge refuses to end the guardianship.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Thomas Williams\n              \n                          \n                Wendy Williams\n              \n                          \n                Joe Tacopina\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Photo Galleries\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tThe editorial board of the Washington Post, owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, expressed approval of President Donald Trump‘s “aggressive” move to tear down the White House‘s East Wing in order to erect a massive ballroom funded by private corporations — including Amazon.\n\n\t“Strong leaders reject calcification,” the Washington Post editorial board said in the op-ed, titled “In defense of the White House ballroom,” published Saturday.\n\t\n\n\t“Many see the rubble [of the East Wing] as a metaphor for President Donald Trump’s reckless disregard of norms and the rule of law,” the Post’s editorial said. But others “see what they love about Trump: A lifelong builder boldly pursuing a grand vision, a change agent unafraid to decisively take on the status quo and a developer slashing through red tape that would stymie any normal politician.”\n\n\n\t“In classic Trump fashion, the president is pursuing a reasonable idea in the most jarring manner possible,” the Post editorial said. The piece claimed that privately, “many alumni of the Biden and Obama White Houses acknowledge the long-overdue need for an event space like what Trump is creating. It is absurd that tents need to be erected on the South Lawn for state dinners, and VIPs are forced to use porta-potties.”\n\n\tBezos, currently executive chairman of Amazon, bought the Washington Post in 2013 and owns it in his personal capacity. He has recently made several changes to the legendary paper, including overhauling the Post’s opinion section earlier this year to focus on “personal liberties and free markets” rather than “broad-based” issues. After Washington Post editorial opinion page editor David Shipley resigned following Bezos’ decision, the paper in June appointed Adam O’Neal, a former correspondent for the Economist and an opinion writer for the Wall Street Journal, as opinion editor.\n\t\n\n\tTrump’s planned gold-gilded ballroom, to be built where the East Wing once stood, will cost an estimated $300 million. Amazon is one of the donors to the project, according to the White House. \n\n\tThe Post’s editorial acknowledged that “the fundraising for the ballroom creates problematic conflicts of interest,” but it did not identify Amazon as among the donors. \n\n\tAfter raising those ethical issues without additional discussion, the Washington Post’s editorial board said in the piece that “Trump’s aggressive approach” is “justified.” The op-ed cited two examples: a yearslong delay in getting approvals for improving White House perimeter fencing after a 2014 incident in which a fence-jumper made his way inside the White House; and an even longer approval process for the erection of the “modest” Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial near the National Air and Space Museum.\n\n\tOther corporate donors to Trump’s new ballroom include Comcast, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and T-Mobile. Google also is listed as a donor; Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, agreed to pay Trump $22 million as part of settling the president’s lawsuit alleging “censorship” over YouTube’s suspension of his account for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. According to court documents, Trump directed the $22 million go toward the construction of the new White House ballroom.\n\n\tIn its Oct. 25 editorial, the Post said, “Preservationists express horror that Trump did not submit his plans to their scrutiny, but the truth is that this project would not have gotten done, certainly not during his term, if the president had gone through the traditional review process. The blueprints would have faced death by a thousand papercuts.”\n\n\t“The White House cannot simply be a museum to the past,” the Post editorial concluded. “Like America, it must evolve with the times to maintain its greatness. Strong leaders reject calcification. In that way, Trump’s undertaking is a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere.”\n\n\tTrump’s teardown of the East Wing included the demolition of the White House’s 42-seat movie theater, which FDR installed in 1942. Over the years, the theater was home to President Barack Obama’s screenings with the casts and crews of “Lincoln” and “Selma”; Richard Nixon’s viewing of “Patton” the night before the Cambodia invasion; JFK’s second screening of “From Russia With Love” the day before he was assassinated in Dallas; and Jimmy Carter’s screening of “Apocalypse Now,” attended by Francis Ford Coppola, prior to the movie’s premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, according to the New York Times.\n\t\n\n\tTrump himself once watched “one of his favorite movies,” Billy Wilder’s 1950 classic “Sunset Boulevard,” in the East Wing theater, per the Times.\n\n\tPictured above: An excavator works to clear rubble after the East Wing of the White House was demolished on Oct. 23, 2025, in Washington, DC..\n",

    "body": "\n\tAnother win for anime. \n\n\t“Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc,” the latest offering from Sony’s Crunchyroll, was No. 1 at the box office with $17.2 million from 3,003 North American theaters. It’s the second consecutive success for Crunchyroll following September’s sleeper hit “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle,” which cemented a genre record with its $70 million debut.\n\n\n\tTo a lesser degree, “Chainsaw Man” also eclipsed expectations while managing to outpace a movie about one of the biggest names in music (Disney and 20th Century’s musical biopic “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere“), an adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s best-selling novel (Paramount’s romantic drama “Regretting You”), as well as last weekend’s champion (Universal and Blumhouse’s “Black Phone 2”). \n\t\n\n\t“Regretting You” opened in third place with a better-than-expected $12.8 million from 3,393 venues. Meanwhile, “Deliver Me From Nowhere,” starring “The Bear” actor Jeremy Allen White as the Boss, underwhelmed at No. 4 with $9.1 million from 3,460 locations. And “Black Phone 2” slid to second with $13 million from 3,460 theaters, declining 52% from its domestic debut. So far, the horror sequel has earned $48 million in North America and $80.4 million globally, marking a needed win for Blumhouse in what’s otherwise been a rough theatrical year for the low-budget horror empire.\n\n\t“Chainsaw Man,” which serves as a sequel to the popular manga TV series, is playing in subtitled and dubbed versions. It’s also showing on premium large formats such as Imax, which carry higher ticket prices. Audiences bestowed the film an “A” on CinemaScore exit polls, the highest grade in the top five on box office charts. Nearly 75% of opening weekend crowds were males, while 50% were under the age of 25 years old. Anime features tend to be front-loaded with substantial drops in subsequent weekends. Even if that happens, “Chainsaw Man” has already connected at the international box office with $70 million and counting.\n\t\n\n\t“This opening follows a big success in Asia. But it’s not just Asia. Anime is doing well everywhere now,” David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, says of “Chainsaw Man.” “This is a worldwide phenomenon.”\n\n\tOverall, this weekend is down 20% from the same frame in 2024 when Sony’s comic book threequel “Venom: The Last Dance” opened to $51 million. And while domestic year-to-date revenues are 4% above last year, the box office is pacing around 20% below pre-pandemic times, according to Comscore. Attendance is expected to remain on the lighter side until the holiday season, when Universal’s musical adaptation “Wicked: For Good,” Disney’s animated sequel “Zootopia 2” and James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” make their way to theaters.\n\n\t“Springsteen” launched below projections at the international box office with $7 million, bringing its global tally to $16.1 million. The biopic cost $55 million, and since theater owners keep roughly half of the ticket sales, the film needs to keep rocking at the box office to justify its price tag. Luckily, moviegoers appeared to like the film more than critics; “Deliver Me From Nowhere” landed a “B+” grade on CinemaScore and holds a 61% Rotten Tomatoes average.\n\n\t“Deliver Me From Nowhere” takes a less conventional approach compared to other recent musical biopics about artists like Bob Dylan (“A Complete Unknown”) or Bob Marley (“One Love”). Instead of focusing on his mainstream rise or the making of his biggest hits like “Born in the U.S.A.” or “Born to Run,” director Scott Cooper’s film chronicles the writing of Springsteen’s 1982 critically adored (but less commercial) acoustic album “Nebraska.” Ticket sales were initially tracking a similar start to last year’s “A Complete Unknown,” featuring Timothée Chalamet as the “Like a Rolling Stone” composer in his earlier years. But that film, from Disney’s Searchlight banner, ended up faring better with $11.6 million to start. “A Complete Unknown” also had the benefit of playing over the holiday season and eventually powered to $75 million domestically and $140 million globally.\n\n\t“As a genre, these pictures have the natural advantage of great music,” Gross says. However, he caveats that “Bruce Springsteen was not a controversial figure; his music was not part of a social movement; and he did not hurt himself with self-destructive behavior.” Unlike commercial hits in the vein of Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” or Elton John’s “Rocketman,” this film is a “smaller story […] about the artist’s struggle for his unique voice.”\n\t\n\n\t“Regretting You,” produced by Constantin Films, earned another $10 million overseas for a worldwide start of $22.85 million. Audiences were mixed on the movie, which earned a “B” grade on CinemaScore and stars Allison Williams and Mckenna Grace as a mother and daughter who grapple with the aftermath of a devastating accident. “Regretting You” cost $30 million and marks Hoover’s second novel to get the big screen treatment following “It Ends With Us,” which became a breakout hit with $344 million worldwide. If “Regretting You” sticks around on the big screen, it’ll cement Hoover as a major cinematic force. Her books “Verity” and “Reminders of Him” are currently being adapted by other studios.\n\n\tDisney’s sci-fi tentpole “Tron: Ares” rounded out the top five with $4.7 million from 2,940 venues in its third outing. The film, which carries a massive $180 million price tag, has grossed just $63 million domestically and $123 million worldwide to date.\n\n\tAlso new to theaters was Neon’s supernatural thriller “Shelby Oaks,” which bowed at No. 7 with $2.3 million from 1,823 locations. The film follows the fictional disappearance of a YouTube star and amateur ghost hunter in the abandoned town of Shelby Oaks. The movie was saddled with a “C+” grade on CinemaScore, which is typical for the horror genre but doesn’t necessarily bode well for word-of-mouth.\n\n\tIn limited release, director Yorgos Lanthimos and star Emma Stone’s latest collaboration, “Bugonia,” kicked off with $690,000 from 17 locations — averaging a strong $40,588 per location. Stone plays a high-powered CEO who is kidnapped by two conspiracy theorists who believe she is an extraterrestrial being sent to destroy Earth. The film’s commercial viability will be tested when Focus Features expands “Bugonia” nationwide next weekend.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile “Orion” is an ambitious indie space saga, its examination of human nature is decidedly earthbound.\n\n\tThe film stars Andrew McCarthy as Jim, a NASA bigwig tasked with helping Apollo (Drew Van Acker), an astronaut with memory loss, figure out what happened to cause his ship to crash and leave the other crew dead. Their back-and-forth makes up the core of the film, as twists, turns and discoveries gradually unfold.\n\n\n\tDirector Jaco Bouwer found plenty of grounded elements in Anne Vithayathil’s script for “Orion.” Audiences will set sail on the film’s maiden voyage when it has its world premiere at FilmQuest in Provo, Utah, on Oct. 25.\n\t\n\n\t“I don’t think we have an absolute truth anymore in this world,” he says. “This really touches on that without being super on the nose. Science fiction intrigues me a lot. I like the genre because it’s a little bit more of an expressionistic way of going about emotions.”\n\n\tBouwer credits his collaborators for helping walk the film’s tricky tightrope of making a largely two-hander feel expansive. He cites McCarthy’s curiosity about the script — which is miles from the Brat Pack roles that first made him famous — as one big benefit.\n\n\t“He needs to know exactly what’s going on,” Bouwer says of McCarthy. “He really portrays Jim in a good way: There’s a cerebral aspect to him, he’s the master manipulator. In our film, there’s a moment towards the end where we do see some part of humanity behind it. I find him really professional, and I think his range is much bigger than we’ve seen before.”\n\n\tBeyond the dialogue, Bouwer and his cinematographer David Kruta were eager to make the contained film feel taut and dynamic — no easy feat on an indie production.\n\t\n\n\t“We actually used quite a few different lenses,” Bouwer says. “For the flashbacks, we used anamorphic, and we also changed the ratio. We sometimes went extreme wide-angle. Most of the effects were done in-camera. For me, it’s always performance first, so it’s important that the actors feel that. Because everything happens under one roof, the movement is motivated. So I would come in in the morning and we would block it in a way, and once we’ve done that, then I had a meeting with my DP to see how we can best choreograph the camera to suit them. Sometimes it’s purely for a visual, but mostly it was plotting their journey and letting the camera follow them or capture them in the best way.”\n\n\tAlso critical were the sparingly-used glimpses of the further regions of outer space, which helped to convey the scale of the story — including a stunner of a final scene. \n\n\t“Especially that shot at the end, you pull back and just see the smallness and the scale of it,” Bouwer says. “There’s something really great for me, and emotional and sad as well, about that image. It’s kind of subliminal, but it was always in the back of my mind to make it feel that there is something bigger around. It makes the world bigger, although it’s a two-location film.”\n\n\tAnd while the vastness of the universe is worth considering, Bouwer had the most fun conjuring all of the fun and thrills out of a small-scale story.\n\n\t“I was really trying to mislead the audience in subtle ways,” he says. “I think it boils down to performances. If the performances weren’t believable, you’re in big trouble. So I was very happy to have Drew and Andrew as my main guides through this maze of twists and turns.”\n\n\tWatch the first footage of “Orion” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDuring a recent sit-down with NPR, Guillermo del Toro asserted that he would “rather die” than use artificial intelligence, “particularly generative AI,” in any of his future films. He compared the growing cultural fascination surrounding the controversial tech to the “arrogance” displayed by the titular literary madman in his Netflix adaptation of “Frankenstein.”\n\n\t“AI, particularly generative AI — I am not interested, nor will I ever be interested,” del Toro said. “I’m 61, and I hope to be able to remain uninterested in using it at all until I croak. … The other day, somebody wrote me an email, said, ‘What is your stance on AI?’ And my answer was very short. I said, ‘I’d rather die.'”\n\t\n\n\tThe “Pan’s Labyrinth” director explained that the true dangers aren’t with the technology itself, but with “natural stupidity,” which could drive the mishandling of AI. He added that “natural stupidity” is what pushes “most of the world’s worst features.” He went on to connect the character of Victor Frankenstein to those at the forefront of AI development.\n\n\t“I did want it to have the arrogance of Victor [Frankenstein] be similar in some ways to the tech bros,” he said. “He’s kind of blind, creating something without considering the consequences and I think we have to take a pause and consider where we’re going.”\n\n\tDel Toro’s “Frankenstein,” adapted from Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel of the same name, stars Jacob Elordi, Oscar Issac, Mia Goth, Christoph Waltz and Ralph Ineson. The film comes to Netflix on Nov. 7.\n",

She said no, this was a first.”\n\n\t“The Hunt for Ben Solo” was set to take place after the events of “The Rise of Skywalker,” and would have followed Driver’s Kylo Ren, aka Ben Solo, on a search for redemption. Driver called the unmade film “one of the coolest” projects he’s ever been a part of.\n\n\tSoderbergh had previously told AP of developing “The Hunt for Ben Solo,” “I really enjoyed making the movie in my head. I’m just sorry the fans won’t get to see it.”\n\n\tOn Friday, Collider reported that a group of “Star Wars” fanatics paid for a plane towing a banner reading “Save ‘The Hunt for Ben Solo’” to fly over Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Calif. A reporter for the outlet was able to take pictures of the stunt while on location.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe latest poster for “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” features a painting of Bruce Springsteen in concert, viewed from the side, his index finger held high in the air. If you examine his face, you’ll see that it looks a lot more like Bruce than it does like Jeremy Allen White, the actor who plays him. You can understand why: Jeremy Allen White doesn’t look very much like Springsteen. (There’s a touch of last-minute desperation to that poster.) The lack of an acute resemblance isn’t fatal in a biopic, but it’s one of a number of things about “Deliver Me from Nowhere” that just feel…off.\n\t\n\n\tAnother disarming detail is the aha moment when Bruce first gets the idea for “Nebraska” by catching “Badlands” on TV. In a way, it makes sense — the album’s title track will be told from the point-of-view of Charles Starkweather, the sociopathic killer who’s the antihero of Terrence Malick’s famous film. What’s odd about the scene is that three years before it takes place, back in 1978, Springsteen released “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” an album whose greatest song was … “Badlands.” (It was always clear that title was a nod to the movie.)\n\n\n\tThat said, the pivotal thing that feels off about “Deliver Me from Evil” is “Nebraska” itself. I can’t even talk about this without being accused of blasphemy, because there is such a mystique surrounding that album, in all its lo-fi acoustic demo-with-reverb Dylan-meets-Suicide dark-heart-of-America austerity. No one ever deviates from calling “Nebraska” a “masterpiece” and one of Bruce’s greatest records. The album is one of the dour sacred cows of music criticism, right up there with such landmarks of anhedonia as “White Light/White Heat” and “Unknown Pleasures.” At the time of its release, Greil Marcus, writing about it as if he was adding a chapter to his seminal book “Mystery Train,” called it “the most convincing statement of resistance and refusal that Ronald Reagan’s USA has yet elicited, from any artist or any politician.” Marcus set the template for viewing “Nebraska” as a political album, and that was embodied in its stripped-down aesthetic, its whole Bruce-vs.-the-overblown-music-industry aura.\n\t\n\n\tThere’s just one problem. (Blasphemy alert!) “Nebraska” is an arid art film of an album — poetic to a fault, with a couple of good songs, like the title track and “Atlantic City,” but I’ve always found it to be a piece of dusty folk-rock wallpaper. It you love it, fine, but my point is that whatever claims of greatness are made for the record, they have almost nothing to do with what people have loved about Bruce Sprinsteen for 50 years. His music is deep, and yes it can be dark, but mostly Bruce, as an artist, radiates rock ‘n’ roll joy. And that’s the quality that’s perversely missing from “Deliver Me from Nowhere.”\n\n\tAt home, when I’m making dinner with my daughters, we always play music, and mixed in with the new stuff I like to give them a dose of music history, so I’ll play everything from Nina Simone to Steely Dan to the Clash to ELO to Dylan to the Spinners to the Ramones. But the one time I put on “Nebraska,” we were four tracks into it when Sadie, who is 13, looked at me with a wince of pain and said, “Can we play something else?” She had never said that before, and I was amused to see her reaction directly echoed in the movie by the Columbia Records executive Al Teller (David Krumholtz), who hears a couple of minutes of the record and then says can you please take it off. It’s not just that the album “isn’t commercial.” For many of us, there’s a punishing monotony to “Nebraska.”\n\n\tThe album, in its way, is all about pain, and “Deliver Me from Nowhere” captures how creating the record all by himself in his New Jersey bedroom was therapy for Bruce. That’s a moderately interesting chapter in the larger Bruce saga, and when he actually goes to therapy, the film treats it as cataclysmic — as if millions of us haven’t been there, and as if he was the first rock celebrity who ever walked into a shrink’s office.\n\n\tThe core issue the Bruce of the film is dealing with is the trauma inflicted upon him as a boy by his hard-drinking, abusive, ’50s-macho father (Stephen Graham), who he was desperate to please. “Deliver Me from Nowhere” is supposed to be about the schism in Bruce’s soul, and about how he used the making of “Nebraska” to heal it. But I have another interpretation of what the album means. The myth of greatness that has surrounded “Nebraska” for 43 years, propped up by the music-critic establishment and by Bruce himself (who has said it’s the work of his he feels closest to), is that what matters on the record isn’t so much the music (its bare-bones country vibe, all those goddamn major chords) but the lyrics, which strain at every turn to be badlands poetry. Yet I would suggest that in trying to make a rock album this doggedly artistic and severely high-minded, an album “pure” enough to make Bob Dylan look schmaltzy, Bruce was playing out his demons in a different way. He still had a primal need to please and impress his father, and that’s what “Nebraska” was about. He wanted what this movie gives him: not his due, but a gold star.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs Disney+ develops “Hocus Pocus 3,” Thora Birch, who played young Dani Dennison in the original 1993 film, says she’s willing to reprise the role.\n\n\tDuring an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the actress responded to questions about Dani’s return in the third installment, saying “Yeah, I’d like to know what they land on for how Dani wound up. I’m super open to the idea.”\n\n\tBirch was 11 years old when Disney released the first “Hocus Pocus.” She played the youngest member of the central Dennison family alongside her on-screen siblings, played by Omri Katz and Vinessa Shaw. Though the film failed to excel at the box office upon release, it has since garnered a strong following.\n\t\n\n\t“It was so devastating when it first came out. It was such a bomb and we were all bummed because we loved making it,” Birch reflects, “We were like, ‘What, you don’t like it?’ and then ten years later they’re like ‘Oh my God, are you that girl from ‘Hocus Pocus.'”\n\n\tThe film received the legacy sequel treatment with the release of Disney+’s ‘Hocus Pocus 2‘ in 2022. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy reprised their roles as the central antagonists from the first film, but the original Dennison family ensemble was left out of the sequel. The film was a smash hit for the streamer, accumulating 2.7 billion minutes watched during its opening weekend.\n\n\tPerhaps they will have a chance to return in the threequel. Though Birch expressed interest in the idea, she concedes that the prospect is open-ended, stating, “They like talking about this stuff, so we’ll see.”\n\t\n\n\tBirch may be getting the call back to Salem sooner than she thinks. Midler recently shared during an appearance on “Watch What Happens Live” that she read an early draft of the script and thought it was “brilliant.” \n\n\t“Well, you know, they sent a script, and a lot of it was brilliant,” she said. “So I got very excited, and now we’re trying to figure out what it is and where it’s going to be and how much it’s going to cost and all those logistical things.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGus Van Sant is still moving. \n\n\t“I think a lot of the films I’ve made, even unintentionally, have been based on real things,” Van Sant says with his familiar mix of understatement and curiosity. “That’s a genre, I guess. I’ve always been drawn to what makes people do what they do.”\n\n\tIn “Dead Man’s Wire,” Van Sant’s latest film, which premiered at AFI Film Festival on Saturday, that fascination becomes electrified — literally. The historical true-crime drama, based on the real-life 1977 Tony Kiritsis hostage case, unfolds like a pressure cooker between desperation and spectacle.\n\t\n\n\t“When I read the script,” he recalls, “there were links embedded in it — you could click them and hear the real 911 calls. Tony talked so fast, like Scorsese on a cocaine bender, cracking jokes and losing his temper. I thought, ‘This is an amazing character.’”\n\n\n\tVan Sant’s words carry a quiet thrill, the sound of an auteur who has spent a career balancing empathy and danger. From “Drugstore Cowboy” and “My Own Private Idaho” to the Oscar-nominated “Good Will Hunting” and “Milk,” he’s never chased a single genre; only human behavior.\n\n\t“The story had this weird barnstormer energy,” he shares. “We were meeting in the Soho House, and the producer said, ‘We have to start shooting in Louisville in two months.’ That was the most appealing thing — just hitting the road like Huckleberry Finn.”\n\n\tNow 73, Van Sant is nostalgic when talking about creative chaos. “The best thing about film is still the accident,” he says. “River Phoenix used to love when something unexpected happened on set. He’d come alive inside those moments — he could feel his character reacting in real time.”\n\t\n\n\tThat memory lingers, as does the one of the fog machines at the 1998 Oscars that made him physically ill while “Good Will Hunting” (1997) lost most of its awards to “Titanic.”\n\n\t“I’m allergic to stage fog now,” he says with a chuckle. “So I never use it on set.”\n\n\tIt’s been seven years since his last theatrical film (“Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot”), but Van Sant is back with a story that echoes his fascination with real American tragedy and absurdity — a director drawn, as ever, to the ragged edge between empathy and obsession.\n\n\tWith “Dead Man’s Wire,” Van Sant delivers his most arresting and charged work since “Milk.” The film hums with the restless energy that defined his early 1970s-like masterpieces while showcasing a sharpened maturity in tone and control. Skarsgård gives a career-best performance, grounding Tony Kiritsis’ volatility with flashes of humor and heartbreak, while Dacre Montgomery and Colman Domingo deliver richly textured performances. Dark horses for the Oscars? Of course. But that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be considered. In particular, Van Sant’s direction is at once intimate and explosive, framing the chaos with empathy, allowing the audience to feel the pulse of desperation behind every decision. The film’s screenplay, adapted from real events by first-time screenwriter Austin Kolodney, is infused with humanism and dark wit, standing as one of the year’s finest.\n\n\tIn a wide-ranging interview with Variety, Van Sant talks about his past, present and future in the industry he’s spent over four decades mastering.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Dead Man’s Wire”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStefania Rosini SMPSP\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLooking at your filmography, this fits with your interest in real-life characters and crimes.\t\n\n\tYeah, I think so. A lot of my films, even the fictional ones, are based on something from the real world — a news story or an article. “Drugstore Cowboy,” “Elephant,” and “Last Days” all came from that impulse. It’s not “true crime” like television, but it’s about what makes someone act a certain way — that question inside the crime.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you settle on Bill Skarsgård for Tony and Dacre Montgomery for Richard?\t\n\n\tCasting was probably as important as the script. I was at a spa one weekend, listening to ambient music, trying to decide if I should jump into this project immediately — we had to start shooting in November. I’d always wanted to work with Bill. I’d offered him roles before that didn’t happen. He has this fascinating career — horror films, yes, but he’s like Lon Chaney, the man of a thousand faces. He’s also 10 years younger than the real Tony, which made it interesting.\n\t\n\n\tDacre I knew because of his audition tape for “Stranger Things.” It’s one of those legendary tapes actors pass around — perfect lighting, perfect eyelines. I didn’t even watch the show at first, just his scenes. He felt new, unpredictable, and that was what the movie needed.\n\t\n\t\tAnd Colman Domingo as the radio DJ — it’s such an inspired choice.\t\n\n\tWe actually modeled that character after the DJ in “The Warriors.” That was in the script. We had a few actors pass before Colman came aboard. He was working with our producer, Cassian Elwes, on another project and said, “I’d love to work with Gus.” He was perfect — his presence grounds the film.\n\t\n\t\tFans always ask if you’d ever revisit “Drugstore Cowboy.”\t\n\n\tActually, there are screenplays that the same writer wrote — James Fogle. There were four different ones, and one of them is called “Satan’s Sandbox,” that I think James Franco wanted to do, but that was the one I kind of preferred. It’s set in San Quentin prison. And actually, when we met him and made the movie, he was in Walla Walla State Penitentiary in Washington State, and so he had some stories when they were out of prison, like “Drugstore Cowboy,” when they were running around, selling drugs and stealing drugs. So there are other ones, yeah, there are other ones that exist.\n\t\n\t\tRiver Phoenix was so prolific in your cinema journey. He definitely is one of the core reasons I, myself, fell in love with movies. How often does he cross your mind?\t\n\n\tI mean, I think about him all the time — there’s a picture on the wall of him. He was sort of like, you know, a very great collaborator. And we only did that one piece, and we were planning on — he was planning on being in what turned out to be “Milk.” But that didn’t happen till later, before he died, so there was a project that we were talking about. But, yeah, he was very spontaneous. He loved to improvise. That was his favorite thing. And I don’t think he got to, necessarily, depending on who he was working with, go off the page and improvise. It probably wasn’t the type of films that he was doing — he was doing traditional pieces that were pretty much, like, securely in Hollywood. You know, he was doing traditional pieces, that’s what he was offered.\n\t\n\n\tAnd in that environment, you’re not making a film like — you know, like you’re mentioning Scorsese — where they improvise whole scenes. And when we did, he found out that I liked it, you know, that I was okay if he just did something for like five minutes that wasn’t even in the screenplay, because then he could actually research stuff, and he could feel very open about what he was playing. So that was kind of magical, that he liked it, and he had not been able to do it. So he was very excited about it, because he wasn’t normally doing it.\n\n\tI don’t know, there’s lots of things. His upbringing was such that he didn’t really have a lot of film history connected to his memory banks. He was homeschooled, so he didn’t have a lot of teaching that he knew about concerning war. His homeschooling consisted of, like, no war. So characters like General MacArthur weren’t in his world — he didn’t know who they were. And then conversely, he didn’t know what humor was. He didn’t know what, like, a quote-unquote joke was, until he was nine, he said.\n\n\tHe found that out because he went to a traditional school — a public school — and kids were telling jokes. It was an era when kids were all about jokes. He didn’t know what they were; they were just like a foreign thing to him. He also didn’t have a smile, which people don’t necessarily know. He told me that — he said, ‘Well, I don’t have a smile.’ And I said, ‘You’re kidding.’ And then he smiled and showed me his smile, and I said, ‘Oh yeah, I don’t see that smile in your films.’\n\n\tSo he had this interesting thing — for a movie star, an interesting absence of that kind of giant smile. But meanwhile, he was very funny, and his most favorite thing was just to laugh and tell stories.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve been nominated twice for an Oscar. What do you remember about those mornings?\t\n\n\tMostly that I didn’t realize when the announcements were happening. I woke up to a bunch of phone calls. It’s the big Hollywood prize — it feels great. At the ceremony for “Good Will Hunting,” they unveiled this huge Titanic ship set, and fog rolled out everywhere. I got so sick sitting there, I swore I’d never use fog on my sets again.\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a lot of talk about the “death” of cinema. Do you believe that?\t\n\n\tNot at all. Movies always follow technology — from nickelodeons to iPhones. What matters is the gathering, that communal experience. The art form isn’t dying; it’s just shifting. The best films of the 1920s were miracles because nobody knew what cinema was yet. We’re in another one of those periods of discovery.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCan we expect another film soon? Or do we have to wait another seven years?\t\n\n\tI hope so. I did the Gucci project and six hours of “Feud,” so I haven’t been idle. There are hundreds of ideas — digital files full of them. Some might take decades, like “Milk” did. But they’re there, waiting.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKamala Harris gave her first exclusive UK interview on the BBC‘s “Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.” During the conversation with the titular host, she talked about the present and future states of American politics and her role within them.  The former Vice President and Presidential candidate says, “I am not done. I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it’s in my bones.”\n\n\tHarris, who served as a California Senator and District Attorney before becoming the 49th Vice President under Joe Biden from 2021 to 2025, has worked in politics for several decades. As the Democratic Party’s nominee for the 2024 Presidential election, she went toe-to-toe with Republican nominee Donald Trump, warning voters about his potential dangers throughout her campaign.\n\t\n\n\tThough Harris lost the election to Trump, she stands by her rhetoric. “I was asked if he was a fascist, and I said ‘yes,’ the reason is I look at what is happening right now,” Harris says, “It is what I predicted. He said he would weaponize the Department of Justice and he has done exactly that.”\n\n\n\tShe calls the U.S. President a “tyrant,” citing, “how he has weaponized, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists.” She also noted how the FCC went after Disney in the wake of Jimmy Kimmel’s remarks following Charlie Kirk’s assassination. “His skin is so thin, he couldn’t endure criticism from a joke, and attempted to shut down an entire media organization in the process,” she says.\n\n\tHarris was the U.S.’s first female Vice President and if elected, would have been the first female President. She says that her grandnieces would “in their lifetime for sure” see a female president. When asked if it would be her, she said, “possibly,” suggesting another potential run for the top office, though she has not officially committed to that decision.\n\t\n\n\tSome polls currently place Harris as an outside to win a place on the Democratic ticket in 2028. Harris brushes them off, though, stating, “I’ve never listened to polls. If I listened to polls, I would not have run for my first office, or my second office, and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here.”\n\n\tThe full interview will air on Sunday at 9 a.m. on the BBC.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJune Lockhart, a popular actress of the 1950s and ’60s known for her roles in “Lost In Space,” “Lassie” and “Meet Me in St. Louis,” died of natural causes on Oct. 23 in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 100.\n\n\tLockhart became known for her performances as Timmy’s foster mother, Ruth Martin, on the CBS series “Lassie” from 1958 to 1964. She took over from Cloris Leachman as the Martin family moved on to the famous collie’s farm and became foster parents to both the orphaned Timmy and Lassie.\n\t\n\n\tShe then starred as Dr. Maureen Robinson on the CBS series “Lost in Space” from 1965 to 1968. She played a brilliant biochemist and loving mother of three who is marooned in space along with her family. \n\n\n\t“When I wasn’t shooting Lassie, I became the mistress of Scrabble with my hairdresser and the crew,” she told Closer magazine in 2024. She also noted that “Lost in Space” was her favorite project. “It was so campy,” she said, “And I truly enjoyed my relationship with my space family.”\n\n\tOver nearly eight decades on screen, Lockhart went on to appear in dozens of series and movies well into her 80s, with recurring roles on “Petticoat Junction,” “General Hospital” “Beverly Hills 90210,” and guest appearances on shows from “The Beverly Hillbillies” to “Happy Days” to “Full House, “Roseanne” and “Gray’s Anatomy.”\n\n\tThe daughter of actor Gene Lockhart and actress Kathleen Lockhart, she was born in New York City in 1925. She made her feature film debut at 13 years old, starring alongside both of her parents in Edwin L. Marin’s 1939 “A Christmas Carol,” where she played Belinda Cratchit. After her breakout role, she appeared in films such as “All This, and Heaven Too,” “Meet Me in St. Louis,” “The Yearling,” and “Sergeant York.”\n\t\n\n\tPrior to the TV series, Lockhart appeared in the feature “Son of Lassie” as Priscilla, the Duke of Rudling’s granddaughter. In the 1950s, Lockhart guest-starred in several Western series such as “Wagon Train,” “Cimarron City,” “Gunsmoke,” “Have Gun – Will Travel,” and “Rawhide.” \n\n\tShe was nominated for two Emmys, including Best Actress in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Series for her performance in “Lassie.” She also received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for motion pictures and one for television. Lockhart was previously the recipient of a Special Tony Award for Outstanding Performance by a Newcomer for her role on Broadway in “For Love or Money” in 1948.\n\n\tA private service has been planned in her honor. Instead of sending flowers, Lockhart’s family suggests donating to The Actors Fund, ProPublica and International Hearing Dog, Inc. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSamuel Goldwyn Films has acquired U.S. distribution rights to the supernatural thriller “The Wolf and the Lamb” from Concourse Media, which will continue global sales at the European Film Market.\n\n\tDirected by Michael Schilf, “The Wolf and the Lamb” stars Cassandra Scerbo (“Sharknado”), Jaydon Clark (“9-1-1: Lone Star”), Eric Nelson (“1883”), Angus Macfadyen (“Braveheart”), Q’orianka Kilcher (“The New World”), Sammi Rotibi (“Django Unchained”), Adrianne Palicki (“John Wick”), Zach McGowan (“Black Sails”) and James Landry Hébert (“Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”).\n\t\n\n\tThe film follows Jo Beckett, a devoted schoolteacher whose life is upended when her young son mysteriously vanishes. Jo’s desperate search leads her through a maze of folklore, paranoia and faith. Facing hostility from neighbors, local authority figures and her own unraveling grip on reality, she must confront terrifying forces that challenge everything she believes.\n\n\n\tSamuel Goldwyn Films plans a 2026 theatrical and digital release.\n\n\t“’The Wolf and the Lamb’ is a singular genre experience — atmospheric, character-driven and the kind of story that rewards both horror aficionados and broader audiences,” said a spokesperson for Samuel Goldwyn Films. “We’re thrilled to bring this chilling journey to U.S. audiences and support Michael Schilf’s bold vision.”\n\n\tThe deal was negotiated by Matthew Shreder of Concourse Media with Miles Fineburg of Samuel Goldwyn Films.\n\n\tAlongside “The Wolf and the Lamb,” Concourse Media is presenting an EFM slate that includes the crime thriller “The Smack,” starring Casey Affleck, Sam Rockwell, Marisa Tomei and Kathy Bates, as well as the action-thriller “Hour of Reckoning,” led by Kiefer Sutherland.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCanadian sales and production outfit Double Dutch International has acquired Craig Fairbrass starrer “Villain 2” for its European Film Market slate, marking the return of the British actor as reformed gangster Eddie Franks.\n\n\tThe sequel finds Franks shot and left for dead shortly after his prison release, forcing him to battle back from near-fatal injuries while protecting his estranged daughter. As he navigates London’s resurgent criminal underworld, Franks must untangle a web of betrayal, family secrets and rival gang vendettas while uncovering the truth behind his ambush.\n\t\n\n\t“‘Villain’ is a franchise in the making,” said Ron Möring, president and CEO at Double Dutch International. “It’s a hard-hitting action film anchored by a magnetic lead performance, and we’re ready to bring the next chapter of Eddie Franks’ story to the international market.”\n\n\n\tNeil Linpow, whose credits include “Little Bone Lodge,” steps into the director’s chair, taking over from Philip Barantini, who helmed the 2020 original. Sharp House and Vertigo Films are producing in association with Impact Entertainment, with George Russo and Greg Hall returning to write the screenplay.\n\n\tJason Maza, Allan Niblo and Ian Sharp serve as producers, while Fairbrass also executive produces. The project is currently in pre-production.\n\n\t“I’m excited to be picking up the directing baton from Philip Barantini,” said Linpow. “I’ve always been drawn to stories that live in the shadows: morally compromised characters, consequences and survival. ‘Villain 2’ is about pushing Eddie to the edge and watching what happens when he fights his way back. It’s raw, it’s visceral, it’s bold – and it doesn’t look away.”\n\t\n\n\tJason Maza and Ian Sharp of Sharp House Entertainment said: “When Craig came to us with the idea of expanding the world of ‘Villain,’ we were immediately on board. We’re huge fans of the original and its creators, George and Greg. We’re excited to bring this sequel to existing fans and introduce Eddie Franks to a new global audience.”\n\n\tAllan Niblo of Vertigo Films added: “We are thrilled to be bringing ‘Villain 2’ to life. Working with Craig Fairbrass is a fantastic opportunity. This is a story about redemption, loyalty, and the lengths we’ll go to for family – and we’re excited to dive deeper into these themes with the intensity and grit audiences expect.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSND, the French production and distribution company, has signed a partnership with international sales agent Salaud Morisset for Jacques Deray’s 1969 cult classic “La Piscine” (The Swimming Pool), starring Alain Delon, Romy Schneider, Maurice Ronet and Jane Birkin.\n\n\tUnder the agreement, Salaud Morisset will represent theatrical, festival and non-commercial distribution rights in all territories where those rights remain available, boosting the film’s international distribution.\n\t\n\n\tThe partnership will support curated cinema programming, international festival exposure and cinematheque screenings, “ensuring that Deray’s masterpiece continues to resonate with contemporary audiences and new generations of cinephiles,” Salaud Morisset said.\n\n\n\tIn the film, Jean-Paul (Delon) and Marianne (Schneider) indulge in their passion for each other while borrowing a friend’s luxurious villa in the south of France. When the friend (Ronet) and his daughter (Birkin) arrive unexpectedly, rivalries and insecurities surface and events take a sinister turn.\n\n\tSalaud Morisset said: “It’s a real honor to be entrusted with a film as iconic and enduring as ‘La Piscine.’ Beyond its legendary cast and sun-drenched Riviera setting, the film speaks a universal language – desire, jealousy and power – themes that remain as sharp and contemporary today as they were in 1969. We’re thrilled to work with SND to bring this jewel of European cinema to new audiences in territories where theatrical and festival rights remain available, and to give it a renewed life through festivals, cinematheques and carefully curated theatrical screenings around the world.”\n\t\n\n\tSND is one of France’s top distributors, and has handled the releases of major titles such as “Twilight,” “Divergent,” “Iron Man,” “Now You See Me,” “La La Land” and “Conclave.” It also handles international sales of new films, with recent highlights including “Two Is a Family,” “Asterix: The Secret of the Magic Potion,” “The Jungle Bunch,” “What Happened to Monday” and “Yves Saint Laurent.”\n\n\tSalaud Morisset is an international sales and distribution company known for its strong portfolio of short films, including Jonathan Glazer’s “The Fall” and “Strasbourg 1518” and Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Nimic.” Its feature film slate includes Mahdi Fleifel’s narrative debut “To a Land Unknown” (Cannes Directors’ Fortnight), Ondřej Provazník’s “Broken Voices” (Karlovy Vary), and Marie-Elsa Sgualdo’s “Silent Rebellion” (Venice). In 2024, Salaud Morisset also struck a major deal with the Wim Wenders Foundation for a 25-film catalog including “Paris, Texas” and “Wings of Desire.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tShahrbanoo Sadat’s “No Good Men,” which opens the Berlin Film Festival, mixes romance, politics and humor in ways that Afghan cinema has never done before.\n\n\tIt’s the tale of a camerawoman at a Kabul TV station who — while struggling to retain custody of her 3-year-old son after leaving her unfaithful husband — becomes romantically entangled with the station’s star male journalist just before the 2021 fall of Kabul to the Taliban. The Afghan filmmaker’s previous two films, 2016’s ”Wolf and Sheep” and 2019’s ”The Orphanage,” both premiered at Cannes Directors’ Fortnight.\n\t\n\n\t“No Good Men” is lead-produced by Germany and Denmark’s Adomeit Film (“The Square”).\n\n\n\tSadat spoke to Variety about the film. \n\n\tYour previous films were dramas. What made you want to make a rom-com?\n\n\tI wanted to make a romantic comedy because I realized that the popular kind of films about Afghanistan are war dramas. And I didn’t want to make another another film like that. I come from Afghanistan, a country with no film industry. We are misrepresented in films made by international filmmakers. So for me, it was like: “How can I make an authentic film about a woman that I recognize?” I thought: “What if I make a rom com?” But the moment we started to finance it, I realized how uncomfortable the funds were in financing an Afghan rom-com because they just didn’t get it.\n\n\tTell me more about your struggle to make an Afghanistan-set rom-com.\n\n\tThis was at the time [2021] when I was evacuated from Afghanistan to Germany. There was this vibe of: “It’s just inappropriate for our institution to finance a rom-com while brave Afghan women are fighting in the streets against the Taliban.” And I was like: “I was one of them!” But I also wanted to talk about Afghan men. The good men. We know the that Afghan men are violent. But there is also another reality in Afghanistan. We have good men and bad men. But they never get a chance to be represented. So I thought: I’m going to make a film about women that is also a love letter to all the good men.\n\t\n\n\tThis film is being promoted as the first Afghan film featuring an onscreen kiss. But it’s probably also the first Afghan film also featuring a vibrator. What are your thoughts about that?\n\n\tProbably the first and the last one! Actually, I was not thinking anything. Because, returning from my travels I’ve brought sex toys as presents for my girlfriends who lived in Kabul. So for me, it’s just something that happens. My film is not an agenda film. I didn’t try to put it in there for some special reason. But it’s interesting, because Afghan society is very conservative. So whenever something is not allowed, the demand for it is even higher. \n\n\t“No Good Men” is obviously going to play for Western audiences. But did you also make it with Afghan viewers in mind? Do think they will be seeing it illegally?\n\n\tYou know, in my head, I am an Afghan director who is making films for Afghan people. This is always an issue between me and my producer, because my producer is like, “In the end it’s going to play in cinemas in Europe!” And I’m like: “Great, but that’s not the audience I had in mind when I was writing the movie!” When I was in Kabul, there were no movie theaters. So of course, I was watching them illegally on the internet. In the end I think this is the film that Afghan society desperately needs. That said, I’m not naive or optimistic that they’re going to receive it positively. In fact, I know that some are not, even though I made it from a really good good place in my heart. But in the worst case, it’s gong to start a conversation, an unpleasant one, but a necessary one.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n",

    "body": "\n\tU.K.-France sales outfit Alief has boarded world sales rights to “Lunar Sway,” the sophomore feature from Canadian writer-director Nick Butler.\n\n\tThe film stars Noah Parker (“In Cold Light,” “Who by Fire”) and Liza Weil (“How to Get Away With Murder,” “The Cleaning Lady”) in the story of Cliff, an unconventional young man navigating the search for connection. When his estranged birth mother Marg arrives unexpectedly, the two form a quick bond, but her hidden past and a vengeful pursuer threaten their newfound relationship.\n\t\n\n\tThe supporting cast includes Kaden Connors (“Heated Rivalry”), Grace Glowicki (“Dead Lover”) and Douglas Smith (“Horizon: An American Saga”).\n\n\n\tButler said the film explores outsiders existing on society’s margins. “This is a movie about misfits living on the fringe, and I hope that audiences will see themselves reflected in them and the universal theme of looking for love in all the wrong places,” he said. “Alief is the right partner to help us reach the audiences this film will connect with.”\n\n\tAlief partner Miguel Govea said the decision to board the project came easily. “At Alief, we want to work with filmmakers telling impactful stories, so we can help bring them to the forefront,” Govea said. “‘Lunar Sway’ is a story of people struggling to find a connection, and nothing brings people together like the communal experience of seeing a relatable story play out on the big screen.”\n\n\tAlief president Brett Walker added: “‘Lunar Sway’ is a fun ride. A tale of self-discovery, resilience, and the unexpected roads that lead us back to ourselves, anchored by the mesmerizing performances of leads Liza Weil and Noah Parker. We are delighted to be representing the film.”\n\t\n\n\tThe project is produced by Lucas Meeuse and Jennifer Wrede through Butler’s Cloudy Pictures Inc. Production took place in British Columbia’s Thompson-Nicola region with financial backing from Telefilm Canada and the Canada Council For The Arts.\n\n\tAlief is launching sales at Berlin’s European Film Market as the film seeks its world premiere. Butler’s debut feature “The Legacy of Cloudy Falls” received a theatrical and VOD release from Filmoption International in 2024.\n",

Filmed over seven years, the project tracks three community leaders in Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines as they draw from New York’s underground Ballroom culture to create spaces of empowerment for youth confronting transphobia, homophobia, HIV-stigma, sex work, colorism and poverty.\n\t\n\n\t“10s Across the Borders” premiered in the documentary program at the Busan International Film Festival after receiving the festival’s Asian Cinema Fund. The film earned a nomination for best documentary at the 2025 Asia Pacific Screen Awards and served as the gala screening for the awards ceremony.\n\n\n\t“I’m really looking forward to working with Rise and Shine, whose network and expertise with documentary will help ’10s Across the Borders’ to touch more audiences around the world,” Chan said.\n\n\tThe company has built a reputation for handling quality creative documentaries from emerging filmmakers with distinctive narratives. Its slate includes Christian Frei’s Swiss documentary “BLAME (Bats, Politics and a Planet Out of Balance)” and Weronika Mliczewska’s “Child of Dust,” a Poland-Vietnam-Sweden-Czech Republic-Qatar co-production.\n\n\tAurora Sun LaBeija, one of the film’s subjects and an associate producer on the project, noted the German ballroom community’s anticipation for the release. “I visit the German ballroom scene every year. Many friends are very excited and ask me how they can watch our film. I’m happy that they will get a chance to see it when ’10s Across the Borders’ screens across Germany,” she said.\n",

    "description": "\n\tEven before Saoirse-Monica Jackson turns up around the halfway point, it’s clear “How to Get to Heaven from Belfast” comes from the same sensibility",
    "body": "\n\tEven before Saoirse-Monica Jackson turns up around the halfway point, it’s clear “How to Get to Heaven from Belfast” comes from the same sensibility as “Derry Girls,” in which Jackson played anxious teenager Erin Quinn. Not only does the black comedy air on Netflix, where “Derry Girls” became a global sensation after initially airing on the UK’s Channel 4; “How to Get to Heaven from Belfast” — heretofore known as just “Belfast,” to reduce my risk of carpal tunnel — also centers on a tightly knit group of Northern Irish girlfriends prone to nervous babbling and rash decisions. But for creator Lisa McGee, here spending some of the capital rightfully acquired from three delightful seasons of “Derry Girls,” “Belfast” is a level up in scale and ambition. (“Belfast” was initially set up at Channel 4 as well, but moved to Netflix due in part to rising production costs.) Adding dual timelines, deadly intrigue and a doubled runtime to the “Derry Girls” blueprint, “Belfast” sometimes strains under the weight of all these extra elements, yet never loses the infectious appeal of the platonic chemistry at its core. \n\t\n\n\tLike McGee herself and the titular “Derry Girls” inspired by her upbringing, Saoirse (Roisin Gallagher), Robyn (Sinéad Keenan) and Dara (Caoilfhionn Dunne) are alumnae of an all-girls Catholic school that cemented their friendship. (Though the trio are slightly older than Erin and her peers, having attended secondary school in the aughts, post-Good Friday Agreement. The Troubles that formed the background of “Derry Girls” are a recent memory here, but a memory nonetheless.) But they graduated 20 years ago, and have now reached their late 30s in states of varying dissatisfaction. Saoirse is the London-based creator of a hit TV show — a seeming McGee surrogate, apart from the fact that Saoirse hates her schlocky crime drama “Murder Code” and the egocentric actress who leads it. Dara, a closeted lesbian, uses caring for her elderly mother as an excuse to never build a life of her own; Robyn is a wealthy housewife exhausted by her three rambunctious kids.\n\t\n\n\tThe missing fourth member of this quartet is Greta (Natasha O’Keeffe), who the other three lost touch with after one fateful night 20 years in the past. In the present, when Greta abruptly dies after what her family claims was a freak fall down the stairs, the news threatens to resurface secrets the group has long suppressed. Already on edge when they cross the border into rural County Donegal for Greta’s wake, the girls (this is Ireland, where even grown women nearing 40 are still “girls”) only get more freaked out as events unfold. They were invited by an email from Greta’s sister-in-law, but her widower Owen (Emmett J. Scanlan) doesn’t even have a sister. A friendly Englishman at the local watering hole is a dead ringer for Greta’s ex Jason (Josh Finan), whose unexplained disappearance two decades prior lies at the heart of what the group is hiding. Finally, Saoirse gets a glimpse inside the casket and comes away convinced the body isn’t Greta’s. The premiere’s final reveal confirms the writer isn’t just inventing another story.\n\n\tA group of Irish women under a high-stakes code of silence recalls Sharon Horgan’s excellent — in Season 1, at least — “Bad Sisters,” down to specific plot beats like an ill-advised flirtation between the engaged Saoirse and Liam (Darragh Hand), a local cop. (The protagonists are certainly close and quarrelsome enough to pass for siblings.) But McGee’s voice, even when distributed across a writers’ room in another shift from “Derry Girls,” is distinctive enough that “Belfast” exists outside the prior show’s shadow. The tensions among Robyn, Dara and Saoirse are especially well-drawn; the women call each other out for Robyn’s self-absorption, Dara’s cowardice and Saoirse’s unseemly appetite for excitement as only old friends can. The performances, too, are each revelations in their own right. Gallagher’s flustered charm, Keenan’s shameless hauteur and Dunne’s elastic face all keep the laughs coming, even as their characters are more jaded and downtrodden than the teens they once were.\n\n\tGreta, by design, remains more obscure. Some of this fuzziness is pointed: Ireland is the kind of place where someone is still known as “the transfer student” two years after they turn up at school, marking Greta (played in flashbacks by an ethereal Emma Canning) as an outsider even before she gets into trouble. But because “Belfast” spends so much less time with her, the late-breaking revelations about her past and its consequences don’t land with the same force as her peers’ more steadily constructed portraits. We understand so little about who Greta’s become in the present day that she never comes into focus as more than the target of the actual main characters’ projection. The finale includes a brief clip of a pre-disappearance Greta developing photos in a darkroom. She’s a photographer, a neat detail that goes unmentioned until it’s too late to explore what it says about her adult life.\n\t\n\n\tSaoirse and company quickly cross paths with a menacing fixer known as Booker (Bronagh Gallagher), who seems suspicious even before we see Greta tied up in her trunk. By season’s end, we’re being filled in on a nesting doll of intrigue: who Booker works for, who the body is it if isn’t Greta’s, what happened to Greta in the 2020s, what happened between Greta and Jason in the 2000s, what happened to Greta as a small child in the 1990s that led her to Our Lady of the Sorrows Cottage, and what all of this has to do with a creepy symbol all four got tattooed on their bodies at Greta’s insistence. It’s a lot to keep track of, and to be honest, I wasn’t half as hooked by any of it as I was by simply watching the actors bounce off one another. When the final shot telegraphed hopes for a Season 2, it’s them I was looking forward to seeing more of, rather than a resolution to a cliffhanger — the takeaway being that I am looking forward to more. \n\n\t“Belfast” builds to a resolution that leans a little too heavily on the now well-worn conventions of the trauma plot. However trope-laden the payoff may be, it’s countered by the specificity and sense of place McGee builds on both sides of the line dividing Ireland in two. Critical scenes hinge on the use and meaning of the Irish language, Catholicism suffuses everything, and the long hangovers of the Troubles and abortion bans are still in effect, even if the original causes are not. “Derry Girls” mined comic gold from the ordinary lives led amid geopolitical turmoil; “Belfast” carries that tradition forward into its aftermath, tinged with the hindsight and regrets of adulthood.\n\n\tAll eight episodes of “How to Get to Heaven from Belfast” are now streaming on Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\t If Cannes’ Annecy Animation Showcase is now an established appetizer for June’s Annecy Festival, this first EFM Animation Days lineup is nothing short of a hearty breakfast. Beyond the five projects listed in Annecy’s Friday presentation, a carefully curated selection completes a solid slate of 28 presentations. Producers will have the opportunity to present projects at different stages of development and financing, but all have something of note and are worth discovering. \n\t\n\n\tRanging from small independent producers to well established animation powerhouses, all teams will use Berlinale as a global platform to prove once again the medium’s potential, and its strong market appeal. \n\n\n\tOur 10 picks underscore the diversity of what the animation industry is capable of in these shifting landscapes: Pushing forward unique creative visions and bold artistic choices. \n\n\tAnnecy EFM Animation Showcase \n\n\tThis year’s five titles range from historical drama to folk horror and sci-fi eco-conscious adventure, carefully selected by Annecy’s teams. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA Door to the Woods\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“A Door to the Woods,” Jola Kudela (Poland, France, Czech Republic, Belgium)\n\n\tInspired by real people and true historical events, this new animated feature tells the tale of two young Poles (Antek, hiding in Breslau and Wiktor surviving a gulag) reunited decades after their separation through Jola, Antek’s granddaughter, whose creative future Wiktor helps unlock. A voyage through the history of three oppressive regimes that tore Europe apart during the last century: Fascism, Stalinism, and Communism.\n\t\n\n\tProducers: Opus Film, Les Films Du Poisson Rouge, PFX\n\n\tGenre: Historical Drama\n\n\tArtistic technique: 2D, 3D, rotoscope\n\n\tCompletion: 2028\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGranny is a Tree!\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Granny is a Tree!” Hugo de Faucompret (France, Luxembourg)\n\n\tGranny Onion, Jane’s whimsical grand-mother, takes one last eternal after-lunch nap. Against her mother’s decision, Jane takes it upon herself to fulfil her granny’s last wish: Granny Onion’s will states that she choses natural organic reduction for her funeral. In short, she wants to be “humused”! Cécile, Jane’s mom, is against it. Besides, it’s not even legal in France!  But Jane is determined. And with her granny’s facetious ghost, she’ll set off on a wild escape to the edge of the tangible world.\n\n\tProducers: Laïdak Films, Dandelooo, Doghouse\n\n\tGenre: Comedy, Adventure, Modern tale\n\n\tArtistic technique: 2D, hand-painted backgrounds\n\n\tCompletion: 2028\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMouMoush – The King of Plastic\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“MouMoush – The King of Plastic” Milorad Krstic (Hungary)\n\n\tWhile vacationing in Transylvania, two curious siblings (10 year-old Margot and 14-year-old Liam) from Paris are thrust into a time-traveling adventure. Their mission? To thwart MouMoush, a powerful figure known as the King of Plastic who is plotting to seize control of the entire world. From the team behind “Ruben Brandt”comes this awaited feature blending fantasy, time travel and environmental themes together, along with the directors’ unique humor.\n\n\tProducer: Mumus Production LLC\n\n\tGenre: Fantasy, Adventure\n\n\tArtistic technique: 2D, 3D\n\n\tCompletion: 2028\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPesta\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Pesta” Hanne Berkaak (Norway, Germany, France)\n\n\tAs the horrors of the Black Death fuel fear and superstition, Catholic noble girl Astrid experiences the bliss of first love with Ilkka, a heathen outcast. When Ilkka is accused of witchcraft by a system based on lies, telling the truth becomes the most dangerous act of all. Set in Norway in 1349, “Pesta” is a romantic horror folk tale that will blur the lines between reality and fantasy to craft a compelling story of love beyond societal norms. A title that promises chilling journey into the dark side of Nordic folklore.\n\n\tProducers: Mikrofilm, Knudsen Pictures, Rosalie Films and Charades\n\t\n\n\tGenre: Romantic Horror\n\n\tArtistic technique: 2D\n\n\tCompletion: 2029\n\n\t“Zako” Tigran Arakelyan (Armenia, France, Lithuania)\n\n\tOtherwise known as Sargis Mangasaryan, the Armenian painter Zako (a name he was given by the Germans) survived Nazi’s POW camps only by drawing portraits of his tormentors. In 1956, he discovered with shock one of Picasso’s iconic masterpieces: “Guernica” and realized how much of his own talent was stifled by both Nazi Germany and later the communism of Armenia’s Soviet Era. According to Arakelyan, who adapts the graphic novel “Zako”with this feature, the filmwill use modern VR technology combined with classical CG tools to create a new visual language, the makers say, fit to adapt this story to the screen.\n\n\tProducers: OnOff Studio, Sacrebleu Productions, Broom Films\n\n\tGenre: Historical Drama\n\n\tArtistic technique: 3D\n\n\tCompletion: 2028\n\n\tSpotlights\n\n\tBeyond this lineup, Spotlights from Canada, Germany, U.K. and CEE and an International Animation Showcase complete this packed slate. Here are five projects at (very) early stages that piqued our curiosity. \n\n\t“Fifteen Dogs” Chris Landreth (Canada)\n\n\tBased on André Alexis’s Giller Prize-winning novel, “Fifteen Dogs” marks the latest project from Copperheart Ent. (“Night of the Zoopocalypse”). What begins with a wager between Greek gods who grant a group of Toronto dogs human intelligence turns into quick-paced animated drama, where these newly smart pets navigate shifting loyalties, new language, and emerging identities. \n\n\tProducers: Copperheart Entertainment (Steven Hoban, Mark Smith)\n\n\tGenre: Drama (teens and adults)\n\n\t“Acorn’s Adventure” Filip Mašek (Czech Republic, Germany)\n\n\tPitched last year as part of Annecy’s MIFA Features presentation, “Acorn’s Adventure” puts animation in the hands of children, with visionary director Filip Mašek at the wheel. The film is a beautiful CG project filled with quirky forest characters designed by the daring imaginations of nature-loving children. Quido, a boy made of acorns, will try to find its purpose in a forest village where every tiny character seems to already have a definite role. An animated adventure with a catchy and child-friendly log(line): be yourself, even if you don’t know what that is yet.\n\t\n\n\tProducers: Pure Shore, Fabian & Fred\n\n\tGenre: Family-friendly Adventure \n\n\t“The Pirate King” (Netherlands/Taiwan)\n\n\tPresented by Alex Dowding, Submarine’s animation producer on the project, “The Pirate King,” a 3D animated fantasy adventure, is currently in development as a rather unique Netherlands-Taiwanese co-production. A story of unlikely friendship, myth, and adventure, blended in a project that reflects Submarine’s passion for globally collaborative storytelling.\n\n\tProducers: Submarine, Studio2 Animation Lab\n\n\tGenre: Fantasy, Adventure\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTreasure Island\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Treasure Island” (Germany)\n\n\tWhat if the hero of Stevenson’s beloved classic was a girl… and a cat? In this new animated musical, Jane Hawkins is fed up with the boring life of her cat boarding school. Could that ship setting off on a treacherous treasure hunt to a remote island be the key to her freedom? \n\n\tAnimated in lush CG animation, this new take on the pirate classic story with an animal twist could conquer the hearts of global audiences. \n\n\tProducers: Little Dream Entertainment\n\n\tGenre: Family Entertainment, Musical\n\n\t“Reds & Grays” (U.K.)\n\n\tPowered by Two Daughters Entertainment (“Master Moley”, “The Land of Sometimes”), “Reds & Grays” is an original story rooted deep in the real-life ecological conflict between red and grey squirrels. In a distinct British setting, this adventure blends romance, rebellion and political intrigue in what seems like a funny and fluffy Romeo and Juliet inspired story, with universal themes.\n\n\tProducers: Two Daughters Entertainment\n\n\tGenre: Family Entertainment\n",

    "body": "\n\tCPH:DOX, also known as Copenhagen Intl. Documentary Film Festival, has unveiled its competition lineup, featuring 53 world premieres, 17 international premieres and four European premieres. The 23rd edition of the festival runs March 11-22.\n\n\tNiklas Engstrøm, artistic director of CPH:DOX, said: “We are living through a period in which the frameworks that once felt stable – political, moral, even cognitive – are shifting beneath our feet. Institutions are tested, conflicts intensify, and new technologies challenge our understanding of perception and agency. In such a moment, documentary cinema becomes more than observation; it becomes a space for sustained attention. The films in this year’s competition lineup resist simplification and speed. They insist on complexity, on ambiguity, and on the dignity of lived experience.”\n\t\n\n\tThe flagship competition section is the DOX:AWARD, which comes with a €10,000 prize. It consists of 12 feature films, all of them world premieres. The five remaining competitions – each with a €5,000 prize – target distinct cinematic focuses. The F:ACT Competition bridges filmmaking and investigative journalism; the HUMAN:RIGHTS Competition highlights stories in defense of human rights; NEW:VISION celebrates artists’ films and boundary-pushing cinematic experiments; NEXT:WAVE spotlights emerging filmmakers and new cinematic currents; and NORDIC:DOX showcases the best regional documentaries from the Nordics.\n\n\n\tThe 2026 edition welcomes a new mark of distinction with the introduction of the FIPRESCI Award, presented by the International Federation of Film Critics, for which the 12 films in the DOX:AWARD Competition are nominated. CPH:DOX also presents a selection of the films nominated for the 2026 Doc Alliance Award, in collaboration with the seven European festivals in the Doc Alliance network.\n\t\n\n\tMads K. Mikkelsen, head of program of CPH:DOX, said: “Documentary is an art form, and we are immensely excited to present a competition lineup of highly contemporary films that critically and creatively reflect the troubled times we live in. The selection explores the possibilities of 21st century cinema in a spirit of humanism, solidarity and. poetry, with great trust in their audience. We are deeply grateful to all the filmmakers and look forward to celebrating with them, and to seeing their films light up the screens.”\n\n\tCPH:DOX welcomes more than 150,000 attendees and over 2,000 industry professionals each year.\n\n\tThe nominees (in alphabetical order) are:\n\n\tDOX:AWARDA Song Without Home(Director: Rati Tsiteladze, Producer: Rati Tsiteladze, Olga Slusareva, Georgia, United States, World Premiere)Amazomania(Director: Nathan Grossman, Producer: Cecilia Nessen, Sweden, Denmark, France, World Premiere)Arctic Link(Director: Ian Purnell, Producer: Franziska Sonder, Switzerland, World Premiere)Christiania(Director: Karl Friis Forchhammer, Producer: Rikke Tambo, Denmark, World Premiere)Daughters of the Forest: Mycelium Chronicles(Director: Otilia Portillo, Producer: Paula Arroio, Elena Fortes, Mexico, United States, World Premiere)Little Sinner(Director: Daro Hansen, Thomas Papapetros, Producer: Thor Hampus Bank, Denmark, World Premiere)MARIINKA(Director: Pieter-Jan De Pue, Producer: Bart Van Langendonck, Belgium, World Premiere)Petrolheads(Director: Emil Langballe, Producer: Julie Walenciak, Claes Hedlund, Denmark, World Premiere)Something Familiar(Director: Rachel Taparjan, Producer: Monica Lăzurean-Gorgan, Elena Martin, Romania, United Kingdom, World Premiere)The Cord(Director: Nolwenn Hervé, Producer: Estelle Robin You, France, World Premiere)The Sandbox(Director: Kenya-Jade Pinto, Producer: Shasha Nakhai, Kenya-Jade Pinto, Canada, World Premiere)Whispers in May(Director: Dongnan Chen, Producer: Jia Zhao, China, Netherlands, Republic of Korea (South Korea), Sweden, World Premiere)\n\n\tF:ACT AWARDAll Rivers Spill Their Stories to the Sea(Director: Jeanie Finlay, Producer: Charlie Phillips, Jeanie Finlay, United Kingdom, World Premiere)Atlas of Disappearance(Director: Manuel Correa, Producer: Anna Giralt Gris, Jorge Caballero Ramos, Emil Olsen, Spain, World Premiere)Cambodian Beer Dreams(Director: Laurits Nansen, Producer: Malene Flindt Pedersen, Signe Skov Thomsen, Ove Rishøj Jensen, Valérie Montmartin, Denmark, Sweden, France, World Premiere)Hell’s Army(Director: Richard Rowley, Producer: Atanas Georgiev, Richard Butler, Ukraine, Syria, Central African Republic, Lithuania, United States, World Premiere)In Full Agreement(Director: Panu Suuronen, Producer: Susanna Lasarov, Finland, International Premiere)Intelligence Rising(Director: Elena Andreicheva, Producer: Elena Andreicheva, Sean Richard, Mandy Chang, United Kingdom, World Premiere)Just Look Up(Director: Emma Wall, Betsy Hershey, Producer: Signe Byrge Sørensen, Natja Rosner, United States, Denmark, World Premiere)Kikuyu Land(Director: Andrew H.

    "body": "\n\tAmazon MGM Studios are adapting the first instalment of Mercedes Ron’s “Bali” series for screen.\n\n\t“30 Sunsets para enamorarte” (“Thirty Sunsets to Fall in Love”) centers around Bali-based Nikki, a veterinarian who teaches yoga in her spare time. One day pilot Alex lands on her island in a bid to flee the London rat-race and Nikki soon finds herself head over heels. But with only 30 days to spend together, it’s not so clear whether Nikki or Alex is ready to commit — especially when both are hiding something.\n\t\n\n\tThe project will be the first U.S. adaptation of a novel from the best-selling Argentinian-Spanish author.\n\n\n\tRon has been a reliable source of inspiration for Prime Video, who have adapted 10 of her books so far, seven in Spanish and three in English (out of the U.K.) These include the “Culpables” trilogy (“My Fault,” “Your Fault” and “Our Fault: London”) as well as the twin “Enfrentados” novels.\n\n\tThe prolific author’s books have sold millions of copies worldwide and been translated in 26 languages across 50 countries. Prime Video sees 32-year-old Ron as “pivotal” to building out its content for younger audiences as well as developing franchises in both the U.S. and internationally, ranging from “The Summer I Turned Pretty” and Germany’s “Maxton Hall.”\n\n\t“The Culpables” franchise, about a headstrong girl whose life is turned upside down when her mother moves the family into her wealthy boyfriend’s mansion, has become Prime Video’s most-watched international original globally, reaching number one at launch in over 170 countries with 90% of streams coming outside Spain. “Culpables” content is also huge on TikTok, where its generated over 2.7 billion views. The trailer for “Culpa Nuestra” was viewed 327 million times across social platforms.\n\t\n\n\t“Culpa Mía,” which was directed by Domingo Gonzalez, debuted in 2023 with Nicole Wallace as Noah and Gabriel Guevara as Nick. The U.K. adaptation, “My Fault,” followed two years later directed by Dani Girdwood and Charlotte Fassler. It starred Asha Banks and Matthew Broome in the lead roles.\n",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          Multiple sources familiar with the situation tell TMZ ... production for the Netflix hit series is gauging Christine's interest in a possible return for Season 10, asking whether she'd consider coming back.\n      \n    \n          We're told premature conversations have taken place and are ongoing ... but nothing is official, and no contracts have been signed.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Christine starred on the show from Seasons 1 through 5 and quickly became one of its most polarizing personalities, known for her over-the-top fashion, sharp tongue, and explosive feuds with Chrishell Stause, Mary Fitzgerald, Heather Rae El Moussa, and Emma Hernan.\n      \n    \n          Her 2022 exit followed a turbulent fifth season marked by accusations of dishonesty, fractured friendships, and mounting behind-the-scenes tension. Christine denied wrongdoing and pushed back on how she was portrayed, claiming certain storylines were exaggerated or manufactured.\n      \n    \n          Her relationship with executive producer Adam DiVello became increasingly strained, with Christine accusing production of unfair treatment and narrative manipulation. She ultimately left both the series and The Oppenheim Group, skipping the Season 5 reunion.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          Since then, Christine has written a memoir, launched new ventures, and gone through a highly publicized divorce.\n      \n    \n          Now, as Season 10 gears up, producers appear at least open to seeing if the former villain would walk back through the Oppenheim doors.\n      \n    \n          We've reached out to reps for Christine and Netflix ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Christine Quinn\n              \n                          \n                Chrishell Stause\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Selling Sunset\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

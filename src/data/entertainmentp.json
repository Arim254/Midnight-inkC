    "body": "\n\tThere are so many movie moments and images and expressions that stay with you long after you leave the theater. That’s certainly true of 2025, where we’re unlikely to forget the characters and scenes that left a lasting impression. We rounded up our favorites from some of the year’s best pic- ture contenders — obviously, spoilers follow!Frankenstein“A leaf? For me?”In one of the most touching moments in Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein,” Mia Goth’s Elizabeth is given a leaf by the Creature (Jacob Elordi). Until now, Victor (Oscar Issac) has treated his creation like nothing but a monster, keeping him chained in the tunnels of his laboratory. When Elizabeth wanders down below and sees the Creature, the two are mesmerized by one another. On her second visit, he gives her an autumnal leaf. She responds, “A leaf? For me?” She meets him with love, warmth, tenderness and acceptance for the first time in his new life. It’s a moment of compassion between the two. Elizabeth takes it and tries to teach him her name. The gentle exchange is a subtle moment about kindness and connection, but it underlines the film’s theme of who is really the monster? — Jazz TangcayIt Was Just an AccidentA final confirmationJafar Panahi builds his film with layers of characters — we learn the horrific stories of former jailed “dissidents” Vahid, Shiva, Goli and Hamid in an escalating chain of horror. The movie kicks off with Vahid (Vahid Mobasseri) kidnapping their presumed jailer, Eqbal (Ebrahim Azizi), who has a prosthetic leg that makes a distinctive sound when he walks. Vahid collects the group of jailed survivors along the way, hoping to confirm Eqbal’s identity beyond a shadow of doubt. Is he their jailer? Eqbal certainly seems to confirm it in the film’s powerhouse finale — despite being blindfolded and tied to a tree, he remains imperious, condescending and confident as Shiva and Vahid visit their primal, verbal rage upon him. The camera doesn’t move from our eye-level POV, and his attitude is a giveaway that he is part of the regime that is seemingly useless to fight against. — Carole HorstHamnet“Hamlet” takes the stageChloé Zhao’s “Hamnet” almost had a different ending. In the film, Agnes (Jessie Buckley) and Will (Paul Mescal) are grieving the death of their young son Hamnet. While the tragedy inspires Shakespeare to finish “Hamlet,” Zhao and Buckley felt that even after they shot the scripted ending, there was no real closure. Buckley sent Zhao composer Max Richter’s “This Bitter Earth,” and while listening to it, Zhao put her hand out and touched rain. It unlocked a feeling in her that ultimately inspired her to change the film’s ending: Agnes watching “Hamlet” at the Globe Theater and, as he dies, she reaches out her hand to touch him. It’s a huge moment in the film for Agnes, who has been grappling with grief and loss. It’s a moment of collective grief as the Globe’s audience follows her lead and reaches out their hands. Not only is there closure, but there’s a catharsis for both Agnes and the film’s audience. — JT\n\n\tKPop Demon HuntersThe Saja Boys appearThe appeal of Korean pop music keeps the demon realm at bay in Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans’ record-breaking Netflix hit. But not even the Huntr/x trio can resist the Saja Boys’ charms. The rival band’s onscreen introduction proves one of the film’s most satisfying moments, as K-drama stylistic tricks (soft lighting and frame-rate speed ramps) meld with anime logic: Time slows as Zoey and Mira see the guys, their eyes turning into Tex Avery-esque hearts. Then Zoey notices Abby’s abs, and the hearts morph into flesh-colored six-packs, which become bright yellow corncobs, before erupting into streams of popcorn tears. — Peter Debruge\n\t\n\n\tMarty SupremeOne last gameJosh Safdie’s wild ride through the life of a table tennis prodigy (Timothée Chalamet) is made up of so many memorable moments — from a runaway bathtub to a literal and figurative spanking — it’s hard to single one out. But it’s the epic showdown between Marty and his Japanese rival Koto Endo (Koto Kawaguchi), which serves as the film’s climax and catharsis. After agreeing to lose to Endo, the brash and arrogant Marty demands a real rematch, even though it will cost him dearly — money, relationships and even his ride home all disappear. But Marty, always one to follow his own path, can’t help but give it his all. His victory is a bittersweet moment, as the crowd is disappointed and his future is uncertain, but it’s absolutely true to the character. And in a rare moment of humility and sincerity, Marty embraces and praises his opponent and wishes him well at the world championships. “I hope you win,” he tells Endo as he shakes his hand. —Jenelle Riley\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMax-o-matic for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOne Battle After AnotherSensei’s time to shinePaul Thomas Anderson’s beloved epic is packed full of colorful characters, great lines and unforgettable scenes. But it’s Benecio Del Toro’s mystical karate teacher “Sensei” Sergio St. Carlos who might deliver the biggest surprise. At first glance, you might mistake the calm and wise Sensei to be lackadaisical, but as soon as his student Willa (Chase Infiniti) goes missing, he’s the first person her father Bob (Leonardo DiCaprio) contacts. We soon learn Sergio is not only a fearless fighter, but also running “a little Latino Harriet Tubman situation” — helping undocumented immigrants escape law enforcement. In a bravura sequence, he even takes time to spring Bob from arrest, providing beer and insisting they take a selfie, before hitting the road. When the cops pursue, Sergio pushes Bob from the car. The next time he seems to be cooperating politely with the cops — but when they tell him to lift his shirt, turn around, and put his hands on top of his head, he does so with a stylized little dance that is his own form of resistance. — Jenelle Riley\n\n\tSentimental ValueAn actress departsFor all the family dynamics at play in Joachim Trier’s story of a film director and his two daughters, there’s a moment with an outsider that speaks volumes to their dynamic. Gustav (Stellan Skarsgård) has hired movie star Rachel Kemp (Elle Fanning) to play a role in his auto-biographical film that was intended for his estranged daughter Nora (Renate Reinsve). The only American on the film (played by the only American in the film), Rachel soon senses something is off. In a quiet moment, seated across from Gustav in the family home, she says out loud what everyone knows: She’s not right for the role. Even though she wants it — she’s already dyed her hair brown and prepared meticulously — she painfully offers to withdraw from the film. Her selfless choice opens the door not only for the right movie to be made, but for a family to heal. — JR\n\n\tSinnersPiercing the veilWhat do the vampires want when they descend upon the opening-night festivities of Smoke and Stack’s juke joint? More than blood. If successful, they’ll suck the culture and charisma from their victims as well. As Preacher Boy performs, we observe the generations-spanning power of Black music — but especially the blues — via a roof-raising, unbroken tour through the crowd. The greatest musicians conjure spirits from the past, director Ryan Coogler explains, connecting DJs and breakdancers with rhythmic tribal rituals in a dynamic traveling shot that intuitively demonstrates what’s at stake for the film’s supernatural second half: the coopting of this tradition. — PD\n\t\n\n\tSirâtAn unexpected minefieldAfter caravaning across the desert and up a treach- erous mountain where death swoops in quite unexpectedly, a motley group of ravers — plus grieving father Luis (Sergi López) — find themselves in the middle of what looks like a dry lakebed in Olivier Laxe’s immersive, unpredictable art film. Is this the real world or an apocalyptic allegory of some kind? Nothing that’s happened so far quite prepares viewers for what’s to come (spoiler alert), as the wide open expanse turns out to be a literal minefield. In the shocking white-knuckle sequence that follows, characters we’ve grown attached to can be instantly vaporized. — PD\n\n\tSong Sung BlueClaire faces her demonsHugh Jackman and Kate Hudson singing the glorious songs of Neil Diamond? Count me in! And while their glitter-powered moments onstage count as highlights in this true-life story, it’s a rather quiet scene that packs a punch. Mike (Jackman) and Claire (Hudson) have both been through a lot already: poverty, divorce, addiction. But they are a joyful pair, who find hope in music. Their rise as successful Diamond-interpretation duo Lightning & Thunder gets cut short with an accident in which Claire loses her leg. She understandably sinks into a long depression and pills until a moment where Mike and her kids force her to get help. In an intimate scene at the rehab center, Claire confronts her depression. Hudson’s raw vulnerability becomes strength. Claire begins to heal. — CH\n\n\tTrain DreamsAppreciation for ArnWilliam H. Macy is onscreen for just a few minutes, but he carries the weight of “Train Dreams” in his brief time. Arn Peeples at first comes off like a dang fool: talking up how he did things in the old days, avoiding work in the logging camp, singing when others are trying to sleep, unable to perform his actual job with explosives. But Robert (Joel Edgerton) understands his value. Arn’s nuggets of wisdom become the soul of the film: “We just cut down trees that have been here for 500 years. It upsets a man’s soul whether he recognizes it or not,” Arn says one night around the campfire, adding that while we dash about building and destroying in the name of progress, “we’re but children on this Earth, pulling bolts out of the Ferris wheel, thinking ourselves to be gods.” — CHWicked: For GoodThe good-byeThe musical number “For Good” was always going to be an emotional moment between Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba and Ariana Grande’s Glinda.It’s that final moment where Elphaba has to meet her fate as the Wicked Witch of the West, but not before the duo sing about how their friendship has changed them for the better. Director Jon M. Chu let the cameras roll as Erivo and Grande sang the song and ad-libbed their lines. Elphaba tells her, “Everything’s going to be fine” and they exchange “I love yous.” That unscripted declaration was a heartfelt and gut-wrenching final goodbye that Chu kept in as one last emotional punch to bring “Wicked” to anend.—JT\n\n\tZootopia 2The reptile deceptionAfter some new character- and world-building and some red herrings (not literal fish, mind you), it’s revealed that the grandmother of Gary De’Snake (Ke Huy Quan) is the engineering genius behind what makes Zootopia work — the different climate zones for all the animals that live there. This is huge because reptiles have been cast out of Zootopia and their reputation subsequently destroyed by mammal-led propaganda, which also led to the destruction of the snakes’ homes. To find out that it was a snake, and a female one at that, who is behind this animal paradise is a revelation. Gary’s cause in restoring his species’ environment and reputation while exposing the evil intentions of the rich and powerful Lynxley family (they, of course, prefer the cold) becomes urgent, and protagonists, the fox Nick (Jason Bateman) and the rabbit Judy (Ginnifer Goodwin) overcome their differences and work together in the fight for what’s right. — CH\n",

    "body": "\n\t“RJ Decker,” a new series starring Scott Speedman, will premiere March 3 at 10 p.m. on ABC. The show joins the network’s Tuesday night lineup, which includes “Will Trent” and “High Potential.” All shows will be available to stream the next day on Hulu.  \n\n\tWith the premiere of this series, Season 8 of “The Rookie” will shift timeslots to Mondays at 10 p.m. starting Jan. 26.\n\n\n\tWritten by Rob Doherty, the series follows RJ Decker (Speedman), an ex-con and disgraced newspaper photographer who restarts his life in South Florida’s colorful, crime-filled world as a private investigator. Over the course of the show, he’ll tackle a range of cases with the help of “his journalist ex, her police detective wife and a shadowy new benefactor — a woman from his past who could be his greatest ally … or his one-way ticket back to prison,” the official logline reads. \n\t\n\n\tIn addition to Speedman, the cast includes Jaina Lee Ortiz as Emilia “Emi” Ochoa, Bevin Bru as Detective Melody “Mel” Abreau, Kevin Rankin as Aloysius “Wish” Aiken and Adelaide Clemens as Catherine Delacroix. \n\n\tBased on Carl Hiaasen’s novel “Double Whammy,” Carl Hiaasen, Carl Beverly and Sarah Timberman serve as executive producers, as does Doherty and the show’s director Paul McGuigan. 20th Television produced the show. Speedman also serves as a producer. \n\t\n\t\tPROGRAMMING\t\n\n\tThe CW is hitting the road with “The Great American Road Rally: Celebrity Edition,” a new prime-time event series hosted by Ian Ziering. The series premieres Wednesday, May 13 at 9 p.m. ET/PT and will air weekly, ending with a live two-hour finale on July 22 at 8–10 p.m. ET/PT.\n\t\n\n\tTimed to coincide with major national milestones in 2026 — including America’s 250th anniversary and the 100th anniversary of Route 66 — the series follows 10 celebrity-driven vehicles traveling cross-country along the iconic highway. Each team is aligned with a charitable cause, combining competition with community engagement and fundraising. Ziering, a longtime car enthusiast and philanthropist, will guide viewers through the journey, spotlighting local stories and causes along the way.\n\n\tProduced by 7 Bridges Media Group, the series is positioned as a limited-run national event rather than a traditional competition show, with additional details on celebrity participants, community activations and fan engagement to be announced in the coming weeks.\n\t\n\t\tAWARDS\t\n\n\tJudge Judy Sheindlin will receive the Edward F. McLaughlin Lifetime Achievement Award from the Broadcasters Foundation of America at its annual gala on March 9 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. The honor recognizes Sheindlin’s decades-long impact on broadcasting, following her transition from presiding in New York City Family Court to creating the hit courtroom series “Judge Judy,” which topped all of syndication for much of its historic 25-year run.\n\n\tA four-time Emmy winner, including a Lifetime Achievement Award, Sheindlin has since expanded her courtroom empire with Amazon’s two-time Emmy-winning “Judy Justice,” along with “Justice on Trial” and “Tribunal Justice,” and CBS’ long-running “Hot Bench,” now in its 12th season. She is also set to executive produce “Adam’s Law” for CBS in 2026.\n\n\t“Judy’s no-nonsense approach to legal disputes has provided riveting television entertainment to millions of viewers,” said BFOA president Tim McCarthy. Sheindlin has previously been honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and inducted into the Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame.\n",

    "description": "\n\tMatthew McConaughey’s lawyers want you to know that using AI to replicate the actor’s famous catchphrase is not “alright, alright, alright.”\n\n\tAttor",
    "body": "\n\tMatthew McConaughey’s lawyers want you to know that using AI to replicate the actor’s famous catchphrase is not “alright, alright, alright.”\n\n\tAttorneys for entertainment law firm Yorn Levine representing McConaughey have secured eight trademarks from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office over the last several months for their client, which they said is aimed at protecting his voice and likeness from unauthorized AI misuse. \n\n\n\tThose include a sound mark on audio of McConaughey saying, “Alright, alright, alright!” — his memorable line from the 1993 comedy film “Dazed and Confused,” which is closely associated with the actor. Other trademarks include a 7-second video clip of him standing on a porch; a 3-second clip of him sitting in front of a Christmas tree; and audio of him saying “Just keep livin’, right?” followed by a pause, then “I mean,” followed by another pause, and ending with “What are are we gonna do?”\n\t\n\n\tPer the trademark registration for the “Alright, alright, alright” sound mark: “The mark consists of a man saying ‘ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT’, wherein the first syllable of the first two words is at a lower pitch than the second syllable, and the first syllable of the last word is at a higher pitch than the second syllable.” The actor’s lawyers applied for trademark protection on “alright, alright, alright” in December 2023 and the USPTO granted approval in December 2025.\n\n\tState rights-of-publicity laws already protect actors and other celebrities from having their image or likeness ripped off to sell products. However, the Yorn Levine legal team pursued the novel trademark strategy so McConaughey has standing to sue in U.S. federal courts if need be. They say the trademarks could help deter “misuse” more broadly, including for AI video that isn’t explicitly selling anything.\n\t\n\n\t“I don’t know what a court will say in the end. But we have to at least test this,” said Yorn Levine partner and co-founder Kevin Yorn. In addition to representing McConaughey, Yorn reps other top Hollywood actors, including two of the highest box-office grossing actors of all time, Zoe Saldaña and Scarlett Johansson.\n\n\tJonathan Pollack, Yorn Levine of-counsel attorney, added, “In a world where we’re watching everybody scramble to figure out what to do about AI misuse, we have a tool now to stop someone in their tracks or take them to federal court.”\n\n\tThe lawyers said the trademarks for McConaughey also give him protections to develop new opportunities offered by AI technology. McConaughey recently announced a partnership with AI voice company ElevenLabs to replicate a version of his newsletter “Lyrics of Livin’” in Spanish with a likeness of his voice. McConaughey is an investor in ElevenLabs, as is Yorn through venture-capital firm BroadLight Capital, where he is a co-founder and partner.\n\n\tThe eight trademarks associated with McConaughey are registered to J.K. Livin Brands Inc., based in Sherman Oaks, California, the parent of the actor’s Just Keep Livin apparel business.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGrammy-nominated singer-songwriter Gracie Abrams is set to make her acting debut in “Babygirl” director Halina Reijn‘s latest movie for A24.\n\n\tReijn will write and direct the project, titled “Please,” with Abrams starring. Plot details for the film remain under wraps. \n\n\tDavid Hinojosa will produce the film, re-teaming with Reijn for the third time. Reijn will also produce through her Man Up Film banner, with A24 also producing and financing. Zach Nutman will executive produce.\n\t\n\n\t“Please” is Reijn’s third film with A24, following her satirical slasher “Bodies Bodies Bodies” (2022) and her erotic thriller “Babygirl” (2024), which became one of the studio’s biggest global successes and earned $64 million worldwide. A24 additionally acquired her debut feature, 2019’s “Instinct.”\n\n\n\tAs for Abrams, it’s been one hit after another since she burst onto the music scene in 2019. Her EPs, “Minor” and “This Is What It Feels Like,” established Abrams as a talent to watch, with a knack for blending elements of indie folk and pop. Her debut album, 2023’s “Good Riddance,” proved to be a major breakthrough, ultimately earning a nomination for best new artist at the Grammys. Abrams’ 2024 sophomore album, “The Secret of Us,” was a smash hit, featuring singles “Close To You” (her first solo debut on the Billboard Hot 100) and “I Love You, I’m Sorry” (which rose to no. 11 on the U.S. Spotify charts). Her next single, “That’s So True,” off the deluxe edition of the album, hit No. 1 on the US Spotify chart with more than 100 million streams; the song also became Abrams’ first top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 6. In 2025, she earned a best pop duo/group performance nod at the Grammys for “Us,” her duet with Taylor Swift. \n\t\n\n\tEven with all that success in music, a crossover to acting was inevitable considering her father is industry titan J.J. Abrams (“Star Wars,” “Star Trek,” “Alias,” “Lost”).\n",

    "body": "\n\tProsecutors have disclosed an additional allegation of sexual misconduct against actor Timothy Busfield as they seek to keep him in jail pending a trial on child sex abuse charges.\n\n\tBusfield is accused of groping a 16-year-old girl who was auditioning for a role at the B Street Theatre in Sacramento, according to a prosecution filing.\n\n\tBusfield is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Albuquerque, N.M., where he faces three charges of sexual abuse of boy who was an actor on the Fox show “The Cleaning Lady.” Busfield’s lawyer has adamantly denied the charge.\n\t\n\n\tProsecutors are seeking to hold him in jail without bail, arguing that he has exhibited “a sustained pattern of predatory conduct.”\n\n\n\tA hearing on the motion is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\tIn the court filing, prosecutors disclosed that a man came forward on Tuesday to report the Sacramento allegation, which allegedly occurred several years ago.\n\n\t“While auditioning for the defendant at B Street Theatre, the 16-year-old reported that defendant kissed her and put his hands down her pants and touched her privates,” the filing states. “The defendant begged the family to not report to law enforcement if he received therapy.”\n\n\tBusfield’s representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegation.\n\n\tA judge issued a warrant for Busfield’s arrest on Friday on charges of groping the 7-year-old boy on the set of “The Cleaning Lady.” According to the arrest warrant affidavit, the boy told an investigator that Busfield had touched his “private areas” on a bedroom set in Albuquerque.\n\t\n\n\tBusfield’s civil attorney, Larry Stein, said Wednesday that he had passed a polygraph examination regarding the charges.\n\n\t“Tim Busfield denies the allegations in the criminal complaint and maintains they are completely false,” Stein said. “As a voluntary step, he submitted to an independent polygraph examination regarding those allegations and passed.”\n\n\tBusfield surrendered to law enforcement on Tuesday. To hold Busfield without bail, prosecutors must persuade a judge that he presents a danger to the community that cannot be mitigated in any other way.\n\n\tIn the motion, the prosecution noted that Busfield has previously faced other accusations of sexual misconduct, in 1994 and 2012. Those allegations did not result in criminal charges.\n\n\tBusfield was hired to direct six episodes of “The Cleaning Lady,” which aired on Fox from 2022 to 2025.\n\n\tPolice have accused Warner Bros., which produced “The Cleaning Lady,” of making it difficult to investigate the allegations, including by delaying production of an internal investigation into allegations against Busfield.\n\n\t“The delayed and limited cooperation by Warner Bros. in responding to a search warrant further underscores the institutional barriers that have historically enabled this type of misconduct to occur,” prosecutors wrote.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRyan Hurst will play Kratos in the upcoming “God of War” live-action series at Amazon Prime Video.\n\n\tThe role brings Hurst back to the franchise, as previously voiced the Norse god Thor in the video game “God of War: Ragnarok.” Kratos, though is the titular god of war and the lead of the series and the game franchise. \n\n\tThe official description of the character states, “Kratos is Spartan by birth, and a god by nature. Raised in a martial culture, he rose to command armies in service of his homeland until one day he made a fateful deal with Ares, the Greek God of War and lost his soul in exchange for being victorious in battle.”\n\t\n\n\tAs previously reported, the series will pick up with the story of the two most recent “God of War” games, in which Kratos must raise his ten-year old son Atreus. Per the logline, “Father and son Kratos and Atreus embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human.” \n\n\n\tHurst’s TV credits include his acclaimed run as Opie in the hit FX biker drama “Sons of Anarchy” as well as his time as the villain Beta in AMC’s “The Walking Dead.” He has also been on shows like “The Abandons,” “Outsiders,” and “Bates Motel.” In film, he is known for starring in features such as “Remember the Titans,” “Saving Private Ryan,” and “We Were Soldiers,” while he will also appear in Christopher Nolan’s upcoming take on “The Odyssey.” \n\n\tHe is repped by UTA and Piper Kaniecki Marks Management. \n\t\n\n\tAmazon’s adaptation of “God of War” has had a long road to the screen already. The show was originally greenlit at the streaming arm of the e-commerce giant back in 2022. Original showrunner Rafe Judkins exited the show in October 2024, with Ronald D. Moore joining as the new showrunner not long after.\n\n\tMoore is the writer, executive producer, and showrunner on “God of War” under his Tall Ship Productions banner. Frederick E.O. Toye will direct the first two episodes. Maril Davis of Tall Ship also executive produces alongside Cory Barlog, Naren Shankar, Matthew Graham, Asad Qizilbash, Jeff Ketcham, Hermen Hulst, Roy Lee, and Brad Van Arragon. Joe Menosky, Marc Bernardin, Tania Lotia, and Ben McGinnis serve as co-executive producers on the series. The series is co-produced by Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios in association with PlayStation Productions and Tall Ship Productions. Tall Ship is under an overall deal at Sony TV.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile Joseph Kosinski was working on “Top Gun: Maverick,” he was already thinking about his next movie, “F1,” a high-adrenaline action film set in the world of Formula 1 racing. So, he called on his go-to cinematographer Claudio Miranda, who was also working on “Top Gun: Maverick.”\n\n\tKosinski wanted to do everything for real, immerse audiences in the film and avoid the use of green screens. Miranda started to think, “Is there any technology we need to figure out?”\n\t\n\n\tAs with “Top Gun: Maverick,” where he pushed camera technology to new limits, Miranda worked with Sony Electronics to develop a custom camera to film high-speed shots. The custom cameras were built and mounted into the racing for filming — four per car, with remote control over pan and focus.\n\n\n\tDuring a conversation moderated by Variety senior artisans editor Jazz Tangcay, Kosinski said, that while much of the behind-the-scenes was about the technology, everything was driven by story and character. “How do we connect the audience with the characters in a movie like this? That’s what drove all of this innovation that Claudio did.”\n\n\tThe Apple Original Film stars Brad Pitt as former Formula 1 race car driver Sonny Hayes, a retired driver. Javier Bardem plays Ruben, the boss of an underdog racing team who convinces Sonny to return to the sport to partner with and mentor rookie driver Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris). The film picks up halfway through the Formula 1 season, and by bringing Sonny into the mix, Ruben hopes the team lands a podium finish.\n\n\tWhen it came to creating the tension between Sonny and Joshua, Kosinski explained it had to be on the page first. His next challenge was finding the right actor to play Joshua Pearce. Enter casting director Lucy Bevan, who searched far and wide looking at thousands of tapes. Kosinski said, “Damson was a miracle and went toe-to-toe with one of the biggest movie stars in the world, in his first film, and really just created this character that’s so alive.” He continued, “He is the antagonist, but he’s so likable because you totally understand where he’s coming from.”\n\t\n\n\tIn his compositions, Miranda said, “We picked the angles we needed for the scene. If we wanted to go intense, we pushed in a little bit more.” But that wasn’t just on the racetracks, when scenes took place off the grid he still looked to find ways of creating tension and beauty.\n\n\tIn one scene, Sonny and Kerry Condon’s character, Kate, have a heart-to-heart on a hotel balcony, and he opens up to her about his feelings in Las Vegas. Aside from the shot being very high up, Miranda had to contend with the neon lights of the city. “That’s a real location and it does create a little bit of lighting challenges. It’s really the night before the grand prix and you see the stadiums being set up. It’s real-time, there’s Vegas, and those lights are annoying sometimes,” said Miranda. But he found a positive in what he couldn’t control. “Sometimes those lights would go white, but in a way, it grounded the movie, and I kind of liked it as these things would blow up.” He added, “It grounds the actor in the environment. Maybe if I didn’t control it too much, it might have felt a little more synthetic.”\n",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          Law enforcement sources tell TMZ ... Kiefer told police he was having dinner with a friend Sunday night. Late in the evening, he called for an Uber Black, the driver arrived, Kiefer jumped in and they were on their way to Kiefer's home.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    Broadcastify.com\n          \n    \n          For some reason, during the drive, Kiefer told the driver to pull over and let him out. Kiefer told cops the driver refused, and Kiefer twice more asked the driver to pull over, to no avail.\n      \n\n          At some point, according to the Uber driver, Kiefer threatened to kill him if he didn't pull over. The driver, who called 911, claims Kiefer assaulted the driver with his hands.\n      \n    \n                    \n                          \n                                  \n      \n        \n    \n          As for what dispute triggered the confrontation, it could be a language barrier. Our law enforcement sources say, when cops arrived, the Uber driver -- who spoke Russian or Armenian -- requested a translator. LAPD then called someone who spoke his language.\n      \n    \n          We're told the driver never alleged an injury, but Kiefer was arrested for a felony ... making a criminal threat. He was released on $50,000 bail.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Kiefer Sutherland\n              \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

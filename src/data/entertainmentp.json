    "body": "\n\tIvo M. Ferreira‘s thriller “Projecto Global,” which has its world premiere in the Big Screen Competition of the International Film Festival Rotterdam, has debuted its trailer (below).\n\n\n\n\n\tThe world sales rights are held by The Match Factory.\n\n\tThe film is set in Lisbon in the 1980s. The Carnation Revolution, which heralded Portugual’s transition to democracy, and the euphoria of freedom belong to the past. The country faces turbulent times: factories close, workers raise barricades, and politics dominates every street corner.\n\t\n\n\tAs social tensions deepen, the far-left armed group FP25 emerges. Its members follow a path of no return, living underground lives built on bank robberies, attacks, friendship, family, and love — all under the perpetual threat of prison or death.\n\n\n\tAs they abandon everything and everyone except each other, they begin to lose their own identities, while an officer fighting against them faces a moral dilemma of his own.\n\n\tFerreira comments: “ ‘Projecto Global’ speaks of a dream of equality from which one is forced to awaken, and of the difficulty of accepting defeat when ideas collide with reality – made up of compromises, interests, pettiness, and renunciations. We swing between the euphoria of wanting to change the world and creeping despair.”\n\n\tThe cast is led by Jani Zhao, Rodrigo Tomás and José Pimentão. The screenplay is by Ferreira and Hélder Beja. The producers are Luís Urbano, Sandro Aguilar and Donato Rotunno. The lead production company is O Som E A Fúria. The film is co-produced by Tarantula.\n\t\n\n\tIn 1998, Ferreira’s short film “O que foi” was released, and his first feature film, “Em Volta,” came out in 2002. In 2006, he received a scholarship from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation to attend a screenplay writing course at the London International Film School, which led him to write and direct “Águas Mil,” screened at several film festivals in 2009.\n\n\tIn 2010, he released “The Foreigner and Vai com o Vento.” In 2016, he wrote and directed “Letters From War,” a feature film based on the book by António Lobo Antunes, which premiered in competition at the Berlinale. His next film, “Empire Hotel,” shot in Macau, was released in 2018.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBeta Cinema has come on board as the sales agent for Adrian Goiginger’s “Four Minus Three,” which has its world premiere in the Panorama section at this year’s Berlinale. The trailer debuts here.\n\n\n\n\n\t“Four Minus Three” stars Valerie Pachner, Robert Stadlober, Stefanie Reinsperger, Hanno Koffler and Ronald Zehrfeld.\n\n\tThe film, inspired by a true story, centers on Barbara and her partner Heli, who are professional clowns, living out their dream of an alternative, joy-filled life with their two children, laughing at what doesn’t work out.

Lightdox is handling world sales. The trailer debuts below.\n\n\n\n\n\tIn a separate distribution deal, Rapid Eye Movies has acquired rights for Germany and Austria, with plans for a spring theatrical release. The company will present the film to exhibitors during the European Film Market in Berlin.\n\t\n\n\t“We are happy and excited to release Lana Daher’s beautiful, innovative and deeply touching film ‘Do You Love Me’ in German cinemas this spring,” said Stephan Holl of Rapid Eye Movies.\n\n\n\tComposed entirely of archival footage, “Do You Love Me” is “a playful and deeply personal journey through Lebanon’s audiovisual memory, spanning more than 70 years of film, television, home videos, and photography,” Lightdox said. “Framed as a love letter to Beirut, the film explores the country’s collective psyche — shaped by joy and intimacy, destruction and loss — in a nation without a national archive, where images become acts of preservation, resistance, and renewal.”\n\n\tThe film had its world premiere at Venice Days and has since screened at major international festivals including IDFA, Doclisboa, Cairo Film Festival, Marrakech Film Festival and Hamburg Film Festival.\n\n\tUpcoming screenings include Göteborg Film Festival, DocPoint, Antenna Documentary Film Festival, and SXSW, where the film will make its U.S. premiere.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn “Rock Springs,” a newly widowed, grief-addled mother moves with her young daughter to a creaky, remote cottage in the woods of Wyoming, which, as anyone even casually versed in horror cinema will immediately guess, turns out to be a bad idea for all the usual reasons. But it’s the more unusual reasons — and in particular, one non-generic, historically specific one — that give Vera Miao‘s debut feature its punch. The eponymous town, it turns out, is the site of the real-life 1885 Rock Springs Massacre, in which at least 28 Chinese immigrant miners were killed by their resentful white counterparts, and that atrocity bleeds into Miao’s present-day ghost story in unshakable ways.\n\t\n\n\tThe latest entry in a growing subgenre of American horror films in which racial trauma drives much of the terror, “Rock Springs” benefits in its contemporary scenes from a mulchy, overcast sense of place and a fine, tensely wired performance by Kelly Marie Tran as a westernized Asian-American woman with no idea of the diasporic quagmire she’s stepped into. There’s a certain stylistic familiarity to these proceedings, as Miao borrows tropes and even wholesale shot constructions from recent genre forebears — but when it plunges directly into history, in flashback scenes headlined by the redoubtable Benedict Wong as a miner running for his life, it’s a more bracing, lingering work. Genre-oriented distributors should take interest following the film’s premiere in Sundance’s Midnight strand.\n\n\n\tA surreal prologue introduces young Gracie (Aria Kim), a solemn-faced poppet in pink pajamas, wandering a desolate dreamland of gray hillocks built from gathered ash or dust. Like the baleful graphics that bridge the film’s chapter headings — of a strange, bulbous organism morphing and swelling in bruised, rotting hues — it’s a striking visual effect without much immediate thematic payoff, though it comes to suggest a kind of barren holding room between life and death. Back in the real world, Gracie has retreated into silence since the untimely death of her father, and a move to rural Wyoming — where her out-of-commission cellist mother Emily (Tran) has taken a job teaching community college — hasn’t exactly brought her out of her shell.\n\t\n\n\tMoving with them is Emily’s likewise bereaved mother-in-law (Fiona Fu), a first-generation Chinese immigrant who speaks no English — not the only cultural barrier between her and Emily, born to Vietnamese parents but adopted and raised by a white family, who regards with skepticism the older woman’s traditional spiritual beliefs and rituals. Many of those, in this moment, revolve around securing a safe passage to the afterlife for her late son: That they’ve relocated in the “month of hungry ghosts” is a point of major concern to her, dismissed by Emily with some irritation.\n\n\tBut the ghosts do hunger, it seems. It isn’t long before Emily is having regular, not entirely benevolent visions of her late husband in the new house, while Gracie, who already has something of a fey aura about her, seems to be a magnet for rustling signals from the beyond — and that creepy, raven-haired antique doll she picks up at a local yard sale isn’t helping matters either. The house may be haunted, but playing outside is no safer: The woods have eyes, and grasping hands too.\n\n\tJust as the situation reaches an eerie crisis point, Miao abruptly switches tack and perspective, yanking us back 140 years to real-world horrors that unfolded on the very ground where Emily and Gracie’s new house now stands — a far more effective and disquieting play on the rooted-on-the-spot time travel device seen in the recent Robert Zemeckis dud “Here,” though Heyjin Jun’s camera can’t afford to stand still in a situation of escalating peril. With burly melancholy, Wong plays Ah Tseng, a Chinese migrant worker employed — with his young nephews — in the Rock Springs coal mines, though introduced on an idle day off in their makeshift camp. As the Chinese men shoot the breeze and play cards, a mob of armed white miners gathers over the hill and encroaches on the unsuspecting outsiders.\n\n\tThe ensuing attack is staged with harrowing, heart-in-mouth immediacy, shot by Jun with propulsive, handheld looseness and mud on the lens. Occurring shy of the halfway mark, it’s the film’s standout setpiece, unmatched for chilling vividness and tension by anything that follows. But “Rock Springs” remains both shivery and affecting as it tracks the spectral echoes from this tragedy to its 21st-century domestic drama, intelligently shedding light both on a buried historical hate crime and the ongoing microaggressions experienced by Asian-Americans across the country today. \n\t\n\n\tMiao has a brisk, tingling command of atmosphere, and if she occasionally seems still in search of a style all her own — with one hat-tip too many to the “Hereditary”-patented upside-down driving shot — this promising debut has a human touch and point of view that are rather more distinctive within the genre, resting on Chinese mysticism without cheapening or exploiting it. Don’t feed the ghosts, “Rock Springs” warns its audience. But don’t fear them either. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThree of Spain’s most distinguished creators, “The Invisible Guest” director Oriol Paulo,  “La Unidad” co-creator Alberto Marini and documentary maker Jon Sistiaga are spearheading new projects from Netflix Spain.\n\n\tPaulo, whose mind-bending murder mystery “The Invisible Guest” grossed $25 million in China, has assembled a top-notch Spanish cast – Eduard Fernández (“The 47”), Mario Casas (“The Innocent”), Blanca Suárez (“Cable Girls”), Alexandra Jiménez (“The Innocent) – for “En nombre de otro,” which Netflix describes as “a fast-paced thriller where nothing is what it seems.” \n\t\n\n\tThe movie, currently in production, is produced by Juanita Films, behind Paulo’s latest original for Netflix, psychological thriller series “The Last Night at Tremore Beach.”\n\n\n\tCo-creator of two Movistar Plus+ hits, Spanish intelligence services thriller “La Unidid” and “Marbella” – a fun dramedy-thriller set in the sybaritic drug gang world of Marbella –  screenwriter Marini is now set to make one of his earliest incursions into direction, with “Lobo,” from “La unidad” and “Gangs of Galicia” producer Vaca Films.  \n\n\tA miniseries now shooting, “Lobo” is inspired by Spain’s first recorded case of a serial killer, Manuel Blanco Romasanta, a traveling tailor in rural Galicia who when arrested in 1852 claimed in his defence that he was a werewolf. “Lobo” stars Luis Tosar (“Sky High”) and features Tristán Ulloa (“Berlín”). Marini co-writes with “La Unidad” editor Juan Galiñanes and co-directs with Javier Rodríguez Delgado, a co-ordinatng director on “Gangs of Galicia.”\n\t\n\n\tNetflix released a first look image of both “Lobo,” and “En nombre de otro.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Lobo’ \n\t\n\n\n\n\tSistiaga is directing “Miguel Ángel Blanco: las 48 horas que lo cambiaron todo,” a doc-feature co-directed with Juanjo López and produced by The Tintirin Team. \n\n\tIt explores the two days after Blanco’s abduction by terrorist org ETA in 1997 during when millions of people mobilized in a desperate attempt to prevent his threatened murder, “an agonizingly delayed death that left a lasting scar on Spanish society. The documentary revisits that crucial moment of solidarity and compassion, when Basque society lost its fear to ETA,” Netflix said in a statement Monday.\n\n\tAt a showcase last Thursday in Madrid, Netflix delivered an update on 2026 releases. In 2025, according to a recent Netflix engagement report for the second half of 2025, Spain rated alongside Japan, though way behind Korea, releasing three titles which hit over 20 million views: “Angela” from Atresmedia (36 million views), “Billionaire’s Bunker” (28 million) from “Money Heist” creators Alex Pina and Esther Martínez Lobato, and “Two Graves” (26 million).\n\n\tNetflix Spain’s big release in 2026, on paper at least, is “Berlin and the Lady with an Ermine,” the second season of “Money Heist” spin-off “Berlin” which hit 51 million views in early 2024. \n\n\tBowing May 15, it should help a 2026 Netflix performance in Spain whose releases and productions are laden with big Spanish stars, pack new titles from some of Spain’s best directors and are strong on crime and true crime – both “Lobo” and “Miguel Angel Blanco” slot in different ways into that category. \n\n\tWith a second season of “Alpha Males” already released in Spain and hitting No. 4 on Netflix global non-English TV series chart and “53 Sundays” (see below) in the offing, comedy may well be building on Netflix in Spain, a sign perhaps of the streaming service’s ever broader neo-broadcast network audiences.         \n\n\tSome other potential Netflix Spain highlights for 2026: \n\n\t*The Final Problem,” with Jose Coronado, Maribel Verdú, and Martiño Rivas, a ‘50s-set murder mystery miniseries, based on the novel by Arturo Pérez-Reverte, and directed by Félix Viscarret (“Patria”)\n\t\n\n\t*Salvador,” starring Luis Tosar and Claudia Salas in an eight-part drama-thriller with Tosar playing a father trying to extract his daughter from a neo-Nazi gang; \n\n\t*”Murder in Galicia,” a true crime three-part series starring Tristán Ulloa and co-created by Ramón Campos at Bambu Producciones, behind mega-hit “The Asunta Case”:\n\n\t*The Child,” led by Belén Cuesta (“The Endless Trench”) and Karra Elejalde (“While at War”), adapting the novel of the same title by Fernando Aramburu (“Patria”) and marking the latest from Mariano Barroso, behind “What the Future Holds” and “The Invisible Line”; \n\n\t*53 Sundays,” starring two of Spain’s greatest comedy talents, Carmen Machi and Javier Cámara, plus Javier Gutiérrez,  directed by Cesc Gay (“Truman”)\n\n\t*A Day Like No Other” A biopic of legendary ‘60s Spanish crooner Raphael, who presented the title in person at a Netflix showcase on Thursday. Spain’s DLO Producciones, part of Banijay Entertainment, produces.\n\n\t*”Rafa,” a documentary charting tennis great Rafael Nadal as a professional player.  \n",

Faithful fans should expect an intense, joyful night out as we reveal a thrilling new hunting ground for our Traitors.”\n\n\tCaro Newling, co-founder of Neal Street Productions, added: “In developing ‘The Traitors’ for the stage, Neal Street and Studio Lambert have curated a team of brilliant faithful theater-makers led by director Rob Hastie and writer John Finnemore to bring a bold, structural twist to the format that only the live medium can provide.”\n\n\tCasting, venue selection and performance dates remain under wraps. Licensing arrangements were handled by All3Media International.\n\t\n\n\tThe original format launched from Dutch broadcasters IDTV and Posvideo working with RTL Creative Unit. Local versions now air in more than 30 markets globally, while broadcasters in over 50 countries have acquired completed episodes. The franchise extends beyond television into board games, card games and a London-based immersive attraction that opened last summer.\n\n\tIndustry recognition includes Emmy, BAFTA and RTS honors. The format has also collected prizes from the Asian Academy Creative Awards, Rose d’Or and Producers Guild of America.\n\n\tHastie recently joined the National Theatre as deputy artistic director. His “Operation Mincemeat” currently plays London’s West End and Broadway. Finnemore earned the Writers’ Guild of Great Britain’s lifetime achievement honor in 2020.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe critically acclaimed British musical “Cable Street” will make its international bow this spring when it opens the 2026 Brits Off Broadway season at 59E59 Theaters, running April 26 through May 24.\n\n\tSet against the backdrop of 1930s East London, the musical dramatizes a pivotal historical moment when over 100,000 residents – Jews, Irish dockers, trade unionists, communists and everyday locals – united to oppose the rise of fascism in their neighborhood. The narrative explores themes of division, identity and solidarity that resonate with contemporary social issues.\n\t\n\n\tThe production transfers its award-nominated London cast and creative team from its London run for the Manhattan engagement. \n\n\n\tOlivier Award nominee Debbie Chazen (“Murder on the Orient Express,” “Jews. In Their Own Words”) returns to her role as Kathleen, heading a cast that includes Ethan Pascal Peters (“Muriel’s Wedding,” “Nerds”) as Moishe and Max Alexander Taylor (“Jesus Christ Superstar,” “Precipice”) as Sean. The ensemble also features Aoife Mac Namara (“Sleeping Beauty”) as Orlaith and Jez Unwin (“Groundhog Day,” “The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe”) as Yitzhak and Steve.\n\n\tAdditional casting includes Lizzy Rose Esin Kelly (“The Lightning Thief,” “Little Shop of Horrors”) as Mairead, Isaac Gryn (“Stranger Things: The First Shadow,” “The Tattooist of Auschwitz”) as Sammy, and Barney Wilkinson (“Stranger Things: The First Shadow,” “Bonnie & Clyde”) as Ron. Olivier nominee Preeya Kalidas (“Everybody’s Talking About Jamie,” “If Then”) will portray Edie and Elizabeth, while Romona Lewis Malley (“Clueless,” “Malpractice”) joins as Rosa. The ensemble includes Michali Dantes (“Jesus Christ Superstar”), Annie Majin (“Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812”) and Natalie Elisha Welsh (“A Midsummer Night’s Dream”) as Rachel.\n\t\n\n\tMulti-award winning composer Tim Gilvin (“Unfortunate: The Untold Story of Ursula the Sea Witch,” “The Jingleclaw”) penned the score and lyrics, with book by Alex Kanefsky (“All For Your Delight,” “The Boy and the Mermaid”). Adam Lenson (“Public Domain,” “The Rink”) directs, with musical supervision by Tamara Saringer (“Clueless,” “Two Strangers Carry a Cake Across New York”).\n\n\tDylan Schlosberg produces for 10 to 4 Productions, with Neil Marcus as associate producer.\n\n\t“We’re honored to have been invited to showcase ‘Cable Street’ at Brits Off Broadway this year,” Schlosberg said. “Though rooted in 1930s London, its themes feel unmistakably current and I’m confident New York audiences will feel that.”\n\n\t59E59 Theaters, established in 2004 by the Elysabeth Kleinhans Theatrical Foundation, provides professional space and expertise to non-profit theater companies premiering work in New York. Under artistic director Val Day and managing director Brian Beirne, the venue presents a year-round curated Off-Broadway program. Brits Off Broadway is the venue’s annual festival celebrating independent British theater.\n\n\tTickets are available from Jan. 27 here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChristian Vesper is to step down from his position as Fremantle‘s CEO, global drama and film, bringing to a close a decade‑long tenure in which he has played a central role in shaping the company’s global scripted strategy. Films produced during this time include “Bugonia,” “Pillion,” “The Chronology of Water,” “Queer” and “Maria.”\n\n\tIn the last five years, Fremantle has produced or was part of more than 80 films and is on track to release its 100th film in 2026. This period has been marked by critical success, including four Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, five BAFTAs, eight Cannes winners, and seven Venice winners, including the Golden Lion.\n\t\n\n\tVesper leaves Fremantle’s film and drama operations “in a position of strength,” the company said, having played a key role in expanding its scripted footprint, particularly through an extensive slate of first‑look and creative collaborations with global film and TV creators. These include partnerships with Emma Stone and Dave McCary’s Fruit Tree Productions; Kristen Stewart, Dylan Meyer and Maggie McLean’s Nevermind Pictures; Pablo and Juan de Dios Larraín’s Fabula; Rachel Weisz and Polly Stokes’ Astral Projection; Edward Berger’s Nine Hours; Johan Renck and Michael Parets’ Sinestra Films; Sarah Condon’s Fair Harbour; and Richard Yee and Krishnendu Majumdar’s Me+You Productions.\n\n\n\tAs well as “Bugonia,” “Pillion,” “Queer,” “Maria” and “The Chronology of Water,” Vesper has EP’d and shepherded through Fremantle such films and series as “Picnic at Hanging Rock,” “The Luminaries,” “On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,” and the upcoming Rachel Weisz starrer, the Thomas Alfredson directed “Séance on a Wet Afternoon.” Most recently he worked to set up the Fox Network revival of “Baywatch.”\n\t\n\n\tOther highlights during Vesper’s tenure include festival premieres and critical acclaim for “Without Blood” (directed by Angelina Jolie, and starring Salma Hayek), “M. Son of the Century” (directed by Joe Wright, starring Luca Marinelli), “Faithless” (directed by Tomas Alfredson, starring Frida Gustavsson, Gustav Lindh, and August Wittgenstein), Cannes winner “My Father’s Shadow” and “The Listeners” (directed by Janicza Bravo, starring Rebecca Hall).\n\n\tVesper, who joined Fremantle in 2016, has been “instrumental in establishing [it] as an internationally recognized center of excellence for drama and film,” the company said. \n\n\tBased in London, he reported into Andrea Scrosati, group COO and CEO Continental Europe, who will now oversee the film and drama division on an interim basis “in close collaboration with the wider film and drama leadership team.”\n\n\tScrosati said: “I would like to personally thank Christian for his unwavering commitment and contribution to Fremantle over the past decade. With Christian at the helm, we have established our drama and film business and delivered both consistent success and critical acclaim. Our scripted portfolio is today a key component of our business and recognized across the industry. Christian is a creative at heart, and his vision has helped build the credibility of our drama and film slate. We appreciate that he now wishes to focus on new horizons, and we all wish him well in the future.”\n\n\tVesper said: “After 10 years with Fremantle, I have decided that the time is right to step down from my role as CEO film and drama. I would like to thank Jennifer Mullin and Andrea Scrosati for their incredible support, ambition and creative spirit, enabling us to build our film and drama capabilities. I am extremely proud of what we have achieved together, and the fact we will deliver our 100th film this year underlines the progress made. Fremantle is an incredible company and has been a huge part of my life for the last decade. We have built a dedicated and talented team whom I will miss greatly, but I know they will take our film and drama business to even greater heights. Now is the perfect moment for my next adventure, and I am excited for the journey ahead.”\n\n\tBefore joining Fremantle, Vesper spent 14 years at Sundance TV, where he oversaw the network’s scripted projects and led co‑productions including “Rectify,” “The Honorable Woman,” “The Last Panthers,” “Top of the Lake” and “Deutschland 83.” He previously held roles at HBO, iFilm, October Films and USA Films.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRalf Little is set to take on the role of disillusioned British intelligence officer Alec Leamas in the U.K. tour of John le Carré‘s “The Spy Who Came in From the Cold.”\n\n\tThe production, a collaboration between The Ink Factory and Second Half Productions, will launch March 12 at Curve Leicester and continue through August, visiting 21 venues across the country. Additional casting will be revealed at a later date.\n\n\n\t“It is a huge privilege to be stepping into the shoes of one of John le Carré’s great literary creations, Alec Leamas as we bring the murky world of his Cold War masterpiece to life on stage,” said Little, best known for his roles in BBC’s “Death in Paradise” and “The Royle Family.” “I first read ‘The Spy Who Came in From the Cold’ when I was 16 and it has stayed with me ever since.”\n\t\n\n\tThe stage adaptation marks the first time a le Carré novel has been brought to the theater. Playwright David Eldridge, whose credits include “Festen” and “End,” penned the script, with Jeremy Herrin directing alongside tour director Joe Lichtenstein.\n\n\tThe production premiered at Chichester Festival Theatre in 2024 before transferring to London’s West End at @sohoplace in November 2025, where it is currently playing its final weeks ahead of a Feb. 21 closing. Rory Keenan originated the role of Leamas in both productions.\n\n\tPublished over 60 years ago, “The Spy Who Came in From the Cold” follows veteran spy Leamas as he undertakes one final dangerous mission for spymaster George Smiley. The story explores themes of deception and moral compromise against the backdrop of Cold War espionage.\n\t\n\n\tLittle, who received an Olivier Award nomination for his performance in “Presence” at the Royal Court, departed “Death in Paradise” in 2024 after the series achieved its highest audience ratings during his tenure as lead detective. His other theater credits include “God of Carnage” at Theatre Royal Bath and “Ugly Lies the Bone” at the National Theatre.\n\n\tThe creative team includes Max Jones (set design), Azusa Ono (lighting), Elizabeth Purnell (sound), Paul Englishby (composition) and Lucy Cullingford (movement direction). Second Half Productions serves as general manager, with Melting Pot as executive producer for the tour.\n",

When Dawsey asked Trump if the Border Patrol agent who shot Pretti was in the right, the president dodged the question.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    Drop Site News\n          \n    \n          Trump then took a swipe at Pretti, saying, “I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn’t play good either.”\n      \n    \n          As you know, Pretti was gunned down by the Border Patrol agent on a Minneapolis street Saturday. Federal officials defended the agent, claiming he shot the 37-year-old intensive care nurse -- who was armed with a pistol -- because he feared for his life.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          But multiple videos taken by eyewitnesses have surfaced on social media, completely contradicting federal officials' claims.\n      \n    \n          During his interview with the WSJ, Trump addressed whether immigration enforcement officers will ever leave Minneapolis -- and the commander-in-chief seemed open to the idea. He said \"we will leave\" at some point, and also gave the agents props for the \"phenomenal job” they've done.\n      \n    \n          Right after Saturday's shooting, Trump took to Truth Social to blame Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for Pretti's death. 47's rationale was that Walz and Frey called off local police, leaving the federal agents unprotected to take matters into their own hands, which led to Pretti's shooting.\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          A manager for the actor tells TMZ ... he's been hospitalized in Atlanta for the past three days. We're told Quinton was walking up the stairs in his apartment last week when his legs suddenly stopped functioning, causing him to collapse. He was rushed to the hospital.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          According to a GoFundMe page, organizers claim Quinton is \"on life support due to a severe blood infection.\" However, his manager tells us he's stable, communicating with his family and team, and receiving precisely the care needed at this time.\n      \n    \n          His manager tells us doctors are still running tests and evaluating Quinton's condition, and at this time, there's no definitive word on what caused the fall.\n      \n    \n          We're told Quinton and his family are taking things one step at a time. While they're asking for privacy during this period, his rep says they want fans to know they deeply appreciate the outpouring of love, prayers, and well wishes.\n      \n    \n          The health scare comes after a series of medical battles for the 40 year old actor. In March 2025, he was rushed to a California medical facility after developing a fever and coughing up blood.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          At the time, Aaron said doctors ran multiple tests and believed he was dealing with Type A flu and pneumonia.

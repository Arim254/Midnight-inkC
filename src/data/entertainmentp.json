The Gyeonggi Content Agency, which signed a memorandum of understanding with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taicca/\">TAICCA</a> (Taiwan Creative Content Agency) in 2024, will also bring content companies and investors from the region.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFrance is matching that commitment with its own pavilion, jointly organized by Institut Français and Business France. The delegation includes 10 companies spanning film, animation and immersive content, with heavy-hitters like the Centre national du cinéma et de l’image animée (CNC), Bpifrance and the acclaimed Series Mania festival sending representatives to explore cross-border opportunities.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe international contingent comprises 51 exhibitors from France, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Hong Kong, joined by 67 Taiwanese companies across film, TV, animation, publishing, comics, performing arts and gaming.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThailand’s government-established Creative Economy Agency is making its TCCF debut seeking partnerships with Taiwanese creators, while the Philippines’ Center for International Trade Expositions and Missions aims to boost Filipino content’s global visibility. Hong Kong is represented by Regentact, specializing in Asian content distribution and co-productions, and Cheers Media, known for its program distribution expertise.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the local front, Taiwan’s Animation & Visual Effects Association is launching an Animation & Visual Technologies Zone featuring 14 local animation companies showcasing the island’s complete production capabilities from pre-production through distribution.</p>\n<p>\n\tA Production Resource Zone brings together film commissions and shooting support centers from eight major cities and counties – Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, Nantou, Chiayi, Tainan and Kaohsiung – to promote Taiwan’s diverse filming locations and production services to international crews.</p>\n<p>\n\tTAICCA chair Sue Wang said the record international participation demonstrates the global market’s strong interest in Taiwan’s creative content industry, expressing hope that TCCF will continue driving outstanding works and creators onto the world stage.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe International <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/classic-film-market/\">Classic Film Market</a> (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mifc/\">MIFC</a>), the world’s only market dedicated to restoring and promoting heritage films, returns to Lyon alongside the Lumière Film Festival for its 13th edition expected to draw a record number of participants.</p>\n<p>\n\t“All our indicators are up, both in terms of newcomers and international participants,” co-head Anaïs Desrieux told <em>Variety</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tThree high-profile guests of honor underscore the festival’s global reach: Andrea Kalas, VP of Media and Archival Services at Iron Mountain, Justine Ryst, YouTube’s France chief, and Gaëtan Bruel, the new head of the France’s film board CNC.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother sign of the market’s growing industry pull comes from U.K.-based Park Circus, which joins this year as an official partner. The company handles global distribution of heritage titles for major U.S. studios as well as British and European libraries. CEO Douglas Davis will join Studiocanal’s Pauline Saint-Hilaire and Mk2 Films’ Benoit Claro for a roundtable on building international distribution strategies for heritage film.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTechnology remains a hot topic, notably the use of AI in classic film preservation and restoration, with a focus this year on subtitling and dubbing. The debate will bring together heritage film conservation outfit Vectracom, Phont, a start-up specialised in so-called “emotional subtitling,” and translators’ representatives.</p>\n<p>\n\t“No one at the table is opposed to progress, but the real challenge is to ensure that this innovation truly qualifies as such for the whole ecosystem,” said Desrieux. Co-head Gérald Duchaussoy added “subtitles are not neutral – subtitling is a creative activity that shapes how films are understood.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNew tools will be on display at the Classics Innovation Corner, where startups such as Phont, AI-powered search and licensing platform Refractio, and distributor-oriented CN Films will present their tech.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother key theme is the growing role of streaming services in the circulation of heritage cinema, which Ryst is sure to address as she spotlights YouTube’s 20th anniversary.</p>\n<p>\n\t“There is a great heritage offer on YouTube, with access to films, archives and programs dedicated to classic films, and content creators engaging whole new audiences,” said Duchaussoy.</p>\n<p>\n\tCase studies will feature Sooner – the new merger of French streamers Universciné and Filmo –, heritage film platform LaCinetek, and entertainment site Allociné, which is launching a dedicated service, Allociné Classique. “Thanks to these platforms, the films are not just being preserved, they are being reintroduced to audiences in the digital era,” Desrieux noted. </p>\n<p>\n\tFrom digital strategies to face-to-face deal-making, circulation remains a priority for organizers, with initiatives like the popular Re>Birth program, now in its third edition. The showcase pitches either recently restored titles carrying the Lumière Classics label or works seeking restoration partners for 10-minute sessions followed by one-to-one meetings aimed at sparking deals.</p>\n<p>\n\tHungary provides an inspiring example as country of honor thanks to its strong track-record in preservation and circulation through events such as the Budapest Classic Film Marathon. MIFC regular György Ráduly, head of the Hungarian National Film Archive, will be among the guests.  </p>\n<p>\n\tOther highlights include debates on the new AgoraEU program, Europe’s audiovisual heritage policy, and the power of curated retrospectives, with this year’s tributes to Martin Ritt and Konrad Wolf illustrating how restorations drive a second life in theaters, festivals, on TV and platforms. France’s arthouse exhibitors’ association, AFCAE, which marks its 70th anniversary, will examine the future of classic film on the big screen.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs always, there will be the market’s staple sessions, from catalogue holders’ previews to distributors’ line-ups and dedicated events for exhibitors.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfrican cinema will also take the spotlight with a showcase of the new podcast series “Cineastes d’Afrique,” celebrating pioneers of African filmmaking.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLooking to the future, a new European student workshop will bring together some 40 students from six universities to work with professionals in the heritage field. “We want to help the next generation build connections that will shape the sector’s future,” said Desrieux.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Duchaussoy, the workshop reflects the market’s broader mission: “Heritage cinema is not just about looking back,” he said. “It’s about imagining the future, with new professionals, new technologies and new audiences.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Desrieux summed up, “Our goal is to give the heritage sector a stronger international framework and profile. That means bringing players together, questioning our practices and creating real business opportunities around the circulation of classic films.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe MIFC runs in Lyon over Oct. 14–Oct. 17.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tOscar-winning ‘Roma’ producer Pimienta Films has boarded “Lux Noctis,” the latest from Mexico’s Maligno Gorehouse, best known for their chilling drama “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/huesera/\">Huesera</a>” by Michelle Garza Cervera and for co-producing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/blumhouse/\">Blumhouse</a>’s first Mexican horror film, “No me sigas.”</p>\n<p>\n\t‘Lux Noctis’ is also by a female director, Damiana Acuña , who makes this drama her directorial feature debut.  \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Being part of ‘Lux Noctis’ by Damiana is something I’m incredibly excited about. I’ve been following her work and growth over the years, and when I heard her pitch at Ventana Sur and we talked a bit about her vision for this debut feature, I was thrilled at the possibility of joining in,” said Pimienta Films’ Nicolas Celis, who boards as a minority partner.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I was impressed by her sensitivity, the depth with which she approached the story, and I was moved by the boldness of the project—tackled with such rigor—that I would’ve been a fool not to jump in and accompany her on this journey,” he added.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Lux Noctis” takes place in a remote matriarchal community where women survive a threatening darkness thanks to their power to create light. Lina, a young woman facing harsh coming-of-age rituals, forms a forbidden connection with a man. Her choice challenges the rules of her world and sparks a rebellion that paves the way for a new way of life.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Nico and Pimienta’s experience with auteur-driven films that have achieved international reach is something we’re all very excited about, and we’re confident it will help take ‘Lux Noctis’ even further,” said Acuña, adding: “Nico and I grew up in the same town in Morelos, which adds a more personal and familiar touch to our collaboration.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We believe that ‘Lux Noctis’ is a project rooted in genre, but Damiana’s vision has the potential to take it to a very powerful level,” said Eduardo Lecuona, a co-founding partner alongside Javier Sepúlveda of Maligno Gorehouse.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Pimienta Films was invited as a co-producer to strengthen the project and form a team to help elevate this fantasy-horror genre project to the level of auteur cinema, an area in which Pimienta is an expert,” added Lecuona, who co-directed “No me sigas” with Ximena Garcia Lecuona<em>.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tMaligno Gorehouse describes itself like “an obsessed Dr. Frankenstein in his lab, set on awakening a new generation of horror filmmakers.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBased in Mexico City, the company has made it its mission to work with young directors that promise to give audiences “new visions of horror.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“Lux Noctis” started gaining traction in 2023, when it participated in the Cine Qua Non Lab and Linterna Lab. It was a semifinalist for the NYX Fellowship (Stowe Story Labs, U.S.) and won multiple development awards at Ventana Sur’s genre sidebar, Blood Window. It also won the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sitges/\">Sitges</a> Film Festival’s <em>Woman in Fan</em> Award and the Fantastic Pavilion Award at Marché du Film. At the BIFFF Market, it won the Hatching Award to present the project at Iberseries & Platino Industria.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt later received the Cinecolor Award at the Los Cabos International Film Festival. In 2025, it was one of five projects selected by Cannes’ Breaking Through the Lens.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThere are two ways to think about “Nineteen Eighty-Four,” the great dystopian novel of totalitarianism that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/george-orwell/\">George Orwell</a> wrote on the Scottish isle of Jura and published in 1949, six months before his death (at 46, of complications from tuberculosis). The first and most obvious way to think about it is as a midnight-dark tale of political oppression: the deprivation and bullying violence that dominate life in a ruthless authoritarian state. To a large degree, Orwell based the book on his perception of the Soviet Union, but he drew from other regimes as well, crafting a myth of what it’s like to exist as a humble pawn in a fascist prison state.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tYet that’s not ultimately the reason “Nineteen Eighty-Four” remains such a brilliant and mind-blowing book. Orwell was arguably the greatest <em>psychologist </em>of totalitarianism who ever lived. The words and phrases we get from “Nineteen Eighty-Four” that became famous (Big Brother, thoughtcrime, doublethink) remain more relevant than ever, and just as heady to ponder as they were 76 years ago, because what those words speak to isn’t merely the cruelty of life under totalitarianism — it’s the <em>insanity</em> of it, the way that fascist regimes destroy not just freedom but reality. That’s actually the cruelest thing about them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/orwell-22-5/\">Orwell: 2+2 = 5</a>” is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/raoul-peck/\">Raoul Peck</a>’s documentary meditation on Orwell’s writing, and on how his visionary insight applies to the world today. The film’s title piqued my interest, since that famous bit of business from “Nineteen Eighty-Four” — it refers to a torturer insisting to Winston Smith that he admit, <em>in his mind</em>, that 2+2 really does equal 5 — speaks to the essence of Orwell’s great theme, which is the metaphysics of fascism. If you’re willing to believe that 2+2 = 5, then you’ve allowed the state to determine reality to the point that it determines what’s going on inside you. At that point, you truly are owned; or maybe you don’t quite exist. But how does that dynamic work? How does it evolve? And how does it apply to the present day?\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThose are essential questions, but the surprise and, I have to say it, the disappointment of “Orwell: 2+2 = 5” is that the film doesn’t quite answer them. Peck, nine years ago, made the great ruminative documentary <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/i-am-not-your-negro-review-new-york-film-festival-james-baldwin-1201876756/\">“I Am Not Your Negro,”</a> based on the writings of James Baldwin, and that film was suffused with mystery. It was about racism and oppression, but Baldwin was a writer who dissected racism from a perch of perception that wasn’t just moralistic; he opened your mind to the deepest layers of identity. Whereas “2+2 = 5” is a movie that very much leans toward chronicling the brutality and violence of despotic regimes, and is less interested in exploring how they toy with your brain.</p>\n<p>\n\tPeck fills the film with footage of contemporary autocracies and their infamous leaders (Marcos, Pinochet, Putin, Orbán). He also features images of the destruction of war, like the aftermath of the “strategic bombing” of Berlin during World War II — though that feels like a strange one to include, since it raises ethical questions about war crimes along the lines of what was explored in “The Fog of War,” but that all seems very separate from Orwell (plus, the world <em>was</em> fighting fascism during WWII).</p>\n<p>\n\t“Orwell: 2+2 = 5” is in part a portrait of Orwell, and on that score it’s quite compelling. We hear of his experiences as a teenager (when he looked round-faced and a bit smirky in a way that set him apart from his peers), or working for the imperial British state in Burma, which first imbued him with a sense of cosmic injustice. He saw the insidiousness of empire in his own middle-class desire to be a “gentleman,” and that pitiless ability to examine life through the prism of his own flaws is part of what made Orwell such a thrillingly honest writer. The film then traces him, through his diary and letters and other writings, over the last two years of his life, when he was stricken with tuberculosis and he moved from one health facility to the next, all the while finishing the manuscript that would become “Nineteen Eighty-Four.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOrwell’s essays and novels are read on the soundtrack with puckish gravity by Damian Lewis, and as long as we’re hearing the flow of thoughts like “Everything in our age conspires to turn the writer, and every other kind of artist as well, into a minor official, working on themes handed down from above, and never telling what seems to him the whole of the truth,” or “Everyone believes in the atrocities of the enemy and disbelieves in those of his own side, without ever bothering to examine the evidence,” we can luxuriate in his 20-20 wisdom.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut when it comes to the works that made Orwell famous, notably “Nineteen Eighty-Four” and “Animal Farm,” Peck makes the obvious but misguided decision to string together clips of the numerous film versions of them. The reason I think that’s a mistake is that with the possible exception of the 1956 version of “1984,” none of those films are really very good, and they slow the documentary down. (The version made in 1984, with John Hurt looking a lot like Orwell, is particularly drab.) These movies, too, miss the head-trip aspect of totalitarianism, and that’s partly because it’s such a difficult thing to dramatize. It would have helped to have had some critical voices explain Orwell’s insights into how the ultimate purpose of authoritarianism is to rob people of themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film is on more solid ground when it leaps to the present day and deals with the “surveillance capitalists” (there’s a clip of Edward Snowden speaking quite eloquently on the subject), or charts the banning of books, or the rise of orthodox media narratives, or phrases (“peacekeeping operations”) that mean anything but what they say. At this point, we start to touch the meat of the matter: how societies, armed with technology (that Big Brother home television screen was Oceania’s window into your soul), manipulate reality.</p>\n<p>\n\t“2+2 = 5” is didactic in a way that Orwell, I suspect, would have looked a bit askance at. Except for a few shots of China’s President Xi presiding over a military parade, the film’s image of totalitarianism leans far more toward right-wing regimes; to leave out Mao, or Castro, feels like a mistake. Yet the film’s timeliness is still a tonic, given that the spirit of autocracy looks more and more like a virus that now wants to take over the world. The film’s vision of the Trump presidency is scathing, and it puts its finger on one moment — the rationalizations made by George W. Bush to attack Iraq — as a key transitional event into the New Age of American Political Fakery. It was Orwell who got there first, showing us how thoughtcrime arrives not just when dictators lay down the law but when we stop believing we have the right to believe our own eyes.</p>\n</div>",

Further cast includes Blake Harrison (“World on Fire,” “I Hate Suzie Too”), Reda Elazouar (“Sex Education,” “Pirates”), Kerrie Hayes (“The Responder,” “Criminal Record”), Shaniqua Okwok (“The Flatshare,” “It’s a Sin”) and Rob Kazinsky (“Star Trek: Section 31,” “Eastenders”), who all make up the “Les Maigrets,” Maigret’s loyal team of detectives, with Nathalie Armin (“Showtrial S2”, “Juice”) set to play Prosecutor Mathilde Kernavel.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tProduced by Playground, the Golden Globe and BAFTA award-winning production company behind “Wolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light,” this latest Maigret incarnation marks the first English language contemporary television adaptation of Simenon’s novels.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Set in a vividly realised modern Paris, ‘Maigret’ is a thrilling contemporary reimagining of the iconic police detective that hails from a stellar creative team at Playground,” said Lyle Bettson-Barker, senior vice president Australia & New Zealand for Banijay Rights, who brokered the ABC deal. “We are pleased to deliver this prestigious crime thriller to viewers worldwide.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAdded David Stern, joint managing director at Playground: “Jules Maigret, Georges Simenon’s seminal creation, is a timeless character in the canon of great literary detectives and it’s been an honour to adapt the novels for television. We set out to create a series that embraces the legacy of the novels while introducing the character to a new, global audience and we’re incredibly grateful to our partners at Masterpiece and Banijay Rights.”</p>\n<p>\n\tColin Callender and Stern executive produce “Maigret” for Playground with Patrick Harbinson (“Homeland,” “24, The Tower”) serving as lead writer, executive producer on behalf of Windhover Films, and director of the first two episodes of the series with Faye Gilbert (“The Tower,” “The Bay”) directing episodes 3 and 4 and David Evans (“Domina,” “Django”) directing 5 and 6. Susanne Simpson serves as the executive producer on behalf of lead commissioning broadcaster Masterpiece, with Hilary Strong also executive producing on behalf of Georges Simenon Limited. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Maigret” is one of several scripted shows on Banijay Entertainment’s MIPCOM slate this year. Others include “Half Man” created by and starring Emmy-award winning Richard Gadd and produced by Mam Tor Productions (a Banijay UK company) for the BBC, BBC Scotland and HBO, and “A Woman of Substance,” based on Barbara Taylor Bradford’s best-selling novel and produced by The Forge Entertainment (A Banijay UK company) for Channel 4.

Acosta, head of The Mediapro Studio U.S. & Canada. </p>\n<p>\n\t“We are thrilled to partner with Telemundo, a trusted leader in Spanish-language media, to create groundbreaking content that resonates deeply with Hispanic audiences in the U.S. and beyond.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Telemundo Studios, the pact builds on its core mandate of expanding Latino representation on screen. “Together, we will create content that amplifies and reflects Latino voices, while continuing to set new standards for top level production in the industry,” said Javier Pons, chief content officer and head of Telemundo Studios.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe deal aligns The Mediapro’s track record of global hits such as ‘The Head,’ “Iosi, the Regretful Spy” “Las Bravas” Season 2, “Consuelo” Season 2, “Intercambiadas” and breakout Mexican movie “Mesa de regalos,” with Telemundo’s own decades-long production expertise and its reach across broadcast, pay TV and streaming platforms. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tComing together, both companies are positioning themselves to capture a fast-growing demographic that represents a vital part of the U.S. media landscape.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe partnership will launch with a slate of projects already in development, with further announcements expected in the coming months.</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond features, the deal also signals opportunities for cross-platform storytelling that can travel across borders and formats.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs competition for Hispanic audiences intensifies among streamers and networks, the Mediapro-Telemundo alliance reflects a broader industry trend: Major players doubling down on culturally resonant content designed not only for Latino viewers in the U.S. but for global markets hungry for diverse stories.</p>\n</div>",

In addition, ACAU manages the Uruguayan Audiovisual Program (PUA), a cash rebate fund offering $12 million in reimbursements for co-productions and international production services. These financial tools, among others, have directly supported the 2026 Uruguayan releases showcased at Iberseries.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>A Drill-Down on the Upcoming Slate:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>DOCUMENTARIES</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Unforgettable Montevideo”</strong> (Montevideo inolvidable,” Alfredo Ghierra, 2025, Estudio 2 de Mayo) Uruguay/Panama</p>\n<p>\n\tA hybrid documentary from renowned visual artist Alfredo Ghierra that reimagines Montevideo’s architectural identity through a cultural and emotional lens. Positioned at the intersection of urban exploration and personal memory\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The Fable of the Turtle and the Flower”</strong> (“La fabula de la tortuga y la flor,” Carolina Campo Lupo, 2025, Monarca Films) Uruguay/Spain<br />A deeply personal and formally inventive co-production between Uruguay and Spain, this documentary blends intimate vérité footage with poetic reflection on terminal illness and enduring friendship.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The Boy Who Dreams”</strong> (“El niño que sueña,” Andrés Varela, 2025, Coral Cine) Uruguay/France<br />A character-driven biographical documentary anchored in the life and work of an acclaimed visual artist who, after surviving a life-altering stroke in 2011, now creates in seclusion in rural France. Directed by Varela (“Benedetti, 60 años con luz” ) shot across two continents, the film combines strong production values with a contemplative narrative.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“An Errant Dream”</strong> (“Un sueño errante,” Sofía Betarte, 2025, Montelona) Uruguay/Brazil<br />Tackling migration, gig work and motherhood through a feminist and cross-border lens, this Uruguayan-Brazilian documentary follows a Cuban immigrant navigating economic uncertainty in Montevideo.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Instinct”</strong> (Andrés Varela, Carlos Morelli, 2026, El Delirio Story House) Uruguay/Germany<br />An inclusive, cross-cultural documentary chronicling the German theater company Thikwa—comprised of neurodiverse artists—as they prepare to premiere a new performance in Uruguay. Shot in Germany and Montevideo, the film examines themes of accessibility, artistic expression and maternal identity.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Uncomfortable Body”</strong> (“Cuerpo incomodo,” Estefanía Martínez, 2026, Región Cinema – Insumisa Films) Uruguay/Spain<br />A first-person, introspective documentary exploring chronic illness and memory through the lens of director Estefanía Martínez, who lives with multiple sclerosis. Shot between Uruguay and Spain, the film aims to engage with embodiment, resilience and identity.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Ponsonbyland”</strong> (Ramiro Cabrera, 2025, Asador Cine) Uruguay/Belgium<br />This documentary explores the role of British diplomat John Ponsonby in the formation of both Uruguay and Belgium as independent nations. Through a historical and comparative lens, the film highlights parallels and contrasts in the two countries’ paths to statehood—while also examining how those founding moments echo in the present-day identity struggles of their citizens.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Hitlerland”</strong> (Ana Tipa, 2026, Huerfanita Films) Uruguay/Argentina<br />A provocative and darkly ironic documentary that explores the identity of Hitler Da Silva, a man whose name shaped his childhood and his social experiences. Anchored in Ana Tipa’s observational lens, the film uses a singular case to reflect on stigma, naming and destiny within Latin American contexts.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Into the River”</strong> (“Rio adentro,” Pablo Martínez Pessi, 2026, Gabinete Films) Uruguay/Argentina<br />This observational documentary follows Lucas, a fisherman and photographer, as he embarks on a personal and artistic journey into the riverside forests of Uruguay and Argentina. Intimately shot and shaped by a slow cinema aesthetic, the film documents a vanishing way of life and a personal coming-of-age as an artist.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The Black Box”</strong> (“La caja negra,” Elisa Barbosa Riva, 2025, Montelona) Uruguay/Colombia<br />Blending investigative research with poetic inquiry, this Uruguay-Colombia co-production revisits the hijacking of Avianca Flight HK 1022 in 1969 and the enigmatic figure at its center: a man who vanished into Cuban cultural history.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>FICTION FEATURE FILMS</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Keep Coming Back”</strong> (“Siempre vuelven,” Sergio De León, 2025, Cordón Films) Uruguay/Argentina<br />A moody, genre-tinged coming-of-age story about Emilio, a teenager navigating grief, sexuality and an inherited curse. With elements of magical realism and a strong visual concept.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Chinese Burn”</strong> (“Quemadura China,” Verónica Perrotta, 2025, Verónica Perrotta) Uruguay/Brazil<br />Blurring the line between reality and fiction, this surreal chamber piece centers on Siamese twins facing surgical separation, and a brother who wants to join them. The film deconstructs physical identity, familial bonds and the performative nature of gender and desire – all while its central location teeters on collapse.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The 7 Bullets”</strong> (“Las 7 balas,” Sebastián Pérez Pérez, 2026, McGuffin) Uruguay<br />Structured as a multi-perspective thriller, “The 7 Bullets” reconstructs the events of a chaotic bar attack in Montevideo, drawing connections between random violence, media sensationalism and latent political tensions.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The Other Lara”</strong> (“El robo de Lara,” Juan Manuel Solé, 2026, Region Cinema) Uruguay<br />A bold cross-media narrative that spans a feature film and an interactive video game, The Other Lara” follows a photographer and cosplayer whose identity is stolen in the digital world. As fiction and technology intersect, the project opens new terrain for narrative experimentation and audience engagement.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Dogs”</strong> (“Perros,” Gerardo Minutti, 2025, Cinevinay – Cimarrón Cine) Uruguay/Argentina<br />A darkly comedic social satire in which two neighboring families spiral into conflict over a missing dog. With sharp writing and an escalating sense of absurdity, “Dogs” offers a microcosmic look at class tensions, resentment and human pettiness. Produced by Sandino Saravia Vinay, whose production credits take in “Roma,” “The Blue Trail” and “Birds of Passage,” and Latin-American <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/the-mediapro-studio-cimarron-colombia-jaime-camil-1236535191/\">production-services powerhouse Cimarrón</a> (“The Ravaging Wind”).</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“A Loose End”</strong> (“Un cabo suelto,” Daniel Hendler, 2026, Cordón Films) Uruguay/Argentina<br />Santiago, a low-ranking Argentine police officer, crosses into Uruguay on the run from his own force. Armed only with his uniform and wit, he drifts from roadside food stalls to rural hideouts, surviving by charm and instinct. With elements of social realism and light absurdism, the film balances comedy and drama as Santiago attempts to reassemble his life. An identity dramedy from Hendler, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/daniel-burman-daniel-hendler-flow-the-mediapro-studio-1236525717/\">fast emerging as a director</a>, premiered in Venice and took a special mention at San Sebastian’s Horizontes Latinos last month.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>John Hopewell contributed to this article.</em></p>\n</div>",

Karun</a>, and recent commercial successes that blend art-house sensibilities with mainstream appeal.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe initiative represents an evolution of the Kerala Film Market, which launched in 2023 as a knowledge-sharing forum featuring panels and masterclasses. Over two editions, the platform organically grew into a networking space where projects were pitched and cross-border collaborations formed. The original concept was developed by Karun, director of Cannes selections “Piravi,” “Swaham” and “Vanaprastham,” and former KSFDC chair.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The International Film Market of Kerala marks a significant leap forward in our state’s cinematic journey,” said K. Madhu, veteran filmmaker and KSFDC chair. “IFMK will offer just that — a space where ideas meet opportunity, and where film professionals can engage with the global market on equal footing.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIFMK is designed as an integral component of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/international-film-festival-of-kerala/\">International Film Festival of Kerala</a>, one of India’s most artistically respected festivals. While IFFK celebrates cinema as a cultural force, IFMK adds a business dimension focused on co-production infrastructure, financing and market access.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“With the launch of IFMK, we are complementing that legacy by creating an industry arm that focuses on outcomes — on financing, distribution, and professional partnerships,” said Premkumar, actor and chairman of the Kerala State Chalachitra Academy, which is partnering on the initiative.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe market will feature several key components: a Project Market for pitching to producers, distributors and festivals; a Fine Cut Lab offering post-production mentorship from international advisors; Industry Talks on production trends and technology; a Video Library for films seeking distribution or festival exposure; and exhibition space for film commissions and service providers.</p>\n<p>\n\tLeena Khobragade, former director of Film Bazaar, south Asia’s largest project market, serves as consultant, bringing international industry expertise to the venture.</p>\n<p>\n\t“With IFMK, we are creating more than an event — we’re building infrastructure for long-term industry growth,” said Priyadarsanan P.S., KSFDC managing director. “This platform will help talents access global networks, find the right partners, and compete confidently in international markets.”</p>\n</div>",

Raised by an evangelical mother that he obsessed over and having desecrated human cadavers to make a skin suit, Gein and his story are rife with disturbing, unprecedented psychological drama.</p>\n<p>\n\tGein redefined how Americans thought of serial killers and psychopaths, and his case inspired movies such as “Psycho,” “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” and “Silence of the Lambs.” Now, Ryan Murphy brings the original story to life in his signature, dramatized manner.</p>\n<p>\n\tHere is a look at all of the characters, each based off of real-life people, in “Monster’s”‘ most unnerving season yet.</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Ed Gein (Charlie Hunnam)</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Monster__The_Ed_Gein_Story_n_S1_E2_00_28_45_12R_736cb5.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Monster: The Ed Gein Story.

Dubbed the Butcher of Plainfield, Ed Gein notoriously exhumed bodies from cemeteries near the Wisconsin town in the 1950s and eventually confessed to having killed two people. It’s suspected that he was tied to additional morbid crimes, which the show unpacks in excruciating detail. His unsettling roots, shocking violence, and notorious case redefined the image of the American serial killer and psychopath. Gein died in custody in 1984, but his brutal legacy continues in the form of unsolved cases, numerous horror films and ceaseless nightmares. Hunnam’s other notable credits include “Pacific Rim,” “The Lost City of Z,” and “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.”</p></article>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Augusta Gein (Laurie Metcalf)</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Monster__The_Ed_Gein_Story_n_S1_E4_00_24_58_05R.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Monster: The Ed Gein Story.

Augusta Gein, the woman who birthed and raised Ed, was a religious zealot who brought up her sons with a fear of God and a firm belief that the world was an immoral, sinful place. She raised her boys on their family farm in relative isolation. Ed developed an obsession with Augusta, which only deepened after his father and brother died and he was left to care for her alone. Augusta died in 1945.

The director died in 2017.</p></article>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Dr. Mildred Newman (Mimi Kennedy)</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mimi.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mimi.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mimi.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mimi.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mimi.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mimi.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mimi.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mimi.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" />\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\tDr. Mildred Newman was a psychologist who ushered in the self-help book genre with the publication of her and her husband’s “How to Be Your Own Best Friend” in 1971. She saw a number of celebrities as patients, including “Psycho” star Anthony Perkins, who she infamously performed electroshock therapy on to try ridding him of his homosexuality.

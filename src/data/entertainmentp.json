    "body": "\n\tDuring a recent sit-down with NPR, Guillermo del Toro asserted that he would “rather die” than use artificial intelligence, “particularly generative AI,” in any of his future films. He compared the growing cultural fascination surrounding the controversial tech to the “arrogance” displayed by the titular literary madman in his Netflix adaptation of “Frankenstein.”\n\n\t“AI, particularly generative AI — I am not interested, nor will I ever be interested,” del Toro said. “I’m 61, and I hope to be able to remain uninterested in using it at all until I croak. … The other day, somebody wrote me an email, said, ‘What is your stance on AI?’ And my answer was very short. I said, ‘I’d rather die.'”\n\t\n\n\tThe “Pan’s Labyrinth” director explained that the true dangers aren’t with the technology itself, but with “natural stupidity,” which could drive the mishandling of AI. He added that “natural stupidity” is what pushes “most of the world’s worst features.” He went on to connect the character of Victor Frankenstein to those at the forefront of AI development.\n\n\t“I did want it to have the arrogance of Victor [Frankenstein] be similar in some ways to the tech bros,” he said. “He’s kind of blind, creating something without considering the consequences and I think we have to take a pause and consider where we’re going.”\n\n\tDel Toro’s “Frankenstein,” adapted from Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel of the same name, stars Jacob Elordi, Oscar Issac, Mia Goth, Christoph Waltz and Ralph Ineson. The film comes to Netflix on Nov. 7.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJune Lockhart, a popular actress of the 1950s and ’60s known for her roles in “Lost In Space,” “Lassie” and “Meet Me in St. Louis,” died of natural causes on Oct. 23 in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 100.\n\n\tLockhart became known for her performances as Timmy’s foster mother, Ruth Martin, on the CBS series “Lassie” from 1958 to 1964. She took over from Cloris Leachman as the Martin family moved on to the famous collie’s farm and became foster parents to both the orphaned Timmy and Lassie.\n\t\n\n\tShe then starred as Dr. Maureen Robinson on the CBS series “Lost in Space” from 1965 to 1968. She played a brilliant biochemist and loving mother of three who is marooned in space along with her family. \n\n\n\t“When I wasn’t shooting Lassie, I became the mistress of Scrabble with my hairdresser and the crew,” she told Closer magazine in 2024. She also noted that “Lost in Space” was her favorite project. “It was so campy,” she said, “And I truly enjoyed my relationship with my space family.”\n\n\tOver nearly eight decades on screen, Lockhart went on to appear in dozens of series and movies well into her 80s, with recurring roles on “Petticoat Junction,” “General Hospital” “Beverly Hills 90210,” and guest appearances on shows from “The Beverly Hillbillies” to “Happy Days” to “Full House, “Roseanne” and “Gray’s Anatomy.”\n\n\tThe daughter of actor Gene Lockhart and actress Kathleen Lockhart, she was born in New York City in 1925. She made her feature film debut at 13 years old, starring alongside both of her parents in Edwin L. Marin’s 1939 “A Christmas Carol,” where she played Belinda Cratchit. After her breakout role, she appeared in films such as “All This, and Heaven Too,” “Meet Me in St. Louis,” “The Yearling,” and “Sergeant York.”\n\t\n\n\tPrior to the TV series, Lockhart appeared in the feature “Son of Lassie” as Priscilla, the Duke of Rudling’s granddaughter. In the 1950s, Lockhart guest-starred in several Western series such as “Wagon Train,” “Cimarron City,” “Gunsmoke,” “Have Gun – Will Travel,” and “Rawhide.” \n\n\tShe was nominated for two Emmys, including Best Actress in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Series for her performance in “Lassie.” She also received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for motion pictures and one for television. Lockhart was previously the recipient of a Special Tony Award for Outstanding Performance by a Newcomer for her role on Broadway in “For Love or Money” in 1948.\n\n\tA private service has been planned in her honor. Instead of sending flowers, Lockhart’s family suggests donating to The Actors Fund, ProPublica and International Hearing Dog, Inc. \n",

    "body": "\n\tKamala Harris gave her first exclusive UK interview on the BBC‘s “Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.” During the conversation with the titular host, she talked about the present and future states of American politics and her role within them.  The former Vice President and Presidential candidate says, “I am not done. I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it’s in my bones.”\n\n\tHarris, who served as a California Senator and District Attorney before becoming the 49th Vice President under Joe Biden from 2021 to 2025, has worked in politics for several decades. As the Democratic Party’s nominee for the 2024 Presidential election, she went toe-to-toe with Republican nominee Donald Trump, warning voters about his potential dangers throughout her campaign.\n\t\n\n\tThough Harris lost the election to Trump, she stands by her rhetoric. “I was asked if he was a fascist, and I said ‘yes,’ the reason is I look at what is happening right now,” Harris says, “It is what I predicted. He said he would weaponize the Department of Justice and he has done exactly that.”\n\n\n\tShe calls the U.S. President a “tyrant,” citing, “how he has weaponized, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists.” She also noted how the FCC went after Disney in the wake of Jimmy Kimmel’s remarks following Charlie Kirk’s assassination. “His skin is so thin, he couldn’t endure criticism from a joke, and attempted to shut down an entire media organization in the process,” she says.\n\n\tHarris was the U.S.’s first female Vice President and if elected, would have been the first female President. She says that her grandnieces would “in their lifetime for sure” see a female president. When asked if it would be her, she said, “possibly,” suggesting another potential run for the top office, though she has not officially committed to that decision.\n\t\n\n\tSome polls currently place Harris as an outside to win a place on the Democratic ticket in 2028. Harris brushes them off, though, stating, “I’ve never listened to polls. If I listened to polls, I would not have run for my first office, or my second office, and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here.”\n\n\tThe full interview will air on Sunday at 9 a.m. on the BBC.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs Disney+ develops “Hocus Pocus 3,” Thora Birch, who played young Dani Dennison in the original 1993 film, says she’s willing to reprise the role.\n\n\tDuring an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the actress responded to questions about Dani’s return in the third installment, saying “Yeah, I’d like to know what they land on for how Dani wound up. I’m super open to the idea.”\n\n\tBirch was 11 years old when Disney released the first “Hocus Pocus.” She played the youngest member of the central Dennison family alongside her on-screen siblings, played by Omri Katz and Vinessa Shaw. Though the film failed to excel at the box office upon release, it has since garnered a strong following.\n\t\n\n\t“It was so devastating when it first came out. It was such a bomb and we were all bummed because we loved making it,” Birch reflects, “We were like, ‘What, you don’t like it?’ and then ten years later they’re like ‘Oh my God, are you that girl from ‘Hocus Pocus.'”\n\n\tThe film received the legacy sequel treatment with the release of Disney+’s ‘Hocus Pocus 2‘ in 2022. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy reprised their roles as the central antagonists from the first film, but the original Dennison family ensemble was left out of the sequel. The film was a smash hit for the streamer, accumulating 2.7 billion minutes watched during its opening weekend.\n\n\tPerhaps they will have a chance to return in the threequel. Though Birch expressed interest in the idea, she concedes that the prospect is open-ended, stating, “They like talking about this stuff, so we’ll see.”\n\t\n\n\tBirch may be getting the call back to Salem sooner than she thinks. Midler recently shared during an appearance on “Watch What Happens Live” that she read an early draft of the script and thought it was “brilliant.” \n\n\t“Well, you know, they sent a script, and a lot of it was brilliant,” she said. “So I got very excited, and now we’re trying to figure out what it is and where it’s going to be and how much it’s going to cost and all those logistical things.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn comedy, few are as influential — and elusive — as Jim Downey.\n\n\tDuring his 30-year tenure as a writer on “Saturday Night Live,” he penned era-defining sketches like Chris Farley’s “Chippendales Audition” and defined the show’s political satire with Dana Carvey’s George H.W. Bush (“na ga da it”) and Will Ferrell’s W. Bush (“strategery”). \n\n\tFor many years he was the voice of “Weekend Update,” launching with Norm Macdonald a comedic crusade against O.J. Simpson that resulted in both of them getting fired by NBC. (Downey returned two years later and eventually retired in 2013.) Lorne Michaels has called him the “voice” of “Saturday Night Live” and the “best political humorist alive.”\n\t\n\n\tOutside of occasional appearances on “SNL” and a memorable role opposite Adam Sandler in “Billy Madison,” Downey has remained mostly behind the scenes, rarely granting interviews. Until now.\n\n\tThis year, Downey stepped into the spotlight as the subject of the Peacock documentary “Downey Wrote That,” in which people like Conan O’Brien, John Mulaney and Bill Hader praise him as one of the greatest comedians of all time. And Downey also had two acting roles, playing a jolly member of the Christmas Adventurers Club in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” and a bubble-blowing middle manager in Tim Robinson’s HBO series “The Chair Company.”In a phone interview with Variety, while Downey is on vacation in Bermuda, he’s joyously long-winded and generous with his time. When I suggest a word-association game, instructing Downey to provide just one- or two-word answers, he can’t help himself, gushing for minutes on end about his friends and collaborators. While our conversation was initially slotted for 20 minutes, it runs over an hour, with Downey thwarting multiple attempts to set him free. “Go ahead, I’ll take all the questions you have,” he says when I try to wrap at the 45-minute mark. And, 20 minutes later, when I thank him for “going long,” he corrects me: “No, this has not been a long interview. Keep going.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou famously shared an office at “SNL” with Bill Murray. Is there something about the lack of sleep and personal space that breeds comedic creativity?\t\n\n\tI do think it breaks down some barriers. It makes it easier to try something you might be afraid to work up in private and hand in to somebody. The way I write is I work it out on my feet — talking it down, pitching it to people, and changing it as I go. By the time I write a script, it’s really just a record of something that’s already been worked out. I don’t find it on paper; I find it in conversation. The lack of sleep definitely affected the writing and performing in all kinds of ways. It made the whole thing feel more heroic.\n\t\n\t\tYou say in the documentary that you were once the youngest writer on “SNL” and once the oldest. What was the biggest change in the show between those years?\t\n\n\tIn the beginning, almost everything we did — whether it was truly new or not — felt new. It was like walking into a virgin forest and cutting down 200-foot trees. There was so much uncharted territory. But 40 or 45 years later, a lot of that ground has been covered. That’s one of the reasons I have so much respect for the last group I knew well — Bill Hader, Jason Sudeikis, Maya Rudolph, Kristen Wiig, Amy Poehler, Will Forte, Kenan Thompson and that whole crew.\n\n\tComedy had evolved by their time. They could do certain things we couldn’t have done in the ’70s or ’80s, simply because audiences were more innocent back then. There were sketches we did in those early years that wouldn’t even make it out of a read-through today. Sensibilities have changed — tightened, in some ways. You can say audiences have become too politically correct or too sensitive, but arguing about it doesn’t really help. What matters is not just what people find funny, but what they’re comfortable being seen laughing at. In a live audience, that’s a big factor.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJim Downey in “Downey Wrote That”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRalph Bavaro/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou helped put together the “In Memoriam” segment on “SNL50,” which honored the characters and sketches that haven’t aged well.\t\n\n\tIt started as a tribute to the writers and performers we’d lost, but it became something else. It became about all the material we could no longer do. Things that had to be retired forever. Some of it was borderline offensive, but in a comedy-offensive way. And some of it — well, it just wouldn’t work anymore, because it would genuinely upset people. So in a strange way, I think we actually had a little more artistic freedom in the ’70s and ’80s. Maybe less conceptual freedom, but more freedom to take risks. Comedy keeps evolving, though — hopefully expanding, getting smarter, reaching new places.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat was it like coming back for “SNL50”?\t\n\n\tI spent most of my time working with Bill Murray on something for the Radio City Music Hall show, which was on Friday. The anniversary show was Sunday. Coming back after all that time was strange. I’d retired in 2013, so it had been 12 years since I’d been in that kind of setting. To be honest, it was a little frustrating. The Radio City work took up so much of the weekend that I missed seeing some old friends. I caught up with a few people but completely missed others. The big after-party went on all night. There were something like 1,100 people there. And it actually left me kind of sad and emotional. I realized there’s never going to be another one of those, and for some people I saw, that was probably the last time I will see them. So it wasn’t quite the pure fun I’d hoped it would be.\n\t\n\t\tFrom a viewer’s perspective, it did feel like a culmination, even though the show is, of course, continuing.\t\n\n\tIt’s funny you say that. The feeling I had at the 50th anniversary was very similar to the feeling I had in May of 1980 [when most of the cast and crew, including Lorne Michaels, left “SNL”]. We thought of that as the last season. I remember being very emotional.\n\t\n\t\tI’d like to play a word association game, if you’re up for it. I’ll give you a name, and you say the first thing that comes to mind.\t\n\n\tOK.\n\t\n\t\tAdam Sandler.\t\n\n\tThis isn’t a word, but he was our version of Jerry Lewis. He was wild and unpredictable, not to everyone’s taste, but an incredible combination of real brilliance and occasional goofy, low-brow-ness. \n\t\n\t\tNorm Macdonald.\t\n\n\tThe person whose sense of humor was closest to my own. Incredibly principled and fearless. He did like to make people laugh — he lived for that — but he had really high standards about ways of getting to that.\n\t\n\t\tDavid Letterman.\t\n\n\tHe was willing to do things that he knew wouldn’t get huge laughs, but he loved them. I always think about how much he paid attention to language. He had this very Midwestern fondness for odd turns of phrase. [When I was head writer on “Late Night,”] we once did a bit where we had this weeklong project upgrading his desk, adding little features. The NBC crew guy was there with a power drill, and Dave said, “My dream is for ‘Late Night’ to get its own three-speed drill — and someday, God willing, a variable-speed drill.” I remember thinking, nobody in the history of comedy is ever going to get a laugh out of “variable-speed drill.” But that’s what I loved about Letterman. It was about the language. And he was the king of dry.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLorne Michaels.\t\n\n\tIndispensable. He protected and encouraged writers and performers, but, importantly, he didn’t protect the performers more than the writers. Nobody protected writers like this guy. He’d go to bat for us when the network tried to screw us. Lorne fought for us, and he had the clout to actually solve problems. He was brilliant at negotiating with the network. He was very smooth—I don’t want to say “slick,” but he could be extremely charming.\n\n\tThe only time he ever really ran into trouble was during the [NBC executive] Don Ohlmeyer years. Ohlmeyer’s secret weapon was that he didn’t get Lorne’s jokes. The kind of things that had always worked for Lorne — his wit, his charm — just didn’t land. Most network executives are at least somewhat sophisticated and have a decent sense of humor. Ohlmeyer wasn’t. He was kind of a thug, immune to Lorne’s charm.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLorne Michaels and Jim Downey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNBC via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat will happen to “SNL” after Lorne retires?\t\n\n\tIf Lorne ever leaves the show, I can’t imagine anyone replacing him. I haven’t met a person who could do everything he does. There are people who might have the comedic stature to keep the network and the critics at bay, but no one who can do it all. He’s indispensable.\n\t\n\t\tTina Fey and Seth Meyers are the names that get brought up.\t\n\n\tThose are the two I was thinking of. I just worry that no one has the mystique Lorne has. They maybe have their own kind of mystique, but it’d be rough. I think it was Gilbert Gottfried who once said “SNL” is beyond good or bad, that it’s a restaurant in a good location. But people need to remember that Lorne made it a good location. It was a shitty location — a derelict neighborhood, metaphorically speaking. In the 1970s, there was nothing. They were showing Johnny Carson repeats or something. No one watched television on Saturday night, much less at that time. Half the country was in bed by the time our show came on — probably more than half. And yet, within a year, people were interrupting parties saying, “Hey everybody, it’s 11:30!” and everyone would crowd around the TV. That had never happened before. I’m sure it stopped happening a long time ago, but at the time it was extraordinary.\n\n\tIn the ’70s, brunch was a big thing. After the show, we’d have an after-party, and sometimes an after-after party. We’d get home around 5 a.m., wake up around noon, and crawl out to some restaurant for an omelet and a Bloody Mary. If you went to the bathroom and walked past the other tables, you’d hear people reciting sketches from the night before. Sometimes you’d want to correct them and say, “Excuse me, it was Land Shark, not…” whatever it was. I wish I’d been older, more experienced, to appreciate it fully. It’s a very heady thing to have as your first grown-up job.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou finally left “SNL” in 2013, two years before the rise of Donald Trump as a major political figure. Were you sitting on the sidelines saying, “Put me in coach!”?\t\n\n\tHe was already a comic figure to us 30 years before he announced for president. I remember writing a Trump piece in 1984 or ’85, and then another one around ’87 that was a kind of “Gift of the Magi” sketch. In it, Donald and Ivana Trump had given each other these profane, tasteless gifts — Trump bought the doors of the Sistine Chapel for the garage at Mar-a-Lago, and Ivana had ruined some sacred piece of art for a cheesy decoration. He always seemed like this beat-up, ridiculous character. I never had a great, fresh take on him.\n\n\tI do think it’s important to make fun of people, but to try to keep your own animus out of it — not out of fairness or respect for the MAGA audience, but because anger just makes the comedy less funny. Stridency makes it harder for me. Maybe others would disagree, but I was sick of him before he even ran for president. If I were still there, having to deal with him every week, I’d go crazy. I love James Austin Johnson’s impression. The way he plays Trump, with these insane mind excursions and wandering all over the place — is exactly right, and those pieces are really well written.\n\n\tEvery once in a while, I’ll have an idea. I don’t try to think of them, but something may pop into my head while I’m driving, and some of those ideas are so perishable they’d only work that week. Sometimes I’ll call into “SNL” and say, “Hey, I’ve got something if you want it.”\n\t\n\t\tDo you have an example?\t\n\n\tDuring his first term, Trump kept bragging about having the lowest Black unemployment rate in U.S. history, and I gave Michael Che an “Update” joke that went, “I’m pretty sure during slavery times it was zero.”\n\t\n\t\tIs there a politician you wish you could have satirized more?\t\n\n\tI really wanted to write Al Gore for eight years. I thought he was such a strange, interesting character, and a fun person for Darrell Hammond to play. A lot of my friends said, “Oh, you lucked out — Bush is going to be so much easier to write than Gore.” And I totally disagreed. I thought Gore would’ve been much more fun. Bush fit too easily into that “dumb hick” stereotype, and that’s mostly how he was portrayed. Gore, to me, was weirder, more nuanced, and more interesting.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve often described your political comedy as apolitical. What do you make of the Trump administration attempting to infuse comedy into their rhetoric? The DHS recently quoted your monologue from “Billy Madison” in a social media post defending ICE.\t\n\n\tIt’s shockingly informal. I don’t quite know what to make of it. I guess there’s nothing I can do about it legally. Trump’s tweets are just kind of semi-literate, but Vance can actually bite. I want the government to have a sense of decorum. You can be funny and dignified, but that was… I was shocked.\n\t\n\t\tWhat is your take on breaking? It seems to be more embraced these days at “SNL” than in the past.\t\n\n\tI was never a fan. You have to earn the right to break. And you earn it by having a long track record of committing to the material, playing it straight, and not breaking. Then, every once in a while, you’re allowed. I never objected when John Mulaney would give Bill Hader Stefon jokes he’d never seen before on-air, and Hader would fight like hell not to break. That, to me, is fine. Phil Hartman, for instance, may have been in more sketches than any cast member in history, and he broke exactly once, in a piece Jack Handey and I wrote. The set started to collapse around him. All hell broke loose. Everyone else in the cast was breaking, and Phil held out for as long as he could, but eventually he lost it. Then you had guys like Horatio Sanz, who I don’t recall ever not breaking. It always seemed cheap to me. \n\n\tNorm hated it. He thought it was an easy laugh. He used to say comedy is like Russian slaw: the cheap stuff can drive the good stuff out of circulation, because it’s easier to make. He used to say his least favorite audience members were the ones who laughed and said, “Oh, that’s cute.” It’s too cute. Too cloying. So, put me down as a hard no on breaking.\n\t\n\t\tYour Jeffrey Epstein bit on Conan O’Brien’s podcast became an internet phenomenon. Was that spontaneous, or was Conan aware you were going to do that bit on the show?\t\n\n\tNo, it unfolded in a completely organic way, moment to moment. The night before I did the show, I was talking to Paula Davis, one of Conan’s producers, and she said to me, “You just need to have an ‘I am blank to be Conan’s friend’ thing ready.” I called her back and said, “Has anyone done “I am entirely unashamed”? Then, driving over to the studio, I realized I needed to think of something to justify it — it was kind of a tail-wagging-the-dog situation. I don’t think I told them I was going to say “Jeffrey Epstein,” but I didn’t really know what I was going to do beyond that.\n\t\n\n\tThere were also things we talked about but never got to, which is why I’m supposed to go back and do Conan’s podcast again, probably in the next couple of months. We were going to talk about Norm Macdonald — that was something we never got to. We spent so much time on the Epstein stuff. We might even return to Epstein, just for fun. It was wild, though, the way that bit had legs.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou played a member of an exclusive white supremacist group in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another.” When reading the script, did you anticipate how funny the film would play on screen? \t\n\n\tI thought that character was funny, but I also wanted to play it straight. On set, Paul doesn’t rehearse a lot with the actors. He tends to trust you, like, “You know what I want, right?” Then he’ll fine-tune it. We ran through it a few times, and he asked me to try a few different things, but basically, I just wanted to make him happy. I’m a huge fan of Paul and his work, so my attitude was: as long as you’re sure I’m not going to ruin your movie, I’m thrilled to be here. I’ll give you whatever I’m capable of giving.\n\t\n\t\tDid you improvise at all?\t\n\n\tWe all played around. “Semon demon” was in the script. Some of the other lines Paul said we could take in different directions. But, no, I wasn’t out there winging it. I’ve written for other people for so many years, and I know how much it means when a performer really tries to do something the way you wrote it — the way you intended and imagined it. There’s always room for surprise, but I don’t have any ego about being a performer. I just go, “Here’s what you like,” and when I’d see Paul smiling behind the camera, I figured I was doing it right.\n\t\n\t\tAside from calling into “SNL” every once in a while, what do you do with your ideas? Are you writing something? Are you trying to act more?\t\n\n\tI have outside interests, personal things. What a lot people like me do now is send goofy emails or texts to old friends, often other writers. I’m constantly texting back and forth with George Meyer, who wrote for “The Simpsons” and worked with me at “Letterman” 45 years ago. Jack Handey, another great writer, and I have had this running joke for more than 40 years where we write each other emails or call each other as attorneys threatening to sue one another. It involves this mix of performance and writing — we create these fake legal documents and send them back and forth. It actually takes up a fair amount of time. Sometimes Jack will call, and when I see his name on the caller ID, I won’t pick up because I can’t think of anything to say as my angry attorney character screaming at him. So a lot of my comedy energy gets burned up in those ways.\n\t\n\n\tSomewhere in my texts and old notebooks, there are things I’d like to pursue at some point. I may do a guest writing week at “SNL” again — I could walk in with a couple of sketches I’ve already thought about, just because I’d like to see them done. I think Lorne vaguely doesn’t trust that someone my age could write something that appeals to an 18-year-old audience — and he may well be right. He trusts me if I’m writing something political, because that’s more grown-up stuff anyway. But I still have sketch ideas I’ve always wanted to try.\n\t\n\t\tLike what?\t\n\n\tOne was an instructional video about texting while driving responsibly. It would just be explaining that there’s a right way to text while driving and a wrong way, and we’re here to show you. That’s probably something that would run into standards issues, by the way.\n\t\n\t\tReally?\t\n\n\tYes, because it’s taking a lighthearted approach to a serious problem. Back in the ’70s, our standards battles were more like, “You can’t say ‘pussy,’ it’s a dirty word.” Then later there was one where you couldn’t say “bastard” — not because it was considered a dirty word anymore, but because it might be offensive to children whose parents weren’t married. So the reasoning changed. And now, you’re more likely to run into notes that say, “There’s nothing funny about X.”\n\t\n\t\tBut isn’t that the point of comedy? To find the funny in things that aren’t funny?\t\n\n\tThere’s always a degree-of-difficulty factor in comedy. That was something Norm and I were really in sync about. There are certain things you know are going to get a laugh. You don’t need to be proud of it. It’s like this: if you can get a 13-year-old kid to enjoy sea urchin sashimi, that’s a real fucking achievement. Getting him to like banana cream pie is not. You don’t say, “Did you see that? He ate it right up!” Yeah, of course he did — it’s fucking banana cream pie.\n\n\tOur favorite “Update” jokes made the audience go: “Oh, you fuckers. I disapprove of what you’re doing, but I have to admit it’s funny. I can’t help it.” That’s very different from the reaction: “What you did isn’t really funny, but I agree with your political stance, so I’m going to applaud anyway.” We always preferred the jokes that made people feel a little bad for laughing, not because they were cruel or dirty or juvenile, but because they pushed against comfort a bit. A lot of our O.J. Simpson jokes fell into that category. At a certain point, the relentlessness itself became part of the joke — the fact that we just refused to stop doing them.\n\t\n\n\tI agree that comedy should be challenging. What I hate is pandering. I think most of us do. You still see a little of it on the show sometimes, but for the most part, the show’s done a pretty good job of keeping its standards — trying to do things the right way, not taking shortcuts, not getting too corny, lazy, sappy, or warm and cuddly.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSteven Soderbergh is speaking out about his unmade “Star Wars” movie, “The Hunt For Ben Solo.”\n\n\tAfter would-be star Adam Driver revealed the project in an interview with AP on Monday, the “Ocean’s Eleven” director took to BlueSky to write that he “did not enjoy” hiding the project from fans, but emphasized the importance of keeping it under wraps.\n\n\t“For the record, I did not enjoy lying about the existence of ‘THE HUNT FOR BEN SOLO,’ but it really did need to remain a secret…until now!” Soderbergh wrote on Monday.\n\t\n\n\tOn Friday, he added, “Also, in the aftermath of the ‘HFBS’ situation, I asked Kathy Kennedy if LFL had ever turned in a finished movie script for greenlight to Disney and had it rejected. She said no, this was a first.”\n\n\t“The Hunt for Ben Solo” was set to take place after the events of “The Rise of Skywalker,” and would have followed Driver’s Kylo Ren, aka Ben Solo, on a search for redemption. Driver called the unmade film “one of the coolest” projects he’s ever been a part of.\n\n\tSoderbergh had previously told AP of developing “The Hunt for Ben Solo,” “I really enjoyed making the movie in my head. I’m just sorry the fans won’t get to see it.”\n\n\tOn Friday, Collider reported that a group of “Star Wars” fanatics paid for a plane towing a banner reading “Save ‘The Hunt for Ben Solo’” to fly over Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Calif. A reporter for the outlet was able to take pictures of the stunt while on location.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCzech documentarian Tatana Markova says she became intrigued by her subject in “Kingdom of Soap Bubbles” – a once-great Bohemian dynasty that’s been nearly forgotten – after meeting one of its would-be heirs.\n\n\t“One of the protagonists of my last film, “Libussa Unbound,” was U.S.-based director and producer Constantin Werner. He told me some family stories and I found them so appealing I wanted to find out more about the Schicht family he came from.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tThe Schicht name was once known in every household in what is today the Czech Republic and Slovakia – and considerably beyond. It rose to prominence during the last days of the Habsburg Empire, built around the phenomenal success of entrepreneur Georg Schicht, who founded a soap factory in what is today the town of Rynoltice.\n\n\n\tWith bold innovations such as the sidelines Elida cosmetics and Kalodont toothpaste, the sourcing of coconut and palm oil from Africa, brilliant branding and marketing with a wholesome billboard girl and slick silent film promos, the Schicht brand eventually became synonymous with “easy, cheap and clean” in households far and wide.\n\n\tAnd its signature product, the “soap with the stag,” known for its distinctive leaping deer symbol, was nearly as recognizable in the early 20th century as Apple or Starbucks is today. \n\n\tNowadays, just a shell of the family’s industrial base and their nearby mansion remain in the Czech city of Usti nad Labem – known during the family’s heyday under the Habsburg Empire, as Aussig.\n\t\n\n\tAnd it’s into the darkened halls and corridors of these buildings, stripped nearly bare, that Markova’s camera rolls as her documentary, competing in the Czech Joy section of the Ji.hlava film fest, opens.\n\n\tShe began writing in 2019, just in time for the challenges of COVID lockdowns, says Markova, but she soon faced another difficulty almost as great.\n\n\tShe wanted to film the company heirs venturing into the former family home, she says, but “the descendants of the entrepreneurial Schicht family are spread all over the world and they are quite busy. It is not possible for them to travel to the Czech Republic often.”\n\n\tThere was also much ground to cover: The founding of Czechoslovakia after World War I “wasn’t beneficial to the Schichts,” as the film recounts, dropping them into the middle of a linguistic power struggle in which the German language was no longer to be officially used and many felt resentful of all things not Slavic.\n\n\tThe Schichts managed to survive and thrive, building the company, merging with Unilever, founding a cinema, building international networks and even taking to the skies in airplane races.\n\n\tBut with World War II soon looming, and a company base squarely in the middle of what Nazi Germany would call the Sudetenland, the family was to find itself in an increasingly hazardous world – in fact, as the Third Reich rose, the Schicht company was under pressure to prove itself Aryan – and even to work on components of V1 rockets, says Markova.\n\n\tWas she was not permitted to ask about any of these subjects? “No,” says Markova. “They were very open.”\n\n\tAfter the war, Czech citizens who were ethnic Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia, and their land and assets were seized.\n\n\t“That collective guilt was applied to the whole family,” says Markova. “The Ústí nad Labem property of Georg Schicht was confiscated after World War II, despite the fact that he lived in London, had British citizenship and his sons fought in the British army.\n\n\t“I am using the memories from the diary of Eleonore Schicht and a written recommendation by Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Masaryk in the film to demonstrate this fact.”\n\n\tWith the country soon under Soviet control, successful capitalists such as the Schichts were considered public enemies – and the factory became the state-run enterprise Setuza. What’s more, after the Velvet Revolution of 1989, Czechs who had their property seized by the state were allowed to reclaim much of it through a restitution system – but not ethnic Germans who lost it under the post-war Benes decrees.\n\t\n\n\t“The Benes decrees, which legally expelled Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War II, were never repealed; there was no restitution process for the property of Czech Germans.”\n\n\tThe Schicht family moved into other businesses and investments in London, Zurich and even Brazil after World War II, eventually doing well enough that they were able to buy back the former family home in Usti, which they plan to open to the public, they say.\n\n\tIn this city, at least, they were never forgotten, says Markova, in part because the company was known for its socially conscious local investments, building homes for its workers, a community pool, and more.\n\n\t“In 2006 the so-called ‘Soap King’ Johann Schicht was the winner of a local survey,” Markova says, “for the most important citizen of Aussig in last 150 years, so many people know the name. Outside Ústí nad Labem not so many.”\n\n\t“Johann Schicht (the company director in the generation after founder Georg) was a visionary and a philanthropist. He had a relationship to the place where he had his business, his son Heinrich as well. This is not the case of many contemporary entrepreneurs.”\n\n\t“A once-famous name can fall into oblivion, a big industrial empire can burst like a bubble, but something from the non-material values, such as social responsibility and philanthropy, can be passed down through generations,” Markova says.\n\n\t“It is a nice act of respect for ancestors to buy their villa with the vision to open it to the public.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAnime rides again atop the domestic box office, as “Chainsaw Man — The Movie: Reze Arc” looks to open ahead of fellow new releases, the Bruce Springsteen biopic “Deliver Me From Nowhere” and the Colleen Hoover adaptation “Regretting You.”\n\n\tThe R-rated “Chainsaw Man” went brrr with $8.5 million across Friday and preview screenings from 3,003 locations. The feature, which serves as a big-screen continuation of the manga adaptation’s first season, is headed to an opening bow of $15.5 million. It’s available in both subtitled and dubbed versions, and gets a boost from playing Imax and other premium large format auditoriums, which carry higher ticket prices.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s another win for Sony’s anime label Crunchyroll, which delivered its parent studio’s biggest opening of the year in September with a historic $70.6 million start for “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle.” “Chainsaw Man” will only hit a fraction of that blockbuster figure, but the fact that a new anime release is again leading charts, above two English-language features from traditional Hollywood studios, speaks to how theatrical appetites have shifted over recent years.\n\n\n\tReviews are strong for “Chainsaw Man,” but, more importantly, the audience loves it, as indicated by the “A” grade polled by moviegoer survey firm CinemaScore. Anime is almost always very front-loaded at the box office, with most fans rushing to opening weekend screenings. The bulk of the North American gross will likely come this weekend, but “Chainsaw Man” is already sitting pretty for producer Mappa with $61 million in overseas grosses.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s a tighter race for second place, with “Regretting You” narrowly leading ahead of the sophomore outing of “Black Phone 2.”\n\n\tParamount’s “Regretting You” kicked off with $5.2 million across Friday and previews, including special fan event screenings that featured a live cast Q&A. The Josh Boone-directed, generations-spanning drama, produced by Constantin Films, is now projecting a $13 million opening.\n\n\tThat would come out ahead of tracking, which had forecast a debut between $8 million and $10 million. It’s not the box office force that “It Ends With Us,” the first Colleen Hoover feature adaptation, was in August 2024. That Blake Lively starrer launched to a $24 million opening day and a $50 million debut — against a slim $25 million production budget. “Regretting You” cost $30 million to produce.\n\n\tReviews have been comparatively rough for “Regretting You” too, while CinemaScore turned in a middling “B” grade. (Comp to the “A-” earned by “It Ends With Us.”) The ensemble drama, which is rated PG-13 and stars Mckenna Grace, Mason Thames, Allison Williams, Dave Franco and more, is the first of a wave of Hoover adaptations on the way. “Verity” and “Reminders of Him” remain on the slate from other studios.\n\n\tBowing in fourth on Friday, “Deliver Me From Nowhere,” which stars “The Bear” lead Jeremy Allen White belting out as the Boss, earned $3.5 million across opening day, including preview screenings, from 3,460 locations. It’s looking to land within its pre-weekend projections for a debut between $8 million and $12 million, though it’ll have to show some fight to hit the eight-digit side. The PG-13-rated biopic is also sharing Imax and other PLFs with “Chainsaw Man.”\n\n\tThe comparison for 20th Century Studios’ “Springsteen” is last year’s Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown” — another period piece music drama, which hailed from fellow Disney label Searchlight Pictures. That Timothée Chalamet vehicle debuted with a slightly higher $11.6 million three-day, before riding Oscar buzz through the holidays and the first weeks of January to leg out to $75 million domestic and $140 million globally.\n\n\t“Deliver Me From Nowhere,” directed by Scott Cooper, has similar awards aspirations, after holding film festival premieres attended by Springsteen himself at Telluride, New York and AFI Fest. But reviews have been lukewarm compared to “A Complete Unknown,” and the film won’t have the benefit of playing the holiday season. Audiences do like the movie, with CinemaScore turning in a “B+” grade. But at a considerable production budget of $55 million, “Deliver Me From Nowhere” will have to vie to stay relevant to moviegoers in the weeks ahead.\n\t\n\n\tStill with a chance for second, Universal’s release of “Black Phone 2” added $3.7 million on Friday and is headed to a second weekend of $12 million for a 56% drop from its opening. The horror sequel looks to push its domestic total to $48 million through Sunday, pacing a hair ahead of its 2022 predecessor ($47 million through 10 days). It already ranks as the highest-grossing North American release of the year for Blumhouse — a bounce-back after fielding a slate of theatrical nonstarters earlier in 2025, though “Black Phone 2” is also the most expensive of the lot at a $30 million production budget.\n\n\tDisney’s “Tron: Ares” looks to round out the top five, earning another $1.3 million on Friday to fall 48% from its daily total a week ago. Now in its third weekend of release, the sci-fi revival has dropped off fast in theaters and earned just $59 million in North America — a dismal result for an IP play with an $180 million production budget.\n\n\tAlso opening this weekend, Neon is bowing its horror mystery “Shelby Oaks” in 1,823 locations. The original R-rated feature, which has so-so reviews, earned about $1.1 million across Friday and previews and seems headed for a seventh place bow.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe latest poster for “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” features a painting of Bruce Springsteen in concert, viewed from the side, his index finger held high in the air. If you examine his face, it has been made to look a lot more like Bruce than it does like Jeremy Allen White, the actor who plays him. You can understand why: Jeremy Allen White doesn’t look very much like Springsteen. (There’s a touch of last-minute desperation to that poster.) The lack of an acute resemblance isn’t fatal in a biopic, but it’s one of a number of things about “Deliver Me from Nowhere” that just feel…off.\n\t\n\n\tAnother disarming detail is the aha moment when Bruce first gets the idea for “Nebraska” by catching “Badlands” on TV. In a way, it makes sense — the album’s title track will be told from the point-of-view of Charles Starkweather, the sociopathic killer who’s the antihero of Terrence Malick’s famous film. What’s odd about the scene is that three years before it takes place, back in 1978, Springsteen released “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” an album whose greatest song was … “Badlands.” (It was always clear that title was a nod to the movie.)\n\n\n\tThat said, the pivotal thing that feels off about “Deliver Me from Evil” is “Nebraska” itself. I can’t even talk about this without being accused of blasphemy, because there is such a mystique surrounding that album, in all its lo-fi acoustic demo-with-reverb Dylan-meets-Suicide dark-heart-of-America austerity. No one ever deviates from calling “Nebraska” a “masterpiece” and one of Bruce’s greatest records. The album is one of the dour sacred cows of music criticism, right up there with such landmarks of anhedonia as “White Light/White Heat” and “Unknown Pleasures.” At the time of its release, Greil Marcus, writing about it as if he was adding a chapter to his seminal book “Mystery Train,” called it “the most convincing statement of resistance and refusal that Ronald Reagan’s USA has yet elicited, from any artist or any politician.” Marcus set the template for viewing “Nebraska” as a political album, and that was embodied in its stripped-down aesthetic, its whole Bruce-vs.-the-overblown-music-industry aura.\n\t\n\n\tThere’s just one problem. (Blasphemy alert!) “Nebraska” is an arid art film of an album — poetic to a fault, with a couple of good songs, like the title track and “Atlantic City,” but I’ve always found it to be a piece of dusty folk-rock wallpaper. It you love it, fine, but my point is that whatever claims of greatness are made for the record, they have almost nothing to do with what people have loved about Bruce Sprinsteen for 50 years. His music is deep, and yes it can be dark, but mostly Bruce, as an artist, radiates rock ‘n’ roll joy. And that’s the quality that’s perversely missing from “Deliver Me from Nowhere.”\n\n\tAt home, when I’m making dinner with my daughters, we always play music, and mixed in with the new stuff I like to give them a dose of music history, so I’ll play everything from Nina Simone to Steely Dan to the Clash to ELO to Dylan to the Spinners to the Ramones. But the one time I put on “Nebraska,” we were four tracks into it when Sadie, who is 13, looked at me with a wince of pain and said, “Can we play something else?” She had never said that before, and I was amused to see her reaction directly echoed in the movie by the Columbia Records executive Al Teller (David Krumholtz), who hears a couple of minutes of the record and then says can you please take it off. It’s not just that the album “isn’t commercial.” For many of us, there’s a punishing monotony to “Nebraska.”\n\n\tThe album, in its way, is all about pain, and “Deliver Me from Nowhere” captures how creating the record all by himself in his New Jersey bedroom was therapy for Bruce. That’s a moderately interesting chapter in the larger Bruce saga, and when he actually goes to therapy, the film treats it as cataclysmic — as if millions of us haven’t been there, and as if he was the first rock celebrity who ever walked into a shrink’s office.\n\n\tThe core issue the Bruce of the film is dealing with is the trauma inflicted upon him as a boy by his hard-drinking, abusive, ’50s-macho father (Stephen Graham), who he was desperate to please. “Deliver Me from Nowhere” is supposed to be about the schism in Bruce’s soul, and about how he used the making of “Nebraska” to heal it. But I have another interpretation of what the album means. The myth of greatness that has surrounded “Nebraska” for 43 years, propped up by the music-critic establishment and by Bruce himself (who has said it’s the work of his he feels closest to), is that what matters on the record isn’t so much the music (its bare-bones country vibe, all those goddamn major chords) but the lyrics, which strain at every turn to be badlands poetry. Yet I would suggest that in trying to make a rock album this doggedly artistic and severely high-minded, an album “pure” enough to make Bob Dylan look schmaltzy, Bruce was playing out his demons in a different way. He still had a primal need to please and impress his father, and that’s what “Nebraska” was about. He wanted what this movie gives him: not his due, but a gold star.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKathryn Bigelow’s “A House of Dynamite” is filled with uneasy tension from start to finish as it follows the immediate threat of a nuclear missile headed straight for the United States. That driving tension and anxiety are largely thanks to the team of artisans, which included composer Volker Bertelmann, editor Kirk Baxter and sound designer Paul Ottosson, who worked closely behind the scenes on their respective crafts to bring it together.\n\t\n\n\tBigelow’s film, now streaming on Netflix, is divided into three chapters, telling the story from three different perspectives. It all starts in the White House Crisis Room as Captain Olivia Walker (Rebecca Ferguson) works with Major Daniel Gonzalez (Anthony Ramos) and his team at a military base in Alaska. An incoming missile gives them 20 minutes to react and respond accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEros Hoagland/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOttosson says reading the script was an anxious experience in itself. “As I was reading it, I was really tense, and I was curious to see how it would come together because the structure was different,” he says. Bertelmann knew the score needed development in each chapter. “You need to have some things in your pocket to make the tension higher,” he says. “The opening presents the whole palette of music of what we can expect and what film this will be. You hear those first sounds and know where we are. We are not in a romance. We are in a thriller that will be quite dark in certain areas.” But it took a few attempts at scoring those first moments to get it right. Bertelmann says he worked on shaping the score, pulling back a bit, and then moving into the second chapter.\n\t\n\n\tIn cutting those moments, Baxter used the score to track the temperature of his edit, especially as the second chapter begins. Baxter says, “[Bertelmann’s] score peaks at the end of Chapter One, and you reset. You get these clues that come in with little bits of audio.” He adds that the idea was for audiences to wonder what’s going to happen next. Is it the aftermath of the missile impact? Instead, he says, “Those sprinkles start, and then you’re back in panic mode, and it stays there. It’s the score that tells you quickly that you’re in it.”\n\n\tOttosson’s approach was to look at the sound by each chapter. “In Chapters One and Two, people are confident and educated in doing something. But of course, things go wrong, and I tried to make it more tumultuous because you can’t control the environment.” Chapter Two resets everything back to the start of the day to show more departments. By the third chapter, the focus shifts back to the Oval Office. This time, Idris Elba, who has only been heard via the black box, is revealed. When the day resets for the last time in the film, his sequence brings humanity to the chaos.\n\n\tBaxter says, “In the first chapter, we stayed with Rebecca and made Volker’s music the focus.” By the third chapter, which switches to the President’s point of view, it was about the human experience and “one man’s decision. Silence and Volker’s music are really what make that work so great. Having the chaos in the beginning gives you great appreciation for the delicate human factor in Chapter Three.” \n\n\tThe decision not to reveal him earlier was always the intention. “I leaned into the black square by giving it a bunch of screen time,” says Baxter. “Especially in that second chapter when it’s just sitting and they’re waiting for answers. The shots just hold on it, and it’s just silence. It’s like looking down a well. It builds the anticipation of wanting to meet him and get answers.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe final chapter really dives into the emotional state of mind of the President. He’s the last man left to make the decision. “He also has to deal with human problems, and there are a lot of things not working that make it so emotional,” explains Baxter. While a lot of the story was on the page and scripted by screenwriter Noah Oppenheim, some moments came together in the edit. One example was in that third chapter the President had a phone call with Russia. “It wasn’t written to be on during all of that because we had experienced it previously. On the page, you would go, ‘We don’t need to hear that entire conversation again.’ But in the President’s journey, there’s a joy in re-experiencing it on his face, and it amps up all of the tension of the ‘I need a minute,’ and then you go to Africa.”\n\t\n\n\tSuddenly, there were wide shots of his wife on safari with Ottosson’s sounds of elephants.  He says, “It sort of applies this pressure to that scene, you know, as well as all of humanity, of just wanting to have a connection between people.” \n\n\tThe artisans also had access to a military advisor, Dan Karbler, who was accessible at all times. Says Ottosson who relied on Karbler’s advise says, “It was about staying true to what could happen in these rooms and situations. It was never about a cool sound what they felt about how it sounded. It was ‘What would you feel in this situation and what would that sound like?’”\n",

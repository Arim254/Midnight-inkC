    "body": "\n\tThe “God of War” TV series at Amazon Prime Video has added veteran director Frederick E.O. Toye to its creative team. \n\n\tVariety has confirmed that Toye will direct the first two episodes of the epic video game adaptation, which is currently in preproduction. It is also now confirmed that Amazon has ordered two seasons of the series, with casting underway. \n\n\tAs previously reported, the series will adapt the story of Kratos beginning with the 2018 “God of War” game. The show’s official logline states, “‘God of War’ follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human.” \n\t\n\n\tToye is a highly-accomplished TV director, winning the Emmy for outstanding directing for a drama series for FX’s “Shogun” in 2024. He has also worked on hit shows like “Westworld,” “The Walking Dead,” and “Watchmen.” Toye is also no stranger to Amazon audiences, having helmed episodes of shows like “The Boys,” “Fallout” (another video game adaptation), and both “The Terminal List” and “The Terminal List: Dark Wolf.” \n\n\n\tHe is repped by CAA and Sloane Offer. \n\n\tAmazon’s adaptation of “God of War” has had a long road to the screen already. The show was originally greenlit at the streaming arm of the e-commerce giant back in 2022. Original showrunner Rafe Judkins exited the show in October 2024, with Ronald D. Moore joining as the new showrunner not long after. \n\n\tMore to come…\n",

    "body": "\n\tNew “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “Sonic the Hedgehog” movies will race to theaters in 2028. \n\n\tParamount has added an untitled “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” film to the calendar on Nov. 17, 2028, as well as an untitled “Sonic Universe Event Film” on Dec. 22, 2028. The studio also announced plans to bring “Top Gun” back to the big screen on May 13, 2026, in honor of its 40th anniversary.\n\n\n\tParamount is keeping the details for its “TMNT” and “Sonic” films under wraps. All that’s confirmed is producer Neal H. Moritz, best known as the brains behind the successful “Sonic the Hedgehog” trilogy, is also behind the new “Ninja Turtles” adventure.\n\t\n\n\t“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” will be a family friendly live-action/CG animation hybrid take on the turtle brothers known as Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo. It will be the first live-action “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” since 2016’s theatrical disappointment “Out of the Shadows.” Paramount since turned to animation with 2023’s modestly successful “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,” which was written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. “Mutant Mayhem 2” is set to debut on Sept. 17, 2027.\n\n\n\tThe upcoming “Sonic” entry, based on the Sega video game franchise, is separate from “Sonic the Hedgehog 4,” which is slated for March 19, 2027. “Sonic” has become a valuable property for Paramount, with the first three installments collectively surpassing $1 billion worldwide.\n\n\t“Top Gun,” directed by Tony Scott and starring Tom Cruise, was released in 1986 and became the highest grossing film of that year with $357.4 million. The story follows Lt. Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, a hotshot flier who is competing to become the top fighter pilot. Cruise reprised his role for the 2022 sequel, “Top Gun: Maverick,” which became the biggest film in Paramount’s 113-year history with $1.49 billion.\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount+ has greenlit a new true-crime documentary about Wade Wilson aka the “Deadpool Killer,” who in 2019 was convicted of the murders of Kristine Melton and Diane Ruiz.\n\n\tTitled “Handsome Devil: Charming Killer,” the three-part series is currently in production and will premiere early in 2026. It unravels why the 25-year-old Florida man committed horrific violence — and why his mugshot made him a social media fixation, with legions of people becoming fascinated by his face tattoos and disturbing crimes. Wilson’s trial was televised and picked apart by true-crime obsessives online.\n\t\n\n\tThe docuseries uses police bodycam footage and interviews with people close to the case to tell the story of Wilson, who happens to share the name of a popular Marvel superhero.\n\n\n\tIt’s written by Brian Ross, who also serves as producer and director with Rhonda Schwartz for Law & Crime Productions. Dan Abrams, Rachel Stockman and Melody Shafir are executive producers. For See It Now Studios, Susan Zirinsky and Terence Wrong are executive producers, and Aysu Saliba and Cara Tortora are supervising producers. \n\n\t“‘Handsome Devil’ reveals a dangerous obsession and infatuation with a convicted, brutal killer in the digital age,” said Zirinsky, president of See It Now. “The docuseries explores the intersection between true crime and internet culture, with unnerving and shocking accounts from those who professed their love, as well as those who fought for justice.”\n\n\tRoss added, “The more we dug into this story, the crazier it got.”\n\n\t“Handsome Devil: Charming Killer” joins Paramount+’s slate of true-crime programming. In August, Variety unveiled two of those docuseries: “Thirst Trap: The Fame. The Fantasy. The Fallout,” about a 21-year-old TikToker whose interactions with fans became toxic; and “Don’t Date Brandon,” about a modern relationship haunted by deception.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPalme d’Or-winning filmmaker Jafar Panahi has been sentenced in absentia in Iran to one year in prison and a travel ban, according to his lawyer via the AFP news agency.\n\n\tPanahi’s lawyer, Mostafa Nili, said the sentence includes a two-year travel ban and prohibition of Panahi from membership of any political or social groups. He added that they would file an appeal.\n\n\tThe charges against the filmmaker were that he had engaged in “propaganda activities” against the state, but Nili did not elaborate. \n\t\n\n\tPanahi was recently in the U.S. to promote his Cannes-winning film “It Was Just an Accident,” and is due to attend the Marrakech Film Festival on Thursday, where the film screens. He is a resident of France. The film was selected by France as its submission for the Academy Awards in the international feature film category, and is expected to make the shortlist.\n\n\n\tIn “It Was Just an Accident” five former inmates contemplate whether to exact revenge on a man they believe to be their former jailer.\n\n\tThe director has had frequent run-ins with the Iranian authorities. \n\n\tIn 2010, he was barred from making films and from leaving Iran after supporting anti-government protests and making films critical of the country.\n\n\tHe was later convicted of “propaganda against the system,” and sentenced to six years in jail but served only two months before being released on bail.\n\n\tDespite the ban on filmmaking, he shot the documentary “This Is Not a Film,” which was released in 2011, and “Taxi,” in which Panahi acted as a taxi driver, came out in 2015.\n\n\tIn 2022, he was arrested in connection with protests by a group of filmmakers but was released about seven months later.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEd Weeks is set for one of the lead roles in the CBS comedy pilot “Eternally Yours,” Variety has learned. \n\n\tThe single-camera show was picked up to pilot at the broadcaster in July, while CBS had originally opened a development room for the show in mid 2024. It hails from Joe Port and Joe Wiseman, who developed the hit CBS comedy series “Ghosts.” \n\n\tThe official logline for “Eternally Yours” describes the pilot as, “An eternal love story about two vampires who have been married for five hundred years, and their struggles to accept the human who is dating their daughter.” \n\t\n\n\tWeeks will star as Charles, one half of the vampire couple at the center of the series. The character description states, “Nobility back in the Middle Ages, Charles is now a pencil pusher who, along with his family, has to move every few years to avoid attracting attention to the fact that they never age. Charles disdains modernity and the weak-minded humans who inhabit it, which makes it all the worse when he learns his vampire daughter is now dating one.” \n\n\tWeeks’ best known TV role is his portrayal of Dr. Jeremy Reed on the Fox/Hulu comedy series “The Mindy Project,” on which he starred throughout the show’s six-season run. He also starred in the Fox sitcom “LA to Vegas” and has appeared in shows like “House of Lies,” “Dirty Sexy Funny,” “The IT Crowd,” and “Not Going Out.” He has also been in films such as “The Leisure Class,” “3rd Street Blackout,” and “Drop.” \n\n\tHe is repped by Curate, WME, and Yorn Levine. \n\n\t“Eternally Yours” will film in early 2026. Should it go to series and debut next fall, it would air alongside “Ghosts,” which was renewed through the 2026-2027 broadcast season back in February. \n\t\n\n\tPort and Wiseman are writers and executive producers on “Eternally Yours.” Eric Tannenbaum, Kim Tannenbaum, and Jason Wang also executive produce. CBS Studios will produce. \n",

    "body": "\n\tA spokesperson for Sean “Diddy” Combs has has slammed 50 Cent’s upcoming Netflix docuseries “Sean Combs: The Reckoning” as a “shameful hit piece” and accused Netflix of using “stolen footage that was never authorized for release.”\n\n\tWhen reached for comment about the allegation of stolen footage, a representative for Netflix directed Variety to a quote from docuseries director Alexandria Stapleton. “It came to us, we obtained the footage legally and have the necessary rights,” she said. “We moved heaven and earth to keep the filmmaker’s identity confidential. One thing about Sean Combs is that he’s always filming himself, and it’s been an obsession throughout the decades. We also reached out to Sean Combs’ legal team for an interview and comment multiple times, but did not hear back.”\n\t\n\n\tCombs’ representative released the statement on Monday, the day before “The Reckoning” premieres, after Netflix released a new teaser for the docuseries. In it, Combs is seen on a phone call six days before his 2024 arrest, which eventually led him to be convicted of transportation to engage in prostitution, though he was acquitted of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering charges. “We need to find someone who will work with us who has worked in the dirtiest of dirty businesses,” he says in the footage. “We are losing.”\n\n\n\tCombs’ rep says that Combs “has been amassing footage since he was 19 to tell his own story, in his own way,” but that Netflix is using his words out of context. The statement also name-checks Ted Sarandos multiple times, saying Combs has “long respected” the Netflix CEO and that he “expected fairness from people he respected.” Additionally, the rep wrote that 50 Cent is “a longtime adversary with a personal vendetta who has spent too much time slandering Mr. Combs” and that it is “staggering that Netflix handed creative control” to him.\n\t\n\n\tRead the full statement below. \n\n\tNetflix’s so-called ‘documentary’ is a shameful hit piece. Today’s GMA teaser confirms that Netflix relied on stolen footage that was never authorized for release. As Netflix and CEO Ted Sarandos know, Mr. Combs has been amassing footage since he was 19 to tell his own story, in his own way. It is fundamentally unfair, and illegal, for Netflix to misappropriate that work.\n\n\tNetflix is plainly desperate to sensationalize every minute of Mr. Combs’s life, without regard for truth, in order to capitalize on a never-ending media frenzy. If Netflix cared about truth or about Mr. Combs’s legal rights, it would not be ripping private footage out of context – including conversations with his lawyers that were never intended for public viewing. No rights in that material were ever transferred to Netflix or any third party.\n\n\tIt is equally staggering that Netflix handed creative control to Curtis ‘50 Cent’ Jackson – a longtime adversary with a personal vendetta who has spent too much time slandering Mr. Combs.\n\n\tBeyond the legal issues, this is a personal breach of trust. Mr. Combs has long respected Ted Sarandos and admired the legacy of Clarence Avant. For Netflix to give his life story to someone who has publicly attacked him for decades feels like an unnecessary and deeply personal affront. At minimum, he expected fairness from people he respected.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMexico’s Tulip Pictures, formerly Barraca Prods., is opening offices in Austin, Texas and Spain as it seeks to tap their respective incentives and foster new co-productions.\n\n\tBoth places offer vibrant and infinite possibilities, said Lorena Villarreal, co-owner-founder of Tulip Pictures alongside her husband, Darian de la Fuente. Move comes as more Latin American companies are setting up shop in Madrid, including Chile’s Clara Films and Peru’s Tondero, among others.\n\t\n\n\tVillarreal’s third directorial outing, “Life Is” (“La vida es”) is also bowing its official international teaser trailer with Variety. The dark comedy had its world premiere at Argentina’s Mar del Plata Film Festival, the only A-list festival in Latin America, where it was well received by critics and audiences alike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“Experiencing the film with the audience in the festival was priceless,” said Villarreal who was deeply moved by the “great creative exchanges and level of appreciation for independent cinema in Argentina.”\n\n\tPenned by Villarreal and Ian Martin (“Veep,” “The Death of Stalin”), the pic will be hitting the international festival circuit before it debuts in Mexico next year. It was produced by Villarreal, de la Fuente and Denisse Chapa of Tulip Pictures and Axel Kuschevatzky of Infinity Hill along with Barraca Prods. in its last foray into filmmaking before it focuses solely on advertising production\n\n\tStarring Chile’s Paulina Garcia (“Gloria”), Naian González Norvind (“Corina”), Natalia Plascencia (“Familia”) and Rubén Ochandiano (“Biutiful”), it focuses on two women about to turn 40 who face mid-life predicaments as they navigate a mosaic of emotions and multiple events.\n\t\n\n\tNora’s (Plasencia) existential crisis is triggered by multiple collapses her family life, emotional stability, career and fracturing polyamorous relationship while Ely (González Norvind) longs for some stability in her life.\n\n\tSaid Villarreal: “Directing ‘Life Is’ gave me the opportunity to explore themes such as loss, midlife crisis and the search for one’s purpose and identity – what we truly want in life and who we truly are – through a distinctly female perspective and within a diverse narrative universe.”\n\n\t“Life Is” marks quite a departure from Villarreal’s previous pics “The Weeping Women” (“Las Lloronas”) and “Silencio,” which are both genre pics, although Villarreal sees some resemblance to “Las Lloronas” as they are both about women.\n\n\tTulip Pictures kicks off the international rollout of “Life Is” at Ventana Sur as it moves to expand its offices and bolster its status across the Ibero-American, U.S. and international markets.\n\n\tIts latest acquisitions include Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke’s “A Useful Ghost,” winner of Cannes’ Critics’ Week; Diego Céspedes’ Un Certain Regard winner “The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo,” also Chile’s Oscar submission, and Eva Libertad’s “Deaf” (“Sorda”), winner of Berlinale’s Panorama Audience Award and multiple Malaga Festival prizes.\n\n\tTulip’s broader slate includes work by Hirokazu Kore-eda, Paul Verhoeven and Andrea Arnold, along with emerging filmmakers on the international circuit.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Villarreal is preparing her English-language feature “Ophelia,” co-written again with Martin, an Emmy winner and BAFTA nominee, which centers on a 60-year-old woman facing a pivotal moment of reckoning. Target shooting locations are either in Spain or the U.K. by September next year.\n\n\tTulip will also host the second edition of its Muestra de Oaxaca, a showcase of Mexican cinema, next spring, and will again be organizing the Monterrey International Film Festival, also slated for 2026.\n\n\tAs part of the company’s structure, Abraham González Ruiz leads the distribution arm of Tulip Pictures as director of distribution and acquisitions while Paloma Cabrera serves as director of production and development, overseeing Tulip’s project pipeline and cross-border collaborations.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNatalia Plasencia, Lorena Villarreal, Naian González (l-r) Credit: Cleo Bouza\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMegan Thee Stallion has won her defamation lawsuit against blogger Milagro Cooper, also known as Milagro Gramz.\n\n\tA Florida jury on Monday backed the rapper’s claims that Cooper had harassed and defamed her after singer Tory Lanez shot her in July 2020. According to NBC News, Megan was awarded $75,000 before U.S. District Court Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga reduced it to $59,000.\n\n\tMegan initially sued Cooper in October 2024, claiming that she had conspired with Lanez to defame her after Lanez was sentenced to 10 years in prison on three felony charges. Megan accused Cooper of being a “paid surrogate” and “mouthpiece” for Lanez following her testimony against the singer.\n\t\n\n\tShe also alleged that Cooper promoted a sexually explicit deepfake of Megan on social media by encouraging her followers to view it. “I feel like … to this day, I feel a little, like, defeated,” Megan testified, according to NBC News. “Because no matter what, no matter if the video was fake or not … [Gramz] wanted it to be real.”\n\n\tMegan stated that Cooper’s actions harmed her mental health. “It’s really embarrassing to have to look at what the people don’t know,” she said. “See, in a position like that, like, I know it’s not me, but to be in front of everybody else and they have to watch it — it’s really embarrassing.”\n\n\tEarlier this year, Megan was granted a five-year restraining order against Lanez. She claimed that he had been harassing her from behind bars as he serves his sentence, and that she testified via video call that she was fearful of what would happen to her after Lanez’s release. “I feel like maybe he’ll shoot me again, and maybe this time I won’t make it,” she said.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Man Finds Tape” (Opening in theaters on Dec. 5 via Magnolia Pictures & Magnet Releasing) — Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead are producers on this twisty indie that finds horror in mysterious found footage tapes. First-time directors Paul Gandersman and Peter Hall conjure impressive imagery and solid scares in this story of siblings investigating a murder and stumbling upon even darker small-town secrets. “Silent Night, Deadly Night” (Opening in theaters on Dec. 12 via Cineverse) — This remake of the classic holiday slasher features “Halloween Ends” star Rohan Campbell as the murderous Santa, and is written and directed by Mike P. Nelson, who helmed the excellent 2021 “Wrong Turn” reboot. Given the ‘80s fun of the original film, the property seems ripe for a more nerve-shredding take. “Dust Bunny” (Opening in theaters on Dec. 12 via Lionsgate) — Bryan Fuller’s first foray into writing and directing a film is this stylish horror adventure, where a little girl (Sophie Sloan) hires a hitman (Mads Mikkelsen) to kill the very-real monster living under her bed. There’s some great humor and heart in this genre blend from the “Hannibal” and “Pushing Daisies” mastermind. “The Plague” (Opening in theaters Dec. 24 via Independent Film Company) — Writer and director Charlie Polinger’s body horror film — about boys creating their own dark social system at water polo camp — debuted in the Un Certain Regard section of this year’s Cannes Film Festival. Joel Edgerton plays the coach alongside a crew of talented young actors.",

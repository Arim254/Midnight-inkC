    "body": "\n\tWhen David Kaplan, the New York-based producer of Beth de Araújo’s Sundance prizewinning “Josephine,” arrived at the fireside chat hosted by European Film Market on Sunday afternoon, he sounded like he’d been working across different time zones, which, by all accounts, he has. \n\n\tThe U.S. deal for “Josephine” to Sumerian Pictures closed late last night in Berlin, which made the timing for the on-stage discussion moderated by Variety quite fitting. \n\t\n\n\tAfter securing a double prize win at Sundance, the movie was finally sold by WME Independent and CAA Media Finance to upstart U.S. distributor Sumerian in a ‘mid-to-high seven figures,” said Kaplan on stage in Berlin, where the film will play in competition. For a film that most of the market initially resisted, it’s a lucrative pact that Kaplan hopes will pay off in the long run, and will also allow investors to get their money back on the film which was budgeted at $6 million and only completed its financing six days into the shoot. \n\n\n\t“We had a few offers, varying levels of financing, varying levels of theatrical commitment. Obviously, that plays some role in all of this,” he said candidly. \n\n\t“It was very important to Beth always that our investors made their money back if they could. They took tremendous risk. It’s important to me as a producer in the same way. Why would anyone want to work with you again if you don’t take care of them in that way, particularly in success?”\n\n\tSumerian also offered “a very meaningful screen commitment, a very meaningful P&A commitment,”  continued Kaplan, whose company Kaplan Morrison, which he founded with Andrew Morrison three years ago, has so far produced Brady Corbet’s “The Brutalist” and Mona Fastvold’s “The Testament of Ann Lee.” \n\t\n\n\tKaplan said Sumerian splurged on “Josephine” and “told (them) this is going to be the flagship.” “I think we just saw that in them, there was a partner who maybe had as much skin in the game as we did and could. You want that.”\n\n\tThe producer, who hinted that he also took some personal risk to make “Josephine” and didn’t take an upfront fee (and possibly no backend either), can relate to that level of dedication. \n\n\t“Like everybody else on the film, everybody sacrificed for this film,” Kaplan said. “That’s how you make a film with movie stars and a great director and great crew in an expensive city for that amount. It takes a village of people who believe.”\n\n\t“Josephine” was 12 years in the making and Kaplan came on board in the last three. He had known de Araújo for years and was working with her on another project. But “Josephine” suddenly took priority after de Araújo met Channing Tatum, Kaplan recalled. \n\n\t“She called me up and said, ‘Well, I know we’re supposed to be making this other film, and I’m still very excited about that, but I now have two actors for this other script (Gemma Chan had already been attached for years). Would you ever be interested in perhaps doing that first?’” Kaplan said. \n\n\t“To which I said, ‘Gemma Chan, Channing Tatum, this beautiful script of yours that I read years ago that I know you’ve always wanted to make, the movie that you’ve always wanted to make. Yeah, we should probably do that.'” \n\n\tKaplan joked about the number of producers who tried to mount it. Among the bunch is no other than Sean Baker (“Anora”). “Someday we have to have a dinner for all the producers of ‘Josephine,’ because collectively, we all made this movie. It just took a very long time.”\n\n\t“Josephine” is definitely not an easy sale at a time when the market is mostly interested in feel good movies, comedies, romances or genre. Inspired by events de Araújo witnessed as a child, the film tells the story of an 8-year-old who sees a rape in Golden Gate Park. Tatum and Chan play Josephine’s parents, who must navigate the little girl’s trauma amid the quest for justice for the survivor.\n\n\tDespite de Araújo’s debut “Soft & Quiet” which was critically acclaimed at South by Southwest upon premiering in 2022, “Josephine” was nearly impossible to finance given its topic.\n\t\n\n\t“99% of the people we went to and said, ‘Would you like to make this film?’ said, ‘Absolutely not,’” Kaplan recalls. \n\n\t“Resistance, concern, skepticism about the commerciality, worry from parents about what this film is and worrying that it’s too dark,” Kaplan said of the difficulties to finance the movie. “I think there was a lot of concern that who is this movie for? How is this movie going to be? Is it commercial?”\n\n\tHe also pointed to an “inherent bias against films that are perhaps more geared towards women and assault survivors.”\n\n\tTatum and Chan, who served as producers on the film, also played a decisive role in getting the project off the ground. “Gemma’s involvement in this film dates back many years now. She stood by it,” he said. Tatum, meanwhile, went as far as pitching investors. “He was a part of the team, raising the money and trying to make the movie. You just don’t see that very often,” he said. \n\n\tMason Lily Reeves, who plays the title role in the film, was discovered just seven weeks before production when de Araújo saw her at a farmers’ market in San Francisco. \n\n\t“Beth… saw her in a crowd at a market seven weeks before we started shooting,” Kaplan said. De Araújo approached Reeves’ mother directly. The team had seen roughly 90 children, including an experienced young actor, but de Araújo was resolute. “Immediately, from the first time Beth started working with Mason in the casting process, she was like, ‘This is the girl.’”\n\n\tSince Reeves was only seven when she was cast, it got more complicated for the production. “In America, there are labor laws,” Kaplan noted. “Casting someone younger meant that our schedule had to be longer and we had to spend more money on this film for days just to cast Mason.” \n\n\tUltimately, the film was financed by three equity partners: Spark Features; Kinematics (“The Apprentice”); and Yintai Entertainment (“The Testament of Ann Lee”), which came aboard during production. The close came perilously late. “We closed the financing… six days into principal photography. Not knowing if it would fall apart, even two days before we started production.”\n\n\t“The film shot in San Francisco, a decision de Araújo insisted on. “The texture of the city animates the movie. We could not fake San Francisco and didn’t want to.”\n\t\n\n\tKaplan’s banner now is developing about six projects, including Brady Corbet’s and Mona Fastvold’s next projects, as well as the highly anticipated sequel to “It Follows,” David Robert Mitchell’s cult 2014 genre film, which Neon has boarded. \n\n\t“We have partners in both U.S. and internationally to release the film,” he said, adding that the sequel will “hopefully start shooting in the months to come.”\n\n\tKaplan is also in post with another ambitious project, “Triumph of the Will,” which is directed by Gabriel Nussbaum with a cast led by Shira Haas (“Unorthodox”). The film is a sprawling period movie set during WWII and stars Haas as a woman who leaves her husband in Amsterdam in 1937 to start a new life with her daughter in Berlin, where she takes up with a firebrand rabbi on a mission to help Jews get out of the country. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Pulp Fiction” co-writer Roger Avary recently told the “Joe Rogan Experience” that it was “impossible” for him to get his movies made through “traditional” means. But after launching his AI production banner General Cinema Dynamics, he now has three features in production.\n\n\t“I go out there and try to get stuff made, and it’s almost impossible,” Avary said. “And then I built a technology company over the last year, basically making AI movies, and all of a sudden, boom, like that, money gets thrown at it. All of a sudden, just by attaching the word ‘AI’ and [the fact] that it’s a technology-based company, all of a sudden, investors came in, and we’re in production on three films now.”\n\t\n\n\t“It was so easy for me to get that going and so difficult for me to get a traditional movie going through the traditional route,” he added. “Just put AI in front of it and all of a sudden you’re in production on three features.”\n\n\n\tAvary’s three AI films are “a family Christmas movie that’ll be in theaters this holiday season,” a “faith-based movie for next Easter” and a “big romantic war epic.”\n\n\tWhile filmmakers like Avary are taking advantage of the AI boom, many in Hollywood fear the technology will bring seismic, irreversible changes to the industry. These fears were further realized on Tuesday when a user plugged a two-line prompt into AI video generator Seedance 2.0 and created a polished, hyper-realistic clip for Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt. After the video went viral, the Motion Picture Association released a statement denouncing Seedance 2.0, and its parent company ByteDance, for engaging in “unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale.”\n\t\n\n\t“By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs. ByteDance should immediately cease its infringing activity,” read the statement.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn the last decade, I’ve occasionally written pieces that compared what’s happening in the world — specifically, in the Trump presidency — to something we’re used to seeing on the big screen. Eight months into his first term, I wrote a column entitled “Donald Trump’s Pop-Culture Presidency Enters Its Thriller Phase,” in which I argued that Trump was “acting like an unhinged president out of a movie,” and that his reckless threats against North Korea were designed to get a cinematic rise out of us; it was saber-rattling as showbiz. Given how disastrous and threatening his second term has turned out to be (no mere cinematic posturing — a true descent into authoritarian terror and lawlessness), such comparisons may now seem trivial and beside the point. I certainly wouldn’t say there’s much about the Trump presidency today that “reminds me of a movie.”\n\t\n\n\tBut I will say that, insistently, about the Epstein files. Let’s be clear: The Jeffrey Epstein story is a scandal of impossible momentousness. Right now, it’s already looking like it could be Watergate times 10. It’s a saga of crime, cover-up and corruption — not just corruption but bone-deep rot — that’s driven by primal currents of fear and horror and victimization. The victims are real, and there are many of them. Keeping the awareness of what they’ve been through front and center is essential to approaching this story.\n\n\n\tWhat I want to talk about, however, is the way that so many of us have experienced the Epstein story over the last two weeks — specifically, since Friday, Jan. 30, the day of the second document dump of redacted files. Let me make a confession: Ever since that day, I have been in the rabbit hole — that is, down the Epstein rabbit hole on the Internet, where I have scarcely come up for air. I am not, by nature, a conspiracy theorist (for the record: I believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone). And in the occasional rabbit holes I’ve let myself go down a bit, like the long night I spent in 2007, from about 1:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m., in 9/11-was-an-inside-job land (by the time the sun came up, I had snapped back to reality), I’ve learned how unhealthy and warped it can be to give in to the desire to go through the looking glass.\n\t\n\n\tBut the Epstein case is different. Simply put, there’s so much we don’t know. The story is so disturbing and sensational in its criminality that it’s like a car accident: horrific, but you can’t turn away. Through it all, we’ve been looking at mere fragments of information, trying to poke around black boxes and black bars. We have a government that wants to wall it off forever. I so wish that this was Watergate, and that I was reading full-scale investigative reports about it in places like The New York Times. But that’s not the world we’re in. Like so many others, I’ve been trying to piece together the Epstein saga in shadowy corners of the Web because that, for the moment, is the only way to glimpse the reality, to grab onto the tips of the icebergs and see where they lead.\n\n\tFor that reason, the Epstein files story has now taken on the dimensions of a labyrinthine dark thriller, one that promises to lead to a staggering revelation at the end of the tunnel. The revelation, in this case, being two things at once: the identities of those involved…and what they did. And it’s the latter point that’s now starting to look darker than many of us could have imagined. The movie question, the one of intense and unfathomable drama, is this: How dark does this thing get? Is it “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” or is it “Cannibal Holocaust”?\n\n\tWhen you explore the Epstein case on the Internet, you’re led to some very unsettling theories and places. Some of it is speculative, some is attached to shards of evidence, and the fact that so much of it exists in a gray zone between the plausible and the uncanny is part of the unique quality of the case. It’s an onion of evil that raises the following questions, almost in order: Are we dealing, simply, with a convicted sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein, who indulged his criminal sexual pathologies and shared them with his ring of fellow predators and associates? Since we know that he had surveillance cameras everywhere (hence the thousands of hours of confiscated Epstein video, almost none of which we’ve seen), was he involved in blackmail? If so, to what end — financial or political? Or was he just using all of that for “leverage”? Was Epstein working for the Mossad, or for Russian intelligence (Russia is mentioned 10,000 times in the Epstein files; Putin 1,000 times)? Or both? That Ghislaine Maxwell’s late corrupt media-baron father, Robert Maxwell, was allegedly working for the Mossad raises the possibility.\n\t\n\n\tBut all of this has been discussed for years. In recent weeks, the specter has been raised of a disquieting new level of Epstein darkness. And that’s where the “movie” I’m talking about becomes murky…but also where it changes character and grows deadlier in its significance. For if that darker level is real, we could be in the midst of the most world-shaking news event since World War II.\n\n\tIt’s been said that the three million Epstein files yet to be released are the worst of them: the most graphic and extreme. Do they contain images of the sexual abuse of children? Children as young as 9 or 10? Or younger? Do they contain images of torture? To even consider the possibility requires, in one’s imagination, the entrance into a kind of horror movie. I say that because it’s just about the only paradigm we have. Yet as you research this stuff, and come upon stories of “elite” global aristocrats who have participated in child sex abuse and child murder, you find yourself thinking, “My God, was QAnon onto something?”\n\n\tThere’s a powerful piece of data that backs up the idea that QAnon, as unhinged and farfetched as its theories could be, was onto something. It’s been documented that in the 1990s, with the rise of the Internet, the amount of sex trafficking around the globe spiked in a significant way. That’s because the new technology facilitated it. It is now a $150 billion industry. There are millions of people who are trafficked around the world each year, and a number of them are children. The question that’s almost too disturbing to ask is: Who are those children trafficked to? It seems more than likely that they’re trafficked to people of wealth and power. And it’s not as if those children are then “returned”…to their parents, or orphanage, or wherever. They’re abused, and then they — or some of them, anyway — disappear.\n\n\tJeffrey Epstein was arguably the most powerfully connected sex trafficker in the Western world. So it only makes sense to look at him and think that he might have participated in that criminal circle of hell. That’s why the stray clues we’ve seen so far in the Epstein files (references to children, and photographs of them; references to torture) are so unnerving. It’s telling, to me, that up until two weeks ago, almost no one had even heard of Zorro Ranch, the vast compound Epstein owned in New Mexico. (It was isolated, because he owned miles of the surrounding land, which he’d purchased at a fire-sale price.) It was as sprawling a “getaway” as Little St. James Island, the Epstein compound we all know about. But why is it never mentioned? The rumor — I’m speaking in rumors because I have not read a report about this in The New York Times — is that that’s where he oversaw his darkest activities. What went on at Zorro Ranch? After Epstein’s death, the place was sold off and never treated as a crime scene.     \n\t\n\n\tWhen you go down the Epstein rabbit hole, you encounter stories and theories that can seem outlandish, the majority of which are likely untrue. Here are just a few: that Epstein’s death was faked, and that he is still alive (“photographs” of him in Tel Aviv have been popping up; they are surely AI); that Stanley Kubrick was murdered for laying bare the depravity of the global elite in “Eyes Wide Shut”; and that the owner of a certain Washington, D.C., pizza parlor is a member of the Rothschild family. This is all stuff that would make a good suspense film.\n\n\tYet the essence of the Epstein rabbit hole is that you begin to encounter “outlandish” things that start to seem less outlandish. Like, for instance, the theory that Epstein was murdered (there have been significant circumstantial questions about what went on, with respect to guards and surveillance tapes, the night of his death). Or the fact that Epstein ordered 60 55-gallon drums of sulfuric acid delivered to his island, the invoice dated the same day the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan reopened its federal investigation into him. (That actually happened.) Or the haunting videotape I have seen online that purports to show a well-known political operative torturing a child. Is the video real? I cannot say. But a part of me says that I’m haunted by it because it is real.\n\n\tAll of this — true or untrue, confirmed or speculative — has the effect of making it feel like we’re seeing a curtain slowly being drawn back, revealing the reality we were living with without knowing it, the nightmare lurking behind our everyday dream. Very “Rosemary’s Baby.” And to the degree that that nightmare proves to be real, it could shake the very foundations of our society: our core perceptions of power, and politics, and celebrity, and what members of the “privileged” class feel secretly privileged to do. The videos in the Epstein files are, of course, all too real, and if they’re ever released, the crimes that are on them finally revealed, it could start to bring this ultimate true-life mystery movie to a close, and in a way that stays shockingly true to our movie-fed imaginations: by letting us see it all with our own eyes.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wuthering Heights” was No. 1 at the global box office with $82 million, ranking as the top worldwide debut of the year.\n\n\tThose ticket sales include a better-than-expected $42 million internationally from 76 territories as well as $40 million over the four-day domestic debut. (Rival studios believe the North American tally will be closer to $35 million through the President’s Day holiday on Monday.) Warner Bros. is backing the $80 million production. Directed by Emerald Fennell and starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, the bold and steamy remake of Emily Brontë’s classic novel follows a toxic relationship between star-crossed lovers Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff in 18th century England.\n\t\n\n\tSince reviews and word-of-mouth have been mixed and domestic ticket sales were slightly softer than expected, “Wuthering Heights” may rely on international audiences to offset its budget. (That’s because movie theater owners keep roughly half of theatrical revenues.) Top overseas markets were the United Kingdom with $10.3 million, Italy with $4.4 million and Australia with $4.3 million. Warner Bros. didn’t report any grosses from Asian territories, though the film has yet to open in two key markets, China and Japan.\n\n\n\tSecond place on global charts went to Sony’s animated sports comedy “GOAT,” which scored $47.6 million in its debut, including $15.6 million from 42 international markets. The kid-friendly film about an aspiring roarball champion (it’s like basketball, but different) has yet to open in 40% of overseas territories, including China, Australia, Germany and South Korea. In countries where “GOAT” is playing, the U.K. brought in the biggest bounty with $4.8 million, followed by Mexico with $1.8 million and Spain with $1.2 million.\n\t\n\n\tSince “GOAT” cost $80 million to produce, Sony is hoping the film will show the kind of impressive endurance that greeted recent animated offerings including 2023’s “Migration” (which had a much quieter start and eventually  earned $300 million globally) and 2024’s “The Wild Robot (which also debuted in the teens overseas and powered to $334 million worldwide). It helps that family audiences, who have been starved for a compelling new movie since “Zootopia 2” opened around Thanksgiving, won’t have anything new to see until Pixar’s “Hoppers” arrives in March.\n\n\t“Crime 101,” a crime thriller starring Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo, captured the No. 3 spot with a soft $12 million from 60 markets. The film, from Amazon MGM, stumbled at the domestic box office with $15 million over the traditional weekend and an estimated $17.7 million through Monday, bringing its global tally to $29.7 million over four days. Top territories were the U.K. with $2 million, Australia with $1.4 million and Saudi Arabia with $790,000.\n\n\tAlthough a decent launch for an R-rated movie aimed at adults, “Crime 101″ cost $90 million to produce (not including the marketing expenses). That means the film will need a long theatrical life to justify its price tag. Amazon MGM, which is relatively newer to the theatrical space, believes the big screen is helpful in terms of elevating the profile of films before they land on streaming. Directed by Bart Layton (“American Animals”), “Crime 101” stars Hemsworth as an elusive jewel thief who plots high-stakes heists across the Los Angeles freeway.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDavid Kaplan, the Brooklyn-based independent producer whose latest film, “Josephine,” won a pair of awards at Sundance and will next compete at the Berlinale, has set his next ambitious project, “Triumph of the Will,” with a cast led by Shira Haas (“Unorthodox”).\n\n\tCurrently in post, “Triumph of the Will” is a sprawling period movie set during WWII, written and directed by American filmmaker Gabriel Nussbaum.\n\n\n\tHaas, best known for her performance in the Netflix limited series “Unorthodox” and “Shtisel,” leads the film as a woman who leaves her husband in Amsterdam in 1937 to start a new life with her daughter in Berlin. She takes up with a firebrand rabbi on a mission to help Jews get out of the country. \n\t\n\n\tSamuel Levine, Tony-nominated Betsy Aidem (“Irrational Man”), Simon Helberg (“Big Bang Theory”), John Carroll Lynch (“The Walking Dead”) and Philip Ettinger (“Josephine”) complete the cast. Kaplan Morrison, which he founded with Andrew Morrison three years ago, is producing the film with Nussbaum and Elizabeth Wood at Bank Street Films.\n\n\t“This good man is trying to help people get out of Berlin, but he is perhaps more focused on doing good work than he is on saving himself or his new family,” Kaplan tells Variety. “It starts as a romantic drama about somebody trying to find happiness, have the life they want, even if it’s slightly irrational.”\n\n\tUltimately, the film is not just about survival, it’s also a morality tale, says Kaplan. As in “Josephine,” “Triumph of the Will” has a child at the center of the story. Here, it’s a four-year-old. As the new couple sets off to flee Berlin, they’re faced with an impossible choice. “Since they don’t have the papers for her because he’s not her father, they we have to decide whether or not they leave her behind in Berlin and survive themselves, and try and have her sent to America after they get there, or whether they’re all going to stay behind and die,” Kaplan says.\n\t\n\n\t“Triumph of the Will” shot entirely in New York, where the producers managed to re-create Amsterdam, Berlin, Lisbon and Oklahoma.\n\n\t“We’re all New Yorkers and we wanted to shoot there for casting and also for the crew,” he said. “If you can make a movie in the place you live, it’s great because then you’re spending money on your friends, on your community, on your tax base. I understand the economic argument of going somewhere else, but we got to spend money and it goes right back into our city,” said Kaplan.\n\n\tBesides “Josephine,” Kaplan Morrison has so far produced Brady Corbet’s “The Brutalist” and Mona Fastvold’s “The Testament of Ann Lee.” The banner is now developing Corbet’s and Fastvold’s next films, as well as the sequel to “It Follows” with Neon.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFirst Look, the works-in-progress program of Locarno Pro, will turn its focus to Uruguay during the 79th Locarno Film Festival (Aug. 5–15). Established as a premier post-production showcase for international arthouse cinema, the initiative offers producers a strategic platform to present their projects to leading sales agents, distributors and festival programmers at a decisive stage in their films’ financing and market trajectory.\n\n\tNow on its 15th edition, First Look is partnerning with Uruguayan film institute ACAU to present six Uruguayan feature films currently in post, which its producers will present to international sales agents, buyers, festival programmers and post-production fund reps.\n\t\n\n\tAside from on-site presentations, the projects will be made accessible to accredited professionals via the Festival’s online digital library.\n\n\n\tExpressing his delight at spotlighting Uruguay for this edition, Markus Duffner, director of Locarno Pro, said: “This initiative remains a cornerstone of our mission to support the final stages of outstanding films and to help propel the international careers of emerging filmmakers. Our collaboration with ACAU will strengthen the international positioning of Uruguayan production companies.”\n\n\t “Uruguay’s presence in the Locarno Film Festival as the protagonist of First Look 2026 marks a strategic moment for our cinematography this year,” ACAU president Gisella Pevitali concurred.\n\n\t“It not only recognizes Uruguayan talents but also highlights the continuous evolution of our public policies and the tangible, growing international appreciation for the quality, diversity, and originality of Uruguayan cinematic works.”\n\t\n\n\tPast editions at Locarno have featured Uruguayan productions and co-productions across multiple sidebars, including: “The Enemies of Pain” (“Los enemigos del dolor,” 2014) by Arauco Hernández and “Norberto’s Deadline” (“Norberto apenas tarde,” 2010) by Daniel Hendler (Concorso Cineasti del Presente section).\n\n\t“The Guest Room” (“El cuarto del fondo,” 2007) by Ana Guevara and Leticia Jorge (Open Doors Screenings) and Manolo Nieto’s “El lugar del hijo” (Cinéfondation 2008) also played at the fest.\n\n\tInternational co-productions with Uruguayan participation include “Kiss of the Spider Woman” (2025) by Bill Condon (Piazza Grande), starring Diego Luna and Jennifer Lopez and one of Locarno’s biggest draws last year and “Severina” (2017) by Felipe Hirsch (Concorso Cineasti del Presente).\n\n\tSaid Giona A. Nazzaro, artistic director of the Locarno Film Festival: “At a time in history when the need for new voices is urgent and inevitable, turning our attention to Uruguay means broadening our horizons once again. Six films in post-production, evaluated by a jury of international experts, representing a forward-looking commitment to the future of cinema: a commitment where creativity and vision intersect with a new, sustainable way of engaging with the industry.”\n\n\tApplications are now being accepted through Locarno Pro until May 6, 2026. To be eligible for selection, producers need to provide a rough cut of at least 60 minutes at any stage in the post-production process. The principal production company for the film must be based in Uruguay.\n\n\tThe selection, along with the jury members, will be announced in July. A number of valuable in-kind prizes are in contention for the winners who will be announced during the Locarno Pro Award Ceremony on Aug. 9.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile jumping through the hoops of her first U.S. awards season two years ago for “Anatomy of a Fall” and “The Zone of Interest,” it must have amused Sandra Hüller to be labeled a “breakthrough performer” — as if the “Toni Erdmann” star hadn’t repeatedly proven herself one of the world’s great working actors since her startling feature film debut in 2006’s “Requiem.” No one should be surprised that she’s again extraordinary in “Rose,” as a 17th-century war veteran concealing a host of secrets (not least among them her gender) beneath a man’s rugged work clothes. Yet the performance itself is consistently and subtly surprising: still and observant when you might expect mannered fuss, raging when you expect retreat, never transparent or complacent regarding the character’s motives or sense of self.\n\t\n\n\tYet for all the Olympian acting craft it showcases, “Rose” is no mere performance vehicle. The latest from radical Austrian formalist Markus Schleinzer, it’s a work so tightly disciplined in every aspect — from its haunted monochrome lensing to its razor-shaved final edit to the sea of tacit political commentary underpinning its no-word-wasted script — that any bum thespian note would shatter the whole immaculate construction. A casting director for the likes of Michael Haneke and Jessica Hausner before he turned to filmmaking, Schleinzer needed and found a virtuoso who could also submit herself entirely to the film’s quietly complex thesis on gender performativity and privilege, past and present.\n\n\n\tThe exactitude of Schleinzer’s filmmaking doesn’t come quickly, it would appear. “Rose” is just his third feature in 16 years, and arrives eight years after his astonishing sophomore effort “Angelo,” a rigorously revisionist biopic of African-born slave turned Viennese courtier Angelo Soliman that was too austerely confrontational to secure the distribution it merited in many territories. (His assured debut, the 2011 paedophile portrait “Michael,” was no picnic for potential audiences either.) While no more compromising in its telling of a supremely sad and socially unforgiving story, “Rose’s” linear elegance and delicate craft collaborate with Hüller’s riveting work to make it the director’s most accessible film, sure to interest discerning arthouse buyers following its Berlinale competition premiere.\n\t\n\n\tThough she doesn’t give it up readily, Rose (Hüller) has a simple explanation for why she’s chosen to live as a man for much of her adult life. “There is more freedom in trousers,” she says, “and they’re just a piece of cloth, so I put them on.” That is no casual act, however, in 17th-century Germany, least of all in the ascetic Protestant village she chooses to settle in, following a long, brutal stint as a soldier in the Thirty Years’ War. \n\n\tThe villagers are initially wary of this scarred, soft-spoken, diminutive figure, who turns up claiming to be the long-absent heir to a crumbling local farmstead. But Rose — we never learn the male name she gives people, just as they never learn her female one, a typically geometric detail in Schleinzer and Alexander Brom’s screenplay — gradually wins their approval with her work ethic and church attendance, to the point that a neighboring farmer offers her the hand of his eldest daughter Suzanna (Caro Braun). As part of a land exchange deal, of course: That a woman is shown to be such literal currency in this world is a sharp reminder of why Rose has opted out of that identity.\n\n\tSuzanna is a stolid and servile wife, less complaining than her father about her husband’s reluctance to consummate the marriage, and a doting mother when baby eventually — and most unexpectedly, to Rose at least — makes three. There’s a slender streak of humor, dry and combustible as kindling, in the film’s exploration of this absurd domestic setup, which lays out the rigid expectations of women and men alike in a punishingly conservative society. Though predominantly a fictional narrative, “Rose” has been built from Schleinzer’s extensive research into various stories of male-presenting women through the centuries; even as it tilts into melodrama, it has the ring of historical truth. (So do the film’s remarkably weathered production and costume design, in which every last patinated timber beam or scuffed boot heel appears excavated from the ground itself.) \n\n\tRunning narration, delivered with a kind of academic remove by actor Marisa Growaldt, provides some access to the inner life of our strategically taciturn, withdrawn protagonist, though it isn’t quite omniscient either. Schleinzer is content to let some ambiguities linger as the situation tautens and worsens, including the question of Rose’s own sexuality, or asexuality, as the case may be. She doesn’t identify as transgender or dysphoric, and describes her male presentation simply as a practical means of moving unimpeded through the world. Or mostly unimpeded: Marriage is another purely pragmatic move, though as Rose and Suzanna get to know each other better, a cautious tenderness builds between them — a flicker of warmth at the heart of this brisk exercise.   \n\t\n\n\tAt once armored, guarded and intensely vulnerable, Hüller’s performance is the human factor here — a volatile, unpredictable element, but one nonetheless attuned to the film’s meticulous shaping and mise-en-scène. While editor Hansjörg Weißbrich (“September 5”) crops this spiraling folk saga to just 93 essential minutes, the stark, poolingly dark black-and-white lensing by Schleinzer’s regular DP Gerald Kerkletz is concentrated and patient, often searching Hüller’s face in compassionate close-up for just the right twitch or tell. Most sparely effective of all is an a capella vocal score by singer-songwriter Tara Nome Doyle, whose high, moaning strains contain all the anguish that Rose, in all her stoic, assumed masculinity, keeps inside. \n",

    "body": "\n\tA clear sign that the world has gone topsy-turvy is when the Grammys are more political than the Berlinale. \n\n\tBut while anti-ICE pins and punchy statements were the surprise headline act in L.A. earlier this month, over in Berlin, historically an event where politics has played center stage on and off screen, the overriding theme of the 2026 festival so far is one of political silence. Or at least that’s how the narrative has been framed.\n\t\n\n\tFestival attendees Wim Wenders, Michelle Yeoh and Neil Patrick Harris have all come under fire online over their apparent refusal to make political statements when prompted in press conferences. Jury head Wenders’ comments on the opening day, in which he asserted that “we have to stay out of politics” when asked about the German government’s support for Israel impacting the festival’s stance on Gaza, lit the match. It soon led to author Arundhati Roy pulling out of the festival in anger. The bombardment of political questions in each and every media meet only snowballed from there on.\n\n\n\tBut when does it become the responsibility of an artist attending a festival to speak out?\n\n\tMany might have assumed that Wenders, who has previously asserted that “every film is political,” wouldn’t have deflected a question that most festival vets would have known was coming and perhaps offered something stronger to say.\n\n\tBut then, should Yeoh — who has been living in Switzerland for the last seven years — be expected to offer a soundbite about the political situation in the U.S.? And why would Neil Patrick Harris, in town to promote ‘Sunny Dancer,’ a British coming-of-age comedy about teenagers with cancer from a 25-year-old director, want the top line to be his opinions on American diplomatic threats? In each case, however, their comments — or lack thereof — became the story.\n\t\n\n\tAs Berlinale head Tricia Tuttle wrote in a lengthy statement put out on Saturday, filmmakers are now “expected to answer any question put to them,” and are “criticized if they do not answer.”\n\n\tFor Tilo Jung, the German political journalist who has been asking many of the politically-pronged questions, given the “rise of fascism” across much of the West, artists with a “bigger reach” should be using their platforms to speak out.\n\n\t“Fascism is the enemy of artistic freedom,” he says, pointing to the attacks against Bad Bunny following his Super Bowl performance. “So artists — especially the Hollywood elite —have a special role in a least raising their voices. They need to step up — and the time to do that is now. We need to learn from history.”\n\n\tOne artist who did speak up — to an extent — was Rupert Grint, asked if he would comment on the rise of the far-right in the U.K. in the press conference for Finnish horror “Nightborn.”\n\n\tHis answer — “Obviously, I’m against it” — prompted many to question the entire point of asking celebrities such questions. \n\n\t“But that was a better answer than Neil Patrick Harris,” said Jung. “Nobody is expecting a TED Talk. But at least expect one question and have an answer. But if an artist is afraid to speak up when it comes to fascism — then they shouldn’t be coming. Because these are different times. This is about good and evil, and as a German, we know what we’re talking about. You can’t be on the sidelines when it comes to this.”\n\n\tIt should be noted that in the same press con for “Nightborn,” screenwriter Ilja Rautsi did say that it was “important to shine a light on whatever issues we are facing because art is all about empathy,” adding “it’s maybe good to create some form of pressure, or just to get people aware of whatever is happening in the world.”\n\n\tBut there has certainly been a sense that the festival has been trying to keep the politics on the sidelines, or least displayed through the art rather than the artist.\n\n\tWhile Tuttle said that the political nature of “No Good Men” from Afghan director Shahrbanoo Sadat was one of the reasons it was selected for the opening night, the ceremony itself— aside from the red carpet guests (several of whom brought messages concerning hot topics like Iran and fascism) — was politics free. It was a far cry from 2023, when Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the guests on the opening night.\n\t\n\n\tAnd in the press conference for Charli xcx’s “The Moment,” the moderator took only two questions from the journalists in the room, dominating the rest of the time by asking her own softball questions.\n\n\tBut leave it to an outspoken U.S. rocker to buck the trend just a day later. \n\n\tRage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello — in town as co-director of music doc “The Ballad of Judas Priest” about the heavy metal pioneers — wasted little time on wading into the debate.\n\n\t“What a time to be alive, where you can both make a documentary about one of your favorite bands and fight fascism at the same time,” he said.\n\n\tThe room of journalists — perhaps hungry for something, anything with a bit of political bite — erupted into applause.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrom Pablo Larraín’s “Jackie,” “Spencer” and “Maria” to Sebastián Lelio’s Oscar-winning “A Fantastic Woman,” Chile has built its international reputation on auteur-driven cinema.\n\n\tAt the 2026 Berlin International Film Festival, however, the country is drawing just as much attention for its television shows. With three series in the lineup — “The House of the Spirits” (Berlinale Special), soccer-themed “Raza Brava” and thriller “Hidden Island” (both at Berlinale Series Market Selects) — Chile, after Spain, boasts one of the largest drama series presences of any country at this year’s festival.\n\t\n\n\t“Chilean filmmakers are taking slightly bigger risks than a lot of other parts of Latin America, and doing very high-quality productions on low budgets that are allowing them to get made and then hopefully get distribution around the world,” says former Netflix international honcho Erik Barmack, now at L.A.-based Wild Sheep Content, which co-produced “Raza Brava.”\n\n\n\t“I believe it’s an industry that’s constantly evolving and expanding, with an incredible amount of talent. That said, there’s still significant work to be done – especially in terms of financing. While we do receive some public funding support, it’s not enough to fully finance a series. And compared to the United States, there’s very little private investment willing to take risks on the industry, which remains one of our biggest challenges,” says Fernanda Urrejola, writer-showrunner-actress in “The House of the Spirits.”\n\n\t“The House of the Spirits”\n\t\n\n\tThe much-anticipated limited series features an Ibero-American cast and crew and was shot entirely in Chile. It is Prime Video’s most ambitious series in the region to date, and indeed the most expensive ever made in Chile.\n\n\tAn adaptation of Chilean author Isabel Allende’s 1982 debut novel that sold over 70 million copies worldwide, the series features a formidable troika of Chilean talent, Francisca Alegría (“The Cow Who Sang a Song Into the Future”), Andrés Wood (Sundance winner “Violeta Went to Heaven”) and Fernanda Urrejola (“Narcos: Mexico”) who shared showrunner-writer duties. While Wood and Alegria directed four episodes each, Urrejola played a key role in the show.\n\n\tThe family saga told across half a century turns on three generations of women: Clara, Blanca, and Alba. Narrated by Alba in the 1970s, the story shifts between past and present as she turns to her grandmother Clara’s diaries to understand her family’s history and her country’s divided soul. Through Clara’s memories, we follow the rise of the Truebas amid deepening social divides, where love, power and politics clash from rural estates to elite salons.\n\n\tAlegría, who is also at the EFM with producer Giancarlo Nasi of Quijote Films to present her second feature film, “Nativity” (“Nacimiento”), recalls the challenges in casting across various generations and working with a cast of at least 200 on any given day. “We had to think it through very carefully: At what ages did we need to cast them? When did we need to change actors or actresses? How many actresses would play each character?,” she recalls.\n\n\tThe series is produced by FilmNation Entertainment (“Anora” and “Conclave”). Pablo and Juan de Dios Larráin’s Fabula provided production services.\n\n\t “Raza Brava”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRaza Brava\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Tridi Films/Wild Sheep Latin America\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAmong the 17 scripted series being exclusively previewed at the Berlinale Series Market Selects, “Raza Brava” is set in Chile’s soccer underworld, where it trails Barti, a boy from the slums who rises through the ranks of Garra Blanca, rabid supporters of the Colo Colo soccer team. As power struggles and crime spark betrayal, he must choose between loyalty and survival.\n\n\tCreated and co-directed by Intl. Emmy Winner Hernán Caffiero (“The Suspended Mourning”), who says he drew inspiration from Brazil’s “City of God,” Fernando Meirelles’ gripping portrayal of a young boy who grows up in the brutal world of gang violence, drugs and poverty in Rio de Janeiro’s favelas.\n\t\n\n\tWhile presenting the show at Madrid’s Iberseries last October, Barmack pointed out that Colo-Colo is one of the top five or six clubs in Latin America and what Caffiero crafted was a narrative where soccer opens the door, but the drama inside is universally resonant—especially in Latin America, where the sport is closely tied to identity, pride and struggle.\n\n\tIt is produced by DeCulto alongside co-producers Wild Sheep Content and Atómica Group.\n\n\tSpain’s The Mediapro Studio Distribution handles world sales. It competes for the newly introduced Studio Babelsberg Production Excellence Award.“Hidden Island” (“Isla oculta”)\n\n\tAlso among the scripted series participating in the Berlinale Series Market Selects, with a screening slated for Feb. 16. “Hidden Island” takes place in southern Patagonia, where a detective digs into the disappearance of a Mexican archaeology student who was searching for Chile’s mythical Friendship Island, where extraterrestrial activity and people vanishing have been reported. The detective is played by Daniela Ramirez, who was International Emmy-nominated for her performance in HBO Max’s limited series “Isabel: The Intimate Story of Isabel Allende.”  \n\n\tPart thriller, part mystery, the show was created by Pablo Díaz del Río of Rio Estudios, which handles Latin American sales while TVCO handles the rest of the world. It boasts a crack team of writers led by Julio Rojas (“Case 63” podcast, “Midnight Family”), Felipe Carmona (“Prison in the Andes”) and Juan Dartizio (“An Unknown Enemy”).\n\n\tRodrigo Susarte, whose credits include “Gen Mishima” and “Invunche,” directed all six episodes.\n\n\t“Hidden Island” also competes for the newly introduced Studio Babelsberg Production Excellence Award, which recognizes standout producing qualities encompassing creative vision, execution, innovative approaches and international appeal.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHidden Island, Courtesy of Rio Estudios\n\t\n\n\n",

The couple got married in 2018, and they share a son, Gene. When news of their split became public last year, Amy addressed it in her signature candid style, emphasizing the focus remains on co-parenting and mutual respect.\n      \n\n          While the breakup appears amicable, Valentine's Day can hit differently during a major life change, and Amy didn't pretend otherwise. Rather than posting flowers or a romantic tribute, she embraced the moment with a tongue-in-cheek setup that felt both vulnerable and on brand.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Schumer has long built her career on turning personal experiences into relatable comedy, and this was no different.

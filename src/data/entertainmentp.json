    "body": "\n\tYoon Ga-eun‘s “The World of Love” has emerged as a breakout success in South Korea‘s independent film sector, drawing widespread praise from top-tier filmmakers.\n\n\t“The World of Love” has surpassed 100,000 admissions at the Korean box office as of Nov. 14, and the film’s box office is north of $700,000. \n\n\tThe feature has attracted notable support from prominent figures in the industry, including Bong Joon Ho, Kim Jee-woon, Yeon Sang-ho, Kim Tae-ri, Kore-eda Hirokazu, Jia Zhangke, BTS member RM and Greta Lee.\n\t\n\n\tDirector Bong hosted a talk session focused on the film, building on his long-standing admiration for Yoon’s work. He has previously described her as one of three masters at directing child actors alongside Abbas Kiarostami and Kore-eda.\n\n\n\tDuring the session, Bong said the film qualified as a masterpiece after his second viewing. “There was so much to dig into in this film, and I even felt professional jealousy,” he said. He highlighted Yoon’s distinctive approach to storytelling, noting that she allows audiences to gradually understand the narrative through extended observation rather than direct explanation. He singled out the car wash sequence as particularly striking, calling it “the sequence of the year.” Bong jokingly referred to himself as the “Seoul Branch Chief of Director Yoon Ga-eun’s Fan Club.”\n\n\tOther industry figures have added their endorsements. Kim Jee-woon called it “this year’s best independent film,” praising Yoon’s perspective as warm and profound while declaring her the future of Korean cinema. Yeon Sang-ho described it as a masterpiece from a filmmaker who “walks to a different rhythm.”\n\t\n\n\tChinese director Jia Zhangke added: “As one of the very first audiences of the film, I would confidently recommend it.” Actor Kim Tae-ri said the film was extraordinary and hoped more audiences could experience it, while Park Jung-min remarked that “something incredible has been born.” Greta Lee simply called it “a perfect film.”\n\n\tThe title has gained traction on the festival circuit, collecting jury and audience awards at Pingyao International Film Festival’s Crouching Tigers section, along with the Fipresci Award at the Warsaw Film Festival. The film recently played at the Cork International Film Festival’s Momentum section.\n\n\tUpcoming festival appearances include competition slots at QCinema International Film Festival’s Asian Next Wave section, Festival des 3 Continents Nantes, Tokyo FILMeX, Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival and Red Sea International Film Festival. The film has also earned a nomination for Best Youth Film at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA coalition of 46 prominent Indian independent filmmakers has issued a joint statement demanding equitable theatrical opportunities for indie cinema, citing the restricted Indian release of Kanu Behl‘s Cannes-selected feature “Agra” as emblematic of systemic challenges facing the sector.\n\n\tThe appeal follows the Nov. 14 theatrical bow of “Agra,” which was relegated to limited and inconvenient showtimes despite strong audience interest and extensive media coverage. Signatories include Payal Kapadia, Rima Das, Nandita Das, Ajitpal Singh, Alankrita Shrivastava, Megha Ramaswamy, Raam Reddy, Ruchi Narain, Shaunak Sen, Shonali Bose, Varun Grover and Vasan Bala.\n\t\n\n\t“Update on ‘Agra’, the film: We’re being denied shows because of the so called ‘big blockbusters’ and because small films ‘don’t fit into’ multiplex chain programming. It’s up to you the audience now! Speak up and tag the chains. Say that you want to see the film!,” Behl had posted on the eve of the release. “Spread the word. Or this will just go on and on. And the space for anything else other than mindless ‘infantilised cinema’ will disappear.”The indie filmmakers’ statement emphasizes that the issue extends beyond a single release, noting that independent features across India routinely face barriers to theatrical exhibition. Key challenges identified include severely restricted screening slots, morning-only or weekday-exclusive showtimes, abrupt cancellations, opaque allocation processes and multiplex prioritization of big-budget releases.\n\n\n\tThe filmmakers also highlighted an emerging obstacle in the streaming sector, where platforms increasingly base acquisition decisions on box office performance, creating what they describe as an inequitable cycle that limits indie films’ theatrical exposure while simultaneously demanding commercial results.\n\n\tThe coalition outlined five specific requests: guaranteed accessible evening screenings for every independent release, transparent criteria for screen allocation, regular monthly or quarterly indie showcase programming, support from cultural institutions and alternative venues, and streaming acquisition policies independent of theatrical performance metrics.\n\t\n\n\tThe statement contextualizes these demands within Indian independent cinema’s international impact over the past decade, noting that films from the sector have premiered at major festivals including Cannes, Venice, Berlin, Sundance, Locarno, Rotterdam and Busan, expanding global perceptions of Indian storytelling.\n\n\t“We offer this statement with respect, seriousness and urgency,” the filmmakers wrote. “No antagonist. No blame. Only the collective need for a healthier ecosystem. Indian independent cinema has shaped how the world sees us. Now, we must shape a system where our own audiences can see us too.”\n\n\tThe complete list of signatories in alphabetical order: Aamir Bashir, Aditya Kripalani, Aditya Vikram Sengupta, Ajitpal Singh, Akshay Indikar, Alankrita Shrivastava, Anuparna Roy, Arati Kadav, Ashim Ahluwalia, Bauddhayan Mukherji, Bhaskar Hazarika, Chaitanya Tamhane, Devashish Makhija, Dibakar Das Roy, Diwa Shah, Dominic Megam Sangma, Gurvinder Singh, Haobam Paban Kumar, Hardik Mehta, Honey Trehan, Kanu Behl, Karan Gour, Karan Talwar, Karan Tejpal, Leena Yadav, Megha Ramaswamy, Nandita Das, Payal Kapadia, Pradip Kurbah, Prateek Vats, Q (Quashik Mukherjee), Raam Reddy, Rahat Mahajan, Rima Das, Ronny Sen, Ruchi Narain, Sumit Purohit, Safdar Rahman, Sarvnik Kaur, Shaunak Sen, Sharukhkhan Chavada, Shlok Sharma, Shonali Bose, Tanuja Chandra, Varun Grover and Vasan Bala.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney+ has forged a groundbreaking partnership with CJ ENM‘s Korean streaming platform Tving, introducing bundled subscription packages that combine global and local content at discounted rates — a first-of-its-kind collaboration between an international and local streaming service in South Korea.\n\n\tThe deal offers Korean consumers two bundle options launching immediately: a Disney+,Tving and local streamer Wavve package at KRW21,500 ($14.60) monthly, representing up to 37% savings compared to separate subscriptions, and a Disney+-Tving bundle at KRW18,000 ($12.30) monthly, offering 23% savings against the combined cost of Disney+ Standard and Tving Standard.\n\t\n\n\tThe bundled plans provide access to Disney’s franchise content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, National Geographic and Hulu, alongside Disney+ Korean originals and popular Korean dramas, variety programming and entertainment from Tving, Wavve and CJ ENM.\n\n\n\tThe Korean deal follows a content partnership in Japan. Since Nov. 5, Disney+ Japan has begun rolling out up to 60 Korean titles, including CJ ENM hits “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God (Goblin)” and “Reply 1988.” Tving original series “Dear X” premiered exclusively on Disney+ Japan on Nov. 6, marking the platform’s first major push into the Japanese market.\n\n\tTony Zameczkowski, senior VP and general manager of direct-to-consumer for Asia Pacific at Walt Disney Company, said: “By partnering with Tving and Wavve, we’re expanding our reach, enriching the content ecosystem, and offering greater value to consumers. We’re also proud to support the global journey of Korean content and hope this sets a new standard for cross-border collaboration in the streaming industry.”\n\t\n\n\tKim Soyoun, managing director of Walt Disney Company Korea, added: “This collaboration not only enhances the value we offer to Korean consumers but also strengthens our role as a bridge between local creativity and global audiences.” \n\n\tTving CEO Julie Choi said: “We also look forward to seeing more Korean stories reach new audiences around the world and be loved by them through our collaboration with Disney+ Japan.” \n\n\tThe partnership arrives as Disney+ continues expanding its Korean content slate with originals including “Moving,” “Low Life” and “Tempest,” along with new formats like mid-form variety series “Weekly Entertainment Arcade.” The platform positions itself as a dual destination for both Disney’s century-long catalog of global entertainment and growing Korean productions.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney has pledged $5 million to help rebuild a park in Altadena that was destroyed by January’s wildfire, with help from the members of the company’s famously innovative Walt Disney Imagineering department.\n\n\tCharles White Park, which sits just off Fair Oaks Avenue near the Pasadena-Altadena border, will include “a new community center and an enhanced playground infused with Disney magic to bring joy to families in the area for its anticipated reopening in 2026,” Disney said.\n\t\n\n\tDisney disclosed Monday that some Imagineers have already been working with Los Angeles County officials on the site planning, landscape architecture and playground design for the five-acre site. Disney is supporting the rebuilding of the park as part of its $15 million donation to Los Angeles area wildfire relief that followed the wind-whipped infernos that devastated Altadena in the foothills above Pasadena  as well as across the county in Pacific Palisades near the Santa Monica coastline.\n\n\n\tDisney is also helping to rebuild two other park sites in Altadena that were nearly destroyed by the fire. A number of staff in Walt Disney Imagineering lost homes during the Altadena and Palisades fire, adding urgency and purpose to their work.\n\n\t“Los Angeles has been home to the Walt Disney Company since its founding more than a century ago, which is why we felt a special responsibility to help this community rebuild in the aftermath of the devastating wildfires earlier this year,” said Disney chief Bob Iger. “I’m incredibly proud of our Imagineers who are volunteering their time and talents to help reimagine cherished public spaces like Charles White Park. Their work is not only a testament to Disney’s creative spirit, but also to our deep commitment to our neighbors throughout this region. We hope this effort brings comfort, joy, and a sense of renewal to the Altadena community for years to come.”\n\t\n\n\tKathryn Barger, member of the LA County Board of Supervisors, praised Disney for its donation of money as well as resources via the Imagineers.\n\n\t“Knowing that Disney’s Imagineers will pour their time, talent, and compassion into Altadena’s recovery is truly inspiring,” said Barger. “Their work on Charles White Park and other community spaces is more than restoration. It is a gift of hope, joy, and healing for families who have endured so much this year.”\n\n\tDisney has also embraced a longstanding Christmas tradition that kicks off the holiday season for many families in the wider area. Per the Disney annnouncement:\n\n\t“Disney is also supporting one of Altadena’s most cherished traditions: The Christmas Tree Lane Lighting Ceremony and Winter Festival on December 6. First organized in 1920, this event is one of the oldest large-scale outdoor Christmas light displays in the world. The company will bring some signature Disney Magic to the lighting event, including character appearances, festive moments, and meaningful volunteer opportunities to support families in need during the season. Disney also will help support the community’s annual toy drive with a donation of more than 1,000 toys that evening.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJosh O’Connor has mixed feelings about hosting “Saturday Night Live.”\n\n\t“It’s an easy yes because it’s like, iconic and the coolest and the biggest honor ever to be asked,” O’Connor said Monday night at the Los Angeles premiere of “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. “But I’m also, like, shitting myself.”\n\n\tThe “Challengers” star is set to host “SNL” on Dec. 13 with musical guest Lily Allen. In preparation for the big night, O’Connor reached out to Paul Mescal, who hosted on Dec. 7, 2024, for advice, and plans to ask his “Wake Up Dead Man” co-star, Josh Brolin, who previously hosted the show three times, for tips. \n\t\n\n\tHowever, O’Connor added he isn’t holding his breath for any Earth-shaking guidance. \n\n\n\t“Everyone’s been kind of useless in different ways,” O’Connor joked. “Paul started off by being incredibly encouraging and reassuring, and then, I guess, forgot the brief, and by the end was like, ‘Then you have a panic attack.’ I’m just excited, and I’m so honored to be asked.”\n\n\tBrolin told Variety that he’s advised many young stars before they made their “SNL” debut, including Glen Powell, who hosted the show on Nov. 15. He added that one of the only people who didn’t need the help was Timothée Chalamet, who hosted for the first time in 2020.\n\n\t“The only person I didn’t give advice to is Timothée, and Timothée was brilliant. And I thought Glenn was really good,” Brolin shared. “But I’m just like, lend yourself to it entirely. Don’t pull back. Don’t try to be cool. Be stupid. Goes all the way with the stupid, and you’ll have a really good time.”\n\t\n\n\tO’Connor stars in “Wake Up Dead Man” as former boxer turned priest Jud Duplenticy, who is sent to help Brolin’s charismatic clergyman Jefferson Wicks. Wick’s circle includes churchgoer Martha Delacroix (Glenn Close), groundskeeper Samson Holt (Thomas Haden Church), lawyer Vera Draven (Kerry Washington), aspiring lawmaker Cy Draven (Daryl McCormack), local physician Nat Sharp (Jeremy Renner), concert cellist Simone Vivane (Cailee Spaeny) and writer Lee Ross (Andrew Scott). Series star Daniel Craig returns as debonair detective Benoit Blanc, who must solve a murder mystery in the church community.\n\n\t“Wake Up Dead Man,” Rian Johnson‘s third “Knives Out” installment, hits theaters on Nov. 26 as part of a limited two-week theatrical run. The film then comes to Netflix on Dec. 12.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Central Hollywood Neighborhood Council offered a unanimous vote of support Monday evening for the ArcLight Hollywood and Cinerama Dome‘s Conditional Use Permit for serving alcoholic beverages, moving the theaters one step closer to once again screening films.\n\n\tLand use consultant Elizabeth Petersen-Gower, who is working with the theater complex owners, known as Dome Center for LLC Robinson Property Group, told the neighborhood council, “We’re very excited to be here at this point. The approval of the conditional use permit will be the next big step in the ArcLight Theater and the Cinerama Dome reopening,” Petersen-Gower said.\n\t\n\n\t“The family’s committed to redeveloping the property and getting it up and running again. I think you can see a real commitment and direction that they used in bringing Blue Note to the property as well,” she continued, referring to the Forman family of theater owners.\n\n\n\tWhen Variety asked if she could share the timetable for reopening, she said, “I will be able to soon. The entitlements are a big part of that and that is moving very smoothly.” \n\n\tPetersen-Gower emphasized that reopening the Dome and ArcLight with a restaurant and liquor license would be a benefit to the community. “The project will not adversarily affect adjacent properties or the surrounding neighborhood,” she told the council. “The community plan recognizes Hollywood’s internationally known role as a center for media and entertainment, and proposes strategies to safeguard land for media and entertainment related uses.”\n\n\tWork has been ongoing on the complex since the Blue Note jazz club opened in the same Sunset Boulevard development.\n\t\n\n\tThe vote of support follows a June zoning hearing in advance of the Blue Note opening. The neighborhood council’s role is to advise officials such as city council members, and the neighborhood council cannot pass laws or approve conditional use permits.\n\n\tThe Central Hollywood Neighborhood Council agenda item was to consider a possible action to write a letter of support or opposition for a Conditional Use Permit for “the continued sale and dispensing of a full line of alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption in conjunction with the existing theater and restaurant at 6360 W. Sunset Blvd.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn this week’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart went after Donald Trump for his scattered response to the thousands of emails released last week in relation to the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\n\tStewart opened his monologue by poking fun at one of the most viral messages among roughly 20,000 Epstein emails released on Nov. 12. The email is from Epstein’s brother Mark, telling him to ask former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon if “Putin has the photos of Trump blowing Bubba.”\n\t\n\n\t“And I know what you’re probably thinking: ‘Jeffrey Epstein had a brother?'” Stewart joked. “He did! Apparently. And to the second thing that you might be thinking.” Stewart let a news clip finish his thought: “Mark Epstein released a statement clarifying that the name ‘Bubba’ was not a reference to former president Bill Clinton.”\n\n\n\tThe late-night pundit added, “Thank you for clearing that up. No further questions, your honor.”\n\n\tStewart then turned to Trump’s drastic pivot in support of releasing the Epstein files after months of fighting the movement to make them public. He played a soundbite from WJHL News examining Trump’s Truth Social post on Sunday Night, which read, “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files because we have nothing to hide.”\n\n\t“If he had nothing to hide, he could have declassified and released these files himself at any time,” Stewart said. “How do I know this? A legal expert named Donald ‘Jurisprudence’ Trump said so.”\n\n\tStewart then cut to a clip of Trump talking to Fox News in 2022: “If you’re the president of the United States, you can declassify just by saying it’s declassified. Even by thinking about it.”\n\t\n\n\t“It’s very clear he does not want these things out there,” Stewart added. “Which is obvious, even from his nonsensical answer in the Oval Office today.”\n\n\tIn a clip from CNN, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, “We have nothing to do with Epstein. The Democrats do. All of his friends were Democrats. You look at Reid Hoffman. You look at Larry Summers, Bill Clinton.”\n\n\tStewart fired back, “We have tried to look at those people, but every time we do, your picture comes up,” before cutting to a photo of Trump and Epstein together.\n\n\tWatch the entire monologue below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Malfoys had a family reunion.\n\n\tJason Isaacs, who played Lucius Malfoy in the “Harry Potter” film series, took to Instagram on Sunday and shared a photo of himself posing with “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” stars Tom Felton and Aidan Close. Felton also starred in the “Harry Potter” films as Isaacs’ on-screen son, Draco Malfoy, and is now reprising the role on Broadway. Close plays Draco’s son, Scorpius Malfoy, in the stage show.\n\t\n\n\t“I came. I saw. He conquered,” Isaacs wrote in the caption of his post. “You had your own giant boots to fill, son, and you burst them at the seams. Balls like ostrich eggs. So brave. So proud. So glad to be there.”\n\n\n\tIn his own post Monday night, Felton wrote, “No one does it quite like the Malfoys – three generations meet for the first time on stage – Needless to say, it was magical… Love you dad [Jason Isaacs] Love you son [Aidan Close].”\n\n\tBack in July, Felton revealed his plans to reprise the role of Draco Malfoy in “The Cursed Child.” After the news broke, Isaacs was quick to support his former co-star on social media.\n\n\t“Can’t wait, son. That’ll be me in the front row with something in my eye,” Isaacs wrote on Instagram. He later added on X: “Tickets booked for November.”\n\n\tFelton began his Broadway run on Nov. 11 and is set to perform for 19 weeks. He told Variety on the Tony Awards red carpet, “The most exciting part is to do it live. It took nine months, more or less, to shoot a film, and this is all compact. This is all reimagined into a very loving, new type of story. And I get to be a dad, which is really fun.”\n",

Chu’s two-part celluloid Oz journey.\nGrande dazzles in a long Glinda-like gown with a pink tulle skirt and tight black bodice. Erivo stunned an arresting in a black floor length gown that blended leather and feathers as only she could. Bailey looked sharp in a black suit with tight Nehru jacket. They were joined by co-stars Michelle Yeoh, Jeff Goldblum, Colman Domingo, Ethan Slater, Marissa Bode, Bowen Yang and more. And everyone dressed up for the occasion. More than one attendee commented that Universal’s all-stops-out approach to promoting “Wicked: For Good” was a welcome dose of old-fashioned movie showmanship.\nAmong the guests were Jane Krakowski, Jimmy Fallon, Gayle King, Nate Burleson, Justina Lupe, Matt Rogers, Mellody Hobson and George Lucas.\nThe Big Apple bow for “Wicked: For Good” follows similar events in São Paulo, Brazil, London, Paris and Singapore. Despite some hiccups (Grande was unable to make it to Brazil because of airplane mechanical issues and was grabbed by a man in Singapore who jumped over barricades onto the carpet), the cast was all smiles in NYC.\nGuests were encouraged to wear “Emerald City Elegance.”\n“For Good” comes a year after the first “Wicked” movie was released. “Wicked” went on to earn more than $746 million in worldwide ticket sales and 10 Oscar nominations, including acting nods for Grande and Erivo as well as one for best picture.\nThe second and final movie sees Elphaba (Erivo) continuing her Wicked Witch of the West crusade to bring down the Wizard (Goldblum) as Glinda’s (Grande) popularity rises as she gets ready to marry Prince Fiyero (Bailey).\nCheck out all the best photos from Monday’s “Wicked: For Good” red carpet below.\n“Wicked: For Good” is in theaters Nov. 21.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Variety via Getty Images\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tStars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande at the “Wicked: For Good” New York Premiere held at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on November 17, 2025 in New York, New York.

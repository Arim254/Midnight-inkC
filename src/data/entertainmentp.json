    "description": "\n\tSinger-songwriter-guitarist Bob Weir, a cornerstone of the Grateful Dead and the San Francisco psychedelic band’s many latter-day offshoots for more",
    "body": "\n\tSinger-songwriter-guitarist Bob Weir, a cornerstone of the Grateful Dead and the San Francisco psychedelic band’s many latter-day offshoots for more than half a century, has died after a long battle with cancer and lung issues, according to a social media post from his family. He was 78. \n\n\tThe post said that Weir had been diagnosed last summer and began treatment three weeks before Dead & Company, a spinoff group of the Grateful Dead, played a weekend of shows at Golden Gate Park to mark the original band’s 60th anniversary. Many fans believed those livestreamed concerts might be the band’s unbilled farewell engagement, but few could have guessed the conditions under which Weir powered through what turned out to be his final gigs. \n\t\n\n\t“It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,” the family statement began. “He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.”\n\n\n\tThe statement continued, “Bobby’s final months reflected the same spirit that defined his life. Diagnosed in July, he began treatment only weeks before returning to his hometown stage for a three-night celebration of 60 years of music at Golden Gate Park. Those performances, emotional, soulful, and full of light, were not farewells, but gifts. Another act of resilience. An artist choosing, even then, to keep going by his own design. As we remember Bobby, it’s hard not to feel the echo of the way he lived. A man driftin’ and dreamin’, never worrying if the road would lead him home. A child of countless trees. A child of boundless seas.”\n\t\n\n\tWeir was just 16 years old when he befriended Jerry Garcia, then a music teacher at a Palo Alto, CA, instrument store, on New Year’s Eve of 1963. The two guitarists formed an old-time music unit, Mother McCree’s Uptown Jug Champions, and went electric with the rock band the Warlocks, before finally taking the name the Grateful Dead in 1965.\n\n\n\tKey to the Dead’s expansive, jam-based sound was the elegant free-form interplay between lead guitarist Garcia and his deft front-line foil Weir, whose unorthodox work transcended the “rhythm guitar” label. His style was rooted in country and blues, but, as he explained in an interview with Alan Paul, it was rooted in an unlikely source.\n\n\t“[M]y dirty little secret is that I learned by trying to imitate a piano, specifically the work of McCoy Tyner in the John Coltrane Quartet,” Weir said. “That caught my ear and lit my flame when I was 17. I just loved what he did underneath Coltrane, so I sat with it for a long time and really tried to absorb it. Of course, Jerry was [also] very influenced by horn players, including Coltrane.”\n\n\tAs a writer, Weir penned a number of songs that became cornerstones of the Dead’s concert repertoire; many were penned with his boyhood friend John Perry Barlow. His best-known compositions included “Sugar Magnolia” (a rare collaboration with Garcia’s writing partner Robert Hunter), “Playing in the Band,” “One More Saturday Night,” “Cassidy,” “The Music Never Stopped,” “Estimated Prophet” and “I Need a Miracle.”\n\n\tWeir was not the dominant vocalist in the group, contributing about a third of the lead vocals, but even when Garcia was assuming those duties, he contributed to the layered harmonies that characterized the band’s most popular work. He took the lead on what is possibly the Dead’s best-known and most iconic song, “Truckin’,” a track from 1970’s “American Beauty” that contains the beloved couplet, “Lately it occurs to me / What a long, strange trip it’s been.”\n\n\tApart from the Dead, Weir recorded three solo albums; the first, 1972’s “Ace,” found him supported by most of the band. As time went on, he was increasingly involved in such band side projects as Kingfish, Bobby and the Midnites and RatDog.\n\t\n\n\tAfter the dissolution of the Grateful Dead following Garcia’s death in August 1995, Weir was a standard bearer in various reunions including shifting lineups featuring the Dead’s core members. He played under the group rubrics the Other Ones, the Dead and Furthur.\n\n\tFollowing 2015’s 50-year celebration Fare Thee Well in Northern California and Chicago, Weir and drummers Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart mounted a new group, Dead & Company, with singer-guitarist John Mayer, for 2015-18 tours.\n\n\tWith the other members of the Grateful Dead, Weir was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.\n\n\tBob Dylan praised Weir’s unorthodox style while describing his love for the group in his book “The Philosophy of Modern Song.” “Then there’s Bob Weir,” wrote Dylan. “A very unorthodox rhythm player. He has his own style, not unlike Joni Mitchell but from a different place. Plays strange, augmented chords and half chords at unpredictable intervals that somehow match up with Jerry Garcia — who plays like Charlie Christian and Doc Watson at the same time.”\n\n\tHe was born Robert Hall Parber in San Francisco on Oct. 17, 1947. His birth parents, both college students, gave him up for adoption. He was raised by his adoptive parents Frederic and Eleanor Weir; the family, thanks to Weir’s work in a Bay Area engineering firm, was wealthy and socially prominent.\n\n\tInitially involved in athletics as a boy, Weir became interested in music after being exposed to jazz by the family nanny. After brief studies on the piano and trumpet that disrupted the household, Weir took up the acoustic guitar at 13.\n\n\tA childhood bout with spinal meningitis and severe dyslexia left him with behavioral problems and poor study habits, and he spent some of his teens in private schools; enrollment at the Fountain Valley school in Colorado, where he met his future lyricist Barlow, led to an interest in cowboy culture that would become an abiding creative influence.\n\n\tThe unruly Weir ultimately returned to the Bay Area, where he was enrolled in Menlo-Atherton High. He began to take a deep interest in folk music, studying guitar with Jerry Kaukonen (soon to become better known as Jorma Kaukonen, lead guitarist of Jefferson Airplane) and founded a folk group, the Uncalled Four, with his classmates.\n\t\n\n\tHowever, Weir’s fateful encounter with Garcia, then a bluegrass banjo picker, at Dana Morgan’s music store led to the formation of a new group; Garcia and Weir, on washtub bass and jug, were joined in the enterprise by Ron McKernan, a grubby 18-year-old blues enthusiast who quickly was dubbed “Pigpen.”\n\n\tBy late 1964, by then under the sway of the Beatles, those musicians were joined by drummer and jazz aficionado Kreutzmann and avant garde bassist Phil Lesh in the rock unit the Warlocks. The band quickly became aligned with the burgeoning hippie counterculture in San Francisco, and played their first date as the Grateful Dead at one of writer Ken Kesey’s LSD-soaked “Acid Tests” in December 1965.\n\n\tA popular early attraction at such local rock ballrooms as the Avalon and the Fillmore, the Dead were signed by label president Joe Smith to Warner Bros. Records, then an old-line pop label trying to contemporize its roster. The group’s self-titled 1967 debut album drew heavily on string band and blues material that dated back to their jug band origins.\n\n\tBy the time the Dead’s more overtly psychedelic sophomore album “Anthem of the Sun” was recorded in 1968 (by which time percussionist Mickey Hart had joined the group), Weir’s presence in the lineup was no longer a certainty: Both he and McKernan were under fire for their unprofessional performances, and the pair were briefly dismissed in mid-1968. However, after a handful of shows without them, the two musicians were back in the fold.\n\n\tThrough 1969, the Dead’s work on records leaned heavily on improvisation and eschewed traditional tight songwriting, with the two-LP package “Live/Dead” serving as a representation of the concert style beloved by the band’s rabid legion of “Dead Head” fans.\n\n\tThey moved into the commercial mainstream with a pair of 1970 releases, “Workingman’s Dead” and “American Beauty,” which were filled with carefully crafted songs. The latter album, the band’s second to reach the national top 30, served as the best showcase to date for Weir’s talents as a singer and writer, and “Truckin’,” which drew its inspiration from a recent Dead drug bust in New Orleans, became an evergreen at free-form FM radio.\n\n\tHowever, a dispute with Robert Hunter over the performance of “Sugar Magnolia” led the lyricist to work exclusively with Garcia, and moving forward Weir wrote primarily with his friend Barlow, who co-authored half the songs on Weir’s solo bow “Ace.”\n\t\n\n\tFollowing a trio of live albums that fulfilled their commitments to Warner Bros. (and the death of McKernan from the consequences of alcoholism in 1972), the Dead inaugurated their own eponymous label, distributed by United Artists. The imprint debuted in 1973 with “Wake of the Flood,” which bore an ambitious 13-minute suite written by Weir. Though their studio albums of the period all reached the top 20, the Dead were wearied by operating their own label, and Grateful Dead Records folded in late 1976.\n\n\tSigned to Clive Davis’ Arista Records in 1977, the Dead initially sold their albums to their devoted Deadheads, who seemed more interested in purchasing tickets to the band’s tribal concerts.\n\n\tWeir, who had issued a 1976 studio set with Kingfish that peaked at No. 50, released his sophomore solo album “Heaven Help the Fool” in 1978; cut in Los Angeles with a cast of studio pros, it was poorly received. A pair of Bobby and the Midnights albums featuring latter-day Dead keyboardist Brent Mydland both failed to reach the top 100 in the early ‘80s.\n\n\tDeadhead loyalty supplied the band with self-sustaining record sales and huge popularity as a concert attraction through the late ‘80s. However, in 1987 – two decades after the release of their debut LP — the group scored a legitimate top 40 hit, “Touch of Grey”; the No. 9 single on aging and survival pushed the album ‘In the Dark,” which contained three Weir-Barlow songs, to No. 6 and double-platinum sales.\n\n\tWhile triumphs like a concert at Egypt’s Great Pyramids and a joint tour with Bob Dylan followed in the immediate wake of that success, the Dead’s next studio album, 1989’s ironically titled “Build to Last,” would be its final set, save for a 1990 concert package.\n\n\tGarcia, who had nearly succumbed to a diabetic coma in the mid-‘80s, had struggled with heroin addiction for years, and he was found dead in a Marin County rehab clinic eight days after his 53rd birthday. In the decades that followed, Weir was a constant in the various acts that reunited former Dead members to perform the classic repertoire.\n\n\tWeir released studio and live sets by RatDog, his collaboration with the late bassist Rob Wasserman, in 2000-01. He issued his third solo album “Blue Mountain,” a roots-based set co-written with singer-songwriter Josh Ritter, via Columbia/Legacy in 2016. (His collaborator Barlow died at 70 in February 2018.)\n\t\n\n\tHe made an appearance at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in 2016 to promote the “Blue Mountain” album, talking about his roots influences. “Jerry and I were huge into Buck Owens particularly — and Dolly Parton, we were both more than smitten,” Weir said.\n\n\tBut his interest in the Western culture ran deeper than that. “When I was a kid I was drawn to the cowboy culture and the American West,” he continued. “My folks used to take us up to Squaw Valley, and in the winter it was a ski resort, but in the ‘50s and early ‘60s in the summer it was a cattle ranch… I spent a lot of time at the stable, and the old cowpokes took a shine to me, showing me how to ride and a few of the skills a young cowpoke should know… When I was 15, after one summer I thought it’d be a terribly romantic thing to do to run around and be a cowboy, and so found my way out to Wyoming and got work on a ranch, where I was in a bunkhouse with a bunch of old guys who had grown up in an era before radio had gotten that far, to Wyoming. So the very notion of how to spend an evening was to pop a cork and tell stories and sing songs. I was the kid with the guitar, so I had to listen to the melody and the words and figure out where’s the next chord coming in and what it’s gonna be and be there with it, or I was going to get a little abuse. It was great ear training for a young musician. At the same time, I got steeped in a culture that just stuck with me.”\n\n\n\n\n\tIn late 2018, the singer-guitarist took to the road performing Grateful Dead material and other songs with Wolf Bros, a new trio with bassist (and Blue Note Records prexy) Don Was and former RatDog drummer Jay Lane.\n\n\tDead & Company, the group Weir founded with other former Grateful Dead members and John Mayer to continue performing the catalog of the defunct group, had had a robust presence on the concert scene for years, before and even after a farewell tour in summer 2023. In 2024 and again in 2025, Dead & Company did highly successful multi-week residencies at Sphere in Las Vegas, and became at least as identified with the new venue as U2, who did the opening engagement.\n\n\tIn a June 2024 interview with Variety, Weir spoke excitedly about the just-begun debut Sphere engagement, putting the lie to any belief that, as one of the older members of Dead & Company, he might be less excited about the new technology powering the show.\n\t\n\n\t“Working from the stage at the Sphere is like opera,” he said. “The storytelling facility there is really beyond about anything else. Every artist of any tribe is first and foremost a storyteller. And you can’t get this anywhere else right now. The story being told in the visuals is tangentially attached to the story that we’re telling from on stage. And from what I can, from what I can gather, it’s pretty satisfying to the audience…  If you go back 50, 60 years to the Acid Tests (Ken Kesey’s visionary events in San Francisco), when they had those overhead projectors and were doing light shows with clear glass plates and oils and all that kind of stuff, they had that stuff dancing in time with the music. And I want to see if we can get that kind of thing happening… I think we’re only scratching the surface here.”\n\n\tTalking about the ILM-designed opening and closing of the Sphere shows, which went from the group’s Haight-Asbury neighborhood to the outer limits of the galaxy and back again, Weir quipped, “I kind of like being in outer space. Makes me feel right at home!”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDead & Company at Sphere in Las Vegas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChris Willman/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn-between the two Sphere residencies, Dead & Company also performed at the MusiCares Persons of the Year gala in January 20, where the core lineup of the Grateful Dead, dead and alive, was being honored. \n\n\t“Longevity was never a major concern of ours,” Weir said in his acceptance speech at the MusiCares gala — getting a big chuckle out of the audience, given the group celebrating the 60th anniversary, even though he didn’t deliver it as a laugh line. “Lighting folks up and spreading joy through the music was all we really had in mind, and we got plenty of that done.”\n\n\tFurther on in his speech, Weir said, “The road is a rough existence, as plainly evidenced by the simple fact that there aren’t all that many of my old bandmates here tonight to receive this recognition,” Weir said, standing alongside fellow founding Dead member Mickey Hart. “But thank you, Grahame Lesh and Trixie Garcia and Justin Kreutzmann for representing your dads here,” he added, acknowledging the recent passing of Phil Lesh — who died shortly after the MusiCares honor was announced — as well as the long-gone Garcia and the recently retired Bill Kreutzmann.\n\t\n\n\tWeir acknowledged at the outset of his speech that he might not get far into it without a lapse, mentioning that he grew up dyslexic, although he came through just fine in a monolog that made up for some of the lost time of rarely or never speaking from the stage. \n\n\t“If making music is what you’re gonna be doing, you’ll find that you can make considerably more thunder if you can find folks to play with, and learn to work with and play off of them, and let them play you,” he told the audience. “That’s what the Grateful Dead did over the years, and success eventually came to us. All along, my old pal Jerry used to say, ‘You get some, you give some back’ — and so we did. From early on it was more than apparent to us that we could be of substantial benefit to our broader community – and have big fun doing it. We also learned right away that it was an honor and a privilege to be in this position, something we never took lightly.”\n\n\n\n\n\tWeir is survived by his wife Natascha and their two daughters.\n\n\tThe family’s statement concluded: “There is no final curtain here, not really. Only the sense of someone setting off again. He often spoke of a three-hundred-year legacy, determined to ensure the songbook would endure long after him. May that dream live on through future generations of Dead Heads. And so we send him off the way he sent so many of us on our way: with a farewell that isn’t an ending, but a blessing. A reward for a life worth livin’…\n\n\t“His loving family, Natascha, Monet, and Chloe, request privacy during this difficult time and offer their gratitude for the outpouring of love, support, and remembrance. May we honor him not only in sorrow, but in how bravely we continue with open hearts, steady steps, and the music leading us home. Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings.”\n\n\t(With additional reporting by Chris Willman)\n",

    "body": "\n\tTom Cherones, the director and producer best known for working on 81 of the first 86 episodes of “Seinfeld” during the show’s first five years, has died. He was 86.\n\n\tCherones died on Jan. 5 at his home in Florence, Ore., from Alzheimer’s disease, a family spokesperson announced. \n\n\tCherones’s first directing credit for “Seinfeld” was the sitcom’s second episode, “The Stakeout,” which aired in May 1990. Known for wearing Hawaiian shirts on set, he contributed to the show’s visual language by shooting multi-camera in a way that achieved a more cinematic look than the standard sitcom aesthetic. He went on to direct many of the show’s more experimental episodes, including “The Chinese Restaurant,” “The Parking Garage,” and “The Contest.”\n\t\n\n\tCherones appeared on camera once during his run on “Seinfeld,” playing “the director” in the fourth-season episode “The Pilot,” in which he says he was “gonna rip that little guy [Jason Alexander’s George Costanza] a new one.”\n\n\n\tCherones received six Emmy nominations for “Seinfeld” and, in 1993, shared the coveted award for outstanding comedy series with creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, among others. He also won a DGA Award and Golden Globe for the sitcom. \n\n\tBorn on Sept. 11, 1939, in Tuscaloosa, Ala., Cherones graduated from the University of New Mexico with a degree in journalism in 1961. After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy until 1965, he earned a master’s degree in broadcast and film communications from the University of Alabama in 1967. \n\n\tCherones produced and directed several programs and series episodes at various PBS affiliates before joining station WQED in Pittsburgh, where he worked on productions including “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.” \n\t\n\n\tHe moved to Los Angeles in 1975 and worked as a production manager for “General Hospital” and “Welcome Back, Kotter.” He later became an independent producer, working with Warner Bros., ABC, CBS, Paramount, Lorimar and Mary Tyler Moore Productions. In 1980, he wrote and produced the feature-length film “Two of Hearts” for cable and public television. His credits also include “Caroline in the City,” “NewsRadio,” “Ellen,” “Boston Common,” “Growing Pains,” “Ladies Man,” “The Pitts” and “Desperate Housewives.” \n\n\tCherones eventually returned to the University of Alabama, where he taught a class in television production for 12 years, pro bono. \n\n\tCherones was married to Bobby Cherones, with whom he had two children, and later to Joyce Keener until her death in 2006. He is survived by his wife, Carol E. Richards; his daughter, Susan Cherones Lee and her husband Daniel; son, Scott Cherones and his wife, Linda; and grandchildren Jessa and Thomas Cherones, as well as several brothers and sisters-in-law, nieces and nephews.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSome of the biggest names in Hollywood weren’t afraid to act up on Friday night.\n\n\tAhead of this year’s Golden Globe awards, Variety held an invite-only celebration marking the 23rd season of its “Actors on Actors” series. At the hallowed Polo Lounge inside the Beverly Hills Hotel, industry players and many of the year’s most celebrated stars and filmmakers came to toast the franchise that pairs notable thespians for uncensored conversations about the craft.\n\t\n\n\tSydney Sweeney, Kate Hudson, Teyana Taylor, Dwayne Johnson, Adam Sandler, Jesse Plemons, Ethan Hawke, Tonatiuh, Connor Storrie, Odessa A’zion, Kumail Nanjiani and many more showed to the event hosted by Variety’s co-president and co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh and Golden Globes president Helen Hoehne. The evening was sponsored by the Aman Beverly Hills and Morgan Stanley. \n\n\n\tSeason 23 was exceptional. For the first time, Leonardo DiCaprio allowed a fellow A-lister in Jennifer Lawrence to quiz him about his process. Julia Roberts let the world know how long and meaningful her friendship was with Sean Penn, while discussing her most indelible turn since “Erin Brockovich,” in Luca Guadagnino’s “After the Hunt.” Kate Hudson shared with Jeremy Allen White the small devotions that helped her achieve the most compelling dramatic performance of her career in “Song Sung Blue.” These moments and many more proved worthy of a fabulous pre-Globes bash.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHikari, Ethan Hawke and Odessa A’zion at the Variety & Golden Globes Pre-Golden Globes Party  presented by Aman Beverly Hills and Morgan Stanley.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“There’s tremendous value in ‘Actors on Actors’ because of how intimate it is,” said, Hoehne, who was seen chatting with Johnson and Adrien Brody two days prior to her organization’s big Sunday telecast. “You find out who they are, what they love, how they work. So many of the pairings are unexpected, but it’s always rewarding.”As tuna tartare cones and mini grilled cheese circulated on passed plates, Hudson and her power manager Jason Weinberg delighted the crowd. Eva Victor, the breakout writer-director-star of “Sorry, Baby,” met the town’s obsession Storrie (of “Heated Rivalry” fame). Sweeney cut a glamorous figure in a shimmering black dress as Sandler (“Jay Kelly”) took a victory lap for what many have called a career-defining role. Billionaire Kevin Ulrich, who sold MGM to Amazon, gave a best-dressed effort in a killer double-breasted heather grey suit from J. Crew (the iconic apparel company he acquired in 2020).\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tConnor Storrie and Eva Victor at the Variety & Golden Globes Pre-Golden Globes Party presented by Aman Beverly Hills and Morgan Stanley.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\tVariety’s co-president and publisher Dea Lawrence held court alongside associate publisher Donna Pennestri, with film luminaries like Sony Pictures Classics heads Tom Bernard and Michael Barker. Co-editor-in-chief Cynthia Littleton mixed with “Marty Supreme” breakout star A’zion and powerhouse young star Kathryn Newton (Searchlight’s “Ready or Not 2: Here I Come”).The industry was represented by Sue Kroll, head of marketing for Amazon MGM; Eldridge Industries chair Todd Boehly; Management 360 partner Beau Swayze; Weinberg; fashion entrepreneur Natalie Bond Bloomingdale; and the Prada-clad communications whiz Ashley Hansen, partner at Forward Global (formerly of Archewell, Universal and Annapurna ). Guests received a gift bag marking the anticipated opening of the Aman Beverly Hills. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTonatiuh and Jesse Plemons at the Variety & Golden Globes Pre-Golden Globes Party, presented by Aman Beverly Hills and Morgan Stanley.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSetoodeh, another dressed in Prada, spent his night at the door greeting actors (the point of the evening, after all).\n\n\t“With ‘Actors on Actors’ we try to curate the best portfolio of awards season, and the franchise has become a phenomenon online. This year was our biggest ever, in partnership with CNN, and that’s something to celebrate in addition to this incredible work on screen.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatt Rogers has apologized for previous comments urging voters not to donate to Texas Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett’s U.S. Senate campaign, after the remarks sparked online backlash.\n\n\t“Hey everybody. I hear the response and I am taking every bit of it to heart, I promise,” the comedian and “Las Culturistas” podcast co-host wrote on his Instagram Story on Saturday. “Transparency and candor matter to me, especially on the podcast. I’m a very progressive person who cares deeply about winning these elections, but my phrasing was not right. I will be more thoughtful! I really do promise.” \n\t\n\n\tRogers continued, “I have great respect and admiration for Rep. Crockett, and I regret that my words suggested otherwise. I just want us to win and I will be better at finding ways to help.” \n\n\n\tOn a recent episode of the “Las Culturistas” podcast, co-hosted by Rogers and “SNL” alum Bowen Yang, the duo discussed their political views amid the current climate, including predictions for the 2028 presidential election and the future of the Democratic Party. Rogers said he does not believe California Gov. Gavin Newsom will emerge as the party’s 2028 presidential nominee.\n\n\t“Any time a politician is making it too obviously about themselves, I’m already done. And don’t waste your money sending to Jasmine Crockett. Do not do it. Don’t do it, you’re going to waste your money,” Rogers said, looking into the camera. Yang responded, “I must agree,” before Rogers elaborated on his point moments later.\n\n\tRogers said he fears the party could “flop by putting up whatever everyone said they hated in the beginning,” describing that scenario as nominating “an establishment California Democrat.” “It doesn’t work,” he said.\n\t\n\n\tRogers further explained his thoughts on Crockett, saying on the podcast, “Let me just qualify the Jasmine Crockett thing. She’s not going to win a Senate seat in Texas, you guys. If Beto O’Rourke couldn’t do it, Jasmine Crockett is not going to do it.” He continued, “It’s nothing against her, it’s just that she is a politician, in that she is very well-defined already, and it’s my opinion that we’re going to need someone who is less defined at this moment that rises up.”\n\n\tOn Saturday, Yang reposted Roger’s statement to his Instagram Story and wrote, “Should not have cursorily weighed in on this. Understanding the platform and will use it more responsibly.” \n\n\tRead Roger and Yang’s statements below:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor Silicon Valley in 2026, is it a time of Renaissance or a return to the Dark Ages? AMC Network‘s “The Audacity” aims to probe all the power, drama and influence that exudes from San Jose and environs.\n\n\tStars Billy Magnussen and Simon Helberg took part in Variety‘s annual summit at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Jan. 7 to preview the dramedy set to bow April 12 on AMC Network. Created by Jonathan Glatzer, an alum of AMC’s “Better Call Saul” and HBO’s “Succession,” “The Audacity” revolves around an aspiring tech CEO character played by Magnussen and a successful but deeply alienated founder and inventor played Helberg. \n\t\n\n\tDan McDermott, chief content officer for AMC Networks and president of AMC Studios, and “The Audacity” executive producer Gina Mingacci also took part in the session that is featured on today’s episode of Variety‘s “Strictly Business” podcast.\n\n\n\t“This show is a throwback in a lot of ways to the origins of AMC storytelling with shows like ‘Mad Men’ and ‘Breaking Bad,’ ‘Better Call Saul,’ ‘Killing Eve,’ ” McDermott explains. “We focus on three primary things: One is lightning-in-a-bottle characters that can break out and become part of the cultural conversation. We can put them on a billboard and everybody will know that’s Duncan [Magnussen’s character] from ‘The Audacity.’ The second is that they take the audience into a unique world or subculture that we either haven’t seen portrayed or haven’t seen portrayed in this particular way. And the third is we want to be entertaining and fun, of course, but we also want our shows to have a real cultural meaning and ballast and be about something important.”\n\t\n\n\tMagnussen’s enthusiasm for his role as the leader of an upstart data-mining firm is palpable. He was immediately drawn to the subject and bowled over by Glatzer’s scripts.\n\n\t“There’s times in history where there’s a Renaissance and Silicon Valley is one of those times in our modern era which is defining humanity,” he observed. “What better place to make a dark comedy than in that place that develops our society at this point. For me, 20 years in this industry, you see the script that Jonathan Glatzer wrote and you’re just like, ‘Damn, this is fantastic.’ “\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Strictly Business’ host Cynthia Littleton with ‘The Audacity’ stars Simon Helberg and Billy Magnussen, AMC Networks’ Dan McDermott and executive producer Gina Mingacci  (Photo by Brenton Ho/Variety via Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariety via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHelberg was pressed on whether he did a lot of research on Big Tech and AI to bring his character to life. “I did not have to research to loneliness,” he quipped.\n\n\t“My character, Martin, like many people probably in the Valley is a bit of a maladjusted genius. Went to Stanford at 15, made a chunk of money early on in tech, and now he spends every waking minute locked in his garage with an AI companion that he’s developing to help alienated teenagers,” Helberg explained. “But he has his own alienated teenager daughter who he completely neglects and all the other people around him too. He’s a bit of a recluse. And there’s loneliness at the heart of all the characters, and they’re all trying to connect, and they’re trying to connect through technology, which has some pitfalls.”\n\n\t“The Audacity” is a big swing for AMC and the producers at a time when it’s extremely hard to launch wholly original concepts amid the crush of IP-based material that swirls around linear and streaming TV. Mingacci, a former AMC executive who executive produced the BBC America/AMC drama “Killing Eve,” said that high hurdle is all the more reason to pursue fresh and distinctive projects.\n\n\t“It actually was the same challenge as ‘Killing Eve,’ which is, we do not have as much money as everyone else has, not as much time to make it, but you want to be here. You want to be playing here and hopefully we’ve delivered on that,” Mingacci said. “There is no one better than AMC to make morally complex characters come to life. And those are very specific shows that are hard to get made right now.”\n\t\n\n\tThe episode also features highlights of Variety‘s CES conversation with Anthony Wood, founder, chairman and CEO of Roku.\n\n\t(Pictured top: ‘The Audacity’ stars Simon Helberg and Billy Magnussen with AMC Networks’ Dan McDermott)\n",

    "description": "\n\tIn a statement probably anyone could have seen coming, Richard Grenell, the controversial president of Washington, D.C.’s Kennedy Center, spoke out ",
    "body": "\n\tIn a statement probably anyone could have seen coming, Richard Grenell, the controversial president of Washington, D.C.’s Kennedy Center, spoke out to claim that it was the organization’s leadership that decided to end ties with the Washington National Opera, not the other way around.\n\n\tGrenell’s tweets on the subject Saturday followed by a day the opera company’s announcement Friday that it would be taking its programming elsewhere. Opera leaders had said that it was an amicable split, and made no mention of the political turmoil causing many artists to cancel their Kennedy Center engagements, leaving few “name” acts on the building’s 2026 calendar.\n\t\n\n\t“We have spent millions of dollars to support the Washington Opera’s exclusivity, and yet they were still millions of dollars in the hole — and getting worse,” Grenell wrote in a lengthy statement on X. “Having an exclusive Opera was just not financially smart. And our patrons clearly wanted a refresh,” the Trump-appointed president added.\n\n\n\tHis assertions that the WNO had operated in the hole for years stood in contrast to previous statements given by opera leadership that ticket sales had declined from a standard 80-90% of capacity to 60% since the Trump administration effectively took over the center last February.\n\n\tGrenell also claimed that his X account had been hacked after he first posted his side of the story. “I have alerted @X that someone hacked my account last night — and deleted my content on our Opera announcement and media corrections. X will find the hacker and deal with him/her… The Left continues to try and silence people they don’t agree with – but they will never succeed.”\n\t\n\n\tHaving apparently regained control of his X account Saturday, Grenell used it to express anger with media outlets that had reported on Friday that it was the Washington National Opera that wanted to move out. He send out a response to the New York Times’ Peter Baker, who had tweeted a link to his coverage along with the message: “The storied Washington National Opera decides to leave the Kennedy Center where it has played since 1971, perhaps the most significant artistic rebuke yet to Trump’s campaign to remake the facility in his image and attach his name to it.”\n\n\tResponded Grenell on Saturday: “You never do journalism, Peter. You always do partisan attacks on Republicans. You don’t have enough integrity to correct your tweet. So here’s a snippet from the Opera Board Chair noting who asked for the separation first.” He then attached a screen shot of what appeared to be a private communication with the opera leadership, which read: “We have, since November 8th, at Ambassador Grenell’s invitation, been seeking to have meaningful discussion toward how we can amicably bring forward the termination of the Affiliation Agreement. This was endorsed by both our EC on November 10th and Board on December 11th…”\n\n\n\tCenter spokesperson Roma Davari also tweeted a statement saying it was their decision to end the 45-year-old relationship with the opera company. “When financial commitments are not met year over year, we have to make tough decisions for the financial health of the Trump Kennedy Center,” she tweeted. “Given the longstanding financial strain, it has become necessary for us to part ways to protect the best interests of the Center.”\n\n\tWhichever party prompted the coming severance of the relationship, both the center and the opera board seem to be in favor of it, and to acknowledge the relationship has not been recently financially successful. Some supporters of the opera have put that down to many of its patrons being reluctant to support the center since Trump took it over at the beginning of his second term, although Grenell went to pains in some of his tweets to contend that the relationship was unprofitable going back years.\n\n\tGrenell wrote, “Fact: The exclusive Opera contract cost the Trump Kennedy Center $64 million over the last 10 years — with their expenses being double their revenues. We were very pleased that the current Opera leadership was so willing to end their exclusivity. Patrons win: Greater variety.”\n\t\n\n\tConcerning more recent financial details, Grenell tweeted that “the Washington Opera finished FY 2025 with a $7.2 million deficit, not accounting for the $5.8 million additional expenses we gave them. Additionally, Washington Opera ticket sales in 2024 comprised only 4% of total revenue across the Center – making the Opera 8% of combined revenue, but 16% of combined expenses for us.”\n\nThe Trump Kennedy Center has made the decision to end the EXCLUSIVE partnership with the Washington Opera so that we can have the flexibility and funds to bring in operas from around the world and across the U.S.Having an EXCLUSIVE relationship has been extremely expensive and…— Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) January 10, 2026\n\n\n\tIn an interview with the Guardian in November, the WNO’s director, Francesca Zambello, said there had been a 40% drop in ticket sales since Trump installed himself as of the Kennedy Center and spoke of “shattered” donor confidence. She said at the time, “People send me back their the season brochure shredded in an envelope and say: ‘Never, never, will I return: while he’s in power.’” She said in that interview that performances by the opera had run at 80-90% of capacity before the political takeover at the beginning of 2025, and since had been reduced to 60%.\n\n\tIt may or may not be coincidental that the screenshot Grenell posted suggesting that he had proposed the breakup dated that as having happened in November, the same month that Zambello did the interview openly discussing the marked drop in ticket sales since what the Guardian called a “Trump coup.”\n\n\tAlthough engagements have been canceled due to the political firestorm and reporting has indicated low attendance for many of the programs going on — with an October report in the Washington Post bearing the headline “Kennedy Center ticket sales have plummeted since Trump takeover” — Grenell’s tweets on Saturday claimed that the center just enjoyed “a record-breaking fundraising year.”\n\n\tIt’s not clear whether the Washington National Opera will continue to have its spring season take place at the Kennedy Center or whether its leadership is hoping to relocate some or all of those events. \n\n\tAmong the programs on the opera calendar is an upcoming gala event which songwriter Stephen Schwartz was listed as the host and curator for, until he announced that he had no plans to set foot in the building again. The gala is now listed without a host or celebrity attached.\n\n\tThe opera company’s statement Friday said that it would “seek an amicable early termination of its affiliation agreement with the Kennedy Center and resume operations as a fully independent nonprofit entity.” According to the New York Times report that Grenell found objectionable, “Opera officials said that new sites in Washington have been lined up but that no leases have been signed.”\n\t\n\n\tThe opera has performed almost exclusively at the center since it opened in 1971.\n\n\tUnder Grenell’s leadership, the board recently voted to rename the center the Trump Kennedy Center, with lettering with the current president’s name added to the exterior of the building the next day. Opponents of the move have pointed out that, legally, it would require an act of Congress to rename a national monument, so dispute continues over what the current name of the venue actually is.\n\n\tGrenell was not solely concerned with the Washington National Opera or his hacked account on Saturday, also devoting tweets to how California governor Gavin Newsom “is running the largest state in the country into the ground,” celebrating the halt to public media funding, and approvingly reposting video of an individual being captured by ICE in Los Angeles.\n",

    "body": "\n\tT.K. Carter, the actor known for the horror classic “The Thing” and the television series “Punky Brewster,” has died. He was 69. \n\n\tCarter died Friday at his home in Duarte, Calif., the actor’s publicist Tony Freeman shared with Variety in a statement. A cause of death was not disclosed, but no foul play is suspected.\n\n\t“T.K. Carter was a consummate professional and a genuine soul whose talent transcended genres,” said Freeman. “He brought laughter, truth, and humanity to every role he touched. His legacy will continue to inspire generations of artists and fans alike.” \n\t\n\n\tCarter made his professional acting debut in 1976 on NBC’s “Police Woman” and went on to make guest appearances on series such as “Quincy, M.E.” and “Good Times.” He appeared in multiple films before his breakthrough role as Naul, the roller-skating chef, in John Carpenter’s 1982 horror film “The Thing.” He later landed a recurring role as Mike Fulton on the sitcom “Punky Brewster,” appearing from 1985 to 1986.\n\n\n\tFrom 1993 to 1994, Carter played Clarence Hull on “The Sinbad Show” for 24 episodes. In the 1996 original “Space Jam,” he voiced the character Monstar Nawt. \n\n\tBorn Thomas Kent Carter on Dec. 18, 1956, in New York City, he was raised in Southern California’s San Gabriel Valley. He began performing stand-up comedy at an early age. \n\n\tHis additional film and television credits include “Just Our Luck,” “Turbo Teen,” “Runaway Train,” “The Steve Harvey Show,” “Jem,” “He’s My Girl,” “Good Morning, Miss Bliss,” “Ski Patrol,” “A Rage in Harlem,” “Family Matters,” “A Different World,” “What a Cartoon!,” “Rush Hour,” “The Corner,” “Domino,” “Everybody Hates Chris,” “How to Get Away With Murder,” “The L.A. Riot Spectacular,” “Saints & Sinners” and more. \n\t\n\n\tCarter’s more recent roles included Russ in the 2020 film “The Way Back,” starring Ben Affleck; Uncle Jimmy in 2022’s “Fake Friends”; Cliff in the comedy series “Dave”; and Pike in the crime show “The Company You Keep,” starring Milo Ventimiglia and Catherine Haena Kim. \n\n\tCarter is survived by his mother and children.\n",

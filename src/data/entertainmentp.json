    "description": "\n\tIndia’s theatrical market reached unprecedented heights in 2025, with gross box office collections hitting INR13,395 crore ($1.48 billion), marking ",
    "body": "\n\tIndia’s theatrical market reached unprecedented heights in 2025, with gross box office collections hitting INR13,395 crore ($1.48 billion), marking the first time the territory crossed the INR13,000 crore threshold, according to Ormax Media’s annual report released Thursday. The numbers are for local Indian box office and do not include global collections.\n\n\tThe year’s standout performer was Aditya Dhar’s “Dhurandhar,” starring Ranveer Singh, which grossed $105.1 million to become the highest-grossing Hindi-language film of all time, surpassing 2024’s “Stree 2” ($77.2 million). The achievement underscores a remarkable resurgence for Hindi cinema, which posted its best-ever year with collections of $609 million, up 18% from 2024.\n\t\n\n\tThe 2025 total represents a 13% increase over the previous year’s $130.94 billion and eclipses the previous record of $135.29 billion set in 2023. Notably, 37 films crossed the INR100 crore ($11.06 million) benchmark compared to just 22 in 2024.\n\n\n\tHindi cinema’s recovery was driven by original Hindi-language productions, which accounted for 93% of the segment’s collections. Dependence on dubbed South Indian films plummeted from 31% in 2024 to just 7% in 2025, with original Hindi films posting a 59% year-over-year increase.\n\n\tThree films surpassed the INR500 crore ($55.3 million) mark: “Dhurandhar,” “Kantara A Legend: Chapter-1” at $80.1 million, and “Chhaava” with $76.6 million. “Saiyaara,” “Coolie” and animated title “Mahavatar Narsimha” each grossed above INR300 crore ($33.1 million).\n\n\tInternational releases experienced a resurgent year with 49% growth, reaching $155.2 million to post the highest-grossing year since the pandemic and the second-best performance of all time after 2019. “Avatar: Fire and Ash” led the category with $26.4 million, though it underperformed compared to its predecessor.\n\t\n\n\tThe market’s growth was fueled by rising ticket prices rather than increased attendance. The average ticket price (ATP) recorded its sharpest increase in four years, climbing 20% from INR134 ($1.48) to INR161 ($1.78). The ATP surge was driven by a higher box office share from Hindi and international releases, which commanded premium pricing, along with elevated ticket prices for tentpole South Indian films during premiere shows and opening weeks.\n\n\tConversely, footfalls declined 6% to 83.2 crore (832 million), underscoring the market’s continued dependence on ATP growth rather than audience expansion.\n\n\tAmong regional industries, Gujarati-language cinema posted explosive 189% growth, jumping from $9.2 million in 2024 to $26.7 million, driven by “Laalo: Krishna Sada Sahaayate,” which grossed $12.6 million to become the highest-grossing Gujarati film of all time.\n\n\tKannada-language cinema rebounded with 73% growth to $58.4 million, led by “Kantara A Legend: Chapter-1,” which contributed $26.3 million in its Kannada version alone.\n\n\tSouth Indian languages saw mixed results. Telugu remained steady at $263 million, up just 1%, while Tamil dipped 1% to $199.7 million. Malayalam maintained its 2024 levels at $128.8 million, confirming 2024 as a watershed year for the industry. The combined share of four South Indian languages decreased from 48% in 2024 to 44% in 2025, with only Kannada showing significant growth among the group.\n\n\tPunjabi and Marathi-language cinemas experienced significant contractions. Punjabi collections plunged 43% to $12.8 million, while Marathi fell 46% to $10.6 million. Bengali cinema posted modest but steady growth, rising 17% to $88.5 million.\n\n\tRe-releases contributed 1.5% of Hindi box office, led by “Sanam Teri Kasam” at $4.4 million. The Assamese film “Roi Roi Binale” grossed $4.6 million, single-handedly driving 131% growth for the “Others” category.\n\n\tIndia’s Top 10 Films of 2025 (All Languages Combined)\n\n\n“Dhurandhar” – $105.1 million\n“Kantara A Legend: Chapter-1” – $80.1 million\n“Chhaava” – $76.6 million\n“Saiyaara” – $43.8 million\n“Coolie” – $35.9 million\n“Mahavatar Narsimha” – $33.3 million\n“War 2” – $31.3 million\n“Avatar: Fire and Ash” – $26.4 million\n“They Call Him OG” – $24.7 million\n“Sankranthiki Vasthunam” – $24.5 million\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tHackman Capital Partners is expected to cede ownership of Radford Studio Center, the historic L.A. production facility, to lenders after defaulting on a $1.1 billion mortgage, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.\n\n\tHackman, the world’s largest independent studio owner, reportedly told investors last month that it had suspended negotiations to restructure the debt on the 55-acre site, and is expected to turn over the facility to Goldman Sachs.\n\t\n\n\tStudio owners have struggled to lease space due to a sharp downturn in film and TV production volume since 2022. Bloomberg reported that revenue from the property covered just 21% of Hackman’s debt service costs on the property as of last June.\n\n\n\tIn a statement to Variety, Hackman said it is working with the banks on a resolution.\n\n\t“We are continuing to work with the Radford lenders on a path forward for this asset,” a spokesperson said. “This is a challenging time for all suppliers and independent studio owners and operators in the U.S. We have substantial capital behind us, hold 50 percent of our assets without debt, and remain geographically diverse, with 55 percent of our studios outside the U.S. This will help us to navigate through these troubled waters.”\n\n\tGoldman Sachs declined to comment.\n\n\tIn its letter to investors, Hackman said that the MBS Group — which operates Radford and other Hackman-owned facilities — had thwarted efforts to restructure the debt. The MBS Group is an affiliate of Hackman, and allegedly sought changes in the equipment rental deal that made working out an agreement with the banks impossible.\n\t\n\n\tHackman acquired the Radford lot, formerly known as CBS Studio Center, from ViacomCBS for $1.85 billion in 2021. The purchase was part of an acquisition spree that also included the CBS Television City studio in the Fairfax District.\n\n\tHackman announced plans in 2023 to invest $1 billion to renovate the lot, which was built in 1928 and has been home to shows like “Gunsmoke,” “My Three Sons,” “Gilligan’s Island,” “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” “American Gladiators” and “Seinfeld.”\n\n\tA worker, J.C. “Spike” Osorio, was killed when he fell through rafters at the facility in February 2024. A Cal/OSHA investigation attributed the death to aging wood in the catwalks and assessed Radford a $45,000 penalty.\n\n\tHackman also owns Culver Studios — which is leased to Amazon — as well as production facilities in New York, New Orleans, the U.K. and Vancouver.\n",

It is not worth all this discussion. It is a waste of time in a world where there are more important things to worry about.”\n\t\n\n\tThe drama for Noth began after he posted a gym selfie on Jan. 9 with the caption, “Fuck new years – LET’S GO!!!!” A fan then replied, “You mean f— sjp & her award right? lol,” in reference to Parker receiving the Golden Globes’ Carol Burnett Award. Noth replied to that comment, “Right.”\n\n\n\tIn Dec. 2021, Noth was accused of sexual assault by two women. Speaking under pseudonyms, Zoe, a member of the entertainment industry, told The Hollywood Reporter she was assaulted by Noth in 2004 in Los Angeles. Lilly, who identified as a journalist, told the outlet she was assaulted by Noth in 2015 in New York City. Noth called the allegations “categorically false” in a prepared statement.\n\n\tIn the wake of the allegations, Noth was dropped from “The Equalizer” and the “Sex and the City” sequel series “And Just Like That.” In a joint statement, Parker and her “Sex and the City” co-stars Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis said, “We are deeply saddened to hear the allegations against Chris Noth. We support the women who have come forward and shared their painful experiences. We know it must be a very difficult thing to do and we commend them for it.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tSharad Devarajan and Dr. Mark Sagar have launched FaiBLE Media Inc., a Silicon Valley startup focused on merging artificial intelligence with storytelling to develop new narrative technologies and unlock scientific breakthroughs in creative expression. The company will be officially unveiled Jan. 16 at the AETHER Summit in Singapore.\n\n\tThe Palo Alto-based company brings together Devarajan, an award-winning creator and producer serving as CEO, with Sagar, a two-time Academy Award-winning technologist and AI pioneer of virtual beings, as chief AI officer. Sagar built revolutionary facial systems for “King Kong” and “Avatar,” earning two Academy Awards for scientific and technical achievement.\n\t\n\n\tFaiBLE’s mission centers on understanding the fundamental structures that drive narrative resonance with audiences and building tools and experiences based on those insights. The company describes its long-term research initiative as “The AlphaFold of Storytelling,” drawing parallels to how AlphaFold decoded protein-folding patterns by revealing hidden biological structures.\n\n\n\t“Throughout history, humanity has stumbled upon foundational creative scientific discoveries only rarely every few centuries. If I went back 2,000 years and drew an image with linear perspective, it would have felt like magic to the person of that time,” said Devarajan. “From musical scales to the Hero’s Journey, every great creator seeks to understand the science of their craft. AI now gives us the ability to find them intentionally rather than by accident. FaiBLE is dedicated to uncovering the next wave of these transcendent tools to spark a new creative renaissance.”\n\t\n\n\tDevarajan serves as adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, where he has taught a course on artificial intelligence and disruptive technologies for nearly a decade. He founded Graphic India, a leading Indian comic book and animation company, and created “The Legend of Hanuman,” one of the most successful animated series in Indian history.\n\n\tSagar later pioneered AI-driven virtual beings, including the Baby X project, which explored biologically-inspired neural system models for autonomous animated agents.\n\n\t“The intersection of AI and storytelling represents one of the most exciting frontiers in technology and art,” said Sagar. “We’ll be exploring the most effective mechanisms by which stories create meaning, evoke emotion, and become timeless. These are scientific questions as well as artistic ones, and AI gives us unprecedented tools to explore them.”\n\n\tA key focus involves developing “Quantum Stories,” technology enabling dynamic story worlds rather than fixed linear narratives. The platform allows audiences to explore unique narrative paths through characters, timelines and perspectives while AI maintains consistency and canonical integrity across experiences.\n\n\t“Quantum Stories represents a fundamental shift in how narrative canon is formed,” Sagar said. “In traditional media, canon is static and authored from the top down. In Quantum Stories, canon is alive, continuously expanding while remaining internally consistent. This was not feasible before AI. No human writers’ room or branching narrative system could sustain coherence across vast numbers of individualized storylines. We believe this represents an entirely new storytelling opportunity where a creator’s vision can be expanded a thousandfold.”\n\n\tFaiBLE views India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Latin America as natural pioneers for these new storytelling formats, citing these regions’ vast narrative traditions, large audiences and readiness to embrace innovative mediums.\n\n\t“We believe the next generation of iconic story experiences and formats will emerge from creators willing to experiment, innovate, and pioneer new frontiers,” said Devarajan. “That spirit of creative risk-taking is at the heart of everything we are building at FaiBLE.”\n\n\tThe company was incubated at Graphic India and maintains creative and production connections across India and other global markets. FaiBLE is currently assembling a multidisciplinary team spanning storytelling, animation, technology and AI research.\n\t\n\n\tThe AETHER Summit, taking place Jan. 15-16 at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, is an invitation-only global forum organized by Media Partners Asia that brings together leaders across artificial intelligence, immersive and generative technologies, connectivity and infrastructure, creativity and content, and global capital.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLife after lockup: The reveal of Todd and Julie Chrisley as the Croissants on “The Masked Singer” might come with some controversy — given the reality TV couple’s conviction of tax evasion and bank fraud, followed by a pardon by Trump. But Todd told Variety that he hasn’t faced an in-person negative encounter in the months since he and Julie were released from prison.\n\n\tOf course, online, it’s a bit different. “You have people that say things on social media that they used to love us, but now that Trump pardoned us,” he said. “Their issue is who pardoned us. It’s not that we were pardoned, it’s who pardoned us. So I would say to any person that has an issue with that, if they were in our situation and President Trump could have pardoned them, they would have stood in line to have gotten that pardon.”\n\t\n\n\tJulie said she hasn’t seen much blowback because, she believes, the couple has been transparent about what happened, having been convicted and sentenced to a combined 19 years in prison in November 2022 (which was later reduced). The couple reported to prison in 2023.\n\n\t“If we didn’t talk about it on ‘Chrisley Knows Best,’ it was because that was a decision that the network made,” she said. “They didn’t really want to delve into that. But we’ve never shied away from what we’ve gone through, and it’s taken so long to get to the other side. We just look at it as, it’s our story. And so we’re going to tell our story. Who better to tell our story than us.”\n\n\tTodd said he doesn’t respond to the criticism — unless it’s directed right at him. “I live my life based off of what I know is the right thing to do for me, my wife, my children and my mother. I try not to be rude. I try not to offend people,” he said. “But if you knock on my door and you come to my door with that, then I’ve got something waiting for you.”\n\t\n\n\tIn their quest for a pardon, the Chrisleys argued that their conviction was due to political persecution, even though there was no proof of that. Now, Todd Chrisley has tempered that tone, and said that “I don’t want my conversations to be political. I don’t want the movements that I make to be politicized. I want the world to know that Julie and I and our family are the same today. Our core value system is still the same, and it’s still intact. We’re a family that loves people, and our love is not conditional because you love this person, or you live this way, or you believe in this. We are so blessed that that everyone that has a seat at our table, for the most part, has a different political view. And yet, we still have dinner together here in Nashville. We still have a great time. We’re there for each other when something happens and I feel like that, that’s what the world needs.\n\n\t“You can sit and say, ‘I hate President Trump,’ ‘I hate Joe Biden,’ ‘I hate Obama,’ ‘I hate Clinton.’ That’s like a football team. I love Clemson University. That’s where Julie and I grew up, but my son goes to Alabama, so we can’t pull for Clemson when they’re playing Alabama. Just understand that you have a different team that you root for. But do it with respect, do it with kindness and do it with generosity,” he said. “And if we could all get to that place in life, then I think that the world would be a much better place.”\n\n\tOn “The Masked Singer,” the Chrisleys performed “Jailhouse Rock” on last week’s episode, and they agreed that it was perhaps a bit too on the nose.\n\n\t“We’ve leaned into it since it’s happened, we haven’t ran from it,” Todd Chrisley said. “And it just felt right. It was kind of like, ‘you’re not going to hold this over our head, you’re not going to shame us with this.’ And I just felt good with that song. I’ve always loved that song, and it just felt appropriate.”\n\n\tBetween “Jailhouse Rock” and the clue package, it wasn’t hard to figure out it was the Chrisleys — and indeed, panelist Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg quickly identified them.\n\n\t“We said to the folks at ‘Masked Singer’ that these clues are too telling,” Todd said. “ It’s too fresh, they’re going to figure this out quick. I’ve known Jenny for years, and I always felt she was going to be the one to figure this out.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Chrisleys’ daughter Savannah appeared on “The Masked Singer” in Season 11 as the Afghan Hound, but Todd and Julie didn’t tell her they were going on the show. She figured it out anyway.\n\n\t“The day that we were on set, I got a text from her, and she goes, ‘Are you doing Masked Singer?’ And I said, ‘Why would you ask that?’ And then she called, and she said, ‘Dad, someone there on the set just sent me a text and said they ran into you and mom.’ So that’s how she found out.”\n\n\tWhy do “The Masked Singer”? “I’m not going to lie, I was a little apprehensive,” Julie Chrisley said. “Todd can sing. He has a great voice. He’s recorded a song with Sarah Evans before. So I knew he would be fine. It was something that was completely out of my comfort zone, but I was excited to do it.”\n\n\tThen came the costume, and the Croissant sealed the deal for the two of them. “Savannah’s late fiancé, Nic Kerdiles, who passed away in a motorcycle accident, was French, and I kind of felt like that was a wink from him, because we love him so much,” Todd said. “I just looked at Julie and I said, ‘we have to do the Croissants.’”\n\n\tThe Chrisleys said they’re busy this year working on five different series: Besides Lifetime’s “The Chrisleys: Back to Reality,” Julie has a new cooking show, as well as another show with Savannah, while Todd is working on a separate project in the U.K.\n\n\t“I say this often, that so many people that go through what we have gone through, their whole world is shattered. There’s nothing left for them,” Todd said. “We were blessed that that didn’t happen to us. We were able to come home to our home, we were able to have a car, to be able to have our clothes, to be able to go and sit down for a nice dinner. And so many people don’t have that. So it has been a very humbling season for our family, and it has exposed us to families that we probably would have never had any interaction with. And so I look at that, and I look at where our life is today and how blessed we are since we’ve been home. And I don’t take it for granted.”\n\n\tWatch the Chrisleys as they’re unmasked on “The Masked Singer”:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tHailee Steinfeld and her “Sinners” co-star Michael B. Jordan shared the kind of on-set conversations you can only have while making a horror movie. While filming, one of their frequent debates was over what would it sound like to feed on someone as a vampire. \n\n\t“We were joking that we sounded like the Cookie Monster at one point because we thought that, while you’re overcome by this whole transformation, you are still you, and everything you’re feeling is just heightened,” Steinfeld tells Variety. “You want what you want a whole lot more. You feel the loss and hunger a whole lot more.”\n\t\n\n\tQuestioning the specifics of vampire behavior may not seem like a serious acting exercise, but it was just one of the ways the cast of Ryan Coogler’s hit spent their days digging down to the root of humanity that flows through the Southern gothic vampire story. Yet horror films like “Sinners” very seldom get their due for the tremendous effort put into making the genre recognizable and realistic. Aside from notable exceptions like “Silence of the Lambs” and “The Exorcist,” vampires, witches and the stuff of nightmares have long failed to be taken seriously by awards bodies, despite receiving acclaim from critics and audiences.\n\n\n\t“It truly is one of the most emotionally demanding genres because it asks actors to live in extremes,” Steinfeld says. “It is often dismissed as less serious or whatnot, but I think when it’s done well, it is a mirror that reflects our deepest fears and desires in a very raw way. I don’t even know if you could call [“Sinners”] a horror film without calling it anything and everything else too.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHailee Steinfeld is a vampire in ‘Sinners.’\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEven the fantasy genre has its troubles, despite big wins for films like “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” and “The Shape of Water.” But this year promises to challenge that long-held stigma with a handful of worthy contenders making the case that horror, fantasy and other genre stories can be successful without scaring voters away.\n\n\t“Sinners” is just the start. In the horror space, Warner Bros. also has “Weapons,” Zach Cregger’s box office smash that has a surprise-but-thrilling awards contender in Amy Madigan as Aunt Gladys. Madigan’s campaign may have begun as grassroots manifesting online, but her recent Critics Choice Awards win for best supporting actress and a  SAG-AFTRA Actor Awards nomination solidifies that bigger prizes are within reach. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmy Madigan won audiences over as Aunt Gladys in ‘Weapons.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQuantrell Colbert\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn the fantasy realm, “Wicked: For Good” hopes to continue its own streak of making witches and wizards (even fake ones like Jeff Goldblum’s Wizard of Oz) palatable awards players, with Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande already being chiseled into stone for repeat nominations for their performances as Elphaba and Glinda, respectively.\n\n\tBut on the fringes, Oscar voters can also consider aliens (or at least conspiracies about them) with Focus Features’ “Bugonia,” starring Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons. Voters can fall under the spell of a different kind of vamp with Jennifer Lopez’s tantalizing musical “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” or ponder the fantasia that is life itself with Mike Flanagan’s Stephen King adaptation “The Life of Chuck.” The possibilities to recognize genre storytelling feel infinite this awards season, and it is all anchored in character work.\n\n\tFor Omar Benson Miller, who plays sharecropper and nightclub bouncer Cornbread in “Sinners,” his transformational role was personally grounded by his own family. Coogler had given him photos of sharecroppers to consider while in prep, but Miller didn’t need the lesson.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOmar Benson Miller as Cornbread in ‘Sinners’\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Little did he know this was actually in my family history because my grandfather was a sharecropper in Mississippi,” Miller says. “I had photos I could get from my family, so there was a lot that went into me trying to represent my people and my actual family correctly, which then I felt like would translate across the board. At the end of the day, the only way Ryan’s bold vision will work is if you care about the characters before the genre element is ever introduced.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen Cornbread’s story takes a tragic, but not wholly unexpected, turn, Miller says showing what made his character human helps the monster he becomes lure the audience into a dangerous sense of familiarity.\n\n\t“The only way that you actually consider letting him in is if you have built a relationship with him,” he says. “Since Cornbread has been the face at the door for a while, and you saw him previously in the field with his wife, then it really matters when he is pleading and trying to get in.”\n\n\tSkirting that line between horror and fantasy was the unique challenge for “Wicked: For Good’s” Ethan Slater, who had to take his compassionate Boq and warp him into something far more heartless when he is magically transformed into the Tin Man. Despite being a kid-friendly story about flying monkeys, witchy wars and soaring musical declarations, the making of the Tin Man may be among the biggest leaps for audiences. But that’s where the genre can break open even the most human experiences.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEthan Slater transforms into the Tin Man in ‘Wicked: For Good.’\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“There’s a horror element to what happens to him,” Slater says. “It was actually really helpful to have a character going through this massive transformation of being open-hearted and optimistic and loving, and then have that stolen from him and his heart shrinking. Sometimes magic is just a helpful way of expressing something that is innately human.”\n\n\tThe physical performance in this case also gets an assist from the prosthetics that let Slater slip into Boq’s new silver-plated era. “It was one of the benefits of working with such an amazing makeup and prosthetic team because I was wearing different skin,” he says. “That is also a very human thing — to not feel at home in your own body.”\n\n\tSlater says genre storytelling can sometimes foster an authentic emotional platform that’s even more realistic than a traditional drama.\n\n\t“When we are telling human stories, we control ourselves more than people do in real life, where we have really high highs and really low lows,” he says. “In reality, we sometimes do things that seem unrealistic, but that’s how people live and it is liberating to push stories to those very real extremes.”\n\n\tIn that way, “The Life of Chuck” may be the toughest pill to swallow among this year’s genre contenders. King’s story tells of the end of the world, through the life of one man. It’s an ethereal, almost mystical dance with the questions of the universe and our part in it. But Flanagan remembers that after King saw the film (and loved it, by the way), he was honest that it wouldn’t be for everyone because even with vampires, witches and wizards on screen this year, embracing human emotion may be the scariest thing of all.\n\t\n\n\t“[King said] ‘This works on me because its heart is on its sleeve,” Flanagan recently recalled on an FYC panel. “We’ve been trained very well to be skeptical, to be on guard, and not to lead with our emotions because that’s vulnerable. We all had a realistic expectation that this wouldn’t necessarily work for everyone because it was so earnest.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA tale of withdrawal that feels withdrawn in its telling, Lilian T. Mehrel’s debut “Honeyjoon” traces familial relationships in the wake of loss as a mother and daughter find their way back to one another. A story of Iranian diaspora, of sexual and emotional repression, and of culture and politics experienced at a distance, the movie delivers subtext aplenty, overflowing in ways that help overcome its reserved exterior and make for an unobtrusive comedy-drama that, on occasion, comes close to working.\n\t\n\n\tOpening with resplendent footage of the Azores islands in Portugal — given the appearance of old and battered film reels — “Honeyjoon” positions itself as a movie of memory. It also quickly tosses several other ideas in its thematic blender: the first contemporary images we see are of an Iranian-American 20-something, June (Ayden Mayeri), masturbating in her hotel room at dawn, before she’s interrupted by her middle-aged mother Lela (Amira Casar) shuffling back to bed. Stillness and silence follow, a mood that carries over to the duo’s meals, massages and interactions with guests and staff at their luxurious resort. The honeymoon package they’ve chosen forces them to be around each other all the time, and around young couples in love, which weighs on Lela, since her husband (and June’s father) has recently died from cancer.\n\n\n\tA private tour of the islands with João (José Condessa), a rugged and attractive local, serves as the venue for June and Lela’s differing approaches to the trip, and to life in general. June has no time for the region’s poetic myths and is embarrassed by her mother bringing up their recent loss and mentioning the ongoing “Woman. Life. Freedom” feminist protest movement unfolding in Iran, where neither of them has been for decades. The duo’s minor emotional skirmishes take the form of stilted verbal spars, written more for expository function than underlying meaning. However, the actors’ dialed-in approach to the material — in tandem with the lush European surroundings — lends itself to attractive walk-and-talk vistas in the vein of Richard Linklater or Mia Hansen-Løve.  \n\t\n\n\tWhat’s missing from “Honeyjoon,” however, is sufficient dramatic coherence between image and story. Mehrel’s overly cautious framing rarely enhances either the interpersonal tensions between her leading ladies or the romantic and sexual excitement between June and João. The moments when the frame feels as liberated as its characters hope to are few and far between. These include glimpses of the world through June’s smartphone photographs and a short, impressionistic sequence during its closing scenes, when the characters lose themselves in dance.\n\n\tBesides these occasional flourishes (and the rare footage of old film reels, reminiscent of June’s father traveling to the Azores decades prior), “Honeyjoon” remains too restrained to excavate its characters’ subdued feelings, resulting in lengthy emotional plateaus. The film may be observant, but rarely keenly so. Were it not for the wisdom Casar brings to her matriarchal role — a sense of lived experience beneath Mehrel’s objective-first dialogue — “Honeyjoon” would rarely approach its fleeting moments of poignancy. Thankfully, that it sometimes overcomes its estrangement from its own images ends up assisting its gentle saga of a mother and daughter overcoming their emotional estrangement.\n\n\tThere is no singular way to approach intimacy when characters are searching for ways to be happy and live life once again. These complications appear to stem from Mehrel’s loss of her own father in recent years, which ensures that “Honeyjoon” is, at the very least, emotionally honest when navigating the strange and inexplicable labyrinth of grief. However, that its other tenets remain obfuscated, from its scattered thoughts on personal freedoms to its distant political musings, yields a recipe of too many dissonant ingredients, few of which are rendered in a manner that tickles the cinematic palette. The result may be personal, but it’s also far too plain.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBased on Agatha Christie’s 1929 novel “The Seven Dials Mystery” and adapted for television by Chris Chibnall (of “Broadchurch” fame), Netflix’s “Agatha Christie’s Seven Dials” is a solid murder-mystery offering a peek into 20th-century aristocracy, centered on a plucky antagonist. While the series isn’t as thrilling as viewers may hope, the engaging performances and several of the less trite twists and turns work well enough.\n\t\n\n\t“Agatha Christie’s Seven Dials” opens in Spain in 1920. A middle-aged man walks into the middle of a bullfighting ring. As the man turns to leave, all of the gates shut, and a bull comes roaring toward the center, bludgeoning the man to death. Flashing forward to 1925, Lady Eileen “Bundle” Brent (Mia McKenna-Bruce) and her widowed mother, Lady Caterham (Helena Bonham Carter), have rented out their sweeping English country estate to a millionaire and his wife. In true 1920s flapper flair, Bundle is swept away in the fun and delight of a party being held at the estate. She chats with old friends, flirts, and dances with Gerry Wade (Corey Mylchreest), her late older brother’s best friend. Unfortunately, Bundle and Gerry’s burgeoning romance ends before it really begins. The next morning, when he fails to come down to breakfast, Bundle and the rest of the guests find him dead in bed. Adding to the peculiarity of the situation are the seven alarm clocks placed ever so carefully on his fireplace mantel.\n\n\n\t​Though the police initially rule Gerry’s death as accidental, Bundle isn’t so sure. Defying her mother and Scotland Yard’s Superintendent Battle (Martin Freeman), Bundle embarks on her own investigation, opening a Pandora’s box of revelations that are far more dangerous, murderous and puzzling than she anticipated.\n\t\n\n\t“Agatha Christie’s Seven Dials” isn’t exceptional, but it’s still a fun ride. McKenna-Bruce is delightful as the pint-sized self-proclaimed detective determined to do whatever is possible to find out what happened to her friend. A few of the clues unveiled in “Seven Dials” are more obvious than others, but there are just enough surprises to make the series worthwhile. However, with a three-episode season, it seems odd that Chibnall chose to adapt the story for television rather than edit it down to a two-hour film. A tighter runtime would likely have solved the pacing issue that burdened the show’s opener, “Bundle of Love,” in particular.\n\n\tThe humor embedded in the story, despite some sobering plotlines, keeps things afloat, especially when the narrative becomes repetitive. From the numerous alarms set to awaken Gerry to the horrifying marriage proposal Bundle receives, “Seven Dials” is full of slick jokes and hearty laughs. \n\n\tYet the first episode drags on a bit, laying a ton of groundwork and backstory before the proper investigation begins. And the whodunit aspect of the show doesn’t quite work: Halfway through Episode 2, “Battle Commences,” most viewers will likely determine the main culprit behind Gerry Wade’s untimely demise. Still, the final main reveal was a cheeky surprise that even the most engaged viewer might not see coming. \n\n\tOverall, “Agatha Christie’s Seven Dials” is just fine. Though Episode 3, “The Finger Points,” is by far the strongest, the show is highly bingeable, with a fun setting and location, and allows an unlikely protagonist to drive the narrative and the series’ perspective. While the story itself may have been stronger in a film format, the performances by Freeman, Bonham Carter and McKenna-Bruce are enticing enough to keep the viewer engaged. Should Netflix greenlight a second season — as the show’s ending indicates it might — more shocking revelations would undoubtedly boost the storyline. Hopefully, Bundle finds herself involved in something so grandiose and gripping that the evidence presented will warrant a truly riveting climax.\n\n\t“Agatha Christie’s Seven Dials” is now streaming on Netflix.\n",

Cohen made the announcement on “Watch What Happens Live” Wednesday night, when Porsha Williams of “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” and Venita Aspen from “Southern Charm” were his guests.\n\n\tWilliams will be representing “Atlanta,” as the show makes its way through five different locations where “Real Housewives” has filmed. OG of the OC Vicki Gunvalson (“The Real Housewives of Orange County”), Kyle Richards (“The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills”), Countess Luann de Lesseps (“The Real Housewives of New York City”), Teresa Giudice (“The Real Housewives of New Jersey”), Gizelle Bryant (“The Real Housewives of Potomac”) and Lisa Barlow (“The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City”) will go from Orange County to Beverly Hills, then travel to Atlanta and Miami before ending the trip in New York City. The show will premiere later this year.\n\n\tAlong the way, the main cast will be joined by more than 60 additional Housewives, and that is where NeNe Leakes comes in for her much-heralded (and much-rumored) return to Bravo after her 2022 lawsuit in which she sued NBCUniversal, Bravo, True Entertainment, Cohen personally and other involved parties for violating federal employment and anti-discrimination laws. In Leakes’ lawsuit, which she withdrew later in 2022, she alleged the network and its parent company “maintain a corporate culture that is insensitive to Black talent and fosters racially-offensive behavior that goes unpunished.” \n\n\tLeakes was part of the original cast of “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” in 2008, and was one of the first Bravo stars who showed what the platform could do: Her lightning-quick wit, equally fast comebacks, compelling backstory and immense charisma made her an audience favorite. She quickly became the most quoted and GIF’d Bravo star, as “Close your legs to married men!,” “I said what I said,” “So nasty and so rude,” among many, many other NeNe moments entered the pantheon. Leakes also caught the attention of powerful TV boss Ryan Murphy, who created a recurring role for her on “Glee” and cast her as a series regular on the NBC sitcom “The New Normal.” As her fortunes changed, she remained on “Real Housewives of Atlanta” (though she went part-time for a few seasons), and left officially after Season 12 in 2020.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTommy Garcia/Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tAfter filing the lawsuit in 2022, though, Leakes became persona non grata at the network, and the following year, she went on former Bravo star (turned anti-Bravo activist) Bethenny Frankel’s podcast to say she’d been blacklisted in the entertainment industry, and was being “severely punished.” In 2024, though, something began to thaw at NBCUniversal, and Leakes was hired to be one of the presenters for “Live From E!: Emmy After Party.” The thawing continued: In an interview from BravoCon from this past November with Frances Berwick — the chairman of Bravo and Peacock Unscripted — when asked whether Leakes might ever fully reconcile with the network, Berwick said, “Yes, she can be on a show again.” Indeed, it’s Berwick whom Leakes thanks first in an emotional post on Instagram earlier Wednesday, in which she collaborated with Bravo to announce her official return. “Couldn’t celebrate 20 years without you,” Cohen wrote in the comments of the post.\n\n\n\tFilming is imminent on “The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip: Roaring 20th” (which is the series’ working title). According to the network’s official description for the show, “Starting where it all began in Orange County and culminating in an epic East Coast grand finale, each stop will feature appearances by fan favorites from different cities to pay tribute to the past, embrace the present and look toward the many miles still ahead. Along the way, viewers can expect nostalgic reunions, heartfelt revelations, effortless humor and the larger-than-life dynamics that only Housewives can deliver.” \n\t\n\n\t“The Real Housewives of Orange County” premiered on Bravo on March 21, 2006, and was intended to be a reality version of “Desperate Housewives,” then among the top shows on television. Nearly 20 years later, Bravo plans to aggressively commemorate the milestone for the franchise. As Berwick put it at BravoCon, “Let’s just say the audience will be very aware that it is the 20th anniversary of ‘Real Housewives,’ with many celebrations around that.”\n\n\t“The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip: Roaring 20th” is produced by Shed Media with Lisa Shannon, Dan Peirson and Darren Ward serving as executive producers. Cohen also serves as executive producer. \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPaul McCartney Reveals ‘Man on the Run’ Trailer Chronicling Life After the Beatles\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis Sprawling Ritz-Carlton Residence in N.Y.C.

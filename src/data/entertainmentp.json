    "body": "\n\tLai Yuqing, the writer-director of the queer love story “Whisperings of the Moon,” has died in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. She was 23.\n\n\tNimbus Films and Inwave Films, which backed “Whisperings of the Moon” alongside Mirage Films, said in a statement: “We are deeply saddened to share that filmmaker Lai Yuqing, writer-director of ‘Whisperings of the Moon,’ with whom we had the privilege of working, has left us at the age of 23.”\n\n\n\tThe statement added that Lai “passed away due to an incident on Dec. 30, 2025. The case is still under investigation and her family is at Phnom Penh preparing her funeral as well as working closely with local authorities. Details of the incident haven’t been released yet but her family will make an official announcement once the case is resolved.”\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Tianjin, China, Lai studied in New York, Los Angeles and Toronto.  Her feature debut, “Whisperings of the Moon,” is set in Phnom Penh and follows a theater actor who returns home after her father’s death and reconnects with a former lover, tracing a bittersweet relationship shaped by memory, performance and social constraint.\n\n\tLai’s earlier work included the short films “Two Suns” (2024) and “Love Is a Book” (2024). “Whisperings of the Moon” grew directly out of “Love Is a Book,” which explored similar emotional terrain and led to the development of the feature.\n\n\t“Whisperings of the Moon” was produced by Esther Li, Siddartha Jatla and Lily Yang, and mounted as an international co-production spanning Cambodia and multiple Asian territories. The film was selected for the 30th Busan International Film Festival in 2025, with international sales handled by Inwave Films.\n\t\n\n\t“Yuqing’s talent lives on in her images, in the way she looked at the world: with rare sensitivity and honesty, marked by a calm, luminous intensity,” Nimbus and Inwave said. “In ‘Whisperings of the Moon,’ as in the other work she left behind, she was already shaping intimate, quietly powerful worlds, attentive to the smallest gestures and to the silences between people. A singular voice was just beginning to emerge.”\n\n\tThe film starred first-time actors Sopheanith Thong and Deka Nine, whom she met while working with students at Cambodia’s Acting Art Academy.\n\n\t“We are devastated by her departure,” the statement continued. “Our thoughts are with her family, her loved ones, and all who were close to her. We send them our deepest condolences.”\n\n\tNimbus and Inwave said they will continue to support “Whisperings of the Moon” with care and respect so that Yuqing’s work and voice can continue to be seen and heard around the world.\n\n\t“We will not forget her,” the companies said. “Rest in peace, Yuqing.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNorth American distributor Kani Releasing has secured rights to Jeong Jae-eun’s “Take Care of My Cat” from South Korean company Barunson E&A, planning a 25th anniversary theatrical return in summer 2026.\n\n\tJeong’s 2001 debut chronicles the year following graduation for five close friends whose bonds begin to fracture. The ensemble includes Lee Yo-won as Hae-joo, employed at a brokerage firm, and Ok Ji-young as Ji-young, an aspiring artist caring for her grandparents’ crumbling home while harboring study-abroad ambitions. Bae Doona delivers an early breakout turn as Tae-hee, an offbeat young woman who forms a connection with a cerebral palsy patient who writes poetry. Lee Eun-sil and Lee Eun-ju play twins Bi-ryu and Ohn-jo, facing discrimination due to their Chinese heritage in a largely homogeneous nation. The cat Tee-tee, belonging to Ji-young, becomes the thread that still binds the group as they navigate their uncertain futures.\n\t\n\n\tFilmed in Incheon, an industrial port city experiencing the sharp effects of South Korea‘s accelerated entry into global markets, the drama has gained recognition as a landmark of Korean cinema. The narrative examines social stratification, friendship bonds, and the unequal distribution of prospects as the characters transition from the relatively egalitarian world of school into adult life’s harsher realities and disappointments.\n\n\n\t“2001 was the first year of the new millennium, and releasing this film then holds great significance for me. I wanted to show that these kinds of women exist in the world, and I hadn’t seen it before on film,” said director Jeong. “Hearing that another distributor is releasing it in North America after 25 years makes me incredibly happy.”\n\t\n\n\tAriel Esteban Cayer, co-founder and artistic director of Kani Releasing, called the film one the company has had in mind since its inception. “In hindsight, it now unfolds with a remarkable sense of time and place, operating at a level not dissimilar to, say, the films of Edward Yang. It does for Incheon and the adjacent Seoul of aughts what he did for Taipei in the 80s,” Cayer said.\n\n\tThe film gained attention as a sleeper hit upon its original debut and earned spots at the 2002 International Film Festival Rotterdam and New Directors/New Films. Following a limited U.S. theatrical run more than two decades ago, the title has had minimal American exposure since.\n\n\tThe film will screen this month at Metrograph in New York City as part of the theater’s program focus on Bae, titled “Doona, Doona, Doona.” Bae went on to star in films including “Linda Linda Linda” and “Next Sohee,” while Lee Yo-won appeared in “Attack the Gas Station.”\n\n\tLaunched in 2021, Kani Releasing takes its name from the specialized low-angle tripod that director Yasujiro Ozu used for shooting. The company focuses on broadening North American appreciation of Asian cinema through theatrical releases of both contemporary works by emerging talent and rediscovered older titles.\n\n\tBarunson E&A, which began operations in 1996, focuses on backing projects that balance box office potential with artistic quality. The production company’s 2019 release “Parasite” achieved unprecedented success for a Korean film, claiming the top prize at Cannes and sweeping four Academy Awards including the top categories of best picture and best director.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEmma Stone wouldn’t dare take on the role of Miss Piggy in the upcoming movie about the “Muppets” star she’s producing with Jennifer Lawrence.\n\n\tIn November, it was confirmed that Stone and Lawrence are teaming up to produce a new film about the diva puppet, with “Oh, Mary!” Tony winner Cole Escola penning the screenplay. But don’t expect one of the Oscar winners to don Miss Piggy’s feather boa on the big screen — when asked by W Magazine if she would be playing Piggy, Stone seemed shocked at the suggestion.\n\t\n\n\t“First of all, that is the biggest insult to Miss Piggy I’ve ever heard, and I will not have her name dragged through the mud like that,” Stone said. “Why would I play a literal star? She’s the greatest.” \n\n\n\tShe continued: “No, of course I’m not playing Miss Piggy. And neither is Jen. We pale in comparison. Are you out of your mind? Miss Piggy is playing Miss Piggy. She would be storming out right now at the mere suggestion.” \n\n\tStone and Lawrence’s Miss Piggy film is in early development at Disney, which owns the rights to “The Muppets” franchise. Lawrence first revealed the news on Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers’ “Las Culturistas” podcast, telling the hosts: “I don’t know if I can announce this but I am just going to … Emma Stone and I are producing a Miss Piggy movie and Cole is writing it.”\n\n\tThough Miss Piggy will play herself, there’s still hope for Stone and Lawrence to have other roles in the film. When Yang and Rogers asked if the longtime friends would star in the project, Lawrence replied: “I think so. We have to… It’s fucked up [that we haven’t done a movie together].”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTotem Films has boarded “Emma Doucet,” a wistful romantic drama from “Sidonie in Japan” director Elise Girard. \n\n\tVicky Krieps will star as Emma, a single mother in her forties juggling work, volunteer commitments, parenting and a complicated emotional life. She unexpectedly falls for French Prime Minister Michel Villaverde, played by Alex Lutz, and despite the difficulties of their relationship, the two embark on a discreet epistolary affair. As Emma begins to reassess her choices, her son’s teenage existential crisis quietly mirrors her own.\n\t\n\n\tProduction is set to begin in spring 2026, led by France’s 10:15! Productions alongside Germany’s Lupa Film. Les Films du Losange and Piffl Medien will handle French and German distribution respectively, with additional support from Arte France Cinéma. \n\n\n\t“Emma could have stepped out of a Jane Austen novel,” Girard said. “But above all, she is a woman like many others: hardworking, a mother, idealistic and romantic — unknowingly waiting for something, perhaps true love.”\n\n\t“’Emma Doucet’ is a deeply romantic story that runs counter to a world where hope too often feels in short supply,” Totem Films’ Margot Hervée added. “It reminds us that life remains full of unexpected turns.”\n\n\tGirard’s previous feature, “Sidonie in Japan,” premiered in Venice Days in 2023, and went on to secure more than 30 international sales and grossed over $1 million worldwide. Starring Isabelle Huppert alongside August Diehl and Tsuyoshi Ihara, the bittersweet drama followed a widowed French author who travels to Kyoto and confronts the lingering presence of her late husband as she attempts to begin anew.\n\t\n\n\tHeading into this year’s Unifrance Rendezvous in Paris, Totem’s current slate includes Venice Lion of the Future winner “Short Summer” by Nastia Korkia; Locarno titles “Fantasy” by Kukla and “Donkey Days” by Rosanne Pel; Karlovy Vary best director winner “The Visitor” by Vytautas Katkus; and “Cotton Queen” by Suzannah Mirghani, which premiered in Venice Critics’ Week. The company is also heading to Berlinale with Anna Roller’s second feature “Allegro Pastell,” set to premiere in the Panorama section.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Dhurandhar,” starring Ranveer Singh, has overtaken the Hindi dubbed version of “Pushpa 2: The Rule” to become the highest-grossing Hindi-language film in India. \n\n\tAditya Dhar directed the film, with Jio Studios and B62 Studios producing. Singh leads the cast, with Akshaye Khanna playing the antagonist. The cast also includes Sanjay Dutt, R. Madhavan, Arjun Rampal, Sara Arjun, Rakesh Bedi, Manav Gohil, Danish Pandor, Saumya Tandon, Gaurav Gera and Naveen Kaushik.\n\t\n\n\tThe film’s India box office currently stands at INR981.05 crore ($109 million), and the international gross is $30.5 million, per numbers provided by Jio Studios.\n\n\n\t“Dhurandhar” is told in two parts, with the first installment following a decade-long Indian intelligence operation where an undercover agent infiltrates Karachi’s criminal and political underworld. The sequel is expected to continue from the cliffhanger ending.\n\n\tInternational records for “Dhurandhar” include being the no. 1 Hindi-language film of all time in North America; the no. 2 Indian film of all time in North America; the no. 1 Indian film of all time in Canada and Australia; and the no. 4 Indian film of all time in the U.K., per Jio Studios.\n\n\tIn the pantheon of all-time highest grossers locally in India, “Dhurandhar” is currently at no. 4, behind “Baahubali 2: The Conclusion” ($159 million, Telugu-language and dubbed versions), “Pushpa 2: The Rule” ($153.5 million, Telugu-language and dubbed versions), and “K.G.F: Chapter 2” ($112 million, Kannada-language and dubbed versions). \n\n\tAmong the highest grossing Indian films of all time worldwide, “Dhurandhar” currently occupies the fifth spot behind “Dangal” ($244.5 million), “Baahubali 2: The Conclusion” ($201.2 million), “Pushpa 2: The Rule” ($200 million) and “RRR” ($154 million). \n\t\n\n\t“Dhurandhar 2” will bow March 19, simultaneously releasing in the Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam languages in a pan-India and global rollout – a significant expansion from the original’s Hindi-only theatrical run. The decision to mount a five-language release came in response to unprecedented demand from South Indian markets, despite the first film’s Hindi-only availability.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAniMela, the international festival dedicated to animation, visual effects, gaming, comics and extended reality, will return to Mumbai’s National Film Development Corporation (NFDC).\n\n\tThe festival’s 2026 edition is being guided by an international advisory board featuring Mickael Marin of France’s Annecy Festival and MIFA, Munjal Shroff of Graphiti Studio, Arjun Madhavan of Assemblage, executive producer Ashima Avasthi Chaudhuri, Aneta Ozorek of Kaboom Film Festival and filmmaker Kiran Rao.\n\t\n\n\tProgramming will encompass film screenings and premieres, artist talks, behind-the-scenes sessions on animation and VFX productions, a gaming arena, an international VR showcase, a comics program and industry-focused sessions centered on professional exchange and skills development. A new addition for 2026 is the Transmedia Stage, which will host discussions on world-building across film, games, sound and interactive formats.\n\n\n\t“India’s creative landscape is evolving fast, with new talent and new ways of thinking in animation, gaming, and immersive media,” said festival director Nina Sabnani. “AniMela arrives at the right moment to help guide this shift by supporting innovation and giving visibility to the voices that will shape the next decade.”\n\n\tRao, who recently joined the advisory board, said, “As someone who deeply believes in the power of radical imagination and technology to expand how we tell stories, it is an honor to be part of AniMela’s journey at such a pivotal moment for the creative ecosystem. I am excited to support the festival as it expands its footprint, empowers new voices, and champions a future where Indian creators stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the world.”\n\t\n\n\tAmong the projects slated for preview is “Jharokha One: The Dancing Forest,” a location-based VR experience inspired by an Adivasi song from Telangana and developed using the Gond visual tradition.\n\n\tThe festival has established two-year partnerships with the French Institute in India, NFDC and the Indian Institute of Creative Technology, with a focus on education, training, industry dialogue and innovation within the AVGC-XR ecosystem. Anita Karnik serves as head of corporate alliances.\n\n\t“For decades, NFDC has supported filmmakers and cinematic voices that shape India’s cultural future,” said Prakash Magdum, managing director of NFDC. “AniMela is a natural partner in this journey; bringing together storytelling, technology, and new generations of creators on a truly global stage.”\n\n\tMathieu Béjot, attaché for audiovisual, cinema and digital content at the French Institute in India, said, “The French Institute in India has been a proud partner of Animela since day one. It is now embarking on an ambitious two-year plan of action covering all the facets of the AVGC-XR sector. Under the name Desibel – Indian Talents, French Vibes, the project aims to support the emergence of more Indian original IPs and to foster relationships between our two countries.”\n\n\tGautam Bhanot, general manager of NFDC, added, “AniMela represents the kind of forward-looking platform the Indian creative industry needs today. Our partnership reflects a shared commitment to opening international pathways, fostering collaboration, and positioning Indian creative talent within global networks.”\n\n\tCo-founder and artistic director Anne Doshi said, “At AniMela, we celebrate not just skill and polish, but curiosity, risk, chaos, courage and the need to create simply because you must. That is the kind of creative energy we want to protect and amplify.”\n\n\tCo-founder and event director Archana Trasy noted, “AniMela connects animation with gaming, filmmaking with technology, studios with students and ideas with opportunities. It’s not just a showcase. It is where bridges are built and the future of Indian AVGC-XR starts to take shape.”\n\n\tShroff said, “Animela is where the art, the artist, and the artistry of animation, VFX, gaming, comics, XR, and transmedia storytelling come together. And this year, we open our doors even wider – to celebrate the fans whose imagination keeps these universes buzzing with life and excitement.”\n\t\n\n\tThe festival is open to creators, innovators, students, professionals and the general public. AniMela 2026 will take place Feb. 19-22.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe song remains the same: Warner Bros. Discovery has turned down the latest acquisition offer by David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance, and WBD’s board is continuing to back the company’s deal with Netflix.\n\n\tOn Wednesday, WBD officially responded to Paramount’s latest $30/share all-cash bid for all of Warner Bros. Discovery — its eighth takeover offer to date. \n\n\tParamount Skydance’s offer “is not more favorable to WBD stockholders than the Netflix Merger and continues to be inadequate,” including because of its “insufficient value, taking into account price and numerous risks, costs and uncertainties,” WBD said in an SEC filing, referring to Paramount Skydance by its ticker symbol “PSKY.”\n\t\n\n\tThe WBD board reiterated its belief that Paramount’s proposal is much riskier and questioned Paramount’s ability to close such a deal. The board’s letter also noted that Paramount’s offer is nonbinding: “The Offer is entirely at PSKY’s discretion – PSKY can reduce the price, impose new conditions, or walk away entirely at any time prior to its acceptance of tendered shares,” WBD said in the filing.\n\n\n\tWBD has repeatedly rebuffed Paramount Skydance’s takeover overtures. On Dec. 17, WBD’s board rejected Paramount’s seventh offer, maintaining the Netflix deal is better.\n\n\tIn its Jan. 7 letter to shareholders, the board of WBD called into question Paramount Skydance’s ability to close its proposed deal. “PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization,” the WBD letter says. “To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt – more than $50 billion – through arrangements with multiple financing partners.” \n\t\n\n\tIn contrast, according to the WBD board’s letter, “Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY’s amended offer.”\n\n\tDavid Ellison’s Paramount Skydance on Dec. 22 had updated its offer to acquire for WBD for $30/share with certain new provisions. Among those, Larry Ellison (David’s multibillionaire father) made an “irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion” toward Paramount’s all-cash offer for WBD. Paramount also upped its breakup fee to match Netflix’s $5.8 billion figure, payable to WBD in the event that its deal does not clear regulatory review.\n\n\tBut WBD’s board was not swayed. Among other things, it said, the $5.8 billion regulatory termination fee from Paramount would be reduced to $1.1 billion — because WBD would be on the hook to pay the $2.8 billion upfront termination fee to Netflix, while it would also have $1.5 billion in financing costs and $350 million incremental interest expense. In addition, “PSKY’s proposed restrictions on WBD’s ability to refinance its $15 billion bridge loan would result in additional expense and business risk,” WBD said.\n\n\t“PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions,” the WBD board’s Jan. 7 letter says. “Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its ‘best and final’ proposal.”\n\n\tThe hostile takeover effort initiated by David Ellison came after WBD’s board entered into an agreement with Netflix in an $83 billion deal to buy Warner Bros.’s studios and HBO Max businesses. Netflix’s cash and stock transaction, announced Dec. 5, is valued at $27.75/share of WBD. That would take place following the planned spin-off of TV-centric entity Discovery Global, set for the third quarter of 2026. WBD shareholders would retain stock in Discovery Global under the Netflix pact.\n\t\n\n\tHere is the letter from Warner Bros. Discovery board to shareholders issued Wednesday:\n\n\tDear Fellow Shareholders,\n\n\tAs you know, at the end of last year, your Board of Directors concluded its process to maximize shareholder value by entering into our merger agreement with Netflix. Since then, Paramount Skydance (“PSKY”), a bidder in that process, has commenced a hostile tender offer to acquire WBD which it recently amended on December 22, 2025.\n\n\tAs described further below, your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY’s ability to complete the offer, and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders not tender your shares into the PSKY offer. For a full discussion of the reasons for the Board’s recommendation, we urge you to read the full 14D-9 filing.\n\n\tPSKY Offer’s Insufficient Value\n\n\tPSKY’s offer is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger. Under the Netflix merger agreement, WBD shareholders will receive significant value with $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50 based on a collar range in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing, which may have substantial upside.\n\n\tAdditionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value creation opportunities.\n\n\tThe Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would in effect lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY due to regulatory reasons. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD.\n\t\n\n\tLack of Certainty in PSKY’s Ability to Close the Transaction\n\n\tThe extraordinary amount of debt financing as well as other terms of the PSKY offer heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt – more than $50 billion – through arrangements with multiple financing partners.\n\n\tThe transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout (“LBO”). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror’s reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger.\n\n\tThe risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction – which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a “junk” credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition.\n\n\tFurther, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD’s ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD’s ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a “material adverse effect,” enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction.\n\t\n\n\tIn contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY’s amended offer.\n\n\tConsequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction\n\n\tIf PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD’s financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months.\n\n\tFurther, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD for regulatory reasons represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses.\n\n\tIn contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros.\n\t\n\n\tThe PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger\n\n\tPSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its “best and final” proposal.\n\n\tPSKY’s transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board’s determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so.\n\n\tYour Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you.\n\n\tSincerely,The Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors\n",

    "body": "\n\tSweden’s Göteborg Film Festival has announced its 2026 lineup.  \n\n\tAs observed by Artistic Director Pia Lundberg, the 49th edition – unspooling from Jan. 23 to Feb. 1 – will feature “266 films from around the globe, including numerous world and international premieres, as well as a strong selection from the Nordic region.” \n\n\tAmong the world premieres in the Nordic Competition, Julia Thelin’s “The Patron” will represent Sweden, while Finnish director Alli Haapasalo will follow “Girl Picture” with “Tell Everyone.” Maria Sødahl is set to present “The Last Resort.”\n\t\n\n\t“Premiering at Göteborg Film Festival feels magical. I once lied to get press accreditation because I really wanted to attend the festival,” said Thelin. “A lie only works if you believe it… Even when you know it’s a lie, the power can reside in not acknowledging the truth.”\n\n\n\tProducers Eliza Jones and Markus Waltå added: “We can’t wait to present ‘The Patron’ at [cinema] Draken on the first weekend of the festival. It’s a full-circle moment, going from showing our short films with Julia in Startsladden [Swedish Short Competition] to showing our feature film here.” \n\n\t“It’s a very stylish and interesting debut,” said Lundberg about “The Patron” – where a young woman pretends to be a patron for artists – also describing “Tell Everyone” as a “beautifully shot and beautifully told story.” \n\n\tSet in the 19th century, it follows a woman who finds herself committed to a mental institution on an island somewhere in the Finnish archipelago. \n\t\n\n\t“I just fully finished the film yesterday, but I’m ready and very excited to release ‘Tell Everyone’ into the world,” Haapasalo told Variety. “I love and appreciate the Göteborg Film Festival, and the times I’ve attended have been very inspirational and empowering. It’s a great honor to premiere ‘Tell Everyone’ in the main competition.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Tell Everyone’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Göteborg Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The Curse of Kane” by Even G. Benestad and August Baugstø Hanssen will top the list of new discoveries in the Nordic Documentary Competition, alongside “A Song for Love,” directed by Hogir Hirori, and “Första blatten på månen” by Iván Blanco. \n\n\tIn the first, a man decides to build a film empire worthy of his childhood idol, the Western hero Morgan Kane. “It tells an extraordinary story of an enigmatic man battling both the wolves of capitalism and his own inner demons in his refusal to let go of his dream,” accrding to the Göteborg Festival.\n\n\tBlanco will focus on artist Douglas “Dogge Doggelito” Léon, who “became a powerful symbol of Sweden’s multicultural suburbs,” while delivering a “universal story about shattered dreams, identity, fatherhood, and grief – and about the longing for recognition and redemption.” Hirori, by following a nursing student, “portrays the trials and joys of coming of age.”\n\n\tFinally, the International Competition will host the world premiere of “Zejtune” directed by Alex Camilleri, known for 2021 “Luzzu.”\n\n\t“There’s a lot of anticipation surrounding that film: it’s a gripping and finely drawn drama, and it’s charming musically as well. We’re very happy to screen it and we think the audience will really like it as well,” noted Lundberg.\n\n\tOther promising titles include “How to Divorce During the War” by Andrius Blaževičius, recently selected by Sundance, and Itonje Søimer Guttormsen’s “Butterfly” with Renate Reinsve, currently busy promoting “Sentimental Value” ahead of the Academy Awards. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘The Curse of Kane’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Göteborg Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs previously announced, the fest will welcome the likes of Noomi Rapace and Agnieszka Holland, as well as Ruben Östlund, set to tease his upcoming drama “The Entertainment System Is Down.” \n\n\tGöteborg will open with Marcus Carlsson’s “The Quiet Beekeeper” about a father and a daughter struggling to connect, described by Lundberg as a “moving and down-to-earth film which takes place far away from the big cities.” \n\t\n\n\t“It’s always such a pleasure to see so many Nordic films and have so many excellent titles to choose from. ‘The Quiet Beekeeper’ is important. It’s really nice to have a Swedish opening film this year, given all the talk about Swedish cinema not doing well at the local box-office,” she said.\n\n\t“Although there’s so much debate about Swedish film being underfinanced and not reaching its audience, there’re lots of very talented people in Sweden and the Nordic region who are devoted to film. That’s very hopeful.”\n\n\tLundberg also discussed this year’s focus during the festival: truth. \n\n\t“Truth is such a central theme. In this ‘post-truth’ era, it has featured strongly in films, and this section will reflect truth from very different perspectives,” she said, inviting audiences to join her in this exploration. \n\n\t“And, as always in January, to transform Göteborg into a meeting place for film lovers from across the world.” \n\n\tAdditional reporting by Annika Pham\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘The Last Resort’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Göteborg Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNordic Competition\n\n\t“Butterfly”\n\n\tNorway, Sweden, Great Britain\n\n\tDirector: Itonje Søimer Guttormsen\n\n\t“The Last Resort”\n\n\tDenmark, Norway, Spain\n\n\tDirector: Maria Sødahl\n\n\tWorld Premiere\n\n\t“The Love That Remains”\n\n\tIceland, Denmark, Sweden, France\n\n\tDirector: Hlynur Pálmason\n\n\t“The Patron”\n\n\tSweden\n\n\tDirector: Julia Thelin\n\n\tWorld Premiere\n\n\t“The Quiet Beekeeper” (opening film)\n\n\tSweden\n\n\tDirector: Marcus Carlsson\n\n\tWorld Premiere\n\n\t“Tell Everyone”\n\n\tFinland\n\n\tDirector: Alli Haapasalo\n\n\tWorld Premiere\n\n\t“Värn”\n\n\tSweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Poland, Finland, Great Britain, Switzerland\n\n\tDirector: John Skoog\n\n\t“Weightless”\n\n\tDenmark\n\n\tDirector: Emilie Thalund\n\n\tNordic Documentary Competition\n\n\t“Celtic Utopia”\n\n\tSweden, Ireland\n\n\tDirector: Dennis Harvey, Lars Lovén\n\n\t“The Curse of Kane”\n\n\tNorway\n\n\tDirector: Even G.

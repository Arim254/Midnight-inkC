    "body": "\n\tJapan will take the spotlight at next year’s Cannes market, the business hub of the Cannes Film Festival, after being named the 2026 Country of Honor — a recognition that will see the nation lead the market’s opening festivities and mount a large-scale showcase of its film, animation, and content industries.\n\n\tThe plans were outlined at a press conference during the ongoing Tokyo International Film Festival by Junichi Sakamoto, chair of the executive committee for Japan, Country of Honor 2026, and Guillaume Esmiol, executive director of the Cannes market. The 2026 edition will run May 12–20 alongside the 79th Cannes Film Festival.\n\t\n\n\tAs Country of Honor, Japan will co-host the market’s opening night — an industry gala drawing more than 1,200 global delegates — and feature across its flagship programs. A series of panels, networking sessions, and project showcases will highlight Japanese animation, genre cinema, and co-production opportunities. The slate will also include a Japan Industry Summit and a day of screenings dedicated to new Japanese films.\n\n\n\t“Being named Country of Honor presents a wonderful opportunity to showcase the appeal of Japanese cinema on a global stage,” Sakamoto said. “We look forward to seeing Japan’s rich film culture, along with its emerging talents and technologies, shine even brighter internationally.”\n\n\tSakamoto noted that Japan’s participation aims to deepen industry linkages and promote international collaboration. “This provides an excellent opportunity to strengthen ties with film industries worldwide and encourage joint productions,” he said.\n\t\n\n\tShiina Yasushi, vice chair of the executive committee and vice president of UniJapan, who also serves as the head of the Tokyo film market, added that Cannes would help demystify Japan’s production committee model for overseas producers. “We hope international partners gain a clearer understanding of how Japanese films are financed and developed, paving the way for more meaningful co-productions,” he said.\n\n\tEsmiol added, “Japan holds a unique place in international cinema and is one of the most dynamic countries at the Cannes market, with highly active sales companies and producers. On a personal note, as someone with Japanese roots, it’s a beautiful opportunity to pay tribute to my cultural heritage.”\n\n\tThe initiative will be jointly organized by the executive committee, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), with UniJapan coordinating participation through the Japan Pavilion at the Village International. Program details and participating companies will be revealed early next year.\n\n\tAt the Tokyo briefing, METI’s Satoru Hayasaka said the selection aligns with Japan’s updated Cool Japan strategy, which targets JPY20 trillion ($131.47 billion) in overseas content revenue by 2033. Japan’s exports have quadrupled in the past decade to JPY58 trillion ($381.26 billion), driven largely by games and animation but with growing potential in live-action film.\n\n\tProducing around 1,200 films a year and drawing 150 million admissions annually, Japan’s local market remains one of the most resilient in the world, with box office receipts exceeding JPY200 billion ($1.31 billion). Officials see Cannes 2026 as a chance to deepen international collaboration and position Japanese storytelling more prominently in the global marketplace.\n\n\tJapan follows Brazil (2025), Switzerland (2024), Spain (2023), and India (2022) as the fifth nation to hold the title since the Cannes market launched the Country of Honor initiative to celebrate standout national industries and foster cross-border partnerships.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrime Video has unveiled the global premiere date for the highly anticipated third season of hit Indian series “The Family Man.” \n\n\tThe critically acclaimed spy action-thriller sees Manoj Bajpayee reprising his role as Srikant Tiwari, the elite undercover operative balancing national security missions with domestic life. The new season introduces formidable antagonists played by Jaideep Ahlawat as Rukma and Nimrat Kaur as Meera, who push the protagonist to his limits.\n\t\n\n\tCreated by Raj & DK under their D2R Films banner, the third season marks an expanded creative team. While the powerhouse duo return as creators, writers and directors, they’re joined by Suman Kumar and Tusshar Seyth as additional directors this season. The series is written by Raj, DK and Suman Kumar, with dialogues by Sumit Arora.\n\n\n\t“‘The Family Man’ has redefined long-format storytelling, becoming part of everyday conversations, social discourse, and the broader cultural zeitgeist,” said Nikhil Madhok, director and head of originals at Prime Video India. “The upcoming season promises an even more thrilling ride, with its signature blend of humor and action backed by stellar performances from the ensemble cast.”\n\n\tThis season finds Srikant on the run, navigating uncharted territories while confronting threats from both within and beyond India’s borders. According to the creators, the stakes have never been higher. “The hunter becomes the hunted, as Srikant faces a threat unlike any before, in the form of Rukma — one that endangers not just him and his career, but his family too,” Raj & DK said. \n\t\n\n\tThe returning ensemble includes Sharib Hashmi as JK Talpade, Priyamani as Suchitra Tiwari, Ashlesha Thakur as Dhriti Tiwari, Vedant Sinha as Atharv Tiwari, Shreya Dhanwanthary as Zoya and Gul Panag as Saloni.\n\n\t“Over the years, the love and adulation that audiences have showered on ‘The Family Man’ have been truly overwhelming,” Raj & DK said. “We know the audience has been patient, and we wanted to ensure that the wait was worth it — raising the stakes this season with even more high-octane action, a gripping narrative, riveting performances, and an elevated, edge-of-the-seat experience.”\n\n\tD2R Films, founded by Raj & DK, has produced hit series including “Farzi” and the global series “Citadel: Honey Bunny,” along with cult favorite films like “Go Goa Gone,” “Shor in the City” and the blockbuster “Stree.”\n\n\t“The Family Man” Season 3 will stream in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide on Prime Video starting Nov.  21.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a potential turning point for vertical video, COL Group has greenlit a sequel to its hit microdrama “From Rags to Rank One,” a rarity in a format that typically tells stories in a single season.\n\n\tThe move signals ambitions beyond the CEO romances and supernatural love triangles that have dominated the space. COL is betting the format can sustain serialized storytelling with genuine franchise potential.\n\n\n\tBased on a popular novel, the original series follows protagonist Xu Mu, a contemporary figure thrust into a chaotic historical realm where his journey takes him from basic survival to saving a nation. The show became a breakout hit in China, pulling in nearly a quarter-billion views on its first day. Users stayed glued for more than an hour on average, driving total views past the two billion mark.\n\t\n\n\tDemand hasn’t cooled. Nearly three million viewers have pre-registered interest in the sequel, suggesting audiences want deeper stories despite the format’s bite-sized delivery.\n\n\tThe follow-up ups the ante considerably. Shot across a month-long production at Hengdian World Studios, the series deployed a cast of more than 40 principal roles supported by a thousand-person crew. The scale includes enhanced production design, period-accurate wardrobe and large-scale action set pieces — a significant leap for vertical content.\n\n\t“This is a telling sign that the microdrama format is evolving,” said Timothy Oh, general manager at COL Group. “What began as fast, snackable storytelling has transformed into a platform for long-form, serialized IPs that audiences truly connect with. The typical CEO and werewolf romance plots are of the past — we’re entering a new era of content that spans genres from fantasy to sci-fi, male-driven adventure and historical epics. It’s happening now, and we expect this trend to accelerate internationally.”\n\t\n\n\tRay Tong, CEO of COL Group, sees broader industry momentum behind the shift. “With the recent shift in focus on microdramas in Hollywood, we’re likely to see even more creative evolution in this space,” he said. “The stories are becoming more layered, the storytelling more cinematic, and the appeal increasingly universal. It’s an exciting time for us and anyone shaping what short-form entertainment can become.”\n\n\tBoth installments of “From Rags to Rank One” are available for international licensing through COL Group, which runs FlareFlow, a U.S.-based app that has become a major player in the vertical drama space.\n\n\tThe company, which went public more than two decades ago, has built a portfolio spanning intellectual property development, production and digital distribution. It claims to operate the largest microdrama distribution operation globally, with libraries in English and Chinese reaching audiences from Asia to the Americas.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJapanese actor Lily Franky will appear in Wayne Wang’s next film “Diary of a Mad, Old Man,” revealed co-star Fan Bingbing at a Q&A session for the film “Mother Bhumi,” in competition at the Tokyo International Film Festival.\n\n\tFranky is best known to international audiences for playing the lead character in Hirokazu Koreeda’s Palme d’Or-winning Shoplifters (2018). He was most recently in Chie Hayakawa’s Cannes competition title “Renoir.” \n\t\n\n\t“I’m very happy that both director Wayne Wang and Lily-san have come to see my film [“Mother Bhumi”], because we’ve just made a film together here in Japan.” said Fan.\n\n\n\t“Diary” is based on the 1961 hit novel of the same name by Japanese author, Tanizaki Jun’ichirō, about an elderly invalid’s erotic obsession with his daughter-in-law.\n\n\tPreviously announced cast members include Gabriel Byrne. The film is produced by Japan’s Fourier Films, LA’s Friendly Giant Pictures and the U.K.’s Good Chaos, among others.\n\n\t“Diary” marks another globe-trotting move by Fan.\n\n\tIn the years since her highly publicised tax problems, the actress has been selectively cultivating her career in international indie productions, a far cry from previous appearances in high concept Mainland films.\n\n\tAt the Q&A session, “Mother Bhumi” director Cheong Keat Aun revealed the extent to which Fan actively sought out the role in the film. Set in a late-1990s Malaysian rice-farming village, “Mother Bhumi,” directed by Chong Keat Aun, follows Hong Im, a widowed farmer and ritual healer who struggles to protect her family and community amid political unrest and land seizures. By day, she resists developers; by night, she heals and exorcises. As colonial-era conflicts resurface, strange events unfold: spirits return, black magic stirs, and the legacy of empire haunts the land. \n\t\n\n\t“The script was written a while back, and my plan was to make it in 2028 or 2029 as my sixth or seventh feature. I was planning to use unknown actors for this film,” said Chong. “Round about December 2023, out of the blue, Fan Bingbing reached out to my producer to set up a meeting. When she heard about the script, she asked me to keep the role for her.”\n\n\t“I told her I don’t normally work with well known actors, but she convinced me by telling me I could destroy her looks in the film. So I did,” continued Chong.\n\n\tFan ended off the session by re-emphasizing her roots, while acknowledging the growing reality of pan-Asian filmmaking.\n\n\t“Fifteen years ago, the Tokyo Film Festival gave me an award. Standing here today to present this film, is very emotional for me,” said Fan. “Further more, as an actress from China, starring in a Malaysian movie. It is a very, very special sort of serendipity.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn this week’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart pointed out all the signs that Donald Trump may be planning for a third term in office. \n\n\tLate into Monday night’s monologue, Stewart played a clip of a journalist asking Trump on Air Force One if he’d be “willing to challenge the court” to serve a third term as president. Trump’s response: “Well, I haven’t really thought about it.”\n\n\n\tStewart facetiously exclaimed in response, “Yes! He’s doing it! ‘I haven’t thought about it.’ That’s the tell for whenever he’s asked about something that he is definitely going to do that is dubious legally, ethically, or morally. He says he hasn’t thought about it, but of course, we know he’s thought about it, because he already has the merch.” The late-night pundit then cut to a photo of two “Trump 2028” hats sitting on the Oval Office desk.\n\t\n\n\t“Now, of course, the negative nellies are going to have issues. They’ll say presidents cannot serve more than two terms, due to the 22nd Amendment,” Stewart added. “But what’s interesting about Trump is he’s actually worked through the various scenarios of running for a third term he has not thought about.”\n\n\n\tBack on Air Force One, a reporter asked Trump if he would run as Vice President to get to a third term. Although the President asserted he’d “be allowed to do that,” he repeatedly deemed the tactic “too cute” for him to try.\n\n\t“Too cute? No, that’s why you don’t go to a Build-A-Bear as an adult,” Stewart joked. “Running as a Vice President to skirt the 22nd Amendment isn’t cute. But he’s the kind of guy who’s like, ‘I respect Americans too much to play games. If I’m going to run again, I’m going to rip off the Constitution’s head and shit down its neck.’ And truth is, indications are very clear he’s going to do it. You don’t move into a house, knock down a wing, and build a 90,000 square foot ballroom for the next guy.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the entire monologue below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Terrifier” actress Catherine Corcoran has sued the producers and series director Damien Leone, alleging breach of contract and the distribution of sexually explicit materials without consent.\n\n\tIn a suit filed in California federal court on Sunday, Corcoran’s attorneys presented a case, defined by the “all-too-common story of low budget film producers taking advantage of a young actress through fraud, sexual harassment and, ultimately, betrayal.” The lawsuit names production banners Dark Age Cinema and Fuzz on the Lens Productions as defendants, in addition to producer Phil Falcone and Leone and the filmmaker’s banner Art the Clown. The filing includes seven claims for relief, including distribution of sexually explicit materials, breach of contract and promissory fraud.\n\t\n\n\tLeone and producers could not be immediately reached for comment. \n\n\n\tCorcoran is best known to “Terrifier” viewers as the centerpiece of one of the original 2016 slasher’s most memorably demented sequences, in which the actress’ character is hung upside down, topless, and slaughtered by the villain Art the Clown. The suit alleges that filming for the sequence required Corcoran to be hung upside down by her ankles for “over 10 hours in below freezing temperatures.”\n\n\tCorcoran is said to have agreed to act in the low-budget “Terrifier” on an “extremely low up front per diem rate,” with the agreement that she would receive 1% of the profits from the film, as well as potential future franchise entries and related merchandise, including other licenses of the intellectual property. Two “Terrifier” sequels have been produced, collectively grossing more than $105 million at the global box office, plus home video profits and “Terrifier”-themed fan events and other modes. The suit claims that director and producer Leone, “agreed in writing to provide Corcoran with a share in 1% of all net sales generated from ‘Terrifier’ related merchandise.”\n\t\n\n\tHowever, Corcoran alleges that, in the years following the original film’s release and its subsequent rise in popularity, her royalty payments “became more and more sporadic and dwindled to amounts nowhere near commensurate.” The actress claims she has not received back pay since July 2024, and had only received $1816.35 up to that point, “with no explanation as to why the royalty payments ceased or where the remainder of the payments are.” Merchandise royalties are said to only total “approximately $6,408.26.”\n\n\tCorcoran claims to have confronted both Falcone and Leone about her royalty payments and that she was “brushed off, with Leone stating that Falcone handles all of the accounting matters and then with an aggressive and defensive response from Falcone saying he purportedly ‘doesn’t keep records.'”\n\n\tAdditionally, while Corcoran’s death scene required her to be nude, the suit claims that the producers “never obtained Corcoran’s informed written consent” to film unclothed, as was required by the Screen Actors Guild. The suit alleges that Corcoran insisted she be allowed to wear underwear on the day of shooting, but that she still ended up performing the scene topless without written consent. It also claims that Corcoran was only provided a horizontal platform to break on between takes upon her request and that she “was wrapped in a blanket in between takes, but overtime the blanket became so saturated with fake blood that it ceased providing any warmth.”\n\n\tAfter filming overnight, Corcoran alleges she felt ill in the following days and that a doctor diagnosed her with cranial swelling and eardrum damage. In an allegation that ties together the suit’s claims of unpaid royalties and unregulated shooting conditions, the suit claims that the defendants have profited from merchandise depicting Corcoran’s nude body.\n",

He said during a recent appearance on “The Penthouse with Peta” podcast that Ravnik has “absolutely no business being a pro” on the long-running competition series.\n\n\t“There’s zero foundation, technique, quality, understanding of the partnership,” Chmerkovskiy said. “Bro, I’m getting emotional.

Ravnik joined the show for Season 34 and is paired with Jen Affleck.\n\n\n\tLater in the discussion, Chmerkovskiy explained he was particularly offended by Ravnik’s performance during “Wicked” night on Oct. 21.\n\n\t“He had no idea what foxtrot is supposed to look like,” he claimed. “How are you going to expect him to teach it and deliver that message in a format that is completely different from even ballroom dancing? We had this criticism weeks ago, and I’m like, ‘Bro, is anybody going to explain it to him?'”\n\n\tChmerkovskiy added that he has “zero against” Ravnik as a person, but called his hiring a “missed opportunity.” Podcast host and fellow former “Dancing with the Stars” pro Peta Murgatroyd agreed, adding that it was “outrageous” that Ravnik was hired despite his perceived lack of ballroom dancing experience.\n\n\t“They hired him. He’s a Taylor Swift dancer. It’s the obvious reason why he is hired,” she added. “Apart from that, he’s a lovely guy. He looks great. He obviously is a great dancer. Hiring a non-ballroom dancer to teach ballroom dancing to a celebrity as a job is outrageous.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIs it time for “Wicked” to conquer the Oscars, for good?\n\n\tUniversal Pictures’ musical fantasy sequel appears poised to match or exceed its predecessor’s impressive showing at the Academy Awards, based on the first social media reactions that were shared on Monday night. \n\n\tDirector Jon M. Chu’s “Wicked: For Good,” written by Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox, continues the story begun in 2024’s “Wicked,” which adapted the first act of the hit 2003 Broadway musical by Stephen Schwartz and Holzman. The follow-up adapts the second act, exploring the aftermath of Elphaba and Glinda’s diverging paths — one as the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, the other as the beloved Glinda the Good.\n\t\n\n\tThe film’s Oscar prospects look strong enough to repeat last year’s 10 nominations, cementing the two-part adaptation as a genuine awards powerhouse, based on the most passionate reactions that have trickled in.\n\n\n\tDeadline awards writer Destiny Jackson praised the film on X, calling it “an epic and heartbreakingly tender conclusion” to Chu’s fantastical saga. \n\n\t“All Good Deeds Go Rewarded in ‘Wicked: For Good,'” she wrote. “It’s an epic and heartbreakingly tender conclusion to one of the most dynamic friendships in pop culture history. There’s a lot for fans of the Broadway show to love with butterfly kiss sized surprises in store.”\n\n\tVariety’s senior artisans editor Jazz Tangcay echoed the praise. She wrote on X that “Wicked: For Good” goes above and beyond “all expectations” and gave particular praise to Chu’s directing. \n\n\t“Jon M. Chu is a genius in the way he brings this to a close,” Tangcay wrote. “Elphaba and Glinda’s stories are expanded, and leave you with an emotional gut punch at the end. Cynthia Erivo is magnificent, but get ready for Ariana Grande as she takes this performance to the next level and is a tour de force. And wow, the world building, the costumes, and Alice Brooks’ cinematography deserve your attention. Can not wait to see it again. I sobbed hard. ‘Wicked: For Good’ is sheer musical greatness.”\n\t\n\n\tVanity Fair staff writer Chris Murphy also shared a glowing review on X, highlighting the performances of stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. \n\n\t“Saw ‘Wicked: For Good’ last month and believe me when I say that it expands and deepens the original source material in generally exciting and innovative ways,” he wrote. “Cynthia and Ari take their performances to the next level with jaw-dropping performances. The film fully sticks the landing.”\n\n\tEntertainment writer David Gordon wrote on X that “Wicked: For Good” was “everything you want it to be,” taking the original vision of the stage play to dazzling new heights.\n\n\tIf ‘Wicked’ part one was faithful to the blueprint of the stage, ‘Wicked: For Good’ builds out the world to create a full and different (but the same) and extremely emotional version of act 2,” Gordon wrote. “It’s a thrill ride and a heartbreaker and it’s sexy and everything you want it to be.”\n\n\tVanity Fair senior awards correspondent Rebecca Ford added to the hype on X, writing, “I spoke w/Jon M. Chu at the SCAD Film Festival just yesterday in front of a very enthusiastic crowd! Now I can finally share that I’ve seen ‘Wicked: For Good’ and he’s done it again! It’s gorgeous, full of heart, and sticks the landing. A beautiful finale.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWICKED, Cynthia Erivo (green face), director Jon M. Chu (center), Ariana Grande (right), on set, 2024.  ph: Giles Keyte /© Universal Pictures /Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Universal/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIf both Erivo and Grande are nominated again for playing Elphaba and Glinda, they would join a very short list, becoming the seventh and eighth performers in Oscars history to be recognized twice for the same role.\n\n\tErivo already made history with the first “Wicked” becoming the second Black woman to receive multiple nominations for best actress after Viola Davis. Oscar winner Davis and two-time winner costume designer Ruth E. Carter are the most Oscar-nominated Black women in history, with four noms each. Erivo is currently tied with Octavia Spencer at three nominations (Spencer has one win). Erivo’s two Oscar noms were for best actress for “Harriet” (2019) and the original song “Stand Up,” becoming the third person to be recognized for acting and music in the same year. I’d keep an eye on Erivo being a frontrunner for the Globe in the lead actress (comedy or musical) category. Whether that can be enough to topple someone like Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”) will be a hurdle the campaign will need to overcome.\n\t\n\n\tThe current landscape of the supporting actress race reveals a genuine — and increasingly promising — pathway for Grande to enter the thick of the conversation for her first Academy Award. Her performance as Glinda is a fully realized piece of acting that balances humor, heartbreak and show-stopping charisma. If the season’s momentum holds, Grande could find herself not only in the mix but a legitimate contender for Oscar gold.\n\n\tSelf-proclaimed “Wicked” experts will often say the second act of the stage show isn’t as strong as the first half since it lacks a showstopper like “Defying Gravity.” However, Chu, along with writers Holzman and Fox, once again elevate the material, particularly in the incredibly emotional “For Good,” which features the most decisive acting moment for both women in both films (possibly the most decisive moment of their careers). Tears will flow, rivers will rise, and Oscar contenders are solidified in those moments.\n\n\tThe film features a mix of beloved songs from the stage musical and two new original numbers: “No Place Like Home,” sung by Erivo’s Elphaba, and “The Girl in the Bubble,” performed by Grande’s Glinda. Both tracks are penned by Schwartz, who also composes alongside John Powell. Added songs in beloved musicals like “Wicked” that are later adapted for the big screen are rarely considered “better” or even match the original material’s praise. Nonetheless, despite those presumed “flaws,” they can still be embraced by the Music Branch, especially if they are considered to be, in the best picture conversation. Those in the last 25 years have included: “Suddenly” from “Les Misérables” (2012), “Learn to be Lonely” from “The Phantom of the Opera” (2004), “I Move On” from “Chicago” (2002), “Take It All” from “Nine” (2009) and the three original numbers from “Dreamgirls” (2006) — “Listen,” “Love You I Do” and “Patience.”\n\n\tWhile both new “Wicked” songs may face mixed reactions, this is the three-time Oscar-winning Schwartz we’re talking about. The branch reveres the legendary musician. Both songs getting nominated might be too ambitious, especially with this stacked field unfolding (i.e., “Golden” from “KPop Demon Hunters”). If one makes it, the smart bet is on “The Girl in the Bubble,” considering its placement later in the movie.\n\t\n\n\tWith “For Good’s” technical categories likely locked for recognition — including the previously winning production design and costume design — along with viable win-worthy makeup, sound and visual effects, you could pencil in “Wicked: For Good” for one of the 10 best picture slots. \n\n\tWhether it translates into more nominations or more wins is a question for the upcoming awards season to answer. One thing that feels certain is the “Wicked” phenomenon isn’t finished casting its spell on Oscar voters.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe “Scrubs” revival has lost one of its two showrunners a few weeks into production, Variety can confirm. Tim Hobert has stepped down from duties co-heading the series due to creative differences, while Aseem Batra will now serve as a solo showrunner as filming continues.\n\n\tHobert and Batra co-wrote the first episode of the “Scrubs” revival, which will see original cast members Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes and John C. McGinley reprising their roles from the original series.\n\t\n\n\tBoth Hobert and Batra are “Scrubs” alumni. Hobert was credited as co-executive producer, executive producer and consulting producer on the original series, while Batra served as story editor, executive story editor and co-producer. Both worked with original series showrunner Bill Lawrence, who remains an executive producer on the revival series through his banner Doozer. Braff, Faison and Chalke are also executive producers, as is Randall Winston.\n\n\n\tHobert will remain credited as an executive producer for the first few episodes of the revival series. Production began in Vancouver in early October.\n\n\tAlong with the original stars, the cast will also include series newcomers Ava Bunn, Jacob Dudman, David Gridley, Layla Mohammadi and Amanda Morrow.\n\n\tThe “Scrubs” revival received a straight-to-series order from ABC in July. The series comes from 20th Century Television. The original “Scrubs” began on NBC, running for its first seven seasons from 2001 to 2008, followed by two seasons at ABC in 2009 and 2010.\n\n\tDeadline was first to report on Hobert’s exit from the “Scrubs” revival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter just one season, Emmy-winning drama “The Pitt” is already having an impact on healthcare conversations. That’s the finding from a new study released Monday by the USC Norman Lear Center, which said “The Pitt” has shifted the conversation on issues such as organ donation and end-of-life planning.\n\n\tAccording to a group of 1,409 viewers surveyed by the Hollywood, Health & Society division of the USC Norman Lear Center, 26.9% of respondents said they were more likely to seek out organ donation information after watching “The Pitt,” while 17.2% said they shared the information with others. The study helpfully noted that the impact was especially great with Black audiences — an important distinction as Black patients are often overrepresented on transplant waiting lists and underrepresented with donors.\n\t\n\n\tAlso, a storyline on “The Pitt” about family members debating over the end-of-life decisions for an ailing father also appeared to have a major impact on viewers. Around 38.8% said they would look deeper into end-of-life planning such as a living will or power of attorney, while 15.3% said they shared this information with others.\n\n\n\tAnd the study found that among the 709 viewers who had watched at least three episodes of “The Pitt,” almost 90% of them said “the series reveals how systemic problems like understaffing affect patient outcomes and helps make provider stress relatable.”\n\n\tThe USC Norman Lear Center Hollywood, Health & Society team also spoke with doctors, nurses and trainees, most of whom confirmed the authenticity of the show’s storylines — such as overcrowding, underfunding and other realities of their work.\n\t\n\n\t“While our primary goal is to create compelling, complex stories, we are also committed to being current and accurate with our portrayal of medical topics,” said “The Pitt” executive producer and writer Joe Sachs, MD. “Because of this, public health education is a wonderful side effect of our dramatic storytelling.”\n\n\tThe study coincides with Monday’s USC Normal Lear Center Hollywood, Health & Society honors, which includes the Culture of Health Award for “The Pitt.” Recent Emmy winner Katherine LaNasa will present the award to exec producer/star (and fellow Emmy winner) Noah Wyle and creator/showrunner R. Scott Gemmill, along with the show’s writing team.\n\n\t“For 25 years, our work has been built upon the idea that stories matter, but conventional wisdom suggests the ‘broccoli’ needs to be hidden in the ‘hamburger’ for audiences to stomach it,” said Erica Rosenthal, director of research at the USC Norman Lear Center. “‘The Pitt’s’ success is a powerful reminder that stories can prioritize accuracy, highlight systemic challenges through authentic characters, spark emotion, and inspire real-world action, all without sacrificing entertainment value.”\n\n\tOther series set to be honored include “Shrinking,” “Dying for Sex,” “Paradise,” “Matlock,” “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Chicago Med,” all of which are being recognized for making a difference in topics including healthcare, racism, climate change, cancer and more. Comedian Carol Leifer is hosting the event, held at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills.\n\n\tIn addition to LaNasa, other presenters include Jason Ritter (“Matlock”), Wendie Malick (“Shrinking”), Sarah Shahi (“Paradise”), Nikki Boyer (“Dying for Sex”) and Jason George (“Grey’s Anatomy”). Among those also in attendance are Lear’s wife, Lyn Lear, as well as the team from Lear’s final show (“Boots”), including actor Miles Heizer and author Greg Cope White.\n\n\tThe 2025 host committee for the awards are Jimmy Kimmel, Judith Light, Lyn Lear, Phil Rosenthal and Yvette Nicole Brown.\n",

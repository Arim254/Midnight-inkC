    "body": "\n\t“Bilyarista,” a billiards drama starring Venice Film Festival best actor winner John Arcilla and featuring cameo appearances from legendary pool players Efren “Bata” Reyes and Francisco “Django” Bustamante, is making its world premiere at the 56th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa.\n\n\tThe feature, directed by Phil Giordano, follows Aya (Loisa Andalio), a young girl from Manila’s slums who dreams of becoming a billiards world champion but is manipulated by her hustler uncle Itoy, played by Arcilla, into playing dangerous underground gambling matches after her father’s murder.\n\t\n\n\tGiordano, an Italian-American filmmaker who previously directed Arcilla in the short film “Supot” (2016), was drawn to the project nearly a decade ago after encountering the Philippines’ underground pool culture during street casting for that earlier work.\n\n\n\t“I was doing street casting for the actors, and one of the kids that we cast, he couldn’t read or write, and he was homeless at the time,” Giordano says. “I saw him go into a pool hall, and he’s like 12 years old, but he was fantastic. He beat this like 40-year-old guy, and he had this expensive pool cue. And I was just fascinated by this world that this exists.”\n\n\tThat fascination led Giordano to discover that the Philippines has produced more world champions in pool than any other country, with Reyes widely regarded as the greatest player of all time. “There’s this whole culture where, because of the climate and the tables and the moisture and the air and the pressure, that is not by accident that all the best players in the world are from here,” he says.\n\t\n\n\tArcilla, who won the Volpi Cup for acting at the 2021 Venice Film Festival for “On the Job: The Missing 8,” describes how he approached the morally complex character.\n\n\t“Even until the last minute, he doesn’t have any guilt about it,” Arcilla says of his character. “My interpretation was supposed to be that he’s not so guilty about it. He always thought that he’s helping the niece. Being unfair to that niece for him is my right, because I’m running the business.”\n\n\tThe actor draws on universal experiences to inhabit the role. “We all have experiences as human beings when we’re not always positive about things. Sometimes we get mad with anything, with something that pisses us off,” he explains. \n\n\tGiordano emphasizes his immersive research approach. “I like to meet a lot of people and ask a lot, learn about people’s lives and hear stories,” he says. “When I was doing the research, I started meeting these characters like the manager, and seeing how the ecosystem works, all the details of the gambling and everything, and not judging the characters and learning how the hierarchy and everything truly is done.”\n\n\tThe production brought together an international crew, with New York-based cinematographer Adam McDaid, whose credits include HBO’s “Single Drunk Female” and Netflix’s “Everything’s Trash,” and camera operator Aaron Brown, who worked on “Mr. & Mrs. Smith,” “Smile 2” and “Past Lives.” Philippine editor Lawrence Ang, who cut Sundance Special Jury Prize winner “Leonore Will Never Die,” handled post-production.\n\n\tThe film is produced by Gale Osorio and Shreyom Ghosh through Leesan OPC Productions Philippines, in association with Terminal Six Post Philippines and Tasia Films Hong Kong. Ghosh, based in Hong Kong after completing an MFA at NYU Tisch School of the Arts, explains his attraction to the project.\n\n\t“What I really like is an outside point of view in a place from where you are not from,” Ghosh says. “Phil, being an Italian American director, was based in Philippines for almost four years. He’s not unfamiliar with the place, but he still brings an eye which other Philippines directors will not be bringing.”\n\n\tThe appearance of pool legends Reyes and Bustamante adds authenticity to the film’s world. “It was everyone’s dream to be like them,” Giordano says. “When John is there and Loisa is there, there’s so many fans. And then when Efren and Django show up, there’s like a whole other breed of fans. It was really generous of them to join the film, and it meant the world.”\n\t\n\n\tArcilla notes the thematic significance of the cameos. “It underlines that there are other avenues for your prodigies to go to. There are other options rather than just use them to be your pawns,” he says. “You don’t even need to go to what you’re doing. There’s a more respectable way, and it was being underlined by the presence of the two greats.”\n\n\tGhosh emphasizes the film’s grounding in reality. “Because it is as a coming-of-age sports drama, which is about aspiration, having them being in that position and broken free of it, it makes it real,” he says. “When people see, ‘oh look, Efren is there,’ this is what we are talking about. This is what we are going and to give people hope.”\n\n\tThe film features an original song by Filipino-American rapper Alex Bruce, signed to Sony Music Philippines. Partnerships include ABS-CBN Entertainment and Sony Music. Color grading was completed at Company3, the facility behind “The White Lotus,” “Deadpool & Wolverine” and “Paddington in Peru.”\n\n\tFollowing its world premiere at IFFI Goa, the film is set for festival circulation, theatrical release and eventual streaming distribution.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRooted in unassuming pastoral rhythms, veteran Kyrgyz writer-director Aktan Arym Kubat’s “Black Red Yellow” gently weaves a placid story of love and tradition around a proud Kyrgyz village that has seen better days. Co-written by Topchugul Shaidullayeva, the delicate drama channels a kind of unfussy and serene clarity that obliquely brings to mind the films of Edward Yang and Yasujiro Ozu. Often erring on the side of excessive stillness and silence, “Black Red Yellow” — this year’s Academy Awards submission from Kyrgyzstan — doesn’t quite find its emotional footing within its compact running time.\n\t\n\n\tStill, there is something worthwhile about the window Kubat opens into the community depicted and all the people who contribute to it in the best way they can. The time period isn’t exactly defined, but there are clear signs that we are sometime in the 1990s, in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union that earned Kyrgyzstan its sovereignty. It’s a transitional period that has proven hard on the villagers. Out-of-work men drink excessively, while women thanklessly try to keep everyone’s lives afloat through cooking, cleaning and raising children.\n\n\n\tBut despite relative scarcity, traditional carpet weaving endures in the village as a lifeline in more ways than one. For the talented Turdugul (an expressive Nargiza Mamatkulova), the film’s central figure and sole weaver, attentively weaving rugs is both a livelihood and a spiritual duty of sorts as she tends to the knots, threads and the colors of the carpets she patiently makes. The key colors of her creations lend the film its title, while also headlining the movie’s obscure chapters. Although a brief synopsis published for the film’s festival run summarizes the colors in the way they symbolize human nature across calmness, intensity and nostalgic melancholy, the film itself doesn’t quite echo this tonal progression — without any distinct ebbs and flows, the whole thing is even-handed almost to a fault.\n\t\n\n\tVia a framing device and flashback remembered by an old woman, we arrive at the village with Turdugul, hired to weave a carpet for the unhappily married couple Shirin (Aigul Busurmankulova) and Kadyr (Mirlan Abdykalykov). The couple’s story isn’t unique, and thus, it represents the region’s hardships in that era — two people in an arranged marriage, increasingly unfulfilled by life’s harsh realities. Concerned more about his horse than his home, Kadyr is often drunk and absent. Feeling left out and trapped, Shirin, on the other hand, goes through various emotional outbursts, worsened by the fact that pregnancy eludes her, despite her intense desire to become a mother.\n\n\tWhile Busurmankulova is deeply committed to the part (and happens to be the most memorable performer in the film), the story’s treatment of Shirin feels unfortunate in some regard. Practical, but rightfully angry and heartbreakingly suicidal, she doesn’t get a lot of sympathy in “Black Red Yellow,” instead represented as a clichéd nagging woman who doesn’t understand the depths of her sensitive husband. An example of this emerges right at the start with Shirin’s first outburst, when Kadyr heroically rescues a goat from drowning and hands it to an old man who claims to be its owner.\n\n\tWhy didn’t Kadyr just keep the goat instead of giving it to someone who’s probably lying? Well, she’s not wrong, not under their circumstances, even though the film goes out of its way to convince us of her shaky moral judgment. It’s almost as if her pesky qualities were conceived only to sell us on the burgeoning romance between Kadyr and Turdugul, who quickly fall for each other without any on-screen chemistry or narrative setup. Forbidden or not, romantic love is the easiest thing to root for in cinema if it’s portrayed with some palpable undercurrent of desire, which is in short supply here.\n\n\tMore convincing in the film is cinematographer Talant Akynbekov’s observant, almost ceremonious lensing of carpet weaving, as well as of the beats of everyday life, sometimes accompanied by the traditional tunes villagers hum. Women’s hands dance across the frame as they embrace the colorful threads in front of them or make fresh bread in wood-burning stone ovens, while men bear heavy-duty labor with the majestic backdrop of mountains and valleys. Elsewhere, a photographer periodically captures idiosyncratic family portraits, with each one telling its own silent story. \n\t\n\n\tThe film’s most powerful scene arrives when Turdugul’s grandmother refuses to sell her property to routine opportunists and laments about a vanishing village that has been slipping through her fingers — an occasion Akynbekov and Kubat approach with an unobtrusive, documentarian aesthetic. Looking for work in big cities, entire families have left the grandma’s neighborhood and the responsibility of maintaining those houses, airing them out when needed, somehow fell onto her. “Who’s going to take this on after I’m gone?” the tired old woman wonders. It’s a scene that underscores the nurturing properties of a sacrificing matriarchal attitude that puts survival and longevity over petty matters that define patriarchal destructiveness. (In fact, this feminine stance makes the story’s questionable treatment of Shirin all the more puzzling.)\n\n\tAfter the principled Turdugul turns down Kadyr, “Black Red Yellow” comes to a satisfying enough close on the heels of a brief third chapter. Sadly, the film leaves a lot of hidden depths unexplored in the lives of both Shirin and Turdugul, as two women burdened by circumstance and a shared sense of duty.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBrendan Fraser has always been transparent about his disappointment in Warner Bros.’s decision to shelve “Batgirl“: the completed, but unreleased DC superhero movie that would have seen the Academy Award-winning actor play the villainous Firefly opposite Leslie Grace as the titular heroine. In an interview with the Associated Press on Nov. 19, Fraser opened up about what was lost for creatives and audiences when the film was blocked from release and what its cancellation communicates about the current state of Hollywood.\n\t\n\n\t“The product— I’m sorry ‘content’—is being commodified to the extent that it’s more valuable to burn it down and get the insurance on it than to give it a shot in the marketplace,” Fraser said. “I mean, with respect, we could blight itself.”\n\n\n\tDirected by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, “Batgirl” was meant to be the next installment in the DC Extended Universe. Alongside Grace and Fraser, the movie was also supposed to introduce Jacob Scipio as Anthony Bressi and Ivory Aquino as Alysia Yeoh in the franchise and reprise J.K. Simmons as Jim Gordon and Michael Keaton as Batman.\n\n\tProduction took place in Scotland between November 2021 and March 2022, but while in post-production, Warner Bros. announced that it would not release the film as scheduled, opting to shelve it as a cost-cutting measure in Aug. 2022. Not a frame of footage has ever been screened publicly.\n\n\t“A whole movie,” Fraser remarked. “I mean, there were four floors of production in Glasgow. I was sneaking into the art department just to geek out.”\n\n\tThe actor continued to talk about the cultural impact that the film could have made. “The tragedy of that is that there’s a generation of little girls who don’t have a heroine to look up to and go, ‘She looks like me.'” Grace would have been the first Batgirl to headline her own film and one of just a handful of women to get a standalone superhero movie in the male-dominated genre.\n\t\n\n\tAt the same time, Fraser also acknowledged that older fans would delight in seeing Keaton return as the Caped Crusader. “I mean, Michael Keaton came back as Batman. The Batman!” he said. Keaton made his debut as Batman in Tim Burton’s 1989 film, “Batman,” and reprised the role in its 1992 sequel, “Batman Returns.” He eventually donned the cape and cowl in the DCEU for the first time in 2023’s “The Flash.”\n\n\tWith Warner Bros now for sale and the DC intellectual property revamped as DC Studios under James Gunn and Peter Safran’s leadership, the odds of “Batgirl” ever releasing seem even more dubious than they did two years ago. \n\n\tFraser won the Academy Award for his performance in 2022’s “The Whale.” He currently stars in “Rental Family” and is confirmed to reprise his role as Rick O’Connell from “The Mummy” in the series’ upcoming fourth installment.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPlatoon One Films has come aboard as distributor and sales agent for “Deshlai” (Zewel), a film from iconoclastic Indian filmmaker Q, with plans to release the project across multiple territories beginning February 2026.\n\n\tThe deal follows the film’s world premiere as the closing night selection at Tasveer Film Festival 2025.\n\n\t“Deshlai” follows a young Bangladeshi TikToker named Zewel who aspires to become a hero on the platform as a matchstick master and firestarter. His rising follower count is disrupted when his elder brother is arrested for selling drugs, forcing Zewel to flee to India and leave behind everything, including TikTok. A larger tragedy awaits him across the border.\n\t\n\n\tThe project, from Q’s Oddjoint, first emerged at Film Bazaar, where it secured a broadcast presale with streamer Chorki in Bangladesh and Luminary Pictures came on board as principal co-producer. This year at the newly rechristened WAVES Film Bazaar, the film closed its distribution deal with Platoon One Films.\n\n\n\tBreaking from the traditional festival circuit route, the film will go directly to audiences with a waterfall theatrical release planned across Bengal, the rest of India, the U.S. and the U.K. starting February 2026.\n\n\t“‘Zewel’ is a film about the underbelly of Bengal, on both sides of the border,” Q said. “A fresh wave of youth has been embracing a new identity. One that defies the archaic, violent stereotype of the disenchanted poor. ‘Zewel’ is soft, humane and vulnerable. I wanted to explore the genuine shift in aesthetics that is inundating this part of the world, the K-pop mania. Most importantly, the film tries to underplay the massive identity and religious politics that the Bengal border has seen since the lines were drawn. Affecting a sense of loss, an unfiltered empathy towards the protagonist in spite of his station, religion or sense of self. ‘Zewel’ is an emotional ride, a quirky, underhand take on a massive issue of cross border migration.”\n\t\n\n\tChorki CEO Redoan Rony said: “We call Chorki the capital of Bengali content – and to live up to that title, we must think and operate at scale. That’s why we’re expanding across borders. Chorki joined this project as part of that vision, driven by a desire to innovate and challenge conventions in the Bengali content industry. Productions like ‘Shaaticup,’ ‘Shaw,’ ‘Myself Allen Swapan,’ ‘Feu’ and ‘Gulmohor’ have already demonstrated this ambition, establishing Chorki as a trusted platform for Bengali-speaking audiences. Collaborating with a director like Q, whose perspective is both fresh and unconventional, is a natural extension of that journey.”\n\n\tRita Meher of Luminary Pictures added: “‘Deshlai’ feels raw, urgent, and completely of this moment as Q captures the young generation authentically. We’re honored to premiere this film at Tasveer, because this is exactly the kind of fearless, boundary-pushing films I like to get involved with.”\n\n\tPlatoon One’s “Bayaan” premiered at Toronto earlier this year and “Bindusagar” at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa, of which WAVES Film Bazaar is the market component. \n\n\tShiladitya Bora, founder of Platoon One Films, said: “Q has always been a fearless and inventive storyteller, and Deshlai is yet another bold leap in his cinematic journey. At Platoon One, we’re committed to championing films that defy convention and expand the language of cinema. Partnering with Q on this project aligns perfectly with our mission of taking disruptive, conversation-starting stories to audiences across the world. We’re thrilled to bring Deshlai to the global stage.”\n\n\tAvinaba Ghosh of Dreams on Sale said: “Independent films have always been an integral part of world cinema and is being well celebrated by Indian cinema as well and it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say, in this regard Q has been a flag bearer. Through his work, he plays an even bigger role in bringing Indian cinema to the world. It was a pleasure to collaborate for ‘Deshlai’ which will not just be an entertaining experience for the audience, but also a doorway to newer avenues for Indian and Bengali cinema.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA report published by the Cairo Film Connection, during Cairo Industry Days (Nov. 16-20), provides key data on recent trends in the Egyptian film industry, including the pivotal role played by Saudi Arabia’s burgeoning exhibition and production sector.\n\n\tEgyptian cinema is the oldest and largest in the Arab world and has enjoyed fluctuating export success over the decades. Recently the foreign market has become more lucrative than the local market, above all for a select number of Egyptian titles.\n\t\n\n\tSaudi Arabia’s rapidly expanding exhibition sector ranks as the primary source of box office revenues for nine out of Egypt’s top 10 film exports between 2021 and 2024. Some 27% of the top 65 films at the all-time Saudi box office are Egyptian.\n\n\n\tA small number of Egyptian films have earned much higher revenues abroad than at home. Romcom “Bahebek” (“I Love You”), starring Tamer Hosni, grossed $2.8 million at home, but became a breakout hit across West Asia, garnering $22.9 million abroad.\n\n\tOther international hits include “Sons of Rizk 3: Knockout” (2024) that grossed $6.1 million in Egypt and $22.3 million abroad, and “A Stand Worthy of Men” (2021), with $1.7 million in Egypt and $18.3 million abroad.\n\n\tIn 2024, Egyptian films were ranked third in the Saudi market share, following U.S. and Indian titles. A total of 33 Egyptian films were released in Saudi Arabia that year, generating over $53 million — more than twice the total revenues earned by all Egyptian films in their domestic market ($23.5 million).\n\n\tEgyptian-Saudi coproductions qualify for preferential tax treatment on their Saudi box office revenues. Recent examples include Hani Khalifa’s thriller, “Flight 404,” which is Egypt’s official submission to the 97th Academy Awards for best international feature.\n\t\n\n\tThe importance of foreign exports has been further leveraged by the fall in the dollar value of Egypt’s box office – from $59.6 million in 2019 to a forecast $36 million in 2025. This fall has been driven by significant exchange rate depreciation of the Egyptian pound. Box office revenues in local currency have actually doubled since 2019, due to the double-digit inflation recorded since 2022.\n\n\tCinemagoing in Egypt is still recovering from the pandemic slump. Admissions were 12 million in 2024 and expected to hit 13.8 million by the end of 2025, close to the pre-pandemic level.\n\n\tThe biggest segment of Egypt’s cinema audience is aged between 18-29 years, representing 20% of the total population and 42.7% of the labor force.\n\n\tEgyptian films are around 20% of all films released, but garner almost 70% of total box office, with U.S. films standing at 28.5% in 2025. High budget Egyptian comedies and action/adventure films traditionally dominate the local box office. In 2025, two Hollywood films entered the Top 10 at the box-office – “F1” and “The Conjuring: Last Rites,” the first time in several years that two foreign titles have entered the Top 10.\n\n\tLocal audiences no longer focus solely on high-budget productions. For example, Omar El Mohandes’ mid-budget comedy “Siko Siko,” starring Essam Omar and Taha Desouky, grossed around $4 million in Egypt and a further $4.2 million in Saudi Arabia, making it the second highest successful film in the history of Egyptian cinema.\n\n\tInterest in arthouse titles is also rising. Khaled Mansour’s 2024 Venice-player “Seeking Haven for Mr. Rambo” (2024), grossed $341,000, ranking as Egypt’s biggest-ever arthouse release.\n\n\tOver recent years, the leading film distributor has been Synergy, but has been surpassed in 2025 by Misr International Films. In 2025, Synergy’s former manager, Ahmed Badawy, launched a new company, Film Square, which is building market share. The principal distributor of foreign films, including Hollywood titles, is United Motion Pictures, which due to the recent success of blockbusters such as “F1” has surpassed several Egyptian film distributors. A rising player is UVF, a subsidiary of the Saudi media conglomerate Arab Radio and Television Network, which the CFC report says focuses on financing and distributing mid-budget Egyptian films as a prelude to releasing them internationally, particularly in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries.\n\t\n\n\tThe CFC report also provides a comprehensive overview of the results of the first 10 editions of the Cairo Film Connection, which through its pitching, mentoring and financial and in-kind awards has played a key role in helping Arab filmmakers complete their films and reach local and international audiences, including A-list festivals.\n\n\tRecent successes include “Four Daughters” (2023) by Kaouther Ben Hania (Tunisia) – that was nominated for best documentary feature in the Academy Awards, “Inshallah a Boy” (2023), by Amjad Al Rasheed (Jordan), that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, and “Aïcha” (2024) by Mehdi Barsaoui (Morocco), which premiered at the Venice Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNima (Tandin Bihda) doesn’t know exactly what she’s looking for at the start of “I, the Song,” which is strange considering that she’s searching for someone who looks exactly like her. The school teacher wants to clear her good name after a racy video has surfaced with a woman who bears a resemblance so strong that the school’s administrator has placed her on leave. However, with all the time in the world to find her doppelganger in Dechen Roder’s intriguing yet intermittently engaging drama, Nima’s search for a stranger she comes to identify as Meto (also played by Bihda) reveals how her own life has seemingly gotten away from her.\n\t\n\n\tBhutan’s selection for the international feature Oscar, “I, the Song” provides a showcase for the natural beauty of the country when Nima’s travels take her from the capital city of Thimpu to the border town of Gelephu. But more provocatively, Roder wanders off the beaten path for a different view of a culture where personal contentment has long been a point of national pride (with surveys used to calculate the Gross National Happiness index). \n\n\n\tEven before Nima is beckoned to the principal’s office to find out she’s lost her job, there’s a feeling of disillusionment. Nima seems adrift when she’s stuck with an overly possessive boyfriend who isn’t entirely convinced it isn’t her in the video despite her insistence. Meanwhile, her mother reminds Nima of more industrious years she spent abroad. As unfortunate as it is to be mistaken for the subject of a viral sex video, the pursuit of the person really in it gives her a renewed sense of purpose.\n\t\n\n\tThat subtle, savvy sense of irony runs throughout “I, the Song” and becomes part of its charm when Nima starts to come alive as it looks increasingly probable that she’s chasing a ghost. Even with the same actress playing them, Nima and Meto aren’t exactly envisioned as two sides of the same coin, but they share a restlessness. The latter, as remembered by others, had a vitality that Nima starts to envy when it’s clear that, in spite of leading a life that was not all that much more interesting, Meto at least had passion. The radiant amber light in which Meto is bathed during scenes of her exploits a few years prior becomes a stark contrast to the cool blue world that Nima inhabits in the present. Roder impressively stages scenes where the two live side-by-side in different timelines, and a slight camera pan shows how close Nima gets to feeling what Meto did while still acknowledging the distance between them.\n\n\tThe sophisticated aesthetics can make the narrative feel a little too basic by comparison when the film primarily hangs on the relationship that forms between Nima and Tandin (Jimmy Wangyal Tshering), a musician who mostly plays to an empty bar that she meets early in retracing Meto’s footsteps. Appearing to know more than he’s willing to let on about his ex’s whereabouts, Tandin becomes a recurring presence in Nima’s investigation, offering some musical interludes if not much else. Not only can he frustrate Nima, but he exemplifies Roder’s occasional tendency to mistake a lack of characterization for mystique when he keeps drawing Nima back despite having little to say. A burgeoning romance isn’t entirely convincing, yet the fact that he takes up as much screen time as he does effectively reflects the real estate that the generally mediocre men in both Nima and Meto’s lives occupy in the women’s minds, preventing them from reaching their full potential, either from suffering their outright condescension or out of concern for how they’ll be perceived if they were to assert themselves in the same way. \n\n\tA vaguely episodic structure that might have otherwise seemed uninspired takes on a certain poignance when Nima is pushed ahead by learning about one situation after another that Meto left behind once they no longer suited her, seemingly giving herself the permission to do the same in her own life. Although that self-realization is timeless, Roder cannily positions it to speak to contemporary times. Nima’s downfall from a viral video could only happen during the digital age. \n\t\n\n\tA visit to a village to see Meto’s grandmother, too blind to recognize the difference between Nima and her own blood, leads to a plea to the young woman before her to reclaim a folk song from the city that stole it from her when she believes she’s been corrupted by modernity. Sometimes “I, The Song” is a bit too quiet to resonate, but it lays bare the echoes of the past in ways that are difficult to shake.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndian filmmaker Raam Reddy is moving ahead with his third feature, “Lavender Fire”, a pared-down coming-of-age drama set in Mumbai’s modelling and influencer scene. The project follows Reddy’s Berlin 2024 title “Jugnuma: The Fable” and his Locarno-winning debut “Thithi” (2015).\n\n\tAfter the large-scale worldbuilding of “The Fable” which was adapted from a 300-page visual concept and featured 600 VFX shots, Reddy says he was ready to reset. “It was everything I dreamed of, but the process was rigorous that I wanted to return to something more spontaneous,” he tells Variety at the WAVES Film Bazaar, the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa.\n\t\n\n\t“Lavender Fire” centres on three Gen Z siblings whose lives converge in Mumbai. Reddy has cast three newcomers from the fashion and creator space. Their story plays out against career pressure, viral visibility and shifting social codes, with a narrative “clock” adding urgency.\n\n\n\tReddy is returning to the method he used on “Thithi,” casting first and writing with the performers. He is developing the film with photographer Mourya Dandu and long-time collaborator Ere Gowda.\n\n\tPositioned as an accessible, non-judgmental look at Gen Z urban culture, the filmmaker sees the project as both locally grounded and globally marketable. “As a millennial, it’s fascinating for me to look at Gen Z culture. The closer I got to it, I realized that the in-the-moment-ness of it is very exciting in its own way. It makes me want to take life a little less seriously. I hope that Gen Z kids have a film that they can call their own and we can introduce that culture non-judgmentally to non-Gen Z people,” says Reddy whose approach will be light, contemporary and rooted in lived-in sibling dynamics, steering away from the heavy craft demands of his previous feature.\n\t\n\n\tReddy plans to shoot in January under his banner Prspctvs Productions and says he is “open to collaborations with financiers and international producing partners.”\n\n\t“I don’t want to be boxed in,” Reddy says of his filmmaking graph. “This one is about instinct and immediacy. After this, I’m ready to scale up again, if the right project calls for it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAI may be accelerating across the film world, but it won’t replace the craft, collaboration and human unpredictability that define cinema — that was the message from Berlinale chief Tricia Tuttle and International Film Festival of India (IFFI) director Shekhar Kapur, who warned that the technology will reshape workflows long before it matches artistic intuition.\n\n\tTuttle noted that easier access to powerful AI tools will not automatically raise artistic standards. “Tools don’t make films good. Storytelling and craftsmanship do,” she said. Kapur agreed, underscoring that AI still cannot reproduce the creative energy that emerges between actors, directors and crew in real time. Using the complexity of the eye as an example, he pointed to the nuances of human expression as areas where digital performance remains limited. “A great actor brings something unpredictable,” which is something that’s not programmable, he said.\n\t\n\n\tThe discussion positioned AI as the latest in a long line of disruptive technologies. Kapur recalled how early digital workflows and early surround-sound mixes were initially overused before the industry learned restraint. He expects a similar trajectory with AI-generated material. “There’s always a phase of overexcitement. Eventually people settle into more balanced use,” he said.\n\n\n\tFor festivals, Tuttle highlighted the operational impact. Berlinale already processes roughly 8,000 submissions yearly; AI is likely to expand that number significantly. She added that quality control, rights verification and originality checks may become more complex as AI-generated content rises.\n\t\n\n\tKapur argued that AI should not be viewed as a direct competitor to theatrical cinema, particularly in markets such as India where the number of screens remains low. Instead, he expects AI-native content to build its own ecosystem in terms of platforms, aesthetics and consumption patterns, similar to the growth of TikTok. “There’s already an emerging AI look. It may not translate to big screens, but it will form its own category,” he said. He also pointed to a potential surge in youth-made AI films, which could create new entry points for non-traditional creators.\n\n\tHowever, Kapur cautioned that heavily AI-based production can reduce the collaborative spirit that defines filmmaking. With fewer people physically involved, directors risk creative isolation. “It’s going to be a bit lonely. I’m anxious about not being able to say action, and not being able to say cut, just sitting behind a computer with somebody,” he said while adding that AI could democratise the entry level for young filmmakers, at the likely cost of reducing collaborative on-set culture, noting the risk of creatives losing the push-and-pull of crew-based production and creative sparring.\n\n\tDuring the session, Kapur shared a trailer of his own AI experiment: his sci-fi project “Warlord” which he is considering releasing open-source. “Every time we talk about space travel, every spaceship has looked the same. Everybody made spaceships space out of metal. Surely there would be some ways to develop fabrics or materials that will self-heal a spaceship if it gets a tear while its crossing dimensions. That’s when I thought of jellyfish. I thought, can I create a spaceship that works like a jellyfish?”\n\n\tTuttle’s concern veered towards compensation and the “extractive nature of this new technology.” She said, “With technology becoming condensed, capital becoming condensed into smaller number of hands, it becomes really difficult for people to make money. That’s what I’m more worried about as a lover of art.”\n\n\tBoth speakers agreed that despite the disruption, AI will not replace traditional cinema but broaden the moving-image field. Festivals, distributors and exhibitors will need to adapt their frameworks – from submission guidelines to rights management and talent development – while maintaining cinema’s core values: emotional authenticity, narrative intention and human presence.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThai debut feature “A Useful Ghost,” which won the grand prix at Cannes Critics’ Week earlier this year, continued its festival success at the 13th QCinema International Film Festival in the Philippines. Directed by Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke, the film won the Asian Next Wave best picture and the artistic achievement award for production design.\n\n\t“A Useful Ghost,” which tells the story of a wife’s spirit reincarnated as a vacuum cleaner amid themes of environmental and family struggles, was also the festival’s closing film. The jury — comprising Filipino actor John Arcilla, Karlovy Vary programmer Martin Horyna, Epic Media’s Bianca Balbuena-Liew, and journalist Liz Shackleton — praised the film “for seamlessly weaving together all the elements of cinema with its playful balance of emotional ambiguity and visual consistency.”\n\t\n\n\tOther major winners included Chie Hayakawa’s “Renoir,” which took best director, while Yui Suzuki won best lead performance for her role as 11-year-old Fuki Okita. Fujimoto Akio’s “Lost Land” received the grand jury prize, and Janus Victoria’s “Diamonds in the Sand” earned best screenplay.\n\n\n\tIn the New Horizons section spotlighting daring debut films, Tan Siyou’s “Amoeba” was named best film. Sophy Romvari’s “Blue Heron” earned the Netpac jury prize, and Reza Rahadian’s “On Your Lap” took best Asian first film.\n\n\tRainbowQC, the festival’s LGBTQ competition, recognized Divine Sung’s “Summer’s Camera” with a special mention, Diego Céspedes’ “The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo” as best LGBTQ film, and Jaume Claret Muxart’s “Strange River” with the jury prize. \n\t\n\n\tArtistic director Ed Lejano talked up the awarded films as “a reflection of QCinema’s continued thrust as a platform of discovery. From among the 18 titles in our three feature competitions, debut films or second-features certainly dominate this year’s line-ups.”\n\n\tIn QCShorts International, JT Trinidad’s “Honey, My Love, So Sweet” won best short film. The Serrano Sisters’ “Surface Tension” was named best Filipino film, Lin Htet Aung’s “A Metamorphosis” received the jury prize, and Dale’s “Si Kara: Ang Babaye Nga Nag Daba Daba” was honored for gender sensitivity.\n\n\tQuezon City, the festival host, was recently designated a UNESCO Creative City for Film, becoming the first city in the Philippines and joining Asian peers like Yamagata and Busan in this distinction.\n",

County Medical Examiner will not be able to establish a cause of death ... sources directly connected to the investigation tell TMZ.\n      \n    \n          According to those sources, the medical examiner received the body in horrendous condition ... it was decapitated, and, while the torso was intact, the limbs had been removed and cut into multiple pieces.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          We're told all of the body parts were \"partially frozen\" ... and had, apparently, been thawing out while sitting in the trunk of D4vd's Tesla.\n      \n    \n          Remember, D4vd's vehicle had not been moved for several days when it was parked on a Hollywood Hills street near his rental home ... which resulted in it getting towed, and then the body being found.\n      \n\n          As TMZ reported, Celeste's body was in such bad shape, initially, investigators did not know if it was male or female.\n      \n    \n          When the body was received by the M.E.'s Office, the initial determination was this was a victim of an \"apparent homicide,\" but our sources say the M.E. is now having trouble establishing an official manner or cause of death, and \"It will most likely be 'undetermined.'\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Other sources connected to the investigation tell TMZ the LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division is viewing Celeste's death as a homicide, and even if the official cause of death is undetermined, authorities can move forward with an arrest.\n      \n    \n          TMZ broke the story, D4vd is now considered a suspect in Celeste's death. What's more, TMZ has learned there is a second suspect who authorities believe helped D4vd in the dismemberment of Celeste's body.\n      \n    \n          Mark Geragos appeared on the most recent \"2 Angry Men\" podcast and said he knows the name of the second suspect, and authorities have told him this person might have been involved \"before, during, and after\" Celeste's death.\n      \n    \n          TMZ also broke the story ... a critical part of the case involves a trip investigators say D4vd took to a remote area of Santa Barbara County in the middle of the night back in the spring, where he spent 2 hours.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          If Celeste's body was taken to that area -- months before it was discovered in L.A. -- it seems the operating theory is the body parts were put in some sort of freezer for a long time before it ended up in D4vd's Tesla in late summer.\n      \n      ",

Three! Two! One! Then I came.”\n      \n    \n          Bizarre, right? Except Matthew says he learned a lesson \"Ghosts of Girlfriend's Past\" style ... realizing he didn't want to be a bachelor forever -- he wanted to be a father and a partner.\n      \n    \n          McConaughey says he stopped looking for the perfect woman ... allowing the universe to simply work its magic instead -- and, just a few months later, he met Camila, the only woman he says he's \"ever wanted to take on a date, sleep with, or wake up next to. \"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Matthew and Camila met in 2006 and welcomed two children together before they married in 2012, and a third just months after tying the knot.\n      \n    \n          Moral of the story ... big life lessons can hit when ya least expect it ... just make sure to shower off after they do.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Camila Alves\n              \n                          \n                Matthew McConaughey\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

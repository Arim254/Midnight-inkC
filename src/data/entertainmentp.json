Oct. 7. Fans of the rocker and those interested in his life’s story can stream it on <a href=\"https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_variety?q=https%3A%2F%2Fparamountplus.qflm.net%2Fc%2F256585%2F175360%2F3065%3FsubId1%3DVR%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.paramountplus.com%252F&p=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2025%2Ffilm%2Fnews%2Fhow-to-watch-ozzy-osbourne-documentary-online-streaming-1236542441%2F&ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&event_type=click\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+.</a></p>\n<p>\n\tDirected by Tania Alexander and produced by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sharon-osbourne/\">Sharon Osbourne</a>, “No Escape From Now” was never meant to be a posthumous tribute to Ozzy. The project was documenting the singer-songwriter’s late life as he struggled with Parkinson’s disease, pneumonia, sepsis, a broken neck and more, when he passed away on July 22. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe two-hour long documentary shares an intimate glimpse into Ozzy’s tumultuous final years, as he strived to continue with his passions despite physical setbacks. The film shows how to rocker’s tenacious spirit motivated him to create the 2020 album “Ordinary Man” and the 2022 album “Patient Number 9,” to perform at the Commonwelath Games’ closing ceremony in 2022 and his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2024, and to deliver his emphatic “Back To The Beginning” final performance with Black Sabbath in his hometown of Birmingham just seventeen days before his death.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAlongside exclusive footage of Ozzy and his family, “No Escape From Now” features interviews with fellow rockers Zakk Wylde, Andrew Watt, Billy Morrison, Billy Idol, Black Sabbath’s Tony Iommi, Guns N’ Roses’ Duff McKagan and Slash, Metallica’s Robert Trujillo and James Hetfield, Tool’s Maynard James Keenan, Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Chad Smith, Rage Against the Machine’s Tom Morello, Alice In Chains’ Mike Inez and Smashing Pumpkins’ Billy Corgan, all reflecting on Ozzy’s incomparable musical impact.</p>\n</div>",

    "description": "<div><p>\n\tAnd then there were two.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/noah-oppenheim-leaves-nbc-news-reorganization-re",
    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAnd then there were two.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/noah-oppenheim-leaves-nbc-news-reorganization-rebecca-blumenstein-1235486142/\">After unveiling an unorthodox three-division structure for NBC News in 2023</a>, the top executive overseeing news operations at NBCUniversal, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/cesar-conde/\">Cesar Conde</a>, is bringing two units under a single person’s oversight.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a memo sent to staffers Monday, Conde revealed that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/janelle-rodriguez/\">Janelle Rodriguez</a>, who has overseen “NBC Nightly News” and the live-streaming service <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nbc-news/\">NBC News</a> Now will report to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rebecca-blumenstein/\">Rebecca Blumenstein</a>, NBC News’ president of editorial, who has responsibility for newsgathering as well as “Meet the Press” and “Dateline.” Rodriguez will continue to supervise the operations already under her aegis, but she will no longer have a direct line to Conde, as she had in the past. Libby Leist, who oversees NBC News’ multi-hour “Today” franchise, will continue reporting to Conde.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tConde said the moves were made to bolster a new  “story-centric” approach that “further align our award-winning broadcast, streaming, digital and audio newsrooms. It will enable us to strengthen editorial oversight across all our platforms, build on our exclusives and the original storytelling that is distinguishing our journalism, and expand the reach of our content in ways that are unique to our organization.” \n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe new structure was unveiled on a day when NBC News and MSNBC were formally separated from one another, as parent<a target=\"_blank\"> Comcast sets about spinning off the bulk of its cable properties </a>into a new company called Versant.</p>\n<p>\n\tBoth Rodriguez and Blumenstein have had notable achievements in recent months. Rodriguez supervised a recent anchor transition at “NBC Nightly News” from Lester Holt to Tom Llamas, and the broadcast has on some evenings won more viewers than ABC’s first-place “World News Tonight” among viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most coveted by advertisers. Blumenstein has overseen the a continued expansion of “Dateline” into digital venues such as podcasts and the rise of “Meet the Press” in the same advertiser demo. She was also at the helm as “Meet the Press” moved from Chuck Todd to current moderator Kristen Welker.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd yet, Rodriguez has more experience in TV news than Blumenstein, who nonetheless has impeccable journalistic credentials garnered from a career at The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe choice to broaden Blumenstein’s oversight comes as mainstream TV-news divisions are grappling with difficult economics as consumers get more of their headlines and information from mobile video and social media. Others are also tapping executives who in years past might not been seen as obvious candidates. Warner Bros. Discovery’s CNN, for example, recently unveiled the hire of Bridget Ruane, who has worked as an executive coach and consultant at ZRG Partners and the former Sucherman Group. Ruane was named “head of organizational change” at CNN and has been tasked with looking at “operational and organizational design and new ways for us all to work together  on our shared goals,” CNN CEO Mark Thompson recently detailed in a memo.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe desire to shake up traditional TV-news executive structure got a giant spotlight on Monday when Paramount Skydance named Bari Weiss, a digital-media entrepreneur with no history running a large TV operation, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/paramount-bets-bari-weiss-cbs-news-free-press-1236540961/\">as the editor in chief of CBS News</a>. Weiss’ hire has gained so much notice because she has made her mark as an opinion writer, not as a mainstream fact-gatherer, and her stands on various issues would seem to tilt CBS News away from the neutral stance it tries to maintain.</p>\n<p>\n\tConde offered details on other new initiatives at NBC News, noting that a launch is looming <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nbc-news-mobile-first-service-q4-launch-1236322950/\">for a new NBC News subscription service</a> “that will feature the best of our coverage and include new premium offerings.” That new product is expected to aim for mobile customers. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nbc-news-sports-coverage-kentucky-derby-1236385207/\">NBC News is also expanding its recent foray into sports news</a>, an effort made as NBCUniversal pivots more strongly into sports with the launch of an 11-year NBA rights deal, and prepares for Super Bowl, World Cup and Winter Olympics coverage in 2026. NBC has also been in talks with Major League Baseball about running a Sunday-night package of games, according to two people familiar with the matter, that would have the NBC broadcast network hosting top sports on most Sunday nights throughout the year, adding baseball to NFL and NBA games on Sunday evenings.  </p>\n<p>\n\tConde also  noted that NBC News will soon launch a new marketing campaign “that will reinforce our reputation for rigorous fact-based reporting that is indispensable and accessible across all platforms for all,” which he billed as “the first such campaign in modern memory.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tConde suggested NBC News would have more new ideas in future months. “Our strategic priorities continue to focus on content, innovation and culture,” he said. Even so, NBC News will do all that with two business divisions rather than three.</p>\n</div>",

Apple’s audio engineers have also implemented spatial audio in these cans, which creates a more natural and realistic listening experience. Music floats <em>around</em> you rather than directly <em>at</em> you, while “dynamic head tracking” technology keeps the sound at ear level, even if you’re on the move.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe AirPods Max come with active noise cancellation technology (ANC), which helps to block out ambient noise. It makes these headphones especially <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/shopping/tech/twelve-south-airfly-wireless-audio-transmitter-review-1235657157/\" target=\"_blank\">great for traveling</a> or for work. Turn on “transparency mode” when you need to let a little outside noise in, say, to be alerted to traffic, or to hear a colleague speak.</p>\n<p>\n\tBattery life is super strong on the AirPods Max, with up to 20 hours of playtime on a single charge. A quick five-minute charge gets you 1.5 hours of listening time.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe like the instantly-iconic design of these Apple headphones, which feature oversized memory foam ear cushions and a knit-mesh headband (which never gets sweaty). Adjust the headband to find your most comfortable fit.</p>\n<p>\n\tNormally $549+, get the Apple AirPods Max Headphones on sale for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_variety?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized%2Fdp%2FB0DGJKT2X9%3Fcrid%3D340BJBE3MSSL3%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Kz8uKephE8nrqAmMLFMrVrnY_EEBwQ1SxIciejMjeaoFHf-8RU-e4KE12LafEuKP9Nx8-JhGa3cxCok3OMqIwobKeLPr89Do6hkuUdJcNDsi36zwyrcgqqDPDP4yGBYdTc160B5XQRCLcSo9D4mNtTSAtfM375v0AAC_F-TM6ovYwNF4QJE5X5i-GoLeiocrQoCaTkNuvBEhw1IrqhGOZ127YEY64VMZbEB35MFYfYw.qMyagyIAU7i69qnUQWtAtiUXTPcVNYSliom7c9i-3Ac%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3Dairpods%252Bmax%26qid%3D1751996721%26sprefix%3Dairpods%252Bma%252Caps%252C174%26sr%3D8-3%26th%3D1%26linkCode%3Dll1%26tag%3Dvariety0e8-20%26linkId%3D2a9b7b71ffd5eedf6b4d0abde71b77df%26language%3Den_US%26ref_%3Das_li_ss_tl%26asc_source%3Dweb%26asc_campaign%3Dweb%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvariety.com%252F2025%252Fshopping%252Fnews%252Fapple-airpods-max-headphones-deal-sale-1235658410%252F&p=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2025%2Fshopping%2Fnews%2Fapple-airpods-max-headphones-deal-sale-1235658410%2F&ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&event_type=click\">just $429 at Amazon.com</a> — a 22% discount.

Apple says this version of the buds deliver 2x the noise-cancelling features as previous models</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_variety?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGJKT2X9%3Ftag%3Dvariety0e8-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26language%3Den_US%26asc_source%3Dweb%26asc_campaign%3Dweb%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvariety.com%252Fshop%252Fbest-apple-deals-1234996962%252F&p=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2Fshop%2Fbest-apple-deals-1234996962%2F&ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&event_type=click\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screen-Shot-2025-07-10-at-1.51.40-PM.png 1800w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screen-Shot-2025-07-10-at-1.51.40-PM.png?resize=150,109 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screen-Shot-2025-07-10-at-1.51.40-PM.png?resize=300,218 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screen-Shot-2025-07-10-at-1.51.40-PM.png?w=1024\" alt=\"Best Apple Prime Day Deals 2025: $89 AirPods, $799 MacBook Air Sale\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBEST HEADPHONES DEAL\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h3 id=\"c-title-68e57d6303aac2.24982218\">\n\t\t\t\t\tApple AirPods Max Wireless Over-Ear Headphones\t\t\n</h3>\n\t<p>\n\t\tThanks to their over-the-ear design, the premium Apple AirPods Max are some of the best noise-cancelling headphones to buy right now.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tRIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil – <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rosane-svartman/\">Rosane Svartman</a>, the renowned American writer-director naturalized in Brazil behind hits on TV (“On the Fence,” “Dona de Mim”) and film (“Desenrola”), is partnering once again with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/elo-studios/\">Elo Studios</a> for “Garota” (“Girl” in literal translation). The new collaboration comes on the heels of “(Des)controle,” which just had its world premiere at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rio-film-festival/\">Rio Film Festival</a>. It solidifies Elo Studios’s interest in stories penned by Brazilian female directors like Susanna Lira, whose “Salve Rosa,” a co-production with Paramount Pictures, has also premiered at this year’s event. Shooting is scheduled for 2026.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tElo Studios will produce and distribute “Garota,” which follows the story of a 52-year-old woman who sees her life turned upside down when she loses her job, enters menopause, and begins caring for an older dog abandoned by her mother. Once she begins posting about the dog online, the woman enters a tricky digital world while also having to navigate the even trickier waters of ageing. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking with <em>Variety </em>out of the Rio Film Festival, Svartman says she was “immediately” drawn by the project when Sabrina Wagon, Elo Studios’s CEO, presented it to her. “This is a woman who is dealing with the challenges and surprises of menopause through an elderly dog no one wanted. I joined the project believing in the importance of bringing to light this woman who feels invisible. I thought: I want to watch this film.” </p>\n<p>\n\tWagon points out “Garota” was born out of a prize created by Elo Studios in partnership with Telecine at the Cabíria Screenplay Festival to award the best plot-line by an up-and-coming screenwriter. Adriana Calabró won the inaugural edition with what the exec calls a “potent” idea. The production company then brought in seasoned screenwriter Flávia Guimarães to work alongside Calabró, eventually booking Svartman to direct following their collaboration on “(Des)controle.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAsked about Brazilian cinema’s recent interest in stories about women over 50, including Gabriel Mascaro’s “The Blue Trail” and Glória Pires’s “Sexa,” Svartman says there is a simple answer to this trend: “cinema is a mirror to society.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“The same sense of invisibility older women face in daily life has been replicated for a long time in the audiovisual sector,” she adds. “But these women are alive, having fun, having sex, anxiety crises and reinventing themselves at 50. Those stories are fodder for great films.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the more analytical side, Wagon points out how there is a “structural change in consumption and investment.” ‘The longevity economy now corresponds to a huge slice of the world’s gross domestic product, with projections stating that over 50s have contributed over US$45 trillion to the GDP in 2020 and can pass US$100 trillion by 2050. This audience has great purchasing power and is still underrepresented onscreen. ‘Garota’ aims to fill this gap with great humor.” </p>\n<p>\n\tThe exec also adds that only 1.4% of characters in advertising in Brazil in 2024 were over 60+ and, in 2023, only 30% of protagonists were women. “Discussions of menopause have also increased in the public realm. The hashtag #menopause has billions of views on TikTok, and numbers point to an expanding market (from US$18 billion in 2024 to US$27 in 2030).” </p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking about what motivates her to continuously support the making of stories like “Garota,” Wagon says it stems from a desire to invest in “lasting partnerships.” “There is a moment where we start choosing not only what stories to tell but who to tell them with. To age within the film industry is to learn how to be selective, prioritize projects that have an impact and real connections with the audience.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for Svartman, she says working with Wagon and Elo Studios makes her feel confident that a project will be made “with the dedication and support to gather all needed creative resources so we can make the best possible film. And that’s not easy to find.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“Monster: The Ed Gein Story” debuted with 12.2 million views in its first four three on Netflix. </p>\n<p>\n\tThat’s just a hair lower than the debut of “Monsters” Season 2, subtitled “The Lyle and Erik Menendez” story, which reached 12.3 million views in 2024. However, the “Menendez” debut was calculated over a four-day opening weekend, while “Ed Gein” only had three days to rack up views before the release of the Netflix Top 10. It’s presumable that the latter would have accrued enough views in a fourth day to surpass its predecessor.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe new season of Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan’s crime anthology series landed in second place on the English-language TV chart during the week of Sept. 29-Oct. 5. The only show to beat it was “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/wayward/\">Wayward</a>,” Mae Martin’s mystery series that achieved 14.1 million views this week after debuting on the top of the chart the week before. In third place after “Ed Gein” was “House of Guinness” with 6.4. million views in its second week on the chart.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSeason 9 of “Love Is Blind” debuted at No. 4 with 3.7 million views, and was followed by the third week of “Black Rabbit” with 3.3 million. Season 2 of “Wednesday” had its ninth week on the chart with 3 million views, landing at No. 6. </p>\n<p>\n\tSeason 1 of “Dark Winds” took seventh place with 2.8 million views. While the AMC drama first landed on Netflix back in August and charted for two weeks in a row, the addition of Season 3 to Netflix on Oct. 1 has clearly boosted viewership of all available seasons.</p>\n<p>\n\tRounding out the bottom of the chart were the Sept. 29 edition of “Raw: 2025” (2.3 million views), “Doc” (1.7 million views in its second week) and “Ms. Rachel” (1.6 million views in its 25th week on the chart, non-consecutively).\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSee the Netflix Top 10 for Sept. 29-Oct. 5 below, beginning with English-language movies and shows and followed by non-English-language movies and shows.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.15.37-PM.png 1272w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.15.37-PM.png?resize=150,123 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.15.37-PM.png?resize=300,246 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.15.37-PM.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.15.53-PM.png 1272w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.15.53-PM.png?resize=150,123 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.15.53-PM.png?resize=300,246 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.15.53-PM.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.16.07-PM.png 1256w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.16.07-PM.png?resize=150,125 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.16.07-PM.png?resize=300,249 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.16.07-PM.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.16.23-PM.png 1234w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.16.23-PM.png?resize=150,125 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.16.23-PM.png?resize=300,250 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-3.16.23-PM.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>",

But Weiss didn’t test well with audiences, who didn’t understand her centrist-right contrarian politics. In fact, her focus group scores were so low that she wasn’t invited back to guest host, according to insiders. Instead, Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House director of strategic communications, landed the gig.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe rejection turned out to be a blessing for Weiss. Instead of playing sixth fiddle on a show consumed by middle-class Resistance moms, the 41-year-old mother of two is now one of the most powerful women in news. On Oct. 6, Paramount Skydance CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/david-ellison/\">David Ellison</a> announced that the media conglomerate had acquired The Free Press for $150 million and named Weiss editor-in-chief of CBS News, where she will oversee a sprawling operation despite having no broadcast news experience. If Ellison and his father, tech mogul Larry Ellison, get their wish and buy Warner Bros. as well, the former New York Times opinion writer and editor — who rode the wave of anti-woke sentiment during the Biden administration and positioned herself as a billionaire whisperer — may also have CNN as part of her fiefdom.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNaturally, a broad swath of staffers at CBS News are aghast. The under-35 pro-Palestinian set bristle at Weiss’ vocal support of Israel. Older news veterans see her coronation as part of the Ellisons’ ongoing capitulation to Trump, which began when CBS News settled a defamation lawsuit with the president for $16 million so that the Federal Communications Commission would approve the Paramount-Skydance merger. (Larry Ellison is a regular at the White House and Mar-a-Lago.) But Weiss is far from beloved by the upper reaches of MAGA world. One high-profile conservative scoffed at the idea of Weiss being one of them, noting that the White House continues to deny The Free Press credentials.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, Weiss has a strong desire to be in front of the camera. Sources say she discussed having an on-camera role, although not with “60 Minutes,” during negotiations. Weiss and Ellison both declined to comment for this story.</p>\n<p>\n\t“She plays to an audience of 200 people,” says one Hollywood executive with ties to Weiss. “It just happens to be that audience is made up of people like Jeff Bezos and Bill Ackman. The superrich fucking love her. She’s funny, she’s smart and she’s aligned with their politics.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFormer colleagues are mixed in their assessment of Weiss.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Bari is a thoughtful and creative leader who is deeply committed to journalism’s historic ideals: honesty, doggedness and fierce independence,” says Alex Chitty, who worked with Weiss at The Free Press. “Any journalistic institution would be lucky to have her in charge.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBut another former colleague is unimpressed with her pivot.</p>\n<p>\n\t“She’s just gaming the system, with billionaires funding her career,” says the colleague, who worked with Weiss during her New York Times days. “She’s never worked in a newsroom traditionally in the way that she’s going to. It just feels like cheating.”</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul Friedman, a former top executive at both ABC News and CBS News, says his onetime colleagues at the latter are “terrified” about the prospect of Weiss’ reign.</p>\n<p>\n\t“She’s been extremely outspoken about her views. She said some things that I can’t conceive of somebody running a news division saying out loud,” Friedman says. “We can only hope she means what she’s said about wanting to ensure fair and balanced journalism. But there’s very little reason to hope for that, based on her record and on Paramount’s behavior in settling a spurious suit against CBS News and diminishing ‘60 Minutes.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tSome insiders were horrified by a different kind of bias at CBS News before Weiss’ arrival, noting the treatment of “CBS Mornings” anchor Tony Dokoupil. Senior network executives rebuked Dokoupil in front of staff over an interview with author Ta-Nehisi Coates, accusing him of not adhering to the network’s editorial norms. The incident likely would not have surfaced publicly had The Free Press not obtained and published parts of the audio from the internal meeting.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Tony incident is exactly why someone like Bari was brought in,” says one rep with several CBS News clients.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome have suggested that the Ellisons overpaid for The Free Press. But one year ago, the outlet was valued at $100 million following a $15 million funding round. While many of the backers remain anonymous, known investors include Marc Andreessen, David Sacks, Paul Marshall, Howard Schultz and Allen & Co.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhether Weiss is hobnobbing in Sun Valley or flying private, friends say she projects an air of belonging. She attended Bezos’ wedding and counts Bill Maher and Kim Kardashian among her friends.</p>\n<p>\n\t“She’s crazily charismatic. She generally doesn’t bring up politics very much when you talk to her interpersonally,” says the Hollywood executive. “[But Paramount now] has a political agenda. It feels like it’s even more the case than Fox under Rupert Murdoch did.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLast year, Weiss uprooted from Los Angeles with her wife, New York Times alum Nellie Bowles, and their kids to New York. As her visibility grew, so did The Free Press’ team of WME reps, which includes agency president Ari Greenburg. (WME did not, however, have any role in Weiss’ CBS News deal.) Weiss began pulling down as much as $150,000 per engagement, a point of contention in the pro-Israel space, where advocates give speeches for free.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Clearly she’s brilliant if she’s gotten herself to this place,” says the former colleague. “But everything is transactional with Bari.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Brent Lang contributed to this report. </em></p>\n</div>",

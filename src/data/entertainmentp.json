    "body": "\n\tMadrid-based Onza Distribution has picked up international sales rights to Portuguese epic drama “Star Sailors” (“A Travessia”), adding a cinematic adventure to its 2026 lineup at a moment when buyers are still chasing premium European series with potential to become TV events.  \n\n\tProduced by Portugal’s David & Golias, the series dramatizes a formative moment in early aviation: the audacious bid by Portuguese Navy officers Sacadura Cabral and Gago Coutinho to cross the widest stretch of the South Atlantic in the early 20th century, when flight remained experimental, navigation was fragile and the ocean still defined the limits of modern travel. \n\t\n\n\tThe series is comprised of six, 45-minute episode series. “Star Sailors” is positioned as a blend of adventure, drama and historical spectacle, following a group of trailblazing aviators propelled by discovery and risk-taking — a narrative engine designed to travel across borders, with period production value doing much of the global-language lifting.\n\n\n\tDirected and produced by David & Golias’ co-founder Fernando Vendrell (“Dribbling Fate,”Três Mulheres”), the series’ scripts are credited to Filipe Santos (“Duelo”), João Canelo, Tota Alves (“Dolores”) and Diogo S. Figueira (“Sagrada Família,” “Três Mulheres”). \n\n\t“Star Sailors” toplines Gonçalo Waddington (“Auga Seca,” “Grand Tour”), Miguel Damião (“Turn of the Tide,” “O Atentado”), Vicente Wallenstein (“Your Face Will Be the Last”), Júlia Palha (“Senhora do Mar,” “Ordem Moral”) and Soraia Chaves (“The Drought,” “Operación Marea Negra”).\n\t\n\n\tFor Onza, “Star Sailors” reinforces a broader strategy of bolstering its scripted offer with internationally comprehensible, returnable genres (period drama, thriller, crime) that can cut through at markets.\n\n\tThe company, which distributes content to more than 120 countries, is expected to roll out the title across the main 2026 content marketplaces as it courts platforms and networks hunting for premium historical drama with scale.\n\n\t“‘Star Sailors’ emerged as an epic journey made possible by its profound purpose: Inspired by the determination and bravery of aviation’s early pioneers, we strongly believed their legacy would illuminate our path to the future,” said David & Golias’ Vendrell.\n\n\t“Our collaboration with Onza Distribution promises to elevate this vision, offering an ‘extraordinary flight’ that invites people worldwide to embark on this adventure with us,” he added.\n\n\tBlending adventure, drama and historical relevance, “Star Sailors” stands as a premium European fiction project with strong international resonance. “This project reflects our dedication to delivering innovative, high-quality series that captivate audiences worldwide,” added Erika Gómez, head of sales at Onza Distribution. \n",

    "body": "\n\tEuropean Film Promotion has revealed the 10 emerging acting talents selected for the 29th edition of the European Shooting Stars, who will be presented to the film industry, the media and the public during the 76th Berlin Film Festival, running from Feb. 12-22.\n\n\tThe program is designed to boost the international visibility of the actors, connect them with key decision-makers and highlight their potential at a pivotal stage in their emerging careers. They will take part in a four-day program during the Berlinale, featuring networking sessions, industry meetings and press events, as well as a red-carpet moment at the Berlinale Palast, where they will be presented on stage.\n\t\n\n\tPast Shooting Stars include Riz Ahmed, Carey Mulligan, Alicia Vikander, George MacKay and Maisie Williams.\n\n\n\tThis year’s Shooting Stars were selected by an international jury consisting of Danish actress Danica Ćurčić, Bosnian Academy Award winning director Danis Tanović, British-Sudanese critic and writer Leila Latif, Belgian producer Jacques-Henri Bronckart, and Portuguese casting director Jo Monteiro.\n\n\tThe European Shooting Stars 2026 are Fatlume Bunjaku (Albania), Lucas Englander (Austria), Violet Braeckman (Belgium), Salif Cissé (France), Enno Trebs (Germany), Danielle Galligan (Ireland), Tecla Insolia (Italy), Joes Brauers (The Netherlands), Sofia Tjelta Sydness (Norway) and Cleo Diára (Portugal).\n\n\tSince Bunjaku’s debut in 2013, she has steadily built an impressive portfolio, from winning best actress at the Nine Eleven Film Festival to her striking turn in Ujkan Hysaj’s “Hana” (2025). In addition to her screen work, she is committed to inclusive arts education, teaching performing arts and holding a master’s degree in children’s theater. According to the jury, she “leaves an indelible mark on the viewer,” demonstrating a “commanding screen presence, complete with a striking emotional depth,” while they are excited “to see what she does next.”\n\t\n\n\tEnglander originally considered a diplomatic career before discovering his passion for acting. His versatility has since been demonstrated in projects such as “Transatlantic” (2023), the César best newcomer-shortlisted “Appearances” (2020), and his role opposite Nicole Kidman in the series “Nine Perfect Strangers” (2025). The Austrian actor will next star in Adrian Goiginger’s “Das Café ohne Namen.” The jury highlights that Lucas “is exceptionally versatile and moves effortlessly between roles and languages with a real freedom, and impressive ability to transform.”\n\n\tBraeckman built a multidimensional career across theater, television and music videos before shaping a strong presence in cinema. With roles in Teodora Ana Mihai’s “Heysel 85” (2026), “First Zone” (2026) and “The Age of Magic” (2026), as well as the Netflix series “The Twelve,” she continues to expand her range. She has a parallel career curating arts festivals. The jury commends her performance in “Heysel 85,” where she “balances the conflict beautifully, capturing your attention from the first moment. She is chameleonic, delivering with no restrictions.” The jury added, “Being a chameleon is the rarest talent you can find.”\n\n\tCissé discovered acting at 18, a late but decisive start that soon led to a César nomination for Most Promising Actor for “All Hands on Deck” (2020). He has since demonstrated an exceptional ability to blend humor and emotional weight in films such as “Filmlovers!” (2024), “Guess Who Is Calling” (2025) and the series “Lupin” (2023). More recently, he won over audiences in Cannes with his performance in “Meteors” by Hubert Charuel (2025), while also nurturing ambitions to move into directing. The jurors describe his performance in the latter as one that “evokes deep empathy, bringing warmth and a gentle power to this antihero.” They also said that he is “a pure charisma machine; you cannot help but be intrigued and charmed by him.”\n\n\tTrebs began his career with a remarkable debut in Michael Haneke’s Palme d’Or-winning “The White Ribbon” (2009). He has since developed into one of Germany’s most intriguing young performers, collaborating with Christian Petzold in “Undine” (2020), “Afire” (2023) and “Miroirs No. 3” (2025). He now takes on a leading role in Nicolas Ehret’s “Echo of Tomorrow’s War” (2026). The jury observes an “intense, precise actor who combines a youthful energy with a distinct maturity,” noting in his latest performance “six levels of emotion that he is playing all at once. His balancing of kindness and brutality is astonishing. You believe in both.”\n\t\n\n\tGalligan trained at The Lir Academy and first made her mark in theater before transitioning to screen roles that quickly showcased her versatility. Following early appearances in “Game of Thrones,” she has become a compelling lead in series such as “Shadow and Bone” and “Kin” (both 2021) and she was most recently seen in Steven Knight’s “The House of Guinness” (2025). Her acclaimed film performance in “Lakelands” (2022) earned her IFTA nominations for Best Lead Actress and Rising Star. According to the jury Danielle is “a charismatic, transformative talent,” highlighting in “The House of Guinness” that there is “something very classic about her, bringing a brittle element to her performance, with a fierce, humoristic, and playful demeanour that lights up every scene.”\n\n\tThe youngest of this year’s selection is Insolia, who has already crafted a promising career. After early roles in “L’allieva” (2018) and “Off Grid” (2020), she gained international attention as the protagonist of Valeria Golino’s “The Art of Joy” (2024). This was followed by strong performances in “Familia” and “L’albero” (both 2024), as well as in Amata and Damiano Michieletto’s “Primavera” (both 2025). The jury members admire the Italian actress for bringing “real force to intense roles, with a magnetism that commands the screen. She catches the light and projects power while also delivering nuance and fragility.”\n\n\tBrauers began acting at eight and has since built a diverse career, including roles in “Quo Vadis, Aida?” (2020), “Do Not Hesitate” (2021) and “Hardcore Never Dies” (2023). He next appears in Sander Burger’s “Youri” (2026), portraying a journalist in 1980s Amsterdam. The jury points to his “impressive physical transformation, shifting from hardened to gentle with ease,” and are convinced that he has the “gravitas and the ingredients to become a big movie star.”\n\n\tTjelta Sydness first gained recognition through her standout performance in “Delete Me” (2021), earning a Gullruten nomination and establishing herself as a rising talent. She has since appeared in Netflix’s “Midsummer Night” (2024), taken on a key role in Ruben Östlund’s “The Entertainment System Is Down,” and demonstrated her range in the drama “Fighter” (2026), directed by Irasj Asanti. The jury describe her as “fresh, direct and unpretentious,” praising her “vivid, precise screen presence,” concluding that she is “talented, beautiful and bigger than life – what we are looking for in a European Shooting Star.”\n\t\n\n\tDiára began her artistic journey in theater before transitioning into film. Her breakthrough came with Pedro Pinho’s “I Only Rest in the Storm” (2025), which earned her the Un Certain Regard Best Performance award in Cannes. She also appears in the cult favorite “Diamantino” (2018) and the upcoming series “Lisbon Noir.” The jury highlights her as “fierce and feminine,” and were fascinated by the fact that she is “natural and spontaneous, she has something about her that cannot be learned.”\n\n\t“This is a truly remarkable group of talents, selected by our jury from an exceptionally strong field of nominees,” Tina Hajon, the programme director of European Shooting Stars, said. “They represent some of the most exciting new voices Europe has to offer.”\n\n\tVariety is Shooting Stars’ main media partner.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlauda Ruiz de Azua’s “Sundays” (“Los Domingos”), the winner of the San Sebastián Film Festival’s Golden Shell for best film, has been sold to half the major movie markets in the world by Paris-based Le Pacte. \n\n\tThe first phase roll out for Le Pacte underscores the sales punch of a select number of breakout dramas from exciting talent scoring big prizes at big fests. \n\n\n\t“Los Domingos” scored best film and actress (Patricia López Arnaiz) at Spain’s Forqué Awards this Saturday, making it favourite for the Spanish Academy Goya Awards in February. “Sundays” now ranks in Film Affinity España’s list as one of the best Top 10 Spanish films ever made. \n\t\n\n\tWritten and directed by Ruiz de Azúa, the Movistar Plus+ co-produced “Sundays” marks the second feature from Basque Ruíz de Azúa who has emerged in a spectacular fashion in just five years as a major voice in Spanish film and TV. \n\n\n\tRuiz de Azúa’s first feature “Lullaby” (2022) was hailed by Pedro Almodóvar as “undoubtedly the best debut in Spanish cinema for years.” World premiering last year at San Sebastián, her first series, “Querer,” went on to win this year the top Grand Prix at France’s Series Mania, Europe’s most important TV festival. \n\n\tNow “Sundays” has achieved the Holy Grail of any feature these days sold on the open market: a powerful performance in its home territory, reaching around €4.0 million ($4.7 million) to date in Spain from an Oct. 24 release by Bteam Pictures, and rapid, fulsome sales with the potential for more to come and a theatrical release in multiple key overseas territories .  \n\t\n\n\tIn first announced deals by Le Pacte, “Sundays,” a psychological suspense drama which delivers a penetrating take on failing family dynamics, has closed Germany and Austria (MFA+ FilmDistribution), Italy (Movies Inspired), Nordic states (Angel Films) and Australia and New Zealand (Palace Films). \n\n\tWidely sold across Europe, other deals take in Benelux (Cherry Pickers), Greece (Weird Wave), Poland (Rafael Films), Switzerland (Agora Films), Romania (Independenta), Portugal (Leopardo Filmes) and Croatia (Kino Mediteran).\n\n\tLe Pacte has also secured two deals with HBO for the 1st pay TV/SVOD window in both Latin America and Eastern Europe. In Latin America, the film will also receive a theatrical release ahead of the HBO window through separate deals with Cine Video y TV for Mexico and Babilla Cine for Colombia.\n\n\tAs already announced, Le Pacte is directly handling French distribution. It has set a wide theatrical release in France for Feb. 11, 2026. Additional territories are currently in discussions, Le Pacte confirmed Monday.\n\n\t‘Sundays’: the Film\n\n\tAlso written by Ruiz de Azúa, “Sundays” turns on Ainara, 17, a student at a religious school in a city in northern Spain who begins the films by begging aunt Maite to persuade father Iñaki to let her go on a retreat organized by the local Betinas convent nuns, an enclosed order. \n\n\tMaite, a flamboyant modern woman, and Iñaki, owner of a failing restaurant business, learn from Ainara’s spiritual director at school, a dashing young priest, that Ainara will learn from God – with whom she already talks sometimes, she says – what He wants of her.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBlanca Soroa, playing Ainara, and the cloistered oreder she may join in ‘Sundays.’ Credit: David Herranz.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOne question in the film is whether Ainara has been deeply wounded by the death of her mother, who was deeply religious, and the distance of her father, driving her to seek the warmth of another mother, Prioress Mother Isabel, and another father, the Father. \n\n\t“Not all girls who goes to a religious high school or a retreat end up becoming nuns. So though the religious world can push her in that direction, you have the sensation’s there’s more driving her,” Ruiz de Azúa has observed to Variety.\n\n\tAbove all, however, “Sundays” emerges as a study of failing family dynamics, plagued by intolerance, where key family members never achieve a sense of empathy with Ainara, viewing her vocation through a lens of self interest (father Iñaki) or egocentrism (aunt Pilar). Only Ainara’s grandmother and Maite’s husband step back from themselves and recognize that Ainara’s worldview may not coincide with their own, and her desires conflict with theirs, without trying to impose their will on her.\n\t\n\n\tLed by newcomer Blanca Soroa in an acclaimed performance as Ainara which makes her a frontrunner for recognition in Spain’s awards season, “Sundays” also stars López Arnaiz (“Glimmers,” “20,000 Species of Bees”), Miguel Garcés (“20,000 Species of Bees”), Juan Minujín (“The Two Popes,” “Focus”) and Mabel Rivera (“The Sea Inside,” “Goya’s Ghosts”).\n\n\t“Sundays ” displays fast emerging Ruiz de Azúa hallmarks, seen in “Lullaby” and “Querer”: the mix of suspense drama and psychological and social observance grounded in a knowingly depicted Basque reality; the contrast of two mindsets – though far more ambivalent here in “Sundays” – and performances by some of Spain, and now the Spanish-speaking world’s, most respected actors; and studied cinematographic direction.\n\n\tRegarding the last, Ruíz de Azua observed at a press conference at September’s San Sebastián Festival, where the film stood head and shoulders above rivals in an El Diario Vasco Spanish critics’ poll, that “colors repeat in Ainara’s family home and the Betinas Convent. There are very few shots of the sky. I wanted the two worlds, which could appear very different, to belong to the same world.”\n\n\tProduction Details\n\n\tFirst announced at Cannes in 2023, “Sundays” merges two Spanish production models. It forms part of a potent first film slate from Movistar Plus+ aimed at making films of large artistic and broader audience ambition at a budget which can compete with similar films from major production centers in Europe. \n\n\tThe strategy has already born early high-profile fruit with Oliver Laxe’s “Sirât,” which scored a Jury Prize at Cannes competition this May and two Golden Globe nominations last week.\n\n\tIn production, Movistar Plus+ teams with a network of production houses spread over Spain, many of which backed “Lullaby” and which are now emerging or have emerged as distinguished producers in their own right: Marisa Fernández Armenteros’ Buenapinta Media (“The Mole Agent”), Manu Calvo at Encanta Films (“Wounded”), Nahikari Ipiña at Sayaka Producciones (“Daniela Forever”) and Sandra Hermida at Colosé Producciones (“Society of the Snow”), Think Studio (“Mirage”) and Los Desencuentros Película.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Sundays’ wins at Spain’s Forqué Awards, Dec. 13, 2025 Courtesy of Zenit Comunicación\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJuan Bezos\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tGöteborg’s 20th edition of its TV Drama Vision confab looks like it could be one of the powerful ever with some of the biggest Nordic and European drama creators from 13 countries set to pitch 15 projects at the Series in Development lineup.\n\n\tHeadlining the slate of eight high-end Nordic shows looking for co-financiers and co-producers is the psycho thriller “A Phone Rings in the Middle of the Night,” created by the team behind the Palme d’Or winner “Triangle of Sadness” and Sundance-Berlin winner “Fantastic Machine.”\n\t\n\n\t”This is the first fiction series for Plattform Produktion, but we’ve always said that we would venture into TV drama if we could find something that could make best use of the episodic narrative format in an organic way,” said Ruben Östlund’s long-time production partner Erik Hemmendorff. who adds: “We feel excited to produce a series in the same way that we produce our feature films.”While the thriller “A Phone Rings…” is based on true events, other Nordic projects will offer thought-provoking takes on our contemporary world.\n\n\n\tIn “Fantasy Resort”, the team behind the multi-awarded Norwegian show “Requiem for Selina” will use a similar universe to question the impact of reality TV on young people; in the drama “Scandinavia,” co-writers Geir Henning Hopland (“Headhunters”), Jörgen Hjerdt (“Blue Eyes,” “Taelgia”) and Anton Breum (“A Sámi Wedding”) examine a future in which NATO no longer exists and Denmark, Norway and Sweden have formed a single nation with a common defence, economy and politics to face fascism in Europe.In the Faroe Islands-set political drama “Tinganes,” creator-producer Torfinnur Jákupsson (“Trom”) focuses on “sovereignty in the age of surveillance” and “what happens when a small nation becomes the frontline of global power,” while Iceland’s Eagle Egilsson, “The Wire” cinematographer and a director of the Starz Original “Hightown.” will dive into the smallest Nordic nation’s financial crash and its aftermath in “Greed.”\n\t\n\n\tAmong the seven high-end European Series in Development, four are presented in collaboration with partner organisations. The Spanish mystery drama “Dark Waters” (Federation Spain) which won the TV Drama Vision Select Award at the recent Tallinn TV Beats Forum, is being showcased by Catalan Films, the Spain-France-Belgium thriller “Smuggled” (Mediacrest, Oble, AT-Prod) with Conecta Fiction & Entertainment, the Belgium period thriller-tragicomedy “Belle Epoque” with Flanders Audiovisual Fund (VAF) and Polish dark comedy “We Are Still Here” with Midpoint Institute.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Dark Waters’ presentation at the Talllinn Film Festival this November (L-R) Cia Edstrom, María Rocher. Credit: Annika Pham\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn a groundbreaking move for TV Drama Vision, the Swedish youth comedy “In My Hands” will mirror the latest global production crave for micro dramas. “This is our very first vertical/micro series to be selected for pitching. We really like the project, and we aim to highlight this content trend, not only through panels but also through concrete projects,” said TV Drama Vision honcho Cia Edström.\n\n\tCommenting on her 2026 Series in Development covering a “wide spectrum genre-wise, ranging from historical romance and youth comedy to political drama,” Edström said “the submissions we received show that there are many strong creators and producers in Europe today, but also that due to the challenging times in the drama industry, there is a need for more time and support in the development phase.”More than 800 delegates from 30 countries are expected at this year’s TV Drama Vision, due to unspool under the headline “One Transformation After Another,” with 50 series and 100 on-stage speakers including heavyweight U.S. producer-screenwriter James Schamus and Germany showrunner Katharina Eyssen (“The Empress”), as reported earlier.\n\n\tThe Göteborg Film Festival’s parallel boutique industry event dedicated to drama series will unspool Jan. 28-29 and its film-focused Nordic Film Market over Jan. 28-30.\n\n\tFull Rundown on TV Drama Vision’s Series in DevelopmentNordic Series in Development\n\n\t“A Phone Rings in the Middle of the Night,” (“En Telefon Ringer Mitt i Natten”, 4X58’, Sweden)Written and directed by Mikel Cee Karlsson\n\t\n\n\tProduced by Erik Hemmendorff, Axel Danielson, Maximilien Van Aertryck for Plattform Produktion and SVTThe psycho thriller is based on true events that unfolded in a small Swedish town between 1970 and 2014. “On a summer night in 2010, Mats, a drummer in a local dance band, is jolted awake by a phone call. On the other end: silence. Moments later, his phone lights up with a text: “You fat, disgusting pig.” This marks the beginning of two years of relentless terror directed at Mats and his family, unraveling a dark story that began over 40 years earlier,” runs the logline.  The show “redefines the revenge story in an interesting and complex way,” says Ruben Östlund long-time producer  Hemmendorff, who adds: “It’s about a man who late in life makes the decision to get back on his childhood bullies so that he finally can move on and hopefully live a normal life. It’s about how the past still haunt the present and the thin line between victim and perpetrator.” \n\n\t“Dangerous Woman,” (6×42’, Finland)Written by Kevin Rundle \n\n\tProduced by Kristina Rytkölä for Gutsy PicturesThe latest project from value-driven Gutsy Pictures founded by Marika Makaroff, behind the “Moominvalley” series, is penned by BAFTA-nominated Kevin Rundle (“Hollyoaks,” “EastEnders”), co-writer of the outfit’s Canneseries-selected “L/Over.” The story centers on a middle-aged woman, at the peak of her career, who violently attacks a male visitor at a fair. When she is arrested, bigger secrets begin to surface, as it appears that the woman had committed several crimes in the past.\n\n\t“Fantasy Resort,” (5×45’, Norway),Written by Emmeline Berglund and Benjamin BerglundProduced by Ingunn Rensel for ANTISet in the same universe as the acclaimed “Requiem for Selina,” a Series Mania Panorama Student Award winner, the show will again tackle the media industry’s exploitation of young people’s need to be seen and loved but from the perspective of a TV reality show, not an influencer. “Requiem for Selina” helmer Sebastian Kåss is attached.\n\n\t“Greed,” (“Græðgi,” 6 x 55’, Iceland)\n\n\tWritten by Kristinn Thordarson and Michael KalesnikoProducedby Kristinn Thordarson, Leifur B.

    "description": "\n\tPathé, the revered French studio behind “The Three Musketeers” and “The Count of Monte Cristo,” has revealed a teaser for “De Gaulle,” Antonin Baudr",
    "body": "\n\tPathé, the revered French studio behind “The Three Musketeers” and “The Count of Monte Cristo,” has revealed a teaser for “De Gaulle,” Antonin Baudry’s sweeping two-part historical thriller saga charting the French Resistance during WWII through the eyes of General Charles de Gaulle. \n\n\n\n\n\tSlated as a major theatrical event for summer 2026, the two films – titled “De Gaulle: Tilting Iron” and “De Gaulle: The Sovereign Edge” — will be released in France just weeks apart, with “Tilting Iron” set to open on June 10, followed by “The Sovereign Edge” on July 3. \n\t\n\n\tNow in post, the saga will have a global scope, with an international cast and locations. It filmed in France, Morocco and the U.K., unfolding between London and Paris, Casablanca and Dakar, among other cities. \n\n\n\tLed by Simon Abkarian in the towering role of General Charles de Gaulle, the ensemble period saga stars Benoît Magimel as Pierre Koenig, Mathieu Kassovitz as Francois Darlan, Niels Schneider as General Leclerc, and Simon Russell Beale portraying Winston Churchill and Campbell Scott stepping into the role of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\n\tFlorian Lesieur and Anamaria Vartolomei, the César-winning star of Audrey Diwan’s “Happening” and Bong Joon-ho’s “Mickey 17,” embody the young faces of the Resistance. The cast is completed by Karim Leklou, Félix Kysyl, Thierry Lhermitte, Grégoire Colin, Kacey Mottet Klein, Tom Mison, Pip Torrens, Stephen Campbell Moore and Daniel Betts.\n\n\tThe saga is based on the book “De Gaulle: A Certain Idea of France” by Julian Jackson, one of the key reference works on de Gaulle and Free France; and explores de Gaulle’s complex  relationship with  Churchill, portrayed by Simon Russell Beale. Baudry penned the screenplay, adaptation and dialogue alongside Bérénice Vila. The movies reteam Pathé and Baudry, following “The Wolf’s Call,” a bold submarine film that struck a chord in 2019. \n\t\n\n\t“De Gaulle” is an in-house production for Pathé on the heels of its French blockbuster “The Count of Monte Cristo,” an epic adventure film adapted from Alexandre Dumas’ classic which world premiered at Cannes in 2024 and struck box office gold in France where it sold nearly 10 million admissions. Jérôme Seydoux, the powerful chairman of Pathé who also runs France’s leading cinema chain, is producing the “De Gaulle” saga, with Pathé Films president Ardavan Safaee and Axelle Boucaï.\n\n\tThe story is set in June 1940, when France was defeated by German forces and signed the armistice. “De Gaulle, an isolated, largely unknown general refuses to accept surrender. Without an army, without political backing and seemingly without hope, de Gaulle flees to London, driven by what the film describes as an “irrational conviction:” that France, his France, has not laid down arms. Against all odds, he seeks to convince the world — and his own countrymen — that the battle for France is neither over nor lost,” the synopsis reads. The films will depict how resistance fighters, rebellious students and determined soldiers rose up in England, France and Africa to join the cause. \n\n\tBaudry drew on his own background within the French diplomatic corps to depict the political labyrinth of Free France with authenticity, focusing on the power struggles, moral dilemmas and human fault lines that shaped modern Europe.\n\n\t“I often wondered what kind of person it took to refuse to surrender in 1940 — to disobey their own government while devoting their life to France,” Baudry said. “Few people can do this. I became fascinated by them, so much so that I wanted to make not one film, but two.”\n\n\tSafaee, meanwhile, described “De Gaulle” as a “resonant and deeply contemporary story of resistance and commitment.”\n\n\t“Directed by Antonin Baudry, the two films intertwine the momentum of a gripping geopolitical thrillerwith the emotional depth of a shared human journey,” Safaee said, adding that “Baudry’s films will immerse audiences in the decisive hours when women and men of the Resistance, alongside a leader faced with impossible choices, came together to help shape the course of history.”\n\n\tSafaee noted the “powerful films pay tribute to their courage, solidarity, and moral resolve, capturingthe human stakes behind history in the making.” \n\t\n\n\tBesides production, Pathé is handling theatrical and video distribution, as well as international sales, with co-producers including TF1 Films Production, Logical Content Ventures, Belvédère, Ness Films and Beside Productions, alongside Canal+, Disney+ and TF1. \n\n\t“De Gaulle” is one of several prestige epics on Pathé’s slate. The company is also developing “Dumas: Black Devil” directed by Ladj Ly, about the lesser-known story of Thomas Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie Dumas, who was born a Caribbean slave in 1762 and beat the odds by rising through the ranks to become a revolutionary French general. \n\n\tBelow is a poster for “De Gaulle.” It features a Cross of Lorraine, which “became a powerful emblem of the Free French Forces, symbolizing resistance, unity, courage, and an unbreakable spirit of freedom — a deliberate counter to the Nazi swastika,” Pathé said. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tIt’s a sad day in Hollywood — an unthinkable, upsetting and all-around shocking day — when filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife Michele could have been",
    "body": "\n\tIt’s a sad day in Hollywood — an unthinkable, upsetting and all-around shocking day — when filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife Michele could have been stabbed to death in their own home, allegedly by someone so close.\n\n\tThe particulars are hazy, the initial reports nearly impossible to wrap one’s head around. It’s clear that in the days ahead, the scandal will likely overshadow the career of one of the industry’s most beloved directors, a man widely admired for his work, his activism and his contagiously optimistic spirit. In the “100 Best Comedy Movies of All Time” list recently published by Variety, Reiner was responsible for no fewer than three of the entries.\n\t\n\n\tI’m not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that among American studio talents, I consider Rob Reiner the best director never to have been nominated for best director. Just look at his credits. The guy was the Billy Wilder of our generation: a filmmaker with an instinct for comedy who could operate across genres, making films with brash, larger-than-life characters you recognized instantly and felt you’d known your whole life.\n\n\n\tReiner wasn’t a stylist like Martin Scorsese — the filmmaking idol on whom “This Is Spinal Tap” “director” Marty DiBergi was based (and for whom he finally got to act in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” playing Leonardo DiCaprio’s dad). He wasn’t a visionary technological innovator like Robert Zemeckis — the performance-capture pioneer who took “The Polar Express,” a project Reiner had initiated with Tom Hanks, and made motion-picture history with it.\n\t\n\n\tBut he made at least six hall-of-fame films, practically one after another over the course of an 11-year run (a number forever associated with him). Reiner kicked off his directorial career with the endlessly quotable, mock rock doc “This Is Spinal Tap,” hitting new comedic heights straight out of the gate in 1984 by poking fun at an absurd (yet plausible) heavy metal band. Two years later, he delivered that greatest of coming-of-age films, “Stand by Me” — a movie featuring kids who really act like kids, facing the notion of mortality for the first time.\n\n\tThen came what I’ve long considered to be my desert-island movie — as in, the one film I’d save if I was banished somewhere with a projector, a screen and a single print I’m certain I’d never get tired of watching: “The Princess Bride.” More on that in a minute. I was exactly the right age when that head-in-the-clouds, heart-on-the-sleeve postmodern fairy tale was released, but grown-ups at the time went crazy for his down-to-earth follow-up, “When Harry Met Sally…,” which almost singlehandedly revived the romantic comedy genre.\n\n\tRight there, you’ve got four movies that defined the ’80s, and we haven’t even gotten to his two most acclaimed credits: “A Few Good Men,” the decade’s most-quoted (and surely also its most-rewatched) courtroom drama, in which Jack Nicholson bellows, “You can’t handle the truth!” at Tom Cruise’s self-righteous military lawyer. Reiner reteamed with screenwriter Aaron Sorkin three years later on “The American President,” another irresistible Hollywood romance, this one with a backbone idealistic enough to inspire “The West Wing.”\n\n\tI know I’m not alone in adoring all six of those movies, though it’s telling that none are the type where one spends much time thinking about the man calling “action!” Sorkin’s fingerprints are all over the latter two. “This Is Spinal Tap” is commonly associated with Christopher Guest, who went on to make several more improv-driven mockumentaries in the same mold. Nora Ephron often gets credit for “When Harry Met Sally…,” though the script was informed by where both she and Reiner were in their respective romantic lives at the time.\n\n\tIf Reiner gets too little credit, it’s because he had the wisdom and grace to subtract himself from the equation — by which I mean, when watching a Rob Reiner movie, audiences were never thinking about the director: how this shot was brilliant or that cut was clever. He wanted our attention to be focused on the characters, taking great care to cast each and every role with the absolute right actor, then trusting those performers to bring more than the script dictated to their parts.\n\t\n\n\tThere must be a case somewhere in Reiner’s filmography of someone being wrong for the role, but I can’t think of an example (then again, I never saw “North”). Instead, my mind goes to a dozen uncannily inspired choices in “The Princess Bride”: From Andre the Giant to Mandy Patinkin to Wallace Shawn, those actors fit their characters like a six-fingered glove (in Guest’s case, at least). Plucked from TV, “Santa Barbara” star Robin Wright was both radiant and duly indignant in the title role, while English actor Cary Elwes was no less swoon-tastic as the lowly farmboy who braves exile, poison and even death to satisfy true love. \n\n\tThe script was William Goldman’s, but striking the balance between sincerity and irreverence — plus the all-important comic timing — should be treated as Reiner’s contribution. With “The Princess Bride,” the director accomplished the tricky task of blending several classic Hollywood genres: fairy tale romance, fantasy adventure, swashbuckling action and kid-friendly comedy. At first, the studio wasn’t sure what to make of it. As with “This Is Spinal Tap,” it took time for audiences to embrace the film. Rest assured, those two cult favorites eventually found their following, to the extent that Reiner broke one of his own rules and finally made a sequel (“Spinal Tap II: The End Continues”) this year.\n\n\tYou can’t look at a Rob Reiner movie and reverse-engineer the man’s genius the way you can a film by Spielberg or Kubrick (though I’d argue “Stand by Me” is a better Stephen King adaptation than “The Shining”). The way I see it, there are three subtle but vital qualities that made Reiner’s movies so appealing.\n\n\tFirst, there’s the way he worked with actors, inviting them to improvise. That was the basis of “Spinal Tap”’s success, and proved to be an asset throughout his career.\n\n\tSecond, as the son of Carl Reiner — and star of the incredibly successful ’70s sitcom “All in the Family” — Rob had either inherited or absorbed the principles of comedy, incorporating humor into all his films (it’s my opinion that all Hollywood movies are comedies, to some degree at least, and that this tendency toward levity is what sets American cinema apart).\n\n\tAnd third, he worked carefully on the scripts with his writers. Some projects he originated, via his Castle Rock shingle, and others he refined over rigorous brainstorming sessions. Sorkin has often credited Reiner’s process with making “A Few Good Men” into the rock-solid film it is. These days, too few studio directors polish their scripts to the same degree, worrying not just about dialogue, but structure, stakes and what makes a character feel real.\n\t\n\n\tIt makes sense that Reiner would be strong on those fronts. He met Mel Brooks when he was just four years old. Little Rob grew up at the feet of showbiz legends (his father, Carl, wrote for Sid Caesar’s “Your Show of Shows”), and he paid his dues, studying theater at UCLA, observing and learning from Norman Lear and directing TV movies before crossing over to film.\n\n\tReiner’s career stagnated somewhat in the 21st century, though he made a very funny, disarmingly intimate portrait of best friend Albert Brooks (no relation to Mel) for HBO two years ago, “Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.” And of course, there was this year’s “Spinal Tap” sequel, which features more than a few sidesplitting moments — and a few epic cameos from the likes of Paul McCartney and Elton John.\n\n\tCan a filmmaker be both beloved and underappreciated at the same time? Rob Reiner was. Thinking of what happened to the 78-year-old mensch and his wife this weekend, one word comes to mind: inconceivable.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAcross Hollywood and beyond, celebrities and fans are paying tribute to director and actor Rob Reiner, who was found dead along with his wife Michele on Sunday in their home. \n\n\tThe son of writer Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner first became known for his role as Meathead in the influential sitcom “All in the Family.” He went on to direct classic films including “Stand by Me,” “This Is Spinal Tap,” “When Harry Met Sally…” and “A Few Good Men.”\n\t\n\n\tChristopher Guest, who starred in “This Is Spinal Tap,” and his wife Jamie Lee Curtis said in a statement, “Christopher and I are numb and sad and shocked about the violent, tragic deaths of our dear friends Rob and Michelle Singer Reiner and our ONLY focus and care right now is for their children and immediate families and we will offer all support possible to help them. There will be plenty of time later to discuss the creative lives we shared and the great political and social impact they both had on the entertainment industry, early childhood development, the fight for gay marriage and their global care for a world in crisis. We have lost great friends. Please give us time to grieve.”\n\n\n\tThe late Norman Lear’s family wrote in a statement, “The Lear Family is devastated by the deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner. Norman often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary, to us and the world. Norman would have wanted to remind us that Rob and Michele spent every breath trying to make this country a better place, and they pursued that through their art, their activism, their philanthropy, and their love for family and friends.  Lyn Lear had remained very close with them and said, ‘The world is unmistakably darker tonight, and we are left bereft.'”\n\t\n\n\tReiner’s “Princess Bride” star Cary Elwes posted a photo on Instagram of their chairs from set with the caption: “No words…”\n\n\n\tJohn Cusack, who starring in Reiner’s film “The Sure Thing,” wrote on Twitter “Shocked by the death of Rob Reiner – a great man.”\n\n\tBarack Obama wrote, “Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired.”\n\nMichelle and I are heartbroken by the tragic passing of Rob Reiner and his beloved wife, Michele. Rob’s achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen. But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of…— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) December 15, 2025\n\n\n\tGovernor Gavin Newsom and his wife Jennifer Seibel Newsom said in a statement, “That empathy extended well beyond his films. Rob was a passionate advocate for children and for civil rights — from taking on Big Tobacco to fighting for marriage equality to serving as a powerful voice in early education. He made California a better place through his good works.”\n\n\tDirector Paul Feig wrote, “Rob was my true hero.”\n\nOne of my most cherished pictures. Rob was my true hero. A true visionary titan and a lovely lovely person. One never knows if it’s proper to post during something as tragic as this. But I just want the world to know what so many of us know in the industry. Rob was the best. 💔 pic.twitter.com/oDn1FW1vqb— Paul Feig (@paulfeig) December 15, 2025\n\n\n\tSean Astin, president of SAG-AFTRA, saluted Reiner as a union member and pillar of the creative community for more than a half century.\n\n\t“Rob Reiner is one of the most significant figures in the history of film and television. The impact he made on American culture simply can’t be overstated. Tributes will pour in and the impossibly long list of genre defining films and indelible performances will play in our minds and hearts. Rob Reiner was a member of our union for nearly 60 years,” Astin said in a statement. “We send love and warmth to Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner’s families, friends and colleagues. Our entertainment community and audiences around the world will mourn deeply. On a personal note, so many of Mr. Reiner’s films and performances made me think, made me emotional and especially they made me laugh really hard. That’s how I will remember him.”\n\n\tReiner was a beloved figure in comedy circles, given his proud lineage and his indelible contributions to the form via such influential smashes as 1984’s “This Is Spinal Tap” and 1989’s “When Harry Met Sally.” Reiner was the son of Carl Reiner, who worked alongside Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks in the 1950s and ’60s and went on to create “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and many other comedy projects. Rob Reiner proved his chops as an actor with the success of “All in the Family,” which captured America’s generation gap as the turbulent late 1960s gave way to the Me decade.\n\t\n\n\t“Rob Reiner consistently worked from a place of conviction and integrity. Together, he and Michele were a force — combining comedy, creativity, and public engagement into their shared endeavors. They were as committed to making a difference as they were to their careers, a rare combination that makes this loss feel all the more profound,” said Journey Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center in Jamestown, N.Y.  “When visiting us to pay tribute to his father, Rob did so with reverence, humility, kindness and a steadfast, enthusiastic intellect in matters of comedy and humanity. We are grateful to have known them both and for the impact they had on all of us.”\n\n\tReiner’s hot streak as a helmer from the mid-1980s through mid-1990s is hard to top for movies that defined their eras. Fellow actors, writers and directors were quick to cite his films as seminal influences.\n\n\tPaul Walter Hauser wrote, “Grieving the loss of my favorite director of all-time. A Few Good Men is THE reason I became an actor, and Rob’s filmography behind the camera is THE reason I wanted to direct and still do.” The actor went on to share a story about the time he met Reiner.\n\n\n\t“Horrible. I didn’t think today could get worse,” wrote Jon Cryer on Threads.\n\n\tJosh Gad wrote “Rob Reiner and his wife Michelle were two of the most kind and caring souls you could ever imagine. He cared so much for those who had no voices.”\n\n\n\tMonty Python member Eric Idle wrote on X that he had just spoken to Reiner the night of his death for “over an hour.”\n\n\t“He was telling me about filming at Stonehenge and his thoughts for the future,” Idle continued. “This is so awful. I shall miss him. A clever, talented and very thoughtful man.”\n\nRob Reiner was a lovely man.  I spoke to him last night for over an hour.  I always enjoyed his company.  I met him at his Dad's in 1975.  He was telling me about fiming at Stonehenge and his thoughts for the future.  This is so awful.  I shall miss him.

Life and talent always turned up to 11.”\n\n\n\tFilmmaker Joe Russo wrote, “We lost one of the few good men.”\n\n\n\tNancy Pelosi said, “Rob was creative, funny, and beloved. And in all of their endeavors, Michelle was his indispensable partner, intellectual resource, and a loving wife.”\n\t\n\nThe news of a deadly assault on Rob and Michelle Reiner in their home is devastating.

    "body": "\n\tPaul Thomas Anderson’s”One Battle After Another” appears to be the film to beat at the 46th annual London Critics’ Circle Film Award.\n\n\tEchoing its haul from the recent Golden Globes nominations, the political satire-meets-thriller has nine nominations overall from the U.K.’s leading film writers and broadcasters, closely followed by Chloé Zhao’s Shakespearean tragedy “Hamnet,” with eight. Both films landed nods for film of the year and director of the year, with their leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jessie Buckley, also nominated for actor of the year and actress of the Year, respectively.\n\t\n\n\tElsewhere, Ryan Coogler’s deep-South horror “Sinners” was nominated in seven categories, also including film of the year. Other films with multiple nods included “Marty Supreme,” with six nominations, “Sorry, Baby” with five (four of which were for first-time writer-director-star Eva Victor), and Oliver Laxe’s “Sirāt,” Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” and Kelly Reichardt’s “The Mastermind” with four each.\n\n\n\t“At a time when A.I. and homogeny seems to be the shorthand answer to everything, it’s encouraging to see the films that our members voted for are teeming with human life, creativity and unique perspectives,” said Jane Crowther, London Critics’ Circle film section chair. “Boasting bold, vital stories, real experiences and artistry, these movies and their creative teams are evidence that not everything can be made by an algorithm. The LFCC is delighted to be inviting such a diverse group of artists to our awards in February to celebrate their achievements.”\n\t\n\n\tThe London Critics’ Circle Film Awards ceremony will be head 1 Feb. at The May Fair in London, with renowned critic Mark Kermode as host. \n\n\tSee the full list of nominees below: \n\n\tFILM OF THE YEAR “Hamnet”“Marty Supreme”“The Mastermind”“One Battle After Another” “Sentimental Value”“Sinners”“Sirāt”“Sorry, Baby” “Train Dreams” “Weapons”\n\n\tFOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM OF THE YEAR“It Was Just an Accident”“No Other Choice”“The Secret Agent”“Sentimental Value”“Sirāt”\n\n\tDOCUMENTARY OF THE YEAR“Cover-Up”“One to One: John & Yoko” “Orwell: 2+2=5”“The Perfect Neighbor” “Riefenstahl”\n\n\tANIMATED FEATURE OF THE YEAR“Arco”“Elio”“KPop Demon Hunters”“Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” “Zootopia 2”\n\n\tBRITISH/IRISH FILM OF THE YEAR“The Ballad of Wallis Island” “Bugonia”“Hamnet”“I Swear”“Pillion”\n\n\tDIRECTOR OF THE YEARPaul Thomas Anderson – “One Battle After Another” Ryan Coogler – “Sinners”Óliver Laxe – “Sirāt”Josh Safdie – “Marty Supreme”Chloé Zhao – “Hamnet”\n\n\tSCREENWRITER OF THE YEAR Paul Thomas Anderson – “One Battle After Another” Ryan Coogler – “Sinners”Josh Safdie & Ronald Bronstein – “Marty Supreme” Eva Victor – “Sorry, Baby”Chloé Zhao & Maggie O’Farrell – “Hamnet”\n\n\tACTOR OF THE YEAR Timothée Chalamet – “Marty Supreme” Leonardo DiCaprio – “One Battle After Another” Ethan Hawke – “Blue Moon”Wagner Moura – “The Secret Agent“Josh O’Connor – “The Mastermind”\n\n\tACTRESS OF THE YEARJessie Buckley – “Hamnet”Rose Byrne – “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” Jennifer Lawrence – “Die My Love” Renate Reinsve – “Sentimental Value” Eva Victor – “Sorry, Baby”\n\n\tSUPPORTING ACTOR OF THE YEAR Benicio del Toro – “One Battle After Another” Jacob Elordi – “Frankenstein”Delroy Lindo – “Sinners”Sean Penn – “One Battle After Another” Alexander Skarsgård – “Pillion”\n\n\tSUPPORTING ACTRESS OF THE YEAROdessa A’zion – “Marty Supreme”Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas – “Sentimental Value” Amy Madigan – “Weapons”Wunmi Mosaku – “Sinners”Teyana Taylor – “One Battle After Another”\n\n\tBREAKTHROUGH PERFORMER OF THE YEARRobert Aramayo – “I Swear/Palestine 36 “Miles Caton – “Sinners”Frank Dillane – “Urchin/Harvest”Chase Infiniti – “One Battle After Another” Eva Victor – “Sorry, Baby”\n\n\tBREAKTHROUGH BRITISH/IRISH FILMMAKER OF THE YEARTom Basden & Tim Key – “The Ballad of Wallis Island” Laura Carreira – “On Falling”Akinola Davies Jr. – “My Father’s Shadow”Harris Dickinson – “Urchin”Harry Lighton – “Pillion”\n\t\n\n\tBRITISH/IRISH PERFORMER OF THE YEAR Naomi Ackie – “Sorry, Baby”/”Mickey 17″/”The Thursday Murder Club” Robert Aramayo – “I Swear”/”Palestine 36”Jessie Buckley – “Hamnet”David Jonsson – “Wasteman”/”The Long Walk”Josh O’Connor – “The Mastermind/”The History of Sound”/”Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery”\n\n\tYOUNG BRITISH/IRISH PERFORMER OF THE YEARScott Ellis Watson – “I Swear”Ebada Hassan – “Brides”Jacobi Jupe – “Hamnet”Noah Jupe – “Hamnet”/”The Carpenter’s Son” Alfie Williams – “28 Years Later”\n\n\tTECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENT AWARD“Die My Love” – Editing, Toni Froschhamer“The Ice Tower” – Production Design, Julia Irribarria“Marty Supreme” – Casting, Jennifer Venditti“The Mastermind” – Music, Rob Mazurek“One Battle After Another” – Editing, Andy Jurgensen“Sinners” – Music, Ludwig Göransson“Sirāt” – Sound design, Laia Casanovas“Sound of Falling” – Costume Design, Sabrina Krämer“Train Dreams” – Cinematography, Adolpho Veloso“Weapons” – Makeup and Hairstyling, Leo Satkovich, Melizah Wheat and Jason Collins\n\n\tBRITISH/IRISH SHORT FILM OF THE YEAR“Two Black Boys In Paradise” – Directed by Baz Sells“Leaving Ikordoru in 1999” – Directed by Rashida Seriki“I Saw The Face Of God In The Jet Wash” – Directed by Mark Jenkin “Neil Armstrong and the Langholmites” – Directed by Duncan Cowles “Milk” – Directed by Naomi Waring\n",

    "body": "\n\tRob Reiner, who segued from starring in  “All in the Family” to directing movies including “This Is Spinal Tap,” “A Few Good Men” and “When Harry Met Sally…” was found dead Sunday afternoon in his Brentwood home alongside his wife Michele Singer. He was 78. \n\n\tThe deaths are being investigated as a homicide, according to the LAPD. The couple was reported to have been stabbed to death.\n\n\n\t“It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time,” his family said in a statement. \n\t\n\n\tReiner’s most recent film was “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,” the sequel to the 1984 classic “This Is Spinal Tap.” \n\n\tThe son of the noted writer, director and comedian Carl Reiner, he first attracted attention as Michael “Meathead” Stivic, hippie son-in-law of Carroll O’Connor’s bigoted, blustering blue-collar worker Archie Bunker, during nine seasons of CBS’s topical sitcom. He collected Emmys as best supporting actor in a comedy in 1974 and 1978.\n\n\tWith credits as a writer on “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,” “Happy Days” and “All in the Family” and a pair of TV movies under his belt, Reiner moved into big screen work as a director, writer and co-star in 1984’s “This is Spinal Tap,” the cherished, improvisational mockumentary about a thick-headed heavy metal band.\n\n\tThat project was succeeded during the next decade by a run of box office hits and popular favorites, which demonstrated his uncommon assurance working in a variety of genres. These included “Stand By Me” (1986), a coming-of-age drama with a youthful cast, adapted from a Stephen King short story; the fantasy “The Princess Bride” (1987); the new-look romantic comedy “When Harry Met Sally…” (1989); another King adaptation, the thriller “Misery” (1990); and the Tom Cruise-Jack Nicholson court martial drama “A Few Good Men” (1992).\n\t\n\n\tReiner served as producer of most of his films from 1987 on. That year, he co-founded the production company Castle Rock Entertainment, which released several of his films and such hits as “In the Line of Fire,” “Needful Things” and “Malice.” The company was acquired by Turner Broadcasting in 1993.\n\n\tSave for the occasional hit like the bittersweet 2007 comedy-drama “The Bucket List” with Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, Reiner’s latter-day directorial projects – which included “Being Charlie,” a family drama, rooted in autobiography — though eclectic as ever, seldom met with commercial favor.\n\n\t“I’m making the movies I want to make,” he told the Guardian in 2008. “Studios are looking for hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in profit and you’re not going to get it with a little movie…But I came into this business to express myself and tell stories, not just churn out a product.”\n\n\tA prominent progressive voice in the Hollywood community, Reiner was active in several California ballot initiatives. He was an ardent supporter of Democratic candidates and a vocal opponent of President Donald Trump. In 2006, after contemplating a run against California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, he decided to step away from the race.\n\n\tHe was born March 6, 1947, in the New York borough of the Bronx. His father became one of the most prominent comedy writers and stars of the so-called “Golden Age of Television,” acting and writing on Sid Caesar’s top-rated “Your Show of Shows”; he went on to create “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and direct a number of successful comedy features.\n\n\tThe apple did not fall far from the tree. Raised in Hollywood, the younger Reiner attended UCLA Film School and began taking small roles in such TV shows as “Batman,” “That Girl,” “The Beverly Hillbillies” and “The Partridge Family.” He also appeared in his father’s autobiographical feature “Enter Laughing” (1967).\n\n\tIn 1971, Reiner was chosen, over such actors as Richard Dreyfuss and Harrison Ford, to play Archie Bunker’s put-upon son-in-law, opposite Sally Struthers as his wife Gloria, “All in the Family,” creator Norman Lear’s Americanized version of the British sitcom “‘Til Death Do Us Part.” The show’s frank exploration of topical material previously considered too hot for TV and the great chemistry of the cast (which also included Jean Stapleton as Bunker’s wife Edith) made it a pivotal series in small-screen history.\n\t\n\n\tIt took a few years for Reiner to find his footing after parting company with “All in the Family” in 1978, but with his first major feature in 1984 he created an iconic musical comedy. Built on a roughly sketched treatment and essentially improvised in front of the camera, “This is Spinal Tap” introduced Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer as the dim-witted members of the titular band, with Reiner portraying earnest doc director Marty DiBergi.\n\n\tBetween 1986 and 1992, Reiner proved his versatility in a succession of films featuring strong performances. His work with the adolescent cast of “Stand By Me” earned him Golden Globe, Independent Spirit and DGA Award nominations. The offbeat “The Princess Bride” acquired a devoted cult following.\n\n\tHis most assured directorial performance may have been “When Harry Met Sally…,” which perfectly paired Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as close friends who end up entering a romantic relationship. Written by Nora Ephron, the hit comedy featured an indelible sequence in which Ryan loudly demonstrates a fake orgasm for Crystal in a crowded restaurant; the scene’s unforgettable punchline, “I’ll have what she’s having,” was delivered by the director’s mother Estelle.\n\n\tReiner’s box office track record began to cool in the late ‘90s, as the writer-director increasingly pursued less commercial, more political subject matter, from the ‘60s civil rights movement (“Ghosts of Mississippi,” 1996) to the political career of Lyndon Johnson (“LBJ,” 2016) and the Gulf War of 2003 (“Shock and Awe,” 2017).\n\n\tIn 2023, he directed the documentary “Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.”\n\n\tOne of the most outspoken of Hollywood political activists, Reiner eschewed office seeking in favor of work for his preferred causes, which encompassed gay rights advocacy and a protracted battle with the tobacco lobby.\n\n\t“No, I don’t want to be an elected official,” he said. “I want to get things done.”\n\n\tReiner and his wife are survived by children, Jake, Nick and Romy. He was the adoptive father of actress Tracy Reiner, the daughter of his first wife, the late actress and director Penny Marshall.\n",

Reiner then went on to direct such beloved 1980s and ’90s films as “This Is Spinal Tap” (1984)  “Stand By Me” (1986), “The Princess Bride” (1987) and “When Harry Met Sally” (1989) and dramas “Misery” (1990) and “A Few Good Men” (1992).\nThe seasoned Hollywood insider was active in state and national politics.

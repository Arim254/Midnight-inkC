    "body": "\n\tAdded time for script delays, differing ideas of days off and additional cost of crew. Producers of “Blood & Sweat”, an upcoming eight-episode crime series produced by Japan’s AX-ON and Finland‘s ICS Nordic, offered a candid look at real-world challenges facing international co-productions, at a TIFFCOM seminar.\n\n\tTIFFCOM is the market arm of the Tokyo International Film Festival.\n\n\n\tThe series, starring Anne Watanabe (“Cube,” “Stay Mum”) and Jasper Pääkkönen (“BlacKkKlansman,” “Vikings”), follows two detectives from opposing cultures, jointly investigating a series of murders.\n\t\n\n\tThe nine-month script development process required intensive back-and-forth between writers and producers. According to AX-ON producer Daniel Toivonen, episode screenplays were first written in English, translated into Japanese, and then had to undergo further reviews to make sure the dialogue was culturally specific and appropriate.\n\n\n\t“Initially the script is written in English, and we had that translated, but directly translated word for word, and then we had the actors speak those lines, to see if there was any discomfort and we rewrote from there, which took time,” said Toivonen.\n\n\tDifferent working culture and styles also posed problems during filming. According to Toivonen, Finnish crews operate under strict union rules with a priority on work-life balance, in sharp contrast to Japanese filming practices. The cost of labor in Finland is also higher than in Japan.\n\n\t“We were very strict about time management. In Japan, going over by a couple of minutes is fine, but in Finland, the camera shuts off on time time, sharp,” said Toivonen.\n\t\n\n\tUnder Finnish laws, the filming schedule was capped to a maximum of four 12-hour days per week. In practice, this meant shooting Monday through Thursday, followed by a prep day on Friday.\n\n\t“Four days a week in Japan does not work, so we would maybe work six days out of the week, or have a longer work day,” explained Toivonen. “And also with Finnish crew and a Finnish director [shooting in Japan], we needed more staff members who could speak English, and so that meant more budget.”\n\n\tCreative decisions are also more devolved in Finnish production culture as compared to their Japanese counterparts. According to Toivonen, Finnish directors tend to devolve greater decision making to department heads than Japanese directors. When asked about costume ideas, for example, a Finnish director working on the series reportedly responded, “This is Wardrobe’s job, and so I want to respect her thoughts.”\n\n\tSeparately, the seminar also introduced Local Content Bank (LCB), an initiative to help centralize and streamline Japanese content for the global market.\n\n\tLed by regional broadcaster Miyazaki Telecasting Company, the online platform allows Japan’s multitude of small and regional television stations to upload their extensive library of programming, which is then broken up and re-categorised (via AI) into individual pieces of content.\n\n\tOther users of the platform can then re-format and aggregate this content for new programming and long-form playlists.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJabali.ai is making a play to open up game development to the masses with the launch of Jabali Studio, a next-gen platform that lets users design, build and pub 2D and 3D games without wrestling with complex code.\n\n\tThe AI game tech company is positioning the platform as a bridge between technical prowess and creative vision. The company raised $5 million in seed funding led by Bitkraft Ventures, with participation from Sapphire Ventures and Sony Innovation Fund. The move comes as Jabali.ai looks to shake up an industry where development has traditionally required heavyweight technical teams and specialized programming knowledge.\n\t\n\n\t“Game creation has long been limited by the complexity of tools and the need for large technical teams,” said Vatsal Bhardwaj, founder and CEO of Jabali.ai. “Jabali Studio changes that by combining AI, creativity, and accessibility in one environment. Whether it’s a simple casual game or a deep 3D world, creators can now focus on their ideas while AI takes care of the heavy lifting.”\n\n\n\tThe platform operates on the principle that “everyone can be a game maker,” offering two creative pathways: Vibe Code for mechanics-minded users and Design Mode for visual storytellers. Jabali Studio plugs into major AI systems including Gemini, Claude, OpenAI and Grok, letting creators work with familiar tools.\n\n\tOn the technical front, the platform supports multiple engines and frameworks, with native templates alongside integration with Godot and Phaser. Unity and Unreal Engine support is slated for future rollout. All projects come with complete source code access, giving creators full ownership and modification rights.\n\t\n\n\tThe studio’s AI toolkit includes self-healing projects that auto-correct broken builds, AI-powered debugging and intelligent publishing capabilities. Users can direct their AI co-pilot through four modes — Autonomous, Collaborative, Cautious or Creative — depending on workflow preferences.\n\n\tJabali.ai’s core platform already allows users to generate games in under 10 minutes via AI-powered prompts, eliminating traditional coding requirements. The company is positioning Jabali Studio as the next evolution in that mission, targeting everyone from seasoned developers to creative newcomers looking to break into interactive entertainment.\n\n\tThe platform is designed to adapt to diverse workflows while maintaining accessibility for first-time creators. By blending AI assistance with creative freedom, Jabali.ai is betting it can attract a new generation of game makers who might have been shut out by traditional development barriers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix‘s Indonesian horror film “The Elixir” has surged to the top of the streamer’s worldwide rankings for non-English language titles, drawing more than 11 million viewers in the first several days following its Oct. 23 debut.\n\n\tDuring the Oct. 20-26 tracking period, director Kimo Stamboel’s zombie thriller secured first place in five markets and appeared among the top 10 most-watched films in 75 territories worldwide, spanning Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Malaysia, Germany, France, South Africa, Turkey, the Dominican Republic, Canada, and Brazil.\n\t\n\n\tThe horror film centers on a family business dealing in jamu, Indonesia‘s traditional herbal remedies, in a village outside Yogyakarta. When the family patriarch’s quest for immortality goes catastrophically wrong, it unleashes both domestic turmoil and a deadly outbreak.\n\n\n\tCritics and audiences have responded positively to the film’s culturally specific interpretation of zombie horror, which incorporates uniquely Indonesian elements and creatures modeled after the country’s native pitcher plant.\n\n\t“I wanted to create a zombie film that truly feels Indonesian — not just through its setting or language, but through its very core story. From Jamu and Javanese villages to family dynamics. Seeing the film embraced by audiences across countries proves that local stories can have a global resonance,” said Stamboel, who wrote the screenplay with Agasyah Karim and Khalid Kashogi. \n\n\tThe cast features Mikha Tambayong, Eva Celia, Donny Damara, Dimas Anggara, Marthino Lio, and Kiki Narendra. Edwin Nazir produced for Mowin Pictures.\n\t\n\n\t“I never expected a story so close to our daily lives — about family, ambition, and loss — to resonate so strongly both at home and abroad. ‘The Elixir’ may feature zombies, but at its heart, it’s about family and humanity. Personally, it’s been such a meaningful experience to bring a story rooted in Indonesian culture to global audiences and see how warmly they’ve responded,” said Celia, who plays Karina.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAcclaimed Thai director Pen-ek Ratanaruang is back at the Tokyo International Film Festival presenting his latest film “Morte Cucina.” But it was his storied collaboration with Japanese actors that took centerstage at a masterclass with “Lost Land” director Fujimoto Akio.\n\n\tThe counterpoint focus of their work, Ratanaruang’s frequent use of Japanese talent and Fujimoto’s focus on Southeast Asian subjects was a central theme of the discussion.\n\t\n\n\tRatanaruang reminisced about working with legendary Japanese filmmaker Miike Takashi on his 2003 film “Last Life in the Universe,” the latter making a cameo as a yakuza boss. Miike took the reins for his own character’s look and support cast.\n\n\n\t“He said he knew who to cast as his henchmen. One was his screenwriter, and the other was an actor that he used all the time. He said he’s going to design all the costumes for all three of them, because he knew how Yakuza really dressed like,” recounted Pen-ek.\n\n\tAccording to Ratanaruang, Miike even insisted on a specific hairstyle, the Punch Pama, a tight cropped perm popular amongst underworld elements in the 1970s.\n\n\t“So he did everything for us. He did casting for us. He designed the costumes and when we had to film in Osaka for a week, he got all the [underworld] permissions for us because they all really admired him,” Ratanaruang said.\n\n\tRatanaruang shared another anecdote from Miike about the finished product.\n\n\t“He’s a really good director but a really terrible actor. He really sticks out. He doesn’t blend in,” said the Thai auteur. “He said that himself, you know, when he saw ‘Last Life In The Universe,’ he said ‘Pen-Ek, you made such a beautiful film… the only thing that was bad in it is me.’”\n\t\n\n\tA key point of overlap in the conversation between Fujimoto and Ratanaruang was how their casting process tended to impact the screenplay.\n\n\t“The most fearful thing, the most frightening thing about filmmaking is when people lose interest after 20 minutes into the film or they fall asleep. You have to fight against losing the audience, against them losing interest,” said Ratanaruang.\n\n\t“So what’s on the screen has to be really interesting. And I think most of the time the actors are on the screen. You cast someone you think the audience can watch for two hours without losing interest. You go for those,” he added.\n\n\t“Someone who maybe doesn’t speak well, who can’t act at all, but just the presence is so great that you have to keep watching. And they may not fit exactly what you wrote in the script. So you change the script to fit them,” he said.\n\n\tIn a similar vein, Japanese director Fujimoto detailed the challenging and delicate process of casting non-professional Rohingya actors for his film “Lost Land,” which focuses on the refugee experience in Myanmar.\n\n\t“Originally in the screenplay, it was about two 14-year-old brothers. But as I was [scouting Rohingya schools] I saw this little boy, four years old at the time, and I felt like this boy is so good and he might lead the movie,  and I went to his home, and he had an older sister and I thought ‘Wow, the sister is good, too’ So then let’s, let’s rewrite the screenplay,” said Fujimoto.\n\n\tDue to the real-life dangers the refugees face, he declined to reveal specifics about where he found his cast or the filming locations, stating, “I cannot really tell you where I found them, because we can’t let people know where they live.”\n\n\tFujimoto’s main actors, a brother and sister, are Rohingya and face immense challenges to their freedom.\n\n\tThe filmmaker underscored their stateless reality when explaining why they could not travel to attend film festivals: “They don’t, they’re stateless. They don’t have passports, so basically, they can’t go out of wherever they’re living right now.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Tokyo International Film Festival‘s TIFF Lounge series of talks and masterclasses featured a conversation between Yamada Yoji, director of the festival Centerpiece “Tokyo Taxi”, and Lee Sang-il, recipient of this year’s Kurosawa Akira Award for his film “Kokuho.”\n\n\tThe 94-year-old Yamada, whose, lengthy filmography includes the iconic 48-episode “Tora-san” series that ran from 1969 to 1995, and the 51-year-old Lee, whose “Kokuho” has become a record-setting hit since its release in June of this year, earning more than $100 million, expressed admiration for each other’s work. Lee called Yamada a “national treasure” (the English translation of “Kokuho”) while Yamada said that putting his modestly budgeted “Tokyo Taxi” next to Lee’s lavishly staged Kabuki drama “makes me feel embarrassed” and that he was there to “watch and learn.”\n\t\n\n\tNoting that “Kokuho” is the “story of two men” who become performers of female roles or onnagata in Kabuki, Yamada said Lee’s film “is exceptionally good precisely because it’s different from typical films about male friendship” since the focus remains on the two protagonists and their suffering for their art, as well as on their intense rivalry as artists. “Usually in a film like that a woman always gets involved between [the two men] so you have a simple relationship dynamic,” Yamada said. “This movie isn’t like that… I was amazed you managed to express something so complex so well.”\n\n\n\tYamada compared the film to the 1984 Mozart biopic “Amadeus” in which “there was jealousy [between the two protagonists], sabotaging each other and deceiving each other.” In “Kokuho,” he added, “You’d expect that kind of thing to unfold, but, there’s an ‘art’ at the center of the drama. Above all, they dedicate themselves to their art.” He also expressed amazement at how the two leads totally inhabited their female stage roles. “How did they pull it off?” he asked.\n\t\n\n\tLee answered that stars Ryo Yoshizawa and Ryusei Yokohama spent a year and half preparing, learning Kabuki from scratch. “Honestly, for the first few months, I’d occasionally go observe them, and it would give me a headache,” Lee said. “I’d wonder if they’d ever get it… But that rehearsal process, where they pushed each other to improve, directly shaped the relationship between their characters.”\n\n\tThe two directors also discussed veteran dancer and actor Tanaka Min, who appears as an elderly Kabuki onnagata in “Kokuho” and as a sword-wielding opponent to the samurai hero in Yamada’s 2002 Oscar-nominated hit “The Twilight Samurai.”\n\n\t“He had a good face and a good voice,” Yamada said. “But his acting… He was just terrible, really terrible. We rehearsed everything, every single thing. And it just didn’t work. So we had to drill in [the dialogue], word by word.”\n\n\tNoting that Tanaka became an in-demand actor after the film’s success, Yamada said, to audience laughter “I watch him sometimes, and he hasn’t improved at all. ”\n\n\tLee countered that Tanaka had a dancerly presence that fit the role: “It’s enough just for him to be there, you know? That presence and the way his body moves. He has this unique way of moving his body, and when that combines with his voice, it creates this magical presence.”\n\n\tThe conversation turned to “Tokyo Taxi,” Yamada’s remake of the 2022 French-Belgian drama “Driving Madeleine.” Frequent Yamada collaborator Baisho Chieko plays an elderly woman who asks her taxi driver (former pop star Kimura Takuya) to drive her to memorable places in her Tokyo life before arriving at the Yokohama retirement home where she intends to spend her remaining days.\n\n\tYamada commented that Kimura, who had starred in his 2006 samurai drama “Love and Honor,” was just as serious as a taxi driver stirring natto (fermented soy beans) into his breakfast rice, as he had been as a samurai in the earlier film. “He’s like, ‘I have to do this properly, seriously. That’s who I am,’” said Yamada. “And even when his own scene is over, he always stays until the end, on the set…Big stars usually show up late or don’t care [about staying to the end], but he never does that.”\n\n\tLee said that when he visited Yamada’s set the director was “always right next to the camera, always watching the actors from the closest spot.” “I tried it myself, kind of half-jokingly” he added. “I realized how much it matters – having the director right there is incredibly important. That lesson has stayed with me ever since.” Younger directors, he noted, tend to watch a monitor positioned some distance from the camera. “I can’t quite accept that,” he said “If I were an actor, I’d hate it.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the Q&A the directors were asked for their thoughts about the enormous global popularity of Japanese animation, as compared to the relatively low international profile of Japanese live-action films.\n\n\tYamada admitted that the profits of Japanese anime are “huge” while those of Japanese films “are practically negligible by comparison.” “That’s incredibly frustrating and sad for us Japanese artists,” he said. “Seventy years ago, when I started going to movie theaters, Japanese films were incredibly vibrant and the cinema scene was rich… We have to do something. It’s not just up to us; the Japanese government must seriously take notice of this too. It’s a national issue. Why is Korean cinema demonstrating such incredible power? Because Korea is genuinely committed to making films, truly responding to cinema. That’s why I hope Japan, as a national policy, will support film. I hope that kind of initiative can emerge from Tokyo.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Captive” offers the intriguing concept of “Don Quixote’s” author viewed through a lens more redolent of “Arabian Nights,” spinning tales to keep himself alive while a hostage of Moors in Algiers. But the known facts about this murky biographical chapter are vague, permitting writer-director Alejandro Amenabar much imaginative license, though he makes less of the storytelling-within-storytelling aspect than you initially expect. What emerges is a curious if entertaining bio-fiction with Miguel de Cervantes as protagonist in a convoluted costume intrigue, like a homoerotic spin on ye olde Western exoticizing of the Arab world– well-toned male bodies in the hammam substituting here for the traditional, scantily-clad Hollywood harem girls. \n\t\n\n\tThose not expecting a more straightforward portrait of the man or his myths — Don Q. is little more than slyly referenced — should find enjoyment in this handsome, leisurely Spain-Italy coproduction. In the end, though, its offbeat approach doesn’t quite pull together enough to make a lasting impression, or even a fully satisfying diversion. Between its two TIFFs (a world premiere at Toronto’s film fest, then this week’s bow in Tokyo), “The Captive” has already opened in some territories and sold to several others, with Netflix claiming streaming rights in Latin America. The home screen may indeed suit it best, as the script’s episodic structure often plays more like a compacted miniseries than an epic feature. \n\n\n\tOpening text informs us that as Christian and Islamic empires fought for control of the Mediterranean in the 16th century, captured ships’ occupants were frequently held for ransom, or sold into slavery. Such is the lot of young Miguel (Julio Pena Hernandez), who had recently suffered wounds in sea battle that rendered his left arm permanently inert. Waylaid by pirates while traveling from Naples to Barcelona, he manages to stay alive here by claiming that he is a “gentleman at arms, very important.” But the truth is that his family lacks the connections or wealth to free him. And the actual noblemen stuck waiting for monetary rescue amidst brutal conditions enforced by Algiers regent Hassan Baja (Alessandro Borghi) scorn Cervantes as a “nobody.” \n\t\n\n\tWell-educated despite his modest background, our hero gradually wins over the bored hostages by telling tales — entertaining them with exaggerated accounts of his own adventures, or inventing new ones. That skill set attracts interest from “the dreaded Bey” himself, eavesdropping from a window in his luxurious quarters above the prison yard. Baja, aka Hassan Veneziano, was himself a multilingual European who managed to turn his initially-forced absorption into the Muslim world into a slow rise to power. He spies a kindred soul in Miguel… but he’s also a tough audience. When Cervantes pleases him, he earns a day of freedom, where he grows intoxicated by the surrounding city’s unfamiliar sights and surprisingly liberal (in some respects) culture. When Bey is displeased, however, the Spaniard is lucky to survive another day.\n\n\tNonetheless, the two gradually achieve a sort of intimacy, one that after a time turns physical and romantic. Even before they cotton to any such liaison, his fellow captives resent Cervantes’ special treatment — particularly the jealous, duplicitous friar Blanco (Fernando Tejero). Contrastingly supportive towards this aspiring “man of letters” is scholarly Father Antonio (Miguel Rellan), from whose extensive library Miguel extracts many of his stories. (There is little indication that the future world-famous author has many ideas of his own, despite occasional suggestive mind’s-eye glimpses of a windmill.) The foreigners, almost without exception, refuse to formally abjure Christianity, though that is one way to gain liberty. And Miguel himself is increasingly torn between loyalties, plotting escape plans even as he and the Bey appear to fall in love.\n\n\tThe petulant, back-stabby intrigue between various parties here sometimes makes the hero rather unsympathetic, with photogenic singer-actor Pena Hernandez’s puppyish turn not conveying a great deal of complexity, let alone artistic o intellectual potential. By contrast, Borghi limns a figure of comingled sensuality, threat and eventual poignance, without ever appearing to reach for effect. His role is really just a variation on the “crafty sheik” stereotype of yore, but he makes it persuasive. The large roster of supporting players is astutely cast.\n\n\tWhat resemblance does all this have to Cervantes’ actual life? Not a lot — or at least little that can be substantiated. Amenabar seems to root his screenplay on conjectures about the writer’s sexuality, which many scholars consider latterday projection. Nothing inherently wrong with that, within “The Captive’s” fiction-friendly context. But despite the production’s accomplished period physical trappings, there’s an air of very 21st-century thinking here — particularly in depictions of gender-blur and adult same-sex love within the Arab world — that feels more like wish-fulfillment than the film is prepared to acknowledge. These elements might’ve felt like less of a stretch if the director’s screenplay permitted more flight into fantasy. But Miguel’s recited stories are rather pedestrian, and do not fully develop into a complementary parallel to the main narrative as in other films about famous authors and their creations. \n\t\n\n\tIn the end, this is both a daring imaginative leap, and not quite enough of one — “The Captive” never quite attains liftoff, despite a lush look and numerous moments of charming or dramatic impact. There’s too much contrivance on a scene-to-scene basis, and an inorganic feel to the general conceit. His own composer as usual, Amenabar here tends to underline the film’s shortcomings, rather than elevate its idiosyncrasies with an original score that’s too conventional by half. Yet “Captive” does feel like a labor of love for its writer-director, its conviction carrying us along on a smooth overall ride, even if the individual ingredients fail to entirely coalesce.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney‘s networks including ESPN and ABC have gone dark on YouTube TV.\n\n\tYouTube TV removed Disney’s networks as much as 30 minutes before the previous carriage deal expired at the stroke of midnight ET, after the two sides remain far apart on a deal renewal to keep ABC, ESPN and more on the internet TV service. The main sticking point is price — Disney is asking for rate hikes that Google isn’t willing to agree to.\n\n\n\tYouTube TV said that if Disney’s channels remain unavailable for “an extended period of time,” it will offer subscribers a one-time $20 credit. YouTube TV’s base subscription plan costs $82.99/month. With the blackout, TV users nationwide will lose their local ABC stations, as well as ESPN sports programming including NFL, college football, NBA and NHL games.\n\t\n\n\tGoogle said YouTube TV would begin pulling Disney-owned networks off its service beginning at 9 p.m. PT on Oct. 30/12 a.m. ET on Oct. 31. However, YouTube TV users on social media said they lost Disney programming even before the deadline. In addition to dropping the live networks, YouTube TV also is removing any DVR library recordings users have made from those networks.\n\n\tDisney began alerting viewers on Oct. 23 about the carriage dispute with YouTube TV, pointing out that its networks could be removed from the pay-TV provider. YouTube TV is the biggest internet-TV service in the U.S., estimated to have more than 10 million subscribers. In second place is Disney, which just closed a deal to merge its Hulu + Live TV business with Fubo; together, those have almost 6 million subs in North America. \n\t\n\n\t“Last week Disney used the threat of a blackout on YouTube TV as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement. “They’re now following through on that threat, suspending their content on YouTube TV. This decision directly harms our subscribers while benefiting their own live TV products, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.”\n\n\tThe YouTube rep continued, “We know this is a frustrating and disappointing outcome for our subscribers and we continue to urge Disney to work with us constructively to reach a fair agreement that restores their networks to YouTube TV. If their content remains off YouTube TV for an extended period of time, we’ll offer subscribers a $20 credit.”\n\n\tIn its negotiations with Disney, Google has proposed new genre-based tiers and packaging flexibility to give YouTube TV customers more choices. Disney claims it’s amenable to the idea; however, the two sides haven’t found common ground on this point either.\n\n\tAccording to Disney, YouTube TV wants a better deal than anyone else in the market — including Comcast and Charter, which have more TV customers — and is unwilling to pay market rates for Disney’s networks or agree to terms that Disney has reached with other distributors, including it own Hulu + Live TV and Fubo services.\n\n\t“Unfortunately, Google’s YouTube TV has chosen to deny their subscribers the content they value most by refusing to pay fair rates for our channels, including ESPN and ABC,” a Disney spokesperson said. “Without a new agreement in place, their subscribers will not have access to our programming, which includes the best lineup in live sports — anchored by the NFL, NBA, and college football, with 13 of the top 25 college teams playing this weekend.” \n\n\tThe Disney rep continued: “With a $3 trillion market cap, Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we’ve successfully negotiated with every other distributor. We know how frustrating this is for YouTube TV subscribers and remain committed to working toward a resolution as quickly as possible.”\n\n\tHere’s the full list of networks being pulled from YouTube TV: ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPNews, Freeform, FX, FXX, FXM, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, SEC Network, Nat Geo, Nat Geo Wild, ABC News Live, ACC Network, Localish; on the Spanish plan, ESPN Deportes, Baby TV Español and Nat Geo Mundo.\n\t\n\n\tDisney is the latest media conglomerate to lock horns with Google over YouTube TV this year. Others that have fought with the company include Paramount Global (now Paramount Skydance), Fox Corp. and NBCUniversal — each of which reached a new deal without a blackout. However, YouTube TV dropped Univision and other TelevisaUnivision-owned networks at the end of September after the two sides could not reach a new agreement.\n\n\tIn 2023, Disney and Charter had a public battle over a renewal, before the two sides resolved their differences to avoid a blackout. In 2024, ESPN and other Disney nets went dark on DirecTV for nearly two weeks before they reached a new deal. Earlier this month, Disney inked a carriage renewal pact with Comcast without any drama.\n\n\tIn December 2021, Disney and Google reached a carriage renewal after a two-day blackout. YouTube TV first launched in April 2017.\n\n\tIn another wrinkle to the current Disney/Google standoff, Justin Connolly, Disney’s former head of distribution, joined YouTube as VP of global head of media this spring. Disney sued YouTube and Connolly, alleging breach of contract and seeking to block his employment at Google, in part citing Connolly’s knowledge of Disney as it pertained to contract renewal talks for YouTube TV. After Disney lost a legal ruling in the case, the parties recently reached a settlement on the matter.\n\n\tPictured top: ABC’s “High Potential” starring Kaitlin Olson and Daniel Sunjata\n",

    "body": "\n\tDirector Pengfei‘s “Take Off,” which world premiered in competition at the Tokyo International Film Festival, represents both a continuation and evolution of the filmmaker’s artistic preoccupations. \n\n\tAdapted from Shuang Xuetao’s novella “The Aeronaut,” the film follows Li Mingqi (Jiang Qiming), an ordinary worker in Northeast China who inherits his late father’s obsession with flight – a dream that will span decades and test the limits of his persistence.\n\t\n\n\tThe story unfolds against the backdrop of China’s dramatic economic transformation from the 1970s to the present. After a homemade flying machine crashes and leaves his brother-in-law disabled, Li Mingqi and his wife (Li Xueqin) attempt to rebuild their lives by opening a dance hall in an abandoned factory museum, using a hot air balloon as a tourist attraction. But when his nephew falls critically ill, Li faces an impossible choice: accept the limitations of his earthbound existence or risk everything for one final flight.\n\n\n\tFor Pengfei, whose previous films “Underground Fragrance” and “The Taste of Rice Flower” explored working-class and marginalized communities, the project represents his first literary adaptation – and a deepening of his thematic concerns. “I think ‘Take Off’ brings together the emotional themes from my previous films, including love and family,” the director explains. “But this film delves into a deeper layer by incorporating the emotional dynamic between individuals and their dreams, which gives the story greater depth.”\n\n\tThe film’s central tension – between the grounded reality of factory workers’ lives and the transcendent pull of flight – required what Pengfei describes as unwavering sincerity. “From the very beginning of the scriptwriting process, we were pursuing authenticity and sincerity in the story, the characters, and the emotions,” he says. “‘Take Off’ has its element of flight – which represents the dream, and it is imbued with a strong sense of romanticism. But what sustains this spirit is the tangible, down-to-earth life on the ground. Without this foundation, the flight element would not hit close to the heart.”\n\t\n\n\tTranslating Shuang Xuetao’s literary world to the screen presented unique challenges. “The characters in Shuang Xuetao’s works are full of humor and wisdom, just like the author himself,” Pengfei notes. “When reading his novels, I often find myself laughing out loud. But the challenge lies in the intensity of his characters and stories – they are like a shot of espresso.”\n\n\tTo understand the emotional source material, Pengfei conducted extensive field research in Northeast China, interviewing retired factory workers. “Though retired, they reflected on their past with undiminished vibrancy and humor,” he recalls. “That inspired me to bring that same sense of warmth and wit into the film.”\n\n\tCasting proved crucial to the film’s emotional authenticity. Pengfei found his lead in Jiang Qiming, known for “Journey to the West” and “The Long Season.” “Jiang Qiming is an outstanding and deeply focused actor, with a certain sense of detachment that perfectly matches how Li Mingqi is described in the novel and the screenplay,” the director says. “Even their names sound alike.”\n\n\tThe moment of recognition came during the first costume fitting. “When he stepped out after his first costume fitting, I immediately thought, ‘He is the person who walked straight out of the novel,'” Pengfei remembers. The cast also includes veteran actor Jiang Wu, whose natural chemistry with Jiang Qiming required minimal direction. “In the scene where he and Jiang Qiming share a meal, I barely needed to direct at all; simply watching them was already a pleasure.”\n\n\tWorking with cinematographer Lv Songye, Pengfei made a significant stylistic departure from his previous work. “In my previous films, I often used static shots, but after discussing with him, we decided to shoot ‘Take Off’ entirely with moving cameras, either handheld or on tracks, keeping the camera as close to the actors as possible to capture their breathing,” he explains.\n\n\tProduction designer Liu Qing, who has collaborated with Chen Kaige and Jiang Wen, brought his own touch to the period details. “He is deeply passionate about that era, and in ‘Take Off,’ he poured all of his own memories into the film,” Pengfei says. “Memory itself is a fusion of lived experience and romantic imagination.”\n\n\tFor the score, Pengfei returned to Japanese composer Suzuki Keiichi for their third collaboration, despite the language barrier – or perhaps because of it. “I actually see that as an advantage,” the director says. “We communicate in the simplest way possible. For this project, I gave him just one key phrase, ‘a romantic dream,’ and he immediately understood.”\n\t\n\n\tPengfei’s background includes work with Taiwanese director Tsai Ming-liang on “Stray Dogs,” an experience that shaped his approach to filmmaking. “Director Tsai Ming-liang has had a profound influence on me, so much that it took me a long time to focus on my own path,” he acknowledges. “What I learned from him, his seriousness toward cinema and his almost obsessive attention to detail, has benefited me for life.”\n\n\tWhen asked about “Forrest Gump” as a reference point, Pengfei identifies persistence as the common thread, though with important distinctions. “Forrest’s is perhaps unwitting, while Li Mingqi’s is fully conscious,” he explains. “In my film, I chose to depict persistence through the act of letting go: the character stops talking about his dream and ceases to dwell on it, but that does not mean the love for it is gone. In the end, when he faces a moment that demands an all-or-nothing effort, he picks up the dream again without hesitation.”\n\n\tUltimately, Pengfei sees “Take Off” as transcending its specific setting to address universal questions about dreams and dignity. “Yes, I think this is a fable-like story, with a touch of fairy tale in it,” he reflects. “What moves me is that a dream does not have to be pursued all the time. Sometimes, when you reach middle age and have been worn down by life, a moment suddenly arises that awakens the dream you once had in your youth. You may have to pay a heavy price for it, but the question is whether you are still willing to take that step and fight for it. My answer is, I am.”\n\n\tLooking ahead, the director plans to continue his collaboration with Shuang Xuetao. “I’ve barely scratched the surface of his world,” he says – a hint that this journey into the lives of Northeast China’s working-class is far from over.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor its painstaking physicality alone, stop-motion is inherently impressive as an animation technique, no matter the scale or budgetary specifics of the project. But when artists, like those behind the ambitiously crafted phantasmagorical musical “I Am Frankelda,” throw caution to wind to build an imposing universe to animate frame by frame, one can’t help but feel in utter awe — warts and all.\n\n\tGothic sets with baroque architecture — that not only catch the eye but prompt one to wonder how they were conceived — serve as the backdrop to the similarly ornate puppets in the first stop-motion feature fully produced in Mexico (Guillermo del Toro’s Oscar-winning “Pinocchio” was only partially made in the director’s home country). Through their studio Cinema Fantasma, brothers Roy and Arturo Ambriz first introduced their morbid heroine in the series “Frankelda’s Book of Spooks” for HBO Max back in 2021. This feature-length film serves as a prequel to that show, diving into the origins of Frankelda’s bond with her sentient book and romantic interest Herneval, when he was still an otherworldly royal.  \n\t\n\n\tAn orphan child dreaming of becoming a writer in 19th century Mexico, the young Francisca Imelda (voiced as a kid by Habana Zoé), crafts frightful stories and characters, including Herneval (Juan Pablo Monterrubio), a prince her age in the Realm of the Spooks, an alternative reality inhabited by all her fictional creations. However, Herneval’s extravagant kingdom, the Topus Terrentus, is at risk of disappearing because people in the real world are no longer afraid of fiction. Human fear, similar to how “Monsters Inc.” operates, is the lifeblood of “the spooks” (which come in two races, one birdlike and one arachnid).\n\t\n\n\tFrontloaded with the extensive mythology and the mechanics of this storytelling realm, “I Am Frankelda” can feel a bit dense narratively, yet its many visual pleasures continually mesmerize. Every space looks lovingly handcrafted, often making us aware of the materials used in their arduous confection. Viewers expecting the pristine aesthetic and movement of the works of outfits like Laika or Aardman might find the animation here less fluid and the production design slightly less polished. But considering the Ambriz siblings undertook such an elaborate story involving supernatural puppets and a fantastical land, presumably for a fraction of the cost, the result is major step forward for the medium, and in particular this technique in Mexico. If “go big or go home” was a movie, this fits the bill.\n\n\tDisillusioned with the rejection she faces in her life, when Francisca Imelda enters the Realm of the Spooks, now 10 years older but still an unpublished author, she reinvents herself as Frankelda (now voiced by Mireya Mendoza). Among the bevy of ostentatiously designed figures, there’s also a pack of antagonists, namely Procustes (Luis Leonardo Suárez), the royal “nightmarer” and a mediocre writer in charge of penning human nightmaresm, as well as the leaders of the kingdom’s seven clans, a bevy of villainous monsters designed to resemble folktale entities. To save his ailing parents and his subjects both from this treasonous bunch and from oblivion, adult Herneval (Arturo Mercado Jr.) needs Frankelda to write scary stories.\n\n\tThat the jealous Procustes aims to take credit for her work, ties in with the overarching themes of “I Am Frankelda,” namely the belief that in writing fiction Frankelda takes the reins of her life and finds the empowerment that external forces denied her for being a woman in the male-dominated field of dream creation. It’s the power of her pen that will save her in the end. As is often the case with bifurcated tales unfolding between two distinct planes of existence, the characters in the Realm of the Spooks, also have their matching counterparts in Frankelda’s reality. Through it all, the specifically colloquial quality of the dialogue and the delivery of the vivacious voice cast preserves the film’s Mexican identity.\n\t\n\n\tOne of two showstopping numbers takes place when Frankelda first crosses over and reconnects with Herneval. The two sail on a ship that appears inspired by alebrijes (vibrant sculptures of imagined creatures) and sing the track “Yo Ya Había Estado Aqúi” (“I Had Already Been Here”), as ghostly hands mimic fog. Invoking “A Whole New World” from Disney’s “Aladdin” with a more pronounced operatic mood, the song’s emotion straddles a yearning for discovery, and a realization that she knows this place well (she materialized it from her imagination after all). For this sequence, the Ambriz brothers transcend stop-motion and add flourishes that remind the viewer of the film’s tactile conception: A pop-up story book depicting the scene and glass figures representing Frankelda and Herneval appear as a sort of visual interlude as they belt.\n\n\tLater, once the palace intrigue is in full swing and Frankelda and Herneval experience an emotional schism, the villains get the spotlight with the tune “El Príncipe de los Sustos” (“The Prince of Spooks”), in which they denounce how they believe Herneval has wronged them. Though it appears in previous scenes, this number features multiple moments created with hand-painted, animated frames for an effect that reminds one of a moving oil painting, similar to how the Oscar-nominated “Loving Vincent” came to life.\n\n\tMexico’s answer to “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” the Ambriz brothers’ beautifully idiosyncratic “I Am Frankelda” was obviously influenced by Del Toro’s darkly whimsical oeuvre; thus, it makes sense that the director of “Frankenstein” has been a supporter and mentor to these younger compatriots in their pursuit of stop-motion greatness. They are well on their way.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe script for Samuel D. Hunter’s “Little Bear Ridge Road” indicates that the play takes place at “a couch in a void.” As the lights come up, we see it — a white leather monstrosity with separate recliners built in — and we see, too, the void. The stage is utterly bare otherwise.\n\n\tThe play takes ample metaphorical advantage of both couch and void. In staging the collision of a reluctant aunt (Laurie Metcalf) and her stymied-by-life nephew (Micah Stock) during the early days of COVID, Hunter’s script situates itself within a historical moment when couch-sitting was all many people had. As for the void? Well, those familiar with Hunter’s past work (which includes “The Whale,” which Hunter later adapted for the screen, and “A Bright New Boise”) will not be surprised that Stock’s Ethan is a man more at home with words than with other people, desperate to break out of the American interior but unsure of how to do so. All he sees around him is inky darkness.\n\t\n\n\tEthan has shown up at his aunt’s doorstep at a loss: His father has died, and Ethan is obliged to sell his home and do the administrative tasks that come with grief. Not that Ethan is grieving, exactly — he and Aunt Sarah seem to agree that nothing of value was lost when Ethan’s dad, a drug addict, passed, but now Sarah and Ethan are the last two of the Fernsby family left. Both remaining Fernsbys have seen better days: Ethan’s attempt to establish himself in Seattle has come to an embarrassing end, while Sarah has consciously retreated further into her corner of Idaho, living a half-hour from the closest grocery store and tethered to the world around her only by a reality TV habit. Ethan is self-conscious, but Sarah is, at least, no homophobe; she’s stunned, in fact, to learn Ethan feared that she might be. “All this time you’ve thought I had an issue with you being gay?” she asks. “That’s the most interesting thing about you.”\n\t\n\n\tAnother actor might play a moment of regret after uttering this, but Metcalf, as directed by Joe Mantello, is all momentum, in conversation and otherwise. She strides around the couch, supporting her lower back with her right hand, as if, in moving it, she might come apart altogether. She, unlike her dissatisfied nephew, doesn’t see herself as having that luxury.\n\n\tIt’s a sharp contrast in personality types, and, perhaps, in generations: Stoicism and angst, sharing the couch together. And Sarah and Ethan’s gradual coming into an understanding of one another, and toward a time when they can speak openly about missed opportunities for connection in the past, makes for moving viewing; I was reminded, in stretches, of Jen Silverman’s “The Roommate,” mounted last year on Broadway and similarly concerned with two unlikely living companions trying to come to terms with one another. But there are elements here that don’t quite gel. Hunter, in writing a protagonist not dissimilar from ones he has written in the past, uses at first a sort of shorthand — Ethan is unhappy because, well, what’s to be happy about? — but as details of Ethan’s life accrue, elements (including and especially his life in Seattle) strain credulity. Ethan is, we are told, dreaming of becoming a writer, and yet his mien never struck this viewer as particularly writerly or reflective: Stock gives a performance that is emphatic to a fault. Every word he utters is capitalized.\n\n\tMetcalf fares better; the play was commissioned for her as a way to return to Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre Company last year, and one imagines Hunter envisioning “a Laurie Metcalf type” as he wrote. (Stock was in that Chicago production, too, for what it’s worth.) Sarah exists on a continuum with all the great Metcalf characters, from the plainspoken aunt (once again!) on “Roseanne” to Lady Bird’s mother to the recent run of women she’s played on Broadway, wounded but trying to conceal the hurt behind a certain bravado. (Nora in “A Doll’s House, Part 2” comes to mind. So does the defeated politician in “Hillary and Clinton.”) \n\n\tMoments of big emotion in “Little Bear Ridge Road” don’t fall flat, exactly, but they don’t play to Hunter’s strengths as a writer; he’s better in small, askew gestures. We learn a piece of information about Sarah offhandedly, while Ethan is talking about his family situation on a date with nice-guy grad student James (John Drea), and the power of that news dawning on the audience outweighs the excoriations Ethan delivers about his upbringing.\n\t\n\n\tThe show is at its best when allowing Ethan and Sarah’s relationship to unfold without forcing the revelations. (Lead producer Scott Rudin, returning to the industry after a four-year hiatus following reports of an alleged pattern of bullying subordinates, can at least be said to have long had an eye for the truly literary, which this show at its best achieves; perhaps, too, a story about trying to make possible past misdeeds right had its appeals.) The pair’s misunderstandings at first, before a torrent of discussion over what Sarah might have done differently to protect her nephew, may be relatively small beer, but I found myself more interested in little nuances of the ways aunt and nephew differed than in cosmic questions of what is owed to a family member. After all, the first informs the second in ways that are intellectually satisfying to dig into; the latter lends itself to grandiosity.\n\n\tOne of the show’s best moments, to wit, comes in a conversation between the two housemates over what they like to watch on TV. Ethan loves antihero dramas in the post-”Sopranos” vein, and I cued myself to roll my eyes at industry satire that would likely be far from subtle. But what happened next was a strange, sad little moment. Sarah declares, “Just because it’s so complicated that you have to watch an episode recap every week doesn’t mean it’s better. Real people aren’t always desperately doing things.”\n\n\tIt starts out like a groaner that could have been said anytime this century. But it ends up as a statement of purpose — and one that, in the show’s louder moments, I wish Hunter had taken more thoroughly to heart. Sarah’s from the same family as Ethan, has seen the same troubles, and lives a life of similar isolation and lack of fulfillment, and yet, what can she do? Hand at her back, she just keeps moving along. She struggles to express love, but — in one of the many small moments of poignancy studded through “Little Bear Ridge Road,” and distinguishes it as a meaningful achievement — she refuses to make a display of herself. She can’t quite say she loves her nephew, but she can do the next best thing.

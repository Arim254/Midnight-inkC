    "body": "\n\tSeven years after its launch, Taiwan-based Each Other Films is stepping into an expanded phase of international production, with co-founder and head producer Jacqueline W. Liu and co-founder and CEO Tiffany Yu-Chia Chen unveiling a diverse lineup that stretches from documentary to big-budget action.\n\n\tThe quartet of projects represents a widening scope for the Taipei company, which has steadily built credentials through festival selections, streaming deals and local box office success since 2017.\n\t\n\n\tAmong the newly revealed titles is a documentary about drag performer Pangina Heals, a figure who bridges Taiwanese and Thai cultures. The film, titled “Heals,” represents the company’s initial move into factual storytelling through international partnership, working alongside Thailand’s N8 and World of Wonder.\n\n\n\tFiction projects include Henry Tsai’s first directorial effort, “Spent Bullets,” adapted from short stories by Taiwan writer Terao Tetsuya. Production will span multiple cities including Silicon Valley, Las Vegas and Taipei. The film has secured spots at both Golden Horse Film Project Promotion and Taiwan Creative Content Fest 2025.\n\n\tThe company is also returning to a proven property with a fresh chapter in its hit “The Accidental Influencer” franchise. Centered on the character Red, “The Accidental Influencer: Love Me If You Dare” will launch next January on both GTV and Netflix, bringing back the series with additional cast members and storylines focused on contemporary relationships.\n\n\tPerhaps the most ambitious entry is “The Odd Three: Madam Tiger,” which director Joseph Chen-Chieh Hsu (whose credits include “Little Big Women” and Tokyo-bowing “Double Happiness”) is developing as a large-scale adventure that reinterprets traditional folklore through a modern lens. The project is being positioned as a potential launching point for additional character-driven stories across the region.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve always believed that a story rooted in a specific place, language, or authentic human connections can still move people everywhere,” said Liu. “That’s the power of cinema — it turns the personal into the universal. As we enter this next phase, I’m excited to expand what that means, especially across genre, scale, and collaboration.”\n\n\t“Building a production company means knowing where you want to go, and choosing the right stories and people to take you there,” added Chen. “We’ve spent the past seven years building trust — with creators, with partners, and with each other. Now, we’re ready to scale. The future of Asian storytelling is global, and we’re here to be part of that shift.”\n\n\tThe company’s previous work includes the 2020 theatrical release “Little Big Women,” which topped the Taiwan box office that year and earned recognition at the Golden Horse Awards before landing on Netflix. More recently, “The Accidental Influencer” became an HBO Asia original in 2024, while “Dreams in Nightmares” played Berlin’s Panorama section this year. “Penguin Girl” opened last year’s Kaohsiung Film Festival.\n\n\tOperating under a mission statement emphasizing female perspectives and universal connection, Each Other Films continues developing its pipeline while pursuing additional partnerships across borders.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRevered Indian actor Naseeruddin Shah (“Monsoon Wedding”) has joined the Oscar-qualifying documentary “Far From Home” as executive producer, marking his first foray into the documentary space in this capacity.\n\n\tThe short doc, currently campaigning for best documentary short at the Academy Awards, chronicles the plight of Afghan refugees in India through the story of Samira Faizi, who fled to the country in 2021 following the Taliban‘s takeover of Afghanistan.\n\t\n\n\t“The film showcases her struggle in setting up base in India, whose political environment has changed and is no longer welcome for refugees. The film sheds light on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), that excludes Muslim refugees from a pathway towards citizenship and its impact on Afghan refugees, who have no country to go back to,” according to the film’s synopsis. \n\n\n\t“I’ve always believed the most important function of cinema is to act as a record of its times,” Shah said. “Since it is the only medium that can do that I consider documentaries to be of more value for posterity than features.”\n\n\t“Refugee rights is a tricky topic in India and given the current political scenario, refugees are scared to talk or come forth in public,” said Kumar, a former journalist. “I am proud of Samira for her bravery in telling her story and bringing awareness across the world about the situation of Afghan refugees in India.”\n\n\t“When one thinks of refugees, they usually visualize them on a boat going to Europe or on the US-Mexico border. But rarely do we talk about refugees who are in parts of the world where there is no framework to integrate them,” she added.\n\t\n\n\tEmmy-winning producer Brent E. Huffman produces the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting-funded project, which was a Japan Prize finalist and runner-up for best short documentary at the Chicago South Asian Film Festival.\n\n\t“Far From Home” has made the rounds at multiple festivals, including the Oscar-qualifying American Documentary and Animation Film Festival and Tasveer Film Festival. The doc’s awards campaign includes several upcoming screenings across the U.S. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe five participants for the second cohort of the Film Frontier Global Networking Program, who will receive 18 months of tailored support to advance their international careers, have been unveiled.\n\n\tDirectors Kaneko Yurina, Kusano Natsuka, Takahashi Sota and Fujimoto Akio, along with producer Yoshihara Hiroyuki, were revealed at an announcement event held during the 38th Tokyo International Film Festival.\n\n\n\tThe Creator Development Program operates under the Japan Creator Support Fund, established in 2023 within the Japan Arts Council through a subsidy from the Agency for Cultural Affairs. The initiative aims to nurture creative professionals capable of working globally by providing guidance for international development, supporting participation in overseas film festivals and facilitating networking with international industry partners.\n\t\n\n\tThe Global Networking Program is one of three Film Frontier initiatives, alongside the Feature Anime Creators in Progress and the Residency Program.\n\n\tAt the announcement event, directors Nakanishi Mai (first cohort) and Yamashita Tsubomi (Residency Program) reported on their current activities. This was followed by a panel discussion featuring selection committee member director Ishikawa Kei, TIFF programming director Ichiyama Shozo and guest Christian Jeune, deputy delegate and director of the film department at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\t“Once again, the applicants were of an extremely high standard, and the selection process was truly challenging,” Ichiyama said. “We chose projects that we believe are highly feasible, and I hope the participants will start working on them as soon as next year.”\n\t\n\n\tIshikawa offered words of encouragement: “As a director, I focused not on feasibility but purely on the excellence of the proposals. All of the selected projects are highly original and can only be created by these participants. I believe they will even become my competitors for my next work.”\n\n\tThe selected filmmakers expressed their gratitude and enthusiasm. Kaneko noted the value of support throughout the entire filmmaking process, particularly fundraising. Takahashi revealed he has wanted to make a film in Serbia for 12 years, calling the selection “a significant step forward.” Fujimoto expressed pleasure at receiving support while his film “Lost Land” screens at TIFF. Yoshihara said he was grateful his project was chosen despite being difficult to center. Kusano, via video message, emphasized her happiness at dedicating time to research for her next project.\n\n\tSince October, the program has expanded to include training in English-language pitching and development initiatives aimed at participating in international markets.\n\n\tKaneko made her commercial feature debut in 2023 with “People Who Talk to Plushies Are Kind,” which was selected for the Asian New Talent section at the 25th Shanghai International Film Festival. Kusano’s second feature “The Kingdom (or About That House)” (2018) screened at International Film Festival Rotterdam and was selected by the BFI as one of the best films of the year.\n\n\tTakahashi’s graduation film “Memory Devices” won the Audience Award at PFF Award 2023. He directed “Addressee Unknown” in 2025 as part of NDJC: New Directions in Japanese Cinema. Fujimoto’s latest film “Lost Land,” about Rohingya refugees, won the special jury prize in the Horizons section at the 82nd Venice Film Festival and will be released across Japan in spring 2026.\n\n\tYoshihara is currently producing international co-productions including the Japan-Korea feature “3mm Love” and the Japan-Taiwan-Poland co-production “Good Death.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump had kind words for Skydance’s takeover of Paramount and Bari Weiss’ appointment at CBS News during his first sit-down interview with “60 Minutes” in five years.\n\n\tCBS News on Sunday released a transcript of the full 90-minute session with Norah O’Donnell, CBS News’ senior correspondent and a contributor to “60 Minutes.” The conversation touched on a host of topics, from international politics to ICE raids in the U.S. to the economy and healthcare police to the federal government shutdown. The interview was recorded Oct. 31 at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla. Highlights from the interview aired Sunday on “60 Minutes.” \n\t\n\n\tThe session also marks the first time Trump has returned to CBS News for an interview since the network’s parent company reached at $16 million settlement in a lawsuit that Trump filed against the venerable news magazine. CBS’ previous owner, Paramount Communications, wrote the check under pressure as it sought to close the $8 billion Skydance Media transaction. Trump’s baseless claims that “60 Minutes” doctored then-candidate Kamala Harris’ responses in a manner that damaged Trump would have been easily beaten on the legal merits in court, legal experts agree, but the previous Paramount ownership regime buckled under extraordinary pressure brought by President Trump and FCC chairman Brendan Carr. \n\n\n\t” ’60 Minutes’ paid me a lotta money. And you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you, and I’m sure you’re not– you have a great– I think you have a great, new leader, frankly, who’s the young woman that’s leading your whole enterprise is a great– from what I know,” Trump said, referring to the appointment last month of Weiss as editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n\t\n\n\t“I don’t know her, but I hear she’s a great person. But ’60 Minutes’ was forced to pay me– a lot of money because they took her answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can’t have fake news. You’ve gotta have legit news. And I think that it’s happening. I see …I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press,” Trump said.\n\n\tO’Donnell also questioned Trump about the conflicts of his role as Commander in Chief and his family investments and marketing of Trump-branded crypto currencies.\n\n\t“I wanna make crypto great for America. That’s the only thing. I don’t wanna have somebody else have crypto and have China be number one in the world in crypto,” Trump said. “Because in crypto it’s a kind of an industry where basically you’re going to have number one and you’re not gonna have a number two. And right now we’re number one by a long shot. I wanna keep it that way. The same way we’re number one with AI, we’re number one with crypto. And I wanna keep it that way.” \n\n\tAsked point-blank about the Trump family crypto activity, Trump was dismissive. “I can’t say, because– I can’t say– I’m not concerned. I don’t– I’d rather not have you ask the question. But I let you ask it. You just came to me and you said, “Can I ask another question?” And I said, yeah. This is the question–.”\n\n\tMuch of the interview was devoted to O’Donnell’s questions about the president’s views on geopolitical hot spots and challenges the U.S. faces in dealing with Russia, China, Israel, Venezuela and other unpredictable situations.\n\n\tWhen it came to discussing economic issues at home, Trump brought his usual bravado and side-stepped O’Donnell’s efforts to press him on any specifics.\n\n\t“We’re doing very well. By the way, the stock market just hit — perfect timing for your show, just hit an all-time high. It’s hit an all-time high 48 times during the course of my — nine-month period. But just yesterday, the stock market hit an all-time high. We’re doing really well, and everybody knows it,” Trump said.\n\t\n\n\tHe blamed his White House predecessors Joe Biden and Barack Obama for myriad problems including the continuing high price of groceries.\n\n\t“It was a dead country, and now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. We have the strongest stock market, we have everybody wants to come in. A year ago we were a dead country. Right now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. Think of that. And I did that in nine months. And it’s only gonna get better,” Trump said.\n\n\tO’Donnell pressed Trump on the issue of Justice Department’s recent indictments of Trump’s political foes, including New York state Attorney General Leticia James and former FBI chief James Comey.\n\n\t“I think I’ve been very mild-mannered. You’re looking at a man who was indicted many times, and I had to beat the rap,” Trump told O’Donnell.\n\n\tOn the subject of the brutal ICE raids in Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities that have shocked the nation, including some prominent Trump supporters, the president was unbowed.\n\n\t“I think they haven’t gone far enough because we’ve been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges that were put in by Biden and by Obama,” Trump said. O’Donnell asked explicitly if he approved of violent actions taken by heavily masked law enforcement officials in workplaces, schools and courthouses. Trump left no question of where he stands. “Because you have to get the people out,” he said.\n\n\tOn the state of the government shutdown, now heading into its 33rd day, Trump said Republicans “keep voting” despite the fact that House Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the House in recess for most of the shutdown to date.\n\n\t“What we’re doing is we keep voting. I mean, the Republicans are voting almost unanimously to end it, and the Democrats keep voting against ending it. You know, they’ve never had this. This has happened like 18 times before,” Trump said. “The Democrats always voted for an extension, always saying, ‘Give us an extension, we’ll work it out.’ They’ve lost their way. They’ve become crazed lunatics. And all they have to do, Norah, is say, ‘Let’s vote.’ “\n\n\tOn the subject of the ceasefire in Gaza that Trump helped bring about last month, he disputed O’Donnell’s suggestion that the situation is “fragile.” He threatened to use force against Hamas terrorists if need be.\n\t\n\n\t“Hamas could be taken out immediately if they don’t behave. They know that. If they don’t behave, they’re going to be taken out immediately,” Trump said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatthew Lillard surprised fans during Cinespia’s “Scream” Halloween party screening on Friday night, and while talking to the crowd, he shared an emboldened message to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\t“Fuck ICE,” Lillard said. “In this time, in this city, we need to lead with love. Do not forget that shit in this moment. Not to be political, but to be political as shit.”\n\n\tHe also encouraged fans to vote for Prop 50, which allows California to redraw its congressional districts to combat redistricting in Texas.\n\t\n\n\t“Yes to 50. You have to vote. If you don’t vote, we are going down. So it’s on us. And if you don’t like that, I’m so not sorry,” he added.\n\n\tLillard stars in “Scream” as Stu Macher, who makes up the two-man killing team in Wes Craven’s 1996 horror masterpiece along with Skeet Ulrich’s Billy Loomis. Lillard is set to return for “Scream 7” alongside fellow original cast members Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox.\n\n\tEver since Donald Trump took office, ICE has remained top of mind for many in the U.S., and Hollywood is no exception. In early October, Jeff Bridges appeared as his iconic “Big Lebowski” character, The Dude, on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” to proclaim, “Let’s get ICE off our streets and into our beverages, man.”\n\n\tLate-night satires like “South Park” and “Saturday Night Live” have also taken plenty of jabs at ICE. For example, the cold open on the Oct. 8 episode of “SNL” featured host Amy Poehler and Tina Fey as United States Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, respectively. During the sketch, Fey’s noem gave some context on how they hire people for ICE: “How did I find them? By running ads like this: Do you need a job now? Yeah. Are you a big, tough guy? Yeah. Tough enough for the army or police? No. Do you take supplements that you bought at a gas station? Daily. Do you like to use zip ties because people in your life don’t trust you with keys? You know it. Suck on some of these, big boy. Welcome to ICE.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFans will be seeing more of Ariana Grande on the big screen next year. \n\n\tGrande took to Instagram on Friday to announce that she has wrapped filming on the upcoming fourth installment in the “Meet the Parents” franchise, titled “Focker In-Law.”\n\n\t“These past few months have been so, so unimaginably special,” she wrote in the caption. “I love my Fockers, and I love my Byrnes… so, so very much. I will miss this bunch terribly. See you next November!” \n\t\n\n\tGrande’s Instagram post also featured a carousel of behind-the-scenes photos from set, including her hugging Ben Stiller, who returns as Greg Focker, alongside another photo of her locking arms with Beanie Feldstein.\n\n\n\n\tThe fourth edition of the long-running 2000 comedy film series is set to hit theaters on Nov. 25, 2026. \n\n\tStiller, Robert De Niro, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson are returning for “Focker In-Law” with Skyler Gisondo also joining the cast. \n\n\tJohn Hamburg, who wrote the first three films, directed and wrote the screenplay for the new installment.\n\n\tWhile the plot details remain under wraps, Stiller teased the fourquel during a 25th anniversary screening of “Meet the Parents” at this year’s Tribeca Festival.\n\n\t“What spurred the idea is that I’m the age that Bob was when we did the first movie,” Stiller said. “It felt like a mirror to the first film, where one of my kids is thinking about introducing his person to the family.”\n\n\tThe first film, which centered on Greg Fockner (Ben Stiller) enduring many awkward encounters while trying to impress his girlfriend’s parents before proposing, became a blockbuster hit, grossing $330 million worldwide.\n\t\n\n\tIts success led to the 2004 comedy spawning into two more successful sequels: 2004’s “Meet the Fockers” (which introduced Greg’s parents, Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman) and 2010’s “Little Fockers.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBefore Chloe Zhao and Kore-eda Hirokazu sat down for their Tokyo International Film Festival conversation, they had each been crying over the other’s work.\n\n\tKore-eda watched Zhao’s “Hamnet” in a small screening room with just one other person, grateful no one else was there to see his tears. “I couldn’t stop crying,” the Japanese auteur admitted, moved by the film’s exploration of why creators tell stories and the communal act of experiencing tragedy together.\n\t\n\n\tThat morning of their conversation, Zhao had risen at 4 a.m., jet-lagged, to watch Kore-eda’s 1998 masterpiece “After Life.” She was crying for an hour while her makeup team worked on her before the event. “I said to Kore-eda-san, I feel like ‘Hamnet’ and ‘After Life’ are very much the same film,” Zhao told the TIFF Lounge audience. “Because it is about how when we see our lives, whether it’s joyful or painful, mirrored back to us, it gives these experiences meaning and makes the human experience a little less difficult.”\n\n\n\tThe mutual admiration set the tone for an intimate conversation between two auteurs who share more than they might have expected. The discussion took place as Zhao’s latest feature prepared to close the festival, while Kore-eda is currently in production on his new film “Sheep In The Box,” starring Ayase Haruka and comedian Daigo.\n\n\tThe emotional connection revealed a striking similarity in how both directors approach their work: neither knows how their films will end when they begin shooting.\n\n\t“When I go in to make a film, I never know how it’s going to end,” Zhao explained. “I will write it on the page so it reads nice, so it gets greenlit and gets money to make a film. But I know deep inside – and often my lead actors know – that it’s not there.”\n\t\n\n\tThis creative philosophy nearly proved disastrous on “Hamnet.” Four days before production wrapped, only two people at the Globe Theatre knew there was no working ending to the film: Zhao and her lead actress, Jessie Buckley.\n\n\t“I filmed the ending that was on the script,” Zhao recalled. “I looked at it and said, ‘This doesn’t work. We don’t have a film.'” She remembered Buckley’s reaction: “Jessie’s looking at me like, ‘This is it? I went through all of this and this is the ending?'”\n\n\tThe breakthrough came the following morning during a car ride through rainy London. Buckley sent Zhao Max Richter’s “On the Nature of Daylight” – the haunting track that appeared in “Arrival” and other films. “That song has a very special ability to harmonize your whole body to the world around you,” Zhao said. “You suddenly feel like one with everything.”\n\n\tWhile listening to the song, Zhao found herself reaching for the rain outside the car window. “I wanted to reach nature so that I can no longer be afraid of losing my love, because if we’re all one, then you can’t lose love. It just transforms into something else.” In that moment of personal grief and creative desperation, the film’s true ending revealed itself.\n\n\t“I always wait for the ending to show up, which is very stressful because you’re always this little bit from not having a film,” Zhao admitted. “But that’s how life is.”\n\n\tKore-eda expressed understanding, revealing his own unconventional process. He creates storyboards but abandons them once on set. “I’m always looking about two weeks ahead,” he said through translation. “I look at the schedule to see which actors will be on set, and I think about what I can do. I actually write and rewrite the script on set in that space. The staff are probably nervous, but what emerges this way rarely feels wrong.”\n\n\tZhao drew a distinction between her latest work and her previous films. “‘Hamnet’ is about the internal landscape, as opposed to ‘Nomadland,’ which is about the external landscape,” she explained.\n\n\tWorking with cinematographer Lukasz Żal for the first time, Zhao shifted from the wide-open horizons of her earlier American films to something more contained. “In my previous films, I was in my 30s and very much about chasing as many horizons as possible. So it wass about going wide. With ‘Hamnet,’ I was interested in how can we confine everything into one frame, one stage, one room, so that the water can go deeper.”\n\t\n\n\tThis theatrical approach led Zhao to ask Kore-eda about his own precisely composed frames, which often recall stage backdrops. The Japanese director explained that he exchanges few words with his cinematographer on set, preferring to explore each other’s intentions through the camera itself. “It’s very enjoyable,” he said. “If I just followed the storyboard, it would just be about consuming a tight schedule.”\n\n\tWhen asked why she works in fiction rather than documentary, Zhao offered a surprising answer about courage – or her lack of it. “I think when you’re making a documentary, you’re saying, ‘This is me and this is the subject,'” she explained, citing Werner Herzog’s “Into the Abyss” as an example of fearless documentary filmmaking. “I haven’t found that courage in my 30s to do that work.”\n\n\tBut there was another reason, rooted in representation and dignity. Zhao spoke about marginalized communities in America – people on reservations or living in vans – who are often documented with rough digital cameras under unflattering lights, studied as social issues rather than human beings.\n\n\t“If you are with them in their lifestyle, you are exposed to the most beautiful landscape of America,” Zhao said. “And cinema’s cinematic treatments, these painterly images, are usually – because of circumstances of history – preserved for certain demographic people.”\n\n\tWorking with her cinematographer, Zhao insisted on capturing these faces with the same cinematic treatment as any Hollywood star, shooting at the golden hour. “The quality of lighting makes us feel like we’re one with light. And that kind of sunset and sunrise, these people who aren’t in big cities, or have the privilege many of us do, are actually experiencing on a daily basis.”\n\n\t“Sometimes poetry can capture truth better than facts can,” Zhao concluded. “It is an emotional truth, not just fact.”\n\n\tZhao found unexpected freedom in her outsider status. “I only saw two and a half westerns when I made my own westerns,” she laughed. “I didn’t have the burdens on my shoulders as Americans do about making a Western. And when I made this Shakespeare, I don’t know Shakespeare very well, so I don’t have the burden as a British person. Everything about Shakespeare is so sacred. I just do whatever I want.”\n\t\n\n\tThis cavalier approach masks an earlier struggle. When Zhao first came to America for school, her insecurity about language was so profound that she gave up on storytelling and studied politics instead. “I didn’t think I could tell stories. How can I do it if I don’t speak a language?”\n\n\tBut her favorite films had lots of silence. “There’s a language of how your face moves and how your body moves,” she realized. “And if you don’t speak the language, you actually develop an extra sensitivity to nonverbal interactions.” What was once a challenge became an advantage.\n\n\tBefore the conversation, Zhao had watched Kore-eda’s 1998 masterpiece “After Life” – a film about newly deceased people who must choose one memory to take into eternity while workers in a way station create film recreations of those memories.\n\n\t“I was crying for an hour,” Zhao confessed, explaining how the film resonated with her work on “Hamnet,” which deals with how Shakespeare and his wife processed the death of their son. “When we see our lives, whether it’s joyful or painful, mirrored back to us, it gives these experiences meaning and makes the human experience a little less difficult.”\n\n\tShe identified with the characters in “After Life” who choose not to select a memory, instead staying in limbo to help others. “My favorite memories in my life are actually while making belief, while making fantasies that are not real, for other people’s memories,” Zhao said. “When you see ‘Hamnet,’ you’ll see that Shakespeare is also a man who has a lot of trouble connecting and communicating in real life. But when he’s on his stage, he can connect with everything. So there’s a bittersweetness to many of us who chose to be storytellers.”\n\n\tKore-eda, who made “After Life” in his 20s, acknowledged this tension still exists for him in his 60s. “I want to keep making work without becoming cynical about that feeling,” he said.\n\n\tZhao praised Kore-eda’s films for their focus on mundane details – laundry, cooking, daily routines – that create a meditative rhythm before emotional tsunamis arrive. “A lot of times cinema skips past the 80% in between, showing only the highs and the super lows,” Zhao observed. “But you invite us into the comfort of these daily rituals. And through that, it goes and it pushes us off. It’s like some kind of ritual and the piece comes in a loop. And then when it hits you, it’s in the body.”\n\t\n\n\tKore-eda modestly accepted the compliment, saying he hopes to build stories from small emotional fluctuations in daily life, though he’s unsure how well he succeeds.\n\n\tThe conversation also touched on practical matters. Kore-eda shoots for roughly two months and tries to finish before dinner when children are on set, adhering to improved labor rules in Japanese production. He also edits at night during production, sometimes sending footage to his team for feedback the next day – a practice that elicits nervous anticipation from his crew.\n\n\tZhao, by contrast, needs eight hours of sleep and doesn’t touch the edit during production. “I’m so easily influenced by everyone around me,” she explained. “If I edit something early on and it hasn’t quite worked, it might change how I want to do things.” “Hamnet” shot from late July through September.\n\n\tWhen asked about the tension between communal theatrical experiences and streaming platforms, both directors acknowledged the paradox. Kore-eda said he still can’t separate the act of watching a film with someone in the dark from what cinema means to him. “That’s why we need film festivals – so that experience doesn’t cease to exist.”\n\n\tZhao agreed about the importance of communal viewing – it’s central to “Hamnet’s” themes – but also celebrated how technology has democratized access. “Because of iPhones and technology, ‘Songs My Brothers Taught Me’ could be watched by a teenager in South Dakota on the Lakota reservation. I think that is an incredible thing.”\n\n\tLooking ahead, Zhao said she believes stories choose filmmakers, not the other way around. “When the conduit, the lightning conductor is ready, it will come.”\n\n\tShe has noticed patterns: her first three films explored identity, home and belonging, while “Eternals” and “Hamnet” deal with oneness and dissolving the illusion of separation. “I think that’s what I’m looking for – how do we dissolve the illusion of separation that we feel with each other, and feel that kind of oneness that you feel in the moment you are born or when you’re in nature.”\n\n\t“I believe in the power of threes,” she added. “Since I made two about that, I think there’s a third one. I just don’t know what it is.”\n\n\tAs for Kore-eda, he continues production on “Sheep In The Box,” maintaining the work-life balance that isn’t really a balance at all. “I’ve become someone who’s always working, and that’s not unpleasant for me,” he admitted. But he wants younger filmmakers to know they don’t have to be 60-year-old workaholics to make films. “If they think filmmaking might be fun even when choosing it as work, that would be good.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Podnieks on Podnieks” is the story of a phenomenally influential Latvian documentarian who is remembered by relatively few today – but whose work was once seen by over 40 million people in the former Soviet Union. The film played last week at Ji.hlava Intl. Documentary Film Festival.\n\n\n\n\n\tThat Juris Podnieks’ films, which chronicled what he called “the death of the monster,” as the director called the last days of the Soviet Union, were seen by anyone was something of a miracle. A likely reason that happened was because he worked in the era he did, says Anna Viduleja, who co-directed “Podnieks on Podnieks” with Antra Cilinska, a former editor for Podnieks.\n\t\n\n\tIn fact, Podnieks, who died under mysterious circumstances in 1992, gained worldwide attention for his relentless need to “be there” during events that would turn out to mark the end of the Cold War.\n\n\n\tThe BBC would turn to him for accounts of uprisings in his native Latvia in which protesters faced off with Moscow-backed armies, sometimes fatally. Podnieks himself witnessed his cameraman taking a fatal hit while the team were recording events on the streets of Riga in 1992. Another colleague died later of injuries caused by troops trying to quell the mass choruses singing songs banned by the Soviets, something Podnieks put into his film “Homeland.”\n\n\tBut in Podnieks’ own country, he was celebrated and respected as a rare source of truth telling and courageous reporting on a world that was changing fast.\n\n\t“Podnieks on Podnieks” reveals the thoughts, worries and drive of this remarkable figure, using personal diaries, photographs and film footage, presenting what Viduleja calls the life journey of a filmmaker who reflects on his obsessions but is unable to control them.\n\t\n\n\tWhen the film was being conceived, says Viduleja, the discovery of the director’s personal journals was a breakthrough moment.\n\n\t“After I was invited into the project by Antra Cilinska, director, producer and the head of JPS – Juris Podnieks Studio,” she recalls, “I found a Latvian magazine Kino Raksti from 2000 in which there was an excerpt from Juris Podnieks diary from 1975.”\n\n\t“The passion for his creative tasks, precise details of the filmmaking process in the Riga Documentary Film Studio as well as his kind attitude to his newly wed wife and personal hopes were in these pages.”\n\n\tTelling Podnieks story incorporating his own thoughts, she says, “seemed to be the answer.”\n\n\t“I looked at the shelf above and the books: Fellini on Fellini, Bergman on Bergman, Kieslowski on Kieslowski, Cassavetes on Cassavetes… so “Podnieks on Podnieks” seemed to be the right title.”\n\n\tAt first, the directing duo had only the diary excerpts the magazine had used, Viduleja says, “but then Podnieks diaries started to appear one by one as we were working with the particular film archive materials. As if Juris would be watching us from the edge of a cloud above there asking, ‘Do you need my thoughts on the making of the Strelnieku zvaigznajs (‘The Constellation of the Riflemen’)?”\n\n\tAnd more diary pages would be uncovered.\n\n\tThey found detailed entries written during the making of the film about the last Latvian Rifles units and also Lenin’s Praetorian Guard soldiers.\n\n\t“Or later as we researched the materials on Podnieks making the film about the post-war generation of sculptors: ‘Sisyphus Rolling a Rock.’ Or his most dear film, ‘Is it Easy to be Young?’”\n\n\tEach time, someone who had been close to Podnieks would share more of the director’s journals with Viduleja and Cilinska.\n\n\tThe latter film was made based on the confessions of young people living in Latvia who openly spoke of patronizing teachers and parents, worries for the future and fears over fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\n\n\tThe 1986 film also included accounts by former conscripts who had been forced to participate in the Russian occupation of Afghanistan, making clear the hopelessness and brutality of the war, starkly contrasting with the Kremlin’s version of a war of progress and purpose.\n\t\n\n\tIf made even a few months earlier, “Is it Easy” would likely have been banned, says Viduleja. Instead, “The political changes that were started by Gorbachev gave this film a chance to land on the screen and after that it was not possible to stop it anymore.”\n\n\t“Juris’ cousin, Inara Zeltiņa, granted us his diaries, revealing the tasks he set himself during the process of creating his honest relationship with the young generation portrayed in the film.”\n\n\tIn 1978 Podnieks wrote in a letter to his colleague, “Maybe it is my arrogance to say that I shall come and using my eye and my head shall tell the whole truth, but I am determined to do so!”\n\n\t“Podnieks ability to recognize the wider political and social processes that were happening in the society,” says Viduleja, “combined with his sincere and deep interest in the life of the person he was talking to, is the reason why his film was understood and valued by those tens of millions of Soviet people.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRoland Sejko’s doc “A State Film,” culled from a vast archive of official footage made under the regime of Albanian strongman Enver Hoxha, is a fascinating study in the power of image and myth.\n\n\n\n\n\tScreened in the main competition at the Czech Republic’s primary annual nonfiction film event, the Ji.hlava Intl. Documentary Film Festival, the compilation of carefully constructed images for the masses contains much to unpack, says Sejko.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve been working for several years with propaganda film archives — first with Istituto Luce Cinecitta, and also with the archives of the Albanian communist regime,” Sejko says. “Both contain thousands of films created to construct a political narrative, often with striking cinematic ambition.”\n\n\n\tThe genre is one Sejko explored in his previous film, “The Image Machine of Alfredo C.,” screened in 2021 at the Venice film fest. That film tells the true story of an Istituto Luce cameraman who filmed Mussolini and fascist propaganda, and, eventually, the head of communist Albania.\n\n\t“It was a hybrid film, but during its making I realized that the vast Albanian film archive — and the central figure of Enver Hoxha — had never been narrated exclusively through their own images.”\n\n\tSo Sejko, as a professional archivist and head of the editorial department for Italy’s Cinecitta Luce, set about analyzing and curating from the decades of state propaganda films.\n\n\t“The Albanian propaganda newsreels and documentaries clearly bear the mark of Eastern Bloc cinematography,” Sejko says. “The first Albanian camera operators were trained by Soviet masters — starting with Roman Karmen, the legendary chronicler of revolutions and wars.”\n\t\n\n\t“There was never a manual for the propaganda cameraman, no written rulebook for how to film a regime. Yet something invisible governed their images. A First of May parade filmed in communist Albania looks strikingly similar to one filmed in Moscow or Bucharest or Sofia in the same years.”\n\n\tIndeed, the images of cheering worker heroes and dancing girls in traditional folk garb seen in “A State Film” are hauntingly familiar.\n\n\tSpanning the post-WWII years, with Albanians urged to “obey and execute the laws of the government” while honoring heroes’ bloody sacrifices, the footage makes clear Hoxha’s devotion to Stalin and Yugoslavian dictator Josip Broz Tito.\n\n\tOutsize portraits of all three are hauled down endless streets as crowds of obligatory fans parade their wheelbarrows, shovels and carbines. Praises are sung for industry while defensive bunkers, of which Hoxha build hundreds of thousands, withstand test blasts, proving their readiness to stand up to decadent imperialist forces from the West.\n\n\tDogs and guinea pigs are sacrificed, presumably to test exposure to potential gas attacks.\n\n\tAnd all the while, there’s always another rousing patriotic song for the peasants to sing.\n\n\t“It is not just the cameraman’s technique that creates this resemblance,” Sejko says. “It is the vision of the world being shown: always the same choreography of collective joy.”\n\n\tThat said, as audiences take in “A State Film,” they begin to perceive that the images have been somehow distilled. Then they may notice the soundtrack, with the original heavy-handed narration replace by the sounds of the breeze in trees, birds chirping and feet tramping unpaved roads.\n\n\t“In official propaganda films — newsreels, documentaries, parades — the narrator’s voice was not descriptive but prescriptive: it told viewers what to think. Replacing it with another commentary, even a critical one, would have meant repeating the same mechanism.”\n\n\t“So I removed not only the voice but the whole original soundtrack, keeping only what was real — applause, songs, speeches. I built a new, realistic soundscape with footsteps, murmurs, creaks, silences, as if the scenes had been recorded live. This new texture restores the images’ physicality and opens a space where sound itself becomes a narrative tool.”\n\t\n\n\tAdd to this the intercutting of footage from Hoxha’s personal archive, showing moments away from the cheering masses, invariably featuring drives in the dictator’s favorite black Mercedes, and a striking contrast emerges.\n\n\tThese motifs take on a symbolic value, according to Sejko, and suggest the loneliness and isolation of power. “A State Film” raises the question of how forms of propaganda have changed, while also forcing uncomfortable realizations as to how many of the classic tropes are still being rolled out today.\n\n\t“A State Film” has been described as demonstrating “how the archive is not just a repository of images, but a tool for interpreting and rewriting history.”\n\n\tIndeed, the chilling parade of carefully staged scenes does seem to transcend the framework of national history, and, as the director says, explore the function of the image in the political sphere, and its ability to create collective memory.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf only we could hear Norma Desmond rise up and sing: Don’t cha wish your girflriend, that little tart Betty Schaefer, was hot like me?\n\n\tThat does not happen in Nicole Scherzinger‘s current run of shows, which included a diverting stop Thursday night at Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown L.A. The show tunes stayed in their corner, and the Pussycat Dolls oldies stayed in theirs. It was a show with a slightly split personality, with musical theater numbers dominating the first three-quarters and the flashy pop perpetrated by her ex-girl-group taking over the last stretch. \n\t\n\n\tBut it didn’t feel like an impossibly wide chasm. Even as Scherzinger sang two bravura songs from the stage musical that brought her back into the limelight in a big way, “Sunset Blvd.,” you were reminded that that Broadway/West End show was rejiggered some when she was starring in it so that Gloria Swanson was a very distant memory, and so that you had to think of Norma Desmond not as a hag but as being a woman of a certain age who is very much H-O-T-T-O-G-O. And it worked.\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, there’s the F.O.M.O. that the L.A. theater community has suffered from not getting a local transfer of Scherzinger’s run in “Sunset” on Broadway. Of course, many Angelenos made their way east to catch her in that Tony-winning turn in late 2024 and early ’25. “You were everything in ‘Sunset’!” shouted the man in front of me, which is exactly the right thing to shout at a diva performance where everyone is just a little too mature to call out anything about mothering. So the full house was probably made up of about one-third jet-setters who already knew how spectacularly her “With One Look” would go, and two-thirds less-privileged locals who until now had only been able to guess it.\n\t\n\n\tAs the “Sunset” segment unfolded in the middle of her concert’s second act (the show that is “what’s gotten me here today,” as she told the audience), “With One Look” was really just the warm-up, though. The number that followed, “As If We Never Said Goodbye,” was the money song, the one that seemed redolent of Barbra Streisand’s own cover of the Andrew Lloyd Webber neo-classic. Throughout it, I sensed a few of the people around me who seemed eager for the song to end — not because they really wanted Scherzinger to stop singing, but because they were literally jittery on the edge of their seats, barely able to hold off jumping up for the inevitable standing ovation. I felt their twitchiness.  \n\n\tAnd not so very long after that peak, gown-clad classiness: the Pussycat Dolls’ “Buttons,” and the unveiling of a slinky, button-less catsuit to match. Because why not? Scherzinger clearly is favoring her stage-actress era nowadays, but she’s still got the goods to indulge in some throwback choreo, or cardio, from back in the day.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNicole Scherzinger at Walt Disney Concert Hall, Oct. 30, 2025.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTimothy Norris/Los Angeles Philharmonic\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis isn’t a full tour for the singer, but the last of three shows taking place in some of the world’s most storied venues — the Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall and now (the day after she was honored at Variety’s Power of Women L.A. event) Disney Hall. It’s easy to imagine her taking it further on the road, if she doesn’t book another theater gig, or doing a residency. Would it draw a wider split of fans, in other cities, who might be attracted to come only for the Dolls stuff or only for a night of standards? Possibly, but she would likely leave everyone ultimately pleased, either way.\n\n\tThursday’s show certainly announced its primary intentions right at the start, with Scherzinger doing a faithful rendition of “Don’t Rain on My Parade.” That’s a bold way for a singer who hasn’t been known primarily for being in the theater arena that long to start off with — maybe too bold, in declaring that Streisand’s turf is her terra firma, too. Her version was terrific, for what it was, but not an especially imaginative or reinvented pick. From there, she got a little looser with the perennial Halloween/R&B favorite “I Put a Spell on You,” giving good growliness. “Diamonds Are Forever” was a great choice of movie song to include (Variety having previously declared it the best Bond theme of all time), and it was wise that she paid proper homage to the originator, but the issue remains of how difficult it is to out-Bassey Shirley Bassey. (At least she is a dozen times more capable of nailing it than poor, miscast Doja Cat at this year’s Oscars.)\n\t\n\n\tFinally Scherzinger arrived at the first song truly associated with her, with some chan-toozy banter to set it up: “Y’all look so good, I think I might ‘stickwitu’ forever. That reminds me of a song…” Hey, us too. The diversion to Pussycat hit territory was only a momentary one for the moment, veritably a trailer for the show’s finale. But there was something about it that seemed to put her on a surer footing, even as she returned to the stage and film perennials. A medley of Sondheim’s “Losing My Mind” and “Not a Day Goes By,” which seem to have become conjoined in the interpreter mindset somewhere around the turn of the century, offered a good teaser for the mind-losing possibilities of the “Sunset” material to come later.\n\n\tAnd then, for her pre-intermission closer, Scherzinger tackled “Cabaret’s” greatest number, “Maybe This Time,” the patron saint of songs for losers everywhere. She wouldn’t fit into a modern “Cabaret” production where the leading lady has to play it like an unpracticed waif, but she sure would have killed the role in the day when everyone looked to do it as skillfully as Liza. At the end, she sacrificed emotion for a moment of camp, but that was okay. Going back to the sort of nightstand where she kept her water bottle and Kleenex, Scherzinger crouched down in an odd way — was she working off a cramp? — and then reemerged holding something behind her back. “Maybe this time,” she belted, pausing for effect… out come her two biggest trophies, in either hand… “I’ll win!” She referred to them as her friends “Laurence and Antoinette,” as in, of course, an Olivier and a Tony.\n\n\tIntermission thoughts: Either you love this kind of blowsy, broad (in all the senses), old-school show-biz-stuff — lengthy patter interludes included — or you don’t. Anyone who doesn’t hold the same nostalgic hankering for veteran actresses holding court with one-woman shows might not be blamed for opting out. But Scherzinger is operating out of a great tradition with this stuff, and there aren’t a lot of others of her generation filling the void, at least with her profile coming from the pop side and the chops to work it on the theater side. She feels more born to this than she was to being a 2010s pop tart… although she was a good enough actress to pull that off, too. Being an Interscope sex bomb definitely did not allow her to casually walk around the stage making slightly off-color remarks in-between showing off coloratura prowess. All of which is to say, if this is a prelude to her doing shows like this indefinitely, and working up to putting “I’m Still Here” into her repertoire 20 years from now, some of us will be there for it.\n\t\n\n\t“The ladies are looking absolutely divine,” Scherzinger told the audience. “A lot of hot men in the house tonight.” Here’s betting she says that to all the Carnegie and Royal Albert Hall boys. Or maybe not. “Looks like all the WeHos showed up,” she added, getting a big enough roar to drown out whatever she said subsequently. She did not shy away from elbow-nudging humor. Talking of her heritage, she described herself as “Hawaiian, Filipino, Spanish, Chinese, Polish… Irish 2%… I also have some English in me, too. His name is Thom.” Her fiance, Thom Evans, came up for referencing again when she sang the one new, original song of the evening, the pop-R&B vamp “Bullshit”: “This is my idea of a love song. It’s about waiting for that special someone to, how do you say it, get it together (and) put a ring on it. You catch my drift?” Sample lyric: “Wake your ass up before I up and leave.” Flashing a ring after the song was over, she said, “Needless to say, he got the message.”\n\n\tScherzinger did not ignore the folks in the balcony behind her, although she meant to, at times. “You’ve got the best seats in the house!” she informed them early on. Much later, toward the end of the second of three acts, she got verklempt as she started talking about Prince, whom she described as “a big part of who I am — he was my mentor, my big brother.” Retreating back to the nightstand, she took a moment to turn her back to the audience and wipe her nose. “Thank God for these tissues…” Then she remembered there was a whole separate audience behind the stage. “Oh great, you guys are here; I’d forgotten that. Give it up for my surprise party back there.”\n\n\t“Purple Rain” was her main sop to mainstream pop-rock tastes, and to the one who makes her cry. The “La Cage aux Folles”/Jerry Herman/Gloria Gaynor anthem “I Am What I Am” was her main sop to the WeHos, as she put it. As for the pure Broadway demographic in the crowd, although she mostly stuck to musical theater’s greatest hits, it was a delight when, to kick off the final act, she brought out the cheeky “Drowsy Chaperone” number “Show Off,” which is exactly what she intended to do for the finale. She appeared for this last bit in what almost appeared to be an elegant bedroom dressing gown, sipping tea (“Let me put this down before I spill too much,” she said), which eventually showed some leg. And then was abandoned altogether to show a lot more than that, as the show settled into its full-Pussycat end run.\n\t\n\n\tWith the final Pussycat Dolls medley, Scherzinger — hoofing it up in black lace and heels, somehow looking about a foot taller than her 5’5″ frame — was all about the life of a showgirl. That’s what would truly draw ’em in, probably, if she ever deigned to do this as a Vegas residency. \n\n\tBut what most of this Disney Hall audience will remember most is that two-song “Sunset Blvd.” bit, where Norma came alive on west-coast home turf, minus the Broadway stage blood. Without Jamie Lloyd’s cameras there to do close-ups, Scherzinger played the anti-heroine just a little less for obsessive mania and more for pure Barbra-style butter. Norma Desmond doesn’t really have to be portrayed as a killer when, from this murderously good revue, we already understand that Nicole Scherzinger is one.\n\n\tSetlist for Nicole Scherzinger at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, Oct. 30, 2025:\n\n\tDon’t Rain on My ParadeI Put a Spell on YouDiamonds Are ForeverStickwituYou Raise Me Up/ReflectionLosing My Mind/Not a Day Goes ByMaybe This Time\n\n\tSet 2:I Am What I AmBullshitWith One LookAs If We Never Said GoodbyePurple Rain\n\n\tSet 3:Show OffButtonsWhen I Grow UpDon’t ChaDon’t Hold Your Breath\n",

I shot at it and it just stood there, and I shot again, and he backed up and that's when he fell.”\n      \n\n          As you know ... a truck overturned in late October that was carrying Rhesus monkeys from Tulane National Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana -- leading to 21 monkeys escpaing the vehicle.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          13 were coralled by authorities, five were shot on sight after a supervisor mistakenly claimed the monkeys were infected with COVID, herpes, and hepatitis C -- authorities later clarified they weren't -- but three escaped into the wild.\n      \n    \n          One of the other three monkeys was found and captured by authorities Sunday as well ... so, it appears only one is still on the loose.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Animals\n              \n                          \n                Viral\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tRatings for the Kennedy Center Honors took a sharp decline this year. The poor turnout comes shortly after Donald Trump added his name to the historic forum.\n\n\tThis year’s Kennedy Center Honors, hosted by Trump, averaged 3.01 million viewers, according to a report from Nielsen Live + Same Day Panel + Big Data. That represents a 25% dip from last year’s numbers. The 2024 show hit a record low of 4.1 million viewers after reaching 4.5 million viewers the year before.\n\t\n\n\tThe Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to Variety’s request for comment.\n\n\n\tTrump is the first sitting president to host the Kennedy Center Honors, which celebrate “individuals whose unique contributions have shaped our world,” according to the organization’s website. This year’s honorees were George Strait, Sylvester Stallone, KISS, Michael Crawford and Gloria Gaynor.\n\n\tOn Dec. 6, the day before the event, Trump told reporters at the White House, “It’s going to be something that I believe, and I’m going to make a prediction: This will be the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done and they’ve gotten some pretty good ratings, but there’s nothing like what’s going to happen tomorrow night.”\n\n\tTrump has set his sights on remaking the Kennedy Center in his image during his second term, even going so far as to rename the venue “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts” in mid December. The name change has been met with significant blowback, and several scheduled acts have canceled their upcoming performances as a result.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter George Clooney said he felt that newly-named editor-in-chief Bari Weiss was “dismantling CBS News as we speak,” Weiss has responded by inviting him to visit the CBS newsroom. \n\n\t“Bonjour, Mr. Clooney! Big fan of your work. It sounds like you’d like to learn more about ours. This is an open invitation to visit The CBS Broadcast Center, where I’m spending the holidays working to relaunch the Evening News with my colleagues. Tune in January 5,” Weiss said in a statement shared by Paramount Skydance. The “bonjour” was presumably a reference to Clooney, his wife Amal and their twins becoming French citizens this week.\n\t\n\n\tIn a wide-ranging interview with Brent Lang about his career and his latest film “Jay Kelly,” Clooney also touched on the upheaval at CBS News, politics and his activism.\n\n\n\t“Am I worried about film studios? Sure. It’s my business, but my primary loyalty is to my country. I’m much more worried about how we inform ourselves and how we’re going to discern reality without a functioning press,” he said. \n\n\tClooney also addressed President Trump’s lawsuits against ABC News and CBS News in Variety‘s interview. “If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go fuck yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,” Clooney says. “That’s simply the truth.”\n\n\tWeiss, who took over CBS News in October, recently came under fire for abruptly pulling a “60 Minutes” report on El Salvador’s CECOT prison.\n\n\tThe response from Weiss was first reported by the New York Post.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIsiah Whitlock Jr., an actor best known for playing the corrupt state senator Clay Davis on “The Wire,” died on Tuesday in New York, Variety has confirmed. He was 71.\n\n\tHis manager, Brian Liebman, shared the news on Instagram, writing: “It is with tremendous sadness that I share the passing of my dear friend and client Isiah Whitlock Jr. If you knew him — you loved him. A brilliant actor and even better person. May his memory forever be a blessing. Our hearts are so broken. He will be very, very missed.”\n\t\n\n\tIndiana-born Whitlock was a prolific character actor who was a frequent collaborator of Spike Lee, appearing in his films “BlacKkKlansman,” “Da 5 Bloods,” “She Hate Me,” “25th Hour,” “Red Hook Summer” and “Chi-Raq.” \n\n\n\tAcross many of his projects, he developed the catchphrase “sheeeeee-it,” an elongated pronunciation of the word “shit.”  It started in “She Hate Me” and “25th Hour,” and then the writers of “The Wire” began incorporating it into the HBO series. Whitlock said he could be stopped on the street two to three times per day by fans asking him to say the catchphrase. In a meta turn, Whitlock got to play a man obsessed with “The Wire” in the 2011 comedy “Cedar Rapids.”\n\n\tWhitlock also played a doctor in Martin Scorsese’s “Goodfellas” and had roles in “Chappelle’s Show,” “Pieces of April,” “Enchanted” and Pixar’s “Cars 3” and “Lightyear.” He also lent his voice to “Hoppers,” Pixar’s animated sci-fi comedy due in 2026.\n\n\tIn Seasons 2 through 4 of “Veep,” Whitlock played George Maddox, the U.S. Secretary of Defense who runs against Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ character Selina Meyer in the 2016 primaries.\n",

You’re in luck. One of the best online learning sites is Rosetta Stone, and right now, the site is offering a limited-time deal that gets you unlimited access to Rosetta Stone‘s language-learning program for 45% off.\n\n\tWhile a monthly subscription to Rosetta Stone starts at $15.99 and up, this deal gets you unlimited access to Rosetta Stone forever, for a one-time payment of only $219. That’s right: buy one price now and lock in access to the online learning site for life. The deal is a nearly half-off discount from the original price of $399, and the best Rosetta Stone deal we’ve ever seen.\n\n\n\tPrefer less of a commitment? The new Rosetta Stone promo also drops the price of their single-language, 12-month access plan, to just $143 (regularly $239+). Meanwhile, a three-month plan is down to $47.85 for all three months (regularly $60).\n\n\tAll Rosetta Stone’s plans offer bite-sized lessons available online and offline; it’s a fully immersive environment for long-lasting learning, with leading speech recognition technology to perfect your accent. The lifetime subscription boasts the best value, with access to the program’s full roster of 25 languages (and counting) forever, with unlimited access. The monthly subscriptions let you choose to focus on one language at a time.\n\n\tThe most popular languages on the platform include Spanish, German, French, Italian, English and Japanese but their roster also includes courses for more unique languages like Turkish, Arabic, Chinese, Greek, Hebrew and Hindi. \n\n\n\tWhile there are free language-learnings apps like Duolingo and less expensive options like Mondly, Rosetta Stone stands out because of its patented technology such as “TruAccent” speech-recognition which assesses pronunciation and even allows you to adjust how strictly it grades for those looking to master their fluency or native speaking.\n\n\tReviewers have also noted how much faster Rosetta Stone’s 20-class courses progress compared to free language-learning services. While apps like Duolingo are known for hammering in vocabulary through simple flashcard-type quizzes, Rosetta Stone progresses to verbs and conjugation through more complex learning models. \n\n\tGet lifetime access to Rosetta Stone for a one-time fee of $219 now. Sign up for Rosetta Stone’s limited-time offer here before the deal expires.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSimu Liu said in a new interview with Collider that Robert Downey Jr. had a “convoy of trailers” on the set of “Avengers: Doomsday,” which the film’s cast and crew hilariously named “Downey Land.” Liu returns to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Shang-Chi in the 2026 tentpole opposite Downey as the villainous Doctor Doom. Downey’s return to Marvel as a villain and not in his iconic Iron Man role is fueling the majority of interest in “Doomsday.” It appears the studio pulled out all the stops on set for the Oscar winner’s grand return.\n\t\n\n\t“Downey famously has this convoy of trailers and this whole area in base camp that we affectionately called Downey Land,” Liu said. “And I remember getting invited to Downey Land for the first time and just showing up in this tent, and it’s all this beautiful Andy Warhol-esque artwork, except all the characters are Downey. I mean, he’s so self-aware.”\n\n\n\t“So, he greeted me, and then I didn’t realize that Downey Land has its own chefs, but I had brought my set lunch, and he was like, ‘Oh, no, no, no. We don’t do that here,’” Liu continued. “The chefs had come and laid out this full buffet, and I was like, ‘Oh, I’ll put this away.’ And then just the people walking through, I was like, ‘I cannot believe I’m having lunch with these people.’”\n\n\tLiu and Downey are just two members of the sprawling “Avengers: Doomsday” cast, which mixes Marvel stalwarts like Chris Hemsworth, Florence Pugh and Tom Hiddleston with returning X-Men actors like Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn and James Marsden, plus new MCU favorites like Channing Tatum, Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby and a lot more. It’s unclear which actors Liu shares scenes with in the film, but it’s safe to say he was a big admirer of every scene partner.\n\t\n\n\t“For me, it was very imperative that I put that fan side away,” Liu told Collider. “I compartmentalized that side of me because I was like, ‘I have a job to do. I have a job to do, and the worst thing that I can do right now is be a fan. I’m not a fan. I’m a coworker.’ As ridiculous as that sounds, or as ridiculous as it sounded to me at the time, I was like, ‘No. I have to treat these people as my equals, even though I’m literally like a little boy right now.’”\n\n\t“Avengers: Doomsday” opens in theaters Dec. 18 from Disney.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThis year, David Ellison managed to do for Warner Bros. Discovery what WBD CEO David Zaslav had struggled to do for more than three years: dramatically boost the market value of the company that combined Discovery and Warner Bros.\n\n\tShares of Warner Bros. Discovery, formed in April 2022, zoomed to all-time highs in 2025 — up more than 170% for the year. WBD as of Dec. 30 has a market capitalization of $71.8 billion, up from about $25 billion at the start of the year.\n\t\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery’s Wall Street rally was triggered by Ellison: After his Skydance Media had swallowed up Paramount Global, he aggressively set his sights on buying WBD next — backed with billions from his father, Larry Ellison — and triggered an M&A battle that caused big swings in the stocks of WBD, Paramount Skydance and Netflix.\n\n\n\tNetflix shares were up as much as 51% in mid-2025, as the streaming leader continued to show solid growth and analysts continued to be bullish on its future prospects. In October, amid the continuing climb of its share price, Netflix executed a 10-for-1 stock split, to make it more affordable. 22.3% as of Dec. 30.\n\n\tAfter Netflix announced an $83 billion deal to buy Warner Bros.’s studios and HBO Max businesses, investors got spooked at the prospect of the deal’s uncertainty and heavy debt load. Still, Netflix shares ended the year up around 22%. Paramount shareholders, meanwhile, were enthusiastic about David Ellison’s play for the company, but PSKY’s stock price has fallen down as WBD repeatedly rebuffed the Paramount bid.\n\n\tComcast, which made an unsuccessful bid that proposed combining the WBD streaming and studios business with Comcast’s related businesses, saw its stock price languish, closing down 17% for the year. On Jan. 2, Comcast’s spin-off of Versant (comprising cable networks like CNBC, MS NOW and USA) is set to close. The goal of the Versant transaction is to unshackle the NBC broadcast and Peacock streaming businesses from the declining cable TV networks and convince investors the newly streamlined Comcast is worth more.\n\t\n\n\tThe M&A drama surrounding Warner Bros. isn’t over yet. David Ellison has launched a hostile takeover attempt for Warner Bros. Discovery, hoping to convince WBD shareholders that his $30-per-share bid (which the WBD board has rejected) is a better than Netflix’s terms. Last week, Paramount Skydance updated its offer for WBD with certain new provisions; among those, Larry Ellison made an “irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion” toward Paramount’s all-cash offer for WBD. The WBD board is expected to turn that down, too, with a formal response in the next few days.\n\n\tWhether the Ellisons will go higher in their quest to capture Warner Bros. Discovery remains to be seen. Note that whoever ends up owning Warner Bros. Discovery, Zaslav stands to cash in from a sale: He’s set to become a billionaire given his WBD stock holdings regardless of whether Netflix completes the deal or Paramount Skydance swoops in to poach the whole company.\n\n\tHere’s a chart showing the performance of top media stocks:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCreated with Datawrapper\n\t\n\n\n",

As the brand is gearing up for 2026, the year marks two milestones for the company: 20 years of “Hannah Montana” and “High School Musical,” where actors and musicians like Miley Cyrus, Zac Efron, and Ashley Tisdale got their start on children’s programming. For Brenda Kelly Grant, Senior Vice President, Talent and Casting, Disney Branded Television, fostering and uplifting the industry’s upcoming slate of actors is key when it comes to future programming.\n\t\n\n\t“For my entire casting team, we remember that everyone we’re looking at is in a stage of becoming,” reveals Grant. “It’s our job to interpret the gray area. We have an initiative where we will actually help talent. For example, if we have really good actors, but they’re not so great at singing or dancing, we’ll pair them up as it gets closer to the testing process with coaches who can help them with the singing and with the dancing. Our objective is to remember that this talent is becoming. We want to create the very best atmosphere for them from the beginning of the audition process until hopefully they move to other places within our company.”\n\n\n\tThroughout the last few years, former Disney talent such as the Jonas Brothers and Selena Gomez have returned to collaborate with young actors on projects like “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie” and “Wizards Beyond Waverly Place.” It’s an opportunity for young actors to gain insight into working at Disney, while also offering former stars the chance to explore what they’re passionate about on or off screen.\n\t\n\n\t “I think why they come back and work with us is about the opportunities and the scope of what the Walt Disney Company can offer them,” said Grant. “We have so many sandboxes to play in, whether it’s producing, creating, or doing voice overs. The possibilities are endless. It really goes through all of our senior leadership of just creating a best home for talent and being able to be in partnership with people to create what they want to see and what they want to feel.”\n\n\tWith the release of Season 2 of “Percy Jackson and The Olympians,” Grant is excited for audiences to see and connect with actors like Walker Scobell, Leah Sava Jeffries, and Aryan Simhadri as they begin to return to Camp Half-Blood. As the leads of the series, Grant is hopeful that the casting and work of younger actors at Disney Entertainment Television resonates with viewers at any age.\n\n\t“Walker was a young kid in the casting process, and now he’s like a man,” said Grant. “When I see Leah come to me and she’s like, “You know what? What else can I do?” People see themselves in our talent. They see their stories and their experiences, and the challenges that you face in the world of becoming an adult. They see the power and like what they’re doing. That’s really appealing to people. We always not just want to meet our viewers where they’re at, but we want to exceed those expectations.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMeyer Gottlieb, who headed Samuel Goldwyn Films and produced films including “Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,” died Monday in Los Angeles. He was 86. \n\n\tTom Rothman, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, said in a statement, “Meyer was a gentleman of the old school. I was fortunate to work for him when he ran the Samuel Goldwyn Company, in the heyday of independent film. I learned an enormous amount from him — most importantly, that it is possible to make a life in Hollywood without sacrificing integrity and honesty, both of which he embodied entirely, along with smarts, wisdom, and kindness. I send my sincere condolences to his loving family during this difficult time.”\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Poland just before the Germans invaded, Gottlieb was a Holocaust survivor who lived in Ukraine labor camps during the war and then in a displaced person’s camp in Germany. After a great aunt brought him to Los Angeles, he learned English at school and eventually graduated from UCLA. \n\n\n\tHe became president and COO of the Samuel Goldwyn Co. in 1988 after helped Samuel Goldwyn Jr. revive the company in 1978 with classic films from Goldwyn’s father’s library. \n\n\tAmong the other films he produced for Goldwyn were “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” remake, starring Ben Stiller. As a top Goldwyn executive, he shepherded releases including the received Michael Apted film “Amazing Grace,” “Mystic Pizza,” “Eat, Drink, Man, Woman,” “Super Size Me” and “The Squid and the Whale.”\n\n\tHe is survived by his wife Pattikay, two daughters and two grandchildren.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tJustin Theroux has been tapped as the new face of The Luxury Collection, starring in the brand’s global “I Am The Luxury Collection” campaign. The actor leads a series of cinematic spots from Stept Studios that position him as The Curator, guiding viewers through the Marriott-owned portfolio of more than 130 hotels and resorts across 40 countries. The campaign, launching globally on HBO Max, highlights the brand’s emphasis on destination-driven travel, moving from Madrid to Los Cabos to Savannah.\n\n\n\t“Luxury means uniqueness,” Theroux tells Variety over a Zoom call from the Canary Islands, where he’s shooting the Apple TV+ miniseries “Wild Things.” “It’s the ability to do something rare or rarefied, something that expands your mind culturally. That can happen in third class on a train through China or at the Ritz-Carlton. It’s about having an experience that feels different from your day-to-day life.”\n\n\n\n\n\tTheroux based his portrayal of The Curator on the kind of concierge he’s encountered in truly great hotels, the ones who sit you down with an espresso and map out their favorite spots from an authentic, local perspective. “I’ve met those people who are extra helpful and completely additive to your experience,” he says. “They tell you what’s actually happening in a city — the art exhibit that’s only there for a month, the local thing that’s more authentic. They’re cultural concierges. They innovate.” \n\n\tThat emphasis on individuality aligns with Theroux’s own frustration with what he sees as Instagram’s flattening effect on global travel. “It’s done great for tourism but a terrible disservice to travel,” he says. “It’s made us think travel is seamless and requires no adventure.” In the campaign’s hero film, “Beautiful Contradiction,” that sense of adventure translates into a series of visual juxtapositions (heritage sites and modern design, bustling capitals and quiet shorelines) shot as if The Curator were slipping between worlds with the same ease that great travel demands.\n\n\n\tOn the acting side, he recently wrapped “The Devil Wears Prada” sequel, reuniting with Emily Blunt for what he calls a “forward-leaning, rich and stupid” character who was “a blast” to play.  “Everyone knew the movie they were making,” he says, noting the thrill of sharing scenes with Meryl Streep. “I’ve obviously watched her my entire life, so to all of a sudden, be performing with her is such a pleasure and an honor.”\n\n\tNext up is his press tour for “Fallout,” where he play, in his own words, a heightened, Howard Hughes-type billionaire opposite Walton Goggins. “Me and Walton get to chew a lot of scenery together,” he says. “The world is insane in the best way.”\n\n\tHe’s also continuing to expand Ray’s, the downtown New York bar he co-owns, into select cities. After pop-ups in Austin and Miami, Detroit is next on the shortlist. “We want to avoid the typical spots,” he says, noting that it likely won’t pop up in Los Angeles. “We want places where it organically clicks.”\n\n\tBut before his schedule shifts back to red carpets and bar scouting, Theroux says he’s eyeing a few of The Luxury Collection properties for his own travels. Kyoto and Tokyo at the top of the list, with a detour through Madrid. The appeal, he says, is the same thing that drew him to the campaign in the first place. “Every property moves to its own rhythm with unique charm and soul,” he says. “True luxury isn’t about sameness. It’s about character — and uncovering something real and unexpected.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tHulu is down to an unbeatable $4.99/month for 12 months with this limited-time Black Friday bundle deal. \n\n\tThe deal, which runs through Monday, Dec. 1, gets you instant access to Hulu and Disney+ for less than the price of a single subscription. To put it into context, both Hulu and Disney+ normally cost $11.99/month individually, so the Black Friday bundle deal offers a 79% savings.\n\n\n\tUnlike some of this year’s Black Friday streaming deals, which only offer a discounted rate for a month or two, Hulu’s deal lets you lock in the $4.99 price for an entire year. The Disney+ Hulu Bundle includes ad-supported Disney+ and Hulu accounts for only $4.99/month in total. Both deals will auto-renew at its normal price after 12 months.\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat Are the Best Hulu Black Friday Deals 2025?\t\n\n\tHulu has two other Black Friday deals that are live right now for a limited time.\n\n\tYou can get the Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max bundle discounted to just $19.99/month total for all three services. That saves you 43% versus paying for each streamer separately, and this is one of the most popular streaming deals online.\n\n\tSports fans, meantime, can snatch up the new Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Unlimited bundle, which is discounted to just $29.99/month for Black Friday. Access to all three streamers normally costs $53.97/month (and ESPN Unlimited on its own is usually $29.99/month) so viewers are getting a big cost savings with this Black Friday deal.\n\n\tAll of the above offers get you access to Hulu’s ad-supported plan, which means occasional ads in between shows and segments. Hulu subscribers get unlimited access to the streamer’s vast library of original shows and movies such as “Only Murders in the Building” (which returned for its fifth season this year), “FX’s “The Bear” (which debuted its fourth season this June) and “The Kardashians” (currently on its seventh season). Other popular titles include “Futurama,” “Welcome to Wrexham,” “Grey’s Anatomy,” “The Masked Singer” and dozens more.\n\n\n\tHulu’s vast film library also includes buzzy titles such as “Poor Things,” “Dune,” “Spencer,” “The Worst Person in the World, “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Elvis,” “The Batman” and more. \n\n\tSubscribers will also have access to Hulu’s livestreamed events, which have included some of the biggest music and cultural celebrations in the country like Lollapalooza, ESSENCE Festival of Culture and the iHeartRadio Music Festival. \n\n\tHulu’s Black Friday deal goes live the same day as its limited-time discount on its Starz add-on, which is down to $2.99/month for 12 months. Check out more details on Hulu’s Starz add-on deal here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLos Angeles maintained its place as the global hub for film and TV production last year, even as the overall marketplace shrank, according to a report issued Tuesday by FilmLA.\n\n\tOut of 857 films and scripted TV series released in 2024, 18.3% were shot in Los Angeles — nearly unchanged from the 18.5% share in 2023. Its closest competitor is Georgia, where 9.8% of productions released in 2024 were shot.\n\n\n\tThe U.K. is growing its share of the overall market, thanks to a surge in streaming and cable TV series shot there. Its marketshare grew from 6.6% to 8.8%.\n\t\n\n\tFilmLA handles location permits around the L.A. region, and is the key source of data for production volume in Los Angeles. For this report, the agency sought to measure L.A.’s overall marketshare by gathering location data from IMDbPro. FilmLA has been issuing its Scripted Content Study since 2022, when it found that L.A. held 21.9% of overall marketshare.\n\n\tThe study aims to capture all English-language film and scripted TV productions released by U.S.-based companies. The study does not factor in production budgets or the duration of film shoots, instead simply counting each production.\n\n\tThe total number of such productions declined from 1,040 in 2022, to 990 in 2023, and to 857 in 2024. Some of that decline is attributable to the actors and writers strikes of 2023, which disrupted production for about half the year. But the industry has also continued to pull back on production since then, as companies rein in their streaming ambitions.\n\n\tCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom led an effort to expand the state’s tax incentive for production from $330 million to $750 million this past summer, which should start to show an effect next year.\n\t\n\n\t“Ultimately, this study reveals little that California’s creative community does not already understand on a personal level,” said Philip Sokoloski, a spokesperson for the agency, in a release. “There are far fewer film projects being made in Los Angeles than there were in the recent past. Expanded options for attracting and retaining film jobs – as enacted this past July — are not only good for California’s economy, they are a critical form of protection for working families.”\n\n\tThe report shows significant declines in British Columbia and New York, and slight increases in Ontario and New Jersey.\n\n\tLos Angeles saw a sharp drop in cable TV series released in 2024 — from 26 to 11 — while it saw an increase in theatrical films, from 21 to 25. Streaming series also dropped significantly, from 49 to 37, but streaming movies rebounded, from 17 to 29.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter starting out as a scrappy little show and subject to some awkward teen years, the Critics Choice Awards have matured into their third decade. The 31st Annual Critics Choice Awards will air live on E! on Jan. 4, recognizing the best in film and television for the year. Comedian Chelsea Handler will be back as host, as she has ably handled duties for the previous five years.The film awards, selected by nearly 575 voting members of the CCA, are often a strong indicator of what lies ahead at the Oscars. Take this year: after missing out at both the Golden Globes and SAG Awards, “Anora” took the top prize at the Critics Choice Awards — a feat it repeated shortly thereafter at the Academy Awards. Similarly, three of the acting winners went on to triumph at the show.So it stands to reason that the films being pegged for Oscar glory are likely to show up at Critics Choice, especially considering there are 10 best picture slots. Films looking likely to fill the quota include “Hamnet,” “One Battle After Another,” “Sentimental Value,” “Sinners” and “Wicked: For Good.” Other films that have yet to be widely seen but are heavily favored include “Avatar: Fire and Ash” and “Marty Supreme” and, still in the mix, are “Bugonia,” “Frankenstein,” “Jay Kelly” and “Train Dreams.”What’s fascinating is the amount of foreign-language films that have received critical acclaim and could factor into the race. While Joachim Trier’s family drama “Sentimental Value” is looking certain as a best pic nominee, there are several other movies that are gaining momentum, including Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just an Accident,” which won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival this year, besting “Sentimental Value.” Its selection as France’s entry in the international feature Oscar race pushed Richard Linklater’s “Nouvelle Vague” out of contention in that category, but that film — about the making of “Breathless” — might just break into best picture on its own. Also building buzz are South Korea’s “No Other Choice,” from Park Chan-wook, Tunisia’s “The Voice of Hind Rijab” by Kaouther Ben Hania, and Brazil’s “The Secret Agent,” from Kleber Mendonça Filho.This is not to say that the Critics Choice Awards are bound to any other voting organization — they often surprise with their selections. Just this year, they named “Wicked” helmer Jon M. Chu best director after he failed to be recognized in the category by the Academy. Chu even bested four directors who were nominated, including Sean Baker, who won the director Oscar and saw “Anora” win best pic, screenplay, editing and actress. The CCA’s animated winner wasn’t the wildly popular “Inside Out 2” or eventual Oscar winner “Flow” but “The Wild Robot.” And in editing, they awarded “Challengers” — a film that didn’t even score an Oscar nod in the category.Perhaps the way the Critics Choice Awards show their own identity the most is in the additional categories and increased nomination slots. Acting categories are open to as many as six nominees, and they include awards for ensemble and best young actor/actress. They also have a category for best comedy film, allowing even more movies a shot at glory.And really, the more the merrier, as films of all genres and scopes are celebrated and it’s refreshing to see love spread between so many films.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBust out the apple sauce — the beloved ’80s motherhood comedy “Baby Boom” is getting a reboot at Amazon MGM Studios. \n\n\tThe streamer has set prolific filmmaker Michael Showalter (“The Idea of You,” “Hello, My Name is Doris”) as director for a new take on the film. The original was a vehicle for the comic genius of the late Diane Keaton. She starred as a hard-driving career woman in the retail food business, unexpectedly saddled with an infant. Through a series of difficult (bordering on absurd) choices, she learns the value of hard work on her own terms. \n\t\n\n\tWhile a potential setting, premise and cast are currently unknown, the project is described by sources as a “reimagining.” Producers on the new version include Stacey Sher for Shiny Penny and Showalter and Jordana Mollick for Semi-Formal Productions. Katie Aquino will executive produce for Shiny Penny. Emily Crook will oversee for Semi-Formal.  “Baby Boom” 2.0 is part of a multi-year first-look deal between Amazon MGM Studios and Semi-Formal. \n\n\n\tKeaton’s original “Baby Boom” was directed by Charles Shyer, who co-wrote the script with his former partner and producer Nancy Meyers. It spawned a short-lived sitcom version on NBC, starring “Charlie’s Angels” member Kate Jackson and “The View” panelist Joy Behar. \n\n\tShowalter’s latest film, “The Idea of You,” starred Anne Hathaway and Nicholas Galitzine and became Prime Video’s most successful romantic comedy debut ever. His upcoming projects include the Christmas comedy feature “Oh. What. Fun.” for Amazon MGM, starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Felicity Jones. That is set to begin streaming on Prime Video on December 3, 2025\n\t\n\n\tSher is the venerable career producer known for work with auteurs like Quentin Tarantino (“Pulp Fiction,” “Django Unchained” and “The Hateful Eight”) and Steven Soderbergh (“Erin Brockovich,” “Out of Sight” and “Contagion”).\n\n\tThe InSneider was first to report on the “Baby Boom” revival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSeason 5 of “Stranger Things” has already boosted the series to a viewership record — before the new episodes have even been released.\n\n\tAs fans rewatch or newly discover the sci-fi series ahead of its final entry premiering on Nov. 26, all four previous seasons have made the Netflix Top 10. This is the first time a Netflix series has ever had four seasons charting at once. \n\n\tDuring the week of Nov. 17-23, “Stranger Things” Season 1 was the No. 3 most-watched English-language series with 4.1 million views, followed by Season 4 in fifth place with 3.3 million views. Season 2 landed at No. 7 with Season 3 at No. 9, though both seasons tied (along with No. 8 title “Gabby’s Dollhouse”) with about 3.1 million views.\n\t\n\n\t“Stranger Things” Season 5 can certainly be expected to set its own viewership records at Netflix when it makes its Top 10 debut next week, given the series’ status as one of Netflix’s most important titles ever and how long its been since fans have been waiting for a new installment. Season 4, which was released in 2022, remains Netflix’s third-most popular English-language series of all time with 140.7 million views in its first 91 days of streaming, and 2019’s Season 3 remained on that list at No. 10 until being booted by “Wednesday” Season 2 just a few months ago. (The series debuted in 2016, with Season 2 following in 2017.)\n\n\n\tIn a first for a Netflix series, “Stranger Things” Season 5 also looks to turn a profit at the box office. After the debut of Season 5 Part 1 on Nov. 16 and Part 2 on Christmas Day, Netflix will release the series finale concurrently on streaming and in theaters on New Year’s Eve.\n\t\n\n\tThe only shows to beat “Stranger Things” Season 1 on the Netflix Top 10 during the week of Nov. 17-23 were “The Beast in Me,” which led with 14.1 million views in its second week on the chart, and Season 1 of “Absentia,” the Amazon Prime Video series that recently landed on Netflix. In its second week on the streamer, Season 1 took second place with 8.2 million views. “Absentia” Season 2 came in between “Stranger Things” Seasons 1 and 4, landing at No. 4 with 4 million views. And Season 3 of “Absentia” was the No. 10 title on the chart with 2.3 million views.\n\n\tAlso of note on the Netflix Top 10 for Nov. 17-23 was the film “Champagne Problems,” which debuted as the most-watched title overall with 20.5 million views.\n\n\tSee the Netflix Top 10 for Nov. 17-23 below, beginning with English-language shows and movies and followed by non-English-language shows and movies.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

Troy won the prize for his work on his directorial debut, “Midnight in the Orange Grove,” a coming-of-age thriller which he co-wrote with “American Psycho” writer Guinevere Turner.\n\n\t“Midnight in the Orange Grove” is based on a true story about a 17-year-old art student who starts depicting suppressed childhood memories in her work after her adoptee mother is given a severe medical diagnosis. Through art and therapy, the heroine begins to unpack unsettling truths about her past in a journey of identity, forgiveness and revelations. The film stars Isa Yamileth, Jason London, Cameron Rhodes and has a cameo from “Killer’s of the Flower Moon” star Cara Jade Myers. \n\t\n\n\tThough “Midnight in the Orange Grove” is not a Native-themed film, Troy is part Chiricahua Apache and thus the had dual Los Angeles and East Coast screenings in honor of Indigenous Peoples Month at L.A. SkinsFest and the Pocahontas Reframed Film Festival in Richmond, Va. It is the first non-Native themed film to screen at the latter.\n\n\n\tTroy has already received Resolutions of Support from the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska and the Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma in support of his next film, “Standing Bear,” which tells the story of the eponymous Chief’s 1879 trail Standing Bear vs. Crook, where he successfully argued that Native Americans have the right of habeas corpus. Troy co-wrote and is co-directing the film with Academy Award nominee Jim Sheridan\n\n\t“Midnight in the Orange Grove” was shot on-location in southern California and features original artwork from L.A. artist Rachid Bouhamidi. The film was produced by Troy’s company Troy Entertainment, in association with WWPS.tv, Brackish Dream Entertainment, Tyonek Native Corporation and Fast Pass Entertainment. Troy produces alongside Luca Matrundola and Candi Guterres. Turner executive produces alongside Warren Anzalone, Cary Wayne Moore, Pius Savage, and Paul Green.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPaging, Dr. J.D. Dorian. \n\n\tA teaser has been released for the “Scrubs” revival series, featuring Zach Braff returning to Sacred Heart as J.D. 15 years after the original hospital-set comedy ended. Donald Faison and Sarah Chalke — who both appear alongside Braff in the teaser — also reprise their roles as Dr. Christopher Turk and Dr. Elliot Reid, respectively. \n\n\tThe official logline for the “Scrubs” reboot reads, “JD (Braff) & Turk (Faison) scrub in together for the first time in a long time- medicine has changed, interns have changed, but their bromance has stood the test of time. Characters new and old navigate the waters of Sacred Heart with laughter, heart and some surprises along the way.”\n\t\n\n\tNew cast members scrubbing into Sacred Heart include Vanessa Bayer, Joel Kim Booster, Ava Bunn, Jacob Dudman, David Gridley, Layla Mohammadi and Amanda Morrow. Other returning cast members include Robert Maschio, Phill Lewis, Judy Reyes and John C. McGinley. \n\n\n\t“Scrubs” premiered in 2001 on NBC, which aired the series for seven seasons before canceling it. ABC then picked it up for an eighth season. Although Season 8 was intended to conclude the series, the network later greenlit a ninth season, subtitled “Scrubs: Med School,” in which only McGinley and Faison remained as series regulars. Braff appeared in six of the season’s 13 episodes.\n\n\t“Scrubs” alums Tim Hobert and Aseem Batra serve as executive producers and showrunners on the revival of the series. Additional executive producers include Braff, Faison, Chalke, Randall Winston, Bill Lawrence via Doozer, Jeff Ingold and Liza Katzer. 20th Television is the studio. \n\t\n\n\tThe “Scrubs” reboot will debut on Feb. 25 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC. All episodes will be available to stream on Hulu. \n\n\tWatch the full teaser below: \n\n",

    "body": "\n\tLinda Hamilton has been a huge fan of “Stranger Things” since the show premiered on Netflix in 2016, but if it had been completely up to her, she may not be playing one of the main antagonists for the show’s fifth and final season. For one, she told her agent she was retiring. For another, she doesn’t watch her own work, so being on the show means she can’t watch it.\n\n\t“There’s a part of me that would almost rather watch it than be in it,” she says. “So during our script readings, I am watching everything, because I’m never going to get to see it on the screen and to watch it unfold.”\n\t\n\n\tNot much is known yet about Hamilton’s character, other than she’s a military scientist named Dr. Kay. When she spoke with Variety during production in July 2024 — part of the magazine’s Oct. 15 cover story — she was already sporting her wig and costume, for a scene she was about to film involving Millie Bobby Brown’s Eleven. During her break, she talked about why she’d wanted to retire, why she was so relieved when she got to meet Brown and how she almost self-sabotaged her chances of being on the show.\n\n\t\n\t\tSo you’re a big fan of the show?\t\n\n\tI am! \n\t\n\t\tFrom the beginning?\t\n\n\tFrom the beginning, and it never subsided. I know a lot of people that just sort of checked out after Season 2 or 3. I don’t know why, because I just find it mesmerizing.\n\t\n\t\tWhat is it about the show that you’ve loved so much?\t\n\n\tWell, the concept is fantastic, and it does bring back the ’80s, but really, it’s Millie. She is just stunning to watch. I’m just her biggest fan. I really am. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tHad you met her before?\t\n\n\tI had not met her before. And you know, truthfully, I was just hoping she wasn’t a little diva who had somehow become completely soured by all the early success. And I was not disappointed. She was just so lovely. And really good.\n\n\tI loved her, just immediately. Thank God she’s not an asshole, because that would just cripple me. She’s so unspoiled and as talented as I have witnessed. She’s got it, man, that girl has got it. So she invited me to her trailer where I met her family and all the dogs — well, not all of the dogs, apparently they are, like, 10 more that I haven’t met. She’s just open and kind and sweet and all the things that we would like our young leading ladies to be, right? I have worked with some children — not that she’s a child now — who, from the first to the third time I worked with them, just became little assholes. Because this business — if you don’t have your head on straight, and it’s hard to when you’re a child — can really fill you up with the wrong notions of what matters, and she seems to be really grounded in the things that truly matter. I’m just proud of her.\n\t\n\t\tSo what was your reaction when you got the call about being on this season?\t\n\n\tIt’s funny, because I had called my agent maybe a month before and said, “Dude, I gotta retire.” I was heading up to Vancouver to shoot “Resident Alien,” and I was having a really bad hip problem. It just takes so much. The year before, I had made eight trips to Vancouver from New Orleans during that season. It’s just really hard. And I was like, I just can’t tough it out anymore. And of course, my agent was like, “Oh, you don’t mean that.”\n\n\tThen he calls me, and he says “‘Stranger Things’ called and asked if you were available. And I said yes.” So I laughed at that, like, no one takes me seriously at all. He signed me up for a year. \n\t\n\t\tDid you speak with Matt and Ross Duffer?\t\n\n\tI did have to meet with the Duffer brothers on a Zoom call — I really shouldn’t even say this out loud, but it was so much like sabotage. I get the word that I’m gonna meet with them, but it’s not till next Friday. So seven long days go by, and somehow my three o’clock Zoom call became a five o’clock Zoom call in my mind. So I’m ready, but I’m just trying to keep my mind clear and strong, and I take a little rest. I get up at 3:15 to all these texts: “They’re waiting on you. Where are you?” I had completely messed up the time. I mean, what kind of sick self-sabotage is that? \n\t\n\n\tSo I faked it, and said that I that my computer was downloading the new Zoom. I mean, because what do you say? I was a hot mess by the time I met with the Duffer brothers. I haven’t checked my hair. I’m like an insane person stabbing at buttons. They want me to check the toolbar. I don’t even know what a toolbar is. It was a disaster. Then I finally get them, and there’s no audio, and I figure that out, and then I’m like, “So, I hear you’re looking for a scientist.” I was like the farthest thing from a scientist at that moment in time. But they were very pleasant. There are a lot of men who would just say, “Fuck her, we’re not waiting if she can’t be on time.” So it was a bit of a fiasco. But it worked out.\n\t\n\t\tHow does making the show compare to anything else you’ve done?\t\n\n\tIt is beyond vast. I actually have trouble interpreting the schedule for the first time in my career. There’s so many bits and pieces. But I’m on my toes waiting and ready for the whole year. I’m thrilled every time I come. But there is this, like, “Are they going to need me this week or the next week?” The schedules are released in tiny little increments, so you might get a three week understanding of what’s going on, but it is complex. And bully for them for just getting it done. Really, it is just so huge.\n\t\n\t\tHow does the complexity rank against some of the biggest other projects you’ve done? \t\n\n\tThe only other time I’ve had trouble understanding what’s going on — time to retire, Miss Hamilton! — is the last Terminator, [“Terminator: Dark Fate”]. There were so many huge stunts and special effects pieces in that show. They would have to show us a previz of how it’s going to lay out. I had never had had previz before, but it saved our lives, because we’re like, OK, where are we now? It’s like, “We’re in a what? Falling into what? From a what?” \n\t\n\t\tWhat is it like working with the Duffers?\t\n\n\tThey are chill. They are such a well-oiled machine, just the two of them, but then they have this great network around them. I’ve never quite seen camera and grips and people so all about how this is going to work like as a team — a team that has worked together for many years. It’s just wonderful to watch. They’re quiet, they’re thoughtful and fun. I mean, my first day was kind of insane. I just can’t really explain, but I’m wearing a mask, but it was a 1980s mask, so there’s no elastic. You have to tie it and just literally, that entire first scene that was very complex was all about getting the mask down and back up with a wig to make it look realistic. I had a lot to do the first week that I worked, really a significant amount of work, and it all became about this damn mask. We pretty much cut it off and burnt it at the end of the day.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHave you observed how they talk to each other?\t\n\n\tA little bit, because who wouldn’t want to watch the way that they work? They’re just a team. I have a twin.\n\t\n\t\tThis is what I was leading up to.\t\n\n\tYeah, that twinship thing has fired my imagination. What happens when you partner with your twin? Do you read each other’s minds? Can you finish each other’s sentences? Something tells me, although I don’t know them well enough, that they each have the thing that they bring to the other to make each other stronger.\n\t\n\t\tSo what has it been like for you to go from being such a huge fan of the show to getting to be on the inside of it?\t\n\n\tIt kind of steals my joy, because I really like seeing it. There’s a part of me that would almost rather watch it than be in it, because now that I’m in it, I won’t get to see it. I don’t watch my work. I cannot separate myself and my critical inner person from just someone that’s enjoying watching it. And it’s such a feast to watch this show. So during our script readings, I am watching everything, because I’m never going to get to see it on the screen and to watch it unfold. \n\n\tTo build it is great. I’m as happy as I’ve ever been, just so happy to be part of it. Support. I don’t care. But it is quite different. I mean, it’s not that I imagined it would be different, yeah, because it’s obviously huge. And you know, you come in knowing that that’s the game, and you’re only just a very small player. Actually, the first week, I thought, we can’t be doing this whole scene. It was a huge scene. It was like, they can’t be starting with that, can they? It’s like, stunts and special effects and this and that and it’s so vast — I just keep using that word, but it is. \n\n\tAnd then I realized that pretty much every scene that they do is vast. It’s vast to me, yeah, but to them, it’s what they do every day. There is a definite part of me that was a little intimidated to come in to a show that already has a certain rhythm and a momentum and all kinds of a history that I didn’t share. And to walk in and just feel like you’re the big pretender really coming in.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

County Medical Examiner insists Celeste's body was partially frozen when it was discovered inside a car registered to singer D4vd. This is in square contradiction to what LAPD is saying on the record.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          It's interesting ... in one document from the Medical Examiner, it reads, \"The decedent was not live scanned due to waterlogged fingers.\" Translation ... the M.E. was unable to fingerprint Celeste's body.\n      \n\n          The Medical Examiner has put a security hold on the case ... as the LAPD continues to investigate. TMZ broke the story -- although the M.E. has not determined a cause of death, the LAPD is viewing the case as a homicide, and D4vd is a suspect. We're told there is a second suspect as well -- someone who helped in the dismemberment of the body.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As we reported, our sources say the M.E. may not be able to determine cause or manner of death because of the state the body was in when it was discovered.\n      \n    \n          LAPD sources tell TMZ, the relationship between the Medical Examiner and the LAPD has been strained over the last few years.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Celeste Rivas\n              \n                          \n                D4vd\n              \n                          \n                D4vd Tesla Case\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                          \n                True Crime\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tSandra Bernhard has checked into “The White Lotus” Season 4.\n\n\tThe “Severance” and “Marty Supreme” actor joins previously announced cast members Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Coogan, Caleb Jonte Edwards, Marissa Long, Alexander Ludwig, Chris Messina and AJ Michalka in the France-set installment of the HBO vacation dramedy. \n\n\tDetails on Bernard’s role are unclear. Additional casting has yet to be announced as creator Mike White rounds out his Season 4 ensemble.\n\t\n\n\tAs Variety exclusively reported in January, “The White Lotus” Season 4 will shoot primarily at a 19th-century palace-turned-luxury hotel called the Château de La Messardière in Saint-Tropez on the Côte d’Azur. (This marks the first season to be housed at a non-Four Seasons resort.) Sources tell Variety the story will also unfold along the French Riviera and in Paris, with the possibility of Cannes Film Festival being factored into the plot.\n\n\n\tWhite executive produces “The White Lotus” alongside David Bernad and Mark Kamine. The series, which has previously taken place in Hawaii, Italy and Thailand, is an awards magnet, winning 16 Emmys and nabbing 66 nominations.\n\n\tWith more than 100 acting credits under her belt, Bernhard is best known for her film roles in “The King of Comedy,” “Hudson Hawk” and “Without You I’m Nothing.” She also starred as Nancy Bartlett Thomas on the ABC sitcom “Roseanne” and played Nurse Judy Kubrak in Ryan Murphy’s FX series “Pose.” Her recent credits include the Timothée Chalamet Oscar vehicle “Marty Supreme” and Apple TV’s “Severance,” in which she played a menacing scientist in the final episodes of Season 2.\n\t\n\n\tDeadline reported the news first.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrom the stage back to the screen, Hawkins is getting the pro-shot treatment.\n\n\tNetflix is filming the Broadway production of “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” this week for a future streaming release. The filming brings the theatrical chapter of the “Stranger Things” universe to streaming audiences and captures the show’s original Broadway company in its current form.\n\n\tTo accommodate the shoot, producers Netflix and Sonia Friedman Productions canceled performances from Feb. 10 through Feb. 14. The play will resume its regular performance schedule on Feb. 15. No release window has been set for the filmed version.\n\t\n\n\tThe Broadway cast is led by Tony nominee Louis McCartney, who stars as Henry Creel after originating the role in London’s West End. A new ensemble will take over the production in late March, with Victor de Paula Rocha stepping into the role of Henry Creel alongside Ayana Cymone as Patty Newby, Shea Grant as Joyce Maldonado, Juan Carlos as Bob Newby and Matthew Erick White as James Hopper Jr.\n\n\n\t“Stranger Things: The First Shadow” opened on Broadway April 22, 2025, at the Marquis Theatre, following its West End debut in December 2023. The production has seen a significant boost in interest following the release of Netflix’s final season of “Stranger Things,” becoming one of Broadway’s top weekly earners and recently posting grosses of about $1.4 million.\n\n\tWritten by Kate Trefry and based on an original story by the Duffer Brothers, Jack Thorne and Trefry, the play functions as a standalone prequel rooted in the mythology of the hit series. Set in 1959 Hawkins, Ind., the story centers on teenage Henry Creel as his family relocates in search of a fresh start. As unsettling events ripple through the town, Henry begins to grapple with the frightening possibility that he may be connected to the darkness taking hold.\n\t\n\n\tThe production explores the early lives of characters familiar to fans of the series, while laying groundwork that connects directly to the events of the television show, including its fifth and final season.\n\n\tDirected by Stephen Daldry and co-directed by Justin Martin, the play features a cast of 34 and expansive stagecraft that blends practical effects with cinematic storytelling. The Duffer Brothers serve as creative producers, with Shawn Levy’s 21 Laps Entertainment acting as associate producer.\n\n\tNetflix previously documented the making of the stage production in “Behind the Curtain: Stranger Things: The First Shadow,” released in April 2025.\n\n\tWith cameras now rolling inside the Marquis Theatre, the Broadway chapter of “Stranger Things” is poised to live on long after the lights dim — offering fans a front-row seat to the Upside Down, no Playbill required.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBad Bunny‘s Super Bowl halftime show — or the “Benito Bowl,” as it was affectionally named by his fans — reached an average of 128.2 million viewers on Sunday.\n\n\tMeasured by Nielsen, that’s above the 124.9 million average viewers achieved by this year’s Super Bowl overall but down from the 133.5 million viewers achieved by Kendrick Lamar, who set the record last year. Before Lamar, the record was held by Usher for his 2024 performance.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to Ripple Analytics, total social consumption of the halftime show — including fans, owned platforms, broadcast partners and influencers — hit four billion views after 24 hours (up 137% from last year).\n\n\n\tAlso, the NFL’s top three most-viewed social posts of all time now come from the Bad Bunny halftime show: “Only Thing More Powerful Than Hate Is Love” (179 million views on Instagram, most viewed clip on NFL social ever); Bad Bunny listing the countries of the Americas before spiking the football at the end of his performance (168 million views on Instagram) and that same clip on TikTok (100 million views).\n\n\tAccording to Apple Music, listens of Bad Bunny music was up seven times following the halftime show, led by “DtMF,” “BAILE INoLVIDABLE,” and “Tití Me Preguntó.” \n\n\tAccording to the NFL, more than half of its social views came from international markets; with full global viewership for the “Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show” available early next week, that U.S.-only number of 124.9 million viewers could go up dramatically once worldwide data is in.\n\n\tThe halftime show began making headlines months before the big game was even played, both because of Bad Bunny’s status as one of the world’s most popular recording artists in the world right now and because of complaints from right-wing commentators about his penchant for centering his Puerto Rican heritage in his work. Turning Point USA, the conservative group co-founded by the late Charlie Kirk, produced its own alternative halftime show “for folks who love America,” per headliner Kid Rock. Ultimately, TPUSA was unable to compete: the New York Times reported that the YouTube livestream peaked with 6.1 million viewers during the show, and it has since reached 21 million viewers — compared to Bad Bunny’s massive viewership on Sunday and 57 million YouTube views.\n\t\n\n\tHighlights from Bad Bunny’s performance included a real wedding, several stunts, appearances from Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, 380 people dressed like grass and more. Read Variety‘s interview breaking down the biggest moments with the halftime show’s producers here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMattel, Inc, in agreement with its joint venture partner NetEase, has announced it will acquire full ownership of the Mattel163 mobile games studio. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of Q1. \n\n\tFounded in 2018, Mattel163, a global game studio, has developed games based on iconic Mattel brands including Uno!, Uno Wonder, Phase 10 and Skip Bo. The game developer has over 550 million downloads worldwide and approximately 20 million monthly active users. \n\t\n\n\tThe transaction values Mattel163 at $318 million, with a purchase price of $159 million for NetEase’s 50% interest. More than half of the purchase cost is expected to be funded from Mattel’s share of the JV’s cash, which is not consolidated on Mattel’s balance sheet. \n\n\n\t“Our vision is to extend physical play to the virtual world by creating digital experiences and games based on Mattel IP that drive sustained engagement for fans of all ages. Acquiring full control of Mattel163 does exactly that,” Mattel chairman and CEO Ynon Krei said. “It will play an important role in our digital strategy and significantly enhance our capabilities in self-publishing. The Mattel163 team has done remarkably well building this business from the ground up and we look forward to welcoming them on board. Our portfolio of iconic brands lends itself perfectly to the digital world and the acquisition will strengthen our position and accelerate our presence in a large, high-growth market.”\n\n\tThe acquisition comes as Mattel focuses on capturing the full value of its IP across entertainment verticals. Mattel163’s capabilities will allow Mattel to increase its mobile games output, enhancing alignment with the broader Mattel product roadmap.\n\t\n\n\tSee more gaming news from this week in the roundup below.\n\t\n\t\tPARTNERSHIPS\t\n\n\tSEGA is expanding its real-world footprint with a new strategic partnership that places the iconic gaming publisher at the center of L.A. LIVE, downtown Los Angeles’ massive sports and entertainment district.\n\n\tUnder the agreement, SEGA becomes an official partner of L.A. LIVE, securing a campus-wide presence across the 4-million-square-foot complex that hosts everything from NBA games and esports-adjacent events to major awards shows, concerts and film premieres. The deal goes beyond traditional sponsorship, positioning SEGA within the flow of high-profile live events that draw global audiences year-round.\n\n\tThe partnership includes prominent placement across L.A. LIVE’s district-wide digital out-of-home network, featuring 11 large-format LED displays spread across high-traffic areas such as Peacock Place, key pedestrian corridors and major entry points near Crypto.com Arena, the Los Angeles Convention Center and the JW Marriott. SEGA will also extend its visibility through freeway-facing digital signage surrounding the campus.\n\n\tIn addition to media placement, the agreement opens the door for immersive, on-site activations, including experiential installations at Peacock Place, the district’s 40,000-square-foot open-air plaza. SEGA will also be integrated into L.A. LIVE’s website and social media channels, tying the brand directly to ongoing event promotion throughout the year.\n\n\tSEGA of America EVP of Publishing Ryan Okum said the partnership reflects the growing overlap between gaming, sports and live entertainment, allowing SEGA’s franchises to appear in spaces where large, highly engaged audiences already gather.\n\n\tThe deal was brokered by AEG Global Partnerships and aligns with SEGA’s broader push into experiential marketing and transmedia expansion, as the publisher continues to grow its presence beyond traditional game launches through film, television and live experiences tied to franchises such as “Sonic the Hedgehog,” “Like a Dragon,” “Persona” and “Total War.”\n\n\tFor gaming fans in Los Angeles — and visitors passing through one of the country’s busiest entertainment hubs — SEGA is about to become much harder to miss.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wuthering Heights” duo Margot Robbie and Charli xcx joined forces for Complex’s latest “GOAT Talk” video interview, where Robbie revealed that a male co-star once gave her a book advising her to lose weight. Robbie, who stars in and produces “Wuthering Heights,” remembered the insulting encounter when asked to name the worst gift she’s ever received.\n\n\t“Very, very early in my career, an actor I worked with, a male actor, gave me a book called ‘Why French Women Don’t Get Fat,’ and it was essentially a book telling you to eat less,” Robbie said, much to Charli’s shock. “I was like, ‘Woah, fuck you, dude.’”\n\t\n\n\tWhen Charli asked if this male co-star was still working today, Robbie answered: “That was a very [long time ago]. I have no idea where he would even be now. This was really back in the day… He essentially gave me a book to let me know that I should lose weight. I was like, ‘Wow.’”\n\n\n\tRobbie is playing Catherine Earnshaw opposite Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff in “Wuthering Heights,” directed by “Promising Young Woman” and “Saltburn” filmmaker Emerald Fennell. The movie’s marketing, powered by Charli’s original songs, has been erotically charged, but Robbie recently told British Vogue the actual film will be something different.\n\n\t“Everyone’s expecting this to be very, very raunchy. I think people will be surprised. Not to say there aren’t sexual elements and that it’s not provocative – it definitely is provocative – but it’s more romantic than provocative,” Robbie told worried readers. “This is a big epic romance. It’s just been so long since we’ve had one – maybe ‘The Notebook,’ also ‘The English Patient.’ You have to go back decades. It’s that feeling when your chest swells or it’s like someone’s punched you in the guts and the air leaves your body. That’s a signature of Emerald’s. Whether it’s titillating or repulsion, her superpower is eliciting a physical response.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch Robbie and Charli’s full “GOAT Talk” interview for Complex in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn Sunday night, many Puerto Ricans in the territory’s Deaf community gathered at the Eco’s Sports Park in San Juan. The friends, family members and interpreters were tuning into Super Bowl LX, just like millions of people across the country. However, there was one key distinction. They were eagerly anticipating the appearance of not one, but two homegrown entertainers — Bad Bunny and one of their own, a partially-deaf performer named Celimar Rivera Cosme.\n\t\n\n\tHailing from the lush mountains of Naranjito, Rivera Cosme made history as the first Puerto Rican Sign Language performer in the Super Bowl’s 60-year run. In years past, American Sign Language performers have taken to the world’s biggest stage, accompanying half-time show headliners and interpreting for deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers. This year, however, the NFL chose to recruit another local for the big game’s first Spanish-language halftime show.\n\n\n\tRivera Cosme is no stranger to Bad Bunny’s music. She previously interpreted for the singer during his 2022 tour, “El Último Tour Del Mundo,” and a 31-show residency in San Juan last year, which drew over 600,000 attendees and generated up to $250 million for Puerto Rico’s economy.\n\n\n\tBy using LSPR (Puerto Rican Sign Language), deaf fans could experience the nuance and countless cultural references of Bad Bunny’s hits. LSPR was derived from American Sign Language when it was first developed in the early 1900s, but it features island-specific vernacular, pacing differences and other elements that make it distinctive to Puerto Rico. A 2022 CDC report estimated that 7% of Puerto Rican residents experience deafness or hardness of hearing, which is approximately 220,000 of the island’s population of 3.2 million. Experts, however, consider LSPR an endangered language, slowly being replaced by ASL.\n\t\n\n\tWhile the standard NBC programming didn’t show Rivera Cosme, viewers could tune into a special broadcast available online, where she and Bad Bunny performed simultaneously on a split-screen. One of Levi’s Stadium’s six screens was dedicated to Rivera Cosme, and the performer says those in her section cheered her on enthusiastically.\n\n\n\tWith the help of interpreter Joel Omar, Rivera Cosme spoke with Variety about preparing for the halftime show and what the performance meant to Puerto Rico and its Deaf community.\n\n\tHow did you get your start as a professional interpreter? Have you always wanted to work in entertainment?\n\n\tBefore I started interpreting, I wanted to be a nurse. At the time, nobody knew that I had the right to an interpreter, and so they told me I couldn’t study nursing because I’m deaf. So I said, “Okay, no problem.” I went to Universidad del Turabo (now Universidad Ana G. Méndez) in Puerto Rico and graduated in 2015 with my Bachelor’s degree in sign language interpretations. Everything happens for a reason. Thanks to that opportunity, I had many doors open to me. But to perform in the Super Bowl was never a goal for me. I never thought about [performing] outside Puerto Rico.\n\n\tCould you explain how Puerto Rican Sign Language is different from ASL?\n\n\tWe have a lot of ASL influence because Puerto Rico is part of the United States, but Puerto Rico has a lot of signs of the [local] language. The Spanish speakers in the north and south have different slang, and the regions speak differently naturally. ASL uses more spelling, but in LSPR we have more signs, more facial expressions and body expressions, more than just spelling words.\n\n\tYou’ve previously worked with Bad Bunny, interpreting for him during his 2022 world tour and his residency in San Juan. How did you two first meet and start working together?\n\n\tI was very close to [Bad Bunny in physical proximity], but I never met him, and I never said “hi” to him. During the residency, I was the interpreter, but I didn’t have any interaction with him. But at the Super Bowl, I met him, and he recognized me. The [Deaf] community had started seeing Bad Bunny [rise to fame], and they wanted to go to the concert. We asked the managers of El Choli (the residency venue) for interpreter accommodation, and they DM’ed me asking if I was able to interpret, and I accepted. We fought very hard to have an interpreter at that concert, step by step. Now we have more accessibility and more interpreters at the concerts.\n\t\n\n\tHow were you first approached about the halftime show? \n\n\tI first received an email directly from the NFL in November, not Bad Bunny’s manager. They emailed me saying that the Deaf community had [referred] my name for the performance. I auditioned and sent in videos performing to music from Bad Bunny three times, and they chose me.\n\n\tHow important was it to have a Puerto Rican Sign Language interpreter for the Super Bowl performance? Are there references in his music that someone who isn’t Puerto Rican might’ve missed?\n\n\tDefinitely had to be a Puerto Rican. Bad Bunny [speaks] the Spanish of Puerto Rico; he has a lot of lines about culture, identity, slang, and vocabulary. A person who is not Puerto Rican will not understand the background of the extra linguistic words or the expressions that come from Puerto Rican culture. For example, in “Tití Me Preguntó,” when signing for the word “Aunt,” the sign for “Tití” and “Tia” is not the same. (While both words mean “Aunt” in Spanish, “Tití” is a specifically Puerto Rican term.) Many signs are different, and the slang too.\n\n\tWhere were you performing during the show?\n\n\tI was very close to the field, like in the first row. Last year, [the deaf performers] were very far. But this year we got the first row, and we saw everything. It was amazing.\n\n\tWhat was the energy inside the stadium like? \n\n\tBefore the Super Bowl started, it was empty, and I was like, “Wow, it’s big.” But with people? Oh my God. Many people were screaming; there was a very competitive energy. That vibe is different, and it’s positive energy too.\n\n\tHow did it feel to see Puerto Rico and LSPR represented on that level?\n\n\tIt’s great because it’s an opportunity for the Deaf community in Puerto Rico to get exposure. We are a small island, but we fight very hard to be on a bigger stage and in an opportunity where we can be visible.\n\n\tWhat were the daily Super Bowl rehearsals like? How long had you been practicing for the show?\n\n\tThe week [leading up to the Super Bowl] was rehearsals every day, over eight hours practicing. And back home, since November, when I got chosen, it was Bad Bunny’s music playing all the time.\n\n\tThe halftime show was such an intricate performance. Was there a part of the set that was your favorite? \n\t\n\n\tMy favorite song is “Café con Ron,” because it’s more about the country and the mountains I am from in Naranjito.\n\n\tWas there a specific song or lyric that is more difficult to interpret? \n\n\tFor the Super Bowl, they chose easier songs. If he chose his old songs where he used trap, it would be harder.\n\n\tDid anyone back home send videos of them watching your performance? \n\n\tI have a lot of DMs still [to go through]! I haven’t read all of them yet.\n\n\tASL interpreter Julian Ortiz, who signed “America the Beautiful” this year, joined you for parts of your performance. Was that pre-planned or was it just to celebrate together?\n\n\tI decided to perform with Julian because he wasn’t born in Puerto Rico, but his parents were. So he feels proud of Puerto Rico. He feels proud of our culture. If I shine, he will shine too. That’s important for me to work as a team. I taught him some Puerto Rican Sign Language, and it was beautiful to work with him.\n\n\tEveryone is talking about the end of the performance where Bad Bunny named every country in America and, of course, shouted out Puerto Rico. What do you hope viewers take away from the performance?\n\n\tWe practiced that, so we knew which countries he would call out during the Super Bowl halftime, and we felt that all Latinos would be proud.\n\n\tWere you able to join in on the dancing at the end?\n\n\tI was dancing from start to end! But I was in the stands. I watched the game, of course, and enjoyed it. [My team] lost, but that’s of no matter.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tBlumhouse continues its push into gaming with the Tuesday release of new first-person shooter “Crisol: Theater of the Idols.”\n\n\tDeveloped by Vermila Studios, the AA title, which is available across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S and PC via Steam, is described as a “horror adventure where folklore and religion intertwine in a nightmarish version of Spain.” \n\n\tThroughout the game, players must sacrifice their own blood to use as ammunition against terrifying statues of saints that come to life in order to survive while unraveling the mystery of the cursed island of Tormentosa. But, as one might expect, using too much blood leads to your death.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I’ve been going to many, many events worldwide and I’ve seen more than 1,000 people play,” Vermila Studios co-founder and CEO David Carrasco told Variety. “So one big mistake they make is, ‘Oh, I play a lot of first-person shooters. I’ll go right in, I’ll get close to the enemies, and I’ll shoot them, and I’ll blow their heads off, and things will be great.’ I will recommend you take every enemy encounter with some strategy, give them some room, some distance. Aim for the head — but not only the head, maybe some of the limbs could be a little more useful for you, because, as they are made of wood and many other materials, they are not detained or stopped by you blowing their heads off.”\n\n\n\tCarrasco suggests players “approach every enemy encounter strategically and don’t go crazy to kill them, take some distance and think twice before facing the enemies.” “Give them some air,” he said. “See how they behave. Walk slowly back and think about the blood you have and how you’re going to use it. Always keep blood in mind.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhile “Crisol: Theater of Idols” just launched, its place within the Blumhouse brand automatically makes it a title ripe for a potential TV series or film adaptation. Carrasco is very open to the idea of more, and planned “Crisol” as a larger universe, but says it will all depend on sales and fan response.\n\n\t“It’s super early. Of course, lots of things come from success and especially now with a super tough gaming industry outlook,” Carrasco said. “But we do have more ideas and of course, ‘Crisol’ was created as a universe, which means we can expand it in games and other multimedia assets like comics, books, or TV shows, movies, whatever it is that digs a little deeper into Hispania, Tormentosa, Gabrielle, or any of the other characters that we’ve known in the game or that we may know exist in that universe. So for us, yes, if we are successful enough to be able to get there at some point.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothée Chalamet recently reunited with his “Interstellar” director Christopher Nolan at the AMC Universal Citywalk in Los Angeles to screen the film in Imax 70mm. In a video shared by the Nolan Archives, the “Marty Supreme” Oscar nominee interviewed Nolan ahead of the screening and declared “Interstellar” his personal favorite among his own films.\n\n\t“Though my role is not enormous in ‘Interstellar,’ I think I was number 12 on the call sheet, this film came to me at a time in life, in my career, where things were certainly not set yet,” Chalamet told the audience. “And it’s remained my favorite project I’ve ever been in. It’s the film I’ve seen the most of, of all the films ever made in human history.”\n\t\n\n\tChalamet has previously admitted he “wept for an hour” after watching “Interstellar” for the first time and discovering his role as Tom, the teenage son of Matthew McConaughey’s Cooper, had been drastically cut down. He told Nolan ahead of the screening that his expectations for his role were distorted from the beginning.\n\n\n\t“This was a script [Nolan’s brother Jonathan] wrote for Steven Spielberg,” Chalamet reminded the audience. “When I got the part, I googled the project. The original story was about a father and his son, so I thought, ‘Oh man, I made it!’ And then obviously they reworked it and young Tom was a smaller part, but that’s okay.”\n\n\tNolan interjected, “Never believe what you read online!”\n\n\tAs Chalamet and the audience laughed, Nolan explained how “the genesis” of “Interstellar” started as a pitch from physicist Kip Thorne to Spielberg about “doing a science fiction movie about looking out into the greater universe with real science behind it.”\n\t\n\n\t“Right after we collaborated on ‘Dark Knight,’ my brother got the job and went to work with Steven. I get to call him Steven. He’s Mr. Spielberg to you,” Nolan told Chalamet. “He worked on it for a lot of years. It had incredible ideas and moved through all these different iterations, but until Steven was ready to make it, whatever it is, it never quite got that momentum. Steven went off to do another film, so it became available.”\n\n\tNolan continued, “I had a lot of conversations with Jonathan over the years and what he was doing and what his ambition was. I was excited by it. I was incredibly struck by his first act. I had been working on a time travel idea… things looking at time. I had half-baked projects that I hadn’t committed to. When it became available, it was a case of me saying to Jonathan, ‘How would you feel if I took this and tried to combine it with some of my ideas and change a bit with what it was?’ He was fine with it. He could tell the spirit of what I was trying to do was to get to what he was initially excited about it.”\n\n\t“Interstellar” opened in theaters in November 2014 and grossed $681 million worldwide during its initial run and scored five Oscar nominations, winning for best visual effects. But reviews for the movie were far more mixed compared to the praise Nolan had received for his “Dark Knight” movies and “Inception.” \n\n\t“You’re trying to be polite. The film was received in a slightly ambiguous way,” Nolan told Chalamet as the actor tried to broach the topic of “Interstellar’s” rocky initial reception. “It was a little bit sniffy. Some of the responses were a bit sniffy from critics and a little from audiences. It made very good money around the world, particularly. There was a sense of people not quite being… it sounds egotistical to say they weren’t ready… but they weren’t ready for it from me.”\n\n\t“I had some producer anonymously say of me, ‘He is a cold guy who makes cold films.’ Then it sort of stuck on me for several projects,” the director continued. “The reason I was attracted to my brother’s first act is because it’s about family and humanity, and it’s deeply emotional. That’s the film I wanted to make. It’s a film that wears its heart on its sleeve.”\n\n\tChalamet told Nolan that “it kills me you didn’t feel that love right away,” adding: “This movie makes me weep more than anything.”\n\t\n\n\t“When you make a film on that scale… every screening we did as we were finishing the film, there would be somebody who would be in tears and deeply moved by it. That’s enough,” Nolan said. “You can’t also ask the culture to immediately embrace something. It’s asking too much in a way. If you talk to individuals who’ve connected with the film in a really profound way, then you know it’s there. You’ve done your job. The rest is about the zeitgeist and where you fit in with it.”\n\n\tNolan said that it was “an incredible relief and a humbling thing” when “Interstellar” proved a hit at the box office, even with mixed reviews. But “the project seems to touch people more and more year after year and sort of grows,” he noted.\n\n\t“For years, people would recognize me somewhere and talk about ‘Dark Knight,'” Nolan explained. “But over the last 10 years it’s become ‘Interstellar.’ It’s a wonderful thing. We re-released it two years ago and it made $5 million. It’s amazing the success it’s had. It’s incredibly rewarding. One of the strange things about directing is you immerse yourself in an obsessive way with a project. The worst response you ever get is when people say, ‘Meh, it’s okay. It’s fine.’ You’d almost rather they felt something, either they passionately dislike it or passionately, obsessively fall in love with it.”\n\n\tRegardless of the initial mixed reviews, nearly everyone could agree that a highlight of “Interstellar” was the scene in which Cooper watches years of messages from his kids as they grow up. Chalamet recorded scenes for the sequence.\n\n\t“When you were filming the messages from home, there was a particular thing where you were hitting a dark tone,” Nolan remembered. “It felt too much for me. I didn’t particularly like it. I told you about it and you went ahead and did whatever the fuck you wanted and carried on. But I was like, ‘He knows what he wants to do and has an idea.’ It wasn’t about being stubborn. You had planned what you wanted to do. You planned your choices and you didn’t want to abandon that on a casual whim for me. You wanted to test that and challenge that and see if I kept coming back, which I didn’t. I’ll find a logic to that in the edit suite.”\n\n\tWatch Chalamet and Nolan’s full “Interstellar” reunion conversation in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNBC‘s, Peacock’s and Telemundo’s simulcast of the Super Bowl LX matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots reached an average 124.9 million viewers on Sunday night. \n\n\tThe number of viewers watching a fairly mild Super Bowl saw Seattle defeat New England 29-13 and win its second-ever Super Bowl. That marks a slight decrease from last year’s game, when the Philadelphia Eagles’ victory over the Kansas City Chiefs achieved the biggest television audience of all time with 127.7 million average viewers on Fox.\n\t\n\n\tBut NBC reported that viewership peaked during the second quarter of the game (7:45 p.m. to 8 p.m. ET) with an average of 137.8 million viewers — making it the highest peak viewership in U.S. TV history. It also repped the most-watched TV broadcast in the history of NBCUniversal.\n\n\n\tThe 124.9 million viewer stat comes from the live+same day Nielsen Big Data+Panel stat, which included NBC, Peacock, Telemundo, NBC Sports Digital and NFL+. That makes it the second-most watched program in U.S. TV history, behind only last year’s Super Bowl LIX on Fox.\n\n\tMeasured by Nielsen, these statistics represent the average number of people who were tuned in at any given moment during each game, though the totals naturally fluctuate throughout the telecasts. The Super Bowl LX aired from 6:40 p.m. to 10:28 p.m. ET.\n\n\tBad Bunny’s halftime performance was an audience grabber of its own, reaching an average of 128.2 million viewers — down from Kendrick Lamar’s record of 133.5 million viewers during last year’s game, but still a tremendous stat.\n\t\n\n\tAs for Telemundo, the broadcast averaged 3.3 million viewers — which made it the most-watched Super Bowl in U.S. Spanish-language TV history. The telecast peaked with 4.8 million viewers during the Bad Bunny halftime show.\n\n\tNBC opted to stick with the Winter Olympics after the Super Bowl, and “Primetime in Milan” and “Milan Prime” averaged 42 million viewers according to the network. That’s the best Winter Games audience for NBC since Day 2 of the 2014 Sochi Olympics and up 73% vs. the post-Super Bowl LVI Beijing Olympics show (24.3 million) in 2022.\n\n\t“The Super Bowl and the NFL once again delivered a blockbuster audience across the NBC broadcast network, Peacock, and Telemundo, and provided an unprecedented lead-in to our Primetime in Milan coverage,” said NBC Sports prexy Rick Cordella in a statement. “The Super Bowl and the Olympics are the two most powerful events in the world, and we salute our talented production, tech, and announce teams who delivered best-in-class presentations for our viewers, stations, and partners.”\n\n\tHere is a look at Super Bowl viewership since 2010, when the big game attracted more than 100 million viewers for the first time:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSOURCE: Nielsen. Super Bowl LX in 2026 was the first Super Bowl reported using Nielsen’s Big Data + Panel methodology. All prior reporting used Nielsen’s Panel-Only measurement. The first Super Bowl to include Out-of-Home (OOH) viewing was SB LV. Nielsen began including OOH viewing into its National TV measurement in September 2020. As of Feb. 2025, Nielsen’s OOH measurement covers 100% of the U.S. contiguous television population. Super Bowl XLVIII included the first Spanish-language broadcast for a Super Bowl.\n\t\n\n\n",

Blink49 Studios cut ties with Jill Tuesday following her posting -- then deleting -- an Instagram video Sunday, criticizing Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Halftime Show. The comments, later reposted on X, sparked backlash and ultimately led to her firing from the show.\n      \n    \n      \n      Jill Zarin’s review of Bad Bunny’s #SuperBowl Halftime Show… 🥴 pic.twitter.com/XH8f0HjQpI— Gibson Johns (@gibsonoma) February 9, 2026\n              @gibsonoma\n          \n  \n    \n          Sources familiar with the situation tell TMZ ... Jill believes she was punished for expressing an opinion, while other Housewives have said or done far worse without facing similar consequences. People close to Jill have told us they strongly dispute accusations that her comments were insensitive, insisting anyone who personally knows her would say that characterization is unfair.\n      \n\n          According to our sources, Jill feels her firing is very premature and is especially hurt because she was the driving force behind reuniting the original 'RHONY' women and helping get the show greenlit at E!, only to feel pushed aside once controversy erupted.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Those who've spoken with Jill since the firing say she's confused by what she views as cancel culture, explaining she quickly deleted the post after realizing she misspoke. After rewatching the performance, she better understood its cultural importance and felt terrible ... which is why the video came down so fast.\n      \n    \n          We're told Jill is upset people interpreted her remarks as targeting a broader group, and sources call the situation unfortunate. We're told she doesn't need the show financially and only signed on to have fun and bring the OG women back together.\n      \n    \n          Another source close to Jill says she's bummed producers didn't use the teachable moment as an opportunity on the show, suggesting the women could've addressed the matter on camera with her.\n      \n    \n          We've reached out to reps for Jill ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jill Zarin\n              \n                          \n                Bad Bunny\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Super Bowl\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

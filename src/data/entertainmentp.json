    "body": "\n\tCheryl Hines has criticized her interview earlier this month on “The View,” saying the hosts “just wanted to grill me” about her husband, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is currently serving as the U.S. secretary of health and human services.\n\n\tHines, an actor and comedian best known for her role on Larry David’s HBO sitcom “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” appeared on the ABC talk show Oct. 14 to promote her upcoming memoir “Unscripted.” Though the book documents Hines’ newfound involvement in politics alongside RFK Jr. as he mounted a presidential campaign in 2024, “The View” hosts focused their questions on her husband’s current policies and relationship with President Donald Trump.\n\t\n\n\tOn Billy Bush’s “Hot Mics” show on Tuesday, Hines said that she wishes the questions were more “personal.”\n\n\n\t“You know, I was actually hoping that it was going to be more personal on ‘The View,’ but it was what it was. They just wanted to grill me about Bobby,” she said. “I mean, I don’t think the ladies on ‘The View’ asked me one question about my book. But, you know, that’s OK.” \n\n\n\tDuring Hines’ “View” interview, hosts Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg acknowledged that “it’s not fair” to put her “on the spot” about RFK Jr. and it’s not her “fight to be having,” but questioned her about his views on vaccines and qualifications for the health and human services role.\n\n\tThe conversation turned particularly tense when Sunny Hostin asserted that RFK Jr. has “spread a lot of misinformation, a lot of chaos, a lot of confusion,” pointing out once Hines began to reply that “he’s connecting circumcisions to autism.” Hines interjected, “May I? May I finish?” before claiming that when Anthony Fauci was “saying when you get the vaccine, you cannot transmit COVID, it will stop COVID, that was disinformation.”\n\t\n\n\tBehar cut the tension by asking Hines if RFK Jr. really has a brain worm, to which Hines joked: “It ate just a little bit of his brain and died, so don’t worry!”\n\n\tAt the end of the interview, Goldberg stressed the importance of welcoming others onto the show who have different viewpoints, asking Hines to come back. “We don’t often get people on this show who we can ask these questions to, and I appreciate that you came on,” Goldberg said. “Because you know what, if we can have the discussion back and forth, it then becomes people’s — then they can decide what they believe, and they don’t just hear one side.”\n\n\tDespite Hines’ comments on Bush’s “Hot Mics,” a rep for the actor told Entertainment Weekly that she still considers “the appearance a success.”\n\n\t“Cheryl engaged with respect and class, in light of them asking her repeatedly to defend her husband, which by the way was not the purpose of her appearance, it was to discuss her new memoir ‘Unscripted,'” the rep told EW. “She was completely unbothered, as one would have to be living in a cave to think they wouldn’t make Bobby the primary focus.”\n\n\tA representative for “The View” did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount Skydance, aiming to get leaner and meaner, today is laying off about 1,000 employees, mostly in the U.S. David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount, sent employees a memo about the companywide cuts, saying “these steps are necessary to position Paramount for long-term success.”\n\n\t“We want to be as open and direct as possible about the reasons behind these changes,” Ellison wrote in the email, a copy of which was obtained by Variety. “In some areas, we are addressing redundancies that have emerged across the organization. In others, we are phasing out roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities and the new structure designed to strengthen our focus on growth. Ultimately, these steps are necessary to position Paramount for long-term success.”\n\t\n\n\tThe layoffs will cut across Paramount’s divisions, including TV, film, streaming and corporate departments. Following Wednesday’s pink-slips, an additional wave of job eliminations is expected to follow, with the target of axing around 2,000 jobs in the U.S. and overseas. All told, the layoffs will reduce the company’s workforce by about 10%.\n\n\n\tEllison and president Jeff Shell signaled their plans to reduce Paramount’s headcount well before Skydance’s takeover of the company was done, as part of their plan to cut upwards of $2 billion in costs.\n\n\t“When we launched the new Paramount in August, we made clear that building a strong, future-focused company would require significant change – including restructuring the organization,” Ellison said in the Oct. 29 memo.\n\n\tAt the end of 2024, Paramount reported having about 18,600 full- and part-time employees in 32 countries worldwide. (Two years earlier, Paramount’s headcount was 24,500.) Prior to the closing of the Skydance deal Aug. 7, Paramount made additional layoffs, including a 3.5% reduction of its domestic staff in June.\n\t\n\n\tEven with the staff reductions, Ellison has been spending big on content deals since closing the deal forming Paramount Skydance. That has included inking a deal with the UFC worth $7.7 billion over seven years and acquiring Bari Weiss’ The Free Press for a reported $150 million.\n\n\tIn addition, Ellison and his financial partners have been pursuing a megadeal to buy Warner Bros. Discovery and merge it with Paramount Skydance — a combination that would lead to even more job cuts. After rejecting Ellison’s $23.50/share offer for the company in its entirety, the board of WBD has initiated a formal M&A review process to evaluate bids from “multiple parties.”\n\n\tRead Ellison’s memo to Paramount employees about the job cuts:\n\n\tDear All,\n\n\tWhen we launched the new Paramount in August, we made clear that building a strong, future-focused company would require significant change – including restructuring the organization. As part of that process, we must also reduce the size of our workforce, and we recognize these actions affect our most important asset: our people.\n\n\tWe want to be as open and direct as possible about the reasons behind these changes. In some areas, we are addressing redundancies that have emerged across the organization. In others, we are phasing out roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities and the new structure designed to strengthen our focus on growth. Ultimately, these steps are necessary to position Paramount for long-term success.\n\n\tThat said, today we begin the difficult process of informing impacted team members across the company. These decisions are never made lightly, especially given their effect on our colleagues who have made meaningful contributions to the company. To this end, we are committed to supporting all employees through this transition. Members of our HR team will be working closely with business unit leaders to share detailed information on benefits and transition services. Additional questions can be directed to [human resources].\n\n\tWe are deeply grateful for your hard work, professionalism, and resilience during this period of transition. We remain confident that Paramount’s best days are ahead, and we’re committed to building a strong foundation for the future.\n\n\tThank you,David\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe lineup for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ceremony in Los Angeles Nov. 8 is beginning to look stuffed nearly to the gills, with 17 more performers or presenters officially added Tuesday to the list of celebrities participating in the inductions. The newly announced stars range from actor Jim Carrey to singers Nathaniel Rateliff and Avril Lavigne to multi-hyphenates like Janelle Monáe and Donald Glover.\n\n\tThese 17 just-revealed guests come on top of the news just a day before that two big names in music, Chappell Roan and the Killers, would take part. Prior to that, 18 guest stars had been announced in the initial rollout of names.\n\t\n\n\tFollowing are the names announced for the first time on Tuesday (alphabetized, as is the Rock Hall’s peculiar custom, by first name):\n\n\n\tAvril LavigneBryan AdamsDonald GloverEn VogueFeistGina SchockHurby Luv Bug AzorJanelle MonáeJerry CantrellJim CarreyJoe PerryLisa ColemanMick FleetwoodMike McCreadyNancy WilsonNathaniel RateliffTedeschi Trucks Band\n\n\tBesides Roan and the Killers, who were announced Monday, the celebrities previously unveiled for the ceremony on Oct. 8 were (again, in the Rock Hall’s first-name-basis listing order) Beck, Brandi Carlile, David Letterman, Doja Cat, Elton John, Flea, Iggy Pop, J.I.D, Killer Mike, Maxwell, Missy Elliott, Olivia Rodrigo, Questlove, Raye, Sleepy Brown, Taylor Momsen, Teddy Swims and Twenty One Pilots.\n\n\tThat brings the number of big-name tribute-payers to 37… but Rock Hall ceremonies have never made for a short evening, so there’s no reason to start now.\n\n\tThe Hall does not usually say in advance what role these figures will be playing in the ceremony, so fans mostly have to guess whether they’ll be singing or presenting, and in honor of whom. Monday, they made an announcement, posting a video in which Roan expressed her excitement over inducting Lauper. \n\t\n\n\tLauper “has inspired me with her fashion and her hair, and of course, her makeup, her music,” Roan said in the video. “I actually auditioned with ‘True Colors’ for ‘America’s Got Talent’ when I was 13. I didn’t make it, but the song is still incredible. I’m so excited. Thanks for having me.”\n\n\tBesides Lauper, this year’s inductees are Bad Company, Chubby Checker, Joe Cocker, Outkast, Soundgarden and the White Stripes, as the elected entrants into the hall. They are joined by the honorees in the committee-selected categories: Salt-N-Pepa and Warren Zevon for Musical Influence, Thom Bell, Nicky Hopkins and Carol Kaye for Musical Excellence, and Lenny Waronker for the Ahmet Ertegun Award.\n\n\tThe Rock Hall’s 40th annual induction ceremony takes place at the Peacock Theater in downtown L.A. It will air live in all U.S. time zones on Disney+ starting at 8 p.m. ET/5 PT. A condensed version of the show will air as a prime-time special on ABC on Jan. 1 and go up for viewing the following day on Hulu.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFuture seasons of the Emmy-winning “Shogun” could finally film in Japan if the country addresses critical infrastructure and incentive gaps, Emmy-winning producer Miyagawa Eriko indicated during a candid MPA industry panel at the Tokyo International Film Festival on Wednesday.\n\n\tWhen asked by Variety about shooting subsequent seasons in Japan, Miyagawa expressed clear interest. “It’s not up to me, but I would love to, personally, and I will always be pitching some ideas and opportunities,” she said. “I’m doing that now, I’ll be doing that throughout. Season 3, we don’t have scripts, we don’t know what it is yet. But, I’d love to.”\n\t\n\n\tThe producer’s openness represents a potential homecoming for the series, which wanted to shoot in Japan for its first season but couldn’t make it work. “We very much wanted to shoot here, but it was height of COVID,” Miyagawa explained. “[Creators] Justin [Marks] and Rachel [Kondo] couldn’t come to Japan to scout, so unfortunately we had to give up.”\n\n\n\t“I get a lot of heat,”  Miyagawa said about the decision to shoot in Canada. “The studio ultimately makes these decisions, so I am not in a place to speak on behalf of them.”\n\n\tBut the pandemic wasn’t the only obstacle. Miyagawa, speaking alongside Australian producer Schuyler Weiss (“Elvis”), Thailand’s Apinat Obb Siricharoenjit, unit production manager on “Alien: Earth,” and Kusunoki Junko, president of Film Solutions Co. and production consultant on HBO’s “Tokyo Vice,” detailed the infrastructure limitations that ultimately pushed the period drama to Vancouver. “Where we would base the bulk of our shoot was always going to be a numbers decision,” she said, noting the show’s need for extensive soundstage space, backlots and locations suitable for building fishing villages and castle walls.\n\t\n\n\tVancouver’s appeal was undeniable: “Infrastructure was there, housing options were really broad, and the big studio was maybe half an hour, 45 minutes drive away, and it was very compact and effectively supported our needs.”\n\n\tFor Japan to attract “Shogun” and similar large-scale productions, the panelists identified several urgent priorities. While Japan’s introduction of film incentives has generated unprecedented international interest, Kusunoki pinpointed critical implementation problems. She explained that uncertainty around grant approval timing creates a chicken-and-egg dilemma: productions must hire staff and develop budgets to apply, but risk losing everything if not selected.\n\n\t“When it becomes ‘sorry, you didn’t get it,’ even though they’re offering 50% support, which is wonderful, losing that 50% means productions consider going to Thailand instead, or canceling altogether,” Kusunoki said. She advocated for earlier letters of intent from government agencies to allow proper pre-production.\n\n\tThe annual deadline crunch compounds the problem. “You have to finish by the end of January to meet the fiscal year, which means you really only have about six months to work,” she noted, stressing that proper pre-production is essential for quality filmmaking.\n\n\tMiyagawa emphasized the scale challenge that would need to be addressed for “Shogun” to return: “For a show like ‘Shogun,’ which just means so much space,” including massive soundstages and diverse nearby locations.\n\n\tKusunoki drove the point home: “Sound stages in Japan are generally very small, and the largest one in Toho is still very small in Hollywood standards.”\n\n\tSiricharoenjit offered a cautionary tale from Thailand’s recent boom. When “Alien: Earth” came to Bangkok, “we were in our little shell,” he admitted. The production required 13 soundstages across the city and had to import 800 sky panels from New Zealand — more than double Thailand’s entire 350-unit inventory. “We just hit a point of realization, an epiphany — we’re not ready.”\n\n\tWeiss, drawing on Australia’s experience with international productions, pushed back against local industry anxiety about Hollywood takeovers. “Go have coffee with a grip and ask them how they feel,” he suggested. “International productions come and pay their mortgage so they can then come and make a small art movie in Australia.”\n\t\n\n\tHe cited New Zealand as an example: “Off the back of one series of movies,” Peter Jackson’s ‘Lord of the Rings’ trilogy “turned Wellington into a global film center. That’s just what one massive injection of international production can do.”\n\n\tSiricharoenjit emphasized the importance of supporting local productions alongside international work. Thailand is developing both local production incentives and post-production incentives to retain talent. “We have all Thai names up there” in Marvel movie credits, he noted, “but there’s no jobs. So they have to go outside of the country. It’s time to bring these people home.”\n\n\tLow wages and poor working conditions — including 18-hour days with no overtime — make Japanese film work unattractive to young talent. “We’re turning great people away from the market,” Miyagawa said, calling for “that hard conversation” about industry labor practices.\n\n\tWeiss advocated for creative recruitment: “You give me a week, five real estate agents, and I’ll give you back five location agents,” he said, noting that mid-career transitions and better promotion of diverse film industry roles could rapidly expand the crew base.\n\n\tDespite the challenges, panelists saw growing openness on both sides. “Over the years there’s more openness both ways, especially from the Hollywood side,” Miyagawa observed. “There are willingness, eagerness to collaborate and also willingness to work with more Japanese crew when they’re shooting in Japan.”\n\n\tKusunoki highlighted “Tokyo Vice” as a model, noting how location managers who worked on the show subsequently joined the American Location Managers Association. She advocated for more Japanese content made in collaboration with international partners, praising “Shogun” as “not a traditional Japanese film, but clearly Japanese content.”\n\n\t“As an island nation, it’s important to present Japanese content made in Japan,” she said. “But the next phase should be participating as Japan within the world.”\n\n\tWhen asked about cross-border collaboration, Weiss pointed to Europe’s model of routine multi-country co-productions. “I would love to see an Australian, Japanese, South Korean, Thai co-production that’s not because of some specific unique need, but just because we want to work together,” he said.\n\t\n\n\tSiricharoenjit agreed, noting Budapest’s success came partly from bringing in crew from across Europe. “We need something like that in the Asia Pacific region too.”\n",

His solid experience in management, corporate strategy and ability to translate strategic vision into tangible business results bring a distinctive value to this new phase of the studio’s growth,” said Brendan Fitzgerald, CEO of Secuoya Studios. “His integrative vision and his capacity to align talent, processes and strategic objectives will be key to further accelerating the international development of our operations.”\n\n\n\tAs a business affairs executive at Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios, Bermúdez de Castro focused on negotiations behind multiple Amazon Original productions, content acquisition deals and cross-functional coordination. He previously held the position of senior associate at international law firm, Andersen and Écija.\n\n\tHe brings his 15-plus years of senior management experience to Secuoya Studios, built on a career that has combined audiovisual law, corporate management and executive leadership within the entertainment sector. He holds a dual degree in Law and International Business Administration.\n\t\n\n\tHis appointment will further reinforce the studio’s international ambition as it continues its expansion strategy across Europe, Latin America and the U.S. It currently has operations in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Chile and the U.S.\n\n\t“Joining Secuoya Studios represents an exciting opportunity to contribute to a benchmark project that has undoubtedly driven the audiovisual industry forward in recent years,” said Bermúdez de Castro. “My goal is to bring a strategic and management-oriented vision that enhances efficiency, innovation and the group’s international expansion.”\n\n\tWhile at the annual confab Iberseries & Platino Industria in Madrid, Fitzgerald led the presentation of Secuoya Studios’ innovative pod-based strategy: creative and production cells made up of local talent that enable agile, efficient content creation, adaptation and distribution across multiple territories.\n\n\tLast year, the studio announced its intent to produce more English-language projects as part of its bid to broaden its reach. To that end, it struck a strategic first-look development and production partnership with London-based BlackBox Multimedia in February. The move dovetailed with its goal to generate 30% of its annual revenues from content produced in other languages aside from Spanish.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAn original anime feature set in an alternate 2027 Japan is at the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market, promising a high-octane blend of feudal imagery and futuristic warfare.\n\n\t“Killtube,” directed by Kuribayashi Kazuaki, takes place in a world where Japan remains under Edo Shogunate rule, transformed into a sprawling metropolis of skyscrapers behind isolationist walls. In this stratified society, citizens are divided into seven status levels that determine every aspect of their lives — from housing to occupation to food rations.\n\t\n\n\tThe only escape from predetermined fate comes through “Killtube,” a government-run streaming platform where combatants duel to the death for fortune and freedom. At the story’s center is Musashi, a boy raised by dogs at the bottom of society’s hierarchy, who teams up with Kikuchiyo, a shrewd producer, and Leo, an inventive genius, to fight their way to the top. Their unconventional approach catches the eye of Shogun Ieyasu himself, ultimately forcing them to confront the darker truths beneath their controlled world.\n\n\n\t“Within the 90 minutes of the film, I want to paint the feeling of excitement that someone has felt in their life, and to do that, I try to keep that same excitement within myself throughout the process,” Kuribayashi tells Variety. “We would like the audience to feel that sense of excitement and anticipation, and if this original work can reach people across borders and connect with them, that would be a real success for us.”\n\n\tThe production has adopted an unconventional approach that sets it apart from typical anime workflows. “‘Killtube’s identity is built on continuously gathering and integrating ideas from creators across diverse industries,” Kuribayashi explains. “Rather than following a conventional assembly-line workflow, we iterate through idea cycles. The greatest challenge has been maintaining a sense of speed, but we are now at a stage where that flow is becoming firmly established.”\n\t\n\n\tProducer Fujimura Kayane notes that the team completed the screenplay and storyboards in 2025 and has now entered the CG pre-visualization phase. “Because we adopted a unique workflow that required moving back and forth between scriptwriting and storyboarding, we faced some major creative challenges,” Fujimura says. “However, through that process, our team was able to shape a story and characters we are truly proud of.”\n\n\tCasting is currently underway, bringing fresh momentum to the production. “Hearing the characters come to life through the actors’ voices has given the entire team a renewed sense of excitement and confidence in the project,” Fujimura adds.\n\n\tFor the filmmakers, the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market represents a crucial opportunity to expand the project’s reach beyond Japan. “It’s a very valuable opportunity for us to present ‘Killtube’ to audiences outside Japan,” Fujimura says. “We hope to directly share our vision and explore how people around the world perceive the potential of this project, while building new international relationships and collaborations along the way.”\n\n\tThe production is targeting completion in 2026, with plans for both local and international release. Kuribayashi remains hands-on throughout the process, “deeply involved in checking and directing every part of the production, from animation and recording to background CG and color keys.”\n\n\t“We aim to release Killt’ube not only in Japan but also to audiences around the world,” Fujimura says. “We’re working hard to make it a film that people everywhere can look forward to.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSchuyler Weiss, producer of Baz Luhrmann’s “Elvis,” made a compelling case for Australia’s film ecosystem at an MPA seminar during the Tokyo International Film Festival, speaking from his unique position as both a local Australian producer and facilitator of major Hollywood productions.\n\n\tWeiss, who has worked with Luhrmann for approximately 20 years on productions including “Australia,” “The Great Gatsby” and “Elvis,” outlined how sophisticated production incentives have helped transform the Gold Coast into one of the country’s fastest-growing film centers.\n\t\n\n\t“I stand here, on the one hand, as a local Australian film producer who is as concerned as anyone with the health, the growth, the future of our domestic production industry, but I also spend a big part of my day actively bringing large scale Hollywood backed global productions to Australia,” Weiss said, noting his upcoming work on Luhrmann’s “Joan of Arc.”\n\n\n\tAustralia’s multi-tiered incentive system features a 30% production attraction rebate for international productions, standalone post-production incentives, and various programs specifically for Australian producers at the federal level. Individual states add their own incentives, creating what Weiss described as a “co-opetition” that spreads work around the country while avoiding bottlenecks in Sydney or Melbourne.\n\n\tEven local governments participate — the Gold Coast city council offers municipal-level incentives. “You can coordinate all the levels of government to be the wind in the sails of your production,” Weiss explained.\n\n\tHe emphasized that incentives must be clear and accessible for quick decision-making, noting he’s “seen the spreadsheets in the corridors of power and big movie studios in Hollywood, where without great regard to what the content is going on screen, they’re just looking at whether they should shoot in London or the Gold Coast or Bratislava, as if those things are interchangeable.”\n\t\n\n\tWorking with the MPA, Australia recently strengthened and clarified the 30% location attraction rebate, replacing what Weiss called “something that was just, frankly, kind of unwieldy and confusing.” The incentives operate on a rolling basis to accommodate the industry’s unpredictable timelines.\n\n\tWeiss stressed that government incentives represent an investment rather than a gift, with returns of four to five times every dollar spent. The economic impact extends beyond industry payroll to rental cars, hotels, meals and other services. “The penetration goes so deeply into the economy when big film productions come to town that the incentives offer a tremendous return on investment, but it’s also an investment in the future,” he said.\n\n\tScreen Australia serves as the interface between the industry and government, with Weiss praising the agency’s clear governance structure. The incentive system has enjoyed bipartisan political support for 18 years, providing the reliability necessary for infrastructure investment.\n\n\tOver two decades, Australia has hosted dozens of major movies and international productions, elevating filmmakers like George Miller and Luhrmann to the highest levels while they continued working domestically. “Elvis” featured 100% Australian visual effects work, with so many shots that Weiss joked the VFX team were “victims of their own success” because the recreations of Memphis locations like Beale Street looked so authentic that visitors from Tennessee believed they had filmed on location.\n\n\tIn reality, the production built a five-block backlot set of Memphis on a former city dump on the Gold Coast that had been grassed over.\n\n\tWeiss highlighted the skills transfer between large international productions and local films. After “Elvis” wrapped, he produced a smaller Australian film, “How to Make Gravy,” for the local market, giving department members from the big production their first head-of-department roles on a feature. “That hand in hand between the international industry and the local industry is really, really gratifying to be a part of,” he said.\n\n\tAustralia now has world-class production facilities in Sydney, Melbourne and the Gold Coast, with emerging centers in South Australia and Western Australia. However, the industry faces capacity constraints — even director Ron Howard couldn’t secure soundstage bookings for two back-to-back Gold Coast productions, per Weiss.\n\t\n\n\tWeiss identified post-production and visual effects as “the next big frontier” for Australian industry growth. The country offers a 30% PDV (post-production, digital and visual effects) rebate nationally, with Queensland adding an extra 15%. “We want people who shoot their movie anywhere, shoot their movie in Japan, shoot their movie in Thailand, shoot their movie in Canada, or maybe even actually in Hollywood, to feel like they would do post production in Australia regardless of where the movie is shot,” Weiss said.\n\n\tHe noted that a company recently committed to moving 100 employees from Sydney to the Gold Coast, with plans to grow to 300-500 positions within a few years, attracted by the rebate structure. International production location incentives now include mandates for skills development spending, which Weiss applauded for training young technicians.\n\n\tWeiss noted that production company Bazmark, is partnering with multiple levels of Australian government to develop the Miami Arts Depot (MAD), a permanent integrated creative community on 35,000 square meters of former municipal land on the Gold Coast, approximately one kilometer from the beach. The facility will house post-production, visual effects, technology companies, production companies and industry organizations.\n\n\t“We want to create a hub there that will offer the best in class vendors and facilities for our industry to use, and also for the benefit of our international productions and partners,” Weiss said. The project aims to foster intersection between film, technology and design while maintaining physical space for creative collaboration. “At the end of the day, our industry, the movie business, is the most collaborative art form ever devised,” he noted.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWithout having to give up her voice to a sea witch, the titular mermaid princess in the Japanese animated dramedy “ChaO” gets the husband of her dreams. Still, their seemingly fated bond doesn’t immediately manifest as an idealized romance. Instead, it starts out mimicking an outdated arranged marriage to secure prosperous relationships between humans and merpeople, then develops into a tale of coexistence and life-career balance. While hardly original in concept — Hayao Miyazaki’s “Ponyo” or Masaaki Yuasa’s “Lu Over the Wall” and “Ride Your Wave” come to mind — Yasuhiro Aoki’s debut feature sets itself apart by way of its singularly stylized, lively visual panache.\n\t\n\n\tNot set in Japan, but in the Chinese city of Shanghai, the story of this union across kingdoms is framed via an interview that a young journalist from a near future is doing with a mysterious Stephan (Oji Suzuka), ChaO’s human mate, to debunk the accounts of history books in this reality on how their connection happened. In the opening scene, the vibrant production design reveals the densely populated city has been retrofitted to accommodate water dwellers into a diverse society. But how did they achieve this inclusive utopia?\n\n\n\tBacktrack to a younger Stephan, a more frantic and ambitious engineer than the one telling the tale from years ahead. He works at a ship manufacturing company, which finds itself at a political crossroads: King Neptunus (Kenta Miyake), ruler of the ocean, threatens to cease relations with humanity if something isn’t done about the screw propellers on commercial vessels that harm merkind. And though Stephan has been working on an air jet that would prevent these injuries, his boss has little interest in hearing his costly idea. That changes when ChaO (Anna Yamada) comes across him at sea and implies she’s loved him for as long as she can remember. For the collective benefit, Stephan agrees to marry her in exchange for resources to develop his vision.\n\t\n\n\tBackgrounds in “ChaO” are laden with rich detail, reflecting the visual saturation of a crowded metropolis like Shanghai. The visual uniqueness of this fantastical depiction extends to the character design, which one can instantly identify as distinct from that of most anime, whether features or series. The eyes on Stephan and most characters, for example, are minimalist and sketch-like, rather than enlarged and elaborate. In contrast to those restrained facial features, there are those who sport oversized heads or oval-shaped bodies. And the aesthetic extravagance appears even more pronounced in the merpeople, all of whom take on a humanoid form on land and live as sea creatures underwater. It’s only once the merperson trusts a human that they can keep their anthropomorphic bodies.\n\n\tEnter ChaO, who herself looks to have been crafted with the intention to maximize her adorableness in fish form. Her rotund shape, bright salmon colored skin, big widely spaced eyes and foam-like hair make for a disarmingly lovable presence. Underwater, ChaO’s appearance transforms into that of a mermaid one might more easily recognize, but with a bluish hair. \n\n\tOff to a rocky start, ChaO and Stephan move into his minuscule apartment, an adjustment for the former who ignores how everyday life operates for humans. Endearing comedy is mined from her impromptu education about what Stephan likes to eat or even what fireworks are and whether one can deploy them indoors. Stephan’s friends, scientist Robelt (Yuichiro Umehara) and Mybae (Kavka Shishido), step in to sort of parent ChaO, as Stephan turns dismissive toward what feels like an imposed partner.\n\n\tThe artists behind “ChaO,” in particular character designer and supervising animation director Hirokazu Kojima, decidedly crafted a universe with a cast of characters whose personalities resonate as memorable as their eclectic configuration — consider the enormous baby that casually wanders Stephan’s street, presumably at the same time everyday. There are sequences that dazzle for the kinetic vibrancy of the animation: a music-driven moment that sees ChaO dancing inside a fountain as she manipulates water around her or an aerial sequence involving one of Robelt’s robots are standouts.\n\n\tWhen ChaO vanishes after angering Stephan, the latter must return to the trauma of his childhood to understand his deep ties to his would-be wife and reconsider his future. Hanasaki Kino’s screenplay may be overstuffed with creativity, which matches the movie’s other maximalist qualities, but it’s Stephan’s evolution into maturity that eventually surfaces as the key theme. His pursuit of professional greatness becomes secondary to his appreciation for more essential fulfilment: namely, a family of his own. Whether visually or emotionally, that journey makes for a delightfully offbeat experience.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBollywood star Ayushmann Khurrana has scored his fifth century at the Indian box office with the Diwali blockbuster “Thamma,” which has crossed the INR100 crore mark ($11.3 million) and is poised to become the highest-grossing origin film in the Maddock Horror Comedy Universe.\n\n\tThe supernatural horror-comedy, directed by Aditya Sarpotdar and produced by Dinesh Vijan and Amar Kaushik, stars Khurrana alongside Rashmika Mandanna, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, and Paresh Rawal in the fifth installment of the expanding universe.\n\t\n\n\tThe film follows Alok Goyal, a journalist who transforms into a vampiric creature called Betal after encountering a mysterious woman, and must save humanity from the bloodlust of an ancient evil.\n\n\n\tThe INR100 crore number has long been considered a yardstick of box office success in India. “Thamma” has collected INR123 crore ($13.9 million) so far, joining Khurrana’s roster of century club hits. They include “Dream Girl” ($22.6 million), “Dream Girl 2” ($15.8 million), “Badhaai Ho” ($25 million), and “Bala” ($19.4 million).\n\n\tKhurrana has launched several franchises, including “Dream Girl,” “Badhaai Ho,” “Shubh Mangal Saavdhaan,” “Thamma,” and “Andha Dhun,” the latter of which teased a sequel in its climax.\n\n\t“The public validation is the biggest validation for any artiste,” Khurrana tells Variety. “Maddock Horror Comedy Universe has an amazing legacy of hits and as an origin film, ‘Thamma,’ has registered the best opening of any MHCU’s first film. It is also going to become the highest grossing origin film within MHCU which again is a big feat. So, I’m very happy and I thank the audience for this love.”\n\t\n\n\tThe supernatural comedy represents Khurrana’s first major Diwali holiday frame release and his second post-pandemic century at the box office after “Dream Girl 2.”\n\n\t“I always wanted to do a big film that becomes a festival release and entertains the whole of India,” Khurrana said. “‘Thamma’ has made all my dreams come true as an entertainer.”\n\n\tThe actor expressed particular satisfaction that “Thamma” has broadened his demographic appeal beyond his usual audience base.\n\n\t“The best part is that kids loved this film, my earlier films have been for a mature audience, but ‘Thamma,’ kids really enjoyed it. I’m very happy about this.” he said. “Every year during Diwali we used to go to watch films of big stars in cinemas. I used to always wish that my film too releases in this massive holiday and people enjoy it. It means a lot to me to see that the audience have gone to watch my film this time with their entire family and are having a lovely time.”\n",

He also stated that you had wear PPE equipment to handle the monkeys.\"\n      \n    \n          Mississippi’s got one wild situation -- a hostile STD-carrying monkey busted loose from a large trailer truck hauling primates after the semi flipped over on a highway, according to police.\n      \n    \n          The wreck went down Tuesday in Heidelberg, where the truck, containing several monkeys infected with hepatitis C, herpes, and COVID, crashed en route from Tulane University to a Florida testing lab.\n      \n    \n      \n      WATCH: Video shows the aftermath of a crash involving a truck transporting rhesus monkeys from Tulane University.University officials say the monkeys are not infectious. pic.twitter.com/qZMRIyxvEl— Resist Times (@ResistTimes_US) October 28, 2025\n              @ResistTimes_US\n          \n  \n    \n          Cops say six monkeys made a break for it -- but five were destroyed, and one’s still on the loose. Witnesses shot camera footage that captured the surviving monkey climbing out of the trailer and wandering around in a rural area.\n      \n\n          Police warned the public the monkey is super aggressive toward humans. Translation: if you see a monkey on the run, don’t approach it... just call 911.\n      \n    \n          Mississippi wildlife officials and local cops are already out trying to nab the furry baboon, but can't seem to find the chimp anywhere.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          As for Tulane University, officials tell us -- despite what the cops say -- the primates in question belong to another entity and are \"not infectious,\" meaning they don't have diseases. They add, \"We are actively collaborating with local authorities and will send a team of animal care experts to assist as needed.\"\n      \n    \n          TMZ also reached out to Tulane National Biomedical Research Center ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      ",

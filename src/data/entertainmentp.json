    "body": "\n\tVariety is exclusively unveiling a new clip from “Lullaby for the Mountains,” the debut feature from Armenian filmmaker Hayk Matevosyan that is making its Asian premiere at the 56th International Film Festival of India (IFFI), where it serves as the sole Armenian selection. \n\n\tThe contemplative work, executive produced by Hungarian auteur Béla Tarr, world premiered at Sheffield DocFest 2025 in the International First Feature Competition.\n\t\n\n\tThe film unfolds across 15 dreamlike chapters chronicling a spectral journey through Armenia’s rugged highlands. Shot entirely on location in Armenia, the wordless narrative follows an unnamed figure traversing ancient monasteries, mountain landscapes and underground chambers, blurring boundaries between reality and dreams.\n\n\n\tIn an interview with Variety, Matevosyan describes the project as a meditation on collective memory and loss. The director explains the significance of premiering at IFFI, noting the historical connections between Armenian and Indian cultures spanning centuries.\n\n\t“What makes this Asian premiere so special is the deep connection between Armenian and Indian culture that goes back centuries,” Matevosyan says. “Armenian communities have lived in India for a long time, in cities like Kolkata and Chennai, but the connection has always been mutual.”\n\n\tThe filmmaker characterizes the work as exploring themes of displacement and cultural memory. “For me, ‘Lullaby for the Mountains’ is about ghosts drifting through the land, about collective memory, and the quiet traces of lives that have passed and those still to come,” he says.\n\t\n\n\tTarr’s involvement stems from Matevosyan’s participation in the 2019 Locarno Spring Academy Directing Residency, where he created a short film under the legendary director’s mentorship. The collaboration proved transformative for the young filmmaker’s approach.\n\n\t“Spending time with him really changed how I approach filmmaking,” Matevosyan recalls. “He opened my eyes to a whole new way of thinking about image, atmosphere, landscape, and characters.”\n\n\tThe director emphasizes Tarr’s unorthodox mentoring philosophy: “He dislikes the words ‘teaching’ or ‘education,’ and always says that he is here to liberate us, not to educate.”\n\n\tDuring production of the residency short, Tarr showed Matevosyan paintings by Caspar David Friedrich without commentary. “That’s when I really started thinking of cinematic images more like paintings, rather than only just tools for story or plot,” the director says.\n\n\tAs executive producer, Tarr reviewed multiple cuts and encouraged bold aesthetic choices. This support influenced Matevosyan’s decision to eliminate voice-over narration entirely, allowing soundscape and visuals to carry the narrative independently.\n\n\t“I think ultimately what Béla gave me is the courage to just go and make my debut film without thinking of any cinematic rules and I’m beyond grateful for that,” Matevosyan says.\n\n\tThe filmmaker holds a directing degree from UCLA and has participated in numerous prestigious programs including Berlinale Talents, Sarajevo Talents, IFFR Sessions, the BFC Workshop in Peruvian Amazonia under Werner Herzog’s mentorship, and the Locarno Spring Academy.\n\n\tHis work has screened at major festivals including Locarno, Slamdance DIG, LA Film Festival, Atlanta Film Festival, AGBU Film at Lincoln Center and the Werner Herzog Foundation. Matevosyan also directed the music video “Lives” for System of A Down member Daron Malakian.\n\n\t“Lullaby for the Mountains” is produced by Luiza Yeranosyan and Matevosyan through production company Dolly Bell Films. The cast includes Ashot Matevosyan, Bella Ghochikyan, Sargis Mosinyan, Luiza Yeranosyan and Hayk Mosinyan. Matevosyan served as writer, director, cinematographer and editor on the Armenia-U.S. co-production.\n\n\tWatch the clip here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tRevered filmmaker and International Film Festival of India (IFFI) festival director Shekhar Kapur is steering the Goa-based event toward a future emphasizing technological innovation, audience engagement and international co-production opportunities as it enters its 56th edition.\n\n\tIn an interview, Kapur outlines three key priorities reshaping India’s flagship film festival: integrating artificial intelligence and emerging technologies into the festival infrastructure, transforming the WAVES Film Bazaar into a major international marketplace, and positioning IFFI as an audience-focused celebration rather than solely an industry event.\n\t\n\n\t“We’ve got an AI hackathon festival as part of the WAVES Film Bazaar,” Kapur says, describing partnerships with Larsen & Toubro and Google to incorporate technology demonstrations throughout the event. “AI is becoming such a big controversy all over the world, but it’s so democratic. It’s a completely democratic medium. It’s trying to give more people more tools.”\n\n\n\tThe festival director highlights India’s enhanced production incentive program, which has increased from 30% to 40% cash rebates for international productions filming in the country. He cites the British-Indian production “Santosh,” which competed for an Oscar nomination as the U.K.’s official submission, as an example of the program’s effectiveness.\n\n\t“The producer of ‘Santosh’ actually got his 30% back, and he said it was the easiest deal he’s ever made,” Kapur says, noting the growing number of Indian filmmakers based overseas who are utilizing the incentives to produce projects in India.\n\t\n\n\tThe WAVES Film Bazaar, IFFI’s co-production market and financing platform, has become central to Kapur’s strategy for attracting international participants. The event serves as a venue where filmmakers can pitch projects and connect with potential collaborators and financiers.\n\n\t“We’re hoping to attract a lot more people to the WAVES Film Bazaar,” Kapur explains. “The interaction between filmmakers of Indian origin or Asian origin coming to make films in India” represents a key growth area for the festival.\n\n\tIn a departure from traditional film festival protocol, Kapur has introduced a Goa carnival-style opening ceremony designed to engage local audiences and residents. The move reflects his broader ambition to make IFFI more accessible to the general public rather than limiting it to industry professionals.\n\n\t“The International Film Festival of India is the only film festival in the world that is called Indian Film Festival,” he says, contrasting it with city-named festivals like Venice, Toronto and Tokyo. “The fact is that they actually do belong to the city, and there are lots of either private funding or funding from the city itself, because the city grows along with the festival.”\n\n\tThe festival currently attracts approximately 20,000 attendees, with Kapur projecting that number will reach 50,000 by next year — a figure that includes general audiences rather than just industry delegates.\n\n\tRegarding programming, Kapur emphasizes that this year’s edition features what he considers the strongest lineup in recent years, with 10 films from the festival having been submitted as Oscar entries from various countries.\n\n\t“This is probably the best lineup of international films,” he says. “We’ve tried very hard to bring the best of world cinema to the audiences.”\n\n\tKapur acknowledges that IFFI faces challenges in attracting high-profile titles to its competition sections, as films selected for competition at established festivals like Cannes generate significant market attention and acquisition interest. However, he expresses confidence in the festival’s alternative strengths, particularly its growing WAVES Film Bazaar and production incentive initiatives.\n\n\tThe director has committed to serving a two-year term in the festival director role, which has required him to pause his filmmaking career during this period. The 55th International Film Festival of India runs Nov. 20-28 in Goa. WAVES Film Bazaar runs Nov. 20-24.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVince Gill received the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award during the CMA Awards on Nov. 19. Preceding Gill’s acceptance of the honor, a musical tribute took the stage, featuring Brandi Carlile and Patty Loveless covering Gill’s hit song “When I Call Your Name.”\n\n\tAfter the performance, country legend George Strait took the stage to present Gill with the award. He said of the 22-time Grammy winner, “There is not a more deserving person to receive this honor, which bears the name of the true Icon himself, Mr. Willie Nelson.”\n\t\n\n\tGill kept it light with his acceptance speech, opening with a joke before gushing about the award’s history. He told the audience, “It’s not lost on me that we had to have girls come out here and sing for me tonight. None of the boys can get up that high.” He added. “This is amazing. In the history of this award, I think it’s been given to maybe ten people, nine or ten, something like that. And that list of people is astounding.”\n\n\n\tAfter sharing a message of love and gratitude to his management and family, Gill gave a final shoutout to the award’s namesake: “Willie, if you’re out there listening, 92 years old, you’re still inspiring us to this day. God bless.”\n\n\tBorn in Oklahoma, Gill began his career as a session player and solo act, working on David Grisman’s 1983 album “Here Today” and releasing his debut EP the following year. In 1990, he had his first hit single with “When I Call Your Name.” Two years later, he released the quadruple platinum album “I Still Believe in You,” which solidified him as a major star and leading figure in country music. \n\t\n\n\tToday, Gill has released 20 albums, selling over 30 million records and charting 45 singles. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2007 and has previously earned 18 CMA Awards as well as 22 Grammys.\n\n\tHis history with the CMA runs deep. In addition to receiving 18 awards and now the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award, he also hosted the show every year from 1992 to 2003 and has become a part of the ceremony’s iconography. \n\n\tGill continues to play and create, performing with the Eagles at the intermittent Sphere concerts in Las Vegas. He also continues his solo career, having just recently reupped his deal with MCA Records and relased the  EP “I Gave You Everything I Had” in October.\n\n\tThe 59th annual CMA Awards took place at Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena in Tennessee and were broadcast live on ABC. The event was hosted by Lainey Wilson.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPost-production giant Prasad is showcasing 10 restored Indian classics at the 55th International Film Festival of India (IFFI), running Nov. 20-28 in Goa.\n\n\tThe restored titles, part of an ongoing collaboration between the National Film Development Corporation, the National Film Archive of India and Prasad, span multiple decades of Indian cinema. The lineup includes Muzaffar Ali’s 1981 costume drama “Umrao Jaan,” starring Rekha as a 19th-century courtesan.\n\t\n\n\tThe 10 films screening at IFFI are Ali’s “Umrao Jaan” (1981) and “Gaman” (1978), Kalpana Lajmi’s “Rudaali” (1993), Ritwik Ghatak’s “Subarnarekha” (1965), Baburao Painter’s “Muraliwala” (1927), Govind Nihalani’s “Party” (1984), Guru Dutt’s “Pyaasa” (1957), Shyam Benegal’s “Susman” (1987), Sibi Malayil’s “Kireedam” (1989) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s “Musafir” (1957).\n\n\n\tPrasad’s restoration teams utilized digital restoration techniques, color grading and quality control protocols to preserve each film’s original vision while ensuring technical fidelity across picture and sound elements.\n\n\t“Restoring these films is both a responsibility and a privilege,” said Abhishek Prasad, director and CTO at Prasad. “Each title carries within it a piece of India’s cultural memory — the craft, courage and creativity of filmmakers who defined our cinematic language.”\n\n\tPrasad is also presenting two restored Sri Lankan films at the 47th Nantes Three Continents Film Festival in France, running Nov. 21-29. The company restored D.B. Nihalsinghe’s “Welikathara” (1971) and Prasanna Vithanage’s “Akasa Kusum” (2008) for the festival, which celebrates cinema from Asia, Africa and Latin America. \n\t\n\n\t“It is always an honor when films from our region find new life and new audiences across the world,” said Kavita Prasad, managing director of Prasad Corporation. “Sri Lanka’s cinematic legacy is rich, nuanced and deeply human.”\n\n\tFounded in 1956 by filmmaker L.V. Prasad, the company has worked on more than 30,000 films over six decades. The post-production house operates facilities across India, the U.S., U.K., Germany, Japan and Saudi Arabia, offering services including 8K film restoration, digital intermediate work, HDR grading and Dolby Atmos mixing.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Friends” diehards can finally watch the conclusion of the short-lived spinoff series “Joey.”\n\n\tThe final eight episodes of the 2004 NBC sitcom, which starred Matt LeBlanc as the wisecracking Joey Tribbiani, never aired in the U.S. after the show was canceled in 2006 during its second season. But now, those eight installments are available to watch on the “Friends” YouTube channel, along with he 38 others that comprise the complete series.\n\t\n\n\tOutside of LeBlanc, other cast members included Drea de Matteo, Paulo Costanzo, Jennifer Coolidge and Andrea Anders. The series followed Joey as he “leaves New York for Hollywood in order to take his acting career to the next level.” While in Los Angeles, he reunites with “his high-strung sister Gina (Matteo)” and “Michael (Costanzo), his 20-year-old genius nephew,” per an official description.\n\n\n\tCreated by “Friends” producers Shana Goldberg-Meehan and Scott Silveri, the show’s pilot debuted to an impressive 18.6 million viewers. However, hype quickly died down through the remainder of Season 1 and Season 2.\n\n\tAfter “Joey” came to an end, “Friends” executive producer and director Kevin S. Bright gave his thoughts on why the spin-off failed to find an audience. He told The Age in 2006, “On ‘Friends’ Joey was a womaniser but we enjoyed his exploits. He was a solid friend, a guy you knew you could count on. Joey was deconstructed to be a guy who couldn’t get a job, couldn’t ask a girl out. He became a pathetic, mopey character. I felt he was moving in the wrong direction, but I was not heard.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLainey Wilson, Ella Langley and Riley Green each scored three honors at the 59th annual CMA Awards show Wednesday night, with Wilson taking away the most coveted prize, entertainer of the year. \n\n\tSurprises were in order in some of the categories considered long held by intractable repeat winners, Cody Johnson won for best male vocalist, finally moving Chris Stapleton out of that position, while the Red Clay Strays won vocal group of the year, supplanting the seemingly indomitable Old Dominion.\n\t\n\n\tWilson, the show’s host, won for album of the year — for “Whirlwind” — and female vocalist as well as entertainer of the year. \n\n\n\tLangley and Green were duet partners whose teaming on “You Look Like You Love Me” landed both of them wins single of the year, song of the year and music video of the year.\n\n\t“I was just so tickled to be hosting this thing tonight,” Wilson said upon winning the climactic award, assuring the crowd she would’ve been OK with a loss, given what a win her first solo hosting gig turned out to be. After giving her speech, she laughed upon remembering that it was her duty to provide closing remarks for the show, too. “I forgot I was hosting this thing,” she admitted. “Thank you for letting me run my mouth on this legendary stage and celebrate the best genre in the world, country dang music.”\n\n\t“Mama, daddy, look, check it out,” Wilson said while receiving an earlier award. “I wrote this during a time of my life that was constantly changing like a lot of y’all down here. And i just remember being that little 11-year-old girl who would come home from school and pick up my guitar and pour my heart and soul into that guitar, and that’s how I navigated and communicated. And that’s exactly what I did these last two years of my life, when I felt my life was changing but I still felt exactly the same.”\n\t\n\n\tElla Langley was an early leader with three wins out of her six nominations. She and duet partner Riley Green won two categories on the broadcast for their hit “You Look Like You Love Me” — single of the year and song of the year — on top of music video of the year, which was announced prior to the telecast. \n\n\t“This song is the gift that keeps on giving,” said Langley, picking up the song of the year trophy. “How cool is it that a song with talking verses won song of the year? That’s country music,” said Green.\n\n\tZach Top was another big winner early in the telecast, taking the highly contested trophy for best new artist — and in the process, denying Langley at least one prize. \n\n\tThe Red Clay Strays were a surprise winner for vocal group of the year, in the rock-oriented band’s first time being nominated, after a long reign by Old Dominion.\n\n\tCody Johnson also won for the first time in the male vocalist category. He expressed his appreciation for the mainstay in the category, saying “to be in a vocalist category with Chris Stapleton, who’s one of the greatest vocalists of all time in any genre, thanks for paving the way.”\n\n\tLangley, Lainey Wilson and Megan Moroney came in tied with six nominations each, closely followed by Top with five.\n\n\tBrooks & Dunn won vocal duo of the year for a 16th time. “I heard earlier in the night, ‘You ever get sick of this?’ Hell no!” exclaimed Kix Brooks.\n\n\tSteel guitar player Paul Franklin provided what felt like both an inevitability and an upset when he won his first award for musician of the year after being nominated a staggering 33 times since 1989.\n\n\tIn lieu of a comedic monologue, host Lainey Wilson sang a medley of modern country classics, approaching the originators of the songs in the audience — including Brooks & Dunn during a snippet of “Hillbilly Deluxe,” Langley during “You Look Like You Love Me,” Gretchen Wilson on “Redneck Woman,” Lady A on “Need You Now,” Shaboozey on “Tipsy.” When Lainey came up to Little Big Town, they surprised the audience by pulling out mics to take over their song “Girl Crush,” and back on stage, Keith Urban brought out his guitar to jam with Wilson on “Where the Blacktop Ends.”\n\n\tWilson is the sole host this year after co-hosting with Luke Bryan and Peyton Manning in 2024. She joked about receiving texts from both men, including Bryan supposedly cluelessly writing her: “Lainey, what night is the show?”\n\t\n\n\tLuke Combs and Megan Moroney gave the first two full performances of the telecast. Stephen Wilson Jr. got the night’s first standing ovation with a solo acoustic cover of the classic “Stand by Me.” Kenny Chesney also got the audience on its feet with a medley of two signature hits, “American Kids” and “When the Sun Goes Down.” Vince Gill was the subject of a tribute performance by two great voices from inside and outside the genre, Brandi Carlile and Patty Loveless, who joined forces on a Gill song completely in the vein of the most classic country, “When I Call Your Name” (with instrumentalist winner Paul Franklin on pedal steel).\n\n\tHere is a full list of the 2025 nominations, with the winners’ names appearing in bold:\n\n\tENTERTAINER OF THE YEAR• Luke Combs• Cody Johnson• Chris Stapleton• Morgan Wallen• Lainey Wilson\n\n\tSINGLE OF THE YEARAward goes to Artist(s), Producer(s) and Mix Engineer(s)• “4x4xU” – Lainey WilsonProducer: Jay JoyceMix Engineers: Jason Hall, Jay Joyce• “Ain’t No Love in Oklahoma” – Luke CombsProducers: Luke Combs, Chip Matthews, Jonathan SingletonMix Engineer: Chip Matthews• “Am I Okay?” – Megan MoroneyProducer: Kristian BushMix Engineer: Justin Niebank• “I Never Lie” – Zach TopProducer: Carson ChamberlainMix Engineer: Matt Rovey• “You Look Like You Love Me” – Ella Langley & Riley GreenProducer: Will BundyMix Engineer: Jim Cooley\n\n\tALBUM OF THE YEARAward goes to Artist, Producer(s) and Mix Engineer(s)• “Am I Okay?” – Megan MoroneyProducer: Kristian BushMix Engineer: Justin Niebank• “Cold Beer & Country Music” – Zach TopProducer: Carson ChamberlainMix Engineer: Matt Rovey• “F-1 Trillion” – Post MaloneProducers: Louis Bell, Charlie Handsome, HoskinsMix Engineer: Ryan Gore• “I’m the Problem” – Morgan WallenProducers: Jacob Durrett, Charlie Handsome, Joey MoiMix Engineers: Charlie Handsome, Joey Moi• “Whirlwind” – Lainey WilsonProducer: Jay JoyceMix Engineers: Jason Hall, Jay Joyce\n\n\tSONG OF THE YEARAward goes to Songwriter(s)• “4x4xU”Songwriters: Jon Decious, Aaron Raitiere, Lainey Wilson• “Am I Okay?”Songwriters: Jessie Jo Dillon, Luke Laird, Megan Moroney• “I Never Lie”Songwriters: Carson Chamberlain, Tim Nichols, Zach Top• “Texas”Songwriters: Johnny Clawson, Josh Dorr, Lalo Guzman, Kyle Sturrock• “You Look Like You Love Me”Songwriters: Riley Green, Ella Langley, Aaron Raitiere\n\t\n\n\tFEMALE VOCALIST OF THE YEAR• Kelsea Ballerini• Miranda Lambert• Ella Langley• Megan Moroney• Lainey Wilson\n\n\tMALE VOCALIST OF THE YEAR• Luke Combs• Cody Johnson• Chris Stapleton• Zach Top• Morgan Wallen\n\n\tVOCAL GROUP OF THE YEAR• Lady A• Little Big Town• Old Dominion• Rascal Flatts• The Red Clay Strays\n\n\tVOCAL DUO OF THE YEAR• Brooks & Dunn• Brothers Osborne• Dan + Shay• Maddie & Tae• The War and Treaty\n\n\tMUSICAL EVENT OF THE YEARAward goes to Artists and Producer(s)• “Don’t Mind if I Do” – Riley Green (featuring Ella Langley)Producers: Scott Borchetta, Jimmy Harnen, Dann Huff• “Hard Fought Hallelujah” – Brandon Lake with Jelly RollProducer: Micah Nichols• “I’m Gonna Love You” – Cody Johnson (with Carrie Underwood)Producer: Trent Willmon• “Pour Me a Drink” – Post Malone (feat.

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers for “The Man in the Glass,” the series finale of “Murdaugh: Death in the Family,” now streaming on Hulu.\n",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers for “The Man in the Glass,” the series finale of “Murdaugh: Death in the Family,” now streaming on Hulu.\n\n\tWhen it came time for Jason Clarke to finally play out the moment Alex Murdaugh gunned down his wife and son in “Murdaugh: Death in the Family,” he had already listened to and watched countless hours of trial recordings, interview tapes and archival footage of the man pulling the trigger. He had a handle on the animated, colorful man who was always the loudest person in the room.\n\t\n\n\t“He’s got an element of Tony Soprano in him,” Clarke tells Variety. “He’s an entertainer. He’s not the sad clown, he’s the happy clown!”\n\n\n\tYet, even though Clarke embodied the showboat lawyer who saw his South Carolina hometown as his stage, with his neighbors as his audience, the moment Alex kills his wife Maggie (Patricia Arquette) and son Paul (Johnny Berchtold) is devoid of any such showy behavior. He’s subdued and calculated. Clarke worked to master that side of him as well in the UCP series.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney/Daniel Delgado Jr.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“That’s the lawyer in him going to close, going for the kill,” he says.\n\n\tThe scene originally plays out in Episode 6, without Alex in the picture. But as he lies in his prison cell in the finale, he thinks back to the night of the murders, and the scene retraces its own steps from Alex’s perspective. Before they shot the sequence, Clarke talked extensively with co-creators Michael D. Fuller and Erin Lee Carr, director Steven Piet and the crew on the ground in Atlanta about how the scene should unfold and be shot. They knew the beats they had to hit. The scene starts as a mundane set of chores. Maggie’s dog Bubba walks up with a dead chicken in its mouth, causing a conversation that Paul captured on a Snapchat video that placed Alex at the scene, and ultimately sealed his conviction. After that moment passes, Alex steps away to put on  the infamous blue raincoat, grabs two guns, walks up to Paul and shoots him point blank in the chest and then in the head. Then, Maggie comes running, and he shoots her in the leg, the chest and then ultimately twice in the head. It would have happened quickly, and Clarke didn’t want to spend more time in the moment than he needed to either. \n\t\n\n\t“I didn’t really want to do this all night,” he says of filming. “It is not nice pointing a gun at somebody, even another actor in a scene. And there was also the feeling that we get one shot at this, because that’s all he got. It’s messy in its own way, and it’s quick, and then it’s over. We got the feeling of what it was like, and what always struck me was the simplicity of it in the end. We didn’t have a desire to put anything on it that wasn’t really there.”\n\n\tBut it is important and powerful that it’s included in the series at all. After a flurry of documentaries on Netflix, HBO Max, CNN, ABC, NBC and even a two-part Lifetime movie, the tragedy of the Murdaughs, and the casualties they left in their wake, has been dissected relentlessly in the four years since the murders. Yet none of those reports could show, as viscerally as “Death in the Family” does, the murder scene: Alex actually killing his family. It is something that prosecutor Creighton Waters laid out in detail in Alex’s 2023 trial. But seeing it play out with no doubt of his role in it was paramount to Clarke.\n\n\t“That’s the whole point of doing it,” he says of the series. “That’s the point of picking it up. Waters broke it down in the trial in a legal sense. And then, we, as dramatists, broke it down on screen.”\n\n\tHe also had one request for how it should play out: “It was important to me that Paul and I got to lock eyes, because I think that would have happened, even for a second,” he says.\n\n\tThat moment of realization for Paul — something Arquette also has to play out when Maggie rushes up to see her husband standing over their son’s lifeless body — made the entire filming process a somber affair. “Paul seeing it coming with that second shot, and Maggie seeing her son on the ground and knowing the last person she saw was Alex, is horrible,” Carr says. “It was a very quiet night on set when we filmed that.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney/Wilford Harewood\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut for Fuller and Carr, there was also the question of when. When did Alex decide to kill Maggie and Paul? The show can’t answer that, because no one knows. Was it in days or weeks before? Or was it in the moment, as seen in Episode 6, when Maggie tells Alex she doesn’t trust anything he says, or later when he finds mother and son on the porch sharing a tender moment at his expense? \n\t\n\n\t“What we hope these episodes explain is that all these moments could have been when he chose to do it, and Jason plays it so beautifully where he doesn’t give it away,” Carr says.\n\n\tFor Carr, it was the moment when Maggie’s sister Marion (J. Smith Cameron) took the stand and spoke about the premeditation of the crimes that really solidified the timeline. So much so, they put her testimony into the finale.\n\n\t“The most revealing part in the real-life story was when Marion was on the stand, and said that Alex had told her, ‘I think whoever did this had been thinking about it a long time,’” Carr says. ”That struck her as very odd, and for us, as people who’ve studied it and then dramatized it, that’s what I truly believe.”\n\n\tThe series as a whole also had the mission to give more depth and humanity to Maggie and Paul, who, by the time the country knew about the Murdaughs’ many dark secrets, were already dead and couldn’t speak for themselves. Paul, specifically, was also known for crashing a boat while drunk in 2019 and killing teenager Mallory Beach, a legal situation that only exacerbated Alex’s financial and opiate addiction issues. Fuller, who is from South Carolina, fought to adapt reporter Mandy Matney’s “Murdaugh Murders Podcast” as source material, because he wanted to do right by his home state and the people involved in the story. He also wanted Maggie and Paul to be more than the victims in the photos endlessly circulated by the media, and plastered on posterboards in the courtroom, even if their stories are complicated by questions of complicity and wrongdoing.\n\n\t“What we wanted to depict with them is that there’s a complexity to them, and that includes the good things, especially in our version of them,” Fuller says. “The grace and guilt, and trying to search for answers.”\n\n\tOne way of doing that was a speculative scene in Episode 6, right before their deaths, which imagines them sharing a heart-to-heart about why it is not their job to save Alex from himself. Maggie had begun the process of leaving Alex, and only came back into town to support him at his request as his father’s health declined. Paul, meanwhile, had started to accept and process his guilt in Mallory’s death, turning toward his family and his future.\n\t\n\n\t“Here may be a path forward where they can really have that mother-son bond or maybe they wouldn’t have, but whatever it would have been, they were deprived of that opportunity,” Fuller says of the scene, which he co-wrote. “It’s a moment of growth. It’s not a full-blown breakthrough. It’s not a moment where everything makes sense now. But it was a chance to ask what could have been if they hadn’t been tragically killed.”\n\n\tEven though they did want to show the complexity of the Murdaughs’ stories, Carr is clear about how she sees Maggie and Paul.\n\n\t“From my point of view, they were victims of Alex Murdaugh,” Carr adds. “Whether people have feelings about her being a bad mother, or Paul doing what he did, they were murdered in cold blood.”\n\n\tIf anything about Clarke’s opinion of the case changed over the course of production, he says it is because of the show’s commitment to shedding more light on Alex’s victims.\n\n\t“I feel like I know the characters of Paul and Maggie more, and that community more,” he says, noting he quietly visited Hampton before filming began. “Two days after Maggie and Paul were killed, [attorney] Mark Tinsley rang Alex up and said that on behalf of the Beaches, they were going to drop the lawsuit against the family. They didn’t think it was right in lieu of what he was going through, and that really broke my heart. But I admire that as well. It is the human thing to do. It made it all more real, and I cared about everyone more.”\n\n\tClarke still talks in great detail about the case, the trial and his thoughts on the firestorm around the story. If you ask him, he will tell you what mistakes he thinks the defense made in the trial, what shouldn’t have been admitted in the case and what parts of Alex’s testimony on the stand he would have liked to play out in the show. It is clear he isn’t exaggerating when he says he did his homework. While he never wanted to mimic the man completely, he did want to give those who knew the case and felt like they knew Alex something recognizable to latch onto, especially in the finale when Alex takes the stand in his own defense.\n\n\t“We crafted that out to do exactly as he did because it was such a very particular kick off to his self defense,” Clarke says. “He did lean back at that moment, and smacked his lips at another. We tried to time out when he looked at Buster in the audience because he clocks Buster at a very strange time within that. But you come back to it because people have seen this trial and these videos so many times. I’m a big believer that if you hit certain stuff, people will lean more into the stuff we are taking a stab at, for lack of a better word.”\n\t\n\n\tHe took pride in hearing, directly from Matney herself, that someone who knew the real Alex thought they might have taken him out of prison to play himself because Clarke was doing such a good job. But one thing from that immersion in the world of the Murdaughs has stuck with him: The Murdaugh men’s practice of constantly calling everyone “bo” has seeped into the Australian’s own vocabulary since filming, much to the chagrin of people like his son.\n\n\t“My family came with me when we were shooting, and my son just said, ‘Daddy, can you stop saying that, please? I don’t like it.’ Clarke says with a laugh. “I’m out here in Australia right now, and the other day I called a guy ‘bo.’ It’s like ‘mate’ to us, but he just looked at me so confused. I still love that term, I really do.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tChain-smoking and foul-mouthed, Socorro (Luisa Huertas) — a veteran, can’t-suffer-any-fools lawyer — clings to the memory of her dead brother both like a chain that keeps her captive and the engine that keeps her going in “We Shall Not Be Moved,” writer-director Pierre Saint-Martin’s blistering and tightly conceived feature debut. The sound of a helicopter haunts Socorro, who uses hearing aids, either as a bad omen from a distant past or a warning for the tenebrous path she is inching closer to in her restless quest for retribution. In the opening sequence of this black-and-white chamber piece, Huerta’s piercing gaze points directly at the lens, as if Socorro acknowledges the viewer’s intrusion into her microcosm.\n\t\n\n\tCoque, her brother, died at the hands of a soldier during the state-sanctioned student massacre that ravaged Mexico City’s Tlatelolco apartment complex on Oct. 2, 1968. And for the last 50 years, Socorro has been searching for the name of the killer. Documentary footage of the protests that preceded the bloodshed serve as the film’s prologue. Through a perpetually irate visage, the ferocious and magnetic Huertas imbues this woman with a virulent conviction, sculpted from a lifetime of hurt that weighs heavy on her weathered body and tattered soul. Her guilt-driven resolve is all-consuming and pathological. She appears trapped taking meetings with clients in the apartment, as if still waiting for Coque to return. For a while that suspicion convinces her he’s reincarnated as a white dove.\n\n\n\tInside her home, a fortress of folders and documents collected over a lifetime dedicated to attaining justice for others by any means necessary (she’s not above violence or bribery as a means to an end), Socorro interacts with her distressed son Jorge (Pedro Hernández), an unemployed journalist; her daughter-in-law, Lucia (Argentine actress Agustina Quinci); and her estranged sister, Esperanza (Rebeca Manriquez). The outside world enters her purview in the form of playful phone conversation with former mentor, Cardiani (Juan Carlos Colombo), and the visits that Sidarta (José Alberto Patiño), a giddy but loyal pseudo-assistant, pays her. Patino’s charisma counterbalances the sternness of Huertas’ part.  \n\t\n\n\t“Justice in this country is for the rich or those with power,” Socorro, her eyes full of assertive wisdom, tells Sidarta once her brewing bitterness can finally be channeled into action. A package from an old contact reveals the name of the man she’s after. Socorro sets in motion her “eye for an eye” plan, with Sidarta doing her bidding. In this portrait of inescapable rage, Saint-Martin and his co-writer Iker Compeán Leroux shrewdly frame the larger historical tragedy within Socorro’s individual plight — how the events shaped who she’s become and how her relationships continue to suffer from her single-mindedness.\n\n\tEach of Socorro’s human connections feels steeped in a shared history and lightly soaked in acidly comedic undertones, even if the supporting parts enjoy limited screentime. Sidarta acts as a sort of proxy for her real son, who she named after Coque (a nicknamed for those named Jorge), and whom she’s burdened with expectations (or at least that how he feels). And it’s in her motherly friendship with Lucia, especially during a drunken night, that glimmers of Socorro’s personality beyond rancor peak through. The version of herself who loved dancing and enjoyed many lovers hasn’t been completely buried.\n\n\tIn smoky rooms, reflected on a round mirror, or as feathers from imaginary, innocent doves fall around her — in disorienting episodes that stem from her deteriorating health — cinematographer César Gutiérrez Miranda’s camera caresses Huertas’ face like the irreplaceable asset that it is for the film. In both form and tone, Saint-Martin also pays homage to “Duck Season,” another black-and-white Mexican indie set in the Tlatelolco apartments — that one by his former screenwriter teacher and accomplished filmmaker Fernando Eimbcke. (A DVD of the 2004 coming-of-age movie makes a cameo.)\n\n\tIn making a film about the past set in the present, Saint-Martin formulates an indictment on his country’s unhealed wounds, which rather than cauterize with time, remain open since the festering corruption and abuse of power that obscured the truth around the students’ deaths, remains in place. When Socorro calls a judge she once knew to ask for a favor, she blackmails him with unsavory information. Just before hanging up, he reminds her that he’s no longer just a judge, but a magistrate. Not only was he never held accountable for his dubious dealings; on the contrary, he’d been promoted into a higher position in the “justice” system. That Socorro eventually enlists the help of the type of criminals she once swore never to defend, confirms her compromised status. No one here is a blameless “white dove,” but rather more common gray ones, marked by nuanced contradictions.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s a sin to forget those we lost, and we have to do them justice,” Socorro solemnly says to Lucia, when the latter discusses her grandparents’ fate during the Argentine military dictatorship. But can Socorro ever come to accept that it’s as much of an offense to reduce one’s life to grief and fury, to squander it all for the promise of one day inflicting pain on the architects of our dejection? Saint-Martin rejects facile forgiveness, the kind that urges people to turn the other cheek and remain static in the face of transgressions. The path forward, he suggests, is not to absolve the perpetrators or deny the bleakness one has endured, but to keep memory unmovable with all its shades, including those etched in light. Enduring resistance can also look like surviving without succumbing to despair.  \n",

Joe is currently locked up in federal prison in Texas, serving a 21-year prison sentence for a murder-for-hire plot to kill his nemesis, Carole Baskin, and for wildlife violations.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          His new attorney, Peter Ticktin, went to military school with POTUS back in the day, and Joe and Peter seem confident they'll be able to work something out.\n      \n\n          We're told although Ticktin hasn't been in touch with Trump regarding a potential pardon, he feels like he has an advantage because he's gained the trust of the \"players\" involved ... one of those players obviously being Trump.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          \"The deck was stacked against my client who was presumed guilty from the start,\" Ticktin told us. \"This is another innocent man who should be set free.\"\n      \n    \n          We're told Ticktin will be filing for a formal pardon and petition for cert with the Supreme Court for Joe's appeal by Christmas.\n      \n    \n          At the New York Military Academy decades ago, Ticktin served as Trump's platoon sergeant.

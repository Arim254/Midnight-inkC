    "body": "\n\tTunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab” will open the first edition of the Gaza International Festival for Women’s Cinema, which will be held Oct. 26-31 amid rubble in the heart of the Gaza strip.\n\n\t“The Voice of Hind Rajab” screening as the fest’s opener in Deir El-Balah — a Palestinian city roughly nine miles outside Gaza City that has been the scene of major military operations and humanitarian crises — will mark the film’s Middle East premiere. The moving drama, which recently won Venice Film Festival’s Silver Lion Grand Jury Prize, tells the true story of a 5-year-old Palestinian girl who was stranded in a car that was attacked by Israeli forces in Gaza and later found dead.\n\t\n\n\t“I am truly moved that my film ‘The Voice of Hind Rajab’ has been chosen to open the first edition of the Gaza International Women’s Film Festival,” Ben Hania said in a statement on social media. “By hosting this festival in a city still scarred by devastation, the organizers are affirming that cinema can be a form of survival, a way to document pain, and a means to reclaim narrative.”\n\n\n\tThe Gaza International Festival for Women’s Cinema was first announced during the Venice Film Festival by Italian and Palestinian organizers, who at the time planned to hold it online. The festival’s lineup will feature roughly 80 films, including documentaries, shorts and fiction features from 28 countries — all of which tell of the lives, voices and struggles of women, according to a statement.\n\n\tThe honorary president is German filmmaker Monica Maurer, known as a director and producer of works on the Palestinian plight such as the doc “Gaza Hospital.” There are two juries: one for fiction films and one for documentaries. The fiction jury is chaired by French writer-director Céline Sciamma, who is being joined by Moroccan director Mohamed El Younsi, Italian actress Jasmine Trinca, Palestinian writer-director Fajr Yacoub and Algerian actress and theatre director Moni Boualam.\n\t\n\n\tPalestinian director Annemarie Jacir — whose “Palestine 36″ reconstructs the revolt against British colonial rule in 1936 and has been picked as Palestine’s official entry for the Oscars’ international feature film race — chairs the documentary jury alongside Bahraini producer Bassim Al Thawadi, Italian producer Graziella Bildesheim, Kuwaiti director Abdulaziz Al-Sayegh and Cuban film editor Maricet Sancristobal.\n\n\tThe Gaza International Festival for Women’s Cinema is founded by Palestinian filmmaker and cultural events organizer Ezzaldeen Shalh, president of the International Union of Arab Cinema Festivals.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChris Pine is heading to the London stage for the first time, starring as Nikolai Ivanov in a new production of Anton Chekhov‘s classic play at the Bridge Theatre.\n\n\tLondon Theatre Company revealed that the “Star Trek” and “Wonder Woman” actor will lead Simon Stone‘s new adaptation of “Ivanov,” in collaboration with Wouter van Ransbeek. The project marks Stone’s return to the Bridge Theatre, where his production “The Lady from the Sea,” starring Alicia Vikander and Andrew Lincoln, is currently playing.\n\t\n\n\tStone, the acclaimed Australian theater and film director known for his radical reimagining of classic works, is writing and directing the production.\n\n\n\tThe play centers on Nikolai, a man grappling with mid-life malaise despite a successful career and marriage. As debts mount and his wife faces unexplained illnesses, he struggles to understand what’s gnawing at him and whether he can save his marriage, career and will to live.\n\n\tStone is reuniting with his “Lady from the Sea” creative team, including set designer Lizzie Clachan, costume designer Mel Page, composer and sound designer Stefan Gregory, lighting designer Nick Schlieper, and casting director Jessica Ronane.\n\n\t“Chekhov is the master of finding the humor in our suffering and the crisis lurking underneath our joy,” Stone said. “A mercurial magician of character drama, he elevates the seemingly banal to the sublime and then pops the balloon just as it’s getting too poetic.”\n\n\tStone praised Pine’s range and suitability for the demanding role. “After admiring Chris from afar for a long time it was a delight to discover that not only is he a thespian from way back but he’s uniquely sensitive and brilliantly intelligent too,” Stone said. “I’ve seen in his work how hilarious he can be but also how moving: you can’t do Chekhov without both. Ivanov is the most knotty of his male characters, a challenge and a gift.”\n\t\n\n\tPine, whose film credits include “Hell or High Water” alongside his blockbuster work, has U.S. stage credits including “The Atheist,” “Fat Pig,” “Farragut North” and “The Lieutenant of Inishmore.”\n\n\t“I’m delighted to be collaborating with Simon on his new production of Chehkov’s ‘Ivanov,'” Pine said. “It’s been over ten years since I was on stage and to be able to return to it in London at the beautiful Bridge Theatre is a thrill.”\n\n\t“Ivanov” begins previews July 4, 2026 and runs through Sept. 19.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFox Sports will dramatically increase the volume of live FIFA World Cup tournament coverage when the 2026 edition of world’s most-watched sports arrives next summer.\n\n\tFox has committed to airing all 104 games in the five-week tournament live on the Fox broadcast network and the FS1 cabler. All games will also stream live on the Fox One streaming platform and the Fox Sports app. The tournament runs June 11 through July 19 and will stretch across 16 host cities in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, including Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Seattle and San Francisco.\n\t\n\n\t“Fox Sports’ presentation of FIFA World Cup 26 is going to be the biggest production in our company’s 32-year history, and we couldn’t be more excited to showcase this once-in-a-lifetime event with more matches on broadcast television than ever before,” said Eric Shanks, CEO and executive producer of Fox Sports. “The largest World Cup ever means this is going to be a television event unlike any other with more teams, superstars, storylines and moments that will captivate audiences everywhere.”\n\n\n\tIn total Fox plans to serve up 340 hours of World Cup-related programming during the tournament — 100 hours more than it produced during the previous World Cup tournament in 2022. The 2026 round will mark Fox Sports sixth time as the exclusive English-language TV rights provider of World Cup coverage in the U.S. NBCUniversal’s Telemundo has Spanish-language rights for the U.S. \n\n\tThe U.S. Men’s National Team Group Stage matches will be held June 12 (Los Angeles), Friday, June 19 (Seattle) and Thursday, June 25 (Los Angeles). The full broadcast schedule will be announced following the FIFA World Cup 26 Final Draw, which is set to air live Dec. 5 on Fox from the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\t\n\n\t(Pictured: Players for the U.K.’s Chelsea F.C. exult at the FIFA Club World Cup Final match against Paris Saint-Germain at MetLife Stadium on July 13 in East Rutherford, N.J.)\n",

    "body": "\n\tCharlie Heaton (“Stranger Things,” “The Souvenir Part II,” “The New Mutants”) and Mia Wasikowska (“Bergman Island,” “Club Zero,” “Alice in Wonderland”) are set to star in romantic comedy “Twice Over,” which Athens-based boutique sales company Heretic has boarded for international sales.\n\n\tThe feature, directed by Alena Lodkina, is an Australian production set to shoot on location in Perth at the end of this year. The film is in pre-production and is supported by Screen Australia. It is described as “an intimate, quietly offbeat story of reconnection and emotional reckoning.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film, co-written by Lodkina with Miles Allinson, follows two people whose unexpected reunion stirs long-buried feelings and unspoken uncertainties about love, time and reinvention.\n\n\n\t“Twice Over” has been cast by BAFTA and Emmy award winning casting director Shaheen Baig (“Adolescence,” “Black Mirror”).\n\n\tAcclaimed cinematographer J-P Passi, whose work includes “Compartment No. 6,” “The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Mäki,” “The Last of Us” and “Chernobyl,” is attached to the project.\n\n\tLodkina’s previous features – “Strange Colours” (Venice Biennale College at the Venice Film Festival, 2017) and “Petrol” (Locarno Film Festival, 2022; New Directors/New Films 2023) – “established her as one of the most original voices in contemporary Australian cinema, praised for her distinctive blend of realism, mystery and emotional precision,” Heretic said.\n\n\t“ ‘Twice Over’ brings together two extraordinary talents in Mia Wasikowska and Charlie Heaton, whose chemistry promises to be electric under Alena Lodkina’s daring direction,” said Ioanna Stais, head of sales and acquisitions at Heretic. “We’re thrilled to be working with such a remarkable team and to introduce this project to the international market.”\n\t\n\n\tDirector of narrative content, Louise Gough, said, “ ‘Twice Over’ is an exploration of the past and the present converging and in the hands of Alena Lodkina, a singular work. This tender, wry and thought-provoking story offers a different perspective on looking for love, regret and the ‘what if’ of it all. Sharp, deeply nuanced, fresh – ‘Twice Over’ is a modern love story.”\n\n\t“Twice Over” is produced by Kate Glover and Nathan Lewis for Never/Sleep Pictures, Aidan O’Bryan for WBMC and Gregory Jankilevitsch for Mid-March Media. Glover previously collaborated with Heretic on Rebecca Lenkiewicz’s “Hot Milk” (Berlinale Competition) and Romain Gavras’ “Sacrifice” (TIFF Special Presentations), with Mid-March also involved in “Sacrifice.”\n\n\tThe film will receive major production investment from Screen Australia, in association with Screenwest and Lotterywest. It is being executive produced by Klaudia Smieja, Rebecca Lenkiewicz, Samantha Lang, Lee Hazeldene, Ioanna Stais and Giorgos Karnavas. \n\n\tHeaton is repped by Gersh Agency, Independent Talent Group, Brillstein Entertainment Partners, and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern. Wasikowska is repped by RGM Artists, WME and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBefore Ben Stiller made his mark on film, television and comedy, his parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, were an unstoppably uproarious duo. Over a joint career that spanned five decades, Stiller and Meara collaborated on several television shows, TV specials and recordings, making America laugh up until their respective deaths in 2020 and 2015. Now, Ben Stiller is further cementing their legacy by donating their career archive to the National Comedy Center ahead of the release of his documentary film “Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost” on Apple TV.\n\t\n\n\tStiller and Meara curated the archive themselves, preserving public and personal artifacts from their long careers and private lives. It contains artifacts from early improv sessions at Chicago’s Compass Players, love letters that they exchanged while dating, and handwritten drafts of iconic sketches that made it onto world famous stages, among them “The Ed Sullivan Show,” “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson” and “The Carol Burnett Show.”\n\n\n\t“Knowing my parents’ body of work is preserved at the National Comedy Center means a great deal, because the material they left behind was not just a gift for my family, but for anyone who wants to understand comedy as a creative process,” Stiller said of the donation. “They would have been very proud to know that the National Comedy Center is bringing their archive to life in a way that can inspire and educate future generations.”\n\n\tHead of the National Comedy Center’s archive Dr. Laura LaPlaca adds, “Stiller and Meara’s archive contains tens of thousands of pages spanning a remarkable body of work. Their comedy was crafted to feel organic, but they were serial editors – sometimes carrying a single sketch across decades of iteration and refinement.”\n\t\n\n\tThe donation comes in tandem with the release of “Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost.” Directed and produced by Ben Stiller, the doc chronicles his parent’s personal, professional and creative partnership and the lasting impact they had on American comedy. The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on Oct. 5 and releases on Apple TV on Oct. 26.\n\n\tSelect pieces of the Stiller & Meara archive will be on display at the National Comedy Center’s facility in Jamestown, N.Y.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOne couple was changed for good during “Dancing With the Stars” Wicked Night.\n\n\tThe Oct. 21 episode welcomed director John M. Chu as the guest judge as pairs danced to hit songs from “Wicked” — with some taking on Elphaba and some taking Glinda.\n\n\tThis week’s scores were combined with last week’s dedication night. Last week, Carrie Ann Inaba recieved a bit of backlash for her criticism on certain pairs, but this week, she gave the first 10 of the season. The score came for Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas’ quickstep. The other judges, with the exception of Derek Hough who went with a 9, agreed with Inaba. At the end of the night, Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sousa also received three 10s and one nine — Hough is saving his 10 paddle — for their stunning rumba.\n\t\n\n\tHough pointed out after Andy Richter and Emma Slater’s jazz routine that it’s the last week, “so we’ll see,” and ultimately gave him a 6. The other judges, however, were more impressed, with the rest giving him 7s.\n\n\n\tLast week, Inaba told Danielle Fishel and Pasha Pashkov that their dances were starting to look the same. This week, she applauded Fishel’s courage and said this was her breakthrough dance. Bruno Tonioli said it was “the most difficult song to choregraph” and Hough complimented the difficulty of the routine, calling it “magnificent.” The scores of four 9s gave them a huge boost on the leaderboard. \n\n\tBut it was Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten’s contemporary routine to “Defying Gravity” that left everyone (including Bersten) in tears and on their feet. “I am 54, I am injured and I just did that,” she said after the dance through tears. She landed four 9s for the powerful routine.\n\t\n\n\tAfter all the dances and the scores combined from the last two weeks, Richter remained on the bottom of the leaderboard, with Leavitt returning to the top. Once the votes were added in — the show hit 100 million votes over the last two weeks —  Scott Hoying was sent home.\n\n\tHere’s a full list of scores from Wicked Night:\n\n\tScott Hoying and partner Rylee ArnoldDance: Contemporary to “The Wizard And I”Score: 28/40\n\n\tAlix Earle and partner Val ChmerkovskiyDance: Jazz to “What Is This Feeling?”Score: 35/40\n\n\tRobert Irwin and partner Witney CarsonDance: Jazz to “Dancing Through Life”Score: 36/40\n\n\tWhitney Leavitt and partner Mark BallasDance: Quickstep to “Popular”Score: 39/40\n\n\tDylan Efron and partner Daniella KaragachDance: Rumba to “I’m Not That Girl”Score: 32/40\n\n\tAndy Richter and partner Emma SlaterDance: Jazz to “One Short Day”Score: 27/40\n\n\tElaine Hendrix and partner Alan BerstenDance: Contemporary to “Defying Gravity ”Score: 36/40\n\n\tJen Affleck and partner Jan RavnikDance: Foxtrot to “As Long as You’re Mine”Score: 32/40\n\n\tDanielle Fishel and partner Pasha PashkovDance: Argentine Tango to “No Good Deed”Score: 36/40\n\n\tJordan Chiles and partner Ezra SosaDance: Rumba to “For Good”Score: 39/40\n\n\tThe next “Dancing With the Stars” episode will be Halloween night, airing Oct. 28 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC and Disney+, streaming the next day on Hulu.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKevin O’Leary delivered one of his first promotional plugs for A24’s “Marty Supreme” in typically business-minded fashion. The investor and “Shark Tank” host, who gives his debut feature film acting performance in the upcoming Timothée Chalamet vehicle, suggested that movies like his own could “save millions of dollars” by replacing background actors with AI-generated stand-ins.\n\n\tIn an interview on the Oct. 16 episode of The Hill’s “World of Travel: The Podcast,” O’Leary discussed his own investments in AI and used “Marty Supreme” as an example to discuss the technology’s potential implementation in the film industry.\n\t\n\n\t“Almost every scene had as many as 150 extras. Now, those people have to stay awake for 18 hours, be completely dressed in the background. [They’re] not necessarily in the movie, but they’re necessary to be there moving around. And yet, it costs millions of dollars to do that,” O’Leary said. “Why couldn’t you simply put AI agents in their place? Because they’re not the main actors. They’re only in the story visually. [You could] save millions of dollars, so more movies could be made. The same director, instead of spending $90 million or whatever he spent, could’ve spent $35 million and made two movies.”\n\n\n\tO’Leary also brought up the topic of Tilly Norwood, an AI “actress” unveiled via a comedic sketch at the Zurich Summit in September, with claims that Hollywood agencies were seeking to sign it. SAG-AFTRA swiftly issued a statement condemning the nascent product, saying it is “jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.”\n\t\n\n\tIn his comments to The Hill, O’Leary erroneously referred to Tilly Norwood as “Tilly Norwell.”\n\n\t“She’s 100% AI. She doesn’t exist. But she’s a great actress. She can come in any age you want. She doesn’t need to eat, so she works 24 hours a day. The union is going out of their mind,” O’Leary said.\n\n\tO’Leary continued by bringing up The Velvet Sundown, a moniker that releases AI-generated music. Again, O’Leary made an erroneous reference, calling the fictitious band “Velvet Sunset.”\n\n\t“Velvet Sunset is a band that’s on the top 10% of all downloads right now. And it’s complete BS. They don’t exist. It’s just AI music,” O’Leary continued. “It’s coming. You can’t stop the advancement of technology, so I’m spending a lot of time investing.”\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” carries a production budget north of $60 million, making it A24’s most expensive feature ever. The film is a 1950s period piece that stars Chalamet as a rising, unshakably ambitious ping-pong prodigy. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his love interest, while O’Leary plays the husband to Paltrow’s character. It releases in theaters on Christmas Day.\n\n\t“I’d argue, for the sake of the art, you should allow [AI] in certain cases. An extra is a really good case, because you can’t tell the difference,” O’Leary continued. “You just put 100 Norwell Tillies in there and you’re good.”\n\n\tO’Leary also noted that he is using AI to make a facsimile of himself, and that he is seeking full citizenship in the United Arab Emirates as the industry grows abroad.\n\n\t“We’ve got AI Kevin now and we did it in Abu Dhabi. I’m going back there in a couple weeks. I’m going to train the model even more,” O’Leary said. “The challenges with AI is most people can distinguish now between what’s fake and what’s real, because of the voice. But there’s another iteration of the model coming in about a week — that’s how fast it’s advancing. This next AI Kevin, you will not be able to tell the difference.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tWith a near-total re-imagining of its source material, Michelle Garza Cervera’s “The Hand That Rocks The Cradle” layers contemporary political theme",
    "body": "\n\tWith a near-total re-imagining of its source material, Michelle Garza Cervera’s “The Hand That Rocks The Cradle” layers contemporary political themes atop Curtis Hanson’s original 1992 domestic thriller, about an uncanny nanny invading the sanctity of the American home. The remake, releasing directly to Hulu, turns the structure of Amanda Silver’s original screenplay inside out, introducing a mystery element to its antagonist’s motives and imbuing the eerie saga with sensibilities that threaten to blossom into delightfully lurid camp. Unfortunately, the piece ends up laid low by a climax that peters out by taking itself too seriously, but the film’s totality is still made worthwhile by its central performances.\n\t\n\n\tPenned by Micah Bloomberg, the 2025 version opens with a harrowing flashback of a young blonde girl watching a housefire ravage a family, before the movie hard-cuts to two blonde adults in the modern day, racking focus between them but obscuring the exact connection between past and present. Unlike the original, which had its inciting incident take place during the story’s telling, Garza Cervera’s version plants the seeds for a much deeper connection between the desperate au pair Polly (Maika Monroe) and the pregnant corporate lawyer whose pro bono help she seeks for a landlord dispute, Caitlyn Morales (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Polly, who drops hints about her past work raising children, harbors a discomforting, subdued melancholy beneath her personable demeanor, which tipping off viewers to the fact that her intentions may not be all that they seem.\n\t\n\n\tMonths later, after Caitlyn has given birth to her second child, a seemingly chance encounter at a farmer’s market leads to her hiring Polly as a nanny. Polly is charged with caring for Caitlyn’s new baby, Josie, and her ten-year-old daughter Emma (Mileiah Vega), as the husband Miguel (Raúl Castillo) is distracted with various meetings. Polly seems like the perfect fit, firmly on the same page as Caitlyn when it comes to her distinctly modern parenting idiosyncrasies about trans fat and the likes. In fact, she’s too good to be true — a fantasy that slowly unravels in ways that make Caitlyn question her sanity.\n\n\tAs in Hanson’s original, the camera makes us privy to the various methods by which Polly subtly gaslights Caitlyn, exerting an increasing amount of control as she worms her way into her life (and her sleek modernist home) while earning Emma and Miguel’s trust. The major difference, however, is that the “why” of it all is something we’re left to unravel alongside Caitlyn, as well her bougie best friend Stewart (Martin Starr) who tries to protect her.\n\n\tThis simmering plot is made all the more magnetic by a brand-new queer subtext. On one hand, Polly tries to lure Caitlyn’s gaze, making her wonder if she’s happy in her heterosexual marriage; both women are out of the closet, but the target in turn becomes Caitlyn’s relatively traditional domesticity. On the other hand, and in tandem with the aforementioned advances, Polly also leads Caitlyn to believe she might be having inappropriate conversations — or something more sinister — with her eldest daughter, who boldly expresses burgeoning questions about her gender and sexuality, thus inducing conservative fears of LGBTQ predation (a similarly conservative fear of Black men as predators was a key point in the original). This makes for a wildly alluring and distinctly charged flip to the original story, and helps induce more subtle horrors for Caitlyn; she’s left to interpret things, rather than discover them, sending her tumbling into a grey area of uncertainty.\n\n\tWinstead’s overly cautious mother fights to maintain the lavish façade she’s created with her husband — which plays into themes of how wealth protects people, granting the destitute Polly an empathetic class position even before we know her story. Until that point, Monroe carries her character with a festering sadness, making Polly all the more interesting to watch as she subtly manipulates Caitlyn from the shadows. \n\t\n\n\tAlso, it must be said that Vega turns in remarkable work as a bitter adolescent who doesn’t receive the attention she wants (or needs) from her mother at a time in her life when she most needs it. It’s a performance that might bring to mind a young Jenna Ortega. The cast is phenomenal, and Garza Cervera (thanks to Jo Willems’ focused cinematography) captures them through refractions and reflections throughout the setting’s glass exteriors, making them feel discombobulated in service of crafting psychological tension and a suitably gloomy atmosphere.\n\n\tWith all these pieces in play, the result ought to be a surefire hit, but there’s also a hesitancy to “The Hand That Rocks The Cradle” that prevents it from going full-tilt. The fears with which it toys are, eventually, dropped onto the premise in the form of enormous reveals expressed not through action, but thuddingly literal dialogue. Although Winstead and Monroe are immensely capable at making exposition intriguing, the nature of the film’s final act lets the air out at least a little (despite plentiful bloodshed), leading to a conclusion that cuts off right as things begin to escalate. It’s a fantastic build without much by way of release — whether delicious or cathartic — which can’t help but point toward creative hesitancy.\n\n\tThe film’s various social themes are serious, or important, or insert-your-own-buzzy-label-here. But for the most part, they fuel a pulpy melodrama about “a woman gone mad” (i.e. a woman made to question her sanity). This premise certainly walks a retrograde line, but it ends up pulled from the brink — not by thoughtful subversion or some unique formalism from a more enlightened perspective, but rather by pumping the brakes and explaining the story’s most unpleasant aspects in words. It’s the morally correct view on the vicious immoralities the story reveals. But gosh, the movie’s final act is just no fun to watch, despite its promising operatic delights.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndia’s Dharamshala International Film Festival will return to the Himalayan foothills for its 14th edition, opening with Neeraj Ghaywan’s “Homebound” and closing with Anuparna Roy’s Venice prizewinner “Songs of Forgotten Trees.”\n\n\tRunning from Oct. 30 to Nov. 2 at the Tibetan Children’s Village in Upper Dharamshala, DIFF has established itself as one of India’s premier showcases for independent cinema, drawing global filmmakers and audiences to its non-competitive platform.\n\t\n\n\tGhaywan’s “Homebound,” adapted from a 2020 New York Times article by Basharat Peer, follows two childhood friends from a North Indian village who aspire to become police officers. The film, which debuted at Cannes, explores how mounting pressures strain their friendship as they pursue respect and opportunity.\n\n\n\tThe festival continues its partnership with Sydney Film Festival, welcoming two Australian films and their filmmakers: Emma Hough Hobbs and Leela Varghese’s queer sci-fi “Lesbian Space Princess” and Gabrielle Brady’s “The Wolves Always Come at Night,” Australia’s Oscar submission.\n\n\tProgramming highlights include Bhutan’s Oscar entry “I, The Song” by Dechen Roder; Rohan Parashuram Kanawade’s Sundance Grand Jury Prize winner “Cactus Pears”; Rich Peppiatt’s Irish-language “Kneecap“; and Raoul Peck’s documentary “Orwell 2+2=5.”\n\n\tThe lineup also features Spanish director Carla Simón’s “Romeria”; Hlynur Pálmason’s Cannes entry “The Love That Remains”; Sara Khaki and Mohammadreza Eyni’s “Cutting Through Rocks”; Prabhash Chandra’s “Alaav”; Kunsang Kyirong’s “100 Sunset”; and Tannishtha Chatterjee’s Busan-debuting “Full Plate,” starring Kirti Kulhari and Sharib Hashmi.\n\t\n\n\tThe festival will host a masterclass with acclaimed Indian filmmaker Kiran Rao. Actor Adil Hussain will deliver a masterclass on how actors can inhabit characters authentically across diverse cultural contexts.\n\n\tClosing night belongs to Anuparna Roy’s “Songs of Forgotten Trees,” which won the Horizons award for best director at the Venice Film Festival earlier this year. The Mumbai-set drama follows a migrant actor and sex worker who sublets her apartment to a call-center worker, forming a fragile bond.\n\n\tProgramming director Bina Paul has curated a lineup that includes Andrey Tarkovsky’s son Andrey A. Tarkovsky presenting the documentary “Andrey Tarkovsky: A Cinema Prayer” in person, featuring rare archival footage of the legendary Russian filmmaker. He will talk about the work and legacy of his father. \n\n\tDharamshala is best known internationally as the seat of the Dalai Lama, who has been based there since being exiled from Tibet in 1959. The festival directors Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam are filmmakers in their own right. Their chronicles of the Tibetan condition including 2005’s “Dreaming Lhasa,” 2010’s “The Sun Behind the Clouds: Tibet’s Struggle for Freedom” and 2018’s “The Sweet Requiem” have received considerable festival play, including at Toronto and San Sebastian. The pair’s last venture, one of the shorts in Tibetan anthology film “State of Statelessness,” premiered at Busan in 2024.\n\n\t“We never set out to become one of the most prominent independent festivals in the country. We simply believed that meaningful cinema deserved a home in the mountains,” say Sarin and Sonam. “DIFF has grown organically over 14 years — not through flash or hype, but through the passion of filmmakers, the trust of our audiences, and the community that returns year after year.”\n\n\tDIFF remains deliberately non-competitive, prioritizing dialogue over awards. The festival credits tech partner PictureTime’s inflatable digital theaters with bringing independent cinema to the remote mountain location.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJAFF Market 2025 has unveiled its second edition lineup for the JAFF Future Project, featuring 10 fiction and documentary titles spanning the Asia-Pacific region. The selection showcases a roster of established and emerging filmmakers whose works reflect the region’s evolving narratives and cross-border collaboration potential.\n\n\tSet to run Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, the initiative is part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival (JAFF). The Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution.\n\t\n\n\tAmong the notable names in this year’s lineup are acclaimed Korean director Park Kiyong, who returns to filmmaking with “Ghost Island,” produced by Ho Yuhang. Ho’s own project “The Silent Village” captured two prizes at last year’s Future Project. Indonesian filmmaker Eddie Cahyono follows up his award-winning feature “Siti,” which screened at Telluride, with “My Mother.” Australian director Aaron Wilson, whose films “Canopy” and “Little Tornadoes” played the international festival circuit, presents “Under the Banyan Moon.”\n\n\n\tThe selection process drew from an open call held Aug. 1-Sept. 1, attracting submissions from across the region. A selection committee comprising filmmaker-comedian Ernest Prakasa, producers Fauzan Zidni and Tia Hasibuan evaluated projects based on storytelling strength, creative vision, feasibility and market readiness.\n\n\tFor the second consecutive year, JAFF Future Project has renewed its partnership with the Adelaide Film Festival and Mylab, extending pathways for creative exchange between Asia and Australia.\n\t\n\n\t“In this second-year partnership, we continue to open pathways for filmmakers across Asia and Australia to engage in meaningful exchange in sustaining the region’s independent film ecosystem,” said Mat Kesting, chief executive and creative director of the Adelaide Film Festival.\n\n\tLorna Tee, JAFF Market advisor and Mylab curator, added: “Together with JAFF Market’s commitment to supporting early-stage projects, we are helping build a more connected creative landscape across the Asia-Pacific.”\n\n\tThroughout the three-day market, participating filmmakers will present their works in curated pitching sessions and one-on-one meetings with producers, investors and industry partners. \n\n\tSelected participants will compete for awards totaling more than $74,000 in cash and production support. Cash prizes include the Visinema Awards ($3,000 for two projects) and The United Team of Arts Awards ($6,000 for one project). Production and post-production packages include the Brandlink Awards ($30,000 in equipment facilities for two projects), Kongchak Awards (sound design facility valued at $10,000), White Light Awards (color grading and mastering valued at $15,000) and Prodigihouse Ecosystem Awards (editing and color grading valued at $10,000).\n\n\t“Our selection process goes beyond curating stories,” said Linda Gozali, market director of JAFF Market. “It’s about identifying creators who can inspire new partnerships and push their projects toward realization. Through JAFF Future Project, we see this as a long-term investment in creative infrastructure, one that connects filmmakers to international networks, development labs and co-production partners, ensuring that promising ideas don’t remain on paper but evolve into impactful works.”\n\n\tThe initiative’s impact is already visible in its alumni success. “Pangku” (On Your Lap), the directorial debut of Indonesian actor Reza Rahadian, emerged from last year’s Future Project after winning the White Light Post-Production Award. The film was selected for HAF Goes to Cannes at the Marché du Film and earned four major awards at the 2025 Busan International Film Festival.\n\n\tJAFF Market 2025 is powered by Amar Bank.

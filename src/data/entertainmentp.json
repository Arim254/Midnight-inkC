    "body": "\n\tDame Helen Mirren was honored with the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille Award during “Golden Eve” on Thursday evening, a kickoff show to Sunday’s Golden Globes ceremony.\n\n\tHarrison Ford served as the presenter for the honor, a perfect selection due to their longstanding relationship. The pair first worked together in 1986’s “The Mosquito Coast.” They then reunited nearly 40 years later for Taylor Sheridan’s “1923.”\n\n\n\tDuring his introduction, Ford said that when thinking of Mirren, “the word that comes to mind is not Dame — it’s badass.”\n\t\n\n\t“Helen Mirren can play a badass because she is one,” he continued. “A badass is raw, authentic, formidable, tough and fearless. That pretty much describes Helen the woman, and Helen the artist, an undeniable screen presence who brings to every scene a powerful commitment to narrative and character, and when she goes full badass, it’s awesome to watch.”\n\n\tAfter a montage of her work played on screen, he continued. “She’s been the Queen of England on screen, but she is truly majestic in everything that she does. And I for one,” he said, backing away from the microphone and bowing down. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHarrison Ford and Helen Mirren in “The Mosquito Coast”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMirren has won three Golden Globes during her illustrious career, but it was the first two she called out early on in her acceptance speech.\n\n\t“This organization has held a little piece of my heart, as it was the very first organization in America to give me an award. As eccentric as that group was, they noticed a small piece called ‘Losing Chase’ that was way under the radar, and gave me a beautiful golden ball. Then they followed it with another, and I was the proud owner of two large balls, which, as you can imagine, really helped me in my career,” Mirren told the room, which erupted in laughter. “The DeMille Award was described to me as a career recognition, but I prefer to think of it as a life lived, a life survived, a life enjoyed, a life sweated, and a life carried on hopefully. And given that hope, I prefer to think of this as an ongoing reflection of my career, rather than a eulogy. I’m not writing my own eulogy. Although I have to say, if this were my memorial, looking out at this audience, I’m absolutely thrilled who showed up for me, and I am making a list of the no-shows.”\n\t\n\n\tThroughout her speech, Mirren referred to many qualities she admired from the people she’d worked with over the years, including “the wit of Ryan Reynolds, the generosity of Will Smith, the intensity of [Anthony] Hopkins, the embrace of Vin Diesel, the might of Harrison Ford, the kindness of Bruce Willis and the greatness of [Al] Pacino.”\n\n\tShe also acknowledged the many lessons she’d learned — including “how to follow the great advice of the great Victor Mature, which is how to master speaking whilst holding your tummy in. Actually, come to think of it, that advice is no longer needed, is it really now, because you know, Spanx and Ozempic.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOliver Laxe’s “Sirât” is both ambitious and radical, according to the film’s composer and musician Kangding Ray.\n\n\t“Sirât” is Oscar shortlisted across numerous categories, including casting, cinematography, international feature, sound and original score.\n\n\tThe film follows Luis (Sergi López), a father, and his son Esteban (Brúno Nuñez), who arrive at a desert rave in the mountains of Morocco. They’re on a mission – going person to person among the ravers, handing out pictures of Luis’ daughter Mar, who vanished from one of the raves over five months ago.\n\t\n\n\tTheir hope begins to fade, and they trek across the desert to one last party.\n\n\tAmid it all, Ray’s techno score is a character unto itself with the first sonic beats thumping through the speakers for close to 17 minutes. As the characters face danger and the emotional anguish mounts, the score shifts into an ambient vibe. It was that shift that Ray admits was the most challenging to nail down.\n\n\tHere, Ray spoke with Variety about coming on early to the film and scoring music to the script rather than the picture and creating a techno-driven score.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was it about the script that inspired you to be a part of it?\t\n\n\tIt was very clear that it was an ambitious project and also a radical one. This is my kind of film; it works on different levels and doesn’t explain things too much. It really pushes the envelope in many ways.\n\n\tWhen Oliver sent me the script, I was really hooked. I had a few reservations, of course, because I thought he was going very far in certain things, and even for my standards, but I trusted Oliver and his vision.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYour background is in techno and experimental music. Was that the directive Oliver gave you?\t\n\n\tThe film starts with a 17-minute rave. So obviously, the techno element had to be a big part of that. But to me, that part was the easiest part to compose because this is what I do. Finding the right tone and texture was easy.\n\n\tWhen the music dissolves into an ethereal, ambient soundscape and a psychedelic, spiritual journey, that’s where finding the right amount of energy, aggression, violence, and grief, to support the story and to explain things that the dialog couldn’t, was the most challenging part. It was also the most rewarding.\n\t\n\t\tThe score is a character and you feel this shift as it goes from thumping energy to that ambient sound, how did you navigate getting it right and timing it so that transition works?\t\n\n\tWe worked on the pacing many times. The pacing and key were key to making it work. I wanted to have a gradual dissolution, but at the same time, there are a number of shocks happening in this movie. They’re on a trip, and everything is fine, and then something happens and it becomes a nightmare. (The characters enter a minefield, and one of the main characters, Jade, is killed in an explosion).\n\n\tYou need to express those changes, which was the hardest cue to compose. I couldn’t find anything big enough or hard enough or violent enough or wide enough to express what just happened. But eventually, with research, I ended up layering things and made this giant monster that implies the scale of the desert. That’s what brought me back. This is a story of people, but it’s a story which is much bigger than them, it’s a universal story.\n\t\n\t\tWe’ve previously spoken about the sound of the desert and how there are elements of sand and even wind in the score. How did you achieve that?\t\n\n\tThe great thing with working with electronic music is that it’s a very abstract medium. You don’t have a preconceived idea of what you’re going to end up with. I work directly with modular synthesizers, so you select your sound source, and you mix the waveforms. It’s like working with the fabric of the sound itself. It’s not working as like with an instrument where you direct it. The good thing is you don’t put values on what is supposed to be music, and what is supposed to be not music. So all these natural sounds can become a source of inspiration, but also a sonic source in itself.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a beautiful marriage of sound and score in this film. How did you work with Laia Casanova, the film’s sound designer?\t\n\n\tLaia did a lot of recordings, and she had a very puristic approach to recording. She recorded the sounds of the rattles and tried to get the sound of the voices in the rave. She recorded in analog with microphones, and so it became quite easy to blend with the score.\n\t\n\t\tSince you scored the script, did it change much once you saw the film or got scenes?\t\n\n\tA little bit, but we were quite surprised that it was working. Oliver says often that the shoot was a really well execution of the script. Maybe 10 to 20% had to be tweaked or redone. But we had the desert in mind all the time, to give this continuity.\n\t\n\t\tJade has a great line when she says, “music’s not for listening, it’s for dancing.” What does that mean to you as a musician?\t\n\n\tIt’s a great line, because it’s a moment where they realize that they don’t come from the same culture. Luis is frankly annoyed by this type of music. But at that moment when she says this, he says, ‘Oh, that’s what my daughter was always saying.’ At that moment he never he felt really close to her, but he suddenly understands that music has a function. Music was about having a good time or having something harmless playing in the background, but for his daughter and for people of his culture, it’s about something much bigger. It’s something about discovering them yourself on the dance floor with your friends or your community.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Season 2 premiere of “The Pitt,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tThe first season of “The Pitt” too",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Season 2 premiere of “The Pitt,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tThe first season of “The Pitt” took off in a way that nobody expected — but the daunting question then became how to top it in Season 2. Luckily, its star and executive producer Noah Wyle recalls, director/EP John Wells told him and creator R. Scott Gemmill, “You don’t have to be bigger, better, faster, stronger, funnier, bloodier. You just have to be faithful to the characters that you’ve established and say, who are they 10 months on the other side of this mass casualty event?”\n\t\n\n\tFrom that, a new 15 hours, 10 months later, was born. As the shift kicks off at 7 a.m. on July 4, Wyle’s Dr. Robby heads into work for his last shift ahead of a three-month sabbatical, a trip in which he’s set to ride his motorcycle up to Alberta. (He drives it to work helmetless, passing an ambulance on a bridge, in what may be an act of foreshadowing.)\n\n\n\t“It was important to say Robby can’t pretend he doesn’t have a problem anymore,” says Wyle of the trip. “We wanted to show what that looks like when you know you need help, but you don’t really want it. You don’t really know how to ask for it, and what you want is a quick fix and to be told when you’re going to be better. It’s easier to compartmentalize than it is to open Pandora’s box with no guarantees that this is ever going to work. So that was really what I was curious about playing with — that form of denial takes on many faces.”\n\n\tRobby’s motorcycle trip, which his colleagues roll their eyes about, is one manifestation of that denial. “Instead of sticking with therapy, you decide you’re going to go fix up an old motorcycle and take a very romantic, literary journey to go find yourself,” Wyle says. “These are maybe avoidance techniques and maybe therapeutic techniques. And as the season wears on, we start to look at all of these choices and motivations a little bit more carefully for everybody, not just Robby,. I think if I were going to plant a seed in the viewers’ minds, I would say, look at what everybody’s showing you — this is what they want to show you at work right now. This is what we want to present and project as who we are. But whether that is really who we are, whether we can maintain that composure over 15 hours straight, is going to be interesting to see.”\n\t\n\n\tThrowing a wrench into that plan is the new attending physician in the Pitt, Dr. Al-Hashimi (Sepideh Moafi), who will step in to lead the day shift when he’s away. Not only does she have a different way of thinking, but also has no spatial boundaries — something that was very intentional.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWarrick Page/MAX\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“We did want her to be a bit of a close target, but it also dovetailed with this thing I’ve been playing with Robby for since we started — which is that he doesn’t really like being touched. He occasionally will touch somebody else or put his arm around somebody, but when it happens to him, he usually recoils away from it,” says Wyle. “So when you’re put in a situation with a character who has no spatial boundary, and it’s somebody who doesn’t really like to be encroached upon, it physically manifests itself in awkwardness and all sorts of interesting behavior. Dr. Al-Hashimi is a perfect foil for where Robby’s at right now, because he’s going to be giving her his baby to take care of in his absence, and he doesn’t like your parenting style, and that’s really an awkward place to be.”\n\n\tGemmill agrees, and adds: “Robby is trying to distance himself — literally — from her, and she is constantly in his space, so it’s just to make him even more uncomfortable, to up the stakes a little bit.”\n\n\tHer take — she’s “very much into modern medicine, and trying to implement AI into the emergency department,” says Wells — creates “a bit of friction” with not only Robby, but other doctors in the room as well.\n\n\tThe premiere also features Dr. Langdon (Patrick Ball) returning to work after months in rehab after he was caught stealing drugs during last season. Dr. Robby spent the first hour of their shift avoiding him — but that can’t last forever.\n\n\t“For both of their health, sense of closure and peace of mind, they need to get real with each other. Fifteen hours is a very short period of time in which to accomplish something as large as that,” says Wyle. “Fifteen hours is not really that much time for people to radically change an opinion. It’s just enough to plant a seed and start to have it germinate — positive, negative, fearful, tearful, tragic. These are all things that we start in one place, and we get to another, but they’re kind of micro journeys.”\n\t\n\n\tFor the producers, they wanted to display the “realities of recovery” with Langdon’s return and show how it affects everyone involved.\n\n\t“Langdon feels he’s done something, and he’s worked hard at it, and it was difficult. He’s not really expecting a parade, but at the same time, he’s expecting to be acknowledged for how difficult that was and how hard it was on his family — not working and damaging, possibly to his career,” says Wells. “Others are just [thinking], we had to work twice as hard to fill in for you that entire time. In Robby’s case, he was his protege. He loved him and respected him, and felt very betrayed. So I think showing the realities of how difficult recovery is, and at the same time, how you shouldn’t have expectations that everyone’s going to accept you having done that recovery, is very important.”\n\n\tSantos (Isa Briones) and Langdon will also have to work together, eventually, but have yet to communicate since she reported his drug issue.\n\n\t“There’s a lot of hard feelings and unresolved feelings in between those two,” says Gemmill. “She’s trying to be avoidant, partially because she doesn’t know how she’s going to react. Ultimately, he will make an overature, but I’m not sure how well it’s going to be received by her.”\n\n\t“The Pitt” airs on HBO Max Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.\n",

    "body": "\n\tComedian John Mulaney has decided to postpone his shows in Minneapolis scheduled for this weekend in the light of Wednesday’s shooting by an ICE officer. The city has seen large demonstrations after an ICE officer shot and killed a local mother and poet, Renee Nicole Good, during a protest.\n\n\t“What’s happening in your city is heartbreaking,” Mulaney wrote on Instagram. “I hate to postpone shows in a town going through such awful challenges and such grief, because it feels unfair to the audience.”\n\t\n\n\tMulaney is currently touring his “Mr. Whatever” show and will continue Jan. 15 in St. Louis before heading to Seattle, New York and, after the rescheduled Minneapolis dates, on to London.\n\n\n\t“Still, I don’t feel comfortable asking thousands of people each night to leave their homes, gather at the venue, and then make their way home when the situation is so unsafe.\n\n\t“Tickets for this weekend will be honored for their respective days of Friday through Sunday, April 10th, 11th and 12th. For any questions or refunds, please contact your point of purchase or Ticketmaster.\n\n\t“I am sorry to anyone who is disappointed. I know a fun stand-up show could be a nice distraction, but it doesn’t sit right with me to put anyone at risk,” he concluded. \n\n\t“This was the right call,” one fan responded on his Instagram post. Another called on Mulaney to help the effort to get ICE out of Minneapolis, saying, “Please join us all in supporting our community by using your large platform to get ICE out of our city. Maybe once it’s safer, you’ll feel safer performing here again.”\n\t\n\n\tAt a Thursday demonstration against Good’s killing, protesters were met with tear gas, the New York Times reported. While some federal officials described the shooting as lawful, Minneapolis and Minnesota officials called those accounts “propaganda” and “garbage.” Protests in the city against the actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement have been continuing for weeks.\n",

Directed by Obie Award winner David Cormer, the disturbing psychological horror thriller is an intense and unnerving examination of paranoia, love and life-altering delusion. The play stars “The Gilded Age’s” Carrie Coon (who also happens to be Letts’ spouse) as Agnes, a lonely, drug-dependent waitress who spends most of her time sequestered away in the motel room she calls home. An unlikely encounter with Gulf War veteran, Peter (Namir Smallwood), strips her of her sanity. Manic, disturbing and relentless, “Bug” gets under the audience’s skin and remains there long after the final curtain drops.​“Bug” opens in a seedy motel in Oklahoma in the 1990s. Flickers of the time period are made plain through the musical choices wafting through the radio. Agnes is seen stumbling around the motel room in cut-off shorts and a tank top as she alternates between drinking wine and smoking crack cocaine out of a pipe. As her friend and fellow waitress R.C. (a stellar Jennifer Engstrom) looks on, Agnes screens calls from her ex-husband Jerry (Steve Key), who has recently been released from prison. On this particular evening, R.C. has brought along a new friend, Peter, whose unassuming demeanor but intriguing musings fascinate Agnes.​When R.C. is forced to leave early, Agnes invites Peter to stay. What begins as a low-stakes sexual encounter soon becomes a full-fledged relationship, one that devolves as Peter becomes increasingly obsessed with the bugs he claims are overtaking their room. The pair cling to each other over the coming weeks despite R.C’s increasing mistrust of Peter and Jerry’s determination to weasel his way back into Agnes’ life. As the couple grows closer, the audience learns more about Peter’s military past and paranoia as he slowly drags Agnes into his manic delusions.​“Bug” is as intimate as it is intense. The set, designed by Takeshi Kata, drops the audience right into this specific place and time. The lightning, helmed by Heather Gilbert, and the sound, spearheaded by Josh Schmidt, also keep the play tightly grounded, though the production may have worked even better in a smaller theater. Additionally, midway through Act II, there is a shocking set change that reveals just how deep into their psychosis Agnes and Peter have sunk. Moreover, amid Agnes and Peter’s continued descent toward insanity, the story remains convincing because of the characters’ obvious affection and mutual obsession. It’s pretty apparent they are causing each other immense harm. However, their actions stem from a place of love, companionship, humor and understanding, which makes the tale especially heartbreaking.​The performances are also outstanding. From his initial introduction, it’s obvious Peter is off-center. Still, he isn’t outwardly menacing. His musings can be bizarre, but he has a tenderness and earnestness that draw both the audience and Agnes toward him, especially in contrast to the volatile, cruel Jerry. Yet, Coon’s performance as Agnes is “Bug’s” lightning rod. Even though she has not appeared on a Broadway stage since 2012’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf,” fans have gotten to know her as the shrewd and ambitious Bertha Russell in “Gilded” as well as the emotionally vulnerable Laurie Duffy in “The White Lotus.” Coon’s Agnes is a broken woman desperately looking for companionship following the devastating loss of her son and the physical and emotional violence inflicted on her by her ex-husband. Agnes’ longing is at the forefront of Coon’s performance, making it all the more devastating to watch her trade one horror for another.​Despite having a runtime of just under two hours, there is so much packed into “Bug” from isolation to mental illness and the human desire for connection. Though it’s a story set 30 years ago, it shows how easily people succumb to cult-like behavior and conspiratorial thinking, especially when they are looking to fill a void. In the end, the play showcases how an infestation can spread and expand, quickly becoming something too terrifying and monstrous to contain.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGA’s Response to ICE Killing Woman in Minneapolis: She Deserved It\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBillionaires Are Exiting California Ahead of a Possible New Wealth Tax\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRiverside Church Abuse Trial Opens With Dramatic Testimony\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShould Henkel Buy Olaplex?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Maxine Hears a Confession,” the Jan. 7 episode of “Palm Royale,” now streaming on Apple TV.\n\n\tThrough two seasons, and 18 episodes of “Palm Royale,” the single lie that brought years of cheating, stealing, marriages of convenience and in-fighting was finally revealed — Norma (Carol Burnett) isn’t really Norma. And she’s not so evil after all.\n\n\n\tThe episode begins with Vicki Lawrence’s Lotte taking Evelyn (Allison Janney) through a secret passage in the Swiss hotel, where she comes face-to-face with Norma. “Special delivery,” Lotte singsongs their arrival. Evelyn is stunned to see Norma, dressed to the nines, sitting at the end of a very long dining room table. “Leave us, Mama,” Norma says. Yes, mama! Evelyn goes all-in, trashing her, and assuring her that Maxine (Kristen Wiig) is downstairs, waiting pounce on her “with a butterfly net.” But Norma, warm and charming, is confident that Evelyn won’t reveal her secret, saying she returned to Switzerland to put her affairs in order, to seek absolution.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNorma later is stunned to find Linda/Penelope (Laura Dern) in the church. “I thought I’d lost you forever,” Norma says tenderly, fighting back tears. “I’ve been lying so long. Being here, in this room, where I first became someone else, I can be myself again.” She comes clean, saying she is not Norma, but rather Agnea: and she is Linda’s mother. She explains that back in the day, the shame of having a child in society out of wedlock would have destroyed them all, and she couldn’t let that happen — not when there was another way out. “Losing you was the greatest pain of my entire life,” she says mournfully. And now she wants to make it up to her.\n\t\n\n\tSince the show’s premiere in March 2024, Burnett’s Norma has been set up as a money- and status-hungry snob, willing to do just about anything to have others do her bidding and maintain her opulent lifestyle amongst the highest of high society. The legendary Burnett, who is primarily known for her comedic chops, has played it straight. With this plot and character twist, the harsh, joyless, miscreant Norma becomes the repentant, damaged Agnes.\n\n\t“I love the fact that she’s redeemable in the end,” Burnett says in a joint Zoom interview with Vicki Lawrence. “I think it’s because she was able to tell [Penelope] the truth. And once she felt that, and that [Penelope] accepted it, her whole demeanor relaxed and changed. It was fun to have that revealed, that she’s not the villain that everybody thinks she is. But,” she adds, “I love playing villains. They’re much more fun than nice people.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCarol Burnett (Norma/Agnes) and Laura Dern (Linda/Penelope) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Apple TV\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFor fans of the classic TV series “The Carol Burnett Show,” you might have spotted some tidbits about her “Palm Royale” character that you might have assumed were Easter eggs referencing a famous character she played decades ago — Nora Desmond, a parody of Norma Desmond from “Sunset Boulevard.” But those homages were a mere coincidence.\n\n\tThe name Norma was already written into the script, but the origin of the name Agnes is another story. “What’s funny is that when I got my show [in 1967], the CBS vice president didn’t want me to have an hour-long comedy variety show. ‘It’s a man’s game, and it’s not for women.’ And he said, ‘We’ve got this great sitcom that we’d love you to do, called, ‘Here’s Agnes.’ I said, ‘I don’t want to be Agnes every week. I want to have a comedy variety show.’ [“Palm Royale” creator] Abe [Sylvia] remembered that. And that’s why he gave her that name.”\n\n\tAnd that turban that Nora Desmond wore that became her signature look that Norma/Agnes wears in “Palm Royale”? Yep, just a happy coincidence.\n\n\t“Actually, the turban thing came by accident,” Burnett says. “The first season, there was a scene where they went back 20 years. So we would have to be 20 years younger, which would mean I would have to have a new wig made because it was supposed to look different from the present day. They were up to their necks in hairdos and things like that, so I said to the wig maker, ‘Don’t make me a new wig. Just stick a turban on my head.’ It was so great because, I’d go in in the morning, and I’d be ready to go and everybody else would be having their wigs pasted on.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tVicki Lawrence makes a guest appearance as Lotte\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut “Palm Royale”’s most significant nod to the classic variety show is the cameo by Lawrence — Burnett’s longtime costar and friend — who plays the eccentric Lotte.\n\n\t“I knew we were gonna do a second season, and I was getting ready to call Abe and say, ‘Is there anything maybe for Vicki?” Burnett recalls. “And before I could do that, he called me and said, ‘You know, I’m thinking of Vicki for this role. What do you think?’ I said, ‘Oh my God, I was gonna call you.’ He had the idea before I got to it. Every scene that Vicki is in, she steals — I mean, in a great way. It is just wonderful. And the makeup that they used for Vicki was hysterical. I couldn’t stop laughing when you showed up on the set.”\n\n\tLotte’s accent? Lawrence shares that a well-known sex therapist from the past is to be thanked for that. “[Abe] came into the trailer to see how my makeup looked. And I said, ‘How do you see her, uh, other than just old?’ And he said, ‘I don’t know. Some sort of a fun European accent.’ So, you know who my role model was? It was Dr. Ruth. I got on YouTube and looked up Dr. Ruth Westheimer.”\n\n\tLawrence, who won an Emmy for her work on “The Carol Burnett Show” in 1976, continues: “I will say, I learned from someone who just always makes it happen, and that’s a good time. You know what I learned from you, Carol?” she asks Burnett. “The most important thing that I learned is that it all comes down from the top. And you’re supposed to be having fun and more about how the business and show business should run. It should be a good time.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFetty Wap has been released from prison after serving three years of a six-year sentence, his rep tells Variety.\n\n\tThe rapper, whose real name is Willie Junior Maxwell II, also confirmed on social media that he was freed from incarceration. “Home,” he wrote on Instagram Stories.\n\n\tIn a statement shared with Variety, Fetty said, “I want to thank my family, friends, and fans for the love, prayers, and continued support—it truly means everything to me. Right now, my focus is on giving back through my community initiatives and foundation, supporting at-risk young children by expanding access to education, early tech skills, and vision care for young kids and students so they can show up as their best selves. I’m committed to moving forward with purpose and making a meaningful impact where it matters most.”\n\t\n\n\tThe rapper was initially sentenced to six years in prison and five years of post-release supervision back in May 2023 for his involvement in a drug trafficking ring where narcotics were shipped from the West Coast to be sold in New Jersey and Long Island.\n\n\tHe was initially arrested in October 2021 and pleaded guilty in August 2022, facing a minimum of five years in prison. He was serving his sentence at a low-security prison in Sandstone, Minnesota, and was scheduled for release this December.\n\n\tFetty is best known for his smash hits “Trap Queen” and “My Way,” among other hits. While incarcerated, he released the single “Forever (71943509)” in May 2025 and appeared as a guest on Doe Boy’s “Lil Sexy” the following month.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt was a “Sex and the City” celebration when Sarah Jessica Parker was honored with the Carol Burnett Award during “Golden Eve: The Golden Globes Honor Helen Mirren & Sarah Jessica Parker,” which aired on Thursday night on CBS.\n\n\tIn addition to her husband and children, Parker was supported by Kristin Davis, Evan Handler and David Eigenberg, best known as Charlotte, Harry and Steve in the HBO series, two movies, and revival, “And Just Like That.”\n\t\n\n\tDavis took the stage at the Beverly Hilton to honor her costar, getting choked up multiple times during her speech.\n\n\n\t“‘Sex and the City’ has a lot of great themes, but my favorite theme is honoring the importance of friendship, of life, long chosen family, and that’s what you are to me,” Davis said through tears. “It is a joy to be with you in this life and to be here tonight.”\n\n\tDuring the night, two montages showed clips from Parker’s career — the first dedicated to roles other than Carrie Bradshaw, the second all about Carrie. During one clip of her winning a Golden Globe (she took home three acting Globes during the show’s run), both Davis and Cynthia Nixon were shown applauding. Kim Cattrall, who has a long-standing feud with Parker, did not appear. However, later in the montage was footage of the four women walking the streets of New York — an image that fans of the show have cemented into our minds. One person who did not appear was Chris Noth, who played Carrie’s on-again, off-again love, Mr. Big. Noth was removed from the “And Just Like That” finale in 2021 after multiple claims of sexual assault. He denied all claims. Many of Carrie’s other love interests were featured.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristopher Polk\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter a beautiful introduction by her husband, Matthew Broderick, Parker took the stage, and reflected on meeting Burnett. She shared stories about their bond and the importance of the honor. \n\n\t“Like millions of others, I revered Carol Burnett when I was very young. We didn’t have a television so I would call a friend and I would invite myself over on Saturday nights, so I could watch ‘The Carol Burnett Show’ on CBS,” she said. “Carol was a North Star. She was an inspiration. I could not possibly have articulated at age eight or nine, but came to understand my feelings about her as wonderment and idolatry.”\n\n\tShe later brought up “SATC” and her love for the characters created, thanking Casey Bloys and the team for allowing her to have a “permanent residency” at the network.\n\n\t“I met Carrie Bradshaw, Charlotte York, Samantha Jones and Miranda Hobbs, and I spent 25 years with the most glorious ensemble of women and actors, where we treated all of New York like CBS Television City and the streets like studio 33,” Parker said. “I cherish every 15th hour on the set or 16th hour, every walk and talk, looking into your eyes for the hardest and silliest moments. As Kristen once said, ‘You are in my bones.'”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Hollywood unions are penciling in bargaining dates for the coming months, as they prepare to negotiate with the studios about thorny issues like artificial intelligence and health coverage.\n\n\tSAG-AFTRA told members last month that its negotiators will sit down with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers on Feb. 9. Those talks are due to run through March 6.\n\n\tThe Writers Guild of America is expected to begin talks 10 days later, on March 16. The WGA contract expires on May 1, and those negotiations typically go down to the wire.\n\t\n\n\tThe Directors Guild of America is expected to begin its talks 10 days after that, on May 11. The DGA and SAG-AFTRA contracts each expire on June 30. If the SAG-AFTRA talks do not result in a deal before the WGA talks start, there will still be an opportunity to resume negotiations in June before the expiration.\n\n\n\tThe negotiations will be the first since the writers and actors strikes of 2023, and will likely revisit the concerns that animated those stoppages, such as AI and residuals on streaming platforms. Traditionally, the first of the three unionn to negotiate — often, the DGA — has set a pattern for the other two. But that dynamic broke down to a large extent in the last cycle and may or may not return.\n\n\tThe industry has struggled over the last three years, particularly in Los Angeles. Negotiators are expected to focus on items that could boost jobs for members while being wary of jeopardizing a recovery.\n\n\tIn their message to members last month, SAG-AFTRA leaders said they had asked for an early negotiating window in order to give plenty of time to talk, and to avoid threatening “the nascent but much-needed resurgence in domestic production activity.”\n\t\n\n\tThe slowdown in production has also put a strain on industry health plans, which could force negotiators to look into adjusting benefit structures. The AMPTP has begun laying the groundwork on that issue, putting out a five-page report last month showing that guild members get relatively generous health coverage.\n\n\tThe report showed that compared to other large employer-based plans, DGA, WGA and SAG-AFTRA members pay lower premiums, have lower deductibles, and have lower out-of-pocket maximums.\n\n\tThe AMPTP has also floated the idea of a five-year contract — instead of the typical three-year deal — indicating that studios would be willing to pay a premium to buy an extended period of labor peace.\n\n\tThe unions are also expected to renew their push to protect members from the threat of AI. The writers and actors sought in 2023 to protect members’ work from being used to train AI systems. While they won a range of other AI guardrails, they were not able to secure anything on training. Disney’s recent deal with OpenAI — which allows Disney characters on Sora 2 — has heightened concerns around that issue.\n\n\tThe unions and the AMPTP declined to comment on the bargaining dates.\n",

Shireen Afkari had a wild altercation at the popular food spot, Hazie's. After appearing to get cut off from drinks -- reportedly for causing a ruckus -- Shireen was caught on video shouting at and getting physical with employees as well as fellow patrons.\n      \n    \n          After striking one customer, Shireen was slammed to the ground by a restaurant worker ... but that's not who is reported to have been fired. Outside, Shireen was running on the sidewalk, and apparently got tripped by bartender Miguel Marchese ... and Miguel is reportedly the employee who was let go.\n      \n    \n      \n      NEW: Drunk female customer attacks bar staff outside trendy San Francisco restaurant co-owned by celebrity chef Joey AltmanThe unidentified couple had been cut off for being drunk and rudeBartender Miguel Marchese said they were verbally abrasive and difficult with staff… pic.twitter.com/peqhRbKjqY— Unlimited L's (@unlimited_ls) December 16, 2025\n              @unlimited_ls\n          \n  \n\n          Prior to appearing to send Shireen diving head-first into the pavement, Miguel was seen ushering Shireen out of the restaurant. In an act of resistance, Shireen started tussling with him and grabbed his hair.\n      \n    \n          According to the video, it took several guys stepping in to get Shireen off of Miguel, and when she let him go, Miguel headed back towards the restaurant.\n      \n    \n          Shireen ran then after him, and he appeared to trip her.\n      \n    \n          Miguel told SFGate ... \"There were just so many dubious things at play at the moment. I found it odd that I was getting fired when in reality, I did nothing wrong at the end of the day.”\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He added ... “I ask people to put themselves in my shoes. Imagine that not only are you sick with laryngitis, but your hair is being viciously pulled out of your head.”\n      \n    \n          Miguel explained to the publication that managers told him he was now an insurance liability for them because of his alleged actions. He also said that he and other employees filed a claim in December to the Office of Labor Standards Enforcement for alleged wage and tip theft at Hazie’s.\n      \n    \n          According to SFGate, Hazie’s is now reportedly under investigation by the Office of Labor Standards Enforcement.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          As we reported ...

In fact, Hines says she's received six offers for Mickey in just the past two days ... but he's not interested.\n      \n    \n          Despite his financial instability, Hines says Mickey has a lot of pride and wants to be paid like an A-lister if he takes a job ... in the range of $200,000 per day. He's also focused on working with the types of top-tier actors and directors he's collaborated with before.\n      \n    \n          While the offers haven’t hit the number he’s looking for, Hines says they’re still good opportunities alongside talented people. She believes if Mickey focuses on doing quality work, the money will eventually follow.\n      \n\n          For now, Mickey is staying at a West Hollywood hotel with his three dogs. Hines says he’ll be checking out by the end of the week, after she secured him a new Los Angeles apartment. However, if Mickey wants to stay afloat long-term, he’ll need to return to work.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    Instagram/@mickey_rourke_\n          \n    \n          As we reported, Mickey has made it clear he doesn’t want to touch the $100,000 GoFundMe launched to help prevent his eviction. Hines says the money will be returned to donors, though she adds Mickey should recognize people genuinely want to help him.\n      \n    \n          Hines emphasizes Mickey still has the talent and stamina to get back to “being at the top again” -- but the ball is in his court, and it’s up to him whether he seizes the opportunity.\n      \n    \n          Bottom line ... Hines says the coming week will be pivotal for Mickey -- either he takes the work and gets back on his feet, or he risks heading into a downward spiral.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Mickey Rourke\n              \n                          \n                Social Media\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Daryl's wife took a more humor-filled approach to the rumors -- sharing a TikTok where she jokingly looked up all the gossip surrounding her little friend group. However, her new track \"Still Don't Care\" played over the vid and highlighted her true feelings.\n      \n    \n          Worth noting ... Hilary Duff's husband Matthew Koma dove right into the drama while others have tried to avoid it -- seemingly confirming the rumors by mocking the article on Instagram days after it was released.\n      \n    \n          However, don't expect Daryl and Meghan to duke it out publicly with Ashley anytime soon ... because they're clearly done addressing it.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Daryl Sabara\n              \n                          \n                Meghan Trainor\n              \n                          \n                Hilary Duff\n              \n                          \n                Mandy Moore\n              \n                          \n                Ashley Tisdale\n              \n                          \n                Alan Cumming\n              \n                          \n                Social Media\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                celebrity kids\n              \n                          \n                Gossip / Rumors\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Fights & Feuds\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

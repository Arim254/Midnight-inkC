    "body": "\n\tThe seams were showing at times at the first TikTok Awards held Thursday night the Hollywood Palladium and live streaming on TikTok and Tubi. \n\n\tThe show got started almost an hour late because the LED screens on the Palladium’s stage malfunctioned. Presenters and winners soldiered on bravely with a traditional award presentation that felt awkward for the lack of video clips to demonstrate the nominees’ work, although audio of each clip did run. The video clips did run without interruption on the live stream. \n\t\n\n\tThe awards are hosted by La La Anthony. A host of prominent TikTok personalities are participating as presenters and nominees. Popular TikTok-er Ashby made a guest appearance, coming out with “K-pop Demon Hunters” voice star Rei Ami to shoot off a “Labubu cannon” out into the seated crowd on the floor of the legendary Sunset Boulevard venue. \n\n\n\t“I hope you signed your waivers,” Ashby said as she fired off the Labubus.\n\n\tAmong the winners were Paris Hilton for Muse of the Year. Hilton was on hand to accept the trophy in the shape of the TikTok logo. She thanked “all my little Hiltons.”\n\n\tHilton assured the crowd of colorfully dressed creators and influencers, “You don’t need permission to be iconic. Just show up, sparkle hard and don’t forget that everyone is a princess.”\n\n\tAn hour into to the presentation, the large video screen briefly popped back to life with a video image of the TikTok Awards logo set to the soundtrack of the Coldplay song “Yellow.” But it still could not play clips of nominees.\n\t\n\n\tThe crowd was undaunted by the technical snafu. Cheers and shouts were strong from the various cheering sections for nominees.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has greenlit a second season of “Last Samurai Standing,” the Japanese period-action series that has become a global streaming hit since its debut.\n\n\tSet during Japan’s Meiji period in the late 19th century, “Last Samurai Standing” follows 292 samurai warriors who gather at Kyoto’s Tenryuji Temple for a deadly competition with a grand prize of 100 billion yen. The story centers on protagonist Shujiro Saga, played by Okada Junichi, who enters the dangerous contest to save his ailing wife and child.\n\t\n\n\tThe battle royale epic climbed to No. 1 on Netflix’s Global Top 10 (Non-English Series) chart and ranked in the Top 10 across 88 countries. In Japan, the series held the No. 1 position for four consecutive weeks, establishing itself as one of the country’s most popular recent releases.\n\n\n\tThe show achieved a significant milestone as the first all-Japanese production nominated in the best foreign language series category at the Critics’ Choice Awards.\n\n\tOkada serves triple duty on the series as lead actor, producer and action choreographer, working alongside director Fujii Michihito. The production brings together an ensemble cast featuring some of Japan’s most prominent talent, including Yumia Fujisaki, Kaya Kiyohara, Masahiro Higashide, Shota Sometani, Taichi Saotome, Yuya Endo, Yasushi Fuchikami, Jyo Kairi, Takayuki Yamada, Wataru Ichinose, Riho Yoshioka, Kazunari Ninomiya, Hiroshi Tamaki and Hideaki Ito.\n\n\t“I’m pleased to see that ‘Last Samurai Standing’ has reached global audiences and has been confirmed for a second season,” Okada said. “I’m excited to get back into this wild world and once again charge into battle with the production team. We hope to make the next season even more energetic and action-packed.”\n\t\n\n\tFujii added: “I’m very pleased and relieved that ‘Last Samurai Standing’ has been such a big hit outside Japan. I’m also honored to say that the series has officially been greenlit for a second season. There’s no doubt that Season 2 will be even bigger and better than the first.”\n\n\tThe series is based on Imamura Shogo’s “Ikusagami” novel series, which won the 166th Naoki Prize in 2021. Directors Yamaguchi Kento and Yamamoto Toru join Fujii on the project, with Oshida Kosuke serving as producer.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCBS has ordered the pilot “Regency,” from “The Big Bang Theory” and “Young Sheldon” alum Tara Hernandez, to be put into consideration for the 2026-2027 TV season. The multi-camera sitcom, from Warner Bros. TV, is a period piece described as a “historical spin” on the typical family comedy.\n\n\tHere’s the full logline: “A historical spin on the classic multi-cam family sitcom, centered around the upper-middle class Tillbrooks as they navigate life, love, and scandal in 19th Century England.”\n\t\n\n\t“Regency” reps the latest comedy to be added to the Eye network’s laffer development roster, which has been busy in the past few weeks adding new projects to its year-round development strategy.\n\n\n\tAlso in the mix: “Checkpoint,” from Aaron Kaplan’s Kapital Entertainment, set in the world of TSA officers — and starring comedian X Mayo, who created the project with Mike Sikowitz. The network is also developing the comedy “Auntie Supreme,” from CBS Studios and Cedric the Entertainer’s Bird & The Bear Entertainment, about a life coach who decides to co-parent her nieces with her brother-in-law. Gloria Bigelow, Christy Stratton are the writers behind that show.\n\n\tAnd then CBS also has the comedy pilot “Eternally Yours,” from “Ghosts” executive producers Joe Port and Joe Wiseman. That project, about vampires who must accept that their daughter is dating a human mortal, has cast Ed Weeks and Jaren Lewison.\n\n\tThose contenders could join a roster that includes established hits “Ghosts,” “Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage” and freshman entry “DMV.” (Another hit, “The Neighborhood,” will end its run this spring after eight seasons.)\n\t\n\n\tBesides “Young Sheldon” and “The Big Bang Theory,” Hernandez’s credits include writing and serving as a creator on the series “Mrs. Davis” (which she created with Damon Lindelof). She’s also credited as a writer on a feature film in the works based on the animated series “Captain Planet.” In 2023, Hernandez was selected to be a part of Variety‘s “Variety500” list.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTramell Tillman has a message for the LGBTQ community.\n\n\t“We’re being silenced and pushed apart,” the “Severance” star told me Wednesday at the Golden Globes luncheon for first-time nominees at the Maybourne Beverly Hills hotel. “We need more voices, we need more stories, we need more appearances, more presence across the board and not just in this country but around the world. I’m glad to be a part of that movement and do whatever I can to support our community and uplift us, especially the trans community, because we need it.”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “We have each other. We’ll get through it. We will push past this, and we will survive because we always do, and we always have.”\n\n\tTillman previously told Variety‘s Clayton Davis that he first came out to his mother as bisexual when he was in his 20s. Years later, he told her he was gay. “I don’t want this to ruin your career,” she told him. “I don’t want you to be blackballed. I don’t want you to be pigeonholed.” \n\n\tShe had nothing to worry about. Tillman not only became first openly gay Black man to be nominated for an Emmy in the supporting actor drama category for his work in “Severance,” but he was crowned the winner on the big night.\n\n\tComing up for Tillman is a role in “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” opposite Tom Holland. He can’t say much about his part but said he had always hoped to land a superhero movie, but “not this soon,” Tillman said. “I always wanted to be in that world. I used to watch DC Comics and Marvel all the time. To be a part of it is such a gift. I was treated lovely. Everyone was wonderful.”\n\t\n\n\tTillman’s dream project is a movie musical. “I’m not sure in what capacity, but to be able to stretch that muscle would be really fantastic,” he said.\n\n\tHe names “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street” as one of his favorite musicals: “I love the darkness of it. I keep doing projects that are kind of dark and edgy.”\n\n\tThe 83rd Annual Golden Globes will air on CBS and stream on Paramount+ in the United States on Sunday, Jan. 11.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTikTok is nearly to the finish line in the video app’s long trek to becoming legal in the U.S.\n\n\tByteDance and TikTok have signed “binding agreements” with three managing investors: Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi’s state-owned investment firm MGX, to form a new TikTok U.S. joint venture named TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, according to a memo to TikTok staff by CEO Shou Zi Chew reviewed by Variety. The agreement forming the TikTok U.S. joint venture is set to close Jan. 22, 2026.\n\t\n\n\tThe TikTok U.S. joint venture will be 50% held by a consortium of new investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX with 15% each; 30.1% held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance; and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance. \n\n\n\tWith the deal, ByteDance and TikTok will — after nearly a year in legal limbo — come into compliance with the U.S.’s TikTok divest-or-ban law, which prohibits distribution in the U.S. of any app that is more than 20% owned by a “foreign adversary” (in this case, China). \n\n\tThe U.S. law passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support among lawmakers, concerned that ByteDance’s ties to China made TikTok a national security threat because of the risk of spying on Americans or manipulating content in the app. The law went into effect Jan. 19, 2025. However, President Trump has issued five executive orders this year that delayed enforcement of the ban by the Justice Department while the administration tried to broke a deal to transfer ownership to U.S.-based investors.\n\n\tThe agreements specify that the U.S. joint venture will be majority-owned by U.S. investors, governed by a new seven-member majority-American board of directors, and subject to terms “designed to protect Americans’ data and U.S. national security,” per the memo.\n\t\n\n\tOne important element of the TikTok U.S. JV agreement concerns the app’s content algorithm: The new entity will be responsible for “retraining the content-recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data to ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation,” according to Chew’s memo.\n\n\t“I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your continued dedication and tireless work,” Chew wrote in the memo. “Your efforts keep us operating at the highest level and will ensure that TikTok continues to grow and thrive in the U.S. and around the world. With these agreements in place, our focus must stay where it’s always been — firmly on delivering for our users, creators, businesses and the global TikTok community.”\n\n\tOn Sept. 25, Trump signed an executive order that approved the formation of the joint venture and the sale of ownership stakes to non-Chinese investors. According to U.S. VP JD Vance, the agreement valued TikTok U.S. at $14 billion.\n\n\tTrump claimed that tech mogul Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch are among the investors in the TikTok U.S. venture, but their participation has not been otherwise confirmed.\n\n\tOracle, founded by Trump supporter Larry Ellison, already provides data and computing services for TikTok’s U.S. operations. Current ByteDance investors including venture-capital firms Susquehanna International, KKR and General Atlantic are also part of the ownership group.\n\n\tAccording to Trump’s executive order, the new TikTok U.S. joint venture will encompass not only the TikTok app but also ByteDance’s Lemon8 and CapCut applications, as well as “any other application or website duly operated by the new joint venture, and their associated or affiliated websites.” The Trump administration’s non-enforcement of the law was extended until Jan. 23, 2026, more than a year after the TikTok divest-or-ban legislation went into effect.\n\n\tTrump, in the final months of his first administration, tried unsuccessfully to ban TikTok unless its ownership was transferred to U.S. companies, also over national security concerns. After he won the 2024 election, Trump said, “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” because “there are those who say” the app helped drive support for him among young voters.\n\n\tRead the full memo from Chew:\n\t\n\n\tUpdate on our U.S. businessI am pleased to share some great news. We have signed agreements with investors regarding a new TikTok U.S. joint venture, enabling over 170 million Americans to continue discovering a world of endless possibilities as part of a vital global community. I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your continued dedication and tireless work. Your efforts keep us operating at the highest level and will ensure that TikTok continues to grow and thrive in the U.S. and around the world. With these agreements in place, our focus must stay where it’s always been—firmly on delivering for our users, creators, businesses and the global TikTok community. There’s more work to be done as we move towards the closing date of January 22, 2026. Within this timeframe, we will continue to update you on the process and other details. In the meantime, I have outlined key terms of the agreements below. Shou———–ByteDance and TikTok have signed binding agreements with three managing investors, Oracle Corporation, Silver Lake, and MGX, to form a new TikTok U.S. joint venture named TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC. Pursuant to the Executive Order signed by U.S. President Donald J. Trump on September 25, 2025, the agreements specify that the U.S. joint venture will be majority owned by American investors, governed by a new seven-member majority-American board of directors, and subject to terms that protect Americans’ data and U.S. national security. Specifically, the U.S. joint venture will be 50% held by a consortium of new investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX with 15% each; 30.1% held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance; and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance. Through comprehensive security measures, more than 170 million Americans will continue to discover, create, and connect on the platform, enjoying the same experience as today. Advertisers will continue to connect with global audiences with no impact. The U.S. joint venture will be responsible for U.S. data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance. It will also have the exclusive right and authority to provide assurances that content, software, and data for American users is secure. A trusted security partner will be responsible for auditing and validating compliance with the agreed upon National Security Terms, and Oracle will be the trusted security partner upon completion of the transaction. The U.S. joint venture will oversee: \n\n\nData Protection: safeguarding sensitive U.S. user data, which will be stored in a trusted and secure cloud environment in the United States run by Oracle.\nAlgorithm Security: retraining the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data to ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation.\nContent Moderation: ultimate decision-making authority for reviewing and approving all content moderation and related policies within the United States.\nSoftware Assurance: deployment and integrity of the U.S. application software and platform.\n\n\n\n\tThe transaction will be completed no later than 120 days from the date of the Executive Order. Upon the closing, the U.S. joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok U.S. Data Security (USDS) organization, will operate as an independent entity with authority over U.S. data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance, while TikTok global’s U.S. entities will manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.\n",

    "body": "\n\tProducer Neal Moritz has spent the past 15 years trying to reboot “Cliffhanger,” the 1993 blockbuster starring Sylvester Stallone.\n\n\tThe project is finally coming to the big screen next year — but Stallone won’t be in it. And in a new lawsuit against the film’s financiers, Moritz explains why.\n\n\tMoritz alleges that Rocket Science Industries has reneged on an agreement to pay him a $2.5 million producer fee. According to the complaint, Moritz and his partner, Toby Jaffe, spent years lining up talent for the film, and negotiated a deal for Stallone to star as the male lead.\n\t\n\n\tStallone was prepared to shoot the film in the fall of 2023, before the second season of “Tulsa King” went into production, on condition that his fee would be put in escrow — that is, guaranteed up front.\n\n\n\t“But Rocket Science failed to secure Stallone’s commitment to do the Picture because it refused to guarantee Stallone’s fee,” the lawsuit states.\n\n\tThe producers nevertheless created a sizzle reel with Stallone envisioned as the lead, which was used to market the film to sales agents. But with Stallone not confirmed, the director, Ric Roman Waugh, ultimately backed out.\n\n\tMoritz and Jaffe then worked to hire a new director, Jean-François Richet, and brought in a new writer, Melanie Toast, to rewrite the script, as they continued to try to get Stallone to commit to the project, which was pushed back to 2024. But Stallone’s scheduling conflict with “Tulsa King” and the lack of a guarantee meant that he was out, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\tRichet then dropped out, prompting producers Moritz and Jaffe to hire yet another director, Jaume Collet-Serra. They then secured Lily James to play the female lead and tried to get Russell Crowe to replace Stallone. Crowe dropped out. The job eventually went to Pierce Brosnan.\n\t\n\n\tIn May 2024, Moritz and Jaffe were asked to defer all their producer fees. Rocket Science execs explained that they were experiencing budget problems, partly because the loss of Stallone meant lower guarantees for pre-sales in Spain, Latin America and Scandinavia, according to the complaint. The fees for the director and lead cast had come in higher than expected, and the lenders wanted the producers to hold back their fees as a condition of financing the project.\n\n\tThe suit states that Moritz and Jaffe had already warned Rocket Science that they were paying too much for talent.\n\n\t“Although the deferral of producer fees occasionally takes place in connection with making independent motion pictures, it is highly unusual for requests to be made to a producer of Moritz’s stature to defer the entirety of the producer’s fee,” the lawsuit states. “The problem with the deferral of producer fees is not just that the producer gets paid later than he or she was supposed to be paid, but deferral may result in the producer never getting the full agreed-upon fee or possibly not even any portion of the fee.”\n\n\tThe suit, filed in L.A. Superior Court, alleges that the parties have not come to terms, and that Rocket Science has effectively repudiated its agreement with Moritz and Jaffe. \n\n\tRow K Entertainment acquired U.S. distribution rights to the project in September in a reported eight-figure deal.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSony is paying more than a few peanuts to get majority ownership of Charles M. Schulz’s beloved Peanuts franchise featuring Snoopy, Charlie Brown and more.\n\n\tSony Pictures Entertainment and Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) announced that they entered into a definitive agreement with Canadian media company WildBrain to indirectly acquire all of the 41% stake held by WildBrain in Peanuts Holdings LLC.\n\n\n\tSony will pay CAN $630 million to WildBrain for the 41% stake, or roughly $457 million. The closing of the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.\n\t\n\n\tAs a result of the transaction, SMEJ and Sony Pictures Entertainment, together with SMEJ’s existing approximately 39% stake, will indirectly own 80% of Peanuts Holdings LLC, while the members of the family of Charles M. Schulz will continue to own the remaining 20%. The ownership of rights to “Peanuts” and the management of its business continue to be handled by Peanuts Worldwide, a wholly owned subsidiary of Peanuts Holdings LLC. \n\n\tWith Sony taking an 80% stake, Peanuts Holdings LLC (including Peanuts Worldwide), will become a consolidated subsidiary of the Sony Group. SMEJ will take the lead in managing Peanuts Holdings LLC in partnership with SPE.\n\n\t“Since 2018, SMEJ has been proud to be part of the partnership behind ‘Peanuts,’ an iconic global entertainment brand with a 75-year legacy of delighting audiences worldwide,” Shunsuke Muramatsu, president and group CEO, Sony Music Entertainment (Japan), said in a statement. “With this additional ownership stake, we are thrilled to be able to further elevate the value of the ‘Peanuts’ brand by drawing on the Sony Group’s extensive global network and collective expertise.\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “We are deeply committed to carrying forward the legacy of Charles Schulz and the Schulz family. Together with SPE, and backed by WildBrain’s continued partnership, we will continue to embrace new opportunities to ensure that ‘Peanuts’ remains a relevant and beloved presence across generations—reaching new audiences and sharing the timeless charm of the ‘Peanuts’ gang for years ahead.”\n\n\tSince acquiring an interest in Peanuts Holdings in 2018, SMEJ said, it has focused on expanding the “Peanuts” IP business while maintaining and further building a positive relationship with the Schulz family. The company said it aims to continue to use its expertise in the character business — and the extensive network of the Sony Group — to “drive further growth of the Peanuts IP business and enhance the brand’s value.”\n\n\tRavi Ahuja, president and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said, “‘Peanuts’ is enduring and iconic. We value the deep collaboration we have with our SMEJ colleagues and look forward to building on their meaningful partnership with WildBrain and the Schulz family. With our combined strengths, we have the unique capability and extraordinary opportunity to protect and shape the future of these beloved characters for generations to come.”\n\n\tJosh Scherba, president and CEO of WildBrain, commented, “Sony has been an excellent partner on the ‘Peanuts’ brand for many years, and we’re confident that Charlie Brown, Snoopy and the gang are in good hands with them. We’d like to thank the Peanuts Worldwide team, as well as the Schulz family, for their incredible collaboration, and we look forward to working with them and Sony going forward to continue driving global success for ‘Peanuts’”\n\n\tCharlie Brown, Snoopy and the rest of the “Peanuts” crew were first introduced to the world by Charles M. Schulz on Oct. 2, 1950, when the comic strip debuted in seven newspapers. The franchise has since become a global hit. In addition to the “Peanuts” shows and specials on Apple TV, the brand encompasses thousands of consumer products, as well as amusement park attractions, cultural events, social events, social media, and comic strips in all formats.\n\n\tFor WildBrain, the deal will eliminate 100% of its debt “and gives us financial flexibility to accelerate the growth of our iconic franchises Strawberry Shortcake and Teletubbies, while also investing in our premium digital content network across YouTube, FAST and AVOD, and in new technologies to drive innovation,” the company said.\n\t\n\n\tUnder the agreement, WildBrain also remains a multiyear partner to Peanuts for key services, including acting as distributor for WildBrain-produced Peanuts content and continued management of the Snoopy YouTube channel. In addition, the company will serve as exclusive licensing agent through its agency WildBrain CPLG for consumer products in all current territories across Europe, the Middle East, China, and Asia Pacific (excluding Japan, Australia and New Zealand).\n\n\tWildBrain also will operate an exclusive production studio for new Peanuts content — including the previously announced animated feature film — under a partnership with Apple TV, recently renewed through 2030.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLabubu, that line of round, wide eyed, pointy eared plush collectibles, is coming to the screen. Sony Pictures has tapped Paul King, the director of “Wonka” and the “Paddington” films,” to make a live-action feature based on the beloved toys. The project is in early development, with King set to direct and produce with Department M and Wenxin She.\n\n\tKing’s most recent film, “Wonka,” starring Timothée Chalamet, was a major box office success, earning $635 million globally. The “Paddington” films were commercial hits and were embraced by critics. They earned nearly $500 million globally. King co-wrote the screenplay and executive produced the third film in the series.\n\t\n\n\t“Labubu” originated 10 years ago in a picture book series. The toys are produced and sold exclusively by China-based retailer Pop Mart. In case you came of age long before the aughts or don’t have young relatives, Labubu figures are sealed in “blind box” packaging, which means buyers aren’t always aware of the specific character inside. They were created by Kasing Lung, a Hong Kong-born artist who has strong ties to the Netherlands, where he moved as a child, developing an appreciation for folklore that inspired “The Monsters” series, which led to Labubu.\n\n\n\tAs Hollywood hunts for new forms of IP to exploit, it has increasingly turned to toys and games. Warner Bros. and Mattel had a hit with “Barbie” and Warners then turned “A Minecraft Movie” into one of 2025’s biggest blockbusters. There have also been successful movies made of “Super Mario Bros.” and “Sonic the Hedgehog.” Studios are currently working on producing features based on everything from “Masters of the Universe” to “Rock ’Em Sock ’Em Robots,” which is being written by Vin Diesel. \n\t\n\n\tThe Hollywood Reporter broke the news of King’s hire.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter a bumper year that saw major projects shooting in Colombia, including Seasons 2 of BBC/AMC’s “The Night Manager” and Netflix’s mega epic series “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” Colombia’s Film Commission at Proimágenes Colombia has increased its CINA incentive to $90 million, a 49% boost from the previous year’s $60 million, which was fully allocated – in record time – by September.\n\n\tCINA offers a 35% transferable tax credit on expenditures for audiovisual services in Colombia and is applicable to feature films, series, music videos, video games, animation, post production and advertising.\n\t\n\n\t Since its launch, the incentive has supported over 165 international audiovisual projects, generating more than $861 million in investment and creating over 130,000 direct jobs, making it the envy of its Latin American neighbors who have also vied to attract more location shoots.\n\n\tIn 2025, 32 projects were approved, including shows from Disney+, Sony Pictures, Paramount, Netflix and Amazon. Altogether, these projects brought in an estimated $188 million in investment.\n\n\t“The success of CINA in 2025 demonstrates that Colombia has a solid, reliable and internationally competitive incentive system,” said Silvia Echeverri, head of the Colombia Film Commission, adding: “With the 2026 CINA allocation, we are marking a milestone in our strategy to consolidate Colombia as a strategic partner for large-scale audiovisual projects. This increase responds to the confidence of international producers, who have found in Colombia highly qualified talent, powerful stories, diverse locations and a robust, globally competitive incentive system.”\n\t\n\n\tMatthew Patnick, executive producer of Season 2 of “The Night Manager,” concurred: “It was a massive decision to come over to Colombia. The tax incentive is so favorable to productions coming here; it made everything much easier and had a huge financial impact on the show.”\n\n\tThe growing influx of international productions that include Zack Snyder’s indie drama “The Last Photograph,” Constantin Film’s survival horror pic “Titan” (renamed “Snake”) and “Sierra Madre,” starring Kiefer Sutherland, has greatly contributed to the advancement of Colombia’s audiovisual infrastructure in both talent and logistics.\n\n\t“Working with filmmakers of such high caliber, has helped us up our game,” said Jaguar Bite production VP Juan Pablo Solano whose company has serviced Snyder’s pic among others.\n\n\tProimágenes reports that audiovisual production has strongly boosted Colombia’s economy, generating over 570,000 hotel nights and 30,000 airline tickets, benefiting tourism and services nationwide. Incentivized projects now span 24 departments and 153 municipalities, reflecting broad regional impact.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“One Hundred Years of Solitude,” Netflix\n\t\n\n\n",

From monster openings for features like “Sinners” and “Final Destination Bloodlines” to word-of-mouth streaming debuts like “Dead Mail” and “Best Wishes to All,” there are so many standouts that any genre fan has their work cut out for them to catch up. Below, take a look at Variety’s list of the Best Horror Movies of the Year, a selection that hopefully invites spirited debate and encourages adding some new titles to your Letterboxd Watchlist.\n\n\tFirst, some honorable mentions, in alphabetical order:\n\n\t“Bring Her Back” (A24) — Danny and Michael Philippou’s “Talk to Me” follow-up is handsomely shot and features a great Sally Hawkins performance, but is stuck in one wildly depressing gear.\n\n\t“Clown in a Cornfield” (RLJE Films and Shudder) — More clever than the name implies, a mid-film twist plays well at upending genre conventions.\n\n\t”Drop” (Universal Pictures) — In one of the year’s best popcorn movies, Meghann Fahy has to squeeze out of one sticky situation after another in this dynamically filmed low-budget thriller.\n\n\t“Predator: Killer of Killers” (Hulu) — This impressive triptych delivers some of the most epic Predator battles ever, with animation acting as a wonderful canvas for prohibitively expensive fight scenes.\n\n\t”Sweet Revenge” (Horror Inc. and Jason Universe) — It may be a short, but this brief Jason tale does a great job of delivering some bloody action with a retro feel, and gives the legendary killer a formidable foe. Here’s hoping it gets turned into a feature-length film, as it seems like writer and director Mike P. Nelson really understands what makes the “Friday the 13th” universe tick.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Toxic Avenger\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Yana Blajeva\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tCineverse\n\n\tWriter and Director Macon Blair amps up the heart — but keeps the splattery violence and satire — in this reimagining of the signature Troma movie. Peter Dinklage is empathetic as the man behind Toxie, a humble janitor, while Kevin Bacon is wonderfully evil as a billionaire asshole, with Elijah Wood and Taylour Paige also in on the fun. Frantic, bizarre and loaded with love for the original, “The Toxic Avenger” will keep fans happy and bring joy to new devotees.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPresence\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Neon\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tNeon\n\n\tSteven Soderbergh’s unique take on a ghost story finds his camera roaming a house in a spectral first-person mode. The family inside can certainly feel the spirit roaming around the home, but why? There’s certainly more going on in the story than unfinished business, and Soderbergh can land the plane on the murder mystery penned by his frequent collaborator David Koepp. For experimental work, it’s a rousing success.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHeart Eyes\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Sony Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tScreen Gems\n\n\tJosh Ruben directed a tricky piece of pop culture, mixing a perfectly charming rom-com with the DNA of a “Scream”-esque whodunit. Olivia Holt and Mason Gooding are endlessly charming as a new couple with the most conventional meet-cute of all time. But what happens when their first evening together turns into a one-crazy-night movie where they’re pursued by a serial killer? The laughs ultimately outweigh the scares, but it’s a great genre twist for slasher fans, elevated by a supporting cast that includes memorable turns from Gigi Zumbado, Michaela Watkins, Devon Sawa and Jordana Brewster.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Wishes to All\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Shudder / Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tShudder\n\n\tThis Japanese horror movie is filled with some of the most indelible imagery put on screen this year, nightmare fuel for those able to keep their eyes open. Kotone Furukawa plays a young woman visiting her grandparents who stumbles upon a very shocking — and seemingly normalized — part of their family history. Telling a larger story about happiness and class culture, Yuta Shimotsu’s film is most impactful when it’s in gonzo family drama mode, making eye-popping sacrifices a family affair.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDead Mail\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Dead Mail LLC\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tShudder\n\n\tJoe DeBoer and Kyle McConaghy’s unique conspiracy mystery feels beamed out of the ‘80s, with production design and filmmaking that recalls a long-forgotten VHS relic. When a synthesizer expert is kidnapped, he’s able to get a desperate letter into the mail, and the amateur sleuths at the dead letter office start hunting. Things quickly get complicated for all parties involved, and the film’s visuals and soundtrack stick around even after the credits roll.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Monkey\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tNeon\n\n\tOsgood Perkins’ about-face after the success of “Longlegs” was this bloody dark comedy about a toy monkey who brings death and destruction wherever he goes. Theo James is a hoot playing identical twins trying unsuccessfully to keep this malevolent force buried, and some of the year’s freakiest deaths come courtesy of this furry fiend. A nasty, brutish piece of work that is sure to satisfy gorehounds.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tI Love You Forever\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tUtopia\n\n\tNot a conventional horror movie, this romantic drama ratchets up the suffocating tension slowly as rom-com trappings give way to an all-too-real-feeling story of a toxic and psychologically abusive relationship. Sofia Black-D’Elia plays a law student who gets love-bombed by the handsome and charming Finn (Ray Nicholson). He seems to be the perfect guy until his grip of control over her escalates from annoyingly frequent text messages to suicidal screaming fits over missed calls. Cazzie David and Elisa Kalani co-wrote and –directed this sharp film.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTogether\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Neon\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tNeon\n\n\tMichael Shanks’ rip-roaring body horror love story stars real-life spouses Dave Franco and Alison Brie as a couple that grows increasingly close physically even as their relationship is on shaky ground. The film includes some of the year’s most talked-about “turn away from the screen” scenes (The saw! The eyeballs! The penis!) and some great visual nods to other horror classics. It’s a lean, mean, thrilling machine and a great way to get introduced to body horror, for those interested in taking the disgusting plunge.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t28 Years Later\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tSony Pictures Releasing\n\n\tDirector Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland’s return to the zombie franchise is bold, divisive, gory and a hell of an adventure. Reuniting with “28 Days Later” cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, who shot much of the film on complex iPhone rigs, the stylish colors and editing keep things eye-popping. The stylish look underlines the disturbing gore and the heart-pounding pursuits, as young Alfie Williams learns to become a man by sneaking off to shoot zombies in an infected zone. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Ralph Fiennes add grit to their supporting roles, and it’s hard to believe another sequel will be released in a matter of months.  \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCompanion\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tWarner Bros. Pictures\n\n\tDrew Hancock’s twisty sci-fi thriller stars Sophie Thatcher as a love robot who is manipulated into murder while on vacation with a devious group of friends. Thatcher is terrific, coming to terms with not only her gaslighting boyfriend (a delightfully smarmy Jack Quaid) but also the fact that she’s not human after all, and the bloody twists keep amping up the stakes. Undervalued theatrically, “Companion” is sure to become a cult favorite once discovered on streaming.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFinal Destination Bloodlines\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tWarner Bros. Pictures\n\n\tWho would have thought that the sixth film in this beloved franchise — one that comes after a 14-year gap since the previous chapter — would be such a nimble crowdpleaser? “Bloodlines” has many of the same beats as previous installments while making some key changes: The group of people avoiding Death’s cruel fate are all family members instead of random strangers; the opening dream setpiece was a flashback, allowing for the main film to be filled with new characters that hadn’t died yet; and the movie felt bigger in scope overall. But ultimately, what worked very well were the ooey gooey kills, which were a perfect blend of funny and cringey. Mix in a heartfelt goodbye from franchise fixture Tony Todd, and it’s no surprise why this was such a critical and commercial success.  \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Shrouds\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJanus Films\n\n\tDavid Cronenberg’s latest film is about the living who haunt graveyards, namely Karsh (Vincent Cassel), a man who builds in-tomb cameras so that mourners can watch their loved ones rot in real time. It’s a downer logline that morphs into a thorny story of corporate intrigue, complete with body horror flourishes and romantic moments as horny as they are vulnerable. An odd chapter in an unparalleled career, “The Shrouds” is a must-watch as Cronenberg ponders death with a great troupe of actors, including Diane Kruger, Guy Pearce and Sandrine Holt.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tWarner Bros.\n\n\tZach Cregger’s ambitious examination of evil taking hold of a small town succeeds by putting interesting, complicated characters at the forefront. When a classroom of kids runs away in the middle of the night, troubled townspeople played by Josh Brolin, Julia Garner, Alden Ehrenreich and Austin Abrams are among those searching for (and stumbling on) answers. Well-directed setpieces, sinister twists and an outrageous ending make “Weapons” a must-see.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSinners\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Warner Bros.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tWarner Bros. Pictures\n\n\tAn unbelievably confident work stuffed with imagination, writer-director Ryan Coogler delivered his best film yet with this music-filled horror story. Led by a career-high Michael B. Jordan playing the Smokestack twins, each character in this rich work — which swerves into the supernatural once an Irish vampire starts infecting the clientele of the twins’ new juke joint — could anchor their own movie. The blend is sexy, surprising and gorgeously shot, and an unforgettable twist to well-trodden bloodsucker lore.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe ‘Stranger Things’ Radio Station WSQK the Squawk Lives On\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPaul John Just Dropped the Latest Edition of Its Annual Christmas Indian Single Malt Whisky\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNike Q2 Earnings Crush Estimates, but Are Still Down 32%\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 12 Best Floral Delivery Services to Easily Order Christmas Flowers Online\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLate Shift\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Late Shift\" (Credit: Boo Productions)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best International Feature Commentary (Updated Dec. 16, 2025): The international feature film category offered few surprises on the shortlist, though distributor Neon secured a record five of the 15 available slots. Switzerland’s “Late Shift” edged out the United Kingdom’s “My Father’s Shadow,” despite the latter’s recent Gotham Award win for lead actor Ṣọpẹ Dìrísù.\n\n\tWomen directors also made their mark in this year’s selections: seven of the 15 international feature films are directed by women.\n\n\tThe roster of contenders aligned almost identically with predictions, though Switzerland’s “Late Shift” emerged as a notable surprise, securing a spot many expected would go to the United Kingdom’s “My Father’s Shadow” — particularly after its strong Gotham Award win for leading performer Sopé Dìrísù. Critical acclaim and festival momentum don’t always translate to Academy recognition, especially in a category known for its unpredictability.\n\n\tNeon’s impressive five-film presence (“The Secret Agent,” “Sirât,” “It Was Just an Accident,” “Sentimental Value,” and “No Other Choice”) shows the distributor’s is gearing up for a bloodbath of its own in the international space. Will they nab all five slots? Tunisia’s masterful “The Voice of Hind Rajab” is in the running for a spot after the Golden Globe nom.\n\n\tIn other news, streaming giants Netflix (“Left-Handed Girl”) and Amazon MGM Studios (“Belén”) maintain their competitive footing. Meanwhile, Watermelon Pictures’ dual representation with entries from Jordan (“All That’s Left of You”) and Palestine (“Palestine 36”) highlights the continued push for representation from Middle Eastern cinema on the global stage.\n\n\tThe international feature film category drew 86 eligible submissions from countries and regions around the world. The Academy defines an international feature film as a feature-length picture (more than 40 minutes) produced outside the U.S. with a predominantly non-English dialogue track.\n\n\tAcademy members from all branches were invited to participate in the preliminary round of voting, though eligibility required meeting a minimum viewing requirement. In the nominations round, members from all branches may opt in to participate but must view all 15 shortlisted films to vote. From this shortlist of 15 titles, five films will advance to the final nomination ballot.\n\n\tFinal nominations in the shortlisted categories will be determined in the coming weeks. Oscar voting opens Monday, Jan. 12, and closes Friday, Jan. 16. Nominations will be announced Thursday, Jan. 22.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Aniplex Inc.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: AMP Filmworks\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Credit: Cannes Film Festival\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

Members of the Music Branch will vote to determine both the shortlist and the final nominees. Among the scores that were either not submitted or deemed ineligible: “After the Hunt” (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross), “Blue Moon” (Graham Reynolds), “Ella McCay” (Hans Zimmer), “KPop Demon Hunters” (Marcelo Zarvos), and “The Phoenician Scheme” (Alexandre Desplat).\n\n\tOscar nomination voting opens Monday, Jan. 12, and closes Friday, Jan. 16. Nominations will be announced Thursday, Jan. 22.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited artisans are subject to change.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Agata Grzybowska\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Eli Adé\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Sound Commentary (Updated Dec. 16, 2025): The Oscars shortlist has been announced for best sound, and the category is a symphony of chaos (in all the best ways).\n\n\tWar film (sort of?) “One Battle After Another” earns its spot with gritty, ground-level realism, where every explosion and anguished scream is meticulously orchestrated for visceral emotional impact, pulling audiences directly into the fog of battle. Meanwhile, “Sinners” continues its awards momentum with a sound mix that’s equal parts operatic and ominous, creating an unsettling sonic atmosphere that lingers long after the credits roll.\n\n\tPerhaps the coolest inclusion of the decade is “Sirât,” a more meditative international entry that proves sound excellence isn’t exclusive to English-language blockbusters.\n\n\tIn the music-driven lane, “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” turns up the volume with soulful studio sessions and stadium-worthy acoustics that capture The Boss at his most intimate and anthemic. And it would have been foolish to count out “Wicked: For Good,” which enchants with a masterful blend of soaring vocals from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, lush orchestrations and magical effects that make Oz feel tactile and alive.\n\n\t“Superman” flies in with thunderous heroics. You can hear every punch, crash, and sonic boom in a mix that makes you feel like you’re soaring alongside the Man of Steel. Then there’s “F1,” a full-throttle contender where sound practically becomes a character, immersing viewers in the roar of engines and the split-second tension of race day. “Frankenstein” takes a starkly different route, combining gothic atmosphere and eerie silence.\n\n\tAction enthusiasts and Tom Cruise devotees can rest easy as “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” has landed on the list, a fitting recognition for what’s the franchise’s final chapter. And it’s no surprise to see “Avatar: Fire and Ash” here, with James Cameron once again demonstrating his unparalleled ability to make the soundscape of Pandora feel as immersive and alive as the world itself.\n\n\tAll eligible members of the Sound Branch vote to determine the shortlist and the nominees. Academy members will be invited to view excerpts from each of the shortlisted films beginning Saturday, Jan. 10, 2025, in the San Francisco Bay area, London and New York, followed by Los Angeles on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2026. \n\n\tOscar nomination voting opens Monday, Jan. 12, and closes Friday, Jan. 16. Nominations will be announced Thursday, Jan. 22.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited artisans are subject to change, and are ultimately determined by the Academy.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: 20th Century Studios\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tThe board of E.W. Scripps Co. unanimously rejected the unsolicited acquisition proposal submitted by Sinclair, the second-biggest U.S. TV station owner group, Scripps announced Tuesday.\n\n\tSinclair on Nov. 24 had offered $7 per share (in a mix of cash and stock) for stock in Scripps that it does not already own; it previously had acquired a 9.9% stake in Scripps. Sinclair’s takeover move came amid Nexstar Media Group’s $6.2 billion deal for Tegna, which would expand the reach of Nexstar, the No. 1 biggest TV station owner group in the U.S. \n\t\n\n\tScripps said in a Dec. 16 statement, “The Scripps board determined, following a careful review and evaluation in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that Sinclair’s offer is not in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.”\n\n\n\tReps for Sinclair did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\n\tKim Williams, the chair of Scripps’ board, said in a statement, “The board is committed to acting in the best interests of all Scripps shareholders as well as the company’s employees and the many communities and audiences it serves across the United States. After careful consideration, Scripps’ board determined that Sinclair’s unsolicited acquisition proposal is not in the best interests of Scripps and its shareholders. The board nonetheless remains open to evaluating opportunities to enhance shareholder value and will continue to consider any course of action, including any acquisition proposal, that is in the best interest of all shareholders.”\n\n\tSinclair operates and/or provides services to 185 TV stations in 85 markets, while Scripps has more than 60 stations in 40-plus markets. According to Sinclair, upon closing of the Scripps acquisition, Scripps shareholders would own approximately 12.7% of the combined entity.\n\t\n\n\tIn the SEC filing, Sinclair commented on the FCC’s current 39% ownership limit: “We are confident that under existing rules, including the national cap, the transaction [with Scripps] can be completed in a timely manner with limited select divestitures.” \n\n\tUnder Sinclair’s proposal, the combined Sinclair-Scripps company would have a market capitalization of $2.9 billion, based on a 7:1 ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), according to Sinclair. Sinclair estimated the unified company would have about $325 million in cost synergies.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRob Reiner was many things — an accomplished comic actor before applying his talents to directing, and for decades an outspoken advocate for his beliefs. Above all, he was one of Hollywood’s great humanists.\n\n\tThink about the very best of his oeuvre — an astonishing run that included multiple films that Reiner lived to see enter the pantheon. All of them get their electric charge from a precise, focused attention on human behavior. A Reiner character may be deluded (as in “This Is Spinal Tap”) or neurotic (“When Harry Met Sally …”) or outright deranged (“Misery”). But their personality will, every time, reveal itself to the viewer in a way that feels like meeting someone out there in the world beyond the cinema.\n\t\n\n\tThe gruesome circumstances of the deaths of Reiner and his wife, Michele, are vivid in the news right now. But as time passes, Reiner will, one hopes, be remembered first for the thought and heart he put into telling stories. In his understanding that telling and sharing stories is what makes us who we are, and in his gift for making us laugh, cry and most of all, care, he was the very best of the filmmaking community.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t20th Century Fox / Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis extended to his enormously collaborative nature: A writer’s director, Reiner lent craft and verve to help make the best work of Nora Ephron, Aaron Sorkin and William Goldman shine. He also had a remarkable way with talent. Meg Ryan might not have been a romantic-comedy leading lady, or Christopher Guest a comedy brand name, or Kathy Bates a film star at all, had Reiner not allowed them to do what they now seemed destined to do. Bates’ performance as Annie Wilkes seems illustrative: A theater actor only just breaking into film, Bates delivered a perfectly calibrated performance as a stalker-fan in “Misery.” Reiner has supreme control, though, and keeps the performance from spinning into camp. Every decision of Annie’s comes to make a certain kind of sense, as we eventually begin to understand her twisted point of view.\n\t\n\n\tAnd that’s just one of Reiner’s great characters! Think of Annette Bening, trying and failing to keep herself from being dazzled by her new beau in “The American President.” Or the boys forging what they believe will be a lifelong bond in “Stand by Me,” or the lieutenant willing to challenge his superior in “A Few Good Men.” Or — framing a story of fantastical derring-do — the grandfather reading to his grandson in “The Princess Bride.” That movie is one of Reiner’s most remembered for everything that happens in the kingdom of Florin (Inigo Montoya, “as you wish,” and all the rest). But it is, in the end, just about a family trying to share a story.\n\n\tBeyond his films, Reiner was as much a character in the public imagination as, say, Martin Scorsese or Steven Spielberg. Part of this stemmed from his experience as an actor: A generation of TV viewers remember him as Archie Bunker’s son-in-law on “All in the Family.” Avuncular and quick-witted as a performer, Reiner popped up as recently as this year on “The Bear”; his mere presence made one hope more ardently that the sandwich window would succeed, because it would really be a shame to let Rob Reiner down.\n\n\tHe was also a mainstay of television news, sharing insights and perspectives that came from a deep well of feeling for the dispossessed. It’s telling that, even among most conservatives, tributes to Reiner’s work and life have been heartfelt. In his compassion and his ability to have a conversation that made even political adversaries feel included and welcome, Reiner was a tribune from an era that was not so very long ago but that has now passed.\n\n\tThat’s evidenced by the president’s grotesque response to Reiner’s passing, which needs to be acknowledged if only to decisively draw a contrast with Reiner himself. What more needs to be said? Donald Trump’s taunting those who mourned Reiner and his wife was inhuman. And perhaps the worst thing that can be said about it is that Reiner, who sought the good and the interesting and the lovable and the human in all of us, would have been utterly baffled by it.\n",

    "description": "\n\tUniversal Music Group has proposed a solution to the European Commission’s recently published objections over the major label’s acquisition of music",
    "body": "\n\tUniversal Music Group has proposed a solution to the European Commission’s recently published objections over the major label’s acquisition of music services company Downtown Music Holdings. \n\n\tThe deal, first announced in Dec. 2024 via UMG’s subsidiary Virgin Music Group, was struck for $775 million, the companies said at the time. UMG’s fix would be to divest the Curve platform, Downtown’s royalty and rights management subsidiary, as part of its deal. UMG would instead keep a “sanitized” duplicate of Curve minus any of the client data that may have followed, as well as requiring non-disclosure agreements from anyone making the jump from Curve to UMG/Interscope.\n\t\n\n\tOn Nov. 23, the EC – following its investigation of the merger that began over the summer into whether it could allow UMG to “reduce competition” – announced the objections, which focused primarily on Curve. (Downtown’s distribution service, FUGA, was also mentioned in the document.) The Commission wrote it is “concerned that UMG may have the ability and incentive to gain access to commercially sensitive data that is stored and processed by Downtown’s Curve and that such information advantage for UMG would hamper rival labels’ ability and incentive to compete with UMG.” The EC first announced in April that it had accepted requests from Austria and the Netherlands to “assess” the proposed acquisition.\n\n\n\tOn its website, Curve says it is “a proud partner to over 500 labels, publishers and rights holders around the world.” The divestiture was first reported by Music Business Worldwide.\n\t\n\n\tThe deal has garnered broad criticism from the independent music community. The Europe-based Independent Music Companies Association (IMPALA) released a statement Monday asserting that much of the data on Curve is too similar to other Downtown subsidiaries like the distribution platform CD Baby and the publishing management platform Songtrust, neither of which was named by the EC in its objections.\n\n\t“The competition issues must be viewed in the wider context of multiple concerns around the digital market, the whole ecosystem, cultural diversity and the removal of a significant competitor,” IMPALA wrote.\n\n\tIn addition, a campaign against the deal titled 100 Voices calls for it to be blocked outright, saying it would allow UMG to “increase its bargaining power and enhance its control over key parts of the supply chain of music.”\n\n\tA representative for Universal Music Group did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.\n\n\tDowntown was founded in 2007 by Justin Kalifowitz, who previously worked for Virgin Records and Spirit Music Publishing; the latter moved its administration to Downtown in Jan. 2024, Billboard reported at the time. UMG relaunched Virgin in 2022.\n\n\tThe European Commission will make a final decision on the merger by Feb. 6, 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe “M3GAN” Cinematic Universe might not be expanding after all.\n\n\t“Soulm8te,” a sci-fi spinoff about man who buys an android to cope with the death of his wife, has been removed from Universal’s release calendar. The film, which was set for Jan. 9, will be shopped around town to other Hollywood studios.\n\n\t“Soulm8te,” an erotic thriller with a technological twist, was a companion piece, of sorts, to “M3GAN,” a dark horror comedy about a murderous artificial intelligence doll with the government name of Model 3 Generative Android. “M3GAN” became a sleeper hit with $181 million at the global box office. However this year’s sequel “M3GAN 2.0” misfired with just $39 million by the end of its theatrical run. Though not catastrophic given the $25 million production budget, those ticket sales represent a fatal decline in interest from the original — and certainly not enough enthusiasm to spawn spinoff stories. \n\t\n\n\tKate Dolan wrote and directed “Soulm8te,” which stars Lily Sullivan, David Rysdahl and Claudia Doumit. Blumhouse founder Jason Blum and Atomic Monster founder James Wan produced the film.\n\n\n\tAfter a scary-good run of horror hits (“Paranormal Activity,” “The Purge,” “Get Out” and “Halloween” among them), Blumhouse has endured a rare fallow year at the box office. Although October’s “Black Phone 2” ($131 million against a $30 million budget) and December’s “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” ($175 million to date against a $36 million budget) helped turn around the company’s 2025 fortunes, misfires over the past 12 months have included January’s “Wolf Man” ($34 million against a $25 million budget), March’s “The Woman in the Yard” ($23 million against a $12 million budget) and April’s “Drop” ($28 million against an $8 million budget). \n",

    "body": "\n\tRob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner’s murders on Sunday were shocking for many reasons – their sheer brutality, the sad fact that it involved one of Hollywood’s gentlest souls, and that the couple’s son, Nick Reiner, is allegedly the killer. I had seen a brief glimpse into their father-son dynamic when I interviewed Rob and Nick when they were at the 2015 Toronto Film Festival with “Being Charlie,” a drama based on Nick’s struggle to get sober.\n\t\n\n\tWe talked for maybe 45 minutes, and the resulting piece was all-too brief, but I’ve been turning that interview, as well as the three or four others I conducted with Rob in my career, over in my head since the news broke. It’s impossible to comprehend what would make someone murder anyone, let alone their parents. But in sorting through these stray encounters, I’ve been reflecting on how human and hopeful Rob and Nick seemed at the festival.\n\n\n\tI remember finding “Being Charlie,” which is about the drug-addicted son of an actor turned congressional candidate (a clear stand-in for Rob), to be well-intentioned, but undercooked. However, talking with the Reiners it was impossible not to be moved by the personal story that inspired it. Nick had co-written the script for the film, and Rob had directed the picture, with the two evidently searching for some kind of reconciliation.  \n\n\t“Something would happen in the script, and that would trigger stuff that was going on with us,” Rob told me. “He had written things between the father and the son that had happened. I had said to him, ‘I’d rather you hate me than you be dead in the street.’” \n\t\n\n\tFor his part, Nick, who seemed shy, said he hoped that “Being Charlie” would highlight some of the “ridiculousness” he experienced during one failed rehab stint after another. Like Rob, he implied that their relationship had been strained, but that working together had been cathartic. That was never clearer than in the final conversation between an estranged father and son that Nick had conceived for the film, one that was intended to signal a kind of closure.  \n\n\t“Towards the end of shooting, we were doing a scene, and I said, ‘Why doesn’t Charlie go up and hug his dad,’” Nick told me. “That meant a lot to my dad, because it was sort of like I was accepting him back in.”\n\n\t Both Rob and Nick argued that the recovery programs that they’d turned to since Nick was 15 had failed them. They hadn’t come up with a way to keep Nick off drugs, and Rob felt he hadn’t appreciated his son’s objections to the doctors and experts who had tried to help him beat his addictions. It was clear that Rob felt very guilty. His celebrity and access to resources hadn’t been enough to prevent his son from getting into drugs – like so many other people around the world, addiction had torn their family apart.  \n\n\tI talked to Rob several times over the years – most recently when he was relaunching Castle Rock and looking for investors at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival. He was affable, funny and genuine, often interrupting our interviews to say something to Michele, who would flit in and out of the room, or asking her to jog his memory about some detail or another. In talking to people who knew the couple far better than I did, it was clear they were joined at the hip – artistically, spiritually, professionally – and believed in treating people with decency and grace.  \n\n\tThey took their responsibility to others seriously (my colleague Daniel D’Addario correctly labeled Rob Reiner “one of Hollywood’s great humanists”), getting involved in numerous social justice causes. And given the outpouring of affection that has sprung up from the many, many people who had worked with Rob and Michele over the years, working with them meant having a friend for life.  \n\t\n\n\tI kept thinking about one other encounter I had with Rob, when I wrote an oral history of one of my favorite movies, “Stand by Me.” I remember him talking in a haunted fashion about running into River Phoenix in the years after the film came out. He was clearly alarmed by the choices that the young, sweet, sensitive man had made since they worked together on the movie.  \n\n\t“He was already getting into drugs,” Reiner said. “I remember him coming to visit me in a hotel somewhere and he was like really high, and I thought, ‘Ay, ay, ay, what the hell is going on with this kid?’” He went on to share how sad he felt when he heard about River’s death of an overdose, the way his heart broke for the young man’s family, and his frustration at all the missed roles that Phoenix never got to play because his life ended too soon. And I sensed regret that nobody had been able to pull River out of the spiral of addiction.  \n\n\tI know many parents will do anything to help their children, and it sounds like Rob and Michele were no exceptions. But having seen Hollywood fail to rescue one young person he cared about must have only reinforced Rob Reiner’s commitment to save his own son. In the end, that wouldn’t be enough. \n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix is aiming to bolster awareness of its new “Best Guess Live” mobile game, by giving away a total of $1 million over the course of next week. The daily jackpot, which normally stands at $15,000, will be bumped up to $50,000 on Monday, then escalate throughout the week until contestants will play for a chance at a $500,000 jackpot on Friday, Dec. 26.\n\n\tThe new mobile game show, which launched Dec. 8, runs weeknights at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on a special Netflix “Best Guess Live” app devoted to the competition. Howie Mandel (“America’s Got Talent”) and Hunter March (“Sugar Rush”) split hosting duties.\n\t\n\n\tThe daily pot is split between two puzzles featured each weekday. Players are asked to guess what one of the evening’s secret items are. It could be a person, a place or a thing, and players will have to figure it out through a series of five clues (shared, of course, as riddles). The first people to figure out the item correctly share the pot — but you only get one guess per puzzle.\n\n\n\tThe mobile game shoots live every weeknight from Apploff Entertainment’s offices in Los Angeles; executive producer Jeff Apploff (“Beat Shazam,” “Don’t Forget the Lyrics”) created the show with Noah Bonnett.\n\n\tDuring the holiday week of Monday, Dec. 22 to Friday, Dec. 26, the prize pool will add up to a total of $1 million. Here’s the breakdown of the holiday cash prizes below:\n\n\tMon, Dec. 22 – $50,000\n\n\tTue, Dec. 23 – $100,000\n\n\tWed, Dec. 24 – $150,000\n\n\tThu, Dec. 25 – $200,000\n\n\tFri, Dec. 26 – $500,000\n",

Insane video from a San Francisco restaurant shows a rowdy, belligerent patron going down hard on the sidewalk following an extended altercation with customers and staff.\n      \n    \n          Watch the video posted yesterday ... there's so much to cover. First, we see a young woman -- slurring her words and cursing loudly -- upset with a manager for apparently cutting her off from the bar. With her camera phone out, the woman appears to be planning to catch the staff \"harassing\" her. But while she's filming them, the rest of the customers are filming her.\n      \n    \n      \n      NEW: Drunk female customer attacks bar staff outside trendy San Francisco restaurant co-owned by celebrity chef Joey AltmanThe unidentified couple had been cut off for being drunk and rudeBartender Miguel Marchese said they were verbally abrasive and difficult with staff… pic.twitter.com/peqhRbKjqY— Unlimited L's (@unlimited_ls) December 16, 2025\n              @unlimited_ls\n          \n  \n    \n          The staff basically ignore her tirade, so the woman picks a fight with a fellow customer, violently swiping at the innocent bystander who had been recording the whole thing. The woman's date -- also visibly inebriated -- then restrains her as she swings wildly at the customer.\n      \n    \n          Then, as the woman walks away from the assault she just committed, a female staffer appears to expertly take the obnoxious young woman to the ground with a swift trip. Somebody's taken a judo class or two!\n      \n\n          And the woman hits the ground hard! But -- full of booze and misguided righteous indignation -- she pops right back up.\n      \n    \n          Now, the staff have had enough and carry them out of their establishment to the applause of everyone else inside.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          But it doesn't stop there ... the woman keeps fighting, snatching the hair of a restaurant worker who escorted her out. After finally getting separated, she then sprints down the sidewalk, but she's tripped hard by a bystander, and she smashes flat on her face on the sidewalk -- and now it seems she's had enough, so her date comes over to console her.\n      \n    \n          Up to this point, her date seemed like a super chill guy ... he's largely been minding his business this whole time, trying to get her out of the place. But when the woman tearfully chides him to \"be a man,\" this guy starts pushing random people who are not attacking them AT ALL.\n      \n    \n          It's unclear what exactly caused the incident, but it is clear that her relationship is toxic -- to him, and the rest of the world!\n      \n      ",

    "body": "\n\tJulio Fernández, the pioneering founder of Barcelona studio Filmax and co-architect of itsFantastic Factory which galvanised Spain’s auteur genre production, died Nov. 17. in Miami. He was 78.\n\n\tBorn in rural Galicia, in A Fonsagrada in the province of Lugo, Fernández was typical of a region which emigrated for larger opportunities in Spain’s fast building cities. Few, however, had Fernández’s ambitions and eye for the main chance. If genre and animation are two of the current international market’s going concerns, Fernández anticipated this getting on for 30 years ago. \n\t\n\n\tIn 1987, Fernández bought Filmax, a Paramount library movie distributor in the 1960s, dedicated to video, but which Fernández and younger brother Carlos Fernández wanted to move into theatrical distribution. Buoyed by cinema theater results for “The Fourth Consul,” Filmax made another move, into production, and always with one eye on international markets, seeing vibrant international sales on young director Jaume Balagueró’s “Nameless” at 1999’s Mifed, bringing down the flag on a golden age of Spanish auteur genre.\n\n\n\tA year later, Fernández officially launched the Fantastic Factory with Brian Yuzna. A unique attempt to replicate the shlock but also meta arch awareness of 1985’s “Re-Animator” in movies made in English in Spain mixing international and Spanish actors, the Fantastic Factory saw early success, with Lionsgate Entertainment acquiring all North American rights to four of its horror titles: Jack Sholder’s “Arachnid”; “Dagon,” from Stuart Gordon; and two titles from Brian Yuzna: “Faust: Love of the Damned” and “Beyond Re-Animator.” \n\t\n\n\tIn 2001, Fernández launched Filmax Animation in his native Galicia, a venture which yielded Goya-winning “El Cid: The Legend.” Filmax also upped its ambition. Bought by Dimension and released in 2004 two years after its Spanish bow, supernatural horror film “Darkness” – starring Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Iain Glen and Giancarlo Giannini and a step-up in scale and step into English for Balagueró – grossed a breakout $34.4 million in U.S. theaters. \n\n\tAlso released in 2004, the Brad Anderson-directed “The Machinist,” starring Christian Bale, has become a cult classic. From Balagueró and Paco Plaza, “[REC],” which premiered in 2007, went on to be ranked by Bloody Disgusting at No. 11 of its Top 20 Horror Films of the 2000s.    \n\n\tIn 2010, Carlos Fernández took over the reins of the company as its president, consolidating TV production, scoring a huge success with series “Polseres Vermelles” (“The Red Band Society”) remade by Fox in the U.S. and one of Spain’s most successful TV fiction formats ever. He and Filmax co-head Laura Fernandez, Julio Fernández’s daughter, have also fully-diversified Filmax into a full-blown studio. \n\n\tJulio Fernández was a born entrepreneur, working in sectors from real estate to cured sausages, the latter in Galicia. \n\n\tFrom 2010, he increasingly turned to other enterprises. His legacy remains, however. The Fantastic Factory underscored the possibilities of genre as a business and an art-form in Spain. It may be no coincidence that when Guillermo del Toro set out to shoot “Pan’s Labyrinth,” still reckoned by many as his best film, he shot and majority financed it in the country. The seeds of Spain’s modern genre film industry had already been sown.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Hollywood Commission has released new online resources designed to simplify and support anti-harassment practices, particularly for independent and low-budget productions, as part of its “Respect on Set” initiative.\n\n\t“Respect on Set” is a program developed by the Hollywood Commission that offers producers resources and guidelines to create a safer and inclusive work environment. Developed in close collaboration with INDIEn—ncomposed of producers Jeanette Volturno, Monica Levinson and Bart Rosenblattn—nthe new “Respect on Set” tools bring industry-aligned best practices, templates, and implementation resources together in one place.\n\t\n\n\tWhile surveying entertainment workers, the Hollywood Commission found that compared to their major-studio counterparts, workers on low-budget productions experience more sexual coercion and assault, but have fewer tools and support to report or prevent these abuses.\n\n\n\t“Respect on Set” was created to provide independent productions with a digital toolkit that delivers sample codes of conduct, customizable policy templates, pre-production audit and implementation checklist, communication tools, training resources and practical guidance for fulfilling IATSE LBA responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy photo\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLeonardo DiCaprio Honored by Palm Springs International Film Awards\n\n\tLeonardo DiCaprio will be honored with the Desert Palm Achievement Award, Actor for his performance in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” at the Palm Springs International Film Awards. The awards take place Jan. 3 at the Palm Springs Convention Center. \n\t\n\n\t“In ‘One Battle After Another,’ Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a riveting and emotionally charged performance, embodying a man pushed to his breaking point in the face of relentless adversity,” said Festival Chairman Nachhattar Singh Chandi in a statement. “Across his career, DiCaprio has continually redefined what is possible in screen acting — bringing emotional depth, artistic integrity, and fearless commitment to every role. It is our honor to present him with the Desert Palm Achievement Award, Actor, in recognition of his enduring influence and exceptional body of work.”\n\n\tPreviously announced honorees include Michael B.

    "body": "\n\tWhen people ask me what it’s like to run an events company, I always say that it depends on the answers to the type of seemingly unusual questions I find myself asking. And they often start as random as:“And how many custom trucks do we need?”“How many stops across the U.S.?”“How many months will we be on the road?”“What’s the guest count per stop?”It always sounds impossible. I always say, “Yes.”\n\n\tThat’s how I found myself running one of the first major national tours for a new tech client. It was seven months on the road, 12 cities and roughly 2,500 guests per location. We customized entire trucks in a matter of weeks, tricked out with every detail the client dreamed up, including full kitchens capable of serving hot food, storage for tents and gear and enough AV options to rival a festival.\n\t\n\n\tWe flew from state to state chasing permits from health departments and city officials — never totally sure we’d get approvals until the eleventh hour. And naturally, at some point, one of the trucks broke down in the middle of nowhere.\n\n\tBut my team never flinched. We exceeded expectations. We found the workaround. We always do. Our production manager ran the entire tour with a broken wrist in a cast, smiling (almost) the whole way, ready for each new city and its own unique brand of commotion.\n\n\tThat’s the kind of energy that keeps this machine, my company, running.\n\n\tAnd each event eventually hits a point where I take a step back for half a second, and watch it become something even bigger than what we planned. While those trucks tore down highways, fans began honking like we were a touring band. In more than one city, people actually trailed us all the way to the venue, phones out, wanting to catch the moment the doors swung open. Guests showed up hours before the official start time just to claim their spot at the front of the line. Somewhere between the honking caravans and the early-bird lines, the whole thing shifted. It wasn’t an “event” and we weren’t just building this thing. We were architecting a community in real time.\n\t\n\n\tI love running my company and am grateful every day for the incredible projects we get to be part of. But anyone who thinks this business is all glamour and no grit has never been in the trenches at 3 a.m. with a deadline closing in. There’s no world where you shortcut your way out of a crisis. And there’s no existing AI agent you can summon when a client realizes the branding is wrong on hundreds of gloves hours before doors open and you need the best, most-trusted embroiderer in all of Manhattan right away (that particular night, we had just six hours to redo every glove, and get them back on-site before the first guest arrived). We made it happen. We always make it happen. That’s the power of relationships. And when the client nods and says, “It’s perfect. This is exactly what we wanted,” every minute under pressure becomes worth it.\n\n\tOne evening on the night of an opening at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, rain came down in sheets just as the show was set to begin. Within mere minutes, we had sourced and distributed hundreds of umbrellas so guests stayed dry and the energy stayed intact.\n\n\tI’ve taken 2 a.m. crisis calls, while pregnant, troubleshooting a high-profile musician hired for a next day performance who now was unable to perform.\n\n\tThese are the moments the public never sees. They’re also the moments that define my career. That’s the part no one teaches you: Relentlessness. You earn it through rolling up sleeves and the feeling of precision and the sense of responsibility that you owe yourself and your clients. When you do what you love, it’s a process that becomes extremely sacred and personal. We treat every event like we’re hosting people in our own home: The pacing, warmth and the way the experience unfolds. Everything is intentional. Everything is designed to feel effortless.\n\n\tAnd then there are the requests that arrive out of (almost) thin air. On the morning of a VIP preview, a partner decided on a very exciting pivot. We needed 3,000 green plastic balls for a last-minute immersive forest lake installation. The only issue: Every, and I mean every, single store sold them in multicolor packs. So we sent teams all over Southern California, bought out the inventory and hand-sorted thousands of balls until only the green ones remained. Guests, and all of the internet as the project trended, saw a perfect, seamless installation. They’ll never know what it took, and honestly, that’s the point. We donated the balls to a local school after for their play-yard, all of the colors, to minimize waste.\n\t\n\n\tThat’s why clients come to us and stay with us: They know we will say yes; they know we will perform; and they know the outcome will shape the future of their brand. We say yes because there’s no event we’ve faced to date where we haven’t excitedly figured it out. We anticipate needs, we have a network that spans industries and time zones, and we are uncompromising in the way we solve problems.\n\n\t“No” isn’t in our vocabulary at Gold Sky. The only question is “how?”. And in an era obsessed with shortcuts and automation, we’ve proven again and again that while it can help, in our industry nothing beats deep experience, a commitment to excellence, years of business relationships, and the instinct and intuition necessary for the kind of hospitality that makes people feel something real. That makes people feel they are part of something larger.\n\n\tAt Gold Sky, that feeling is everything. It’s what turns an event into an experience, and an experience into a memory: The unforgettable moments building community in real time, where people show up, connect, and soon realize they’ve just stepped into one hell of an event.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWestwood’s historic Village Theater, which was acquired by the Village Directors Circle, will partner with the American Cinematheque to program and operate the venue. The partnership was announced Tuesday by Cinematheque chair Rick Nicita and Jason Reitman.\n\n\tThe theater in Los Angeles’ Westwood Village will continue to host major premieres plus first-run films and retrospective programming, with the goal to open in 2027.\n\n\n\tLed by Reitman, the group of filmmakers that took over the theater in early 2024 is now known as the Village Directors Circle. More than 30 directors are involved, including Steven Spielberg, Denis Villeneuve, Lulu Wang, J.J. Abrams, Ryan Coogler, James Gunn, Chloé Zhao, Guillermo del Toro, Christopher Nolan and Gina Prince-Bythewood.\n\t\n\n\tThe Directors Circle has committed to fundraising to restore and remodel the hundred-year-old movie palace into a multi-purpose screening and event facility. The American Cinematheque will program, manage and be the operating partner for the 1,000 seat-plus venue, with participation from the filmmakers.\n\n\tReitman said in a statement, “Last year, some of the greatest living directors rallied to save a Los Angeles monument, the Village Theater in Westwood. We often like to think of movie theaters as churches. If so, the Village is a cathedral, and with the American Cinematheque, we found our congregation.”\n\n\tIn addition to programming new theatrical releases, the theater will host special sceenings with in-person conversations, awards season events, retrospectives and tributes, as well as the Cinematheque’s programming such as Beyond Fest, Bleak Week, This Is Not a Fiction and Ultra Cinematheque 70. \n\t\n\n\tIn the lobby, the theater will exhibit artifacts from the collections of Directors Circle members and include concessions, retail kiosks and an event space for premieres. \n\n\t“Partnering with the brilliant and virtuoso Village Directors Circle to renovate the Village Theater is an exciting milestone for the American Cinematheque. We are thrilled to bring our expertise in film programming to Westwood, breathing new life into this iconic venue. Our goal is to create a vibrant cultural hub that not only celebrates cinema but also enriches the community and welcomes audiences from all over Los Angeles and the world,” Nicita said. \n\n\tReitman added, “The American Cinematheque shares the directors’ vision for showcasing new work, rediscovering classics, and building filmmaker-curated programs. The Village Theater has also been the home for show-stopping Hollywood premieres since 1930, and we’re committed to carrying that tradition forward. We want to give audiences a place to experience the films they love with the people they love.”\n\n\tReitman and the Cinematheque are in the “quiet phase” of a $25 million capital campaign to transform the space, and Reitman said in the statement he is “very excited by early leadership commitments by individuals and a major technology sponsor, with construction scheduled to commence early next year.”\n\n\tThe other filmmakers involved in the effort are Judd Apatow, Damien Chazelle, Chris Columbus, Bradley Cooper, Alfonso Cuarón, Jonathan Dayton, Valerie Faris, Hannah Fidell, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Sian Heder, Gil Kenan, Karyn Kusama, Justin Lin, Phil Lord, David Lowery, Christopher McQuarrie, Chris Miller, Alexander Payne, Todd Phillips, Jay Roach, Seth Rogen, Emma Seligman, Brad Silberling and Emma Thomas.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAriana Grande is doubling down on the status of her upcoming “Eternal Sunshine” tour. The singer and actress is returning to the stage for her first arena tour in seven years. Grande said in an interview on Amy Poehler’s Good Hang podcast that the trek will be a one-time event, with no plans for future tours.\n\n\t“The last 10 or 15 years will look very different to the ones that are coming up,” Grande told Poehler. “I don’t want to say anything definitive. I do know that I’m very excited to do this small tour, but I think it might not happen again for a long, long, long, long, long time. I’m going to give it my all and it’s going to be beautiful. I think that’s why I’m doing it because I’m like, ‘One last hurrah!’”\n\t\n\n\tThe “Eternal Sunshine” Tour kicks off on June 6 in Oakland, Calif., and makes stops across the country in cities including Los Angeles, Austin, Atlanta, Brooklyn, Boston and more, before wrapping up in North America in Chicago on Aug. 5. She will go on to perform a string of 10 shows in London.\n\n\tGrande also opened up about her character in the upcoming comedy film, “Focker In-Law,” as part of the “Meet the Parents” franchise. “My character is a triathlete,” she said. “I spent yesterday doing burpees and high knees with Robert De Niro. I’m like, ‘What is this movie? What are we doing?’ But I’m having a blast. It’s really special.”\n\n\tWatch the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Line of Duty,” the hit BBC crime drama that last aired in 2021, is set to make its return. \n\n\tThe show — created by Jed Mercurio and produced by World Productions — is coming back for a seventh season, with lead stars Martin Compston, Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar reprising their roles.\n\n\tIn the upcoming six-part season, the fictional police anti-corruption unit AC-12 has been disbanded and rebranded the Inspectorate of Police Standards. Anti-corruption work has never been more difficult and in this challenging climate Steve Arnott (Compston), Kate Fleming (McClure) and Ted Hastings (Dunbar) are assigned their most sensitive case so far. Detective Inspector Dominic Gough, a charismatic officer winning plaudits for a string of takedowns of organised crime, is accused of abusing his position of trust to act as a sexual predator. But is Gough’s case a deliberate distraction from a bigger threat still operating in the shadows?\n\t\n\n\tSeason seven will start filming in Belfast in Spring 2026, with further cast to be announced in due course.\n\n\n\t“Everyone involved in Line of Duty feels enormous gratitude to the show’s fans,” said Mercurio. “We’re privileged to have had so many of you follow the ups and downs of AC-12 over six previous seasons and we couldn’t be more delighted to be returning for a seventh. Corruption in this country is supposed to have come to an end while Line of Duty was off air so I’ve been forced to use my imagination.”\n\n\t“Line of Duty” last aired in 2021, and the series six finale was the U.K.’s biggest drama episode [excluding soap operas] since modern records began in 2002, with 17 million viewers after 28 days. The series averaged a huge 16 million viewers, making it the biggest drama across the market since 2018. In the U.S. and Canada, BritBox exclusively premiered the sixth season.\n\t\n\n\t“There have been a number of significant reunions in recent years, but few more keenly anticipated than the return of AC12,” said Simon Heath, World Productions’ CEO and creative director. “It’s a privilege to be back with Jed’s terrific new chapter of the Line of Duty story.”\n\n\tAdded Lindsay Salt, director of BBC Drama: “Line of Duty is beloved by audiences and critics alike and its amazing ratings are a true testament to the success of Jed’s writing, the work from the brilliant team at World Productions and the entire cast and crew. I’m so pleased that after four long years Line of Duty will be back filming soon and can’t wait for BBC viewers to be back on the edge of their seats.”\n\n\t“Line of Duty” is written and created by Jed Mercurio and made by World Productions, part of ITV Studios, which is handling international distribution. It will be directed by Jennie Darnell and the producer is Ken Horn. The executive producers are Mercurio, Heath for World Productions and Nick Lambon for the BBC. “Line of Duty” is made with support from Northern Ireland Screen.\n\n\t“As we count down the AC12 days of Christmas what a joy it is to know that the Three Amigos will be back filming together next year,” said Dunbar. “Delighted with the news and looking forward to those mercurial twists and turns.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tAfter garnering the 2024 Oscar for the Ukraine war documentary “20 Days in Mariupol,” Frontline’s editor-in-chief and executive producer Raney Arons",
    "body": "\n\tAfter garnering the 2024 Oscar for the Ukraine war documentary “20 Days in Mariupol,” Frontline’s editor-in-chief and executive producer Raney Aronson-Rath knew that, despite streamers’ aversion to political fare, audiences around the world were hungry for investigative journalistic content. Aronson-Rath’s conviction has led to the formation of Frontline Features, a new documentary production and distribution initiative.\n\n\tThe first four official Frontline Features productions include two Oscar contenders — “2000 Meters to Andriivka” and “Antidote” — the short doc “Status: Venezuelan,” and an upcoming feature documentary, “One in a Million.”\n\t\n\n\tThe new banner will be led by Aronson-Rath, an Oscar-winning producer who has expanded the PBS Frontline series’ traditional broadcast reporting into the critically acclaimed documentary space. Under Aronson-Rath’s leadership, Frontline has earned three Academy Award nominations since 2018 for “Abacus: Small Enough to Jail,” “For Sama,” and “20 Days in Mariupol,” which garnered the Oscar for best documentary feature in 2024.\n\n\n\t“I see Frontline Features as an extension of our [Frontline] mission — to produce trustworthy, impactful journalism that’s widely accessible to all audiences,” says Aronson-Rath.\n\n\tEach year, Frontline Features will either commission or come in at the early stages of three to five doc projects — both features and shorts. Each film will premiere at a festival, go on the fest circuit, and then have a theatrical run of at least two weeks.\n\n\t“We would prefer to partner with theaters like we recently did with the Film Forum on ‘2000 Meters to Andriivka,'” Aronson-Rath says. “But we will just be strategic because we really do believe in the power of the theater. We believe in people convening and being together. It sounds so simple, but it really is so powerful still.”\n\t\n\n\tA Frontline Features doc’s theatrical release will be followed by a PBS broadcast debut and a worldwide streaming launch on PBS App and YouTube, under PBS’s multiyear deal with the streaming giant. The Frontline YouTube channel has 3.2 million subscribers and offers more than 70 feature-length films and over 300 Frontline documentaries.\n\n\t“Hopefully, our contribution to the documentary community is that Frontline Features films start with distribution,” says Aronson-Rath. “We can’t do everything. We can’t fix the whole marketplace, but we can contribute because we really do believe in the documentary form as a form. Platforms have films, but for us, we have a different mission in mind, which is to ensure that these films are seen. They should be in front of the paywall and should be accessible to everyone. So, it’s a different strategy, but I think it’s a really important one. I mean, it shouldn’t be the only strategy, but it certainly is a good strategy for a world that needs these films.”\n\n\t“20 Days in Mariupol,” directed by Pulitzer Prize-winning AP journalist Mstyslav Chernov, screened at 350 theaters worldwide and currently has 3.7 million views on YouTube.\n\n\t“Before I made ’20 Days in Mariupol,’ I knew as a journalist investigator, how hard things are in the documentary community and for those people who make social impact of films because they are not easy to watch and because sometimes they are political,” says Chernov. “Certain streamers or distributors don’t want to deal with those topics. They would rather deal with more entertaining topics. But Frontline has never been afraid to deal with these difficult topics, and they have this dedicated audience. So, Frontline Features is exciting because everybody seems to be doing worse and worse in our community. So for someone to actually make an attempt to expand the reach and to make a bigger impact, and to support more filmmakers — it’s invaluable.”\n\n\tAccording to Aronson-Rath, young people are watching Frontline doc features on mobile devices, which is why her team will create short clips from the feature films for Instagram and other social media platforms.\n\n\t“Mini shorts reach millions of people,” says Aronson-Rath. “Hopefully, those will bring people back to the long form. We are taking a very wide-reaching, audience-driven approach to this, so we can reach people all across the globe.”\n\t\n\n\tPaula Kerger, President and CEO of PBS, says, “Frontline Features is an exciting evolution of our longstanding commitment to serving audiences with trusted journalism.”\n\n\tThe Frontline Features division will be led by Frontline’s senior editorial team. The Frontline Features advisory council will be led by Oscar-winning filmmaker Nina Fialkow, and will include filmmakers and journalists such as Simon Kilmurry, Michelle Mizner, Dan Edge, and Chernov.\n\n\t“I’m very devoted to the whole idea of public television and, in particular, Frontline,” says Fialkow, a leading member of Impact Partners. “I believe in fact-based journalistic documentaries, and I want to continue to support the documentary community and support Raney in the best way that I can.”\n\n\t“2000 Meters to Andriivka” is the latest collaboration between Fronline and The Associated Press. Frontline’s “Status: Venezuelan” is in partnership with ProPublica and premiered at Double Exposure Film Festival and the upcoming “One in a Million” was made in partnership with BBC Storyville and will premiere in 2026.\n\n\tFrontline is supported by PBS, various foundations, and individual financial contributors.\n",

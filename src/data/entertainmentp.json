    "body": "\n\tThe next time the NFL doesn’t like the way ESPN covers the league, its executives can go right to the boss — by looking in the mirror.\n\n\tThe Disney sports-media giant and the massive professional football league confirmed late Saturday that they had closed a deal that makes the NFL a minority stakeholder in ESPN, which will in exchange gain control over NFL Network and the popular NFL RedZone highlights service. The tie-up is likely to boost the appeal of a  ESPN’s new direct-to-consumer streaming service and surfaces as the soaring economics of sports have forced traditional media companies to seek new models that will help them keep big-game coverage on their schedules.\n\t\n\n\t“The NFL and ESPN are pleased to announce the official closing of the sale of NFL Network and other NFL Media assets to ESPN. With the closing, we will begin integrating NFL employees into ESPN in the months ahead,” ESPN and the NFL said in a joint statement. “As we look to the future, NFL fans can look forward to expanded NFL programming, greater access to NFL Network, innovative Fantasy experiences and unparalleled coverage of America’s most popular sport.”\n\n\n\tThe deal with Disney will give the NFL a 10% stake in ESPN, which estimates from the sports advisory firm Octagon value at as much as $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion. The Athletic previously reported the deal had closed.\n\n\tThe pact is the most recent example of sports entities and media companies combining business. Fox recently took a 33% stake in Penske Entertainment, which owns the IndyCar motor racing series as well as Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Fox also owns part of the nascent United Football League. ESPN in June took a stake in the Premier Lacrosse League, in addition to striking a new five-year rights deal with the organization. Warner Bros. Discovery is a part owner of the upstart women’s basketball league Unrivaled.\n\t\n\n\tThese new types of team-ups make increasing sense in an era when sports rights have become critical for media companies that want to attract broad audiences — something advertisers and distributors still crave, even as consumers migrate to watching video favorites on demand, at times of their own choosing.  At the same time, the price tag for keeping sports in the portfolio is soaring exponentially, even as many traditional media companies are grappling with dips in advertising and distribution.\n\n\tViewers of ESPN and NFL Network will not notice any major changes immediately. The NFL media’s employees will officially become a part of ESPN in April,  according to people familiar with the matter. NFL Network will be integrated into ESPN’s streaming outlet at the start of the next regular season in the fall.\n\n\tNFL games are, at least so far in the streaming era, the most stable pieces of property a media company can get. The broadcasts are typically the most-watched of the last few years. And yet, the economics of the cable networks showing the games aren’t so robust.\n\n\t Thanks to the widespread adoption of streaming, the ESPN and ESPN2 cable networks are each projected to see their subscribers drop to 57.9 million and 57.8 million respectively by the end of 2026, according to data from Kagan, a research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence, compared with 61.4 million each at the end of 2025. The NFL Network, meanwhile, has seen its subscriber base drop steadily, according to Kagan, to 46.7 million in 2024, compared with 72.3 million in 2023.\n\n\tThe alliance may also serve Disney well in the not-too-distant future. In its last set of rights deals struck for a 11-year period starting with the 2022 season, the NFL won the right to overhaul its contracts and seek better terms after 2029. Owning a piece of ESPN could well keep the league from seeking a re-do of rights for ESPN’s “Monday Night Football.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tKaley Cuoco seems to have caught the international thriller bug. The actress followed up her decade-plus stint on “The Big Bang Theory” with two seasons of “The Flight Attendant,” the globe-trotting tale of an alcoholic aviation worker in over her head. Now, she stars in and executive produces the MGM+ series “Vanished,” a more compressed but broadly similar yarn largely set and shot in Marseille. Perhaps more than a decade spent on a Burbank backlot induced a bit of wanderlust in the Emmy-nominated performer.\n\t\n\n\tMuch like Cassie of “The Flight Attendant,” Cuoco’s character in “Vanished” is a woman with an interesting yet firmly civilian job in way over her head. Instead of waking up next to a corpse, though, archaeologist Alice Monroe gets on a train with Tom Parker (Sam Claflin of “The Hunger Games” franchise), her saintly doctor boyfriend of several years, for a romantic getaway to Arles — only for Tom to step away and never return to their seats. In a device far too overused in this genre, an opening flashback indicates that Alice’s amateur investigation into where Tom went will put her in mortal danger. But it also doesn’t take her long: “Vanished,” which was directed by “Spice World” producer Barnaby Thompson and written by Thompson’s son Preston, spans only four episodes, leading to a rushed conclusion that doesn’t have time to unpack the implications of its sensational reveals. (David Hilton is credited as co-creator with Preston.)\n\n\n\tAs a result of this brevity and the aforementioned parallels with “The Flight Attendant,” “Vanished” often feels like a slighter redux of a mode Cuoco has already explored at greater length and depth. Alice has the same sarcastic charm as other products of Cuoco’s comedic background, but here the performance feels like it’s fighting against an otherwise straightforwardly dramatic tone. I kept wishing “Vanished” would play into the comedy of Alice’s fish-out-of-water situation; maybe the plot could be a spoof on the modern dating concept of ghosting, but with assassins and human traffickers instead of unanswered texts. After all, Tom takes off right after Alice suggests the two settle down in New Jersey, where she’s just been offered a job at Princeton, rather than sporadically meet up in exotic locales when their schedules allow. Instead, the series’ humor is rare and often rooted in stereotypes so stale I wasn’t sure if the joke was intentional, like a local police chief (Simon Abkarian) who refuses to meet with a panicked Alice because he’s late to the cinema.\n\t\n\n\tDue to Tom’s disappearance, Claflin is largely absent outside of flashbacks that show the couple’s meet-cute in Jordan, where Alice was digging for artifacts and Tom distributed vaccines for a pro-refugee NGO called SOS Global. In a weird way, it’s a nice change of pace for the male half of a heterosexual relationship to be the subject of such slow-motion, sepia-toned nostalgia, motivating his partner on her present-tense quest for answers. No matter which gender gets this treatment, however, it’s still a reductive way to communicate character, and we don’t get much of a sense of Alice and Tom’s relationship beyond her understandable attraction to a kindly care worker with cut-glass cheekbones.\n\n\tWith Tom off God knows where, Alice teams up with French journalist Hélène (Karin Viard) — who just so happens to be on the train when he goes missing — to track him down. Their investigation takes them to the Marseille offices of SOS Global, where Tom’s colleague Alex (Matthias Schweighöfer) offers context on his state of mind. If “Vanished” is not especially enticing as a mystery, it’s at least a handy visual tour of an exciting, underrated city, from the rocky seaside to graffiti-lined public squares. Shooting on location pays off, even if I don’t love the way shots of a predominantly Middle Eastern neighborhood are used to emphasize Alice’s sense of vulnerability and danger after Tom disappears. Cuoco’s professional success has given her the opportunity to travel the world on the clock, one she’s taken full advantage of — but it may be time for the actor to settle down stateside, or at least change things up.\n\n\tAll four episodes of “Vanished” are now streaming on MGM+.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Norwegian director Maria Sødahl (“Hope”) first got contacted by a duo of Danish scriptwriters with the seed for what would become the now Göteborg Dragon Award-winning “The Last Resort,” she was “fascinated” by its provocation. \n\n\tThe film is set in a luxurious holiday resort, where a Danish family is forced to reassess its moral compass following an accident involving an Afghan refugee. Sødahl penned the script alongside Therese Hasman and Eske Troelstrup, while the film stars Esben Smed (“Follow the Money”) and Danica Curcic (“Murina”). Speaking with Variety following her Göteborg win, Sødahl says what first drew her to the story was its “very consistent point of view.” “It’s a story about us, for us, by us, white, privileged Scandinavians. That is the most genuine thing about the movie, which is also provocative. You need to understand the privilege of that situation.”\n\t\n\n\t‘It fascinated me to investigate the well-meaning humanistic gaze we have as Scandinavians sitting so safely up north,” she adds. “You can believe all these nice theories about taking in migrants, but when theory meets practice, there are these subconscious challenges that occur. Dealing with xenophobia can be quite ugly and primal, but we don’t have that awareness because it’s not something we deal with daily. We live in our bubble with our theories and virtues.”\n\n\n\tThe director clarifies, however, that “The Last Resort” is “not about the migrant crisis.” “The movie is about how we, privileged people, deal with the non-privileged. It’s about our self-image as being good human beings, and how this changes when we meet reality close up.”\n\t\n\n\t“There are no answers to what is right or wrong in this story because whatever you do would be wrong,” she points out. “All I really want is for people to identify with the characters: what would I have done in this very uncomfortable situation?”\n\n\tSødahl says the film is also about a certain “Scandinavian naivety.” “If you go to the Mediterranean, they have had immigrants and refugees for hundreds of years, and they themselves have fled their countries. They know what it feels like to be an outsider. We haven’t experienced that. Norwegians immigrated to the United States.”\n\n\tRecalling the production itself, Sødahl says the challenge was to “keep the drama down all the time, so there would be an underlying stream going on until it all explodes in this very ugly situation.” “It was tricky to find the right tone because this is a drama, it’s not satire. It’s a movie where you really need to believe in it. It’s a fiction, of course, but you have to feel a sense of truth so as not to feel you’re being manipulated.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Last Resort team\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t‘The Last Resort’ team, celebrating its top prize at the 2026 Góteborg Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\tShot in the Canary Islands, “The Last Resort” granted the Norwegian director the chance to cast a large ensemble of non-professional actors, real-life migrants who worked closely with Sødahl on the production. The film also features two child actors through most of its runtime, a challenging ask logistically, but not so much when it comes to the sensitive themes of the film. The director emphasizes that the children “learned very quickly” that they were on a film set. “The adults were very aware that the same situation that we see in the film with the migrants was happening in real-life, very close to them.”\n\n\tAs for premiering close to home in Göteborg, Sødahl says she is “grateful” for the space, especially given the “challenging nature” of the film. “This is not an easy movie to get distribution for and to get into A-list festivals because of its DNA.”\n\n\t“This is not a documentary, it’s a moral fable,” she adds. “It could be on any islands where you have resources for the privileged. Someone told me it’s like ‘The White Lotus’ for real [laughs] Some people compared it to Ruben Östlund, which is not, because this is not a satire. The shame, the guilt and the fear of the other is timeless. From the beginning, I always saw the island as the world and you have the resort as Europe, this gated fortress which you can’t enter.”\n\t\n\n\tAsked about the current momentum of her home country’s film industry following Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” landing a whopping nine Oscar nominations, Sødahl — who worked with the film’s star Stellan Skarsgård in the 2021 Oscar-shortlisted “Hope” — says she “loves to see what is happening.” \n\n\t“The Danes have had their peak and now it’s Norway’s moment,” she adds. “I hope it’s good for all of us, Sweden as well, because there’s this attention to our part of the world and our way of storytelling. We can also do stories for the world.”\n\n\tAlas, the filmmaker wraps her celebration with a caution: “At the same time, the film politics in Norway are hopeless, so it’s a momentum for the arts but not for how the country deals with the arts. Norway is a sports nation, not a culture nation. If [the Oscar attention] had happened with sports, the money would have poured in, and you don’t see this happening with film.” \n\n\t“The Last Resort” is produced by Nordisk Film Production’s Thomas Robsahm (“The Worst Person in the World”) and Sigurd Mikal Karoliussen (“Twin”). Norway’s Eye Eye Pictures (“Armand”) co-produced, with support from the Danish Film Institute, the Norwegian Film Institute, Nordisk Film & TV Fond, in association with TV2 Denmark. TrustNordisk handles international sales.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Melania,” a documentary that shadows the first lady of the United States in the lead-up to Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration, is eclipsing box office expectations. \n\n\tThe film has generated $7.04 million from 1,778 North American theaters, a huge start for a documentary (especially one that doesn’t involve music and isn’t about a concert). Projections fluctuated throughout the weekend,  launched above pre-release projections of $3 million to $5 million. Amazon MGM spent a staggering amount of money on the film, acquiring the doc for $40 million and then shelling out $35 million on the marketing spend. Theater owners keep about half of ticket sales, which will make it difficult to justify the theatrical cost of “Melania.” \n\t\n\n\tHowever, a deep-pocketed streamer like Amazon cares about much more than box office grosses; the studio plans to recoup some of its costs when “Melania” lands on its Prime streaming service after its theatrical run. “Melania” will need to generate around $40 million to $45 million at the domestic box office to break even, according to sources familiar with the economics of similar films. Those sources believe that “Melania” has secured lucrative licensing deals that will offset the high promotional costs.\n\n\n\t“We’re very encouraged by the strong start and positive audience response, with early box office for ‘Melania’ exceeding our expectations,” says Amazon MGM’s head of domestic theatrical distribution Kevin Wilson. “This momentum is an important first step in what we see as a long-tail lifecycle for both the film and the forthcoming docu-series, extending well beyond the theatrical window and into what we believe will be a significant run for both on our service. We are confident in the long-term value this rollout will deliver to customers both in theaters, and for years to come on Prime Video.” \n\t\n\n\tFor “Melania,” opening weekend crowds were mostly older women; 72% of ticket buyers were female and 83% were above the age of 45, according to Amazon MGM. Nearly 75% of audiences were white, with Hispanic, the next-largest demo, at 11% of ticket buyers. Meanwhile the top moviegoing markets were outside of traditional locations like New York City and Los Angeles and included Dallas, Orlando, Tampa, Phoenix and West Palm Beach — cities where the president is popular. “Melania” may have one of the largest discrepancies between audience sentiments and critical reviews; the film boasts an “A” grade on CinemaScore exit polls as well as a blistering 6% average on Rotten Tomatoes. \n\n\tThere’s been outsized media coverage about “Melania,” at least compared to other documentaries, because of the lavish price tag and the president’s own promotional push. (He called “Melania” a “must watch” and claimed that showtimes are “selling out, FAST!” on social media platforms. Meanwhile the film’s subject tweeted over the weekend the doc is “loved by all.”) Amazon MGM’s mega spend for “Melania” has raised questions about the company’s motivations: Was this film really about its interest in an insider account of the White House or an attempt to cozy up to the current administration? \n\n\t“As good as this opening is for a documentary, for any other film, opening like this — against $75 million in costs with very little foreign potential — would be a problem. But this is a political investment, not a for-profit movie venture,” suggests David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “If it helps Amazon with a regulatory, taxation, tariff or other government issue, then it will pay back; $75 million is insignificant to Amazon.”\n\n\t“Melania” is opening in theaters against a backdrop of political unrest, with ICE raids in Minneapolis and other parts of the country prompting a bipartisan backlash. Brett Ratner, whose credits include “Rush Hour” and “X-Men: The Last Stand,” directed the film, marking the first project since his career was derailed in 2017 by sexual assault allegations. (He has denied those accusations.) Rolling Stone reported that two-thirds of the crew members who worked on “Melania” in New York asked that their names not be formally credited on the documentary.\n\t\n\n\t“Melania” placed at No. 3 on domestic box office charts behind two fellow newcomers, Sam Raimi’s survival thriller “Send Help” and YouTube creator Markiplier’s very indie adventure “Iron Lung.”\n\n\tAfter a close race, “Send Help” narrowly pulled ahead with $20 million from 3,475 North American locations. Disney and 20th Century’s film collected a softer-than-expected $8.1 million at the international box office, bringing its global tally to $28 million. That’s a solid start for the $40 million production, which is expected to stick around beyond its debut, thanks to great word-of-mouth and enthusiasm for original horror.\n\n\t“Send Help” brought out a younger male crowd; 53% were men while 53% were between the ages of 18 to 34. The R-rated film earned a positive “B+” grade on CinemaScore exit polls and a 93% Rotten Tomatoes average from critics. Rachel McAdams and Dylan O’Brien star in “Send Help” as a looked-over employee and her toxic boss, who get stranded on a deserted island after a plane crash. \n\n\t“Iron Lung” impressed in second place with $18 million from 3,015 cinemas. This turnout is especially notable because ticket sales nearly matched the result of a major release from Disney but without mainstream resources. Markiplier (his real name is Mark Fischback) wrote, directed, financed and distributed “Iron Lung” against a reported $3 million budget. \n\n\tEven if the film’s box office performance is front-loaded, meaning “Iron Lung” quickly runs out of steam, it’ll be a hugely successful endeavor for Fischback, who boasts 73 million followers across digital platforms. The YouTube star also leads the post-apocalyptic adventure, which is based on the 2022 indie video game and follows a fugitive who has to scavenge natural resources in an ocean of blood after a rapture. “Iron Lung” doesn’t have a CinemaScore but boasts a 90% audience average on Rotten Tomatoes. According to exit polls, 60% of inaugural crowds were male and 85% were between 18 and 34 years old. Meanwhile 71% cited “an actor in the lead role” as their main reason for wanting to see the film.\n\n\t“‘Iron Lung’ is an extension of the Markiplier online phenomenon. This kind of thing happens a couple times a year when a fan frenzy comes to the movies from another medium,” Gross says. “It’s good news every time; it jolts the market with fresh energy.”\n\t\n\n\t“Shelter” tumbled to the No. 6 spot with $5.5 million from 2,726 theaters in its first weekend of release. That’s a dismal start against its $50 million production budget. The R-rated film was directed by Ric Roman Waugh, the filmmaker behind a slew of Gerard Butler-led action thrillers like “Greenland” and “Angel Has Fallen.” It follows a reclusive man who unwittingly sets off a violent chain reaction after he rescues a young girl from drowning in a terrible storm. “Shelter” is being released by newer distributor Black Bear, which plans to unveil the Matthew McConaughey-led “The Rivals of Amziah King,” ensemble comedy “Spa Weekend” and Guy Ritchie’s “Wife and Dog” over the next few months.\n\n\tIn limited release, A24’s Charli xcx mockumentary “The Moment” scored with $427,940 from four screens — averaging $106,985 per location. A24 says it’s the third biggest limited opening of the post-COVID era as well as one of the biggest for A24 all-time behind only “Marty Supreme” and “Uncut Gems.” It’s unclear how the momentum will sustain when “The Moment” expands nationwide. However, the Charli-centric movie doesn’t need to reach the box office heights of “Marty Supreme” or “Uncut Gems” to be financially successful; “The Moment” carries a modest $4 million price tag.\n\n\tOverall this weekend was 83% above the previous frame, which was hobbled by a massive winter storm, though 5% below the same period last year. Through the first month of the year, grosses are 13% above 2025. Hollywood and cinema owners are hoping a range of blockbusters —  from “Avengers: Doomsday” and “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” to Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey” and “The Super Mario Galaxy Movie” — will keep up momentum and propel revenues near pre-pandemic heights.\n\n\tMore to come…\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs images of ICE raids and reactionary protests dominate global headlines, Felipe Bustos Sierra’s documentary “Everybody to Kenmure Street” acts as a vital contextualization of Scottish history and of recent community action in the face of uniformed overreach. Chronicling an impromptu demonstration in 2021 in a sleepy Glasgow enclave, the film wields its combination of archival footage, re-enactments, social media clips and contemporary interviews to highlight the fabric of a neighborhood coming together to protect two of its own, while tensions build between the people and state.\n\t\n\n\tFive minutes can be an eternity in montage time, but the movie’s lengthy introduction is a daring announcement of historical scope. Its opening frames — of old photographs of suffragettes, sketched maps of slave routes and TV footage of ’70s union rallies against the Thatcher government — help couch its modern (and distinctly ordinary) citizenry within the kind of extraordinary political traditions and sordid histories we all secretly possess. By the time the central premise fades into view, and a U.K. Immigration Enforcement van sits outside an unassuming brownstone, Bustos Sierra and editor Colin Monie have already invigorated the viewer.\n\n\n\tThe Pollokshields area in Glasgow, home to a heavily Muslim community, falls victim to one of the U.K. Home Office’s “dawn raids” on the morning of Eid al-Fitr, a holy day in the Islamic calendar. The incursion feels pointed, but before two Sikh immigrants can be whisked away — men who have lived there a decade or longer — a slight commotion begins. Interviews of residents present that morning are accompanied by cellphone clips from curious onlookers (on the street and up above) as rumors and hearsay are soon clarified, revealing that an anonymous man has taken it upon himself to crawl under the vehicle to prevent it from leaving with the arrested migrants, at great personal risk. As the day wears on, the interview subjects recall their WhatsApp groups lighting up, until more people from the surrounding buildings add to the sea of residents stopping the van from taking off. Meanwhile, even more neon-vested cops from Scotland Yard arrive to assist their fellow officers.\n\t\n\n\t“Everybody to Kenmure Streets” finds its power in gradually building rhythms. Its assortment of recollections consists, for the most part, of first-hand accounts from residents seated at acute angles from the interview camera against colorful backdrops. Their positioning seems awkward at first, but it frames these average citizens as the subjects of regal portraitures. White and South Asian alike, they speak of taking action to protect their neighbors as though it were the obvious thing to do, which is nothing if not inspiring. However, some people present that day, glimpsed in COVID masks — such as the man beneath the van and a nurse reaching out to check on him for lengthy periods — don’t show up themselves. Instead, in order to protect their identities, their words are read aloud during re-enactments by powerhouse actresses such as Emma Thompson (who squeezes herself beneath an axle) and Kate Dickie (performing, as the nurse, on all fours on Kenmure Street itself).\n\n\tFrom lawyers and politicians to local teachers and Imams, the sea of sit-down interviewees grows as quickly and noticeably as the number of protesters on the day itself. As this in-person crowd increases — along with impassioned chants and provisions of food and refreshment — so too does the tension between the people and police. The situation hurtles ever forward toward the threat of eruption, though not without the movie making deftly timed detours toward historical context.\n\n\tThe citizenry seen in “Everybody to Kenmure Street” isn’t just active and willing, but informed. The interviewees are thus able to articulate not only the contemporary political milieu and Glaswegians’ famous (and early) support for Nelson Mandela, but the dark past of their own city as a hub of the Transatlantic slave trade. Together, the filmmakers and their subjects not only connect these various dots, but express — in rousing, essayistic fashion — the manner in which this history is filtered down into the now, and the ways this modern tug-of-war between the state and proletariat has emerged from both proud traditions and those which remain unconfronted.\n\n\tUltimately, “Everybody to Kenmure Street” is a film about power, who currently wields it, and how it can be snatched back by communities in the name of solidarity. Although its focus is on one corner of a larger skirmish, its collection of images — of growing dissent among people who simply want to live their lives unbothered by racist policies — becomes incredibly energizing, as Bustos Sierra carefully captures and pays tribute to everyday people coming together to put that power back where it belongs.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFresh off her Oscar nomination for “Sentimental Value,” Renate Reinsve transforms in “Butterfly” – visually, too. \n\n\t“Itonje wanted me to move away from how I’ve looked before. Lily went against normal beauty norms,” she says.\n\n\t“It made a lot of sense for this character, who had grown up being exploited because of her beauty. She’s trying to remove herself from the male gaze. At the same time, she enjoys provoking reactions, but without attracting anyone’s sexual attention.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the film, shown at Göteborg and IFFR, she plays Lily, a performance artist who reunites with her sister Diana (Helene Bjørneby) in the Canary Islands after their absent mother’s mysterious death.\n\n\n\t“It’s one of the hardest things we do, and it requires constant effort: trying to get over the hurt and pain caused by somebody’s actions. See a more nuanced picture or innocence of where that came from and be free,” she says. \n\n\t“You can tell how much strain these sisters have because of how they grew up, in such an unusual way. The only way to reconcile it is through each other.”\n\n\tNorwegian actor enjoyed being on set that felt like “a mix between a fictional movie and a documentary.” Mostly because of the non-professional actors who had a real connection to the places where they filmed.  \n\n\t“I love filmmakers who try to challenge the established,” she notes. \n\n\t“Itonje’s ideas come from somewhere else. It’s so unconventional and I really admire that. Hopefully, I’ll keep on working and learning from directors with different tastes and different ways of making movies.” \n\t\n\n\tItonje Søimer Guttormsen received arthouse recognition thanks to her previous feature “Gritt” about a polarizing character who actually makes a cameo in “Butterfly.” \n\n\t“She’s such an atypical female character. You love her on some level because she’s so hard to like. There’s something sympathetic about that,” admits Reinsve. \n\n\t“I definitely knew we were moving into the same landscape with Lily. She has many traits that make it difficult for her to blend in or function as expected, and she has no intention of changing. She’s in a constant fight with the world.” \n\n\tItonje Søimer Guttormsen jokes that she’s drawn to “difficult women.”  “Women who are fighting and finding strategies, perhaps because they were wounded, neglected or abused. But Lily and Gritt are quite different. Grit has projects and ideals, while Lily is quite selfish.” \n\n\t“Butterfly,” with its focus on strained family relationships, might be her most accessible work yet. It’s sold by Protagonist Pictures.\n\n\t“It’s quite relatable, and then it shifts gears and goes off-piste. Maybe it will encourage more audience members to join in, and then I’ll take them on a journey into the wild anyway.”\n\n\tShe adds: “I don’t want to compromise. I want to be bold in my art and dig deep. Still, I would love to reach out to a wider audience. ‘Commercial’ is not the right word, but this is my most inviting film.”\n\n\tHaving Reinsve as the lead certainly helped. “In Norway, it’s all very democratic. Everyone knows each other. When we started, she wasn’t yet on that level yet, but she’s a huge star now, so people will notice the film because of her. It’s a gift, but I just knew she was right for the role.”\n\n\tWith her outrageous looks, Lily certainly stands out. But there’s a method to the madness, assures the director. \n\n\t“Lily uses clothes to armor herself; that’s how she sets herself apart, also from her sister. She’s telling everyone: ‘I don’t belong here.’ But she’s also a chameleon. She adopts traits from the people she meets. I always saw her as worn-out and definitely not healthy, and of course Renate is amazingly beautiful. She was bold, embracing that and really curious about how to enhance her looks.”\n\t\n\n\tAs Guttormsen’s characters reluctantly decide to follow in their mother’s footsteps, they get to know her through the people who transformed her.\n\n\t“She’s made an incredible journey, which a lot of Norwegians have also made in Gran Canaria. It’s our most visited island and everyone has a relationship with it. She felt trapped and neglected her own children in order to escape, but then she built a healing retreat center for women. Now, after her death, she’s healing them too.”\n\n\tWith Norway on everyone’s lips because of the Oscar frenzy, Guttormsen hopes it will bring about concrete changes. \n\n\t“What’s happening with ‘Sentimental Value’ is just amazing. It has never really happened in Norway before. The whole industry is excited and a bit dizzy from it, and I hope it results in more funding. So many people are leaving their jobs as filmmakers,” she says.  \n\n\t“Sometimes, I see institutes focusing on just one tendency. It can be ‘we need more viewers’ or ‘we need more awards.’ Personally, I want to see a variety of filmmakers. For me, an Oscar is neither within my reach nor on my radar. So here’s to hoping there will be more space for other things as well.” \n\n\tAnd for more Gritt, who might still show up in the future.\n\n\t“I know I will meet her again. I would like to see how she ages and maybe make a whole film about that. She might not appear in my next, but maybe someone from ‘Butterfly’ will? With my films, I’m creating a whole universe. It’s my world.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs political conflicts grow around the world, major film festivals have rallied around displaced filmmakers. Amidst this movement, the Rotterdam Film Festival stands out as a particularly safe place for such creatives, given the festival’s foundational mission of platforming voices at risk. But how can industry-focused platforms and markets tap into that mission? That’s a key question for Head of IFFR Pro Marten Rabarts and Head of the Hubert Bals Fund, Tamara Tatishvili, as the duo gears up for another edition of the Dutch festival. \n\t\n\n\tDisplacement has further strengthened the relationship between the market and the fund, resulting in key initiatives delivered and managed within both. HBF has supported the Cate Blanchett-spearheaded Displacement Film Fund, which has just premiered its first batch of short films, including a new work by “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” director Mohammad Rasoulof. Launched last year, the fund will now move into a second round of grants. \n\n\n\tThis year also introduces Safe Harbor, IFFR’s new market program to lift up projects in development from emerging displaced filmmakers who face limited access to professional networks, funding pathways and development opportunities. The initiative is delivered in collaboration with the International Emerging Film Talent Fund (IEFTF).\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety ahead of the Pro activities kicking off in Rotterdam, Rabarts recalls how upsetting it was to feel “the world was on fire” while delivering the festival last year. “It became about: How do we support filmmakers? A year has gone by, and things have just gotten worse. It was clear to us in our selection that shining a spotlight on those stories was a strong parameter.”\n\t\n\n\tSafe Harbor came as an answer to that question, with IFFR Pro foregoing a minimum funding request, which usually revolved between 20% and 25%, as the team realized it “was not a possibility for people dealing with displacement. “We decided to drop the barriers and let our displaced filmmakers stand tall with their talent and story. The projects we are supporting in the inaugural edition of Safe Harbor are extremely complementary to the Displacement Film Fund’s ambitions.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMohammad Rasoulof (Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTatishvili makes a point of stating that these are all “informed moves,” not just talk around “big objectives.” “We’re experimenting and innovating because you can’t work the same model for 50 years. The mission should be the same, but the tools and partnerships need to evolve.”\n\n\tWorking with filmmakers at risk, however, brings a series of added logistical barriers. In this sense, both Martens and Tatishvili are particularly grateful for the malleability of their programs, and being able to develop and deliver initiatives at speeds that are not standard for major funders and markets elsewhere. \n\n\t“One of the strengths of a fund like ours and our ecosystem is that we can be more flexible than many other financiers,” says Tatishvili. “In many other roles, where the legal framework is more important, we would not be able to do some of those films. We had to be very agile. With many of these projects, we had to take serious security issues into account.”\n\n\tMartens mentions how the Pro team has worked closely with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure a Sudanese filmmaker could attend the festival this year. “We’ve been really pleased to have the support of government agencies. The inner logic of HBF and Pro launching Safe Harbor is not disconnected from Rotterdam being one of the founding members of the International Coalition of Filmmakers at Risk, an important organization that supports filmmakers living and working through conflict.”\n\n\tElsewhere in the agenda this year, Martens points out how IFFR Pro has more projects than “possibly ever.” “There are 21 cinema projects, eight projects in the Darkroom, eight in Lightroom, and four in Safe Harbor — 41 projects we’re bringing to the market. There’s something for everyone.” Selected projects include new films by “Samsara” director Lois Patiño (“Adarna”) and “Aisha Can’t Fly Away” helmer Morad Mostafa (“Animals”).\n\t\n\n\tThe exec emphasizes a desire to “reboot the market’s connection to the U.S. indie world,” bringing up Cinemart-selected project “The Dispute” by Andrea Ellsworth and Kasey Elise Walker as an example of that effort. “What does it mean for a young African American woman to be making a film in the U.S. right now? We had Cheryl Dunye here last year, a wonderful Black lesbian filmmaker who came to Europe to fund her next feature because, even though she’s been working on all the A-list series, she couldn’t find support for her next project in the U.S.”\n\n\tThe head of Pro also saw a strong return from Southeast Asian projects. “There is a renaissance of co-producing with Asia, particularly the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. These countries have started to work together. You see quite a few of them in our selection, looking for those final pieces of the co-production puzzle. It’s an exciting new development that we can play a role in something that is already happening organically in the region.”\n\n\tA tendency seen in the market over recent years is the increased number of partners required to secure funding for a co-production. Asked how IFFR Pro is adapting to accommodate this changing reality, Martens quips: “We are making bigger tables!”\n\n\t“I hope we are helping normalize that so it is understood as the new normal, given the circumstances of how films are funded these days,” he adds. “It’s a global phenomenon, and we’re just putting the infrastructure in place for it.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Secret Agent”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTatishvili adds that “with right-wing governments rising in Europe, funds are not as rich as they used to be.” This has led to new partnerships, including HBF+Brazil: Co-Development Support, delivered in partnership with RioFilme, Spcine and Projeto Paradiso, and dedicated to supporting the early development of projects by second- and third-time filmmakers from Brazil.\n\n\tThe head of the fund also highlights the importance of having high-profile alumni like Kleber Mendonça Filho return to the festival with an Oscar-nominated film like “The Secret Agent.” “They are happy to pass the knowledge forward,” she says. “That’s the best thing, because it’s absolutely not given that HBF will exist forever. I’m very blunt in telling this to filmmakers: if you want to have this type of flexible funding that really listens to your needs, tell the story of our impact. When I go out fundraising, the strength of my pitch is the filmmakers who made a career out of our support.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“There’s no room in our society for discrimination. None. I think it’s un-American.”\n\n\tIn 2013, Robert Redford stood before a group of his fellow Utahns and urged them to lend their voices to an anti-discrimination proposal that would prevent gender identity and sexual orientation from being a factor in a citizen seeking housing or employment.\n\n\tPraising “the power of collective action,” Redford expressed hope that their efforts could inspire change in other parts of the country. He ended his speech on a line from T.S. Eliot: “There is only the trying. The rest is not our business.” (The bill was passed 18 months later).\n\t\n\n\tRedford, among many things, was a pragmatist. He was well aware of the uphill battle to create systemic change, so he built an institution where ideas — the first step toward a solution — could take root. After dedicating a large part of his acting career to projects that spoke truth to power, he established the Sundance Film Festival to ensure future generations of creatives could be granted the same privilege he had been bestowed. In time, Sundance became the most influential film festival in the country.\n\n\n\tFlash forward to the festival’s final days in Park City in 2026. The ski town, typically blanketed in snow, saw a much thinner cover — mirroring the slow erosion of Sundance’s scrappy indie spirit. With a lineup of films dominated by A-list talent, many of whom were celebrated at after-parties hosted inside corporate pop-ups branded by the likes of Audible and Chase Sapphire, Redford’s original vision for Sundance was almost unrecognizable.\n\t\n\n\tTo further stoke the flame, as corporations look to automate the creative process through AI, some indie filmmakers found themselves inadvertently accelerating their own displacement by mourning the premeditated death of their craft.\n\n\t“Maybe stop saying how hard it is out there,” actor Peter Dinklage told Variety during the festival, calling on his fellow creatives to change their tone. “That just makes young filmmakers go, ‘Uh oh’ and not go with their guts. It’s all relative, but let’s not put up any walls.”\n\n\tThat sense of industry dread reflects a broader national anxiety, which reached a breaking point on Saturday, Jan. 24 (traditionally the buzziest day of the festival) following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by ICE agents in Minneapolis. How would Sundance respond?\n\n\tHollywood stars are often discouraged by the larger talent agencies and studios they partner with not to weigh in too directly on contested political issues (whether they listen or not is another thing). Plus, to address the elephant (or the donkey) in the room, not all Americans care to hear what “Hollywood elites” have to say about the atrocities of the world from the comfort of luxury. (During the festival, Bill Maher made headlines for saying celebrities need to “shut the f—k up” if they want the Democrats “to win elections”).\n\n\tBut at a turning point in American history, one where its people have grown sick of watching senseless violence carried out by those in power who took an oath to protect them, the film community — under the beam of Redford’s Sundance — appeared to take an unusually collective stance against tyranny.\n\n\tBy Saturday night, the political rhetoric became inescapable. Olivia Wilde and Natalie Portman turned heads for wearing “ICE Out” pins at the premieres of their films “I Want Your Sex” and “The Gallerist.” On the red carpet, Wilde took a bold stance during an interview with Variety, telling her fellow Americans to do everything they can to “cast ICE out and delegitimize this criminal organization.”\n\n\t“It feels like the lid has blown off,” said Tatiana Maslany, reflecting on the outpouring of celebrities speaking out. “I think a lot of people are realizing for the first time that they can’t remove themselves from the people who this affects — because it affects everyone.”\n\t\n\n\tFrom there, Variety heard from Giancarlo Esposito, who called for “a revolution” as the White House fuels a “feeling of civil war in the streets.” Will Poulter said it’s “really upsetting to see people forget we’re a country that we have immigrants to thank for.” Even the directors behind the very sweet “Little Miss Sunshine,” Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, took an opportunity during the film’s 20th anniversary to say they hope their film’s themes of “rejecting authority” will inspire audiences to “go out and be a little rebellious,” slyly referencing the protests that had broken out across the country. \n\n\tSundance attendees and filmmakers joined the protests held in Park City on Sunday and Monday, a visual manifestation of festivalgoers’ craving to practice free speech at a time where its protection under the First Amendment feels endangered.\n\n\t“I’ve never felt scared about what I was going to say — until the last couple of years,” Ethan Hawke said at “The Weight” premiere with a quiver in his voice. “There’s a fear in the air that I’ve never felt before. And it’s not America… Sometimes you need to have your freedoms taken away to know what they mean and what’s worth fighting for.”\n\n\tThe journalists covering the festival also found themselves affected. On Sunday, in the midst of sharing all these interviews on social media, Variety’s TikTok account was “shadowbanned” (an unofficial restriction in which the algorithm hides a user’s content for a period of time, often caused by a post that’s deemed as “restricted” content).\n\n\tA number of other users reported being shadowbanned on TikTok for posting content criticizing ICE. Some attributed the sudden censorship to the app’s new leadership: TikTok owner ByteDance had just closed a deal to form TikTok U.S., a joint venture majority-owned by American investors to satisfy the nation’s divest-or-ban mandate.\n\n\tIn an email sent to Variety, a representative from Bytedance attributed the shadowban to “a technical issue impacting the U.S. user experience, which may cause delays in publishing new posts and going live.”\n\n\tJust hours before news of the TikTok censorship went viral online, Border Control chief Greg Bovino connected the causation of Prezzi’s death to the anti-ICE rhetoric coming from journalists and Democrats.\n\t\n\n\t“When someone chooses to listen to a politician, a so-called journalist, or a community leader that spouts that type of vilification towards law enforcement or anything else… there are consequences and actions there also,” he said. “I think we saw that yesterday.”\n\n\tWhen Redford expressed disappointment with the world, he typically pointed his criticism toward the politicians tasked with creating change, not the American citizens who deserved to receive it.\n\n\tIn a 2018 blog post titled “A Brief Statement About Big Things,” Redford lamented that he felt “out of place in the country I was born into,” highlighting the stark divisiveness that had come to define American public life. He encouraged readers to “be better than our politicians,” to live in justice and respect, and to let others “fight it out now to the bitter ends.”\n\n\t“This is our country too. Every woman, man, and child in it — our American future,” he concluded. “We’ve got work to do.”\n\n\tRedford never promised that simply speaking up would change the world. Esposito recalls of his late friend, “Bob was subtler than that, he empowered people through his actions. He wasn’t interested in his ego to tell you how he felt about something because he knew better. He was interested in the process of independent film, how to nurture your voice. What does your voice tell you this should be? To me, that’s empowerment through action.”\n\n\tPerhaps under the beam of Redford’s Sundance, while promoting independent films that shine a light on underrepresented issues and expand our collective empathy, the idea of speaking out became a little less daunting.\n\n\t“Fascists go after artists because artists let you know that this world was built by people,” activist Jes Vesconte said during Park City’s anti-ICE protest on Monday. “It’s imaginary — and that means it can be imagined differently. We have the power to do things differently. And artists help us imagine that world. Journalists. Artists. Storytellers. Activists. All of us.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from the Season 2 finale of “The Night Manager,” now streaming on Prime Video. \n\n\tNearly a decade after it first premiered in 2016, “The Night Manager” has closed out its belated second season with a pair of tragic deaths and a bruising set-up for its final chapter.\n\n\tThe Prime Video spy thriller, based on the works of author John le Carré, brought back its troubled intelligence agent Jonathan Pine (Tom Hiddleston) for what was initially pitched as a new mission into the depths of Colombia and the treacherous world of young arms dealer Teddy De Santos (Diego Calva). But rather quickly, the series from creator/writer David Farr revealed it wasn’t as divorced from its first season as it wanted viewers to believe.\n\t\n\n\tBy Episode 3, Jonathan learns that his nemesis from Season 1, the vicious arms dealer Richard Roper (Hugh Laurie) hadn’t died at the hands of his enemies as he had believed — and hoped. Instead, Roper had faked his death by blackmailing Jonathan’s former handler Angela Burr (Olivia Colman), and disappeared into the jungles of Colombia for cover as he planned his next act. Helping his cause was the son he’d fathered as a young man but largely ignored until he needed something — Teddy, who was eager to help the father he always longed to know. But Jonathan’s infiltration of Teddy’s operation as a Hong Kong businessman managed to get him close enough to the hot-headed young kingpin to develop a relationship with him,  one that blurred the line of romance and danger. Ultimately, Teddy’s affection for Jonathan allowed him to see that he was just being used by his father as a means of resurrection. He is a vestige of Roper’s youth and would never be acknowledged as his legitimate son like Danny (Noah Jupe), his younger offspring  who is tolling away at a boarding school with a chip on his shoulder about his supposedly dead dad.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Des Willie/Amazon MGM Studios\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn the finale, allegiances have flipped. Jonathan’s former informant into Teddy’s operation, Roxana (Camila Morrone), has defected to Roper’s side, even going as far as to try and orchestrate Jonathan’s assassination. Teddy, meanwhile, has gone all in on his devotion to Jonathan, while still playing the dutiful son for Roper. In the hope of righting the wrong of helping Roper fake his death, Angela has also cornered Mayra (Indira Varma), the MI-6 chief who is in cahoots with Roper. But Jonathan, Teddy and Angela’s plan to divert Roper’s purchase of an electromagnetic pulse device meant to plunge South America into chaos is thwarted when Roper catches on to Teddy’s love for Jonathan. Their planned ambush is turned on them, and ultimately Roper puts a bullet in Teddy’s head for his defection.\n\n\tJonathan manages to get away, albeit beaten, bloody and devastated by the loss of his partner (in all senses of the word). What he doesn’t know is that Angela has also been gunned down in front of her young daughter, in Roper and Mayra’s latest attempt to tie up loose ends.\n\n\tIt took Farr years to crack the code of restarting Jonathan’s story, and Teddy was the key to doing it. It’s why there was never a doubt in his mind that the character had to die by season’s end in order to set up the final chapter of his trilogy of Jonathan and Roper’s battle.\n\n\t“Roper had to make the most brutal decision,” Farr tells Variety. “I felt he needed to win in some very dark way. But I didn’t just want it to be a plotty thing: It needed to have a very dark emotional cost, so it was always inevitable for me.”\n\n\tBelow, Farr breaks down the complicated relationship between Jonathan (whom he calls by his last name, Pine) and Teddy, why he is adamant it was a love story (to a degree), whether Angela was always on the chopping block and what Season 3 might look like –– when he is done writing it.\n\t\n\t\tLooking back on the second season now, what was the biggest challenge in resurrecting this story after a decade?\t\n\n\tThe reason we didn’t do it for ages was that I was very anxious about just suddenly plowing into something without a worthy reason to do so. I wanted to find a way to extend this story in a satisfying way that I felt justified it being a trilogy. As is often the way with writing, it helped that I finally had one very clear idea, which was the whole Teddy story. The notion that Roper, as a young man, could have been a gunrunner in Colombia felt right to me. He was cutting his teeth there and had a kid, and in his time of need after the Syrian situation, that’s where he would naturally go for cover and figure out a plan. Once I figured that out, it just happened. \n\t\n\n\tIt also reflects that fathers-and-sons dynamic. It opens up Teddy as an alternative son, and Pine as a surrogate son. So suddenly this whole thing, this very le Carré theme, just fell into place. As you can tell, I’m a fan, and it started to feel really truthful to that world rather than just trying to force a spinoff or an opportunistic second season.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Des Willie/Amazon MGM Studios\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe heart of this season is Jonathan and Teddy’s relationship. The promos for the season put their near kiss in Episode 2 front and center. But here at the end, how do you define that relationship? Was it romantic? Was it purely circumstantial for Jonathan?\t\n\n\tPine is a very strange and opaque figure even to himself, right? What was Jed to him in Season 1? Was he really in love with her? I’m not sure. He definitely was in the moment, but rather as an actor is when they play a role in a play. Then the play ends and the actor has to extricate themselves. Spies have that too. Spies enter worlds where they have to play real, but the problem is –– and this is one of le Carré’s great themes as well — you get lost in the maze of that. You don’t know who you are. You don’t know what real love is versus feigned love.\n\n\tWhen it comes to Teddy, it’s not that different. He is at one level using Teddy in his operation. But two things can happen at once. I think there is a genuine physical attraction, which is new for Pine, and I stand by it. I think it’s really truthful and important. I think the scene in the villa at the end of Episode 2 is the most erotic moment between them. Certainly, there are other ways in which Teddy and Pine could have explored each other, and decide to work together in that moment. But there is a very particular way of him diving in that pool, and holding onto his shirt as he’s looking down at him in his arms like he’s Mary looking at Jesus. It’s a very Catholic erotic moment. That physical attraction remains, but it shifts as soon as Roper arrives. As soon as he realizes this guy is alive, in a weird way, that erotic fascination –– I use that word very loosely –– shifts.  Suddenly, it becomes about saving a man he loves, and realizing that man is a victim. Teddy has done terrible things, as he says himself. But in some ways, he is also a victim, and once again, Pine is suckered into trying to save someone. But as he even says, he causes damage when he falls in love with people. I think he genuinely falls in love with Teddy, but in a slightly different way.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIn rewatching the finale, perhaps the most important moment is when Roxana defiantly confronts Roper and pleads that she is not in love with Jonathan, saying, “I didn’t lose my heart to him, and if someone did, it wasn’t me.” That is the moment Roper realizes his son Teddy is not aligned with him anymore, and he has fallen for what Jonathan offers him.\t\n\n\tThat is what literally cracks open everything. There’s a fun thing about that scene, which we can talk about now, because when we originally filmed it, it went farther. Roper acts out this realization about [Teddy’s allegiance]. That’s the moment when everything falls into place and he realizes he’s being played. Roxana’s key role in the season, weirdly, is that moment. Because it’s her cleareyedness that makes Roper understand, and thus he makes the changes to the weapons drop. In the end, we chose not to put that part of the scene in because it felt like it could give too much away to the audience too quickly. And even later, if we had used it as some kind of flashback, it felt a little unnecessary. But it is also worth saying that moment leads to Roper and Roxy gaining this very strange camaraderie, where they both see they are very similar people. He needs that moment of absolute understanding, and I like the fact that she gives it to him. She’s so far from being what she seems, which is this kind of James Bondian siren. Really, Roxana is the most coolly observant survivor of them all. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Des Willie/Amazon MGM Studios\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tShe ends up in a similar place to Jed in the Season 1 finale, where we see her seemingly making her escape. But with this new understanding between her and Roper, might Roxana come back into the fold in Season 3?\t\n\n\tWell, I’m not at liberty to talk about that. My instinct is that I’m satisfied with that resolution and Roxana’s journey. But the honest truth is that we are still writing the third season as we speak. Writing is a journey of discoveries. So I don’t really know yet. But I will say, even if she’s got away for good, she’s learned something about herself and it’s not necessarily a nice thing. There was an opportunity there to become a different person, and she didn’t take it.\n\t\n\t\tThere is no mistaking the tragedy of Roper killing his own son for Teddy’s betrayal. But did you really have to kill the poor guy? It feels like there could have been so much to play between that dynamic and with Jonathan! Did you ever consider letting him live?\t\n\n\tNo, because this was the journey that I first thought of, and I see it as a very kind of archetypal story of sons. Roper had to make the most brutal decision. I felt he needed to win in some very dark way. But I didn’t just want it to be a plotty thing. It needed to have a very dark emotional cost, so it was always inevitable for me. Obviously, a couple of other people asked me along the way, like, “Are you sure?” But you know, sometimes you just have to go with your initial hunch. And they all admitted the power is there in that moment. Of course, it also gives us a legacy in Season 3 for Roper and for Pine. Teddy’s death is intensely meaningful in very different ways for both of them. There’s something interesting as well for Danny, who has no idea that Teddy even exists. I will say, I’m excited to work with Noah Jupe because he’s a really special actor. We only used him lightly this season, but he’s very talented and he’s a lovely guy. So I want to write for him in Season 3, which is very exciting.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNot only does Danny not know he had a brother, but he doesn’t yet know that his father killed him either. It means Roper is certainly capable of killing another son.\t\n\n\tOn one level, any kid who hasn’t seen their father and thought he was dead will obviously be overjoyed. I think that final scene with them is played so beautifully. It’s quite understated, and terribly English. But it has the right impact.\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of impacts, you had the nerve to kill international treasure Olivia Colman at the end of this finale. Did you have to warn multiple nations that a day of mourning was imminent because you don’t just kill Olivia Colman! So why did Angela have to die, and what was Olivia’s reaction?\t\n\n\tI know, this is the biggest crime we committed. But what I will say is that unlike Teddy’s death, which was a complete inevitability and I don’t think the story works without it, Angela’s death was a choice. It was about making a bold choice. From a story point of view, I felt she had unbelievably strong stories in both seasons. In the first one, she is an operational handler, but she’s much more than that. She’s a good angel for Pine. That question of will he stay loyal to her or will he possibly get lured by the Roper seduction was just so beautiful. In the second season, she’s made this quite flawed decision, obviously, which she has to make good on once she realizes what she’s done. Her relationship with Pine is not as pure. It’s all messy and tough and they don’t even end on a good note, which is tragic now. But what I didn’t want to happen very simply was for her to become just a handler with nothing more to do. That’s the last thing I wanted, and Olivia’s very in demand. So it felt like without a really pressing imperative for her moving forward, it might be way more daring and more honest to do what we’ve done.\n\n\tAs for her reaction, it’s classic Olivia. She was like, “Oh, it’s a brilliant idea!” She got the daring of it and she found it thrilling and she loved doing the actual scene itself. But on the day of, and sadly I wasn’t there, she did express to our director Georgi [Banks-Davies] much more bittersweetness. When I finally had a coffee with her, she did say it’s been a massive part of her life. You’ve got to remember, she was genuinely pregnant when she made Season 1. So literally, her child is the same age as the show and it’s got a family quality. This was a really tough decision, not an easy one at all. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Des Willie/Amazon MGM Studios\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThis does leave a role in Jonathan’s life for an advisor and a support system, and Hayley Squire’s character, Sally, is poised to step up. \t\n\n\tOh, yes. I have a strong desire to write for Hayley Squires and Sally. She’s really exciting and beautiful, and there’s a kind of desire to honor Angela’s legacy in that way. Also, I shouldn’t say too much about this but there is a strong sense of Angela’s ghost –– not literally but in the sense of her legacy –– in Season 3. There is a plot reason, but I can’t yet tell you that!\n\t\n\t\tSeason 3 was announced with Season 2, so you will get to complete your trilogy. Jonathan got the win at the end of Season 1, and Roper gets a huge win here at the end of Season 2. Do you see Season 3 as a winner-takes-all showdown? \t\n\n\tOf course, we have to have some kind of resolution to all of this. But it may not happen in the way that everyone quite predicts. The journey there, hopefully, will be a little bit different to what might be the most obvious story.\n\t\n\t\tJonathan has been wounded physically, mentally and emotionally at the end of this season. Did Roper suffer any damage that will affect him going into Season 3?\t\n\n\tHe’s described as the worst man in the world and all these things. But I don’t think of Roper as some kind of strange robotic monster. You can’t do what he’s done without it having a serious impact. He just doesn’t yet know what that impact is yet, and that’s what is exciting to me as I’m writing.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "description": "\n\tThe nine Oscar nominations for Norwegian Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” and two Palme d’Or awards won by Swede Ruben Östlund are signs of a far",
    "body": "\n\tThe nine Oscar nominations for Norwegian Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” and two Palme d’Or awards won by Swede Ruben Östlund are signs of a far larger Scandinavian creative scene. \n\n\tThat could be one takeaway from Sweden’s Göteborg Film Festival, Scandinavia’s biggest film-TV event, which wrapped Saturday after five days of vibrant discussion and dealing at its international marketplaces, the Nordic Film Market and TV Drama Vision. \n\t\n\n\tHighlights took in not only project and production presentations, conference panels and masterclasses and a strong newsflow led by not only Europe’s superindies Banijay and Fremantle but also broadcaster networks New8 and Scandi Alliance and Charades and Dramanation, to name just a few.\n\n\n\tThe two markets underscored the energy still coursing through the region’s film and TV industry, as well as its enviable talent pool. Equally, industry discussions at Göteborg did not skirt the large challenges facing the Nordics, often shared by the global industry at large at a time of wrenching industry disruption.\n\n\tGöteborg Market Attendance Soars\n\n\tIn 2026, the Göteborg Film Festival welcomed 2,600 accredited industry and press participants, 1,370, hailing from 47 countries, attending the Nordic Film Market and TV Drama Vision, Göteborg Film Festival head of industry Josef Kullengård tells Variety. That’s 50% up on 2023. Just how that split is one clue why so many producers – 500 this year – come to Göteborg. Of industry delegates, 142 were buyers and distributors and 50 sales agents. But Göteborg also welcomed 109 broadcast and streaming service execs and 134 representatives from funds and film institutes. Göteborg is a goldmine of potential financing source, stream and downstream, even in an industry downturn.\n\t\n\n\tThe Bad News\n\n\tAn opening section of a TV Drama Vision keynote by Ampere Analysis’ Guy Bisson underlined just how far industry disruption has come. Entitled 28 Months Later, Content Trends 2.5 Years After Peak TV, Bisson insisted that “We are still at 75% peak TV,” with, globally, average first-run TV commissions over 2024-25 still down 25% on the peak. Scandinavia is no exception: Nordic scripted series orders plunged from 129 in 2022 to 57 in 2025. That can be put down in part to Viaplay’s implosion. Yet Nordic public broadcasters commissioned 41 scripted in the second half of 2024, just 14 in 2H 2025, Bisson tells Variety. “So many people are leaving their jobs as filmmakers,” Norway’s Tonje Søimer Guttormsen, who directs the Oscar-nominated Renate Reinsve in Göteborg Festival standout “Butterfly,” told Variety.\n\n\tBut a Bullish Göteborg Market Mood\n\n\tThat said, Göteborg’s market mood was still bullish, says Kullengård. “There was a real sense that things were boiling this year. With more people in Göteborg than ever before, the energy across the market was high – packed sessions, intense conversations and a strong feeling within the community that even though the market is struggling, there is hope and a shared sense of moving forward,” he adds.\n\n\tGöteborg’s Talent Parade\n\n\tA mood of hope can be attributed in part to Goteborg’s talent parade. It’s not every festival that fields in its project and pix in post a sizeable part of a regions good and great,” Kullengård tells Variety. “What truly stood out was the strength and range of Nordic talent right now – from established filmmakers presenting their third major projects, such as Milad Alami, Frida Kempff and Amanda Kernell, to senior voices like Erik Poppe, Dag Johan Haugerud and of course Ruben Östlund, alongside an exciting wave of new creators with both series and films.”\n\n\tBig Premium Plays \n\n\tNetflix took off with big bold series: Think “Money Heist” and “Dark.” Nearly 10 years later, in a far more play safe industry, premium plays are at a premium. But that doesn’t mean they’ve disappeared. In one Göteborg highlight, the Scandi Alliance –TV2 Norway, TV4 Sweden and TV 2 Denmark – announced it had greenlit “Royal Blood” a historical epic set over 1807-14. In another, Dramanation’s Patrick Nebout and Henrik Jansson-Schweizer, creators of the multi-prized “Whiskey on the Rocks,” unveiled two new and decidedly premium TV series projects:  Nordic Noir actioner “Becker & Kempe” and Cold War heist dramedy “Made in Sweden.” “The niche and the market for premium and compelling scripted entertainment has definitely not vanished,” Nebout told Variety.\n\t\n\n\tBuzz Titles\n\n\tStarring Gustaf Skarsgård (“Oppenheimer”) and Fares Fares (“Chernobyl”), “Once In the Archipelago,” by Swedish director Alex Schulman, was among the biggest buzz works in progress, as was self-discovery tale “Low Expectations.” Toplining Marie Ulven, better known as singer-composer Girl in Red, it is from another first-time helmer, Norway’s Eivind Landsvik whose “Tits” was selected for Cannes’ 2023 main competition. Over at TV Drama Vision, microdrama “In My Hands” impressed with its pitch, while “A Phone Rings in the Middle of the Night,” a project bound for the Berlinale Co-Pro Series, drew a large industry audience – as was to be expected from the first series produced by Ruben Ostlund’s Plattform Produktion.\n\n\tFestival Standouts: A New Renate Reinsve Movie and More\n\n\tAt the festival, apart from Maria Sødahl’s winner “The Last Resort,” Renate Reinsve starrer “Butterfly” was a hot ticket – especially following multiple Oscar nominations for “Sentimental Value.” It sees Reinsve in a new light (and some wild makeup) as a woman trying to make peace with her sister and their late mother. In the international section, “How to Divorce During the War” about a relationship crumbling alongside the war on Ukraine was garnering attention, even before its award at Sundance. That being said, none of the films generated the kind of buzz that Ruben Östlund did during his presentation about the upcoming “The Entertainment System Is Down.”\n\n\tThat Man Rüben Östlund \n\n\tBy gleefully spoiling crucial plotlines – and even the ending – Östlund has proven once again that he’s a showman as well as an award-winning filmmaker. “When I watch a movie or hear about a great idea, I don’t care how it ends. All I want to know is: How will it be made?,” he told Variety. During the closing ceremony of the Nordic Film Market, industry insiders could be heard whispering in every corner, trying to do just that. “Cinema must establish a relationship with the audience much more quickly nowadays. Anything that piques their curiosity is something you can use,” he added. Judging by the explosive reactions to his yet-unseen film, more Nordic colleagues should take notice.\n\t\n\n\tWhere It’s At: Genre\n\n\tAsk a sales agent what sells these days and the answer, more often than not, will be genre. That of course can take in a broad spectrum, but it was noticeable how many buzz titles at the Nordic Film Market fit into that range. One of the NFM’s hottest titles, boarded by Charades, was family psychological thriller “Bloodsuckers,” ‘Midsommar’ producer Patrik Andersson. Of projects in the NFM’s Discovery strand, body horror title “Swine” from “The Swedish Torpedo” director Frida Kempff, Icelandic mystical adventure film The Silver of Egill by Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurðsson, were fully booked up with meetings after pitches,, as was German sci-fi project “Element,” presented at the NFM’s Nordic Gateway.\n\n\tRikke Gregersen: A Name to Conjure\n\n\tA Student Academy Award winner for “Dog Eat Dog” and Sundance-selected for her second short, “The Affected,” Norway’s Rikke Gergersen is bearing out on her promise. Her feature debut, “Almost There,” another Charades pick-up exploring the “complex and often contradictory transition” from young to full adulthood, as Gregersen puts it, was one of the major talking points at the Nordic Film Market, as was her project “Tiger.” Gregersen is set apart by her sharp humor as she develops totally relatable but discomfiting scenarios. “Almost There” and “Tiger” look to be no exceptions.         \n\n\tCreator Content Is Not Cat Videos\n\n\tAnd industry macro trends? At Góteborg, media analyst Johanna Koljonen responsible for its yearly Nostradamus report, said there is a “core misunderstanding” in the industry about creator media. It goes way beyond the generalized — and outdated — understanding, she argued, that it refers to cat videos. Koljonen distinguished between the two types of people working in the industry: those working in a context “where production is so expensive that it requires significant investment” and “people who can produce it cheaply or can fund it themselves.” The divide is “important,” especially given a near future where the technical side of production will most probably get cheaper. “If you have the freedom of being on this side, don’t discard that,” she emphasized. “When we talk about cat videos, we become blind to the opportunities on this side. That’s very dangerous.”\n\t\n\n\tMicrodramas: Time to Jump In\n\n\tDuring the Film Forum Sweden conference, vertical creator and showrunner Thom Woodley, emphasized how microdramas are “episodic television, compressed and re-engineered.” “We are going to see traditional platforms like Disney and Netflix experimenting [with the format],” added the veteran.\n\n\tWoodley pointed out how professionals from traditional media often look at microdrama as a “downgrade.” The director recalled the early days of television, when, much like with microdrama now, lack of experience reflected the quality of content. “But look at where television is right now. That is going to happen with vertical narrative, too, and it’s going to happen a hell of a lot faster than it happened with TV.  If you’re a creator, you can wait to see how it develops. Or you can jump in now.” \n\n\tIP: We Don’t Know Sh*t \n\n\tSpeaking about IP, Koljonen brought up “Warhammer 40,000,” the world’s most popular miniature wargame, from Games Workshop. “It has a huge, insane audience. In your city, there is probably a store called Games Workshop or a branded Warhammer store. There are 570 of these in the world. In addition, their products are sold in over 7,000 independent retailers.” One famed Warhammer fan is “The Witcher” star Henry Cavill, whose passion led him to executive produce an upcoming Prime Video adaptation. “We need to know that we don’t know shit about what normal people are into,” said Koljonen while still reflecting on the Warhammer mania “Reading the culture pages will not teach you that ASMR is going to happen.”\n\n\tAnd Göteborg’s 2026 Deals:\n\n\t*New8, the production and broadcast collaboration between eight major European public broadcasters – SVT (Sweden), DR (Denmark), YLE (Finland), RÚV (Iceland),  NRK (Norway), VRT (Flanders/Belgium), NPO (The Netherlands) and ZDF (Germany) – has been renewed for another three years, it announced at Göteborg’s TV Drama Vision. Series produced thanks to the alliance include “Other People’s Money” and Finnish Smash “The Queen of Fucking Everything,” up for a Nordic Scripted Series Award at Göteborg.  \n\n\t*Renowned for bringing new voices to the world, such as Gints Zilbalodis with Oscar winner “Flow,” Paris-based sales-production Charades announced two new world sales pickups at Göteborg: Rikke Gregersen’s “Almost There” and “Bloodsuckers,” a family thriller marking the sophomore feature of Elin Grönblom (“Ella and Friends”). \n\t\n\n\t*Fremantle’s Miso Film gets the greenlight from the Scandi Alliance for “Royal Blood,” in the Alliance first banner order. To be directed by “The Crown” helmer Erik Richter Strand , it recounting how royal families and power players in Denmark-Norway and Sweden used money, sex, deceit and even murder to forge modern Scandinavia. \n\n\t*Out in force at Göteborg, Banijay Entertainment unveiled further key cast for its ‘Wallander’ Reboot, Starring Gustaf Skarsgård, with Sophia Martinsson (‘Festen’) playing Wallander’s daughter, Ana Gil De Melo Nascimento (‘Sune’) his wife and Göran Ragnerstam (‘Arn’) his father. The anticipated and highly modern reimagining is set up at Jarowskij/Yellow Bird. \n\n\t *Embodying what co-head Patrick Nebout called a mission to create calls “splashy, high-profile TV-series and films with international resonance,” Stockholm-based Dramanation unveiled two new titles: “Becker & Kempe,” a Nordic Noir crime and cop-actioner and “Made in Sweden,” as a Cold War political thriller/dramedy in the vein of dramanation smash “Whiskey on the Rocks.\n\n\t* Launching two major projects in the Nordics this January — “Snake Killer” and “VAKA,” Prime Video revealed via Variety an exclusive first look at “Murder in the Dark,” an adaptation of Dan Turèll’s highly lauded gritty Danish noir novel that is coming out later this year, as Prime Video’s first-phase Nordic originals are beginning to see the light of day.     \n\n\t*Banijay also announced that drag queen ‘amateur’ crime caper ‘Queen Heist’ and ‘liberating’ romcom ‘The Good Widow’ have been added to Banijay Finland slate, ‘Queen Heist’ growing creatively at the Banijay Bootcamp, led by Steve Matthews, Banijay head of scripted, creative. \n\n\t*Meanwhile, Jarowskij/Yellow Bird, a Banijay company, is set to produce a new Netflix action-comedy, “Permafrost,” directed by Patrik Eklund (“The Conference”) from a screenplay by Peter Arrhenius (“Clark”) and starring top Swedish comedian  Björn Gustafsson (“Parlamentet,” “Stockholm Live”).

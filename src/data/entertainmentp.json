    "body": "\n\tThe filmmakers behind Yash‘s highly anticipated “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” have revealed the first look at Huma Qureshi as Elizabeth, unveiling a character that blends old-world glamour with unsettling gothic menace.\n\n\tThe newly released image captures Qureshi against a cemetery backdrop, her character positioned next to a classic black automobile. Her costume features a dramatic black gown with exposed shoulders and striking sleeve design, presenting a character whose refined appearance masks darker undertones. The funereal location and subdued color palette hint at a figure whose influence derives from composure and sophistication rather than explicit aggression.\n\t\n\n\tQureshi has built a formidable reputation across film and streaming platforms through acclaimed performances in Anurag Kashyap’s crime drama “Gangs of Wasseypur,” the black comedy “Dedh Ishqiya,” and revenge thriller “Badlapur.” Her work in streaming series includes the dystopian Netflix drama “Leila” and the SonyLIV political thriller “Maharani,” for which she received a Filmfare OTT Award. She was most recently in Season 3 of Netflix series “Delhi Crime” and the lead in Bikas Ranjan Mishra’s film “Bayaan,” which bowed at the Toronto Film Festival. \n\n\n\tYash, the Kannada-language film industry actor who rose to pan-Indian stardom with the “K.G.F” franchise, has become one of the most sought-after stars in Indian cinema. Known for his portrayal of Rocky Bhai in “K.G.F: Chapter 1” (2018) and “K.G.F: Chapter 2” (2022) Yash’s transformation into a larger-than-life action hero propelled the films to unprecedented box-office success, breaking language barriers. The second instalment in the franchise is the fifth highest Indian grosser of all time. While the “K.G.F” series cemented his star power, Yash’s early career in Kannada-language films showcased his versatility, with notable performances in projects such as “Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari” (2014) and “Googly” (2013).\n\t\n\n\t“Toxic” is helmed by festival circuit darling Geetu Mohandas (“Moothon”). The ambitious project represents a watershed moment for Kannada cinema, which has been steadily gaining international traction following the “K.G.F” phenomenon. Written by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic” is breaking new ground as the first major Indian film conceptualized, written and shot simultaneously in both the Kannada and English languages – with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\n\t“Casting for this role was perhaps the trickiest,” said director Geetu Mohandas. “The character demanded a performer with high octane caliber and an undeniable presence. From the moment Huma entered my frame, I witnessed that she possessed something rare. She carried an effortless sophistication and intensity that immediately brought the character of Elizabeth alive for me. Huma is an actor who questions, probes, and challenges the artistic interpretation of a role and that dialogue became an essential part of our creative journey. She has always been known as a powerhouse of talent, but this performance will mark as a turning point for the arrival of an undeniable, commanding new presence on celluloid.”\n\n\tThe first look at Kiara Advani‘s character Nadia was unveiled recently. \n\n\tThe production has assembled a notable technical crew including Indian National Film Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer T.P. Abid. Action sequences have been choreographed by Hollywood’s J.J. Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside Indian National Film Award-winning duo Anbariv and Kecha Khamphakdee.\n\n\tProduced by Venkat K. Narayana and Yash through KVN Productions and Monster Mind Creations, “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” is scheduled for theatrical release March 19, 2026, capitalizing on the extended holiday weekend that encompasses Eid, Ugadi and Gudi Padwa celebrations.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\tDec 27, 2025 9:00am PT\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\tIn ‘Marty Supreme,’ New York City’s Most Iconic Mobsters Inspired Timothée Chalamet’s Retro-Chic Suiting\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tA short film from the experimental filmmaker Ken Jacobs, documenting the predominantly Jewish immigrant life in Manhattan’s Lower East Side in 1955, served as a main reference point for Josh Safdie and costume designer Miyako Bellizzi when building out the bustling downtown world in “Marty “Supreme.”\n\n\t“Obviously I was looking at the young cool kids,” Bellizzi tells Variety about the short film, which she says Safdie showed her after stumbling across it at the Museum of Modern Art. \n\n\n\tIn the colorized vignette, boys wear pleated trousers, white tanks, slim ties, sleeveless knit vests. Girls wear culottes and vintage tees. “They almost look contemporary to us,” Bellizzi says, noting that downtown New York was the epicenter of style, even then. Women weren’t wearing pants in the 1950s but “the girls in the Lower East Side were.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGC Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAtsushi Nishijima\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAtsushi Nishijima\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe grotty tenements of the Lower East Side — and the distinct fashion within — is as much of a character in A24’s drama as the eponymous ping pong player himself. In the film, Timothée Chalamet plays the mousy, arrogant and delusionally ambitious Marty Mauser as he hustles for the chance to prove his greatness at a sport that nobody takes seriously.  \n\n\tAuthenticity and historical accuracy is of utmost importance to both Bellizzi and Safdie, who previously worked with each other on “Uncut Gems” and “Good Time.” For production design, this meant using the exact right font on a Delancey storefront. For the costumes, it meant no contemporary brands — anywhere.\n\n\n\t“Even down to the underwear!” Bellizzi quips. The women’s tights in the film, for example, were sourced from Williamsburg’s Hasidic Jewish Center.\n\n\tBut once those markers for historical accuracy were set, it was really about inhabiting the mind of Marty Mauser. “What was he looking at? What were his references? Who did he look up to? Who were the types of people that he saw on a regular basis?” These were the questions that were top of mind for Bellizzi when constructing his wardrobe, she says.  \n\n\tThe hustler subculture was specifically compelling for Bellizzi, who looked to 20th century Wise Guy gangsters to evoke Marty’s gritty swagger. This reference ultimately informed his boxier, oversized suits; tailored two-piece sets with strong, padded shoulders, in dark colors such as deep charcoal and navy blue, became his uniform for much of the film. “It’s kind of like dressing for the job you want,” she says. “It’s not even ‘Fake it till you make it,’ it’s just him wanting to show he’s in the know.”\n\n\tOf course, the real-life table-tennis sensation Marty Reisman, who Chalamet’s Marty is loosely based on, was also on her mood board. “The real Marty was eccentric, so I wanted to give him a little bit of flair and style without being overly stylized,” she says. “He’s pretty classic – it’s more in the shapes and in small details.” One standout fashion moment includes a pair of red leather gloves he wears while shoveling a hot dog down his throat in the middle of a traffic-riddled street.  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGC Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOf course, it would be remiss to write about the costume design in “Marty Supreme” without mentioning Kay Stone (Gwyneth Paltrow), the retired movie star that Marty is intent on seducing. Kay’s refined style – made up of ivory wool coats, pillbox hats and delicate face veils – is Marty’s aspirational opposite. While we mostly see her in neutral colors, her most striking ensemble is a red, satin evening coat she wears to the opening of her play — and later, to a secret rendezvous with Marty.\n\n\n\t“That was her ending when she felt the most alive again, and that’s why we chose red,” Bellizzi says. “This dress is her moment. She’s so excited – this is the party for her big new theatrical show and then we find out it doesn’t do well, it doesn’t get great reviews.” \n\n\t“This emotional, alive feeling gets destroyed,” she continues. For Bellizzi, this moment comes close to encapsulating the entire point of the film: “Sometimes you have big dreams for yourself, and then sometimes they don’t go the way you want them to.” \n\n\t",

    "description": "\n\tIndian actor Sheena Chohan, who made her Hindi-language feature film debut in the biopic “Sant Tukaram” earlier this year, has been cast as the lead",
    "body": "\n\tIndian actor Sheena Chohan, who made her Hindi-language feature film debut in the biopic “Sant Tukaram” earlier this year, has been cast as the lead in “Arjunanin Allirani,” a Tamil-language drama centered on folk artists and caste discrimination.\n\n\tThe film, written by acclaimed Tamil author B. Jeyamohan and directed by Vino Vikraman Pillai (“Kafir”), will feature music by legendary composer Ilaiyaraaja. The project marks Chohan’s entry into Tamil cinema after acting across Malayalam, Hindi and international productions.\n\t\n\n\t“Arjunanin Allirani” follows two impoverished artists — a folk dance performer and a Dalit singer — whose relationship forms the heart of the narrative. The story traces the female lead’s journey through family tragedy and her eventual pursuit of justice through her art.\n\n\n\tIn the film, produced by Irfan Khan for EBG Films, Chohan will portray Rani, a character whose arc spans from her teenage years to middle age across four distinct life phases. The role requires extensive martial arts training, including Chilambattam, a traditional Tamil stick-fighting technique.\n\n\t“Rani is a young woman who spends her formative years immersed in devotion, singing hymns to God in temples,” Pillai tells Variety. “Beginning with the vibrancy and innocence of her twenties, her life unfolds across four distinct phases, tracing her journey from youth to middle age. To authentically portray this evolution, the actress taking on the role must master martial arts, including Chilambattam. As the narrative moves through different eras, the character undergoes significant physical and emotional transformations, requiring the actress to adapt her appearance and presence accordingly.”\n\t\n\n\tThe director says that casting Chohan was “entirely serendipitous.” “From our very first conversation, I was struck by her deep passion and dedication to her craft,” he says. “When I shared the story of Allirani, she showed a genuine and immediate interest. The character of Rani is a powerful and resilient woman, whose journey spans from her teenage years to middle age. The role also demands extensive martial arts sequences, a challenge Sheena is exceptionally well suited for, given her many years of training and experience in martial arts.”\n\n\tFor Chohan, the role aligns with her longstanding commitment to socially grounded material. “I did so much theatre and acting training, that it’s a waste to do a flat character,” she tells Variety. “Also, if you have your acting skills sharpened, you can, and should, give what appears to be a one-note character more depth – of course the most important thing is to be a blank page for your director and give them what they want for the story, but no real people are shallow and morally simple, so I don’t like any of my characters to be.”\n\n\tChohan, who serves as United for Human Rights South Asia Ambassador, adds that her human rights advocacy has directly influenced her project choices. “I turn down so many films because of derogatory or degrading roles,” she says. “But the good news is that the industry is changing – with all of the good work of women like the Women’s Collective in Kerala, and women and men across the country and world pushing against discrimination – new characters and stories are being written which show women as equal citizens – real-life, breathing, thinking humans, not just pretty Christmas tree decorations.”\n\n\tChohan’s recent work includes Aditya Om’s “Sant Tukaram,” in which she portrayed Avali Jijabai opposite the title character in the Hindi biopic. The film was widely described as showcasing her quiet power and emotional depth. She describes her performance approach as rooted in thorough character research and technique developed during intensive training at The Acting Center in Los Angeles while working on the Hollywood film “Nomad.”\n\n\t“What I learned was how to develop a character in terms of understanding their inner thoughts and motivations overall and in each scene,” she says. “So, while I read and watched everything connected to Avali Jijabai, including having the original 17th century historical texts read to me and working and eating with the village women who still work the fields Avali worked in, I then used all of that gathered information to truly understand and fit into her character, so that my reactions were natural.”\n\t\n\n\tReflecting on her Hindi debut, Chohan notes the significance of seeing the film play across theaters in Mumbai, where she is based. “After doing five years of theater, training in my craft, martial arts and dance in Kolkata, I shifted to Mumbai keeping it as a base but working pan India in different languages with legendary directors nationally and internationally,” she says. “But living in Mumbai, it was deeply special to see ‘Sant Tukaram’ playing across theatres here and release nationwide. Having friends and colleagues join me at the Mumbai – national premiere did feel like an arrival. But creatively, it was never a reset – it was a continuation.”\n\n\tThe actor has also completed J.D. Chakravarthy’s pan-India thriller “Jatasya Maranam Dhruvam,” in which she plays a police officer. “I literally followed a policewoman around into her dangerous job, in her home life – I did so much to get into the head-space of that character, and that too in such a dark, complex thriller, that I can only feel what I brought to the character gave the director an insight that he was desperate for,” she says.\n\n\tHer upcoming slate includes the VFX-heavy streaming series “Bhaayava,” in which she portrays Lilith. The platform has not yet been locked as the production team completes extensive visual effects work. “I went from playing the wife of a saint, to a devil, and perhaps that’s what made me take the role – it was so different – I went from the most simple scenes in fields where we’ve worked in saris for a thousand years, to being flung out of a car in a harness for a flying scene after five hours of prosthetics in front of one of the biggest green screens in Mumbai,” she says. “However, again, the character was so rich – Lilith was Adam’s first wife in the bible – she was banished from Eden for refusing to be dominated by and obey every word from Adam – so that was a character I had to sink my teeth into.”\n\n\tChohan’s international credits include “Ant Story” (2013) directed by Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, which played at the Shanghai and Dubai International Film Festivals. She has also appeared alongside Madhuri Dixit in Netflix series “The Fame Game” (2022) and Kajol in JioHotstar show “The Trial” (2023). \n\n\tHer career began with a debut opposite Mammootty in the Malayalam-language film “The Train” (2011), directed by Jayaraj. Reflecting on her work with renowned actors including Mammootty, Dixit and Kajol, Chohan notes how different directors have shaped her approach. “Acting in India has changed a lot since I was launched by Mammootty – what my director Jayaraj wanted in terms of restraint on the set of ‘The Train’ was quite opposite to what Suparn Varma wanted on the set of ‘The Trial,'” she says. “For Jayaraj I was much more expressive but for Suparn I had to keep it subtle and do so much character research to get into her mind and be my character, without ‘acting.’ What I learned from these legends in terms of command and screen presence in many ways tie in with professionalism – they are really there, doing what they’re doing while they’re doing it.”\n\t\n\n\tOn balancing wider reach through big platforms versus roles that leave a lasting cultural impact, Chohan says, “What I care most about is character and story, so that’s what matters most, but of course, a rich, nuanced character in a well-told, original, larger-than-life, rooted story, that reaches the whole world – that’s the dream – and I want to live the dream.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJamie Lee Curtis is thankful her movie star mom made her wait to start acting in horror movies.\n\n\tDuring a recent appearance on “The Drew Barrymore Show” (via People), Curtis said that a producer wanted her to audition for “The Exorcist.” However, her mother, Janet Leigh, shut down the opportunity, protecting her then 12-year-old daughter from early fame and any potential trauma that came with starring in one of the scariest movies ever made.\n\t\n\n\t“He called my mom and said, ‘Hey, I’m producing the movie of the book “The Exorcist.” Will you let Jamie audition for it?’” Curtis recalled. “And at the time I was probably 12 and, like, cute and kind of sassy and I had some personality and I’m sure he saw me at a party and was like, ‘Oh, she’d be funny.’ And my mother said, ‘No.'”\n\n\n\tShe then told host Barrymore, “My mom really wanted me to have, thank God, a childhood, which I understand you didn’t get. You didn’t get that option.” Barrymore’s first role was in “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.” She was just seven years old playing Elliot’s younger sister. \n\n\tLinda Blair would ultimately be cast as the possessed child, Regan. She was nominated at the 1974 Acadmey Awards for best supporting actor for the role.\n\n\tCurtis would eventually become synonymous with the horror genre, first breaking out in the 1978 classic “Halloween” at age 19. In the coming years, Curtis starred in films like “The Fog,” “Prom Night,” and “Terror Train.” She most recently reprised her 1978 “Halloween” role, Laurie, for 2022’s “Halloween Ends.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt took some time for Eddie Murphy to forgive David Spade for his infamous “Saturday Night Live” dig.\n\n\tDuring a recent episode of his “Fly on the Wall” podcast, Spade said it took him “25 years” to win back fellow “SNL” alum Murphy after taking a shot at his film “Vampire in Brooklyn” during a “Weekend Update” segment.\n\n\t“It was weird going from being a super fan to having him hate me overnight, and to try to win him back for the last 25 years,” Spade said.\n\t\n\n\t“We had some bumps in the road along the way, early on,” he added. “I was on ‘Weekend Update,’ on ‘SNL,’ new to the show, making fun of all the celebrities and I made fun of him and it didn’t go well. And he called me and we had it out.”\n\n\tSpade explained that during the confrontation, he “didn’t really fight back” since he felt “guilty” about talking badly on air about his “hero.”\n\n\tDuring the segment in question, Spade was making fun of several celebrities, Murphy included. In light of the poor box office performance of Wes Craven’s “Vampire in Brooklyn,” Spade said of Murphy, “Look, children, it’s a falling star. Make a wish! You make a Hollywood minute omelet, you break some eggs.”\n\n\tIn his recent Netflix documentary “Being Eddie,” Murphy explained that he refused to go on “SNL” for years after the joke aired.\n\n\t“The joke had went through all of those channels that the joke has to go through, and then he was on the air saying, ‘Catch a falling star,’” Murphy said. “So I wasn’t like, ‘Fuck David Spade.’ I was like, ‘Oh, fuck “SNL.” Fuck y’all. How y’all going to do this shit? That’s what y’all think of me? Oh, you dirty motherfuckers.’ I was like that. And that’s why I didn’t go back for years.”\n\t\n\n\tSpade added that he and Murphy reunited at last year’s “SNL50” celebration, and that all transgressions had been forgiven.\n\n\t“I’ve seen him once or twice. And then I saw him at the 50th and we talked a little bit and everything’s fine,” Spade said. “And then they asked him about it and he said, ‘Yeah, we’re all good.’ So yeah, we’re all good.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 5, Volume 2 of “Stranger Things, now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tJamie Campbell Bower is used to playing the big bad — whether his name is Vecna, One or Henry. But in Volume 2 of “Stranger Things,” he takes the character a step further into possibly his creepiest yet, a cult-leader-like performance as Mr. WhatsIt.\n\n\t“Jim Jones was an early reference for me,” Bower says, citing the leader of the cult the Peoples Temple, who in November 1978 led more than 900 of his followers to commit mass suicide in Jonestown, Guyana.  “He was on the mood board, even with regard to certain things that he’s saying when the kids are all in front of him. There were points where I thought, ‘Do I say the word “you” or do I use the word “we”? We’re a family now.’ That’s really grim! It totally can remove the idea of autonomy, so definitely there had to be that level of cult leader-esqueness about him.”\n\t\n\n\tAlthough Mr. WhatsIt doesn’t look as villainous as Vecna, it was just as “terrifying” to take on the different character, says Bower: “There was so much fear in playing that.”\n\n\tHis approach for Season 5 overall was very different than Season 4, when he was crafting Henry’s memories.\n\n\t“What you saw in Season 4 happened, and it was real. This is very much like, how nice can I be to these poor children to make them feel as comfortable as possible in this world? And how much of my experience am I burying within that? And it’s always a really terrifying prospect when you’re sat opposite another actor, and your intentions are so deeply buried,” he says. “There’s a level of real dishonesty in that, and that’s really scary. It’s really hard, particularly opposite a child.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen Bower first took on the role, he told Variety about the humanity he focused on while playing Vecna. Now, that’s a bit tougher to access, as the character gets worse and worse and kills more and more people — but, Bower says, it’s still there.\n\n\t“There’s definitely a humanity that I can see,” he says now. “How much of that is portrayed in this volume is open for discussion and interpretation — there’s definitely trauma and experience that is present but unexplored at this point.”\n\n\tHaving seen the show’s prequel play “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” ahead of Season 5, Bower knew that something that happens to Henry at age 8 in a cave had been a “monumental experience” that was “life-altering” — he was never the same after that. Then, he begged the Duffer brothers for more information about Henry’s backstory.\n\n\t“It was something that I really felt like I had to pry out of Matt and Ross Duffer. They weren’t wildly forthcoming with that, because obviously, they wanted to protect it, but it was important for me to know what that was and why that was the case,” he says. “So, it was just a question of taking with me what I’d learned from the play, and then also just being irritating and asking questions.”\n\n\tIn Episode 6, as Max (Sadie Sink) and Holly (Nell Fisher) make their way through Henry’s memories, looking for a way out of his mindscape, they come upon what may be the answer to what happened to him. In a mine shaft, young Henry comes upon an injured man holding a silver suitcase, who shoots Henry in his hand in a panic. Holly and Max watch as Henry beats the man to death in self-defense, and start to open the case — but then Max calls Holly away. When asked what’s inside that silver suitcase, Bower has a one-word tease: “reason.”\n\n\tAs for what he can say about the series finale, which drops on Netflix on Dec. 31? Expect the unexpected. The last scene in Episode 7, “The Bridge,” is Henry and the 12 children he’s kidnapped — most of whom worship him, as with a cult leader — joining hands at the Creel dinner table. He needs them to complete Vecna’s quest to remake the world, presumably replacing the Rightside Up with the Abyss.\n\n\t“The end of 7 is an incredible setup for what is to come. And if you think you know what is to come at the beginning of 8, you’re probably wrong,” Bower says. “It really does blow the fuck up. Whatever you think you know will be exceeded.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 2 Spoilers• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 1 Spoilers• Our 13 Burning Questions Ahead of the Series Finale• Noah Schnapp on That Scene in Volume 2• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1• Why Will’s Coming Out is Seismic• Director Shawn Levy on Will’s Huge Breakthrough• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 5, Volume 2 of “Stranger Things, now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tThe biggest show of the streaming era is turning out to be, in large part, about one young man’s coming out process.\n\n\tIn the final episode of Volume 2, released on Christmas Day, Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) realizes he needs to talk to his friends about something. They’re, together, fighting Vecna, the malign force that wants to destroy the entire world, but that has been bedeviling Will in particular since the show’s first episode. Back when he was first kidnapped and taken to the Upside Down, Will had been a slight and awkward boy who found himself picked on and scrutinized. Older and somewhat more secure now, Will realizes that Vecna, the evil being, is manipulating his insecurities. He’s trying to prise him away from his friends by showing him a vision of himself as abandoned by his friends and totally alone; in order to make sure that’s just a dark fantasy, Will needs to unburden himself.\n\t\n\n\tIn one of the episode’s final scenes, Will’s words come in a torrent, painfully earnest and meandering until he finally arrives at his point. “The truth is,” he says, “I am different. I just pretended like I wasn’t because I didn’t want to be.” Anyone who’s ever had to give a speech whose substance is like that of Will’s will recognize the halting, awkward cadence here, as well as the manner in which he announces his sexuality: “I don’t like girls.” He can’t quite bring himself to say what he does like, but this, for now, is enough.\n\t\n\n\tThis, a pivotal character opening up about being queer on a show as massive as “Stranger Things,” feels seismic — and, oddly, like the culmination of a very long journey. In the show’s earliest episodes, Will’s mom Joyce (Winona Ryder) says that her son has been cruelly mocked by his own father for being “queer”; back then, Schnapp, the actor playing Will, was a young child. (He’s 21, and an out gay man today.) Throughout the series, Will’s slight isolation from the rest of his peer group has been a note the show’s creators, Matt and Ross Duffer, have struck from time to time. He was singled out as uniquely vulnerable by Vecna, who needed an easily culled outsider to use as a vessel; this connection between Will and a being from another dimension has, this season, given Will magical powers himself.\n\n\tBeing queer, in other words, is a sort of superpower — and, this season, a boy who previously had stared wistfully out of windows waiting for his life to begin is now actually living it. Among the older-kid cohort of the show’s Hawkins, Indiana is Robin (Maya Hawke), who is somewhat more open about her own desires; she’s a semi-out lesbian whose brashness and ability to be forthright with Will give him no small measure of encouragement. (Will asks her how, exactly, she knew that she was barking up the right tree when she started pursuing her girlfriend; she told him that she knew how to read signals. Gaydar is its own magic power, too, honed with practice!) \n\n\tAnd this message, that in difference one finds strength and not weakness, sits right at the center of a show watched by many, many kids of all ages. (Numbers may not tell the full story of the “Stranger Things” juggernaut; I recently attended a holiday party at which a passel of middle-schoolers bemoaned the fact that they’d have obligations on Christmas Day, like opening presents, that would keep them from binging the new set of episodes immediately.) There have been harder times, perhaps, to be growing up aware of one’s own difference — like, say, 1987, when “Stranger Things 5” is set — but I wouldn’t wager it’s terribly easy right now. The fact of queerness occupying such a crucial thematic role in the show’s endgame means that many young people may take the idea that their friends will love them for who they really are to heart.\n\t\n\n\tFor, after all, Will isn’t shamed or cast out by his friends; to a one, they hear what he’s saying and affirm their support. (One senses, in some of the performances, that this news does not come as an Earth-shattering shock to a few of the characters.) And then they return to the matter at hand. They need to save the world, so that they all, differences aside, may go on living in it. \n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 2 Spoilers• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 1 Spoilers• Our 13 Burning Questions Ahead of the Series Finale• Noah Schnapp on That Scene in Volume 2• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1• Director Shawn Levy on Will’s Huge Breakthrough• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains details about Episode 6 of “Heated Rivalry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tIn what proved to be one of the most powerful scenes of the six-episode queer romance sports drama “Heated Rivalry,” pro hockey star Shane Hollander has a heart-to-heart with his momanger Yuna, when he comes out as gay to his parents.\n\n\tShane has not only told his mother and father about his sexuality, but he’s revealed he’s in a relationship with his career arch nemesis, Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie).\n\t\n\n\tYuna, played by “The Good Doctor” actress Christina Chang, apologizes to Shane for making him feel like he could not talk to her sooner. “I am so proud of you,” she says, embracing her son. “Please forgive me.”\n\n\n\tShane responds, “I forgive you, Mom.”\n\n\t“You do actually have a choice how to love somebody, and sometimes it’s a split-second decision that you can make,” Chang tells me over Zoom from her home in Vancouver, Canada. “I wanted to make sure that when she steps outside, it’s not about her…It’s about a lot of things. You don’t know what she’s going to say. There is a moment of suspension.”\n\n\tYuna could have unloaded on Shane, telling him she is worried about his career and his endorsements. “It could have gone that way, but ultimately, she chooses Shane,” Chang says.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHudson Williams as Shane Hollander, Connor Storrie as Ilya Rozanov, Dylan Walsh as David Hollander and Christina Chang as Yuna Hollander.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsabrina lantos\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn fact, Williams recently told me that it was this mother-and-son conversation that was a driving force behind wanting to play Shane. “That scene was the scene that ruined me the most when I read the script,” he said. “It was the scene that I was like, ‘If I don’t get to play Shane Hollander.’ It’s also a scene that’s not in the book, but to me it is the quintessential wrap-up scene to that arc for him and his mom. Period.”\n\t\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” is from creator Jacob Tierney and is based on Rachel Reid’s gay hockey romance novel series “Game Changers.” Chang read the scripts for the six-episode season after being offered the role of Yuna.\n\n\t“I was like, ‘Is this soft core porn? What’s happening? It’s hot. What the heck is happening right now? This is amazing. It’s like ‘Fifty Shades of…’ Oh, my God!’” she says, before adding with a laugh, “Thank God it wasn’t me getting naked.”\n\n\tWhat was it like filming the scene with Hudson? Did it feel heavy? \n\n\tNot on the day. I think Jacob said in an interview that these boys were so dedicated and so focused. First of all, just the way they were eating and the way that they were maintaining their health and their physique and then on top of that, they had skating lessons. And then, of course, Connor had his Russian lessons, which is a whole other impressive situation. So they were very focused. That said, we always knew how to have a good time and joke around. And though there was a lot of laughter on set because that’s a great outlet for when things are intense, nobody was making jokes while filming the scene. It was the last scene of the day, which I appreciated. I thought, “Well, good. I don’t want to feel like they have to rush to another scene.” When I read the scene, I was emotional, and then ever since then, I have been emotional.\n\n\tWhat’s your advice to parents who have a child who has come out to them?\n\n\tYour love for your child and their well-being is the most paramount. Everyone has a different definition of protection, but loving and protecting them means seeing them for who they are and embracing that. If your child has the courage to tell you this, just know that it likely wasn’t easy. So just love them for that, and work through it together.\n\n\tWhat did you think when you heard that HBO Max acquired the show from [Canadian streamer] Crave?\n\n\tI was like, ‘Now we have a shot. Now we are going to be seen.’ Didn’t know still how it would be received.\n\n\tAn NHL spokesperson has said that they welcome any opportunities that bring in new hockey fans. And then the next phenomenon is everyone asking their trainers at the gym how they can get hockey asses.\n\n\tIsn’t that crazy? Those boys [Williams and Storrie] are the nicest. Obviously, I’m not their mother, and I do like to have a good time with them because I am their friend, but I also feel protective of them.\n\t\n\n\tYou worry about them?\n\n\tI’m not experiencing [their fame] at all, but I’m watching it, and it’s really weird, and I think it’s weird for them. I’m not worried yet. The conversation online about their own personal lives is kind of an interesting topic. I understand the different perspectives.\n\n\tWhat are your hopes for Season 2?\n\n\tThat I get to spend as much time with Hudson and Connor as possible. Jacob expanded Yuna’s role just a tiny bit from the books. My hope is that we see this next chapter with them fleshed out, and we get to see her and Ilya form a relationship. I think it’s going to be lovely and fun to do.\n\n\tThis Q&A was edited and condensed for length and clarity.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s the most wonderful time of the year at the box office, and the sleigh full of Christmas Day releases continued to deliver on Friday. However, it was James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” that led the pack for the second weekend in a row.\n\n\tDisney’s third “Avatar” installment earned $22.6 million domestically on Friday, a roughly 39% decline from last week’s opening day. The film has grossed $46.6 million since Christmas and looks to add a total of $75 million to $80 million domestically by Sunday. North American earnings should reach $176 million by the end of the week.\n\t\n\n\tRounding out the top five were two holiday newcomers, including Jack Black and Paul Rudd’s “Anaconda” and Timothée Chalamet’s “Marty Supreme,” as well as holdovers like Disney’s “Zootopia 2” and Paul Feig’s “The Housemaid.”\n\n\n\tA24’s “Marty Supreme” took second on Friday with $6.73 million domestically from 2,668 locations. The film has earned $16.2 million since Christmas and is projected gross $30 million by Sunday. Directed by Josh Safdie, Chalamet stars as up-and-coming table tennis phenom Marty “Supreme” Mauser, who claws his way to the top of the sport through fast-talking hubris and explosive skill.\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” managed to break the top 10 at the domestic box office last week with $875,000 from just six screens. That’s $145,933 per theater, which is the best per-screen-average (PSA) of the year, the highest PSA of all time for A24 and the best PSA for a platform release since 2016’s “La La Land,” according to A24. The early hype is thanks to a stellar promotional campaign led by Chalamet, who channeled a Mauser-esque bravado to make “Marty Supreme” one of the most talked about original holiday releases in recent memory.\n\t\n\n\t“Zootopia 2” shot up to third place with $6.7 million on Friday after slotting at No. 5 this time last week. Schools are out for winter break, which is no doubt a contributing factor to the sudden rise of the family-friendly animated caper. The film looks to add $20 million by Sunday, an impressive result considering the film released a month ago. The domestic total should hit $308 million by the end of the week.\n\n\tSony’s “Anaconda” slithered to fourth place on Friday with $5.4 million domestically. The adventure comedy, which follows a group of amateur filmmakers trying to recreate their favorite 1997 film of the same name, earned $9.1 million on Christmas and is expected to gross $22 million by Sunday. Along with Rudd and Black, the film stars Steve Zahn, Thandiwe Newton, Daniela Melchior and Ice Cube. The rapper starred in the original film and plays himself in the remake for a meta pseudo-reprisal.\n\n\tThe No. 5 slot went to “The Housemaid,” which grossed $5.2 million on Friday, an uptick from its $3.5 million Christmas Day earnings. Starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, the psychological thriller looks to reach a domestic total of $45 million by Sunday. \n",

    "body": "\n\tJack Fisk is behind the looks of some of the most distinctive films of the past 30-plus years, from David Lynch’s “Mulholland Drive” to Paul Thomas Anderson’s “There Will Be Blood.” For Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme,” Fisk brought his long experience working with auteurs to create the expansive world of 1950s New York that Timothée Chalamet inhabits as scheming ping pong champ Marty Mauser.\n\n\tThe three-time Oscar-nominated production designer, who just turned 80, is likely the only one on the crew who remembers what the city looked like back then. But Safdie was just as obsessed with getting things right, Fisk says — even down to searching for the right size ping pong balls, since balls were slightly smaller in the 1950s than today’s version.\n\t\n\n\t“Josh has got so much energy and is such a lover of New York, and I was always trying to find things that I could tell him that were a little different. But he was ahead of me,” says Fisk.\n\n\n\tWorking with the likes Terrence Malick, Brian De Palma and Martin Scorsese, Fisk says, “was exciting times — we thought, like, we’re taking over the film business. And so now this was exciting for me, because there’s a whole new wave of young filmmakers that are brilliant,” he says.\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” takes place over numerous settings, from the atmospheric Lower East Side of 1950s New York, with its street vendors and small shops, to Japan, where the crew prepped and filmed for two weeks.\n\n\tLocations included New York’s Plaza Hotel and Indonesian Embassy, which stood in for swanky London hotels, and the Woolworth mansion on East 80th Street, where Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin O’Leary’s wealthy characters lived. “I couldn’t believe they let us shoot there. It was over the top,” Fisk recalls. International table tennis tournaments were recreated at Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey.\n\t\n\n\tFisk worked closely with Safdie to envision some of the film’s biggest set pieces, including the table tennis parlor Marty Mauser frequents that is based on Lawrence’s Broadway Table Tennis Club.\n\n\tChalamet, too, was involved in the production design, Fisk says. “His enthusiasm and his dedication to acting, and what he was doing was inspirational. I’m married to an actress (Fisk is married to Sissy Spacek), so I’m always building sets for the actors to help them, and he just took advantage of all of it. He knew what kind of research we were doing. He would come in all the time and look at drawings and models, and show up at locations. His excitement about the film made you excited to be a part of it.”\n\n\tFisk details what went into creating some of the film’s most important settings. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLawrence’s Broadway Table Tennis Club\n\t\n\t\tThe Table Tennis Club\t\n\n\tWhen Fisk read “The Money Player,” written by Marty Reisman, the 1950s ping pong champ who loosely inspired the story, he realized that Lawrence’s Broadway Table Tennis Club, where Marty hangs out, would be a central location. Though the building no longer exists, Fisk found vintage photos taken by the city.\n\n\tHe then asked Safdie’s wife, executive producer Sara Rossein, who was working on research for the film, to see if she could find the blueprints. “Not only did she find the blueprints, but she found an article from Look magazine or one of those magazines that had beautiful black and white photos of the place. We were able to see exactly how it was set up,” he says.\n\n\tThe art department even added the hand-painted landscape murals that were created when the space housed an indoor miniature golf course, though they aren’t very visible in the final cut.\n\n\tWhy was this level of detail so important?\n\n\t“You like to start somewhere, and you think that if it’s closer to authenticity, it might help the actors understand their character,” says Fisk. “We start with the most accurate representation we can find, and then we alter it to work for the film.”\n\n\t“I think in my heart, I approach a lot of these films that I do as documentaries. So research is fun, exciting, and it gives you a starting point,” Fisk says.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJosh Safdie, right, on location at the shoe store.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAtsushi Nishijima\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Shoe Store and 1950s Orchard Street\t\n\n\tFisk lived in New York in the early 1960s, so he had a fairly good idea of the right look. In addition, the crew studied N.Y. experimental filmmaker Ken Jacobs’ short film “Orchard Street,” which shows the crowds and streetscape of the Lower East Side neighborhood in color.\n\t\n\n\t“We actually shot Orchard Street on Orchard Street,” Fisk says. “We found a store there that we wanted to make the Northridge shoe store, and right next to it was a brand-new hotel. So we had a problem up and down the street. Everybody had modernized their buildings and put in tall plate glass,” he recalls. Plus, the street signs were different, and there was graffiti everywhere, which wasn’t there in the 1950s. Fisk explains that set designers built a modular system of tenement fronts that covered the ground-level building fronts.\n\n\t“Then Adam Willis, our decorator, started doing layers from the awnings over these modular fronts to the tables with all the things they were selling, and the storefronts, the windows we kept working on layers right out into the middle of the street. And it started to look very real.”\n\n\t“The graphic artist created signs for us, and then the scenic artist aged them beautifully, and we used those to hide a lot of the modern signs underneath and anything else that was offensive.”\n\n\t“It was fun to be on the street at that time, because you could kind of lose yourself and think you’re in the 1950s,” Fisk remembers.\n\n\tWhile the tenement interiors were shot on a stage, the shoe store was shot in an actual store that was rebuilt because the ceiling was falling down and the floor was unsafe, Fisk recalls. It was important to him to communicate a 1950s feeling through the colors of the interiors.\n\n\t“Whenever I go into an old place, I start peeling away paint or moving light switches to see what was under it, trying to get back in time,” he says. “We use a lot of colors from the ’50s, because they were just beautiful. Looking at period color charts, there’s very little white, but a lot of really rich colors. In my career, I’ve tried to always bring that color back in and avoid white like the plague. White just seems more contemporary to me, but it also just burns a hole in the film. If you look at white on a piece of celluloid, it’s just clear there’s nothing there.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese table tennis tournament in “Marty Supreme.”\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTokyo\t\n\n\tIn a climactic scene, Marty heads to Japan for a championship game. Fisk exchanged drawings and photographs with the Japanese art department for a month before the crew traveled to Tokyo, and they had already pulled together most of the graphics.\n\t\n\n\t“We had a plan on how to design the stage where they were going to have the tournament. We just didn’t know which stage it was,” Fisk says. After touring locations, they found a concert shell in a park outside Tokyo. “It was perfect. It was close to the period and it looked like you were in another country. Our crew put together some towers out of bamboo that we then covered with Japanese graphics.”\n\n\t“We found photographs of some artwork from the World Tournament in Tokyo, just a year or two after our film, and we were able to borrow from that,” says Fisk. \n\n\tSafdie, who speaks Japanese, was thrilled with how the scene came together, Fisk says. “It was such an easy place to work, and the people were so kind, and the art department was so talented. You would just kind of wish something and it would show up. The ping pong table was based on an old Japanese table. I sent them a picture of it, and next thing I knew, we had one.”\n",

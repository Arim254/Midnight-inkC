As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCHASE INFINITI as Willa Ferguson in “One Battle After Another.”  A Warner Bros. Pictures Release.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Casting Commentary (Updated Jan. 9, 2026): Best casting enters the Oscar ballot this year as a brand-new category, and fittingly, it arrives without a rigid precedent, forcing voters and prognosticators alike to define what excellence looks like in real time. Is it star power? Ensemble cohesion? Finding a discovery? Or the invisible architecture that allows a film’s themes to land through faces we instantly believe?\n\n\tThe Academy will ultimately select five nominees from the 10 shortlisted, which already hints at where momentum may form. Titles such as “Sinners” (Francine Maisler), “Frankenstein” (Robin D. Cook), “Marty Supreme” (Jennifer Venditti), “One Battle After Another” (Cassandra Kulukundis), “Wicked: For Good” (Tiffany Little Canfield and Bernard Telsey), “Weapons” (Allison Jones), “Sentimental Value” (Yngvill Kolset Haga and Avy Kaufman), “Hamnet” (Nina Gold), “Sirât” (Nadia Acimi, Luis Bertolo and Erika Boulic) and “The Secret Agent” (Gabriel Domingues) collectively spanning blockbusters, dramas and international cinema.\n\n\tThe strongest early industry signal comes from the Artios Awards, voted on by the Casting Society itself. Several films recur across multiple Artios categories, suggesting consensus within the profession. “Sinners,” “Frankenstein,” “Marty Supreme,” “Hamnet” and “Wicked: For Good” all landed nominations in the big-budget drama or comedy fields. That overlap is notable, as it mirrors the Academy shortlist more closely than any other precursor.\n\n\tBAFTA’s casting longlist further reinforces that picture, citing “Frankenstein,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme,” “One Battle After Another,” “Pillion,” “Sentimental Value,” “Sinners” and “Sirât,” along with “A House of Dynamite” and “I Swear.” The alignment between BAFTA and the Academy shortlist is unusually strong for a first-year category, suggesting a shared international understanding of casting?\n\n\tIf a narrative is emerging, it favors films whose casts feel inseparable from their identities. “Sinners” (which won Critics Choice) stands out for its blend of star presence and ensemble texture. The rest is your best guess.\n\n\tNominations voting will begin Monday, Jan. 12, and conclude Friday, Jan. 16. Official nominations for the 98th Academy Awards will be revealed Thursday, Jan. 22. The 98th Academy Awards will take place Sunday, March 15, at the Dolby Theatre and will be televised live on ABC in more than 200 territories worldwide.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Universal Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

In the period feature film category, “Frankenstein,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme” and “Sinners” all landed nods, immediately separating themselves as the core contenders. “Bugonia” added a crucial data point by appearing in the contemporary feature film category, signaling that its grounded, modern aesthetic still resonated strongly with the craft branch. \n\n\tThat cohesion only strengthened with BAFTA’s longlist, which included “Bugonia,” “Frankenstein,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme,” “Sinners,” “One Battle After Another” and “Wicked: For Good,” alongside genre-heavy entries like “Mickey 17” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps.” The overlap between BAFTA and ADG is notable, especially in a category where international taste often diverges from the Academy’s final five.\n\n\tCritics Choice effectively crystallized the race. Nominees mirrored the expected Oscar field almost exactly, with “Frankenstein,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme,” “Sinners” and “Wicked: For Good” all cited — and “Frankenstein” ultimately taking the win. That victory gives the film a commanding position, especially as it has consistently been recognized for scale and world-building across every major precursor.\n\n\tMarvel’s “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” adds a different dimension, offering a retro-futurist canvas where past and future collide through the sleek, stylized environments of Kasra Farahani and Jille Azis.\n\n\tNominations voting will begin Monday, Jan. 12, and conclude Friday, Jan. 16. Official nominations for the 98th Academy Awards will be revealed Thursday, Jan. 22.

As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGazelle (voiced by Shakira) in Walt Disney Animation’s ZOOTOPIA 2. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Animated Feature Commentary (Updated Jan. 9, 2026): The Producers Guild of America nominations offered a look at a year defined by scale and audience reach. Their lineup blended major studio sequels with newer originals, citing “The Bad Guys 2,” “Elio,” “KPop Demon Hunters,” “Zootopia 2” and the anime juggernaut “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle.” \n\n\tBAFTA’s longlist narrowed the focus slightly, spotlighting “Arco,” “The Bad Guys 2,” “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle,” “Elio,” “Little Amélie” and “Zootopia 2.” Notably, BAFTA leaned more international and auteur-friendly, a reminder that animation voters often reward emotional intimacy alongside technical sophistication (i.e., “Flow”). Notably “KPop Demon Hunters” wasn’t eligible.\n\n\tCritics Choice pushed the race forward decisively. Nominees included “Arco,” “Elio,” “In Your Dreams,” “KPop Demon Hunters,” “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” and “Zootopia 2,” with “KPop Demon Hunters” emerging as the winner. \n\n\tThe strongest confirmation of industry momentum, however, comes from the Annie Awards. Netflix’s “KPop Demon Hunters” and Pixar’s “Elio” led the field with 10 nominations each, including best feature and best character animation, a key bellwether category that often overlaps with the Oscar winner. Joining them in the Annie best feature lineup are “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain,” “The Bad Guys 2” and “Zootopia 2,” a group that almost perfectly mirrors the emerging Oscar picture.\n\n\tWhat’s striking this year is how clean the consensus appears to be forming. “KPop Demon Hunters” checks nearly every box: a Critics Choice win, PGA recognition, dominant Annie support and strong cultural penetration. “Zootopia 2” remains its most formidable challenger, buoyed by Disney’s track record and equal strength at the Annies and box office, while “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” stands a chance as the likely indie/art-house selection, especially given its sustained presence across critics and industry lists.\n\n\tNominations voting will begin Monday, Jan. 12, and conclude Friday, Jan. 16. Official nominations for the 98th Academy Awards will be revealed Thursday, Jan. 22. The 98th Academy Awards will take place Sunday, March 15, at the Dolby Theatre and will be televised live on ABC in more than 200 territories worldwide.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: GKids\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Pixar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Films (Animated Feature)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Evere\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tPaul Haggis has reached a settlement with the former film publicist who won a $10 million rape verdict against him in 2022.\n\n\tThe ex-publicist, Haleigh Breest, accused the “Crash” director of raping her and forcing her to perform oral sex after a premiere in January 2013. Breest obtained $10 million verdict at a trial in New York. A judge later added $2.8 million for her attorneys’ fees, and the total judgment has been accruing interest since then.\n\t\n\n\tUnder the settlement, Haggis will pay just shy of $2 million, according to a stipulation filed on Monday. The document states that the parties “have amicably resolved all disputes between or among them.”\n\n\n\tBreest sued Haggis at the height of the #MeToo movement in December 2017. She later said she was angered when she saw Haggis denounce Harvey Weinstein, who had been exposed as a serial sexual abuser weeks earlier.\n\n\tHaggis maintained his innocence, and initially sued Breest on the claim that she was extorting him. A prominent former Scientologist, Haggis went on to allege that the allegations were part of a plot to punish him for speaking out against the church — though no evidence of that emerged.\n\n\tAt the trial, Breest testified that she reluctantly agreed to go to Haggis’ apartment in Manhattan after the premiere, but said she adamantly refused his sexual advances.\n\n\t“I’m saying ‘No.’ I’m saying, ‘Stop.’ I’m saying it over and over,” she testified. “He looked like the devil. He seemed to like that I was saying no; that I was scared.”\n\n\tHaggis was 59 at the time; Breest was 26. \n\t\n\n\tAfter the trial, Haggis vowed to appeal and said he had drained his accounts fighting the case.\n\n\t“I’ve spent all the money I have at my disposal,” he told reporters. “I can’t live with lies like this. I would die clearing my name.”\n\n\tHaggis’ appeals were withdrawn in 2024. Breest’s attorneys, meanwhile, sought to collect on the judgment while simultaneously pursuing settlement talks. As of March 2024, they had successfully levied just $61,000.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothée Chalamet’s character in “Marty Supreme” was meant to embody a young kid from the streets of New York. \n\n\tDirector Josh Safdie wanted to bring real authenticity to the film, not just visually but also in how the characters looked and felt. \n\n\t“It wouldn’t make sense to drop Timothée in there and have him look like this clean movie star,” says prosthetic makeup designer Mike Fontaine. Fontaine — who is nominated at the Makeup and Hair Stylists Guild Awards, as well as shortlisted for best makeup at the Oscars — worked closely with Safdie and makeup artist Kyra Panchenko to ensure Chalamet fit seamlessly into the gritty world of the film.\n\t\n\n\tThe story follows Chalamet as Marty, an ambitious young man from New York’s Lower East Side, convinced that table tennis is his ticket to success. Set in 1952, Marty is a hustler working at his family’s shoe store, where he pretends customers’ sizes are out of stock to upsell them on pricier pairs. On the side, he’s always looking for his next get-rich-quick scheme.\n\n\tFontaine explains, “Josh knew what he wanted. He wanted acne scars, keloid scars, like he’s been in some fights.” Marty’s face prominently features a scar on his cheekbone and additional scarring under his chin, suggesting a rough life. \n\n\tIn one scene, Marty jumps out of a window and climbs down a fire escape to evade the cops. “Looking at that, you got the feeling maybe this isn’t the first time he’s done this,” Fontaine adds. “He’s probably taken a few falls and hits.” \n\n\tThe question during production was how far to take the look. “We had the great advantage on ‘Marty Supreme’ of doing extensive screen tests with Darius Khondji. He filmed those tests with Timothée on a stage.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter reviewing the footage with Chalamet and Safdie, Fontaine realized the makeup was too extreme and decided to re-sculpt and remake everything. The goal was to ensure the makeup didn’t distract the audience but rather felt invisible. “Myself, Kyra and [hairstylist] Jimmy Goode would get Timmy done in an hour. We’d be doing the hair and makeup all at the same time in Timothée’s trailer,” Fontaine explains. “Kyra would start on the brow, and Jimmy would be styling the hair.”\n\n\tIn total, Chalamet wore five prosthetics. “There were large pieces that covered his cheeks to give the acne-pockmarked skin texture. He had another piece on his cheekbone to create a deep scar on one side, two smaller pieces for scars under his lip, and a long scar under his chin.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSince Khondji was shooting close-ups with long lenses, Chalamet’s face was front and center, requiring intricate attention to detail. Fontaine also had to “drench him in fake sweat” during the intense table tennis matches Marty plays throughout the movie.\n\n\tSafdie wanted another level of authenticity when it came to distorting Chalamet’s vision. Rather than using prop glasses, Safdie opted for a combination of contact lenses and prescription glasses. Fontaine explains, “We put contact lenses in Timothée’s eyes that made his vision blurry, and then gave him very heavy prescription glasses on top of it, creating the illusion that his eyes were really beady and small.”\n\n\t Safdie previously told Variety, “At the time, we said we were going to put +10 contact lenses in your eyes, and we’re gonna put -10 prescription lenses in front of them so that when his glasses fall off, he can’t see anything.” When Chalamet tried on the combination, Safdie recalls receiving a call from the actor. “He calls me and says, ‘I’ve got the +10s in right now, and I’m pretty dizzy.’” \n\n\tAccording to Safdie, Chalamet described the experience as feeling like “he was in a fishbowl.” Still, Chalamet was determined. “I’ll do anything you ask me to do,” Safdie recalls the actor telling him. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters” screenwriters Danya Jimenez and Hannah McMechan are taking on some massive new IP — signing on to script Tim Burton‘s reimagining of the classic “Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman.”\n\n\tWarner Bros. Pictures tapped the writing duo to write the screenplay for the film, news of which broke in 2024. Burton is attached to direct the update to the 1958 science-fiction horror movie, which follows a wealthy heiress who grows into a giant after an alien encounter and exacts revenge on her cheating husband. The “Beetlejuice” and “Nightmare Before Christmas” filmmaker is also producing the film alongside Andrew Mittman and Tommy Harper. Gillian Flynn penned an earlier version of the script.\n\t\n\n\tLuckyChap — the production company led by Margot Robbie, Tom Ackerley and Josey McNamara — is on board to produce and develop; Morgan Begg, the company’s director of development, is overseeing the project. Kai Dolbashian serves as executive producer.\n\n\n\tJimenez and McMechan were named to Variety’s 10 Screenwriters to Watch for 2025 after penning the megahit animated movie, Sony Animation and Netflix’s “KPop Demon Hunters,” alongside co-director Maggie Kang. The screenwriting duo met while attending Loyola Marymount University; then, they got a script into the Sundance Feature Lab, where fellow screenwriter Nicole Perlman approached them with an idea that became “KPop Demon Hunters.” \n\n\t“We started writing that in 2020 during the pandemic,” Jimenez told Variety last year. “At first, we were like, ‘This is going to be the biggest movie ever, and then as time passed, we were like, ‘Maybe it won’t get made. Who knows?’ And then we were on set this summer and the trailer dropped and we were shocked. You don’t really expect anything from this career. You’re just grateful to get paid and if something happens with it, that’s great.”\n\t\n\n\tAdded McMechan: “This was truly the first time where there was all this manpower behind it, and it felt like it was on track to being made.”\n\n\tSince the release of “KPop Demon Hunters” last summer, it has become a worldwide phenomenon, becoming Netflix’s most-watched film of all time, while its songs broke records on Billboard 200. The movie is nominated for three awards at this year’s Golden Gobes including best animated motion picture, best original song and cinematic and box office achievement.\n\n\tThe Hollywood Reporter broke news of Jimenez and McMechan boarding the project. \n\n\tJimenez and McMechan are repped by WME and Mosaic.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has ordered a series adaptation of Justin Halpern’s 2012 memoir “I Suck at Girls,” which will be written by Halpert and Patrick Schumacker, who both serve as co-showrunners on “Abbott Elementary” alongside Quinta Brunson. “Shrinking” and “Scrubs” exec producer Bill Lawrence is also on board via his banner Doozer, as well as Warner Bros. TV.\n\n\tVariety hears the order is cast-contingent, meaning Netflix could scrap the project based on which actors the producers are able to attach.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix declined to comment.\n\n\n\tThe show follows three high school sophomores who stumble through teenage romances while navigating adolescence and identity. “I Suck at Girls” is based on Halpern’s romantic misadventures with childhood crushes and losing his virginity.\n\n\tHalpern and Schumacker are executive producing the series through their Delicious Non-Sequitur Productions alongside Chet Dave, Lawrence, Jeff Ingold and Liza Katzer.\n\n\tHalpern, Schumacker and Lawrence first developed “I Suck at Girls” as a pilot at Fox in 2013. At Fox, the show was developed with the working title “Surviving Jack,” and was framed as a single-camera ensemble comedy. Set in 1990s Southern California, Christopher Meloni was cast to as a man becoming a dad, as his son is becoming a man, “in a time before ‘coming of age’ was something you could Google.”\n\n\tLawrence remains involved because “Surviving Jack” was produced by Doozer Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television. At the time, Halpern and Schumacker were perhaps best known for their adaptation of Halpern’s Twitter feed “$#! My Dad Says.” The Fox version was executive produced by Halpern, Schumacker, Lawrence (“Spin City,” “Scrubs,” “Clone High,” “Cougar Town”) and Jeff Ingold. Victor Nelli (“Scrubs,” “The Bernie Mac Show”) directed the pilot.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere are voices that, once heard, cannot be unheard.\n\n\tFor Tunisian filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania, the voice of five-year-old Hind Rajab — pleading for help as Israeli forces surrounded her family’s car in Gaza in January 2024 — became an artistic and moral imperative she could not ignore.\n\n\t“Once you hear her voice, you can’t unhear it,” Ben Hania says, recalling the moment she first encountered the audio recording while scrolling through social media at a Los Angeles airport during her Oscar campaign for Four Daughters. “It wasn’t really a decision. I didn’t say I chose the subject of my next movie. I was working on another film, and I stopped when I heard her voice. I needed to respond to the feeling I was experiencing — a very deep sense of helplessness, sadness and anger.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWilla\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThat impulse became “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” a Tunisia–France co-production that has emerged as one of the most urgent and emotionally devastating films of the year. The narrative feature follows a Red Crescent response team racing to rescue the trapped child, incorporating the real audio recordings of Hind’s conversations with dispatchers. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival, where it received one of the longest standing ovations of the event, and has since become Tunisia’s official submission in the Academy Awards race, landing on the Oscar shortlist for best international feature.\n\n\n\tBen Hania’s approach was guided by ethical restraint as much as urgency. “From the beginning, I knew the recording — Hind’s voice — had to be central,” she tells Variety during the Awards Circuit Podcast. “I wanted to honor her voice.” Choosing a narrative reenactment over a traditional documentary stemmed from questions of perspective and responsibility. “Showing what was inside the car, or showing Hind herself, was never an option,” she explains. “I’m not the first filmmaker confronted with filming genocide. Those questions have been asked before. Showing the death of a child is not ethical.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film’s journey from Venice to wider distribution has been fraught — a reality Ben Hania anticipated. “I knew from the moment I started this project, at a time when conversation was almost impossible, that it would be a difficult ride,” she says. “I knew the film would be scrutinized, that I would have to fact-check everything again and again.” Still, audience reactions have been strikingly consistent, with viewers describing the experience as emotionally overwhelming and transformative.\n\n\tAs awards season unfolds and the film reaches new audiences, Ben Hania remains focused on her core purpose: ensuring Hind Rajab’s voice is not forgotten. She recently met Hind’s mother — now evacuated from Gaza — at the Doha Film Festival. Though unable to watch the film herself, Hind’s mother has attended screenings to witness audience reactions.\n\n\t“In Gaza, she couldn’t give her daughter a proper funeral,” Ben Hania says. “For her, being with the audience, seeing their response, has been very consoling. It gives her strength.”\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJessie Buckley stars as Agnes and Joe Alwyn as Bartholomew in director Chloé Zhao’s HAMNET, a Focus Features release.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Focus Features\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Adapted Screenplay Commentary (Updated Jan. 9, 2026): Is this one all figured out, or is there room for a surprise or two?\n\n\tBAFTA’s longlist established the widest view of the field, naming “28 Years Later,” “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” “Bugonia,” “Frankenstein,” “Hamnet,” “Nuremberg,” “One Battle After Another,” “Pillion,” “Train Dreams” and “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery.” \n\n\tThe clearest industry indicator so far comes from the USC Scripter Awards, which traditionally align closely with the Academy’s writers branch. Their nominations singled out Guillermo del Toro for Frankenstein (adapted from Mary Shelley), Chloé Zhao and Maggie O’Farrell for Hamnet, Paul Thomas Anderson for One Battle After Another (from Thomas Pynchon’s “Vineland”), and Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar for Train Dreams (from Denis Johnson). That lineup overlaps heavily with both BAFTA and Critics Choice, reinforcing a relatively tight core of contenders.\n\n\tCritics Choice added some further clarity. Nominees included “One Battle After Another,” “Train Dreams,” No Other Choice, “Frankenstein,” “Bugonia” and “Hamnet,” with “One Battle After Another” emerging as the winner. That victory matters. Historically, adapted screenplay winners at Critics Choice often match up with the Academy, despite no overlap in the memberships.\n\n\tWhat complicates the picture is timing. Writers Guild Award nominations and final BAFTA nominations will not be announced until after Oscar nominations are revealed, leaving voters without the usual consensus-building markers. In their absence, literary-forward awards like Scripter takes on added weight, and films that consistently show up across multiple, unrelated bodies gain an advantage by default.\n\n\tAs it stands, “One Battle After Another” holds the clearest edge.\n\n\tNominations voting will begin Monday, Jan. 12, and conclude Friday, Jan. 16. Official nominations for the 98th Academy Awards will be revealed Thursday, Jan. 22. The 98th Academy Awards will take place Sunday, March 15, at the Dolby Theatre and will be televised live on ABC in more than 200 territories worldwide.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Mubi\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: \"The Chronology of Water\" (Courtesy of CG Cinema)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Titles (Adapted Screenplay)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “People We Meet on Vacation,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tBook lovers reached their happy place Friday when the film adaptation of Emily Henry‘s beloved beach read “People We Meet on Vacation” dropped on Netflix. \n\n\tStarring Emily Bader and Tom Blyth as longtime best friends Poppy and Alex, the movie follows the odd-couple pairing throughout many years of travels as the free-spirited Poppy and up-tight Alex grow up and struggle with their increasingly intimate feelings for one another.\n\t\n\n\tIn a shock to no one who is a fan of rom-coms — which make up the bulk of Henry’s books, almost all of which are being developed for film — Poppy and Alex get together in the end, but first need to overcome their biggest fear: losing their best friend to gain a chance at romance with the love of their life.\n\n\n\tAs with many book-to-screen adaptations, changes were made during the filmmaking process, which was overseen by director Brett Haley and Henry herself from a script written by Yulin Kuang. But by far the biggest difference between the “People We Meet on Vacation” movie and the book it’s based on is the spiciness of the climactic sex scene between Poppy and Alex.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPeople We Meet on Vacation.

I saw the scene as he shot it, and it was gorgeous and perfect,” Henry told Variety. “I mean, I feel a little bit guilty because I went and told all of my friends, ‘It’s one of the sexiest sex scenes I’ve ever seen in my life.’ Like, genuinely it was like ‘Titanic’ level to me. It was so, so good and raw and tender. So when Brett first started considering cutting it, that was because they had started doing test screenings and people who, especially people who weren’t familiar with the books, felt kind of like it was a hard right turn in the movie. And so Brett first brought that to me and asked, how important is seeing the sex scene to you and to your readers? And I was like, I think it is kind of important, in a way, because it’s something we’re destigmatizing, etc. But ultimately, my opinion would be that if it doesn’t fit in the movie, then it  doesn’t work. It has to serve the larger movie. I don’t want anyone to feel like they were jolted out of the story, and feel like they hopped rails into a different movie.”\n\t\n\n\tSee below for more from Variety‘s interviews with Henry and Haley about Netflix’s “People We Meet on Vacation” film adaptation and what else needed to be cut and altered.\n\t\n\t\tChanging the location of the book’s present-day-trip storyline from a Palm Springs to Barcelona\t\n\n\tEmily Henry: Brett asked early on. He told me, “This is not really going to work to shoot in Palm Springs. That’s a really tall order.” And the funny thing that I always come back to is that not even the movie “Palm Springs” was shot in Palm Springs, that was shot elsewhere. That sealed the deal for me right off the bat that this is a fine change. I love Palm Springs and so I set the book in Palm Springs, because I love it and it’s an excuse to travel there and all that. But as far as story goes, it didn’t feel essential at all. What felt essential was that they were staying somewhere very, very, very hot. Uncomfortably hot. And so Brett brought the possibility of Barcelona to me. He knew that he really wanted to try and keep the Tuscany trip, and he knew that if we filmed in Spain, we would be able to use different locations to capture both Tuscany and Spain. And I had never been to Spain, so I was on board again because it was an opportunity for a trip for me. \n\n\tAnd he was excited about the fact that it could make the story and the scope of the movie feel really big to have multiple big international destinations. I feel this movie does have an international audience, too. So that’s a nice thing, too, to be able to get a couple of different countries represented on some level. But I was honestly fine with that change. I knew that that might be a harder one for the readers, because they pictured it all in Palm Springs, which looks quite different, but it didn’t change the story fundamentally, so I was fine with it.\n\n\tBrett Haley: What happens is, there’s logistics in making a film. I don’t have control over when the film is greenlit or how it’s greenlit. This movie was greenlit, and it was a go, go, go type situation. We didn’t have much time, and it was very clear on the budget that we had to shoot this film, that Palm Springs wasn’t an option at the time. There’s no crew there, it would have been a whole situation. And then California didn’t have any connections to any other parts of the book or the movie and the tax credit wasn’t around then. It was just a logistical change and we knew that we needed Europe settings, and what location could give us most bang for our buck?\n\t\n\n\tSo when I called Emily, and I just said, “Hey, what about Barcelona for the wedding instead of Palm Springs?,” she totally got it. And I said, “Let’s really look at that, what happens in that vacation?” And if you go back to the book, most of it is in an Airbnb with an air conditioner that doesn’t work. That’s the thing that was most important, and the balcony scene, which fans of the book will know what I mean, that was most important. \n\n\tAnd the wedding itself, and I think the wedding in this film is one of the most beautiful sets I’ve ever shot on. And Barcelona was a great stand in very hot in Barcelona, I can, I can attest, and, and I think we pulled off the balcony scene and, and the Airbnb stuff as great as possible, because that’s when he started realizing, like, it’s not really about being in Palm Springs, about these two being together again, stuck together after two. Years of something that went down, and we’re trying to figure out why. So at the end of the day, the location of that one wasn’t as as crucial to Poppy and Alex’s journey as maybe some of the other ones, but we did our best to pick the other locations and nail those and make it feel like, yeah, we’re we’re really in these places\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPeople We Meet on Vacation.

Short/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhich of Poppy and Alex’s trips from the book made it into the film and which got cut\t\n\n\tHenry: When Brett formally got the job, the first thing he did was call me and just assure me that basically we were on the same team, and that he wanted to know everything that the readers were going to be looking for and hoping for from the movie, and he wanted also to know what I was going to be looking for and hoping for from the movie. And so I gave him fairly comprehensive list of what I thought the readers were really going to have a checklist of what they were waiting for. And it was a long list an we could not get every single thing i,n but he found creative ways to get so many of the little in jokes and bits of dialogue in. And I didn’t really have that strong of feelings that any specific location needed to be in the movie. It was more plot points. \n\n\tTuscany, to me, was a very important trip. It didn’t have to be set in Tuscany — it still is in the movie and the book — but it was more just that the events of that felt really important to me. And Brett instantly was really excited about New Orleans. He’s from Florida, and has a lot of affection and love for New Orleans, as do I. And New Orleans is just a cinematic city. It feels like a party. There were so many reasons that it was one of the right destinations to home in on. I didn’t feel that precious about any one of the locations. And again, the thing that I’ve always come back to during this process is that the book is always going to exist. So if he had wanted to do all new vacations, I would have considered it. I mean, I would have definitely stopped to think, how are the readers going to feel about this? But as far as how I personally would respond, that would have been fine if they still had the same emotional beats and the same jokes and things that I knew people were going to be hoping for.\n\t\n\n\tHaley: I didn’t want to do any green screen. I didn’t want to fake it in that way. Obviously, we had to fake stuff like, we’re-in-Canada-but-we’re-not-in-Canada stuff. But I didn’t want to VFX goop it up and make it something where the audience went, “This doesn’t feel real. This feels something’s off here.” It needed to feel like we were on vacation with them. So it was a logistical thing where Spain represented a location that we could get a lot of different locations, we could make a lot work there. And then the other half of it for me, which was non-negotiable, was New Orleans, which is my favorite vacation in the movie, one of my favorite cities in the world. And so I said, well, we have to do New Orleans — and then what can we get out of Louisiana? And then how can we do really subtle things to make sure this sells as Ohio, New York, Boston, Tuscany, Squamish.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPeople We Meet on Vacation.

Courtesy of Netflix\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tToning down the spiciness of the sex scene\t\n\n\tHenry: So here’s what I’ll say. I saw the scene as he shot it, and it was gorgeous and perfect. I mean, I feel a little bit guilty because I went and told all of my friends, “It’s one of the sexiest sex scenes I’ve ever seen in my life.” Like, genuinely it was like “Titanic” level to me. It was so, so good and raw and tender. So when Brett first started considering cutting it, that was because they had started doing test screenings and people who, especially people who weren’t familiar with the books, felt kind of like it was a hard right turn in the movie. And so Brett first brought that to me and asked, how important is seeing the sex scene to you and to your readers? And I was like, I think it is kind of important, in a way, because it’s something we’re destigmatizing, etc. But ultimately, my opinion would be that if it doesn’t fit in the movie, then it  doesn’t work. It has to serve the larger movie. I don’t want anyone to feel like they were jolted out of the story, and feel like they hopped rails into a different movie. \n\n\tAnd I think part of it is that we start with Tom and Emily in college, and they feel very young in those scenes, in my opinion. And you look at them in a different way, and you get to watch them grow up, but it does feel a little bit different than if you were watching a movie about two 40 year olds or something. You’ve been with them since they were just-barely-not children. \n\t\n\n\tSo it’ll be interesting, because I do think that that will be something that will vary from adaptation to adaptation [with the other book-to-film projects]. Because I think the tone of the different projects are not necessarily all going to be the same tone as “People We Meet on Vacation,” just like I don’t think the books are exactly the same tone. So I do think we’ll have some sexier sex scenes, and I think we’ll have others that are more a traditional, classic rom-com fade-to-black situation. I think we’ll see the full gamut. And Brett and I have also talked about, I wonder if someday there could be a director’s cut where people can see this scene? Because it is really so beautiful, like, they all just outdid themselves. It feels so tender and real, but very, very sexy and romantic, and it just didn’t fit in the movie. And that’s what they say, kill your darlings. Like, if it doesn’t work in the larger project, it doesn’t really matter how good it is on its own.\n\n\tHaley: I think this one is so unique because it’s friends to lovers, and that’s a difficult thing to get right. I don’t think many films have been successful in it, because I think there’s a problem in going, well, just get together. You guys love each door, get together. But I think smart people know that when you have a really close friend, there’s an immense amount of inherent risk, and there’s no coming back if you cross that line. So for me, it was important that Tom and Emily had friendship chemistry and then romantic chemistry, and could we could feel that.\n\n\tIn terms of the steamier stuff, I think it was a tonal question for me. I just kept going back to the romantic comedies that I adore. Like, I wanted to do right by Emily’s book. And so we shot a scene that was literally, exactly what’s in the book, and readers know what that means. It, frankly, just didn’t gel with the film. It just didn’t tonally work. So it was really about finding the balance. I do want to push this genre forward, and I do think that rom-coms can be extremely sexy. And I think that this one is that. You have your classics, like “When Harry Met Sally” and “Notting Hill,” where there’s very little sex there. I mean, it’s extremely sweet, and you feel the chemistry, and it really works, but it doesn’t go too far. And I just kept coming back to those films like “Jerry Maguire” and all these films that just really inspired this film and saying, yeah, this doesn’t fit. The level of spiciness does not fit this tone. You see them grow up, you see them as kids, and then you see them as adults. And so it was really important to me to find a balance. And I think we did. I think we found the balance in the steaminess and the sexiness versus just the wholesomeness and the earnestness of their love. And I think what’s there really works and is true to the spirit of the book without tonally breaking the film, which was really one of the only things that I was like, oh, this, this idea that I had for this scene to be true to Emily’s book just frankly, didn’t work.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPEOPLE WE MEET ON VACATION, from left: Emily Bader, Tom Blyth, 2026. ph: Daniel Escale /© Netflix / Courtesy Everett Collection.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow Poppy and Alex end up on the final trip together — with them running into each other at baggage claim on arrival vs. planning to meet up from the start\t\n\n\tWe still keep the idea that she lies and says, “I’m going to Barcelona, too!” We wanted to really build up the possibility of conflict. And, like, wow, whatever went down between Poppy and Alex must have been bad. But deep down, they both want to see each other again. Like, that’s clear. And I think that’s from the book. There was something in when you read the book, it worked to be like, “Let’s go on one last trip and see if we can do this.” There was something in the film that just felt a little too easy. It just felt like, again, you want to pause the film and go, “Why are they not getting together?” \n\n\tAnd when I came up with the baggage claim scene, which I’m very proud of, I was like, on one hand, it’s chance, and on another hand, it’s very much Poppy being Poppy, and them being in the same place and getting sort of stuck together. It took a lot of figuring it out, but it feels like the stakes are higher to me for the film. And it’s not to say the stakes aren’t high in the book, it’s just a different type of stakes. And I would call one book stakes and movie stakes, and they just require different things and different elements. And again, we kept Emily Henry very close throughout all of this, I didn’t make any decisions without going to her and saying, “What do you think of this change? How do you feel about this?” \n\n\tI think it’s really important that Poppy still makes the decision to go. She still lies, she still makes the decision to go to see him, and he still calls her out to say, “What are you really doing here? Because I know the answer isn’t to cover some Barcelona story, it’s to see me, right?” So that was the most important thing, and I think we just needed a little bit more tension and drama in that for the film. It just required a little bit more. It’s those nuances in the adaptation that just show you what a movie is asking for and what a book is asking for. I think they’re just different things.\n\n\tThese interviews have been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/view-conference/\">View Conference</a> in Turin, Italy, stands out as a unique experience for speakers and attendees alike. Most, if not all, stay for the duration of the weeklong event, which features keynotes, panels, master classes, workshops and more against the majestic backdrop of the Alps in the northwestern Italian city.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m proud to say that View Conference 2025 is one of our biggest ever events,” conference director Maria Elena Gutierrez says. “This year’s program includes over 135 speakers from around the world, including 14 Academy Award winners and nominees. We have more than 20 in-depth workshops, countless panels and presentations, and two special screenings of blockbuster movies introduced by the filmmakers themselves. The list goes on.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe conference runs from Oct. 12-17. Speakers include the co-directors of Netflix’s popular “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kpop-demon-hunters/\">KPop Demon Hunters</a>,” Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans; writer and director of the upcoming Warner Bros. Animation film “Cat in the Hat,” Alessandro Carloni; DreamWorks’ live-action “How to Train Your Dragon” writer-director Dean DeBlois, VFX supervisor and creative director Christian Manz and overall animation supervisor Glen McIntosh; directors of Pixar’s “Elio” Domee Shi and Madeline Sharafian; and Netflix’s upcoming “In Your Dreams” directors Alex Woo and Nicky Lavender as well as head of character animation Sacha Kapijimpanga, among many others.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBoth “KPop Demon Hunters” and “How to Train Your Dragon” will screen at the conference, each introduced by their creatives. Also, this year’s event will honor Doug Chiang, senior vice president and executive design director of Lucasfilm, with the View Visionary Award for his contributions to the industry.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“One of the biggest thrills of View Conference 2025 will be planning your week,” Gutierrez notes. “Spend a morning in the company of an Oscar-winning filmmaker then, after eating your lunch surrounded by like-minded professionals and enthusiasts, dive deep into your favorite creative discipline with one of our in-depth workshops. You might think the following day is rinse and repeat, but no. Why not enjoy a panel of experts discussing the future of storytelling, or get your portfolio reviewed by a world-class professional artist, or go behind the scenes on one of this year’s blockbuster movies? The next day will be different again. The possibilities are endless.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso featured at the conference will be Universal’s upcoming “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/wicked/\">Wicked</a>: For Good.” VFX supervisor Pablo Helman and animation supervisor Dale Newton will discuss their work on both “Wicked” films and answer audience questions. Other big films represented at the conference are Disney’s “Tron: Ares” and live-action “Lilo & Stitch,” Apple’s “F1,” Warner Bros.’ “Superman,” and Marvel’s “Fantastic Four: First Steps.”</p>\n<p>\n\tA number of high-profile TV projects are also sending speakers to the View Conference, including Netflix’s “Wednesday” and “The Sandman,” as well as HBO’s “The Penguin.” In addition, the program includes discussions about cutting edge technologies and AI.</p>\n<p>\n\t“But this is about more than just the numbers,” Gutierrez says. “What people remember about View Conference is our warm, vibrant atmosphere, where attendees get to learn from the best of the best, meet their heroes, and come away feeling truly inspired. It’s what I call the View Conference buzz.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Gutierrez and many attendees, the View Conference is mostly about community. Each year, Gutierrez works to bring together like-minded individuals to share ideas and experiences in a relaxed and welcoming setting.</p>\n<p>\n\t“People come once, and then they stay. They are hooked,” she says. “And whenever they have a new project to present, they want to bring it here and show it off at the View Conference. They make it a priority.” She points out that in most cases, it’s difficult to get 15 minutes with people of the caliber that attend the conference. “So, if you have them around for an entire week, I mean, how special is that?”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tMessage Pictures, the purpose-driven production company behind the Netflix hit “Katrina: Come Hell and High Water,” has signed for representation with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/verve/\">Verve</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tFounded in 2022, the shop will send their acclaimed Sundance project “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-perfect-neighbor/\">The Perfect Neighbor</a>” to limited theaters in October for awards consideration. Message hails from acclaimed filmmaker Geeta Gandbhir, Oscar-nominated director Sam Pollard and creative producer Alisa Payne. The company’s mission is to center storytelling from and about BIPOC and underrepresented communities.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“At Message Pictures, our mission is to work with representatives who understand the substantive change that we are trying to create in our industry. We believe Verve shares our vision of the industry’s future, and will be excellent partners in expanding Messages Pictures prospects while keeping equity, equality and inclusion at the forefront of all our ventures,” the founders said.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTheir flagship series “Katrina” commemorated the 20th anniversary of the hurricane and its devastating impact on New Orleans. That premiered Aug. 27 and features episodes directed by Gandbhir, Samantha Knowles and Spike Lee, with Payne serving as showrunner and producer. Lee, Pollard, and Gandbhir were executive producers. </p>\n<p>\n\t“The Perfect Neighbor” nabbed a jury prize in Sundance this year, for Gandbhir’s directing. The film, in theaters October 10 and streaming October 17, examines how a seemingly minor neighborhood dispute in Florida spiraled into deadly violence, with police bodycam footage and interviews exploring the broader impact of Stand Your Ground laws.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMessage has also collaborated on the HBO doc “The Devil Is Busy,” a look at the shifting realities of reproductive healthcare in America following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong>SPOILER ALERT: </strong><em>This story discusses major plot developments in Season 2, Episode 6 of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/peacemaker/\">Peacemaker</a>,” now streaming on HBO Max. </em></p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/james-gunn/\">James Gunn</a> said in a new interview with <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/peacemakers-james-gunn-on-that-big-alternate-earth-reveal\" target=\"_blank\">GQ magazine</a> that he heard from “a few racists” after “Peacemaker” dropped its bombshell Nazi twist during Season 2 Episode 6. Much of the new season of the DCU series has taken place on Earth X, which fans now know is an alternative universe where Nazi Germany won World War II. So yes, Gunn’s new DCU has a planet out there run by Nazis. The second season of “Peacemaker” is set after Gunn’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/superman/\">Superman</a>,” with Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor recently making a cameo on the show.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I really do whatever I want with ‘Peacemaker’ — and I mean, in one respect, I do whatever I want with anything, because I am able to make my own choices and I’m my own boss. But with ‘Peacemaker,’ we really let it go. We take chances. We go to places where I think other people are afraid to go,” Gunn told GQ. “We got a lot of pushback from various sources within the structure, on this episode in particular, and we’re like, ‘Let’s not be bashful about this. Let’s just do the story that we want to do and I don’t want to have to pull punches with it.'” \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I have a few racists that have called me polarizing, but I’m okay with being polarizing and letting racists fall to the wayside,” Gunn added. “People have loved this episode the most, so it’s exciting. … Listen, we’re dealing with a very sensitive subject. We’re dealing with racism and, at the same time, there’s humor in this episode. And so, you’re dealing with something very delicate and yet we’re not being delicate about it — but I don’t think we’re not being delicate in a non-thoughtful way. We’re being thoughtful about it.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/peacemaker-lex-luthor-cameo-nazi-twist-no-superman-1236530679/\">to <em>Variety</em> </a>after the episode aired, Gunn revealed he held his own private test screenings of “Peacemaker” Season 2 to see if anyone would notice some of the tidbits sprinkled throughout the episodes that tease the big Nazi reveal. The most notable tidbit is that Earth X is populated only with white people.</p>\n<p>\n\t“No one noticed at all,” Gunn said. “That was people of color, too, by the way. It wasn’t just, you know, the whites.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSome internet sleuthers did end up noticing the all-white Earth X, however, as Gunn explained: “It’s really hard when you’re online and one person out of the millions of people that are watching the show says, ‘Wait a second, here’s a screenshot of what it’s like in the alternate world, and here’s a screenshot of the background actors in the DCU,’ and you see the difference between them immediately. A lot of people don’t go online to talk about television. So I got a lot of comments of people that were freaked out. But a lot of people knew it was coming.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Peacemaker” drops new episodes on Thursdays on HBO Max.<br /></p>\n</div>",

The pop band has teamed with Lola Blankets for a<a href=\"https://lolablankets.pxf.io/c/256585/2135051/27144?subId1=VR&u=https%3A%2F%2Flolablankets.com%2Fcollections%2Flola-x-lany\" target=\"_blank\"> limited-edition faux fur blanket</a>, designed in a muted brown-and-black windowpane pattern. The collaboration marries LANY’s forthcoming “Soft” with Lola’s reputation for creating viral, ultra-soft blankets that have become synonymous with aspirational comfort on social media. </p>\n<p>\n\tLola Blankets has carved out a niche in the home and lifestyle market, known for its oversized, innovative designs that frequently dominate TikTok and Instagram. The brand has built its following on scarcity-driven drops and buzzy collaborations, positioning itself as both a luxury good and a collectible. By partnering with LANY, Lola leans into the growing intersection between music and lifestyle, offering fans a piece that goes beyond standard merch into something more permanent and tactile. \n\t</p>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://lolablankets.pxf.io/c/256585/2135051/27144?subId1=VR&u=https%3A%2F%2Flolablankets.com%2Fcollections%2Flola-x-lany\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-03-at-1.56.46-PM.png 1646w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-03-at-1.56.46-PM.png?resize=150,125 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-03-at-1.56.46-PM.png?resize=300,250 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-03-at-1.56.46-PM.png?w=1024\" alt=\"Pop Band LANY Partners With Lola Blankets on Soft Throw Blanket\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<p>\n\tFor LANY, the partnership arrives at a pivotal moment. The Los Angeles-bred band, fronted by Paul Klein, has spent the last decade evolving from dreamy alt-pop to expansive pop-rock. Their past projects, from 2018’s heartbreak-driven “Malibu Nights” to 2023’s more rock-inflected “A Beautiful Blur,” have showcased an oscillation between minimal vulnerability and maximal production. Their upcoming sixth studio album, “Soft,” slated for release on October 10, marks what Klein has called an emotional reset — a conscious effort to “stay soft” despite the hardening effects of the world. Its lead single, “Know You Naked,” released in August, signals the start of this new chapter. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Lola × LANY blanket isn’t just a seasonal drop. It’s designed to reflect the ethos of the album itself: a piece that embodies comfort, intimacy and warmth. The understated brown and black tones are versatile enough for any living space while carrying the symbolic weight of the band’s messaging — an invitation to wrap oneself in softness as a physical counterpart to the emotional terrain of the record. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe collaboration also points to a wider trend in the industry, where artists are increasingly merging music merchandising with lifestyle and design. Rather than limiting fan offerings to concert tees or vinyl, projects like this one bring an artist’s aesthetic into the home, extending the listening experience into daily life. </p>\n<div><p>\n\tShop the Lola Blankets x LANY collab <a href=\"https://lolablankets.pxf.io/c/256585/2135051/27144?subId1=VR&u=https%3A%2F%2Flolablankets.com%2Fcollections%2Flola-x-lany\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p></div>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tPeru’s most prominent production company, Tondero, run by Miguel Valladares, has officially set up an outpost in Madrid, following its fifth co-production in Spain, the upcoming “A Family” (“Una familia”) by celebrated Spanish actor-writer Ricardo Gómez (“Las aguas mansas”) in his first directorial outing.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith “A Family,” Tondero lays the groundwork for its new office in Madrid, which will facilitate its access to Spain’s filming incentives and co-production treaties with other countries. Tondero España is currently developing two feature films and a series for streaming services.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tTondero’s move follows the lead of other Latin American companies, most recently by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/chile-clara-films-madrid-imaginary-kingdom-1236533079/\">Chile’s Clara Films of Chile.</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTondero recently co-produced Salvador del Solar’s “Ramón y Ramón” with Pedro and Agustín Almodóvar’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/el-deseo/\">El Deseo</a>. The romantic drama was theatrically released in Peru and Spain following its world premiere at the 2024 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/san-sebastian-film-festival/\">San Sebastian Film Festival</a>. It also has a series in development with El Deseo and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/infinity-hill/\">Infinity Hill</a>, based on the hostage crisis that took place at the Japanese embassy in Lima in 1996.</p>\n<p>\n\t“A Family” brings together a strong team of producers: El Desorden Crea, founded by “Élite” creator Carlos Montero, Lágrimas Films, headed by Diego Betancor (“Élite,” “Respira”) and Estela Films, led by Félix Tusell (“El Trono”).</p>\n<p>\n\tThe project also has the backing of Spanish broadcaster RTVE, Movistar Plus+ and funding from national film agency ICAA and the Madrid region. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/filmax/\">Filmax</a> will handle distribution.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith filming set to begin shortly, this marks another step in Tondero’s strategy to build strong creative ties in Spain, working alongside some of the country’s top producers.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m truly excited about this project– not only because it’s a beautiful and deeply personal story told by Ricardo Gómez, who at such a young age opens his heart to a narrative that I personally connect with, but also because I get to co-produce it with Diego Betancor, a fantastic Spanish producer I’ve been wanting to work with for years. It’s finally happening, and I couldn’t be happier. I believe we’ll form a great team, and this also strengthens my mission to bring more Peruvian talent to Spain,” Valladares told <em>Variety.</em> <em>. </em>He has been in Madrid for the 5<sup>th</sup> Iberseries & Platino Industria and for a round of meetings.</p>\n<p>\n\t“A Family” follows three interconnected stories from one family: a former child actor caught between fiction and reality, a prisoner on temporary leave and a woman overwhelmed during her child’s baptism.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tSean “Diddy” Combs has been sentenced to four years, or 50 months, in prison after he was convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He has already served 12 months in jail, which counts toward his sentence. Combs is expected to file an appeal immediately.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring his Oct. 3 sentencing hearing in Lower Manhattan, Combs pleaded with Judge Arun Subramanian for “mercy” in a tearful speech. He spoke more during the hearing than throughout his entire eight-week criminal trial, at which he was accused of violently beating his girlfriends and coercing them into sexual performances. He was acquitted of serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn remarks immediately before the sentencing decision, Combs thanked the judge and offered personal apologies to Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, “Jane” and the other alleged victims of the case. He said one of the “hardest things” about this past year has been “having to be quiet” and “not being able to express how sorry I am for my actions.” Addressing his “disgusting, despicable” 2016 attack on Ventura as captured on hotel surveillance video, Combs apologized to all victims of domestic violence, saying “I know it triggered a lot of people around the world.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“My actions were disgusting, shameful and sick,” Combs said. “I was sick. Sick from the drugs. … I needed help, but I didn’t get the help.” Combs said he makes “no excuses” for his actions because “I knew better, my mother raised me better.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I got lost in excess. I got lost in my ego,” Combs said, adding that his decisions led him to lose his freedom, his ability to parent his children and, “most of all … my self-respect.” “I’ve been humbled, broken to my core,” Combs said. “I hate myself right now.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAs he turned around to face his six adult children standing in the gallery, Combs began crying and said, “Y’all deserved better.” He apologized to his mother, Janice Combs, saying he “failed” her as her only son. Combs begged the judge for a light sentence so that he could be reunited with his family. “I’ll never put my hands on another person again,” he vowed.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/diddy-guilty-prostitution-trial-verdict-1236440258/\">July verdict</a> of his criminal trial, Combs’ lawyers filed multiple motions for acquittal and requested that he be sentenced to 14 months, which, given his time already served, would release him by the end of the year. Federal prosecutors initially argued that Combs deserved at least four to five years in prison. Earlier this week, they amended their request to more than 11 years. (Combs was found guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution under the Mann Act. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.)</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Friday morning in court, prosecutor Christy Slavik began with opening remarks, emphasizing that Combs “has not admitted his guilt” or “accepted responsibility” and slamming the defense’s primary argument as “flatly inconsistent with reality.” She underlined the government’s recommendation of at least 135 months in prison, comparing it to other Mann Act cases. “His respect for the law is just lip service,” she said of Combs, revealing that the disgraced music mogul apparently booked a speaking engagement in Miami for next week. “That is the height of hubris,” Slavik said.</p>\n<p>\n\tDefense attorney Jason Driscoll rebutted Slavik’s argument, and Nicole Westmoreland started crying during her lengthy remarks about how Combs is an “inspiration” and Black business pioneer. She told the judge about Combs’ behavior at the Metropolitan Detention Center over the last 13 months, saying he taught other inmates business skills in a six-week course. “Mr. Combs can reach so many more on the outside than he can on the inside,” Westmoreland said, pleading for a lenient sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll six of Combs’ grown children spoke at the sentencing hearing in defense of their father, underlining that “he has completely transformed” since his 2024 arrest. “He’s my hero … he’s still my superhero,” said Christian Combs, who began his remarks by talking about how much he resembles his father. Sniffling, he added, “Please give my family grace.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCombs’ daughters Jessie, Chance and D’Lila, each broke down in tears in the courtroom as they described growing up without their mom, Kim Porter, who died in 2018. “We need our father,” Chance said, weeping. “We cannot watch our baby sister grow up fatherless,” she added, referring to the 2-year-old Love. As he listened to his children, Combs looked visibly distressed, clutching his stomach while seated next to his attorneys.</p>\n<p>\n\tJudge Arun Subramanian thanked the Combs kids for speaking. “I know how hard it was to stand up here,” he said, adding that it was really “important” for him to hear from them.</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking next was Brian Steel, who said Combs’ violence was the result of “untreated trauma” and a “ferocious drug addiction.” Steel said Combs underwent a medical procedure in 2000 and was prescribed painkillers. Since that day until 2024, “Sean has been high every single day,” said Steel. The lawyer also described the rough conditions in jail, saying Combs was attacked by a fellow inmate holding a shank, and prison guards stopped the assailant as he was standing over Combs, about to “cut” him. Steel said Combs has not slept more than two consecutive hours over the past year and hasn’t seen daylight except on his commutes to court. He said Combs hears screaming all night in jail, has to deal with “polluted” water and “eats chips all day long.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe night before his sentencing on Oct. 3, Combs <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/diddy-asks-judge-for-leniency-ahead-of-sentencing-1236537493/\">filed a letter to the judge</a> asking for leniency in his sentencing. In the letter, he apologized for “the hurt and pain that I have caused others” and vowed to “never commit a crime again.” He also described his dire situation in jail, writing, “I have been humbled and broken to my core.”</p>\n<p>\n\tA few days earlier, Combs’ ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, the star witness in his criminal trial, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/diddy-prosecutors-request-11-year-prison-sentence-1236528770/\">filed her own letter to the judge</a>. Ventura wrote that she still has nightmares about Combs, who, in a key piece of trial evidence, was seen violently beating her in a hotel.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a statement to <em>Variety</em> following the sentencing, Ventura’s lawyer Douglas H. Wigdor said, “This entire criminal process started when our client Cassie Ventura had the courage to file her civil complaint in November 2023. Although the jury did not find Combs guilty of sex trafficking Cassie beyond a reasonable doubt, she paved the way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution. By coming forward with her experience, Cassie has left an indelible mark on both the entertainment industry and the fight for justice. We must repeat – with no reservation – that we believe and support our client who showed exemplary courage throughout this trial. She displayed unquestionable strength and brought attention to the realities of powerful men in our orbit and the misconduct that has persisted for decades without repercussion. This case proved that change is long overdue, and we will continue to fight on behalf of survivors.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCombs’ two-month federal trial began in May, when the Bad Boy Records founder faced charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He was acquitted of those major charges, dodging a potential life sentence in prison. More than 30 witnesses testified against Combs, accusing him of crimes including drug distribution, arson and rape. Ventura and another ex-girlfriend of Combs’ alleged that he coerced them into having hundreds of “freak-offs,” days-long, drug-fueled sex marathons that he often filmed with male escorts whom he flew across state lines.</p>\n<p>\n\tFederal prosecutors painted Combs as the leader of a criminal enterprise and a sex trafficker who violently abused women and plastered them with drugs to fulfill his sexual fantasies. His defense lawyers argued that he was an amateur pornographer who had toxic, yet fully consensual relationships with his accusers.</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite the fact that Combs was found guilty on two counts and denied bail by the judge, his attorneys <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/diddy-lawyers-react-verdict-victory-1236444835/\">claimed “a great victory”</a> after the verdict. In the courtroom, Combs pumped his fist and mouthed “thank you” at the jurors. Members of his family and defense team cried. Lead prosecutor Maurene Comey was fired by the Department of Justice two weeks after the verdict, with no explanation.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/diddy-lawyer-trump-pardon-prison-experience-1236476565/\">interview with <em>Variety</em></a> in August, Combs’ lead counsel Marc Agnifilo said he felt Combs received “as fair a trial as possible.” As for Combs’ life after prison, he said, “The work that he didn’t do in his early 20s, I think he’s going to do it now. Sometimes — not all the time — he looks at [these consequences] as a blessing.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/hailee-steinfeld/\">Hailee Steinfeld</a> no longer has to prove herself.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Steinfeld walks into a room with the sincere composure that comes from experience after nearly two decades in Hollywood, she carries herself with quiet confidence. But lately, she’s had to adjust to something new: strangers yelling explicit movie quotes at her in public — specifically, the one from her hit vampire-horror film “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sinners/\">Sinners</a>.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhich line, you might ask? “I heard you loud and clear, but then you stuck your tongue in my cooze and fucked me so hard I figured you changed your mind.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tYep, that one.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I respect and appreciate you,” she says with a laugh, reflecting on the viral reception to her film and responding to fans who quote it to her in the street. “I know what the line is. You don’t have to tell me. People like to bring up certain moments in that movie, certain lines. That’s always awkward in the market or out in public.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThat “line” needs no explanation for fans of Warner Bros.’ Southern Gothic epic, which has dominated the cultural conversation since its spring release. The moment — delivered by Steinfeld’s character Mary on a humid New Orleans train platform — was clipped, memed and replayed across TikTok, igniting think pieces and parodies alike.</p>\n<p>\n\tSteinfeld tells <em>Variety</em>‘s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/awards-circuit-podcast/\">Awards Circuit Podcast</a> that she didn’t see that type of reception coming. “I certainly didn’t expect that line — or any of the lines that people really ran with from Mary — to sort of explode the way they did,” she says on this week’s episode. “You never expect these things to blow up… and it’s always so interesting to see what people take with them and run with.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn this episode of the <em>Variety </em>Awards Circuit Podcast, Steinfeld discusses her experience working with the Oscar-nominated filmmaker on “Sinners,” one of the year’s biggest hits and this upcoming season’s most undeniable awards contenders. She also reflects on her first Oscar nomination 15 years ago for “True Grit” and teases bits from “Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse” and whether she will return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Kate Bishop. </p>\n<p>\n\tAlso on this episode: Tonatiuh, the breakout star from the musical “Kiss of the Spider Woman” from writer and director Bill Condon. Listen below!</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Read excerpts from the edited and condensed version below.</em></p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MCDSINN_WB033.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MCDSINN_WB033.jpg?resize=150,54 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MCDSINN_WB033.jpg?resize=300,107 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MCDSINN_WB033.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Hailee Steinfeld, “Sinners” (Warner Bros. / Courtesy Everett Collection)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>Your line in “Sinners” went wildly viral. What was filming that scene like, and did you expect it to blow up?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tFor starters, I don’t know that you ever expect anything to blow up the way they ultimately do. It’s always so interesting to see what people take with them and run with.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I read a script, there’s always a scene or two that you dog-ear or red-circle. That’s the hill to climb. It’s the daunting thing that eats you alive until you shoot it. I hoped we wouldn’t shoot that scene too soon, so I’d have time to feel grounded in where the character was. And sure enough, we shot it first.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe were filming in New Orleans during hurricane season, so everything got moved around. I got a call that they’d pulled up that scene — one of the two I thought we’d save for the end. It was the first thing Michael [B. Jordan] and I shot together. I thought I needed time with him, with Ryan [Coogler], to build rapport. But it actually worked out — by then, our characters had lived some of the memories we refer to in the film. It was almost like we did it in reverse, but in a great way.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe were fighting light like crazy that day, so we didn’t do a lot of takes. The camera was rolling as long as it could, getting as much as possible before the mag ran out. I definitely didn’t expect that line — or any of Mary’s lines — to explode the way they did. But there it is.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere’s one more detail I love. Ruth E. Carter, our costume designer, and I made a last-minute change. There was a red dress I originally imagined for that scene, this fiery entrance off the train. But Ryan said, “What if she’s in a pretty, pale mauve tone? It makes what she says even more unexpected.” And he was right. It changed the energy completely.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>How has it been dealing with fans who quote that line back to you?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tOh God. There have been a couple moments — people like to bring up certain lines in the movie, especially that one. That’s always…yeah, awkward. Like, I respect and appreciate you, but I know what the line is. You don’t have to tell me. Especially when someone nearby isn’t in the know, it can get weird fast.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>You contributed to the “Sinners” soundtrack after stepping back from music. What was that like?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt was a perfect full-circle moment. A few years ago, I made a conscious decision to step back from music. That did affect what we were thinking about in terms of me singing in the movie. But by the time it was done, contributing to the soundtrack was just a beautiful reminder of why I love making music.</p>\n<p>\n\tI’ve always wanted to create music from a place of purpose and storytelling — and that started for me through film. Being back in the studio with Ludwig Göransson, who’s been on my bucket list since I was 17, was surreal.</p>\n<p>\n\tWriting the song, I kept asking, “Is this from my perspective, or from Mary’s?” It became both. And I had the advantage of knowing her deeply.</p>\n<p>\n\tI also got to be around so much incredible talent. Watching Miles [Caton] pick up a guitar and just be <em>magic</em> — it was inspiring. That whole environment re-lit something in me.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>Could you see yourself in a Coogler musical?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tListen, absolutely. I secretly wish that if Ryan does anything, ever — all the time — I could be a part of it.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>Let’s talk about your Oscar nomination for “True Grit.” What do you remember from that morning?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tOh man, it feels like both a million years ago and like it just happened yesterday. I’ll never forget that morning. My mom had been trying so hard to protect me — she didn’t want me to even know when the nominations were being announced.</p>\n<p>\n\tI woke up to her screaming from the other room, and my brother and my parents ran in with flowers. It was surreal. I ordered chocolate chip pancakes on the way to the Four Seasons.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat whole year was wild. We wrapped the movie, and it came out like 14 seconds later. I was flying everywhere, doing press for the first time ever, and hearing talk about awards constantly. It was a lot. I still feel like I owe everything to that cast and crew.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>How did that experience shape how you navigate the industry today?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think those realizations hit me more as I get older. After the Oscars, there was a conscious decision to pause. We never put a specific timeframe on it, but I needed to take a beat and think about what the right next thing would be.</p>\n<p>\n\tOver time, I’ve learned how momentum is a real thing — you want to keep going, so you say yes to great people and great scripts. But I didn’t really stop for years. The pandemic and the strikes made me look at life outside of work. It was terrifying and freeing. In this business, you never stop proving yourself, and I love that… and sometimes hate it. No two days are ever the same. And I love that too.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>How has your marriage to Josh Allen shaped your everyday life, and how is his nose?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tHis nose is good. What we do is so unpredictable, and his job is on such a strict schedule. So it’s actually a blessing — I try to organize my time so I can be where he is. This time of year, I get to hunker down, slow down, support him and live life. When the offseason rolls around, it’s go-time for me.</p>\n<p>\n\tI’ve never lived this part of life before — outside of my work. I’ve gotten a lot better at understanding what it means to slow down and to share that with someone. That’s the greatest thing ever.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>Marvel fans are always curious on what’s the status of Kate Bishop and that mysterious IMDb listing for “Champions.”</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI saw that! You’re telling me anyone can just update IMDb now? Because part of me was like, “Is this someone random just throwing stuff out? Or someone who knows something?”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for Marvel, I’m always waiting by the phone. I love that family. I’m so grateful to be a part of it. Anytime they need me, they know where to find me.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>You’re also back as Gwen Stacy in “Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.” What can you tell us?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWe’re into it. I wonder sometimes if anything ever gets scrapped, because I’ve said the word “Miles” in so many different ways and tones — they probably have a whole library.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the process is constantly changing. You never get the full script at the top. It evolves. And that makes it so crazy and fun to be a part of.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>What advice do you have for young people trying to break into the industry?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tDo it. Just do it. Whether it’s for work or for fun — hopefully both. This job rarely feels like a job to me, and that’s the best part.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSomeone asked me what I’d tell my younger self. I immediately thought of 13-year-old me going to the Oscars for my first movie ever. That doesn’t happen — but it can. At any point in your life. There’s no expiration date on this profession.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf it makes you happy and makes you feel like the truest version of yourself, it can never be wrong. People will always have opinions — take them with a grain of salt. Trust your instincts. That’s what gets me through every decision I make.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere will be a lot of hurdles but consider them moments to improve. Moments to continue the grind.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift/\">Taylor Swift</a> has dropped her 12th studio album, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-life-of-a-showgirl/\">The Life of a Showgirl</a>,” and the hottest topic among many online is the song “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/actually-romantic/\">Actually Romantic</a>.” The seventh track on the new album has led to widespread speculation that Swift is dissing fellow pop star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/charli-xcx/\">Charli xcx</a>. But how did we get here?</p>\n<p>\n\tThe two singers appeared to be on healthy ground last fall when Swift praised Charli’s songwriting in <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/charli-xcx-interview-brat-summer-fall-kamala-harris.html\" target=\"_blank\">a New York Magazine cover story </a>on Charli and her album, “Brat.” But now social media is convinced that Swift has her knives out for Charli on “Actually Romantic,” where Swift calls out a singer who bashed her as a “Boring Barbie” while on cocaine. This singer also congratulated one of Swift’s ex-boyfriends when he ghosted Swift. The internet is now wondering: are Swift and Charli feuding?\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHere’s everything we know about their relationship so far.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Charli Is an Opener on the Reputation Stadium Tour (2018)</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tFor all intents and purposes, Charli and Swift were on great terms in 2018 when Swift announced Charli and Camila Cabello would be the opening acts on the Reputation Stadium Tour. Charli performed at all dates of the tour from May to November of that year, totally more than 50 concerts, and she even joined Swift onstage with Cabello at serval stops to perform “Shake It Off” live together.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Charli Disses Swifties (2019)</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe first potential sign of bad blood between Charli and Swift came in <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/charli-xcx-interview/\" target=\"_blank\">an August 2019 Pitchfork feature,</a> which was published online shortly before Swift released the “Lover” album. Charli took a shot at Swift’s fans, ubiquitously known as Swifties, when she told the publication: “I’m really grateful that [Taylor] asked me on that tour. But as an artist, it kind of felt like I was getting up on stage and waving to 5-year-olds.” Swifties were not too thrilled.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Taylor, Charli and The 1975 (2023)</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tTaylor and Charli found themselves in the same orbit years later when they both were dating members of The 1975, the English pop rock band. Swift briefly dated lead singer Matty Healy starting around May 2023 while on The Eras Tour and right after her breakup to Joe Alwyn went public. Charli started dating drummer George Daniel a year prior, so naturally Taylor and Charli started crossing paths a lot more in summer 2023. Swift’s fling with Healy allegedly only lasted around two months, while Charli and Daniels got married this summer.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Charli Releases “Sympathy Is a Knife” on Her Album “Brat” (Summer 2024)</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tCharli dropped the album “Brat” in June 2024 and captured the pop culture zeitgeist as several of the songs found the singer getting brutally honest about her relationship to the music industry and to fellow female pop stars (see Lorde and “Girl So Confusing.”) By the time “Brat” was released, Swift’s relationship to Healy was long over and even inspired several songs off Swift’s album “The Tortured Poets Department,” which dropped in April before “Brat’s” summer release.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne song from “Brat” is titled “Sympathy Is a Knife” and is widely speculated to be about Swift, but the lyrics were not dissing whoever Charli was writing about. Instead, the song finds Charli being self-critical over how being in the orbit of a much famous singer (i.e. Swift) had negative effects on her mental health. As Charli sings: “This one girl taps my insecurities/Don’t know if it’s real or if I’m spiraling… I couldn’t even be her if I tried / I’m opposite, I’m on the other side.” If the song was about Swift, then it was all about criticizing Charli’s own delusions and insecurities and not Swift herself.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Swift Praises Charli’s Songwriting (Fall 2024)</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tCharli’s press blitz for “Brat” extended into the fall when she <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/charli-xcx-interview-brat-summer-fall-kamala-harris.html\" target=\"_blank\">graced the cover of New York Magazine</a>. The story published October 11, 2024 and included a quote from Swift that was highly complimentary of the “Brat” singer: “I’ve been blown away by Charli’s melodic sensibilities since I first heard ‘Stay Away’ in 2011. Her writing is surreal and inventive, always. She just takes a song to places you wouldn’t expect it to go, and she’s been doing it consistently for over a decade. I love to see hard work like that pay off.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd yet, signs of potential bad blood between the two were starting to be called out online. Matty Healy announced his engagement to model Gabbriette in June 2024, with Charli telling New York Magazine: “I’ve always quietly thought they’d be a good couple.” And on the day Swift shared a positive review of “The Tortured Poets Department” in April, Charli quote-tweeted it with the comment: “Everyone’s hype for the Sweat Tour!” Was Charli just being playful or was trouble brewing between the two pop stars? Social media speculation went into overdrive.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Swift Dances to Charli at the Grammy Awards (Winter 2025)</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tEven if there was some beef between Swift and Charli to close out 2024, you wouldn’t know by watching the 2025 Grammy Awards. The ceremony, held on Feb. 2, featured a high-energy performance from Charli that Swift was clearly a fan of given how rapturously Swift and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/music/news/charli-xcx-jack-antonoff-lainey-wilson-quavo-variety-hitmakers-1236242427/\">Margaret Qualley (who introduced Charli at <em>Variety’</em>s Hitmakers</a> event last year) <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@varietymagazine/video/7467053357623201070\" target=\"_blank\">were seen dancing </a>in the crowd while drinking champagne. The clip of Swift rocking out to Charli went viral across various social media platforms. Both Swift and Charli were nominated for album of the year at the Grammys, although Beyonce took home the prize for “Cowboy Carter.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Swift Releases “Actually Romantic” on Her Album “The Life of a Showgirl” (Fall 2025)</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIf Charli was only hinting at a potential beef with Swift in 2024, many people now think a feud between the two has all but been confirmed by Swift’s song “Actually Romantic,” which mentions whoever Swift is talking about “wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face.” That lyric alone has convinced many that Swift is obviously writing about Charli and “Sympathy Is a Knife.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe song <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/life-of-a-showgirl-best-lyrics-taylor-swift-1236537499/\">begins with the lyrics</a>: “I heard you call me ‘Boring Barbie’ when the coke’s got you brave / High-fived my ex and then you said you’re glad he ghosted me / Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face.” But then Swift reveals the full conceit of the song, which is how flattering and even arousing it is to hear about someone thinking about you constantly (even if for negative reasons).</p>\n<p>\n\tSwift explained the song in a track-by-track version of the album that’s streaming on Amazon Music (via <a href=\"https://www.eonline.com/news/1423341/taylor-swift-fans-think-new-song-shades-charli-xcx\" target=\"_blank\">E! News</a>), saying: “‘Actually Romantic’ is a song about realizing that someone else has kind of had a one-sided adversarial relationship with you that you didn’t know about. And all of a sudden they start doing too much, and they start letting you know that, actually, you’ve been living in their head rent free and you had no idea.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s presenting itself as them sort of resenting or having a problem with you, but taking that and you just accepting that as love,” Swift added. “Your just accepting it as attention and affection. How flattering that someone has made you such a big part of their reality and you didn’t even think about this. It’s actually pretty romantic if you really, really think about it.”<br /></p>\n</div>",

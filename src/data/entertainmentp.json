One player, dubbed the “Wingleader,” secretly ranks five cards pulled from across the first three Empyrean novels—Fourth Wing, Iron Flame and Onyx Storm—while the rest of the group, known as the “Iron Squad,” works together to guess the order. With categories spanning romance, rivalries, power struggles and fan-favorite riders, the set is designed to spark the kind of spirited debates already happening in book clubs and online fan forums. The first team to spell out PRIORITIES with earned cards wins.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“This game is for the readers who’ve stayed up way too late with these books and still want more,” Yarros said in announcing the release. “Priorities: Fourth Wing Edition is a way to dive back into the world with your favorite people and see just how well they really know you.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe bestselling romantasy book series, with a forthcoming Amazon adaptation in the works, is set inside the brutal world of Basgiath War College, where there is only one rule: graduate or die. Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was always expected to live a quiet life — but she’s sent on an entirely different path when her mother, a general in the military, orders her to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become dragon riders, the elite of Navarre.\n</p>\n<div><p>\n\tBuy the “Fourth Wing” card game <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9PXYTGQ?tag=variety0e8-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US&asc_source=web&asc_campaign=web&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2025%2Fshopping%2Fnews%2Ffourth-wing-card-game-buy-online-1236537542%2F\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and the bestselling book series <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Wing-Empyrean-Book-1/dp/B0BVDJ293G?crid=2JR0N0V3X6RL&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.EiOQBxySZI7jV617zicsBgks0iEaS5TNTZmpdzhhwX_gi04fyzE7CByOdvTrHvD3MnAuPVCZOgVx9heZHVeJ_WJjusPIpZLNGYxoMWJv3xLnBALmWfk0JJ2fdpLNdg5yGb73SXbywySoSamFyuEDjQxuN8XAXCifKM4uDWGkEVW7vb9sBvcU1zVwLGzkNxwUYzk0Pm9Y0T8Dvis0SLrEm76YIkXhlYPRIYeY-V09dGk.caaegmOa5gVDJEnQqK-zSSvRg8mp7IGU4PaSeftXcQA&dib_tag=se&keywords=fourth+wing&qid=1759459474&sprefix=fourth+wi%2Caps%2C142&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=vypinterest-20&linkId=7d9325aaf47483105dc2c1b4bd1bd7a3&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&asc_source=web&asc_campaign=web&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2025%2Fshopping%2Fnews%2Ffourth-wing-card-game-buy-online-1236537542%2F\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </p></div>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/eugenio-derbez/\">Eugenio Derbez</a> has been a bankable comedy superstar in Spanish-language markets for more than 30 years. He’s known in the U.S. for his crossover work in such series as Apple TV+’s “Acapulco” and his supporting role in the Oscar-winning “CODA.” </p>\n<p>\n\tAlong the way Derbez has raised a large family, and most of them have become celebrities in their own right. His three adult children have amassed huge social media followings, just like their patriarch. Now, Team Derbez is going all in on a family production company to harness the power of their collective social footprint of more than 180 million followers.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Derbez family has pacted with 3Pas Studios to launch <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/studio-drbz/\">Studio DRBZ</a>. The content banner will create original material for digital platforms with an eye on developing concepts and prototypes for movies, TV shows, live media, podcasts, e-commerce and more. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tDerbez already was a partner in 3Pas, which he founded in 2014 in tandem with producer Ben Odell, who  serves as CEO. 3Pas has produced such Eugenio Derbez-starrers as “Acapulco” and the 2023 coming of age indie film “Radical,” which had a strong run on the festival circuit. Javier Williams is a key player in his role as president of Spanish-language content for 3Pas. And the company also operates a busy Mexico-based production services unit dubbed Visceral.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Derbez family is accustomed to being in the spotlight as a unit thanks to the success of the unscripted reality series “De Viaje con los Derbez” that ran for six seasons on TelevisaUnivision’s Vix streamer in the U.S. and on Amazon Prime Video in Latin American markets.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tStudio DRBZ will be home to projects developed and produced by Derbez as well his wife, actress-singer Alessandra Rosaldo, and three adult children, Aislinn Derbez, José Eduardo Derbez and Vadhir Derbez. (The family also includes pre-teen Aitana Derbez, Eugenio’s daughter with Rosaldo.) </p>\n<p>\n\t“For years, our family has shared our lives and stories with audiences across Mexico, Latin America and the United States,” said Eugenio Derbez. “With Studio DRBZ, we’re taking the next step — building a home where our creativity can expand across every platform, from movies to digital-first series, always with our community at the center.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe social media followings of the Derbez family members give them a strong launch pad to reach Hispanic audiences in the U.S. and Latin America. The family members aim to work together and to develop projects on their own.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Studio DRBZ, Eugenio Derbez will serve as chairman while Odell steers as CEO. Williams will stay in his role as head of Spanish-language content and as CEO of Visceral. Leonardo Zimbrón is executive VP of feature films and Jordan Rubio, who is VP of comedy and family content. The company plans to appoint a leader for digital content soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe family’s impressive social stats, per the Studio DRBZ announcement: </p>\n<p>\n\t• Eugenio Derbez (90 million-plus followers) — Emmy and SAG Award winner, global comedy star, and one of the most bankable names in Spanish-language entertainment.</p>\n<p>\n\t• Aislinn Derbez (30 million) — Actress, entrepreneur and style/wellness influencer.</p>\n<p>\n\t• Vadhir Derbez (25 million) — Actor, singer and lifestyle creator.</p>\n<p>\n\t• José Eduardo Derbez (20 million) — Comedian and digital storyteller resonating with younger audiences.</p>\n<p>\n\t• Alessandra Rosaldo (15 million) — Singer, actress and TV host with a strong following around motherhood and everyday life.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Each of us has our own style, voice and audience — but when we come together, the impact multiplies,” the family said in a joint statement.</p>\n<p>\n\tOdell emphasized that the structure of Studio DRBZ was well suited to the way content is created and consumed in the social media age. During the past three years, the Derbez clan has driven 4.1 billion video views and 315 million engagements across multiple social media platforms, per the Studio DRBZ announcement.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“As media continues shifting toward digital-first consumption, Studio DRBZ is uniquely positioned to bridge traditional Hollywood storytelling with the immediacy, authenticity and community-driven power of social platforms,” Odell said.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>(Pictured top left to right: Aislinn Derbez, José Eduardo Derbez, Vadhir Derbez, Aitana Derbez, Eugenio Derbez and Alessandra Rosaldo)</em></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIndie U.S. distributor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/film-movement/\">Film Movement</a> has acquired North American rights to French-Tunisian director Erige Sehiri’s migrant drama “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/promised-sky/\">Promised Sky</a>” which looks at the lives of three undocumented Ivorian women in Tunisia and premiered this year in Un Certain Regard at Cannes.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Promised Sky” follows Marie, an Ivorian pastor and former journalist, who has lived in Tunisia for 10 years. Her home becomes a refuge for Naney, a young Ivorian mother seeking a better future, and Jolie, a strong-willed student carrying her family’s hopes. The arrival of a little orphan girl challenges their sense of solidarity in a tense social climate, revealing both their fragility and strength.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSehiri’s previous film, “Under the Fig Trees,” played in Cannes’ Directors’ Fortnight in 2022, and was selected to represent Tunisia at the 2023 Academy Awards.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFilm Movement, which released “Under the Fig Trees” in 2023, has acquired Sehiri’s latest film for North American release. They are planning a theatrical rollout in 2026, followed by release to all leading digital platforms and the home entertainment marketplace, according to a statement.  </p>\n<p>\n\tThe “Promised Sky” deal was announced by  Film Movement president Michael Rosenberg and Jennyfer Gautier, head of international sales at Paris-based Luxbox Films, which is handling world sales on the timely title. The film’s producers are Didar Domehri for Maneki Films and Sehiri for Henia Production. The co-producer is France’s Canal+.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Erige Sehiri has once again demonstrated her extraordinary ability to tell deeply human stories with warmth, nuance, and compassion,” said Rosenberg in the statement. “Promised Sky is a film that resonates far beyond its borders, shedding light on the resilience of those living in limbo and the unbreakable bonds of solidarity,” he added. “We’re honored to bring this powerful work to North American audiences.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety</em> critic Tomris Laffly in her<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/promised-sky-review-promis-le-ciel-1236398617/\"> “Promised Sky” review</a> praised the film saying that it “adds up to something greater than the sum of its parts, becoming a unique drama about marginalized African immigrant women fighting for their dignity and place not in Europe (the usual setting for many similarly themed films), but on their own continent, Africa.” </p>\n<p>\n\tThe “Promised Sky” acquisition adds to Film Movement’s growing slate, which includes Japanese auteur Chie Hayakawa’s “Renoir,” that launched from Cannes; Dominik Moll’s police thriller “Case 137,” also a Cannes title; and Chinese director Huo Meng’s Berlinale Silver Bear-winner “Living the Land.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tPatricia Routledge, best known for playing snobbish social-climber Hyacinth Bucket in beloved British sitcom “Keeping Up Appearances,” has died. She was 96. </p>\n<p>\n\t“We are deeply saddened to confirm the passing of Dame Patricia Routledge, who died peacefully in her sleep this morning surrounded by love,” her agent said in a statement to the PA Media news agency.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Even at 96-years old, Dame Patricia’s passion for her work and for connecting with live audiences never waned, just as new generations of audiences have continued to find her through her beloved television roles. She will be dearly missed by those closest to her and by her devoted admirers around the world.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBorn in the north of England near Liverpool, Routledge made a name for herself on stage in the U.K. and later the U.S., winning a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical in 1968 for “Darling of the Day,” following this up with an Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical for “Candide” 20 years later. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the actress and singer became best known for her performances in TV, especially her turn as the overbearing, flowery-dressed Bucket — which her character famously insisted was pronounced “Bouquet” — in “Keeping Up Appearances,” which ran from 1990 to 1995. </p>\n<p>\n\tDespite only running for five seasons, it would have a lasting legacy, and for a time was the most successful British show internationally. The comedy amassed huge audiences in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Ireland, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and in 2016 was named as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bbc/\">BBC</a> Worldwide’s most exported TV show ever. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 1991, Routledge won a British Comedy Award for her portrayal as Bucket, and she was later nominated for two BAFTA TV Awards in 1992 and 1993. </p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing on from “Keeping Up Appearances,” Routledge led crime drama series “Hetty Wainthropp Investigates,” about a retired woman who has a knack for solving crimes. It ran from 1996 to 1998. </p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2017, Routledge was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II for her services to entertainment and charity.</p>\n</div>",

Acosta, head of The Mediapro Studio U.S. & Canada. </p>\n<p>\n\t“We are thrilled to partner with Telemundo, a trusted leader in Spanish-language media, to create groundbreaking content that resonates deeply with Hispanic audiences in the U.S. and beyond.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Telemundo Studios, the pact builds on its core mandate of expanding Latino representation on screen. “Together, we will create content that amplifies and reflects Latino voices, while continuing to set new standards for top level production in the industry,” said Javier Pons, chief content officer and head of Telemundo Studios.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe deal aligns The Mediapro’s track record of global hits such as ‘The Head,’ “Iosi, the Regretful Spy” “Las Bravas” Season 2, “Consuelo” Season 2, “Intercambiadas” and breakout Mexican movie “Mesa de regalos,” with Telemundo’s own decades-long production expertise and its reach across broadcast, pay TV and streaming platforms. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tComing together, both companies are positioning themselves to capture a fast-growing demographic that represents a vital part of the U.S. media landscape.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe partnership will launch with a slate of projects already in development, with further announcements expected in the coming months.</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond features, the deal also signals opportunities for cross-platform storytelling that can travel across borders and formats.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs competition for Hispanic audiences intensifies among streamers and networks, the Mediapro-Telemundo alliance reflects a broader industry trend: Major players doubling down on culturally resonant content designed not only for Latino viewers in the U.S. but for global markets hungry for diverse stories.</p>\n</div>",

Karun</a>, and recent commercial successes that blend art-house sensibilities with mainstream appeal.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe initiative represents an evolution of the Kerala Film Market, which launched in 2023 as a knowledge-sharing forum featuring panels and masterclasses. Over two editions, the platform organically grew into a networking space where projects were pitched and cross-border collaborations formed. The original concept was developed by Karun, director of Cannes selections “Piravi,” “Swaham” and “Vanaprastham,” and former KSFDC chair.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The <a href=\"https://ifmk.in/\" target=\"_blank\">International Film Market of Kerala </a>marks a significant leap forward in our state’s cinematic journey,” said K. Madhu, veteran filmmaker and KSFDC chair. “IFMK will offer just that — a space where ideas meet opportunity, and where film professionals can engage with the global market on equal footing.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIFMK is designed as an integral component of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/international-film-festival-of-kerala/\">International Film Festival of Kerala</a>, one of India’s most artistically respected festivals. While IFFK celebrates cinema as a cultural force, IFMK adds a business dimension focused on co-production infrastructure, financing and market access.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“With the launch of IFMK, we are complementing that legacy by creating an industry arm that focuses on outcomes — on financing, distribution, and professional partnerships,” said Premkumar, actor and chairman of the Kerala State Chalachitra Academy, which is partnering on the initiative.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe market will feature several key components: a Project Market for pitching to producers, distributors and festivals; a Fine Cut Lab offering post-production mentorship from international advisors; Industry Talks on production trends and technology; a Video Library for films seeking distribution or festival exposure; and exhibition space for film commissions and service providers.</p>\n<p>\n\tLeena Khobragade, former director of Film Bazaar, south Asia’s largest project market, serves as consultant, bringing international industry expertise to the venture.</p>\n<p>\n\t“With IFMK, we are creating more than an event — we’re building infrastructure for long-term industry growth,” said Priyadarsanan P.S., KSFDC managing director. “This platform will help talents access global networks, find the right partners, and compete confidently in international markets.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“Every time I’m here I shed tears, I’m just so moved and so grateful to be part of this community.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you’re wondering why the Ivors Academy needs another awards ceremony, barely four months after its main event (the Ivor Novello Awards – aka the Ivors), well, as usual <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/raye/\">Raye</a> had the answers.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe British singer-songwriter is no stranger to the winner’s podium these days, of course — she was even <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/music/news/quavo-jelly-roll-raye-variety-hitmakers-event-1236193601/\">honored for her advocacy for songwriters at last year’s <em>Variety</em> Hitmakers </a>event. But it is what she did with her platform at the BRITs and the Ivors that put her back in the spotlight at the inaugural Ivors Academy Honours Ceremony on Thursday, held at London’s Intercontinental Park Lane hotel.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHer tireless advocacy for songwriters to be better compensated for their craft recently won a major victory, when — as part of the U.K. government’s streaming remuneration working group — the three major labels agreed to pay a £75 ($100) per diem fee and expenses for songwriters attending their writing sessions, answering a call she first made in her Ivors acceptance speech in 2024.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I don’t want to take more credit than is due,” she said of that triumph as she collected an award for her advocacy. “I know I’m being extremely annoying in all of my speeches, but… as long as God gives me a microphone to accept [an award] on a stage, I promise to keep fighting the good fight.</p>\n<p>\n\t“A really important next step is that we get together to eliminate the shadows in our contracts and the grey areas in which manipulation is allowed to occur,” she added, calling for writers to “stop fighting against each other and turn the good fight to the record labels that are going to have to understand that we’re not going to stop until songwriters are correctly compensated for their songs. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We need transparency,” she stressed, before quipping: “I’m pissing everyone off and I’m really not trying to do that – I just care about these things.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jon-Platt-L-Sir-Richard-Branson-R.jpg 3186w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jon-Platt-L-Sir-Richard-Branson-R.jpg?resize=103,150 103w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jon-Platt-L-Sir-Richard-Branson-R.jpg?resize=206,300 206w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jon-Platt-L-Sir-Richard-Branson-R.jpg?w=703\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jon-platt/\">Jon Platt</a> (left) with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/richard-branson/\">Richard Branson</a>. They didn’t call him “Big Jon” back in the day for nothing… (Photo by Dave Benett/Getty Images for The Ivors Academy)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDave Benett/Getty Images for The Ivors Academy\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tAnd this new addition to the Ivors programme, introduced by Academy bosses Roberto Neri and Tom Gray, is very much for people who care about those things – specifically compensation and respect for songwriters. Or, as another of the night’s winners, Sony Music Publishing CEO and chairman Jon Platt called it, people who go around “pissing people off and loving every minute of it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn his speech, Platt noted that he declines most awards that are offered to him but that, “When a songwriter organization reaches out, it’s a bit different. It’s not just an award, it’s an honor to be recognized by an Academy that fights so hard on behalf of songwriters.”</p>\n<p>\n\tPlatt – whose award was presented by Beyoncé co-writer Carla Marie Williams – was one of the few high-profile American execs to make the trip over (although he gave it a strong endorsement, noting: “Every time you go to an Ivors event, you think, ‘How can it top what you saw the last time?’ But already tonight is doing that”), but there was a strong turnout from UK publishers, songwriters, producers, labels, management companies and trade bodies to support the new event.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn recent years, the Ivors have transitioned from cosy industry bash to a high-profile magnet for A-list talent: U2, Bruce Springsteen, Brandon Flowers and Charli XCX all attended this year’s event.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut aside from Raye, artist-poet Kae Tempest and a hilarious presentation speech from Alison Moyet, the Ivors Academy Honours concentrated mainly on those behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo other winners included Catherine Manners, founder of classical music agency and publisher Manners McDade, and Sir Chris Bryant MP, one of the drivers of that government working group, who declared: “Every single songwriter is a miracle worker – and miracle workers should be paid properly”.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere were emotional scenes as a posthumous award for SESAC VP of international John Sweeney, who passed away earlier this year, was collected by his daughter May; while MOBO Group CEO and founder Kanya King, earned a standing ovation as she read a letter to her younger self and talked of her “challenging year”, having been diagnosed with cancer.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe headline act, however, also provided the light relief as Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, ran through a greatest hits of anecdotes from his time in the music industry, including fighting an obscenity laws court case over the Sex Pistols’ “Never Mind the Bollocks” album; passing out while smoking dope with Peter Tosh; and helping a naked Keith Richards avoid an angry, gun-toting husband whose wife had been dallying with the Rolling Stones guitarist.</p>\n<p>\n\tBranson’s award was presented by one of the acts he signed to his Virgin Records label, Peter Gabriel, who spoke affectionately of Branson’s “indelible impression on music and on the way music is made both here and around the world – by supporting the new, the rebellious and the outsiders, Virgin helped shaped British and then the world’s music”.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We had a blast with our time in the music industry,” Branson told Variety ahead of the ceremony. “We were there at such a great time, when an independent record company could sign a band like Culture Club or the Sex Pistols and make a real difference.”</p>\n<p>\n\tVirgin began as a curated mail order retail business (“So the people who were buying the music knew that the people selling the music knew what they were talking about”), before expanding into the Virgin Megastores chain. He then launched recording studios and a record label before later forays into radio (Virgin Radio) and the live business (the V Festival).</p>\n<p>\n\tIn every sector, he disrupted the established order, no more so than when he built the independent Virgin Records off the back of Mike Oldfield’s mega-selling “Tubular Bells” album.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We didn’t deliberately think, ‘How can we be different?’” he said, in the bar of the Shoreditch branch of one of his latest ventures, Virgin Hotels. “We were just young – we were the same age as our artists and we did it our way! We were having a lot of fun and we quite enjoyed it if the establishment attacked us for signing the Sex Pistols, or prosecuted us for the word ‘bollocks’ – it just helped build the reputation of Virgin. People like the Rolling Stones, David Bowie and Janet Jackson signed to us because we took on the establishment. We put the artists on the map and therefore put Virgin on the map.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBranson sold Virgin Records to EMI in 1992 (“A gut-wrenching day for us all”) and confesses he no longer keeps up with the day-to-day minutiae of the record industry, or even the fate of the Virgin music brand, which lives on under Universal Music.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I know the artists are having a tough time,” he said. “Some of the record companies seem to be doing very well but sadly it doesn’t seem to have those independent [companies]. When we were building our label, there was also Chrysalis, Jive, Island – it was a very exciting time for artists having all those independent companies competing and willing to step in when a major company didn’t. It sounds like that’s been lost somewhere today.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, despite the thrill of being amongst many old friends and colleagues at the Ivors Academy Honours ceremony, he said he doesn’t miss the music industry.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’d be a sad person if I said I missed anything, because my life has been so full,” he said. “I have massive happy memories from the days we were in the music industry, but I’m not somebody that will dwell on the past – I just look positively forward to the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I don’t think it’s any less fun running some of the other companies,” he added. “But there was something about the music industry, it had a little more of the icing on the cake.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that serves as the perfect description of the Academy’s latest venture: The Ivors may remain the crème de la crème of songwriter awards ceremonies, but the Ivors Academy Honours were well worth the extra slice.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump bought at least $500,000 worth of bonds in both Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery within the two weeks following the two companies’ deal, under which Netflix is to acquire WB’s studios and streaming businesses.\n\n\tAccording to a financial disclosure form released Friday by the White House, Trump bought between $250,001 and $500,000 of Netflix bonds on two dates, Dec. 12 on Dec. 16. He also bought the same range of bonds for Discovery Communications (a WBD subsidiary) on those same dates. The Trump financial disclosure covered transactions spanning mid-November to late December.\n\t\n\n\tOn Dec. 5, Netflix and WBD announced a deal with an $82.7 billion enterprise deal. Under those terms, the streaming giant would acquire WB’s studios, HBO and HBO Max, and its games group — but not any of WBD’s TV networks, which would be spun off into a new entity, Discovery Global, to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders in Q3 of 2026. \n\n\n\tThe financial disclosures for Trump, released through the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, show that most of his acquisitions were municipal bonds from cities, local school districts, utilities and hospitals. He also bought bonds from other corporations including SiriusXM, Boeing, GM, Macy’s, Occidental Petroleum and Whirlpool.\n\n\tAccording to the White House, Trump’s financial portfolio is independently managed by third-party financial institutions — and neither Trump nor any member of his family has any ability to direct, influence or provide input regarding how the portfolio is invested, Reuters reported.\n\n\tIn December, Trump met with Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos at the White House to discuss the Warner Bros. Discovery deal. Trump, speaking last month with reporters on the red carpet of the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington, D.C., said Netflix’s deal to acquire Warner Bros. studios and streaming business will require a review, and said, “I’ll be involved in that decision.” He also said the market share of a combined Netflix with WB and HBO Max “could be a problem.”\n\t\n\n\tAlso last month, Trump said that as part of “any deal” for WBD, CNN should be sold as part of an overall deal or sold separately. “I think I think CNN should be sold because I think the people that are running CNN right now” are “either corrupt or incompetent,” he said. Trump said he didn’t want the current CNN management to be rewarded by being allowed to continue running the network “with money” from a deal.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Netflix and WBD are facing pressure from David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance, which is waging a hostile takeover bid and is trying to convince WBD shareholders that its $30/share offer is superior to Netflix’s terms. Paramount has sued Warner Bros. Discovery, seeking to compel it to produce financial info including how it is valuing the Discovery Global spin-off, said it will initiate a proxy war to install directors on WBD’s board amenable to its offer.\n\n\tTrump, asked a White House briefing on Dec. 8 if he was in favor of Paramount’s rival bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, said, “I don’t know enough about it,” saying he had to look at how each proposed deal would impact market share for Netflix and Paramount Skydance. He added, “I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere’s an exorcism scheduled at the box office for spring 2027. \n\n\tMike Flanagan‘s “The Exorcist” movie, starring Oscar nominee Scarlett Johansson and “Hamnet” breakout Jacobi Jupe, is dated for March 12, 2027, Universal announced Friday. The film was once expected to hit theaters this March, but production was delayed.\n\n\tFlanagan (“The Fall of the House of Usher,” “Doctor Sleep,” The Life of Chuck”) is writing, directing and producing the newest installment for Universal and Blumhouse-Atomic Monster, which has been described as a “radical new take” on the iconic horror property. \n\t\n\n\tThe original “Exorcist,” directed by William Friedkin, follows a mother (Ellen Burstyn) who hires two Catholic priests to perform an exorcism on her demonically possessed 12-year-old (Linda Blair). Released in 1973, the film was a critical and commercial hit, grossing $441 million globally and garnering 10 Oscar nominations. \n\n\tIn 2021, Universal spent a staggering $400 million to buy the rights for a new “Exorcist” trilogy. 2023’s “The Exorcist: Believer” brought back Burstyn as Chris MacNeil, earning $136 million at the global box office. Flanagan’s film will be set in the same universe as the 1973 film; however, it is not a sequel to “Believer.”\n\n\t“The Exorcist” is produced by David Robinson, Jason Blum and Flanagan. Alexandra Magistro and Ryan Turek serve as executive producers. The movie is a Blumhouse-Atomic Monster and Morgan Creek Entertainment production, in association with Flanagan’s Red Room Pictures.\n\n\tThis film marks the fourth collaboration for Flanagan and Blumhouse; he wrote and directed 2013’s “Oculus,” 2016’s “Hush” and 2016’s “Ouija: Origin of Evil.” Flanagan’s latest film, 2024’s “The Life of Chuck,” won the TIFF audience award.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s raining pilot orders at NBC.\n\n\tThe network will take a chance on two new drama projects, titled “Puzzled” and “What the Dead Know.” This caps off a week in which NBC announced six pilot orders for the 2026 season.\n\n\tFrom “Charmed” and “Sleepy Hollow” writer Joey Falco, “Puzzled” is based on the “Puzzle Master” books by Danielle Trussoni. “After barely escaping a tragic fire, once promising college athlete Mike Brink is transformed by a traumatic brain injury that gives him the unique ability to see the world in an unexpected way and helps him solve crimes with local police,” according to the logline. Jordan Cerf executive produces alongside Falco, and Trussoni is a producer. The studio is Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group.\n\t\n\n\tLegendary “Law & Order” creator Dick Wolf serves as an executive producer on the other pilot, “What the Dead Know,” from Beth Rinehart (“FBI: Most Wanted,” “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit”). The series is based on the memoir by former New York City medical examiner Barbara Butcher. Per the logline: “Death Investigator Ava Ledger is really good with dead bodies. It’s the living that give her trouble.” The show follows Ava as she teams up with the NYPD to solve their toughest cases. The executive producers include Tom Thayer, Peter Jankowski and Anastasia Puglisi; Co-EPs are Kevin Plunkett, Rebecca McGill and Butcher. Wolf Entertainment produces, and Universal Television is the studio.\n\n\n\tEarlier on Friday, NBC announced a pilot order for a detective comedy from “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” co-creator Dan Goor and executive producer Luke Del Tredici. On Thursday, the network announced a drama pilot from Dean Georgaris and John Fox, inspired by the real-life FBI research of Dr. Ann Burgess. And earlier this week, the network announced a drama pilot order from Josh Safran, Jenna Bush Hager and Ben Spector called “Protection,” about a family of law enforcement agents becoming the target of a mysterious assassin. Plus, NBC gave a pilot order to a “contemporary update” on “The Rockford Files” from Mike Daniels (“Sons of Anarchy”).\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount hopes a new sequel to “Paranormal Activity” will get the summer of 2027 off to a spooky start. The studio will release the latest film in the found-footage horror franchise on May 21, 2027. It currently lacks a title.\n\n\tJames Wan and Jason Blum will produce the picture through their company, Blumhouse-Atomic Monster, which is co-financing with Paramount. Oren Peli, the director of the 2007 original, will also produce through his Solana Films banner. The first film was shot for $15,000, made a stir on the festival circuit and then was acquired by Paramount, which spent $200,000 more to create a new ending. When it opened in theaters in 2009, it went on to earn $194 million globally, becoming one of the most profitable films in history.\n\t\n\n\tThere have been seven films in the series, including “Paranormal Activity 2” (2010), “Paranormal Activity 3” (2011), “Paranormal Activity 4” (2012), “The Marked Ones” (2014), “The Ghost Dimension” (2015), and “Next of Kin” (2021). The franchise has grossed over $900 million at the worldwide box office.\n\n\n\tThe new “Paranormal Activity” is directed by Ian Tuason. Plot details are being kept under wraps, but they probably involve something demonic and creepy (we’re just guessing!). Paramount announced plans for the sequel shortly after the company was acquired last year by Skydance Media, which has been actively trying to bolster the studio’s moribund film slate.\n\n\tThe latest “Paranormal” will face off against “Bad Fairies,” a Warner Bros. animated family comedy that’s geared to a very different demographic. The next weekend brings “Star Wars: Starfighter,” Shawn Levy and Ryan Gosling’s attempt to revitalize the space opera saga for the big screen.\n\t\n\n\tWan is the director of “Saw” and “The Conjuring.” Blum has produced such horror hits as “Get Out” and “The Purge.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatt Damon and Ben Affleck continued their press tour for Netflix’s “The Rip” with an interview on “The Joe Rogan Experience,” where the eponymous podcast host and Damon reflected on cancel culture in Hollywood. The Oscar nominee said some canceled actors probably would’ve preferred to gone to jail and serve time than deal with the never-ending turmoil that comes with “cancel culture.”\n\n\tRogan described being “canceled” as “this idea that one thing you said or one thing you did, and now we’re going to exaggerate that to the fullest extent and cast you out of civilization for life” (via The Daily Beast).\n\t\n\n\t“In perpetuity,” Damon replied about the forever nature of cancel culture. “Because I bet some of those people would have preferred to go to jail for 18 months or whatever, and then come out and say, ‘I paid my debt. Like, we’re done. Like, can we be done?’ The thing about that getting kind of excoriated, publicly like that, it just never ends. And it’s the first thing that… you know, it just will follow you to the grave.”\n\n\n\tDamon knows a thing or two about surviving internet outrage. He infamously combated cancel culture in 2021 when an interview he gave to the The Sunday Times earned backlash due to the actor saying he had stopped using the F-slur only “months ago” because his daughter wrote him a “treatise” on “how that word is dangerous.” Damon clarified in a statement to Variety soon after that he never used the word in his “personal life” and does not “use slurs of any kind.” He also affirmed that he understands why the interview “led many to assume the worst.”\n\t\n\n\t“During a recent interview, I recalled a discussion I had with my daughter where I attempted to contextualize for her the progress that has been made – though by no means completed – since I was growing up in Boston and, as a child, heard the word ‘f*g’ used on the street before I knew what it even referred to,” Damon wrote in a statement. “I explained that that word was used constantly and casually and was even a line of dialogue in a movie of mine as recently as 2003;  she in turn expressed incredulity that there could ever have been a time where that word was used unthinkingly. To my admiration and pride, she was extremely articulate about the extent to which that word would have been painful to someone in the LGBTQ+ community regardless of how culturally normalized it was. I not only agreed with her but thrilled at her passion, values and desire for social justice.”\n\n\tDamon continued, “I have never called anyone ‘f****t’ in my personal life and this conversation with my daughter was not a personal awakening. I do not use slurs of any kind,” Damon continued. “I have learned that eradicating prejudice requires active movement toward justice rather than finding passive comfort in imagining myself ‘one of the good guys’. And given that open hostility against the LGBTQ+ community is still not uncommon, I understand why my statement led many to assume the worst. To be as clear as I can be, I stand with the LGBTQ+ community.”\n\n\tDespite the controversy, Damon’s career was not impacted in any major way and he went on to have starring roles in “Air,” “Oppenheimer” and more. He’ll be back on the big screen later this year in the lead role of Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey.”\n\n\tWatch Damon and Affleck’s full interview on “The Joe Rogan Experience” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn “Night Patrol,” now in theaters via RLJE Films and Shudder, two cops (Jermaine Fowler and Justin Long) work to protect the Los Angeles streets. But when Long’s officer is inducted into an all-white vampire cop squad, violence escalates in wild ways.\n\n\tRyan Prows, who directed the film and wrote it with Shaye Ogbonna, Tim Cairo and Jake Gibson, blends comedy, drama and real-life anxieties into this horror-action movie. Prows spoke with Variety about how modern concerns about race and policing ended up in a fantastical film.\n\t\n\n\t“How do you talk about something very current and real and scary?” he said. “If you’re making a horror film, but it’s what really scares you, you don’t want a soapbox. That’s the cool thing about genre and horror: You can still couch that in having fun and having the release valves in there. Hopefully, it’s a fun ride and you care about the characters and the tension is there, but afterwards you can grab a coffee and talk about what the movie meant or deeper stuff. But I make sure it’s still character first, then scenario, and obviously we’ve built this bigger point that we want to talk about, but not poke you in the eye with it.”\n\n\n\tFor a movie that throws a lot of complex ideas at audiences, Prows knew he needed a cast willing to push themselves and work in the film’s dark vibe. To achieve this, he mashed up a group of unique actors (including Long, Fowler, CM Punk and Dermot Mulroney) and musicians (like Freddie Gibbs, YG and Flying Lotus).\n\n\t“You have these colliding forces from all these different worlds,” Prows says. “The strength of the film is that they’re coming from opposite ends. When we were casting and building out the film, the big thing to me was, ‘Are you committed?’ Everyone was game to show up and ready to throw in. Those are the folks you want to surround yourself with and bring into the film.”\n\t\n\n\tUltimately, all of these game artists were able to create a genre-shifting movie that aims to entertain and provoke discussion. Yet Prows says finding the right tone and tightroping genres was an exercise in trial and error.\n\n\t“We’re writing the script, and it’s like, ‘Okay, we’re forcing the joke here a little too much,’ or maybe, ‘This feels a little too dry,’ or, ‘We’re kind of missing the mark here,'” he says. “But there’s not a big wide berth between the most heinous stuff in your life and when you’re laughing at someone who tripped and split their pants or whatever goofy shit. To me, that’s life.\n\n\t“I think it also helps when you have no clue where the movie’s heading,” Prows continues. “As a filmgoer, I’m always excited about the ‘Wow, that did not end where I thought that was going to!'”\n\n\tWatch the “Night Patrol” trailer below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs of 5 p.m. PT, Oscar nomination voting is officially closed.\n\n\tMultiple conversations with Academy voters all throughout this week have revealed a race far more unpredictable than the pundits’ consensus suggests. While some categories appear locked, others are poised for the kind of upheaval we haven’t seen since 2003, when “The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King” dominated, but nominations surprised across multiple categories, such as Keisha Castle-Hughes, Samantha Morton, Djimon Hounsou, Shohreh Aghdashloo and Marcia Gay Harden, along with a rare lone director nomination for another Brazilian auteur, Fernando Meirelles).\n\t\n\n\tHere are some of the revelations learned this week from voters:\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe “F1” factor\t\n\n\tJoseph Kosinski’s “F1” from Apple Original Films is very well-liked among voters and feels like a viable entry in the best picture race. The old Academy guard loves it. Voters repeatedly describe it as “great” and “good old-school entertainment,” the kind of movie that could easily claim one of the 10 best picture slots despite a solid, albeit not overtly passionate, critical reception. Don’t underestimate the power of the older voters who built this industry. This Brad Pitt and Damson Idris vehicle could zoom into the race, also given it has support to land three tech noms such as film editing, sound and visual effects and mimic a previous contender like “Ford v Ferrari” (2019).\n\n\t“I fucking love that movie,” one anonymous voter of the Producers Branch says.\n\n\tThink of it like “comfort food” with AMPAS members.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeon\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe International Film Split\t\n\n\tThe international enthusiasm is genuine, but it’s also fractured. Neon has flooded the zone with non-English-language films, creating an unexpected problem: vote splitting.\n\t\n\n\tNorway’s “Sentimental Value,” Brazil’s “The Secret Agent,” South Korea’s “No Other Choice” and France’s “It Was Just an Accident” all have aspirations beyond the international feature category, particularly in best picture. More importantly, they are vying for attention from voters who frankly don’t watch as many movies as industry insiders assume.\n\n\t“Sentimental Value” is undoubtedly the priority watch among the titles, sailing toward multiple nominations, including best picture, possibly director, and three or four acting nods. But here’s the revelation that matters: “It Was Just an Accident,” while admired and respected, may not have the broad support to crack picture, director or screenplay. Some conversations with voters also suggest it could be one of the big snubs of the day, including in international feature, where the race is surprisingly competitive.\n\n\t“That movie [‘It Was Just an Accident’] never came up in my algorithm,” one voter admits. “I don’t know what that is.”\n\n\tTunisia’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab” has considerable support. Also watch for “Kukoho” from Japan, “The President’s Cake” from Iraq, Switzerland’s “Late Shift,” Taiwan’s “Left Handed Girl” (co-written by last year’s four-time Oscar winner Sean Baker) and Germany’s “Sound of Falling.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“One Battle After Another“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett C\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhy the surplus rule could decide the director race.\t\n\n\tThis year’s director race may be decided less by passion and more by mathematics.\n\n\tUnder the Academy’s preferential nomination system, voters rank their choices. Once ballots are cast, a “magic number” — the quota required to secure a nomination — is calculated. For most categories, that number is determined by dividing the total ballots by six and adding one. For the best picture category, it’s the total ballots divided by 11, plus one.\n\n\tHere’s where the surplus rule comes in.\n\n\tIf a contender receives significantly more votes than needed to hit that quota, those extra votes are not discarded. Instead, they are redistributed — at a reduced, fractional value — to the voter’s second choice (or third, if the second choice is already safe). In best picture, this redistribution is triggered when a film receives 10% more than the quota; in other categories, it’s triggered at 20%.\n\t\n\n\tThe goal is to prevent wasted votes and reward consensus.\n\n\tThis is why Paul Thomas Anderson’s strength could quietly reshape the director lineup beneath him. If Anderson overwhelmingly clears the quota (which many think he might), his surplus votes could be redistributed across secondary choices — and those choices are not uniform. Some Anderson voters lean toward Josh Safdie, others toward Guillermo del Toro, Joachim Trier or Ryan Coogler.\n\n\t“I love Guillermo,” one voter declares. “I’ll vote for him every time, no matter what.”\n\n\tI have found that a “One Battle After Another” voter tends to be a “Marty Supreme” voter, but what is clear is that loving “One Battle” does not automatically translate to voting for Safdie. That fragmentation makes the director race unusually fluid and dangerously close.\n\n\tThis may be one of the tightest director lineups in years.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsabrina lantos\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucky number seven in best actor, but which will be the luckier five?\t\n\n\tBest actor appears to be a genuine toss-up between Timothée Chalamet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ethan Hawke, Michael B. Jordan, Wagner Moura, Jesse Plemons and a potential surprise in Joel Edgerton for “Train Dreams.”\n\n\tThe key factor isn’t always the performance itself but the movie’s overall strength and what I call “coattail votes.” If Emma Stone ranks high among best actress voters, Jesse Plemons benefits from voters who put both on their ballots. Ethan Hawke enjoys similar advantages, given his popularity within the Actors Branch and his film’s likely original screenplay nomination (and even a potential surprise in best picture), which could even help it snag the last best picture slot.\n\n\t“That is my favorite movie of the year,” one artisan branch member tells Variety about Richard Linklater’s “Blue Moon.” “I don’t know how you don’t vote for Ethan Hawke and Andrew Scott.”\n\n\tWagner Moura won the Golden Globe for best actor (drama) at the perfect moment. I know many feel like his trajectory (along with the film) is mimicking Fernanda Torres and “I’m Still Here” last season. However, based on current voter sentiment, Moura feels far more vulnerable than Torres did at this stage.\n\n\tMichael B. Jordan in “Sinners” has landed all the essential nominations he needs, but I would be lying if I didn’t say I won’t feel secure about his inaugural Oscar bid until the names are read. Based on the feedback from voters and strategists, he seems to be in.\n\t\n\n\tThen there’s Joel Edgerton for “Train Dreams,” whose support may have quietly grown if the film overperforms down the ballot.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Bugonia”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBest Actress is the category most likely to implode\t\n\n\tBest actress has the most potential for a complete facelift. I feel secure declaring only one lock: Jessie Buckley for “Hamnet.”\n\n\tEmma Stone (“Bugonia”) has entered what I’m casually referring to as her “Cate Blanchett-era” — a phase in which her respect and love carry enormous weight, even without having to campaign. Renate Reinsve (“Sentimental Value”) benefits from international support and overlaps with voters backing Stellan Skarsgård and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas.\n\n\tKate Hudson (“Song Sung Blue”) is walking into next week with The Actor Awards and Golden Globe nominations, along with the support of her very well-liked parents, Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. The legendary Hollywood couple have been stumping for her the past few weeks and have helped make her a viable contender.\n\n\tThen there’s Chase Infiniti from “One Battle After Another,” the newest and least well-known name of the group. She could suffer a shocking miss that would mimic Richard Gere in “Chicago” or Joseph Fiennes in “Shakespeare in Love,” only to be forgotten despite being in the best picture winner.\n\n\tThat leaves a couple of potential candidates whose names came up with a few voters, such as Amanda Seyfried (“The Testament of Ann Lee”), Tessa Thompson (“Hedda”), and maybe even Eva Victor (“Sorry, Baby”).\n\n\t“Even though I didn’t really like the movie,” one voter say regarding “The Testament of Ann Lee” and her performance in Mona Fastvold’s drama, “I thought Amanda was astounding, and I haven’t seen a better performance this year.”\n\n\tLong story short, I don’t know where we end up on this one. It’s easy to follow the tea leaves. It’s harder to pick out potential cracks that could emerge.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDocumentary and international races are a trap.\t\n\n\tDocumentary Feature remains one of the most unpredictable categories, with voters acknowledging a pattern of snubbing presumed frontrunners. Admired films like “The Perfect Neighbor,” “The Alabama Solution,” or “2000 Meters to Andriivka” may still be vulnerable, particularly with an increasingly international voting body.\n\t\n\n\tInternational Feature is just as treacherous. Beyond the expected titles, there is genuine enthusiasm for films from Tunisia, Japan, Iraq, Taiwan, Germany and Switzerland — several of which voters describe as personal discoveries rather than consensus picks.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGwyneth Paltrow in “Marty Supreme”\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSupporting Categories: Safe and Surprising\t\n\n\tProbable supporting actor noms include Benicio del Toro and Sean Penn from “One Battle After Another,” Jacob Elordi from “Frankenstein,” Paul Mescal from “Hamnet,” and Stellan Skarsgård from “Sentimental Value.” Andrew Scott for “Blue Moon” has support but no clear path to replacing anyone. Watch for Miles Caton from “Sinners” or a Delroy Lindo surprise, similar to the Judd Hirsch/Paul Dano swap we saw with “The Fabelmans.”\n\n\tSupporting actresses feel safer with Amy Madigan (“Weapons”), Teyana Taylor (“One Battle After Another”) and Wunmi Mosaku (“Sinners”) the most likely to score nominations. “Sentimental Value” discovery Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas is most viable from her film, while Elle Fanning may narrowly miss (yet again) after last year’s snub for “A Complete Unknown.”\n\n\tAriana Grande for “Wicked: For Good” feels solid given her Globe, SAG and BAFTA shortlist. If there’s a surprise, Odessa A’zion (“Marty Supreme”) from the SAG lineup could appear, or even her co-star Gwyneth Paltrow as a replacement nominee, given her Oscar-winning status, much like Judi Dench replaced Caitriona Balfe from “Belfast.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Hamnet”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe artisans have the wildcards\t\n\n\t“Sinners” could make history with its nominations totals, especially if it picks up two original song nominations for “I Lied to You” and “Last Time (I Seen the Sun).” Netflix’s “Train Dreams” might score in score or song given the love for the movie, but did enough voters get to it in time? “Wicked: For Good” could emulate “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” with an acting nomination and a couple of tech nods, and the Stephen Schwartz factor is something to consider for music categories.\n\n\t“Hamnet” missed both the American Society of Cinematographers and the British Society of Cinematographers nominations, which could signal a potential miss on Oscar morning. Meanwhile, Darius Khondji’s legendary status helps “Marty Supreme” as a potential for cinematography.\n\t\n\n\tJames Vanderbilt’s “Nuremberg” has considerable support that many aren’t currently clocking. That could translate into nominations for costume design, original score, adapted screenplay, and perhaps even picture.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSo what does it look like on Oscar nomination morning?\t\n\n\tTwo potentials are out there.\n\n\tIt’s business as usual. Go with the precursor clues, and you’ll likely score 80% in your predictions.\n\n\tOr…\n\n\tWe could be heading for a 2003-style upset year. That year, despite “The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King” dominating, we saw Fernando Meirelles nominated for his beloved Brazilian film “City of God,” Jude Law nominated for best actor for “Cold Mountain” after missing SAG, and a complete upheaval in the best actress category. Charlize Theron and Diane Keaton were joined by Naomi Watts for “21 Grams,” Keisha Castle-Hughes (who switched from supporting to lead for “Whale Rider”) and Samantha Morton for “In America” with zero precursor support.\n\n\tThose nominations replaced presumed locks like Scarlett Johansson (campaigning in supporting but kept appearing in lead categories for “Lost in Translation”), Evan Rachel Wood for “Thirteen,” and Nicole Kidman for “Cold Mountain,” coming right after her Oscar win for “The Hours.”\n\n\tVariety’s final predictions drop next week before nominations are announced Jan. 22. \n\n\tBased on what voters are actually saying, chaos feels inevitable. Below are five of the most interesting best picture ballots that were shared with me by anonymous Oscar voters.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©20th Century Studios/Courtesy\n\t\n\n\n\n\tVoter #1 (Artisan Branch Member)\n\n\n“Blue Moon”\n“Train Dreams”\n“Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere”\n“Marty Supreme”\n“Nuremberg”\n“One Battle After Another”\n“Wicked: For Good”\n“Ella McCay”\n“Hamnet”\n“Nouvelle Vague”\n\n\n\n\n\tVoter #2 (Acting Branch Voter)\n\n\tActor in a Leading Role\n\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, “One Battle After Another”\nTimothée Chalamet, “Marty Supreme”\nJesse Plemons, “Bugonia”\nHugh Jackman, “Song Sung Blue”\nGeorge Clooney, “Jay Kelly”\n\n\n\n\tActress in a Leading Role\n\n\nKate Hudson, “Song Sung Blue”\nRose Byrne, “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”\nJennifer Lawrence, “Die My Love”\nEmma Stone, “Bugonia”\nAriana Grande, “Wicked: For Good”\n\n\n\n\tVoter #3: (Producers Branch Voter)\n\n\n“Sinners”\n“Wake Up Dead Man”\n“Weapons”\n“Hamnet”\n“Sentimental Value”\n“F1”\n“Frankenstein”\n“Rental Family”\n“Warfare”\n“Marty Supreme”\n\n\n\n\n\tVoter #4 (Costume Branch)\n\n\n“Nouvelle Vague”\n“Nuremberg”\n“Sinners”\n“Bugonia”\n“Frankenstein”\n\n\n\n\n\tVoter #5 (Executives Branch)\n\n\n“Train Dreams”\n“Bugonia”\n“One Battle After Another”\n“Sinners”\n“Marty Supreme”\n“The Lost Bus”\n“Sentimental Value”\n“A House of Dynamite”\n“Black Bag”\n“The Secret Agent”\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tKianna Underwood, who appeared on the last season of Nickelodeon‘s “All That,” has been identified by. multiple media sources as the victim of a hit-and-run accident Friday morning in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brownsville. The NYPD confirmed that a female victim was pronounced dead at the scene. She was 33.\n\n\tA sedan struck Underwood when she was crossing the street just before 7 a.m. at Pitkin and Mother Gaston Blvd., and she was then dragged for nearly two blocks, according to TMZ. No arrests have been made in the hit-and-run accident. \n\t\n\n\tUnderwood appeared on seven episodes of the popular sketch comedy “All That” in 2005 with stars Amanda Bynes, Nick Cannon and Kenan Thompson, and also appeared in Nickelodeon’s “Little Bill.” On the animated series “Little Bill,” created by Bill Cosby, she voiced Fuchsia Glover, the cousin of the main character, appearing in 23 episodes between 1999 and 2004. \n\n\n\t“All That” is a Nickelodeon children’s television series that ran from 1994 to 2005, featuring original short comedic sketches and weekly musical guests aimed toward a young audience. The show frequented pop culture parodies, performed by various child and teen actors. \n\n\t“Little Bill” was based on the “Little Bill” book series written by Crosby, and focused on 5-year-old “Little” Bill Glover in Philadelphia as he moved through everyday life with a fantastical imagination. \n\n\tBorn in New York City, Underwood also appeared in Nancy Savoca’s comedy “The 24-Hour Woman” in 1999. The indie film starred Rosie Perez, Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Patti LuPone. She also provided voiceovers for an animated TV movie “Santa, Baby” in 2001.\n\t\n\n\tShe went on to tour with the musical “Hairspray.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers from the series premiere of “Star Trek: Starfleet Academy,” titled “Kids These Days.” \n\n\t“Star Trek: S",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers from the series premiere of “Star Trek: Starfleet Academy,” titled “Kids These Days.” \n\n\t“Star Trek: Starfleet Academy” comes out phasers blasting right out of the gate, with a premiere episode that ranks not only among the best of the newest “Trek” series but with any throughout the franchise. \n\n\tWe open with a narration from the half-Lanthanite Capt. Nahla Ake (Holly Hunter), explaining the cataclysmic impact of The Burn, a deadly cosmic event in the 32nd century that occurred during the events of “Star Trek: Discovery.” In the aftermath of The Burn, the United Federation of Planets all but collapsed, and some of the high-minded ideals of Starfleet fell by the wayside.\n\t\n\n\tCut to a remote Federation outpost. Anisha Mir (Tatiana Maslany) is accused of aiding a space pirate by the name of Nus Braka (Paul Giamatti) — a part-Klingon, part-Tellarite — in attempting to hijack a Federation food supply shuttle, with the pilot of the shuttle dying during the attempt. Ake serves as the judge overseeing the proceedings, sentencing Braka to life in prison. \n\n\n\tBraka has a definite over the top, theatrical quality to him, something Giamatti was all too happy to play. “He’s a bit of a ham bone,” Giamatti says with a laugh. “So it was really fun to do. He was meant to come across as more of a buffoon than he actually turns out to be.”\n\n\tAlthough Ake wants to be merciful, Anisha aided a crime that resulted in the death of a Federation officer. Given that, Ake sentences her to a rehabilitation camp and separates her from her young son, Caleb. Before she is dragged away by the guards, Anisha screams to Caleb, “Don’t trust [the Federation]!” \n\t\n\n\tAke attempts to comfort Caleb, but he quickly escapes Federation custody and strikes out on his own. \n\n\tFast forward 15 years. A now adult Caleb (Sandro Rosta) is a wanted fugitive who is still desperately searching for his mother. An epic fight on an alien prison transport is not enough to free himself, and Caleb ends up in lockdown. \n\n\tRosta, who is fresh out of drama school and had never done stunt work before, credits the show’s stunt team with helping him through that fight. “They helped me throughout the entire process, and they knew that I was into it,” Rosta says. “They knew that I was game. So they let me do as much of it as possible, even the slamming against the walls and stuff.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, Ake has resigned her commission and is living a peaceful life. But when she hears they are reopening Starfleet Academy and want her to be the new chancellor, she cannot refuse. \n\n\tShe’s finally able to track down Caleb and offers him a choice — join the Academy or stay in prison. She sweetens the offer by promising to help him locate his mother, whom she says broke out of prison one year ago.\n\n\tCaleb, a perpetual lone wolf, is none too happy to be at the Academy. In addition to the campus in San Francisco, the students spend a great deal of time on the U.S.S. Athena, a fully-functioning starship that functions as a sort of mobile classroom. We also get a greater sense of Ake’s leadership style, which includes a much more laidback approach than a traditional Starfleet captain — laying out across the captain’s chair, not wearing shoes, etc. \n\n\t“My character’s name, Nala, in one translation means ‘water in the desert,'” Hunter says. “I thought that was really fantastic for so many different reasons. I thought of water not just to drink, but kind of maybe to feel. I wanted to be fluid. Then I also thought about like being almost a cat, almost a feline energy, but also a fun energy. When you’re 423 years old, there are many, many things that fall away, and the most important things distinguish themselves.”\n\n\tUpon arrival, Caleb meets his fellow classmates, including: pacifist Klingon Jay-Den Kraag (Karim Diané), the holographic (or photonic) Kasqian student Sam (Kerrice Brooks), the hard-driving Dar-Sha cadet Genesis Lythe (Bella Shepard), and the cocky Khionian Darem Reymi (George Hawkins). Caleb also quickly runs afoul of cadet master Lura Thok (Gina Yashere), a half-Klingon half-Jem’Hadar, as well as The Doctor (Robert Picardo). \n\t\n\n\tThe Athena begins its journey to Earth. Caleb uses an old subspace frequency his mother taught him to send her a message, but receives no reply. But when the Athena attempts to investigate a space anomaly, they are ambushed by Nus Braka and his gang. They disable the ship using programmable matter, with Braka telling Ahke that they tracked the Athena using Caleb’s message. Nus demands that Ahke surrender the Athena’s warp core or risk the whole ship and its crew being destroyed. \n\n\tIn keeping with Braka’s theatrical nature, his appearance includes funky clothes, unique finger armor, and ritual tattoos and scarring. “Earth pirates of the 18th century, they kind of went everywhere on the planet,” Giamatti says. “I thought, ‘Well, this guy’s been everywhere in the galaxy.’ And I thought it’d be interesting if he’s kind of a map of where he’s been.”\n\n\tCaleb is devastated that he put others at risk, telling Ake that he can get the programmable matter off the ship. He and his classmates get to work, with Ake stalling Braka for time. Genesis and Darem set off to gather programmable matter off the hull, with Darem able to briefly survive in the vacuum of space thanks to his Khionian nature. \n\n\tAt the same time, Jay-Den is forced to perform emergency surgery on Thok, who was injured in Braka’s initial attack. Although at first he is nervous, Jay-Den manages to save her life. Darem is able to get to the programmable matter, but he is on the verge of death as he does so. Genesis uses the ship’s tractor beam at the last minute to pull him back to safety. \n\n\tAke fakes a core breach to get Braka off the ship, with the Klingarite reluctantly leaving. That gives Caleb the window he needs to rush to engineering and attempt to pull off his plan. He is caught in a sneak attack by Braka, who goads Caleb by telling him he broke Caleb’s mother out of prison. The two engage in a knockdown drag out fight, with Caleb eventually coming out on top and disabling the programmable matter. Braka jumps into a nearby escape pod and gets away. \n\n\tRosta praises Giamatti’s willingness to make space for him despite the great difference in their experience levels as actors.\n\n\t“That part of the scene where he smashes my head on the console, that came from a suggestion that I that I had in the moment,” Rosta says. “I was like, ‘Man, if I bust your head on it and you bust my head on it, I think that’d be kind of cool.’ And Paul was like, ‘We’re doing that. We’re freaking doing that!’ — and we did it. And that just shows how much he’s willing to give space to me, a younger and less experienced actor, to have a moment of expression.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Athena arrives safely at Starfleet Academy in San Francisco. Caleb could very well be kicked out for what happened on the journey, but Ake is able to convince the higher ups to simply punish him and allow him to stay. She and Caleb have a heart to heart, where she reveals her own son was killed in The Burn. \n",

Burke had his mug shot taken ... and he looks none too happy to be in lockup -- giving the camera a death stare.\n      \n    \n          If you haven't seen the video yet, fair warning -- it's upsetting. It's unclear what sets the man in the clip off, but he's screaming at a security guard ... calling him the n-word multiple times and seemingly squaring up to throw a punch.\n      \n\n          Ultimately, the coward walks away ... throwing a series of slurs over his shoulder as he retreats. This altercation reportedly went down outside the Social Security Administration office in Norcross.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          According to cops ... Burke wasn’t at the scene when they arrived, so an arrest warrant was issued. But, he caused another disturbance on Thursday at a Courtyard Marriott hotel, where he was staying as a guest ... and he got a police escort outta there straight into the clink.\n      \n    \n          Gwinnett County police tell TMZ ... a front desk employee called and told police Burke was being hostile and asked for him to be removed and criminally trespassed. Police report he was being \"aggressive, yelling at the employees, and he was also talking to himself.\"\n      \n    \n          When officers arrived at his room, he initially refused to leave, but eventually complied. Robert told police he suffers from schizophrenia, paranoia, and mental health disabilities.\n      \n    \n          Burke has since been released on $1,000 bond.\n      \n    \n          We've reached out to Burke ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Insane Videos\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive Details\n              \n                          \n                Viral\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tPlaying Emily Brönte’s tragic heroine Cathy in “Wuthering Heights” is, for many actors, the dream screen role. \n\n\tFor Charlotte Mellington, it’s the first. \n\n\tBut that’s not all. Alongside playing the teenage version of the famed literary figure in the Warner Bros. feature, she’s playing the teenage Margot Robbie (who plays the older Cathy), and in a film directed by Emerald Fennell also starring Jacob Elordi that happens to be one of the buzziest releases of the year (one that also seems to gotten a few critics hot under the collar).\n\t\n\n\tBut 14-year-old Mellington — whose only previous performance was the “Matilda” West End stage musical — appears to be taking it all in her youthful stride, even if she could have done without the algebra lessons on set.\n\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety after “Wuthering Heights'” decidedly — and somewhat aptly — rainy London premiere, the youngster discusses the running through the Moors, watching her on-screen partner Owen Cooper stack it in the mud, the exceptionally creepy gift given to her by Fennell after the shoot and what she’d like to do next.\n\t\n\t\tHow was the London premiere?\t\n\n\tI had so much fun. Obviously there were some nerves on the way. It was my first one. But I think I did pretty well for my first. So a couple of nerves, but once I was there it was just an amazing experience.\n\t\n\t\tDid you get a bit wet? The rain was pretty extreme\t\n\n\tI did get a bit wet, but out of all us Jacob got the most wet. He was really embracing the rain while I was hiding under my umbrella.\n\t\n\t\tDid you manage to bring any family and friends along?\t\n\n\tSo at my hotel, it was the cutest thing ever. My two grannies came and saw me getting ready. My uncle came towards the end. My sister was there, my mum and my dad were there. And then it was a complete surprise, because I went down to the lobby once I was ready and my three best friends were standing right there. They’d come to see me. I had no idea and it was best surprise. I love them so much. It was really great to have that little confidence boost before I went.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWho did you manage to get inside the actual premiere?\t\n\n\tMy dad and my mum. And my little sister had a little walk down the carpet and then went out for dinner with my grandparents.\n\t\n\t\tSo how did the role of a young Cathy come your way?\t\n\n\tI do Rob Kelly screen acting classes. And on my first day, I walked in and at the end of the session, Rob was like, ‘Are you up for ‘Wuthering Heights’? I think you’d make a really good Cathy.’ And I was like, ‘No.’ I didn’t know anything about it. But then we struggled to send in stuff and get an audition, so he sent through my headshots again and I did a self-tape. And then got called back for the second one. And I had the biggest panic attack, because I was on holiday for the third audition and didn’t know whether I’d have to fly back. But they let me stay and come back later. And then I did my chemistry read with Owen and we were the last pair. And here I am!\n\t\n\t\tHad you read the book already?\t\n\n\tI had not read the book. I probably should’ve. I got a copy of it but I think I started the first page and my eyes started to swim. But it’s Emerald’s version of “Wuthering Heights.”\n\t\n\t\tHave you read it now?\t\n\n\tHa! No. But when I was auditioning I did try to watch some of the other on-screen versions!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCharlotte Mellington and Owen Cooper in “Wuthering Heights.” Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures. Photo by Jaap Buitendijk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJaap Buitendijk\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow was the shoot? Was it as cold and bleak as it looks on screen?\t\n\n\tTo be honest, the week we were shooting in Yorkshire, which can be quite bleak, it was the sunniest, bluest sky ever. But the more rain and the more wind, the better — I think it just made it all more dramatic. And it got you into character more. But I was just so happy to be there because it was exciting filming it and, of course, running through the Moors.\n\t\n\t\tWhen were you filming? Was it in school holidays or did you have to work around studies?\t\n\n\tIt was late December to late March. When we were working at the studio it wasn’t so bad, because I could go and then come back to school. But in Yorkshire, we had tutoring. Oh my god, tutoring. Don’t get me started! We’d film the most emotionally intense scene and then they’d be like “ok guys, just going to pop you in for half an hour of tutoring.” Algebra in between scenes… sends shivers down my spine!\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou’re obviously not in scenes together, but did you get to spend any time with Margot and Jacob?\t\n\n\tI’d see them in hair and makeup and around set and around the studio. But yeah, we’d have really lovely interactions. I think one time, in hair and makeup, Jacob came and we started playing this word game. We would both say a word and then you’d have to keep getting closer and closer until you get the same word. I didn’t know the game so was really awful at it. And I was like, gosh, Charlotte, you’re embarrassing yourself! But yeah, they were really lovely and I’d have lovely little chats with Margot. But they’re the best. They’re naturals. The most incredible actors I could ever have been in a movie with. I mean, it’s Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi… come on!\n\t\n\t\tYou were shooting with Owen Cooper. Did ‘Adolescence’ erupt while you were shooting?\t\n\n\tIt came out almost halfway into the shoot, but everything started to ramp up after ‘Wuthering Heights’finished. But he’s great — super nonchalant! At the end of filming, and me Vy (Nguyen) were like, ‘OMG, it’s done’ and he was just ‘Yeah, see ya.’\n\t\n\t\tI heard that Emerald made little shrines for Margot and Jacob in their rooms. Did she do anything similar for you?\t\n\n\tAt the end of filming, she gave us little bits to take home from the set. And she gave me Cathy’s doll that sits in her bed and it the creepiest thing ever. It’s so creepy I think if I looked into its eyes I might be transported to hell. And my mum set it up in my room before my friends came over to stay the night and we walked in and were like ‘aaargh!’. But yeah, I think that’s the most perfect Emerald/Cathy present I could have got.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCharlotte Mellington in “Wuthering Heights.” Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDo you have a particular favourite memory from the whole experience?\t\n\n\tObviously running through the Moors. But then there was this scene with Owen at the Pike and we’re basically just getting rained on. We’ve gone out and get caught in a storm. It was so muddy and I was slipping in my massive skirt but Owen literally stacked it into the mud. I remember just laughing hysterically. I love that moment. But we also played a lot of Makeshift Ball, which was the source of our entertainment while filming in Yorkshire. We didn’t have an actual ball, so Owen got a juice packet and wrapped it up in a plastic bag and taped it all together. And we’d chuck that around in a field next to the trailers. We got so much joy out of that.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThat sounds comically low budget\t\n\n\tYeah! We probably could have got a ball, but just kind of stuck with that.\n\t\n\t\tThis is your first film, you’re playing one of the literary world’s most famous figures, you’re playing the younger Margot Robbie and you’re being directed by Emerald Fennel. It’s not a bad place to start. You seem to be taking it all in your stride. Has it been overwhelming at all?\t\n\n\tEverything’s going on and everyone’s been amazing, so I think I’ve just been able to soak it up really well and have a great time.\n\t\n\t\tYou’re still at school. So what’s the grand plan for afterwards? What would you like to do?\t\n\n\tI have no idea. I’m actually just trying to get through school right now. I have my GCSE drama performance next Tuesday.\n\t\n\t\tYou’d be expected to ace that. Maybe just sent them a ticket to see the film?\t\n\n\tYeah! Go and watch that! But fingers crossed for that.\n\t\n\t\tBut is acting now definitely something you want to pursue?\t\n\n\tI would say so, yes. That’s the dream.\n\t\n\t\tIs there anything you’d really like to do? What do you love to watch?\t\n\n\tI do love rom-coms. Like “How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days” and “The Notebook.” I love watching all of those. So that would be amazing. And I love horror. So if anyone is taking note…\n",

    "body": "\n\tBrussels-based Be for Films has unveiled a first round of international deals for “Yellow Letters,” İlker Çatak’s follow-up to “The Teachers’ Lounge,” which won a prize at the Berlin Film Festival in 2023 and went on to earn an international Oscar nomination.\n\n\tPrior to its world premiere in competition at this year’s Berlinale, “Yellow Letters” pre-sold to Germany and Austria (Alamode), Benelux (Cineart), France (Haut et Court), Italy (Lucky Red), Spain (A Contracorriente Films), Sweden (Lucky Dogs) and Switzerland (Filmcoopi), the Baltics (Aone), Croatia (Kino Mediteran), Hungary (Mozinet), Poland (Aurora), Serbia (Five Stars), Slovenia (Demiurg), Ukraine (Arthouse Traffic), Greece (Cinobo), Norway (As Fidalgo), Portugal (Alambique) and Turkey (Bir Film).\n\t\n\n\t“Yellow Letters” follows artist couple Derya and Aziz, as an artist couple whose marriage implodes after they lose their jobs due to their political views. \n\n\n\tThe film reteams Çatak with Be for Films, which sold “The Teacher’s Lounge” around the world, including in the U.S. to Sony Pictures Classics.\n\n\tÇatak, who was born in Berlin to Turkish parents, said his film is “about people who have lost their employment, their social status and their right to exist in Turkish society due to state arbitrariness.”\n\n\tThe director, who wrote the screenplay with Ayda Çatak, said many artists “are no longer allowed to be in Turkey and I want to give these people a chance and cast our film with actors who are now or soon to be living in exile.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCharli xcx reflected on playing a heightened version of herself in “Brat” mockumentary “The Moment” at its Berlin Film Festival press conference, joking that she went “Method from the day I was born” for the role.\n\n\t“The Moment” stars Charli as an alternate-reality version of herself grappling with whether to stay true to her art or cross over to the commercial dark side. When a sinister director, played by Alexander Skarsgard, is hired to make a concert film about her upcoming “Brat” tour, Charli faces the ultimate test. Alongside Charli and Skarsgard, “The Moment” also stars Rosanna Arquette, Kate Berlant, Jamie Demetriou, Hailey Benton Gates, Isaac Powell, Rish Shah, Kylie Jenner and Rachel Sennott.\n\t\n\n\tAs someone who had spent so long in the music industry, Charli said she has “definitely come close” to some of the moments in the film and that characters were loosely based on people she had come across. \n\n\n\t“I’ve been training to play this role my entire life in ways, very Method from the day I was born I guess,” she said with a laugh. “And I’ve definitely reacted in ways like how I react in the film. Have I had a breakdown in the back of a Viano while smoking a million cigarettes? Yes. So I definitely had a lot to draw on.”\n\n\t“The Moment” first premiered at Sundance Film Festival last month before releasing in U.S. theaters. It became A24’s fastest-selling limited release in history, with more than 50 screenings selling out across key markets and the majority of ticket buyers being under 35 years old. The film opens in Europe next week following its Berlinale premiere.\n\t\n\n\tCharli also spoke about the importance of taking the film to Berlin, applauding the festival for “not shying away from political films, from films that have a real social angle, films by directors who really are visionary and have something to say.” \n\n\t“Those are the kinds of films that we love and want to champion ourselves,” she said, adding: “I’m only just starting out in this industry, but I feel passionate about working within those spaces.”\n\n\tBut asked if “The Moment” means the “Brat” era is truly over, Charli didn’t mince her words: “For me, it’s over. And you can’t dread the end when it’s over.”\n\n\tShe continued, “In the film, Charli decides to free herself of ‘Brat’ and kill ‘Brat.’ And I think we were aware that this film was probably the full stop at the end of an album campaign.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Court of Arbitration for Sport has dismissed Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych’s appeal against his disqualification from the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics, upholding a ruling that barred him from competing over a helmet honoring victims of Russia’s invasion.\n\n\tCAS said Olympic neutrality rules “reasonably balance” athletes’ freedom of expression with the need to maintain political neutrality at the Games, effectively ending Heraskevych’s attempt to be reinstated to competition.\n\t\n\n\tThe 27-year-old athlete had planned to race wearing what he described as a “helmet of memory,” featuring images of Ukrainian athletes and children killed during the war. Olympic authorities determined the display violated rules prohibiting political messaging during competition.\n\n\n\tThe International Olympic Committee had offered a compromise that would have allowed Heraskevych to display the helmet before and after the race and to wear a black armband while competing. He declined the proposal, maintaining the tribute was an act of remembrance rather than a political statement.\n\n\tThe International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation subsequently disqualified him after he continued wearing the helmet during training runs ahead of the event.\n\n\tWhile CAS upheld the competition ban, Olympic officials later restored Heraskevych’s accreditation, allowing him to remain at the Games in a non-competing capacity.\n\n\tThe case has drawn strong reactions beyond sport. Ukraine’s luge team staged a solidarity gesture during competition, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly praised the athlete following the ruling.\n\t\n\n\tHeraskevych previously drew international attention at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics when he held a “No War” sign after a race.\n\n\tThe dispute has renewed debate over the International Olympic Committee’s strict neutrality rules, as global conflicts increasingly intersect with athletes’ efforts to use the Olympic stage to highlight humanitarian and political issues.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMoroccan talent will step into the spotlight at this year’s EFM, crowning a generational growth spurt for the country’s film industry.\n\n\tLong prized for its stability, infrastructure and natural locations, Morocco’s production sector shifted into a new gear in 2018 with the introduction of a tax credit, now capped at 30%. That same year, the Marrakech Film Festival launched the Atlas Workshops, an industry platform designed to connect emerging regional filmmakers with sales agents and co-production partners on home turf.\n\t\n\n\tAtlas’ remit has expanded exponentially since, supporting more than 150 projects and helping launch filmmakers such as Asmae El Moudir, whose 2023 hybrid documentary “The Mother of All Lies” became one of the most internationally acclaimed Moroccan films to date. At the same time, foreign productions have surged, with titles like Oliver Laxe’s “Sirāt” and Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey” transforming Morocco’s landscapes into immersive big screen worlds. In 2025 alone, the Moroccan Cinematographic Center (CCM) backed 23 foreign features through the incentive scheme, generating more than $165 million in local investment.\n\n\n\tDomestic production has risen in parallel, with the industry delivering 54 films last year — a dramatic leap from the turn of the millennium, when output had dipped to just four features.\n\n\tNow firmly established as both a premier service destination and a rising industry hub, Morocco is looking outward, fielding major delegations at platforms such as Venice Production Bridge and this year’s EFM to connect a new generation of filmmakers directly to the global market.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFilms like “The Odyssey” and “Sirāt” have taken advantage of Moroccan locations — and a 30% tax rebate.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“We are a country of stories,” says CCM director Mohammed Reda Benjelloun. “But the challenge today is scale. It’s no longer enough for one, two, or three films a year to travel internationally; we need five or 10. Developing a project is one thing; pitching it on the international stage is another. A strong narrative and a solid dossier are essential, but convincing European producers and international funding bodies to invest is real work. That’s why it’s so important for our filmmakers to be here, confronting the market and understanding how it truly operates.”\n\n\tReflecting those ambitions, the CCM will bring 10 producers — chosen from more than 75 applicants and vetted for gender parity and international potential — to this year’s Berlin market. The EFM will also host a promo screening of Laila Marrakchi’s “Strawberries,” fresh off its top post-production prize at the Atlas Workshops and poised to become one of the year’s most high-profile Moroccan features.\n\n\tAt home, a parallel push is underway, with film schools and professional training programs expanding, alongside renewed efforts to engage the Moroccan diaspora. As Benjelloun puts it, the goal is to “internationalize the production process, but not the stories.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“K-1”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSelected for the Berlinale Series Market, the police procedural “K-1” offers one example. Showrunner Khadija Alami designed the project to meet international standards — introducing the showrunner model itself — while handing off episodic duties to acclaimed feature directors Yasmine Benkiran, Nour-Eddine Lakhmari and Hicham Ayouch to lend each episode genuine cinematic heft.\n\n\t“It’s a new way of working in Morocco, and I think it’s going to spark something,” says Alami, who runs production services outfit K-Films and has long served as a bridge to Hollywood.\n\n\tAfter a century of foreign shoots in the country, few ever stopped to ask what Moroccan directors might bring to the table. “K-1” was her answer. “We already have the skills, the crews, the vision. Now we’re proving it — on our own terms, and at the same level as British, French or American creators.” \n\t\n\n\t“We can’t just make small, insular projects for ourselves,” adds producer Lamia Chraibi. “We often talk about American soft power, but today every filmmaker in our region feels that if we don’t tell our own stories, Orientalist narratives will persist. We need to work carefully and with skill to challenge global audiences and get our stories out as widely as possible.” \n\n\tIndeed, Alami and Chraibi are part of a wave repositioning Morocco’s film industry as an international creative partner, not merely a service provider. Not coincidentally, both are among the 10 producers heading to Berlin for the Moroccan Producers Spotlight.\n\n\t“There’s a big difference between a producer who simply manages funds and a creative producer who shapes the story, the script, and the strategy for financing and distribution,” Chraibi explains. “Until recently, that role barely existed in Morocco, yet this global understanding is essential in a country where budgets are limited.”\n\n\tWhile developing co-productions through her Casablanca-based outfit LaProd — which helped launch Laxe with his 2016 Cannes Critics’ Week grand-prize-winning “Mimosas” — Chraibi has made an even broader impact as co-founder of the Tamayouz Foundation. Established in that pivotal year of 2018, the non-profit provides entry-level training for women in directing, screenwriting, production, and post-production, alongside financial support and mentorship.\n\n\tOver the past five years, roughly 100 filmmakers have passed through the foundation’s residencies, training programs, and professional workshops, supporting emerging talent looking to make the leap into features.\n\n\tAmong its alumni is producer Oumayma Zekri Ajarrai, who produced last year’s Cannes Critics’ Week short-film winner “L’mina,” and will also attend the Moroccan Producers Spotlight to help launch her Tamayouz-supported feature project “Road to Limbo,” directed by Ayoub Lahnoud.\n\n\t“We focus on nurturing careers,” Chraibi says. “We maintain a community-based approach, supporting alumni over the long term — whether they need legal advice or strategic guidance. With the active support of the CCM, our goal is to push the system forward: to renew it, open it up, and make room for an industry that is already transforming.”\n\t\n\n\tFilmmaker Alaa Eddine Aljem — another of the 10 producers selected for Berlin — embodies that generational shift. Two decades ago, Aljem was among the first graduates of Marrakech’s ESAV film school, co-founded by Martin Scorsese. Today, he runs that same institution, welcoming roughly 40 new students each year into bachelor’s and master’s programs offering specialized tracks in cinematography, sound, editing, directing and screenwriting.\n\n\tThe growth of Morocco’s film sector has not only created more opportunities locally but has also attracted an increasing number of international applicants — a trend reflected directly in Aljem’s own projects.\n\n\tAlongside his academic duties, he continues to work steadily as a producer and director, diligently integrating ESAV alumni into key technical roles on films such as “Out of School” — a feature documentary directed by Hot Docs winner Hind Bensari, which recently claimed two prizes at Final Cut in Venice — and his upcoming feature “El Dorado,” slated to shoot later this year.\n\n\tLooking ahead, Aljem wants to expand ESAV’s graphic design, VFX and animation facilities — echoing the CCM’s goal of turning Morocco into a full-service production and post-production hub. “Today, ESAV is operating at roughly half its potential,” he explains. “There’s still room to grow, both in scale and scope. Over the next five years, the goal is steady development, aligned with what festivals, the CCM, and other institutions are doing. We’re living through a pivotal period for Moroccan cinema; the sector is changing as the industry takes greater structure.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJournalists at Berlin Film Festival wasted no time asking Callum Turner about rumors that he’s the next James Bond at the press conference for his new film “Rosebush Pruning.”\n\n\tThe 35-year-old British actor — whose name has been swirling as Denis Villeneuve preps his first Bond movie for Amazon — was questioned on the topic just a few minutes into the presser, with the reporter acknowledging that it could be good to “get it out of the way.”\n\t\n\n\t“You’re right, it’s very early for that question,” Turner said with a slight smirk. “I’m not going to comment on it.”\n\n\n\tTurner’s co-star, Tracy Letts, then took some heat off him by adding, “I’m sorry, I’m the next James Bond!” to much laughter from the room. Turner replied, “Tracy, I thought you weren’t going to say anything.”\n\n\tBond was back on the menu in another question just moments later, when director Karim Aïnouz was asked what a 007 movie that he directed would look like. Letts again jumped to the rescue, saying that Aïnouz was directing “my James Bond.”\n\n\tThe film’s starry cast also includes Riley Keough, Jamie Bell, Elle Fanning, Lukas Gage and Pamela Anderson. All were on hand at the Berlinale press conference besides Keough and Fanning.\n\n\tThe panel was also inevitably asked about politics, which is always a hot-button topic at the Berlinale but has been avoided by many celebrities this year. Letts continued that trend, saying: “I can’t speak for other artists, I don’t necessarily feel comfortable taking away from the work that I’ve done. Obviously, it’s an awkward thing to discuss because of our political situation .. but one thing this movie gets at is that this disparity of wealth breeds bad behavior and, in fact, creates fascism.”\n\t\n\n\t“Rosebush Pruning” follows four American siblings as they “wallow in isolation and their inherited fortune, eschewing the demands of their blind father and seeking love and validation through each other and their latest designer clothes,” according to the film’s synopsis. “When Jack, the eldest brother and linchpin of this family, announces that he is moving in with his girlfriend Martha, blood ties are severed and Ed is forced to uncover the truth surrounding their mother’s death. Generational lies begin to unravel, and the fabric of this family slowly begins to disintegrate.”\n\n\tThe film was written by Yorgos Lanthimos collaborator Efthimis Filippou, who penned the scripts for “Dogtooth,” “The Lobster,” “The Killing of a Sacred Deer” and “Kinds of Kindness,” and loosely based on Marco Bellocchio’s 1965 film “Fists in the Pocket.”\n\n\tIn an exclusive interview with Variety previewing the film, Aïnouz said that he hopes to spark a conversation with the film’s dark themes, which include incest, sexual abuse and murder. \n\n\t“Only through absurdity can you perhaps touch certain issues,” he said. “I think it’s important to know and to discuss and to understand that sometimes the biggest amount of violence comes from within the family. The way that patriarchy has been naturalized, it’s really something that we need to deal with. There’s a cycle of violence, and perhaps violence is the only way to break that cycle.” \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Dao” opens with onscreen text defining its title as “a perpetual and circular movement which flows in everything and unites the world” — one way to articulate that famously intangible, widely traveled philosophical concept, and the one that works best for French-Senegalese director Alain Gomis‘s kinetic, freewheeling, cross-continental sixth feature. It’s also, thankfully, the only time his idea-rich but extravagantly sensory film chooses to directly explain itself. All other meaning in this vast, shape-shifting examination of globalization and diasporic identity is to be found in its keen observation of faces, places and restless human movement, as it follows a pair of French Bissau-Guinean women through a pair of ceremonial family gatherings, rooted in opposite halves of their cultural identity.\n\t\n\n\tIn one, second-generation immigrant Gloria (Katy Correa) returns to her father’s home village in rural Guinea-Bissau for a traditional memorial ritual to mark the old man’s recent passing, and to introduce her twentysomething daughter Nour (D’Johé Kouadio) to her ancestral motherland. In the other, Nour’s lavish, raucous wedding brings hordes of African and European guests to an upmarket French country estate, cuing a host of cultural microaggressions and more directly enacted conflicts. \n\n\n\tSwaying to and fro between these two sprawling, heavily storied affairs over an imposing but immersive three-hour runtime, “Dao” is a dazzling culmination of personal, political and stylistic fixations explored across the oeuvre of Gomis — best known internationally for his flavorful Congo-set character study “Félicité,” which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2017 Berlinale and placed on the international Oscar shortlist. Though its supersized scale and meandering narrative structure may deter less adventurous arthouse distributors, Gomis’s latest work (also premiering in competition at Berlin) nonetheless feels like his most vibrantly expansive and accessible, inviting widespread audience identification with its culturally scattered characters.\n\t\n\n\tIn a theoretically radical formal gambit that plays with remarkable immediacy, Gomis introduces his characters via the casting sessions for the actors playing them — striking an early note of documentary intimacy that permeates the otherwise scripted proceedings. “You’re going to be a real fake family,” Gomis tells the members of his ensemble in a blank white rehearsal room, before they variously voice their own ideas and hopes for a story they haven’t yet been told. (“I don’t want to play a battered, submissive woman,” insists one, “unless it’s one who kills her husband.”) And it’s in this interstitial space between reality and fiction that the drama begins, with Correa and Kouadio rehearsing a key inciting scene — as college student Nour informs her apprehensive mother that she’s engaged to be married.\n\n\tFrom there, we’re thrown into the film’s actual twin settings. The light, liquid playing of South African jazz pianist Abdullah Ibrahim — lifted from his landmark album “Blues for a Hip King,” which scores proceedings throughout — consumes the soundtrack, as the camera tracks a long, bumpy drive into Guinea-Bissau’s remote heartland on the one hand, and an ebulliently joyriding Just Married convoy through French wine country on the other. \n\n\tThe precise chronological gap between these two events isn’t made clear as the film darts between them, though it’s obvious that they’re closely bonded for 50-year-old Gloria, an independent-minded woman at something of a crossroads in her life as she sheds the direct responsibilities of motherhood. Her father — whom she describes, not with any particular animus, as “tough” — brought her up in Paris before returning to his African homeland later in life, and something in Gloria envies him that sense of attachment. She regards the hardscrabble, tradition-bound ways of life in the village with a kind of fond second-hand nostalgia, but also a degree of the touristic curiosity that Nour feels on her first visit “home.” \n\n\tOften entrusted to tell the story with her silent, drifting gaze, the temperature of scenes shifting according to who she’s watching and how, Correa gives an altogether remarkable performance as a someone who’s been made to feel an outsider in all spaces of her life, with or without family. She carries herself with straight-backed, self-sufficient dignity but also instinctive, retiring caution, loath to step outside the margins. On the guest list at the wedding, but discreetly seated at the next table, is her white boyfriend François, whom she likes without having any desire to deepen or advertise their relationship. \n\t\n\n\tHer prudency stands in stark contrast to another interracial pairing that ruffles feathers at the event: a prodigal son turning up unannounced with a heavily pregnant white girlfriend, named Calypso to boot. Gomis’ complex, patient scene construction lets such tensions lie and ripple and occasionally erupt, though there’s always too much going on for any single mini-drama to pull focus. \n\n\tA crack team of six editors, including Gomis himself, keep the pace both buoyant and agitated, conveying that breathless big-day energy of too many newly minted memories to hold all at once. A trio of cinematographers, including Gomis’s “Félicité” DP Céline Bozon, is similarly attuned to movement and the swelling and sinking moods of each occasion. Sometimes, the camera charges dizzily into the fray of busy dance scenes, at the wedding and memorial alike; sometimes, like Gloria, it hangs back on the observers’ bench.\n\n\tNour, meanwhile, has even more of a composite identity than her mother, owing to the influence of her French-Moroccan father Slimane (Samir Guesmi) — long separated from Gloria, with the scars of their relationship subtly but potently traced in brittle, beautifully written conversation scenes at the wedding, in which loaded ellipses say as much as the sometimes cutting dialogue. \n\n\tFrom Nour’s minimalist Chanel wedding gown to the ivory linen-draped table settings to a late, drunken mass singalong to the Fugees version of “Killing Me Softly,” the westernised wedding celebrations are a far cry from the anciently tribal memorial proceedings, with their many rounds of traditional dancing, ritualised anointment of wooden idols representing the dead, and general accommodation made for the spiritual presence of long-deceased antecedents.\n\n\tBut as these two long days (and nights) unfold in parallel, a vivid, complicated picture of community emerges between them — fractured all over by geographical distance, social alienation and fading personal memory, but binding a large spread of family members with a collective sense of belonging, or mutual not-belonging, or both as the mood takes them. Gomis’s whirling, incandescent emotional epic avoids pat, sentimental homilies about family, identity or saudade: In “Dao,” home isn’t just where the heart is, but where it’s been, and been broken, leaving a messy, international trail of fragments.\n",

    "description": "\n\tNine years after winning the Silver Bear for “Félicité,” French director Alain Gomis is returning to the Berlin International Film Festival with “DA",
    "body": "\n\tNine years after winning the Silver Bear for “Félicité,” French director Alain Gomis is returning to the Berlin International Film Festival with “DAO,” his most personal work yet — a three-hour family saga set between France and West Africa.\n\n\tThe helmer, who has Bissau-Guinean and Senegalese origins, wrote and directed the film which stars a mix of actors and newcomers, leading with Katy Correa and D’Johé Kouadio as a mother-and-daughter duo. The story follows them across two ceremonies, a wedding in Paris and funeral in Guinea-Bissau.\n\t\n\n\tIn his very first interview discussing the film, Gomis tells Variety that “DAO” did not emerge from a single idea but from a life experience. \n\n\n\tThe initial spark dates back to 2018, after attending his father’s funeral ceremony in Guinea-Bissau, which was a powerful experience for him. “I remember thinking: I’d like to make a film out of this. I didn’t know how,” he says. “It’s a film made of small things you add together, that weave into a mosaic. It grew in size and volume through tiny details.”\n\n\tShot in just 20 days — 10 in France and 10 in Guinea-Bissau — the production was swift, unlike the process. True to Gomis’ method, almost none of the dialogue was scripted in advance, with scenes shaped in the present tense during the shooting which took place on location, between France and a village in Guinea-Bissau. “It’s the intentions that matter. What is happening inside the character at that moment? What’s at stake?” explains Gomis, who founded the Yennenga Centre, comprising cinema school, in Senegal back in 2018. Ultimately, Gomis ended up with 200 hours of footage. “We had a five-hour film,” he says with a laugh. The editing process became an exercise in preservation: keeping what he calls “the real function of participation” – meaning the collective energy — while sculpting it into a three-hour narrative.Improvisation proved central to his process and gave the film a sort of hybrid nature, blending fiction with bits of documentary. Non-professional Katy Correa, he says, possesses “an intelligence of performance,” instinctively grasping emotional stakes. Gomis also brought well-established actors, like Samir Guesmi and Thomas Ngijol, into the fold.\n\t\n\n\tAlthough “DAO” is more intimate than political, Gomis sublty addresses timely themes, such as the impact of colonization, displacement and inherited trauma. \n\n\t“Each family carries its secrets. Here, there’s something about people who were formed through an absence, whose image of themselves needs repairing,” he says. Referring to the generational gap between those who stayed in Africa, and those who emigrated, he explains that “some things weren’t explored, weren’t spoken. You grow up with the feeling that something is missing.”\n\n\tAs in “Felicité, which revolved around a bar singer in Kinshasa who embarks on a journey across the Congolese capital to raise money for her son’s surgery, the female perspective remains central in “DAO.”\n\n\tIn “DAO,” Corréa plays a single mother who is marrying her daughter and starts reconsidering her own future. Gomis says he was inspired to explore “DAO”‘s story from a female perspective and tackle once again motherhood. \n\n\tHe says the film “first came to me through a female character,” because that’s “something I’ve seen in our families — women who refused themselves another life before their child was grown — as if they didn’t have the right to think about themselves first.”\n\n\tLike these women he’s known, the character played by Corréa has “postponed another life for herself until her child was older,” says Gomis. \n\n\tAnother similarity with Gomis’ previous work, such as “Felicity” and “Rewind & Play,” music, and particularly jazz, provided the tonal backbone for “DAO.” The score alternates between traditional ceremonial sounds and some jazz pieces by saxophonist Keïta Janota and Gaspard Gomis which frame the narration.\n\n\t“It gave the film its flesh,” he says. “There’s something tender, nostalgic. A beautiful way of looking at the world.”\n\n\tSet to premiere in competition on Feb. 14, “DAO” is a France-Senegal-Guinea-Bissau co-production with celebrated producer Sylvie Pialat at Les Films du Worso (“Timbuktu”) and SRAB Films (“Les Miserables”), alongside Senegalese co-producers Yennenga Productions and Nafi Films, and Telecine Bissau Produções in Guinea-Bissau. The Party Film Sales is representing the film internationally. \n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen prolific Welsh indie director Jamie Adams went looking for his next film, he didn’t start with a famous name in mind. He started with an epiphany. For years, he’s had a drawer full of ideas — loose outlines waiting for the right moment. “Only What We Carry” was one of them. But it wasn’t until when he was in his 40s, and as a father, that the story fully resonated.\n\n\t“When you’re in your 20s at film school, you study all these great artists. You’re encouraged to admire them, to worship them,” he says to Variety in his first interview about the film. “But as time passes, everybody starts reassessing who these artists are and what we’ve allowed them to be. A lot of them are complicated,” he says, citing Woody Allen, Picasso and Stanley Kubrick.“Now I’m a father of three … We’ve had lots of discussions about what it means to be an artist and looking at these people with new eyes,” says Adams, who’s currently knee-deep in editing. “Only What We Carry” explores that shift in a lighthearted way, blending comedy and drama. \n\t\n\n\tWith his Nouvelle Vague-inspired improvised filmmaking style and character-driven approach, Adams has attracted such actors to his projects as James McAvoy, Martin Freeman and Malin Akerman. \n\n\tBut he’s topped himself with this new film, which is repped internationally by International Film Trust at the European Film Market. He was able to pull Quentin Tarantino from retirement for a six-day shoot alongside Simon Pegg, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Sofia Boutella, Liam Hellmann and Lizzy McAlpine.\n\n\tPegg stars as “Julian Johns, a once-formidable instructor whose former student Charlotte Levant (Boutella) returns home to face the ghosts of her past. Joining them are Quentin Tarantino as John Percy, Julian’s old friend whose sudden arrival stirs long-buried truths,” reads the synopsis. Gainsbourg plays Charlotte’s protective sister, while Hellmann stars as a restless artist caught between love and loyalty and McAlpine plays a young aspiring dancer.\n\n\tAdams says he sensed Tarantino was in a reflective moment after shelving a project (“The Adventures of Cliff Booth,” which Tarantino wrote but David Fincher directed) and reached out with his outline and personal letter. He didn’t expect a response, but then two weeks later, Tarantino’s agent requested a Zoom. Adams logged on, nursing what he describes as the worst toothache of his life — one his dentist diagnosed as psychosomatic. “Then you hear his voice,” Adams says. “It’s like Disneyland for filmmakers.”\n\t\n\n\t“Tarantino proved to be an exceptional actor,” Adams says. “He was wonderful. Curious. Collaborative. He loves actors. He loves cinema history. Being in France making something that felt inspired by Eric Rohmer excited him.”\n\n\tThe film shot entirely in Deauville, the posh seaside town in Normandy. Adams described the atmosphere as “summer camp,” with no egos and a collaborative spirit across the six-day shoot. Because filming took place at the end of summer, the town was unusually quiet. “It almost felt like a studio backlot. The town square looked like a set. It felt magical,” he reminisces.Next up, Adams might be looking for an even bigger challenge: persuading Martin Scorsese to step in front of his camera. “It’s time for the directors who really want to be actors to come and improvise. Truffaut was a great actor. So many of them are frustrated actors,” he says. Tell me about the starting point, the genesis of “Only What We Carry.” How did it come about?That’s a good question. I’ve had this story outlined for many years. Every now and again, when it’s time to think about a new project, I go to my drawer full of ideas and see which one resonates with me. For this one, I’ve been thinking a lot about being in my 40s now. When you’re in your 20s at film school, you study all these great artists. You’re encouraged to admire them, to worship them. But as time passes, everybody starts reassessing who these artists are and what we’ve allowed them to be. A lot of them are complicated. Whether it’s Woody Allen, Picasso… or Stanley Kubrick on “The Shining” and how he treated Shelley Duvall, or even stories about Jack Nicholson being told he could only eat cheese sandwiches at lunch — when you’re 20, you laugh about it. It’s part of the mythology. Now I’m a father of three — 19, 20 and 14 — and I have two daughters. We’ve had lots of discussions about what it means to be an artist and looking back at these people with new eyes. I’ve been wanting to explore that. With James McAvoy, we explored something similar in a darker way on a previous film (“Pose”). But this time I wanted to approach it more in my voice — comedy with drama. Not comedy as jokes, but in a more human way of looking at something. That’s where it started.How did Simon Pegg come on board?I’d just worked with Martin Freeman, and he mentioned that Simon — who’s a friend of his — was fascinated by the process and would get involved if I reached out. So I did what I always do. I reached out via his agent and sent what I normally send — an outline, about eight pages, and a letter explaining why I thought he’d be great for the character of Julian Johns. Then we have a conversation to see if we align in terms of perspective. After that, we do character conversations. They’re led by the actor, really. I ask questions, they respond, and whatever they say becomes the truth. There’s no homework. It’s just a conversation. And whatever comes out in that moment is what we use.So you already had the pitch when you started talking to him?I wouldn’t say there’s any preciseness to it. But yes, I had the outline — about eight pages of story. This is where I think it can go. Quentin actually said he was fascinated by the way I write these outlines because there’s no fixed ending. There’s room for the actors to maneuver. They can see the general narrative, but they can also see the freedom. He told me he tried writing one himself during downtime and said it didn’t feel right. I said that’s because he’s one of the greatest storytellers of all time — he naturally wants beginning, middle and end.How did you approach Quentin Tarantino?\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tVery similar to everyone else. I guess I was offering something that he wasn’t offered ever. So the idea of making a feature film a week, the idea that everything really is improvised from what I call a scriptment, which is like a 30-page scene-by-scene outline with no dialogue in it.\n\n\tBy that point, Simon was on board, Sofia Boutella had signed up, and Charlotte Gainsbourg had come on. I noticed Quentin was doing a lot of interviews at Sundance and Cannes [in 2024] and that he’d put aside a film project (“The Adventures of Cliff Booth”). It felt like he was in a moment of contemplation. I also knew that his first love was acting. When I was younger, it was common knowledge that he wanted to act — he speaks first in “Reservoir Dogs.” So I appealed to that side of him.\n\n\tI sent him the story outline and a letter. I was just very honest about believing in him as an actor. Improvisation, the way I use it, is about being present and reacting organically. He’s one of the greatest conversational storytellers. I thought that would be incredible in character. I didn’t think I’d hear back. But two weeks later, on a Sunday, his agent emailed saying Quentin was intrigued and wanted a Zoom.That day, I had the worst toothache of my life. The dentist said nothing was wrong — it was psychosomatic. I was terrified. I was in the garden massaging my cheek because I was in so much pain.Then I got on Zoom. And once you hear his voice, you’re transported. It’s like Disneyland for filmmakers. The conversation went everywhere, from movies, to a Welsh sitcom called “Gavin & Stacey,” to what his life was like, what my life was like. At one point he tried to talk about the character, and said “I’ve written quite a few questions here about the character,” and I said, “No, this isn’t the moment for that. That’s the next conversation.” As soon as I got off, I thought, “Why did I say that?” And he told me later that he loved that moment in that first conversation because he was like, “Well, I’m going to be directed.” Two days later, he was on board.What were the character conversations like with Tarantino?We tried to have at least three character conversations. They were about texture rather than timeline. What did their childhood kitchen look like? What food do they grab from the fridge? What does their house look like from the outside? At one point he decided his character should have a broken wrist. He turned up on set with a cast. For him, it was symbolic — carrying weight physically. By the end, he doesn’t need it anymore. He didn’t over-explain it. He just knew it was necessary.You shot the film in six days. How does that process work?\n\n\tYes, we shoot in six days with a single camera. We know what we want to shoot each day, but if a scene becomes more important, we stay with it. If it’s not giving us what we hoped, we move on. Everything is an opportunity. We don’t really do traditional takes — we call them passes. Usually four or five per scene. During a pass, we might start on a two-shot and drift into a close-up. The actors don’t know when it’s their close-up. They just have to stay present. It’s democratic. Everyone is always listening.What was the atmosphere like on set?\n\n\tIt was like summer camp. No egos. No special treatment. Everyone had breakfast together. There were no special trailers. We were all pulling in the same direction. We shot in Deauville at the end of summer, so it was quiet. It almost felt like a studio backlot. The town square looked like a set. It felt magical. Everyone supported us, especially considering how little money we have to make these films.Did Tarantino let you direct him?I love that question. The real question is whether I allowed myself to direct him. He came on because he knew he would be directed. With improvised films, directing is more about continued conversation about character and story rather than micro-managing performance. It’s thematic. He was wonderful. Curious. Collaborative. He loves actors. He loves cinema history. Being in France making something that felt inspired by Rohmer excited him.\n\n\tHow would you rate him as an actor? \n\n\tHe’s an exceptional actor. Naturally gifted. I’m proud the film gives him the opportunity to show that.Do you think this could be the beginning of a new acting chapter for him?Absolutely. Maybe the writing and directing were just the beginning.You’re editing now. How much footage do you have?About 36 hours. We got about six hours of rushes each day. The edit is like documentary filmmaking. You’re writing the screenplay again. You could give the rushes to five filmmakers and get five different films back. That’s where my voice comes through. The final film will probably be around 85–90 minutes.Who would you like to get next? Timothée Chalamet? I think maybe Martin Scorsese. It’s time for the directors who really want to be actors to come and improvise. Truffaut was a great actor. So many of them are frustrated actors. I love that some of them gave it a go. I’d love to do it myself at some point. I just need to be less shy about it. We love creating scenes. We love being part of the moment where the alchemy happens between people. It feels important to place ourselves as filmmakers at the heart of that. Naturally, I don’t know who will be next. I’m always surprised by who I gravitate towards. We’ll see.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndia’s Sippy Films is rolling out its legacy IPs including “Sholay” and “Shaan” across animation, microdramas, gaming and merchandising in a multi-format strategy backed by investor Kuberans Tech Ventures, custodian Shehzad Sippy and Kuberans director Jeet Wagh tell Variety.\n\n\tThe approach draws from Western character IP models and Japanese anime’s cross-platform playbook, targeting younger audiences while the studio prepares to announce a new feature film partnership by mid-2026.\n\t\n\n\tSippy outlines a strategy that positions films as the primary driver while supplementing with multiple revenue streams and audience touchpoints.\n\n\n\t“With specifically with character IP, how one approaches development and roll out of these things is it’s almost like a wheel of monetization that you and planning that you have to have,” Sippy says. “Films, live action content, really drive the character IP business more than anything else. So you need to have those things coming out, but then it should be supplemented with these other touch points and being able to constantly engage with your fan base. So whether that’s animation or gaming, or merchandise, or there’s new forms of fan interaction with Web3 platforms… all of this is being looked at [including] stage plays.”\n\n\tThe strategy draws from established Western models. “You can look at the classic Disney model, they have this huge portfolio of character IP, and this is how they strategically plan and develop and roll these things out,” Sippy says. “That’s the kind of approach we want to take, which we felt has been lacking from an Indian studio perspective.”\n\t\n\n\tSippy emphasizes the revenue diversification potential. “Character led IP lends itself well to other streams of revenue, also not just that one weekend at the box office,” he said. “They lend themselves to gaming, merchandising, various forms of licensing that can occur after the fact. And the fact is, we haven’t had a lot of homegrown IPs out of India. I think you could say Green Gold Animation [the company behind globally successful IP “Chhota Bheem’] is the main one that has been able to do it successfully.”\n\n\tWagh stresses that the evolving market requires flexible content strategies across theatrical, streaming and emerging formats including microdramas.\n\n\t“Everything might not be a film or full fledged series. It can be smaller content pieces also that can go throughout the world, throughout cross streams, cross platforms, microdramas,” Wagh says. “You never know where what fits what. It’s very content driven – whatever fits a piece, because we can’t have a plan for that. Wherever the content is, how the content is developed, and how, what is the go to market strategy for it, that’s where we have to sit on that platform.”\n\n\tWagh contrasts the approach with traditional theatrical planning. “That traditional thinking of ‘We are making an IP, I think this will do these many theater days, in these many territories,’ that is, I feel, personally, has gone out of the window where so many parallel streams of platforms are actually coming across now,” he says.\n\n\tSippy adds: “We’re in 2026. We have a new young audience in this country. We have to rethink the approach. We’re trying to create stuff that will resonate with young people and hopefully for generations to come.”\n\n\t“The goal is, having taken over the company now and taking it forward in a new direction, is to build that with all the legacy IPs we have, to build those worlds out in the form of new content, specifically film and animation,” Sippy says. “These IPs have a lot of appeal as they are, but we want to set them up for the future generations, and have them have that cross generational appeal across formats, whether it be film or animation.”\n\n\tDevelopment work spans origin stories, new character introductions and world expansion. “The goal is to try to set these up as franchises moving forward,” Sippy says.\n\t\n\n\tThe studio has been in active development for over a year. “We’ve been heavily involved in development of several of these IPs over the last year or so, and we’re getting close to now making formal announcements of some of the new content that will be rolling out,” Sippy says. “In terms of the new content, I think towards mid this year there’ll be an announcement that comes out regarding a partnership we’re working on at the moment for the new feature length film we’re planning to start shooting later this year.”\n\n\tSippy points to the Japanese anime industry as a blueprint for character IP exploitation, drawing on early career experience working with Gen Fukunaga, who brought “Dragon Ball Z” to U.S. audiences.\n\n\t“The reason anime resonates across the world with young people is that even though culturally, the storylines are steeped in Japanese culture, the themes are universal,” Sippy says. “If you look at some of the IP and the legacy IP we have, the underlying storylines are all universal.”\n\n\tSippy notes Fukunaga’s merchandising success. “The first year he made no money on ‘Dragon Ball Z’ from a broadcast perspective, but he made $50 million in merchandising, controlling the merchandising,” he says. “The quality of the animation, and the way they keep audiences interested in the craft they’ve been able to put together. That’s the secret sauce.”\n\n\tThe studio plans to incorporate manga-style content development. “A lot of Japanese anime, it’s manga that drives the content first, first the manga comes out, and then the content comes post that,” Sippy says. “In the same way, if you look at DC and Marvel comics, comics books led to their business moving forward and being able to tell those stories in different formats.”\n\n\tWagh emphasizes the importance of multiple consumer touchpoints beyond film releases, citing the Japanese anime industry’s approach to merchandising and brand integration.\n\n\t“Creating touch points, what Japanese anime actually does, is for younger [audiences],” Wagh said. “A lot of social media is also curated towards the anime. As a young generation, when you’re watching something on TV and you’re creating more touch points across your life, be it books, be it in schools, be it on social media, you tend to actually live them rather than just watch them. That’s where the craze and fandom starts in the character IP or anime business as well.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile the studio’s library consists of properties that are 50 years old or slightly less, Sippy emphasizes the focus on younger demographics while maintaining family-friendly content.\n\n\t“There is a disconnect between an older audience and the audience today. So that’s specifically what we’re trying to bridge with the way we’re approaching the rollout of our content,” Sippy says. “The main focus is the youth of today and the youth moving forward.”\n\n\tThe approach aims to create multi-generational appeal. “We hope to emulate that family friendly content that we’re creating so where a mother, father, grandparent can come watch the film along with their kids and grandkids, and there’s something there for everybody,” Sippy says. “Not only through how we develop the content, but the modes of consumption, whether it’s animation or Web3. We want to take a holistic approach to how we are planning all these things.”\n\n\tThe strategy follows the Film Heritage Foundation’s restoration of “Sholay” after discovering 500 cans of original material and 500 cans of “Shaan” material in Technicolor’s storage facility in London. The restored “Sholay” is in discussions for limited theatrical releases through Criterion in North America and BFI in the U.K., with a Criterion Blu-ray edition and streaming release also planned.\n",

A law enforcement source involved in the investigation told him this morning neither the ransom note we received nor the reward demand emails we received were the trigger for last night's action.\n      \n    \n          We have not confirmed, but it appears ... the main target last night was someone in a vehicle in the Tucson area. Again, it appears but is not confirmed ... the search of the house is connected to the traffic stop. 2 people were taken out of the house, and it was searched for several hours.\n      \n\n          CNN, citing a law enforcement official, said Saturday morning authorities questioned one man but eventually released him ... believing him not to be the kidnapper.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          Levin said the FBI had multiple contacts with TMZ Friday about both the ransom letter and the reward demands.

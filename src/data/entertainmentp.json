    "body": "\n\tThe shortest, scariest movie of the year has arrived — and you can watch it right now.\n\n\t“Dead Grandma,” which is written and directed by Rachel Kempf and Nick Toti, is set to debut at the 2026 Slamdance Film Festival in Los Angeles — but Variety readers can get a sneak peek of the short below.\n\n\tKempf and Toti delivered a viral horror sensation last year with their indie film “It Doesn’t Get Any Better Than This.” The pair promised that, despite a rousing reaction during festival slots and independent screenings, it would never be made available for home viewing.\n\t\n\n\tThe idea for “Dead Grandma” came from Toti’s 2015 day job as a preschool teacher, which inspired darkly comedic thoughts.\n\n\n\t“I was working 6–8 hours a day in a nursery with all these infants crawling around me,” Toti said in a statement. “One day, I had the urge to lie down on the floor as if I were dead, just to see what the babies would do. This idea made me laugh at the time, and I thought it would make a good short film.”\n\n\t“There’s this famous legend about Ernest Hemingway,” Kempf said in a statement. “Supposedly, somebody bet that he couldn’t write a short story using only six words. In response, Hemingway wrote: ‘For sale: baby shoes, never worn.’ We tried to match the spirit of this story with our film, but with an even darker sense of gallows humor and appreciation for the macabre.”\n\n\tThe short is set to debut as part of Slamdance’s 99 Special program, which takes place Sun., Feb 22.\n\n\t“Inspired by Slamdance’s $99 Special, our new 99 Special program embraces affordable technology, apps and DIY filmmaking methods to unleash your imagination into 99-second (and under) moving image gems,” Anna Lee Lawson, the Slamdance film festival & screenplay competition manager, said in a statement. “99 Special is geared toward accessible filmmaking and serves to break down the cost barrier of production.” \n\t\n\n\t“Dead Grandma” has already made some fans in other filmmakers. Director Uwe Boll praised the work, saying, “I thought it was a photo, not a film. But then it ended up surprisingly…and dark.”\n\n\tDirector Alex Ross Perry said, “It’s an entire saga of humor, dread, and discomfort somehow squeezed into the length of a commercial. The final reveal is a real gut punch.”\n\n\tBeyond the premiere of “Dead Grandma,” Kempf and Toti are starting production on their newest film, “Scary New Year.” The Kempf-scripted project is produced by Liane Cunje and Divide/Conquer, and stars Lauren Viteri, Sam Hook, Amelia Ann, Beck Nolan and Zach Schnitzer. Adam J. Minnick is set to be the cinematographer.\n\n\tWatch “Dead Grandma” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmy Adams won’t be on hand for the world premiere of Kornél Mundruczó‘s “At the Sea” at Berlin Film Festival on Monday, but she sent a message expressing how proud she is of the drama. \n\n\tThe director opened the film’s press conference by reading a message from the Oscar-nominated actress, who stars in “At the Sea” — which premieres Monday night in competition — as a woman struggling with addiction who attempts to rebuild her life after rehab.\n\t\n\n\t“Thank you to the Berlin Film Festival for hosting the world premiere of ‘At the Sea’ this evening, and for continuing to support independent filmmaking. Your support is invaluable to me and to independent storytelling around the globe,” Adams wrote. “I’m sorry I’m not there in person, but I know Kornél is representing us very well.”\n\n\n\t“At the Sea” also features Murray Bartlett, Brett Goldstein, Chloe East, Dan Levy, Jenny Slate and Rainn Wilson, though no one from the cast was on hand for the press conference. In addition to Mundruczó, the presser featured screenwriter Kata Wéber and producers Alexander Rodnyansky and Viktória Petrányi.\n\n\tAdams added: “I’m extremely proud and deeply moved by the work and my fellow cast members Murray, Chloe, Dan, Jenny, Brett and Rainn. I am forever grateful for the family we formed. Family is at the heart of this film. It was a gift to get to explore the themes of intimacy, legacy and most of all to explore a character at the crossroads of true accountability. To move on and to move forward requires brutal honesty, and I hope you feel that in every frame of the film.”\n\t\n\n\t“At the Sea” stars Adams as Laura, who returns to her family’s Cape Cod home after rehab. “Once the face of her late father’s renowned dance company, she built an identity tethered to his legacy and the cost of growing up in his shadow. Laura’s functional alcoholism, long ignored by everybody, finally reached a breaking point after a drunk-driving accident with her young son in the car. Now sober, she comes home changed, but to a family unprepared for this,” the film’s synopsis reads. “Her husband Martin welcomes her cautiously, torn between devotion and mistrust. Their teenage daughter Josie meets Laura with hostility, while her son Felix remains distant. Over several days by the sea, family moments become pressure points, revealing buried anger, financial strain and the fragility of reconciliation. As Laura’s former colleagues push her to return to the career she abandoned, she confronts a deeper question: Who is she without the identity that once justified her self-destruction?”\n\n\tHungarian director Mundruczó is best known for his 2020 film “Pieces of a Woman,” which earned star Vanessa Kirby and Oscar nomination for best actress. Awards buzz has already started to build for Adams’ performance in “At the Sea,” which Mundruczó called “unbelievably brave.”\n\n\t“She’s an unbelievably gifted actress or even an artist, and she gave herself to the movie and she really tried [to give a performance] as brutally honest as possible,” he said. “I think the performance is unbelievably brave compared to the acceptance of Hollywood these days and how pure and raw she can be. That was her main focus.”\n\n\tAdams, who has been Oscar-nominated six times, most recently headlined the black comedy horror film “Nightbitch.” Up next, she’s starring in Taika Waititi’s anticipated adaptation of the dystopian novel “Klara and the Sun” alongside Jenna Ortega, and has an undisclosed role in Shawn Levy’s “Star Wars: Starfighter” led by Ryan Gosling.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wuthering Heights” is the new box office queen. \n\n\tDirector Emerald Fennell’s bold take on the classic novel has collected $38 million over Presidents’ Day holiday weekend in North America and a promising $45 million internationally, delivering a global tally of $83 million. Those ticket sales are slightly above Sunday’s estimate of $82 million worldwide.\n\n\tAlthough the domestic figure is below projections (which Warner Bros. placed around $40 million for the four days), “Wuthering Heights” enjoyed a bigger-than-expected start at the international box office. With the softer turnout in North America, the R-rated film might just rely on international crowds for staying power. Warner Bros. spent $80 million to produce “Wuthering Heights,” not including the tens of millions for the global promotional tour.\n\t\n\n\tMargot Robbie and Jacob Elordi star as toxic lovers Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff in the remake of Emily Brontë’s romantic drama. Unsurprisingly, “Wuthering Heights” was the de facto choice for women around Valentine’s Day, with females representing more than 75% of opening weekend crowds. \n\n\n\tThis marks the ninth consecutive No. 1 debut for Warner Bros. following theatrical winners such as “A Minecraft Movie,” “Sinners,” “Final Destination Bloodlines” and “Weapons.” Back in 2024, Netflix (which is currently fighting with Paramount to buy Warner Bros.) had offered a hefty $150 million for Fennell to make “Wuthering Heights” for the streamer. However the director and Robbie, who produced the film with MRC, opted for a smaller budget from Warner Bros. in exchange for a theatrical release and full-scale marketing campaign.\n\t\n\n\tDuring the Valentine’s Day and Presidents’ Day weekend, “Wuthering Heights” was easily No. 1 in North America over two fellow newcomers, Sony’s original animated sports adventure “GOAT” and Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo-led heist thriller “Crime 101.”\n\n\t“GOAT” impressed in second place with $35 million over the four-day frame, including $27.2 million over the traditional weekend. Those ticket sales mark the biggest debut for an original animated film since Pixar’s 2023 film “Elemental.” That film, which debuted to $29 million over the traditional weekend, became a slow-and-steady box office hit and eventually powered to $496 million globally. Since “GOAT” carries an $80 million production budget, Sony Pictures Animation is hoping the kid-friendly film about an aspiring roarball champion (it’s like basketball, but different) enjoys a similar endurance at the box office. Audiences, most of whom were families, gave the movie an “A” grade on CinemaScore exit polls, which bodes well for staying power. \n\n\t Overseas, “GOAT” earned $15.6 million for a better-than-projected worldwide tally of $50.6 million.\n\n\t“Crime 101” arrived behind expectations with $16.3 million through the holiday frame, including $14.2 million over the traditional weekend. Those ticket sales were enough for third place on domestic charts. Internationally, the movie collected $12 million from 60 territories for a global total of $28.3 million. While that may be a decent start for an R-rated movie aimed at older audiences, it’s less encouraging knowing that Amazon MGM spent $90 million to produce the film. Since theater owner keep about 50% of ticket sales, “Crime 101” needs a long theatrical life to justify that price tag. Although reviews were positive, moviegoers were mixed, as evidenced by the “B” grade on CinemaScore. Bart Layton (“American Animals”) directed “Crime 101,” which stars Hemsworth as an elusive jewel thief who plots high-stake heists across the Los Angeles freeway.\n\n\tOverall, the box office is 8% ahead of last year’s total, according to Comscore. That year-over-year percentage has been shrinking because, although this weekend was solid for counter-programming, attendence levels didn’t compare to 2025’s Presidents’ Day holiday weekend when Marvel’s “Captain America: Brave New World” launched to $100 million. The next major studio release is Paramount’s “Scream 7” on Feb. 27. Until then, movie theater operators are banking on “Wuthering Heights” and “GOAT” to keep heating up the box office.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDR Sales, the international sales arm of Danish pubcaster DR, has boarded TV drama “The Best of Families” created by Maja Jul Larsen (“Cry Wolf “) and produced by Piv Bernth (“The Killing”).\n\n\tThe six-part limited series is based on real events involving Denmark’s ChemiNova chemical factory in the early 1950s and exposes the human and moral cost of the ChemiNova success story. First presented at Berlinale’s Co-Pro Series in 2025, the show is now in production, led by Bernth’s Apple Tree Productions that, as previously announced, will shutter at the end of this year.\n\t\n\n\t“The Best of Families,” which is inspired by novelist Kim Blæsbjerg’s award-winning novel of the same name, spans ten years. It traces the rise of the ChemiNova chemical factory “that promises jobs and progress – while quietly poisoning the land and the people who depend on it,” says the synopsis. \n\n\n\tThe narrative is centered on three women: Margrethe, Karin, and Gudrun, and two brothers, Niels and Erik. The story unfolds “as prosperity gives way to silence, moral compromise, and, ultimately, a reckoning that can no longer be ignored.”\n\n\tThe series features a high-profile ensemble cast including Mikkel Boe Følsgaard (“The Chestnut Man”); Lars Ranthe (“Adam’s Apples”); and Ane Stensgaard Juul (“The New Nurses”) as well as new talents including Mathilde Eusebius, Tue Lunding and Morten Agerholm.\n\n\tCommissioned by DR, “The Best of Families” is supported by West Danish Film Fund and the Nordisk Film and TV Fund and expected to premiere on DR in Feb. 2027 followed by a festival premiere.\n\t\n\n\tThe series is part of the N12 collaboration bringing together Nordic broadcasters NRK, SVT, Yle, and RÚV. \n\n\tThe plan is for “Best of Families” to premiere on DR in February 2027, with a festival premiere expected in spring 2027.\n\n\tPiv Bernth and Maja Jul Larsen are pictured above (from left to right)\n",

    "body": "\n\tOlivia Colman has an Oscar, two Emmys and a boatload of BAFTAs, but she visibly recoils when asked about her acting process. \n\n\t“All of it sounds pretentious,” Colman admits during a recent Zoom interview. “Whenever you talk about how you do it or how you don’t do it, or whatever… it sounds unbearable. I just like doing it, and ideally I’d like to do it with no one watching ever. But I know that’s not possible.”\n\n\n\tBut Colman understands what kind of environment results in her best work. It should be loose and collaborative, with no stuffiness. That’s exactly what she got on the set of “Jimpa,” a low-budget family drama in which she stars as a filmmaker who takes her nonbinary teenager (Aud Mason-Hyde) to Amsterdam to visit her aging father (John Lithgow), a prominent gay academic. Sophie Hyde, the film’s writer and director, shared Colman’s ethos.\n\t\n\n\t“I had just done a job where I really didn’t see eye to eye with the director, which is quite unusual for me. It made me go, ‘I don’t want to do this,'” Colman says, without specifying the film in question. “Then my agent said, ‘I think you’ll really love Sophie. You’ll love the way Sophie works.'”\n\n\tAfter a get-to-know-you meeting on Zoom, Colman signed on and now says that “Jimpa” helped restore her faith in her art.\n\n\t“I was given freedom,” Colman says. “It was such a creative process. It’s the antithesis of what I had just done, where I was sort of used like a wall prop, and was told ‘chin up a bit, chin down a bit.’ You know, that’s not acting. It’s not the work I enjoy. And Sophie was the absolute opposite of that.”\n\t\n\n\tFor Hyde, whose work includes “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande,” making “Jimpa” allowed her to process her own family life. Not only did it draw on her own experiences with her parents, but Colman’s child is played by Hyde’s kid. \n\n\t“All my movies are very personal; they’re just a little bit more opaque about it,” Hyde says “This is explicit. I have named the film after my own father, and I have a character that’s a filmmaker in it, and she has a nonbinary teenager, and that non binary teenager is played by my own nonbinary teenager, Aud. So it’s deeply upfront in its connection to me. But I wanted to look at the relationship between my parents and the stories that I’ve told about them, so I could question whether those stories are the whole truth.”\n\n\t“Jimpa” premiered at 2025’s Sundance Film Festival, an event that coincided with President Donalnd Trump’s inauguration. Hyde’s big-hearted story about the LGBTQ+ community arrived just as a new American president was espousing anti-trans rhetoric from the Oval Office. Despite strong reviews and a starry cast, it took a long time for “Jimpa” to find distribution. Kino Lorber, a scrappy indie studio, eventually bought the picture and released it in theaters this month.\n\n\t“It has been a challenge,” Hyde says. “Do I think it’s political? Yeah. We watched the film industry slide away from diversity and play fairly it safe in certain ways. Queer stories don’t get much airtime. Stories by and about women don’t get much airtime. We found out last year that there was a lot of pushing queer stories to the side.”\n\n\tColman hopes that “Jimpa,” which finds Lithgow and Mason-Hyde’s characters debating their views on gender and sexuality, can encourage people to be more open and accepting. \n\n\t“There’s an awful lot of mistrust and hatred about things that there is no need to be hateful about,” Colman says. “I love the fact that this film is about learning how to listen to each other without throwing the toys out the crib. I don’t understand how you can get so upset about it when someone is different…It would be great if films about queer stories were mainstream. It would be wonderful. I don’t know why it’s not, but I think people are too nervous.”\n\n\tHyde thinks that Hollywood’s anxiety is misplaced, and that there’s a growing market for queer stories like “Jimpa.”\n\t\n\n\t“We lost so many queer characters from the TV screens,” Hyde says. “We didn’t see many queer stories told publicly. We certainly saw fewer queer directors working. And then up pops ‘Heated Rivalry’ out of nowhere, a tiny Canadian gay streaming romance and everyone just loves it. Clearly, we are craving these stories.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tTwo days after Rupert Grint’s candid and possibly sarcastic declaration — “Obviously, I’m against [fascism]” — reverberated across Potsdamer Platz and became a meme, Berlin Film Festival chief Tricia Tuttle is still cracking up.\n\n\tMidway through her second edition at the helm of the Berlinale, the combative festival director wastes no time addressing the political storm that flared on opening day and quickly threatened to eclipse the films themselves. \n\t\n\n\t“We’re like a lightning rod for political controversy,” she says in an interview with Variety. “That’s very tiring. It’s just really hard — and so important — to make sure that the filmmakers get the cut-through and it is a challenge when that becomes the only thing that we talk about.”\n\n\n\tFor Tuttle (who already released a statement on the matter over the weekend), the issue isn’t whether Berlin should be political — the festival’s identity has long been marked by civic debate — but how to avoid seeing politics dominate headlines. “It’s not that I’m trying to make the festival less political. I think politics and films about politics are a really important part of every festival, and it is also a really important part of the Berlinale,” she says. “I just want to keep the balance right and I want us to be talking about the art of cinema and supporting the market.”\n\n\tAt the halfway mark, she feels “really great about the filmmakers and the program and the market.” One of the aspects she’s most proud of is the diversity of storytelling and filmmaking within the lineup of this 76th edition, which opened with Shahrbanoo Sadat’s Afghan romantic comedy, “No Good Men” but also includes a few star-studded films, such as Karim Ainouz’s “Rosebush Pruning” with Callum Turner, Pamela Anderson and Elle Fanning, “The Moment” with Charli XCX, and Beth de Araújo’s “Josephine” with Channing Tatum and Gemma Chan, as well as Kornél Mundruczó’s “At the Sea” starring Amy Adams.\n\t\n\n\tTuttle suggests she also tried to lure Timothée Chalamet back with “Marty Supreme” after he sparked a fan frenzy with his appearance at the festival alongside Kylie Jenner for the German premiere of “A Complete Unknown” last year. “I think anyone would want to have Timothée Chalamet in a pink vest. We knew that our audience would love it and we loved the film,” she says. Even sans Chalamet, the fest has managed to deliver some glamorous snapshots, including Michelle Yeoh’s moving tribute alongside Sean Baker on opening night and appearances from Charli xcx, Turner and his pop star fiancée Dua Lipa, Isabelle Huppert (for “The Blood Countess”) and Sandra Hüller (for “Rose”).\n\n\tBecause of where the festival lands in the year, Tuttle acknowledges that the Berlinale is “not going to be overdelivering into the awards season” like Cannes and Venice. Yet, she says some Berlinale competition alumni can sometimes break through if they have the right distribution strategy, pointing to films such as Richard Linklater’s “Blue Moon” with Ethan Hawke and Mary Bronstein’s “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” starring Rose Byrne, which were held back until the fall before picking up awards momentum. With the right distribution campaign, she suggests, this year’s standouts could similarly develop “longevity and staying power” well beyond their Berlin premieres.\n\n\t“I’m not going to talk about any competition films because I don’t want to privilege anyone,” she says, but adds that there are “incredible individual contributions across all of these films.”\n\n\tRead the full Q&A below.\n\t\n\t\tWe’ve hit the midway point in the festival. How are you feeling? \t\n\n\tI’m feeling really great about the filmmakers and the program and the market has been really fantastic. I mean, obviously, I could have done without the… we’re like a lightning rod for political controversy. And that’s very tiring. It’s just really hard — and so important — to make sure that the filmmakers get the cut-through and it is a challenge when that becomes the only thing that we talk about.\n\t\n\t\tHas it been hard to toe the line between talent and press?\t\n\n\tThat’s not so hard, I think what is true is that in a climate like this, filmmakers do become nervous. Because, let’s be honest, people do get extracted and then put into different contexts or slightly different questions. And that happens quite a lot. So I think people get really, really worried about that.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHave you had conversations with filmmakers or talent where they told you they were nervous coming to Berlin because of the political conversation? \t\n\n\tNo, not before. In fact, not at all until after the jury press conference. And then, everyone else was like, “OK, what’s going on?” And the more we realized… well, I see that it’s actually a campaign of someone asking a question in the press conferences. Then people really get nervous because they’re like, “OK, it’s a gotcha moment rather than being genuinely interested in my views on the world.” As I said in my statement, it is really true that some filmmakers want to answer those questions regardless of what their film’s about, and they want to use that platform and that moment to say something about the world they think is really important. Some people don’t, because with complex issues you can’t answer someone’s question in a way that captures the complexity of what you think about something in a short answer.\n\t\n\t\tHas it been a goal of yours to try to make the festival more about cinema and less about politics?\t\n\n\tIt’s not that I’m trying to make the festival less political. I think politics and films about politics are a really important part of every festival, but it is also a really important part of the Berlinale. I just want to keep the balance right and I want us to be talking about the art of cinema and supporting the market so that films that are in the festival can get distribution and go on to have lives outside of the festival. I think one of the things that’s interesting about the Berlinale, and it’s probably always been a challenge, is that it is a festival that is many, many things. And many stakeholders want different things from the festival. So that can be a challenge. And I think the people that were calling on us to let the films cut through and maybe the politics less are not the same people who are upset right now.\n\t\n\t\tThis year’s opening night ceremony was not political at all and focused on honorary Golden Bear recipient Michelle Yeoh, who gave an emotional speech after a touching introduction from Sean Baker. How did that come to be?\t\n\n\tUsually when we ask someone to be an honorary Golden Bear recipient we also talk to them about possibilities of someone who would mean something to them. So he was someone we approached because she’d just made the film with him and she sort of fell in love with working with him. We asked him and he said yes!\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDo you already have someone in mind for next year’s honorary Golden Bear?\t\n\n\tWell, you’ll have to wait and see. Yes, we might.\n\t\n\t\tThis year’s opening film was “No Good Men” from Afghan director Shahrbanoo Sadat. Did you feel any pressure to go with something that was more splashy? \t\n\n\tNo pressure. Listen, around this festival there are always pressures from every side. Everyone wants glamour — not everyone, but a lot of people. It’s not pressure, but it is one of the realities of my job is that we need big moments, but big moments that feel authentic and truthful to us as well. So because we have an incredible jury with Wim Wenders as the president and we had Michelle and we had Sean, it also is about balance. And you can find different ways to express the personality of the festival. \n\n\tWe could have just selected something that was more obvious or we could use that moment to spotlight a film which we felt like could reach a public audience who might really enjoy it, but who wouldn’t necessarily go to that. And I think that profile felt like a chance that we could lift a film up and give it a bit of a spotlight that it deserves and that it can use really wisely now. I think the distributors have been really positive about it, they feel like it could be a little gem that they could take out to audiences. So it worked, and people really responded to it.\n\t\n\t\tOne of those big moments came from “The Moment,” Charli xcx’s mockumentary that premiered at Sundance. How did that come to be?\t\n\n\tThat was Universal and A24 talking to us. You know, we go to every rightsholder and we track what they’re making and some things make sense for timing and some things don’t. So that was one we started talking about probably late spring last year. And then you keep talking and you keep tracking, and it worked really well. Charli wanted to come as well, she wanted to back the film in a couple big festivals and it made sense for her.\n\t\n\t\tDid you try to get Timothée Chalamet back? \t\n\n\tI think anyone would want to have Timothée Chalamet in a pink vest. We knew that our audience would love it and we loved the film. But I want to play around with a couple of titles every year that are German premieres in our Special Gala section. It’s really fun for the audience. So when it makes sense and when those come up, I always have those conversations. But you don’t do them unless the talent is available either. So I had a few of those conversations this year, definitely.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat are your hopes for the next edition? \t\n\n\tI feel really proud of this program. I also loved last year, but this year I feel is more coherent and more moving in the direction that we want to move in. I think being able to, hopefully for our rightsholders, to have some successes this year and for us to be able to continue to court films to come to us because they know that they’ll have a great experience and they’ll get the right press and they’ll get buyer interest. We just have to keep building it. It is something that takes time to build, because the festival’s always been great, but it definitely lost a little bit of its connection to what’s happening at the EFM, and that’s going to take time to rebuild.\n\t\n\t\tDo you think there will be any awards contenders that come out of this year’s edition? \t\n\n\tI’m not going to talk about any competition films because I don’t want to privilege anyone, but I think there’s some incredible individual contributions across all of these films. So the right distribution campaign, which this year I think we saw with “Blue Moon” and also with “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” being held back until the autumn and then going to some great festivals and picking up on awards momentum again. That can definitely happen and I would love to see that. Because of where we are [in the year], we’re not going to be overdelivering into the awards season. But it’s nice to see films that have that kind of longevity and staying power.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n",

    "description": "\n\tTwo of the buzziest — and most star-studded — movies world premiering in competition at this year’s Berlin Film Festival, “Rosebush Pruning” and “At",
    "body": "\n\tTwo of the buzziest — and most star-studded — movies world premiering in competition at this year’s Berlin Film Festival, “Rosebush Pruning” and “At the Sea,” are from two decidedly non-Hollywood filmmakers but feature top talent from the U.S. and U.K.\n\n\t“Rosebush Pruning” — a biting family satire helmed by Brazilian auteur Karim Aïnouz that debuted on Saturday — boasts an impressive heavyweight ensemble including Callum Turner, Riley Keough, Elle Fanning, Jamie Bell, Lukas Gage, Tracy Letts and Pamela Anderson. Filmed in Spain, it follows an American family who wallow in isolation in Catalonia until they’re forced to confront their twisted dynamic.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Monday’s lineup is headlined by “At the Sea,” a drug addiction drama from Hungarian director Kornél Mundruczó. Oscar buzz is already swirling around leading lady Amy Adams. The rest of the cast comprises other big names from the U.S., the U.K. and the English-speaking cinematic world: Murray Bartlett, Brett Goldstein, Chloe East, Dan Levy, Jenny Slate and Rainn Wilson. Though Mundruczó is no stranger to the U.S. awards race — his 2020 film, “Pieces of a Woman,” earned star Vanessa Kirby a best actress nomination — “At the Sea” looks to be his most high-profile project to date.\n\n\n\tOver at the European Film Market, a number of hot projects bring together European directors and American stars — for instance, Quentin Dupieux’s Studiocanal-backed comedy “Full Phil” starring Kristen Stewart and Woody Harrelson, and Ruben Ostlund’s “The Entertainment System Is Down” starring Kirsten Dunst and Keanu Reeves that A24 acquired early on.\n\t\n\n\tThis continues a growing trend of big-name stars moving away from Hollywood productions to work with international directors, as seen with recent awards breakouts such as Coralie Fargeat’s body horror film “The Substance” starring Demi Moore and Jacques Audiard’s crime musical “Emilia Perez” with Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez; as well as Halina Reijn’s subversive erotic drama “Babygirl” with Nicole Kidman which opened at Venice in 2024.\n\n\t“Hollywood actors are looking for an alternative to blockbusters and series,” says Charles Gillibert, whose Paris-based company CG Cinéma produced Stewart’s directorial debut “The Chronology of Water” and Alice Winocour’s “Couture” starring Angelina Jolie.\n\n\t“American independent cinema has lost its momentum. It is expensive to produce and ambitious distributors willing to market it are becoming increasingly rare,” he says.\n\n\t“In Europe, we believe that culture should be partially protected from the market, as this gives authors more freedom and leads to unique works. Major actors are seeking this type of experience,” he says, adding: “Hollywood actors have also learned to build lasting careers by skillfully managing their value and income between commercial projects, arthouse films [often from Europe] and their brand contracts.”\n\n\tThe international outreach of American talent is something “Rosebush Pruning” filmmaker Aïnouz says he has definitely noticed is on the uptick since his English-language debut, 2023’s “Firebrand” starring Jude Law and Alicia Vikander.\n\n\t“There is a freedom that we can bring to English-speaking cinema that I think is attractive to actors that are working within a format which sometimes is a bit too industrial,” Aïnouz says. “I would say a decade ago, we were invited to collaborate with American and English cinema as almost like service providers. And I think what’s changing now is they’re hiring us.”\n\n\tAccording to Aïnouz, a large part of what makes working with international directors attractive to A-list stars is a risk-taking element that can often lead to critical acclaim and awards buzz. He cites Emma Stone’s long-standing collaboration with Greek helmer Yorgos Lanthimos as a prime example.\n\n\t“Risk-taking is something every actor wants to do. Every actor wants to be challenged, every actor wants to be not in their comfort zone,” he says. \n\t\n\n\tThough “Rosebush Pruning” star Fanning was not able to attend the Berlinale with the film, it’s likely because she’s on the awards trail for her most recent international collaboration: Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” which earned the American actress her first Oscar nomination. \n\n\tAïnouz sees this partnership as a win-win, as having stars attached to his films means more people will watch them. “When you say, ‘What a great ensemble, what a great cast’ — we want audiences to see our movies,” he says. “And I think it’s a really unique time where we are taken as authors to collaborate with international casts.” \n\n\tThis is also occurring as the political situation in the U.S. becomes more and more volatile under Donald Trump’s second administration. Huge stars, including George Clooney and Eva Longoria, have moved out of the U.S. citing concerns with politics and privacy.\n\n\t“There was a sense before about America being this very self-contained but also self-sustaining place,” Aïnouz says. “And I think the shattering of this, the positive side is Americans are becoming much more curious of other places in the world, other languages, other ways of storytelling.”\n\n\tWhile the trend concerns mostly dramas, American actors are also chasing lighter material from Europe. Besides Ostlund’s Palme d’Or-winning “Triangle of Sadness” and his upcoming “The Entertainment System is Down,” which are both star-studded, Quentin Dupieux is another European director who enlisted big names — Kristen Stewart and Woody Harrelson — for his next burlesque comedy, “Full Phil” which he described to Variety as an “‘Emily in Paris’ in hell.'” Dupieux’s producer, Hugo Selignac at Chi-Fou-Mi Productions said “the coolest American actors” are gravitating towards Dupieux’s films because they tend to be more daring than American comedies. “When we send them Quentin’s films, they’re struck, because when you look at American comedy today, it’s a bit dead.”\n\n\tNathanael Karmitz, whose MK2 Films is repping “At the Sea,” Albert Serra’s “Out of This World” starring Riley Keough and “Anatomy of a Fall” director Justine Triet’s next film “Fonda” with Mia Goth and Andrew Scott, says film history is filled with examples of “European directors who have imported themselves to the U.S. and American stars who have made films in France or Italy.”\n\t\n\n\tWhat’s changed today, Karmitz says, is that “it’s mainly Americans who are turning to Europe — whether it’s directors, producers or actors.” \n\n\t“We have a film industry that is naturally open to others, a regulatory system that protects artists from the law of market forces and allows them to take risks, innovate and tell stories that are free and different. This is clearly what many people are missing and what Europe still defends for the time being,” says Karmitz, whose MK2 Films also runs one of France’s leading arthouse cinema chains.\n\n\tBerlinale chief Tricia Tuttle points out that there are often many producers on these films from all over the world, such as with “At the Sea,” which has the backing of Ukrainian producer Alexander Rodnyansky as well as several from the U.S. and Hungary. \n\n\t“It is an international business now and that’s really important,” she says, adding: “Audiences are showing an appetite for films that are adventurous, that surprise them and do something different and break out of the mold.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrime Video’s epic family saga, “The House of the Sprits,” a limited series adaptation of Isabel Allende’s iconic debut novel, is set to premiere worldwide April 29 on the giant streaming platform, now reaching over 240 countries and territories.\n\n\t“This is our most ambitious Latin American original to date and it embodies our unwavering investment in elevating storytelling on the global stage,” said Javiera Balmaceda, head of local originals, Latin America, Canada & Australia, at the 76th Berlin Film Festival where Prime Video unveiled three episodes of the eight-part series.\n\t\n\n\t“’The House of the Spirits’ represents everything we believe in at Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios – our commitment to empowering visionary creators to tell culturally authentic stories that resonate globally,” she noted, adding: “Isabel Allende created a multigenerational epic about extraordinary women that has moved readers for over 40 years, and we’ve brought together extraordinary talent from across Latin America and Spain – from showrunners Francisca Alegría and Fernanda Urrejola to our incredible pan – regional cast led by Nicole Wallace, Dolores Fonzi [“Belen”] and Alfonso Herrera – to honor her vision with the scale and cinematic quality it deserves.”\n\n\n\tSpanning half a century, “The House of the Spirits” follows three generations of women – Clara, Blanca and Alba – as they navigate life in a conservative South American nation marked by class conflict, political turmoil and touches of magical realism.\n\n\tFor Alegría and Urrejola, who co-wrote the pilot they pitched to FilmNation and later, Amazon MGM Studios, it was important that it be shot in Chile. “It wasn’t the obvious choice at first, but Fernanda and I insisted and luckily Amazon and FilmNation agreed. Being able to shoot such an iconic Chilean novel in Chile was incredibly important for us — and for Andrés [Wood] as well,” said Alegria.\n\t\n\n\tWood, whose long list of credits includes the critically acclaimed “Machuca” and series “News of a Kidnapping,” boarded the project at a later date. He directed four episodes as well as served as a co-showrunner and executive producer. “It was a new experience for me — much more collaborative than what I was used to — and I’ve learned a lot. I joined after Fernanda and Francisca had already adapted the novel, so my role was mainly to help reshape it when the episode count changed. It was more about rewriting and reinforcing their vision than starting from scratch, since they had a very clear concept and I essentially came on board to support it,” he told Variety.\n\n\t“It was also creatively special because the entire leadership team was made up of women — Fernanda and Francisca as well as the producers at FilmNation and the executives at Amazon. I was, in a sense, the only male voice in the room,” he noted.\n\n\tFor Urrejola who served as co-writer, showrunner and played a key character in the show, the experience was life-changing. “The story covers very universal and profound themes. So right from the start, having to delve into those topics changes you; it makes you consider things from a different perspective. And of course, the challenge lay in the fact that for Fran and I, we are first-timers when it comes to writing a television series. So, every stage was a huge learning experience.”\n\n\tLike Allende’s novel, the series is set in an unnamed South American country so Chile is never mentioned. However, they wanted to portray a different Latin America – Chile’s distinct identity, its southern sensibility, its particular flavor. “It was also important to showcase the country’s diverse landscapes and history: from the capital at the center of the story, to the northern desert, and the southern countryside where a key part unfolds. Highlighting that geographic and cultural diversity was fundamental to us,” said Urrejola, who plays Blanca, the daughter of the clairvoyant Clara del Valle.\n\n\tCasting was their greatest challenge, as they had to find actors who could convincingly portray the same characters at different stages of their lives, ensuring continuity across the years. “We had to decide what ages to portray, when to transition between actors and how many performers each character would need,” Alegria recalled.\n\t\n\n\t“We focused on finding physical and emotional continuity so the families felt cohesive across generations. That required constant collaboration – not just between us as showrunners, but also with Amazon Studios, since many decisions had to be made by consensus,” she added.\n\n\t“One of the true highlights for me was collaborating with Manuel Alberto Claro as director of photography. It was especially meaningful because, to my knowledge, this was the first time he had come to Chile to shoot a series or feature film,” said Alegria. A Chilean based in Denmark, he has frequently worked with Lars von Trier, including on the acclaimed “Melancholia.” \n\n\tWorking with production designer Rodrigo Bazaes whose credits include “A Fantastic Woman” and Pablo Larráin’s “Spencer” and “The Count,” was also a major treat.\n\n\tFor Allende, who serves as an executive producer, the series represents not just an adaptation, but a homecoming – bringing her most beloved work back to its Chilean roots while honoring both its cultural specificity and its universal themes of love, memory and resilience. “When I saw the miniseries, I saw what it always should have been.”\n\n\tThe series is produced by FilmNation Entertainment, the multi–Oscar-winning company behind “Anora” and “Conclave.” Pablo and Juan de Dios Larráin’s Fabula provided production services. Eva Longoria (CNN Series “Searching for France”), via her Hyphenate Media Group company, and Courtney Saladino (“Jessica Jones”) serve as executive producers.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe House of the Spirits, Courtesy of Prime Video\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter a stint on the big screen, SpongeBob SquarePants is heading back to the small screen. Paramount+ announced that “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants” will make its streaming premiere on the service Feb. 17, bringing the beloved animated franchise’s latest theatrical adventure to subscribers.\n\n\tThe film marks the fourth theatrical outing for the iconic Nickelodeon character, continuing a legacy that has spanned more than two decades across television and film. In “Search for SquarePants,” SpongeBob embarks on his most ambitious journey yet, driven by a desire to prove his bravery to his demanding boss, Mr. Krabs. That determination leads him to cross paths with the Flying Dutchman, a mischievous and mysterious ghost pirate, setting off a seafaring comedy-adventure that takes SpongeBob and his friends far beyond Bikini Bottom and into the uncharted depths of the ocean.\n\t\n\n\tDirected by longtime series veteran Derek Drymon, the film expands the scale of the “SpongeBob” universe while maintaining the fast-paced humor and visual style fans expect. The core voice cast returns, led by Tom Kenny as SpongeBob, alongside Clancy Brown, Rodger Bumpass, Bill Fagerbakke, Carolyn Lawrence and Mr. Lawrence. They are joined by a notable supporting voice cast that includes George Lopez, Isis “Ice Spice” Gaston, Arturo Castro and Sherry Cola, with Regina Hall and Mark Hamill also contributing performances.\n\n\n\tFollowing its theatrical release, “Search for SquarePants” received strong critical response and currently holds Certified Fresh status on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\t\n\n\tThe film joins a deep catalog of SpongeBob content available on Paramount+, including the franchise’s previous theatrical films, spinoff series “The Patrick Star Show” and “Kamp Koral: SpongeBob’s Under Years” plus all 15 seasons of the original “SpongeBob SquarePants” series.\n",

Saxon sued Kanye, claiming he was hired in September 2021 as project manager, caretaker and 24/7 security for Kanye's Malibu property. In the lawsuit, Saxon alleges he worked brutal 16 hour days and was forced to sleep on the floor using a coat as makeshift bedding while overseeing the remodel.\n      \n    \n          Saxon claims things spiraled in November 2021 when Kanye allegedly demanded he remove all the home's windows and electricity. According to the suit, Saxon raised safety concerns, warning the moves posed \"extreme danger,\" especially after Kanye allegedly insisted on bringing large generators inside something Saxon feared could spark a fire hazard.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He also claims Kanye threatened him, saying he'd be considered \"an enemy\" if he didn't comply, and told him, \"If you don't do what I say, you're not going to work for me.\" Saxon says he refused and was fired on the spot.\n      \n    \n          Tony's suing for unpaid wages and labor code violations and potentially dragging Bianca into the courtroom drama.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Kanye has denied all allegations. In a November 2023 filing, his attorney argued that even if Saxon suffered damages -- which Kanye does not admit -- they were caused by other parties, not Kanye, and any liability should be reduced accordingly. Kanye also claimed Saxon performed work without his knowledge and asked the court to toss the lawsuit entirely.\n      \n    \n          Stay tuned ...\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

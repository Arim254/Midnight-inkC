    "body": "\n\tNetflix has served up a handful of first-look images of “Beef” Season 2, debuting on April 16.\n\n\tIn the teaser images, Charles Melton lifts weights, Cailee Spaeny looks worried on a hospital bed, Oscar Isaac drives a golf cart and Carey Mulligan considers a facelift.\n\n\t“Beef” Season 2 also stars “Minari” Oscar winner Yuh-Jung Youn and “Parasite” star Song Kang-ho. This time around, the Emmy-winning anthology series moves into the elitist world of a country club, where “chess moves of favors and coercion” circle around its Korean billionaire owner. Melton and Spaeny star as a young couple working at the club, who witness an alarming fight between their boss and his wife, played by Isaac and Mulligan. The recurring cast also includes William Fichtner as Troy, Mikaela Hoover as Ava and BM as Woosh.\n\t\n\n\tThe season will consist of eight 30-minute episodes, with creator Lee Sung Jin returning as showrunner and executive producer. Steven Yeun and Ali Wong, who starred in and executive produced Season 1, remain on board as EPs alongside Jake Schreier, Kitao Sakurai, Ethan Kuperberg and Anna Ouyang Moench, plus Mulligan, Isaac, Melton and Spaeny. The series is produced by A24.\n\n\n\t“Beef” returns more than three years after the premiere of Season 1, which followed two strangers whose lives become dangerously intertwined after a road rage incident. While the second season was not officially confirmed until October 2024, series creator Lee had hinted at turning the limited series into an anthology during its 2023 awards run.\n\n\tView all the first-look images below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNBC has set a crossover event between the three series in its “One Chicago” franchise: “Chicago Fire,” “Chicago Med” and “Chicago P.D.“\n\n\tOn March 4, the “One Chicago” series will air back-to-back episodes following one storyline. Though NBC typically airs “Chicago Med” at 8 p.m. on Wednesdays followed by “Chicago Fire” at 9 p.m. and “Chicago P.D.” at 10 p.m., the lineup will begin with “Chicago Fire” for the crossover, with “Chicago Med” airing second and “Chicago P.D.” at the end of the night.\n\t\n\n\tThe logline for the crossover reads, “Firehouse 51 is called to an airfield when a passenger jet suddenly goes silent mid-air, triggering a high-stakes emergency. Their discovery cracks open a bigger and deadlier mystery — one with consequences that could ripple far beyond the runway and put countless lives in jeopardy.”\n\n\n\tThe last time “One Chicago” had a crossover event was in January 2025, when NBC aired episodes of each series about a gas explosion at a high-rise building that left 40 people trapped underground. Before that, there hadn’t been a crossover between the three shows since 2019’s “Infection,” which followed a flesh-eating disease spreading throughout the city.\n\n\tUniversal Television produces One Chicago in association with Wolf Entertainment. Dick Wolf executive produces all three series alongside Peter Jankowski. Additional executive producers of “Chicago Fire” include Andrea Newman, Reza Tabrizi and Matt Whitney. Allen MacDonald and Stephen Hootstein are executive producers on “Chicago Med.” Gwen Sigan, Chad Saxton, Gavin Harris and Jason Beghe are executive producers on “Chicago P.D.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tRaelle Tucker, a writer-producer whose credits include “True Blood,” “Jessica Jones” and “Supernatural,” will release her debut novel, titled “Obscura.”\n\n\tThe sci-fi story asks, “What if everything we were taught that was make-believe is actually real?” Per the logline: “The island of Obscura is famed for its beaches, drugs, and hedonistic clubs.  But hidden on the northern end of the island is a secret community filled with magical beings, unicorns, centaurs, and mermen, the only place on earth these creatures can be themselves.  When Artemis, the daughter of the haven’s pot dealer and its founder, finds a human on the side of the road, tired of playing by the rules, she decides to save him — but will this one act of defiance will burn everything she holds dear to the ground?”\n\t\n\n\tTucker has spent much of her career in science fiction. Early on, she wrote for the first two seasons of the CW’s demon-hunting adventure series “Supernatural” before joining “True Blood” as a writer and producer. She then served as a writer and executive producer of “Jessica Jones” Season 2 before creating the first-ever original series on Facebook Watch, “Sacred Lies.” That show lasted two seasons and has since been acquired by Peacock. In 2023, she co-developed the Amazon Prime Video series “The Power,” based on the novel by Naomi Alderman.\n\n\n\tTucker is represented by UTA, which closed a two-book deal with Amy Einhorn at Crown (Penguin Random House). The deal includes a seven-figure pre-empt for U.S. rights. Said Einhorn: “I was completely dazzled. As soon as I read the first page, I knew I was a goner. Tucker hooked me and never let me go — and I’ve never been happier. This is a ride like no other. It’s brilliant, not something I say often (or ever, actually!). I can’t wait till the rest of the world gets to discover ‘Obscura.’”\n\t\n\n\tTucker added, “‘Obscura’ is a story I’ve been trying to figure out how to tell for decades. It fuses my wild, counterculture childhood — growing up on the island of Ibiza in a community of artists, seekers and smugglers — with my love for magical realism, genre, and world-building. ‘Obscura’ is a love letter to outsiders, weirdos and anyone who’s had to hide who they are to survive. I couldn’t ask for better partners than Amy Einhorn and Crown to bring it into the world.”\n\n\tTucker is also repped by attorney Joel McKuen.\n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSENTIMENTAL VALUE, (aka AFFEKSJONSVERDI), Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Supporting Actress Commentary (Updated Jan. 21, 2026): This is one of the categories that can be considered unstable (for now).\n\n\tAmy Madigan, Wunmi Mosaku, and Teyana Taylor feel solid for the most part. Ariana Grande has landed everywhere needed to secure an Oscar nomination, but is the most likely contender from a movie that may or may not land a best picture nomination. We have the potential double-dips of women from “Sentimental Value” — Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas and Elle Fanning — with the former benefiting from international love and making the BAFTA longlist, which often signals strong Oscar prospects. And then we have the “Marty Supreme” duo — Odessa A’zion and Gwyneth Paltrow — who are fighting for attention, and could even pull a switcharoo with one another, similar to Judd Hirsch and Judi Dench, who stepped in the last minute at the expense of their co-stars Paul Dano and Caitriona Balfe in “The Fabelmans” and “Belfast.”\n\n\tThe moral of the story is, don’t be surprised if one big name sneaks in and throws the whole thing off.\n\n\n\tThe Actor Awards nominations offered an early snapshot of where industry voters are consolidating, naming surprise nominee Odessa A’zion (“Marty Supreme”), Ariana Grande (“Wicked: For Good”), Amy Madigan (“Weapons”), Wunmi Mosaku (“Sinners”) and Teyana Taylor (“One Battle After Another”). That lineup immediately framed the category as a blend of breakouts, veterans and roles buoyed by major studio contenders.\n\n\tBAFTA’s shortlist expanded the conversation, adding international and prestige-weighted names such as Brenda Blethyn (“Dragonfly”), Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas (“Sentimental Value”), Carey Mulligan (“The Ballad of Wallis Island”), Gwyneth Paltrow (“Marty Supreme”) and Emily Watson (“Hamnet”), while reaffirming support for A’zion, Grande, Madigan, Mosaku and Taylor. \n\n\tAt the Critics Choice Awards, Amy Madigan emerged with the supporting actress win for “Weapons,” a result that carries particular significance, and shows we should be taking the veteran performer seriously in the race. In addition, “Weapons” landed on the Producers Guild of America’s list for best picture, suggesting broader support and positioning Madigan’s film as a possibility to garner more noms, such as best picture or original screenplay, which she will need if she intends to win the category.\n\n\tThe Golden Globes, which announce winners on Sunday, could shake it all up (yet again). Nominees include Emily Blunt (“The Smashing Machine”), Elle Fanning (“Sentimental Value”), Ariana Grande (“Wicked: For Good”), Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas (“Sentimental Value”), Madigan (“Weapons”) and Taylor (“One Battle After Another”). Despite a SAG snub, we think Lilleaas might surprise there, showing off the strength of “Sentimental Value” with international groups.\n\n\tIf you’re keeping count, only three women have landed with all four major acting groups: the musically inclined Grande, the genre-defying Madigan and the unforgettable Taylor. We’ll see how it all shakes out by the week’s end.\n\n\tOfficial nominations for the 98th Academy Awards will be revealed Thursday, Jan. 22. The 98th Academy Awards will take place Sunday, March 15, at the Dolby Theatre and will be televised live on ABC in more than 200 territories worldwide.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Warner Bros.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Searchlight Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Performers (Supporting Actress)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "description": "\n\tAfter nearly 10 years at sports giant ESPN, Elle Duncan departed last month to join Netflix — coming on board as the streamer’s first sports anchor.",
    "body": "\n\tAfter nearly 10 years at sports giant ESPN, Elle Duncan departed last month to join Netflix — coming on board as the streamer’s first sports anchor.\n\n\tHer first tour of duty for Netflix: This Friday’s “Skyscraper Live,” in which free-solo climber Alex Honnold will attempt to scale Taipei 101 — the tallest building in Taiwan, at 1,667 feet — without any ropes or safety equipment. Duncan and her team of commentators, she says, will be “trying to entertain people at the same time that we’re watching someone do something that could kill him.”\n\t\n\n\tWhy did she exit ESPN? In a nutshell, Duncan says she had done as much as she could do at the network, with limited opportunities given ESPN’s extensive roster of talent. Netflix made her a compelling offer for a job that will let her spread her wings beyond sports per se. The Netflix gig, she says, is “sports plus.”\n\n\n\t“You know, I did really incredible, remarkable things at ESPN that obviously were pegged to sports. But I’ve always been, and prided myself on being, a utility player and really trying to push and test my versatility,” Duncan tells Variety. “So Netflix gave me an opportunity to stay in sports, which I love and am passionate about, to do it at a major scale with major events, and then to also dabble into things like [‘Skyscraper Live’], which is sort of sports-adjacent.”\n\n\tAt Netflix, says Duncan, “I would say that the sky is the limit.” The opportunity is to “do MLB opening day and then maybe be in the running for a reality show.”\n\n\tDuncan’s agent, Matt Olson, recently told Sports Business Journal that Netflix — unlike ESPN — offers the ability “for her to be the number one [sports talent] there.” Asked if that means she is now a big fish in a small pond, Duncan laughs.\n\t\n\n\t“I definitely don’t look at it that way,” she says. It was “not like some, you know, ego boost that I needed to be at a place where I could be, you know, autonomous. Moreso that, as I sort of outlooked the next four years at ESPN — that’s what they were offering me, was a four-year deal — it was like, ‘OK, where are additional opportunities to continue to grow and expand? How do I get to keep sort of women’s basketball, which I love so much [and] continue [with] football, my favorite sport. Like how do I continue to grow into those spaces?'”\n\n\tDuncan continues, “And ESPN is well represented in all of those spaces with really incredible talent. And it is not my style at all to politic or to go into offices and try to convince management to make changes simply because I would like to take on additional roles. And they’re good there. They are not lacking talent at ESPN.\n\n\t“So I think when we sort of outlook to the future, it was like, if I was doing the exact same thing I’m doing right now for the next four years, would that be fulfilling? And I think ultimately we landed on ‘No,'” she says.\n\n\tSays Duncan, “You know, I wanted to try and push myself and do even more things. And where was the best opportunity to do that? And it was Netflix.”\n\n\tLast fall, Netflix hired Kate Jackson, one of Duncan’s producers at ESPN, as director of live sports. “She sort of joked when she left, like, ‘I’m going to come for you,'” Duncan says. “So once we were in our negotiating window, a couple of months out, we got a really, really strong offer from Netflix who knew that one of the biggest draws would be opportunity outside of sports, but also freedom and flexibility of schedule.”\n\n\tNetflix is “my main course,” Duncan explains. “They get first right of refusal… They’re my main thing, but they also know that I have a love and passion for women’s sports, which is famously not a part of their portfolio yet. And so they really are bullish on the fact that they want me to take opportunities and projects that I’m passionate about, so long as they don’t interfere with my responsibilities for them.”\n\n\tNetflix — which used to routinely dismiss its interest in acquiring sports rights — now has deals with the NFL (it aired two Christmas Day games in 2024 and 2025), Major League Baseball (for an opening night game this season and other events), and WWE’s “Raw.” In addition, Netflix inked a deal for exclusive rights in the U.S. to the 2027 and 2031 installments of the FIFA Women’s World Cup.\n\t\n\n\t“Because they have such a huge commitment to sports for the future, they really wanted to have someone that would be sort of a central figure that no matter what the sports event was,” Duncan says.\n\n\tFor “Skyscraper Live,” Duncan flew to Taipei last Saturday. Joining her to provide live commentary will be professional rock climber Emily Harrington, YouTube creator Mark Rober (whose show “CrunchLabs” is on Netflix), WWE star Seth Rollins and climbing commentator Pete Woods. The event will begin livestreaming Friday, Jan. 23, at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT (9 a.m. Taiwan time).\n\n\tDuncan’s two kids, ages 5 and 7, were seriously impressed when they learned she would be working with Rober. “I’ve introduced these kids to every famous person,” she says. When they found out their mom was going to on the air with him, “They were shook,” Duncan says. “Like, they could not believe I was going to do TV with the Mark Rober.”\n\n\tTo state the obvious, it’s not a typical sporting event. “This is like pass or fail, life or death, right?” says Duncan. “This particular event is much more about the storytelling… This is really about contextualizing the kind of person that would do something so seemingly crazy and death-defying. Like trying to humanize Alex as a person, and trying to sort of explain the art of climbing to an audience that isn’t necessarily going to understand that.”\n\n\tIn December, Duncan visited Honnold at his home in Red Rock, Nevada, and some of those conversations will be weaved throughout the “Skyscraper Live” package. Another prerecorded bit: Duncan’s producers convinced her to tackle one of the particularly “interesting” parts of the Taipei 101 climb. “They’re going to have me go out there — strapped up, obviously, not free soloing!” she says. “It should go well. Which to me is just surviving.”\n\n\tWhat happens if Honnold slips and falls? Without elaborating, Duncan says the team has “contingency plans for everything,” including for things like inclement weather or an earthquake.\n\n\tIn the short time she’s been at Netflix, Duncan says she has already seen that the company is willing to try new things. After all, because Netflix is so new to the sports field, it doesn’t have an established playbook. Netflix has “a culture of transparency, talking through things, making decisions quickly, failing fast, taking big swings, learning and moving on,” says Duncan. She’s staying in West Hartford, Connecticut (near ESPN’s Bristol headquarters), “despite the fact that with my new Netflix job, I can move anywhere.”\n\t\n\n\tDuncan joined ESPN in 2016, where she hosted the 6 p.m. ET edition of “SportsCenter” and led coverage across women’s college and pro basketball, including hosting “College GameDay” and “WNBA Countdown.”\n\n\tShe concedes that it was hard to leave ESPN. “Every place that I have left in my career, I’ve been sad to go because of the people,” Duncan says. “But I was very much at peace with the decision. You know, I really did not take the decision lightly. I waited. I looked at every possible scenario. I prayed on it. I talked about it. I talked to my therapist about it. So when I had to say goodbye, I felt really, really good about the decision itself.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMax Parker is the latest addition to Amazon Prime Video‘s “God of War” live-action TV series, Variety has learned. \n\n\tParker will appear alongside previously announced series lead Ryan Hurst and fellow cast member Teresa Palmer. Parker will star as Heimdall. As previously reported, the series will pick up with the story of the two most recent “God of War” games, in which Kratos must raise his ten-year old son Atreus while battling the gods of the Norse pantheon. \n\t\n\n\tPer the logline, “Father and son Kratos (Hurst) and Atreus embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human.” \n\n\n\tThe official description of Heimdall states that he is “The Watchman of Asgard, and one of the sons of Odin. Heimdall is a god in his own right with the special ability to anticipate what’s about to happen at any moment. Handsome and dynamic, he feels unappreciated by his father and underestimated by the rest of the family, and as a result Heimdall is constantly looking for ways to improve his position in the hierarchy and increase his stature and power.”\n\n\tParker most recently starred in the Netflix military dramedy “Boots” in the role of Sgt. Liam Robert Sullivan. He is also known for his roles in shows like “Vampire Academy,” “Emmerdale,” and “Blood, Sex & Royalty.” \n\n\tHe is repped by Thrive Talent, TalentWorks, 3 Arts Entertainment, and Myman Greenspan. \n\n\t“God of War” has received a two-season order at Amazon, with pre-production now underway in Vancouver. Ronald D. Moore is the writer, executive producer, and showrunner on “God of War” under his Tall Ship Productions banner. \n\t\n\n\tFrederick E.O. Toye will direct the first two episodes. Maril Davis of Tall Ship also executive produces alongside Cory Barlog, Naren Shankar, Matthew Graham, Asad Qizilbash, Jeff Ketcham, Hermen Hulst, Roy Lee, and Brad Van Arragon. Joe Menosky, Marc Bernardin, Tania Lotia, and Ben McGinnis serve as co-executive producers on the series. The series is co-produced by Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios in association with PlayStation Productions and Tall Ship Productions. Tall Ship is under an overall deal at Sony TV.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCatherine Hardwicke, who would later make a name for herself with the vampire romance “Twilight,” first went to Sundance in 1989. It would be the year that put the festival on the map, though Hardwicke couldn’t have known it at the time. She had studied film at UCLA and was embarking on a career as a production designer. If she needed a sign she was on the right track, she found it in Park City, Utah, at the premiere of Steven Soderbergh’s “Sex, Lies, and Videotape.”  \n\t\n\n\t“Coming from McAllen, Texas, my little hometown, I had never seen a movie like that, or movies like any of the ones at Sundance,” Hardwicke says. “I didn’t know what independent films were — my head almost exploded. I was so excited to think that stories that were so personal and intimate could be put on the screen. That just lodged into my brain, and I wanted to make something like that.” \n\n\n\t“Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” a blistering examination of voyeurism and infidelity, was a sensation, becoming one of the first contemporary art-house films to break into the mainstream. And Sundance’s profile rose with it, encouraging generations of aspiring moviemakers to max out their credit cards and bet it all on the chance of getting their movies into the festival.  \n\n\tOver the next four decades, Sundance, which was founded by Robert Redford in 1978 to help innovative filmmakers navigate a business that was often hostile to their visions, served as the launching pad for some of the boldest creative forces in movies. It’s an alumni network that includes Quentin Tarantino (“Reservoir Dogs”), Darren Aronofsky (“Pi”), Ryan Coogler (“Fruitvale Station”), Wes Anderson (“Bottle Rocket”), Ava DuVernay (“Middle of Nowhere”) and Hardwicke, who debuted her first feature, “Thirteen,” a coming-of-age drama about a troubled teen, at the festival in 2003.  \n\t\n\n\t“We wouldn’t even have 90% of the amazing indie films out there if it weren’t for Sundance,” Hardwicke says. “And I never would have thought that a movie like ‘Thirteen’ could be made if I hadn’t been to Sundance before.” \n\n\tFor many artists, agents, critics and studio executives, Sundance is synonymous with Park City, the ski resort that has hosted the festival for nearly 45 years. The town’s sloping main street, nestled in the craggy Wasatch Range, has practically become a symbol of the annual film gathering.  \n\n\t“It’s so magical,” says James Wan, director of “Saw.” “It’s like movie camp for movie lovers. It’s the yardstick by which I measure all other festivals.” \n\n\tBut that’s about to change. In 2027, Sundance will leave the mountain town for Boulder, Colorado, lured by tax breaks and subsidies that it needs to continue operating. That’s left some people concerned that the festival is sacrificing a vital part of its identity.  \n\n\t“I worry about it going,” says Ann Dowd, an actress who made a name for herself with the 2012 film “Compliance,” which premiered at Sundance. “It’s not as Robert Redford intended it to be when he founded it. It sounds like it could become something else entirely. Park City is such a special place.” \n\n\t But others believe that Sundance has outgrown the town, which has become a glossy vacation destination for the 1% instead of a shaggy getaway for artsy types. They argue there’s not enough housing, and what’s available has become prohibitive (hotel rooms can fetch thousands of dollars a night). If Sundance’s mission is to provide a forum for emerging filmmakers, why host it in a place that most of them can’t afford to visit?  \n\n\t“Hats off to them for moving,” says Tom Bernard, co-founder of Sony Pictures Classics. “I’m excited to leave. It’s definitely not the Park City I used to visit in the early ’90s. The prices are through the roof, and the indie filmmakers that used to roam these streets are disappearing.”  \n\n\tNot too long ago, films as varied as “Manchester by the Sea,” “Little Miss Sunshine” and “The Blair Witch Project” debuted to raves at the festival before being embraced by the wider public. Sundance remains the biggest name in independent filmmaking, but the festival, like the art form it celebrates, is operating in a much more perilous environment than in its heyday of the ’90s and early aughts. The edgy, distinctive movies that continue to find a home at Sundance are struggling at the box office, with recent festival acquisitions such as “Sorry, Baby,” “Lurker” and “Twinless” barely registering when they opened in theaters. “Train Dreams,” arguably the most successful of last year’s Sundance sales, was snapped up by Netflix and mostly seen on streaming, a sign of how much the business has shifted.  \n\t\n\n\t“Consumer tastes have changed,” says Scott Shooman, head of IFC Entertainment Group. “And what consumers want to see is different than what Sundance is programming. Other festivals aggressively court more commercial films.” \n\n\tAs Sundance prepares for one final hurrah in Park City, many filmmakers and executives are reminiscing about the good times they had in the mountain town and reflecting on its singular appeal. For them, the remoteness, as well as the wintry weather that makes getting around a slippery, sloshy ordeal, enrich the experience. Instead of haute couture, most celebrities are decked out in snow boots and parkas, lending the event an air of informality.  \n\n\t“Somehow that ends up being my most vivid, enduring memory of the festival — the goddamn snow,” says Karyn Kusama, director of 2000’s “Girlfight,” starring Michelle Rodriguez. “I remember trudging along through the sleet and snow. It’s a hard festival for that reason, but it’s so worth it when you get to your destination. Which, in a weird way, is just like a metaphor for indie film: You really have to do a lot of trudging through these inhospitable conditions to get to that destination of finally seeing those films come to fruition.” \n\n\tKusama, whose movie won the Grand Jury Prize that year, is one of many artists whose careers were launched in Park City. Jay Duplass remembers getting his short film “This Is John,” a seven-minute drama that he shot with his brother, Mark, using their parents’ video camera, into the festival. It cost them $3 to make, or the cost of the tape they used to film it.  \n\n\t“I was at the end of my rope when I got the call that we’d been accepted,” Duplass remembers. “I was 29 years and 10 months old, and I had given myself until I turned 30 to fuck around with movies until I sucked it up and did something else. Everything changed with Sundance. We got agents and a lawyer, and all of that led to our first feature.”  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPark City, Utah, in January, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDavid Becker/Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGlen Basner, the head of FilmNation, remembers sitting in the Eccles Theatre for the Sundance premiere of 2017’s “The Big Sick.” The $5 million comedy about a Pakistani comic (Kumail Nanjiani) whose Waspy girlfriend becomes gravely ill was the first film that Basner had fully financed. It entered the festival looking to land distribution, but Basner knew that he could only secure a rich deal if the audience responded in a big way.  \n\t\n\n\t“There’s a scene in the movie when Ray Romano asks Kumail what he thought about 9/11 and Kumail goes, ‘We lost 19 of our best guys that day,’” Basner remembers. “Well, the crowd went wild. I remember being thrilled because it went over so well. But even more than that, I felt extreme relief because I wasn’t going to bankrupt the company.” After an all-night bidding war, “The Big Sick” sold to Amazon for $12 million.  \n\n\tSundance alums who were fortunate enough to have their films become one of the festival’s hot sales say that the alpine dealmaking, often hammered out late into the evening and through the following morning, are an exhausting, yet exhilarating experience. Lulu Wang, one of those lucky directors, remembers the producer of her 2019 film “The Farewell” summoning her shortly after its Park City premiere.\n\n\t“I get a call at 10 o’clock that said, ‘Get dressed. There’s a car coming to pick you up,’ and then I got whisked away to this mansion where a bunch of people started coming in and pitching us,” Wang recalls. “There’s something that’s so beautiful, because we’re now in a time where there’s a lack of urgency around films, because you can watch them on streaming. It’s ‘I’ll watch it when I get to it.’ So the urgency of having to negotiate late at night was amazing.”\n\n\tStill others trace personal and professional milestones back to the mountain resort. Josephine Decker has had several films play at Sundance, including 2020’s “Shirley,” which won the Special Jury Award for Auteur Filmmaking. But the festival is particularly meaningful to Decker because it’s where she met her future partner, Malik Vitthal, in 2011. They reconnected three years later when he invited her to stay in a house he’d rented in Park City. “We first got together at Sundance,” she says. “My two children exist because of Sundance.” \n\n\tLast year, Decker and Vitthal left the kids with their grandparents and returned to the town where they first met — not to premiere a new movie, but to experience Sundance as film lovers. “We spent our anniversary watching movies for nine hours a day and just getting artistically inspired,” she says. “The only problem is we have very different tastes, so we didn’t spend much time together.” \n\t\n\n\tOthers remember not only the big premieres or the intense conversations with fellow filmmakers, but the wild nights and blowout parties.  \n\n\t“We had the classic thing when we would rent a cabin with 10 people there, and then you invite three people to party and of course 350 come and you have to call the police on your own party,” Hardwicke says. “New Line executives are throwing up in your hot tub. You know, all those outrageous you-gotta-love-it stories.” \n\n\tDespite its international renown, Sundance is a ragtag operation. Instead of hosting premieres in movie palaces, screenings are held in dozens of makeshift theaters, with screens erected in libraries, motels and school auditoriums. But that has its own allure for the filmmakers.  \n\n\t“Sometimes you’re like, ‘Damn, I wish it sounded better or that the projector was better,’” says Cooper Raiff, the director of “Cha Cha Real Smooth.” “But mostly it adds to the charm. I’ll never forget watching this Jeff Buckley documentary in that theater in the library. It was a great film, and it was followed by a musical performance of ‘Hallelujah.’ And it was so fulfilling. It didn’t matter that the theater was shitty; what mattered was sharing that experience with an audience.”  \n\n\tRaiff and other longtime Sundance-goers hope that the festival’s indie spirit won’t dim when it uproots for Colorado. And they’re happy that Sundance’s leadership opted to host the event in a college town that also boasts natural beauty. When the organization announced it was accepting bids for a new home, the other two finalists were Cincinnati and a combination of Park City and Salt Lake City. Given those options, many Sundance alums are relieved by the choice of Boulder.  \n\n\t“I would be concerned if Sundance was moving to a major city that was crazy spread out,” says Decker. “If Sundance was moving to L.A., it would be like ‘Oh, no, it’s the end!’ But they selected another intimate town that has the kind of small walkable community where you’ll be bumping into artists every time you turn a corner.” \n\n\tSundance is so much more than its geographic location. Through its labs and events, it plays a vital role in helping filmmakers fine-tune their visions and showcases their work. Not only does it connect them with a larger creative community, but in many cases they come away with distribution for their films or backing for their next projects.  \n\t\n\n\t“I just hope they maintain what makes Sundance special,” says Cathy Yan, director of “Dead Pigs,” which debuted at the 2018 edition. “As special and unique as Park City was to the Sundance brand, its mission is much more important. There’s so much corporate consolidation in Hollywood. We need festivals like Sundance that champion new voices and independent artists now more than ever.”  \n",

    "body": "\n\tPhil Collins is speaking out about his health issues, revealing that he recently underwent five knee surgeries and developed kidney problems from drinking. In a new interview with BBC Two, Collins elaborated on the chronic ailments that previously prompted him to retire from performing following Genesis’ final tour in 2022.\n\n\t“It’s an ongoing thing,” Collins, 74, told BBC Two’s Zoe Ball as part of the TV special “Phil Collins Eras: In Conversation,” a five-part series that concludes on January 26. “I have a 24 hour live-in nurse, um, to make sure I take my medication as I should do. Uh, I’ve had challenges with my knee — I had everything that could go wrong with me did go wrong with me. You know, I mean, I got COVID in hospital my kidneys started to back up, you know, everything that start, that could all seemed to sort of converge at the same time.”\n\t\n\n\tHe discussed problems he’s had with his knee and the surgeries he’s undergone to fix it: “I had five operations on my knee now I’ve got a knee that works and I can walk, albeit with assistance, you know, crutches or whatever.”\n\n\n\tCollins has been struggling with health issues for nearly two decades, as he suffered a spinal injury in 2007 that caused severe nerve damage and developed the condition “drop foot” after a back operation that makes it difficult to walk. In the interview, he explained that drinking led to problems with his kidneys and that he recently celebrated two years of sobriety.\n\n\t“I’d probably been drinking too much, and so my kidneys were messed up, you know, I mean, I enjoyed coming off tour. Coming off the road, but I thought, right, I’m gonna do all those things that I, I couldn’t do,” he said. “I stopped drinking at six o’clock in the evening. I wasn’t one of those guys that sort of stayed up all night drinking, you know, I’d, I’d drink during the day, but I guess I had too much of it. I was never drunk, although I fell over a couple of times. But, it is just one of those things that happened and it all caught up with me and I spent months in hospital.”\n\t\n\n\tCollins, who also suffers from type 2 Diabetes, bid farewell to the drum kit during Genesis’ final tour, singing from a seated position while his son handled percussion. In an interview in early 2025, he said that he had no inclination to return to a recording studio due to his health issues, and had previously said in 2021 that he could “barely hold a stick with this hand.”\n\n\tBut after Ball pressed him to get back in the studio, Collins responded, “I’ve got some things that are half formed or were never finished, and a couple of things that were finished, which I like, so you know. Maybe life in the old dog. Yeah. You’ll see.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe nominees for 2026 Ambies have been announced, with 10 podcasts — including “Call Her Daddy,” “SmartLess,” “Crime Junkie,” “Pod Save America” and “Pablo Torre Finds Out” — vying for the top honor of Podcast of the Year.\n\n\tThe 6th Annual Awards for Excellence in Audio (aka the Ambies) are presented by the Podcast Academy, an independent professional podcast organization. This year, the org received more than 1,600 submissions, the most entries since the inaugural Ambies in 2021.\n\t\n\n\tThe 10 shows nominated for the Ambies’ Podcast of the Year aware are: “Call Her Daddy,” “Crime Junkie,” “Pablo Torre Finds Out,” “Pod Save America,” “Question Everything,” “Reveal,” “SmartLess,” “The Last Invention,” “The Mel Robbins Podcast” and “Wisecrack.”\n\n\n\tThe winners will be announced at the 2026 Ambies ceremony, taking place Monday, Feb. 23. This year, the podcast awards ceremony for the first time will be presented as part of On Air Fest at the Arlo Williamsburg hotel in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n\tThe Ambies celebrate excellence in podcasting while also “elevating the awareness and status of podcasts as a powerful, personal medium for entertainment, information, storytelling and expression,” according to the Podcast Academy. The ceremony will honor 227 nominees across 33 categories, including six new categories: podcast advertiser innovator award, best ad read, best branded podcast, best emerging podcast, best use of video in a podcast, and the Vanguard Podcaster of the Year.\n\n\tWinners in 32 categories will be selected by the full voting membership of the Podcast Academy. The Vanguard Podcaster of the Year award will be determined separately by the inaugural Vanguard Jury, which will be announced at a later date ahead of the Ambies. \n\t\n\n\t“This year’s Ambies nominees highlight the range and ambition of today’s podcast creators,” said Christy Mirabal, chair of the Podcast Academy, in a statement. “They’re pushing the medium forward and finding new ways to tell stories that resonate deeply with listeners. They spotlight new voices, push boundaries, and expand far beyond audio alone.”\n\n\tTHE AMBIES 2026 FULL LIST OF NOMINEES\n\n\tPodcast of the Year\n\n\nCall Her Daddy\nCrime Junkie\nPablo Torre Finds Out\nPod Save America\nQuestion Everything\nReveal\nSmartLess\nThe Last Invention\nThe Mel Robbins Podcast\nWisecrack\n\n\n\n\tBest Ad Read\n\n\nBegin Again with Davina\nConan O’Brien Needs a Friend\nReality Gays with Mattie and Poodle\nRevisionist History\nThe Weekly Show with Jon Stewart\nWe Need To Talk\nWoo Woo with Rachel Dratch\n\n\n\n\tBest Branded Podcast\n\n\nMoneywise\nOprah’s Book Club: Presented by Starbucks\nSesame Street: Cookie Monster Mysteries\nThings Bakers Know\nTomorrow’s Cure\nTraveling with AAA\nWhat The Fraud?\n\n\n\n\tBest Business Podcast\n\n\nBusiness Wars\nLead Balloon\nMasters of Scale\nMorning Brew Daily\nNerdWallet’s Smart Money Podcast\nThe Indicator from Planet Money\nThe Journal\n\n\n\n\tBest Comedy Podcast\n\n\nConan O’Brien Needs a Friend\nLas Culturistas with Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang\nMurder at the Patel Motel\nSmartLess\nThe Bald and The Beautiful with Trixie and Katya\nThe Big Pitch with Jimmy Carr\nWisecrack\n\n\n\n\tBest DIY Podcast\n\n\nabandoned: The All-American Ruins Podcast\nBlack Is America\nClimate Shifted\nCulture Kids\nRedacted History\nThe Integrated Schools Podcast\nTwice Displaced\n\n\n\n\tBest Documentary Podcast\n\n\nAl Jazeera Investigates – 36 July: Uprising in Bangladesh\nIVF Disrupted: The Kindbody Story\nLatino USA\nNot a Very Good Murderer\nThe Con: Kaitlyn’s Baby\nThe Poppy Day Bomb\nWhat Could Go Wrong?\n\n\n\n\tBest Emerging Podcast\n\n\nCrook County\nDebt Heads\nHow Is This Better?\nLawless Planet\nRaising Us\nThis Guy Sucked\nThis News Is So Gay\n\n\n\n\tBest Entertainment Podcast\n\n\nIconic Origins: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\nReLiving Single\nSkip Intro\nThe Bop Bible\nThe Plot Thickens: Cleopatra\nTwenty Thousand Hertz\nYou’ll Hear It\n\n\n\n\tBest Fiction Podcast\n\n\nMurder on Mars\nPurple Heart Warriors\nRed for Revolution\nStanLand\nThe Good Life\nTwo Thousand and Late\nYou Feeling This\n\n\n\n\tBest History Podcast\n\n\nAftermath: Hunt for the Anthrax Killer\nCharlie’s Place\nDivision Street Revisited\nGod’s Banker\nHISTORY This Week\nMaking Gay History: The Nazi Era\nOur Ancestors Were Messy\n\n\n\n\tBest Indie Podcast:\n\n\nDebt Heads\nOur Ancestors Were Messy\nRadio Diaries\nStitch Please\nTaboo Science\nThe Fight of My Life: Escaping Scam City\nWorst Club Ever (A Child Loss Podcast)\n\n\n\n\tBest Indie Podcast Host or Hosts:\n\n\nJamie Feldman & Rachel Webster – Debt Heads\nDusty Weis – Lead Balloon\nAnna DeShawn – Queer News\nJamie Kern Lima – The Jamie Kern Lima Show\nZibby Owens – Totally Booked with Zibby\nMaya Guice – White Water\nAllie Kramer – Worst Club Ever (A Child Loss Podcast)\n\n\n\n\tBest Interview Podcast:\n\n\nAll There Is with Anderson Cooper\nDeath, Sex & Money\nHasan Minhaj Doesn’t Know\nLives Less Ordinary\nOn with Kara Swisher\nThe Oprah Podcast\nWe’re Not Kidding with Mehdi & Friends\n\n\n\n\tBest Knowledge, Science or Tech Podcast:\n\n\nLevittown\nLong Shadow: Breaking the Internet\nRadiolab\nShell Game\nShort Wave\nTo Catch a Thief: China’s Rise to Cyber Supremacy\nWe The Children – Kids Talk Climate Change\n\n\n\n\tBest News & Politics Podcast:\n\n\nConsider This\nFace Off: The U.S. vs China\nLong Shadow: Breaking the Internet\nPod Save America\nRadio Atlantic\nReveal\nVibe Check\n\n\n\n\tBest Original Score and Music Supervision:\n\n\nBone Valley, Season 3, Graves County\nDC High Volume: Batman\nLulu’s Late Night\nDaniel Brunelle – Murder at the Patel Motel\nTangelene Bolton – Scam Factory\nOded Lev-Ari and Chris Tarry – The Left Arm Treasure Society\nSandro Morales, Patrick Rodman, and Eric P.

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          Sources familiar with the situation tell TMZ ... the cast -- Karamo, Antoni Porowski, Tan France, Jonathan Van Ness, and Jeremiah Brent -- were filming Season 10 last summer in Washington, D.C., when Karamo brought his mom to set for a visit one day. We're told she was given production headphones and observed filming from nearby.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          At one point, Karamo stepped away from the group ... and while he was gone, Antoni, Tan and Jonathan were overheard speaking negatively about Karamo, including criticizing certain lifestyle choices he makes. Unfortunately for the three guys, Karamo's mom heard the entire conversation through her headphones and later told her son what was said.\n      \n\n          Our sources say the incident created an immediate rift, and Karamo has been on the outs with Antoni, Tan and Jonathan ever since.\n      \n    \n          Jeremiah Brent appears to be the only castmate Karamo remains close with, as he's the only one Karamo still follows on Instagram.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The tension spilled into public view Tuesday during Season 10 press day, when Karamo was noticeably absent as the rest of the cast made the morning show rounds.\n      \n    \n          We're told when Netflix PR arrived at \"CBS Mornings,\" CBS producers informed Netflix reps Karamo would no longer be appearing after his assistant emailed the show about his absence.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    NBC\n          \n    \n          As we previously reported ... Karamo's assistant cited mental and emotional abuse, saying Karamo had been advised by his therapist to protect his peace. Karamo later appeared in a video message on \"TODAY,\" telling fans he was choosing self-love while promising viewers would love every minute of the milestone 10th season.\n      \n    \n          We’ve reached out to reps for Karamo, Antoni, Tan, Jonathan and Jeremiah … so far, no word back.\n      \n      ",

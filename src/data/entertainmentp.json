    "body": "\n\tThe Horror Section and WeShort have unveiled the winners of HorrorShorts, a global competition for original horror short film scripts created to champion bold new voices and develop original intellectual property in the horror genre.\n\n\tThe inaugural competition drew more than 100 submissions from filmmakers across Spain, Italy, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, Mexico, Argentina, France, India, and Brazil. Following a selection process, three screenplays were reviewed and chosen by The Horror Section and WeShort teams for their originality, craft, and cinematic potential.\n\t\n\n\tHorrorShorts Winners\n\n\n\t1st Place: WeShort Originals Full Production Award went to “Burn It All” by Domenico De Feudis & Giulio Rizzo. Its story follows a young couple that buys a confiscated vineyard, only to face the true cost: defying a mafia monster just released from life in prison. It was awarded a $25,000 grand prize: funding both rights acquisition and full production of the short film.\n\n\t2nd Place: WeShort Originals Co-Production Award went to “Locust Grove” by Chris Guerrero and Ryan Dee Gilmour. When their daughter is given months to live, a desperate young couple hires a witch to perform a dangerous healing ritual in the East Kentucky hills. It was awarded a $10,000 prize. The award supports both the rights acquisition and co-production of a short film\n\n\t3rd Place: WeShort Originals IP Award went to “Teacher Andy” by Giulia C.Borges and Federico Fasulo. It follows a kindergarten teacher on the verge of menopause who struggles to look over the restless children in her class, until an old metronome grants her a dark power. It was awarded a $2,500 prize. This award is designed for the acquisition of a complete rights package for the screenplay, without including production\n\t\n\n\tThe winning scripts will be produced as official WeShort Originals, with the opportunity to be optioned for short-to-feature development by The Horror Section, a media company founded by Eli Roth focused on genre fare. Production will begin in the first quarter of 2026\n\n\tHorrorShorts Finalists“Grindhouse Nation” by Nestor López Ferreira“Fillers” by Adam Ethan Crow“Where Goes the Night” by Daniela De Francesco“The Exhibition” by Lauren Kent“No One’s Home” by Alexander M.Edwards and Matteo Andreolli“Canceled” by Camilo De Cabo“The Bodycount Challenge” by Justin Gilbert\n\n\t“HorrorShorts was an idea that emerged from my very first conversation with Eli Roth, when we met and began discussing the strategic partnership between WeShort and The Horror Section,” said Alex Loprieno, Founder & CEO of WeShort. “From the beginning, our shared goal was to create an observatory to discover new talent and original IP, starting from short films that could potentially evolve into successful feature films. This first edition of HorrorShorts clearly demonstrated how ready and eager talented filmmakers are to put their work out into the world.”\n\n\t“It’s been a pleasure to work alongside the WeShort team to build HorrorShorts, creating a direct line to the next wave of filmmakers,” said Roth. “The competition shows how many bold, original ideas are out there, and we’re thrilled to support these filmmakers’ visions, and give them the platform to show their talent.”\n\n\tLoprieno added: “The selection process was the most exciting part, and I was personally involved alongside the same WeShort team that, over the past five years, has curated more than 3,500 short films and co-produced and distributed 25 WeShort Originals. Choosing the finalists and winners was genuinely difficult, because we could see real value in every single project. I want to congratulate not only the winners and finalists, but also all the filmmakers who took the risk and submitted their work. No success ever happens without taking that first step.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNexstar has launched Nexstar Brand Studio to produce custom content for marketers with an emphasis on material that leverages the station group’s massive local and national footprint.\n\n\tAmong the first projects to come from the unit is “My American Story,” an interstitial campaign that features everyday Americans telling their stories of triumph and patriotism. The spots are designed to work for marketers on a local basis, given Nexstar’s reach with 200 TV stations across the country, plus the CW Network, CW Sports and News Nation. The overarching sponsor for the campaign is automobile windshield replacement firm Safelite.\n\t\n\n\tThe unit is led by Dan Lanzano, Nexstar’s president of advertising sales, and Laura Lamattina, Nexstar’s senior VP of marketing solutions and brand partnerships. \n\n\n\t“When you think about the marketplace, what advertisers want is personalization at scale. We think that can mean multiple things. We can create a  content message that’s different for different parts of the country. We can deliver multiple messages across 160 markets and then amplify that across our whole network,” Lanzano told Variety.\n\n\tOther major initiatives designed to be modular and adaptable to various advertiser demands include “Main Street USA,” a series on News Nation focusing on business success stories that have revitalized small towns; “Celebrating Main Street on Route 66,” a nostalgic look at the fabled highway that stretches from Chicago to Los Angeles. Also planned are specials for Veterans Day , the Boston Pops Fourth of July Fireworks Spectacular and a NASCAR street race at the Coronado Naval Base.\n\t\n\n\tWith the nation’s 250th birthday approaching next year, the big focus is on Americana and celebrating everyday Americans. Nexstar has also established MyAmericanStory.TV digital hub to collect the spots and also encourage viewers to upload their own short videos.\n\n\t“The beauty of having creative teams across the country is that we can be really agile in executing,” Lamattina told Variety. “We have a core team of writers, producers, editors and designers. And then at our disposal we have these great creative production teams across our stations. We can tap into those when it makes sense. That is a very rare resource.”\n\n\tNexstar’s move is one of many in recent years that reflects dramatic changes in how marketers want to reach consumers. Even local and linear TV outlets have to elevate the game beyond booking 30-second spots.\n\n\tNexstar Brand Studio is “purposely built for partnership and curation to create the right message, to create the right for the right platform for an advertiser to break through,” Lanzano said. “This is about marrying the art and the sciences of content and distribution at scale.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrime Video has released the trailer for Guy Ritchie’s “Young Sherlock,” a new mystery series following the classic literary detective through his early days of sleuthing. All eight episodes premiere on March 4.\n\n\tAccording to an official logline, the series follows “the origin story of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s beloved detective in an explosive re-imagining of this iconic character’s early days. Sherlock Holmes is a disgraced young man – raw and unfiltered – when he finds himself wrapped up in a murder case that threatens his liberty. His first ever case unravels a globe-trotting conspiracy that changes his life forever. Unfolding in 1870s Oxford and adventuring abroad, the series will expose the early antics of the anarchic adolescent who is yet to evolve into Baker Street’s most renowned resident.”\n\t\n\n\tHero Fiennes Tiffin stars as the titular investigator. Other cast members include Dónal Finn (”The Wheel of Time”), Zine Tseng (”3 Body Problem”), Joseph Fiennes (”The Handmaid’s Tale”), Natascha McElhone (”Halo”), Max Irons (”Condor”) and Colin Firth (”The King’s Speech”).\n\n\n\tThis is not Ritchie’s first delve into the world of Sir Doyle. In 2009, he released the film “Sherlock Holmes,” starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. He released a sequel, “Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,” in 2011.\n\n\tRitchie directs the first two episodes and serves as executive producer. The series was created for television by Matthew Parkhill, who also serves as showrunner and executive producer alongside Dhana Rivera Gilbert, Marc Resteghini, Simon Maxwell, Ivan Atkinson, Simon Kelton, Colin Wilson, and co-executive producers Harriet Creelman and Steve Thompson.\n\t\n\n\tCheck out the trailer below. \n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTrump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced a merger agreement with nuclear fusion company TAE Technologies in an all-stock deal valued at more than $6 billion.\n\n\tUpon closing, shareholders of each company will own approximately 50% of the combined company on a fully diluted equity basis. President Donald Trump indirectly owns more than 114 million shares of TMTG, representing a majority stake. Before taking office in January 2025, he transferred those shares to a revocable trust whose sole trustee is his son Donald Trump Jr., according to CNBC.\n\t\n\n\tTMTG and TAE Technologies said the merger has been approved by their boards of directors and is expected to close “in mid-2026,” subject to customary closing conditions, including shareholder and regulatory approvals. Upon closing, Trump Media & Technology Group will be the holding company for Truth Social — which is the U.S. president’s primary social-media outlet — Truth+, Truth.Fi, TAE, TAE Power Solutions and TAE Life Sciences, among other businesses.\n\n\n\tIn 2026, the combined company plans to site and begin construction on the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant with a 50-megawatt capacity, subject to required approvals. “Additional fusion power plants are planned and expected to be 350–500 MWe,” the companies said. “Fusion power plants are expected to provide economic, abundant, and dependable electricity that would help America win the AI revolution and maintain its global economic dominance.”\n\n\tAs part of the transaction, TMTG has agreed to provide up to $200 million of cash to TAE at signing and an additional $100 million is available upon initial filing of the Form S-4 with the SEC.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to TAE, it has built and safely operated five fusion reactors and raised more than $1.3 billion in private capital to date from Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, Goldman Sachs, Sumitomo Corporation of Americas, NEA, the family offices of Addison Fischer, the Samberg Family, Charles Schwab, and others. Based in Foothill Ranch, California, TAE says it has more than 400 employees, including “62 PhD holders.”\n\n\tThe combined company’s board of directors will comprise two directors from TMTG (Nunes and Donald J. Trump Jr.), two directors from TAE (Binderbauer and Schwab), and five other independent directors to be selected and named later.\n\n\tTMTG, which went public in March 2024 in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), had total financial assets of $3.1 billion as of the end of the third quarter of 2025, including cash, restricted cash, short-term investments, trading securities and digital assets.\n\n\tIn Q3 2025, TMTG reported net sales of $972,900 and a $54.8 million net loss in the third quarter, including $54.1 million in non-cash losses from changes in the fair value of digital assets, non-cash interest expenses, non-cash stock-based compensation, unrealized losses on trading securities and unexpired option contracts, and depreciation and amortization, according to the company’s quarterly statement with the SEC. \n\n\tTrump Media said in reporting Q3 results that it is “earning significant income from its unique bitcoin strategy.” The company said it generated $15.3 million of realized income during the third quarter from option premiums associated with its bitcoin-related securities as well as $13.4 million of interest income from other financial holdings. According to TMTG, this resulted in $61.1 million in combined realized income from both sources year to date through Sept. 30, 2025.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWomen directors aren’t a new concept. But the surge of actresses stepping behind the camera? That’s this year’s plot twist. From Oscar winners Kate Winslet and Scarlett Johansson to breakout talents making bold pivots, it’s a watershed moment for female performers turned filmmakers.\n\n\tThis rising generation is following a path forged by pioneers like Ida Lupino and Elaine May. Then there was Barbra Streisand, who directed and starred in “Yentl,” and earned a best picture nod for “The Prince of Tides.” More recently, Greta Gerwig became the only director to have her first three films nominated for best picture, a feat that redefined what’s possible for actresses making the jump. So who among this year’s crop will deliver the next “Barbie?”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Chronology of Water\rDirector: Kristen Stewart\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndrejs Strokins\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The Chronology of Water” (The Forge)\n\n\n\tTHE PROJECT\n\n\tKristen Stewart’s directorial debut adapts Lidia Yuknavitch’s memoir — a coming-of-age odyssey steeped in trauma and artistic awakening.\n\n\tTHE IMPACT\n\n\tFew actresses have rebranded with Stewart’s ferocity. Her post-“Twilight” résumé reads like a manifesto of risk. This is her clearest creative declaration yet: a work unafraid of confrontation or mess, with strong turns from her cast.\n\n\tVERDICT\n\n\tAn astounding first feature: raw, queer, elliptical and defiantly personal. That doesn’t make it wildly commercial, but that’s not the point.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDON’T LET’S GO TO THE DOGS TONIGHT, director Embeth Davidtz, on set\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Sony Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight” (Sony Pictures Classics)\n\t\n\n\tTHE PROJECT\n\n\tCharacter actress Embeth Davidtz — whose work spans “Schindler’s List,” “Junebug” and “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” — makes her directorial debut adapting Alexandra Fuller’s memoir.\n\n\tTHE IMPACT\n\n\tDavidtz channels decades of nuanced supporting work into a story about childhood, colonialism and fractured identity. Her leap signals a widening path for mid-career actresses.\n\n\tVERDICT\n\n\tA raw, literary and visually intimate debut from someone who spent years mastering the art of doing more with less.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEleanor the Great\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSony Pictures Classics\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Eleanor the Great” (Sony Pictures Classics)\n\n\tTHE PROJECT\n\n\tAfter decades as one of Hollywood’s most bankable stars, Scarlett Johansson makes her directing debut with a drama centered on reinvention after loss, anchored by 96-year-old June Squibb.\n\n\tTHE IMPACT\n\n\tJohansson joins peers like Bradley Cooper and Gerwig in converting superstardom into creative control. Her involvement brings instant visibility to a story not often told.\n\n\tVERDICT\n\n\tA crucial test of whether Johansson’s narrative instincts translate beyond performance. The reviews suggest they do.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGOODBYE JUNE, from left: Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Goodbye June” (Netflix)\n\n\tTHE PROJECT\n\n\tOscar winner Kate Winslet, who has spent three decades at the center of prestige filmmaking, gets behind the camera for the first time with a family drama written by her son, Joe Anders.\n\n\tTHE IMPACT\n\n\tWinslet has long been producing her own work and mentoring rising filmmakers. Her directorial voice promises an actor-first sensibility, reflected in turns from Helen Mirren and Andrea Riseborough.\n\n\tVERDICT\n\n\tA debut with pedigree baked in, especially given Winslet’s reputation for fearlessness and Netflix’s backing.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRENTAL FAMILY, from left: Brendan Fraser, Shannon Gorman\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Searchlight Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Rental Family” (Searchlight Pictures)\n\n\tTHE PROJECT\n\n\tA former actress now emerging as a directorial force, Hikari brings an observational lens to this drama starring Brendan Fraser as a lonely American adrift in Tokyo.\n\n\tTHE IMPACT\n\n\tHikari represents a parallel phenomenon: actresses pivoting early to filmmaking, then quietly building careers that shape the international festival circuit.\n\n\tVERDICT\n\n\tA filmmaker worth tracking, and a storyteller specializing in the emotional spaces between cultures, identities and chosen families.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Searchlight Pictures\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The Testament of Ann Lee” (Searchlight Pictures)\n\n\tTHE PROJECT\n\n\tMona Fastvold began as an actress, then emerged as one of Sundance’s most commanding directors with “The Sleepwalker” and “The World to Come.” Her latest, starring Amanda Seyfried, plunges deeper into her fascination with female interiority.\n\n\tTHE IMPACT\n\n\tFastvold represents the actress-turnedauteur blueprint: someone whose background enriches every frame with psychological texture.\n\n\tVERDICT\n\n\tA director whose style only grows more luminous. Her creative partnership with “The Brutalist” director Brady Corbet should keep paying dividends.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJeremy Zag‘s company, which is best known for its hit franchise “Miraculous,” has tapped Ian Lambur as executive vice president of the series department at its television production arm, Zagtoon. \n\n\tLambur will be based in L.A. and will report to Jeremy Zag, founder, CEO and CCO of Zag. The executive is joining from Cloudco where he served as executive VP of content strategy and co-productions.  He also served in senior roles at The Jim Henson Company in Los Angeles, The Walt Disney Company EMEA in London and Guru Entertainment in Toronto, among others.\n\t\n\n\t In his newly created role, he will oversee the global execution and business performance of all Zagtoon television series, spanning sales, broadcaster and platform relationships and production; and he’ll be developing master toy partnerships for each IP.\n\n\n\t“Ian brings a rare combination of strategic insight, operational excellence, and deep industry experience,” said Zag. “He previously worked with us at Zag and played a meaningful role in our journey. It is a true pleasure to welcome him back home at such an exciting moment for the company, as we continue to scale our global portfolio and build long-lasting franchises.”\n\n\tLambur said, “Having worked with Jeremy and the teams in the past, I know firsthand the creative ambition and entrepreneurial spirit that define the studio.” He added, “Zag has grown tremendously, and I’m honored to rejoin the company to help accelerate the global growth of the Zagtoon series department across content, consumer products and beyond.”\n\n\tOn the production side, Lambur will oversee flagship series such as “Ghostforce,” as well as new IP’s in development.\n\t\n\n\tThe company recently announced the development of “Carmen,” an animated feature film set in the world of women’s motorsports, led by former F1 driver Carmen Jorda. Along with the series, Zag is also looking to build a franchise inspired by Jorda, ranging from scripted, live experiences and merchandising. \n\n\tZag is also currently developing “Melody,” a musical animated feature film starring Katy Perry as the title character; as well as a second “Miraculous” movie with producer John Cohen (“Despicable Me,” “The Angry Birds Movie”) and writer Matt Roller (“Rick and Morty,” “Community”). \n",

    "body": "\n\tRIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil — The Golden Globes and Rio’s City Hall inked Dec. 17 for the organization of three annual editions of a Golden Globes Tribute Gala in Rio. The first edition will take place March 18at the landmark Copacabana Palace Hotel aiming to gather about 350 talents, some 70 to 100 from Hollywood, the remaining local, said Uri Singer, a partner of Urland Ventures, which will produce the event along with Musicalize.\n\n\tSinger told Variety during the announcement ceremony that the event is part of a Golden Globes initiative to expand overseas.\n\t\n\n\t“Golden Globes’ president Helen Hoehne is very [excited] about expanding the brand to quality markets. It starts in Brazil. And if it is a success, we will do it in other countries. The industry here is growing. So, I told Helen ‘we should do it in Brazil’. She said ‘yes, it’s exactly what we are planning’”, Singer told Variety.\n\n\n\tIf the first three editions of the event are successful, he added, the deal with Rio’s City Hall will be extended for two more years, and the fourth and fifth editions will be aired live on television. Singer also said local giant media group Globo is a partner of the event.\n\n\tThe Golden Globes Tribute Gala in Rio could eventually evolve to become the Golden Globes Latin America, said Singer, who is also the CEO of Passage Pictures, producer of Noah Baumbach’s “White Noise” and several other features.\n\n\tFor the next year’s event, a jury will select five Brazilians to receive prizes in the categories: Lifetime achievement (for arts in general, not restricted to film), actress, actor, breakthrough actor and breakthrough actress. The selection will be based on the talents’ career achievements.\n\t\n\n\tJury members are Hoehne, Singer, Tim Gray, Orlando John, Diana Miller, Fernanda Ezabella, Daniel Herculano, Rodrigo Fonseca and Cecilia Barroso.\n\n\tSinger said the March 18 event will be the greatest red-carpet ceremony ever in Brazil. The gala will include a cocktail, dinner and music performances.\n\n\tBrazilian Fernanda Torres received the Golden Globe for best actress in a motion picture – drama in 2025, and Kleber Mendonca Filho’s “The Secret Agent” was nominated in 2026 for best motion picture – drama, best motion picture – non-English language and best performance by a male actor in a motion picture – drama (Wagner Moura).\n",

    "body": "\n\tActors and other performers working in film and TV in the U.K. have voted by a landslide to refuse to be digitally scanned on set in order to secure artificial intelligence protections.\n\n\tMember of performers union Equity working in film and TV voted in a ballot on AI protections, and decided by a massive majority that they are willing to take industrial action over AI. The ballot asked: “Are you prepared to refuse to be digitally scanned on set to secure adequate AI protections?,” and 99.6% of them responded “Yes.”\n\t\n\n\tEquity commented: “Members are increasingly concerned about the use of their voice and likeness, including being digitally scanned on set. Equity is fighting for protections for performers based on the principles of explicit consent, transparency of terms, and fair remuneration for usage.”\n\n\n\tThe ballot turnout was 75.1%, with eligible voters made up of Equity’s membership working in film and TV – 7,732 actors, stunt performers and dancers.\n\n\tThe ballot was indicative, which means it is not binding and does not legally cover Equity members to take industrial action – for that, a statutory ballot is needed. However, the result shows the strength of feeling among performers about AI, and indicates they are prepared to refuse to be digitally scanned on set – a form of action short of a strike.\n\n\tEquity is currently negotiating the agreements it holds with Pact, the trade body representing the majority of film and TV production companies in the U.K., to set minimum standards for pay, terms and conditions for performers working in the sector.\n\t\n\n\tEquity will now write to Pact with the results and demand they come back to the negotiating table with a better deal on AI. If Pact refuses to enshrine the AI protections the union is seeking in the agreements, Equity will hold a statutory ballot for industrial action.\n\n\tEquity’s general secretary, Paul W. Fleming, said: “Artificial intelligence is a generation-defining challenge. And for the first time in a generation, Equity’s film and TV members have shown that they are willing to take industrial action.\n\n\t“90% of TV and film is made on these agreements. Over three quarters of artists working on them are union members. This shows that the workforce is willing to significantly disrupt production unless they are respected, and decades of erosion in terms and conditions begins to be reversed.\n\n\t“The U.S. streamers and Pact need to step away from the brink, and respect this show of strength. We need adequate AI protections which build on, not merely replicate, those agreed after the SAG-AFTRA strike in the U.S.A. over two years ago.\n\n\t“The union believes this can be resolved through negotiation, but 18 months of talks have led us to this stalemate. With fresh AI proposals, significant movement on royalties, and a package of modern terms and conditions, Pact and allied producers can turn this around. The ball is in their court when we return to the table in January.”\n",

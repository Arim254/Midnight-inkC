    "body": "\n\tSAG-AFTRA is joining the industry condemnation of ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, for releasing a new video model that has enabled widespread copyright infringement online.\n\n\tSAG-AFTRA President Sean Astin is among those whose likeness has been used in videos generated by the model, Seedance 2.0. In the video, he appears in the role of Samwise Gamgee from “The Lord of the Rings,” saying “Mr. Frodo, why don’t we just take the Eagles straight to Mount Doom?”\n\t\n\n\tThe performers’ union called the Seedance videos — which also include Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise fighting on a rooftop, among many others — “blatant infringement.”\n\n\n\t“SAG-AFTRA stands with the studios in condemning the blatant infringement enabled by ByteDance’s new AI video model Seedance 2.0,” the union said. “The infringement includes the unauthorized use of our members’ voices and likenesses. This is unacceptable and undercuts the ability of human talent to earn a livelihood. Seedance 2.0 disregards law, ethics, industry standards and basic principles of consent. Responsible AI development demands responsibility, and that is nonexistent here.”\n\n\tThe Motion Picture Association also condemned ByteDance on Thursday, calling on the company to immediately cease its infringing conduct.\n\n\tThe Human Artistry Campaign, a coalition of artists’ rights groups affiliated with the Hollywood unions, also spoke out against the AI model on Friday.\n\n\t“The launch of Seedance 2.0 is an attack on every creator around the world,” a campaign spokesperson stated. “Stealing human creators’ work in an attempt to replace them with AI generated slop is destructive to our culture: stealing isn’t innovation. These unauthorized deepfakes and voice clones of actors violate the most basic aspects of personal autonomy and should be deeply concerning to everyone. Authorities should use every legal tool at their disposal to stop this wholesale theft.”\n\t\n\n\tSeedance appears to mark a significant advance over previous AI video platforms, in that it combines audio and video to create a more cinematic feel. \n\n\tSAG-AFTRA has sought for several years to establish guardrails around AI replication of actors’ likenesses. In 2023, the union went on strike to establish the principle of “consent and compensation” for any such use of a recognizable actor by the major studios. \n\n\tThe union is currently in the midst of negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers on a successor agreement that would build on the previous deal.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tShay Mitchell‘s first major role in Hollywood was in “Pretty Little Liars” as Emily Fields. In 2018, she starred in the first season of Netflix’s “YOU” as Peach Salinger. That same year, she launched BÉIS, a brand that has since redefined the luggage market.\n\n\tEight years later, she’s upheld her career as an actress, and BÉIS is stronger than ever, so it’s time to take on a new role as Capital One Travel’s first-ever Travel Ambassador. Mitchell’s appointment coincides with the new Capital One Landing at New York City’s LaGuardia airport, set to officially open its doors to the public on Feb. 18.\n\t\n\n\tAs the founder and CEO of BÉIS, travel is a vertical Mitchell is more than familiar with. Having previously collaborated with Capital One at Cannes Lions and Miami Art Week, and as a longtime fan of the company, this is a move that feels natural to her. “There’s just been lots of synergy,” she says, citing similarities between Capital One and BÉIS. Among these similarities is customer consideration, something that Mitchell has championed through her own brand from day one. She notes that, like BÉIS, Capital One “listen[s] to them, they hear things, and they make the experience even better.”\n\n\tMitchell speaks from experience. On a nightmare travel day, where her flight was first delayed, and subsequently cancelled at 2 in the morning, the only open, 24/7 lounge in the airport was Capital One. “This,” she says, “is what sets them apart from everywhere else, from everybody else.” \n\n\tOther thoughtful details abound at the new LaGuardia lounge, like luggage nooks and a power outlet at every seat (not to mention a menu developed in partnership with the José Andrés Group). Perhaps this is why when asked about the most common marketplace feedback she’s received and taken to heart, she replies with one word: ease. \n\t\n\n\t“We’re so busy,” she acknowledges, at once about BÉIS but also about the world in general. While some things may seem minuscule, like scanning a QR code to order food for your table, checking how busy the airport lounge is ahead of time, and comfortably storing your carry-on – all things offered at the new LGA lounge – they make a huge difference.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMitchell’s Capital One partnership comes on the heels of several well-received BÉIS collaborations, notably one with Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty that Mitchell says mirrors her intentions with Capital One.\n\n\tFor Mitchell, when it comes to travel, accessibility and attention to detail are key. Gomez, along with the rest of her team at Rare Beauty, also “thought about their customer first,” Mitchell shares. The actress explains how they specifically created products that are easy to open, catering to anyone who may not have the strength or ability to open and use those items in different packaging. “Taking that extra step to consider the customer before they’ve even asked for it, or known that they need it, was something really telling,” she explains.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCarry-On Travel Set\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tThis bestselling set pairs a carry-on rolling suitcase with a duffle bag (that can tuck under the seat in front of you)\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tMitchell likely has other BÉIS collaborations on the horizon, but for now, her focus is working alongside the Capital One team, serving as both a strategic and creative partner. Speaking on her goals for this collaboration, and for her own brand, she says, “I want things to feel premium, but not intimidating.” Consumers can expect BÉIS integration into the partnership as well, with additional details being revealed throughout the year.\n\n\tFor Mitchell, all these things mean that her “experience of a trip starts from the beginning,” just the way it should be.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s time to raise a glass to the Disney+ “Muppet Show” special. \n\n\tPer the Mouse House, the revival of the beloved variety series has delivered 7.58 million multiplatform viewers across Disney+ and ABC since it debuted on Feb. 4. That viewership comes on top of rave reviews for the show, which has garnered a 98% critical approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. \n\n\tThe viewership news certainly bodes well for the show, which sources said at the time it was announced could serve as a backdoor pilot for a new full run of the beloved series. \n\t\n\n\tSabrina Carpenter, Maya Rudolph, and Seth Rogen all guest starred in the special, with Rogen and Carpenter also serving as executive producers. In the special, the Muppets reunite at the Muppet Theater to put on a new iteration of their show. \n\n\n\tAlex Timbers directed and executive produced the special. Rogen, Evan Goldberg, James Weaver, and Alex McAtee executive produced for Point Grey Pictures. David Lightbody, Leigh Slaughter and Michael Steinbach were executive producers for The Muppets Studio. Along with Carpenter, Albertina Rizzo, Matt Vogel and Eric Jacobson were executive producers. The special was produced by 20th Television, Disney Branded Television, The Muppets Studio and Point Grey Pictures. \n\n\tVeteran Muppet performers Bill Barretta, Dave Goelz, Eric Jacobson, Peter Linz, David Rudman and Matt Vogel performed the majority of the Muppet characters in the special, supported by a team of additional performers. Goelz, who has performed with The Muppets for over 50 years, was one of the performers on the original “The Muppet Show” and originated the characters Gonzo and Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, among others.\n",

    "body": "\n\tZazie Beetz spoke out against the proliferation of AI at the Berlin Film Festival press conference for Gore Verbinski’s new film “Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die,” which tackles the hot topic with humor.\n\n\tThe sci-fi adventure, premiering on Friday night as a Berlinale Special Gala, follows a self-proclaimed “man from the future” (Sam Rockwell) who recruits a group of people in an L.A. diner to help him save the world from artificial intelligence. Alongside Beetz and Rockwell, it stars a strong ensemble cast including Haley Lu Richardson, Michael Peña, Asim Chaudhry and Juno Temple — all of whom besides Temple were on hand at the press conference.\n\t\n\n\tThe cast was of course immediately asked about the threat of AI, with Beetz delivering a clear and honest takedown. “I just feel very, very strongly about AI and all of the damage I think that it is doing to the social fabric of our society and our interpersonal relationships,” the “Atlanta” and “Deadpool 2” star said. “I think that we need to rally the troops and get people mad about it and do something.”\n\n\n\tVerbinski also had many thoughts on the matter, saying: “You don’t want to get me started on AI. How much time do you got? I mean, I think there’s so much to talk about. I mean, it’s coming. I’m in meetings all the time with, you know, heads of visual effects studios, actors — everybody’s talking about AI. And then outside of my world, you know, geopolitics… ‘If we don’t do that, the Chinese are gonna make it,’ It’s a crazy race, nobody’s gonna pause. I could go on and on and on. But I do think, fundamentally, I don’t want this thing to get in front of the creative process.” \n\t\n\n\tBut like in “Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die,” the film’s press conference also contained plenty of laughter to balance out the more serious moments. During the photocall before the cast took their seats, Richardson got photographers and journalists cackling by performing high kicks and headstands in front of the cameras. The conference itself also contained several funny moments, including a not-so-pleasant memory from filming in Cape Town, South Africa. \n\n\tAfter Beetz shared that the cast “trauma bonded” in Cape Town after being with each other 24/7, Chaudhry elaborated that they “also bonded through something else… because we were in Cape Town, we all got sick, you know.”\n\n\tHe continued, “So one of the names for the movie was ‘Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Diarrhea,’ because we all had the big D.” \n\n\t“It was passed around like an STD,” Verbinski added to enormous laughter in the room. \n\n\tRichardson recalled having to wear a gown during filming while dealing with it. “Honestly, having food poisoning in the princess dress wasn’t great,” she said. “That’s a lot of layers.” \n",

    "description": "\n\tThere are different ways to say “I love you” in Norwegian and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas is teaching us.\n\n\tIt wasn’t in the script for her to say it to",
    "body": "\n\tThere are different ways to say “I love you” in Norwegian and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas is teaching us.\n\n\tIt wasn’t in the script for her to say it to her co-star Renate Reinsve in one of the most pivotal scenes of the best picture nominee “Sentimental Value.” Some versions are reserved for spouses, family members, etc. But when asked which Norwegian version of “I love you” would apply to recent Super Bowl Halftime sensation and cultural juggernaut Bad Bunny, Lilleaas delivered playfully, using the “spouse” version.\n\t\n\n\t“I watched it on my way home,” she says of the performance that captivated millions worldwide. “It was amazing. It was so moving. I was so incredibly moved.”\n\n\n\tHer takeaway from that moment, which is a through line in her approach to her craft, was heartfelt: “Love is stronger and will always make its way to the top. I think it’s more our nature to be good to each other than to be bad to each other.”\n\n\tIt’s a reminder that, for Lilleaas, art, whether in music, cinema or language itself, is about emotional connection, not accolades.\n\n\tWhen the actress heard her name called on Oscar nomination morning for her supporting turn in “Sentimental Value,” the moment didn’t land all at once.\n\n\t“It’s such a big deal,” she says on the newest episode of the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast. “It’s not something that I’ve ever thought was possible. But it is just this marker of the top level of acting in a way.”\n\n\tThe 36-year-old was still celebrating co-star Elle Fanning’s nomination when her own name followed. “I was still in Elle mode,” she recalls, laughing.\n\t\n\n\tIf her performance as the quiet, watchful sister in Joachim Trier’s family drama feels fully formed, it’s because Lilleaas has been building toward it her entire life.\n\n\tListen below!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeon\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn “Sentimental Value,” Lilleaas plays Agnes Borg Pettersen, a woman who absorbs the emotional shrapnel of her fractured family. It’s a performance of micro-gestures and internal shifts — the opposite of what Oscar pundits often describe as “big” acting.\n\n\t“I definitely lean more toward the subtlety and the intimacy rather than demonstrating anything,” she says. “I don’t like that as an audience.”\n\n\tHer character survives by receding. “She’s a very subtle person in the family. She has to be, because she has to take a step back to let all the other big personalities act themselves out. And that’s her function in the family — to keep them all together.”\n\n\tThat instinct toward restraint is personal. Though trained in physical theater in Norway — “very expressive and very far from who I am as an actor” — she discovered the body leads her process.\n\n\t“You have to listen to what the body is saying,” she shares. “You, as an intellectual, are not the leader in the situation, because then you’re dictating what the result is going to be. And that’s none of your business as an actor.”\n\n\tThe film’s emotional crescendo comes in a bedroom scene between Lilleaas and co-star Reinsve, who plays her sister Nora — a hug that wasn’t fully scripted.\n\n\t“We knew it was an important, pivotal scene in the movie,” she says. “Everyone was so attentive, and it was this very emotional, intimate vibe on set. That gives you confidence and a feeling of being held, which makes it so much easier to be vulnerable.”\n\n\tAfter a strong take, Lilleaas felt an impulse. “I felt this need to hug her,” she says. “And I was hesitant, because improvisation can also ruin a good take sometimes.”\n\n\tTrier sensed it. “He said, ‘Just go hug her.’ And I went to the bed, and we hugged. And I just felt so filled with love for sisterhood and for these characters.”\n\n\tThe moment culminates with a declaration of love in Norwegian — a phrase reserved for the deepest bonds. “It’s what you say to your husband when you get married,” she explains.\n\t\n\n\tLike many international breakouts, Lilleaas has been thrust into the whirlwind of awards season.\n\n\t“I definitely did not know how it works,” she says of the months-long campaign trail. “You see people promoting movies, but you never really think much of it. Now I’m like, OK, that person was in three different countries in three different days. How’s that even possible?”\n\n\tShe laughs at the race’s vocabulary. “‘Snub’ is also a new word. I think it’s insane.”\n\n\tWhile she’s grateful for the recognition — including Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations — she keeps it in perspective. “My value as a person is not reliant on me being nominated for anything or being snubbed,” she says. “It’s such a constructed reality. It’s not a real competition. We made something months ago, and now we’re putting it in a pot, and somebody’s going to choose one.”\n\n\tGrowing up in Norway, Lilleaas fell in love with movies early. Her parents ran a local theater production company, introducing her to performance as a communal act. One English-language performance left a particular imprint.\n\n\t“I remember seeing ‘Erin Brockovich’ and being struck by the acting,” she says. “I think Julia Roberts is amazing.”\n\n\tFor all the new doors opening — including the possibility of English-language films — Lilleaas remains cautious.\n\n\t“It would be lovely to try to work in English,” she says. “But it is something different. You lose a little bit of the intimacy sometimes, because a lot of that is in language.”\n\n\tShe isn’t chasing specific collaborators. “I want to work with people who want to work with me,” she says. “I’m not the kind of person who scratches at people’s doors. I will go where I’m wanted.”\n\n\tIt’s a philosophy that extends to motherhood and career. “When you look at their childhood versus your career, what matters most is their perception of you as a parent,” she says of her children. “Their needs will always win.”\n\n\tBefore the Oscars ceremony, she’s already onto her next project — a new Norwegian film beginning production Monday. The specifics are under wraps, but the direction is clear: more complexity, more truth.\n\n\tDoing “Sentimental Value,” she says, “made me hungrier for those kinds of roles — more complex characters.”\n\t\n\n\tIn a season obsessed with volume and victory speeches, Lilleaas’ ascent has been defined by trust, vulnerability and the radical act of listening. For an actress who thrives in the smallest movements, that may be her greatest strength.\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

    "body": "\n\tEvery episode of the HBO docuseries “Neighbors” begins with the camera zooming in from outer space. But before the action alights in the location of the latest dispute between adjacent property owners to catch the eye of directors Harrison Fishman and Dylan Redford (yes, grandson of Robert), the shot fills with the telltale red, white and blue of the American flag.\n\n\tThe reminder of where “Neighbors” takes place is almost redundant, even as it emphasizes a fundamental part of Fishman and Redford’s shared project. “Neighbors” unfolds across a broad swath of our great nation, from Manhattan apartment blocks to Montana ranches to San Diego suburbs. But there’s a fundamentally American sensibility that unites its subjects — all eccentric, stubborn individuals whose belief in property as a sacred right has led them into conflict with someone equally convinced of their own entitlement. No other nation on Earth, it’s implied, could produce such a smorgasbord of personalities, imbue them with a bedrock belief in homeownership as the endpoint of self-actualization and arm them with a litigious culture fueled by online exhibitionism. Over six episodes, that argument gets plenty of evidence. It isn’t always fun to watch, but “Neighbors” is never not compelling.\n\t\n\n\t“Neighbors” is one of several HBO docuseries, including “Telemarketers” in 2023 and “Ren Faire” in 2024, to be executive produced by at least one Safdie brother. (Following the siblings’ creative separation, Josh Safdie produces “Neighbors” solo alongside frequent collaborators Ronald Bronstein and Eli Bush. “Neighbors” also has the imprimatur of uber-cool production company A24, which also backed Safdie’s Oscar-nominated feature film “Marty Supreme.”) The Safdies are known for casting nonprofessional actors in their scripted projects, and the uniting theme of these unscripted efforts are the kind of singular eccentrics one could see stealing a scene from a more established performer, like the perma-tanned Wayne Diamond opposite Adam Sandler in “Uncut Gems.”\n\t\n\n\tBut where “Ren Faire” or “Love Has Won: The Cult of Mother God,” another HBO-Safdie collaboration, focused on one charismatic figure over several episodes, “Neighbors” packs multiple stories into each installment, apart from the finale. This makes casting director Harleigh Shaw every bit as crucial to “Neighbors” as Fishman and Redford. (Shaw worked with Benny Safdie on “The Smashing Machine” and with the Safdie stalwart Jennifer Venditti on Charli XCX’s mockumentary “The Moment.”) Shaw’s discoveries include a former stripper who performed under the name “The Italian Stallion” feuding with the proprietor of a “Vietnam memorial on wheels” over a lawn, a transgender ex-Orthodox Jew who takes issue with a proselytizer in her apartment building and a San Antonio woman who self-identifies as an “interstellar traveler” on a quest to construct a wall in her front yard. Each is a discovery in their own right, let alone in the aggregate.\n\n\tThen again, many of these spats have been taken to the court of public opinion — as well as, frequently, actual court — via social media, where Fishman and Redford encountered the videos as early inspiration for the show. “Neighbors” incorporates on-the-ground interviews as well as embellishments like visual and auditory distortion, yet much of the material is supplied by the participants themselves through their Ring cameras, cell phones and laptops. The surveillance tech that pervades our lives is a constant presence in “Neighbors,” providing fuel for aggrievement and an outlet for the aggrieved. Of two Montana homesteaders at war over a gate installed on a private road, one is a nerd culture YouTuber who directs his fans’ ire toward the ever-present thorn in his side.The other is his foe’s most devoted comments section troll.\n\n\tThe fuzzy gray area at the intersection of the digital and the real is where “Neighbors” takes root; in one episode, a glitchy app directs droves of Florida beachgoers in search of public sand onto private property. Yet all these arguments originate with unmistakably human quirks and foibles, many of which defy easy judgments of right and wrong. The least satisfying tales involve a group of reasonable counterparties teaming up against a single aggressor, like an Indiana man who’s turned his grandmother’s house into an unauthorized urban farm. (Though Fishman and Redford do make a retired gay couple with an indoor hot tub that takes up most of their living room the face of the opposition. I’d love to hang out with them!) The most are those who have met their match and are too blinded by rage to see it. I laughed out loud when a woman’s adult son excused himself from her venting, explaining that “this is probably one of the dumbest arguments I’ve ever seen.” The only person who agrees on the importance of locating the property line happens to be his mother’s sworn enemy.\n\t\n\n\tFor the finale, though, Fishman and Redford break form. At first, a San Diego man squabbling with his neighbors over whether he should exercise near-nude in his driveway in full view of a church seems like standard fare for “Neighbors.” Then their subject starts to flirt with the idea of disengaging and moving to a like-minded nudist community, even relocating for a few days to test the new setup out. The saga has a more full and satisfying arc than other, more fragmentary ones while teasing out the series’ subtext: that this level of aggravation is, on some level, a choice. These “Neighbors” may point fingers at others , but the show also functions as a hard look in the mirror.\n\n\t“Neighbors” will premiere on HBO and HBO Max on Feb. 13 at 9 p.m. PT, with remaining episodes airing weekly on Fridays.\n",

    "body": "\n\tShelly Desai, a character actor whose work spanned generations of television and film, died Feb. 10 in Los Angeles. He was 90.\n\n\tHis family announced the death but did not disclose a cause.\n\n\tDesai built a decades-long career appearing in dozens of shows and movies, earning recognition for recurring roles on FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and TNT’s “Men of a Certain Age.”\n\n\n\tBorn Dec. 3, 1935, in Bombay, Desai arrived in the United States during the 1960s intending to pursue graduate studies in engineering. That plan shifted when he found his way to acting. He performed on Chicago stages before moving to New York and eventually settling in Los Angeles.\n\t\n\n\tBy the early 1970s, Desai had broken into professional theater, working both Off Broadway and on Broadway. He appeared in “Gandhi,” a 1970 Broadway production directed by José Quintero that became infamous for closing after a single performance. He returned to Broadway in 1981 for “A Talent for Murder,” performing alongside Claudette Colbert and Nancy Addison.\n\n\tHis screen career began with a small part in Brian De Palma’s 1974 rock musical “Phantom of the Paradise.” From there, Desai became a fixture on television, racking up guest appearances on shows across multiple eras including “St. Elsewhere,” “Hill Street Blues,” “The A-Team,” “Moonlighting,” “thirtysomething,” “ER,” “Friends,” “NYPD Blue,” “Ugly Betty,” “Baskets” and “History of the World: Part II.”\n\n\tHe lent his voice to the animated series “Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?” and appeared in several episodes of “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” Science-fiction enthusiasts might recall his role on “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” where he played V’Sal, a blue-skinned Bolian barber, in a 1991 episode titled “Data’s Day.”\n\t\n\n\tDesai gained wider visibility playing Carlos in 14 episodes of “Men of a Certain Age” from 2009 to 2011. He also became known for portraying Hwang, the tough landlord on “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” frequently sparring with characters played by Charlie Day and Danny DeVito.\n\n\tHis film work included parts in “Thelma & Louise,” “Toys,” “Clifford,” “A Midnight Clear” and “Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.” Desai remained active in his later years, filming commercials shortly before his death.\n\n\tHe is survived by his wife, Phyllis; stepdaughters April and Dawn; and grandchildren Sean, Sofia and Dylan.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe common layman’s shorthand for the BAFTA Awards is that they’re the “British Oscars,” in the way that the César Awards are the French Oscars or the Goya Awards are the Spanish Oscars. Yet the comparison isn’t quite correct: Where the Césars and Goyas exclusively recognize their own national cinemas, the BAFTAs, like the Academy Awards, officially have no borders.\n\n\tAs it is at the Oscars, a production of any nationality can compete at the BAFTAs — and as it is at the Oscars, that means American films frequently rule the roost. So it is this year: three of the five best film nominees (“One Battle After Another,” “Marty Supreme” and “Sinners”) are all-American, one (“Sentimental Value”) is a European co-production with a sliver of BBC Film involvement, and the one recognizably British film in the pack (“Hamnet”) is still a U.S. co-production with Chinese auteur Chloé Zhao at the helm and Steven Spielberg, no less, among the producers.\n\t\n\n\tAlmost every year, the BAFTA nominations are met with widespread grumbling in the U.K. industry about the lack of recognition for the home team. In recent years, such widely celebrated British films as “Aftersun,” “All of Us Strangers,” “The Zone of Interest” and “Kneecap” have failed to land a best film nomination, prompting the question: if the BAFTAs aren’t for the Brits, who are they really for? For pundits, they’ve certainly become a useful Oscar bellwether in the decades since they shifted their schedule to precede the American show. But shouldn’t they mean more in their own right?\n\t\n\n\tThe consolation prize for disgruntled local talent is the best British film award, which five years ago expanded its field to 10 nominees — in theory to better reflect the breadth and diversity of British cinema, though the risk of greater expansion is that exclusions become more pointed. This year’s 10 nominees in the category run the gamut from the classical prestige fare (“Hamnet,” the Claire Foy starrer “H Is for Hawk,” and the period showbiz biopic “Mr. Burton”) to populist entertainment (“28 Years Later” and “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy,” an Emmy nominee Stateside but a theatrical release in the U.K.) to indie crowd-pleasers (“I Swear” and “The Ballad of Wallis Island”) to darker festival-nurtured fare (“Pillion,” “Steve” and Lynne Ramsay’s “Die My Love”).\n\n\tBut it’s an eyebrow-raiser that there was no room on the list (which, not incidentally, features no black filmmakers) for Akinola Davies Jr.’s moving, atmospheric childhood story “My Father’s Shadow” — a Cannes sensation that won its director best director at the British Independent Film Awards and the breakthrough director prize at the Gotham Awards across the pond.\n\n\tAlso frozen out were Harris Dickinson’s punchy, Cannes-awarded homelessness study “Urchin”; Paul Andrew Wilson’s “Dragonfly,” with its shattering, BAFTA-longlisted performances by Andrea Riseborough and Brenda Blethyn; and Alex Garland’s immersive combat drama “Warfare,” which at least eked out a best sound nod. Davies Jr. was recognized instead in the outstanding British debut category, alongside the makers of “Pillion,” “Wasteman,” “The Ceremony” and “A Want in Her,” while Dickinson’s acclaimed debut was unlucky enough to miss out there, too.\n\n\tEven for those films that did crack the best British film list, though, the recognition can feel tokenistic. Only four of the 10 nominees — “Hamnet,” “I Swear,” “Pillion” and “The Ballad of Wallis Island” — popped up in other categories. For the other six, it was their only nomination: nothing for Jennifer Lawrence’s powerhouse performance or Seamus McGarvey’s BIFA-winning cinematography in “Die My Love,” no recognition for the impressive technical accomplishments of “28 Years Later” or “H Is for Hawk,” and not even a rising star mention for BIFA-winning “Steve” standout Jay Lycurgo. Some might argue none of those were nominated for Oscar either, though that seems as good a reason as any for BAFTA to fly its own flag a little higher.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNow in its 29th edition, the European Shooting Stars platform, run by European Film Promotion and supported by Creative Europe’s Media Programme, brings another 10 promising European acting talents to the Berlin Film Festival, to help them build their careers internationally. From Feb. 13-16, the selected performers will participate in workshops and panels, as well as meetings with international journalists, producers and casting directors.\n\t\n\n\tAn open event in the Berlinale Hub on Feb.16 will introduce the talents to the public along with a mix of conversations, video clips and games in a playful and relaxed atmosphere. Entrance is free on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n\n\tThis year’s Shooting Stars were picked by a jury comprising Danish actress Danica Ćurčić, Bosnian helmer and Academy Award-winner Danis Tanović, Portuguese casting director Jo Monteiro, Belgian producer Jacques-Henri Bronckart and British-Sudanese critic Leila Latif. They were selected from candidates nominated by their national film promotion institutes and film centers.\n\n\n\tMeet this year’s Shooting Stars:\n\n\tViolet BraeckmanBelgiumBraeckman, who was praised by the jury as being “chameleonic… the rarest talent you can find,” stars in the Berlinale Special Gala “Heysel 85.” She plays the daughter of the mayor of Brussels, one of many characters caught between professional duty, family loyalty and moral responsibility when violence erupts during the European Cup Final. This year will also find Braeckman in Dutch director Thom Lunshof’s feature debut, “First Zone,” as well as Peter Krüger’s “The Age of Magic.” In addition, she is currently developing her feature directing debut.\n\t\n\n\tJoes BrauersThe NetherlandsBrauers launched his acting career at the age of 8 and has compiled impressively diverse credits in theater, film and TV, including Jasmila Zbanic’s Oscar-nominated feature “Quo vadis, Aida?” In 2026, he will be seen in Dutch helmer Sander Burger’s 1980s period drama “Youri,” as the journalist who forges a relationship with the world-famous Soviet refugee concert pianist Youri Egorov. The jury noted that he has the “gravitas and the ingredients to become a big movie star.”\n\n\tFatlume BunjakuAlbaniaA Kosovar-Albanian, Bunjaku combines her acting career with work as a professor of performing arts. She’s been active in film and theater since 2013. Commenting on her “commanding screen presence,” the jury noted, “You can see her dance background in her physicality; in the way her spine transforms from one performance to another. It’s very exciting to see what she does next.” Bunjaku wrote and is currently producing her first short film, “Visa, Champagne and a Sandwich.”\n\n\tSalif CisséFranceAlso chosen as one of Unifrance’s 10 to Watch this year, Cissé discovered his passion for acting during a high school workshop. He made his feature debut in 2020 with “All Hands on Deck,” which earned him a César nomination for most promising actor. He demonstrated his aptitude for blending pathos with comedy in “Filmlovers!” and “Guess Who Is Calling?,” and brought a real sense of humanity to his antihero in “Meteors.” After helming the short “Allies” in 2024, he is planning his feature directing debut.\n\n\tCleo DiáraPortugalThe Cape Verde-born talent moved to Lisbon as a child, where she discovered a love for the theater. She has since appeared in many acclaimed stage productions, and brings that same energy and authenticity to her onscreen performances. Her starring role in Pedro Pinho’s “I Only Rest in the Storm” scored Diára the prestigious Un Certain Regard — best performance award at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. That year, she also played in the Cannes ACID title “Night Passengers.” She will soon be seen in the Prime Video Original series “Lisbon Noir,” directed by Artur Ribeiro.\n\n\tLucas EnglanderAustriaThe versatile, multilingual, Vienna-born performer has had a busy few years in international projects, including the popular miniseries “Nine Perfect Strangers” alongside Nicole Kidman, and “Transatlantic.” After making the latter, he became an Ambassador for the International Rescue Committee. Trained at the Stella Adler School of Acting in New York City, the actor’s next leading role will be in Adrian Goiginger’s “Das Café ohne Namen.” He has two projects in development: Théo Hellermann’s “Quand Le Monde Nous Regardera” and Harald Sicheritz’s “Bruno, der junge Kreisky.”\n\t\n\n\tDanielle GalliganIrelandCurrently embodying the fascinating Irish historical figure Lady Olivia Hedges-White on the Netflix series “House of Guinness,” Galligan boasts diverse TV credits on other prestige TV series including “Game of Thrones” (Sarra Frey), “Shadow and Bone” (Nina) and “The Walsh Sisters” (Claire). On the big screen, she impressed in “Lakelands” and “Spilt Milk.” Upcoming features include Sam Johnson’s debut, “A Rare Breed,” and John Madden’s “But When We Dance.” The jury calls her a “charismatic, transformative talent.”\n\n\tTecla InsoliaItalyA student of music since the age of five, Insolia’s musical flair and prize-winning role in the Sky Original miniseries “The Art of Joy” made her the perfect choice for the lead in opera director Damiano Michieletto’s feature debut, “Primavera.” In that feature, she plays the vibrant, rebellious convent girl violinist taught by composer Antonio Vivaldi. The youngest of the Shooting Stars, she also boosts several pop/rock singles.\n\n\tSofia Tjelta SydnessNorwayOften credited simply as Sofia Tjelta, the Norwegian actress has a significant part in what is perhaps the most hotly anticipated title of 2026: Ruben Ostlund’s “The Entertainment System Is Down,” playing the daughter of Daniel Brühl and Kirsten Dunst. In real life, the rising talent is the offspring of Norwegian performers Pia Tjelta and Kyrre Haugen Sydness. She established herself as a talent to watch in the TV series “Delete Me,” following that with a role in the Netflix miniseries “Midsummer Night.”\n\n\tEnno TrebsGermanyLike fellow Shooting Star Joes Brauers, Trebs’ film credits extend back to his youth, and include, most notably, Michael Haneke’s “The White Ribbon.” His collaboration with German auteur Christian Petzold covers three titles: “Undine,” “Afire” and “Mirrors No. 3.” This year, he’s the lead in helmer Nicolas Ehret’s “Echo of Tomorrow’s War.” The jury praised him as an “intense, precise actor who combines a youthful energy with a distinct maturity.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Love Story” showrunner Connor Hines is defending the decision not to consult the Kennedy family for the latest installment of Ryan Murphy’s anthology series, which explores the marriage of John F. Kennedy Jr. and fashion publicist Carolyn Bessette.\n\n\t“As a writer, it’s more healthy and effective to have some distance from the subject matter,” he told Variety at the show’s New York premiere. “It allows you to be a lot more objective in how you approach the material, versus when you’re talking to people personally, you feel a sense of responsibility of relaying exactly what they’re telling you because they’ve given you their time.”He concluded, “It’s an incredibly large family as well. So if you were to talk about consulting them, where would you even begin?”\n\t\n\n#LoveStory creator Connor Hines defends not consulting the Kennedy family on the FX series:“As a writer, it’s more healthy and effective to have some distance from the subject matter. Not so it can give you permission to slander them by any means, but I think it allows you to… pic.twitter.com/2ryxGKufAQ— Variety (@Variety) February 4, 2026\n\n\n\tThe series drew intense criticism from Jack Schlossberg, nephew of JFK Jr., who accused the production of “profiting off” his uncle’s life in a “grotesque way.” He posted multiple videos on social media while the series was being shot in New York last summer, in which he called on Murphy and Hines to donate part of its proceeds to the John F. Kennedy Library. \n\n\n\t“I am going to donate,” Murphy told Variety in June 2025. “I also like Jack’s Instagram when he just lip syncs to ’90s girl groups stuff. I want more of that. But I think it would be really hard if your relatives are always in the media.”\n\n\tThis isn’t the first time a Ryan Murphy production has clashed with the estate of its subject. The producer did not seek authorization from the Versace family before moving forward with “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story,” swearing by Maureen Orth’s book “Vulgar Favors” as its creative foundation. The Versace family publicly disowned the series as “a work of fiction” upon its release in 2018, claiming the investigative reporting published in Orth’s book relied on “second-hand hearsay” and contained “contradictions.”\n\n\tOne rare instance where Murphy consulted a real-life subject was during the development of “American Crime Story: Impeachment,” which reexamined the story of Monica Lewinsky. Lewinsky served as a producer on the series. \n\t\n\n\t“Because I was a producer, I didn’t think I should get a pass,” she told Variety in 2021. “It was trying to flush those things out: ‘I might say something more like this or I probably wouldn’t have said that because of X, Y and Z. Or I think Bill might have said something this way.’ And I felt very heard. But there were a lot of notes that they didn’t take, and I had to learn to respect that process too.”\n\n\tDespite not consulting the Kennedy’s, Hines and Murphy paused development at FX for three years to better understand its central subject. While Bessette’s marriage (and the couple’s shocking 1999 plane crash) were widely documented, she remained fiercely protective of her private life. The producers opted to wait until Elizabeth Beller’s in-depth biography, “Once Upon a Time: The Captivating Life of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy,” was published in 2024, which serves as the credited inspiration for the series.\n\n\t“This is a woman that was rendered by a lot of these narratives in a way that felt really unfair and devoid of context, devoid of empathy,” Hines said.\n\n\t“Love Story” stars Sarah Pidgeon as Carolyn Bessette, Paul Anthony Kelly as John F. Kennedy Jr. and Naomi Watts as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.“She really protected her privacy — and understandably so,” Pidgeon explained. “I think there’s a lot to be said for protecting your privacy. Some things aren’t for everyone. They’re for yourself.”\n\n\t“Love Story” is now streaming on Hulu.\n",

Kandi slammed Todd, claiming he wasn't paying a dime in rent or any bills connected to the property. She also asserts he hasn’t helped with bills related to their kids, Ace and Blaze ... specifically, she said she covered all expenses for two birthday parties thrown since the couple split late last year.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          In court docs, Todd alleged before the split, they both added money into a bank account to use for expenses. He claims after the separation, Kandi told him she would stop using the account and would pay all the bills herself.\n      \n    \n          Todd said, “[Kandi] now attempts to reframe and weaponize this self-created financial arrangement as evidence of financial instability or neglect, while the timing and sequence of events demonstrate otherwise.”\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He says Kandi has been making nasty statements against him in an effort to shift the focus away from her extended and “ongoing physical absence from the” kids and her “reliance on a third-party caregiver.” Todd says the judge should give him primary legal and physical custody on a temporary basis until a permanent parenting arrangement is put in place.\n      \n    \n          As TMZ previously reported, Kandi filed for divorce in November 2025. She demanded joint custody, but switched her request to sole custody after Todd requested sole custody.\n      \n      ",

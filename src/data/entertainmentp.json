    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers for Amazon Prime Video’s “We Were Liars” Season 1.\n\n\tThe “We Were Liars” universe expands Tuesday with the release of E. Lockhart‘s new novel, “We Fell Apart.” \n\n\tSet in the same world as that of the ultra-rich Sinclair family at the center of the book series “We Were Liars,” and the Emily Alyn Lind-led Amazon’s TV series adaptation of the same name, “We Fell Apart” follows a new set of characters that have their own secrets to keep and mysteries to solve.\n\t\n\n\tThere’s Matilda, who is invited to spend the summer with her long-lost father: a reclusive artist named Kingsley Cello. When she arrives at his seaside home, Hidden Beach, Kingsley is nowhere to be seen, but she meets her half-brother Meer, a former child star named Brock, and a brooding boy named Tatum who are living in Kingsley’s crumbling, castle-inspired estate.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhile the second season of “We Were Liars” is in the works from showrunners Julie Plec and Carina Adly MacKenzie and author Lockhart producing, “We Fell Apart” offers up plenty of story to tide fans of Beechwood Island over until they get to see where the TV drama goes. And now that Cadence Sinclair knows her beloved cousins and childhood sweetheart — “The Liars” — died in a fire for which she and they were responsible, the plan is to dive into the dark past of Cady’s mother and aunts, which is explored in sequel “Family of Liars.” \n\n\tHere, author Lockhart tells Variety about the story at the center of “We Fell Apart” and teases how he could connect to Season 2 of Amazon’s “We Were Liars.” \n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow did you come up with the idea for “We Fell Apart” and how it would connect to the first two “We Were Liars” books?\t\n\n\tI got the idea for writing this book when I visited this incredible piece of property on Martha’s Vineyard, which was the summer home of an architect called Araldo Cossutta. And I toured around this property, which was incredibly beautiful and falling apart. And it had a huge circular swimming pool that was filled with leaves and algae and sludge, and it had towers, almost like a castle. And I got excited to write a classic Gothic house story that was also beachy. And I was like, “This is close to this storytelling world,” but I did not think of it as connected to “We Were Liars”; I thought of it as its own book. \n\n\tAnd I started working on it and at the same time, my side hustle was working on the “We Were Liars” TV show. So I was really steeped in the world of the TV show. We were casting, and we’re shooting as I am finishing this book, and more and more, the world of “We Were Liars” was seeping in to “We Fell Apart,” to the point where I was like, “Oh, this is really a book in the same universe.” So it started out as a standalone and became a book in the same universe. \n\n\tThe first thing that I want to say is it can be read alone, but for people who have read “We Were Liars,” I think the thing that they’re going to like the most that starts close to the beginning of the book is that the characters trespass over on Beechwood Island. So Matilda and her half brother, Meer, and two other boys take this boat over at night across the water from Martha’s Vineyard to Beechwood Island, where there has been a recent tragedy. And it’s a kind of a ghoulish, teenage trespassing adventure. And they see the site of the tragedy, and then they go further into the island, and they go to the tennis courts, and they go to the tiny beach, which features a lot in “We Were Liars.” And so it’s a chance for people to sort of see the world of “We Were Liars” from a different perspective. And if people want to learn more Sinclair family secrets, they will find them in “We Fell Apart.” But it is its own story.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEmily Alyn Lind, Esther McGregor, Joseph Zada, Shubham Maheshwari\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJessie Redmond/Prime\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhile the Gothic beachy vibe is present in “We Fell Apart,” it’s in a very different setting from “We Were Liars,” despite them being very close in physical distance. What’s the significance of the differences and that juxtaposition? \t\n\n\tIn all three books, there’s a kingdom. In the first two books in this series, the kingdom is Beechwood Island, and it’s ruled by Harris Sinclair, the patriarch, and it is an establishment kingdom, so to speak. And the kingdom in “We Fell Apart” is ruled by an absent patriarch, and it is an alternative kingdom. It is a house in which there’s a very clearly articulated way of life and set of values that are defined in opposition to the kinds of values that are held by the Sinclairs in the other two books. But it is nonetheless a kingdom, and there’s nonetheless a ruler. So it’s still thematically about deciding whether you are a member of a kingdom or you are not a member of a kingdom, and whether you are going to keep safe the secrets of that kingdom or expose them.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAre plot points from “We Fell Apart” being incorporated into the second season of Amazon’s “We Were Liars”? \t\n\n\tI think all I’m allowed to say is that Julie Plec and Carina Adly MacKenzie have read this book.\n\t\n\t\tWhere are things so far on production for Season 2? How closely will it follow the second book, “Family of Liars,” as Season 1 already borrowed some from that book?\t\n\n\tThere’s not a lot I can say, but the new season will fold in the story of “Family of Liars,” and at the same time, I know the showrunners have a bunch of tricks up their sleeve so that people who’ve read “Family of Liars” will still be surprised. So without going a whole new direction, they’re nonetheless finding new twists. And there will be a current storyline, so you will still see Caitlin FitzGerald and Candice King and Mamie Gummer back. David Morse is coming back. Joseph Zada is coming back. Emily Alyn Lind is coming back. So those characters will have a new storyline that will intersect with the “Family of Liars” storyline and all the new stuff the showrunners have come up with.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJessie Redmond/Prime\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHave you given guidance on where you think the story should go in the present-day storyline for Cadence, beyond the plot in the book?\t\n\n\tI don’t think my role on this show is guidance. I think that I’m just a person on the team that is making this show. And Julie and Carina are the showrunners and I’m excited to be on this ride with them, but it’s their ride.\n\n\tThey really care about these characters. They make very bingeable, very entertaining television, but they are also very invested in complex, nuanced, difficult characters who are going through a lot. They’re not interested in simplifying or dumbing down anything. They’re interested in creating an experience for Season 2 that feels like the experience they delivered in Season 1 — that is emotionally invested in big messy characters.\n\t\n\t\tYou have a new TV series based on one of your books in the works at Amazon’s Prime Video, “Genuine Fraud,” which stars “The Summer I Turned Pretty’s” Rain Spencer. Where’s that project in the development process?\t\n\n\tI think Rain Spencer is terrific and has a really big range as an actress. She’s very funny, and she’s also a very good dramatic actor. And we have a showrunner named Sinead Daly, who is the showrunner for “Midnight Sun” — Stephanie Meyer’s book, basically “Twilight” from Edward’s point of view — and that is animated and is in the animation process, and that’s why she is free to come and run my show. So she’s writing the pilot, Rain is attached, and it’s gonna be amazing.\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe war of words between Disney and Google continues — on the fourth day of the blackout of ESPN, ABC and other Disney networks on YouTube TV amid a fee dispute.\n\n\tOn Monday, Disney asked Google to offer ABC to YouTube TV customers on Tuesday, Nov. 3, to bring them Election Night coverage. Google said no — and suggested instead that Disney allow YouTube TV to bring ABC and ESPN back on the air as the two sides work to hash out a new agreement, because those are “the channels that people want.”\n\t\n\n\tDisney’s networks went dark on YouTube TV shortly before the companies’ prior agreement expired Oct. 30 at midnight ET. According to Google, Disney has asked for an unprecedented fee increase for the full suite of networks. For its part, Disney says the tech giant has been “refusing to pay fair rates for our channels.”\n\n\n\tYouTube on Monday afternoon shared an email it said execs had sent to “Disney leadership” about the media company’s request to restore ABC for 24 hours. \n\n\tThe email began, “We agree that the right priority here is to give customers what they want. As you know from the many content disputes you’ve been part of, customers don’t want companies fighting and content blackouts. But unfortunately, your proposal would permit us to return Disney’s ABC stations only for a day and will cause customer confusion among those who may briefly see ABC on YouTube TV only to lose it again shortly after.”\n\n\tThe YouTube email noted, “There are plenty of other options for customers — election news information is very widely available across other broadcast stations and news networks on YouTube TV, as well as on the main YouTube service, for free. In fact, on the last two U.S. election days, the vast majority of tuned in YouTube TV subscribers chose not to watch ABC.”\n\t\n\n\tThe email continued, “Publicly resorting to the same tactic that Disney relied on in past disputes fails to acknowledge the distinction between YouTube and other distribution platforms. As you know, Disney can continue to livestream news information on the ABC News YouTube page, which has 19.1 million subscribers, and its ABC local stations can also do so on their YouTube pages.\n\n\t“To truly achieve what is best for our mutual customers, we propose immediately restoring the Disney channels that our customers watch: ABC and the ESPN networks, while we continue to negotiate. Those are the channels that people want,” the YouTube email to Disney concluded. “If you agree with our proposal and give us approval, we can get our operational teams together and get these channels live in hours. Let us know how you’d like to proceed.”\n\n\tAsked for comment, Disney said it has sent a YouTube renewal proposal to Google and is awaiting a response.\n\n\tHere is the full list of Disney networks that currently not avalable on YouTube TV: ABC local stations, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPNews, Freeform, FX, FXX, FXM, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, SEC Network, Nat Geo, Nat Geo Wild, ABC News Live, ACC Network, Localish; on the Spanish plan, ESPN Deportes, Baby TV Español and Nat Geo Mundo.\n",

    "body": "\n\tQuezon City has joined UNESCO‘s Creative Cities of Film Network, becoming one of the first Southeast Asian cities to earn the designation.\n\n\tThe Philippine metropolis joins a global network of 26 Cities of Film spanning Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Bradford, U.K. claimed the inaugural title in 2009, followed by Sydney in 2010. Other members include Busan, Galway, Rome, Bristol, Mumbai, São Paulo, and Wellington. Quezon City and Giza, Egypt were among the newest additions in the 2025 designation round.\n\t\n\n\tThe recognition arrives as the Philippine metropolis embraces its identity as QC Film City during this year’s QCinema International Film Festival. The city had previously declared itself as the heart of Philippine cinema, adopting the QC Film City theme for the festival.\n\n\n\t“QC Film City is now a name that will forever be etched in the legacy of every filmmaker, artist, and storyteller who has shaped our city’s vibrant film heritage,” said Mayor Joy Belmonte. “From the golden era of Sampaguita Pictures and the brilliance of icons like Lino Brocka, Dolphy, Nora Aunor and Fernando Poe Jr., to the new generation of creators bringing our stories to life today – this recognition honors each and every one of them.”\n\n\tThe UNESCO designation positions Quezon City to strengthen labor protections through the Eddie Garcia Law, ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions for film workers. The city also plans to develop sustainable talent programs and pursue global recognition for Filipino filmmakers.\n\n\tSpearheading the city’s application since 2023, the Quezon City Film Commission is rolling out three major initiatives: QC Screen Academy, a public training hub offering skills development across film development, production, distribution and marketing; Global Producers Exchange, a platform connecting producers from Southeast Asia and other UNESCO Creative Cities for collaboration; and the Southeast Asia Film Summit, an annual gathering of industry leaders, film commissions and policymakers to discuss regulations, incentives and financing.\n\t\n\n\t“This achievement is the culmination of years of collaboration, vision, and belief in the power of storytelling to shape our collective identity,” said QCFC executive director Liza Diño, crediting Belmonte’s “unwavering vision” for the milestone. “Her leadership has shown that creativity is not an afterthought of governance, but its very soul.”\n\n\tDiño emphasized the designation represents “a call to deepen our commitment to creative governance and cultural sustainability,” adding that the city is “ready to take on this responsibility, to open our doors to collaboration, and to continue building a city where stories thrive and creativity empowers every citizen.”\n\n\tBelmonte underscored that while the recognition marks a significant achievement, “the work starts again tomorrow,” with initiatives continuing to spotlight local film workers and provide quality film access to residents.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Taiwan Creative Content Agency (TAICCA) is spotlighting “The Void is Immense in Idle Hours,” a Filipino-Indonesian co-production examining grief and survival, at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF) running Nov. 4-7 in Taipei.\n\n\tDirected by Sam Manacsa and produced by Chad Cabigon and Carlo Francisco Manatad of Philippines-based NextLives, with Yulia Evina Bhara of Indonesian production company KawanKawan Media serving as co-producer, the project centers on 19-year-old Rosemary, who becomes the last person to see a young boy before his disappearance. Finding herself alongside the child’s grieving mother Agnes in the search, Rosemary confronts unspoken grief and forgotten dreams in the stillness of their shared days.\n\t\n\n\tThe film emerged from Manacsa’s personal exploration of living with daily grief in communities where people continue surviving even after profound loss. “It began with me processing the thought of living with grief every day, in spaces where people keep moving and surviving, even when something inside them has already been lost,” Manacsa says.\n\n\n\tThe narrative draws from the reality of mothers who have lost sons to violence without answers or justice. “In them, I saw how pain can exist alongside care, how strength and exhaustion can live in the same breath,” Manacsa explains. “That intimacy is what made me want to tell this story: the invisible weight of holding things together, of searching for meaning in repetition, of living on even when life feels paused.”\n\n\tManacsa describes the film’s core as exploring “quiet persistence” — the small, unspoken ways people keep moving when grief never ends. “In a society where violence has become ordinary, the film asks what kind of life is left to live, and what it still means to live at all,” the director says.\n\t\n\n\tThe production is currently in the financing stage, with plans to begin prep work in late 2026. Principal photography is targeted for the second quarter of 2027, with a 2028 release anticipated, according to producer Cabigon.\n\n\tAt TCCF, the team seeks production partners who share their vision for intimate, socially conscious storytelling. “We hope to find strong partnerships with producers, financiers, and co-production partners who share our commitment to telling intimate, socially rooted stories with care,” Cabigon says. “We hope to find people who will shape this film together with us, guiding its artistic and narrative journey in a safe space while keeping its emotional truths.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe series adaptation of the novel “The Accomplice” starring Taraji P. Henson has landed at Peacock for development, Variety has learned. \n\n\tThe project is based on the novel of the same name written by Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson and Aaron Phillip Clark, which was published in 2024. Jackson will executive produce via G-Unit Films and Television, while Henson will executive produce in addition to starring under her TPH Entertainment banner. UCP will produce. No writer is currently attached. \n\t\n\n\tJackson had previously spoken about the project and Henson’s casting in an interview with “The Breakfast Club” in October. \n\n\n\tThe logline for the project states, “Nia Adams (Henson), a fearless Texas Ranger on the trail of master thief Desmond Bell, whose latest target is one of America’s wealthiest families. As Nia closes in, she uncovers a conspiracy so explosive it forces her to choose between exposing the truth and protecting the very system she swore to serve.” \n\n\tShould “The Accomplice” go to series, it would mark Henson’s second show at Peacock. She previously appeared in the star-studded drama “Fight Night: The Million Dollar Heist” alongside Kevin Hart, Samuel L. Jackson, and her former “Empire” and “Hustle & Flow” co-star Terrence Howard. \n\n\tHenson is one of the most celebrated actresses of her time. She received an Academy Award nomination in 2009 for “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” and went on to star in the Oscar-nominated historical drama “Hidden Figures.” Henson’s other notable film roles include “Hustle & Flow,” 2023’s “The Color Purple,” and both “Think Like a Man” and “Think Like a Man Too.” Henson is also well known for her starring role in the Fox music industry drama “Empire,” for which she earned two Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe win. She has also received Emmy nominations for her guest role on “Abbott Elementary” and for the Lifetime movie “Taken from Me: The Tiffany Rubin Story.” \n\t\n\n\tHenson is repped by IAG, M88, and Lichter Grossman. \n\n\tJackson is an executive producer on Starz’s incredibly popular “Power” franchise. On that front, “Power Book III: Raising Kanan” is currently prepping its fifth and final season, while the third and final season of “Power Book IV: Force” premieres on Nov. 7. Starz is also currently at work on the prequel “Power: Origins,” while the spinoff “Power: Legacy” is in development with a writers’ room now open. Jackson is also executive producing the upcoming Starz boxing drama “Fightland,” while he has multiple scripted series, docuseries, and films in the works across not only Starz but also streamers like Hulu and several others. As an actor, Jackson will also appear in the upcoming “Street Fighter” movie as Balrog.\n\n\tJackson is repped by IAG and Savva Entertainment. \n",

    "body": "\n\tVolos Films is betting big on genre-bending storytelling as it unveils a new slate at Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF), marking the production company’s pivot into scripted drama series alongside its feature film slate.\n\n\tThe Italy-Taiwan outfit, founded by Italian-Taiwanese producer Stefano Centini, is bringing three projects to TCCF that span borders and formats — from a nostalgic coming-of-age adventure to a supernatural thriller and a high-stakes wedding dramedy.\n\t\n\n\tLeading the pack is “Game Never Over,” a feature adaptation of Sean Chuang’s bestselling comic “80’s Diary in Taiwan,” which has been translated into French, Italian and German. The 1980s-set adventure follows 13-year-old Chuang, a self-described class loser, and his band of misfit friends who discover a magical arcade that grants wishes. When the arcade suddenly closes, the teens embark on a quest to retrieve the mysterious game machine, ultimately learning that “the real magic is hidden in the courage to choose one’s own path.”\n\n\n\tChuang penned the screenplay alongside Shi-Ming Ho, whose credits include Rene Liu’s “Us and Them” and Netflix drama “Forget You Not.” Volos’ Hung Sung-Ju produces, with Centini and Chuti Chang executive producing.\n\n\t“This film is a nostalgic, funny, and heartfelt coming-of-age adventure about courage, friendship, and the experiences that shape who we become,” said producer Hung. “Through the eyes of boys growing up in 1980s Taiwan, audiences are invited to revisit that fragile yet powerful moment when we first begin to understand ourselves and others.”\n\n\tThe company is also pitching “The Fundamentals,” a supernatural thriller series marking Volos’ second collaboration with Singaporean director Yeo Siew-Hua, whose feature “Stranger Eyes” competed at Venice and earned six Golden Horse nominations. Set in a remote mountainous village in Taiwan, the series was selected for this year’s Series Mania Institute Serial Bridges Asia program.\n\t\n\n\tCreated by Yeo and written with Taiwanese scribes Wang Jen Fang, Ting Chi-Wen and Rebecca Chen, the series features an all-Taiwanese cast and is co-produced with Singapore’s Akanga production house. The project represents Volos’ first series development, though its Italian division is also venturing into drama with “Hallyu,” currently selected for the Apollo program at Series Mania Institute.\n\n\t“As we keep our focus on director-driven and ground-breaking cinema, we are more and more aware of the need to diversify in the content strategy, and open to new forms of narration and storytelling,” said Centini. “This is the reason why we decided to venture into our first drama development with Akanga and director Yeo.”\n\n\tRounding out the slate is “Never the Bride,” a series created and produced by Liza Diño-Seguerra set in the high-stress world of Filipino luxury weddings. The show follows cynical wedding planner Sofia Aragaon and her dysfunctional team as they navigate diva brides, nightmare families and glitter explosions while quietly falling apart behind the scenes. The series, set across the Philippines, Taiwan and France, is co-produced with France’s Ghost City Films and will be pitched in TCCF’s If Romance Comes Again session.\n\n\tCentini emphasized the company’s commitment to bridging European and Asian markets through its dual-based structure. “We strongly believe that there is a convergence of ideals and a possibility to perform well in both markets for stories that are universal, engaging for the audience and at the same time unique to their culture and true to their creators,” he said.\n\n\tThe company recently pitched projects developed in Italy at Busan’s Asian Project Market, Tokyo’s TIFFCOM and Rome’s MIA, signaling its continued expansion across both continents.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Société civile des éditeurs de langue française (SCELF), the French-language publishers’ association, is returning to Taipei for the second edition of Shoot The Book! at the Taiwan Creative Content Festival (TCCF), running Nov. 4-7.\n\n\tThe initiative, organized in collaboration with TAICCA (Taiwan Creative Content Agency) and supported by the Institut français and the French Office in Taipei, aims to foster connections between French publishers and Asian audiovisual professionals while promoting book-to-screen adaptations.\n\t\n\n\tThe program’s debut at last year’s TCCF has already yielded tangible results. The French children’s book “Bob et Marley” by author-illustrator Frédéric Marais, published by Seuil Jeunesse, is now in development as a Franco-Taiwanese co-production with Go-N Productions and Lusasa Animation.\n\n\n\tAs part of a strategic alliance with TAICCA, SCELF is accompanying its publisher members to Taipei for the second consecutive year to promote meetings with audiovisual professionals and the development of book adaptations in Asia. This new edition of Shoot the Book! aims to strengthen connections between publishers and producers in Asia, while promoting French literary talent and publishers’ expertise in IP and adaptation.\n\n\tSeven titles with strong adaptation potential – four French and three Taiwanese – have been selected by a jury of audiovisual professionals for this year’s pitch session The French slate includes Victor Dixen’s “Agence Perdido” (Bayard), Jean Christophe Grangé’s “Flight of the Storks” (Albin Michel), Caroline Dorka’s “Rosa Dolorosa” (Fenech – Media Participations – Mediatoon – Éditions de la Martinière), Noëlle Michel’s “Demain les ombres” (Editis – Le Bruit du Monde), and Emma Green’s “If You Wanna Be My Lover” (Media Participations – Mediatoon – Éditions Addictives).\n\t\n\n\tThe Taiwanese selections feature Tymo Lin’s “U.N.D.E.R.: The Jade Corpses” (Kadokawa Taiwan Corporation), Xerxes’ “Fish Eye” (Links Publishing Ltd.), and Windsays’ “Greenhouse Chick” (Kadokawa Taiwan Corporation).\n\n\tThe jury panel comprises Jeyi An, producer and director at Taiwan’s Eightgeman Co., Ltd.; Panu Aree, director and development director at Thailand’s Neramitnung Film Co., Ltd.; and Ileana J. Sung, international content producer at South Korea’s Mr. Romance.\n\n\tB2b meetings will run throughout the festival alongside the pitch session.\n\n\tEstablished in 1960, SCELF is a collective management organization created by publishers to collect and distribute royalties generated by various forms of exploitation derived from literary works, including audiovisual, theatrical, and musical adaptations, and radio productions. Acting as a bridge between the cultural and creative industries, the organization supports publishers and their authors in managing and promoting the adaptation rights of their literary works, and develops training initiatives for its more than 400 publisher members.\n\n\tThe organization launched Shoot The Book! 12 years ago to create synergies between book publishers and audiovisual players, maintaining a presence at major industry events including Cannes Film Market, Séries Mania, and Rome’s MIA.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLaura Dern loved her mother, and that was evident anytime she had a chance to talk about it.\n\n\tIn a conversation recorded just two weeks before her mother Diane Ladd’s death on Monday, the Oscar-winning actress spoke movingly about both of her parents for an upcoming episode of the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast.\n\n\tWhile Dern joined the show to talk about her performances in Noah Baumbach’s “Jay Kelly” and Bradley Cooper’s “Is This Thing On,” she spoke about her personal reflections on family, longevity and purpose — themes that echo through both her work and her life.\n\t\n\n\tThere’s a particular radiance that comes over Laura Dern when she speaks about her mother. Sitting across from her that late October afternoon, I watched as her entire demeanor shifted the moment we turned to discussing Diane Ladd. Her voice softened, her eyes brightened, and she leaned forward with an intensity that can only come from profound love and admiration. It wasn’t just nostalgia or daughterly devotion — it was the kind of reverence one artist holds for another, amplified by the sacred bond of family.\n\n\tWhat struck me most was how Dern spoke of her mother in the present tense, with such vitality and pride. There was no sense of looking back at a legacy already written; instead, she spoke of her parents as active forces, still creating, still inspiring. “They inspire me every day to just keep going,” she said. \n\n\t“They’re doing great,” Dern said at the time about both of her parents, including father Bruce Dern, and her voice filled with admiration. “I’m so moved in learning more about the longevity research, particularly that Dan Buettner has done on what really matters. The greatest path to longevity is purpose — and a purpose-driven life and a service-driven life.”\n\t\n\n\tBoth 89, years old, Dern’s parents were still working in the industry. “Retirement has never been a word I understood or knew in my family,” she said. “They’re such amazing storytellers and radical characters. They inspire me every day to just keep going.”\n\n\tThe conversation turned especially poignant when Dern discussed the practical realities facing older performers, noting that the Screen Actors Guild provides no comprehensive health care plan for retired actors. “A lot of actors of my parents’ generation are desperately looking for two days on a TV show in their 80s, because they’ve got to work a certain amount of hours to continue to qualify for their health insurance,” she explained. “It’s heartbreaking.”\n\n\tWhen asked about her mother’s finest work, Dern didn’t hesitate. “‘Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore’ is one of my favorite all-time performances by an actress,” she said of the 1974 Martin Scorsese film that earned Ladd her first Oscar nomination.\n\n\tDern also recalled her very first experience at the Academy Awards, when she attended as a child alongside her mother during that nomination year. “I was seven and scared,” she said with a laugh. “It’s so loud — people are yelling and excited, but when you’re seven, noise is scary. There are pictures of my mom looking very glamorous and smiling for the cameras on the red carpet, and you can see my clenched fists digging into her arm. I had big Coke-bottle eyeglasses and just looked really nervous.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Rambling Rose”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©New Line Cinema/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tYears later, in 1992, Dern and Ladd made history together when they both received Academy Award nominations for “Rambling Rose,” marking the first time a mother and daughter had been nominated for the same film. “The call came from my publicist, Annette Wolf,” Dern remembered. “‘Laura, dear, you and your mother have just both been nominated for Academy Awards for the movie.’ I was 21 years old. We brought my grandmother with us, and as a family, it was a very beautiful memory.”\n\n\tThroughout the conversation, Dern’s reverence for her mother — as both an artist and a woman of deep conviction — shone through. “My mom taught me to lead with empathy and purpose,” she said with such conviction. “That’s what keeps me in love with storytelling.”\n\n\tNow, in the wake of Ladd’s death, the upcoming interview standa as a heartfelt tribute to an extraordinary life and the unbreakable bond between a mother and daughter — two generations of women who redefined endurance, artistry and grace in Hollywood.\n\t\n\n\tThe full episode of the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast featuring this conversation will be released in the coming weeks.\n",

It’s just as outrageous and fun as the premise sounds, and that’s before Jesus has a serious showdown with Satan. Writer-director Lotfy Nathan somehow keeps this wild vision together.\n\n\t“Zodiac Killer Project” (Opening in theaters on Nov. 21 via Music Box Films) — Filmmaker Charlie Shackleton won the NEXT Innovator Award when this meta work debuted at Sundance earlier this year. This documentary is more a meditation on the true crime genre itself, rather than a beat-by-beat examination of the elusive killer. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKiller Series\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Shudder\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“The Creep Tapes” (Season 2) (Premiering on Shudder on Nov. 15) — Mark Duplass returns as the bloodthirsty Peachfuzz in this wonderfully demented film franchise-turned-series. The short episode length encourages bite-sized sketches of madness for those of us who still wish it was spooky season.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBloodcurdling Books\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Berkley\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“The Place Where They Buried Your Heart” by Christina Henry (Releasing Nov. 4 via Berkley) — This chilling story follows a young girl named Jessie whose brother is seemingly “eaten” by an abandoned house, never to return. Years later, Jessie looks for answers in Christina Henry’s slow-burning, character-focused haunted house novel.\n\n\t“Bones of Our Stars, Blood of Our World: A Novel of Terror” by Cullen Bunn (Releasing Nov. 11 via Gallery Books) — Marvel Comics writer Cullen Bunn delivers this tale of a Southern town overtaken by evil after the arrest of a suspected serial killer — and the residents who must fight back. It’s a brisk read with great details that make the embattled Wilson Island seem all the more real, and the threats increasingly urgent. \n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEverything’s Coming Up L.A.\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA Shohei Ohtani Home Run Ball From the NLCS Could Fetch More Than $1 Million at Auction\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTexas All-Star Cheer Gym Declares Bankruptcy Before Sex Abuse Trial\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChristian Audigier Relaunches, Targeting Y2K Nostalgia and New Consumers\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

ChatGPT.\n      \n    \n          While taking Vanity Fair's infamous lie detector test, dictated by her \"All's Fair\" costar Teyana Taylor, Kim admitted to using ChatGPT to help her studies ... but it's not a ringing endorsement.\n      \n    \n          She confessed ... \"I use it for legal advice, so when I need to know the answer to a question, I'll take a picture and snap it and put it in there.\"\n      \n\n          While technically cheating, it's been to no avail. She claims it's always wrong!\n      \n    \n          \"It has made me fail tests ... all the time,\" she complained. \"And then I'll get mad and I'll yell at it.\"\n      \n    \n          According to Kim K, OpenAI needs to do better, because she's \"leaning to them to really help me.\"\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          Oh boy ... Well, the good news for Kim is that she can retake the California bar as many times as she has to. She passed the \"baby bar\" -- the first-year law students' exam -- after her fourth attempt back in 2021.\n      \n    \n          The official California bar is a grueling 2-day test, consisting of 5 one-hour essay questions, one 90-minute performance test, and 200 multiple-choice questions. It's one of the hardest in the nation, with a passage rate for the July 2024 test at 53.8%.\n      \n    \n          Artificial Intelligence could never!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Kim Kardashian\n              \n                          \n                Teyana Taylor\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Artificial Intelligence\n              \n                          \n                Interview\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                The Kardashians\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

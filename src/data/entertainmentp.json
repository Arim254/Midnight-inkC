    "body": "\n\tKorean sales powerhouse Finecut has bolstered its European Film Market offerings with two new acquisitions: the 3D animated feature “Long Long Night” and auteur Hong Sangsoo‘s latest work “The Day She Returns,” which has been selected for the Panorama section at the 76th Berlin Film Festival.\n\n\t“Long Long Night” adapts an award-winning Korean novel that has sold 700,000 copies locally. The source material earned the Grand Prize at the 2020 Munhakdongne Children’s Literature Award and was featured on the International Youth Library’s 2021 White Ravens list in Munich. International editions have been released in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Türkiye, with a Chinese version forthcoming. The property has also been adapted into a stage musical.\n\t\n\n\tThe animated feature tells the story of the last rhino of his kind who befriends a penguin hatched from an abandoned egg, embarking on a journey to the ocean together. The narrative draws inspiration from Sudan, the last surviving northern white rhino on Earth. Director Youm Kyu-bock is utilizing Unreal Engine, a real-time 3D creation platform, to achieve realistic detailed imagery. Currently in production, the film is produced by Googgoog and Studio Eon, with presentation by The Contents On.\n\n\n\t“The Day She Returns” is Hong Sangsoo’s 34th feature film and marks his seventh year at the Berlinale, following his most recent title “What Does That Nature Say to You” (2025). The film follows an actor giving promotional interviews to support her comeback film, a process that proves more difficult than anticipated. The project reunites Hong with actress Song Sunmi, who previously starred in his “In Our Day” (2023), which closed the Cannes Directors’ Fortnight. Following its world premiere at the Berlinale, the film is scheduled for theatrical release in the first half of 2026. Jeonwonsa Film Co. serves as producer.\n\t\n\n\tFinecut’s EFM slate also includes “Tristes Tropiques,” an action-noir from genre director Park Hoon-jung currently in post-production. The film’s initial cut premiered in the Òrbita Competition section at Sitges.\n\n\tAdditional titles include “Journey There,” starring Justin H. Min of Netflix’s “The Umbrella Academy,” which won two awards at the Busan International Film Festival. The drama follows an elderly woman who finds comfort with strangers while navigating end-of-life decisions.\n\n\tThe lineup is rounded out by “Wrangler,” a psychological thriller about a dog trainer whose controlled life begins to unravel, which was invited to Vancouver, and “Time of Cinema,” an anthology featuring works from three Korean directors: Lee Jong-pil, Yoon Ga-eun and Jang Kun-jae.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Hong Kong International Film Festival Society has finalized the program for the 24th Hong Kong-Asia Film Financing Forum (HAF), adding 13 projects featuring McDull creator Brian Tse, Sundance winner Alireza Ghasemi and Turkish director Tayfun Pirselimoglu to complete a 42-title lineup set for presentation March 17-19 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.\n\n\tThe final batch comprises seven animated features and six genre works at various development and production stages, joining 29 previously announced in-development and work-in-progress projects. All titles will be showcased at the HKIFF Industry Project Market alongside FilMart, now in its 30th edition.\n\t\n\n\tThree of the newly announced projects are in production or post-production: Brian Tse’s “The Excreman – On the Road,” Avid Liongoren’s “Zsazsa Zaturnnah” and Qin Yuqi’s suspense thriller “What My Bones Know.” The trio will pitch at the WIP Open Pitch session on March 17 alongside the previously announced 12 work-in-progress titles.\n\n\n\tHAF’s dedicated animation section, launched last year, has quickly established a track record for festival success. Xu Zao’s “Light Pillar” is set to premiere at Berlinale’s Perspectives section this month, while Toe Yuen’s “A Mighty Adventure” won the Golden Horse Award for best sound effects last November. Both projects emerged from the section’s inaugural edition.\n\n\tThe animation slate features Tse, creator of the McDull franchise, directing “The Excreman – On the Road,” about a massive piece of excrement that defeats a plumber dispatched to cleanse a sewer community, then assumes the plumber’s identity to begin a new human life.\n\t\n\n\tJhun Yong Duk, co-director of “The Tiger’s Apprentice,” helms “Fish Ball,” following a ruthless general reborn as a sardine who leads an underwater army against predators using military tactics.\n\n\tAlireza Ghasemi, whose “In the Land of Brothers” won the Sundance World Cinema Dramatic Competition’s directing award in 2024, directs “Rainy Dreams,” a hybrid animation-live action work tracking six displaced children in Calais as they navigate their fears and aspirations through nightly dreams.\n\n\tChen Xudong makes his feature debut with stop-motion monster film “Roxanne,” set in a post-apocalyptic ocean and following a boy born at sea searching for humanity’s last hope. The project is produced by Lu Xiaowei, whose “Light Pillar” screens at Berlinale Perspectives this year.\n\n\tCarl Josep E. Papa, whose “The Missing” won best animated film at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards in 2024, directs multi-perspective drama “Sentinel,” centered on a transfer student, editor-in-chief and school principal who clash when a campus newspaper article exposes violence in the school’s military training program.\n\n\tProducer Isabelle Glachant reunites with director Lei Lei on “Tooth and Tales,” a fairy tale about a boy searching for the story that can heal his toothache. Lei’s “Silver Bird and Rainbow Fish” competed in Rotterdam’s Tiger Competition in 2022.\n\n\tLiongoren, whose “Hayop Ka!” competed at Annecy in 2020, directs “Zsazsa Zaturnnah,” about a shy gay hairdresser who swallows a space rock that transforms him into a flamboyant female superhero, compelling him to battle zombies and aliens.\n\n\tThe genre slate spans psychological thrillers, body horror and action drama across diverse international settings. Zhou Jinghao, whose “Girl on Edge” screened in Cannes Directors’ Fortnight in 2025, directs suspense drama “In the Name of Right” about a maintenance worker whose decision to help a struggling employee triggers a fatal accident. Leste Chen produces.\n\n\tTayfun Pirselimoglu, whose “Kerr” served as Turkey’s Academy Awards submission in 2023, helms crime thriller “The Power Plant,” following a dangerous liaison between a married meatball vendor and an excavator operator amid mutilated murders in a snow-covered mining town.\n\n\tPark Kiyong, director of “Gangwondo” in 2021, helms action drama “Searchers: Blood in the Grass,” tracking a Korean apple farmer who teams with his reluctant Mongolian father-in-law to rescue his pregnant wife from a powerful political dynasty involved in international fentanyl trafficking.\n\t\n\n\tLam Li Shuen, co-director of “Born of the Yam,” which screens in Berlinale Forum Expanded this year, directs mythological body horror “Strange Root” (Keinginan), set in 11th-century Singapore and featuring a demi-god born from a yam who is driven toward violent and erotic confrontation after being cast aside.\n\n\tGabriel Motta makes his feature debut with supernatural horror “The Veil,” exploring violence within faith and family through a religious cult founded on fake possession rituals that descends into darkness when a vengeful entity genuinely possesses the pastor’s daughter. Motta’s short film “The Veil” screened at Toronto in 2025.\n\n\tQin’s debut “What My Bones Know” is set in a freezing, dying mining town and entangles a college graduate, a terminally ill miner and a runaway accountant, all drawn to a local tavern following the discovery of a severed ear.\n\n\tAll work-in-progress projects will pitch March 17 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre’s Starlight Theatre, with teams presenting 10-minute first looks to industry attendees including distributors, producers, investors, festival programmers and funding representatives.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKorean entertainment giant CJ ENM celebrated the creative forces behind six globally successful original IPs at its 2026 Visionary Awards ceremony on Feb. 10 at the CJ ENM Center in Seoul’s Mapo-gu district.\n\n\tThe event honored visionaries from U.S. series “Severance” and Korean productions “Bon Appétit, Your Majesty,” “Boys II Planet,” “Our Unwritten Seoul” and “Study Group,” along with the Japanese adaptation of “Marry My Husband” – marking CJ ENM’s continued expansion into international co-productions and overseas projects. The ceremony drew particular attention for bringing together creators from both Korean productions and global collaborations, including “Severance” producer Nicholas Weinstock and Japanese actor Takeru Satoh from “Marry My Husband.”\n\t\n\n\tSince 2020, CJ ENM has designated as “Visionaries” the creators and projects that have introduced fresh creative visions to the entertainment industry and expanded their cultural footprint globally through distinctive originality. This year’s selections focused on characters as a core driver of IP competitiveness, recognizing the actors who portrayed beloved characters alongside the directors, producers and writers who brought them to life.\n\n\n\tThe awards venue was designed around the theme of an “Originality Construction Site,” conceived as a space for building a House of Inspiration – symbolizing a place where one story does not end but a new one begins.\n\n\tWeinstock praised the ceremony’s focus on creative ambition over commercial metrics. “I’m very excited about the commitment that many of us in this room are making to telling great and bold stories,” he said. “I think there’s a reason CJ ENM is giving the Visionary Award rather than a quarterly revenues award. I believe it’s a company devoted to boldness and creativity.” The producer also expressed admiration for presenter Youn Yuh-jung, a 2021 Visionary and the first Korean actor to receive an Academy Award. “I watched ‘Minari’ three times in a row just to see her performance,” Weinstock said.\n\t\n\n\tTakeru Satoh reflected on character development. “As actors, we are constantly thinking about how to make the roles we play more compelling and more loved by the audiences,” he said. “It’s a great honor to be here with all of you professionals who create these unforgettable characters.”\n\n\tPark Min Young from “Marry My Husband” described the project as transformative. “This project was like a second chance in my life. While it tells a Korean story, I learned that sincerity resonates with audiences worldwide,” she said.\n\n\tFrom “Bon Appétit, Your Majesty,” Lim YoonA shared her connection to her character. “It was a great joy to portray Yeon Ji-young, a strong and wise character who never loses her dream, no matter the circumstances,” she said.\n\n\tIn a congratulatory video message, CJ Group vice chair Miky Lee emphasized the power of storytelling. “Technology has brought the world closer than ever, but it is stories that truly bring people together,” she said. “CJ ENM will be your partner in this journey.”\n\n\tCJ ENM CEO Yoon Sang-hyun added: “The most compelling stories begin with characters shaped together by creators and artists. We will expand Onlyone IPs, stories that become life-defining works for audiences worldwide and build a new ecosystem for the global cultural business.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRoh Films Germany is returning to India for its first local production since “The Lunchbox” (2013), partnering with First Ray Films India on noir thriller “But First, The Burning.”\n\n\tThe film will be directed by Indian filmmaker Devashish Makhija and star Anshuman Jha. France’s En Compagnie des Lamas (“Manto”), led by Sandrine Brauer, is confirmed to join as French producer. Details will be finalised at the Berlin European Film Market. \n\t\n\n\t“But First, The Burning” follows two brothers sharing one identity in a desperate town, where a small deceit meant to double their chances at survival spirals into a deadly game of secrets with only one survivor.\n\n\n\tMakhija’s internationally recognized filmography includes “Joram,” “Bhonsle” and “Ajji.” His Netflix thriller “Gandhari” is due this year. Jha has built a diverse career across projects including “Love Sex Aur Dhokha,” “Chauranga” and “Lakadbaggha.” \n\n\tThe film is scheduled to begin production in October, following the release of Jha’s action sequel “Lakadbaggha 2.” Jha will represent the film in Berlin as leading actor and executive producer.\n\n\t“Integrity. Conviction. And unadulterated vision – is the basis of this partnership,” Jha said. “We are thrilled to have Roh and Lamas on board for this film which would mark our seventh production. And probably the most ambitious one with one of my favorite cinema makers in India – Devashish.”\n\n\tBenny Drechsel of Roh Films Germany said: “I really think that ‘But First, The Burning’ is probably the most compelling script from India since ‘The Lunchbox.'”\n\n\tSandrine Brauer of Lamas added: “I’m very proud to join forces with the creative duo formed by Anshuman and Devashish. Their film casts a lucid, uncompromising, yet deeply necessary light on the spiral of violence. Devashish’s previous films already reveal a distinctive and promising voice, with a rare ability to take us on powerful and compelling cinematic journeys.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Pima County Sheriff’s Department announced on X Tuesday night that it, in collaboration with the FBI, has detained a person for questioning in connection with the disappearance of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie‘s 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie.\n\n\n\tThe Pima County Sheriff’s Department said the person was detained south of Tucson, Ariz. during a traffic stop. Authorities told ABC that law enforcement is preparing to search a location in relation to the detainee. There was no indication whether the detainee was the individual in the front door photos released on Tuesday morning.\n\t\n\n\tNancy Guthrie, 84, disappeared from her Arizona home on Jan. 31, triggering an intensive investigation that has brought “Today” show co-anchor Savannah Guthrie’s personal tragedy into the public eye.\n\n\n\tThe Pima County Sheriff’s Office declared the disappearance a crime on Feb. 2 after investigators discovered “concerning” evidence at Nancy’s home. Sheriff Chris Nanos said he believed Nancy “did not leave on her own.” Authorities have not identified any suspects, and they received an alleged ransom note with deadlines set for Friday, Feb. 6, and Monday, Feb. 9.\n\n\tSavannah shared a message Monday on Instagram as the search for her missing mother entered its second week. “We’re at an hour of desperation,” she said in the video message.\n\n\tFormer co-anchor Hoda Kotb also returned to the “Today” show on Monday, filling in alongside Craig Melvin while Savannah remained with her family in Arizona. “We are a family, and we show up for each other,” Kotb said during the broadcast.\n\t\n\n\tThe FBI offered a $50,000 reward Thursday for information leading to Nancy’s recovery “and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.” FBI Special Agent in Charge Heith Janke said agents are “working day and night” with local authorities.\n\n\tOn Saturday, the Guthrie siblings posted another video expressing their willingness to pay a ransom. “We received your message, and we understand,” Savannah said, sitting beside by siblings Camron and Annie. “We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”\n\n\tThis followed an emotional video shared to Instagram on Wednesday in which the siblings pleaded for proof of life. “She’s 84 years old. Her health, her heart, is fragile,” Savannah said. “We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe premium streaming market in Southeast Asia gained significant momentum in 2025, powered by a resurgence in account growth, expanded connected TV adoption and a landmark year for locally produced programming, new data from Media Partners Asia and its measurement platform AMPD shows.\n\n\tPaid streaming accounts across the region increased 19% year-over-year to exceed 61 million across Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore in 2025. Indonesia dominated new account additions and consumed the largest portion of total watch time, while Thailand and the Philippines contributed consistent incremental expansion. In Malaysia and Singapore, where markets have reached saturation, operators focused on boosting user activity and revenue generation rather than adding subscribers.\n\t\n\n\tSoutheast Asian viewers consumed 4.2 billion hours of premium streaming content in the final quarter of 2025, up 8% from the previous quarter. Netflix‘s regional viewing jumped 14% while iQIYI climbed 10%, though Indonesian service Vidio posted the sharpest increase at 24%.\n\n\n\tIndonesia’s streaming subscriber base expanded to 26.9 million accounts, with Netflix, Vidio, Viu and iQIYI all contributing to the gains. The market reached a historic milestone in Q4 2025 as Indonesian productions equaled Korean programming in viewership share at 30% each, while both content types reached nearly identical portions of the user base at 47-48%. Several Indonesian originals placed among the quarter’s top-performing titles, led predominantly by Vidio’s content lineup, demonstrating how homegrown productions are becoming commercially viable drivers of subscriber acquisition and retention.\n\t\n\n\t“Korean content continued to anchor reach across Southeast Asia in 2025, but local originals are now playing a far more central role in driving both acquisition and engagement,” said Dhivya T, lead analyst and head of insights at MPA and AMPD. “Indonesia stood out this year, with local titles competing directly with Korean dramas at the top of the premium VOD rankings. This is a meaningful shift that reflects improving content quality, stronger distribution and rising audience confidence in local storytelling. Thai content also demonstrated strong cross-border travelability, while Chinese dramas remained a key engagement driver on freemium and hybrid platforms across multiple markets.”\n\n\tNetflix held its position as the region’s dominant streaming service across all key metrics including subscriber count, monthly active users and total watch time. The platform’s strength came from its combination of global hit franchises, major Korean series and locally acquired content from Indonesia and Thailand. Viu claimed the second spot regionally in subscribers, MAUs and user engagement for 2025, benefiting from consistent appetite for Korean and Chinese dramas alongside targeted local productions.\n\n\tVidio led among Indonesian local platforms in both subscribers and monthly active users while placing second to Netflix in watch time and revenue generation. The service recorded the region’s second-highest streaming hours in Q4 trailing only Netflix, propelled by an expanding library of Indonesian originals and sports programming. iQIYI regained subscriber and viewership momentum in the latter half of 2025, especially in Indonesia and Thailand, driven by full-length Chinese dramas, live-action productions, Chinese short-form dramas and Thai series.\n\n\tThai productions achieved the strongest international reach within Southeast Asia, drawing 11.1 million viewers from outside Thailand’s borders. This performance stemmed largely from Netflix-licensed and Netflix-produced horror films and series.\n\n\tAMPD’s expansion of connected TV tracking beginning in Q2 2025 uncovered a substantial shift in how Southeast Asian audiences consume streaming content. Although mobile devices continue to serve as the dominant viewing platform, connected TVs now account for an increasing portion of total watch hours, longer individual viewing sessions, and greater interaction with episodic series, feature films, sports broadcasts and content watched by multiple household members. The growth in connected TV usage proved most dramatic in Indonesia and the Philippines, highlighting how living room viewing on large screens is becoming central to the streaming category’s evolution.\n\t\n\n\tIndustry concentration intensified as three to four platforms captured roughly 70% of subscriptions and viewing activity across markets, indicating the sector is consolidating around a small group of leading services.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBad Bunny‘s Super Bowl halftime show — or the “Benito Bowl,” as it was affectionally named by his fans — reached an average of 128.2 million viewers on Sunday.\n\n\tMeasured by Nielsen, that’s above the 124.9 million average viewers achieved by this year’s Super Bowl overall but down from the 133.5 million viewers achieved by Kendrick Lamar, who set the record last year. Before Lamar, the record was held by Usher for his 2024 performance.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to Ripple Analytics, total social consumption of the halftime show — including fans, owned platforms, broadcast partners and influencers — hit four billion views after 24 hours (up 137% from last year).\n\n\n\tAlso, the NFL’s top three most-viewed social posts of all time now come from the Bad Bunny halftime show: “Only Thing More Powerful Than Hate Is Love” (179 million views on Instagram, most viewed clip on NFL social ever); Bad Bunny listing the countries of the Americas before spiking the football at the end of his performance (168 million views on Instagram) and that same clip on TikTok (100 million views).\n\n\tAccording to Apple Music, listens of Bad Bunny music was up seven times following the halftime show, led by “DtMF,” “BAILE INoLVIDABLE,” and “Tití Me Preguntó.” \n\n\tAccording to the NFL, more than half of its social views came from international markets; with full global viewership for the “Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show” available early next week, that U.S.-only number of 124.9 million viewers could go up dramatically once worldwide data is in.\n\n\tThe halftime show began making headlines months before the big game was even played, both because of Bad Bunny’s status as one of the world’s most popular recording artists in the world right now and because of complaints from right-wing commentators about his penchant for centering his Puerto Rican heritage in his work. Turning Point USA, the conservative group co-founded by the late Charlie Kirk, produced its own alternative halftime show “for folks who love America,” per headliner Kid Rock. Ultimately, TPUSA was unable to compete: the New York Times reported that the YouTube livestream peaked with 6.1 million viewers during the show, and it has since reached 21 million viewers — compared to Bad Bunny’s massive viewership on Sunday and 57 million YouTube views.\n\t\n\n\tHighlights from Bad Bunny’s performance included a real wedding, several stunts, appearances from Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, 380 people dressed like grass and more. Read Variety‘s interview breaking down the biggest moments with the halftime show’s producers here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSandra Bernhard has checked into “The White Lotus” Season 4.\n\n\tThe “Severance” and “Marty Supreme” actor joins previously announced cast members Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Coogan, Caleb Jonte Edwards, Marissa Long, Alexander Ludwig, Chris Messina and AJ Michalka in the France-set installment of the HBO vacation dramedy. \n\n\tDetails on Bernard’s role are unclear. Additional casting has yet to be announced as creator Mike White rounds out his Season 4 ensemble.\n\t\n\n\tAs Variety exclusively reported in January, “The White Lotus” Season 4 will shoot primarily at a 19th-century palace-turned-luxury hotel called the Château de La Messardière in Saint-Tropez on the Côte d’Azur. (This marks the first season to be housed at a non-Four Seasons resort.) Sources tell Variety the story will also unfold along the French Riviera and in Paris, with the possibility of Cannes Film Festival being factored into the plot.\n\n\n\tWhite executive produces “The White Lotus” alongside David Bernad and Mark Kamine. The series, which has previously taken place in Hawaii, Italy and Thailand, is an awards magnet, winning 16 Emmys and nabbing 66 nominations.\n\n\tWith more than 100 acting credits under her belt, Bernhard is best known for her film roles in “The King of Comedy,” “Hudson Hawk” and “Without You I’m Nothing.” She also starred as Nancy Bartlett Thomas on the ABC sitcom “Roseanne” and played Nurse Judy Kubrak in Ryan Murphy’s FX series “Pose.” Her recent credits include the Timothée Chalamet Oscar vehicle “Marty Supreme” and Apple TV’s “Severance,” in which she played a menacing scientist in the final episodes of Season 2.\n\t\n\n\tDeadline reported the news first.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThis year’s nominees for the 98th Academy Awards gathered under one roof Tuesday afternoon for the annual Oscars luncheon at the Beverly Hilton Hotel — a rare pause in the relentless awards-season sprint where competitors became colleagues and rivals turned conversationalists. It is, in many ways, the last truly “happy” day of the season. Everyone in the room is still a winner in the most literal sense: They made it inside.\n\n\tHeld within the Wilshire Ballroom, the luncheon is a carefully controlled logistical ritual. Nominees arrive through a no-frills process in which personal publicists are notably absent unless attending as a plus-one. Table assignments are randomized. There are no entourages, no strategy sessions; just artists and collaborators sharing space. For many, it is the first moment when the reality of an Oscar nomination fully sinks in.\n\t\n\n\tLynette Howell Taylor, the newly elected president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who took office in July 2025 after succeeding Janet Yang, delivered the welcome remarks, underscoring both the significance of the moment and the communal spirit of the gathering. Casting directors, she noted pointedly, were among those being honored this year.\n\n\n\tThe nominations were dominated by Warner Bros., powered by a one-two punch from two of cinema’s most acclaimed auteurs: Paul Thomas Anderson with “One Battle After Another” and Ryan Coogler with “Sinners.” Coogler’s vampire epic led the field with a record-setting 16 nominations, while Anderson’s action drama followed closely with 13. Both films earned best picture nominations alongside “Bugonia,” “F1,” “Frankenstein,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme,” “The Secret Agent,” “Sentimental Value” and “Train Dreams.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 10: (L-R) Ryan Coogler and Zinzi Coogler attend the 98th Oscar Nominees Luncheon at The Beverly Hilton on February 10, 2026 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt’s an impossible task to judge applause, but everyone knew who got the loudest one\n\n\tIt is always risky to declare a winner in a room governed by decorum, but one reaction was impossible to miss. When Ryan Coogler’s name was read — for best picture, directing and original screenplay — the applause was unmistakably the loudest of the afternoon. His wife and fellow nominated producer, Zinzi Coogler, appeared to be among its most enthusiastic contributors.\n\n\tA close runner-up in the applause stakes was Benicio Del Toro, nominated for supporting actor for “One Battle After Another,” whose entrance into the room drew a spontaneous and sustained reaction. Guillermo del Toro, a nominated producer on “Frankenstein,” was also greeted with notable enthusiasm.\n\n\tThe annual reading of nominees’ names, conducted this year by Lou Diamond Phillips, a member of the acting branch Board of Governors, began with Delroy Lindo, nominated for supporting actor for “Sinners,” and concluded with “One Battle After Another” supporting actress nominee Teyana Taylor, who joked with Variety on her way out, “They saved the best for last.”\n\n\tThere was also an audible response for each of the five casting director nominees, a moment Howell Taylor had flagged earlier in her remarks.\n\n\tWho wasn’t in the room\n\n\tNot every nominee could attend.\n\n\tTwo-time Oscar winner Ludwig Göransson, widely considered the frontrunner for original score for “Sinners,” was absent, having returned to London to complete work on Christopher Nolan’s upcoming epic “The Odyssey,” an adaptation of Homer’s ancient Greek poem.\n\n\tNorwegian actor Renate Reinsve, earning her first Oscar nomination for best actress for “Sentimental Value,” was also unable to step away from production, having recently begun filming Alexander Payne’s Danish-language feature “Somewhere Out There.”\n\n\tSean Penn, who landed his sixth acting nomination for his turn in Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” did not attend — not entirely surprising given his past public remarks about wanting to “smelt” his Oscar.\n\t\n\n\tOscar winner Natalie Portman, nominated as a producer on the animated feature “Arco,” was also absent, as was Oscar winner Sam Mendes, likely deep into production on his ambitious four-film Beatles project.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 10: (2nd L-R) Lorraine Nicholson and Wagner Moura attend the 98th Oscar Nominees Luncheon at The Beverly Hilton on February 10, 2026 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBrazilians supporting Brazilians\n\n\tAt Table 23, where Variety was seated alongside nominees including “F1” producer Jeremy Kleiner, “Hamnet” set decorator Alice Felton and “Sirât” director Oliver Laxe, Brazilian cinematographer Adolpho Veloso (“Train Dreams”) became an unofficial cheer captain. He loudly celebrated each Brazilian nominee announced, including best actor contender Wagner Moura for “The Secret Agent” and international feature director Kleber Mendonça Filho.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 10: Jacob Elordi attends the 98th Oscar Nominees Luncheon at The Beverly Hilton on February 10, 2026 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOnly the NBA might have a “taller” room of players.\n\n\tOne lighter observation circulated quietly: This may be one of the tallest groups of Oscar nominees in recent memory.\n\n\tBetween Jacob Elordi (6-foot-5), nominated for supporting actor for “Frankenstein”; producer Scott Stuber (6-foot-4); Stellan Skarsgård (6-foot-3); and Laxe (6-foot-6), some group photos required creative staging. One reliable solution was to include Guillermo del Toro, whose humor consistently loosened the room and ensured genuine smiles during the Class of 2026 photo.\n\n\tHollywood power players were on deck\n\n\tJosh D’Amaro, the newly minted CEO of the Walt Disney Co., attended alongside Dana Walden. When D’Amaro entered the ballroom, Walden trailed a few steps behind. He paused to wait for her before they walked in together, accompanied by Alan Bergman, co-chairman of Disney Entertainment.\n\n\tThe gathering also carried added resonance as ABC enters its final three years as the Academy Awards’ broadcast partner, lending the afternoon an understated sense of transition.\n\n\tSome advice for Hollywood’s biggest night\n\t\n\n\tBefore the luncheon concluded, Howell Taylor offered practical guidance for nominees preparing for Oscar night — advice met with knowing laughter and attentive nods.\n\n\nBe prepared. Don’t say you didn’t expect it. You have a one in five chance of winning for best picture.\nGet yourself to the stage quickly. You have 45 seconds to complete your speech. A countdown will help you keep to time. The producers signed a contract with ABC, and they will play you off. You can still say an awful lot in 45 seconds. Also, extending your speech is unfair to your fellow nominees when there is a limited amount of time on air.\nMake it heartfelt. Make it authentic. The instinct is to list all the people who have contributed to your success leading up to this moment and thank them publicly. But the truth is, you’ll forget someone, you’ll feel terrible, and they’ll feel terrible. Or someone you never even intended to thank will wonder why you didn’t thank them. Instead, think about what it means to you and try to communicate that.\nHave a single voice. If you are a group, decide ahead of time who will speak.\nNo cell phones. Use paper. It looks better on TV.\nDon’t lean into the microphone. It will pick you up no matter where you stand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 10: (L-R) Julia Aks and Kate Hudson attend the 98th Oscar Nominees Luncheon at The Beverly Hilton on February 10, 2026 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHeartwarming moments and reunions\n\n\tKate Hudson, a best actress nominee for “Song Sung Blue,” was among the first spotted in the lobby, returning to the Oscars after 25 years since her breakthrough nomination for “Almost Famous.”\n\n\tWhen Jessie Buckley entered the room, she lit it up with her smile, celebrating her first best actress nomination for “Hamnet.” She was previously nominated in supporting actress for “The Lost Daughter.” Buckley shared a tender moment with fellow best actress nominee Rose Byrne (“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”), the two embracing and exchanging compliments on each other’s work. Both are widely considered leading contenders in the category.\n\n\t“Hamnet” writer and director Chloé Zhao moved easily through the room, happy and animated. Elle Fanning was also on hand, savoring her first Oscar nomination for “Sentimental Value.”\n\n\tEJAE, the singer-songwriter behind “Golden” from the Netflix hit “K-Pop Demon Hunters,” was a lively presence, chatting with numerous nominees, including Emma Stone. The two paused for a photo together.\n\t\n\n\tJosh Safdie, director, editor, producer and co-writer of “Marty Supreme,” attended as the only individual nominated for four Academy Awards this year.\n\n\tThere were many warm interactions, including Ethan Hawke circulating with fellow nominees alongside Michael Barker, co-head of Sony Pictures Classics. At one point, Hawke, Timothée Chalamet and Barker shared hugs, with both actors telling Barker he was the reason they had careers, a moment that visibly moved him.\n\n\tOutside the ballroom, Anderson — triple-nominated for producing, directing and screenplay for “One Battle After Another” — was seen chatting with Steven Spielberg, a nominated producer on “Hamnet.” The two were catching up amiably in the lobby.\n\n\tAmy Madigan, nominated for “Weapons,” drew attention as she entered the room. It was her first nomination since the 1980s, and the energy around her felt markedly different this time. Dressed in a striking blue suit, she was greeted warmly by Netflix film chief Dan Lin.\n\n\tPast Oscar nominees were also in attendance as guests, including “Mudbound” (2017) screenwriter Virgil Williams, who was seen exchanging numbers with Diane Warren after she encouraged him to call her when he directs his next project. Williams was later spotted chatting with Teyana Taylor, a supporting actress nominee for “One Battle After Another.”\n\n\tLeonardo DiCaprio attended with his father. He spoke with Scott Stuber and caught up with Hawke. Nearby, Chalamet and Emma Stone lingered in an extended conversation at their assigned Table No. 3 near the front of the room.\n\n\tElordi, who is starring opposite Margot Robbie in “Wuthering Heights,” the upcoming Emerald Fennell adaptation that opens Friday, was seen hugging Warner Bros. Pictures co-chief Pam Abdy. A nice reminder that even on a day meant for reflection, the next season is already waiting.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRichard Harbaugh / The Academy\n\t\n\n\n",

Now, with federal agents on the ground and a search underway near the border, the case appears to be intensifying.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          As we told you, the abductor was promising to return Nancy to Tucson within 12 hours of receiving the $6 million ransom ... which means they're currently somewhere within a roughly 700-mile radius of Tucson.\n      \n    \n          There were 2 ransom deadlines, both of which have passed ... even though Savannah tried reaching out to the kidnapper and even offered to pay up.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Tuesday afternoon we noticed activity for the first time in the Bitcoin account listed in the first ransom note that was sent.\n      \n    \n          This morning, the FBI released the first images of Nancy's apparent kidnapper ... and the feds blasted the footage out to the public on the same day they received the info.\n      \n    \n          Nancy has a pacemaker and needs daily medication. The feds have been offering a $50,000 reward \"for information leading to the recovery of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance\" ... anyone with information is asked to contact 1-800-CALL-FBI or visit tips.fbi.gov.\n      \n      ",

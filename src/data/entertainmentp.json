    "body": "\n\tOn the latest episode of Variety‘s Strictly Business podcast, Theron Thomas discusses the ins and outs of being one of the music industry’s most consistently successful songwriters, reminiscing on his early days making music in his native St. Thomas and tracing his trajectory to the present day.\n\n\t“Still being relevant as a creative and getting the calls and having polished and seasoned artists call… You’re like, what?” says Thomas. “I’m still the kid from St. Thomas in my mind. It means the world to me, because I’ve wanted to do this since I was nine years old. Not everybody gets to live their nine-year-old dreams as an adult.”\n\t\n\n\tThroughout his career, Thomas has popped up in the liner notes for smash hits including Miley Cyrus’ “We Can’t Stop,” Rihanna’s “Pour It Up” and Pussycat Dolls’ “When I Grow Up.” His latest chart-topper came with Rosé and Bruno Mars’ “Apt.,” a ubiquitous tune that recently picked up Grammy nominations for song and record of the year. Thomas is no stranger to the Grammys himself: in 2024, he took home the coveted songwriter of the year (non-classical) trophy, just a year after the Recording Academy introduced the category.\n\n\n\tRELATED STORY: Variety’s Hitmakers Top 25 Songs of 2025: ‘Ordinary,’ ‘Luther,’ ‘Golden’ and More\n\n\tThomas looks back on how he got his start in the music industry as one-half of R. City, a duo he formed with his brother Timothy, and how a chance opportunity to sell a song to Akon kick-started their songwriting career on the side. He discusses the difficulty of being an artist in the spotlight while penning tracks for the likes of Beyoncé and Ariana Grande, and why he inevitably prioritized his hustle as a scribe.\n\t\n\n\tDuring the discussion, Thomas also takes a widescreen look at the music industry and how songwriting sessions come together. He addresses how he approaches the craft of songwriting while balancing the machinations of the music business, ensuring that the reward is worth the effort, and shares his thoughts on how the industry can better compensate songwriters for the crucial role they serve.\n\n\t“Strictly Business” is Variety’s weekly podcast featuring conversations with industry leaders about the business of media and entertainment.

    "body": "\n\tNetflix‘s proposed $83 billion deal for Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio and streaming business has elicited opposition from one of the most prominent Democrats on Capitol Hill, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\n\t“This deal looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare,” the senator said in a statement Friday. “A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk.”\n\t\n\n\tWarren called on President Trump’s Justice Department to “enforce” antitrust laws. \n\n\n\t“Under Donald Trump, the antitrust review process has also become a cesspool of political favoritism and corruption,” she said. “The Justice Department must enforce our nation’s anti-monopoly laws fairly and transparently — not use the Warner Bros. deal review to invite influence-peddling and bribery.”\n\n\tNetflix also has encountered pushback from Republicans who have raised antitrust concerns about its takeover of WB studios and HBO Max. In a Nov. 13 letter to Trump administration officials, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., wrote, “With more than 300 million global subscribers and a vast content library, Netflix currently wields unequaled market power.”\n\n\tNetflix, which stopped reporting subscriber figures this year, has more than 300 million streaming subscribers worldwide. WBD ended the third quarter of 2025 with 128.0 million streaming subscribers, an increase of 2.3 million subscribers from Q2. Those include customers of HBO Max as well as Discovery+ and its sports-streaming services.\n\t\n\n\tAt least initially, Netflix said it would operate HBO Max (and Warner Bros.’ studio operations) independently.\n\n\tNetflix can argue that it is nowhere near a monopolist: The streamer’s execs routinely point out on the streaming giant’s earnings calls that even in its most mature markets, including the U.S., Netflix represents less than 10% of total TV viewing (a stat meant to show it still has future growth opportunities).\n",

    "body": "\n\tA long-awaited docuseries about the life of late hip-hop star Nipsey Hussle may finally be released next year. The filmmakers behind the series say the interviews, music and footage are all in place — now they’re on the hunt for a network or streaming home. Director One9, who was behind the recent three part Prime Video doc “Allen Iv3rson,” says the tentatively titled “Hussle” will have between five and seven episodes, and will be narrated posthumously by Hussle along with his brother, Blacc Sam.\n\t\n\n\tThe Grammy-winning Hussle (real name Ermias Asghedom), who became a respected figure for both his music career and his community outreach (which included investing in Crenshaw’s commercial district), was killed outside his clothing shop in 2019. He was just 33, and his death continues to reverberate in South-Central L.A. and the wider Southern California region — where tribute murals depicting the performer are commonplace.\n\n\n\t“We’ve been working on it for several years, and making sure that it’s told the right way,” One9 says. “You talk about one of the most inspirational figures out there, who was a highly gifted child building his own computers to burn CDs and get his music out there.”\n\n\tFueling the multipart doc, One9 says, is a trove of footage he’s sifting through as he assembles the episodes. “Nipsey had the foresight to videotape everything in his life,” the director says. “Even when he was young, his father videotaped everything. You see the whole transformation of a young man coming of age, going through the iterations of childhood to gang life to independence to music to finding his own voice — and then becoming such a huge inspirational figure to the Crenshaw culture and environment.”\n\t\n\n\tThe footage includes the first time Hussle went into the studio at age 12. He also recorded an unreleased audio book, parts of which will supplement the voice-over narration. And the series will feature never before-heard music from the vault.\n\n\tBlacc Sam — aka Samiel Asghedom — has been instrumental in gaining the participation of Hussle’s family, One9 says: “Sam’s learning more about Nipsey’s life from just watching the archival [footage]. … It’s really the story of those two brothers and how they navigated their lives.”\n\n\tOther people in Hussle’s orbit also contributed archival material. “It’s from every single one of his friends, people that were videotaping him during his life in the Rollin 60s [Neighborhood Crips],” One9 says. “We’ve got amazing interviews from Jay-Z to Kendrick Lamar to anybody that knew him at different iterations of his life. It’s a very intricate story to tell, and we’re just making sure we do it in the right way.”\n\n\tAlong with One9, “Hussle” comes from the artist’s Marathon Films shingle and LeBron James and Maverick Carter’s Springhill. One9 recently extended his overall deal at Ian Orefice’s EverWonder Studio, where he has several projects lined up in addition to “Hussle.” \n\n\tOne9 kicked off his career with the 2014 doc “Nas: Time Is Illmatic,” which chronicled the making of Nas’ 1994 debut album, “Illmatic.” After that, he worked as a co-executive producer and director on John Singleton’s Emmy-nominated A&E doc “L.A. Burning: The Riots 25 Years Later” and was an exec producer on “Rather,” Frank Marshall’s 2023 doc about journalist Dan Rather.\n\n\tOne9 says he landed the “Allen Iv3rson” gig by promising the NBA star that he wanted the docuseries’ approach to be “very raw, relentless, from the heart, from the gut, no punches pulled. And that’s what he did. He came with stories about things in his life were very hard for him to deal with, whether it’s alcoholism, money, dealing with the media, people getting killed in and out of his life, and at the same time being number one player coming out of Georgetown, into Philly, and really helping change the culture of the game.” \n\n\tAmong other docs in the works from the director is a project that centers on photographer Markus Klinko, an award-winning classically trained harpist who changed careers after a hand injury. As a fashion and celebrity photographer, he has shot Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez and others. Here’s the logline for “The Art of Reinvention”: “A three-part documentary exploring how artists evolve to survive as the creative world is reshaped by technology and AI, told through the lens of photographer Markus Klinko’s own transformation. The series shows that reinvention isn’t optional, it’s the new form of artistic survival.”\n\t\n\n\tSays One9: “What I’ve learned is how to really create stories of identity. Looking at how people change, how they endure, but ultimately how they disrupt. I really love stories that tell the disruption of the way  hings were before, how they were after and putting all those pieces together.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe fifth edition of the Red Sea Film Festival opened its doors on Thursday night in Jeddah, with the regional premiere of “Giant,” telling the story of ’90s British boxing icon Prince Naseem Hamed, raising the curtain.\n\n\tFor director Rowan Athale, the experience was enthralling but also wholly bizarre, largely because of the sheer amount of star-wattage in the room.\n\n\t“I’ll be honest with you, I’ve been to a lot of festivals, but last night.. I’ve just never seen anything like it, it’s was like the Oscars,” he said, speaking at the Variety Lounge presented by Red Sea Film Festival on Friday. “The hardest thing was when I looked at the speakers, and it’s Juliette Binoche, it’s Jessica Alba, it’s Michael Caine, it’s Vin Diesel, it’s Sean Baker… and it’s me.”\n\t\n\n\tThe evening was no less peculiar for Amir El-Masry, who plays Hamed, who said that it was “truly surreal to be surrounded by people whose bodies of work I really, really admire and respect.” \n\n\n\tHe added: “You know, across the world, there are very few moments where you can put the likes for Aishwarya Rai and Kirsten Dunst together, where here it does it effortlessly.”\n\n\tOne of the other star guests in the room on opening night was Naseem Hamed himself, someone who both El-Masry and Athale admitted to being huge fans of when he was still a professional boxer. While “Giant” first premiered at the BFI London Film Festival in October, it was in Jeddah where the former sporting legend first attended a public screening, bringing his whole family with him to the Red Sea Film Festival.\n\n\t“I’m extremely proud of the film, but having him there was so validating. To see him go: that was fantastic, that was great, and you made me look good,” said El-Masry. “And he brought his WBC belt and put it over me at the end, and he was like, now you know what a real champion boxer feels like.”\n",

Newcomer Reggie Absolom plays the titular character.\n\n\tThe film, first reported on by Variety, follows a washed-up underground party promoter whose life takes an unexpected turn when he’s forced to look after a son that he never knew he had.\n\t\n\n\tThe Tropics Studios project, which recently wrapped production, marks “Anora” producer Alex Coco’s first major effort since the Sean Baker and Mikey Madison dramedy picked up multiple Oscars at the Academy Awards in March. “Club Kid” was shot on 35mm with Emmy-winning cinematographer Adam Newport Berra (“The Studio”).\n\n\tMiss Benny’s credits also include the GLAAD-nominated “Fuller House” (2019), “Love, Victor” (2021) and “American Horror Story” (2021). She will next be seen in Ray Panthaki’s feature directorial debut “In Starland.” \n\n\tShe is represented by CAA, Select Management Group, and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren, Richman, Rush, Kaller, Gellman, Meigs & Fox.\n\n\tCoco will produce “Club Kid” with Galen Core (“Pet Shop Days,” “Lurker”). Firstman, Olmo Schnabel and Daniela Taplin serve as executive producers. Topic is producing and financed the project, with Stay Gold as co-financier. UTA Independent Film Group is handling worldwide sales.\n\t\n\n\tFirstman most recently starred in HBO’s “I Love L.A.” with Rachel Sennott, Odessa A’zion, True Whitaker and Josh Hutcherson. It was renewed for a second season last month.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s time to return to Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza because “Five Nights at Freddy’s” is back at the box office.\n\n\tUniversal and Blumhouse’s PG-13 horror sequel “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” has made $7.2 million in Thursday previews at the box office. It’s projected to make between $35 million and $40 million in its opening this weekend.\n\n\tIn comparison, the original 2023 movie, based on the popular horror video game series of the same name, had $10.3 million in previews on its way to a scary good $80 million launch. That far exceeded expectations for the film, especially considering it simultaneously launched on the Peacock streaming service. That being said, expectations for “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” are lower considering the original’s shocking success — it went down as Blumhouse’s highest grossing movie of all time with nearly $300 million globally. The sequel still has a tidy budget of $36 million, compared to the first movie’s $20 million cost, so it should be able to stick around in theaters during the holidays and turn a profit.\n\t\n\n\tJosh Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail and Piper Rubio are back for more animatronic scares at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, where the robotic mascots turn into creepy killers at night. Director Emma Tammi and writer and video game series creator Scott Cawthon both returned for the sequel, which features newcomers McKenna Grace, Teo Briones, Freddy Carter and more.\n\n\n\tHowever, last week’s Thanksgiving winner “Zootopia 2” will triumph once again at the box office, where it’s expected to bring in $44 million to $50 million, a 50-55% decline from its $98 million debut. Universal’s “Wicked: For Good” is on track for $21 million to $25 million to land in third place in its third weekend.\n\t\n\n\tFellow box office newcomers include“Jujutsu Kaisen: Execution,” which is projected to earn $8 million to $10 million; Quentin Tarantino’s super-sized “Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair,” expected to make $5 million to $10 million; plus a filmed version of Broadway’s “Merrily We Roll Along” and the British comedy “Fackham Hall,” both expected to make around $3 million.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKriti Sanon may be one of Bollywood’s busiest stars today, but at the Red Sea Film Festival in Saudi Arabia on Friday, she won over a packed audience by revisiting a moment from early in her career when she found herself on set with superstar Shah Rukh Khan and felt, in her words, “like a complete newbie who didn’t know what was going on.”\n\n\tThe anecdote surfaced during the festival’s hour-long “In Conversation” session when an audience member mentioned that he had also worked with Khan, prompting Sanon to reflect on her own early experience on the set of Rohit Shetty’s “Dilwale.” She described the superstar as “kind and chivalrous,” quipping, “Chivalry isn’t dead.” She continued, “When he speaks to you, he gives you his undivided attention. He’s intelligent, he’s witty, and he treats everyone on set with respect.” The recollection drew an enthusiastic response from the crowd, which remained highly engaged throughout the session with sporadic bursts of applause.\n\t\n\n\tSanon spoke candidly about her unlikely path into the industry, describing her journey from studious engineering student who hadn’t yet identified her passion, to model, which she says began as a hobby before leading her to television commercials, and, eventually, film offers. “Sometimes life happens,” she told the audience. “You just have to be aware enough to recognize the opportunity that’s meant for you.”\n\n\n\tMuch of the conversation centered on “Mimi,” the 2021 comedy drama, where she plays a woman who decides to be a surrogate for a foreign couple. The role, which earned her India’s National Film Award for best actress, shifted her understanding of her own capabilities, she said. “ ‘Mimi’ gave me a bigger canvas,” she reflected. “It opened something in me as an actor. After that film, I didn’t feel the need to prove anything, and that allowed me to take more risks in the work I chose.”\n\t\n\n\tThat willingness to take risks has continued to shape her choices, including her recent appearance in “Tere Ishq Mein,” which she said she’s thrilled to see embraced internationally. When she asked the crowd how many had seen the film, most of the hands in the room shot up, prompting a surprised laugh from the actor. “Love stories are back,” she declared, pointing to what she sees as an overrepresentation of action films in recent years. She credited director Aanand L. Rai for embracing flawed, complicated characters, and said she appreciates that today’s female characters are allowed to have more dimension. “Women aren’t just damsels in distress anymore,” she said. “Women are also flawed. And they are also being loved as flawed characters. Because they’re just as real and as human as men.”\n\n\tThe audience’s enthusiasm never dissipated, if anything, it grew. Once the floor opened for questions, hands shot up across the auditorium. Several fans tried to ask multiple questions, others demanded selfies, while one attendee, towards the end of the session, insisted on singing a few lines. Sanon took it all in stride, calling herself “overwhelmed with all the love” and admitting she was “still absorbing it” during her first visit to the region’s largest festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter more than two years in the works, Markiplier‘s feature-film directorial debut — horror sci-fi movie “Iron Lung” — is set to open in theaters in late January 2026.\n\n\tMarkiplier, the popular YouTube creator whose real name is Mark Fischbach, produced, wrote, directed, edited, financed and stars in “Iron Lung.” The film is based on the 2022 indie horror game of the same name by David Szymanski. \n\n\n\tMarkiplier also is self-distributing the film, working directly with independent theaters across the country. For the opening weekend (Jan. 30-Feb. 1), he’s aiming for “Iron Lung” to be in 50-100 independent theaters. Tickets will start to go on sale Friday, coinciding with the film’s L.A. premiere at Alamo Drafthouse Cinema Downtown.\n\t\n\n\tAt this point, Markiplier has not finalized plans for when or where “Iron Lung” will become available on streaming. Getting the film through post-production and into a theatrical window has taken him nearly three years since he announced in an April 2023 video that shooting for “Iron Lung” was completed. In addition to Markiplier, the film co-stars Caroline Rose Kaplan, Troy Baker and Elsie Lovelock.\n\n\tIn a statement provided to Variety, Markiplier said, “They said it shouldn’t be done. Not that it couldn’t be done, people have made movies before, just that it would be ‘woefully unwise’ to tackle writing, directing, acting and editing a movie myself. Showed them. My bathroom might be a render farm now but I can’t wait for people to see the blood, sweat, blood, tears, blood and blood that went into this movie from everyone involved.” He added that “Iron Lung” holds a world record “for most blood in a horror movie. Or any movie for that matter.”\n\t\n\n\tHere is Markiplier’s description of “Iron Lung”: The stars are gone. The planets have disappeared. Only individuals aboard space stations or starships were left to give the end a name — The Quiet Rapture. After decades of decay and crumbling infrastructure, the Consolidation of Iron has made a discovery on a barren moon designated AT-5. An ocean of blood. Hoping to discover desperately needed resources they immediately launch an expedition. A submarine is crafted and a convict is welded inside. Due to the pressure and depth of the ocean the forward viewport has been encased in metal. If successful, they will earn their freedom. If not, another will follow. This will be the 13th expedition.\n\n\tMarkiplier has over 73 million followers across digital platforms, including more than 37 million subscribers on YouTube. His videos on YouTube span “quality content to meme-able garbage” and from “scary games to full-on interactive movies,” he says in his channel description.\n\n\tHe currently co-hosts popular podcasts “Distractible” and “Go! My Favorite Sports Team,” both of which were acquired by Spotify in 2023. Last year, he starred in New Regency’s “The Edge of Sleep” limited series on Amazon Prime Video. He can also be seen in the Emmy-nominated YouTube original series “In Space with Markiplier,” the follow-up to his series “A Heist with Markiplier,” for which he served as creator, writer, director and star.\n\n\tBeyond digital platforms, Markiplier co-founded Cloak, a clothing company fostering inclusivity that recently partnered with the Trevor Project, donating part of the proceeds from their limited-edition collection Binary. He also has has hosted numerous live charity drives, raising millions of dollars in donations for organizations including Best Friends Animal Society, Charity Water, Direct Relief and the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\n\tFischbach is represented by Ben Curtis, WME, and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren, Richman, Rush, Kaller, Gellman, Meigs & Fox.\n\n\tThis is the trailer for “Iron Lung,” which Markiplier released in October 2023:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBirmingham’s most notorious crime gang is back in March.\n\n\tNetflix has unveiled teaser art for “The Immortal Man,” the upcoming “Peaky Blinders” film which will serve as a continuation of the hit crime drama series. The film will be released in select theaters on March 6, 2026, and on Netflix on March 20.\n\n\tAlthough the film’s plot remains under wraps, the movie is teased as an “epic continuation of the multi-award-winning gangster saga, set in the lawless streets of Birmingham in the 1900s.”\n\t\n\n\tThe sequel will see Cillian Murphy return to his starring role as Tommy Shelby in the “Peaky Blinders” universe. Sophie Rundle is set to reprise her role as Tommy’s sister Ada Thorne with Stephen Graham and Ned Dennehy coming back as Shelby family allies Hayden Stagg and Charlie Strong, respectively. Packy Lee is back as Johnny Dogs, a loyal associate of the crime family, and Ian Peck will return as Curly, a horse expert and stable hand for the Shelby clan.\n\n\n\tThe cast also includes newcomers Rebecca Ferguson, Barry Keoghan, Tim Roth and Jay Lycurgo.\n\n\tTom Harper, who served as a director for several episodes of the series, will direct the film. The series premiered on the BBC in 2013, with Netflix later acquiring the U.S. rights. “Peaky Blinders” concluded in 2022 after six seasons. The show was created by British screenwriter Steven Knight.\n\n\t“By order of the Peaky Blinders… Tommy Shelby is back. Cillian Murphy and Steven Knight are reunited on set as production officially starts on the upcoming Netflix film,” the streamer shared on X in September, along with a photo of Murphy and Knight’s reunion.\n\t\n\n\t“It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn’t finished with me…It is very gratifying to be recollaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of ‘Peaky Blinders.’ This is one for the fans,” Murphy said in an earlier statement. \n\n\tSee the teaser art below: \n\nAcademy Award winner Cillian Murphy returns as the legendary gypsy gangster Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man.

    "body": "\n\tEmma Corrin and Maika Monroe didn’t have to try to establish the chemistry needed for their roles in Julia Jackman’s indie fantasy “100 Nights of Hero.”\n\n\t“It was really easy,” Corrin tells Variety, seated next to Monroe at the Soho Hotel in London. Echoes Monroe with a smile: “It was there immediately.”\n\n\tIn the film loosely based on the Middle Eastern folk tale “One Thousand and One Nights,” Monroe and Corrin play the sheltered Cherry and her loyal maid Hero, respectively. Set in a dystopian world where storytelling is banned and women are killed for failing to produce an heir, Cherry’s neglectful husband places a wager on her fidelity, leaving her with his seductive friend Manfred (Nicholas Galitzine) for 100 nights. As Manfred tries his best to win Cherry’s heart, she is increasingly pulled to Hero and her never-ending stories that make nights pass by in a flash.\n\t\n\n\t“In their own ways, they both want more than what they have and what the world offers to them because of the way it operates,” Corrin explains of Cherry and Hero’s relationship. “They both want to escape and want to be free, so I think that draws them together. Also, simply put, I think they just love each other. It’s not more complicated than that.”\n\n\n\tWhile filming the movie for six weeks on a large estate in the East of England, Corrin and Monroe bonded by listening to music in between takes. “We always had a speaker on,” Corrin remembers. “[We played] a lot of Charli xcx and did a lot of dances we’d seen on TikTok.”\n\n\tCharli just so happens to have a small role in the film as one of the characters in Hero’s tales, though Corrin and Monroe never share the screen with her. “There was so much of the story we didn’t see, like I had no idea what Charli was doing,” Monroe admits. “I was like, ‘I wonder what she did!'”\n\t\n\n\tAs “100 Nights of Hero” releases in theaters on Friday, Corrin and Monroe tell Variety more about approaching their characters, the importance of indie film, filming in a haunted estate and making Galitzine learn the “Apple” dance.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMaika Monroe and Emma Corrin in “100 Nights of Hero.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©IFC Films/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow did you both get involved in “100 Nights of Hero”?\t\n\n\tEmma Corrin: I got sent the script. I read it and said, “Wow, this is original. I haven’t read anything like this in a while.” It reminded me of like “The Princess Bride” or “A Knight’s Tale,” sort of a medieval fantasy, which I love as a genre.  Maika Monroe: I feel like we read so much and this stood out — like, so refreshing. And then I met Julia and we just hit it off. Corrin: Yeah, she’s epic. Monroe: We talked about the movie but we also just talked about life. I was just like, “I’m obsessed with you,” and had complete faith in her. She has an amazing vision.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you each approach your characters and did you relate to them at all?\t\n\n\tMonroe: I really connected with Cherry in the sense that she was experiencing this first love and figuring out who you are, coming of age. I think anyone can relate to that. I thought it was such a beautiful, at its core very simple story, but yet in this heightened, fantastical world that is just very magical. I think her arc is so beautiful. You meet her and there’s this sort of innocence and ignorance to a lot of the world, and then you see her mind open up and really find her voice.  Corrin: I really liked Hero’s dry sense of humor. I’m really attracted to that and hadn’t really played anyone like that and hadn’t done a lot of comedy. Generally, the whole script I think is so funny, and I’m kind of really into that. I think that’s what people want to see at the moment, stuff that’s going to make them laugh but also move them. I also really loved the whole mythology of Hero’s past and this sort of destiny that she has to spread these stories. It’s also a secret that she has that could end her life, so the stakes are so high for her — but she completely holds onto what she believes and values and actually ultimately chooses love amidst all of that, which is the most dangerous thing she could do. \n\t\n\t\tWhat was it like working with Jackman as a director? How would you describe the environment on set? \t\n\n\tCorrin: It’s a proper independent film, you know, it was very boots on the ground. It takes a village every day making it happen, which felt really cool. I hadn’t done anything like that. Monroe: Yeah, what I love about indies and a movie that’s this small is everyone’s there because they believe in the project. There’s no other game besides you just believe in it, so I feel like there’s a very specific energy that is created with that.\n\t\n\t\tHow would you describe this connection between Cherry and Hero? What makes it so special?\t\n\n\tCorrin: It was a lot of fun for us to play with. I think they have this really thick conspiracy between them and love for each other and also the way their humor plays off each other is really cool. When Nick [Galitzine] was there as well, it was really fun because those are the moments where they’re even more in cahoots. It’s kind of like they have this telepathic thing going on. I noticed watching this morning that so much is done with looks. I’ve never done anything with that style before and I really enjoyed that — between them, it’s very much what’s unsaid.  \n\t\n\t\tWhat was it like working with Nicholas Galitzine as this sort of dumb, hunky guy?\t\n\n\tCorrin: Which he totally leans into, and he has the most fun with it. Monroe: I’m obsessed. He’s like, the sweetest boy. Corrin: Goofiest boy. Monroe: He was so passionate about this project.Corrin: He really got it — he got exactly what he needed, what Manfred needed. He just went 100% in.\n\n\tMonroe: He was literally in the midst of training [to play He-Man in “Masters of the Universe”] and had to eat all this food. We were just like, “Wow.”  \n\t\n\t\tIt’s getting harder and harder to make indie films – why was it important for you to be a part of this one and preserve this space?\t\n\n\tMonroe: It’s so important. Even just original stories, it’s much more rare these days. I did this movie “Longlegs,” which was an original script and story — it did so well and I was like, “See?” Corrin: Because they hunger for it. People want original things. Monroe: Exactly. It really is such a different energy. There’s nothing wrong with… like, there’s also amazing parts of a big studio film, but I don’t know. Corrin: There’s a real sense of community on these things. Like Maika, what you were saying, you know that every single person is there because they believe and love the story. And there would be a million reasons not to do it, but that’s the reason you should do it. It feels, more than anything, an incredible thing to be a part of every day because you really know that you are integral to making it happen. And then when it gets traction and it’s recognized and we’re talking about it, it feels so incredible because this thing could so easily not have been made. \n\t\n\t\tTo close this out, do you have any silly memories from filming you can share? \t\n\n\tMonroe: We made Nick do the “Apple” dance, which was really fun. Corrin: We also wrote our own version of [Charli xcx’s] “Everything Is Romantic.” We were delirious in a room one day and were writing our own version of it. Monroe: With everything that we were going through on set! Corrin: Oh, and the fact that that room was haunted. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat?!\t\n\n\tCorrin: We were in this one room one day and we could hear this noise and everyone was like, “Who is making that noise? We can’t shoot!” It was this kind of metal scraping sound, and we kept having to stop shooting because every time they’d call action it would start again. Everyone was like, “We’re not touching anything!” And then we read online that that room was haunted by this ghost called Spinning Jenny. She was shut in there and she used to spin yarn. Like, proper terrifying.   \n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

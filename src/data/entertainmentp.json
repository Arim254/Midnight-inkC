    "body": "\n\tAly Raisman is a champion. And a survivor. And she knows it takes a village to help heal.\n\n\tThe Olympic gold medalist gymnast was used to performing at the absolute highest level, both physical and mental. She retired from the sport with six Olympic and five World Championship medals in 2020, but then she faced challenges beyond the mat. She was among the brave women who testified before the Senate about failures in the case against USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar, who was convicted of sexual abuse of athletes. She opened up about her mental health challenges and abuse at the hands of Nassar, and became an activist and advocate for mental health. She wrote a children’s book in 2024 called “From My Head to My Toes,” which aims to teach children about bodily consent.\n\t\n\n\tClearly, her drive to be a champion hasn’t dimmed. She will be honored by the Purina Purple Leash Project for her advocacy efforts at Variety’s Power of Women event Oct. 29.\n\n\n\tThe Purina Purple Leash Project helps create pet-friendly shelters for survivors of domestic abuse, making sure that they can keep their beloved pets with them and receive care in pet-friendly environments.\n\n\tRaisman knows how much a furry friend can help abuse survivors as well as people struggling with mental health challenges.\n\n\t“It’s hard to put into words how much my dog Milo means to me and how much love he’s brought into my life,” she says about her canine companion, who is almost always at her side. She praises the unconditional love she gets from Milo, and how he’s changed her perspective on the world. “No matter how many times I throw a ball to him, he could do it all day, every day, and it’s every time he sees it, it’s like the first time he’s seeing it, or the first time he’s experiencing it. And that has really helped me in my own personal healing journey of remembering to find moments of magic. \n\t\n\n\t“One of my favorite quotes is ‘Those who don’t believe in magic will never find it.’”\n\n\tShe’s been a fan of the Purple Leash Project for a while. “I really appreciate and admire the work and their mission. I didn’t realize before Purple Leash had told me that less than 20% of domestic abuse violence shelters in the U.S. accept pets, and Purina is working hard to change that,” she notes.\n\n\tRaisman says what’s also so devastating is that 48% of survivors actually delay leaving abusive situations because they can’t bring their pets with them. “And over 70% of women in domestic violence shelters report their abuser threatened, injured or killed a pet as a means of control,” she adds. “I can’t stress enough how important the work that Purple Leash and Purina are doing, because it’s truly saving lives. It’s also saving the pets’ lives.”\n\n\tRaisman makes the point that many people suffer in silence, but there is help and hope out there for them.\n\n\t“The journey to healing is definitely not ‘one size fits all,’ and unfortunately, it can be really difficult to find a support system. And what I’ve learned from speaking at colleges across the country and meeting people, whether it’s at the grocery store or the airport, is there are a lot more people than we realize, that have been abused.”\n\n\tRaisman also realizes that finding support — whether confiding in a friend or finding a therapist — can be daunting and hamper trying to get help.\n\n\t“If there’s a survivor reading this, I want them to know that there is hope out there, there is help,” she says. “I think what has really helped me is remembering that I’m not going to feel like this forever. So on the days where I’m struggling the most, I remind myself that this is the bad day. It’s going to pass, and I’m not going to feel like this forever. But there is help out there, and there are really wonderful people out there who do really care.”\n\n\tRaisman truly nailed the landing.\n",

    "description": "\n\tKate Hudson doesn’t often cry when she screens her own movies — she’s too busy critiquing her work — but watching her latest film, “Song Sung Blue,”",
    "body": "\n\tKate Hudson doesn’t often cry when she screens her own movies — she’s too busy critiquing her work — but watching her latest film, “Song Sung Blue,” was an exception. She was sitting in a darkened room with her mom, Goldie Hawn, and her “pa,” Kurt Russell, Hawn’s longtime partner. Instead of nitpicking details of her performance opposite Hugh Jackman, Hudson found herself getting lost in the true story of two Milwaukee tip-jar performers whose love of music helped their blended family navigate life’s trials and tribulations. \n\t\n\n\t“There were a lot of tears,” Hudson recalls of that screening. Russell compared the inspirational tale to the classic underdog movie “Rocky.” Hawn was a mess. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSami Drasin for Variety Magazine\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“There’s no frills in this movie,” Hudson says. “It’s not glamorous. And there are some shots where my mom saw me as a middle-aged woman. That made us all think about what it is to get older and to come into yourself.” \n\n\tWe’re sitting in the hair and makeup trailer on the set of her Netflix comedy series “Running Point,” discussing how music was Hudson’s first love — she grew up wanting to be a singer-songwriter — but movie stardom arrived first.   \n\n\tShe was just 19 when she starred as the head “Band-Aid” Penny Lane in Cameron Crowe’s 2000 drama “Almost Famous,” for which she won a Golden Globe and earned a best supporting actress Oscar nomination. Then came the quintessential rom-com “How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,” which further raised her stock. But knocking it out of the ballpark with two of her earliest roles meant the dream of being a musician fell by the wayside.  \n\t\n\n\t“I was always waiting for the director who wanted me to sing in the movie,” says Hudson, now 46, sitting cross-legged in the salon chair. “And then you realize that waiting for things to happen is a really bad idea.” \n\n\tDuring the COVID lockdown, Hudson began to feel dissatisfied with her creative output. Even though she’d scratched her musical-theater itch with the showstopping number “Cinema Italiano” in “Nine” and had a recurring guest spot on “Glee,” she never pursued anything more substantial. But she’d grown up watching her mother fight to build a career she believed in, and win, so Hudson knew it was time to take action. \n\n\t“Thank God I had a mom who said, ‘Make your own way,’” Hudson says. “When you become successful in the arts — and what I mean by ‘successful’ is when you’re making other people a lot of money — people really like to put you in a box. But nobody becomes an artist to be put in a cage,” Hudson manages to keep one eye on me while her makeup artist draws on lip liner. \n\n\t“As you get older, you realize you’re the only one who makes the decision not to allow yourself to be in that cage,” she goes on. “It means having to make fearless and risk-taking decisions that are really, really hard to do when you have a status quo that’s safe.” \n\n\tSo in 2021, Hudson began writing songs, knowing that music would soothe her soul. And last year she finally released her debut album, “Glorious,” and headed out on tour. While promoting the project, Hudson sat for an interview with “CBS Sunday Morning.” Both Jackman and “Song Sung Blue” writer-director Craig Brewer happened to be watching.  \n\n\t“I’m a big believer in trying to find actors that are experiencing something comparable to what the character is going through,” Brewer says. “To see Kate in this interview talking about how she was getting sick of waiting for Hollywood to make up their mind about her, and that music was her thing to take charge of her life, I was like, ‘Holy shit, that’s what I’m making this movie about.’” \n\n\tThen Hudson teared up as she talked about her eldest son, Ryder, then 18, leaving home for college; Brewer was struck by her vulnerability.  \n\t\n\n\t“I remember thinking, ‘Wow, this is a very unique time in Kate’s life that some actresses try to hide,’” the filmmaker says. Other actresses balk at the very idea of aging, Brewer says, but Hudson clearly embraced the lessons learned in the years that span marriages, divorces and raising children. “In this moment of watching Kate cry, I was like, ‘There’s that woman all of us fell in love with in “Almost Famous.”’”  \n\n\tBrewer and Jackman texted each other almost simultaneously: Hudson would be perfect for their movie. “Song Sung Blue,” out Christmas Day, stars Jackman and Hudson as cover artists Mike and Claire Sardina — she a little country, he a little rock ’n’ roll. The film follows the Sardinas as they form a Neil Diamond tribute band and become local superstars in ’90s Wisconsin. (The duo were so popular that they once performed with Pearl Jam.)  \n\n\t“Kate’s singing is amazing to watch, because she’s not just singing a song; her face is this ever-moving, ever-evolving vessel of the emotion that she’s communicating,” Brewer says. \n\n\tYes, be warned: For all the movie’s feel-good times and “Sweet Caroline” sing-alongs, the Sardinas also weathered a surprising number of intense storms, giving Hudson ample opportunity to show off her range.  \n\n\t“I feel so grateful that Hugh and Craig trusted me to take on all these sides of Claire, because people don’t usually see me as this,” Hudson says. That is, a skilled dramatist. Her hairstylist is running the blow-dryer, so Hudson holds my tape recorder to her mouth and says, “That’s the dream as an actor; I got to use a little bit of everything.”  \n\n\tMultitasking like this is nothing new for Hudson.  \n\n\t“She’ll be decorating her home, on FaceTime with her son in New York, running a business and writing a song in her dressing room while doing a fitting,” says Brenda Song, Hudson’s “Running Point” co-star. “She does it all. And does it all so well.” \n\n\tThe two play best friends on camera, and Hudson has become one of Song’s closest confidants in real life. “When I met Kate, I was at a crossroads in my life, figuring out the balance between motherhood and work, and where I fit in this industry,” Song says.  \n\t\n\n\tThen Hudson shared some wisdom: “For you to be the best mom and the best partner, you have to be the best you.” Song says, “It resonated with me because I realized that Kate hasn’t lost herself in her work or in motherhood. Kate is very, very good at making sure that she takes care of herself so she can take care of everyone else.” \n\n\tHudson is proud of putting her family — her kids, Ryder, now 21, Bingham, 13, and Rani, 7 — first, but she doesn’t downplay the give and take. \n\n\t“There are sacrifices I’ve made along the way to be at home, a lot of opportunities I had to say no to, which came as an easy no,” Hudson says. “But as Rani started to get older, it was time to start making career decisions that I felt like I could make. And I got really lucky that I could make them not based on money.” \n\n\tWith “Song Sung Blue,” Hudson was drawn to Claire’s “fighting spirit,” and she relished that the role was a career risk. “You don’t know if you lean into this character and put those rollers in your hair and put on the Wisconsin accent and sing Neil Diamond music in an ’80s sparkly dress, if it’s gonna work or it’s not. You just have to believe.”  \n\n\tAbout that accent: Hudson blended the real Claire’s unique dialect with a voice she’s known since childhood — that of her Wisconsin-native longtime assistant, Kathy Heller. Heller first worked as Hudson’s nanny from the time the actress was 9 to when she turned 15. “When my life got really crazy and I didn’t know who to trust, I called Kathy and said, ‘Will you help me figure out how to organize my life?’ And she goes, ‘No,’” Hudson recalls, laughing.  \n\n\tHeller ultimately acquiesced and agreed to assist Hudson for one year. “Kathy ended up being on my team for 27 years. She retired last year and moved back to Wisconsin. I can’t wait for her to see the movie.” \n\n\tThe project has also catapulted Hudson back into the Oscar race. Of course, she’s excited about the prospect of having another gold statuette with her name engraved on it, but having grown up in the industry, she knows how the game works. \n\n\t“I felt lucky that I knew the peaks and valleys of this roller-coaster ride,” Hudson says. “One minute you’re the hot ingenue and you’re up here, and then the next minute you’re wondering why you’re not in the conversation for certain things that you know you can do. It’s never been something that has defined my value.”  \n\t\n\n\tShe holds on to advice Russell gave her early on: “‘Love what you do because you love it; don’t love it because you rely on it.’ Because it’s so hard to rely on this business — it’s going to throw you all over the place.” \n\n\tAs Hudson plans her next act, she wants to direct, but she’s primarily focused on songwriting. She’s written loads for a sophomore album, inspired by her family’s experience evacuating their Palisades neighborhood as wildfires swept through Los Angeles in January. Most of all, Hudson is embracing this next phase of her career — one in which she’s taking more chances and feels more fulfilled. \n\n\t“The person I was in my 20s is very different than the person I am in my 40s, and the person I am now in my 40s is very different than the person I’ll be in my 60s,” Hudson says, grinning that gleaming movie-star grin. “I just hope I get to keep making movies and telling stories and writing music and being a part of what I see as the great connector.” \n\n\t\n\t\tCharity Spotlight: World Food Programme\t\n\n\tFor a decade, Kate Hudson has worked with the World Food Programme to support the 300 million people facing severe hunger globally. Hudson was introduced to the organization by her longtime friend, designer Michael Kors, who enlisted her help raising funds for WFP’s school meals program, which provides students with food during the school day and with rations to take home to their families.\n\n\t“Then they said, ‘Do you want to come on this field trip to Cambodia?’” Hudson says.\n\n\tIn Cambodia, she met both the students who benefit and the smallholder farmers, all of them women, who grow the food.\n\n\t“These kids want to be astronauts, lawmakers, police officers, presidents of their countries. They want to do good with their lives,” says World Food Program USA president and CEO Barron Segar. “But if they’re not in school, those dreams are extremely hard to achieve.” (Food has a massive impact on attendance.)Segar says Hudson’s support for the cause — she became a Goodwill Ambassador in 2018 — has been invaluable: “It’s been over a decade, and Kate’s turned her voice, her significant platform and her heart into a megaphone for global hunger.”\n\n\tHudson, though, reserves her praise for the 16,000 people who execute the organization’s global mission. “All those people in the field trying to get food into Gaza risk their lives every day,” she says. “Whether it’s the Sudan or Myanmar, we need foundations like the World Food Programme. When you see these mommies not able to feed their children, it’s just a no for me.”\n\n\t\n\t\tStyling: Sophie Lopez; Styling assistant: Thanda Gibson; Makeup: Debra Ferullo/Tracey Mattingly; Hair: Tanya Abriol; Fashion Credits: Dress: The New Arrivals Ilkyaz Ozel; Pumps: Black Suede Studio; Earrings: Nancy Newberg; Rings: Jacquie Aiche,Selim Mouzannar & EF Collection\t\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Portlandia” co-creator Jonathan Krisel is making his feature debut with “Hey Bear,” a bold revenge comedy that will star Mia Goth (“Frankenstein”), Zach Galifianakis (“The Hangover trilogy”) and Dan Stevens (“I’m Your Man”).\n\n\tPenned by Carrie Kemper, the Emmy-winning writer of “Beef,” “Hey Bear” is being pitched as a “coming of rage” story boasting offbeat comedy, about a woman who seeks revenge on the bear that ate her husband. Alix Madigan (“Winter’s Bone”) will produce.\n\t\n\n\t“Hey Bear” will be introduced to buyers at AFM, with HanWay Films handling international sales and WME Independent & UTA Independent Film Group representing North America.\n\n\n\tGoth stars as Claire, who “has always led a life solely based on other people’s expectations. Married to Gregory (Dan Stevens), she accommodates his desire to spend his life studying bears in Glacier National Park, even though it means months away from him at a time. During one of her visits, a grizzly bear, nicknamed Mr. Cranky by Gregory, mauls him to death. After being told by the park rangers that Mr. Cranky was euthanised, Claire finds out that the bear has merely been transported to another national park and is living his best life. The usually meek Claire makes up her mind to exact revenge on the bear. She teams up with socially awkward park ranger Putt (Galifianakis) to assassinate Mr. Cranky, but Putt has his own murky motivations for joining her. With death and truth lurking around every tree, Claire’s desperate, grief-fueled mission takes her on an ultimately uplifting journey of empowerment and self-discovery. Set in breath-taking natural scenery, this “coming of rage” story is a darkly comedic rollercoaster ride full of originality and surprise,” the synopsis reads. \n\t\n\n\t“There is nothing more thrilling than coming across a project that breaks barriers in terms of originality. As absurd and crazy as the premise of this story is, you always fully connect and empathise with Claire’s journey as she figures out how out of grief, to take ownership of her life again,” said Gabrielle Stewart, CEO of HanWay Films. “Mia Goth, Dan Stevens and Zach Galifianakis are the dream team to make us laugh, feel, and gasp with shock and horror,” Stewart continued. \n\n\tExecutive producers are Carrie Kemper and Danica Radovanov. Krisel is represented by UTA and Mosaic. Kemper is represented by UTA. Goth is represented by WME, Curtis Brown and Jackoway, Austen.  Galifianakis is represented by Brillstein Entertainment Partners and UTA. Stevens is represented by CAA and Julian Belfrage Associates\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 66th edition of the Thessaloniki Intl. Film Festival, which runs Oct. 30 – Nov. 9, offers a window into a world beset by uncertainty and a snapshot of our troubled times, backed by what festival director Orestis Andreadakis describes as a determination to give a voice to independent filmmakers “who champion a cinema that is restless, inventive and unpredictable.”\n\n\t“As always, we strive to balance a fully rounded program, featuring the most remarkable new voices, while remaining true to our long-standing goals of diversity, inclusivity, sustainability, keeping up with the up-to-the-minute trends and honoring the medium’s legacy and roots,” Andreadakis tells Variety.\n\t\n\n\t“In our broader region, some of the greatest crimes of our time are being committed — crimes that endanger not only the peace and security of all people but also degrade the very notion of human dignity,” he continues. “We have selected films from across this area, and we will welcome creators whose works capture what is absolutely critical and urgent in our world today.”\n\n\n\tUnderscoring the event’s commitment to “allowing smothered voices to be heard and promoting a state of openness and tolerance,” Andreadakis adds that the Thessaloniki festival “is, above all, a space of inclusion — a safe environment for dialogue and coexistence — guided by its unwavering belief in the universal, human values of equality, peace and freedom.”\n\n\tThe curtain rises on this year’s edition with “Father Mother Sister Brother,” Jim Jarmusch’s star-studded dramedy, which won the Golden Lion at this year’s Venice Film Festival. Describing the American auteur as “not only a legendary director, but also a good friend of the festival,” Andreadakis praised the film as a “tender mosaic of everyday vignettes, illustrated on the intricate canvas of human relationships.” Actor Indya Moore will be in attendance at the opening ceremony on Oct. 30. The festival closes Nov. 9 with “Hen,” an absurdist drama from Hungarian filmmaker György Pálfi, coming off its premiere in Toronto.\n\t\n\n\tAmong the highlights of this year’s festival will be a tribute to Isabelle Huppert, who will receive an honorary Golden Alexander Award and will give a masterclass on Nov. 4 offering insights from her celebrated career. Fifteen films from the French actress’ oeuvre will be presented in Thessaloniki, including Thierry Klifa’s political drama “The Richest Woman in the World,” which premiered this year in Cannes. \n\n\tAlso making the trip from the Croisette is “Once Upon a Time in Gaza,” a Palestinian crime farce from Arab and Tarzan Nasser, while fellow Palestinian filmmaker Annemarie Jacir will be in Thessaloniki with her latest feature, “Palestine 36,” which wowed audiences in Toronto and is Palestine’s entry for this year’s Oscar race. Meanwhile, Hungarian auteur Ildikó Enyedi will be on hand with her Venice prizewinner “Silent Friend,” as will British genre auteur Ben Wheatley, who arrives with his latest genre mash-up, “Bulk.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIsabelle Huppert will receive an honorary Golden Alexander Award \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA total of 278 feature-length and short films will be screening at this year’s festival. The main competition lineup, which features 12 films from up-and-coming directors, includes “Pillion,” U.K. director Harry Lighton’s kinky queer romance starring Alexander Skarsgård and Harry Melling, as well as “Satisfaction,” feature debutante Alex Burunova’s psychological drama starring “The Brutalist’s” Emma Laird, Fionn Whitehead (“Dunkirk”), Zar Amir (“Holy Spider”) and Adwoa Aboah (“Top Boy”). Also competing for the Golden Alexander is Romanian filmmaker Mihai Mincan, whose sophomore feature, “Milk Teeth,” bowed in the Venice Film Festival’s Horizons section, and Suzannah Mirghani, who’s also making the trip from the Lido with her Critics’ Week premiere “Cotton Queen.” \n\n\tThe host nation will present 32 feature and short films in Thessaloniki, with a quartet competing for top honors, including Evi Kalogiropoulou’s dystopian, female-empowerment drama “Gorgonà” — also a Venice Critics’ Week premiere — and Krysianna Papadakis and Stergios Dinopoulos’ genre-bending queer love story “Bearcave,” a prizewinner at Venice Days. The festival will also be presenting a special screening of “Electra7,” which is being billed as “an imaginative cinematic relay inspired by Sophocles’ ‘Electra.’” The film was directed by seven established Greek auteurs: Sofia Exarchou (“Animal”), Christina Ioakeimidi (“Medium”), Babis Makridis (“Pity”), Argyris Papadimitropoulos (“Suntan”), Elina Psykou (“Stray Bodies”), Alexander Voulgaris (“Winona”) and Neritan Zinxhiria (“Light of Light”).\n\t\n\n\tLong a champion of the homegrown industry, the Thessaloniki Film Festival will be feting legendary Greek filmmaker Yorgos Tsemberopoulos with a tribute and an honorary Golden Alexander Award, celebrating the work of a director who across his career has strived to “comprehend, feel and embrace the human condition,” according to Andreadakis. A special event on Nov. 3 will also pay tribute to the stars of Greek cinema of the 1960s, welcoming 36 iconic actors and actresses to the stage of the historic Olympion Theater.\n\n\tThe program highlights the festival’s commitment to “Greek cinema that has found a way to be outward-looking and visible across the world,” according to Andreadakis, bridging the gap between past and present, even as it looks to boost the filmmakers of tomorrow.\n\n\t“At the heart of the festival is always Greek cinema — and above all, the new, fresh, independent and groundbreaking voices,” he adds. “However, we must never forget that Greek cinema also has a long history, and we try to create moments and events that remind us where we come from.” \n\n\tThe Thessaloniki Film Festival runs Oct. 30 – Nov. 9.\n",

    "body": "\n\tApologies to all those with emetophobia: indie streamer Nebula is debuting director Patrick Willems‘ short film “The Dinner Plan” next month, the story of a man (played by Griffin Newman) trying desperately to just not vomit at his boss’ dinner party.\n\n\tStarring Newman, John Hodgman, Miriam Shor, Zach Cherry, Eudora Peterson, Geoffrey Cantor and Cindy Cheung, the 33-minute comedy-thriller movie will launch Nov. 26 on the streamer — just in time for Thanksgiving.\n\t\n\n\tPer the description for the film, which is directed by Willems and written by Michael Curran and Jacob Torpey based on a story by Willems: “When he’s pressured into attending a dinner party hosted by his boss, a man who suffers from a rare food allergy must navigate the most stressful night of his life with one primary objective: just don’t throw up in front of everyone.”\n\n\tIn the first trailer for Nebula’s “The Dinner Plan,” which Variety can exclusively reveal via the video above, it’s made very clear this man should not, under any circumstances, be eating tomatoes — and yet that seems to be his hosts’ favorite ingredient throughout the night.\n\n\t“The Dinner Plan” is produced by Nebula’s Dave Wiskus and Trenton Waterson. Zara Glaze is associate producer.\n\n\tThe film marks a milestone for indie streamer Nebula, a creator-owned subscription streaming platform that launched in 2019, which has slowly been ramping up to expand beyond its “edutainment” programming roots into scripted content.\n\n\tYouTube and Nebula star Willems is a filmmaker and video essayist based in New York, best known for his YouTube channel on which he blends long-form film criticism and narrative storytelling. His debut feature film, “Night of the Coconut,” was released in 2022 on Nebula.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJohn Malone, the executive and investor who has had a significant hand in shaping the cable TV, media and broadband sectors for more than five decades, is stepping down as chairman of his Liberty Media and Liberty Global holding companies.\n\n\tEffective Jan. 1, 2026, Malone will leave the board of directors of Liberty Media and transition to the role of chairman emeritus. At that time, current vice chairman Robert R. Bennett will assume the role of chairman of the board. Also Jan. 1, Malone will leave the board of Liberty Global, a European and U.K. telecom operator, and relinquish the chairman role, transitioning to chairman emeritus. Mike Fries, Liberty Global’s CEO and vice chairman, will succeed Malone as chairman.\n\t\n\n\tMalone, 84, earlier this year stepped down as a director on Warner Bros. Discovery’s board to assume the role of chair emeritus. Malone also is director emeritus of Liberty Latin America and chairman emeritus of the board for CableLabs.\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, Malone, dubbed the “cable cowboy” for his groundbreaking moves that shook up the sector, is set to reap a windfall from the $34.5 billion Charter Communications deal to acquire and merge with Cox Communications. Once that deal closes, his holding company Liberty Broadband will not be a direct shareholder in the newly combined company and will not have seats on the board.\n\n\tPrior to his role as a major investor in media and telecom, Malone from 1996 to 1999 was chairman and CEO of cable operator Tele-Communications Inc. until it was sold to AT&T (which subsequently sold the cable businesses in different markets to Charter, Comcast, Cox and Cablevision). Before that, he was president and CEO of TCI from 1973 to 1996.\n\t\n\n\tMalone’s “Born to Be Wired” memoir, published last month, “recounts the extraordinary saga of how America was wired — how a single copper strand evolved from a rural TV-antenna service into a high-speed backbone powering the internet and clearing the path for Amazon, Facebook and Google,” according to the blurb from publisher Simon & Schuster. “Malone offers an insider’s account of launching television’s first cable networks —including Discovery, TBS, QVC and BET — and the strategy behind era-defining mergers, from Warner Bros. Discovery to Live Nation Entertainment.”\n\n\tLiberty Media businesses are attributed to two tracking stock groups: the Formula One Group (which includes Liberty Media’s subsidiaries Formula 1, MotoGP, Quint and other minority investments) and its Liberty Live Group includes Liberty Media’s interest in Live Nation Entertainment.\n\n\tMalone said in a statement, “Founding Liberty Media and serving as its chairman has been among the most rewarding experiences of my professional life. With the successful simplification of our portfolio in recent years and our operating businesses in positions of strength, I believe it is an appropriate time to step back from certain of my obligations, and I am very pleased to have Dob Bennett, my partner and colleague of 35 years, stepping into the chairman role. Dob has been involved in all key decisions throughout Liberty Media’s history, and I am confident that Liberty is well-positioned for the future. I look forward to remaining actively engaged as a large Liberty shareholder and a strategic advisor to our management and Board.”\n\n\tBennett said in a statement, “I want to thank John for more than three decades of partnership and mentorship. His legacy as a visionary business leader is without parallel and I am deeply grateful for his confidence. I speak for the entire board in thanking John for his extraordinary leadership as our chairman and for his continuing engagement as chairman emeritus.”\n\n\tRegarding his transition at Liberty Global, Malone said: “Serving as chairman of Liberty Global over the past 20 years has been a tremendous journey. From our early investments to the creation of Liberty Global and the many chapters that followed, the return to long-term shareholders has been outstanding — and getting there has been, like the industry itself, never dull and a lot of fun.”\n\t\n\n\tAs of Aug. 31, Malone beneficially owned approximately 241,000 of Series A Formula One common stock, 2.364 million shares of Series B Formula One common stock and 2.515 million shares of Series C Formula One common stock, representing approximately 49.5% of the voting power of the Formula One common stock. He also held about 251,000 shares of Series A Liberty Live common stock, 2.465 million shares of Series B Liberty Live common stock and 4.314 million shares of Series C Liberty Live common stock, representing approximately 48.9% of the voting power of the Liberty Live common stock.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDaniel Radcliffe is returning to Broadway this spring in the solo play “Every Brilliant Thing.”\n\n\tThe actor, who became famous for playing the Boy Who Lived in eight wildly popular “Harry Potter” films, won his first Tony Award for the 2023 “Merrily We Roll Along” revival in which he starred alongside Jonathan Groff and Lindsay Mendez. Radcliffe made his Broadway debut in the 2007 play “Equus” and returned to the stage several times over the years in shows such as “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,” Martin McDonagh’s “The Cripple of Inishmaan” and “The Lifespan of a Fact.”\n\t\n\n\t“Every Brilliant Thing” was written by playwright Duncan Macmillan with British comedian Jonny Donahoe. The play begins previews on Feb. 21, 2026 ahead of opening night on March 12. The 13-week engagement will run through May 24 at Broadway’s Hudson Theatre.\n\n\n\tDirected by Jeremy Herrin, the play follows a man who creates a list of “brilliant things” to cheer up his suicidal mother. A press release describes the show as “exhilarating and heartwarming” that’s “all told through a list of every wonderful, beautiful, and delightful thing — big, small and everything in between — that makes life worth living.” Though it’s billed as a one-man show, “Every Brilliant Thing” involves audience participation. However, Radcliffe assured the New York Times that nobody in the crowd will be required to speak.\n\n\t“There’s something about the nature of this play and the connection that is being constantly made with the audience, from before the play even starts when I’m out there interacting with people as they come into the room, that I’m very intrigued by and excited by,” he told the Times. “This play is built with the audience new every night.” \n\t\n\n\t“Every Brilliant Thing” was first staged at Edinburgh Festival Fringe and ran in London and Off Broadway in 2014 before expanding to more than 80 countries. It was also adapted into an HBO special starring Donahoe, who originated the lead role. A production is currently running on London’s West End with Minnie Driver.\n\n\t“’Every Brilliant Thing’ tackles some serious subject matter, but the overall experience is one of joy and celebration,” said Macmillan. “Every performance is unique and unpredictable and it requires virtuosic skill from its central performer. When Daniel told us how much he loved the play, I couldn’t have been more thrilled. He has the intelligence, quick-wit and charm to roll with the spontaneous moments that the show invites — he can be a clown one moment, then grab you by the heartstrings the next. He has huge depth and humanity. I can’t wait to get started.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOne year after celebrating its 20th anniversary, the Thessaloniki Film Festival’s Agora industry arm is steadily building for the years ahead, doubling down on a time-tested formula that relies on equal parts tradition and innovation to bolster an event that remains both vital to the region and quintessentially Greek.\n\n\t“At the heart of Agora is the essence of philoxenia. The Greek word for hospitality which goes beyond simple politeness, embodying a spirit of generosity, openness and empathy towards guests, and is considered a fundamental cultural and moral duty,” says industry head Angeliki Vergou. “This is the distinction of Agora and the Thessaloniki Intl. Film Festival from other events. It is in our DNA.”\n\t\n\n\tSince assuming her current post in 2022, Vergou — an Agora veteran — has been tasked with preserving that DNA while ensuring the annual industry event keeps pace with the changing times. While a warm welcome in Greece’s second city is to be expected, Vergou understands that “staying relevant also means acknowledging the reality our industry faces.”\n\n\n\t“In Europe, funding sources are being discontinued, distribution channels are contracting, and decision-makers’ attention is increasingly fragmented,” she says. “The audiovisual community must evolve beyond traditional market models. While the industry is navigating significant challenges, we see this as an opportunity for visionary leadership, experimentation and meaningful change.” \n\n\tWhile the Agora’s long-standing goal has been first and foremost the support of the Greek and regional film industry, the event has increasingly broadened its geographical footprint in recent years, introducing new wrinkles such as the Bridge to the North initiative, which welcomes a delegation each year from the Baltics or Nordic countries “to look for new synergies” in Thessaloniki, Vergou says. This year’s guest country will be Finland.\n\t\n\n\tSimilarly, the Agora continues to develop its Agora Series strand, a two-day forum dedicated to TV and streaming production that takes places Nov. 1 – 2. This year’s event will see the introduction of Agora Series Talents, an initiative focused on Greek series screenwriters that will provide them with a dedicated workshop about the craft of TV scriptwriting, alongside one-on-one meetings and an event that will formally introduce them to the international industry. Agora Series highlights include a masterclass with Italian filmmaker Saverio Costanzo, the showrunner behind HBO and RAI’s adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s “My Brilliant Friend,” as well as a case study on the anticipated upcoming drama series “The Great Chimera,” produced by Athens-based Foss Productions in co-production with Beta Film and Greek public broadcaster ERT.\n\n\tWhile this year’s Agora Talks strand features discussions on hot-button issues such as film finance, emerging technologies and ongoing efforts to capture and retain moviegoers, Vergou and her team are also thinking outside the box with initiatives like the Decompression Room. Launched earlier this year’s at the Thessaloniki Documentary Festival, it offers “a space of quiet and the opportunity for people to relax, gather their thoughts and emotions and/or boost their energy in between meetings, workshops and pitches,” Vergou says. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAgora industry head Angeliki Vergou\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Thessaloniki International Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The integration of experts from different fields such as holistic therapy and initiatives such as the Decompression Room destigmatize the fact that many people in the audiovisual industry are in need of support,” she continues. “Few people outside the film world understand the immense toll that working in the film industry may have on our health — mental, physical and emotional alike.” \n\n\tMore than just a beloved gathering space for industry professionals, the Agora continues to be an important platform for filmmakers from the region through its Crossroads Co-Production Forum and Agora Works in Progress, which in recent years have given a boost to projects including Stephan Komandarev’s Karlovy Vary winner “Blaga’s Lessons,” Amjad Al Rasheed’s Cannes Critics’ Week player “Inshallah a Boy” and Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren’s Berlin competition entry “20,000 Species of Bees.” As in years past, notes Vergou, the Agora team is on the lookout for “projects that have international appeal and can find their space in an increasingly competitive marketplace while maintaining their distinctive voice and artistic integrity.”\n\t\n\n\tThis year’s Co-Production Forum, which runs Nov. 2 – 6, features 14 projects from 16 countries, among them “The Leaves Hang Trembling,” from Serbian director Stefan Djordjević, whose debut “Wind, Talk to Me” won top honors at this year’s Sarajevo Film Festival following its Rotterdam premiere; “The Life and Times of Ion G.,” from Romania’s Andreea Cristina Bortun, whose anticipated feature debut, “A River’s Gaze,” is produced by Sebastian Stan; and “Quiet Lake,” the latest from the acclaimed Bulgarian documentary filmmaker Tonislav Hristov, whose previous films have screened at festivals including Sundance, Tribeca, CPH:DOX and IDFA.\n\n\tMeanwhile, the Agora Works in Progress program will present eight films in the post-production stage from Southeastern Europe and the Mediterranean region. Included in the lineup is “Black Money for White Nights” (pictured, top), the latest feature from celebrated Bulgarian directing duo Kristina Grozeva and Petar Valchanov (“Triumph”); “The Boy With the Light-Blue Eyes,” the buzzy forthcoming feature debut of Greece’s Thanasis Neofotistos; and “The Lion at My Back,” the new film from veteran Cypriot filmmaker Tonia Mishiali (“Pause”).\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Boy With the Light-Blue Eyes” will take part in Works in Progress\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Cannes Film Market\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs the Agora team wraps two successful decades and prepares for the years ahead, Vergou says her hopes “are rooted in deepening the values that have defined us while adapting to serve an evolving industry.” \n\n\t“I envision Agora as a space for new models of collaboration — where the spirit of philoxenia extends beyond hospitality to genuine partnership and co-creation across borders and disciplines,” she says. “I hope we continue championing the voices of filmmakers from Greece, Southeastern Europe, the Mediterranean and beyond, whose stories might otherwise struggle to find platforms in a marketplace increasingly reluctant to take risks. \n\n\t“As the industry consolidates, regional markets like Agora become even more vital as spaces where distinctive, authentic voices can find their champions and partners,” she continues. “Ultimately, my hope is that Agora remains a place where people don’t just do business — they build community, find creative homes, and leave feeling energized about the future of cinema. If we can maintain that human connection at our core while innovating our formats and expanding our reach, Agora will continue to be relevant for the next 20 years and beyond.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Thessaloniki Film Festival runs Oct. 30 – Nov. 9.\n",

A twisty, nervy found-footage nightmare with a great ending that seems destined for feature treatment.\n\n\t\n\t\t“I Beg Your Pardon” (dir. John W. Lustig)\t\n\n\tThis animated short is a very funny examination of a man who admits to murder, but no one seems to care — to the point that it drives him mad. A coda set in Heaven is the perfect tart ending to the outrageous concept.\n\t\n\t\t“Sleep Tight” (dir. Grace Presse)\t\n\n\tDripping with atmosphere, Grace Presse’s portrait of a woman haunted by a sleep paralysis demon was genuinely creepy — punctuated by one perverse scene that had the audience squirming in their seats. Here’s hoping Presse gets to expand her vision into a feature project soon.\n\t\n\t\t“Loud” (dir. Adam Azimov)\t\n\n\tA music producer tries to add a haunting scream to a song, and it conjures up darkness. This short plays excellently with spooky audio mixing and feels claustrophobic until the shocking last moment.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t“Bill” (dir. Emily Dhue)\t\n\n\tA verbally-abusive husband transforms into the perfect man… after he’s killed and turned into a marionette corpse puppet by his wife. Director Emily Dhue gives this short a retro feel, which juxtaposes the husband’s obsession with cosmetic surgery, and it’s easy to see writer and star Deana Taheri topline her own “Pearl”-esque feature.\n",

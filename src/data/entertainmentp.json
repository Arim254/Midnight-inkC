    "body": "\n\tIt took Qatari director Mohammed Al-Ibrahim 15 years to make his first feature “Sa3ood Wainah?,” which, starting from its title, is a pretty unique film blending thriller, fantasy and magic realism elements, all imbued with a strong local flavor.\n\n\tBilled as the first “commercial” film to come out of Qatar, “Sa3ood Wainah?” – the title translates as “Where is Saoud?” – launched from the inaugural Doha Film Festival this week, where it was cheered by the home crowd. It’s produced by Katara Studios which is keen on fostering filmmaking and content production in the minuscule gas-rich Gulf nation.\n\t\n\n\tSet in a remote Qatari farmhouse, “Sa3ood Wainah?” turns on two brothers named Hamood and Sa3ood, who one night entertain their friends with a magic trick passed down by their late father. This leads to the disappearance of Sa3oud and the blurring of boundaries between illusion and reality.\n\n\n\tKatara Studios will be releasing the film theatrically in the Gulf region next year.\n\n\tAl-Ibrahim, who studied filmmaking at UC Irvine, started his career working at the Doha Film Institute, and has been cutting his teeth making lots of shorts and commercials. As current head of longform at Katara Studios, he directed the music video for the FIFA World Cup 2022 song “Arhbo” that got more than 100 million views on YouTube.\n\n\tAl-Ibrahim spoke to Variety in Doha about why it’s crucial that his feature debut be “a grassroots Qatari film.” \n\n\tHow did you come up with the concept, which is pretty innovative, especially for the region?\n\n\tI consume quite a bit of genre, and I feel like people here have a huge appetite for genre as well. So it’s only fair that we as Qataris or people in the Gulf region can have some sort of visual representation of ourselves in that light. That was the first thing. And then my colleague Jassim Abel, and I co-wrote the story. I wrote the screenplay, he co-wrote the treatment with me. We were having a lot of “what if?” discussions. Such as how can we make a movie that’s self-contained? We were discussing films such as [Sidney Lumet’s courtroom drama] “12 Angry Men” and other films that take place on one location. We started with the “what ifs?” And the one that stuck with us was: what if a magic trick were not something magic. What if it was real?\n\t\n\n\tIt seems to me that you really wanted to make this film culturally specific. What were the elements from Qatari culture that you drew upon?\n\n\tMagic is part of our folklore. This goes back to the time of ancient Egypt. It’s there, though it’s not talked about very much. So I definitely wanted some of that. As far as themes go, from a modern perspective, I think in our identities, we sometimes tend to lead double lives. So I wanted that to be a part of the film as well. And I wanted to look into why people decide to lead double lives from our perspective. We’ve seen it in lots of films coming from the West, but I wanted to have a take on that from here.\n\n\tYou cast all Qatari actors, which is an interesting choice since this is a commercial feature. Did you consider other options?\n\n\tI’ll be honest with you, there was that conversation in the beginning. We were wondering if we should have some talent from Saudi Arabia or from Kuwait. But then we quickly realized that we had to focus on our mission. And that mission is a grassroots Qatari film. A Qatari story told and performed by Qataris. Not only for me, but I think for Katara Studios as well, it’s very important that we let people know that: hey, we’re here; we exist. And we want you to see what we’re up to.\n\n\tThe audience in Doha certainly seemed to enjoy it. How did it feel launching the flm at the inaugural Doha Film Festival amid a flurry of announcements from the nascent Film Committee  about ways in which Qatar is building a film industry?\n\n\tIt makes me feel great. I feel like I’m getting involved. I mean it’s been a 15-year journey trying to make a feature film and to cement myself as a filmmaker. And I feel like I’m here in the right place at the right time. I feel like as a nation we are investing heavily in cinema as a cultural export. We realize the power of story and how it’s an extension of our identity, and an extension of diplomacy. The fact that the Qatar Film Committee is spearheading this is a testament to that.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Katara Studios\n\t\n\n\n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWarner Bros.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Director Commentary (Updated Nov. 27, 2025): Park Chan-wook makes his first appearance in the projected best director lineup this season, signaling a meaningful shift in an already fluid race. His precision-crafted work on Neon’s “No Other Choice” has quietly built momentum across the fall festivals, winning audience awards, and as shown in the latest forecast, now stands shoulder to shoulder with some of the year’s most formidable contenders.\n\n\tElsewhere in the field, Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” continues to climb with purpose and resonance after its strong showing with Critics Choice’s shortlist announcement. The film’s blend of muscular storytelling and cultural urgency has made it one of the season’s most widely admired entries, keeping Coogler firmly entrenched among the top contenders. If the momentum holds, Coogler could make history as the first Black filmmaker to win the Oscar for best director — a barrier the Academy has yet to break in nearly 100 years. \n\n\tWith titles such as “One Battle After Another,” “Hamnet” and “Sentimental Value” continuing to secure industry admiration, the race remains competitive and incredibly unpredictable. As precursors begin to roll out next week and late-year screenings intensify, the field appears poised for further evolution.\n\n\tNext stop…the Gothams Awards in New York City, which will be handed out as James Cameron’s anticipated “Avatar: Fire and Ash” is premiering in L.A.\n\n\tBig week ahead.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed category classifications are subject to change.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: \"Sentimental Value\" (Courtesy of Cannes Film Festival)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of 20th Century Studios\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Jean-Louis Fernandez/Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Credit: Quim Vives\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection / A24\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tA week after its landmark four-year, $1 billion-plus deal securing the rights to show Champion League matches in the U.K., Paramount+ has doubled-down on British soccer.\n\n\tThe streamer has signed a partnership with Arsenal — currently sitting atop the U.K.’s Premier League — that it says will see the team’s “players, club legends and supporters come together to celebrate some of Paramount+’s iconic series.”\n\n\n\tAmong those series mentioned are “Landman” and “MobLand,” with Paramount saying Arsenal will collaborate on social media campaigns and that Paramount+ branding will be featured inside the stadium, big screens, matchday programmes and other experiences and activations. \n\t\n\n\tAs part of the announcement, Paramount+ released a promotional video entitled “For the Love of the Team” narrated by Arsenal icon Thierry Henry, who currently works as a pundit for CBS Sports.\n\n\t“We’re beyond excited to unite Paramount+ and Arsenal– two global iconic brands with supporters that live and breathe passion,” said Marco Nobili, executive vice president and international general manager of Paramount+. “With hit series like ‘SpongeBob,’ ‘South Park,’ ‘Landman,’ ‘Yellowstone’ and more, we’re creating experiences that celebrate teamwork, elevate the game and connect supporters. This partnership brings the drama, comedy, and unforgettable moments of both worlds to life – on the pitch and beyond.”\n\n\tThe moves come following the dramatic entering of Paramount into the U.K. soccer landscape after it won the auction to broadcast most Champions League matches from 2027 to 2031. The company beat current rights holders TNT with reported to be considerably higher than the $1.3 billion TNT paid. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMAD World, the Arab world’s leading international film sales agent, has picked up “Sophia,” directed by and starring Dhafer L’Abidine, who also stars in “Palestine 36,” Palestine’s Oscar entry. “Sophia” has its world premiere on Tuesday at Marrakech Film Festival, where “Palestine 36” also screens.\n\n\t“Sophia,” which centers on a trip to reconnect a daughter with her roots gone wrong, also stars Jessica Brown Findlay (“Brave New World,” “Harlots,” “Downton Abbey”), Jonathan Hyde (“The Brutalist”), Kais Setti (“Tracing Addai,” “Haps”), Hiba Abouk (“The Prince”), and Maya Celine Gharbi.\n\t\n\n\tThe film follows Emily, who – against the wishes of her father – travels from London to Tunisia in the hopes of reconnecting her daughter, Sophia, with her estranged husband. The unthinkable happens when Sophia disappears, and lies and deceit quickly ensnare the broken family. Emily’s world is flipped upside down as she races against time to find her daughter.\n\n\n\tL’Abidine, who was interviewed this week by Variety, said: “ ‘Sophia’ is a thriller with a heart. When I started working on it, I wanted to tell a human story, one that transcends geography and nationality, and speaks to audiences everywhere.”\n\n\tAlaa Karkouti and Maher Diab, co-founders of MAD World, said: “ ‘Sophia’ is a bold and raw take on the clash between the present and the past, the interplay of where we are now and where we come from, and the lengths we go to reconcile them so that we can walk toward the future unburdened. It is beautiful to watch, and we’re excited to bring it to the world.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film brings together L’Abidine’s own production company, Double A Productions, with L’Abidine as the producer, and New Sparta Productions in a Tunisian-British co-production.\n\n\tChristopher Simon, the film’s co-producer, said, “Especially in times like these, telling stories that foster deeper understanding, empathy, and connection between our worlds feels more important than ever.”\n\n\tThe film is lensed by Willie Nel, and edited by Hafedh Laaridhi, with Adel Ouni serving as the production designer, Moncef Taleb on sound, and Selim Arjoun handling the score.\n\n\tL’Abidine’s career spans British television, international cinema, and major productions across the Arab world. A graduate of the Birmingham School of Speech and Drama, he began his screen journey in the U.K. with shows such as “Dream Team” and “Spooks.” He went on to appear in high-profile films like “Children of Men” and “Sex and the City 2,” and on TV series including “The Looming Tower” and “The Eddy.” In the Arab region, he became a household name through series such as “Maktoub,” “Halawat El Donia” and “Arous Beirut.”\n\n\tAs a director, L’Abidine made his feature debut with “Ghodwa,” which he co-wrote, directed, starred in, and produced through Double A Productions. The film was shortlisted for the Golden Globe Awards and won the FIPRESCI Prize at the Cairo Film Festival. His second feature, “To My Son,” earned best film and a special mention for screenwriting at the Hollywood Arab Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Behind the Palm Trees” director Meryem Benm’barek is navigating a swirl of emotions as her film prepares for its world premiere at the Marrakech Film Festival. \n\n\tOn the one hand, the Moroccan auteur — whose feature debut “Sofia” was acclaimed in Un Certain Regard in 2018 — is deeply moved to unveil her latest work in her home country.\n\n\t“I know my film will be received here on a very deep level,” she tells Variety. \n\n\n\tAt the same time, that joy crowns years of struggle to bring the project to life. “Making this film was very hard,” she says. “For seven years I went through moments of real despair, but I never gave up. Above all, I held onto my vision, even though the process was extraordinarily complicated and the film was made under very difficult economic conditions.”\n\t\n\n\tUnlike her 2018 breakout, “Behind the Palm Trees” did not benefit from key public mechanisms that often prove essential for projects of this scale. The absence of French institutional support was particularly striking for a film featuring well-known performers such as Carole Bouquet and Olivier Rabourdin. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCarole Bouquet in ‘Behind the Palm Trees’\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It says something about how difficult it is for France today to look at the consequences of its colonial past straight in the eye in order to repair certain things,” Benm’barek reflects. “It’s also hard, I think, for many French people to accept the position they still occupy in many countries, particularly in Africa.”\n\n\tInstead, the film came together through a patchwork of international and local solidarity. “The film existed thanks to the support of England, Morocco and Belgium, but also thanks to a collective momentum from the Tangier community, which fully rallied around the project,” she says. “I’m lucky to have many friends in Tangier who helped me. It truly became a collective effort for the film to exist. We lacked money, but we didn’t give up.”\n\t\n\n\tCrucially, she adds, her creative autonomy was never compromised. “My producers never once asked me to make artistic concessions [especially around the frank depictions of sexuality, which made the project challenging in certain territories],” she continues. “Unfortunately, given the state of the film industry today, directors often have to compromise — sometimes even during the writing process. But I can say that this film fully reflects my vision of the world. Every line of dialogue, every shot, every camera move was thought through and carefully chosen. That makes all the difference; I left absolutely nothing to chance.”\n\n\tIndeed, it would be nearly impossible to erase all traces of sexuality from an intimate thriller centered on a young man from Tangier torn between two starkly different romantic partners. While young contractor Mehdi (Driss Ramdi) is already half-engaged to Selma (Nadia Kounda), a socially reserved bakery worker, he soon finds himself drawn to the sexually liberated Marie (Sara Giraudeau) — an affluent Frenchwoman who begins as a client before becoming his lover and social benefactor, fueling his fantasies of upward mobility and a different life.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDriss Ramdi and Sara Giraudeau \n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I needed to maintain absolute creative freedom,” Benm’barek explains. “Marie gives access to her body — and it was important that this could be seen, since the story is experienced through Mehdi’s gaze. Selma, by contrast, is defined by modesty; she doesn’t reveal herself and denies access to her body. The intimate scenes therefore required a different visual language. These were deliberate choices, reflecting my artistic vision and the direction I wanted for the film, even if they may not resonate with everyone.” \n\n\tFilms like “Dirty Dancing” and “Titanic” resonated with Benm’barek as she developed her latest feature, inspiring her to blend sharp social commentary with a compelling, accessible narrative. \n\n\t“‘Dirty Dancing’ was so far ahead of its time,” she says. “It deals with abortion, class divisions, the emancipation of a young girl becoming a woman and freeing herself from her father. [And ‘Titanic,’ like many films]  follow a character moving from one social class to another.” \n\n\t“I was raised on 90s thrillers and those slightly cheesy TV movies on Saturday nights,” she continues. “I make the kinds of films I would’ve loved as a spectator. I don’t think we should overthink everything. Pleasure has to stay at the center, because making films is hard — and it’s only getting harder.”\n\t\n\n\t“Ours is a job full of doubt, where nothing is ever really easy,” she says. “So it’s important to hold on to that place of pleasure, to remember what made us want to create films in the first place. We were spectators before anything else, and we were moved by films. That sense of pleasure is essential — otherwise, it just becomes too hard to keep going.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDriss Ramdi and Nadia Kounda\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe French Embassy’s Institut français d’Indonésie (IFI) has launched the second edition of the Indonesia-France Film Lab, running Nov. 27 through Dec. 1 in Yogyakarta.\n\n\tThe initiative, presented as Indonesia France Film Lab X MTN Lab, takes place within the JAFF Market framework during the 27th Festival Sinema Prancis. The program is partnering with Indonesia’s Ministry of Culture under the Manajemen Talenta Nasional program, the Association of Indonesian Film Producers (APROFI), and the Asian Film Alliance Network (AFAN).\n\t\n\n\tSix emerging Indonesian director-producer teams developing their first or second features have been selected for the lab, which receives additional support from France’s Centre national du cinéma et de l’image animée (CNC) and La Fémis film school.\n\n\n\tThe program comprises two components: a scriptwriting workshop led by French script consultant Eric Collins from La Fémis, and an industry lab featuring five French film professionals. The roster includes Thomas Rosso, general coordinator of La Semaine de la Critique at Cannes; producers Xénia Maingot (Eaux Vives Productions), Jérémie Palanque (Woooz Pictures), Christophe Bruncher (Ici et Là Productions), and Marine Arrighi de Casanova (Apsara Films).\n\n\tSelected projects include M. Dhaffa Attoriq’s “A Mother’s Niqab” from 3 Pulau Pictures, Maarij Reka’s “The Boy with His Mother’s Statue” from Veneirs Films, and Daphne’s “The First Journey of Grief” from Aztec Production. Also chosen were Devina Sofiyanti’s “The Heirlooms” from Qun Films, Fanny Chotimah’s “The Last Dance” from Kembang Gula, and Trinisha Aksa’s “What to Wear for My Own Funeral” from Ujung Pandang Studios.\n\t\n\n\tLooking ahead to 2026, several lab projects will be presented at a CNC-organized co-production meeting featuring Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, with 15 selected projects total. Michel Plazanet, deputy director for European and international affairs at CNC, is participating in this year’s lab, following CNC president Gaëtan Bruel’s Jakarta visit in July.\n\n\tLa Semaine de la Critique has also announced Next Step Studio Indonesia, a short film co-creation program for emerging Indonesian directors launching in May 2026.\n\n\t“Building on the joint cultural strategy between France and Indonesia adopted by our two Presidents last May in Borobudur, the Indonesia-France Film Lab highlights our joint commitment to supporting emerging Indonesian filmmakers, who represent the next generation of talents – ‘the Indonesian new wave.’ It is co-organised and co-funded by the Indonesian ministry of Culture, the French Embassy and Aprofi. With its strengthened curriculum and the strong institutional support of the French National Center for Cinema (CNC) and La Fémis, considered as one of the world’s leading film schools, the Lab has become an important platform for fostering new co-production opportunities,” said Fabien Penone, French ambassador to Indonesia, Timor Leste and ASEAN.\n\n\t“For JAFF Market, the presence of this lab reinforces our mission to become a true meeting point between Indonesian talent and the global film community. It deepens our role as a catalyst – connecting filmmakers, producers, and institutions while creating long-term creative pathways. I see the Indonesia-France Film Lab lab as one of the most strategic collaborations we’ve built. It provides Indonesian filmmakers with direct, consistent access to mentors, methodologies, and artistic approaches that have shaped some of the world’s most influential cinema,” added Gita Fara, head of program for JAFF Market.\n\n\t“The Indonesia-France Lab is a wonderful platform that offers Indonesian filmmakers the opportunity to develop strong scripts, fostering potential for international collaboration and bringing Indonesian projects to the global market,” said Edwin Nazir, chairman of APROFI.\n\n\tSelected Projects:\n\n\t“A Mother’s Niqab” Director: M. Dhaffa Attoriq Producer: Stephanie Ong Production Company: 3 Pulau Pictures\n\t\n\n\t“The Boy With His Mother’s Statue” Director: Maarij Reka Producer: Mozad Irvany Production Company: Veneirs Films\n\n\t“The First Journey of Grief” Director: Daphne Producer: Alvin Wijaya Production Company: Aztec Production\n\n\t“The Heirlooms” Writer/Director: Devina Sofiyanti Co-Writer: Ahmad Yuniardi Producer: Giovanni Rahmadeva Production Company: Qun Films\n\n\t“The Last Dance” Director/Producer: Fanny Chotimah Writer: Adimas Immanuel Production Company: Kembang Gula\n\n\t“What to Wear for My Own Funeral” Director: Trinisha Aksa Writer: Haediqal Pawennei Producers: Haediqal Pawennei, Rania Sulfa Production Company: Ujung Pandang Studios\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” has roared to a phenomenal start in China, setting multiple box office records and signaling strong momentum for the animated sequel’s global rollout.\n\n\tThe film, a buddy cop movie with anthropomorphic animals as the bickering partners, earned $34 million on its opening day in China, per numbers from Disney, marking the highest opening day and highest single-day box office ever for a U.S. animated film in the territory. The performance also represents the strongest opening day for any U.S. title in China since May 2021.\n\t\n\n\tThe opening day ranks as the 10th highest opening day of all time for a U.S. release in China overall. Social scores have been excellent, with the film earning a 9.7 rating on Maoyan, comparing favorably to the original “Zootopia” (9.5), “Inside Out 2” (9.1) and “Ralph Breaks The Internet” (8.8).\n\n\n\tGlobally, “Zootopia 2” has accumulated an estimated $81.1 million, with $39.5 million from domestic markets and $41.6 million from international territories. The film opened Wednesday in 17 markets, including France, Germany, Italy, China and Korea.\n\n\tThe domestic opening day performance marked the second highest Wednesday before Thanksgiving of all time, behind only “Moana 2” ($57.9 million), and the third highest domestic opening day for a Walt Disney Animation Studios animated title behind “Moana 2” and “Frozen 2” ($42.2 million).\n\n\tAudience reception has been strong across the board, with the film earning 95% from Rotten Tomatoes audiences, an “A” CinemaScore and 4.5 out of 5 stars from PostTrak.\n\n\tBeyond China, “Zootopia 2” secured the number one position in most international markets. In Korea, the opening day marked the fifth highest animated opening day of all time and the second highest opening day among all Walt Disney Animation Studios films behind “Frozen 2.” The film earned $1.7 million in the territory, with social scores of 9.30 on Naver and 98% on CGV.\n\t\n\n\tIn Europe, the film achieved the highest MPA animated opening day of 2025 in France, Germany and Italy, earning $2.4 million, $700,000 and $600,000 respectively.\n\n\tThe sequel continues its rollout this weekend and will be open in approximately 93% of the international landscape by Sunday, including all markets except Japan, which opens the following weekend.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt has been a while since the “Cold War” craze and its three Academy Award nominations, but its Polish breakout star Joanna Kulig will soon reunite with director Paweł Pawlikowski once again. \n\n\t“I’m singing in his next film,” she says. In the anticipated drama, starring Sandra Hüller, known as “1949/Vaterland,” Pawlikowski will explore the life of Thomas and Erika Mann in post-war Germany. \n\n\n\t“This will be our fourth collaboration. I’m so proud this film exists, especially in these difficult times post-pandemic and strikes. Cinema is still fighting back.”\n\t\n\n\tKulig’s extensive run on the awards circuit – which coincided with her becoming a mother to a baby boy – raised her international profile, but she resisted the pressure to pursue solely U.S. projects. At Torino Film Festival, she’s presenting Nora Jaenicke’s psychological thriller “Isola.”\n\n\t“Right after ‘Cold War,’ things got a bit crazy. I know some people expected me to stay [in the U.S.], but one reason why I’ve always admired Paweł Pawlikowski is that he has his own, very specific way of developing films. You have to find something that works for you and brings you peace and joy, instead of listening to all these external voices,” she notes. \n\n\t“’Cold War’ opened me up to multiculturalism and so many new opportunities. They probably wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for that film. However, I also want to have a family life, and I think I’ve achieved that balance right now.” \n\n\tFollowing Berlinale opener “She Came to Me” and Apple TV+ miniseries “Masters of the Air,” she’s focusing on European productions. \n\t\n\n\t“They’re much closer. With ‘Isola,’ I could do so many things in Warsaw. I’ve always wanted to have a base, a permanent place of my own, and I’ve managed to build it now. It’s funny, because people in Poland keep asking me: ‘Oh, so you’re back?’ I never left!,” she laughs.\n\n\t“We Poles are incredibly open to learning new languages and entering new working environments. There’s still this thought at the back of our head that we’re not good enough, which is a remnant from the communist era. My generation believed that the West was better somehow, but it’s time we learnt to appreciate ourselves.” \n\n\tBefore Pawlikowski’s latest, Kulig gets to sing in Jaenicke’s film as well, where she plays the much younger wife of a dying man, also named Joanna. Stuck on a remote island, she’s happy to welcome new caretaker Ada (Fanny Ardant), but Ada’s affection soon turns into obsession. \n\n\tJaenicke explains: “It was a Sicilian song because at first, the film was supposed to be set in Stromboli. We needed a brief moment when they could connect. They don’t need words; they just look at each other. This song really moves Ada and she gets to see a wild side of Joanna that wants to break free from being just a wife.” \n\n\t“When I got to know Joanna [Kulig], her character rewrote itself, in a way. She has this intense gaze and she can look so angelic, but then there’s a shift. I saw a little bit of a devil in her too.”\n\n\t“Isola” is produced by Manish Mundra, Ariens Damsi and Jaenicke for Drishyam Films International and Eliofilm. \n\n\tJaenicke, who is making her feature debut, also wanted to show Ardant in a different light. “We haven’t really seen her in a role like this before. Fanny said she liked Ada because ‘she isn’t likeable.’” \n\n\tThen again, nobody is likeable in “Isola.” According to co-star Marco Rossetti, playing Joanna’s love interest, Jaenicke’s film has a noir feel, with all the characters inflicting psychological and physical violence on each other and ultimately being united by their “ambiguous morality.”\n\n\t“It’s almost like some archetypal story,” the director sums up.\n\n\t“Ada comes into Joanna’s life when she’s already thinking about breaking free from her pattern: she always ends up with people who try to control her. In a way, it’s a feminist story. But then it’s another woman who suddenly dominates her, just like a man.” \n",

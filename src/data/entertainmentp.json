    "body": "\n\tIdris Elba opened his Red Sea Film Festival conversation with the screening of “Dust to Dreams,” a short film shot in Lagos, starring Seal, Nse Ikpe-Etim, and Constance Olatunde, marking his second turn behind the camera. For Elba, the decision to film in Nigeria felt inevitable. “It seemed weird that I hadn’t made a movie there yet,” he said, noting the strength of Nollywood. “The film industry is huge. It’s worth five billion, plus incredible talent.”\n\t\n\n\tHe linked the project to a long-running interest in spotlighting narratives often defined by outsiders. “Anywhere that has an underserved voice, where the narrative is often fed to us rather than us providing the narrative,” he said, “that’s where I want to be.” Elba drew a parallel between Africa and the Middle East, saying festivals like Red Sea give filmmakers “a springboard, a voice.”\n\n\tElba also discussed “This Is How It Goes,” the Apple Originals feature which recently wrapped filming in Ghana. The film is an adaptation of the Neil LaBute play he performed two decades ago. He calls the film an “incredible examination of marriage, of trust, of race.” Wunmi Mosaku and Charlie Cox co-star, with Elba both acting and directing. “I literally just finished last week,” he said. “It was fantastic.”\n\n\n\tAfter “Yardie,” his 2018 directorial debut and several projects still to come, Elba acknowledged he is leaning toward a new chapter in his career. “Eventually, I want to transfer to being a director fully,” he said. “I’ve been acting for a long time. I love it still. But directing allows me to flex slightly different muscles.”\n\t\n\n\tFor Elba, the move toward directing is tied directly to a larger mission off-screen. “There’s a huge opportunity across Africa,” he said, “but the policies are really important.” He pointed to gaps in copyright, licensing, and tax incentives, saying his focus has shifted to working with ministers and cultural agencies. Ultimately, he hopes to “build studios and schools, or schools attached to studios” to create a sustainable creative workforce across the continent.\n\n\tAsked about decisions he made about his early career trajectory, Elba recalled making a pact with his agent “that we don’t want to play slaves, and we don’t want to play just gangsters.” He recounted auditioning for a role in Steven Spielberg’s “Amistad,” only realizing later that the film centered on a revolt on a slave ship. “It was just a principle of mine,” he said. “I did not want to do it.”\n\n\tReflecting on the years that followed and eventually landing his breakthrough role in “The Wire,” Elba recounted how he struggled to land work in the U.S., often because his American accent “just wasn’t it.” He cycled through menial jobs, DJed to make ends meet and, at one point, experienced homelessness. “I wasn’t going in doing an accent,” he said. “I was surviving as a person in America.” Immersed in the culture around him, the accent came naturally, and with it the role of Stringer Bell in “The Wire,” an ironic breakthrough for an actor who had once sworn off both slave roles and the very gangster archetype that ultimately made him famous.\n\n\tAsked what he still aspires to beyond film, Elba surprised the audience, saying, “There is a possibility that I may go to school and just study, not political science, but human science,” sharing his hope that it will make him more effective in philanthropy and mentorship. “Humans respond to humans,” he said. “I want to be that beacon for young people.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSpeaking at the Red Sea Film Festival in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, Anthony Hopkins explained how he approached the role of Hannibal Lecter in Jonathan Demme’s “The Silence of the Lambs.”\n\n\tHopkins recalled that when his agent, Jeremy Conway, told him he was sending over the script for “The Silence of the Lambs,” the actor “thought it was a children’s fairy tale.” But he had read just 10 pages of the script, when he phoned Conway to say, “This is the best part I’ve ever read. It’s only very small part, but I know how to play him.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnthony Hopkins and Stella Hopkins at the Red Sea Film Festival\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Daniele Venturelli/Getty Images for the Red Sea Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen asked how he wanted to play Lecter, he answered, “I want to play him as a machine. He’s an intellectual genius, trapped in a psychotic form where he has absolutely no feeling for humanity. He has compassion, but no sense of humanity. I’m not well versed in psychology, but I do believe that he’s psychotic.”\n\n\n\tHopkins explained how he approached the scene when Lecter meets Clarice Starling for the first time. “I remember we were setting up, and the director said to me, ‘When Clarice Starling comes down the corridor, how do you want to be seen? Asleep or having a meal or something?’ I said, ‘I want to be standing right in the center of the cell, because I can smell her coming down the corridor.”\n\n\tHopkins compared Lecter to Mephistopheles in J.W. von Goethe’s “Faust.” “He knows the vulnerable part of ourselves, the seductive part of ourselves, and he knows about her cheap shoes, and he knows about her ambition,” he said.\n\n\tTo the delight of the Saudi audience, he recited his best-known lines in the film, including, “I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti,” with the sucking sound at the end. He explained he had borrowed this sound from Bela Lugosi as the count in 1931’s “Dracula,” when he sees John Harker cut himself shaving, and makes the same sound as the blood begins to flow.\n\t\n\n\tAsked about the restraint he exhibited playing Stevens in “The Remains of the Day,” he mentioned that he had been taught a great lesson by Katharine Hepburn, when appearing in his first film, “The Lion in Winter.” She told him, “You don’t have to act. Just be what you are.” Hopkins added, “So the stiller you are, the more compelling you are.”\n\n\tHe then went off on a tangent to criticize actors who mumble. “Young actors tend to mumble. I know they’re trying to do Marlon Brando, but Brando was the greatest technician of all. He understood everything. He was a very smart man, and he knew how to do it.” He recalled a young actor who mumbled. “I said, ‘You have no career left if you’re mumbling. Your part in this film is to tell a story.'”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRyan Coogler told The New York Times that his decision to reject an invitation to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nearly 10 years ago had nothing to do with bitterness against Oscar voters. \n\n\t“It’s not out of animosity,” Coogler said, adding that his commitments to directorial projects, unions and his film school stretches him thin. “And I’m not good at judging things, bro. The act of ‘Hey, pick the best thing’ is very stressful for me, even when there’s no stakes involved.” \n\t\n\n\tCoogler said that while he enjoys awards season because he gets to hang out with his collaborators and industry friends, he’s not interested in the glam of the Oscar race. He summed it up by saying: “People see the tuxedo, they see the red carpet, but it’s real blue-collar folks making these movies happen.” \n\n\n\tThe Academy invited Coogler to join its ranks in 2016, the year after Coogler delivered a critical and commercial smash hit with “Creed.” Sylvester Stallone earned an Oscar nomination for the movie, but “Creed” was left out of the best picture, director and actor races. The same fate befell Coogler’s industry breakthrough “Fruitvale Station,” which the Oscars entirely ignored. Even when Coogler’s “Black Panther” picked up seven Oscar nominations, including becoming the first superhero movie nominated for best picture, Coogler was left out of the best director race.\n\n\t“I don’t buy into this versus that, or ‘this movie wasn’t good enough to make this list,’” Coogler told The Hollywood Reporter in 2021 about turning down the Academy. “I love movies. For me, that’s good enough. If I’m going to be a part of organizations, they’re going to be labor unions, where we’re figuring out how to take care of each other’s families and health insurance. But I know that these things bring exposure.”\n\t\n\n\tCoogler is back in the Oscar race with “Sinners,” which is widely considered a frontrunner to land a best picture nomination and several other noms. Coogler could finally land his first Oscar nomination for best director, and he’s only in the running for a best original screenplay nomination. Coogler was nominated in the best picture category in 2022 as a producer on “Judas and the Black Messiah.”\n\n\tHead over to The New York Times’ website to read Coogler’s latest profile in its entirety. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTobias Jesso Jr. celebrated turning 40 with a serendipitous gift: Justin Bieber’s “Swag,” an album he’d worked on over the past three years, happened to be released on the same day his new decade began this past July. “I was cleaning up my house, getting ready for my birthday, listening to it. I was like, ‘I can’t even fucking believe he did it,’” recalls Jesso from his Los Angeles home as he prepares to move to Australia. “I was in the room for all of this melting pot stuff and here it is, the finished thing, and it was so good. I love those records, and it was such a proud moment. It was just amazing.” \n\t\n\n\t“Swag” was one of many milestones this year for the singer-songwriter, who scored a 2026 Grammy nomination for songwriter of the year (non-classical) in early November. He’s no stranger to the category — he won the trophy during its inaugural year in 2023 — but his inclusion further cemented his standing as one of pop music’s most dependable scribes. A seasoned veteran whose first credit was on Adele’s “When We Were Young,” Jesso appeared in the liner notes this year for songs including Miley Cyrus’ “Golden Burning Sun,” Haim’s “Relationships” and Olivia Dean’s “Man I Need,” the latter of which became one of 2025’s breakout hits. \n\n\n\tSince debuting as a tender balladeer with his debut solo album, “Goon,” in 2015, Jesso has amassed a songwriting discography that spans everyone from Daniel Caesar and Camila Cabello to Harry Styles and Dua Lipa. He exercises the luxury of often saying no to collaboration and picks projects that align with his own tastes and interests. “I only want to work on music that I’m gonna put on a playlist for myself,” he says. “It’s like being a part of a product that you know you want to use when it’s done. It’s a lot different than being a part of something where you’re like, ‘I would never fucking use this product.’ You know I mean? It gives you a different sense of purpose.”\n\t\n\n\tFor Jesso, that meant stepping into the world of Bieber back in 2022 to begin work on “Swag,” which picked up four Grammy nominations, including album of the year. The pop singer assembled a group of certified hitmakers — Dijon, Carter Lang and Dylan Wiggins among them — to forge a new musical direction following his change in management. “I think Justin was in a period of going like, ‘How am I gonna represent myself?’” he says. “And a good way for him to proceed with that was to put people around him whom he trusted.” Jesso recalls that the album slowly took shape as they wrote in locations like France and Iceland, where he realized everything had finally fallen into place. “All the trust had been built. The family was a unit. We just needed to wrap it up, put the pieces together.”\n\n\tHe also appeared in the credits for Dean’s “Man I Need,” a global hit that reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Jesso was introduced to the English singer-songwriter after his frequent collaborator Sir Nolan, with whom he co-wrote Caesar’s “Always,” invited him to work on “Something Inbetween” with Dean. “I have a routine where I go in trying to make everyone feel comfortable and settle down easy,” he says. “But I could tell within five minutes she doesn’t need that — she gave the forceful energy of somebody who was there for a reason, knew what they were doing, who they were, what they wanted to sound like and was ready to rock.”\n\n\tAmid his fruitful songwriting career, Jesso carved out six weeks to record his long-awaited sophomore album “Shine,” which he released with little notice in late November. The album is a curtailed collection of eight songs that could potentially scan as demos — he performed and recorded each one over and over, picking the best for the project — and addresses everything from the grief of a divorce to the blessings of his son. It was an unlikely venture for Jesso, who essentially swore off his solo career after releasing “Goon,” disillusioned by the spotlight and the pressures that came with it.\n\n\t“[Shine] was the culmination of what happened in my 30s and how I had processed my own advice and everything I was going through,” he says. “I was so bummed out and depressed and in a weird place, but the music wasn’t stressful. It was so helpful. I hadn’t really needed that for a long time. I’d been so in my head. And I was using all of my music stuff for other people. So it was really strange to come back to it. And I think I came back to it in a grounded way, where I’m already saying to my manager like, oh, I think I could do this again. And this is way, way better than what it was like for ‘Goon,’ you know, but I’m a different person.”\n\t\n\n\t“Shine” was, in the end, the product of working out who he is as a musician while helping others to do the same, outside of the expectations and accolades that come with it. “I’m so grateful that I’ve established a career where Grammys could be a part of it,” he says. “And I would definitely love as many Grammys as they want to give me. But it’s not the intention or the goal. My whole thing with the Grammys this year was just to not sacrifice my own integrity to get it. And if I do get another Grammy and it’s based solely on the songs that I’ve been a part of, I’ll feel very proud and also proud of the artists that I worked with for making it all happen.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tEverybody knows Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz and the legend of “I Love Lucy.” But do they really?\n\n\tThere have been several movies over the years about the two icons, including Aaron Sorkin’s recent “Being the Ricardos.” But the story of “Lucy and Desi” goes far beyond the smash success of “I Love Lucy,” and that’s what got Lucie Arnaz — the daughter of the late Hollywood icons — thinking about doing something bigger. Arnaz has partnered with former NBC Entertainment and WarnerMedia Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt to develop what they envision as a three-season deep dive into the lives of Ball and Arnaz, from the couple’s separate tumultuous upbringings to making TV history with “I Love Lucy” — and then the clashes that led to their eventual divorce.\n\t\n\n\tArnaz and Greenblatt have recruited Oscar nominee and Emmy winner Richard LaGravenese (“The Fisher King,” “Behind the Candelabra”) to create the series, which will rely on source material including autobiographies written by Ball and Arnaz, the rights of which have reverted back to their estates. Greenblatt’s The Green Room and Arnaz’s Desilu, too shingles are behind the project, which will also be produced by Green Room content head Jon Wu.\n\n\n\t“If you’re really willing to look at the whole thing, there’s quite a story there, and a lot to be learned,” Arnaz said. “It’s very emotional, and it’s not what people think. It’s not just all about ‘I Love Lucy.'”\n\n\tArnaz and Greenblatt have put together a pitch deck for the series, with the working title “Lucy and Desi: The Greatest Story Never Told,” and plan to start meeting with networks and streamers in the coming months. The timing of the pitch comes as “I Love Lucy” celebrates its 75th anniversary in 2026 (the show debuted in October 1951) and on the heels of two new books exploring the couple: “Desi Arnaz, The Man Who Invented Television,” by Todd S. Purdum, and Arnaz’s own new look at her parents’ relationship, “Lucy & Desi: The Love Letters,” which she edited.\n\t\n\n\t“As we take it to buyers, there’s a version of this that could be 10 hours and done, if somebody wants to jump in with that,” Greenblatt said. “But we want to present it as a multi-season show. We think it’s three seasons of eight episodes. Obviously, we have to find the right buyer and cater to what they want to do. But it needs to have time to breathe. It really is an extraordinary story, from when they’re each teenagers in their separate worlds — one being Cuba as it’s coming apart at the seams, and one being very WASPy New York. They were both thrust out on their own, quickly at a young age, to try to figure out who they were and find their way in the business. Then they converge in 1940 on a soundstage at RKO, doing a movie together. ‘I Love Lucy’ is 11 years later, but that’s 11 years when they’re together in a marriage that’s up and down and complex.”\n\n\tArnaz and Greenblatt were inspired by the timeline of Netflix’s “The Crown” to similarly divide “Lucy and Desi” into different eras. In their pitch, Season 1, “From Cuba and Jamestown to New York and Hollywood,” would focus on 1930 to 1940; Season 2, “Family Life, B-Movies and Radio,” would span from 1940 to 1951; and Season 3, “The Ricardos Catch Fire, and Beyond,” would look at the “I Love Lucy” era, from 1951 to 1960 and more.\n\n\tIn partnering with LaGravenese (who most recently penned Paramount+’s upcoming “Unspeakable: The Murder of JonBenét Ramsey”) and not a comedy writer, Arnaz said it was important to explore some of the darker aspects of her parents’ relationship in addition to the good times. \n\n\t“The story is not all ha-ha. There’s a lot of sadness, there’s addiction, and there’s cheating, and there’s lots of fights for no reason,” she said. “There’s something to be learned from what they went through and how it’s not that easy to have it all… They had this wonderful legacy, which just happens to be the funniest show ever. But they’re more than that show. Their lives, individually and collectively, were very exciting and amazing and deep. Finding the right writer was hard because most people might think that, because we’re doing the story of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz that it’s going to be really funny. And it’s going to have great kinds of humor in it. But it’s not ‘I Love Lucy.’ It’s not a sitcom. Everybody says, ‘your father invented television,’ but in reality, that’s not at all what he was trying to do. They were just trying to stay together, and do a show.”\n\t\n\n\tArnaz and Greenblatt first collaborated when he produced a 40th anniversary reunion concert benefit for “They’re Playing Our Song,” the musical that served as her Broadway debut. Around the same time, Arnaz was an executive producer on “Being the Ricardos,” but ultimately that film focused mostly on one moment in time in the Lucy/Desi relationship — and so, Arnaz brought the idea of a much broader look at her parents to Greenblatt, and they started collaborating on what would become this series pitch.\n\n\t“Lucie has this ability to separate herself from being in the middle of it and really see it from an objective point of view,” Greenblatt said. “She’s the first person to say, ‘we want to do it warts and all, and we don’t want to just whitewash it and protect everybody.’ It really is complex. Can we get underneath the causes and the reasons for the way they were. We all think they’re the Ricardos. There’s a part of them that’s who they were, but that’s so little of the full picture.”\n\n\tLeGravenese entered the picture when Arnaz and Greenblatt went looking for somebody who could balance the comedy of “I Love Lucy” with the drama of what happened behind the scenes. \n\n\t“Richard came to mind, as he’s got this great background in writing feature films prominently for most of his life and more recently television,” Greenblatt said. “I love his ‘Behind the Candelabra’ movie, for which he won the Emmy. When we presented the idea to him, he just lit up. He’s like, ‘Oh my God, I’ve loved these two people as a fan, and I’ve gone down the rabbit hole on the internet many times.’ He just knew a lot about the story already. Then we all met, and Lucie met him, and he just felt like the right guy.” \n\n\tAdded Arnaz: “There’s been now two TV movies and a feature film and my documentary, but none of those other films ever looked at, ‘OK, that happened and that happened, but why? Why did he do that? Why did she respond that way?’ I wanted to correct that. If nothing else, I wanted to be able to look at them as people and say, ‘aren’t they interesting? Imagine, even with all that sorrow and all that loss, he was able to do this. And then he had to drink. Well, why did he have hookers? Why did that happen?’ And so if we can show the early and go all the way to the end, in some way, we might be able to help people understand them even more.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tTwo Democratic lawmakers — U.S. Reps. Sam Liccardo (D-Calif.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) — have expressed “serious national security concerns” over Paramount Skydance‘s hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\n\tLiccardo and Pressley sent a letter Wednesday to Warner Bros. Discovery president and CEO David Zaslav and members of WBD’s board of directors. They also sent a copy of the letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. (Read the full letter below.)\n\t\n\n\tA Paramount deal for WBD “could transfer substantial influence over one of the largest American media companies to foreign-backed financiers,” the U.S. representatives wrote.\n\n\n\tSpecifically, the U.S. representatives are concerned about Paramount’s takeover offer for WBD being backed by sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. The Saudi Public Investment Fund is controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. According to the representatives, “U.S. intelligence agencies have conclusively implicated Prince Salman in the brutal homicide of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, to suppress dissent.”\n\n\tLiccardo and Pressley also noted that Paramount’s bid for WBD is backed by Affinity Partners, the investment company formed by Jared Kushner, who is President Donald Trump’s son-in-law.\n\n\tThe lawmakers wrote that a future Democratic-controlled Congress or White House “will review many of the decisions of the current Administration, and may recommend that regulators push for divestitures, which would undermine the strategic logic of this merger.”\n\n\tReps for Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance declined to comment.\n\t\n\n\tOn Monday, David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance launched a direct-to-shareholders hostile takeover effort for WBD, with its most recent bid carrying an enterprise value of $108.4 billion. That came after Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery on Dec. 5 announced an $83.7 billion agreement, under which the streamer would buy WB’s studios, HBO, HBO Max and games divisions.\n\n\tSEE ALSO: How Netflix’s WB Megadeal Stunned Hollywood — and Sparked a Fight From David Ellison\n\n\tAccording to Paramount’s deal terms to acquire WBD, the three Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds (Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi) and Kushner’s Affinity Partners are backing the $30/share offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, along with David Ellison’s father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison; RedBird Capital Partners; and Apollo Global Management. \n\n\tBut the Arab wealth funds and Kushner’s Affinity “have agreed to forgo any governance rights — including board representation — associated with their non-voting equity investments,” Paramount said in an SEC filing. As such, the deal would not require review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the government entity tasked with oversight and investigation of foreign investment in U.S. companies, according to Paramount. In addition, Chinese internet company Tencent, which had previously committed $1 billion toward the WBD takeover deal, is no longer a financing partner.\n\n\tIn their letter, Liccardo and Pressley demanded that WBD file a notice with CFIUS if it proceeds with negotiations with Paramount “or any other buyer financed by foreign sovereign investors.” \n\n\t“CFIUS’s mandate is clear: The Committee evaluates how foreign investment could harm U.S. national security and seeks to address those risks,” the lawmakers wrote. “A transaction of this nature — combining a major media portfolio with foreign-backed capital — plainly warrants that scrutiny.” The lawmakers requested a response from Zaslav to their letter by Dec. 22, 2025.\n\n\t“As one of the most influential media companies in the world, Warner Bros. Discovery shapes America’s news, entertainment, and cultural content like few companies on the planet,” Liccardo said in a statement. “Equally important, the company has private financial and personal data of tens of millions of Americans. We cannot allow powerful — and brutal — foreign-backed investors access to this trove of personal data, and to obtain influence over our nation’s news ecosystem, without full scrutiny mandated by the law.”\n\t\n\n\t“Shareholders deserve a full accounting of the regulatory and reputational risks tied to this sale,” Liccardo said. “Anything less could lead to significant congressional oversight and forced divestitures under a future administration.”\n\n\tTrump has asserted that he will be involved in the U.S. government’s review of a deal for Warner Bros. When he was asked Monday at a White House briefing with reporters if he was in favor of Paramount’s rival bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, he responded, “I don’t know enough about it,” saying he has to look at how each proposed deal would impact Netflix and Paramount Skydance’s market. Trump added, “I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine. You know, I want to do what’s right.” Trump, asked if Kushner’s involvement in the Paramount bid would influence the president’s opinion, said, “I’ve never spoken with him” about Paramount’s WBD deal.\n\n\tTrump has been friendly with the Ellisons. But this week he lashed out at them over a “60 Minutes” interview with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) in a Truth Social post. The president fumed that since the Ellisons bought Paramount, parent of CBS, “60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!”\n\n\tRead the letter from Reps. Liccardo and Pressley:\n\n\tDavid ZaslavPresident and Chief Executive OfficerWarner Bros. Discovery230 Park Avenue SouthNew York, NY 10003\n\n\tDear Mr. Zaslav:\n\n\tWe write regarding recent reports that Paramount Skydance, supported by significant foreign investors, is pursuing a potential acquisition of Warner Brothers Discovery (“Warner”).\n\n\tThis transaction raises national security concerns because it could transfer substantial influence over one of the largest American media companies to foreign-backed financiers. If Warner proceeds with any transaction involving foreign sovereign or state-linked investors, we demand that the company immediately file a notice with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and submit the transaction for a full national security review.\n\n\tA merger of this scale, involving two of the nation’s most influential media companies, carries implications far beyond ordinary commercial consolidation. Warner’s platforms reach tens of millions of American households through HBO, Max, CNN, Warner Bros. Pictures, Discovery, and numerous digital and cable properties. They also shape the news, entertainment, and cultural content consumed by the American public. Any transaction providing foreign investors with governance rights, access to non-public data, or indirect influence over content distribution creates vulnerabilities that foreign governments could exploit.\n\t\n\n\tPublic reporting indicates that Paramount Skydance’s financing includes substantial foreign participation, including sovereign-wealth capital funds and investors with documented ties to foreign governments. These investors include Emirati and Qatari funds, as well as Affinity Partners, a private equity fund founded by Jared Kushner and backed by a $2 billion investment from the Saudi Public Investment Fund. The fund is controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom (according to the declassified 2021 report of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence) ordered the murder of U.S. resident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\tThese investors, by virtue of their financial position or contractual rights, could obtain influence — direct or indirect — over business decisions that bear upon editorial independence, content moderation, distribution priorities, or the stewardship of Americans’ private data. Even absent overt control, such influence can present a national-security threat when foreign state-linked entities have strategic interests inconsistent with those of the United States\n\n\tGiven these risks, Warner’s Board of Directors must treat this transaction not only as a commercial proposal but as a matter with substantial national security consequences. CFIUS’s mandate is clear: The Committee evaluates how foreign investment could harm U.S. national security and seeks to address those risks. A transaction of this nature — combining a major media portfolio with foreign-backed capital — plainly warrants that scrutiny. A failure to file with CFIUS when foreign investors may obtain control or meaningful contractual rights would represent a serious lapse in fiduciary judgment and could expose the company to significant regulatory and reputational harm.\n\n\tUnder Section 4565 of Title 50 of the U.S. Code, CFIUS jurisdiction to review acquisition of this nature arises under either of two grounds: a transaction which conveys “control” of the business to foreign actors, or an acquisition which could give non-controlling foreign entities access to Americans’ “sensitive personal data.”\n\n\tCFIUS regulations define “control” broadly, and the law does not require the acquisition of a majority interest in the US business. Rather, CFIUS concerns arise where a foreign actor’s minority interests confer a significant ability to influence “important matters” related to the US business. Alternatively, the law authorizes CFIUS review where foreign entities could obtain access to Americans’ “sensitive personal data,” including viewing histories, behavioral profiles, frequently used passwords, credit card and financial data, and personal device and location information.\n\t\n\n\tWe therefore expect that, should Warner pursue negotiations with Paramount Skydance or any other buyer financed by foreign sovereign investors, the company will file a voluntary notice with CFIUS prior to executing any binding agreement. Moreover, if CFIUS identifies risks requiring mitigation, we expect Warner to commit to implementing those measures in full and to inform shareholders, Congress, and the public of the steps taken to safeguard national security. Future Congresses, moreover, will review many of the decisions of the current Administration, and may recommend that regulators push for divestitures, which would undermine the strategic logic of this merger. We urge the Board to weigh these national security and regulatory liabilities in evaluating a transaction burdened by uncertain but potentially extensive mitigation obligations, foreign influence risks, or adverse regulatory action.\n\n\tThe American public relies on Warner’s platforms for news, entertainment, and vital information. Allowing foreign-backed investors to obtain influence over this ecosystem without the fullest possible scrutiny would be irresponsible and dangerous. As stewards of one of the nation’s most important media institutions, the Board of Directors has a responsibility to ensure that any potential transaction protects both national security and the long-term interests of Warner Bros. Discovery’s shareholders.\n\n\tThank you for your prompt attention to this matter. We respectfully request a response to this letter by December 22, 2025.\n\n\tSincerely,Sam T. LiccardoMember of CongressAyanna PressleyMember of CongressCC:Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., Chair of the BoardRichard W. Fisher, DirectorPaul A. Gould, DirectorDebra L. Lee, DirectorAnton J.

We don't know the context, but it's clear it involved D4vd, because he's a suspect in Celeste's death.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Morgenroth is way more than a G.M. -- he was also D4vd's day-to-day manager. Turns out, there were 2 managers. The other is Josh Marshall, who actually founded Mogul Vision and, along with Morgenroth, managed the singer's career.\n      \n    \n          You may remember Marshall ... he's the one who signed the lease on the house D4vd was living in -- the home police searched shortly after Celeste's body was discovered in D4vd's Tesla. Law enforcement sources say the house is an important piece of the puzzle, which the LAPD believes implicates D4vd in Celeste's death ... which police believe is a murder.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Morgenroth is also the President of Zara Brothers Travel, D4vd's tour company.\n      \n\n          TMZ broke the story ... Morgenroth walked out of the grand jury courtroom Monday and downloaded his lawyer, in a voice loud enough for people in the hallway to hear. Morgenroth, referring to the prosecutor in the grand jury room, said, \"She was very pushy on why I didn't call police.\" He went on to say ... \"I said I feel like I didn't have the responsibility to do that, and just wanted to continue with the tour.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          And there's another interesting twist. Late Tuesday afternoon, the prosecutor, Beth Silverman, went into a nearby courtroom along with Morgenroth and his lawyer. That courtroom is the same one where a judge was going to rule on whether to hold another witness in the Celeste Rivas grand jury in contempt. It's unclear why they went into this judge's courtroom, but it may well be the prosecutor is dissatisfied with Morgenroth's answers -- or lack thereof.\n      \n    \n          When they went into the courtroom, the judge told our reporter to leave, so we don't know what went down.\n      \n    \n          Morgenroth was back before the grand jury Wednesday morning.\n      \n      ",

    "body": "\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWelcome to Variety Awards HQ! Your weekly command center for the Oscars race.\n\n\tIt’s Dec. 8, 2025, and we’re deep in the thick of it. The past seven days have been a whirlwind of major awards season benchmarks, and if anyone thought this year’s race would follow a predictable script, they were proven wrong.\n\n\n\tThe Golden Globe nominations dropped Monday, marking a notably international and genre-diverse field, with Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” leading all films with nine nominations. Other top contenders included “Sentimental Value,” “Sinners,” “Marty Supreme” and “The Secret Agent,” while films like “Jay Kelly” and “Wicked: For Good” fell short in best picture (comedy), despite multiple nods.\n\t\n\n\tJust days prior, the Critics Choice Awards nominations added fuel to the fire, helping clarify which films are gaining real momentum. “Bugonia” snagged a surprise best picture nom, in addition to its star Emma Stone. At the same time, there were strong showings with acting nominations for Jacob Elordi (“Frankenstein”) and Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”) signaled real heat behind the performances.\n\n\n\tThen came the Los Angeles Film Critics Association on Sunday night, throwing a few calculated curveballs. Ethan Hawke picked up leading performance for “Blue Moon” alongside Rose Byrne’s work in “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” which brings her three of the “Big Four” critics awards, with the National Society of Film Critics still to come in January.\n\n\tThis week also brought major events across the circuit, from studio FYC screenings and Q&As to the early guild buzz already beginning to percolate. It’s been a week that sharpened the picture, and in some cases, rewrote it entirely.\n\t\n\n\tAs always, each week, we’ll deliver sharp analysis, exclusive interviews with key contenders (both above and below the line), and inside reads on the behind-the-scenes shifts affecting the race.\n\n\tWe’re always looking to spotlight unique angles, rising talent, and sharp on-the-ground reporting. Email me at cdavis@variety.com for submissions and coverage consideration.\n\n\tCatch up on the week’s top five events below.\n\t\n\t\tInside the NYC ‘Sinners’ Luncheon: A Starry Celebration In Soho\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn Dec. 2, Warner Bros. hosted an intimate luncheon at Manuela in Soho to celebrate Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners,” one of the season’s most closely watched awards contenders.\n\n\tThe event brought together an eclectic and powerful mix of filmmakers, actors, producers, and tastemakers for a day of conversation, connection and celebration of the film’s rising momentum.\n\n\tHosted just days before Golden Globe and Critics Choice nominations were announced, the luncheon functioned as both a quiet flex and a strategic push, reminding voters and influencers alike of the film’s cultural impact and deep creative bench.\n\n\tAmong the attendees were writer and director Ryan Coogler, star Michael B. Jordan, and co-star Delroy Lindo. Also present at the event were: Gayle King, Laverne Cox, Phylicia Rashad, Shaka King, Julie Dash, Elegance Bratton, and Barbara Broccoli.\n\n\tOther notable guests included Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy, Todd Komarnicki, Stella Meghie, Omar Benson Miller, Marsha Stephanie Blake, and comedian Hannibal Buress.\n\n\tThe room also included several award-winning filmmakers and Academy members such as Dee Rees, J.C. Chandor, and Lisa Cortés, as well as casting director Francine Maisler and composer Jon Batiste.\n\t\n\t\tReba McEntire Hosts Starry ‘Song Sung Blue’ Event at DGA\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHugh Jackman, Reba McEntire, Kate Hudson and Craig Brewer seen at a special screening of ‘Song Sung Blue’ \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFocus Features via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn Dec. 7, Focus Features teamed up with country music icon Reba McEntire to host a special screening of “Song Sung Blue” at the Directors Guild of America in Los Angeles.\n\n\tThe event was part of the ongoing awards push for Craig Brewer’s musical drama, which has been building strong word of mouth the past few weeks.\n\n\tThe evening drew a packed house of Academy members, DGA voters, and industry insiders, with representation from major agencies including WME. Following the screening, McEntire introduced a lively and heartfelt Q&A featuring director/writer/producer Craig Brewer alongside stars Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson.\n\n\t“Song Sung Blue” has been quietly emerging as one of the season’s sleeper contenders, particularly for Hudson, whose performance has been singled out in recent screenings, and just garnered a Golden Globe nom for best actress (comedy).\n\t\n\t\tCharlize Theron Joins Baz Luhrmann for ‘Wicked: For Good’ Celebration in L.A.\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMiranda McDonald\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn Dec. 2, Baz Luhrmann hosted a special celebration for Universal Pictures’ “Wicked: For Good,” featuring a live performance and reception in Los Angeles. The event, part of the studio’s ongoing awards season campaign, highlighted the film’s original music and showcased its ensemble cast. Among the notable attendees was Charlize Theron, adding star power to the evening. The celebration drew industry voters, guild members, and creatives for a night honoring the musical’s achievements. As “Wicked: For Good” builds momentum this season, the Luhrmann-led event served as a stylish reminder of the film’s artistic and cultural impact.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDocumentary Oscar Hopeful ‘Predators’ Gains Awards Momentum\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter premiering at Sundance 2025 to widespread acclaim, “Predators” has steadily emerged as one of the year’s top documentary contenders. Directed by David Osit and distributed by MTV Documentary Films, whose recent Oscar track record includes “Ascension,” “The Eternal Memory,” and “Black Box Diaries,” the film has built momentum through the fall season.\n\n\tCurrently boasting a 98% Certified Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, “Predators” has resonated with critics and audiences alike across its theatrical run in over 35 markets.\n\n\tWith support building from both critics and the documentary branch, “Predators” is positioning itself as a dark horse contender in a competitive nonfiction field this awards season.\n\t\n\t\t‘Sentimental Value’ Ramps Up Awards Season Presence With Tastemaker Events in L.A. and NYC\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStephanie Augello\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJoachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” continued to solidify its status as a major awards season contender with a series of high-profile screenings and Q&As this past week, drawing enthusiastic support from voters according to sources and attendees.\n\n\tOn Dec. 1, the Directors Guild of America hosted a packed screening followed by a thoughtful conversation between Trier and editor Olivier Bugge Coutté, moderated by Judd Apatow.\n\n\tThe campaign continued in New York on Dec. 3, where the “Sentimental Value” team held a tastemaker screening at iPic Fulton for Academy members. Trier was joined by stars Stellan Skarsgård, Renate Reinsve and Elle Fanning. Academy Award winner Sofia Coppola (“Lost in Translation”) introduced the screening, adding an extra layer of prestige and support.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron revealed in an interview with Discussing Film that he received pushback from the studio when he decided to expand the number of “Avatar” sequels from three films to four. After the record-breaking success of the original “Avatar” in 2009, Cameron assembled a writer’s room to begin developing the continuation of a story across three sequels.\n\n\t“We were working on three scripts and then it turned into four. Two got split into two and three,” Cameron said about his decision to split what was the original script for “Avatar: The Way of Water” into both “The Way of Water” and a new third movie, “Fire and Ash.” The decision meant that what was planned to be the third “Avatar” movie would now be the fourth, bringing the total number of films in the franchise to five.\n\t\n\n\t“I actually got a fair bit of pushback from the studio,” Cameron said. “My counterargument was, ‘Wait a minute. What part of you getting another chance to make $2 billion is in question here?'”\n\n\n\tThe original “Avatar” remains the highest-grossing movie in history (unadjusted for inflation) with $2.9 billion. Cameron knew what he was talking about with his counterargument to the studio as 2022’s “The Way of Water” grossed $2.3 billion to become the third highest-grosser in history. Now the pressure is on for “Fire and Ash” to cross the $2 billion mark at the worldwide box office later this month.\n\n\tCameron previously revealed that he’s already shot footage for “Avatar 4,” but going back to finish the next sequel and continue into “Avatar 5” will all depend on the success of “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Speaking to Collider in 2022, the filmmaker revealed that the “Avatar 4” script was the first “Avatar” sequel not to receive a single note from studio executives.\n\t\n\n\t“I can’t tell you the details, but all I can say is that when I turned in the script for [‘The Way of Water’], the studio gave me three pages of notes,” Cameron said. “And when I turned in the script for 3, they gave me a page of notes, so I was getting better. When I turned in the script for 4, the studio executive, the creative executive over the films, wrote me an email that said, ‘Holy fuck.’ And I said, ‘Well, where are the notes?’ And she said, ‘Those are the notes.’ Because it kind of goes nuts in a good way, right?”\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” opens in theaters Dec. 19.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\tFreddy Fazbear and his friends have done it again.\n\n\tThe bloodthirsty animatronics beckoned enough franchise fans to theaters to make “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” a box office hit this weekend. The film’s ending — complete with a mid-credits scene, an end-credits scene and a handful of cliffhangers — is already encouraging plenty of debate and analysis online.\n\t\n\n\tEmma Tammi, who directed both films in the series, spoke with Variety about the series’ next steps. During this film’s mid-credits scene, Springtrap — the antagonistic animatronic from the game “Five Nights at Freddy’s 3” — is seen booting up. It’s implied that the spirit of William Afton (Matthew Lillard), the co-founder of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, now controls the device.\n\n\n\tTammi said that she and screenwriter Scott Cawthon (who also created the games) planned to bring the villain back for a third movie, after he makes a cameo in the visions of his daughter Vanessa Shelly (Elizabeth Lail) in “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2.”\n\n\t“We end Movie One with him being dragged off, and the idea was always that he would be teed up at the end of Movie Two for a third film, should we be fortunate enough to make one,” Tammi said. “That really links to where Movie Three and Game Three enter the scene. We get these great glimpses of William Afton throughout this film that are really more through the lens of Vanessa and her memories and PTSD from her relationship with him. To then get a glimpse towards the end of what he is now becoming and has become, when the assumption is, at least from our characters within the film, that he’s dead … it’s just such a great way to bring it back to Afton.”\n\t\n\n\tYet Springtrap wasn’t the final moment in the film. Instead, we hear grieving father Henry Emily (Skeet Ulrich) leave a message for Mike (Josh Hutcherson) in which he reveals he was business partners with William at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, and warns him to avoid the Marionette, which has been taken over by his dead daughter’s soul.\n\n\t“That was inspired by some of the tape recordings from the game,” Tammi said. “It was a mishmash also of picking up the Marionette at the end, as it intersects with Henry, and certainly as he’s reaching out to Mike. This film is really an introduction to Henry, without going too deep into his backstory. That recording felt like the perfect tease to nod our hat to the fact that we would be going deeper with him in a third film.”\n\n\tAlso exciting is the fact that Ulrich and Lillard might be onscreen together if the third installment is made. Notably, the pair made a splash in 1996’s “Scream,” where they played the deadly duo posing as Ghostface.\n\n\t“Once [Ulrich’s] name was brought up for the first time, it just clicked so hard, and we all got so excited about it,” Tammi said. “I think every crew member who started catching wind that this was something that was going to happen had such an overwhelmingly excited response. It was an across-the-board validation for how cool this was going to be, and how well-received that reunion was going to be.”\n\n\tUltimately, despite the film’s emphasis on killer robots and a dense backstory, Tammi is proud to bring audiences human stories that fans can love as well.\n\n\t“I think our human characters are as important as our animatronic characters, and as important as the lore,” she said. “For me, they all hold equal weight. I would absolutely want to continue that moving forward.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump said he’s withholding judgment about whether Paramount Skydance‘s hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery or Netflix‘s deal with WBD should prevail. \n\n\tAt a White House briefing with reporters Monday, Trump was asked if he supports Paramount’s takeover bid for WBD. The president responded, “I don’t know enough about it. I know the companies very well. I know what they are doing. But I have to see. I have to see what percentage of market [share] they have. We have to see the Netflix percentage of market [share], Paramount percentage of market [share]. I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine. You know, I want to do what’s right. It’s so very important to do what’s right.”\n\t\n\n\tTrump’s comments came just hours after David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance launched a direct-to-shareholders hostile takeover effort for WBD, offering $30 per share in an offer with an enterprise value of $108.4 billion. That came after Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery announced an $83.7 billion agreement, under which the streamer would buy WB’s studios, HBO, HBO Max and games divisions.\n\n\n\tParamount’s all-cash offer is backed by Larry Ellison, the wealthy father of Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison; RedBird Capital Partners; the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi; and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners investment company. Kushner is Donald Trump’s son-in-law, married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka.\n\n\tTrump, asked if Kushner’s involvement in the Paramount bid would affect the president’s opinion, said, “I’ve never spoken with him” about Paramount’s WBD deal.\n\t\n\n\tTrump, who has exerted control over federal agencies, said he will be participating in the government review of the Netflix-WB deal.\n\n\tOn Sunday, standing on the red carpet for the Kennedy Center Honors, Trump declared that “I’ll be involved” the decision about whether of not to approve the Netflix-WB deal. According to Trump, Sarandos visited the Oval Office last week. During the meeting, the Netflix co-CEO was seeking to reassure the president that his company would not amass anything close to monopoly power — and that other media conglomerates would still be bigger than Netflix together with WB and HBO Max. \n\n\tSarandos is “a fantastic man,” Trump said at the Kennedy Center. “I have a lot of respect for him, but it’s a lot of market share” that Netflix would amass if it owned Warner Bros. and HBO Max. Trump added: “It could be a problem.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, Trump has been friendly with the Ellisons — “They’re big supporters of mine,” he has boasted — and the president publicly praised David Ellison, saying “he’ll do a great job” as CEO of the merged Skydance Media-Paramount. The Ellisons surely have been bending his ear in trying to persuade him to oppose Netflix’s WB gambit on anticompetitive grounds. \n\n\tBut on Monday morning, Trump lashed out at the Ellisons over this week’s “60 Minutes” segment with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, once an ardent Trump supporter who has earned the president’s displeasure after she criticized his handling of the government shutdown and other issues including the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\n\t“Marjorie is not AMERICA FIRST or MAGA, because nobody could have changed her views so fast, and her new views are those of a very dumb person,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social account. “That was proven last night when washed up, Trump hating, 60 Minutes ‘correspondent,’ Lesley Stahl, who still owes me an apology from when she attacked me on the show (with serious conviction!), that Hunter Biden’s LAPTOP FROM HELL was produced by Russia, not Hunter himself (TOTALLY PROVEN WRONG!), interviewed a very poorly prepared Traitor, who in her confusion made many really stupid statements.”\n\n\tTrump continued: “My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low IQ traitor, it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP” — and he opined that since the Ellisons bought the company, “60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!”\n\t\n\n\tTrump pointed out that Paramount Global, seeking to close its deal with Skydance Media, this summer paid the president $16 million to settle his lawsuit over a previous “60 Minutes” segment. Trump’s lawsuit accused the venerable CBS News program of deceptively editing a pre-election interview with Kamala Harris, thereby inflicting harm on Trump personally and allegedly interfering with the 2024 election. Paramount and CBS had called the suit meritless and moved to have it thrown out, but Paramount Global — at the behest of former controlling shareholder Shari Redstone — eventually reached a deal paying Trump to settle it.\n\n\tTrump’s opposition to either deal wouldn’t necessarily doom its chances of getting regulatory approval. During Trump’s first term, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner on antitrust grounds; the move was reportedly motivated by Trump’s hatred of CNN. A federal judge ruled in favor of the companies and in February 2019 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCAPE (Coalition of Asian Pacifics in Entertainment) and The Asian American Foundation (TAAF) named Beth de Araújo and Ravi Kapoor as the inaugural recipients of the 2025 Rising Filmmakers Finishing Fund.\n\n\tThe writer-directors will receive post-production grants of $50,000 each to complete their features “Josephine” and “Patel,” respectively. \n\n\tThe grantees will also receive networking opportunities through CAPE and TAAF’s networks, as well as Filmmaker Pro Memberships from Film Independent.\n\t\n\n\tThe Rising Filmmakers Finishing Fund, launched by CAPE and TAAF in Jan. 2025, aims to support the career longevity of Asian American and Pacific Islander filmmakers as demand for authentic AAPI stories grows. To qualify for the grants, applicants were required to submit live-action narrative feature film projects at least 90% through principal photography or in post-production. The project must also have been an applicant’s second, third, fourth, or fifth feature film.\n\n\n\t“In light of the precipitous decline in funding support after a debut feature, CAPE is proud to partner with TAAF on the only funding opportunity of its kind that invests in sustaining filmmakers’ careers by supporting their second through fifth feature films,” said Michelle K. Sugihara, executive director & CEO of CAPE. “Both Beth de Araújo and Ravi Kapoor are talented storytellers with strong voices. Josephine and Patel could not be more different and they are important additions to the canon of Asian American storytelling.”\n\n\t“We’ve seen unprecedented audience demand for more nuanced Asian American and Pacific Islander stories, and with it, incredible opportunities to invest in directors working to capture the full humanity of our community,” said Norman Chen, CEO of TAAF. “TAAF is proud to support Beth de Araújo and Ravi Kapoor through the Rising Filmmakers Finishing Fund. We believe in championing talented artists at all stages, and hope that programs like this can help grow and sustain their long-term careers.”\n\t\n\n\tAraújo featured in Filmmaker Magazine’s 25 New Faces of Independent Film and was nominated for the 2022 Gotham Bingham Ray breakthrough director award for her debut film, “Soft & Quiet.” Her short film, based on her Gawker essay of the same name, “I Want To Marry A Creative Jewish Girl,” won best screenplay at Hollyshorts Film Festival.\n\n\tHer film “Josephine” follows an 8-year-old who accidentally witnesses a crime in Golden Gate Park. She acts out in search of a way to regain control of her safety, while adults are helpless to console her.The cast includes Mason Lily Reeves, Gemma Chan, Channing Tatum, Phillip Ettinger and Syra McCarthy.\n\n\tKapoor is an L.A. based writer-director-actor. He wrote and directed the feature film “Four Samosas,” a quirky heist comedy set in L.A.’s Little India which premiered at Tribeca and was picked up for distribution by IFC.\n\n\t“Patel” is a deadpan gangster tragedy based on “Macbeth,” set in the world of Indian American motel owners in the 90s, that asks: how big should an immigrant dream? The logline describes it as Wes Anderson meets Scorsese meets Shakespeare.\n\n\tUtkarsh Ambudkar, Richa Moorjani, Kal Penn, Kunal Nayyar, Meera Simhan, Danny Pudi, Nik Dodani, Rizwan Manji and Pete Holmes are all set to star in the film.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt the end of “Wicked,” Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba leaps out of the Emerald City palace window in her velvet cape with her hat, and she flies off on her broom.\n\n\t“That is the moment where she embraces her power,” says the film’s costume designer, Paul Tazewell.\n\n\tIn the film’s conclusion, “Wicked: For Good,” the community of Oz has made Elphaba into the villain, falling for the propaganda churned by Madam Morrible (Michelle Yeoh). Glinda (Ariana Grande) has become a pawn in Morrible’s plans. Elphaba has been forced into exile.\n\t\n\n\tTazewell leaned into the idea of repurposing and deconstructing looks that she had previously worn. Because the film was a continuation of the same story, he didn’t want anything to feel brand new. To keep that continuity, Tazewell says, “The dress that was her very best dress that she wears to meet the wizard deteriorates into a tunic that she then matches with trousers that we’ve seen her in at Shiz.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWith Elphaba wearing trousers under her tunic, she’s allowed to move more freely throughout Oz. Her sweeping coat has also been upcycled from a previous look. “It’s the trench coat that she carries with her into the forest when she’s with Fiyero, when they’re taking the cub back into the forest,” he says.\n\n\tTazewell says the coat was a wax linen that creates an organic quality. He then manipulated the fabric to give it “this wet bark feel.” The whole idea is rooted in the first film, in which her clothes aren’t just organic — they connect her to the forest and nature.\n\n\tHer hat has also expanded, with the brim becoming bigger and the tip longer, while her shoulders are bolder. All the subtle details within Elphaba’s silhouette are infused with symbolism to show her growth and power as she fights back against the Wizard and she becomes the Wicked Witch of the West.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLara Cornell\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen “For Good” opens, audiences see the superhero she has become. “It’s self-created completely,” Tazewell explains.\n\n\tProduction designer Nathan Crowley gave Elphaba’s nest a loom, which supports the narrative that she can create and transform her clothing.\n\n\tGlinda, who has now has fully immersed herself in the Wizard’s propaganda machine, is living an idyllic life. “It’s a princess in a tower, and she is wearing clothes that are true to that,” Tazewell says, adding that she is a woman “completely embedded in the culture of Emerald City, and wants to impress.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPaul Tazewell wove elements of Audrey Hepburn into Glinda’s looks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGiles Keyte/Universal Pictures\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHer style has elements of Audrey Hepburn; “It feels very glamorous and elegant,” Tazewell says. The one dress he found tricky to design was Glinda’s wedding dress. It needed to reflect all of the above and be magical. Her dress was multi-layered, made from organza and silk tulle. The main dress was made from silk satin, which was embellished with swirls of butterflies.\n\n\tGiven this was a huge moment for Glinda and the citizens of Oz, Tazewell made a 25-meter veil. A crystallized tiara, which comprises a collection of interlocking butterflies, completes the look. He explains, “It’s about the presentation of her coming into the hall of grandiosity,” and as she walks toward a waiting Fiyero, “she’s parting all of these golden butterflies that are sitting on the aisle. They fly up and become the atmosphere of her wedding dress.” He adds, “Collectively, it becomes this very theatrical moment.”\n\n\tHer iconic bubble dress as seen in the first film nods to Billie Burke’s “The Wizard of Oz” pink dress. The dress has bubble patterns and swirls and lean into her journey in becoming Glinda the Good.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrom comics to live-action TV to animation, the satirical superhero universe of “The Boys” has conquered multiple mediums and is now about to cross over into uncharted territory: its own video game.\n\n\tBased on the comic book series of the same name, Amazon’s “The Boys” TV series is being adapted into a stealth-action VR game by Brazilian game studio Arvore and published by Sony Pictures Virtual Reality. Titled “The Boys: Trigger Warning,” the game is set to launch in 2026 and is now available to pre-order at a promotional price of $23.99 USD on the Meta Quest storefront and to wishlist on the PlayStation Store.\n\t\n\n\tPer the game’s description, “The Boys: Trigger Warning” “introduces an original character who accidentally uncovers a grotesque Vought secret that turns a family outing into carnage. Forced to become a Supe, the player joins The Boys to infiltrate Vought and take revenge in the most chaotic way possible. Blending stealth and combat with the franchise’s signature dark humor, the VR title delivers a new story rooted in the world fans love.”\n\n\n\t“Trigger Warning” was created in collaboration with “The Boys” TV series creator and showrunner Eric Kripke and will feature some of series cast members reprising their roles, including Laz Alonso as Mother’s Milk, Colby Minifie as Ashley Barrett and P.J. Byrne as Adam Bourke, as well as Jensen Ackles appearing as a “twisted interpretation of Soldier Boy, created exclusively for the game,” per the developers.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Boys: Trigger Warning”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhile “The Boys” has been incorporated into other video games — Antony Starr’s Homelander character appeared in “Mortal Kombat 1” — this will mark the first-ever game built entirely around “The Boys” universe. \n\t\n\n\t“We lean into everything fans expect from ‘The Boys,’ and we worked closely with the producers of the show to bring that tone into the game,” Arvore CEO and founder Ricardo Justus told Variety. “The show’s characteristic violence feels even more absurd and physical here because VR puts you right in the middle of it. And beyond the surface interactions, the game has a strong narrative element that places you in the shoes of someone who actually suffers the consequences of Vought’s actions. We also built a lot of environmental storytelling into the experience. As you explore, you find layers of humor, social commentary, and visual easter eggs that echo the show’s satirical voice. That world comes to life even more with many of the original actors reprising their roles, which gives the scenes an authenticity and energy fans will recognize immediately. The mix of chaos, moral tension, dark humor, and spectacle is what makes ‘The Boys’ unique, and that is exactly what makes it so fun to translate into VR.”\n\n\tCreative director Ricardo Laganaro said the collaborative process on “The Boys: Trigger Warning” “became much deeper than we initially expected” in large part due to the fact “The Boys” series creator and showrunner Eric Kripke and his writing team “embraced a true creative partnership” with the game studio.\n\n\t“From the earliest story discussions, we built a relationship of trust that let us go far beyond the typical approval process in licensed games,” Laganaro said. “They did not just review ideas; they helped shape characters and scenes with us, and even wrote dialogue, which made the story genuinely feel like it belonged within ‘The Boys’ universe. That trust also gave us room to introduce new characters and original antagonists in ways that still felt true to the world, and it allowed us to create meaningful interactions with the show’s iconic characters, always with guidance from the series writers to keep every moment authentic. And on top of that, they shared extensive production design materials from the show, which helped us bring locations such as The Seven’s conference room and Voughtland to life with great accuracy, while still giving fans the freedom to explore them in ways only a VR experience can reveal.”\n\n\tThe announcement of “The Boys: Trigger Warning” comes on the heels of Amazon’s reveal of an April 8 premiere date for the fifth and final season of “The Boys.” Hailing from Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios, “The Boys” TV franchise consists of the main series, as well as spinoffs “Gen V,” “The Boys Presents: Diabolical,” the upcoming prequel “Vought Rising” and a still-in-development Mexico-set show.\n\t\n\n\t“We’re thrilled to work with Arvore to bring ‘The Boys: Trigger Warning’ to life in VR,” Sony Pictures Entertainment senior vice president Lance Sloane said. “Having the show’s creators involved in shaping the experience allows us to push the boundaries of immersive storytelling, and we’re grateful to collaborate with our friends at Meta and PlayStation to deliver it to fans.”\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “The Boys: Trigger Warning” via the video below.\n\n\n\n\n\tSee below for more from Variety‘s conversation with Arvore’s Ricardo Justus and “Trigger Warning” creative director Ricardo Laganaro.\n\t\n\t\tHow did the decision to make the first “The Boys” video game be a VR game come about?\t\n\n\tJustus: Almost three years ago, we at Arvore were experimenting with different prototypes that explored how to let players use superpowers in VR in a natural way that actually felt empowering. Everyone at the studio is a fan of “The Boys,” and the more we played with those prototypes, the more it became clear that the world of the show would be an ideal match. “The Boys” mixes power fantasy with tension and dark humor, and VR gives you the chance to experience all of that from inside the chaos. It is not just watching a Supe blow up a room, it is being there with your hands up while everything goes wrong.\n\n\tAt the same time, Sony Pictures Virtual Reality had already been exploring how to bring some of its biggest franchises into immersive formats, including “The Boys,” and Arvore had already been identified as a strong potential partner because of our VR expertise and shared creative vision. Once we shared our prototypes with them, it was clear that our work and their vision clicked. That started a very collaborative process, and over several months, we refined the concept together with Sony, Meta, PlayStation and the producers of the show. The project was really born from that close collaboration.\n\n\tLaganaro: What excited us from the beginning was the idea that superpowers in VR could feel truly physical, not symbolic or animated, but something the player performs with their own body. That immediately opened a narrative door for us, and we started imagining a world where powers were not just visual effects, but actions the player embodies, with all the chaos and responsibility that come with it in this world. So, before “The Boys” was even on the table, we were developing a dark, critical parody of superhero culture, and because we were not tied to any existing universe, we could experiment freely on a tonal, mechanical and narrative level. And inside those early prototypes, something interesting happened: several people on the team said, “This feels like it could exist in ‘The Boys.’” So, when we finally showed Sony Pictures Virtual Reality a rough version of what we were doing, the connection was immediate. The tone, the mechanics, the irreverence — they all lined up with the DNA of the show.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow much input was there from “The Boys” producers and Amazon on what the game would include?\t\n\n\tJustus: The collaboration with the show’s producers and creator was very close, and they were directly involved throughout the project. They trusted us to build something bold, and at the same time, they guided us on tone, character authenticity, and what truly feels like “The Boys.” We set out to tell a new story that runs in parallel with the events of the show, mixing new characters created for the game with fan favorites. From the start, we aligned with the producers on the major story beats, how each character would fit into the plot, and the overall spirit of the powers. The show’s writers helped bring the dialogue to life, working with us to write and refine many scenes, ensuring that every character sounded true to the show. They collaborated directly with our narrative design team throughout the project. They also gave us the space to push ideas that made sense for gameplay and stepped in whenever something needed to stay anchored to the show’s identity. It has been a very open and genuinely rewarding partnership.\n\n\tLaganaro: The collaboration became much deeper than we initially expected, largely because Eric Kripke and his writing team embraced a true creative partnership. From the earliest story discussions, we built a relationship of trust that let us go far beyond the typical approval process in licensed games. They did not just review ideas; they helped shape characters and scenes with us, and even wrote dialogue, which made the story genuinely feel like it belonged within “The Boys” universe. That trust also gave us room to introduce new characters and original antagonists in ways that still felt true to the world, and it allowed us to create meaningful interactions with the show’s iconic characters, always with guidance from the series writers to keep every moment authentic. And on top of that, they shared extensive production design materials from the show, which helped us bring locations such as The Seven’s conference room and Voughtland to life with great accuracy, while still giving fans the freedom to explore them in ways only a VR experience can reveal.\n\t\n\t\tThe tone of “The Boys” is very specific — satirical, violent, explicit, humorous, thought-provoking, political. Can you tease how the tone will be captured in the game?\t\n\n\tJustus: We lean into everything fans expect from “The Boys,” and we worked closely with the producers of the show to bring that tone into the game. The show’s characteristic violence feels even more absurd and physical here because VR puts you right in the middle of it. And beyond the surface interactions, the game has a strong narrative element that places you in the shoes of someone who actually suffers the consequences of Vought’s actions. We also built a lot of environmental storytelling into the experience. As you explore, you find layers of humor, social commentary and visual easter eggs that echo the show’s satirical voice. That world comes to life even more with many of the original actors reprising their roles, which gives the scenes an authenticity and energy fans will recognize immediately. The mix of chaos, moral tension, dark humor and spectacle is what makes “The Boys” unique, and that is exactly what makes it so fun to translate into VR.\n\t\n\n\tLaganaro: One of the ways we bring “The Boys” tone into a video game is by making sure the satire, the violence, the explicit moments and the dark humor are not just things the player watches, but things the player actually does. If in cinema we say “show, don’t tell,” in our case it becomes “play, don’t show.” So, if you are surrounded by guards in combat and your power is telekinesis, the question becomes: why simply shoot at them when you can tear off a limb and use it as improvised ammunition? The same goes for presence. VR lets us put players in situations they cannot look away from, so in the first minutes of the game, you witness a grotesque secret about our antagonists inside Vought in a way that hits you viscerally. And when it comes to “The Boys” signature blend of brutality and absurdity, we even built one of the game’s most violent moments inside a childish, propaganda-filled amusement ride inspired by characters fans will immediately recognize from the show. Our goal was always to capture the tone not by imitating the series, but by translating its spirit into actions only a game, and especially a VR game, can deliver.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn the final scene of Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners,” an aged Sammie Moore (Buddy Guy) sits at a blues venue bar when Elias “Stack” Moore (Michael B. Jordan) and Mary (Hailee Steinfeld) stroll in, frozen in time and looking like the day they were turned to vampires. As they get up to leave, Sammie stops them to land the film’s final emotional punch: “Maybe once a week I wake up paralyzed reliving that night. But before the sun went down, I think that was the best day of my life. Was it like that for you?” he asks.\n\t\n\n\t“No doubt about it,” responds Stack. “Last time I seen my brother. Last time I seen the sun. And just for a few hours, we was free.”\n\n\n\tAmid the scene swells the opening strings of “Last Time (I Seen the Sun),” the closing credits song for “Sinners” performed by Miles Caton (who plays a young Sammie) and Alice Smith. Co-written with Ludwig Göransson, “Last Time” was directly inspired by the dialogue between the characters and came together in just a couple of hours. “It jumped right out,” Smith tells Variety of the lines that galvanized the tune, a hopeful yet reflective ballad in a Blues tradition.\n\n\t“Last Time” was one of two “Sinners” songs submitted for consideration in the original song category at the Oscars alongside “I Lied to You,” co-written by Raphael Saadiq and Göransson and performed by Caton. For Smith, it’s the latest in a career powered by soulful solo records including her Grammy-nominated 2006 debut “For Lovers, Dreamers and Me” and her latest, 2019’s “Mystery.” Over the past few years, Smith has branched out to contribute music to visual media including last year’s “The Book of Clarence” soundtrack, “Reasonable Doubt” and “Underground.”\n\t\n\n\tSmith speaks with Variety about how “Last Time (I Seen the Sun)” came together, working with Göransson and Caton, and what she has in store for her next solo record.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you first get involved in writing and performing a song for “Sinners?”\t\n\n\tI got an email from Ludwig, and he said that he was a fan of mine. Turns out he had been a of mine for 15 years or something, since my first album. He said he was working on this project and asked if I would come and work on a song or see what would happen. When I got there, Miles was there, but [Ludwig] already had the string part. I knew his name, but I didn’t know the magnitude. You get the emails and the so and so says such and such. And you’re like, okay, let me check. And I was like, oh. Right. Yeah, I’ll be over.\n\t\n\t\tMiles was talking about how the line from the last scene that inspired the song really jumped out. Did you all watch the movie together?\t\n\n\tAt that point we watched some little bits to give me kind of an idea of what was going on. And then, yes, he played the scene that the song would be in and that string thing comes in, it’s so gorgeous and it literally took me to a particular visual.\n\t\n\t\tSo you collectively agreed that those lines were emblematic of what you were trying to do.\t\n\n\tYeah, what it’s about.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you collaborate in the session?\t\n\n\tIt was very quick. It’s one of those things where you know something is supposed to happen because it’s so easy. It just falls. Everything just goes along. Got there, they had the strings, the strings were so gorgeous. I was like, oh God. I had a scene in my head, a place in my head, which is basically my grandmother’s place, which is like a farm in Georgia. And the particular time of day, it made me think of the mornings there. And then of course, that scene is basically the movie, too. There’s a big connection, pastoral kind of scenes. The south farm scene. We were just like, okay, well, let’s just sit and write.\n\n\tI wrote some stuff that I sang and Miles wrote his part that he sang. The piece was already there, whatever the format that it was in. We did a couple of little spacing things that Ludwig adjusted and changed around for us. We basically wrote all the lyrics, me and Miles, which of course, he was there the whole time. But I will say that when we finished the song, and it was such a joy because Miles is such a joy. He’s just very present and professional and young and everything. It just went together so well and then we were able to sing it so easily. At the end of the day, we probably took an hour or a couple hours to do the whole thing.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t“Last Time (I Seen the Sun)” is rooted in the Blues tradition. Did you find yourself immediately connecting with the musical aspect of it from your own experience?\t\n\n\tOf course. The blues is so natural that it’s almost like I… not I overlook it, but I kind of take it for granted. I never spent a lot of time on it, studying it or anything like the guys did. Having the Southern roots is really just a part of who I am or what I am or what I come from. It’s like a thing that always informed my thing, maybe even more leaning towards like the gospel-y, the spiritual, that side of the thing. It’s very easy. It’s so deeply ingrained in my history, in my personal life. I grew up with a gospel band rehearsing in my grandmother’s house. So it’s kind of like the root of certainly my singing, if not my singing style.\n\t\n\t\tHow was it hearing the song in the context of the finished film?\t\n\n\tI thought it was crazy. You could tell that song was supposed to be just the way it came out. Because the way it sat in there, the timing… I mean, we didn’t do the timing. I don’t know, maybe Ludwig went back in. I’m sure actually that when they edited, they did whatever. But it just sat in the scene perfectly where it sat. And then it shows them driving through those fields. And I was like, this is like the same thing in my mind, you know? And the lighting and the whole thing, it felt like such a perfectly placed song.\n\t\n\t\tSince your last project, you’ve focused more on doing music for soundtracks. How has it been writing music that’s particularly for a visual medium?\t\n\n\tSo much easier. It’s a fucking dream. I’ve been doing some installation art stuff. I did a couple of pieces, finished my second piece with Isaac Julian, which is really amazing. I did some stuff for Cauleen Smith. And I got a couple other things that I’m working on for people. I think the hardest part of writing the song is like, what’s it about? Like I start writing and it’s a melody and then it’s some words that just come out of the melody, but then you have to really figure out what it’s about. What are you really trying to say?That’s the hardest part for me. The interfering that you can do is kind of cut out because it’s somebody else’s vision. And you don’t have to, guesswork. At that point, it’s just sit here and let it come down, you know what I mean?\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAre you working on another solo project?\t\n\n\tYes. I actually even have a deadline, which is massive. I’m working on something that I’m hoping to be certainly done with top of the year, end of the year, top of the year, next few months. I’m hoping to be like, have the stuff then figure out when the best time to put it out. Hopefully I’ll put something out, even if it’s just one song around January, February.\n",

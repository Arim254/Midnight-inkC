    "body": "\n\tLondon’s Women and the World International Film Festival wraps its second edition Nov. 12 with Scarlett Johansson‘s first feature as director, “Eleanor the Great.” \n\n\tStar Erin Kellyman will participate in a post-screening Q&A in partnership with Sony Pictures Classics and led by Victoria Emslie, the British actor-producer behind Primetime who also sits on the festival jury.\n\n\t“The film invites us to confront and sit in the messiness of loneliness, both in the present moment and through an intergenerational lens; and challenges the perceived risks of connection by letting ourselves be truly seen and known by others,” Emslie said. “In an increasingly polarised and unpredictable world, one of the most effective way to remedy and alleviate both the individual and collective fear and scarcity is to come together in community, which is why WWIFF has ripple effects beyond the festival itself.”\n\t\n\n\tOther jury members include screenwriter Peter Straughan (“Conclave,” “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy”), actors Daniel Ings (“The Crown”), Tamara Lawrance (“The Silent Twins”), Diem Camille (“Alien”) and festival co-founder Ksenia Bugrimova.\n\n\n\tCompetition categories span documentary, feature, short, performance and director, with the Women of Global Impact Awards honoring filmmakers addressing conflict and social change through their work.\n\n\t“We truly love this festival with all our hearts because it’s about youth, sensuality, possibility, and social meaning,” said co-founder Mariia Vynogradova, who hosts the Eurovision Song Contest. “It reminds us why women’s voices in cinema matter more than ever.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Nov. 6-12 event kicked off with Gar O’Rourke’s “Sanatorium,” Ireland’s Oscar entry, where Lady Sophie Windsor presented the opening night’s Women of Global Impact Award to Nicole Ansari-Cox for advocacy work with displaced women globally.\n\n\t“We must continue to support refugee women and filmmakers everywhere, Iranian, Palestinian, Ukrainian, or any other,” Ansari-Cox said. “Whenever women rise, communities heal. This festival proves that art can be a bridge between pain and hope.”\n\n\tUkrainian producers established the festival in 2022 through Talented U Limited, a London nonprofit connecting creative professionals across 12-plus countries.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSerbian filmmaker Stefan Djordjević is prepping his sophomore feature, “The Leaves Hang Trembling,” a hybrid docufiction that explores the impact of a teacher’s life and work on the people around her. The project took home the top prize last week at the Crossroads Co-Production Forum in the Thessaloniki Film Festival’s industry section, Agora.\n\n\tAs with Djordjević’s feature debut, “Wind, Talk to Me,” which premiered at the Rotterdam Film Festival this year before winning the top prize at Sarajevo, “The Leaves Hang Trembling” is a cinematic ode to the director’s late mother, who he describes as “the most important person in my life.”\n\t\n\n\tDjordjević’s first film — a deeply personal attempt to reckon with his mother’s death — earned a rapturous review from Variety’s Guy Lodge, who praised the “marvelous” docufiction for how it worked through grief “with wit, grace and imagination…weav[ing] fact, fiction and memory into a heart-bursting tribute to [the director’s] late mother.”\n\n\n\t“The Leaves Hang Trembling” is a companion piece to that film, broadening its scope beyond the four walls of the Djordjević family home. “‘Wind, Talk to Me’ was about how [my mother] inspired my family,” the director told Variety. “But with ‘The Leaves Hang Trembling,’ we can also see how she touched others as well.”\n\n\tThe film documents the life of Djordjević’s mother, Negrica Neca Đorđević, who in 2002 was hired by a local elementary school, where she worked for more than a decade as a beloved teacher, community leader and president of the teachers’ union. Fourteen years later, she was summarily dismissed without cause, “leaving her devastated emotionally,” and with the sense that “her faith in community and loyalty [had been] betrayed,” according to the director.\n\t\n\n\tIn her darkest moment, however, Neca’s students rallied behind her and rose up in her defense, rekindling her hope and her faith in her community. Using direct quotes from her diaries and letters, as well as contemporaneous audio recordings of the events as they unfolded, “The Leaves Hang Trembling” will tell the story of an inspirational woman “who gave so much of her energy, and also dedication and caring and love” to her family, her students and her community. \n\n\tDjordjević said the film “explores what it means to care beyond rules, to connect with others in ways that endure,” while also urging audiences “to feel the courage and compassion of the teacher, to witness the quiet strength of everyday care, and to leave believing in the transformative power of human connection.”\n\n\t“The Leaves Hang Trembling” is being produced against the backdrop of a broad, student-led protest movement that for the past year has galvanized the Serbian public against President Aleksandar Vučić. It began last November, after the collapse of a railway station canopy in the city of Novi Sad that killed 16 people, sparking outrage over the endemic corruption and the culture of impunity that many Serbians blamed for the disaster.\n\n\tAt this week’s industry award ceremony in Thessaloniki, where “The Leaves Hang Trembling” won the top prize in the Crossroads Co-Production Forum, producer Dragana Jovović, of Belgrade-based Non-Aligned Films, who’s producing the film in co-production with Vanja Jambrović of Restart, dedicated the win to Dijana Hrka, the mother of a 27-year-old man, Stefan, who was killed in the Novi Sad tragedy. Earlier this month, Hrka launched a hunger strike in front of Serbia’s National Assembly, demanding a “real investigation” into the events at Novi Sad and calling for “the liberation of all arrested students during the protest,” according to Jovović.\n\n\tWhile Djordjević said he wants to make a “universal film,” he also recognizes that the events of “The Leaves Hang Trembling” and the current political crisis in Serbia are connected. Since last year, many Serbian teachers and university professors have been summarily dismissed for supporting the student protests; in many cases, noted Djordjević, the students have rallied in their teachers’ defense.\n\t\n\n\tThat’s why the director sees “The Leaves Hang Trembling” as not only a testament to his late mother and the lives she touched, but as a part of his country’s “collective memory” — a history that continues to be written in real time.\n\n\tThe events depicted in the film “didn’t just happen nine years ago,” Djordjević said. “It’s still happening, and on a bigger level.”\n\n\tThe Thessaloniki Film Festival runs Oct. 30 – Nov. 9.\n",

Kewalya previously wrote “Shubh Mangal Saavdhan” and wrote and directed “Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan.”\n\n\tFirst-time feature director Bilal Hasan helms the project from his own script. Hasan previously earned a Filmfare award nomination for his award-winning short “Chupchaap.”\n\n\tThe story unfolds against the backdrop of a traditional practice involving training homing pigeons and flying them from rooftops. The custom continues in some Indian neighborhoods and among pigeon-racing communities globally. Principal photography is scheduled to begin next year.\n\n\tNot Out Entertainment is developing a slate of culturally specific projects. The banner is currently producing “Abhootpurva,” described as a romantic-horror-comedy set in 1990s Agra starring Ritwik Bhowmik alongside an ensemble cast. The company also has a horror film in development featuring Ahan Shetty, based on a real national tragedy.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Celebrity Traitors” has been renewed for a second season on BBC One and iPlayer.\n\n\tThe broadcaster confirmed on Monday that the show, which aired its Season 1 finale last week to 11 million viewers, will return with a new crop of stars next year. Companion show “The Celebrity Traitors: Uncloaked” will also return on BBC Sounds, BBC Two and iPlayer. “The Celebrity Traitors” is produced by Scotland’s Studio Lambert and hosted by Claudia Winkleman. \n\t\n\n\t“The Celebrity Traitors” became a phenomenon from the start, with its first episode becoming the biggest single episode on TV so far this year with 14.8 million views over 28 days. The show is also now the biggest unscripted title across the entire U.K. market since 2021. \n\n\n\tThe news comes amid a new Economic Impact Report, revealing that “The Traitors” franchise across the U.K. and U.S. has generated a £21.8 million ($28.7 million) boost to Scotland’s economy since 2022. \n\n\t“Studio Lambert have done an outstanding job as ‘The Celebrity Traitors’ has well and truly captivated the nation, becoming a bona fide highlight of the year bringing record numbers of people together to enjoy every twist and turn,” BBC head of entertainment Kalpna Patel-Knight said in a statement. “In 2026 the doors of the castle will be opened again to welcome celebrity players to the game to see who can charm, who can scheme and ultimately who can survive in series two which promises to be just as unmissable as the first. Plus with ‘Uncloaked’ returning and today’s news of the positive contribution ‘The Traitors’ brand has made to Scotland’s economy, there is plenty to celebrate.”\n\t\n\n\tIn Variety‘s review of the first season of “Celebrity Traitors,” Scott Bryan called the show the best reality TV of the year. “It is rare for the most popular show on television to be one of the best. It is rarer for that television show to become such a public spectacle that screenings of its finale fill out bars and clubs across the country. And it is even rarer for the tensions during those screenings, which you could cut with a knife, to be caused by the comedian Alan Carr,” he wrote. “Yet ‘The Celebrity Traitors U.K.’ did just that. The BBC’s first season of a celebrity version of the game — an elaborate, unpredictable internationally-franchised whodunnit — not only matched expectations. It exceeded them.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBBC News’ resigning CEO Deborah Turness has responded to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and others after the shocking news of her exit alongside director general Tim Davie on Sunday night. When questioned by journalists from her own newsroom outside of the BBC headquarters in London on Monday, Turness rejected claims of corruption and institutional bias.\n\n\tShe and Davie announced their resignations following a leaked memo published by The Telegraph over the weekend that suggested the BBC program “Panorama” edited a Trump speech to make it sound like he encouraged the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riots.\n\t\n\n\t“I would like to say it has been the privilege of my career to serve as the CEO of BBC News and to work with our brilliant team of journalists,” Turness said on Monday (via BBC News). “I stepped down over the weekend because the buck stops with me. But I’d like to make one thing very clear, BBC News is not institutionally biased. That’s why it’s the world’s most trusted news provider.”\n\n\n\tTrump celebrated the news on Sunday night, calling the organization “corrupt ‘journalists.'” \n\n\t“These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election,” Trump wrote. “On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!”\n\n\tResponding to that claim, Turness said: “Of course our journalists aren’t corrupt. Our journalists are hardworking people who strive for impartiality and I will stand by their journalism.”\n\n\tThe BBC has been flanked by several other controversies this year, including a Gaza documentary that was found to be a “serious breach” of Ofcom’s broadcasting rules and its handling of controversy at Glastonbury Festival when it aired the punk duo Bob Vylan chanting “death to the IDF.” \n\t\n\n\tIt is unclear exactly when Davie and Turness’ departures will go into effect. BBC chair Samir Shah is expected to formally apologize to the U.K.’s culture, sports and media committee later on Monday.\n",

Other titles in the Treasures section include Alfred Hitchcock’s 1944 psychological thriller “Spellbound,” starring Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck, which marks the Red Sea fest’s first film from Martin Scorsese’s Film Foundation dedicated to global cinema preservation.\n\n\n\t“’Umrao Jaan’ is intrinsically woven into the very fabric of my soul,” Rekha said in a statement. “She is not just a character; she serves as a mirror reflecting the depths of my emotions and dreams. In fact, one could say that she mirrors my soul through the echoes of many lifetimes, portraying a narrative that transcends millions of heartbeats.”\n\n\tShe added: “The opportunity for this soulful film to find a new life after 45 years and connect with a fresh audience at the prestigious Red Sea Film Festival is exhilarating and profoundly meaningful. And witnessing an unprecedented moment when a 1981 classic, ‘Umrao Jaan,’ is featured in the festival’s Treasures strand alongside a film by the luminary filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock is not only a blessing but humbling to the core.”\n\t\n\n\tThe fifth edition of the fest will run Dec. 4-13 in Jeddah, on the Red Sea’s eastern shore.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn 2012, award-winning documentarian Lauren Greenfield’s film, “The Queen of Versailles,” became a Sundance darling. The documentary followed Jackie and David Siegel, billionaires and owners of Westgate Resorts, as they began building a replica of Versailles in Orlando, Florida. The property was touted as the largest private home in the United States. However, amid their massive build, the 2008 stock market crash drastically altered the couple’s financial status. Now, with a script written by Olivier Award nominee Lindsey Ferrentino, songs by Academy Award–winning songwriter Stephen Schwartz and directed by Tony Award winner Michael Arden, Kristin Chenoweth is stepping into Jackie Siegel’s sparkling pink stilettos and bringing her story to Broadway. Unfortunately, Greenfield’s dazzling assessment of greed, consumption and the American dream doesn’t translate on the stage. \n\t\n\n\t“The Queen of Versailles” opens in France in 1661, with 23-year-old King Louis XIV (Pablo David Lauccerica) deciding to build what would become Versailles. Zipping forward in time to 2007, the audience then meets Jackie (Chenoweth), who, while sitting in the middle of a construction site in front of a camera crew, talks about building her own palace, her seven children and why it’s always essential to supersize things (including McDonald’s) when the option is given. \n\n\n\tShortly thereafter, we are introduced to David (F. Murray Abraham), Jackie’s much-older husband, who seems content to indulge (and fund) his wife’s shenanigans, especially since there are plans to have a Benihana on the meg-mansion’s grounds. From there, across two acts, the socialite welcomes audiences into her world. We learn more about her upbringing and how she worked several jobs to support herself while attending engineering school. The show also touches on her violent first marriage to her eldest daughter’s biological father, as well as her meet-cute and courtship with David. Meanwhile, endless construction, the Siegels’ lavish (but tacky) lifestyle and their chaotic family life buzz in the background.  \n\t\n\n\t“The Queen of Versailles” certainly has more than a few stunning elements. The scenic and video design by Dane Laffery is flawless, transporting audiences between 17th-century France and early 2000s Florida. Additionally, costumes spearheaded by Christian Cowan showcase who Jackie is before she even opens her mouth.  From a bedazzled Hermes’ tote covered in red, blue and white to match the French flag to her over-the-top beaded gowns and penchant for gold and glitter, her presence immediately screams new money.\n\n\tThe performances, including a megatallented ensemble, are also excellent. As expected, Chenoweth is a force, and though Jackie isn’t really a “likable” figure, the Emmy Award winner draws out aspects of her personality that offer glimmers of sympathy for this toxicly positive billionaire woman. Abraham doesn’t really sing. Still, he delivers a perfect David, a crochety old man, only pleased if his pockets are fat. Moreover, Nina White and Tatum Grace Hopkins, who portrayed Jackie’s daughter Victoria and niece Jonquil, respectively, stand alongside Chenoweth with their own powerhouse vocals.\n\n\tYet the play’s positive components do not make up for its faults. Broadway is the wrong medium for this story. Musicalizing the story does little to ground the audience in Jackie’s world and instead pulls and stretches the tale, when the themes alone could speak for themselves. The narrative would actually soar if it were given feature-film treatment. Additionally, adding the musical element further bastardizes this tale. Except for “Caviar Dreams,” the third song in Act One, none of the other selections are particularly memorable. Though the opening act is fairly intriguing, by the second act, the nearly three-hour-long performance began to drag, especially as the show’s tone shifted drastically. \n\n\tTaking a documentary and translating it on the Broadway stage was always going to be an ambitious endeavor, and when creatives attempt such feats, they should be celebrated. However, this entry into the Siegels’ world fails to land. Removing several of the music numbers and condensing “The Queen of Versailles” to cut specific sequences, such as Jackie’s upbringing and even scenes involving the French Revolution (though delightful), would make for a much more tonally focused and engaging production. In the end, some stories are best left for the silver screen.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSky Italy entertainment channels senior director Roberto Pisoni has stepped down from his role at the Comcast-owned pay-TV service. Pisoni is joining Italy’s expanding I Wonder Pictures, which is ramping up its production side and introducing AI into its creative and production process.\n\n\tPisoni – who has had a long career at Sky Italy since its 2003 launch – will now spearhead I Wonder’s content creation expansion as VP of AI innovation, content and new media development at the Bologna-based company.\n\t\n\n\tHe will report to I Wonder’s founder and CEO Andrea Romeo.\n\n\n\tIn recent years, I Wonder Pictures has emerged as one of the leading distribution players in Italy, thanks to a smart mix of arthouse and more mainstream movies, working with titles from both A24 and Neon among other companies. I Wonder’s recent releases include “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” “The Substance,” “Together,” “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” “The Whale” and “The Zone of Interest.”\n\n\tThe company has also gradually expanded its business model beyond traditional theatrical distribution by launching the Iwonderfull and Top Doc streaming platforms.\n\n\tPisoni’s appointment is part of Romeo’s plan to bolster the company’s organizational structure “in a phase of growth that involves production, distribution and the development of new spaces and narrative models in an integrated perspective,” according to a statement.\n\n\tPisoni will be responsible for coordinating the launch of a new unit within I Wonder called Top Contents and for leading the curation of the Iwonderfull and Top Doc platforms, as well as spearheading the adoption of “narrative and productive models that integrate cinema, documentary filmmaking, new media and processes of experimentation, including through a conscious use of artificial intelligence in the creative and productive chain,” the statement said.\n\t\n\n\tIn this new setup at I Wonder Pictures, Giulia Moretti and Giorgia Fassiano, who are in charge respectively of the company’s production unit and the editorial curation of its channels, “will continue to play a key role in the work of developing, coordinating and managing projects,” the statement noted.\n\n\t“Our work is founded on a specific cultural vision, which must be protected and remain evident in every editorial and organizational decision,” said Romeo. “Roberto’s arrival allows us to give this vision a more stable shared form.”\n\n\tCommented Pisoni: “I Wonder Pictures today represents a space for research and dialogue with the public that is rare in Italy. My job will be to translate this identity into method, both in production and in editorial curation and the development of new formats.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAn upcoming soccer agent thriller led by “Rivals” star Danny Dyer has a new title plus a U.K. distributor and release date and is now heading to the American Film Market.\n\n\t“One Last Deal,” previously entitled “Three Quick Breaths,” has been acquired by Sky for the U.K., with Blacktop International having boarded for worldwide sales.\n\n\tVertigo Releasing will release the film theatrically in the U.K. and Ireland on March 13, with it set to land on Sky Cinema as a Sky Original later in the year.\n\t\n\n\tBilled as a fast-paced, pressure-cooker thriller, “One Last Deal” sees Dyer play Jimmy Banks, an old-school football agent who desperately needs to get his star footballer one last big payday before his life, and his player’s reputation, comes tumbling down. It was filmed almost entirely in one location (Banks’ office), with Dyer — a much-loved figured in the U.K. — the only on-screen performer. “In a way I feel like it’s my Hamlet,” he said when it was first announced by Variety.\n\n\n\t“I am a massive sports fan and have always been fascinated by the art of the negotiation and ‘One Last Deal’ marries both in the form of an edge-of-your-seat thriller and an acting tour de force by veteran U.K. actor Danny Dyer and I made it a priority to chase and acquire for international rights,” said JD Beaufils of Blacktop International.\n\n\t“One Last Deal” is produced by Paul Kennedy (“Nightride”) for Village Films, Richard Bolger (“Father, Mother, Sister, Brother”) for Hail Mary Pictures, and Patrick O’Neill (“Kneecap”) for Wildcard, with support from Screen Ireland and Northern Ireland Screen. The film was shot in Ireland with post-production in Northern Ireland.\n\t\n\n\tExecutive producers include Sunrise Films principals Rupert Preston and Ed Caffrey, along with Richard Le Chartier and Xavier Collins of Lumiere Ventures. Greg Martin is executive producer for Screen Ireland. Lenders are CFF2 and Three Point Capital.\n\n\t“We are thrilled to be working with Sky Movies on this release in the U.K. and with Blacktop internationally,” said Preston and Caffrey of Vertigo Releasing and Andrew Nerger of Sunrise Films. “The combination of the talent of Danny Dyer and a really powerful film will excite audiences in the U.K. and around the world.”\n\n\tDyer is represented by Giacomo Palazzo of Independent Talent, and Brendan Muldowney by Sarah Williams of Independent Talent.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Marrakech Intl. Film Festival has revealed the lineup for its 22nd edition, which runs Nov. 28 to Dec. 6. A total of 82 films from 31 countries have been selected for the festival.\n\n\tNine of these films unspool as world or international premieres, nine have received the support of the Atlas Workshops, the festival’s industry and talent development platform, and 14 represent their countries in the race for the Academy Awards.\n\n\n\tThe Official Competition showcases new talent in world cinema with 14 first and second feature films that compete for the Étoile d’Or, awarded by a jury headed by filmmaker Bong Joon-ho.\n\t\n\n\tMoroccan filmmaker Meryem Benm’Barek, whose “Sofia” won the screenplay prize in 2018 in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard section, delivers the world premiere of “Behind the Palm Trees,” a tense psychological thriller that examines the class relations and social domination inherited from the colonial past.\n\n\tAustralian photographer James J. Robinson presents the international premiere of “First Light,” a moral drama in which a Filipino nun questions her faith in the face of corruption. He won best Australian director at Melbourne Film Festival when the film had its world premiere.\n\n\tSeveral filmmakers revisit decisive political moments in their countries through semi-autobiographical narrative: Shih-Han Tsao’s “Before the Bright Day” evokes the anxiety of a generation faced with the threat of war in Taiwan in 1996; Akinola Davies Jr.’s “My Father’s Shadow” follows a father and his sons in Nigeria during the 1993 electoral crisis; and Zamo Mkhwanazi’s “Laundry” recounts the dreams of a young South African man during Apartheid.\n\t\n\n\tTwo debut feature films — Siyou Tan’s “Amoeba” and Imran Perretta’s “Ish” — explore teenage friendship as it faces the challenge of political awakening, respectively in Singapore and suburban London. Three films portray women who demonstrate resistance and reinvent their destinies: Erige Sehiri’s “Promised Sky,” a tale of female solidarity in the face of racism in Tunisia; Ondřej Provazník’s “Broken Voices,” a chilling drama about the abuse of authority; and Morad Mostafa’s “Aisha Can’t Fly Away,” a fantasy thriller that follow a Sudanese woman’s quest for freedom in Cairo.\n\n\tIn the deeply moving documentaries “Memory” and “My Father and Qaddafi,” directors Vladlena Sandu and Jihane K., respectively, revisit their childhoods in Chechnya and Libya, weaving powerful narratives of families at the crossroads of personal memory and collective history.\n\n\tFinally, “Straight Circle,” a satire about the absurdity of conflict, reveals director Oscar Hudson’s visual inventiveness, while “Forastera,” a summer tale of mourning by Lucía Aleñar Iglesias, testifies to the “vitality of new voices in contemporary cinema as it combines formal audacity with universal emotion,” the festival said.\n\n\tThe Gala Screenings showcase, which include some of the world’s most anticipated films, opens with “Dead Man’s Wire,” Gus Van Sant’s satire on the media and capitalism. It also includes Maryam Touzani’s “Calle Málaga,” a tender portrait of a woman from the Spanish community in Tangier, starring Carmen Maura.\n\n\tAs part of the Tributes program, Guillermo del Toro unveils his gothic and romantic vision of “Frankenstein” with Jacob Elordi, while Jodie Foster presents “A Private Life,” Rebecca Zlotowski’s crime comedy.\n\n\tTwo world premieres bring together the biggest stars of Egyptian and Tunisian cinema: “El Sett,” Marwan Hamed’s biopic about the diva Oum Kalthoum, played by Mona Zaki; and “Sophia,” a chilling thriller directed by and starring Dhafer L’Abidine.\n\n\tA gala evening will celebrate “Hamnet” by Chloé Zhao, a moving tale of family love, in which the loss of a child inspires the play “Hamlet.” Filmmaker Neeraj Ghaywan comes to Marrakech with “Homebound,” a touching melodrama about the friendship and dreams of two young Indians played by rising Bollywood stars Ishaan Khatter and Vishal Jethwa.\n\t\n\n\tThe festival closes with Annemarie Jacir’s “Palestine 36,” which brings together some of the greatest actors in the Arab world in a historical drama that recounts a decisive moment for the Palestinian people.\n\n\tThe Horizons section presents 19 contemporary films that “paint a panorama of world cinema,” the festival said. It welcomes new work from major filmmakers Claire Denis, Valérie Donzelli, Ildikó Enyedi, Jim Jarmusch, Richard Linklater, Jafar Panahi, Park Chan-wook and Kelly Reichardt, and also highlights a new generation of auteurs: Ali Asgari (“Divine Comedy”), Simón Mesa Soto (“A Poet”), Teona Strugar Mitevska (“Mother”) and Mélisa Godet (“A Place for Her”).\n\n\tThe Horizons selection also celebrates the vitality of Arab cinema, with several films that have made their mark at major festivals: Cherien Dabis’s “What’s Left of Us” won acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival; both Hasan Hadi’s “The President’s Cake” and Arab and Tarzan Nasser’s “Once Upon a Time in Gaza” won awards at Cannes; and Cyril Aris’s “A Sad and Beautiful World” and Kaouther Ben Hania’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab” saw success at Venice. Two documentaries complete the selection: Raoul Peck’s “Orwell: 2+2=5” and Hélène Harder’s “Fatna, a Woman Named Rachid,” presented as a world premiere.\n\n\tThe 11th Continent program consists of six fiction and nine documentary films. The section presents new films by critically acclaimed filmmakers, including Massoud Bakhshi, Oliver Laxe, Lucrecia Martel and Hlynur Pálmason, while celebrating daring auteurs like Kamal Aljafari, Lana Daher, Damien Hauser, Dima El-Hor, Gianluca Matarrese, Namir Abdel Messeeh, Lemohang Mosese and Tamara Stepanyan. The program also includes restored versions of three classics of Arab cinema, including “The Mirage” by Ahmed Bouanani (1980), which has been restored especially for this occasion.\n\n\tThe Moroccan Panorama delivers seven fiction and documentary films by Moroccan filmmakers, of which two are world and international premieres: “Five Eyes” by Karim Debbagh and “Porte Bagage” by Abdelkarim El-Fassi. Moroccan cinema is further highlighted this year with a total of 15 films presented across the various sections of the festival.\n\t\n\n\tThe Young Audiences and Families section offers a program aimed at children and youth aged 4 to 18, as well as families, with 13 screenings that “celebrate curiosity and an awakening to the art of cinema.”\n\n\tRounding up this year’s films are a selection of films by and featuring Jodie Foster, Guillermo del Toro, Raouya and Hussein Fahmi, personalities to whom the festival offers Tributes this year, are presented at the Palais des Congrès, the Cinéma le Colisée, and the Musée Yves Saint-Laurent.\n\n\tOFFICIAL COMPETITIONAISHA CAN’T FLY AWAY by Morad MostafaEgypt, France, Germany, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Sudanwith Buliana Simon, Ziad Zaza, Mamdouh Saleh, Emad Ghoniem, Maya Mohamed, Mohamed Abd ElhadySupported by the Atlas Workshops\n\n\tAMOEBA by Siyou TanSingapore, Netherlands, France, Spain, South Koreawith Ranice Tay, Nicole Lee, Lim Shi-An, Genevieve Tan, Jack Kao, Ng Mun Poh\n\n\tBEFORE THE BRIGHT DAY (NAN FANG SHI GUANG) by Shih-Han TsaoTaiwanwith Hsuan-Li Chen, Kang-Ren Wu, Shu-Mei Sun, R.D.

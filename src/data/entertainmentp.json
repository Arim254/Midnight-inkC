    "body": "\n\tIn “Working Girl,” an upwardly mobile Melanie Griffith embodied Tess McGill, a secretary from Staten Island with big hair and even bigger dreams. She thought her new boss (played by Sigourney Weaver in the 1988 Mike Nichols movie) would be an ally, since they were both women trying to make it in a man’s world, but just because Katharine Parker didn’t reach up her skirt, the way Tess’ male superiors had, didn’t mean she wouldn’t try to stab her in the back.\n\t\n\n\tThe stars of the Broadway-aspiring stage musical now showing at the La Jolla Playhouse are not Tess and Katherine, but the 1980s themselves: poofy bangs and copious hairspray, nylon stockings and shoulder pads, boomboxes the size of briefcases and synthesizer-driven pop music (supplied here by Cyndi Lauper, whose music and lyrics resemble her Top 40 a lot more than her work on “Kinky Boots”). For the audience, it’s fun to find themselves transported back in time, even as it’s strange to feel nostalgic for a less enlightened decade, when greed was good, fashion was tacky and distaff office assistants were objectified by their male colleagues.\n\n\tBut “9 to 5” this is not. Where that movie — and the Dolly Parton-backed Broadway musical it inspired — were peppy and empowering, serving up an amusingly extreme answer to workplace chauvinism, “Working Girl” feels like it might have made a sharper play, given how plot-driven Kevin Wade’s original screenplay was. Catchy enough to warrant radio play, Lauper’s songs have the tricky task of sounding simultaneously hip (by contemporary standards) and retro, like a recently unearthed pop album originally recorded back in the ’80s, then lost to time.\n\t\n\n\tFrom its attitude-setting number, which finds Tess (Joanna “JoJo” Levesque) riding the Staten Island Ferry to work, Lauper’s music packs a period-appropriate kick — assuming you can look past the ultra-modern LED screens, on which images of the Statue of Liberty represent the hardest working gal in New York. To hear Tess tell it, she’s “looking for something more” — as open-ended an “I want” song as any musical could ask for.\n\n\tThe trouble is, Tess’ ambitions aren’t taken seriously in the testosterone-driven financial sphere where she works: mergers and acquisitions. In a typical setback, Tess learns that she’s been passed over for the executive training program (penalized for rebuffing a superior’s unwelcome advances, to be precise). The opportunity goes to a male “moron” instead, while Tess gets reassigned to the desk of her company’s latest hire — who, to Tess’ surprise, turns out to be a woman.\n\n\tHer first bit of advice comes from no less a role model than Coco Chanel: “Dress shabbily and they notice the dress. Dress impeccably and they notice the woman.” Tess’ new boss swears they’ll stick together, but it’s not long before Tess discovers that she has stolen her big idea — encouraging a client named Trask (Michael Genet) to purchase a radio network, instead of the TV station he had in mind.\n\n\tWhereas Katharine spent much of the film offscreen, the musical expands her part, giving the actress who plays her (in this case, Broadway vet Lesley Rodriguez Kritzer) more scenes and more songs than Weaver had in the movie. She also gets the show’s biggest laugh, spiraling through the air and into a hospital bed during a ski vacation.\n\n\tWhile Katharine is laid up (“calling in” to sing from her hospital bed), Tess steps into her boss’ shoes — literally, borrowing her designer clothes in the closet-raiding makeover number “Notice the Woman” — and steals the business contact who can broker the deal, Jack Trainer (Anoop Desai, a far cry from Harrison Ford but still every bit the romantic lead). The two have chemistry, sending sparks in the show’s best duet, “Can’t Trust Nobody,” though neither is 100% available … or 100% trustworthy.\n\n\t“Working Girl” has more plot than your typical musical needs and only a fraction of it lends itself to farce. Tess crashing the wedding of Trask’s daughter ought to be hilarious, but instead feels overcrowded and unclear. And breaking for intermission right after she’s successfully made her pitch seems an odd place to pause. Wouldn’t Katharine’s return make more sense, leaving audiences to wonder how “The Little People” will keep up the charade, now that the cat has come home (“I’m Back”)? It’s tough enough to fill out the second half, as evidenced by the out-of-place but amusing scene of Jack breakdancing (“Dream in Royalty”)?\n\t\n\n\tAmong the more intriguing changes is the idea that Tess is not alone in her struggle, but helped along by half a dozen female colleagues, to the extent that they might have called the show “Working Girls,” if Mike Leigh hadn’t gotten there first. Clawing her way up the ladder, Tess loses sight of those whose shoulders she stood on — especially best friend Cyn (Ashley Blanchet in the Joan Cusack role), with whom she’ll have to apologize before show’s end (their song, “You and Me,” could pass for a retro radio hit).\n\n\tTess also has a boyfriend, Mick (Joey Tanato), who looks like Val Kilmer and sounds like Jon Bon Jovi. In a clever tweak, he sings in a band. Trying to win Tess back after they break up, Mick’s “Get You Hot” jam bears an uncanny resemblance to “Living on a Prayer.” That’s one of the stranger things about Lauper’s songs: A lot of them sound a few notes removed from actual ’80s faves, none more than the title number, which echoes her own instantly recognizable hit, “Girls Just Want to Have Fun.” It’s a catchy tune, though memories of that earlier song send exactly the wrong message in a show where girls just want to be taken seriously.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBrendan Carr, the chairman of the FCC, reshared Donald Trump’s demand for Seth Meyers to be fired from NBC after being made the subject of his roasts on the host’s late-night show.\n\n\tTrump posted on Truth Social on Saturday, “NBC’s Seth Meyers is suffering from an incurable case of Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS). He was viewed last night in an uncontrollable rage, likely due to the fact that his ‘show’ is a Ratings DISASTER. Aside from everything else, Meyers has no talent, and NBC should fire him, IMMEDIATELY!”\n\t\n\n\tIn the past week, Meyers has repeatedly joked about Trump in his monologues, poking fun at his plans for health care, the government shutdown, a 50-year mortgage, a dinner with finance executives and the ongoing controversy over the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\n\n\tShortly after Trump’s post, Carr reposted the president’s message to his X account.\n\n\n\tAlthough Carr didn’t comment, his public co-sign of the president’s demand for NBC to fire the late-night hosts comes after his apparent threat to take action against ABC over remarks by Jimmy Kimmel following the assassination of Charlie Kirk in September.\n\n\tWhile appearing on Benny Johnson’s podcast on Sept. 17, Carr suggested that the FCC has “remedies we can look at.”\n\n\t“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said. “These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”\n\n\tA few hours after Carr’s remarks, two major broadcasting stations, Nexstar and Sinclair, pulled “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” from airing on several of their affiliate groups, as well as ABC, indefinitely suspending Kimmel’s show. \n\t\n\n\t“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” returned on air on Sept. 23.\n",

I’m Bill, and I’m the city slicker who’s going to head to Texas with you to break down new episodes of this lovable Billy Bob Thornton drama. As Season 2 begins, the characters are facing many changes. Among them, Monty Miller (Jon Hamm) is dead and his wife Cami (Demi Moore) is taking over M-Tex; cartel boss Jimenez (Alex Meraz) was killed by his boss Gallino (Andy Garcia); Cooper (Jacob Lofland) is trying to make his scandalous relationship with Ariana (Paulina Chavez) work as he heads off on his own to try to be an oil tycoon; and Tommy (Thornton) is promoted to have even more responsibilities at M-Tex after Monty’s death. It’s a stressful time, so let’s dive right in.\n\t\n\n\nBetween Tommy’s breakfast conspiracy lecture and mainlining coffee and cigarettes before the sun’s up, I’m worried about him having a heart attack, too!\nThere’s good music already this season — a Turnpike Troubadours needle drop not even five minutes in? Hell yeah!\n“The mosquitoes are so big, they can fuck a turkey flat-footed.” Is it possible that’s not a folksy Texas expression but rather a horrifying reality in the South?\n“It’s a young woman’s game here — no offense.” I’m sorry, Demi Moore made “The Substance” — you must treat her with respect or prepare to be eaten alive.\nCami’s speech rules, and is a great reminder of the take-no-prisoners attitude that makes this show special. “The only difference between me and Monty is I’m meaner. Test me and you’ll find out how much.” Fuck yeah!\nHow is Cooper’s first drill this successful? Another shoe has to drop on this get-rich-quick operation, right?\nWow, Ariana couldn’t be less excited about being an overnight multimillionaire. Why is she so cagey?\nAngela (Ali Larter) expressing her love of grey sweatpants to her daughter, Ainsley (Michelle Randolph), is pretty gross! Will we see Tommy wearing them in a future episode?\nAinsley and this college counselor couldn’t be less of a fit — give me a bottle episode with these two on a road trip!\nShout out to Randolph, who walks a tricky line during this scene between being way over her head and disarmingly sweet. It’s hard to empathize with someone who spends the bulk of their admittance meeting babbling on about the importance of hot people having kids together, but she makes it work.\nOof, what a sad introduction to T.L. (Sam Elliott). Is it too soon to cry this season?\nT.L.’s harsh rebuttal of reconnecting with his wife after he passes: “If I do, that means I’m in hell too.” Woof, we’ve got some trauma to explore soon.\nThe way the Norris women act around Cooper, you can practically smell him through the television.\nIt’s funny how quickly everyone scatters when Angela starts throwing plates during her tantrum. Bonus points to those around the table who escaped with their drinks and food in hand.\nTommy and Angela’s rapid, NC-17 make-up after the dinner fight proves that those two loonies are meant for each other.\nThere’s something about Thornton’s cigarette smoking that makes the ugly habit look so appealing, right?\nLove that final shot of the sunset, mirroring Tommy to who we now know is his father, T.L., as they both search for meaning in the family matriarch’s death.\n\n\n\n\tUntil next week, feel free to discuss your own conspiracy theories and far-fetched easy money schemes in the comments below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Fast Rise, Long Decline, and Agonizing Downfall of the MTV Empire\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMeet Strangelove, the Cult-Favorite Fragrance House Powered by Oud\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder Armour’s CEO Just Did the Thing He ‘Couldn’t Imagine’\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothée Chalamet and Adam Sandler joined for a conversation about their careers and crafts in the Fairfax High School gymnasium in Los Angeles, where Chalamet praised Sandler as “one of the best fucking actors of all time.”\n\n\tThe event, dubbed “Sandler x Chalamet,” took place on the evening of Nov. 15. Before packed bleachers, Chalamet and Sandler reviewed and discussed clips from their respective filmographies, including their upcoming releases “Marty Supreme” and “Jay Kelly.” After watching a clip of Sandler in Paul Thomas Anderson’s 2006 romantic dramedy, “Punch Drunk Love,” Chalamet expressed his appreciation for Sandler’s performance in the film.\n\t\n\n\t“It is one of the most important performances. It’s impactful, deeply moving,” said Chalamet. “As a young actor knowing you for your comedic work, seeing that thrown against the context of your other work, I’m like, ‘Wow, this is a fucking incredible actor. I hope I can give a performance like this.'”\n\n\n\tChalamet continued to compliment Sandler’s acting beyond “Punch Drunk Love,” stating, “I know it’s not about awards, blah, blah, blah, but you should have a golden man in your hand, because, man, you’re one of the best fucking actors of all time.”\n\n\tSandler returned the praise, telling Chalamet, “What you continue to do for cinema and for all of us is beyond it all. I just cannot wait to see what you bring in the future.”\n\n\tAdditional clips from the evening included Sandler in “Big Daddy” and “Uncut Gems,” Chalamet in “Call Me By Your Name,” “Dune: Part 2” and “A Complete Unknown,” sneak-peaks at “Marty Supreme” and “Jay Kelly” and clips of both actors in “Saturday Night Live” sketches.\n\t\n\n\tThough the two have never appeared in a film together, Chalamet was in a cut scene from Jason Reitman’s “Men, Women & Children,” which Sandler starred in in 2014. Despite Chalamet not making the final cut, Sandler noted, “I remember when Jason Reitman was talking about you being in it, he said to me, ‘Oh, I got this kid playing the quarterback. He’s coming. He’s incredible.’ He like, knew.”\n\n\tThe two broke down each other’s scenes, waxed nostalgia about their respective times on “SNL” and joked about their common hobbies of basketball and guitar, each showcasing their signature wit throughout. At the end of the night, two members of the audience were invited to play a game of 2-on-2 half-court basketball against the stars. \n\n\t“Marty Supreme” is directed by Josh Safdie, who was in the crowd and previously directed Sandler in 2019’s “Uncut Gems.” The movie releases in theaters on Christmas Day. “Jay Kelly” is directed by Noah Baumbach and comes to Netflix Dec. 5.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” pulled off a nifty magic trick, besting Glen Powell’s big-budget action-thriller, “The Running Man,” and the second weekend of “Predator: Badlands,” the critically adored reboot of the long-running monster franchise. \n\n\tThe third “Now You See Me” film picked up $21.3 million over the weekend, a solid result for a series that hasn’t had a new entry since 2016. The film also grossed $54.2 million across 64 international territories this weekend for a worldwide total of $75.5 million. \n\t\n\n\t“This is still a viable franchise,” says Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at ComScore. “The international audience really delivered for the film.”\n\n\n\tIt’s good news for Lionsgate, the studio behind the $90 million illusionist adventure, which has failed to materialize many hits in recent months (the list of duds includes “Ballerina” and “Good Fortune”). It may signal a shift in the studio’s fortunes, with “The Housemaid,” an adaptation of Freida McFadden’s best-selling potboiler, hitting theaters in December, and “Michael,” a biopic of Michael Jackson, and “The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping,” opening in 2026. Ruben Fleischer, who previously helmed “Venom” and “Zombieland,” handled directing duties on “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” with stars Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco returning as a group of magicians who fleece corrupt one-percenters. A fourth film is in the works.\n\n\t“We gave the audience exactly what they wanted,” says Kevin Grayson, head of domestic distribution for Lionsgate. He argued that “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” was able to broaden its audience by bringing back franchise mainstays and adding a new generation of stars such as Justice Smith, Dominic Sessa and Ariana Greenblatt. “The new cast helped bring in younger moviegoers,” Grayson added. \n\t\n\n\t“The Running Man,” which paired Powell with cult favorite filmmaker Edgar Wright, was no match for “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” settling for a second-place finish with a lackluster $17 million. Internationally, the film earned $11.2 million for a global haul of $28.2 million. That’s a troubling result considering that Paramount shelled out $110 million to make the movie. It’s also Powell’s first stumble since he began building a following with hits like the rom-com “Anyone But You,” “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Twisters.” Oh, and it’s bad news for Wright, who could have used a box office winner after his last film, “Last Night in Soho,” had the misfortune of opening in 2021 as Omicron was hitting the scene. Heading into the weekend, Paramount had hoped the film would debut to more than $20 million. “The Running Man” was greenlit and produced long before David Ellison’s Skydance took control of Paramount in August.\n\n\t“This thing is dead in the water,” says Jeff Bock, an analyst with Exhibitor Relations. “It doesn’t have enough traction to survive the coming holiday season.” \n\n\tThe weekend’s two major new releases appealed to slightly different demographics. “The Running Man’s” audience was 63% male and 70% between the ages of 18 and 44, while the opening crowd for “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” was 54% female and 65% over the age of 25.\n\n\t“The Running Man” is the second attempt at adapting Stephen King’s dystopian novel; the first was a campy 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger flick. And Schwarzenegger has a connection to “Predator: Badlands,” having starred in the original entry in the series, which was also released in 1987 during his action hero heyday. In its sophomore weekend, “Predator: Badlands” dropped a steep 68% to $13 million to bring the 20th Century Studios release’s domestic haul to $66.3 million. The film cost $105 million to make and has earned $136.3 million globally.\n\n\tThe weekend’s other major new release, Neon’s “Keeper,” the latest indie horror effort from writer-director Osgood Perkins, earned a paltry $2.5 million for a seventh-place debut. That’s a pale shadow of what Perkins’ previous films, “Longlegs” ($22 million) and “The Monkey” ($14 million), earned in their opening weekends. Critics loathed the film, and audiences appeared to agree, handing it a “D+” grade, so word-of-mouth won’t come in handy. The only saving grace is that “Keeper” cost a mere $6 million to produce. Perkins will try to recapture his commercial touch with next year’s “The Young People,” which stars Tatiana Maslany and Nicole Kidman.\n\t\n\n\tParamount’s “Regretting You,” an adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s novel of the same name, took fourth place in its fourth weekend, earning $4 million. That pushes its domestic total to $44.9 million. Universal’s “The Black Phone 2” rounded out the top five, picking up $2.6 million to push its stateside haul to $74.7 million after five weeks of release. \n\n\tIn milestone news, “One Battle After Another” crossed $70 million at the domestic box office and $200 million globally after eight weekends in theaters. That would be a strong result for an R-rated, adult-oriented thriller, save for the fact that Warner Bros. gave director Paul Thomas Anderson and Leonardo DiCaprio $140 million to make the film. Critics called it a masterpiece, and the movie generated Oscar buzz, but given that “One Battle After Another” needed to make roughly $300 million to break even, the studio is looking at a very steep write-down.\n\n\tOverall, the domestic box office topped out at just over $75 million, slightly ahead of the same period last year when Dwayne Johnson’s holiday comedy “Red One” drove earnings to $73.2 million. Next weekend brings “Wicked: For Good,” giving theater owners renewed hope after they’ve suffered through one of the worst falls in movie business history. To prime the pump, Universal re-released “Wicked,” bringing in $1.2 million.\n\n\t“We’re in the calm before the Thanksgiving storm,” says Dergarabedian. “Things are about to heat up.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tOn the final day of BravoCon, during an “Ask Andy” panel, “Real Housewives” executive producer Andy Cohen announced the official cast for “The Real Housewives of Rhode Island,” the latest entry in Bravo’s mega-franchise. Cohen also confirmed that a new season of “The Real Housewives of New York City” has been cast, and will begin filming soon. Cohen declined to name who will appear in Season 16, but it’s safe to say that BravoCon attendees Erin Lichy, Sai De Silva and Jessel Taank will be among them. Brynn Whitfield and Ubah Hassan, whose toxic fight poisoned the already weak 15th season, have already announced their departures (which were foregone conclusions). \n\t\n\n\tCohen also expressed confidence that “The Real Housewives of New Jersey,” currently on pause, will come back eventually.\n\n\n\tWith “The Real Housewives of Rhode Island,” as has been rumored — since they’ve both been spotted filming — former “Bachelor” and “Bachelor in Paradise” contestant Ashley Iaconetti is one of the show’s fulltime cast members, and Dolores Catania of “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” (who was also one of the winners of Season 3 of “The Traitors”) is a “friend” of the cast. (Official bios of the full cast are included below.)\n\n\tIaconetti’s casting is the first time a Bachelor Nation star has crossed over to “The Real Housewives.” Iaconetti, an influencer, co-hosts the “Almost Famous” podcast with ex-Bachelor Ben Higgins. She appeared on Chris Soules’ season of “The Bachelor” in 2015, and later married her “Bachelor in Paradise” castmate Jared Haibon. (They have two children.)\n\t\n\n\tAnd she’s new to Rhode Island, the show’s trailer emphasizes. It’s Iaconetti’s voice that kicks it off, serving as our guide. “In Rhode Island, everyone knows everyone,” she says over crashing waves and drone shots of huge mansions. “People here don’t look down on other states. But they are weirded out that other states exist.”\n\n\tAs for Catania, she’s introduced to the show in relation to her lookalike friend, Liz. With “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” currently paused, Catania has moved to more fertile pastures, and her cast bio reads: “Rhode Island captured Dolores’s heart years ago, and she’s longed to return ever since. With her dear friend Liz McGraw living there – and a shared business project on the horizon – a sun-soaked, beach-filled summer is a natural fit for this Jersey girl.”\n\n\n\n\n\t Here’s its official logline: “They may live in the smallest state in the country, but their drama? Extra large. As “The Real Housewives” hits its milestone 20th anniversary next year, Bravo is expanding the distinguished franchise with “The Real Housewives of Rhode Island,” spotlighting a fresh, charismatic group of women whose lives intertwine across the storied coastline of New England luxury. “\n\n\t“The Real Housewives of Rhode Island” will premiere next year.\n\n\tAlicia CarmodyRhode Island to the core, Alicia isn’t shy about her roots — just wait until you hear her say “cracker.” After eight years of engagement to fiancé Billy Kitsilis, this “Runaway Bride” still isn’t ready to take the plunge — even for their daughter, Celina. When she’s not dodging wedding bells, Alicia helps Billy run his restaurant, Pizza Mamma, proving she can handle the heat both in and out of the kitchen. \n\n\tRosie DiMareA former local television news anchor, Rosie now shines as the host of her own lifestyle program and as a sought-after DJ. Recently celebrating her first wedding anniversary with husband Rich DiMare, a well-known Frank Sinatra style singer — Rosie calls North Kingstown home, where the couple lives with their dog, Clementine.\n\n\tAshley IaconettiAfter finding love with her now-husband — and Warwick, Rhode Island native — Jared Haibon on “Bachelor in Paradise,” Ashley has traded rose ceremonies for real life as a proud mom to two boys, Dawson and Hayden. While Jared manages their beloved coffee shop, Ashley has built a thriving career as a social media powerhouse, all while acclimating her new life in her husband’s home state.\n\t\n\n\tLiz McGrawLiz is Rhode Island royalty — the woman everyone wants to know, and the state’s very own Cannabis Queen. Alongside her husband, Gerry, she owns and operates The Slater Center, the largest and most successful cannabis dispensary in Rhode Island. But Liz isn’t just a business powerhouse — she’s also a devoted stepmom toMiranda, Briana, and Skyla, balancing family, entrepreneurship, and her signature flair for style.\n\n\tRulla Nehme PontarelliRulla helms a financial empire as a Certified Financial Planner and Wealth Manager to some of the East Coast’s most distinguished families. Rulla is married to prominent Rhode Island podiatrist, Brian, and together they juggle life with their two young children, Luca and Laila. \n\n\tKelsey SwansonFormer Miss Rhode Island, Kelsey,keeps a full plate as one of the state’s top makeup artists. Kelsey has been in a 10-year relationship with one of Rhode Island’s most notable figures, enjoying the lap of luxury while keeping her social calendar full. \n\n\tJo-Ellen TiberiSelf-proclaimed town gossip, Jo-Ellen, knows everyone and everything worth knowing in Cranston. As one of the top aesthetic practice development managers in the country, she juggles a busy career with family life alongside her high school sweetheart and husband, Gary, and their three kids — Gian, Jolie, and Gia. \n",

    "body": "\n\tLionsgate’s “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” swiped the top spot on global box office charts with $75.5 million. The film, which also took first place in the domestic marketplace, earned $54.2 million internationally from 64 territories. \n\n\tReleased nearly a decade after the previous entry in the series, the third “Now You See Me” performed well with foreign ticket buyers. Some of the highest-grossing territories include China ($19.2 million), South Korea ($3.9 million), France ($3.5 million) and the U.K. ($3.2 million). Ruben Fleischer directed “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” and the film brought back franchise mainstays Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco as a band of Robin Hood-like illusionists. The movie cost $90 million to produce. \n\t\n\n\tSony’s “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle” opened in China with a hefty $52.4 million debut. It now ranks as the fifth highest-grossing film of 2025, having earned nearly $730 million.  \n\n\tParamount’s “The Running Man,” an R-rated adaptation of Stephen King’s dystopian novel, collapsed at the global box office. After stumbling with a $17 million domestic launch, the film eked out an international gross of $11.2 million from 58 international markets. That’s a disastrous result given “The Running Man’s” $110 million budget. The film was directed by Edgar Wright, who previously helmed “Baby Driver” and “Shaun of the Dead,” and stars Glen Powell. Top markets for “The Running Man” included the U.K. ($3.3 million), Germany ($1.1 million) and Australia ($1 million). \n\t\n\n\tAnd Warner Bros.’ “One Battle After Another” crossed the $200 million mark at the global box office after earning another $1.4 million internationally. The thriller was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Chase Infiniti. It earned some of the year’s best reviews, but its $140 million budget makes it one of 2025’s bigger flops. Theater owners keep half of ticket sales, and Warner Bros. spent tens of millions on top of production costs to market the picture, putting it deeply in the hole.\n",

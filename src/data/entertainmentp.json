    "body": "\n\tJuliette Binoche delved into the craft of acting and her emerging voice as a director during a packed masterclass at the 7th Hainan Island International Film Festival, drawing on decades of collaborations with filmmakers including John Boorman and Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\n\t“You have to develop a relationship with everybody, all the technicians as well as the director and actors. With John Boorman [director of 2004’s ‘In My Country’], at the beginning of the shooting, he was always in another room with the monitor, and I expressed it to him that it was difficult to establish an artistic relationship with him because he was so far away,” said Binoche.\n\t\n\n\t“He changed totally as we went on, and by the end he left the monitor and came to the camera to be with me when I was acting. And he said to me it was the best experience, because he went back to his love of filming.”\n\n\n\tBinoche added, “With Kieślowski, when we did ‘Blue’ he would make me rehearse five times and do just one take. And at the end of the take, he would say ‘it’s not like the rehearsal’? And I said of course, because I don’t know what’s coming out of me, I’m discovering it as we’re going. So I said to him, why don’t we do just one rehearsal and then five takes?”\n\n\tShe continued, “He said, I cannot do that, because in the editing room then there are too many possibilities and its too difficult to choose, also in Poland we don’t have money, so we only do one take (on film). I said ‘Here we can do many takes, because we’re not in Poland.’”\n\n\tBinoche also responded to questions from the masterclass about the direction, challenges and prospect of filmmaking in China, pointing to the importance of national subsidies in France as a vital lifeline for risk-taking cinema.\n\t\n\n\t“I feel that the art of cinema is not easy. Going to the new you have to be free. Free of mind. Free of heart. Free,” said Binoche. “In France we are very helped by the money that can help young directors, [help them] in their artistry of becoming the director they can be, and I think the fact that in France our system that gives money, it allows a special cinema in a way, and is key for cinema to be alive.”\n\n\tBinoche also reflected on the financing journey that brought her directorial debut “In-I in Motion” to the screen.\n\n\t“I gave [footage of “In-I in Motion”] to a Belgium producer once, and he watched a little bit of the tape and he said, ‘Yeah, it’s probably interesting.’ But then life went on,” Binoche said.\n\n\t“I don’t know if [the producers of “In-I in Motion”] didn’t come to me and say ‘we’d like to do something with you… I don’t know whether – when I would have done it,” she added. “But because they said yes and they had the desire for me to do something new, then it opened me the doors as a director. And I want to continue because I feel that I have that in me that is natural. I have a certain, natural authority. And that you need to have as a director. If you don’t have it, there is no way you can drag 50 people along with you.”\n\n\tLater, speaking with Variety, Binoche shared advice from directors she had worked with, before embarking on “In-I In Motion.” \n\n\t“Tran Anh Hung said to me once, ‘each time you cut to another shot, a new shot, you’ve got to be surprised,’” said Binoche, who worked with the French-Vietnamese director on 2023’s “The Taste of Things.” “So it’s not cutting just to follow a movement, you’re cutting because there is something new that you’re going to discover. There is something new that needs to be given.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 49th edition of Sweden’s Göteborg Film Festival will open on Jan. 23 with a gala screening of Swede Marcus Carlsson’s “The Quiet Beekeeper2 (“Biodlaren”), hailed by Variety this year as a breakout buzz title at Göteborg’s Works in Progress strand of its Nordic Film Market. \n\n\tScandinavia’s biggest film festival and market, attracting a historical record of 2,368 industry attendees according to a preliminary count at the end of this year’s edition, the Göteborg Film Festival runs Jan. 23-Feb. 1.\n\t\n\n\tThe opening night slot marks further recognition from Göteborg for Carlsson who won its Startsladden Audience Award in 2014 for his short film, “Dirtbags,” a portrait of the foreclosed life prospects of a hotel cleaner. \n\n\n\tThe director of now three features, Carlsson has carved out a reputation, principally in his native Sweden, for films which chart the complexities of relationships, whether the 2013 ensemble drama “Your Childhood Shall Never Die” or the bruising “Love and Will” (“Kärlek & vilja”), which world premiered to some acclaim at Göteborg in 2018.\n\n\tEqually, “The Quiet Beekeeper” plumbs the fault lines of an intimate relation in a film described by the Göteborg Festival on Wednesday as a “quiet and deeply affecting drama about a father and daughter who carry a shared grief in different ways.”\n\n\tSet in a small town in Värmland, a province of rolling countryside and low mountains in western Sweden, “The Quiet Beekeeper” “with a delicate touch” portrays “both the everyday and the existential – from the humming of beehives to a relationship on the verge of collapse. It’s a story of loss, silence, and longing for closeness, but also of the hope that can grow when we dare to face what we fear,” the Festival announced, praising the “powerful performance as beekeeper father Olof ofAdam Lundgren, who co-wrote the screenplay with Carlsson.\n\t\n\n\tThe cast also  includes Hedvig Nilsson, Marika Lindström, Julia Schacht, Sara Arne, Judith Blix, Linnéa Cart-Lamy, Magnus Sundberg, Isabelle Grill, Mindie Mendel, Antti Reini, and Christina Lindberg.\n\n\t“The Quiet Beekeeper” is produced by produced by Lovisa Charlier Ginday at Mariedamfilm.\n\n\tVariety praised “The Quiet Beekeeper” for its “subtle” father-daughter relationship in a Nordic Film Market wrap article this February.    \n\n\t“We’re thrilled to open the 2026 Göteborg Film Festival with the world premiere of a powerful Swedish film. Biodlaren is a subtle and deeply touching story that, with great sensitivity, captures life far from the noise of big cities,” said Pia Lundberg, artistic director of the Göteborg Film Festival. “It’s a film that lingers, reminding us how the fragility of human relationships can hold both pain and light.”\n\n\t“I hope everyone will feel the quiet strength that Värmland has given the film. I’m so grateful that it’s finally getting to meet its audience,” Carlsson added.\n\n\t“The Quiet Beekeeper”is competing in the Nordic Competition and will also be available online in the Göteborg Film Festival’s digital screening room. It will bow on site in Göteborg and in cinema theaters across Sweden.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPriya Dogra has been appointed as the next chief executive of U.K. public service broadcaster Channel 4, replacing Alex Mahon who stepped down this summer after 8 years in the role. \n\n\tDogra will join Channel 4 in March 2026. Current Channel 4 chief Jonathan Allan will continue in the role of interim CEO until then.  Allan was reportedly in the running for the job — one of the biggest in U.K. TV — alongside Netflix exec Emma Lloyd.\n\t\n\n\t Dogra, who currently holds the post as chief advertising group data and new revenue Officer at pay-TV Sky, is a well-respected TV exec with more than two decades experience in the media industry in the U.S., Europe, Middle East and U.K. Her expertise spans across programming, production, strategy, mergers and acquisitions, as well as business development. \n\n\n\tPrior to joining Sky, Dogra spent 14 years at Time Warner/WarnerMedia and Warner Bros.

    "body": "\n\tJennie just made K-pop history.\n\n\tThe singer — who is part of the girl group Blackpink and released her first solo album, “Ruby,” this year — scored Vevo‘s most watched premiere of the year globally with the music video for “Like Jennie,” marking the first time a K-pop visual has topped the Vevo charts. In the U.K., the video for “Like Jennie” was the tenth biggest premiere of the year.\n\n\n\tOn Vevo’s U.K. year-end charts, Sabrina Carpenter’s video for “Manchild” generated the most views in its first two weeks of release with 1.55 million. “Tears” and “Please Please Please” featuring Dolly Parton also made Vevo’s Top 10 Premieres Chart for the U.K. in third and eighth place respectively, while Lady Gaga’s “Abracadabra” came in second and “The Dead Dance” ranked sixth.\n\t\n\n\tIn the U.K.’s Top 10 Videos overall chart, newcomer Skye Newman dominated with 9.22 million views for “Family Matters.” The English singer-songwriter’s video for “Hairdresser” also made the cut, coming in at third with 5.55 million views. Olivia Dean’s “Man I Need” and Doechii’s “Denial Is a River” also appear on the chart in sixth and eighth place, respectively.\n\n\n\t“Vevo’s annual insights serve as a pop culture pulse check, showing what music videos drove the most buzz and what was most culturally relevant this year,” said JP Evangelista, senior vice president of content, programming and market at Vevo. “As a network that’s purely dedicated to the music video, we’ve been stewards of this art form and analyzing the trends in this space for over 15 years. This was a historical year for Vevo, especially having a K-Pop music video as our top premiere of the year globally. Music video viewership in 2025 reflected diverse consumer palettes, with fans increasingly watching artists from all corners of the world, spanning a variety of genres, sub-genres and local scenes.”\n\t\n\n\tCheck out Vevo’s end of year U.K. charts below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJapan‘s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is extending its film and television incentive program through fiscal year 2026 with enhanced provisions designed to attract more overseas productions, the Visual Industry Promotion Organization and Japan Film Commission has revealed.\n\n\tThe most significant change to the scheme is the introduction of multi-year subsidies, enabling projects to receive support spanning up to two years. This marks a departure from the previous system’s rigid timeline requirements for expense reporting.\n\t\n\n\tUnder the earlier framework, only expenses reported by the end of January following the grant decision qualified for reimbursement. A one-year project in the current fiscal year had to run from March 27, 2025, to Jan. 31, 2026. The updated program allows expenses spanning multiple fiscal years and accommodates project timelines that cross the Japanese fiscal year boundary.\n\n\n\tThe revamped incentive scheme is scheduled to launch in late spring 2026, with application guidelines to be announced at a later date.\n\n\tSince its inception in 2023, the program has supported 18 film and television projects through the end of 2025. Notable productions include “The Smashing Machine,” starring Dwayne Johnson as UFC fighter Mark Kerr, which earned director Benny Safdie the Silver Lion for best director at the Venice Film Festival earlier this year.\n\n\tThe U.S.-Japan co-production “Rental Family,” directed by Hikari and starring Brendan Fraser, premiered in the special presentation section at the Toronto International Film Festival and subsequently played at the London and Tokyo festivals. The film follows an American actor in Japan who joins a “rental family” agency.\n\t\n\n\tThe program has also backed the second season of “Drops of God,” the International Emmy Award-winning French-Japanese drama about gastronomy and fine wines. Starring Fleur Geffrier and Tomohisa Yamashita, the series is adapted from the New York Times bestselling Japanese manga.\n\n\tThe program is a METI initiative, with VIPO serving as operator and the Japan Film Commission coordinating.\n",

    "body": "\n\tReliance Entertainment will distribute the critically acclaimed period drama “Hamnet” across India in February 2026, as the film gains momentum during awards season.\n\n\tBased on Maggie O’ Farrell’s book, the film follows William Shakespeare (Paul Mescal), who is in the midst of writing his latest play. He finds love with Agnes (Jessie Buckley) but also experiences grief when his young son, Hamnet (Jacobi Jupe), succumbs to the plague. The story of love, loss and grief lead to him writing his tragedy “Hamlet.” Chloe Zhao directed the feature, with Sam Mendes and Steven Spielberg serving as producers.\n\t\n\n\t“’Hamnet’ marks Zhao’s first feature since her ambitious Marvel stumble in 2021 (a pivot that alienated some who preferred her magic-hour indie dramas), raising once again that eternal question, ‘To be or not to be,’ just not in the conventional sense. In her hands, Shakespeare’s indelible line doesn’t represent a contemplation of suicide so much as what it means to be — to fully embrace life, when the inevitability of death is enough to paralyze one into a self-protective stupor. Ultimately, the filmmaker invites the world to feel loss in a new way, and in letting go, liberates something fundamental in all of us,” wrote Peter Debruge, reviewing the film for Variety.\n\n\n\tThe film has earned 11 nominations at the Critics Choice Awards and six Golden Globe nominations, establishing itself as a major contender in this year’s awards race. \n\n\t“We are thrilled to bring ‘Hamnet’ to audiences in India,” said Dhruv Sinha, head of international business at Reliance Entertainment. “The film has resonated deeply with global viewers and critics alike, and its extraordinary recognition at the Critics Choice Awards and Golden Globes is a testament to its emotional power and artistic brilliance. Reliance Entertainment is committed to delivering world-class cinema to Indian audiences, and ‘Hamnet’ is a shining example of storytelling that transcends borders.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJosh Hutcherson said during a recent appearance on Jesse Tyler Ferguson’s “Dinner’s On Me” podcast that he “knew only success” in the early stages of his career, but after starring in “The Hunger Games” franchise, he learned how “complicated” the film industry could be.\n\n\t“I didn’t learn rejection ever,” Hutcherson said. “I knew only success from the age 9 to, like, 24, then kind of post ‘Hunger Games’ world. Because ‘Hunger Games’ set things up. The industry is so goddamn tricky because they set you up in this way where they’re like, ‘You’ve arrived. You now are working with Jennifer Lawrence and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and you’re in this movie that makes billions of dollars, you’re the second lead of the film.'”\n\t\n\n\tThe “I Love L.A.” star explained that, as “quickly as they’re excited to get you into the spotlight,” the opportunities start to fade. After his ample success as a young actor, Hutcherson said he experienced his first feelings of “disappointment, failure [and] rejection” around age 25.\n\n\n\t“It was just like a string of no one calling, not getting any offers, auditioning but not getting cast,” Hutcherson recalled. “It’s this whole thing of, ‘Oh wow, I have my career that I’ve had since I was 9 years old. It’s always worked. I always got cast.’ Of course, there are things that you don’t get cast in, but I had only known that the chances are, if I was auditioning, was going to book it. That is just not the reality at all.”\n\n\tHutcherson starred in 2012’s “The Hunger Games” at 18 years old. The film spawned three sequels, ending in 2015 with “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2.” His more recent credits include “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” “The Beekeeper” and the HBO series “I Love L.A.”\n\t\n\n\tIn a recent interview with Variety, Hutcherson said he would happily return to the “Hunger Games” franchise without a second thought.\n\n\t“I would love to be back on set with Francis, with Jen, with Liam, with Woody,” he said. “It would not take any convincing at all. I’d be there in a heartbeat.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet” lands an outstanding cast ensemble nomination at the Actors Awards — the newly renamed Screen Actors Guild Awards — one of the film’s most essential performers will not be recognized alongside his colleagues.\n\n\tThe official ensemble submission lists Jessie Buckley, Paul Mescal, Emily Watson, Joe Alwyn and Noah Jupe as the eligible cast members. Missing is Jacobi Jupe, the young actor whose emotionally resonant turn as the title character has been one of the season’s standout discoveries.\n\t\n\n\tAwards analyst Will Mavity first flagged the exclusion on his X account, noting that despite Jacobi Jupe’s prominence in the film, he was not submitted as part of the ensemble. Mavity shared the film’s official submission, drawing attention to the implications should “Hamnet” earn an ensemble nomination.\n\n\n\tAccording to SAG-AFTRA’s official rules for the outstanding cast category, eligibility is determined strictly by the performers submitted by the film’s producing or distributing entity. The guild outlines the following key requirement: Motion picture cast inclusion requires single-card main title billing.\n\n\tHowever, if an actor shares a title card with other performers, all can be submitted. For example, Chadwick Boseman and Viola Davis shared title cards for “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” and Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande share a title card in both Part 1 and 2 versions of “Wicked.”\n\n\tOnly performers who receive single-card billing in the main titles — or who are otherwise submitted by producers as principal cast — may be included in the ensemble roster.\n\t\n\n\tThis rule means that even though child actors can be nominated as part of an ensemble, they must formally meet the principal cast criteria. If a performer is not included in the initial submission, they cannot be added retroactively once nominations are announced.\n\n\tIn “Hamnet,” Jacobi Jupe does not receive single-card main title billing and shares a card with Olivia Lynes, who plays his twin sister Judith. Bodhi Rae Breathnach, who plays the older Shakespeare daughter Susanna, shares a card with two other actors.\n\n\tInterestingly, Noah Jupe, Jacobi’s real-life older brother, who plays the actor playing Hamlet at the opening of the tragic Shakespeare classic, will be among the nominated ensemble if recognized.\n\n\tNonetheless, Jacobi Jupe, 10, is still eligible — and quietly competitive — in the supporting actor category. The film’s awards strategy positions Paul Mescal as a likely nominee for supporting actor, but Jupe’s performance has earned widespread critical affection and could attract guild support independently of the ensemble race.\n\n\tSAG-AFTRA has historically embraced breakout young performers when they deliver work on par with their adult co-stars, leaving open the possibility that Jacobi Jupe may still find recognition.\n\n\tIf “Hamnet” receives an ensemble nomination without its title character represented, it would spotlight the strategic and contractual complexities behind award submissions — particularly in a film driven by its youngest performer.\n\n\tAs the SAG NomCom voters assess “Hamnet’s” place in the season, the handling of its ensemble and how billing and submission choices operate, could bring to light a much-needed rules update.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndian streaming giant JioHotstar is scaling its South India operations following dramatic audience growth over the past 10 months, with executives detailing the strategic rationale behind the platform’s INR4,000 crore ($445 million) content investment unveiled on Tuesday in Chennai.\n\n\tKrishnan Kutty, head of entertainment for JioHotstar’s South cluster, and Sushant Sreeram, chief marketing officer and head of SVOD business at JioStar, spoke about the behavioral shifts that convinced the platform to significantly expand its regional programming slate.\n\t\n\n\tThe South region – comprising the Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam languages – now accounts for approximately 35% of entertainment watch time and nearly 25% of total entertainment viewership on JioHotstar, according to Kutty. Since the platform’s launch, video views have grown close to 70% while watch time has increased by approximately 160%.\n\n\n\t“Over the last 10 months we have seen sustained behavior shifts across the South,” Kutty says. “Viewers in these markets also spend meaningfully more time with us. They watch roughly 70% more minutes than the national average, explore around 20% more titles and sample a wider range of genres.”\n\n\tConnected TV adoption has particularly strengthened viewing patterns, with close to 45% of viewing in the South now occurring on large screens. The platform currently reaches approximately 400 million users monthly.\n\n\tThe newly announced slate leans heavily on returning seasons, reflecting audience engagement patterns that have emerged as a key performance indicator for the platform. Kutty cited “Heartbeat” as a prime example, noting the series has crossed 100 million hours of watch time and become the biggest long-running JioHotstar special in its category.\n\t\n\n\t“When audiences connect deeply with a story world, they do not treat it as a one-time viewing experience,” Kutty explains. “That behavior has become one of the strongest signals across the last year.”\n\n\tThe platform has observed similar patterns with “Save the Tigers,” “Kerala Crime Files” and “Police Police,” where returning seasons generate both anticipation and repeat viewing. According to Kutty, this consistency matters significantly in a subscription environment, driving retention and strengthening viewing habits.\n\n\t“The more familiar and emotionally resonant the world becomes, the stronger the renewal intent,” he says. “That is why long-running storytelling is not only a creative choice — it is now a core structural pillar of how the slate is being built.”\n\n\tThe platform is also deepening investment in talent-driven originals, including the recently announced “Kaattaan” starring Vijay Sethupathi and “Pharma” featuring Nivin Pauly. Kutty positioned these projects as a natural evolution rather than a strategic pivot.\n\n\t“Our starting point is always the story,” Kutty says. “When a narrative demands a certain emotional scale or storytelling ambition, pairing it with established talent helps it land with immediacy and travel faster across markets.”\n\n\tWith the platform now serving hundreds of millions of users and more than 200 million paid subscribers, Kutty argues there is room for vision-driven, marquee originals that justify scale. He characterizes working with leading talent as a natural next step in building stories that feel distinctive, premium and exportable while staying rooted in local creative strength.\n\n\tThe expanded slate spans crime, legal drama, relationship stories, youth titles and experimental genres. Kutty describes the commissioning approach as grounding the slate in what South audiences consistently value while creating space for ideas that signal where their tastes are heading.\n\n\t“The South viewer today is digital first, highly discerning and confident in engaging with new storytelling styles culturally rooted,” he says. “That gives us room to pair familiar formats with worlds that push creative boundaries.”\n\n\tAccording to Kutty, approximately 75% of this year’s South originals have chosen JioHotstar as their home.\n\t\n\n\t“The stories here are deeply authentic, drawn from lived experiences, genuine emotions, and strong cultural identities,” Kutty says. “Time and again, we see that the most rooted stories often become the most universal.”\n\n\tThe rise of connected TV viewing in the South is directly influencing commissioning decisions, according to Kutty. CTV households show higher repeat viewing and longer session times compared to mobile-only users, reintroducing shared living-room viewing alongside mobile-first digital consumption.\n\n\t“We are now assessing whether a story has the depth, pacing and world building to sustain longer-format viewing and whether it has multi-season potential, because longer arcs and returning formats are performing strongly in CTV households,” Kutty explains.\n\n\tHowever, mobile continues to drive everyday engagement, requiring stories to remain accessible, immediate and easy to enter. Commissioning now balances both behaviors, looking for concepts that can operate across screens — premium enough for the big screen and personal enough for the phone, according to Kutty.\n\n\tFrom a subscription and marketing perspective, Sreeram attributes the South region’s acceleration to clear shifts in audience behavior. The region’s viewers are watching more, exploring more genres and sampling across languages at significantly higher rates.\n\n\t“South users also spend nearly 70% more time on the platform compared to the rest of India, which has been a strong driver of sustained subscription growth,” Sreeram says.\n\n\tA key factor driving subscription momentum is how South stories are traveling across the country, with titles breaking out well beyond their home markets.\n\n\t“As more titles break out, we see a clear flywheel where wider discovery leads to higher engagement which, in turn, strengthens subscription momentum,” Sreeram explains.\n\n\tThe platform’s 2025 strategy is focused on consistency, discovery and scale in response to evolving South viewer behavior. JioHotstar is expanding a significant volume of fresh South programming over the next year while deepening its creator base.\n\n\t“Malayalam films now see more than 80% of their watch time coming from outside Kerala, and titles like ‘Heartbeat’ have crossed 100 million hours of viewing,” Sreeram says. “This nationwide discovery means our slate for 2025 must be designed to move across regions and languages with ease.”\n\t\n\n\tSreeram acknowledges that Tamil and Malayalam audiences behave differently from Telugu and Kannada viewers, requiring tailored approaches that don’t fragment the platform’s unified brand identity.\n\n\t“Tamil and Malayalam viewers are highly exploratory, deeply engaged and respond strongly to culturally rooted, emotionally layered storytelling,” Sreeram says. “Telugu and Kannada audiences lean into scale, energy and high impact formats and often drive some of the biggest breakout moments on the platform.”\n\n\tThe localization occurs through personalization rather than brand fragmentation. Viewers see a surface that is culturally fluent and relevant to their tastes while the overall product experience remains consistent across the country, according to Sreeram.\n\n\t“We keep the brand unified and use data, personalization and design to deliver nuance,” he explains. “The viewer gets an experience that feels tailored without the platform becoming four different products.”\n\n\tCross-market sampling represents sustained loyalty rather than casual discovery, according to Sreeram. JioHotstar now serves 100% of India’s post codes, with South entertainment reaching 99.96% of them. Films including “Lokah Chapter 1: Chandra,” “Mirai,” “Thudarum” and “Tourist Family” have achieved record-breaking or nationwide viewership.\n\n\t“These titles are no longer confined to their home markets; they are becoming national hits,” Sreeram says.\n\n\tThe platform focuses on high-quality dubbing and subtitling that maintain authenticity while opening access. Personalized rows and geo-aware recommendations help viewers discover titles based on tone, theme and interest rather than linguistic familiarity.\n\n\t“Bigg Boss” – the Indian version of the “Big Brother” format – continues as a major cultural engine for the platform, but Sreeram emphasizes that unscripted and scripted programming play different but complementary roles. The platform currently produces four “Bigg Boss” editions across South languages.\n\n\t“‘Bigg Boss’ powers frequency, community and monetization, especially with the scale it commands on Connected TV and through live interactions,” Sreeram says. “Scripted originals build depth, long-term value and renewal intent, with creators returning season after season.”\n\t\n\n\tThe platform is significantly expanding its focus on unscripted content for the South beyond “Bigg Boss.” According to Sreeram, the region has strong appetite for high-impact, participative formats.\n\n\t“‘Bigg Boss’ is only the beginning,” Sreeram says. “The pipeline ahead reflects a clear ambition to grow unscripted [as] one of our core pillar[s] of our entertainment strategy.”\n\n\tThe announced slate includes new unscripted formats “Comedy Cooks,” “Mad for Each Other” and “Second Love,” along with “Roadies” debuting in Telugu, marking the first time the adventure format will be produced for South Indian audiences.\n\n\tEmerging creators are already integrated into how JioHotstar builds its South slate, according to Kutty. More than 500 creators — writers, directors and showrunners across South languages — have joined the JioHotstar ecosystem over the past 10 months, and a significant share of South streaming originals now sits on the platform.\n\n\tViewer behavior reinforces this direction, with audiences in the South watching more titles, exploring more genres and sampling across languages. That curiosity gives newer voices room to build distinctive story worlds alongside established talent, Kutty notes.\n\n\t“So the approach now is structured,” he says. “We are putting clear pathways and development support in place across key South markets to ensure emerging storytellers come into the slate through consistent opportunities, not isolated projects.”\n\n\tThe commissioning strategy follows a logic of building a slate where experienced and emerging creators scale together rather than sequentially, according to Kutty.\n\n\tAs part of its partnership with the Government of Tamil Nadu announced at the Chennai event, JioHotstar will introduce creator-focused initiatives including writing labs, mentorship programs and skill-building workshops aimed at nurturing filmmakers, writers, editors and digital storytellers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBuffalo 8 has secured worldwide rights to “The World’s Happiest Man,” the Bhutanese-Nepali-American drama starring Oscar and Emmy nominee Bruce Dern. A trailer has been unveiled. \n\n\tDern (“Nebraska,” “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”) stars alongside Nepali stalwarts Haribansha Acharya and Dayahang Rai in the ensemble drama from writer-director Binod Paudel. The cast also includes Aditi Pyakurel, Joes Pandey, Richa Ghimire, Pooja Chand, Anuradha Majumder, Bimal Subedi, Gurpreet Singh and Tom Crain.\n\t\n\n\tSet in Akron, Ohio, the film centers on Bishnu, a Bhutanese Nepali who has built a new life in America but dreams of returning to Bhutan one final time.

Paudel produced alongside Rajendra Thakurathi, Amitabh Joshi, Kirtana Banskota and Abeeral Thapa. L.N. Adhikari, Kaushila Karmacharya, Ramesh Bhatta and Apaar Shrestha serve as executive producers.\n\n\tBuffalo 8 will handle the launch across TVOD and digital platforms, with a broader international rollout planned through early 2026.\n\n\tThe film will be available for pre-order on Fandango at Home starting Dec. 26, ahead of its Jan. 9, 2026, on-demand release in the U.S. The film will debut on Amazon, Fandango at Home, Verizon Fios and major cable providers, with additional territories and platforms to follow. \n\t\n\n\tWatch the trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

Even though Virgil had an unlimited drink package, Haynes still says there's gotta be limits!\n      \n\n          According to the lawsuit, Michael's drunken search for his family was fruitless ... which made him so agitated he ripped off his shirt and broke down doors.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          Haynes tells us ... security guards were summoned and put their full body weight on Virgil, \"asphyxiating\" him for approximately 3 minutes. That, coupled with all the booze in his system along with sedatives, caused Virgil's death, according to Haynes and the L.A. County Medical Examiner's report. Haynes underscored that Virgil's death \"had echoes of George Floyd.\"\n      \n    \n          The suit goes on to say Virgil fell victim to \"the excessive force and fatal actions taken by crew members,\" who \"administered an injection of a sedative medication, Haloperidol, and used multiple cans of pepper spray.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          What's more, Haynes says Royal Caribbean refused to turn over surveillance video to see who served Virgil all the alcohol.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The FBI launched an investigation, Haynes says, but the current status of the probe is unclear. We've reached out to Royal Caribbean and the FBI for comment ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      ",

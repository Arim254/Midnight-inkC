    "body": "\n\tJulia Louis-Dreyfus revealed on Amy Poehler’s “Good Hang” podcast that she felt “backed into a corner” when she publicly disclosed her breast cancer diagnosis in 2017. At the time, HBO’s “Veep” was preparing for its seventh and final season, but production was delayed while Louis-Dreyfus underwent chemotherapy.\n\n\tOn the Dec. 9 episode of the “Good Hang” podcast, host Poehler praised Louis-Dreyfus for being open about her diagnosis, saying the disclosure was “very helpful for a lot of people.” But Louis-Dreyfus explained that going public wasn’t entirely her choice.\n\t\n\n\t“I was kind of backed into a corner on that one because we had to shut our show down,” the “Veep” star said. “It’s funny how that worked out, because normally I would not have done that. I’m very private.”\n\n\n\tLouis-Dreyfus played Selina Meyer on “Veep” from 2012 to 2019, earning six consecutive Emmys for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series.\n\n\tAccording to Louis-Dreyfus, who also served as an executive producer, production on the final season of the HBO series had to shut down “for a year” so she could undergo chemotherapy. “Two hundred fifty people weren’t going to be working,” she added, “so I had to make a public thing about it.”\n\n\tEven though she had reservations, Louis-Dreyfus said she’s ultimately glad she shared her diagnosis because it allowed her to connect with others who were also battling cancer.\n\n\t“The good thing about doing that was that I did have this incredible experience of people reaching out to me asking me for, you know, asking me about my experience going through breast cancer, for advice,” she said. “And I was able to help and there was something unbelievably comforting about being able to do that on the other side of this trauma.”\n\t\n\n\tLouis-Dreyfus was diagnosed with breast cancer in September 2017. She announced the news on Twitter (now X), writing, “1 in 8 women get breast cancer. Today, I’m the one.”\n\n\t“The good news is that I have the most glorious group of supportive and caring family and friends,” she added. “The bad news is that not all women are so lucky, so let’s fight all cancers and make universal health care a reality.”\n\n\tWatch Louis-Dreyfus’ full interview on the “Good Hang” podcast below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\t“South Park” is closing out its 28th season with a finale that’s already stirring anticipation among fans eager to see where Trey Parker and Matt Stone steer the long-running Comedy Central staple next. The episode caps a months-long run that’s kept the show in the cultural discourse nearly three decades after its debut.\n\n\tThe finale will air on Comedy Central on Wednesday, Dec. 10 at 10 p.m. ET/PT, but cable-cutters can stream the episode on live TV streamers such as Philo, DirecTV, Sling TV and Hulu + Live TV. The finale will also be available on Paramount+ the following day, Thursday, Dec. 11, at 6 a.m. ET. \n\n\n\tSeason 28 has continued to lean heavily into topical political satire. Storylines have included poking at election-year identity politics, TikTok conspiracy spirals, tech-driven paranoia and even a sendup of prestige television, with the boys navigating everything from Cartman weaponizing AI-generated audio to Randy trying (and failing) to reposition Tegridy Farms for the influencer era. One midseason episode about algorithm-curated dating apps drew particular attention online for hitting uncomfortably close to home for viewers chronically glued to their feeds. \n\n\tThe closure of Season 28 follows Trey Parker and Matt Stone signing a new five-year deal with Paramount earlier this year, inclusive of 50 new episodes plus all seasons of the show becoming available to stream on Paramount+ for the first time.Until then, “South Park” had been streaming on HBO Max, although Paramount+ has aired several “South Park” specials over the last few years.  Season 28 has to aired on a weekly basis on Comedy Central, with new episodes becoming available to stream the next day on Paramount+.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tLive TV streaming service Sling is introducing a limited-time discount as part of a new promotion for the holidays. Right now, the service’s Sling Orange & Blue plan is available from just $33 a month, a 50% discount off the regular $65.99+ monthly subscription price.\n\n\tThe combined Blue and Orange package comes with access to more than 50 channels, with AMC, ESPN, Disney Channel, Freeform, TBS and TNT on Sling Orange; and Bravo, E!, FX, TLC, USA, FS1 and NFL Network, among others on Sling Blue. Subscribers can also livestream local networks online like ABC, FOX and NBC, and access hundreds of on-demand movies and TV shows through the Sling website or app.\n\n\n\tWorth noting: the $33 price on the combined Orange & Blue plan is currently cheaper than the Sling Orange plan on its own, which costs $45.99/month. Prices were live as of this writing and as with all Sling promotions, are subject to change at any time.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBEST DEAL\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSling Orange & Blue Plan\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tSling’s plans let you stream live TV from your phone, computer, tablet and TV through the Sling app. Sling Orange + Blue subscribers can also stream on up to four devices at the same time (Sling Blue customers can stream on up to three devices, while Sling Orange members can only watch on one device at a time).\n\n\tThere are no long-term contracts and customers can change their channel lineup anytime. DVR is also included to let you watch replays of your favorite programs, along with thousands of on-demand shows and movies. The current offer sincludes 50 hours of free cloud DVR.\n\n\tThis is the best Sling TV deal we’re seeing online but you’ll want to hurry: this Sling sale is a limited-time offer and it’s expected to end soon. The fine print: the 50% off Sling discount applies to your first month of service only, though you can cancel at anytime.\n\n\n\tSling is one of the best all-around streaming services online with great options for sports fans, news junkies and more.\n\t\n\t\tDoes Sling Have a Free Trial?\t\n\n\tWhile Sling has offered a free trial in the past, the streamer does not currently have any free trial offers available. Still, with plans starting from just $33 a month, it’s by far one of the cheapest — and best — way to start streaming live TV online.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDavid Letterman sat down for an interview on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and came out swinging against Donald Trump, who is often the subject of ridicule during Jimmy Kimmel’s monologues. Letterman defended Kimmel and anyone’s right to mock Trump because the U.S. president is such a “fool.”\n\n\t“Speaking of leaders, let me just say one thing here. Irrespective of party or political ideology—if the leader of the free world is a fool, the leader of the free world, then, should expect and examine every bit of ridicule he receives,” Letterman said in a blatant nod to Trump as the audience roared with approval.\n\t\n\n\tLetterman joined Kimmel for an interview a few days after the late-night host extended his ABC late-night deal for another year, thus keeping “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on the air through 2027. The news was widely celebrated in Hollywood after Disney suspended Kimmel and took him off the air earlier this year due to quips about Charlie Kirk’s shooter and after continued calls from Trump for ABC to permanently cancel Kimmel.\n\n\n\t “Another year is twisting those folks at Disney,” Letterman told Kimmel. “Good for you!”\n\n\tKimmel continued to take aim at Trump a few hours after his ABC deal extension was announced. The late-night host chided Trump for hosting the Kennedy Center Honors, where Trump called Kimmel a “horrible” TV host.\n\n\t“He’s been boasting about hosting, saying, ‘We’ve never had a president host the Kennedy Center Honors before,’ which, yeah, why do you think that is?” Kimmel asked. “We’ve also never had Neil Patrick Harris order a military strike on a fishing boat before.”\n\t\n\n\tLetterman was a late-night host for 33 years, first on NBC’s “Late Night” and then on CBS’ “Late Show.” He told Kimmel that he is pleased not to be on the air in the age of Trump.\n\n\t“No, I’m so glad to be out from under this mess, because people like you and people by like Stephen [Colbert] and people like Seth [Meyers] do such a masterful job of this, defending democracy,” Letterman said. “Thank God for you, thank God for others, ‘SNL,’ and everybody else. It’s just, I think it’s the way things need to be, in a democracy that’s seemingly this crippled.”\n\n\tWatch Letterman’s full interview on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmanda Seyfried told Who What Wear on her press tour for “The Testament of Ann Lee” that she refuses to apologize for calling Charlie Kirk “hateful” after the Turning Point USA co-founder was shot and killed earlier this year. \n\n\t“I’m not fucking apologizing for that,” Seyfried said. “I mean, for fuck’s sake, I commented on one thing. I said something that was based on actual reality and actual footage and actual quotes. What I said was pretty damn factual, and I’m free to have an opinion, of course. Thank God for Instagram. I was able to give some clarity, and it was about getting my voice back because I felt like it had been stolen and recontextualized—which is what people do, of course.”\n\t\n\n\tKirk, a 31-year-old conservative activist, was fatally shot in the neck on Sept. 10 during a college speaking event in Utah. Seyfried originally commented on Kirk’s death by writing: “He was hateful.” The statement ignited accusations from some conservatives online that Seyfried was implying Kirk’s death was justified. Quite the contrary. She responded to the backlash in a standalone Instagram post.\n\n\n\t“I don’t want to add fuel to a fire. I just want to be able to give clarity to something so irresponsibly (but understandably) taken out of context. Spirited discourse – isn’t that what we should be having?” Seyfried wrote in the post’s caption.\n\n\t“We’re forgetting the nuance of humanity,” she went on to explain. “I can get angry about misogyny and racist rhetoric and ALSO very much agree that Charlie Kirk’s murder was absolutely disturbing and deplorable in every way imaginable. No one should have to experience this level of violence. This country is grieving too many senseless and violent deaths and shootings. Can we agree on that at least?”\n\t\n\n\tSeyfried was one of many Hollywood figures in September who both condemned Kirk’s shooting death while also publicly disagreeing with his politics. Jamie Lee Curtis fought back tears on Marc Maron’s “WTF” podcast when discussing Kirk.\n\n\t“I disagreed with him on almost every point I ever heard him say, but I believe he was a man of faith, and I hope in that moment when he died, that he felt connected with his faith,” Curtis said\n\n\tHead over to Who What Wear’s website to read Seyfried’s interview in its entirety.\n",

Discovery enters into — so that the news network is no longer under the current management team.\n\n\tTrump’s comments signal that he may be opposed to Netflix’s blockbuster deal with Warner Bros. and in favor of Paramount Skydance’s rival offer.\n\t\n\n\tUnder Netflix’s $82.7 billion deal with Warner Bros. Discovery, the streaming giant would acquire WB’s studios and HBO Max — but not any of WBD’s TV networks, which would be spun off into a new entity (dubbed Discovery Global) to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders. Paramount Skydance, headed by David Ellison, launched a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety, including CNN and WBD’s other cable networks.\n\n\n\tTrump, speaking Wednesday at a White House meeting, told reporters that as part of “any deal” for Warner Bros. Discovery, it “should be guaranteed and certain that CNN is part of it or sold separately.” The president said, “I think I think CNN should be sold because I think the people that are running CNN right now” are “either corrupt or incompetent.” Trump said he didn’t want the current CNN management to be rewarded by being allowed to continue running the network “with money” from a deal.\n\n\t“I don’t think the people that are running that company right now and running CNN, which is a very dishonest group of people, I don’t think that should be allowed to continue,” Trump said. “I think CNN should be sold along with everything else.”\n\t\n\n\t“I think the people that have run CNN for the last, long period of time are a disgrace,” Trump said. “I think it’s imperative that CNN be sold, because you certainly wouldn’t want to put people, just leave those people with some money, good money, and CNN, so that they can spend even more money spreading poison, because it’s lies. It’s a disgrace.”\n\n\tA CNN spokesperson declined to comment on Trump’s remarks. Warner Bros. Discovery did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\tDuring Trump’s first term, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner on antitrust grounds. A federal judge ruled in favor of the companies and in February 2019 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision. The DOJ lawsuit was reportedly motivated by Trump’s dislike of CNN. \n\n\tTrump, at the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington, D.C., Sunday said he would be “involved” in the review of the Netflix-WB deal. Historically, U.S. presidents have not been officially part of any regulatory review process of an M&A transaction.\n\n\tTrump, asked Monday at a White House briefing with reporters if he was in favor of Paramount’s rival bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, he responded, “I don’t know enough about it,” saying he has to look at how each proposed deal would impact Netflix and Paramount Skydance’s market share. Trump added, “I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine. You know, I want to do what’s right.” Trump was asked if the involvement of Affinity Partners, the investment firm of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, in backing the Paramount bid would influence the his opinion; Trump responded, “I’ve never spoken with him” about Paramount’s WBD bid.\n\n\tIn the past, Trump has boasted about his friendship with David Ellison and his father, the ultrawealthy tech mogul Larry Ellison. But on Monday, he lashed out at the Ellisons over a “60 Minutes” interview on CBS with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia), the one-time Trump supporter who has recently criticized the president on a range of issues. Trump complained in a Truth Social post that since the Ellisons bought Paramount, “60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGliding effortlessly from teen comedy to poignant social drama and all the way back and around again, “The World of Love” is a near-flawless triumph for South Korean filmmaker Yoon Ga-eun. Featuring a sensational lead performance by newcomer Seo Su-bin, Yoon’s first feature in six years is a beautifully constructed portrait of a 17-year-old high schooler who’s the funniest and most vivacious girl in class — and also a survivor of sexual assault. Expertly balancing its lighter and darker themes while unfolding with almost documentary-like realism, “The World of Love” rings achingly true at every humorous and heartbreaking turn.  \n\t\n\n\tReleased domestically on Oct. 22 following its world premiere in Toronto, “The World of Love” is the Korean indie success story of 2025. With 165,000 admissions to date, it has also won the best picture prize at the Korean Film Producers Association Awards. Certain to continue a highly successful festival run that’s delivered the Fipresci Prize at Warsaw and People’s Choice and jury awards at Pingyao, the film has thus far secured distribution deals in France and the key Asian markets of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and China, where it is in line to become the first Korean film since “Oh! My Gran” (2020) to receive an official Chinese theatrical release. \n\n\n\tIn addition to being wonderfully rewarding entertainment, “The World of Love” has great value as an awareness raiser and public conversation starter on the extremely urgent topic of child sexual abuse, and how shockingly widespread it is. The key to the film’s remarkable appeal is an uplifting and hopeful spirit that carries viewers along without ever diminishing or undercutting its examination of how trauma affects the lives of survivors.  \n\t\n\n\tThat spirit is alive from the moment we meet Lee Joo-in (Seo), a popular, confident and boisterous girl who loves to gossip and laugh with her girlfriends about everything from menstruation and tampons to her famously high turnover of boyfriends. The happy teen lives with her mother, Tae-sun (Jang Hye-jin, “Parasite”), a childcare center owner who drinks more than she should, and kid brother Hae-in (Lee Jae-hee). A delightfully cheeky young chap who enjoys giving impromptu magic shows, Hae-in also intercepts mail addressed to his sister for reasons that are deeply moving when revealed late in the running. Despite the absence of her father, who moved out three years ago and won’t answer Joo-in’s simple text messages, this is a warm home full of laughter and love.    \n\n\tThe tone of the film’s opening half-hour is overwhelmingly upbeat and thoroughly engaging. In unhurried observations of Joo-in’s life, we see the bright and bouncy girl having funny conversations with her mother that are more like sister-to-sister gabfests. She visits her taekwondo academy for enthusiastic workouts and lends a hand with a local community volunteer group alongside Mi-do (Go Min-si), a woman in her early 20s who was once a teenage runaway and is cherished by Joo-in as her “life mentor.”\n\n\tThe catalyst for Joo-in’s trauma to resurface is a petition brought to school by male classmate Su-ho (Kim Jeong-sik). As the primary carer for his infant sister who attends Tae-sun’s day care center, Su-ho is concerned about the release from jail of a child sex offender and wants to prevent him from returning to live in the local area. Unwilling to sign like everyone else, Joo-in loudly says she will only add her name if a sentence describing how “sexual assault completely destroys a person’s life” is removed from the petition. It is not long after this classroom flashpoint that Joo-in starts receiving anonymous notes accusing her of being stupid and desperately seeking attention.\n\n\tAs these letters continue and become more unsettling, Joo-in impulsively tells her class she is a survivor of sexual assault. This may not come as a surprise to viewers, but its raw power is shocking nonetheless. Unlike those described in Su-ho’s petition, Joo-in says her life has not been destroyed, and she will not be defined by this traumatic incident. \n\t\n\n\tYoon exercises masterful tonal control over sensitive material — which includes a brief yet immensely powerful sequence showing the cycle of abuse — as Joo-in struggles to maintain her bright and bouncy personality while confronting the emotional scars of her past. The detailed groundwork laid prior to her revelation pays off handsomely with relationships and perceptions altered as new information is revealed and important events from both the recent past and much earlier are re-evaluated. Yoon never amps anything up or imposes unnecessary urgency on this story. It is utterly compelling and affecting precisely because it unfolds at a perfectly measured pace and is filmed and edited more like a fly-on-the-wall documentary than a conventional narrative drama.\n\n\tWith an unerring eye for how people actually live, speak and act, Yoon ensures that humor still plays a role. Dotted throughout Joo-in’s frequently painful and confusing journey of self-discovery are delightful scenes, such as guffawing at the erotic drawings of her bestie Yura (Kang Chae-yun) and amusing moments of awkward smooching, awkward hot-then-cold sexual fumbling and sweetly innocent fun hanging out with on-again-off-again boyfriend Chan-woo (Kim Ye-chang).\n\n\tHow Joo-in copes and doesn’t cope with navigating her way through this passage of her young life is brought to the screen with tremendous conviction by Seo. From being brave and strong to being illogical and making mistakes and misjudgements that risk friendships — just as teenagers do — Seo’s emotional range is simply amazing and ensures audiences are firmly by her side all the way. Her astonishing scene inside a car as Joo-in and her mother go through a car wash is bound to be the film’s most talked about. Yoon’s masterstroke here is placing the camera on the backseat and giving the audience the point of view of fellow passengers witnessing the most intimate and shattering of moments between a mother and her daughter.\n\n\tNoted for her ability to elicit remarkable performances from child actors in the highly regarded features “The World of Us” (2016) and “The House of Us” (2019), Yoon enhances her reputation with outstanding direction of young cast members here,  many of whom have little or no previous film experience. Yoon must surely now be ranked among the very finest of South Korea’s contemporary filmmakers. Jang Hye-jin, who appeared in both of Yoon’s previous features, also gives one of her best performances as the mother who must find a way to not be consumed by guilt she cannot help but feel, regardless of specific circumstances.\n\t\n\n\tNot every story thread is wrapped up neatly and no such packaging is required for a tale that is all about finding yourself among all the loose ends and frayed strands of life. Instead, Yoon closes her film with a magnificently imagined and executed sequence that reaches deeply into our individual hearts and into the soul of our shared humanity. It’s a moment of true perfection in cinematic storytelling.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for the first two episodes of “Percy Jackson and the Olympians” Season 2.\n\n\tThe “Percy Jackson” fandom is known for being especially sensitive to on-screen changes from the book series written by Rick Riordan — as evidenced by their outright rejection of the two “Percy Jackson” movies that 20th Century Fox made in the 2010s. But with the Disney+ series “Percy Jackson and the Olympians,” which launched its first season in December 2023, Riordan and his team of writers struck a balance between honoring the middle-grade novels that fans loved while making adjustments to help the story feel fresh as it entered a visual medium. Among both critics and viewers, the season was judged to have done that successfully. That work continues in the newly released second season, which is based on Riordan’s 2006 novel “The Sea of Monsters” and features some noticeable changes from the beginning.\n\t\n\n\tThe season opens with Grover (Aryan Simhadri) out in the wilderness searching for the lost god Pan, as he set out to do at the end of Season 1. On his search, he runs into some familiar faces from Camp Half-Blood, but he quickly realizes they’re foes, not friends — they’ve joined up with Luke Castellan (Charlie Bushnell) on his fight to take down the gods of Olympus and serve the titan god Kronos. But there’s a more immediate danger: A giant tentacled monster approaches and pulls Grover into the sea.\n\n\n\tPercy (Walker Scobell) is finishing out the school year in New York City where he lives with his mom, Sally (Virginia Kull) — plus Tyson (Daniel Diemer), a young Cyclops whom Sally met and has allowed to live with them. While Percy and Tyson are walking to school, Annabeth (Leah Sava Jeffries) appears in a magical cab driven by the Gray Sisters (Sandra Bernhard, Margaret Cho and Kristen Schaal). She’s been having dreams about Camp Half-Blood being in danger, so the group drives there with the Gray Sisters, who give them a set of numbers Percy later realizes are the coordinates to Grover’s location. At camp, they’re attacked by Laestrygonian giants. During the fight, Annabeth, a hater of Cyclopes, reluctantly permits Tyson to cross the boundary that keeps monsters out of camp, while Clarisse (Dior Goodjohn) and her team of warriors fight off the Laestrygonians.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLeah Sava Jeffries as Annabeth Chase\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen they enter camp, however, they find that Luke has stabbed a poison-laced dagger into the magical tree that upholds the protective boundary. It’s a major betrayal of everyone at camp, especially because that tree contains the soul of his old friend; Thalia, the demigod daughter of Zeus, once sacrificed herself to save Luke and Annabeth from monsters and Zeus turned her into the tree so she would live on somehow. Luke gets away, then Percy and Annabeth are apprehended by Tantalus (Timothy Simons), the new camp director after Chiron (Glynn Turman) was fired for being a son of Kronos. Tantalus wants to kill Tyson until a trident materializes above Tyson’s head, revealing that he is a son of Poseidon (Toby Stephens) and a half-brother to Percy.\n\n\tWith the camp’s protective border being weakened, it becomes clear that someone needs to travel to the Sea of Monsters to obtain the Golden Fleece, the only thing that can save Thalia’s tree. Conveniently, that’s also where Grover is located. Though Tantalus chooses to send Clarisse on the quest to find it, Percy, Annabeth and Tyson set off on an unsanctioned quest of their own as the second episode closes.\n\n\tRiordan and executive producers Jon Steinberg, Dan Shotz and Craig Silverstein spoke with Variety to break down the ways they saved time, upped the stakes and deepened the relationships at the beginning of “The Sea of Monsters.”\n\n\t(Note: Riordan was interviewed separately from Steinberg, Shotz and Silverstein.)\n\t\n\t\tIn the book, the Mist that keeps mortals from being able to see monsters also keeps Percy from realizing that Tyson is a Cyclops at first, but in the show, Percy already knows at the beginning of Season 2. What was behind that change?\t\n\n\tRick Riordan: We have to look at ways we can tell the story more efficiently, especially at the beginning. How do we get into the story quickly and still have the same impact? We compressed a pretty great deal from the first few chapters. We’re heading in the same direction. We’re getting to the same point, just a little bit quicker.\n\n\tCraig Silverstein: It was about understanding the idea of the Mist. Now that Percy’s been able to see monsters for what they are, why can’t he see Tyson? There’s not a great reason for it, and the revelation of Tyson doesn’t change that much. He’s still this kid who has stayed at his house, who his mom brought in. He still has to take care of him. It seemed like a smart and efficient change when you’re trying to get everything into 40 minutes.\n\t\n\n\tDan Shotz: And we wanted to launch the trio right away — the new trio, now that Grover is missing. This is our group for the season, and we wanted to have that happen as fast as possible.\n\t\n\t\tSimilarly, Luke is shown stabbing and poisoning Thalia’s tree in the Season 2 premiere, whereas in the books, Chiron is suspected of being the assailant, and it isn’t revealed to be Luke until toward the end of the book. Walk me through that choice.\t\n\n\tRiordan: There is something valuable, in the TV version, about seeing that moment in real time. It’s powerful. It immediately makes you understand the stakes when Luke and Percy lock eyes with each other. The challenge is issued right from the beginning. It’s not as slow burn a mystery as it was in the book, but I think it’s an effective way to tell that story in the new medium.\n\n\tSilverstein: When you’re doing the screen adaptation of anything, you want to see it on screen. You want to see your hero and your antagonist face each other, so it was important to see Luke — and Blackjack [the Pegasus he’s riding].\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCharlie Bushnell as Luke\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAs a result, Zeus fires Chiron simply for being a son of Kronos, instead of for poisoning the tree. As Percy points out, Zeus is also a son of Kronos, so these changes seem to add an extra ragey, unreasonable quality to Zeus. What were you trying to say with that relationship?\t\n\n\tRiordan: I have to admit, I don’t know that I’ve thought about it in that way, but you’re right. It does feel more capricious, more ill-considered on Zeus’ part. That goes along very well with the themes we’re exploring in the second season. And Luke, even though he’s our antagonist, he’s not wrong. He has a point: The gods can be really, really terrible parents, and not the greatest leaders. So that does underscore sympathy for the enemy here. Who’s on the right side? I think it’s OK that viewers may have some very mixed feelings about who’s the hero here. \n\n\tSilverstein: It’s the rage and the hypocrisy of the gods. Your hero and your antagonist are uncomfortably on the same page about some things.\n\n\t\n\t\tThere’s certainly tension between Percy and Annabeth at the start of “The Sea of Monsters,” but it’s mostly about Annabeth’s dislike of Cyclopes. On screen, deeper personal wounds come to light. They’re upset at each other how disconnected they started feeling during their year apart, and about the details they both left out of their letters. Knowing where the two of them end up, how were you approaching their relationship at this point in the series?\t\n\n\tRiordan: As the kids say, it hits different when it’s on the screen. Seeing it visually just has a bigger impact, so I have learned to be cognizant that a moment I describe in writing may come across as much more powerful — and maybe too powerful — if it were shown the same way on screen. So we have a lot of conversations about, “What is this going to look like when the characters are interacting with each other? What’s the attitude that they have toward each other?” It’s important that we honor the source material story, in that Percy and Annabeth’s relationship is a very slow burn, and we’re not going to get there right away. It’s delayed gratification. Are they going to be more than friends? We don’t know, and that’s not going to be answered for quite a while. However, their friendship is deepening and being tested in new ways, and it’s even more powerful to see that in the second season. \n\n\tAnd, oh, boy, wait till you see the third season.\n\n\n\tShotz: We wanted to set up what happens with every kid. As they have a year away and come back, they’ve changed. They’ve had new life experiences. She has never been out in the real world in the last five years, and this experience has really been challenging for her, and it’s really hard to talk about. As they’re trying to reconnect after a year, all those bonds are shifting. The connection she was hoping to have with her father out in the real world wasn’t quite what Percy promised. Now, coming back together, they’re really in different places, and they have to find a new way of working together and being partners of the story. Because as you’re going to see for the whole season, this is really the Percy-Annabeth story. They’re together in this journey and have a pretty amazing arc as they face all of these trials at the Sea of Monsters.\n\t\n\t\tEven though it’s still a slow burn, in Season 1 there were slightly more hints about a future romance for Percy and Annabeth than there were in the books. There are a few hugs, and a few accidentally flirtatious comments. At this point in the story, in the TV version, do you think Percy and Annabeth are aware that they have crushes on each other? Or are they too overwhelmed by the complications of their friendship and the monsters they’re fighting to realize?\t\n\n\tRiordan: It is skewed a bit by the fact that the actors are growing up — and there’s not much we can do about that. We just have to keep going as at the pace we can go. But seeing them be as as much older as they are from Season 1, and then again in Season 3, it does skew our understanding of what might be going on in their heads. My guess is that they are still so conflicted, so much in crisis mode. Also, people that are potentially thinking about being in a relationship can have an incredible level of denial about what’s actually going on. I think there’s a lot of denial going on. A lot of fear. “There’s so much already on our plate. I can’t even think to go there right now.”\n\t\n\n\tJon Steinberg: There are things that happen visually that don’t need dialogue to come across, or that will come across no matter how much dialogue you apply to try to deny or resist it. There are a lot of reasons why this feels like a story worth telling. The relationship between those two kids, to me, is pretty central. From the outset: Two kids who have never met anybody like themselves, who find that they’re a lot less lonely when they’re around each other, is a really engaging and emotionally resonant story. What’s really interesting about about pushing them into this next adventure is that those relationships don’t stay heartwarming and easy. They get complicated, especially when you’re 13, 14, 15 years old. Engaging with that and making the hard moments of that friendship is just as important as the as the easy ones. It’s something I’m really proud of with the show.\n\t\n\t\tIn the book, Clarisse gets sent on the Sea of Monsters quest alone, and Percy, Annabeth and Tyson go rogue by starting their own quest. They go rogue here too — except Annabeth is initally set to join Clarisse without Percy, making Percy worry she’s betraying him somehow. Talk to me about how you wrote those scenes. \t\n\n\tSilverstein: It’s all just a dramatic escalation of the basic tension, just pushing it up and up. In Episode 2, the climax of that was the confrontation on the beach between them, which was born out of, interestingly enough, a production challenge. That episode was written differently. In the book, the harpies [winged spirits who serve as cleaning staff at camp and eat campers if they sneak out] come with to stop them from leaving, and we got nervous about the way the harpies were going to come off. The idea  was that it would be this confrontation between Annabeth and Percy bringing the real fireworks.\n\n\tShotz: And at the end of Episode 2, we’re sort of launching them on the quest, and you don’t want everything to be all perfect between them. There are things they are going to have to work through as they go to C.C.’s, as they have to deal with Clarisse, as all the stakes happen on Polyphemus’ island. Everything, as it moves forward, is a trial for their relationship. Not just trials of stakes for the larger mythology and story, but for Percy and Annabeth and how they’re going to come together.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Diemer as Tyson\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSince Grover is gone for much of “The Sea of Monsters,” we lose the slightly older peacekeeper and voice of reason in the trio. Instead, we have Tyson, who is loyal and strong but also pretty naive, which puts more responsibility on Percy and Annabeth. How did his introduction affect you as you wrote Season 2? \n\t\n\n\tRiordan: Tyson is such a hard part to to get right. Daniel Diemer was a gift. He just has the right energy: He’s a big brother, but he’s also got a sweetness and a vulnerability to him that makes him someone you want to wrap a quilt around and feed cookies to. But he’s also got this incredible power. He adds a lot, and he adds it very quickly. At the beginning, viewers should be thinking to themselves, “Wait a minute. Where’s my trio? Who’s this new guy?” But that’s the way the story should be. We made this group, and now we’re breaking it up to see what happens when they don’t have the trio together. What happens when you have Tyson instead, who Annabeth doesn’t trust and Percy’s got mixed feelings about too? Daniel brings a sympathy and a feeling of quiet strength to this group, and it really helps that he’s just a lovely person in real life.\n\n\tSilverstein: Ultimately, he doesn’t intend to be, but he becomes another thing between Percy and Annabeth that’s giving them trouble reconnecting. She has to let him into the barrier, but she’s warned Percy that he can’t enter. She comes and tries to talk to Percy [in his cabin on their first night at camp], and he’s dealing with Tyson. Tyson doesn’t mean to be a problem for them. And Grover would know exactly how to make this relationship blossom. But Tyson becomes an extra responsibility that they need to balance when they head out into the world. And how do you balance different kinds of friend groups against each other? How are Tyson and Grover ever going to get along if they manage to get Grover back? There’s all these questions, but that’s what happens when you grow up. You add friends. New people come in, and you gotta figure out how to work them in with your besties,\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSZA is the latest artist to slam the White House for using one of her songs in a pro-ICE ad, calling it “evil” and “boring.”\n\n\tThe singer reacted on Twitter after the White House used “Big Boy,” originally aired as part of an SNL sketch in December 2022, in a social media post earlier this week. “White House rage baiting artists for free promo is PEAK DARK ..inhumanity +shock and aw tactics,” she wrote. “Evil n Boring.”\n\n\n\tThe White House used the viral tune to promote the actions of ICE, tweeting a video that showed agents arresting immigrants. “We heard it’s cuffing szn,” posted the White House, a reference to the song’s lyrics. “Bad news for criminal illegal aliens. Great news for America.”\n\t\n\n\tSZA‘s manager Punch also seemed to address the White House post, writing on X, “Trying to provoke [artists] to respond in order to help spread propaganda and political agendas is nasty business. Knock it off.”\n\n\tIn a statement to Variety, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson commented, “Thank you, SZA, for drawing even more attention to the tremendous work America’s ICE officers are doing by arresting dangerous criminal illegal aliens from American communities.”\n\n\n\tSZA joins a growing list of artists who have spoken out against the White House for repurposing their songs for posts. Last week, Sabrina Carpenter slammed Donald Trump’s administration for using her hit song “Juno” in a video montage depicting ICE raids. “This video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda,” she wrote on social media.\n\t\n\n\tShortly after deleting the initial X post, the White House posted another clip of Carpenter doing an SNL commercial with the audio overdubbed so that it appears to be calling cast member Marcello Hernández “illegal” instead of “hot.”\n",

One of the men is seen screaming at Andy to \"wake up\" while the other administers a shot of Narcan -- a life-saving medication used to reverse the effects of opioid overdoses.\n      \n    \n          Andy kicked off Wednesday's interview by telling our cameraman he's now \"100 percent fine.\" Then he changed his answer to \"110 percent,\" while flanked on either side by his buddies -- both of whom were featured in the overdose video.\n      \n\n          Our cameraman then asked what happened Tuesday and Andy let one of his friends take center stage. The dude starts talking about the day, and then Andy cuts him off when the convo turns to one of his other down-on-his-luck friends ... who he says he'd just met at the time.\n      \n    \n          Andy said he sat down next to the guy who whipped out some crack and, from that point forward, everything went downhill. Andy said he needed \"a little bit of that,\" referring to the crack. Andy then delivered this stunning quote, \"I don't mind doing some crack every now and then.\"\n      \n    \n          Someone get Andy some help now!!!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Andy Dick\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Drugs & Alcohol\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

But we have a security gate and armed guards and its possible this deterred something more serious.\"\n      \n\n          Well, we reached out to authorities ... and the Berkeley County Sheriff's Office tells us a man who identified himself as a security guard for Pool reported shots fired at the house after seeing a gray sedan circle the property multiple times during the day. Authorities went to the house and cleared the call.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Later on, officers say they asked Pool for video footage from the property ... but, they say they've been denied. As a result, the \"reports of shots fired at this residence cannot be substantiated at this time.\"\n      \n    \n          We reached out to Pool ... and, he tells us, \"We were advised not to release [the footage] as it will compromise security, exposing property, personnel, and our security measures.\" Tim also invited TMZ to West Virginia to view the footage.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          BTW ... people on social media are raking Pool over the coals because of this incident ... claiming the dude made it up for clout, but he's insisting it did happen -- and, obviously, we know his team reported the incident. He's also resharing posts from other social media stars to back him up.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Shootings\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                          \n                Police\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

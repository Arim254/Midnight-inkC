    "body": "\n\tSpotify has announced plans to bring music videos to its platform in the United States following a beta launch overseas last year.\n\n\tA spokesperson for Spotify confirmed to Variety that the company plans to integrate music videos in the coming weeks. On platform, users will be able to switch between audio and video with the tap of a button. It’s unclear if the feature will be available to all subscriber tiers or just Premium users, as the overseas launch was rolled out to the latter.\n\t\n\n\tNews of the product feature expansion comes just a day after Spotify signed an audiovisual direct-licensing pact with the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA), launching an opt-in portal for NMPA members to enter into licensing agreements for expanded AV rights in the States. Spotify previously struck licensing agreements referencing audiovisual rights with Universal, Warner and Sony.\n\n\n\tIn March 2024, the streaming service began rolling out music videos in beta across 12 markets including the U.K., Germany and Italy, along with a limited catalog of visuals from Ed Sheeran, Doja Cat and Ice Spice. The company expanded its rollout to 85 additional markets in Oct. 2024, giving access to videos from Charli xcx, Fontaines D.C., Lisa and more.\n\n\tThe beta launch of music videos was far from Spotify’s first foray into the video market. Dating back to 2015, the streamer was striking deals with Comedy Central and ESPN to bring short-form content and podcasts to the service. Podcast video has grown significantly over the past few years — in July 2020, Spotify launched its first set of “vodcasts,” and last November unveiled uninterrupted video podcasts as the number of creators publishing videos monthly on Spotify grew 50 percent year over year. But the latest move does mark a competitive expansion into the streaming market, adopting a similar toggle between audio and video that currently exists on YouTube Music.\n\t\n\n\tEarlier this month, Spotify announced that it saw double-digit growth on its free and paid-subscription tiers for Q3 2025. They added five million paid Premium subscribers, up 12 percent to 281 million, and overall monthly active users grew 11 percent to 713 million for a 17 million net gain.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tIn an era when mobile carriers often blur together, T-Mobile continues to stand out by leaning into entertainment perks, value-driven plans and an ambitious new venture into satellite connectivity through Starlink.\n\n\tBeyond its 5G network dominance, T-Mobile’s current lineup of perks reads like a streaming bundle in disguise. Subscribers on eligible plans receive Netflix On Us and Hulu On Us at no extra cost, alongside the option to add Paramount+ and other platforms directly through their account dashboard. You can check out a full rundown of which plans offer which streaming services here.\n\t\n\n\t Music lovers are offered similar benefits, including data-free listening via Music Freedom and extended trials for SiriusXM and Pandora Premium. Meanwhile, the company’s Club Magenta provides customers with concert perks, early access to live events and discounted tickets. For its top-tier Experience Beyond plan, the brand even boasts that users receive over $40 a month in streaming benefits, underscoring how integral these entertainment partnerships have become to its identity.\n\n\n\tT-Mobile’s biggest leap, however, is happening above ground. Their T-Satellite service is a direct-to-cell satellite network designed to maintain connectivity in dead zones. The service currently supports SMS and MMS, with plans to expand into voice and data as technology advances. It’s available for free on premium plans like Experience Beyond and Go5G Next, and for a small monthly fee on others. The system uses low Earth orbit satellites to fill coverage gaps without requiring specialized devices. You can learn more about T-Mobile Starlink here.\n\t\n\n\tOverall, T-Mobile’s title as “the best network in America,” according to Ookla Speed Test, rests on tangible infrastructure gains. Following its merger with Sprint and, more recently, its acquisition of UScellular in 2025, T-Mobile now commands one of the broadest 5G footprints in the country. The company’s premium plans also include a five-year price guarantee, locking in talk, text, and data costs — a rare move in a volatile wireless market. Combined with device upgrade flexibility and consistent promotional credits, these guarantees reinforce T-Mobile’s value proposition as both consumer-friendly and future-oriented.\n\n\tThe T-Life app further simplifies the user experience, serving as a centralized hub where customers can manage streaming benefits, account settings, upgrades, and exclusive perks.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Music veteran Gregg Nadel has been elevated to a senior leadership position at Warner Records Group in the newly created central role of president of A&R. Based in Los Angeles, he reports to Warner Records Group CEO & Co-Chairman Aaron Bay-Schuck. \n\n\tNadel, who has been with Warner Music Group for his entire 28-year career, was most recently co-chair & co-president of Warner Music Nashville (which has been rebranded Warner Records Nashville).\n\t\n\n\tIn his new post, he will help drive overall A&R strategy and global collaboration across the company’s three major divisions, drawing on his wide-ranging experience on the A&R, marketing, and leadership fronts, according to the announcement. Nadel will work closely with Joe Kentish, president of Warner Records U.K.; Karen Kwak, head of A&R at Warner Records U.S.; and Cris Lacy, who was recently promoted to sole chair & president of the newly rebranded Warner Records Nashville.\n\n\n\tAaron Bay-Schuck and Warner Records co-chair/COO Tom Corson said: “As we continue to build out Warner Records Group as a tight-knit, seamless global ecosystem, having Gregg join us at the group level will be a huge asset. He’s a rare, all-around music man, with experience in everything from signing chart-topping artists to making records to developing superstars to leading creative teams. His invaluable relationships, calm judgment, and gift for bringing out the best in world-class talent will make a real difference as we focus our combined efforts on forging long-term careers with our U.S., U.K., and Nashville teams.”\n\t\n\n\tNadel added: “Joining the mothership at Warner Records Group is an extraordinary opportunity to champion amazing artists on the global stage and to connect the dots to bring them to audiences everywhere. An incredible devotion to the music is hard-wired into this company’s DNA, and I’m looking forward to working with Aaron, Tom, Joe, Karen, Cris, and their brilliant teams on both sides of the Atlantic to discover, nurture, and elevate the next generation of stars.”\n\n\tPrior to his tenure as Co-Chair & Co-President of Warner Music Nashville, Nadel served as President of Elektra Entertainment for seven years. He was previously General Manager of Elektra, prior to which he was SVP, A&R and Marketing, for Atlantic Records. Nadel joined Atlantic straight out of college in 1997, serving in various A&R and Marketing posts.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLes Films du Losange has unveiled a first-look still of Riley Keough in Albert Serra’s mysterious new film “Out of This World.” \n\n\tKeough leads the cast of Serra’s English language film alongside F. Murray Abraham, Evgenyia Gromova and Liza Yankovskaia. \n\n\t“Out of This World” follows an American delegation traveling to Russia in the midst of the Ukrainian war, as they attempt to resolve an escalating economic dispute. The project delves into the decades-long rivalry between Russia and the United States, blending Serra’s singular cinematic vision with a tense contemporary geopolitical narrative. Now in post-production, “Out of This World” shot over four weeks this summer in Latvia with Forma Pro. As much as 800 hours of footage was captured by Serra. \n\t\n\n\tThe film marks the eighth feature from Albert Serra, winner of two César Awards for “Pacifiction”— which was also in competition at the Cannes Film Festival—and the Golden Shell for “Afternoon of Solitude” at San Sebastián.\n\n\n\tProduced by Les Films du Losange, Idéale Audience Group, and Andergraun Films, in association with Felix Culpa, and in co-production with Rosa Filmes and Pandora Film, “Out of This World” continues Serra’s exploration of power, diplomacy, and human tension through his unmistakable auteur style.\n\n\tAlice Lesort’s team at Losange Films, the auteur-driven sales and production boutique led by CG Cinema’s Charles Gillibert, is kicking off international sales at the AFM. Les Films du Losange will also distribute “Out of This World” in France.\n",

Hahn brings Emma Léger and Sydney Silverman with her as new clients of DBA. Previously, Hahn was a talent manager at DamGood Mgmt, where she managed Dixie D’Amelio and worked closely with other creators overseeing brand partnerships, social strategy and creative development. Before that, she spent eight years as a talent agent at UTA, representing multihyphenate clients who crossed all departments.\n\t\n\n\tKylie Frink joins DBA as director of talent. Specializing in creator partnerships and influencer talent management, Frink’s career has encompassed brand partnerships, strategic growth and cultural impact both on and off platform. Before joining DBA, Frink spent three years at Viral Nation, where she developed from scratch and led the agency’s culinary division, forging strategic partnerships between leading top culinary creators including Food Network star Andy Hay and Next Level Chef champion Gabrielle Chappel with global brands.

During her tenure, she served as a senior account manager and team manager before advancing to the position of talent agent.\n\n\tJuliet Noble joins DBA as a talent manager from the digital department at Gersh and A3 Artists Agency, where she represented talent, managed their partnerships and developed creative strategies. Noble is “deeply passionate” about working with lifestyle, fashion and beauty creators and “thrives on discovering emerging Gen Z talent.”\n\n\tDBA president Vanessa Flaherty said in a statement: “We’re proud to continue expanding our footprint in the creator space with a new class of hires who each bring distinct expertise and perspective. Welcoming Allison to our leadership team highlights our dedication to bridging traditional entertainment experience with the innovative spirit driving today’s creator economy, and we look forward to collaborating with Kylie, Gloria and Juliet as they continue to identify, develop and scale talent.”\n\n\tDBA is led by co-founder and CEO Raina Penchansky. Founded in 2010, DBA represents nearly 400 creators across fashion, food, beauty and lifestyle. UTA acquired the company in 2019.\n\n\tNotable DBA clients include professional home organizers The Home Edit (acquired by Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine); beauty creator Patrick Starrr; lifestyle creator Aimee Song; private chefs Meredith Hayden and Olivia Tiedemann; beauty/lifestyle creator Toni Bravo; April Lockhart, a beauty and lifestyle creator who launched the Disabled& community for disabled creatives); beauty/fashion/lifestyle creator Golloria George; astronaut Kellie Gerardi; creator and reality TV star Olandria Carthen, who appeared on “Love Island USA”; beauty creator Mikayla Nogueira; and fashion/lifestyle creators Brigette and Danielle Pheloung.\n\n\tPictured above (l. to r.): Allison Hahn, Kylie Frink, Gloria Green, Juliet Noble\n",

    "body": "\n\n\tJon Watts is best known for directing the Tom Holland-starring “Spider-Man” movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, bringing a youthful charm to the franchise, which he most recently replicated in the jovial Disney+ “Star Wars” series “Skeleton Crew.” So one might be surprised to learn that Watts began his career directing a dark, low-budget, horror film produced by Eli Roth.\n\n\t“I was definitely not aspiring to make uplifting action comedies,” Watts tells Variety, reflecting on his unlikely career trajectory.\n\n\n\tWatts’ first feature, “Clown,” is a body horror film that he co-wrote with his regular writing partner, Christopher Ford. The film began as a fake trailer that he and Ford released on YouTube in 2010, introducing the premise of a father who dresses up as a clown for his kid’s birthday party, only to find the costume unremovable and eventually possessive of his body and soul. \n\n\n\n\n\tThe fictitious trailer says the film is “from master of horror Eli Roth,” even though Roth had absolutely nothing to do with their project. But when the video went viral, Roth reached out to Watts directly, inviting him and Ford to Los Angeles to pitch the project as a real movie. Roth joined “Clown” as a producer and Watts and Ford wrote the feature, expanding on the faux-trailer’s premise.\n\n\n\tThe real “Clown” added context and lore to the story Watts and Ford had concocted, explaining the clown suit’s supernatural abilities by having the costume be made of flesh from an ancient Nordic demon called the Clöyne. In order to survive, the Clöyne attaches itself to a host by way of the suit and feeds on children — one for every month of winter. Roth secured financing for the film, pre-selling domestic distribution rights to Dimension Films ahead of production. He also ended up costarring in the film as the Clöyne — alongside Andy Powers as the hapless father, Laura Allen as his terrified wife and Peter Stormare as the previous owner of the costume.\n\t\n\n\tUpon release, “Clown” fared well overseas, $4.3 million. However, Dimension did not release it in the U.S. until 2016, putting it in a severely limited release; it grossed $55,000. By that point, Watts’ sophomore feature, “Cop Car,” had already premiered at Sundance. Focus Features released the film — about two teenagers who hijack an abandoned police car and become the targets of a corrupt sheriff — in 2015, and it got the attention of Marvel Studios chief Kevin Fiege, who hired Watts to direct 2017’s “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” 2019’s “Spider-Man: Far From Home” and 2021’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” After stepping away from superhero filmmaking, Watts and Ford created “Skeleton Crew”; Watts also directed the 2024 Apple TV feature “Wolfs” starring Brad Pitt and George Clooney, and in 2025, he returned to the horror genre to produce “Final Destination Bloodlines.”\n\n\tEleven years after “Clown” first played in theaters, the film that started it all is getting its flowers, as German distributor Turbine Medien is rereleasing the movie as a remastered Blu-ray on Nov. 13. Watts spoke with Variety to reflect on the rerelease and his career over a decade since the debut feature.\n\t\n\t\tWhat led to this rerelease of “Clown” 11 years after its initial premiere?\t\n\n\tI have no idea. To be honest, I got a call out of the blue from this amazing company in Germany called Turbine. They loved the film. This guy, Phil Friedrich, said that they wanted to do a 4K Blu-ray HDR upscale and remaster all of the sound and create all this custom artwork and make a behind the scenes documentary. I couldn’t believe it. They’ve done similar things with some amazing films. They did some really great Cronenberg rereleases. I was very honored and very surprised, because I hadn’t really thought that much about “Clown” in a long time. Its original release was honestly a low point because it was initially shelved in the US. It got an international theatrical release in some territories, and then the Weinstein Company reluctantly released it in the US. It went from being promised a big theatrical release to almost nothing. So to finally have someone be genuinely excited about releasing the film and making sure it looked and sounded as good as possible was a really nice feeling.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t“Clown” famously began as a fake trailer. What compelled you to make it and then put it on YouTube?\t\n\n\tI wish I could say that this was all part of some master plan to get the film made, but it all happened purely by accident. It was 2010. My friends Christopher Ford and Jake Schreier, and a whole group of us from NYU had a YouTube page where we would post dumb little shorts and videos. This was before people were really monetizing videos. We were literally just doing it for fun, trying to keep our film school world alive. It was around Halloween, and Comedy Central just passed on a show that we were trying to make over there, so we were depressed and we had this idea to see if we could fool the followers on our YouTube page into thinking that we had made a real feature. We had always been joking around about this movie called “Clown,” which we just tried to make as horrible as possible. We tried to outdo ourselves, thinking of the worst, most disturbing premise for a movie that we could. That was part of the joke. We were like, “Let’s shoot this and really try to make it look like a legitimate film.”\n\t\n\t\tHow did you decide to put Eli Roth’s name on it?\t\n\n\tAs I was editing it, the idea of putting a big filmmaker’s name on it came up. We thought the bigger the name, the more convincing it could look and maybe we would actually trick people for our Halloween prank. It was down to Eli Roth or David Cronenberg, because we knew that either one of those names would imply a level of disturbing body horror. I picked Eli because I’m a big fan, and I could imagine him making a film about a man transforming into a clown and eating children. I put his name on it, listed me and Chris Ford as co-writers and put it online purely just to see if we could pull off this prank. The next day, it had thousands of views and all these comments about how amazing it looked. \n\n\tThen I got a warning that Eli saw the trailer and that he was going to call me. When he finally called, I was like, “Please don’t sue me, sir. It was just a joke. We’re big fans.” But he was like, “No, this is actually really cool. Do you have an idea for a feature?” I lied and was like, “Yes, absolutely. We have the whole thing worked out.” He invited us to L.A. to pitch it a week later, so we scrambled to come up with a treatment, but it turns out we’d been talking about it for so long that we had already worked out a lot of it. We pitched to Eli and he said “Great, can I take the trailer and see if I can get you guys some funding?” It didn’t take him very long. He took it to the American Film Market, got some financiers attached, and then we wrote the script. Before we knew it, we were up in Ottawa shooting in the winter. It was crazy. It happened so quickly. It was like winning the lottery.\n\t\n\t\tWhat’s it like to rewatch the film today?\t\n\n\tIt was nice to be able to rewatch it with a little bit of distance. The big joke we had after we made it was that we didn’t really make a horror film about a man turning into a clown. We made a psychological thriller. Looking back at it now, I’m like, “Oh, I should have leaned into the horror a little bit more.” It’s more of a character study than anything else. In retrospect, that was part of the joke, that we took this really ridiculous premise so seriously. But now I watch it, and I think I wish that I’d had enough time to really extend some of the kill sequences to be even crazier. I still see a lot of potential in the premise, so when I watch it now, I’m like, “Oh, we could have done so much more there.” I’d love for it to be like “Evil Dead 2.” I’d love to tell the same story, but jump off to even crazier places.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHave you ever thought about making a sequel to “Clown”?\t\n\n\tYeah, Ford and I have it all mapped out. We’d want to do seven of them, make it a real long-term franchise like “The Leprechaun” or something like that. There are a lot of facets to the story that we’re still interested in telling, because it’s great. It’s kind of an evergreen premise where anyone can put on the suit.\n\t\n\t\tYou had the chance to work in franchise horror as a producer on “Final Destination Bloodlines.” Do you think you’ll continue to work in that franchise’s future? Would you ever want to direct a “Final Destination” movie?\t\n\n\tI really enjoyed producing “Final Destination,” but it’s a lot of work to direct one. It’s a very difficult task because you have a limited amount of time to design and pull off these really intricate sequences. So it’s nice to be just the producer and not carry the full mantle of responsibility. I also get to still be a big fan of the movies.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve also had the opportunity to create franchises in both the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the “Star Wars” universe. What did you learn working on “Clown” that translated to these big-budget projects that feel so different in tone and scale?\t\n\n\tNo matter how big or how small of a film you’re working on, at the end of the day, it’s always reduced to what story are you trying to tell with the image and frame. For “Clown,” I storyboarded the entire movie, every shot from beginning to end, and put together an animatic, recorded all the voices and watched it. I made that film ten times in my head, then on paper and then on the computer before we shot a single frame. And that’s how I still do it. That process that I developed on “Clown” is how I always do it now.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWere you able to do that process working on “Skeleton Crew” even though it was several episodes?\t\n\n\tYeah, even more so actually. We fully storyboarded and created animatics for every episode. I did all the voices and then we were able to add an additional step where the directors took it into a motion capture stage and did the 3D previz to literally block the scene. We were able to watch that back and give notes. It really allows you to be as iterative as you would be if it was an animated film. You’re giving notes on pacing and shot framing and even lighting. It gives you a couple of opportunities to get it as right as you possibly can. It’s fun. I think all the directors really enjoyed that process too. It’s a luxury. It’s something that we got to get because it was “Star Wars.” It’s nice to have a little wiggle room to try stuff out.\n\t\n\t\tDo you expect to make more “Skeleton Crew”?\t\n\n\tI mean, I love “Star Wars.” I’d love to do anything in the “Star Wars” universe and I think we set it up in a way where the story can continue in a lot of interesting ways.\n\t\n\t\tHow about superhero movies? After “Spider-Man,” you stepped away from directing what became “The Fantastic Four: First Steps.” Would you want to direct in that genre again?\t\n\n\tI’m open to anything and everything. I’m not limiting myself in that way. I’m most attracted to original ideas. That’s sort of like the North Star for me — big, original ideas. But there are so many great things already out there that I think you can find a way to make it your own and to make it feel original.\n\t\n\t\tIf you were to return to either those franchises, is there a character or chapter in either Marvel or “Star Wars” that you’d most like to create a story around?\t\n\n\tYeah, but I wouldn’t want to say. I know what it’s like to be on the receiving end of getting a bunch of emails as a producer, saying, “Did you see the thing that Jon Watts said about how he wants to do this?” They’re busy enough as it is. My friend Jake Schreier is doing “X-Men,” though, which is really exciting. I loved the “X-Men” growing up, but it’s fun to just be a fan on the sidelines again.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHave you been able to talk to Destin Daniel Cretton about taking up the directorial reins on “Spider-Man: Brand New Day”?\t\n\n\tWe talked a little bit at the very, very beginning, but I’m very close to that franchise, so I just had to step back and let everyone do their job. It’s going to be genuinely weird for me going to see that movie for the first time. It’s going to be a really interesting feeling. It’s a passing of the torch and I’m curious to see where it goes.\n\t\n\t\tBecause of “Spider-Man” and “Skeleton Crew,” audiences have come to associate you with the action-comedy brand, and they might be surprised to watch “Clown” and find that your debut feature is a pretty dark, adult horror movie. Back then did you aspire to transition towards more uplifting movies, or did the opportunities just present themselves?\t\n\n\tI don’t think so. When it’s up to me, there’s always a dark thriller component, like a monster eating children or two kids stealing a cop car and being terrorized by a corrupt sheriff. So, no, I was definitely not aspiring to make uplifting action comedies. I’m pretty genre agnostic. If it’s a great story and if it’s something that I feel like I can really bring something to and elevate, then I’m open to it.\n\t\n\t\tSince you made “Clown,” clown-related horror has kind of taken off with films like “Terrifier” and “It.” What do you think it is about clowns that are so scary, yet enticing?\t\n\n\tI don’t know. It’s just a very visceral thing. It’s hard to talk about clowns post-John Wayne Gacy, because before that, there wasn’t the same sort of evil attached to a clown. A clown was genuinely a positive thing that people liked. I think it’s the mask. It’s the creepy level of makeup and the strange smile that is just genuinely disturbing. Like, yes, there’s a person under there, but you don’t really know who it is. I think that’s what always sort of creeped me out. But I still like good, positive clowns too. There are people that are genuinely good clowns that entertain people. I don’t want everyone to think that all clowns are scary, so I feel a little bad for being a part of that. I know some really great clowns, and I feel a little bit guilty for making everyone be scared of clowns when all clowns really want to do is bring joy and smiles.\n\t\n\t\tThat’s horror though, taking the familiar and revealing something scary, right?\t\n\n\tYeah, I mean Steven Spielberg ruined the beach for a lot of people with “Jaws.” I think within the seven-part “Clown” series, though, there’s a role for a good clown. We have a pretty detailed outline of everything that we would ever want to do. We’re still treating it like a funny prank that maybe someday will come true. It’s very fun to come up with ideas for clowns. It definitely touches a nerve culturally. If anyone out there is interested in really doing a deep character study of what it feels like to slowly and painfully transform into an ancient clown demon, they know where to reach me.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tJennifer Aniston told Elle magazine as part of its Women in Hollywood cover series that it was “very dangerous” when ABC pulled her longtime friend Jimmy Kimmel off the air in September because of comments he made about Charlie Kirk’s shooting death. \n\n\t“Unthinkable things are happening,” Aniston said. “It’s very dangerous and very unfortunate. But at the end of the day, we’re the viewers. We subscribe to these networks and streaming services, so it really comes down to the people and their voices. All those subscription cancellations spoke volumes.” \n\t\n\n\tAniston is referring to reports that Kimmel’s suspension resulted in a surge of Disney+ and Hulu subscription cancellations by consumers outraged over ABC’s decision. According to research firm Antenna for the month of Sept. 2025, the U.S. cancellation rate for Disney+ averaged 8% — double the 4% estimate for the prior two months — while Hulu’s cancellation rate for the month was 10%, twice the 5% for the preceding two months.”\n\n\n\tIn his Sept. 15 monologue shortly after Kirk’s suspected killer was arrested, Kimmel quipped: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who killed Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.” The line got the late-night host suspended. When he returned to air on Sept. 23, an emotional Kimmel said it was never his intention “to make light of the murder of a young man.”\n\n\tABC’s decision to suspend Kimmel did not sit right with many in Hollywood. Oscar Isaac recently made headlines for saying he was “not so open” to working with Disney (ABC’s parent company) on another “Star Wars” movie in the immediate aftermath of Kimmel’s suspension. The actor added: “If they can kinda figure it out and, you know, not succumb to fascism, that would be great… if that happens, then yeah, I’d be open to having a conversation about a galaxy far away. Or any number of other things.”\n\t\n\n\tAniston, meanwhile, had this message to send to Americans amid the current political divide: “We all need to listen to both sides. That’s what we’ve lost. We’ve lost communication, we’ve lost sitting across a table and having a discussion that is productive, learning from each other. It feels like everyone is sort of stuck in their positions and it’s my way or the highway, and that’s just not how the world works.”\n\n\tHead over to Elle’s website to read Aniston’s latest profile in its entirety.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA box office battle is brewing between Glen Powell’s dystopian thriller “The Running Man” and the heist threequel “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t.” Those new releases will compete against last weekend’s champion, Disney’s “Predator: Badlands,” for the No. 1 spot in North America.\n\n\tAccording to projections, “Running Man” and “Now You See Me 3” are each targeting debuts of $20 million to $25 million. Meanwhile “Badlands” is aiming for $18 million to $20 million in its second weekend. For the newest “Predator,” that’s a standard decline of 50% from its franchise-best $40 million domestic debut.\n\t\n\n\tParamount produced “The Running Man,” which is sprinting to 3,400 domestic theaters as well as 55 international markets. The film will test the box office bankability of Powell, who has been in commercial winners like the rom-com “Anyone but You” with Sydney Sweeney and the nostalgic “Twisters” sequel. “The Running Man” carries a hefty $110 million price tag and will need to stick around through the holiday season to justify its budget. Domain Entertainment co-financed the film. \n\n\n\tEdgar Wright directed “The Running Man,” the second cinematic adaptation of Stephen King’s 1982 novel after the 1987 film with Arnold Schwartzenegger. (That version was neither a critical nor commercial hit.) Set in the dystopian near-future, the R-rated movie follows Ben Richards, a working class man who participates in a win-or-die reality competition show where he’s hunted on live television by professional assassins. He needs the grand prize, $1 billion, to save his sick daughter. Colman Domingo, Josh Brolin and Michael Cera round out the cast. Reviews have been mixed, with Variety’s chief film critic Owen Gleiberman calling this take an “overelaborate reboot.” In his review, he wrote, “It’s better than Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 1987 version, but King’s prophetic tale of violence-as-entertainment-as-control has little future shock left.”\n\t\n\n\t“Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” hails from Lionsgate and opens in 3,300 North American cinemas as well as 64 overseas territories. Domestically, the third entry is projecting a similar start to its predecessor, 2016’s “Now You See Me 3” with $22 million. The franchise is known to resonate more with audiences than critics. Despite mixed reviews, the first two films about the thieving illusionists known as the Four Horseman were commercial successes; the original grossed $350 million while the sequel generated $334 million. “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” carries a price tag above $90 million.\n\n\tRuben Fleischer, best known for “Venom” and “Zombieland,” took over directing duties from Louis Leterrier and Jon M. Chu, who helmed the prior installments. Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Isla Fisher and Morgan Freeman reprise their roles, while Ariana Greenblatt and Rosamund Pike are among the franchise newcomers. In this cinematic sleight-of-hand, the Four Horsemen work with a new generation of illusionists to bring down a criminal network. “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” has a higher Rotten Tomatoes score than the others (the first has a 51% and the second carries a 34% “rotten” average). Variety’s Gleiberman praised the third entry as “all in good fun. Which is all this movie is or needs to be.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains major spoilers for “Ghost of Yōtei,” released Oct. 2 from PlayStation‘s Sucker Punch Productions.\n\n\tErika Ishii went through multiple battle sequences and physically demanding cinematic scenes during their time as the lead voice and motion-capture actor on Sucker Punch Productions’ “Ghost of Tsushima” sequel, “Ghost of Yōtei.” \n\n\tBut one of the most demanding parts of the role was actually a dialogue-heavy cutscene in the game that saw their character, Atsu (a.k.a. the Ghost of Yōtei), find out her presumed-dead brother, Jubei, was alive and well and happened to be the samurai she was currently begrudgingly teaming up with.\n\t\n\n\tPlayed by prolific video game Noshir Dalal (“Red Dead Redemption 2, “Marvel’s Spider-Man 2,” “Star Wars Jedi: Survivor”), Jubei is a key character in the PlayStation video game centered on Atsu’s mission to avenge her family during the beginning of Japan’s Edo period in the 1600s.\n\n\n\t“It was my first scene with Noshir. It is a meaty, juicy scene, but having a juicy, meaty reunion scene with an actor maybe a month after they’ve been cast is normally very difficult to get into,” Ishii said during a recent interview with Variety. “But there was just this immediate sibling chemistry there, and also the estrangement of the siblings sort of lent to this rediscovery feeling that we had in this cutscene.”\n\n\tIshii revealed that the version of the scene included in the game, which was released by PlayStation Oct. 2, was an “actor’s choice” performance from Ishii and Dalal.\n\n\t“So Nate Fox, the creative director of the game, our fearless leader, he directs all of the cutscenes, the Class As. And he will do a couple of takes, we’ll get one that is good and that we like, and then he’ll say, ‘actor’s choice.’ And that means we just have free rein to experiment or make a move or do something unexpected, and frequently, those would be the takes that they would go with. And this is one of them.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter a minute of trying hard not to get choked up by the pivotal, cinematic scene from the game, Ishii notes how “joyful” the process of shooting actually was.\n\n\t“Noshir is really phenomenal in this,” Ishii said. “And just thinking about how this was so fun, this was such a joyful shoot from start to finish. And even though Atsu has some really messed up, upsetting things happen to her, and there were days on set where I’d be attacked by a bear or blown across the room with a cannon or stabbed in the shoulder, it was just so fun. It was so fun.”\n\n\tIshii is the first actor to be featured in Variety‘s new interview series, “Variety Plays,” which uses a gameplay walkthrough, livestream Q&A format. During the interview, Ishii showed off their gamer skills while fielding questions about the making of “Yōtei” (Atsu’s wolf companion was referred to as “Bluey” throughout production!), as well as their all-time favorite games and latest work for comedy streamer Dropout.\n\n\tWatch Variety‘s full interview with Ishii as she plays through “Ghost of Yōtei” in the video below. The Jubei reveal portion starts around the 14-minute mark.\n\n\n\n",

'cause Hollywood heavyweights Nicholas Hoult, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Paul Bettany, Thandiwe Newton, and Colin Firth are also attached to the movie.\n      \n    \n          It shouldn't come as a shock to Adele fans that she's branching out from music ... last year she told reporters she was taking a break from music to explore other creative passions -- and apparently that means acting.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          If you don't know, Anne Rice's books have been adapted into several feature-length films ... most notably when \"Interview with the Vampire\" was made into the 1994 box-office smash of the same name.\n      \n    \n          Adele's used to \"Rolling in the Deep\" ... but, we're guessing producers are just hoping they'll all be \"Rolling in the Dough\" when the movie hits theaters next year!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Adele\n              \n                          \n                Tom Ford\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tIf Johnny Carson were alive today, he’d be 100 years old — and you can almost hear him delivering a sly, perfectly timed monologue about it. (“I’m so old, my cue cards have liver spots.”) To celebrate the centennial of the King of Late Night, as he has come to be known, the Museum of Broadcast Communications is rolling out the red carpet and reopening its doors with two exhibits: “The Johnny Carson Centennial” and “The Evolution of Late-Night Television.”\n\t\n\n\tThe exhibits will debut at the museum’s pop-up location at 440 W. Randolph Street in Chicago, which opens to the public on Oct. 24 and will remain open through January 2027. But before the lights officially come up, the museum is hosting a media preview and benefit event on Oct. 23, which would have been Carson’s 100th birthday, had he not died at 79 of respiratory failure in 2005. The celebration will support the MBC’s educational and archival mission.\n\n\n\t“I’m thrilled that the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago is creating this exhibit to honor Johnny’s legacy and celebrate his remarkable place in American history,” said Jeff Sotzing, President of Carson Entertainment Group. “As we mark what would have been his 100th birthday, it’s a perfect time to reflect on the enduring impact he had on television, comedy, and the cultural conversation.”\n\n\tAt the heart of the reopening is “The Centennial Exhibit,” which pulls back the curtain on Carson’s world. It features rare artifacts from the museum’s collection, exclusive video content from Carson Entertainment Group and Shout! Factory, and special items on loan from the Johnny Carson Gallery at the Elkhorn Valley Museum in Norfolk, Neb., like Carson’s “Tonight Show” desk and monologue cue cards.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA replica of the ‘Tonight Show’ set during the Johnny Carson is among the exhibit photo ops.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHighlights of the exhibit include photo ops where guests can grab a snap standing on a replica of the “Tonight Show” stage entrance and in front of the original curtain that adorned the set, as well as a mockup of the interview area of “The Tonight Show,” complete with desk, backdrop, sofa and all.  \n\n\tCarson hosted the late-night show for 30 years from 1962 to 1992, and his retirement not only became a major media event but also the year that the show finally won the Emmy for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series after 13 nominations. \n\n\tThe MBC’s companion exhibit, “The Evolution of Late-Night Television,” traces how Carson’s pioneering spirit inspired a parade of hosts who followed in his footsteps, exploring the contributions of hosts from Steve Allen and Jack Paar to David Letterman, Arsenio Hall, Joan Rivers, Jay Leno, Conan O’Brien, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, and Stephen Colbert, while examining how the format adapts to streaming, podcasts and digital media.\n\n\t“Johnny Carson was more than a host, he was a national institution whose humor and curiosity united Americans for three decades,” said David Plier, Chairman, President, and CEO of the Museum. “This exhibit is a rare opportunity to celebrate a career that helped shape American culture.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDave Ball, the instrumentalist in the synth-pop duo Soft Cell, who enjoyed a massive worldwide hit with their 1981 cover of Gloria Jones’ song “Tainted Love,” has died, according to the BBC. No specific cause of death was cited, although he suffered serious health complications after a back injury; he was 66.\n\n\tWhile fronted by flamboyant singer Marc Almond, Ball — pictured above, left, in the early 1980s — created virtually all of the duo’s music, which included hits with original songs like “Say Hello, Wave Goodbye” and “Bedsitter” and their debut album, “Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret.” Soft Cell were among the first widely popular synth-pop groups, creating music nearly entirely with electronics — a relative rarity in the early ‘80s that, powered by the rise of MTV, quickly became common.\n\t\n\n\tThe BBC reports that Ball died peacefully in his sleep at his London home on Wednesday, just a few weeks after playing a concert with Soft Cell at England’s Rewind Festival. During that show and often in recent years, he performed in a wheelchair, due to a serious back injury. However, he largely recovered and completed an album with Almond called “Danceteria” — the name of which was inspired by a popular and influential 1980s-era New York City nightclub — slated for release next year.\n\n\t“He was focused and so happy with the new album that we literally completed only a few days ago,” said the singer in a tribute, according to the BBC. “It’s so sad as 2026 was all set to be such an uplifting year for him, and I take some solace from the fact that he heard the finished record and felt that it was a great piece of work.”\n\t\n\n\tBall grew up in Blackpool, England and developed an interest in synthesizers after seeing electronic music Kraftwerk on a BBC science show on television. He met Almond at Leeds Polytechnic in 1977, where both studied art. They formed Soft Cell that year and soon recorded an EP. The group’s label, the indie Some Bizarre, signed a deal with Phonogram in the U.K. and released a later single, “Memorabilia,” which created a buzz in new wave circles.\n\n\tBut the release of “Tainted Love” — the extended version of which is a medley with the Supremes’ Motown-era hit “Where Did Our Love Go?” — in July 1981 created one of the biggest hits of the decade, one whose popularity has resonated over the decades. It sold an estimated 21 million copies worldwide.\n\n\tThe group had several U.K. chart singles in the early ‘80s but did not maintain their early level of success and split in 1984. Ball formed a group called the Grid before reuniting with Almond for a Soft Cell album in 2001 and again in 2018.\n\n\t“He was the heart and soul of Soft Cell and I’m very proud of our legacy,” Almond wrote in his tribute. “Thank you Dave for being an immense part of my life and for the music you gave me. I wouldn’t be where I am without you.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tShaquille O’Neal is many things: a four-time NBA championship-winning basketball player, a sports analyst, an entrepreneur, a DJ, an actor and most ",
    "body": "\n\tShaquille O’Neal is many things: a four-time NBA championship-winning basketball player, a sports analyst, an entrepreneur, a DJ, an actor and most recently, a film and television producer. Under his production company Jersey Legends, a branch of Authentic Studios, Shaq has been the creative and business force behind “Shaq,” his Sports Emmy-nominated HBO docuseries, the Oscar-winning documentary short “The Queen of Basketball,” and more. His latest project is “Allen Iv3rson,” a three-part documentary series set to release Oct. 23 on Amazon Prime.\n\t\n\n\tThe new doc tells the story of Allen Iverson, the NBA point and shooting guard who played in the league from 1996 to 2010, most prominently for the Philadelphia 76ers, sporting the number three on his jersey. He was an 11-time NBA All-Star, a four-time NBA scoring champion and the league’s MVP in 2001. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016. Iverson’s story encompasses far more than just what happened on the court, though.\n\n\n\tIverson grew up in Hampton, Va. He became a star athlete in high school and played AAU basketball,  winning the 17-and-under national championship in 1992. In 1993, however, Iverson was accused of starting a fight at a bowling alley in Hampton. He was arrested, tried as an adult, and convicted on the obscure charge of “maiming by mob.” Of the many people involved in the brawl, only Iverson and three other Black men were convicted. His sentence was 15 years in prison with 10 years suspended, but the conviction was overturned for insufficient evidence four months in.\n\t\n\n\tAfter his release, Iverson finished high school and was recruited to play basketball for Georgetown University, where he attended for two years before leaving to become the first overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft. Over his illustrious career, he made impacts both on and off the court. Unapologetically sporting a cornrow hairstyle and tattoos, and recording rap music during the offseason, he was a force of change in the culture of basketball\n\n\tThough Iverson and Shaq were competitors on the court, they are now business partners at Authentic. Shaq serves as president of Reebok Basketball while Iverson is VP. The two collaborated on and appeared together in Jersey Legend’s Netflix documentary “Power Moves” earlier this year, and now, Iverson takes center stage, sharing his story in his own words with “Allen Iv3rson.”\n\n\tThe series is directed by One9 (“Iceman,” Nas: Time Is Illmatic”) and is produced by Stephen Curry’s Unanimous alongside Jersey Legends. \n\n\t“A core part of Shaquille’s business vision has been building a production company that allows him to create content he’s truly passionate about. ‘Iv3rson’ represents that approach and allowed him to take the lead in developing, producing, and marketing a project where he wasn’t the primary subject,” says Colin Smeeton, president, West Coast, Authentic Studios. “As we expand the Jersey Legends’ development slate, Shaquille has fully embraced his role as a producer, with networks and streaming platforms eager to see what he creates next.”\n\n\tShaq joined Variety for an interview on his relationship with Iverson and their road to this latest project.\n\n\tLet’s start at the beginning, when did you first meet Allen Iverson and what were your initial impressions of him?\n\n\tI met him in the NBA. I didn’t know much about him in college, but we played against him in a preseason game. He and Nick Van Exel were going back and forth, and I knew he had something. I knew that he was going to be great. And of course, I followed his career, and we ran into each other at the All-Star game and just became good friends. He was a fierce competitor who changed the culture. The reason you see guys doing certain stuff today is because he did it and he took all the bad press with it. Before we came in, nobody really had tattoos, nobody had braids and nobody was wearing a lot of jewelry. He did that, took the brunt of what came with it and withstood all that stuff. And now everybody does it.\n\t\n\n\tAt what point in your relationship with Iverson did you envision making a documentary about his story?\n\n\tI wanted to tell the real story. You know, a lot of people don’t get to tell their story when they’re a celebrity. Sometimes other people can tell your story and paint a picture of anything they want. A lot of the time, when you’re a big name, somebody will make the story unbelievable. So I just had a conversation with him. I said, “Hey, we want to hear from you. We want you to tell your story. We don’t want other people telling the story.” Because he’s a very quiet, enigmatic guy, we just had to have that conversation. And because we’re good friends, he believed in me, and he let my production company take charge.\n\n\tWhat was it like collaborating with Stephen Curry and his company, Unanimous, on this project?\n\n\tIt was all good. In our world, we have a saying: “Everybody can eat.” Steph could bring something to the table, his company could bring something and I could bring something.\n\n\tWhat about your director? How did you land on One9?\n\n\tI’ve been in the business a long time and I know who’s who. One9 is edgy and creative, and we didn’t want something that was boring. We wanted somebody that was going to get into it and show us something that we haven’t really seen before.\n\n\tOnce the project was developed, what role did you play when the cameras started rolling?\n\n\tI’m the president, so my role is to oversee everybody and make sure they’re doing what they’re supposed to do. When you’re the president, you have to be good at delegation. The first thing we did was hire One9. The second thing we did was bring on Steph’s company. The third thing we did was have a conversation about how to proceed. I’m not behind the cameras. I’m not doing the sound, writing the script or anything like that, but my partners and I were able to help each other, delegate and find the right people to make this the best project ever.\n\n\tAnd how did the series find its home on Amazon?\n\n\tIn our world, when you come up with an idea, you go and present it to people and whoever takes it takes it. Now, I’ve been in a lot of meetings where the people you’re pitching to aren’t interested or they’re not going in the same direction. In those cases, you have to do something else. But when we pitched this one, they were very impressed and they told us not to take any other meetings.\n\t\n\n\tWhat do you hope that audiences will take away from this documentary? How is it different from some of the other coverage that Iverson’s story has received in the past?\n\n\tWe’re just hoping that people see the real person. People want celebrities to be perfect, but perfect is in the eye of the beholder. Allen Iverson is perfect to Allen Iverson, and that’s all that matters. That’s why he was able to withstand all the stuff he went through and still become a Hall of Famer. You have to be who you are. A lot of times in our industry, they want us to be certain ways, but Allen has always stood out. He’s gonna do it his way.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChristel Miller, a key executive behind 2023’s “Jury Duty” television experiment, has joined Fabel Entertainment as senior creative executive of special projects. \n\n\tIn the newly created role, Miller will work with CEO Henrik Bastin and SVP Jasmine Russ to “expand the company’s diverse pipeline of premium scripted content, forging new partnerships, packaging projects with top talent, and guiding high-value development opportunities that advance the company’s long-term vision,” per a press release.\n\t\n\n\tFabel previously served as head of scripted content at Freevee, the free streaming service under Amazon MGM Studios. There, she led the development of the surprise comedy hit “Jury Duty” and helped launch “Sprung,” “Primo,” “High School” and the Fabel-produced series “Bosch: Legacy” and “Ballard.” She also helped develop Prime Video dramas “Motorheads” and “On Call.” Prior to Amazon, she worked at NBC — where she oversaw “Superstore,” “Parenthood,” “Good Girls,” “Blindspot,” “New Amsterdam” and “Grimm” — and Showtime during the era of “Dexter,” “The L Word” and “Nurse Jackie.”\n\n\n\t“We have known Christel for a long time as a fantastic executive and collaborator working on the buyers side,” said Bastin. “She has a great eye for storytelling and a knack for identifying what makes a show special. We’re thrilled to have her join Fabel where she will hit the ground running with our team as we gear up for season two of ‘Ballard’ and ‘Bosch: Start of Watch’ in the new year.”\n\n\tRuss added: “The fresh energy Christel brings to Fabel makes this next chapter for the company especially exciting. She’s a builder of hit series, a champion of great ideas, and a trusted creative guide. Her experience and genuine love of the craft makes her an inspiring partner — and exactly who we want in our corner making the television we love.”\n\t\n\n\tMiller said, “I’ve long admired Fabel’s commitment to character-driven, fearless storytelling. This is a team that truly values creative collaboration and takes big swings. I’m honored to help shape the next phase of Fabel’s growth and continue building series that resonate around the world.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRachel Sennott first moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 2020. She got a shit welcome. \n\n\tConnecticut-born and NYU-bred, Sennott took the leap to the city of dreams the way any actor would hope to: with a TV gig booked and relocation costs covered. But the auspices ended there.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMax Montgomery for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t“They put me up in this studio apartment in North Hollywood, and there’d been crazy fires. The sky was, like, orange-gray-brown,” she says. “I got out of my car at the apartment, and there was poop — human poop — out on the sidewalk. I was like, ‘L.A., here we come!’”\n\n\tTo be fair, her feelings about the West Coast were already in the toilet. She’d gone viral for a 2019 video she posted on Instagram captioned, “The trailer for any movie set in LA.” In it, a club beat pounds as she twirls around in a crop top, sunglasses and what looks to be a metal belt worn as a scarf. “It’s L.A.!” she says, laughing artificially. “I’m addicted to drugs. We all are. If you don’t have an eating disorder, get one, bitch!” \n\n\n\tSo for the first three years after she moved to the City of Angels, Sennott had one foot out the door. “I don’t live here. I’m going back,” she would tell herself — and she had the New York storage unit to prove it. Things just weren’t clicking: The sitcom that brought her there, ABC’s “Call Your Mother,” aired for one season in 2021 before it was canceled and got forgotten almost as quickly. Sennott had a movie in the works, the queer Jewish dramedy “Shiva Baby,” but she’d shot it in Brooklyn before her move, with her NYU classmate Emma Seligman directing. And beyond work struggles, the vibes in L.A. were just off.\n\n\n\t“I felt really isolated and alone,” she says. “I was moving from Airbnb to Airbnb and feeling crazy and far away from my friends.” Her eyes grow wide, and she begins to laugh: “Especially if you’re a bad driver, it’s horrible. It’s so horrible and dangerous! Every time I’m on the highway, I literally feel like I’m gonna crash. Every time. I shouldn’t feel like I’m going to get in a car accident every day!”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMax Montgomery for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSennott is saying all this over Zoom from a cozy apartment in Los Feliz — she never did move back to New York. She’s pledged her allegiance to the West Coast by making “I Love L.A.,” the new HBO comedy series with Sennott, 30, at the center as creator, executive producer and star, playing an aspiring talent manager whose personal and professional lives get upended after a surprise reunion with her influencer frenemy. Sennott poured into the eight-episode series the internet addiction, sexual comedy and self-satirizing that defined her 20s and made her so relatable to her zillennial cohorts. As a result, the show feels like a generational text — perhaps the “Girls” of the 2020s — in that it’s a slightly heightened portrait of what it can be like as a young person to live and struggle in the titular city. And yet, just talking with Sennott, it’s clear how deep her East Coast roots go. They show up the most in the pace at which she expresses herself, yet it’s not as simple as being a New Yorker who talks fast. Sennott delivers the self-deprecating admission about her bad driving in a way that feels like dialogue written for a character you’ve known for years. But she’s also speaking for the masses of fired-up youth who push back on the idea that society should be structured around cars — and who also can’t be bothered to take driver’s ed more seriously. The strength of Sennott’s voice eventually ironed out any of her worries about “making it.” The fan base she developed over her years of posting comedy on social media helped “Shiva Baby” receive a level of word-of-mouth attention that would have been otherwise hard to achieve given its scrappy budget and pandemic release in 2021. The following year, she further established herself as an indie film darling with the A24 horror-comedy “Bodies Bodies Bodies.” And with the lesbian teen sex comedy “Bottoms” in 2023, Sennott got her first chance to prove her chops as a writer, penning the teen comedy with Seligman in addition to starring opposite Ayo Edebiri, another NYU classmate turned star. She’s been booked and busy, in front of the camera and behind it, ever since.  Sennott’s reputation as a rising actor and creative is intricately tied up with the East Coast. It shows up in everything from her humor to the company she keeps to her résumé — each of those early projects was produced and set in the state of New York with the exception of “Bottoms,” which was shot in Louisiana but made in collaboration with her New York friends. Even her Wikipedia page suggests that she lives there part time.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMax Montgomery for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSo what drove Sennott to make L.A. the backdrop of her first effort as a solo creator? To put it plainly: She grew up a little. Like many of her peers, Sennott experienced a bit of Peter Pan syndrome after feeling robbed of a chunk of her youth. “A lot of what I felt like should have been fun years were during COVID, and then there was the strike. I was chasing the high of something I missed out on, and New York symbolized that,” she says. “I’ve always had this thing where if I’m feeling unhappy, I’m like, ‘I need to move and change everything.’ Anytime I would go back to New York for work, I would be like, ‘This is what I need to be doing. I need to break up with my boyfriend and move back and drink every night.’ And then I would do that for a week and be like, ‘Wait a second. I need to go back to L.A. and be in my backyard.’” As it turns out, Sennott needed that backyard in order to come into her own as an artist. Now, she’s able to see L.A. for what it truly offers: access to the boardrooms and wine bars and house parties where real business gets done in entertainment — plus enough space to stretch your arms out and process it all. \n\n\n\tRight before the pandemic hit, Sennott experienced one of her first rites of passage in Hollywood — schmoozing with executives in a round of meetings that go absolutely nowhere. She and Seligman made a trip together to pitch a nascent version of “Bottoms” to what felt like every studio in town. “People were like, ‘That sounds amazing. Send us a script,’” she says. “We left being like, ‘We crushed it. We basically just did a bidding war.’ Obviously, everyone passed or just never replied.”  At least she got a good joke out of it. The “It’s L.A.” video was one of many posts that made Sennott a micro-celebrity on the internet. She had hundreds of thousands of followers on X, then still called Twitter, before she deleted her account in 2023, and has close to 1 million on Instagram, where she still posts, though not as frequently or as meme-heavily as before. That part of Sennott’s life was a legitimate boon to her career. Her lane was to make people laugh and look hot doing it, and it helped her book stand-up gigs and industry attention before she ever made a movie. But it was real work, even if she wasn’t taking brand deals or making money from it. And it took a toll.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMax Montgomery for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSennott gained her following “in this period where I was not feeling good about myself at all, and I saw people who, online, seemed like nothing bothered them.” She tried emulating that sense of detachment. “Going on a date tonight with $11 in my bank account let’s hope he’s not a feminist lol,” reads an oft-recirculated tweet of hers from 2018. (She later posted an update: Her date confessed that he followed her on Twitter and was happy to cover the bill.) “What the haters and also my mom don’t seem to understand is that when I post a photo of my bare tits there are at least 3 layers of irony,” reads another from 2019.  “If I talk about the things that I’m feeling or experiencing like I don’t care, or like I kinda like that they’re happening to me — ‘I like being sad!’ — then I’ll feel good,” she remembers telling herself. The dopamine hits didn’t last, of course, and Sennott eventually evolved past that way of thinking, but by that point her online persona had become a means to achieve her artistic goals. “I felt like I was changing,” she says, “but I still kinda wanted to keep up that other version of myself.” The engagement was hard to give up, even when it created moments of extreme discomfort for her. At those meetings in L.A., execs would open with canned lines like “So, you’re really slutty on Twitter!”  “And I’m like, ‘Um, yeah!’” she says, nodding vigorously but with panic behind her smile. “Not really knowing what I was supposed to do.” Instead of running away from that image, Sennott began to hone it. The characters she played in “Shiva Baby” and “Bottoms” weren’t autobiographical, but their high-octane emotions about their crushes and hookups, mostly involving other women, put Sennott at the center of sexual conversations more nuanced than social media allows.  On the internet, however, Sennott didn’t have a character to hide behind, and she was still having complicated experiences there. Until someone shook her out of it. “Ayo inspired me,” she says. She and Edebiri had rolled around the idea of deleting their Twitter accounts for years, but Sennott wasn’t taking it seriously. “Then she texted me at 11:30 p.m. on a Wednesday or something, like, ‘I just deleted my Twitter, lmao. Feels great. Feels awesome.’ I was like, ‘Wait a second. What? We have to talk about this. What should I do?’ I was freaking out.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMax Montgomery for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut she followed suit, and she’s better for it. “I felt great being away from that,” she says. “Then, of course, sometimes I miss it. I’m like, ‘I have to tell you guys something!’ I have things I want to say, but not feel like I’m still performing that old version of myself.” Instead, with “I Love L.A.,” she’s exploring a new version of her old self.\n\n\n\tSennott leads the cast of “I Love L.A.” as Maia, a junior staffer at a talent management company who starts to manage the career of her estranged college friend Tallulah (Odessa A’Zion) — now a budding social media star — after she shows up at Maia’s home with no warning. The two were co-dependent besties in New York and planned to live together in L.A. after graduation, until Tallulah backed out at the last minute, ditching Maia to stay back East and kicking off a period of mutual resentment.  Sennott mined the tension she felt around her own move to L.A. to explore Maia’s feelings of abandonment. “You feel a sense of pride when you find your people in your 20s,” she says. “Then people who live in the same place as you start moving somewhere else. I felt like, ‘Guys! Can we all just pick a place and lock down and stay here and nobody leaves?’” Sennott now understands that “everyone’s gonna do their own thing, but those feelings of uncertainty are where the characters start in the show.” With Tallulah, Sennott wanted to create a character that felt especially “of this generation.” “I saw some statistic that, like, 89% of kindergartners want to be a TikTok influencer,” she says, laughing. Though she’s speaking in hyperbole, the truth isn’t as far off as you’d think; she’s referencing a 2023 survey that reported 57% of Gen Z wants to make their money posting on social media.  Tallulah’s career was also a vehicle to dissect what makes young people gravitate to — and hate — each other. “I have had so many weird parasocial relationships with people where I’ve thought to myself that I know them, but it’s this version of them.” Having been influencer-adjacent for so many years, Sennott hasn’t yet seen a scripted depiction of life on the internet that feels real to her. It often comes off “clunky,” she says. So in her own show, she tried to create “an internet that was living and breathing and moving, but not making any direct references,” she says. “I Love L.A.” will premiere on Nov. 2, barely more than a year after it was greenlit. But Sennott wanted to avoid anything that could become outdated, “because the way the internet moves, you’ll never be able to keep up if you [try to capture] a moment in time.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMax Montgomery for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe rest of the show’s cast samples from a wide swath of the L.A. experience. To play Alani — another college friend, whose father is a major movie producer — she hired True Whitaker, daughter of Forest Whitaker. “I wasn’t set on casting a nepo baby, but I thought it could be fun and meta,” Sennott says. It helped that in Whitaker’s callback, the actor said, “Guys, I slept with my dad’s Emmy under my pillow last night for good luck.” (A’zion, too, is a child of the industry. Her mother is actor-producer Pamela Adlon.)  By contrast, Maia’s boyfriend, Dylan (Josh Hutcherson), a grade-school Spanish teacher, is the only person in her life unattached to the entertainment industry. Much of Gen Z grew up watching Hutcherson in “Bridge to Terabithia” and “The Hunger Games,” which Sennott thinks bolsters his role in the show: “You’re like, ‘Oh, I know him. He’s been my boyfriend for years!’” Beyond bringing Maia down to earth, Sennott sees Dylan as a way to demonstrate her own growth beyond her show’s image-obsessed characters. Trying not to laugh, she says, “I know this isn’t the only thing that matters.”  To that end, Sennott grounded herself by turning to her community. Her friend Jordan Firstman rounds out the main cast as Charlie, a celebrity stylist, and other compatriots will appear in cameos throughout the season.  “Me and my friends are like, ‘I guess we have to work together if we want to hang out,’” Sennott says. Though she’s accepted that “the push and pull is kind of forever” between New York and L.A., drawing from her friend group the way she and Seligman did on “Shiva Baby” and “Bottoms” is a way to feel closer to her first home.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMax Montgomery for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSennott’s profile continues to rise behind the camera. She co-created Dan Levy’s upcoming Netflix comedy series “Big Mistakes” and co-wrote the pilot with him. And for an upcoming biopic of Heidi Fleiss, Sennott co-wrote the script with director Leah Rachel and Travis Jackson. She was originally set to star as Fleiss, she says, but the role went to Aubrey Plaza due to Sennott’s schedule on “I Love L.A.” Even as she recognizes that Los Angeles has wound up providing her biggest opportunities yet, Sennott is careful not to romanticize her new digs. “I was sort of obsessed with how miserable I was in my early 20s, and as I was writing about it, it was like, ‘Don’t worry, you’re miserable now too, in a different way!’” she says. She’s laughing, but it’s only funny because it’s true. It’s hard, sometimes painful work to be No. 1 both on screen and behind the scenes. “You’re there prepping before anyone else gets there, and then everyone comes with all this fresh energy, but you’re already tired,” she says. “Then you do the shoot and it’s so fun — then everyone leaves, and you’re in a dark room, alone, dealing with your own decisions.” That feeling has hit Sennott most acutely while working on the season finale — her directorial debut. “I was in the edit, looking at my own episode, being like, ‘Who the fuck directed this shit? Where’s all the coverage? No one got that line? I’m so pissed at myself,’” she says. “And you’re always blaming a different version of yourself. I’d be watching a scene with me in it, like, ‘This actress is just not delivering today.’”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMax Montgomery for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSennott is getting adjusted to the whiplash that comes with all these different hats. “Some days you’re an actress and you’re like, ‘This is just fabulous. I’ve got seltzer and Diet Coke in my trailer,’” she says, swaying her shoulders with glee. “Then you’re like, ‘Nobody respects me there. Everyone thinks I’m just a puppet. I need to be a writer.’ Then you go be a writer, and you lock yourself away, and it feels great. Then all of a sudden, you’re like, ‘I have a headache. I have no ideas. I’ve been wearing sweatpants for three months. Let me out.’” From coast to coast and script to script, there’s been a common theme throughout Sennott’s coming of age. “I was longing for one thing that wasn’t gonna change. For so long, I was clinging to ‘Everyone stay here with me! I’m afraid to be alone.’” With “I Love L.A.,” she’s learning to let that feeling go — it’s a relic from a past life, like the storage unit full of furniture from her parents’ house and NYU dorm that she finally gave up. ”I’m finishing my Saturn return or whatever,” Sennott says. Though she rolls her eyes at herself just slightly, she’s taking that astrological event seriously. “I keep getting hit over the head, struggling with control and wanting to know everything, but even when I get the outcome I planned, it doesn’t feel how I wanted it to,” she says. “So I’m trying to be open to life and see what happens. And I’m really loving being here right now. I feel like an L.A. girly.”\n\n\t\n\t\tLocation: The Preserve LA; Hair: Clayton Hawkins/A-Frame Agency; Makeup: Lilly Keys/A-Frame Agency; Styling: Jared Ellner/A-Frame Agency; Look 1 (red room): Full look: Christian Cowan; Earrings: Audrey Nicole Diamonds; Look 2 (pink shoes, breath spray): Full look: 16Arlington: Shoes: Kandee: Earrings: Audrey Nicole Diamonds; Look 3 (polka dots): Full look: Solove; Jewelry: Audrey Nicole Diamonds; Look 4 (Yellow background and fountain): Full look: Anna Sui; Shoes: Rene Caovilla; Jewelry: Audrey Nicole Diamonds\t\n",

    "description": "\n\tStephen Miller, Donald Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security advisor, lashed out at Robert De Niro during a Fox News interv",
    "body": "\n\tStephen Miller, Donald Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security advisor, lashed out at Robert De Niro during a Fox News interview, calling the Oscar winner “a sad, broken old man” who “has been degrading himself on camera with one horrific film after another.” Miller’s rant came days after De Niro appeared on MSNBC and blasted Miller as a “Nazi” while talking about how Trump “will not want to leave” the White House and will seek an unconstitutional third term as U.S. president.\n\t\n\n\t“He set it up with, I guess he’s the Goebbels of the cabinet, Stephen Miller,” De Niro said, comparing Miller to Adolf Hitler’s chief propagandist. “[Miller is] a Nazi! Yes he is, and he’s Jewish. He should be ashamed of himself.” \n\n\n\tMiller was asked about the criticism while on Fox News’ “Hannity” and fired back: “Robert De Niro is a sad, broken old man who is mostly enraged because he hasn’t made anything worth watching in at least 30 years. Probably the longest string of flops, failures, embarrassments.”\n\n\t“This man has been degrading himself on camera with one horrific film after another for my entire adult life, and he is not taken seriously by anybody,” Miller added. “Not by his family, friends, community. He is a shell of a man, and everybody disregards everything he says.”\n\n\tVariety has reached out to De Niro’s representative for comment.\n\n\tIt should be noted that Miller’s claim that De Niro has had “the longest string of flops, failures, embarrassments” over the last 30 years is entirely false. While the actor has had his share of box office disappointments, the last three decades of De Niro’s filmography includes comedy blockbusters like “Meet the Parents” and “Meet the Fockers,” the crime classic “Heat,” Oscar-winning hits like “Silver Linings Playbook” and “Joker” and more. He’s also picked up three Academy Award nominations over the last 30 years for “Silver Linings Playbook,” “The Irishman” and “Killers of the Flower Moon.”\n\t\n\n\tDe Niro is one of the most outspoken Trump critics in Hollywood. During his recent MSNBC interview, which was conducted right after the most recent No Kings protest against the Trump administration, the actor urged Americans to continue to fight back against the president.\n\n\t“We can’t let up,” De Niro said. “Cannot let up on him because he is not going to leave the White House. He does not want to leave the White House. He will not leave the White House. Anybody thinks he, oh, he’ll do this, he’ll do that, it’s just deluding themselves.”\n\n\tDe Niro added, “The Republicans, most of all, because they know, but they’re going along with it. It’s a classic bully situation. We see it, and there’s no other way to face a bully. You have to face him and fight it out and back them off and back him down. That’s the only way this is going to work.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJane Rosenthal has been named co-chair of the board of Tribeca Enterprises as the company behind one of the world’s leading film festivals undergoes a leadership shift. \n\n\tAs part of the change, Rebecca Glashow, a veteran tech and media executive, will step into Rosenthal’s former role as the new CEO of the media and entertainment company that owns and operates the Tribeca Festival. In her new position, Glashow will also oversee the company’s content division Tribeca Studios, its distribution label Tribeca Films and its production company M ss ng P eces.\n\t\n\n\tRosenthal will lead the board alongside chairman James Murdoch, whose company, Lupa Systems, bought a controlling stake in Tribeca Enterprises in 2019. She will continue to direct the Tribeca Festival into its 25th anniversary, which it will celebrate in 2026, and will remain an advisor to the Tribeca brand.\n\n\n\tThe search for a new CEO was a two-year process, Rosenthal said in an interview Wednesday. “It took awhile, but I’m glad it did, because it led us to Rebecca, who is the perfect match for us in terms of what she brings to the table,” she said. “She’s a New Yorker who thinks globally and who has acted globally while leading many businesses. She has been a change-maker in the deals she has done over the years.”\n\n\tRosenthal, who has produced Oscar-nominated films like “The Irishman” and hits such as “Meet the Parents,” has also been active with Sphere. Last summer, she produced a remastered version of “The Wizard of Oz” that premiered at the Las Vegas venue and used AI to expand the scope of the classic film so it could fit the theater’s sprawling screens. Rosenthal said that she stepped down as CEO in part to focus on making more films for Sphere, as well as to devote more time to other aspects of Tribeca’s business.\n\t\n\n\t“I will have time to focus more on the creative side and the brand side of the company and some of the other projects that I haven’t had as much time to work on,” Rosenthal said.\n\n\tGlashow will join the company on Dec. 1. She most recently served as CEO of BBC Global Media & Streaming where she oversaw global distribution, content investment, global channels and the digital News service BBC.com. At the BBC, Glashow helped oversee the acquisition of ITV’s 50% stake in BritBox International, a British specialist streaming service, as well as the launch of a digital and product strategy across BBC.com and BBC app. Glashow has also worked at Comcast, Warner Bros. Discovery and Viacom. She served as executive producer on the Netflix young adult series, “Trinkets,” which won an Emmy, as well as “To All the Boys: PS I Love You.”\n\n\tGlashow said she has been a long-time admirer of the festival, which Rosenthal co-founded with Robert De Niro and entrepreneur Craig Hatkoff in the aftermath of 9/11 as a way to bring business back to the part of Manhattan that was still rebuilding from the terrorist attack.\n\n\t“I’m very passionate about the brand,” Glashow said. “I attended the very first festival and I lived in Tribeca for years. I’m a huge admirer of what Jane and Bob and the team have built here.”\n\n\tTribeca has grown far beyond its origins as a downtown festival and now includes live events and screenings across the five boroughs. But it’s been a challenging period for film festivals, as streaming services and studios have become less eager to buy indie movies, and the theatrical business has struggled to rebound from Covid. Glashow said she has yet to determine what her vision for Tribeca will be, but she stressed that the company and the festival still serve critical functions in the entertainment industry.\n\n\t“Tribeca plays an important role in building and growing an audience,” Glashow said. “The power of storytelling has never been more vital even in this complicated environment.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tRising British stars Kingsley Ben-Adir (“Bob Marley: One Love,” “Barbie”) and Archie Madekwe (“Lurker,” “Saltburn”) are teaming up to lead the cast ",
    "body": "\n\tRising British stars Kingsley Ben-Adir (“Bob Marley: One Love,” “Barbie”) and Archie Madekwe (“Lurker,” “Saltburn”) are teaming up to lead the cast of “The Arrival” alongside Joanna Scanlan (“After Love,” “Joy”) and Alex Descas (“Let the Sunshine In,” “Raising Colours”). \n\n\tThe film marks the feature directorial debut of award-winning theater director Bijan Sheibani, based on his acclaimed play of the same name, and boasts an array of prestige producers behind the camera in Michael Fassbender‘s DMC Film and House Productions, which made “Conclave.” Cornerstone is handling worldwide sales and will be launching the project at the American Film Market.\n\t\n\n\tDescribed as a “gut-wrenching, depiction of identity, obsession and betrayal,” “The Arrival” — which has now wrapped in London after shooting under the radar across the U.K. — charts the reunion of two long-lost brothers, Raheem (Madekwe) and Tom (Ben-Adir) in adulthood. Tom, the elder of the two, was given up for adoption as an infant. The film examines the “exhilarating and uncanny experience” of meeting a blood brother for the first time in adulthood. As the two grow closer, seduced by the idea of their shared history finally making sense, they must confront the uncomfortable truths at the heart of their family, and the impossible decision that their parents (Scanlan and Descas) made thirty years ago.\n\n\n\tSheibani is an Olivier Award-winning director and “The Arrival” marked his writing debut for the theatre. Most recently, he directed “Till the Stars Come Down” for the National Theatre, which successfully transferred to the Theatre Royal Haymarket. For TV, he wrote multiple episodes of “One Day” for Netflix. Other acclaimed theatre directing credits include “Dance Nation” (Almeida Theatre), “Barber Shop Chronicles” (National Theatre) and “The Brothers Size” (Young Vic).\n\t\n\n\t“The Arrival” was developed by Sheibani with Film4 alongside DMC Film (“Kneecap,” “Calm With Horses”) and House Productions (“Conclave,” “The Iron Claw”) who also have co-produced the film. It is co-financed by Film4 and the BFI (awarding National Lottery funding).\n\n\tThe film is produced by BAFTA Award winner and Emmy Award nominee Tessa Ross (“Conclave,” “Slumdog Millionaire”) Emmy Award nominee Juliette Howell (“Brexit: The Uncivil War,” “Conclave”) and BIFA winner Theo Barrowclough (“Scrapper,” “Mint”) for House Productions. Oscar and BAFTA nominee Fassbender, BIFA and BAFTA nominee Daniel Emmerson and Conor McCaughan produce for DMC Film. Nell Green also produces the feature. David Kimbangi is executive producer for Film4 and Ama Ampadu for the BFI. It has been shooting in the U.K. across the summer.\n\n\t“Having worked with Bijan on his Film4-backed short Morning Song and throughout development of the script, we’re so proud to see The Arrival come to life,” said David Kimbangi, senior commissioning executive at Film4. “The calibre of the cast and crew that have attached to the film is testament to Bijan’s undeniable writing, his reputation in theatre, and it has been a joy collaborating with him, Theo Barrowclough, and our partners at the BFI.”\n\n\tAdded Ampadu, senior production and development executive at the BFI: “In ‘The Arrival,’ Bijan Sheibani is bringing his unique voice and style to create a film that deftly explores issues of identity and roads not taken. Following his success in theatre and based on his play of the same name, Bijan and his producer Theo Barrowclough have brought together a fantastic team and an exciting cast, led by Archie Madekwe and Kingsley Ben-Adir, to create a gripping, striking and heartfelt debut feature.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tVideo game giant Electronic Arts has struck a new partnership with generative tech company Stability AI “to co-develop transformative AI models, tools, and workflows that empower our artists, designers, and developers to reimagine how content is built.”\n\n\tStability AI, which counts filmmaker James Cameron among its board members, aims to “put creators at the center and build around their specific needs,” according to CEO Prem Akkaraju. “By embedding our 3D research team directly with EA’s artists and developers we’ll unlock the next level in world-building power,” Akkaraju said in EA’s newsroom post announcing the partnership Thursday. “This kind of progress is only possible through deep partnership, where scientists and creators work side by side.”\n\t\n\n\tThe deal was announced just as EA is in the process of going from a publicly traded company to a privately held one.\n\n\n\t“I use the term smarter paintbrushes,” EA Sports head of technical art Steve Kestell said in his own statement. “We are giving our creatives the tools to express what they want. Tools that will allow creativity to get directly from people’s minds, and into our experiences.\n\n\tAccording to EA and Stability AI, “Among the first initiatives of this collaboration will be to accelerate the creation of Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials through the development of new artist-driven workflows – for example, tools that generate 2D textures that maintain exact color and light accuracy across any environment. Whether it’s the flash of color of a football jersey under a floodlit stadium or the subtle gleam of a coffee table in soft morning light, these textures help objects in a virtual world look and feel as the artist envisioned, and we’ll now be able to do this faster and with higher quality.”\n\t\n\n\tSee below for EA and Stability AI’s full announcement on the new deal.\n\n\tAt Electronic Arts, creativity isn’t just part of what we do, it’s what drives us forward. It’s what transforms a blank canvas into a living, breathing world, and turns a single idea into an experience shared and loved by millions of players and fans around the globe.\n\n\tFor more than 40 years, EA has led through technological shifts across interactive entertainment, redefining what is possible for our global community of players. At the core of that progress is the belief that technology powers creativity – amplifying imagination, accelerating expression, and enabling our teams to deliver bold, new experiences that inspire the world to play.\n\n\tMachine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have long been cornerstones of innovation at EA — powering everything from intelligent gameplay and real-time animation to physics simulation, pathfinding solutions, and more efficient development pipelines. \n\n\tToday, we’re taking the next step on that journey. \n\n\tElectronic Arts is excited to announce a partnership with Stability AI, to co-develop transformative AI models, tools, and workflows that empower our artists, designers, and developers to reimagine how content is built. A global leader in generative technology, Stability AI’s work is revolutionizing visual media.\n\n\tEmpowering our teams\n\n\tWith humans at the center of storytelling, we’re evolving how we work so that AI becomes a trusted ally: supporting faster iteration, expanding creative possibilities, accelerating workflows, and allowing more time to focus on what matters most – building world-class games and experiences that entertain massive online communities. It can draft, generate, and analyze, but it can’t imagine, empathize, or dream. That’s the work of EA’s extraordinary artists, designers, developers, storytellers, and innovator. Simply put, this partnership will help empower our creatives to do what they do best.\n\n\t“Creativity has always been at the heart of everything our teams do,” says Kallol Mitra, VP of Creative Innovation at EA. “Together with Stability AI, we’re amplifying that creativity. Giving artists, designers, and developers the power to dream bigger and build more.”\n\t\n\n\t“I use the term smarter paintbrushes,” says Steve Kestell, Head of Technical Art for EA SPORTS. “We are giving our creatives the tools to express what they want. Tools that will allow creativity to get directly from people’s minds, and into our experiences.”\n\n\tIgniting potential\n\n\tAmong the first initiatives of this collaboration will be to accelerate the creation of Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials through the development of new artist-driven workflows – for example, tools that generate 2D textures that maintain exact color and light accuracy across any environment. Whether it’s the flash of color of a football jersey under a floodlit stadium or the subtle gleam of a coffee table in soft morning light, these textures help objects in a virtual world look and feel as the artist envisioned, and we’ll now be able to do this faster and with higher quality.\n\n\tFor years, Machine Learning and AI have enabled our teams to develop technologies like HeadStart, which leverages photos to create authentic in-game likenesses. This partnership will allow us to bring that same speed and scale to the entire 3D space by accelerating the content creation process and ultimately allowing our artists to do more.\n\n\tBeyond individual assets, the partnership explores AI systems that can pre-visualize entire 3D environments from a series of intentional prompts, allowing artists to creatively direct the generation ofgame content.\n\n\tThese advancements open exciting new doors for rapid prototyping and visual storytelling, allowing artists and developers to ideate, visualize, and refine gameplay experiences at a faster pace and with greater scale.\n\n\tThese are just a few examples of what is to come.\n\n\t“EA has always been, and will continue to be, at the forefront of technology, innovation, and play,” says Rick Stringfellow, Head of Visual Content for EA Entertainment. “Partnerships like this are how we evolve the craft of game-making and give our teams the tools to tell deeper, more meaningful stories.”\n\n\t“EA is a pioneer in interactive entertainment and understands that innovation begins with the creator,” said Prem Akkaraju, CEO of Stability AI. “At Stability AI, we put creators at the center and build around their specific needs. By embedding our 3D research team directly with EA’s artists and developers we’ll unlock the next level in world-building power. This kind of progress is only possible through deep partnership, where scientists and creators work side by side.”\n\t\n\n\tThe future is interactive and we’re building it now\n\n\tThe future of creativity at EA is brighter than ever.\n\n\tWith partners like Stability AI, we’re opening new creative frontiers that will shape how our teams design, build, and bring experiences to players around the world. These tools are helping our artists, designers, and developers do what they do best—tell incredible stories, craft unforgettable worlds, and delivermoments that inspire the world to play.\n\n\tInnovation has always fueled progress at EA, but it’s our people and their imagination, artistry, and passion who make the experiences. And together, we can’t wait to see what comes next.\n",

Jay denies at first, then brushes it off with a \"little bit\" -- but when the cop requests him to do a field sobriety test, Jay flat-out refuses ... resulting in the handcuffs coming out.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Jay didn’t put up a fight -- he let the cops cuff him and walked straight to the squad car. Still, it was a wild twist... considering it all started as a routine crash scene, with officers just telling Jay and the guy he rear-ended to swap info and call their insurance.\n      \n\n          Cops hauled Jay to the hospital for a blood draw ... and a law enforcement source tells TMZ the results came back at a whopping 0.23 blood-alcohol content percentage -- almost 3 times the legal limit of 0.08.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Cutler was booked into the Williamson County Jail that night, and posted $5,000 bond\n      \n    \n          As you know, he cut a plea deal with prosecutors back on Aug. 26. He got jail time, a year of supervised probation, a $350 fine … and lost his Tennessee license for 12 months.\n      \n    \n          Cutler was sentenced to 4 days in the slammer for his misdemeanor DUI plea … but he ended up clocking just 2 and a half before walking free.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jay Cutler\n              \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive Details\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

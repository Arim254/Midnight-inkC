In contrast, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s “Vineland,” channels the filmmaker’s trademark sense of chaos and longing into a layered reflection on social idealism and decay.</p>\n<p>\n\tElsewhere, “Bugonia” reimagines the 2003 South Korean dark comedy “Save the Green Planet” through the lens of Yorgos Lanthimos’ distinctive vision, with screenwriter Will Tracy twisting its absurdist horror into a darker, more satirical register.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe “little film that could” this season is “Train Dreams,” an adaptation of Denis Johnson’s novella by Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar, which may emerge as a quiet threat as the season progresses. A lyrical portrait of isolation and loss, it has ardent defenders and admirers who could help carry it far. Meanwhile, there’s a strong gut feeling that Craig Brewer’s “Song Sung Blue,” based on a real-life story tied to the music industry, could bring a soulful, populist touch to a category defined this year by ambition and artistry — aided by standout performances from Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>NOTE: All titles, release dates, studios, and final credits are subject to change.</em></p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TRAIN_DREAMS_u_00_19_06_13_R-e1753310330650.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"TRAIN DREAMS - (L-R) Felicity Jones as Gladys and  Joel Edgerton as Robert Grainier.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIn 2011, director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sean-mcnamara/\">Sean McNamara</a>, a Disney and Nickelodeon veteran with an iffy feature track record (see: “Bratz”) had a sleeper success with the inspirational biopic “Soul Surfer.” Its mix of sun, surf, spirituality and teen angst, dramatizing a real-life Hawaiian competitor’s rebound after losing her arm to a shark attack, remains a favorite among audiences for faith-based entertainment. After some less well-received efforts, including last year’s biopic “Reagan,” McNamara is back on old terrain with “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/soul-on-fire/\">Soul on Fire</a>,” centered on a young protagonist struggling after his own near-fatal accident. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBased on John O’Leary’s 2016 memoir-slash-self-help tome “On Fire,” this earnest effort will have likewise appeal to viewers seeking a family-friendly “true story” with an upbeat message about overcoming adversity. However, the sports angle isn’t so potent this time; while Bethany Hamilton really was a pro surfer, O’Leary is a lifelong baseball <em>fan</em>, which provides a rather less compelling sub-theme. Beyond that, this “Soul” is smoothly crafted, hitting the right notes of conflict and bravery. But it’s also bland to a fault at times, and feels unnecessarily drawn-out at nearly two hours. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tGregory Poirier’s screenplay does maintain a steady level of interest, in part by veering from a strictly chronological structure. We start off with the adult O’Leary (Joel Courtney) working in home construction, when he’s asked by a woman who’s heard about his past if he’d talk about it to the Girl Scout troop she den-mothers. Even addressing a few preadolescents is more public speaking than he can handle comfortably, but when he’s asked a question, he flashes back 20 years to the traumatic event that caused him to be invited. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAt age nine (played by James McCracken), he was just a baseball-obsessed boy in 1987 suburban St. Louis, one of six children to parents Denny (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/john-corbett/\">John Corbett</a>) and Susan (Stephanie Szostak). One day, O’Leary is impressed by some bigger kids playing with gasoline and matches. No one says, “Don’t try this at home,” so our junior hero does just that — creating an explosion that ends up destroying the entire house. He’s the only person seriously hurt, albeit badly, with burns covering 100% of his body. He is not expected to survive. But he does, thanks in part to the loyal support of his family, a particularly dedicated male nurse (DeVon Franklin) and famous local sportscaster Jack Buck (William H. Macy), who takes a special interest in the starstruck lad.</p>\n<p>\n\tReleased from the hospital after five months, John has major adjustments to make — including the use of prosthetic hands, since his severely damaged fingers required amputation. He gets by, becoming a popular figure at college by being the frat bro most likely to out-drink everyone else. But his self-confidence remains shaky. He clicks with fellow student Beth (Masey McLain), yet is too shy to ask her out until they’re almost too well-established as “just friends.” Later on, John overcomes more obstacles, eventually becoming a professional public speaker. Nonetheless, he confesses to his father (who’s by then dealing with Parkinson’s disease) that, despite everything, deep down he can still feel “like a fraud…an emotional coward.” </p>\n<p>\n\tAs likable a performer as Courtney is, his wide-eyed hero doesn’t really have the depth to make that inner doubt vivid. The variable supporting players — some of whom have been much better elsewhere — make their characters seem even more rotely drawn. Both script and direction stay on a pleasant surface level, frequently goosed by a soundtrack full of rather on-the-nose golden oldies by Smash Mouth, Neil Diamond, Journey, John Fogerty, Paul Stookey and others, plus newer Christian pop cuts. At least they have more personality than Mark Isham’s original score, which is among his less inspired efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe intended stirring impact is a bit stunted by the lack of complexity and nuance in telling John’s journey. Inevitable glimpses of real-life O’Leary under the final credits make “Soul on Fire” retroactively feel like an extended promotion for his books and lectures. Movies like this also frequently seem to contradict their ostensible emphasis on internal faith by having the protagonist’s triumphant moments invariably accompanied by cheering crowds — a fantasy of piety and selflessness that somehow also grants a starry spotlight. This competently crafted, if pedestrian, feel-good exercise will probably deliver the desired uplift for viewers who want their “true stories” played out via cozily familiar narrative beats. But the effect is a little too generic to be especially persuasive for anyone else. </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tNew updates have been revealed about Skybound Entertainment’s upcoming video game “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/invincible/\">Invincible</a> VS,” including the addition of Cecil Stedman, a fan-favorite character from Robert Kirkman’s comics and “Invincible” TV series at Amazon, to the 3v3 tag fighting game.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo date, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/invincible-vs/\">Invincible VS</a>” has now revealed eight characters that will be included in the fighter: Mark Grayson (Invincible), Atom Eve, Bulletproof, Thula, Rex Splode, Battle Beast, Omni-Man and Cecil.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPer the description from Skybound Entertainment and Quarter Up, “A fan-favorite from the ‘Invincible’ TV series and comic books, Cecil has been one of the most requested playable characters. Most often heard as a voice in Mark’s earpiece, Cecil enters the fight in Invincible VS with specialized weapons, including plasma pistols, projectile launchers and grenades to keep opponents at a distance. His ranged gameplay style is paired with tactical combat, allowing him to play cat and mouse with enemies. Want more? Cecil can also summon a limitless supply of Reanimen for backup; with access to The Hammer – a massive orbital laser – he is a devastating force on the battlefield.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, the “Invincible VS” devs and Kirkman revealed new details about the game’s story mode Thursday, which “plays like a special extended episode of the show, featuring every announced playable character so far – and teases the arrival of a brand-new character who hasn’t yet appeared anywhere in the Invincible Universe.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m very involved in the game, but one of the great things about this team is that they are constantly impressing me with the little factoids that they’re working into the game and the details and the balance and everything makes sense,” Kirkman told <em>Variety</em> in a Sept. 30 interview tied to the Cecil news. “This game is being made by fans of the ‘Invincible’ series and fans of the ‘Invincible’ comic books to the point where they’re sometimes reminding me of things that I have forgotten, which is not something I’m proud of, but it does happen.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Invincible VS” is set to launch in 2026 on Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the new trailer for “Invincible VS” in the video below.</p>\n<p>\n\tyoutube.com/watch?v=nKYAyVmdqkM&feature=youtu.be</p>\n<p>\n\tSee more gaming news from this week in the roundup below.</p>\n\t<h2>\n\t\tNEWLY ANNOUNCED GAMES\t</h2>\n<p>\n\tNetflix has unveiled a new slate of party games to be played on TV screens — with your phone as your controller — that will be coming to the service this holiday season.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’re creating a completely new way to play games — one that’s as easy as streaming a show on a Friday night,” per Netflix’s announcement. “All you’ll need is Netflix and your phone to experience a whole new level of fun on Netflix with instantly recognizable games like ‘LEGO Party!,’ ‘Pictionary: Game Night,’ ‘Boggle Party,’ ‘Tetris Time Warp,’ and a fresh take on the social deduction genre ‘Party Crashers: Fool Your Friends.'”</p>\n<p>\n\tSee full descriptions for the upcoming titles below.</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>LEGO® Party!</em></strong> – Square off against your friends in the ultimate LEGO party game.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tSimilar to its book-to-film predecessors “The Girl on the Train” and “The Woman in the Window,” “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-woman-in-cabin-10/\">The Woman in Cabin 10</a>” also features a gaslit woman who’s forced to solve a mystery on her own after witnessing a suspicious incident. And much like the aforementioned beach-reads-turned-Hollywood-thrillers, director-co-writer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/simon-stone/\">Simon Stone</a>’s adaptation for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/netflix/\">Netflix</a> also suffers from major missteps by the mid-point, causing any tension to dissipate long before the already-brief run time is up. Still, the sleek production design, symphonic score and performances from a killer ensemble act as a life preserver, making the shenanigans at sea a little less choppy.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAward-winning investigative journalist Laura “Lo” Blacklock (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/keira-knightley/\">Keira Knightley</a>) has recently returned to work after a young female source turned up dead. Hoping to distance herself from the grief and guilt, the workaholic petitions her editor (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) to be assigned to a lighter beat, reporting on the maiden voyage of the luxury yacht the Aurora Borealis. The charity affair sailing to Norway is hosted by terminally ill shipping heiress Anne Bullmer (Lisa Loven Kongsli) and her husband Richard (Guy Pearce), benefitting their foundation. Aboard, Laura learns not only that her photographer ex-boyfriend Ben Morgan (David Ajala) is working the event, but also that Anne personally invited her on this excursion. She’s asking for Lo’s assistance in announcing the news that she’s giving away her entire fortune at the end-of-the-line gala in a few days.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPlans for a relaxing vacation take a turn in the wee hours of their first morning. Lo overhears a scuffle in the cabin next door and a distinct splash in the freezing ocean waters. She believes it’s the nervous woman she briefly bumped into the evening prior. However, after reporting the incident, she’s informed that cabin is vacant. Lo’s attention turns to the guests and staff on the high-tech ship as she tries to figure out the identity of that squirrelly, bedraggled blonde she saw. This includes aging rock star Danny (Paul Kaye), Dame Heidi Heatherly (Hannah Waddingham) and her husband Thomas (David Morrissey), influencer Grace Phillips (Kaya Scodelario), tech magnate Lars Jensen (Christopher Rygh), playboy Adam Sutherland (Daniel Ings) and Anne’s personal doctor Dr. Mehta (Art Malik). As Lo gets closer to the truth, the danger increases as it becomes clear someone wants her dead.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tStone and adapting co-writers Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse (all of whom work from Emma Frost’s adaptation of Ruth Ware’s novel) find it impossible to shake the source material’s inauspicious beginnings, reading as a publisher’s bottom tier “Gone Girl” hopeful and a waterlogged homage to Agatha Christie’s “Death on the Nile.” Even the filmmakers’ Hitchockian influences fail to garner much narrative and thematic weight. That said, production designer Alice Normington gives the aesthetics depth and dimension, from a shell-shaped spiral staircase to the yacht’s curving, reflective surfaces which symbolically mirror these characters’ hidden dualities.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe mystery is less about who’s involved in the game afoot, as alert audiences piecing together context clues will be immediately aware of those nefarious parties upon their introductions, and is more about the puzzling lengths the filmmakers go to in planting contrived red herrings. Discussion of a possible stowaway happens after we already know there is one – single mother Carrie (Gitte Witt). Suspects’ motivations change with little rationale. Heidi, Thomas, Lars and the Bullmer’s head of security Sigrid (Amanda Collin) don’t trust Lo’s sanity, until they magically do in a hacky “let’s hear her out” sequence in the finale. Despite the supporting actors’ deviously delightful depictions of the insufferable nouveau riche, Danny, Grace and Adam offer no motor at all to warrant their inclusion in the line-up, making us wonder if their storylines had been drastically truncated – and, if so, what for.</p>\n<p>\n\tBenjamin Wallfisch’s compositions are struck in the key of intrigue, cradling us in a comforting soundscape before offsetting our footing. Unfortunately, the rest of the craft work is a mixed bag of goods. The film is aggressively teal with a sallow greige (gray-beige) overcast.<strong> </strong>Ben Davis’ cinematography seems like it’s continually fighting to hang on to the light during shooting hours. Perhaps the dimming of the light is a metaphor for Lo’s search in the darkness for the truth, but chances are it’s not considering Stone and company rarely apply any visual dexterity to the proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile our heroine is allotted a smartly executed arc and exhibits self-driven change, missing is a sense of fluidity in Stone’s artistry that could’ve cloaked the lackluster hijinks surrounding her. He surprisingly practices restraint, failing to envision Lo’s paranoia, anxiety and unraveling psychosis through energetic editing and camera movements to denote head-spinning perspective shifts or atmospheric pressure drops. Knightley’s percolating performance captures the mounting pressure, yet Stone’s straightforward direction doesn’t do his leading lady many favors. Any insightful commentary on the 1% protecting themselves is rendered rote with a wimpy, ludicrous dénouement. Maybe with a more daring hand on the helm, our voyage wouldn’t have run out of suspense before the conclusion.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>“The Woman in Cabin 10” streams on Netflix starting Oct. 10.</em></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/michael-j-fox/\">Michael J. Fox</a> said he was retiring from acting in 2020, but that turned out to just be a hiatus as the icon has now filmed a supporting role for the new season of the Apple TV+ comedy “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/shrinking/\">Shrinking</a>.” The gig marks Fox’s first on-screen acting job since his 2020 guest role on “The Good Fight.” The actor recently quipped to <a href=\"https://people.com/michael-j-fox-talks-new-book-future-boy-return-to-tv-exclusive-11825341?taid=68e65601763c99000197dd04&utm_campaign=peoplemagazine&utm_content=new&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">People magazine</a>: “I’m always retiring.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the specifics of his acting return, Fox is not spilling any details yet on “Shrinking” Season 3 other than revealing that it was his idea to land a role on the series after he found out that Harrison Ford’s character, Dr. Paul Rhoades, has Parkinson’s disease. Fox was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 1991 and publicly announced his condition in 1998. The actor personally called “Shrinking” creator Bill Lawrence to inquire about a role on the comedy.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t “I said, ‘You did a show about Parkinson’s, and you didn’t call me?’ And he said, ‘Oh, you want to do it?’ And I said, ‘I’d love to do it,’” Fox said. “So he said, ‘Let me think about it, see what I can do.’ So he went to work on it and came up with this concept, it’s really good.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was the first time ever I get to show up on-set, and I didn’t have to worry about am I too tired or coughing or anything,” Fox added. “I just do it. It was really good, because for the moments when I say, ‘I’m not going to be able to do this,’ then I say, ‘Well, I’ll just deal with how I can’t do it in the scene.’ And you get through it.” </p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking about living with Parkinson’s more generally, Fox concluded: “I wake up and get the message of what the day is gonna be like, and I try to adjust to it. I keep getting new challenges physically, and I get through it. I roll around in a wheelchair a lot, and it took some getting used to. You take the good, and you seize it.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also appears ending his acting retirement from “Shrinking” has reignited Fox’s acting bug a bit. As he explained: “I see other people’s work, and it makes me think that I might be able to find something that’s for me as an actor and as a writer. And as a parent, husband and friend, I have a lot left to do.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile plot details for “Shrinking” Season 3 remain under wraps, it appears likely that Fox and Ford will be sharing the screen as characters both living with Parkinson’s. Ford <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/features/harrison-ford-interview-shrinking-season-3-emmy-marvel-future-1236473787/\">told <em>Variety</em></a> earlier this year that having Fox join the show was “essential.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Michael’s courage, his fortitude and his grace, more than anything else, is on full display. He’s very smart, very brave, noble, generous, passionate guy, and an example to all of us, whether we’re facing Parkinson’s or not,” Ford said. “You cannot help but recognize how amazing it is to have such grace… Parkinson’s is not funny. And I want to get it right. It’s necessary to be correct with what we do in respect of the challenge that Parkinson’s represents, and that we don’t use it for its entertainment value.”</p>\n<div><p>\n\tFox originally announced his acting retirement in 2020 via his book, “No Time Like the Future,” where he told fans that his Parkinson’s was making it too difficult to be on set and to memorize lines.</p><p>“The nascent diminishment in my ability to download words and repeat them verbatim is just the latest ripple in the pond,” Fox wrote at the time. “There are reasons for my lapses in memorization — be they age, cognitive issues with the disease, distraction from the constant sensations of Parkinson’s, or lack of sensation because of the spine — but I read it as a message, an indicator.” </p></div>\n<p>\n\t“There is a time for everything, and my time of putting in a twelve-hour workday, and memorizing seven pages of dialogue, is best behind me,” he added. “At least for now…. In fairness to myself and to producers, directors, editors, and poor beleaguered script supervisors, not to mention actors who enjoy a little pace, I enter a second retirement. That could change, because everything changes. But if this is the end of my acting career, so be it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile Fox had been offscreen since “The Good Fight” prior to “Shrinking,” he did hit the press circuit in 2023 in support of his Apple TV+ documentary “Still.” He said participating in the movie was a “big thrill” and told <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.etonline.com/michael-j-fox-says-hes-open-to-acting-again-after-announcing-retirement-exclusive-222852\">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2024 that “if something came up that I could put my realities into it — my challenges — if I could figure it out” then he’d considering returning to acting. </p>\n<p>\n\t“If someone offers me a [new] part, and I do it, and I have a good time, great,” he added at the time.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tApple TV+ has not yet announced when Fox’s season of “Shrinking” will begin.<br /></p>\n</div>",

The official logline for Season 2 states “Cross is in pursuit of a ruthless vigilante who is hunting down corrupt billionaire magnates.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAlong with Hodge, the Season 2 cast includes new additions Matthew Lillard, Jeanine Mason and Wes Chatham as well as returning stars Isaiah Mustafa, Alona Tal, Samantha Walkes, Juanita Jennings, Caleb Elijah, Melody Hurd, and Johnny Ray Gill.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Cross” was developed for television by Ben Watkins, who also serves as executive producer and showrunner.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe theme for this year’s New York City LGBTQ film festival <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/newfest/\">NewFest</a> is “queer film is an act of rebellion.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“We are in a moment when we need to be raising our voices,” the festival’s executive director David Hatkoff tells me ahead of the fest’s opening tonight. “We need to be making our presence known. We need to be telling the world and those who would like to marginalize us or erase us entirely that we’re not going anywhere…I think what festivals like NewFest do is create a space where people can be in community, be reminded that they are part of something bigger than themselves and even experience joy as an act of rebellion.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOne film that certainly presents unapologetic queer storytelling is “Fucktoys.” The NSFW John Waters-esque dark comedy from writer and director Annapurna Sriram follows a stripper and sex worker (Sriram) in a fictional locale called Trashtown as she tries to come up with $1,000 to pay a tarot card reader (Big Freedia) to help rid her of a mysterious curse.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I feel like it personifies the spirit of ‘queer film is an act of rebellion’ so beautifully,” Hatkoff says. “We can march in the streets but we can also get 500 queer folks in a room to laugh their asses off at an absolutely riotous film like ‘Fucktoys.’ The laughter that is going to be echoing through the walls of the SVA theater on Friday night, that is rebellion.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the film, “13 Reasons Why” star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/brandon-flynn/\">Brandon Flynn</a> plays an actor working in the area who hires a trans male sex worker (Sadie Scott) for an afternoon of kinky delights.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFlynn’s scenes are not for prudish pearl-clutchers. At one point, he’s shown being fisted while wearing a rubber jockstrap and a gold-painted penis extender.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis character’s name is – get ready for it! – James Francone. “It obviously brings up some familiar names in the industry, but he’s really an amalgamation of a couple actors that I pulled from in crafting him,” Flynn says. “One of these actors had starred in a movie that was kind of autobiographical for him, and he said in an interview how the character he was playing had a bigger appendage than he did. So he basically wore like an extender so that he could feel like he had a bigger one. I was like, ‘That is actually perfectly insane.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the fisting sequence, Flynn explains he relishes going out of his comfort zone to discover and embrace unexpected performances. But, more simply, he says he knows of well-known actors who are into kinky play. “I happen to know plenty of sex workers who have had to sign NDAs for very high-profile clients,” Flynn says. “I think it was an interesting and truthful element to the story that Annapurna was telling, which is that there are these hypocrisies and dual worlds and infrastructures and systems that are constantly in friction with each other.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BrandonFlynn_011a44.jpg 2116w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BrandonFlynn_011a44.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BrandonFlynn_011a44.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BrandonFlynn_011a44.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BrandonFlynn_011a44.jpg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BrandonFlynn_011a44.jpg?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BrandonFlynn_011a44.jpg?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BrandonFlynn_011a44.jpg?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BrandonFlynn_011a44.jpg?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BrandonFlynn_011a44.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Sadie Scott and Brandon Flynn in “Fucktoys.”</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tIn the works for Flynn is starring as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/james-dean/\">James Dean</a> in “Willy and Jimmy Dean,” a biopic about the icon’s supposed gay college romance with William Bast. Written and to be directed by Guy Guido, the film is based on Bast’s 2006 memoir, “Surviving James Dean.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile rumors of Dean being more fluid than not have persisted since his untimely death at just age 24 in 1955, Flynn doesn’t mince words when asked why it’s taken so long for his queer life to be tackled in a movie. “The short answer is I just think the whole world is just so fucking homophobic,” Flynn says. “He really became the ideal masculine icon. Like hardcore, James Dean is what a real man is. But he was also emotional. I think that shakes people, especially people’s fragile heterosexuality. I think it’s important that we reveal these stories because Jimmy wasn’t the only one.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFlynn has been openly gay for most – if not, all – of his career. “I can’t imagine living any other way,” he says. “I’m proud to be an out actor and I’ll sing it from the rooftops.

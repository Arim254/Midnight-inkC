    "body": "\n\tSeason 5 of “Stranger Things” joined Netflix‘s list of its most popular English-language TV titles of all time immediately after becoming eligible with the release of the series finale on New Year’s Eve.\n\n\tAs a whole, the season has reached 105.7 million views so far. Netflix compiles its all-time list by counting views across each title’s first 91 days of viewing; for batched releases like “Stranger Things,” views are counted through each volume’s first 91 days. As such, because Volume 1 of “Stranger Things” Season 5 debuted on Nov. 26, those four episodes will continue to accrue chart viewership through Feb. 24, while Volume 2’s three episodes will be counted from Dec. 25 to March 25 and finale viewership will count from Dec. 31 to March 31.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTherefore, “Stranger Things” Season 5 has three months to continue climbing higher on the all-time chart. With its current spot as No. 9, it knocked “Fool Me Once” off the chart and surpassed Season 1 of “The Night Agent.” Season 4 of “Stranger Things,” which was released in 2022, remains No. 3 on the chart to this day (140.7 million), outranked only by “Wednesday” Season 1 (252.1 million views) and “Adolescence” (142.6 million). Given that “Stranger Things” Season 5 achieved with Netflix’s biggest-ever opening for an English-language series with 59.6 million views, it seems possible that the sci-fi series’ final entry could make it to No. 1.\n\n\n\tNaturally, “Stranger Things” Season 5 was the most-watched title of the week Dec. 29-Jan. 4, during with the finale was available for five days, hitting 31.5 million views overall. While Netflix did not provide a viewership total for the finale alone, it should be noted that the weekly total would have been even higher if not for Netflix’s decision to concurrently debut the finale in movie theaters, where it earned more than $25 million.\n\t\n\n\tAdditionally, all previous seasons of “Stranger Things” continued to chart for the sixth week in a row: Season 1 ranked at No. 3 with 7.6 million views, Season 2 was No. 5 with 5.5 million, Season 3 was No. 7 with 5 million and Season 4 was No. 8 with 4.8 million.\n\n\tBesides “Stranger Things,” the Netflix Top 10 for Dec. 29-Jan. 4 featured Harlan Coben’s “Run Away,” which debuted at No. 2 with 12.7 million views in its first four days of availability. Season 5 of “Emily in Paris” ranked at No. 4 with 7.4 million views in its third week on the chat. At No. 6 was the Ricky Gervais special “Mortality,” which debuted with 5.1 million views in six days. “Man vs. Baby” had its fourth week on the chart at No. 9 with 4 million views and was followed by “Dave Chappelle: The Unstoppable…” at No. 10 with 2.8 million views. \n\n\tSee the Netflix Top 10 for Dec. 29-Jan. 4 below, beginning with English-language shows and movies and followed by non-English-language shows and movies. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“I swear to God. I’m going to kill myself,” Kristen Stewart says, ribbing her longtime friend Jesse Eisenberg for watching her directorial debut, “The Chronology of Water,” on his laptop.  \n\n\tThe “Twilight” star, who earned an Oscar nomination for portraying Princess Diana in “Spencer,” vowed to quit acting until she could adapt Lidia Yuknavitch’s 2011 stream-of-conscious memoir about a young woman (played by Imogen Poots), sexually abused as a child, who eventually finds her voice through writing and swimming. Stewart didn’t labor for nearly a decade to secure the film’s financing only for someone to see her passion project on a computer screen.  \n\t\n\n\t“It’s supposed to be a sonic experience,” she sighs and keeps roasting Eisenberg. “You know about movies? Have you ever made a movie?” \n\n\tStewart and Eisenberg met on 2009’s coming-of-age comedy “Adventureland” and reunited on 2015’s stoner adventure “American Ultra” and Woody Allen’s 2016 romantic drama “Cafe Society.” Since then, Eisenberg has directed two films, 2022’s dramedy “When You Finish Saving the World” and 2024’s Oscar-nominated “A Real Pain.” So yeah, he knows something about making movies, as well as a director’s desire for audiences to see them on the big screen. \n\n\t“I’m aware of that and was taking all of that into account,” Eisenberg wryly retorts before complimenting his pal. “I was astounded. I’ve never seen something made like this by someone I know who is also funny.” \n\n\tStewart and Eisenberg continue to tease each other during their conversation, in which they discuss how directing has changed their perspective as actors and whether they care if their films make money.  \n\t\n\n\tJesse Eisenberg: Are you OK? \n\n\tKristen Stewart: That should be the intro: “Are you OK?” I’m not kidding. That’s often how we greet each other. \n\n\tEisenberg: We’ve known each other for a long time — 15 years, right? \n\n\tStewart: I was 17 when we met. I’m 35. \n\n\tEisenberg: Oh my God, really? I saw your movie 24 hours ago. I was blown away. My first thought was “We can do that? I didn’t know we could do that.” It’s unbelievably audacious. You read this book, but how did you convey it to other people? (I know these are junket questions.) What does the script look like?  \n\n\tStewart: You and I are fairly shy people, but there’s an innate, stifling invisibility that women have to grapple with, even if they weren’t abused by their father. I didn’t want to make statements, like, “This is what the movie’s about.” There was just something about the book that spoke to the universality of being a young girl trying to excavate a voice that’s been told to shut up.  \n\n\tEisenberg: You and I have the advantage of being known actors. It allows, or maybe gives, us the responsibility to make something that’s harder to convey. Is that part of the reason you were able to do something so abstract? The result is astounding, but that’s not guaranteed.  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBenedict Evans for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tStewart: It wasn’t easy for me to make the movie. It took eight years. People that love me were genuinely sick and tired of hearing me be so upset about it. And then those things are baked into the plot of the movie. It’s about the malleability of our realities. I had to continuously remind people that we were doing a poem. \n\n\tEisenberg: What I was asking before, if I can ask it better, is — \n\n\tStewart: I can answer it better. \n\n\tEisenberg: This is my question: Did you feel a responsibility to make something unusual because you’re a well-known actor, or is this just entirely your taste? \n\n\tStewart: This is entirely my taste. I could never make something straightforward. I like associative, open-ended things that say something very particular but invite people to disagree.  \n\n\tEisenberg: How did your taste develop? \n\n\tStewart: I don’t like being told what to do. I don’t want to tell people what to do. \n\t\n\n\tEisenberg: I read something you said, which I thought was funny and reminded me of myself. Somebody asked you, “Do you think of being an actor in a movie differently now?” You’re like, “Of course. I’ll go to the director and say, ‘I’ll do whatever you want me to do.’”  \n\n\tStewart: I’ll never question anything again. I’m like, “Anything you want.” The idea of being like, “You should cast this person.” I’m like, “Excuse me? You don’t know anything.” \n\n\tEisenberg: Isn’t that fascinating? A lot of people in our position go the other way. They feel even more like they need control because they have an experience where they were controlling everything. The story I always tell about you — because I’ve been asked about you for 18 years — is when we were doing “Adventureland,” there was a dramatic scene at night, and you were like, “Cut. I’m lying.” You were 17, and I was shocked. I felt like I was watching a master. Would you have done that now? \n\n\tStewart: I get mad at people now for cutting, because I’m like, “I know you questioned yourself, but that moment of question was gold.” I want to try and not do that. [As an actor] I don’t want to be misinterpreted. When a director is like, “It seemed like you were feeling it.” I always say, “I don’t care if it looks good; I want to do it again.” I’m selfish. I want to taste it.  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBenedict Evans for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEisenberg: “I want the catharsis.” One of the other stories I tell from “Adventureland” was a quick scene. I had my first panic attack on set; I was self-aware in the worst way, and I shut down. After the tape, I was mortified. Greg [Mottola, the director] goes, “I didn’t notice, but I’m so sorry you felt that way.” He said, “I don’t understand how actors aren’t having panic attacks all the time. You’re in front of strangers, and you have to be vulnerable.” For years, I remember thinking, “It’s a sweet thing he said, but he’s pitying actors too much. We’re lucky. We have an easy job. We memorize lines.”  \n\n\tNow I have respect for the job in a way I never did personally. Because I was so self-critical, I couldn’t have a good feeling about it. It seemed like, “You’re overpaying me.” Then Julianne Moore was in my movie, and after her first scene, I turned to my producer and was like, “Can we pay her more?” Did you have that feeling with Imogen? I’ve done three movies with her. But not in the same way I’ve done three movies with you. How did you choose her?  \n\t\n\n\tStewart: You’re one of the reasons. I was like, “I’m sure we would be close because you guys are friends.” She did an audition. She sent a tape and I was like, “Oh my God.” There’s something  about her being 35 and me being 35. We should have been friends since we were younger. We just never met. Then we did, and it was the perfect time to go, “We need to shove everything we’ve never said to each other into this movie.” \n\n\tEisenberg: Do you feel you could have this style and use it going forward? \n\n\tStewart: I’m always asked if I would continue to work as an actor in studio films, or if feels like you’re selling a homogenized idea that doesn’t land on an individual, necessarily, but satisfies a group? I wouldn’t be good at that job.  \n\n\tEisenberg What do you mean? To direct a more commercial thing? \n\n\tStewart: More and more, commercial means standard and digestible. I want to be allowed to make movies that allow for time to figure out a structure and mission statement. The next movie I want to make utilizes different formats. Not because it’s nerdy film stuff, but because it’s more interesting to make movies about how you see something instead of what you see. \n\n\tEisenberg: Your movie is coming out soon. Do you think or care about it making money?  \n\n\tStewart: It would be great if it did because then maybe it wouldn’t be as difficult to make my next movie. But at the same time, the next movie I want to make functions outside of the business structure we’re used to. People love to hear that. \n\n\tEisenberg: “This doesn’t even exist in your structure.”  \n\n\tStewart: Well, it doesn’t. You need to find new terms for all of this because, I’m sorry, but the language and structure are oppressive.  \n\n\tEisenberg: There’s no English on this set. It doesn’t apply to what we’re doing. \n\n\tStewart: Actually, the title of the movie is in Spanish. I’m not going to tell you what it is. \n\n\tEisenberg: I wouldn’t understand it. \n\n\tStewart: Yeah, you’re just a dummy. \n\n\tEisenberg: So you care insofar as it helps you make the next one. You care insofar as it pays the people back who paid for it. But you’re not caring about what other people might think about it? People ask me too. I guess I don’t care about it being a successful business thing. My mind doesn’t go there, or I can’t conceive of it. \n\t\n\n\tStewart: For sure. I love the movie. I birthed it. I probably would have made this movie if I was never an actor. I didn’t feel like I was graduating into like, “Now I want to check that box.” I think this thing needs to exist. \n\n\tEisenberg: We’re directing everything, but we’re also desperate actors. So all I’ll say is this: I can learn Spanish for your next project. \n\n\tStewart: You need to put yourself on tape. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTGL’s second season kicks off today, with the league’s first event of the year taking place at the SoFi Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. The tech-forward, team-based league founded by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy carved out a new lane in the golf calendar last year with its fast-paced, shot clock and made-for-TV format.\n\n\tThe opening match of the 2026 TGL calendar features a high-stakes rematch between The Bay Golf Club and Atlanta Drive GC, revisiting one of last season’s most consequential playoff moments. The Bay, represented by Wyndham Clark, Shane Lowry, Min Woo Lee and Ludvig Aberg, will be looking to avenge a playoff loss to Atlanta, whose lineup includes Justin Thomas, Patrick Cantlay, Lucas Glover and Billy Horschel. Last season, Atlanta eliminated The Bay 9-3 in the Semifinals, though The Bay secured a narrow 6-5 victory in regular-season play, setting up a compelling battle for the season opener.\n\n\n\tChannel: ESPNLive Stream: Hulu + Live TV, Fubo, Sling TV, DIRECTVStart Time: 5 p.m. ET\n\t\n\t\tHow to Watch TGL Season Opener Online for Free\t\n\n\tTo watch TGL’s first event of the year, you’ll need access to ESPN, either through cable or a live TV streaming service like YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, Fubo, Sling TV, or DIRECTV Stream. ESPN+ alone won’t cut it — but there are multiple streaming options if you’re watching without cable.\n\n\tESPN is available on DIRECTV, which currently offers a five-day free trial for new subscribers. The service is also running a $49.99 first-month promotion on its base package, after which their standard pricing of $79.99 applies. \n\n\n\tIf you want an all-in-one streaming bundle, Hulu + Live TV carries ESPN along with a broad mix of sports, news, and entertainment channels. Plans start at $82.99 per month and include Hulu’s on-demand library, Disney+, and ESPN+. A 3-day free trial is available for new subscribers.\n\n\tThe most budget-friendly way to watch ESPN live is through Sling TV’s Orange plan. Pricing starts at $40 per month, and while Sling does not offer a free trial, it remains one of the lowest-cost options for live ESPN access without cable. You can get a 1-Day Pass for $4.99 if you want to stream the event without needing to commit to a full subscription. \n\n\tBuilt with sports fans in mind, Fubo offers ESPN as part of its live TV packages. Plans begin at $79.99 per month, with support for streaming across smart TVs, mobile devices, and desktop browsers. Fubo offers a 7-day free trial for first-time subscribers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHere’s one Olympic competition that is now closed to certain entrants.\n\n\tNBCUniversal said Tuesday that it has sold out of all the commercial inventory tied to its coming telecast of the 2026 Winter Olympics from Milan Cortina, offering the latest example of the growing dependence traditional media companies have on sports and live events. The ad-sales milestone comes after NBC has dispensed with all the ad time tied to its looming February broadcast of Super Bowl LX as well as the NBA All-Star Game. The three events boosted NBCU’s status in last year’s “upfront” sales market.\n\t\n\n\tNBCU sold approximately $900 million in advertising tied to each of its most recent Winter Olympics efforts, the 2022 Games from Beijing and the 2018 spectacular from PyeongChang. The company said its Milan Winter Olympics had secured “the highest linear and digital revenue in Winter Olympics history,” without offering a specific number.\n\n\n\t“For the first time in our company’s history, we have seen such unprecedented demand that we are officially sold out of our inventory this far in advance of a Games,” said Peter Lazarus, executive vice president of NBC Sports & Olympics, Advertising and Partnerships, in a statement. “We are excited to once again deliver fans a word class viewing experience; while providing brands the powerful halo effect the Olympics has to offer.”  \n\n\tNBC had reason to focus on sports ad sales. The company had hundreds of hours of sports to sell last year, with a February that is crammed with Olympics telecasts, Super Bowl programming and NBA matches. More is on the way, with a new rights deal with Major League Baseball that will give NBC games to show on Sunday nights in the interim between its NBA and NFL deals.\n\t\n\n\t“With the resurgence of the Olympic movement, our strongest Sports Upfront in history, the early sell out of Super Bowl LX, and the remarkable return of the NBA, NBCUniversal has solidified itself as a sports powerhouse and brands have taken notice,” said Mark Marshall, chairman, global advertising & partnerships, NBCUniversal, in a statement. \n\n\tNBCU is harnessing momentum from its recent Summer Olympics telecast from Paris. The event relied more heavily on bespoke streaming experiences, smart curation of events for broadcast primetime and lots of celebrity cameos. The company said more than 100 advertisers committing to the Winter Olympics were new to the event. Nearly 60 invested in unique elements tied to the Games and more than a dozen invested in sponsorships that will offer fans more live sports viewing.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBen Affleck appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” amid his press tour for Netflix’s “The Rip” and looked back on the “massive embarrassment” of being snubbed at the Oscars for best director with “Argo.” Affleck was a frontrunner to land a nom. He won best director honors at the Golden Globes, Critics Choice Awards and BAFTAs. Alas, Affleck was snubbed while “Argo” went on to earn seven Oscar nominations and win best picture and two other prizes.\n\t\n\n\t“It was the year, the horrible thing of everyone telling you, ‘You’re gonna get nominated, you’re gonna get nominated for director,’” Affleck remembered. “And so, of course, I wake up that morning, and sure enough — and, by the way, it’s not [unlike] any other morning that I had not been nominated for best director. But all of a sudden, it’s a massive embarrassment. I woke up and people [said], ‘You didn’t get nominated.’”\n\n\n\tAffleck’s story reminded Kimmel of being at the Critics Choice Awards the night prior, where “Once Battle After Another” picked up major honors for best picture, director and adapted screenplay but left leading man Leonardo DiCaprio shut out for best actor (which went to Timothee Chalamet for “Marty Supreme”).\n\n\n\t“I was thinking, boy, he’s got so many better places to be,” Kimmel quipped about DiCaprio. “And the movie wins best picture. The director Paul Thomas Anderson wins best director, and then he doesn’t win. And I’m thinking he must be so pissed that [he had to leave] whatever he got airlifted from — a yacht somewhere — and couldn’t be there anymore. He came to lose.”\n\t\n\n\t“This is maybe the worst award-show situation ever,” Kimmel continued. “I think you’re underselling this. Because ‘Argo,’ not only was it nominated for the Oscar for best picture, you won best picture. You starred in it and directed it, and you were not nominated in either category … it’s as if the movie directed itself.”\n\n\t“That’s sort of what it felt like,” Affleck replied. “The day of the snub, which all of a sudden it’s a negative event and a horrible thing, I had to go to the Critics Choice Awards. I remember getting there and there’s a red carpet line, like 500 people dying to talk to me, and every single one of them was like, ‘Hi! So the snub…’ What do you say to that? ‘It’s a bummer!’ I did end up winning the Critics Choice Award.”\n\n\t“Honestly, it’s just embarrassing,” Affleck added. “I wasn’t the one going out there being like, “I’m going to be nominated!’ It’s having to be put through the ritual of then answering for why you didn’t get nominated. I didn’t say I was [going to be]!”\n\n\tSomeone who can relate to what Affleck is talking about is Bradley Cooper, who was similarly snubbed for best director with “A Star Is Born” despite landing nominations from the Golden Globes, Critics’ Choice Awards and Directors Guild of America. Cooper also said the snub was “embarrassing.” \n\n\t“The first thing I felt was embarrassment, actually. Think about it. I felt embarrassed that I didn’t do my part,” Cooper told Oprah in 2019. “Even if I got the nomination, it should not give me any sense of whether I did my job or not. That’s the trick, to make something that you believe in.”\n\n\tCooper explained that did not set out to make a movie that landed Academy Award nominations, adding: “The only thing I set out to do was to tap into as an authentic place as possible. [An authentic place] in myself and everybody I asked to make this movie — to tell a human story of people who are going to deal with their family life, trauma as a child, addiction in a real way, love in this life and finding your voice.”\n\n\tWatch Affleck’s full interview on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tHenry Winkler is attached to star in a legal comedy in development at NBC titled “Last Chance Lawyer.”\n\n\tIn the series, Winkler would play Howard Greenberg, a hard-driving and unconventional criminal defense attorney who is a fierce advocate for his underdog clients. He believes “no matter what they are accused of, the system is always guiltier.” (Here’s hoping Howard is more competent than Barry Zuckerkorn, the attorney Winkler played on “Arrested Development.”)\n\t\n\n\t“Last Chance Lawyer” is written by Mike Gagerman and Andrew Waller, who executive produce alongside Winkler, Jed Mercurio and Jimmy Mulville via Hat Trick Media. Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, is the studio behind the project.\n\n\n\tWinkler is best known for embodying the leather jacket-wearing 1970s and ’80s icon Arthur Fonzarelli, aka the Fonz, on the ABC sitcom “Happy Days.” He recently starred opposite Bill Hader on the HBO dark comedy “Barry,” for which Winkler won his first Primetime Emmy, for best supporting actor in a comedy. As mentioned above, he also had a kooky recurring role on “Arrested Development,” and he had memorable roles opposite Adam Sandler in “The Waterboy” and “Click.” He recently starred in the crime thriller “Normal” opposite Bob Odenkirk, and his additional credits include “Night Shift,” “Here Comes the Boom,” “Heroes,” “Holes” and “Scream.” Next up, he’ll be seen in the music festival comedy “Rolling Loud.” He is also the accomplished children’s book writer behind the Hank Zipzer series, and he and his co-author Lin Oliver have together penned 40 kids’ novels.\n\t\n\n\tGagerman and Waller are longtime writing partners whose Blacklist feature spec “Search Party” was produced by Universal and starred Adam Pally and Alison Brie.\n\n\tDeadline broke the news.\n",

    "body": "\n\tUniversal Music Group, which has taken a leadership role in industry relations with AI businesses and creators, has announced a collaboration with NVIDIA to pioneer what it describes as responsible AI for music discovery, creation, and engagement leveraging the platform’s AI infrastructure and UMG’s massive music catalog.\n\n\tAccording to the announcement, the two companies will undertake collaborative research and development to promote shared objectives of advancing human music creation and rightsholder compensation; and will utlize  AI to “elevate discovery, engagement and consumption beyond current constructs of search and personalization. Further, the companies will pursue new approaches to leverage AI in order to protect artists’ work and ensure proper attribution of music-based content.”\n\t\n\n\tAs part of this effort, the two companies are extending the NVIDIA Music Flamingo model to enhance fans’ music discovery by processing full-length tracks to capture harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context. Goals also include to enhance fan engagement and encourage artists to use creation tools.\n\n\n\tUMG chairman-CEO Lucian Grainge says, “We’re excited to establish this ground-breaking strategic relationship which unites the world’s leading technology company with the world’s leading music company in a shared mission to harness revolutionary AI technology to dramatically advance the interests of the creative community and the role of music in global culture. We eagerly embrace the opportunities that AI presents, and the fact that NVIDIA is choosing to take a leadership position in the tech industry in their commitment to responsible AI principles is critically important.”\n\t\n\n\t“We’re entering an era where a music catalog can be explored like an intelligent universe — conversational, contextual, and genuinely interactive”, said Richard Kerris, NVIDIA VP/GM of Media. “By extending NVIDIA’s Music Flamingo with UMG’s unmatched catalog and creative ecosystem, we’re going to change how fans discover, understand, and engage with music on a global scale. And we’ll do it the right way: responsibly, with safeguards that protect artists’ work, ensure attribution, and respect copyright.”\n\n\t+ Independent publishing and neighboring rights powerhouse Peermusic has promoted Paul Smelt to chief operating officer, CEO Mary Megan Peer announced. In the newly created role, Smelt will oversee the administration of the company’s publishing (copyright and royalties) and neighboring rights (repertoire and distributions) for from its Amsterdam office and will report to the CEO.\n\n\tSmelt was previously COO of Peermusic Neighbouring Rights and joined the company when it acquired Global Master Rights, the neighboring rights company he co-founded with Erik Veerman (who is now managing director of Peermusic Neighboring Rights). Earlier, he co-founded Global Master Rights in 2014 and worked at neighboring rights organization SENA.\n\n\tMary Megan Peer commented: “Paul has been crucial in the integration of the three neighboring rights companies we acquired in 2020 as their COO. We look forward to his continued success as he takes on this role in supporting our publishing operations as well.”\n\n\t+ ASCAP has promoted Hayley Dukes to senior VP of licensing. In her new role she will continue to report to the company’s head of licensing Stephanie Ruyle. She joined ASCAP in 2020 after roles at AMC Networks and HBO.\n\n\t“Hayley’s deep knowledge of audiovisual industry operations has made her a key player on the ASCAP licensing team. I’m looking forward to working further with her as we continue to respond to licensee needs in the evolving media landscape while driving fair compensation for ASCAP members,” said Ruyle.\n\n\t+ Landr, the Montreal-based AI-powered music production company, has announced the acquisition of Reason Studios, the Stockholm-based company behind the iconic Reason Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) and Reason Rack. The two companies will also establish an Artist Council made up of producers and longtime users of Reason. According to the announcement, Reason Studios will continue to operate as its own brand.\n\t\n\n\t“Our vision is to make Reason and the Reason Rack indispensable tools for every producer, regardless of what DAW they use,” said Landr CEO Pascal Pilon. “Wherever music is made, Reason will be there, with its amazing instruments, effects, and iconic analog workflow–enhanced by LANDR’s value-rich creator tools.”\n\n\t+ Big Machine Label Group has promoted Jay Cruze to national director of radio strategy, representing Big Machine Records, the Valory Music Co., and Nashville Harbor Records & Entertainment. He joined Big Machine in 2023 from iHeartMedia, following promotion roles at Average Joes Entertainment and Bigger Picture Group.\n\n\t“Jay was an exceptional addition to Big Machine Records three years ago and his impact has only continued to expand across the entire label group,” says EVP/GM Kris Lamb. “His deep understanding of national programming, paired with the trust and relationships he has built at radio, has become a powerful asset for our company.”\n\n\t+ Digital ticket delivery service True Tickets has promoted Ken Lesnik to chief commercial officer and Kirk Mortensen to chief product officer. Since he joined the company in 2019 Lesnik has helped to forge relationships with more than 100 leading arts and cultural organizations across the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Australia. This includes institutions such as the Royal Ballet and Opera in London, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, New York City Ballet, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and Center Theatre Group in Los Angeles. Mortensen had served as head of product since 2022.\n\n\t“Ken and Kirk have helped lead this company through some of its most pivotal chapters,” said Matt Zarracina, CEO of True Tickets. “Their contributions have shaped so much of who we are as a company, and their new roles reflect the leadership they’ve already been demonstrating day in and day out.”\n",

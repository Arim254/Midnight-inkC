    "body": "\n\t“Paradise” has a Season 2 premiere date at Hulu. \n\n\tDuring the show’s panel at Brazil Comic-Con, it was revealed that the second season of the drama series will debut its first three episodes on Feb. 23, with new episodes dropping weekly thereafter on Hulu and Hulu and Hulu on Disney+ for bundle subscribers in the US and Disney+ internationally.\n\n\tHulu also released the first teaser for Season 2, which can be seen below. In the teaser, Xavier (Sterling K. Brown) is seen in the wreckage of a plane with voiceovers teasing that he is searching for his wife in the outside world. \n\t\n\n\tAlong with Brown, the cast of Season 2 includes Julianne Nicholson, Sarah Shahi, Nicole Brydon Bloom, Krys Marshall, Enuka Okuma, Aliyah Mastin, Percy Daggs IV and Charlie Evans, with recurring guest stars James Marsden, Shailene Woodley, Thomas Doherty, and Jon Beavers.\n\n\n\tThe official logline for the new season states, “Xavier searches for Teri (Okuma) out in the world and learns how people survived the three years since The Day. Back in Paradise, the social fabric frays as the bunker deals with the aftermath of Season 1, and new secrets are uncovered about the city’s origins.”\n\n\t“Paradise” was renewed for a second season back in February before the first season had ended, which came as little surprise given the show’s strong viewership and reviews. It was created by Dan Fogelman, who also executive produces. Brown is an executive producer in addition to starring. Additional executive producers include Jess Rosenthal, John Hoberg, Steve Beers, Glenn Ficarra, and John Requa. 20th Television is the studio. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tErige Sehiri’s “Promised Sky” won top honors at the Marrakech Film Festival on Saturday, capping a lively year for the Moroccan event, marked by swelling audiences and deeper integration into the global awards circuit. \n\n\tHeralded by Variety’s Tomris Laffly as “a unique drama about marginalized African immigrant women fighting for their dignity and place not in Europe… but on their own continent,” the film follows four generations of Ivorian immigrant women who navigate moments of support, tension and displacement. Their already complex bonds grow ever more strained in a country of entrenched social and economic divides.\n\t\n\n\t“As a Tunisian woman myself, I’m deeply frustrated to see that we can’t welcome migrants with dignity, even though we’re from a country with such a wide diaspora,” Sehiri said. “We act as if we weren’t all living on the same continent, as if we weren’t all Africans.” \n\n\n\tThe film opened this year’s Un Certain Regard, ahead of standout showings in London, Zurich and Lugano. Its top prize in Marrakech further strengthens the festival’s reputation as a key launchpad where first and second features can build momentum, widen their exposure and connect emerging auteurs with some of the most influential figures in world cinema.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe jury — led by director Bong Joon-ho and joined by Jenna Ortega, Anya Taylor-Joy, Julia Ducournau, Celine Song, Karim Aïnouz, Hakim Belabbes and Payman Maadi — jointly awarded Jihan K’s “My Father and Qaddafi” and Vladlena Sandu’s “Memory” with the aptly named Jury Prize. They also singled out the absurdist war comedy “Straight Circle,” giving actors Luke Tittensor and Elliott Tittensor a special mention and honoring filmmaker Oscar Hudson with the festival’s directing trophy.\n\t\n\n\t“My Father’s Shadow” and “Promised Land” leads Sope Dirisu and Debora Lobe Naney won the respective best actor and best actress awards — the latter by unanimous vote, as the jurors made sure to point out. \n\n\tFor its 22nd edition, the Marrakech Film Festival drew over 45,000 attendees, surpassing last year’s record by 5,000. Young adults and students from Moroccan film schools played a key role in this surge, a success largely credited to an outreach program aimed at engaging youth audiences in Rabat and Marrakech in the months leading up to the festival. \n\n\tThe strategy clearly paid off, resulting in full-capacity screenings and lively discussions every day. (It wouldn’t be entirely accurate to call the events “sold out,” as all screenings are free of charge—a factor no doubt contributing to their broad appeal.)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAltogether, nearly 400 eager attendees had to be turned away from a standing-room-only, geopolitically charged conversation with Jafar Panahi, which accompanied a screening of his Palme d’Or-winning film “It Was Just an Accident” — two of this edition’s most coveted events. \n\n\tMeanwhile, the world premiere of the Umm Kulthum biopic “El Set” set a new festival record, sparking a standing ovation that erupted into spontaneous dancing, leaving both organizers and audiences dazzled for more than ten minutes. \n\n\tFestival coordinator Ali Hajji was especially struck by the screening’s youthful audience. “I expected an older crowd,” he admits. “So it was striking to see so many young people, people in their twenties, born decades after she passed away [in 1975]. But the Moroccan public has a deep connection to Umm Kulthum, and that spans all generations. We fought hard to get it, and we’re glad it premiered here.”\n\n\tThe world premiere felt all the more significant given the fierce competition for the film and the nonstop circuit of Arab festivals from October through December (if you’re wondering why, blame the heat). \n\n\tHajji credits the festival’s Atlas Workshops industry program — which spotlit both “El Set” and “Promised Land” as works-in-progress last year — as central to Marrakech’s distinctive appeal. “They trusted us,” says Hajji. “And their experience at the Workshops made them want to come back.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tHulu has unveiled a first look at “The Testaments,” the upcoming sequel series to “The Handmaid’s Tale.” \n\n\tThe series, which is set to premiere in April 2026, is based on “The Handmaid’s Tale” author Margaret Atwood’s 2019 novel of the same name and is set in the dystopian theocracy of Gilead years after the events of the original series. “The Testaments,” per the official logline, “is a coming of age story that finds a new generation of young women in Gilead grappling with the bleak future that awaits them. For these young women, growing up in Gilead is all they have ever known, having no tangible memories of the outside world prior to their indoctrination into this life. Facing the prospect of being married off and living a life of servitude, they will be forced to search for allies, both new and old, to help in their fight for freedom and the life they deserve. \n\t\n\n\tThe cast includes Ann Dowd, Chase Infiniti, Lucy Halliday, Rowan Blanchard, Mattea Conforti, Isolde Ardies, Shechinah Mpumlwana and Birva Pandya. \n\n\n\tBruce Miller created “The Testaments” and serves as showrunner. He also executive produces alongside Warren Littlefield, Elisabeth Moss, Steve Stark, Shana Stein, Maya Goldsmith, John Weber, Sheila Hockin, Daniel Wilson, Fran Sears and Mike Barker, who will direct the first three episodes. MGM Television is the studio.\n\n\tBased on Atwood’s 1985 novel of the same name, “The Handmaid’s Tale” ran on Hulu for six seasons, premiering in 2017 and concluding earlier this year. \n\n\tSee the first look photos, which were first revealed during the CCXP film festival in São Paulo, Brazil, above and below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLucy Halliday\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChase Infiniti\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnn Dowd\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChase Infiniti\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShechinah Mpumlwana, Rowan Blanchard, Birva Pandya, Mattea Conforti, Chase Infiniti, Isolde Arides\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLucy Halliday, Chase Infiniti\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n",

With the small town of Maybrook searching for the lost children, it’s revealed that Gladys is harvesting and feeding off of their energy to stay alive, all while keeping their bodies in Alex’s basement. \n\t\n\n\tIn order to create Aunt Gladys’ look as she begins to visibly age throughout the film without the energy of the younger kids, special make-up effects designer Jason Collins began researching archives from the 1960s and photographers that were prominent in the era. “Upon conversations with Zach, we looked at Diane Arbus and Cindy Sherman photographs where it looked like your aunt was visiting Florida in the ’60s and played into those looks.”\n\n\n\tTo help amplify Gladys’ face shape, Collins created prosthetics that unlocked the inner darkness that lurks behind her rimmed glasses. “Underneath the look needed to be a ferociousness to her and needed to be an animal that was preying upon its victims. As a baseline, what we decided to do was change her profile up a bit and give her a beak. Amy’s got a really soft round face, so it gives her a little bit more of a hardness. We narrowed down her pupil so it looked like she was a sort of a bird of prey that was focusing on her victims. We also brought the gumline down and showed the nubs of the teeth.”\n\t\n\n\tAs Gladys attempts to blend in with the Lilly family and speak on behalf of Alex’s parents who are in a trance inside their house, makeup designer Leo Satkovich revealed the process in creating Gladys’ signature red lip that worked with the cinematography of the film. “Zach and Larkin [Seiple] wanted a very specific look. They designed their own LUTs (digital color profiles) for the film, which makes their oranges and their reds pop more. We played around with a lot of different colors for her lips.”\n\n\t“We applied the signature red lipstick which is Mac Retro Matte in Ruby Woo,” said Satkovich. “It had the right amount of blue in there to make everything else really pop and stand out against the rest of her makeup, especially since she was wearing the signature mid century robin’s egg blue eye shadow and the dark graphic eyeliner. Nothing about Gladys was subtle, but we tried to keep all the tones hot so that way they read accordingly on camera.”\n\n\tEven though audience members are first introduced to Gladys with her red wig, hair department head Melizah Wheat, who was recently nominated for a Critics Choice award for the film alongside Satkovich and Collins, created multiple wigs to highlight the character’s silhouette as she lurks around Maybrook. “We had one to four wigs of different looks. But then we had like three in rotation for those scenes like the nightmare sequence,” Wheat said. “The hair color was different to amplify the scene. The nightmares were in dark lighting and I really wanted it to pop, so I had to push to the naked eye. It’s still the same silhouette, except it’s a little more electrified.”\n\n\tWith the recent news of an Aunt Gladys prequel film, the “Weapons” artisans have their own dream ideas for Gladys’ origins before arriving to Maybrook. “I would love to see Gladys as a Pan Am flight attendant in 1968 based out of Boca Raton,” reveals Satkovich. “That’s where she based her look from!”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBUENOS AIRES — Memorable for its mass attendance of around 3,200 delegates, Ventana Sur, Latin America’s biggest film-TV market, closed its doors at the extraordinary Palacio de Libertad in central Buenos Aires on Dec. 5 underscoring both the region’s large high-energy talent and the considerable headwinds racking the international film-TV business. \n\n\t10 takeaways from this year’s mart-meet. \n\n\n\tFirst, the Big News: Netflix Buys Warner Bros for $82.7 billion\n\t\n\n\tThough hardly a Ventana Sur deal, naturally enough, it dominated Friday’s breakfast tittle-tattle in Buenos Aires. The major take is that it will close more doors than it opens for the international independent industry. “That’s difficult to judge,” Ampere Analysis’ Guy Bisson told Variety. “For the independent production sector, I’d come down on the side of it not being great news. Through control of Hollywood royalty combined with the dominant global streaming service, Netflix becomes in one fell swoop a Disney on steroids….and surely that means more production coming in-house,” he added.  \n\n\tAmbitious Genre Sells\n\n\tAnd some good news? Ambitious genre, whether upscale genre blending (Gustavo Hernández’s “El Susurro”), mystic epic (Colombia’s “The Awakening”) or a propulsive two brothers escape-the-mob noir thriller (Argentina’s “The Reborn”), all on Latido Films sales slate, are currently closing AFM deals in multiple major markets. In further genre news, Argentine genre label Del Toro Films (“On the 3rd Day,” “The Funeral Home”) closed at Ventana Sur to co-produce Colombian Ventana Sur project “I’ll Keep My Mouth Shut” (No Diré Nada), a horror thriller. Genre and thrillers lead international market business.    \n\t\n\n\tMore Good News: Enervating Latin American Animation\n\n\tGlimpsed at Ventana Sur unveils of Ibermedia Next, launched by Spain’s ICAA film agency tasking animation producers to experiment with new tech, often Blender, in international co-productions. For those involved in the 43 titles created – often shorts for potential features or series pilots – the results can look stunning. For the producers involved, Ibermedia Next has proved a gamechanger. “The technology allowed us to make more art,” Bernardita Ojeda at Chile’s Pájaro told a Ventana Sur industry audience. Integrating 3D with 2D, she was also able to attain richer 2D, she added. One short, “CALM,” mixed 3D, stop-motion, live action, shadow puppetry, traditional 2D with graphics, and simulations.” “We learnt so much,” said Asdrúbal Hiutzilhuitl Rivera, at México’s Sísmica Studio.\n\n\tAnimation: the Main Market Challenge\n\n\tIn September, France’s Unifrance released its 2024 export figures. Animation sagged for a fifth year running, hit mostly by a sharp downturn in U.S. buys, pubcasters’ cuts both in youth programs and specialised staff in kids and youth, and streamers’ turning away from animation in favor of entertainment and sports. Those same factors are whammying Latin American animation too. One case in point. As Disney’s “Zootopia 2” sprinted to $616.7 million through Tuesday, in a sign of the times, on Dec. 3 Disney+ Originals Boss Eric Schrier advised that Disney+ local programming teams stationed across Europe and Latin America are unlikely to take “kids and family” product, indicating that is the preserve of Disney’s U.S. HQ.\n\n\tThe large task for such high-energy animation hubs as the Quirino Awards, which has just announced new dates, is to try to ensure that animation from Latin America, Spain and Portugal is as competitive as it can be. The Quirino Lab, celebrated one week before Ventana Sur, is a step in that direction.\n\n\tBuzz Titles\n\n\tSome titles sparking good word of mouth at Ventana Sur: the Latido Films trio of “The Whisper,” “The Awakening” and “The Reborn,” with deals under the belt or closing in multiple main markets worldwide; Sofia Quirós’ “Awaiting Birds,” a clear winner in Primer Corte, Ventana Sur’s pix-in-post competition; animated feature “Utopia,” from Brazil’s Rafhael Barbosa, packing dazzling visuals and a window onto a little known part of Brazil’s history; “God’s Favorite Girl” in project forum Proyecta, adding partners – Woo Films – and nabbing a major prize;  “I Need to Be Loved,” from the least known of big winners at Fantastic! And “Heads or Tails?” the top title at RAI Cinema’s new sales unit, acquired by Samuel Goldwyn for the U.S. and screening at Ventana Sur. \n\t\n\n\tBusiness \n\n\tBusiness was done, and more than maybe thought. Variety revealed a slew of deals, often key cast or co-production alliances, on titles as they were unveiled in Ventana Sur’s 10 industry sections. It could have announced many more. At least 30 pick-up or sales deals will be announced in upcoming weeks. At Ventana Sur, by Saturday M-Appeal and Habanero Film Sales all closed or were closing worldwide sales pick-ups on Ventana Sur or Latin American titles. Paul Hudson at U.S. distributor Outsider Pictures was circling five to six titles by mid-market at Ventana Sur. Jinga sold eight titles, a mix of horror and action fare, to Brazil’s Encripta, a streaming licensing company.   \n\n\tAVOD: A Building Future\n\n\tThe question about sales is not so much their number as for how much they were sold. Though results vary wildly, Spanish-language movies now sell many major markets for four-figure sums, and not even high figures at that. “The international sales market is, in my opinion, in pretty bad shape, probably the worst ever,” said one seasoned sales agent. “The main challenge is that buyers are paying less than before for the same type of projects,” added another. So AVOD is coming increasingly on agents’ radar. “The international market is undergoing significant change. At AFM I met more AVOD platforms than I did all rights distributors. Distributors, aggregators and platforms all want non-exclusive AVOD worldwide, so it’s becoming like the Wild West. The audience has become accustomed to watching films for free on AVOD platforms like Tubi and various YouTube channels,” said Jinga Films’ Julian Richards. \n\n\t”The Bowfinger Method”\n\n\t2024 box office in Spain was 29% below pre-pandemic levels, though production costs up some 30%. Yet theatrical performance in local markets remains a key first platform for films. How can it be bulwarked? One solution, said María Luisa Gutierrez, producer of the “Father There Is Only One” film series, is what she calls the Bowfinger Method, after her company Bowfinger Intl. Pictures, talking at a conference at Ventana Sur. In essence, the Method is to “take decisions without all the elements to make those decisions, so to be faster.” One case in point. Bowfinger and S0ny saw a window of opportunity, releasing “Father There is Only One 2” on July 29, 2020, even though some cinema theaters in Spain were still closed. It grossed an extraordinary €12.9 million ($15.0 million), lending a vital lifeline to exhibitors during the pandemic. “We wanted to help theaters and thought a large part of a reduced market better than a smaller part of a more normal market,” Gutierrez argued. Another example: In 2024, Sony asked Bowfinger to produce a Spanish version of “Death at a Funeral” to release Easter Week of 2025: a tight turaround. Gutierrez realized some of Spain’s top actors would be available in the summer, since on holiday. Released on time, “Un funeral de locos” currently ranks as the seventh highest grossing Spanish movie of 2025. “Preparation is great, but it can go against a movie,” Gutiérrez said in Buenos Aires.    \n\t\n\n\tWhy Ventana Sur is a Must-Attend for Some Sales Agents\n\n\tDespite adverse markets, many sales agents and producers return year after year to Ventana Sur. “The value of attending Ventana Sur is getting a first look at titles through Primer Corte, Copia Final and the other sections that I just wouldn’t be able to cover if I didn’t attend. Nothing beats face to face conversation,” said Hudson. For many sales agents it’s more of an acquisition or cp-production play than sales emporium, however. “The main value for us to come here is to meet Latin producers and do project scouting,” said Andreas Rothbauer, at Germany’s Picture Tree Intl. “It’s very much an acquisitions market for us: we consistently find compelling Latin American projects to add to our slate,” concurred Gloria Bretones at Spain’s Begin Again Films. “There is always value in attending Ventana Sur or any other market, for us Ventana Sur particularly is our “home” market, where we meet all Latin producers, filmmakers and organizations…and also some international buyers,” added Alfredo Calvino at Brazil-based Habanero Sales. “It’s really valuable, We take large advantage of it. Such spaces are very valuable,” said Lucia Meik, at Argentina’s Meikincine.\n\n\tThe Deals\n\n\t*Mexico’s Tulip Pictures has launched outposts in Austin and Madrid, and bowed a teaser of director Lorena Villarreal’s dark comedy “Life Is.”\n\n\t*Cult Argentine toy line “Guerreros del Manana” has been acquired by New Zealand’s Black Mandala for an animated series adaptation. Deal was closed during Ventana Sur. \n\n\t*‘A Fantastic Woman’ star Daniela Vega has boarded Constanza Majluf’s ‘Pink Desert’ as executive producer as key cast confirmed as ‘The Wave’s’ Lola Bravo, Daniela Vega, ‘Cris Miró (Ella)’ Star Mina Serrano and ‘The Club’s’ Marcelo Alonso.\n\n\t*Argentina’s Del Toro Films is set to co-produce “I’ll Keep My Mouth Shut,” wit a high-profile Colombia cast led by Paula Castaño and Ángela Rodríguez. Colombia’s produces.\n\n\t*Romina Paula, star of Santiago Mitre’s debut “The Student” and director and subject of doc-fiction hybrid “Again, Once Again,” a San Sebastián Horizontes Latinos winner, is set to to star in “Michael M.,” the first solo feature of Laura Bierbrauer.\n\t\n\n\t*Guadalajara winning project ‘Dreadful Mother,’ a horror-thriller from Alicia Albares, has been picked up by Latido Films. \n\n\t*Woo Films, behind “The House of Flowers,” has boarded director Diego Ulloa’s ‘God’s Favorite Girl,’ from ‘This Is Not Sweden’ producer Funicular Films, a project at Ventana Sur’s Proyecta \n\n\t*U.K.-based Jinga Pictures has closed an 8-title deal with Encripta for all rights in Latin America on a mix of historical revenge saga, horror and action thrillers or comedy: “Sword Of Vengeance,” “The Last Assassins,”“Hellbilly Hollow,” “Scared To Death,” “The Haven,” action comedy “Peter Five Eight,” “A Game In The Woods” and the multi-prized “The House At The End Of Time.”\n\n\t*‘Looking for Michael,’ a Parkinson’s-themed comedy, was brought onto the market at Ventana Sur by Filmax.\n\n\t*Rafhael Barbosa’s Brazilian Afro-futurist animation ‘Utopia’ has added ‘Mars One’ star Rejane Faria and Matamba Joaquim as key voicecast.\n\n\t*Peru’s “Muerto de Risa,” a critical and box office hit in Peru shortlisted for the Platino Awards, has landed a Mexican Remake at Sin Sentido Films.\n\n\t*Argentina’s Gaman Cine and Fiørd Studio is teaming with Spain’s Lorolo on “The Other Voice,” revisiting Mercedes Sosa’s exile and a San Sebastián Film Festival Award winner at Ventana Sur.\n\n\t*Jinga has also received offers from distributors in North America and U.K. for Argentine horror “The Dollmaker”(“Encantador”) which it aims to close before the end of the year, said Jinga’s Julian Richards.\n\n\t*Diabla Cine and We Are Not Zombies have signed a co-production deal for “The Paradise” ahead of Ventana Sur Series.

    "body": "\n\tThe title of “Fackham Hall,” an “Airplane!”-style spoof of what used to be called the Merchant Ivory or “Masterpiece Theatre” genre (now it’s the “Downton Abbey” genre), sounds vaguely naughty, even if you can’t quite put your finger on why. That’s because the joke only comes alive when it’s pronounced with a Cockney accent, by one of the film’s lowly characters from the servant class. Then it comes out as “Fuck ’em all!” I would say that qualifies as half-funny, in addition to being pointedly juvenile and…well, half-funny is better than no funny at all. “Fackham Hall” is that kind of movie. I was primed to like it, because I’ve sat through this genre for decades, with its grand manners and well-worn “prestige” tropes, to the point that it’s become an ideal target for parody. The historical romantic costume drama is, by now, a cinematic china shop that demands a bull.\n\t\n\n\tThis one tosses some amusing spitballs. As we approach the front gate of Fackham Hall, a ridiculously oversize British country mansion in 1931, where the aristocratic Davenport family presides, we notice the inscription: “Incestus ad Infinitum.” That will prove to be one of the film’s wittier running gags — that everyone in this rarefied world marries their first or second cousin, because that’s the only way to keep the wealth in the family. At one point, the following courtly come-on is offered: “You are the most beautiful Davenport sister currently available.” And those sisters, radiant Rose (Thomasin McKenzie) and flaky Poppy (Emma Laird), have a job to do, which is to marry the right cousin, who will keep them living in the luxury of Fackham Hall.\n\t\n\n\tIn what plays like an homage to Spinal Tap’s drummers, the Davenport brothers have all died (their names, by the way, are John, Paul, George, and Ringo). And after Poppy runs out at the altar from her impending marriage to Archibald (Tom Felton), who is that perfectly unctuous, dull, but well-positioned family heir (in a real movie he’d be played by the young Jonathan Pryce), it’s up to Rose to marry him. But she only has eyes for Eric Noone (Ben Radcliffe), pronounced “Eric No One,” the dashing grown-up Cockney orphan who arrives at the estate to deliver a fateful letter and winds up staying on as an assistant.\n\n\t“Fackham Hall,” directed by Jim O’Hanlon from a grab-bag-of-jokes script by five writers (Steve Dawson, Andrew Dawson, Tim Inman, Jimmy Carr, and Patrick Carr,), is one of those parodies that does a scrupulous job of recreating the world it’s parodying. I generally think that makes a spoof funnier, but in this case the tone is so restrained that most of the jokes don’t fully detonate. They land, when they do at all, in the light chuckle zone.\n\n\tI chuckled at Damian Lewis, who plays it totally straight as Lord Fackham, a stuffed shirt with a twinkle of clueless entitlement in his eye, and I chuckled at Lady Davenport (Katherine Waterston) talking about how her daughter is a dried-up, over-the-hill spinster…because she’s all of 23. I chuckled at the hunting party that turns into a Dick Cheney debauch of friendly fire, and at Rose reading a novel entitled “One Shade of Gray.” And I chuckled at the presence, during a Fackham Hall party, of J.R.R. Tolkien (Jason Done), who keeps scribbling away at some obscure manuscript and getting names and phrases for it from whatever the folks around him are saying.\n\n\tBut here’s the odd thing about “Fackham Hall.” A number of the gag are rippingly obscene, the overarching impulse being to punch through the polite surface of the “Downton Abbey” genre with R-rated sex guffaws. But even these have a way of landing gently. If you watch “Airplane!” or the movie that’s the “Citizen Kane” of the ZAZ genre, “The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!” (and you really should, given that Variety just chose it, quite rightly, as the #1 comedy of all time), you’ll see that there’s a spirit of obstreperous aggression at work in those films. Nearly every joke lands with an anarchic bounce that you can trace all the way from vaudeville to the stoned ’70s.\n\t\n\n\tNot all great comedy is aggressive, but the ZAZ genre almost needs to be. Whereas “Fackham Hall,” even when it features a drawing-room performance of a song called “I Went to the Palace With My Willie Hanging Out!” (and then a digitally scrambled shot of the piano player’s willie), exerts the sort of harmless frivolity that last summer’s “Naked Gun” remake did. The movie, in its mud-on-the-doily way, is amusing enough to get by. But it never shocks you into laughter.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJane Fonda is speaking out against Netflix‘s earthshaking move to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, calling the $82.7 billion deal a “catastrophic” development that threatens to “destroy our creative industry.”\n\n\tFonda released her statement against the acquisition on Instagram through her Committee for the 1st Amendment organization. She wrote on Friday, “Today’s News that Warner Bros. Discovery has accepted a purchase bid is an alarming escalation of the consolidation that threatens the entire entertainment industry, the democratic public it serves and the First Amendment.”\n\t\n\n\tShe continued, “Make no mistake, this is not just a catastrophic business deal that could destroy our creative industry. It is a constitutional crisis exacerbated by the administration’s demonstrated disregard for the law.”\n\n\n\n\tDirecting her message to the powers that be, Fonda demanded the Justice Department and state regulators abstain from using their legal standing to “extract political concessions that influence content decisions or chill free speech.” In a sidebar to “Netflix and any company that becomes involved in this destructive deal,” Fonda wrote that it’s their “responsibility to defend our rights, not trade them away to pad your pockets. We know there will be enormous pressure to acquiesce, it is critical you stay strong.”\n\n\tHollywood at large has been mostly sour on the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal, with lawmakers, film producers and industry guilds alike all voicing concerns in the last week. Many expect the deal to cause seismic shifts in the entertainment industry, especially in the theatrical sector.\n\t\n\n\tAfter months of deliberation, Netflix acquired Warner Bros. Discovery on Friday, outbidding David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance and Comcast. The cash and stock transaction is valued at $27.75 per share, and the deal is expected to close within 12-18 months, according to Netflix and WBD.\n",

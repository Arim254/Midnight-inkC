    "body": "\n\tCary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, who played evil sorcerer Shang Tsung in the “Mortal Kombat” franchise and appeared in “The Last Emperor,” “Licence to Kill” and “The Man in the High Castle,” died Thursday in Santa Barbara. A rep confirmed he died of complications from a stroke. He was 75.\n\n\tTagawa’s first film role came in Bernardo Bertolucci’s “The Last Emperor.” Soon after that, Tagawa played the villian Kwang in James Bond movie “Licence to Kill.”\n\t\n\n\tOn TV, he had a recurring role on “Nash Bridges” and guest spots on dozens of series including “Miami Vice,” “Knots Landing,” “Moonlighting” and “Baywatch.”\n\n\n\tKagawa is known for his role as Shang Tsung in the “Mortal Kombat” franchise. He appeared in the first film adaptation in 1995 and went on to appear in the TV series “Mortal Kombat: Legacy” in 2013 and lent his voice to the more recent “Mortal Kombat 11” videogame.\n\n\tHis other film roles include “Rising Sun,” “Snow Falling on Cedars,” “Pearl Harbor,” “Planet of the Apes” and “Memoirs of a Geisha.”\n\n\tIn Amazon’s TV series “The Man in the High Castle,” Tagawa starred as Trade Minister Nobusuke Tagomi; in Netflix’s “Lost in Space,” he played Hiroki Watanabe.\n\n\tThough he often played villains, Tagawa told the Honolulu Advertiser in 2007 that the type-casting was inevitable at the time. “Guaranteed, I wouldn’t have gotten to play good guys if I hadn’t played those bad guys,” Tagawa said.\n\n\t“It’s something you take pride in, being not only the best Asian bad guy you can be, but the best of all bad guys. I wasn’t willing to do anything to get in, but I think I developed the ability to take what I was given and do the best job I could,” he said.\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Tokyo to an actress mother and Japanese American father who served in the military, Tagawa attended high school near Los Angeles, where he first started acting, and then attended USC. He began teaching his own style of martial arts called Chu Shin.\n\n\tHe is survived by his children Calen, Byrnne and Cana, and two grandchildren, River and Thea Clayton.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt the 7th Hainan Island International Film Festival in China, jury president Marco Müller urged audiences and industry to rethink the event’s place on the calendar, arguing that its slot between AFM and Berlin gives Hainan a unique chance to premiere the films that will define the coming year – not recap the one that’s ending.\n\n\tFestival jurors acknowledged the challenges facing a young festival in an already overcrowded global film schedule. Speaking at a press conference introducing the festival jury, Müller, jury president for HIIFF’s Golden Coconut Award, attempted to redefine the festival’s schedule, late in the year, as its greatest strategic asset.\n\t\n\n\tRather than presenting a summary of the current year’s films, Müller argued that the HIIFF could be a platform that introduces groundbreaking films for the year ahead.\n\n\n\t“The timing is particularly important,” Müller stated, noting the festival’s placement, sandwiched between AFM in November, and the Berlin Film Festival in February. “The Hainan Film Festival’s schedule happens to provide an opportunity to let young, media and film-obsessed audiences discover the newest films. That is, films that are coming out immediately next year.”\n\n\tThe sense of a festival still finding its footing between domestic focus and an international outlook was also evident in the responses of other jury members to questions ranging from China’s local box office to Asian-American representation in Hollywood.\n\n\tWhen asked about the latter, documentary juror and director Renee Tajima-Peña referenced the #OscarsSoWhite campaign and the push for greater AAPI representation in AMPAS.\n\t\n\n\t“We really had to fight to gain a place at the table,” said Tajima-Peña. “When I first started out, Asian Americans were really marginalized in Hollywood, the entertainment business and documentaries.”\n\n\t“Many of our stories are rooted here in China, and rooted in the Chinese diaspora story, and we are hungry to tell them.”\n\n\tThe press conference also threw up questions which gave insights into how China’s local media views the film industry at the moment. One question contended that the number of scripts entering production are decreasing, investment is becoming cautious, and distribution cycles are lengthening.\n\n\tIn response, veteran Chinese actor Guo Tao suggested that the answer lay in balancing personal artistic expression with commercial sensibilities.\n\n\t“The current film market needs more filmmakers to uphold the principle of ‘content is king,’ focusing on the story. This is crucial,” said Guo. “We have blockbuster films with high box office returns, while lacking artistic merit. The opposite is also true. We need to find a good balance between the two.”\n\n\tThe event also underscored the festival’s role in cultural diplomacy, with the 50th anniversary of China-Thailand diplomatic relations being celebrated with a series of Chinese-Thai events.\n\n\t“China and Thailand have always been ‘one family,'” said Thai director Banjong Pisanthanakun, referencing several Thai films that have resonated with Mainland Chinese audiences, like “How To Make Millions Before Grandma Dies.”\n\n\tWhile promotional posters for Hollywood juggernaut “Avatar: Fire and Ash” line every walkway at the festival grounds, Argentine director Mariano Llinás offered a gentle rebuff to the concept of the blockbuster film.\n\n\tLlinás urged filmmakers to work on smaller films, and championed a return to intimate productions, a model he has long practiced as a founder of the El Pampero Cine film collective, which prioritizes small films and a revolving repertory cast of friends and family. He advocated for a filmmaking model driven by camaraderie rather than established film industry structures.\n\n\t“It’s because it’s been made and thought by a small group of people, not by a big enterprise or studio, and that would be the secret for a personal approach to cinema,” said Llinás.\n\t\n\n\t“So I think the idea of making a picture made by friends is the answer. Try to make your pictures small and smaller and they would belong to you in a deeper way.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tFrom affairs to betrayals to a whole lot of drama, it’s been a tumultuous third season of  “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” to say the least. If you, too, are wondering where things stand between the women of MomTok following the explosive finale, you’re in luck: the Season 3 reunion will be available to stream exclusively on Hulu on Thursday, Dec. 4 starting at 9 p.m. PT.\n\n\tStassi Schroeder of “Vanderpump Rules” fame will host the event, which will reunite #MomTok and #DadTok “to explore the shocking scandals, uncover never-before-seen footage, and deck the halls with controversial guests,” per the official logline. Schroeder replaces Season 2 reunion host and “The Bachelor” alum Nick Viall. \n\n\n\tCast members Taylor Frankie Paul, Whitney Leavitt, Jen Affleck, Layla Taylor, Jessi Ngatikaura, Demi Engemann, Mikayla Matthews, Mayci Neeley and Miranda McWhoster, who joined the show in Season 2, will be in attendance. Wondering how to tune in? Here’s everything you need to know about streaming the special. \n\n\tSince “Mormon Wives” is currently exclusive to Hulu, you won’t be able to catch the reunion on cable. Instead, you’ll need access to a Hulu account. A standalone subscription to the streaming service (with ads) starts at $11.99, while a Hulu Premium subscription, which grants viewers a commercial free experience, starts at $18.99. Users can also purchase Hulu as part of a bundle plan with Disney+, ESPN or HBO Max, starting at $12.99.  Once you’re subscribed, you’ll be able to stream the reunion on demand.\n\n\tSince premiering in 2024 following the group’s viral swinging scandal, “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” has quickly become a fan favorite. While Season 3 data is yet to become available, the Season 2 premiere of the series hit five million views in its first five days of streaming on Hulu, according to Disney, while Season 1 was the streamer’s most watched unscripted series premiere of 2024.\n\n\n\tToday, the women of MomTok are busier than ever. Affleck and Leavitt just competed on Season 34 of “Dancing with the Stars,” while Paul is set to star as “The Bachelorette,” premiering March 22, 2026. Additionally, Leavitt recently announced that she’ll be stepping into the role of Roxie Hart in “Chicago,” making her Broadway debut in Feb. 2026.   \n\n\tThe reunion is expected to have “more drama than a high school Christmas pageant,” Schroeder said in the trailer. The eternal question remains: will MomTok survive this?\n",

    "body": "\n\tFilmmaker Matt Reeves added his voice to the wave of praise for Paul Dano — an outpouring that was prompted by Quentin Tarantino dissing Dano as “the weakest fucking actor in SAG.”\n\n\t“Paul Dano is an incredible actor, and an incredible person,” Reeves wrote on social media Thursday afternoon. The director worked with Dano on “The Batman,” in which the actor took on the role of the villainous Riddler and faced off against Robert Pattinson’s Caped Crusader.\n\t\n\n\tTarantino made his comments about Dano in an appearance on The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast, in which the filmmaker named his 20 favorite movies of the 21st century. But Tarantino upstaged his own taste a bit when discussing his fifth-place selection, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “There Will Be Blood,” arguing that the film would be his first or second pick “if it didn’t have a big, giant flaw in it… and the flaw is Paul Dano.”\n\n\n\t“He is weak sauce, man. He is the weak sister,” Tarantino continued. “He’s just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy. Daniel Day-Lewis shows that he doesn’t need a strong foil. The movie needs it. He doesn’t need anything. It’s supposed to be a two-hander and it’s not! … You put him with the the weakest fucking actor in SAG? The limpest dick in the world?”\n\n\tThe harsh take prompted others in the industry to voice their appreciation for Dano, including Reeves’ “The Batman” sequel screenwriter Mattson Tomlin: “I am really pleased to see so many people cheer on Paul Dano this week. Not only is he a terrific actor, but he’s an astonishing director who exudes control and tremendous empathy. Check out ‘Wildlife’ if you haven’t seen it.”\n\t\n\n\tBen Stiller also showed his appreciation, writing on social media that “Paul Dano is f-ing brilliant.” Alec Baldwin shared a video statement saying, “I love Paul Dano. And if you don’t love Paul Dano, shhhhhh.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tA consortium of top industry players have sent an open letter full of alarm to Congress, describing a potential economic and institutional meltdown ",
    "body": "\n\tA consortium of top industry players have sent an open letter full of alarm to Congress, describing a potential economic and institutional meltdown in Hollywood if Netflix succeeds in its effort to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\n\tThe letter was sent via email to members of Congress from both parties on Thursday, from an anonymous collective identifying themselves only as “concerned feature film producers.” The group explained it was leaving the letter unsigned “not out of cowardice” but fear of retaliation, given Netflix’s considerable power as a buyer and distributor. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment.\n\t\n\n\tOne well-placed source confirmed to Variety that the group includes a number of prominent filmmakers.\n\n\n\tThe communication outlines three areas of great concern, including that Netflix could stand to “destroy” the theatrical film marketplace by escalating or eliminating the amount of time Warner Bros. films would play in theaters before hitting a combined Netflix-HBO Max streaming platform. Sources told Variety earlier on Thursday that Netflix’s current proposal for Warner Bros. would have a theatrical window as thin as two weeks of exclusivity before moving to streaming. Another insider familiar with the deal process flatly denied this, saying the periods would be longer. Rival bidders Comcast and Paramount both have robust theatrical distribution outlets. Paramount has specifically pledged to keep Warner Bros. operating as a standalone business that will make a minimum of 14 films for theaters per year.\n\n\tThe producers argued that Netflix would “effectively hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace,” with what they assert would be enough market influence to reduce the footprint of theatrical movies and force down subsequent licensing fees paid in post-theatrical windows.\n\t\n\n\tThe letter to Congress also references the many times Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, has extolled that Netflix’s business model has nothing to do with movie theaters (including a quote from a 2023 earnings call, where Sarandos said, “Driving folks to a theater is just not our business”).\n\n\tThe note concludes by urging members of the House and Senate to speak out publicly against the acquisition and afford the potential deal “the highest level of antitrust scrutiny.” The stakes, the letter concludes, represent millions of jobs and a treasured art form.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has unveiled “Tygo,” an action thriller that will see Blackpink member Lalisa “Lisa” Manobal’s star alongside Korean action powerhouse Don Lee and “Squid Game” actor Lee Jin-uk.\n\n\tThe project is an expansion of Netflix’s “Extraction” franchise, bringing Korean filmmaking prowess to the streamer’s most successful action property. Big Punch Pictures, AGBO and TGIM are producing, with Nova Film Inc and B&C Group serving as co-producers.\n\t\n\n\tThe film is based on an original graphic novel created by Anthony and Joe Russo with Ande Parks. The producing team includes Don Lee for Big Punch Pictures; Anthony and Joe Russo, Angela Russo-Otstot, Michael Disco, and Albert J. Kim for AGBO; Won-ki Choi for Nova Film; and Chris S. Lee for B&C Group.\n\n\n\t“Tygo” follows Tygo (Don Lee), a former child soldier turned mercenary who launches a revenge mission through Korea’s criminal underworld after an operation goes awry. The film will be written by Cha Woo-jin and directed by Lee Sang-yong, who previously helmed “The Roundup” and “The Roundup: No Way Out.”\n\n\tLisa, who starred in “The White Lotus” Season 3, said: “I’m so honored to be a part of this project and grateful for the opportunity to work alongside such incredible actors. Being in an action movie has always been a dream of mine, so for my film debut to be such an exciting project feels very special.”\n\n\tDon Lee’s credits include “The Roundup” franchise and Marvel’s “Eternals.” “I’m thrilled that this project, which I’ve been developing for years with AGBO, is finally moving into production,” Lee said. “’Tygo’ brings a distinctly Korean identity into the global ‘Extraction’ universe. We can’t wait to unleash its explosive energy on audiences worldwide.”\n\t\n\n\tLee Jin-uk added: “As a fan of the ‘Extraction’ franchise, it’s a great honor for me to join this universe. I’m especially excited and grateful to be working with Don, whom I’ve always admired, and with Lisa as well.”\n\n\tAngela Russo-Otstot, producer and chief creative officer of AGBO, said: “We’re thrilled to explore the world of ‘Extraction’ through a South Korean lens, teaming up with legendary action star Don Lee and visionary director Lee Sang-yong, whose dynamic choreography exemplifies the world-class craft of Korean cinema. Together, we proudly welcome Lisa, a truly multitalented global phenomenon, and Lee Jin-uk, one of Korea’s most charismatic and versatile actors, to lead our cast alongside Don.”\n\n\tThe “Extraction” franchise has proven remarkably successful for Netflix, with 90 million households watching the first film within its initial four weeks. The second installment remained at No. 1 on Netflix’s Global Top 10 Movies list for seven weeks, accumulating over 123 million views.\n",

    "body": "\n\tClint Bentley’s “Train Dreams” follows the Joel Edgerton as Robert Grainier, a logger and railroad worker living in the Pacific NorthWest.\n\n\tSet in the late 1960s, “Train Dreams” is directed by “Sing Sing” co-writer Clint Bentley who called on Adolpho Veloso to be the film’s cinematographer.\n\n\tThe images are lush. The tall green trees pop against the clear blue sky, until a wildfire ravages the forest and changes Grainger’s life. Suddenly, the palette is ash and grey reflecting the aftermath.\n\t\n\n\tVeloso’s imagery is one that lingers long after the film credits have rolled. In one scene, it’s a grand moment, as the tall trees get sawed down all in the name of progress.\n\n\tVeloso sat down with Variety for Inside the Frame and said, “For 99% of the movie, we used natural light.”\n\n\tWith Bentley shooting in real-life locations, the idea was to simulate the audience looking through memories and putting a life together where those the images were being shown. In this case, those memories belong to Edgerton’s character, Robert.\n\n\tFor research, Veloso looked through a lot of old pictures from the era and even as far back as 1920. As he was going through them, it dawned on him that they looked like the 3:20 aspect ratio. Says Veloso, “We just kept going back to this memory feeling. We were like, ‘Why we just don’t use that aspect ratio?’”\n\n\tOnce they had that, Veloso knew this would be an intimate film, and also tried to capture the beauty of the natural setting. To properly film in natural light and capture the beauty of the landscape, Veloso says, “We knew we needed a smaller camera and because of the natural light…we just decided to go with the Alexa 35 to have a lot of dynamic range.”\n\t\n\n\tSimilarly, for the scenes at night, natural was key, so he used real fire and candles to light those. He says, “We wanted to keep it that way to feel a bit more grounded.”\n\n\tThe lush imagery in the film was captured using Kowa Spherical lenses. At night, he switched to Zeiss Super Speeds lenses.\n\n\tAfter the forest fire devastates much of the landscape, and Grainger’s home, the earthy tones disappear with very little pops of green. That was all natural, Veloso says.\n\n\tWatch the video above.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWho knew the end of the world could be so life-affirming? And who would have guessed that a Stephen King short story adapted by fellow Master of Horror Mike Flanagan would result in the feel-good movie of the year?\n\n\tThe challenge with talking about “The Life of Chuck” is that it’s a film that should be discovered — the less you know going in, the better. Which made it challenging to market. Is it a drama? A musical? A romance? A coming-of-age story? A movie that does nothing less than ask about the meaning of life? Well, yes.\n\t\n\n\tThe film is broken into three acts, told in reverse chronology. The first act finds the world crumbling due to an unspecified apocalyptic event. The internet is down, there’s no television — and yet mysterious billboards and commercials thanking someone named Charles “Chuck” Krantz begin popping up everywhere. In the second act, we meet a grown Chuck (played by Tom Hiddleston) on a pivotal day in his life. The third act details Chuck’s childhood, where he’s raised by his grandfather Albie (Mark Hamill, never better). All questions about Chuck will be answered as the story examines big questions about the universe through the life of one ordinary man. \n\n\n\tIt’s an act of courage to be earnest and optimistic in a world where audiences aren’t accustomed to sincerity. “We live in a cynical world and we work in a cynical industry,” says Flanagan. “We’re kind of instructed to be cynical, to be on guard and not to lead with our emotions, because that’s vulnerable.” To that end, Flanagan and company knew their film wouldn’t appeal to everyone. \n\t\n\n\tBut people have responded — the film was the winner of the coveted Audience Award at last year’s Toronto International Film Festival. Hamill’s wife is also a fan. “She never hesitates to say: ‘This is my favorite thing he’s ever done,’” the actor reveals. And perhaps the greatest endorsement came from King himself, who the filmmaker says told him: “I don’t know how it will play for everyone, but this works for me because its heart is on its sleeve.”\n\n\tHuge credit is due to the outstanding ensemble — in addition to Hamill and Hiddleston, Flanagan regulars like Jacob Tremblay, Kate Siegel and Annalise Basso make appearances, proving the old adage that there’s no such thing as a small role. Karen Gillan (also a return player) and Chiwetel Ejiofor play a divorced couple in one of the most romantic scenes of the year. And Nick Offerman gives one of the best performances of the year simply by lending his voice to the Narrator. But it’s Benjamin Pajak as 11-year-old Chuck and Hamill who provide the heart and soul of the film. Flanagan is known for his gorgeous dialogue, and it may sound like a joke, but Hamill articulates a monologue to Pajak about the importance of math that sounds like poetry.\n\n\tIt’s a stunning achievement, especially considering King himself never thought it would happen. Asked why Flanagan is such a good interpreter of his work, he declared the director to be fearless. “I never would have believed, out of all the stories I’ve ever written, that ‘The Life of Chuck’ would ever be a movie,” King notes. How happy he was to be proven wrong.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBilly Porter has joined the Oscar-qualified documentary short, “Freeman Vines,” as an executive producer.\n\n\tDirectors André Robert Lee and Tim Kirkman’s film is a haunting portrait of 82-year-old Freeman Vines, a sculptor and guitar-maker in rural Fountain, N.C., who carves some of his instruments from lumber taken from a tree used in the lynching of a young Black man named Oliver Moore. As Vines faces multiple myeloma and diabetes late in life, the film captures his philosophy, humor and unflinching confrontation with the legacy of racism in the American South. \n\t\n\n\t“Freeman Vines was a fierce, extraordinary human, and this expression of his story is simply gorgeous,” Porter said in a statement Thursday. “The life of an artist can be a hard road, and Freeman navigated a complicated community and history, but he discovered what it meant to live in truth with a freedom he claimed for himself. We should all be so lucky. ‘Freeman Vines,’ directed by André Robert Lee and Tim Kirkman, offers a profound lesson about human connection, resilience and creativity. I am honored to be part of this project, and I hope audiences will truly witness it.”\n\n\n\tThe film took home top honors at multiple Academy-qualifying festivals, including best documentary short at the Tallahassee Film Festival and screened at Tribeca, RiverRun and Florida Film Festivals, as well as selections at Woodstock, Nantucket, Indy Shorts, SCAD Savannah, and other leading showcases.\n\n\tEarlier this fall, the film was acquired by Switchboard Magazine and is currently available to screen via their YouTube Channel. \n\t\n\n\tIn addition to Porter’s company Incognegro, producer Gill Holland’s company The Group Entertainment presents the film in association with Lee’s Many Things Productions, Kirkman’s T42 Entertainment and Music Maker Foundation.\n\n\t“Billy Porter is an American icon in the arts, and it is an honor to partner with him on ‘Freeman Vines,'” Lee and Kirkman said. “We are excited to have Billy’s extraordinary talent and voice on this journey to help bring Freeman’s life story and life’s work to an even greater audience.” \n\n\tSwitchboard founder and editor in chief Celia Aniskovich said, “’Freeman Vines’ story sits at the intersection of music, art, race and spiritual inquiry — the exact kind of layered, character-driven storytelling Switchboard was built to support. As we bring together four Oscar-qualified shorts for a collective awards campaign, ‘Freeman Vines’ is a soul-stirring cornerstone of that slate. We’re thrilled to welcome Billy Porter to the team as we introduce this film to wider audiences.”\n\n\t“Freeman Vines” is one of four Oscar-qualified shorts — alongside “Poreless,” “Rat Rod” and “Saving Superman” — being championed in Switchboard’s collective awards campaign this season.  \n\n",

    "body": "\n\tRatings for the Kennedy Center Honors took a sharp decline this year. The poor turnout comes shortly after Donald Trump added his name to the historic forum.\n\n\tThis year’s Kennedy Center Honors, hosted by Trump, averaged 3.01 million viewers, according to a report from Nielsen Live + Same Day Panel + Big Data. That represents a 25% dip from last year’s numbers. The 2024 show hit a record low of 4.1 million viewers after reaching 4.5 million viewers the year before.\n\t\n\n\tThe Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to Variety’s request for comment.\n\n\n\tTrump is the first sitting president to host the Kennedy Center Honors, which celebrate “individuals whose unique contributions have shaped our world,” according to the organization’s website. This year’s honorees were George Strait, Sylvester Stallone, KISS, Michael Crawford and Gloria Gaynor.\n\n\tOn Dec. 6, the day before the event, Trump told reporters at the White House, “It’s going to be something that I believe, and I’m going to make a prediction: This will be the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done and they’ve gotten some pretty good ratings, but there’s nothing like what’s going to happen tomorrow night.”\n\n\tTrump has set his sights on remaking the Kennedy Center in his image during his second term, even going so far as to rename the venue “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts” in mid December. The name change has been met with significant blowback, and several scheduled acts have canceled their upcoming performances as a result.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCanal+ and Warner Bros. Discovery have signed a new multi-year, multi-territory agreement to strengthen their partnership internationally, including the expansion of HBO Max to two more countries.\n\n\tThrough the pact, which a press release calls a “major milestone” in the companies’ collaboration, distribution of HBO Max via Canal+ will be renewed in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania, and will expand to Belgium and Austria. Distribution of Cartoon Network, Cartoonito and CNN International in Romania, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia will also be renewed, as will Warner TV in the Czech Republic.\n\t\n\n\tAcross MultiChoice Group territories in Africa, distribution of 12 WBD thematic channels will be renewed, including CNN International and Cartoon Network, Cartoon Network Porto, Cartoonito, Cartoonito Porto, Discovery Channel, Discovery Family, Real Time, ID, TLC, HGTV, Travel, TNT Africa and Food Network.\n\n\n\tThe agreement between WBD and the French media group builds upon previous deals made in 2024, including the renewal of the exclusive pay-TV window for Warner Bros. Pictures films six months after their theatrical release in France and the integration of HBO Max within select Canal+ group offers. \n\n\tIt also comes during Netflix’s pending purchase of WBD, which could further position Canal+ as a power player on the global stage as the company already has distribution deals in place with Netflix. On Dec. 16, Netflix boss Ted Sarandos made a surprise appearance at Canal+ Group’s Paris showcase and reassured the audience of his plans in purchasing WBD.\n\t\n\n\t“Our intentions when we buy Warner Bros. will be to continue to release Warner Bros. studio movies in theaters with the traditional windows,” Sarandos said during a conversation with Canal+ chair and CEO Maxime Saada. “Then those movies would flow through the Canal+ output deal. That’s very exciting for us.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Trump stirred up controversy after taking to Truth Social to share takedowns of the Kennedy family, mere hours after the tragic death of JFK’s granddaughter Tatiana Schlossberg at 35 years old. Schlossberg, a former climate and energy reporter at the New York Times, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia after her daughter was born in 2024. \n\n\tOne message that Trump re-posted read: “The Trumps have always been supporters of the arts. The Kennedys are supporters of the Kennedys.” \n\t\n\n\tAnother noted: “They don’t raise money for it. They never show up. And the only Kennedy who has been there recently is a member of Trump’s cabinet.”\n\n\tTrump’s post were not in reference to Schlossberg’s death but to the drama surrounding his continued takeover of the Kennedy Center. He renamed the venue “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts” in mid December to much controversy and blowback from various members of the Kennedy family. His takeover has resulted in several scheduled acts canceling their upcoming performances.\n\n\tEven if Trump wasn’t addressing Schlossberg, many on social media found his timing tasteless and cruel as the Kennedy family mourns the loss of one of their own. CNN’s Jake Tapper called out Trump’s behavior on X, sharing screenshots of the president’s Kennedy bashing and writing; “In the early afternoon, ET, the Kennedy family announced that JFK’s granddaughter Tatiana Schlossberg had died from cancer. A few hours later, President Trump re-posted some social media garbage attacking the Kennedy family.”\n\t\n\n\tIt’s not the first time this month Trump has made headlines for attacking a grieving family. The president earned widespread backlash for attacking Rob Reiner after the director’s death in early December. Trump alleged that Reiner’s death was “due to the anger he caused others” from being outspokenly anti-Trump. Reiner’s son, Nick, has been arrested in connection to his parents’ deaths. Trump later called the filmmaker a “deranged person” who “was very bad for our country.”\n\n\t“The Rob Reiner thing is not funny,” Joe Rogan recently said in opposition to Trump’s behavior. “When you see it with no empathy, that’s when it’s hard to like. Listen, there’s no justification for what he did that makes any sense in a compassionate society. It’s no different than people that were celebrating when Charlie Kirk got shot. It’s the same kind of thing…  It’s so disappointing. It’s like why… if you say that privately that’s one thing, which is also crazy, but it’s so disappointing.”\n\nIn the early afternoon, ET, the Kennedy family announced that JFK’s granddaughter Tatiana Schlossberg had died from cancer.

    "body": "\n\tThe board of Warner Bros. Discovery is poised to reject the amended takeover offer fielded by Paramount Skydance last week as David Ellison keeps up his pursuit of the assets he sees as crucial to building a 21st century Hollywood heavyweight.\n\n\tBloomberg News reported Tuesday that the WBD board was expected to reject the amended offer that was made with fanfare by Paramount Skydance on Dec. 22. WBD has already struck an agreement to merge with Netflix in a deal valued at more than $80 billion. \n\t\n\n\tBut Paramount Skydance hasn’t given up and is making a tender offer to WBD shareholders. As this tug-of-war has played out in press releases and conference calls and Securities and Exchange Commission filings, WBD shares have soared more than 170% this year, albeit shares were at a low ebb, having traded under $10 for most of 2024. Bloomberg reported the WBD board will meet next week to formally vote on a response to Paramount’s latest offer. A WBD representative declined to comment on matter.\n\n\n\tThe WBD board’s expected decision is not a surprise given there have been no signs of a significant about-face in the panel’s thinking about which company is the best fit for Warner Bros. and HBO Max. There is also much industry intrigue about how far Paramount is willing to go, if at all, in raising the financial value of its bid higher than the existing $30 a share. \n\n\tParamount’s amended offer from last week largely dealt with the financing of the all-cash transaction. Software billionaire Larry Ellison, who is the father of David Ellison, took steps to address the WBD’s stated concerns about the sources of Paramount’s financing. Larry Ellison enlarged his personal stake in the transaction by making an “irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion” toward Paramount’s $108 billion all-cash offer for all of WBD. That includes CNN, TNT and a handful of other established linear cable channels that are now on track to be spunoff into a separate company next year.\n\t\n\n\tParamount’s amended offer of Dec. 22 also upped the breakup fee to match Netflix’s $5.8 billion figure, payable to WBD in the event that its deal does not clear regulatory review. Netflix’s deal is valued at just under $83 billion but does not include the linear cable channels. Netflix’s deal is a mix of cash and stock.\n\n\tIf the expected WBD board rejection spurs Paramount to raise its offer, then the ball moves to Netflix’s court. It’s unclear what, if any, willingness Netflix has to raise its hand.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMeyer Gottlieb, who headed Samuel Goldwyn Films and produced films including “Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,” died Monday in Los Angeles. He was 86. \n\n\tTom Rothman, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, said in a statement, “Meyer was a gentleman of the old school. I was fortunate to work for him when he ran the Samuel Goldwyn Company, in the heyday of independent film. I learned an enormous amount from him — most importantly, that it is possible to make a life in Hollywood without sacrificing integrity and honesty, both of which he embodied entirely, along with smarts, wisdom, and kindness. I send my sincere condolences to his loving family during this difficult time.”\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Poland just before the Germans invaded, Gottlieb was a Holocaust survivor who lived in Ukraine labor camps during the war and then in a displaced person’s camp in Germany. After a great aunt brought him to Los Angeles, he learned English at school and eventually graduated from UCLA. \n\n\n\tHe became president and COO of the Samuel Goldwyn Co. in 1988 after helped Samuel Goldwyn Jr. revive the company in 1978 with classic films from Goldwyn’s father’s library. \n\n\tAmong the other films he produced for Goldwyn were “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” remake, starring Ben Stiller. As a top Goldwyn executive, he shepherded releases including the received Michael Apted film “Amazing Grace,” “Mystic Pizza,” “Eat, Drink, Man, Woman,” “Super Size Me” and “The Squid and the Whale.”\n\n\tHe is survived by his wife Pattikay, two daughters and two grandchildren.\n",

GOD BLESS.”\n\n\tWhitlock played small roles in several of Lee’s films, including “Red Hook Summer,” “Chi-Raq,” “She Hate Me” and “25th Hour.” His two major roles in Lee’s filmography came with “Da Five Bloods,” in which he plays Vietnam veteran Melvin alongside Delroy Lindo, Jonathan Majors, Clarke Peters and Norm Lewis, and “BlackKkKlansman,” in which he starred as police officer Mr. Turrentine alongside Alec Baldwin, John David Washington and Robert John Burke.\n\t\n\n\tBrian Liebman, Whitlock’s manager, shared the news of his death in an Instagram post. He wrote, “It is with tremendous sadness that I share the passing of my dear friend and client Isiah Whitlock Jr. If you knew him — you loved him. A brilliant actor and even better person. May his memory forever be a blessing. Our hearts are so broken. He will be very, very missed.”\n\n\tWhitlock was best known for playing the crooked state senator Clay Davis on “The Wire.” He also appeared in a recurring role on Seasons 2 through 4 of “Veep” as U.S. Secretary of Defense George Maddox, who runs against Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ character Selina Meyer in the 2016 primaries.\n\n\tThe Indiana-born character actor also had small roles in “Goodfellas,” “Chappelle’s Show,” “Pieces of April,” “Enchanted,” “Cars 3” and “Lightyear.” His voice can be heard in Pixar’s “Hoppers,” which is set to debut in 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe team behind Yash‘s highly anticipated “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” has revealed the first look at Nayanthara as Ganga, presenting the actress in a role that combines visual intensity with a commanding presence.\n\n\tThe poster positions Nayanthara in front of an ornate casino entrance, weapon in hand, projecting controlled power within a high-stakes luxury environment. The image marks a departure for the actor, suggesting a character defined by calculated authority rather than conventional heroism.\n\t\n\n\tNayanthara has established herself as one of India’s most acclaimed actor over a two-decade career spanning more than 75 films across Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada-language cinema. Her filmography includes women-centric successes like “Aramm,” “Kolamaavu Kokila” and “Netrikann,” alongside Shah Rukh Khan’s blockbuster “Jawan.”\n\n\n\tYash, the Kannada-language film industry actor who rose to pan-Indian stardom with the “K.G.F” franchise, has become one of the most sought-after stars in Indian cinema. Known for his portrayal of Rocky Bhai in “K.G.F: Chapter 1” (2018) and “K.G.F: Chapter 2” (2022) Yash’s transformation into a larger-than-life action hero propelled the films to unprecedented box-office success, breaking language barriers. The second instalment in the franchise is the fifth highest Indian grosser of all time. While the “K.G.F” series cemented his star power, Yash’s early career in Kannada-language films showcased his versatility, with notable performances in projects such as “Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari” (2014) and “Googly” (2013).\n\t\n\n\t“Toxic” is helmed by festival circuit darling Geetu Mohandas (“Moothon”). The ambitious project represents a watershed moment for Kannada cinema, which has been steadily gaining international traction following the “K.G.F” phenomenon. Written by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic” is breaking new ground as the first major Indian film conceptualized, written and shot simultaneously in both the Kannada and English languages – with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\n\t“We all know Nayan as a celebrated star with a commanding screen presence, and a remarkable career spanning two decades but in ‘Toxic,’ audiences will witness a talent that had been quietly waiting to explode,” said director Geetu Mohandas. “I wanted to portray Nayan in a way that she’s never been showcased before. But as the shoot progressed I began to see how closely her own personality echoed the soul of the character. It wasn’t imitation, it was alignment. The depth, the honesty, the restraint, and the emotional clarity she brought were not performances layered on top of the character, they were qualities she already possessed. I found my Ganga, so brilliantly performed by her, and even more unexpectedly, I found a dear friend.”\n\n\tThe reveal follows previous character unveilings for the production, including Kiara Advani as Nadia and Huma Qureshi as Elizabeth, each presenting distinct visual aesthetics within the film’s narrative world.\n\n\tThe production has assembled a notable technical crew including Indian National Film Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer T.P. Abid. Action sequences have been choreographed by Hollywood’s J.J. Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside Indian National Film Award-winning duo Anbariv and Kecha Khamphakdee.\n\n\tProduced by Venkat K. Narayana and Yash through KVN Productions and Monster Mind Creations, “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” is scheduled for theatrical release March 19, 2026, capitalizing on the extended holiday weekend that encompasses Eid, Ugadi and Gudi Padwa celebrations.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter George Clooney said he felt that newly-named editor-in-chief Bari Weiss was “dismantling CBS News as we speak,” Weiss has responded by inviting him to visit the CBS newsroom. \n\n\t“Bonjour, Mr. Clooney! Big fan of your work. It sounds like you’d like to learn more about ours. This is an open invitation to visit The CBS Broadcast Center, where I’m spending the holidays working to relaunch the Evening News with my colleagues. Tune in January 5,” Weiss said in a statement shared by Paramount Skydance. The “bonjour” was presumably a reference to Clooney, his wife Amal and their twins becoming French citizens this week.\n\t\n\n\tIn a wide-ranging interview with Brent Lang about his career and his latest film “Jay Kelly,” Clooney also touched on the upheaval at CBS News, politics and his activism.\n\n\n\t“Am I worried about film studios? Sure. It’s my business, but my primary loyalty is to my country. I’m much more worried about how we inform ourselves and how we’re going to discern reality without a functioning press,” he said. \n\n\tClooney also addressed President Trump’s lawsuits against ABC News and CBS News in Variety‘s interview. “If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go fuck yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,” Clooney says. “That’s simply the truth.”\n\n\tWeiss, who took over CBS News in October, recently came under fire for abruptly pulling a “60 Minutes” report on El Salvador’s CECOT prison.\n\n\tThe response from Weiss was first reported by the New York Post.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA new study describes 2025 as a “Great Recession” for women directors, with just nine women directors attached to the 100 top-grossing films at the U.S. box office.\n\n\tAccording to the latest report from the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, of the 111 directors who helmed those films, nine of them were women: Nisha Ganatra (“Freakier Friday”), Emma Tammi (“Five Nights at Freddy’s 2”), Domee Shi (“Elio”), Madeline Sharafian (“Elio”), Celine Song (“Materialists”), Jennifer Kaytin Robinson (“I Know What You Did Last Summer”), Maggie Kang (“KPop Demon Hunters”), Hikari (“Rental Family”) and previous best director Oscar winner Chloé Zhao (“Hamnet”).\n\t\n\n\tThe 2025 figure (8.1 %, which calculates a ratio of 11.3 men to every one woman) represents a steep drop from 2024, when the percentage of women directors on the 100 top-grossing films was 13.4% (15 directors), when the U.S. was in the throes of the financial Great Recession.\n\n\n\t“The 2025 data reveals that progress for women directors has been fleeting,” stated Dr. Stacy L. Smith, the study’s author and founder of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. “While it is tempting to think that these changes are a result of who is in the Oval Office, in reality, these results are driven by executive decision-making that took place long before any DEI prohibitions took effect. Many of these films were greenlit and in pre-production before the 2024 election.”\n\n\tThe study, titled “Inclusion in the Director’s Chair” and now in its seventh iteration, examines the gender and race/ethnicity of directors across 2025’s 100 top-grossing films, as well as analyzes trends including hiring patterns by distributor and the average and median Metacritic scores by director gender and race/ethnicity. The report surveys a total of 1,900 films released between 2007 and 2025.\n\t\n\n\tOf the 111 directors in 2024, only three of the women (Song, Zhao and Tammi) have previously helmed a film in the sample. Just 24 women have directed more than one top-grossing film between 2007 and 2025. Top-performing women directors were Anne Fletcher (four films), Lana Wachowski (four films) and Greta Gerwig (three films), while 21 women helmed two movies.\n\n\tLess than a quarter (24.3%) of directors in 2025 were from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups in 2025. This figure is unchanged from 2024 (24.1%) and significantly higher than the 12.5% reported in 2007.\n\n\tAt the intersection of race and gender, only 5.4% of directors this year were women of color, but 2025 marks the first year where the number of women of color (six) outnumbered the number of white women (three). Furthermore, all of the women of color directors this year were Asian (Ganatra, Shi, Song, Kang, Hikari and Zhao); none were Black, Hispanic/Latina, Native American, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander or Middle Eastern/North African. Overall, women of color still represent just 1.9% of all top-grossing movie directors across 19 years, despite the fact that their films earned the highest average and media scores compared to white male directors, white women and men of color.\n\n\t“It is clear that when it comes to directors, hiring decisions are not made solely on the basis of performance,” said Dr. Smith. “If that were the case, then women of color would receive significantly more opportunities to work behind the camera in film. These results demonstrate that the quality of movies by women of color is not only overlooked, it is actively ignored.”\n\n\tBy distributor, Universal Pictures (9.4%) and Walt Disney Studios (8%) lead the way in terms of hiring women directors over the study’s 19-year span; meanwhile, Paramount (2%), Lionsgate (4.3%) and 20th Century (4.6%) hired the lowest percentage of women. In 2025, Walt Disney Studios attached three women directors to top-grossing films while Universal Pictures and “other” distributors attached two. Paramount, Warner Bros. and Lionsgate did not have a woman director across their top films this year.\n\n\tThe report contrasts these results by indicating significantly higher percentages of women directing films in the U.S. dramatic competition at Sundance Film Festival (63.6% for 2026), directing television episodes (37% in the 2023-2024 season) and helming Netflix movies (20.5% in 2024).\n\t\n\n\tRead the full study on the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative’s website.\n\n\t[Pictured: Chloè Zhao directs on the set of “Hamnet” and Celine Song directs on the set of “Materialists.”]\n",

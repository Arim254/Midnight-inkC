    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/maigret/\">Maigret</a>,” the latest TV adaptation of Georges Simenon’s detective novels, has landed a raft of international sales deals for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/banijay/\">Banijay</a> Rights, the global distribution arm of TV giant Banijay Entertainment. </p>\n<p>\n\tAhead of Mipcom in Cannes and the show’s premiere on Masterpiece Mystery! on PBS in the U.S. on Oct. 5, the six-part series has sold to ABC in Australia, plus Wowow in Japan, Sky Free in New Zealand, VRT in Belgium, HRT in Croatia, and SIA Tet in Latvia.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe new series reframes Parisian Chief Inspector Jules Maigret as an unconventional young detective with something to prove and features <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/benjamin-wainwright/\">Benjamin Wainwright</a> (“Belgravia: The Next Chapter,” “Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim”) in the lead role and Stefanie Martini (“The Gold,” “Last Kingdom,” “Emerald City”) as Madame Louise Maigret.

We set out to create a series that embraces the legacy of the novels while introducing the character to a new, global audience and we’re incredibly grateful to our partners at Masterpiece and Banijay Rights.”</p>\n<p>\n\tColin Callender and Stern executive produce “Maigret” for Playground with Patrick Harbinson (“Homeland,” “24, The Tower”) serving as lead writer, executive producer on behalf of Windhover Films, and director of the first two episodes of the series with Faye Gilbert (“The Tower,” “The Bay”) directing episodes 3 and 4 and David Evans (“Domina,” “Django”) directing 5 and 6.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe Queer Muslim Project has unveiled its newest class of fellows for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/queerframes/\">QueerFrames</a> Screenwriting Lab, a program dedicated to supporting emerging queer and trans filmmakers from South Asian backgrounds.</p>\n<p>\n\tEight filmmakers have been selected for the 2025 cohort from India and Canada: Ritwik Goswami, Simrat Harvind Kaur, Saniya Jaffar, Rit Prasanna, Reshmi Mohan, Talat Shakeel, Marushka Jessica Almeida, and Sania Khan. All are women, trans, or nonbinary creators developing feature films that place LGBTQ+ narratives at the center rather than the margins.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNow in its third year, QueerFrames was established in 2023 as part of The Queer Muslim Project’s broader mission. The platform has grown into South Asia’s largest digital network for queer voices, reaching more than 70,000 people globally. The lab has worked with 14 filmmakers since launching.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe program brings together prominent industry figures as mentors, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rohan-parashuram-kanawade/\">Rohan Parashuram Kanawade</a>, whose film “Cactus Pears” (Sabar Bonda) won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/tricia-tuttle/\">Tricia Tuttle</a>, director of the Berlin Film Festival; Indian filmmakers <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/vikramaditya-motwane/\">Vikramaditya Motwane</a> (“Sacred Games”), Shonali Bose (“Margarita with a Straw”); and Nepalese filmmaker Min Bahadur Bham (“Shambhala”). Previous instructors Vishnu Sinha from Columbia University and Berlinale Talents alumna Paromita Dhar are returning.</p>\n<p>\n\tNetflix and the French Institute in India are backing this year’s program, which kicks off with a retreat in Goa from Oct. 3-12, followed by six months of virtual workshops and continued development assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\t“These filmmakers are rewriting what queer and trans South Asian cinema can look like,” said Rafiul Alom Rahman, who founded both The Queer Muslim Project and QueerFrames. “They are telling stories unapologetically rooted in culture and community, while pushing artistic and political boundaries.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tKanawade added: “As someone whose filmmaking is deeply rooted in lived experience, I know how vital it is to have spaces like QueerFrames that affirm and empower queer and trans storytellers to achieve authentic representation. This Lab is not just about developing scripts – it’s about cultivating a culture where underrepresented stories can thrive with honesty, dignity, and power.”</p>\n<p>\n\tTuttle said: “QueerFrames is cultivating filmmakers whose stories are deeply rooted in South Asia yet speak to audiences everywhere. These are films that will challenge, move, and expand how we think about queer and trans lives on screen. I can’t wait to see them travel the world.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe selected films span multiple genres and themes. Simrat Harvind Kaur’s “Beeji da kangha (Grandmother’s Comb)” follows a Sikh teenager questioning gender identity. Ritwik Goswami’s “Swarnapuchhri” combines environmental concerns with a queer romance in a coastal community threatened by industrial development. Saniya Jaffer’s “Kacchi Kallis” explores shifting teenage friendships during a vacation in Goa.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tThe projects also include a horror-comedy from Canadian filmmaker Marushka Jessica Almeida titled “Stacy’s Mom”; Rit Prasanna’s campus romance “Even In Rubble”; Canadian filmmaker Sania Khan’s coming-of-age story “On Thursday Morning, The Moon Dances” about a Pakistani-Canadian dancer; Reshmi Mohan’s relationship drama “Love, Yours” set against caste violence; and Talat Shakeel’s “Kooker Ki Seeti” about a young Muslim woman discovering her sexuality.</p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe International <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/classic-film-market/\">Classic Film Market</a> (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mifc/\">MIFC</a>), the world’s only market dedicated to restoring and promoting heritage films, returns to Lyon alongside the Lumière Film Festival for its 13th edition expected to draw a record number of participants.</p>\n<p>\n\t“All our indicators are up, both in terms of newcomers and international participants,” co-head Anaïs Desrieux told <em>Variety</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tThree high-profile guests of honor underscore the festival’s global reach: Andrea Kalas, VP of Media and Archival Services at Iron Mountain, Justine Ryst, YouTube’s France chief, and Gaëtan Bruel, the new head of the France’s film board CNC.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother sign of the market’s growing industry pull comes from U.K.-based Park Circus, which joins this year as an official partner. The company handles global distribution of heritage titles for major U.S. studios as well as British and European libraries. CEO Douglas Davis will join Studiocanal’s Pauline Saint-Hilaire and Mk2 Films’ Benoit Claro for a roundtable on building international distribution strategies for heritage film.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTechnology remains a hot topic, notably the use of AI in classic film preservation and restoration, with a focus this year on subtitling and dubbing. The debate will bring together heritage film conservation outfit Vectracom, Phont, a start-up specialised in so-called “emotional subtitling,” and translators’ representatives.</p>\n<p>\n\t“No one at the table is opposed to progress, but the real challenge is to ensure that this innovation truly qualifies as such for the whole ecosystem,” said Desrieux. Co-head Gérald Duchaussoy added “subtitles are not neutral – subtitling is a creative activity that shapes how films are understood.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNew tools will be on display at the Classics Innovation Corner, where startups such as Phont, AI-powered search and licensing platform Refractio, and distributor-oriented CN Films will present their tech.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother key theme is the growing role of streaming services in the circulation of heritage cinema, which Ryst is sure to address as she spotlights YouTube’s 20th anniversary.</p>\n<p>\n\t“There is a great heritage offer on YouTube, with access to films, archives and programs dedicated to classic films, and content creators engaging whole new audiences,” said Duchaussoy.</p>\n<p>\n\tCase studies will feature Sooner – the new merger of French streamers Universciné and Filmo –, heritage film platform LaCinetek, and entertainment site Allociné, which is launching a dedicated service, Allociné Classique. “Thanks to these platforms, the films are not just being preserved, they are being reintroduced to audiences in the digital era,” Desrieux noted. </p>\n<p>\n\tFrom digital strategies to face-to-face deal-making, circulation remains a priority for organizers, with initiatives like the popular Re>Birth program, now in its third edition. The showcase pitches either recently restored titles carrying the Lumière Classics label or works seeking restoration partners for 10-minute sessions followed by one-to-one meetings aimed at sparking deals.</p>\n<p>\n\tHungary provides an inspiring example as country of honor thanks to its strong track-record in preservation and circulation through events such as the Budapest Classic Film Marathon. MIFC regular György Ráduly, head of the Hungarian National Film Archive, will be among the guests.  </p>\n<p>\n\tOther highlights include debates on the new AgoraEU program, Europe’s audiovisual heritage policy, and the power of curated retrospectives, with this year’s tributes to Martin Ritt and Konrad Wolf illustrating how restorations drive a second life in theaters, festivals, on TV and platforms. France’s arthouse exhibitors’ association, AFCAE, which marks its 70th anniversary, will examine the future of classic film on the big screen.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs always, there will be the market’s staple sessions, from catalogue holders’ previews to distributors’ line-ups and dedicated events for exhibitors.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfrican cinema will also take the spotlight with a showcase of the new podcast series “Cineastes d’Afrique,” celebrating pioneers of African filmmaking.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLooking to the future, a new European student workshop will bring together some 40 students from six universities to work with professionals in the heritage field. “We want to help the next generation build connections that will shape the sector’s future,” said Desrieux.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Duchaussoy, the workshop reflects the market’s broader mission: “Heritage cinema is not just about looking back,” he said. “It’s about imagining the future, with new professionals, new technologies and new audiences.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Desrieux summed up, “Our goal is to give the heritage sector a stronger international framework and profile. That means bringing players together, questioning our practices and creating real business opportunities around the circulation of classic films.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe MIFC runs in Lyon over Oct. 14–Oct. 17.</p>\n</div>"

I’ve been following her work and growth over the years, and when I heard her pitch at Ventana Sur and we talked a bit about her vision for this debut feature, I was thrilled at the possibility of joining in,” said Pimienta Films’ Nicolas Celis, who boards as a minority partner.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I was impressed by her sensitivity, the depth with which she approached the story, and I was moved by the boldness of the project—tackled with such rigor—that I would’ve been a fool not to jump in and accompany her on this journey,” he added.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Lux Noctis” takes place in a remote matriarchal community where women survive a threatening darkness thanks to their power to create light. Lina, a young woman facing harsh coming-of-age rituals, forms a forbidden connection with a man. Her choice challenges the rules of her world and sparks a rebellion that paves the way for a new way of life.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Nico and Pimienta’s experience with auteur-driven films that have achieved international reach is something we’re all very excited about, and we’re confident it will help take ‘Lux Noctis’ even further,” said Acuña, adding: “Nico and I grew up in the same town in Morelos, which adds a more personal and familiar touch to our collaboration.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We believe that ‘Lux Noctis’ is a project rooted in genre, but Damiana’s vision has the potential to take it to a very powerful level,” said Eduardo Lecuona, a co-founding partner alongside Javier Sepúlveda of Maligno Gorehouse.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Pimienta Films was invited as a co-producer to strengthen the project and form a team to help elevate this fantasy-horror genre project to the level of auteur cinema, an area in which Pimienta is an expert,” added Lecuona, who co-directed “No me sigas” with Ximena Garcia Lecuona<em>.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tMaligno Gorehouse describes itself like “an obsessed Dr. Frankenstein in his lab, set on awakening a new generation of horror filmmakers.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBased in Mexico City, the company has made it its mission to work with young directors that promise to give audiences “new visions of horror.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“Lux Noctis” started gaining traction in 2023, when it participated in the Cine Qua Non Lab and Linterna Lab. It was a semifinalist for the NYX Fellowship (Stowe Story Labs, U.S.) and won multiple development awards at Ventana Sur’s genre sidebar, Blood Window. It also won the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sitges/\">Sitges</a> Film Festival’s <em>Woman in Fan</em> Award and the Fantastic Pavilion Award at Marché du Film. At the BIFFF Market, it won the Hatching Award to present the project at Iberseries & Platino Industria.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt later received the Cinecolor Award at the Los Cabos International Film Festival. In 2025, it was one of five projects selected by Cannes’ Breaking Through the Lens.</p>\n</div>"

Positioned at the intersection of urban exploration and personal memory\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The Fable of the Turtle and the Flower”</strong> (“La fabula de la tortuga y la flor,” Carolina Campo Lupo, 2025, Monarca Films) Uruguay/Spain<br />A deeply personal and formally inventive co-production between Uruguay and Spain, this documentary blends intimate vérité footage with poetic reflection on terminal illness and enduring friendship.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The Boy Who Dreams”</strong> (“El niño que sueña,” Andrés Varela, 2025, Coral Cine) Uruguay/France<br />A character-driven biographical documentary anchored in the life and work of an acclaimed visual artist who, after surviving a life-altering stroke in 2011, now creates in seclusion in rural France. Directed by Varela (“Benedetti, 60 años con luz” ) shot across two continents, the film combines strong production values with a contemplative narrative.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“An Errant Dream”</strong> (“Un sueño errante,” Sofía Betarte, 2025, Montelona) Uruguay/Brazil<br />Tackling migration, gig work and motherhood through a feminist and cross-border lens, this Uruguayan-Brazilian documentary follows a Cuban immigrant navigating economic uncertainty in Montevideo.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Instinct”</strong> (Andrés Varela, Carlos Morelli, 2026, El Delirio Story House) Uruguay/Germany<br />An inclusive, cross-cultural documentary chronicling the German theater company Thikwa—comprised of neurodiverse artists—as they prepare to premiere a new performance in Uruguay. Shot in Germany and Montevideo, the film examines themes of accessibility, artistic expression and maternal identity.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Uncomfortable Body”</strong> (“Cuerpo incomodo,” Estefanía Martínez, 2026, Región Cinema – Insumisa Films) Uruguay/Spain<br />A first-person, introspective documentary exploring chronic illness and memory through the lens of director Estefanía Martínez, who lives with multiple sclerosis. Shot between Uruguay and Spain, the film aims to engage with embodiment, resilience and identity.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Ponsonbyland”</strong> (Ramiro Cabrera, 2025, Asador Cine) Uruguay/Belgium<br />This documentary explores the role of British diplomat John Ponsonby in the formation of both Uruguay and Belgium as independent nations. Through a historical and comparative lens, the film highlights parallels and contrasts in the two countries’ paths to statehood—while also examining how those founding moments echo in the present-day identity struggles of their citizens.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Hitlerland”</strong> (Ana Tipa, 2026, Huerfanita Films) Uruguay/Argentina<br />A provocative and darkly ironic documentary that explores the identity of Hitler Da Silva, a man whose name shaped his childhood and his social experiences. Anchored in Ana Tipa’s observational lens, the film uses a singular case to reflect on stigma, naming and destiny within Latin American contexts.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Into the River”</strong> (“Rio adentro,” Pablo Martínez Pessi, 2026, Gabinete Films) Uruguay/Argentina<br />This observational documentary follows Lucas, a fisherman and photographer, as he embarks on a personal and artistic journey into the riverside forests of Uruguay and Argentina.

The film deconstructs physical identity, familial bonds and the performative nature of gender and desire – all while its central location teeters on collapse.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The 7 Bullets”</strong> (“Las 7 balas,” Sebastián Pérez Pérez, 2026, McGuffin) Uruguay<br />Structured as a multi-perspective thriller, “The 7 Bullets” reconstructs the events of a chaotic bar attack in Montevideo, drawing connections between random violence, media sensationalism and latent political tensions.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The Other Lara”</strong> (“El robo de Lara,” Juan Manuel Solé, 2026, Region Cinema) Uruguay<br />A bold cross-media narrative that spans a feature film and an interactive video game, The Other Lara” follows a photographer and cosplayer whose identity is stolen in the digital world. As fiction and technology intersect, the project opens new terrain for narrative experimentation and audience engagement.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Dogs”</strong> (“Perros,” Gerardo Minutti, 2025, Cinevinay – Cimarrón Cine) Uruguay/Argentina<br />A darkly comedic social satire in which two neighboring families spiral into conflict over a missing dog.

Produced by Sandino Saravia Vinay, whose production credits take in “Roma,” “The Blue Trail” and “Birds of Passage,” and Latin-American <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/the-mediapro-studio-cimarron-colombia-jaime-camil-1236535191/\">production-services powerhouse Cimarrón</a> (“The Ravaging Wind”).</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“A Loose End”</strong> (“Un cabo suelto,” Daniel Hendler, 2026, Cordón Films) Uruguay/Argentina<br />Santiago, a low-ranking Argentine police officer, crosses into Uruguay on the run from his own force. Armed only with his uniform and wit, he drifts from roadside food stalls to rural hideouts, surviving by charm and instinct. With elements of social realism and light absurdism, the film balances comedy and drama as Santiago attempts to reassemble his life.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tWelcome to “The Lyrics of a Showgirl.” Any <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift/\">Taylor Swift</a> album is endlessly quotable, and her 12th is far from the first exception, even if you have to go a few tracks in to start getting to the truly provocative or meme-worthy lines you know are coming. It’s an album primarily of romantic songs — more flagrant and uninterrupted professions of love than she’s ever allowed herself on a single album before, that’s for certain — and so, with grievances fading into the background a bit, you should be prepared for Swift coming on as a swooning softie. But there are also a couple of numbers in which her more lacerating side is in full view, even if she sounds playful as she tells perceived adversaries what’s what.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHere’s a song-by-song guide to the most telling lyrics in each of the 12 songs. (And before or after you scan these lyric excerpts, take a separate look at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/album-reviews/taylor-swift-album-review-life-of-a-showgirl-1236537532/\"><em>Variety</em>‘s full review of the album</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>THE FATE OF OPHELIA</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tSurely, since the dawn of the internet, there have never been quite so many young people doing searches on a specific work of Shakespeare as there have since Swift announced the title of this album’s leadoff track, which has also turned out to be its first single and music video. In short, things don’t go so well for Ophelia in “Hamlet” so borrowing her name for a song title sounds more appropriate for one of the darker bonus tracks from “The Tortured Poets Department” than an entirely post-Kelce album. True, Ophelia does go mad in the play, and Swift has already expressed her fondness for madwomen. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The eldest daughter of a nobleman<br />Ophelia lived in fantasy<br />Her love was a cold bed full of scorpions<br />The venom stole her sanity</em>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the bouncy music bed provided by Max Martin and Shellback makes it clear that Swift is treading the light side, and the song is about how her fiance <em>saved</em> her from going insane in the membrane. She breaks from Shakespeare to describe her beau’s legendary cold calling…</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>I heard you calling on the megaphone<br />You wanna see me all alone<br />As legend has it you are quite the pyro<br />You light the match to watch it blow</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the song gets the album’s sole sports allusion out of the way early:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>On the land, the sea, the sky<br />Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAs we soon will see from some of the lyrics that lean less toward the strictly lovey-dovey and a bit more toward the risque, Swift has definitely not gotten herself to a nunnery. </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>ELIZABETH TAYLOR</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tDespite titling the second track after one of filmdom’s greatest legends (a la “Clara Bow” on the last record), and having once invoked Taylor in song before (remember “He can be my jailer/Burton to my Taylor”?), Swift doesn’t go in very deep on references to Taylor’s life or career. She seems mostly interested in the late actress’s swoon-making eye color:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>And if your letters ever said “goodbye”<br />I’d cry my eyes violet</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThere’s a reference to her favorite chart position, and her long-running singlehood:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>I been number one but I never had two</em></p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, it’s gift-giving season:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Hey, what could you possibly get for the girl who has everything and nothing all at once?<br />Babe, I would trade the Cartier for someone to trust (just kidding)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThat wiseacre parenthetical addition lets us know she’s not pretending to be a completely immaterial girl. (For equivocation, the “just kidding” she adds might be ambivalence on the level of John Lennon singing “Revolution 1” and singing “You can count me out” of the revolution and then quietly adding “in.”)</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPALITE</strong>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThis third track on the album is the first one that actually sounds as completely sunny as some of the lyrics are. It’s a burst of full color, even if the repeated references to “onyx” and “opalite” will send some listeners looking up all these different shades of joy. This might be the least quotable song on the album, honestly… but what it lacks in lyrical meme-worthiness, it makes up for in pure joy. Amid all the positivity, the most memorable lines might be the more sour ones the song opens with:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>I had a bad habit of missing lovers past<br />My brother used to call it “eating out of the trash”</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>FATHER FIGURE</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe late George Michael can take credit for the title and the hook but not much else in a song that takes a detour from romance to her lingering capacity for pure vituperation. Most listeners will figure it’s about former mentor Scott Borchetta, since she’s made no secret of that grudge since he sold Big Machine and her catalog with it. In any case the first half of the song takes place from a possible would-be Svengali’s perspective:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>I’ll be your father figure<br />I drink that brown liqor<br />I can make deals with the devil<br />Because my dick’s bigger<br />This love is pure profit<br />Just step into my office<br />I dry your tears with my sleeve</em></p>\n<p>\n\tYou may notice in those lines a sly, somewhat subtle allusion to an earlier classic in her catalog, “This Love,” now with a less earnest twist.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the song gets to the bridge, Swift changes the perspective from the executive’s to her own:</p>\n<p>\n\tYour faultless ambition sparked the ignition on foolish decisions which led to misguided visions<br />That to fulfill your dreams…<br />You had to get rid of me<br />I protect the family</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, a bit of a victory cry following the reclamation of her recorded catalog after six years of trying:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>You pulled the wrong trigger<br />This empire belongs to me</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, oh, by the way… just a bit more braggadocio from Swift to the father figure in question:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Turns out my dick’s bigger</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>ELDEST DAUGHTER</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tArguably the most tender love song on the album begins with an excoriation of the nastiness the web breeds:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Everybody’s so punk on the internet<br />Everyone’s unbothered till they’re not<br />Every joke’s just trolling and memes<br />Sad as it seems, apathy is hot<br />Everybody’s cutthroat in the comments<br />Every single hot take is cold as ice</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThis is really just a preamble to Swift proclaiming that she is a softie, when it comes to her new love:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>But I’m not a bad bitch<br />And this isn’t savage<br />I’m never gonna let you down</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, a confession that will not come as a huge surprise, given present circumstances:\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>When I said I don’t believe in marriage<br />That was a lie</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>RUIN THE FRIENDSHIP</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe one truly sad song on the album is a heartbreaking remembrance of a boy Swift was friends with in school days — Abigail is mentioned as a mutual classmate — and flirted with while keeping things in the friendzone. The nostalgia brings up the only reference to another artist on the album, after her last album was filled with them:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>And it was not an invitation<br />But as the 50 Cent song played<br />Should’ve kissed you anyway</em></p>\n<p>\n\tNow, he’s dead, and the singer flies home for the funeral, whispering her regrets over her timidity at his graveside. And she offers her listeners some personal wisdom:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>My advice is always ruin the friendship<br />Better that than regret it<br />For all time…<br />And my advice is always answer the question<br />Better that than to ask it<br />All your life</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>ACTUALLY ROMANTIC</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tWell, here’s what will surely be the most discussed track on the album. Turns out Borchetta may not be the only former associate with whom she has unresolved issues. Although you can count on Swift never confirming it in this lifetime, it’s going to be widely assumed this is about Charli XCX, who wrote a song for her last album alluding to their estrangement since they toured together in 2018, stating some nervousness over the fact that they were both dating members of the 1975 for a season:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>I heard you call me “Boring Barbie” when the coke’s got you brave<br />High-fived my ex and then you said you’re glad he ghosted me<br />Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAs the song reveals its full playful conceit, Swift insists she is flattered by any bad will coming her way… flattered to the point of, um, arousal:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>You think I’m tacky, baby<br />Stop talking dirty to me<br />It sounded nasty but it feels like you’re flirting with me<br />I mind my business, God’s my witness that I don’t provoke it<br />It’s kind of making me wet</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>WI$H LI$T</strong>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBack to pure romance — but, again, Swift sets up the lovey-dovey stuff in the chorus with a lot of amusing context about other people’s dreams that don’t exactly align with hers.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>They want those bright lights and Balenci shades<br />And a fat ass with a baby face…<br />They want that complex female character<br />They want that critical smash Palme d’Or<br />And an Oscar on their bathroom floor</em></p>\n<p>\n\tWhat she wants, in contrast, is to be left to live out the suburban dream with her husband-to-be (albeit with not too much noseyness from the neighbors), children included:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Have a couple kids<br />Got the whole block looking like you<br />We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone …and they do…<br />Got me dreaming ‘bout a driveway with a basketball hoop<br />Boss up, settle down</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>WOOD</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe theme of the album’s most upbeat and danceable track is initially getting over superstitions about the impossibility of true love — hence the repeated “knock on wood” references. And although this was presumably recorded pre-engagement, she didn’t mind predicting its imminence:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Girls, I don’t need to catch the bouquet<br />To know a hard rock is on the way</em></p>\n<p>\n\tBut “wood” comes to take on a different meaning by the end of the track. At least, it doesn’t seem like she’s referring to a trip to Northern California when she refers to a “redwood tree.” And then, she shares her pal Sabrina Carpenter’s recent predilection for letting us know what is happening with her upper legs. Sorry, mums and dads: </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>It ain’t hard to see<br />His love was the key<br />That opened my thighs</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>CANCELLED!</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tHere Swift assures friends coming into her girl-pack that she doesn’t mind if they’ve got, you know, reputations.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Did you girl-boss too close to the sun?…</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Good thing I like my friend</em>s cancelled..</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>At least you know exactly who your friends are<br />They’re the ones with matching scars</em>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>HONEY</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIn another tender love song, Swift offers various scenarios in which seeming terms of endearment like “honey” and “sweetheart” made her flinch in the past, because they were either uttered sarcastically by testy schoolmates or by lovers being careless with her affections. But not her new guy, who has finally made her love the H-word, and other loving sentiments like it.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>When anyone called me late night<br />He was screwing around with my mind<br />Asking, “What are you wearing?” too high<br />To remember in the morning<br />And when anyone called me ‘lovely’<br />They were finding ways not to praise me<br />But you say it like you’re in awe of me</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-life-of-a-showgirl/\">THE LIFE OF A SHOWGIRL</a></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe album’s final track, a duet with Sabrina Carpenter, is the only one that offers a “Folklore”- or “Evermore”-style detour into a (presumably) fictional character narrative. It’s one in which one or both of the two ladies first get advice at the stage door of a showgirl they adore, then pass that advice along to others coming up after them who need the same counsel. It may not literally track that the song’s heroine, “Kitty,” is a showgirl who is besieged by autograph hounds despite being described as a member of a chorus line of 50 women. But no need to get too hung up on that. In this number, which is ultimately kind of akin to the previous album’s official closer, “Clara Bow,” the point is to get to Swift and Carpenter describing show biz as both challenging and triumphal:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>You wanna take a skate on the ice inside my veins<br />They ripped me off like false lashes<br />And then threw me away<br />And all the headshots on the walls of the dance hall are of the bitches who wish I’d hurruy up and die<br />But, I’m immortal now, baby dolls<br />I couldn’t if I tried</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThat’s chutzpah! But the album then ends on a note of camraderie between showgirls — the real-life Swift and Carpenter — as even the lyric sheet includes the snippet of on-stage dialogue from the Eras Tour that is appended to the track’s end:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>“Give it up for the band, and the dancers, and of course, Sabrina!”</em> … <em>“I love you, Taylor!”</em> All’s well in the world of showgirls that ends in stadium-sized co-bills.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIs the world ready for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift/\">Taylor Swift</a>, utterly untortured poet? Possibly — it’s not as if a whole season’s worth of NFL television cutaways didn’t prime the planet for the idea that Dark Taylor might be ready to take five for a bit. And, sure, the Eras Tour went a little way toward that, too, as no one’s idea of an angst-ridden experience. But not everyone has gotten past the original line on her, that she is someone who professionally mines heartache for hits. She’s almost overturned that notion as a cliche when her last album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” actually really did trade in real-life misery, again, for much of its length… not withstanding the very late-breaking addition of a single song about a football player. Even on tour, fans go expecting dramatic catharsis to be undergirding all that glee. “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,” she proclaimed, asking fans to dance while considering whether her performance might be a false front.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut now we have it confirmed, for sure: She can also do it with a fully intact ticker. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd nobody does it better, now or at any recent time, when it comes to delivering world-dominating pop that feels all the feels and doesn’t stint on the thoughts, either. That those feels are now very much on the sunny side is not a huge surprise, but it’s still just slightly startling how light-hearted the near-entirety of her 12th album, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-life-of-a-showgirl/\">The Life of a Showgirl</a>,” is. She’s flirted with writing an album focused on a love that is actually realized before — most notably on the half of “Reputation” that was about her then-burgeoning relationship and not about Kimye-gate. But on that record, even the happiest songs had a kind of love-among-the-ruins feel, where the romanticism seemed hard-fought. On “The Life of a Showgirl,” though, love seems <em>easy</em>-fought. And the belief that it might actually be a breeze, instead of, like, the eye of a hurricane, makes for an album that stands as close to being an uncomplicated good time as anything she’s ever done.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThere <em>is</em> shade amid all this sunshine, mind you… as in, the thrown kind. If you haven’t yet heard about the pair of diss tracks that arrive as prominently as banner headlines in the middle of the album, “Father Figure” and “Actually Romantic,” you probably will soon enough. What would a Taylor Swift album be without scores to settle, even if they are just passing asides this time instead of a main dish? She flourishes with adversaries, even if they are relegated to her peripheral vision or rear-view mirror. But the aforementioned tracks are actually two of the happiest-sounding numbers on the album, which is saying something. It’s just a given: the suite at Arrowhead Stadium will never be the only place where she’s keeping score.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut back to love. “The Life of a Showgirl” is filled with it, and in getting that ebullience across, she has the aid this time of two super-producers who are returning to her side after eight years, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/max-martin/\">Max Martin</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/shellback/\">Shellback</a>. It’s one of the few times she’s ever used the same producer(s) for an entire album project, and certainly the first where she’s only co-written with that same team and no one else. It seems safe to assume she is not estranged from either Jack Antonoff or Aaron Dessner, the steadiest enablers of her modern eras. And those two maestros can certainly help her write a good love song, it’s been proven. But you get the sense she wanted to make sure there was nothing <em>dainty</em> about this aural engagement party, and maybe that’s where she felt Martin and Shellback would offer some extra insurance. </p>\n<p>\n\tThey have delivered, with an album that doesn’t really sound exactly like their parts of “Red,” “1989” or “Reputation,” yet is filled with basic-sounding but compelling beats that immediately make you feel like she has entrusted herself and her fans into the right hands for now. It’s a love story, and it’s also a Swedish family reunion. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe album starts off with what we now know to be its first single and music video, “The Fate of Ophelia.” (In true 2010s Swift fashion, no one got the slightest public whiff of either before the full album was out for judging as a whole; she learned her lesson from her very last pre-album single, “Me!,” and can also afford to be withholding.) From the title, you’d think it would be one of those fatalist ballads that peppered the second half of the deluxe edition of “Tortured Poets Department”… most of which were pretty terrific, by the way. And for about 10 seconds, the chords sure sound like a Dessner track. Then the Martin/Shellback <em>throb</em> kicks in, and before the first word is sung, we know we’re not in New England anymore. Of course, title notwithstanding, this opener is as gleeful as the rest of the record, as Swift sings about being rescued from a descent into Shakespearian madness by her happy-go-lucky baller. She sings: “On the land, the sea, the sky / Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes.” (Don’t worry — that is the last quasi-football reference on the album.)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNext up, “Elizabeth Taylor” is the closest thing to a skip on the album — disappointing maybe to those of us, anyway, who’d hoped it would have more to do with the actress herself than a reference to Swift “crying my eyes violet.” (“Ready for It?” seemed to have more to do with Liz than the track named after her does.) And the weight of “Reputation-but-not-as-good” hangs over it. But the album seriously kicks into gear with its third number, “Opalite,” a song that starts modestly and then surprises you with a sheer pheromone rush of a chorus. From that slow-burning head-rush forward, “The Life of a Showgirl” never lets up, in the quality of its subtle but completely engaging pop arrangements or in Swift’s audacity in giving every lyric a high-concept variation on a theme. The Chiefs’ chief music critic did not lie, in that podcast: It <em>is</em> an album full of bangers, and even the ballads pop off.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Showgirl” is not aimed at the dance floor, per se, though there are plenty of songs that have propulsive rhythm enough for a sweeter kind of grind. One track is a real outlier, though, and bears a prominent mention as such: “Wood.” It’s a Jackson 5 song in everything but name, credit or composition, with a funk-pop guitar riff classic-sounding enough that I had to double-check the credits to make sure it wasn’t a Motown sample. (No, this is not an invitation for someone to file a nuisance suit.) It also ends up being maybe the most sexual song Swift has done, and while that may not seem like it’s saying a lot, this is the women who sang “Dress,” so there’s some precedent there. Let’s just say that the title may not refer strictly to Home Depot materials, and there is a repeated reference to Swift’s thighs that rivals her friend <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sabrina-carpenter/\">Sabrina Carpenter</a>‘s recent single for anatomical specificity.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other side of the coin, a hearty shift toward big romance and a little eroticism has not kept Swift from dipping into her characteristically more reflective songwriting, as a yin to the album’s celebratory yang. All the talk of sun rays does not negate that there’s one truly sad song on the album, “Ruin the Friendship,” although it sounds so uplifting, it doesn’t drag the proceedings down. There, Swift sings about a boy who knew in school who was kept in the friendzone, by unspoken mutual assent, despite a shared crush. By the end of the song, she is being called home — by Abigail, the bestie Swifties well know — to attend his funeral, where she whispers, “Should’ve kissed you anyway.” It actually ends up being rousing, in spite of itself, as Swift gives her young and old listeners some life counsel: “My advice is always ruin the friendship / Better that than regret it / For all time… / And my advice is always answer the question / Better that than to ask it.” If this reads at all treacly on paper, rest assured it will break just a tiny piece of your heart off as you hear it sung.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Ruin the Friendship” counts as one of the prettiest songs Swift has ever written, and so, for that matter, does a much happier number, “Eldest Daughter,” which is about being a lover first of all and birth order only incidentally. It’s one of her love songs to her new beau, and begins with a dystopian view of the meanness that the web fosters, before Swift lifts her voice and plaintively sings: “But I’m not a bad bitch / And this isn’t savage.” She reverts from talk of childhood to the self-protections that set in in life: “Every eldest daughter / Was the first lamb to the slaughter / So we all dressed up as wolves and we looked fire.” And a nod to him when she says: “Every youngest child felt / They were raised up in the wild / But now you’re home.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBut does the woman who sang “Bad Blood” really believe that she’s not a bad bitch, to borrow her language? There are those two provocations, or slap-backs, depending on how you look on it, on the album, and suddenly she doesn’t sound so much like the softie she proclaims herself to be to her man in that tender centerpiece. “Father Figure,” without much filter to speak of, seemingly a deep dig at Scott Borchetta, borrowing George Michael’s title and chorus cadence to invent a new tale of a Svengali who gets what’s coming to him — some presumed guilt or remorse — even as she gets the masters that are coming to her. The song doesn’t get quite that literal, but when she sings “You pulled the wrong trigger / This empire belongs to me,” we don’t have to read the Genius.com notes to know what she’s talking about. She’s written her share of slightly disguised songs about that situation — “My Tears Ricochet” was one — but now, at the right time to do a victory lap, she’s taking the brakes off.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then there’s “Actually Romantic,” which will appear to most observers to plainly be an answer song to the tune that former tourmate Charli XCX released last year referencing her. “I heard you call me ‘Boring Barbie’ when the coke’s got you brave / High-fived my ex and then you said you’re glad he ghosted me  / Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face / Some people might be offended  / But it’s actually sweet  / All the time you’ve spent on me,” she sings. If it sounds nasty, it’s in the high-spirited tradition of “I Forgot That You Existed,” her kiss-off to the Kim and Kanye situation of some years back. It’s funny as hell, but barbed as hell, and whether the recipient deserves it with what Swift clearly sees as salvos that came her way first will be much up for debate that goes above our pay grade to adjudicate.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSwift is obviously on better terms with some of her other opening acts, with Sabrina Carpenter coming in for a full-on duet (versus Lana Del Rey’s recent near-ghost vocal) on the title track that closes the album. Here, the star makes a further detour from the more diaristic songs that preceded it to tell a narrative tale of weathered entertainers passing down homespun and hard-fought wisdom, a la “Clara Bow” or maybe even harking back to “The Lucky One.” It’s an outlier, but an anthemic one to go out on.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat Martin and Shellback have done here, with Swift obviously very active as a co-producer, is help deliver an album that has the confident sheen you expect with them, but also just drops most of the possible instrumentation out for stretches of almost every song. Can a record be shiny and also kind of earthy and spare, in the whole? If it can, that’s what a lot of “The Life of a Showgirl” sounds like — utterly pleasing and deceptively simple rhythms, where it really seems like there’s “not a lot going on at the moment,” to borrow a phrase. Some of the most ear-tickling passages just consist of a bass, a drum loop (or maybe real drums, hard to say) and then Swift’s very naked solo voice suddenly triple- or quadruple-tracked into a playful choir, without any big army of synths to bolster it. “Elizabeth Taylor,” the second song, might be the album’s closest flirtation with a truly big and overwhelming production. That one sounds like it could be a “Reputation” outtake, but it’s also maybe the least impressive cut on the album. “Showgirl” is really at its most engaging, sonically, when it’s a little more bare-bones than that. And who knew the day would come when you’d fine somebody acclaiming Martin and Shellback for being brilliant minimalists, but here we are, with a pretty groove-alicious Taylor Swift record that spreads its love primarily through crafty mid-tempos.</p>\n<p>\n\tSwift has never made two albums that sound alike, and that’s certainly the case with this nearly polar-opposite followup to her “Tortured” era. We like her when she’s mad (with apologies to the Incredible Hulk), and of course, she already proudly told us there’s nothing like a madwoman. But she also once told us, “Why be mad when you can be glad?” Yes, there was an acronym involved there we’re leaving out, but the point stands: Maybe, just maybe, we can like her at least as much when she’s just mad about the boy. It’s too late for Swift to have a “song of the summer,” but this feels like the Album of the Summer — the calendar be damned. It’s giddy, funny, touching, silly, haughty and moving in about equal measure, but most of all, it’s got a sunstruck kind of love that besottedly seeps through the orange LP grooves and might even make you believe in romance again, too. Bring your own SPF 50.</p>\n</div>"

Raised by an evangelical mother that he obsessed over and having desecrated human cadavers to make a skin suit, Gein and his story are rife with disturbing, unprecedented psychological drama.</p>\n<p>\n\tGein redefined how Americans thought of serial killers and psychopaths, and his case inspired movies such as “Psycho,” “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” and “Silence of the Lambs.” Now, Ryan Murphy brings the original story to life in his signature, dramatized manner.</p>\n<p>\n\tHere is a look at all of the characters, each based off of real-life people, in “Monster’s”‘ most unnerving season yet.</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Ed Gein (Charlie Hunnam)</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Monster__The_Ed_Gein_Story_n_S1_E2_00_28_45_12R_736cb5.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Monster: The Ed Gein Story.

Dubbed the Butcher of Plainfield, Ed Gein notoriously exhumed bodies from cemeteries near the Wisconsin town in the 1950s and eventually confessed to having killed two people. It’s suspected that he was tied to additional morbid crimes, which the show unpacks in excruciating detail. His unsettling roots, shocking violence, and notorious case redefined the image of the American serial killer and psychopath. Gein died in custody in 1984, but his brutal legacy continues in the form of unsolved cases, numerous horror films and ceaseless nightmares. Hunnam’s other notable credits include “Pacific Rim,” “The Lost City of Z,” and “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.”</p></article>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Augusta Gein (Laurie Metcalf)</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Monster__The_Ed_Gein_Story_n_S1_E4_00_24_58_05R.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Monster: The Ed Gein Story.

Augusta Gein, the woman who birthed and raised Ed, was a religious zealot who brought up her sons with a fear of God and a firm belief that the world was an immoral, sinful place. She raised her boys on their family farm in relative isolation. Ed developed an obsession with Augusta, which only deepened after his father and brother died and he was left to care for her alone. Augusta died in 1945. Laurie Metcalf of “Rosanne,” “The Conners” and “Lady Bird,” plays Augusta in the series.</p></article>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Alfred Hitchcock (Tom Hollander)</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Monster__The_Ed_Gein_Story_n_S1_E2_00_43_49_15R.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Monster: The Ed Gein Story.

Tom Hollander plays Hitchcock in the series, depicting how the master of suspense adapted the notorious serial killer’s story into one of the most influential films of all time.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThere are two ways to think about “Nineteen Eighty-Four,” the great dystopian novel of totalitarianism that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/george-orwell/\">George Orwell</a> wrote on the Scottish isle of Jura and published in 1949, six months before his death (at 46, of complications from tuberculosis). The first and most obvious way to think about it is as a midnight-dark tale of political oppression: the deprivation and bullying violence that dominate life in a ruthless authoritarian state. To a large degree, Orwell based the book on his perception of the Soviet Union, but he drew from other regimes as well, crafting a myth of what it’s like to exist as a humble pawn in a fascist prison state.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tYet that’s not ultimately the reason “Nineteen Eighty-Four” remains such a brilliant and mind-blowing book. Orwell was arguably the greatest <em>psychologist </em>of totalitarianism who ever lived. The words and phrases we get from “Nineteen Eighty-Four” that became famous (Big Brother, thoughtcrime, doublethink) remain more relevant than ever, and just as heady to ponder as they were 76 years ago, because what those words speak to isn’t merely the cruelty of life under totalitarianism — it’s the <em>insanity</em> of it, the way that fascist regimes destroy not just freedom but reality. That’s actually the cruelest thing about them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/orwell-22-5/\">Orwell: 2+2 = 5</a>” is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/raoul-peck/\">Raoul Peck</a>’s documentary meditation on Orwell’s writing, and on how his visionary insight applies to the world today. The film’s title piqued my interest, since that famous bit of business from “Nineteen Eighty-Four” — it refers to a torturer insisting to Winston Smith that he admit, <em>in his mind</em>, that 2+2 really does equal 5 — speaks to the essence of Orwell’s great theme, which is the metaphysics of fascism. If you’re willing to believe that 2+2 = 5, then you’ve allowed the state to determine reality to the point that it determines what’s going on inside you. At that point, you truly are owned; or maybe you don’t quite exist. But how does that dynamic work? How does it evolve? And how does it apply to the present day?\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThose are essential questions, but the surprise and, I have to say it, the disappointment of “Orwell: 2+2 = 5” is that the film doesn’t quite answer them. Peck, nine years ago, made the great ruminative documentary <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/i-am-not-your-negro-review-new-york-film-festival-james-baldwin-1201876756/\">“I Am Not Your Negro,”</a> based on the writings of James Baldwin, and that film was suffused with mystery. It was about racism and oppression, but Baldwin was a writer who dissected racism from a perch of perception that wasn’t just moralistic; he opened your mind to the deepest layers of identity. Whereas “2+2 = 5” is a movie that very much leans toward chronicling the brutality and violence of despotic regimes, and is less interested in exploring how they toy with your brain.</p>\n<p>\n\tPeck fills the film with footage of contemporary autocracies and their infamous leaders (Marcos, Pinochet, Putin, Orbán). He also features images of the destruction of war, like the aftermath of the “strategic bombing” of Berlin during World War II — though that feels like a strange one to include, since it raises ethical questions about war crimes along the lines of what was explored in “The Fog of War,” but that all seems very separate from Orwell (plus, the world <em>was</em> fighting fascism during WWII).</p>\n<p>\n\t“Orwell: 2+2 = 5” is in part a portrait of Orwell, and on that score it’s quite compelling. We hear of his experiences as a teenager (when he looked round-faced and a bit smirky in a way that set him apart from his peers), or working for the imperial British state in Burma, which first imbued him with a sense of cosmic injustice. He saw the insidiousness of empire in his own middle-class desire to be a “gentleman,” and that pitiless ability to examine life through the prism of his own flaws is part of what made Orwell such a thrillingly honest writer. The film then traces him, through his diary and letters and other writings, over the last two years of his life, when he was stricken with tuberculosis and he moved from one health facility to the next, all the while finishing the manuscript that would become “Nineteen Eighty-Four.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOrwell’s essays and novels are read on the soundtrack with puckish gravity by Damian Lewis, and as long as we’re hearing the flow of thoughts like “Everything in our age conspires to turn the writer, and every other kind of artist as well, into a minor official, working on themes handed down from above, and never telling what seems to him the whole of the truth,” or “Everyone believes in the atrocities of the enemy and disbelieves in those of his own side, without ever bothering to examine the evidence,” we can luxuriate in his 20-20 wisdom.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut when it comes to the works that made Orwell famous, notably “Nineteen Eighty-Four” and “Animal Farm,” Peck makes the obvious but misguided decision to string together clips of the numerous film versions of them. The reason I think that’s a mistake is that with the possible exception of the 1956 version of “1984,” none of those films are really very good, and they slow the documentary down. (The version made in 1984, with John Hurt looking a lot like Orwell, is particularly drab.) These movies, too, miss the head-trip aspect of totalitarianism, and that’s partly because it’s such a difficult thing to dramatize. It would have helped to have had some critical voices explain Orwell’s insights into how the ultimate purpose of authoritarianism is to rob people of themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film is on more solid ground when it leaps to the present day and deals with the “surveillance capitalists” (there’s a clip of Edward Snowden speaking quite eloquently on the subject), or charts the banning of books, or the rise of orthodox media narratives, or phrases (“peacekeeping operations”) that mean anything but what they say. At this point, we start to touch the meat of the matter: how societies, armed with technology (that Big Brother home television screen was Oceania’s window into your soul), manipulate reality.</p>\n<p>\n\t“2+2 = 5” is didactic in a way that Orwell, I suspect, would have looked a bit askance at. Except for a few shots of China’s President Xi presiding over a military parade, the film’s image of totalitarianism leans far more toward right-wing regimes; to leave out Mao, or Castro, feels like a mistake. Yet the film’s timeliness is still a tonic, given that the spirit of autocracy looks more and more like a virus that now wants to take over the world. The film’s vision of the Trump presidency is scathing, and it puts its finger on one moment — the rationalizations made by George W. Bush to attack Iraq — as a key transitional event into the New Age of American Political Fakery. It was Orwell who got there first, showing us how thoughtcrime arrives not just when dictators lay down the law but when we stop believing we have the right to believe our own eyes.</p>\n</div>"

    "description": "\n\tDisney has pledged $5 million to help rebuild a park in Altadena that was destroyed by January’s wildfire, with help from the members of the company",
    "body": "\n\tDisney has pledged $5 million to help rebuild a park in Altadena that was destroyed by January’s wildfire, with help from the members of the company’s famously innovative Walt Disney Imagineering department.\n\n\tCharles White Park, which sits just off Fair Oaks Avenue near the Pasadena-Altadena border, will include “a new community center and an enhanced playground infused with Disney magic to bring joy to families in the area for its anticipated reopening in 2026,” Disney said.\n\t\n\n\tDisney disclosed Monday that some Imagineers have already been working with Los Angeles County officials on the site planning, landscape architecture and playground design for the five-acre site. Disney is supporting the rebuilding of the park as part of its $15 million donation to Los Angeles area wildfire relief that followed the wind-whipped infernos that devastated Altadena in the foothills above Pasadena  as well as across the county in Pacific Palisades near the Santa Monica coastline.\n\n\n\tDisney is also helping to rebuild two other park sites in Altadena that were nearly destroyed by the fire. A number of staff in Walt Disney Imagineering lost homes during the Altadena and Palisades fire, adding urgency and purpose to their work.\n\n\t“Los Angeles has been home to the Walt Disney Company since its founding more than a century ago, which is why we felt a special responsibility to help this community rebuild in the aftermath of the devastating wildfires earlier this year,” said Disney chief Bob Iger. “I’m incredibly proud of our Imagineers who are volunteering their time and talents to help reimagine cherished public spaces like Charles White Park. Their work is not only a testament to Disney’s creative spirit, but also to our deep commitment to our neighbors throughout this region. We hope this effort brings comfort, joy, and a sense of renewal to the Altadena community for years to come.”\n\t\n\n\tKathryn Barger, member of the LA County Board of Supervisors, praised Disney for its donation of money as well as resources via the Imagineers.\n\n\t“Knowing that Disney’s Imagineers will pour their time, talent, and compassion into Altadena’s recovery is truly inspiring,” said Barger. “Their work on Charles White Park and other community spaces is more than restoration. It is a gift of hope, joy, and healing for families who have endured so much this year.”\n\n\tDisney has also embraced a longstanding Christmas tradition that kicks off the holiday season for many families in the wider area. Per the Disney annnouncement:\n\n\t“Disney is also supporting one of Altadena’s most cherished traditions: The Christmas Tree Lane Lighting Ceremony and Winter Festival on December 6. First organized in 1920, this event is one of the oldest large-scale outdoor Christmas light displays in the world. The company will bring some signature Disney Magic to the lighting event, including character appearances, festive moments, and meaningful volunteer opportunities to support families in need during the season. Disney also will help support the community’s annual toy drive with a donation of more than 1,000 toys that evening.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRoblox will launch facial age checks as a requirement for all users who want to access communication features beginning next month. The gaming platform has also implemented age-based chats to limit communication between minors and adults.\n\n\tStarting Tuesday, the process will be available as a voluntary feature across Roblox. Beginning the first week of December, Roblox will start to enforce the age-check requirement in select markets, including Australia, the Netherlands and New Zealand. The requirements are set to expand to the U.S. and other remaining markets where Roblox’s chat rooms are available by early January 2026.\n\t\n\n\tSpecific dates for the rollout have not yet been specified. \n\n\n\tThe new safety measures makes them the first online platform to require facial age checks to access chat rooms.\n\n\tAs previously reported, the move comes amid recent lawsuits filed against Roblox regarding its child safety regulations and accusations of grooming behavior experienced on the platform.\n\n\tIn September, Roblox first announced a goal to expand its age estimation technology to all of its users by the end of this year. \n\n\tAs of Tuesday, Roblox has also launched a new Safety Center, meant to act as “a dedicated resource for parents and caregivers that provides clear guidance and tools to help them make informed decisions, set up Parental Controls, and support their child’s online experience.”\n\n\t“Robust and highly effective age assurance technology plays a critical role in maintaining the safety of child users online, helping to protect them from harmful and illegal content and high-risk interactions, whilst they develop age-appropriate digital literacy skills,” Stephen Balkam, CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute, said in a statement.\n\t\n\n\tRoblox’s Facial Age Estimation process will be conducted by using the camera on the user’s device through the app. Images and videos for age checks are processed by Persona, a Roblox vendor, and are deleted immediately after processing.\n\n\tAfter users complete the age-check process, users will be assigned to one of six age groups: under nine, nine to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20 or 21 and up. \n\n\tDesigned to ensure safer, more age-appropriate interactions, players can chat only with peers in their group or similar groups.\n\n\t​A spokesperson from the National Crime Agency described Roblox’s latest safety feature as “robust and highly effective age assurance technology plays a critical role in maintaining the safety of child users online, helping to protect them from harmful and illegal content and high-risk interactions, whilst they develop age-appropriate digital literacy skills.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tDoha Film Institute CEO Fatma Hassan Alremaihi, who over the past 15 years has been instrumental in turning the DFI into the region’s pre-eminent indie industry driver with its film funding programs, is looking to take the DFI’s role to the next level.\n\n\tAlremaihi is spearheading the launch of the upcoming Doha Film Festival, which runs Nov. 20-28 in the Qatari capital and will transform the DFI’s existing Ajyal fest for youth audiences into a more ambitious international event for a broader audience.\n\t\n\n\tCharacterized by a strong regional component and an accent on the Palestinian plight, the Doha Film Festival will open with Kaouther Ben Hania’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” as previously announced.\n\n\n\tThere will be 97 films from 62 countries – about half of which are cherry-picked regional premieres of titles that have already bowed at the world’s top festivals – screening across different sections.\n\n\tBut the Doha Film Festival will also intentionally overlap with Geekdom, Qatar’s largest pop culture event, which spans from E-sports tournaments, to anime, cosplaying and live gaming, as well as film and music performances.\n\n\tAhead of its inaugural edition, the DFI chief, who is also the fest’s artistic director, took questions from Variety and explained the spirit of the fest and the synergy between the two events. \n\n\tTalk to me about the importance of amplifying Palestinian voices at the Doha Film Festival, starting with the opener, “The Voice of Hind Rajab”\n\n\tDFI has always championed voices from underrepresented communities from around the world to bring balanced, truthful narratives to global audiences. So amplifying Palestinian stories has been essential in our work as a cultural organization. Cinema captures the perseverance of the human spirit like no other art form can, opens hearts and changes perspectives, and that’s never been more necessary than it is today.\n\t\n\n\tWe remain steadfast in our commitment to the accurate portrayal of their lived experiences and humanity and opening with “The Voice of Hind Rajab” is an intentional choice.  It’s a reminder of why cinema matters — because it bears witness, confronts truth, preserves memory, and restores humanity to those voices being reduced to headlines or silenced.\n\n\tPalestinian filmmakers have always shown extraordinary courage and artistry in telling stories of loss, resilience, and identity, and we are standing in solidarity by ensuring that their narratives are seen, discussed, and felt globally.\n\n\tWhat are the festival’s four world premieres? How important will it be for this event to get world premieres going forward?\n\n\tWe are honored to host the world premieres of [Qatari thriller] “Sa3oud Wainah” by Mohammed Al-Ibrahim; “My Story” [a doc about Syrian actor and political figure Jamal Soliman] by Egyptian director Yasser Ashour; “When the Camera Froze” by [Palestinian artist and war photographer Belal Khaled]; and “Abu Jabal” by [Palestinian director] Bisan Owda — each a powerful original voice and a testament to the creativity and resilience of filmmakers who are redefining storytelling from our region.\n\n\tWorld premieres mean much more than the prestige or headlines they create – it is the trust they represent. When a filmmaker chooses to share their film with the world for the first time here in Doha, they acknowledge our festival as an important place of discovery and dialogue.\n\n\tAs we grow, we continue to strengthen our relationships and make Doha Film Festival a place where artists feel safe, supported and honored for their bold ideas, and where stories from the Arab world resonate beyond borders.\n\n\tTalk to me about the festival’s industry side. How is this fest going to help advance Qatar’s role in the film, TV, and media sector?\n\n\tThe DFF Talks include the industry component of the festival, with the Industry Days program presented by Film Committee at Media City Qatar. \n\n\tThese cover a broad spectrum of creative work that intersects with how films are made and what they are made about, contributing to Qatar’s leadership as a global hub for creative development.\n\n\tThe industry platform builds directly on 15 years of the DFI’s longstanding mission of nurturing talent, connecting local and regional voices with international experts from the creative community.\n\t\n\n\tDFF 2025’s industry events reinforce Qatar’s position as a dynamic hub for storytelling and creative production and the festival’s position as a launchpad for promising talent from our region. From facilitating co-productions to sales and distribution deals, we are growing a sustainable ecosystem for film, TV, and emerging media that turns creative ambition into lasting industry impact.\n\n\tHow is the festival going to intersect with Geekdom, which is Qatar’s largest pop culture event?\n\n\tGeekdom shares the same spirit as Doha Film Festival — one of imagination, creativity and community. As Qatar’s homegrown pop culture convention, Geekdom has evolved into a beautiful space where our creative communities – fans, gamers, artists and creators – unite to honor what they love.\n\n\tThe synergy between the two events expands the idea of storytelling to include the deep connection between cinema and popular culture. Film, gaming, animation and cosplay are all forms of expression that inspire and unite people, and this reflects our belief that creativity is not limited by the medium with which we choose to express it. Whether it’s on the big screen or in a virtual world, the stories that resonate with us remind us of who we are and how we are connected through things that we love.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney+ has forged a groundbreaking partnership with CJ ENM‘s Korean streaming platform Tving, introducing bundled subscription packages that combine global and local content at discounted rates — a first-of-its-kind collaboration between an international and local streaming service in South Korea.\n\n\tThe deal offers Korean consumers two bundle options launching immediately: a Disney+,Tving and local streamer Wavve package at KRW21,500 ($14.60) monthly, representing up to 37% savings compared to separate subscriptions, and a Disney+-Tving bundle at KRW18,000 ($12.30) monthly, offering 23% savings against the combined cost of Disney+ Standard and Tving Standard.\n\t\n\n\tThe bundled plans provide access to Disney’s franchise content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, National Geographic and Hulu, alongside Disney+ Korean originals and popular Korean dramas, variety programming and entertainment from Tving, Wavve and CJ ENM.\n\n\n\tThe Korean deal follows a content partnership in Japan. Since Nov. 5, Disney+ Japan has begun rolling out up to 60 Korean titles, including CJ ENM hits “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God (Goblin)” and “Reply 1988.” Tving original series “Dear X” premiered exclusively on Disney+ Japan on Nov. 6, marking the platform’s first major push into the Japanese market.\n\n\tTony Zameczkowski, senior VP and general manager of direct-to-consumer for Asia Pacific at Walt Disney Company, said: “By partnering with Tving and Wavve, we’re expanding our reach, enriching the content ecosystem, and offering greater value to consumers. We’re also proud to support the global journey of Korean content and hope this sets a new standard for cross-border collaboration in the streaming industry.”\n\t\n\n\tKim Soyoun, managing director of Walt Disney Company Korea, added: “This collaboration not only enhances the value we offer to Korean consumers but also strengthens our role as a bridge between local creativity and global audiences.” \n\n\tTving CEO Julie Choi said: “We also look forward to seeing more Korean stories reach new audiences around the world and be loved by them through our collaboration with Disney+ Japan.” \n\n\tThe partnership arrives as Disney+ continues expanding its Korean content slate with originals including “Moving,” “Low Life” and “Tempest,” along with new formats like mid-form variety series “Weekly Entertainment Arcade.” The platform positions itself as a dual destination for both Disney’s century-long catalog of global entertainment and growing Korean productions.\n",

    "body": "\n\tYoon Ga-eun‘s “The World of Love” has emerged as a breakout success in South Korea‘s independent film sector, drawing widespread praise from top-tier filmmakers.\n\n\t“The World of Love” has surpassed 100,000 admissions at the Korean box office as of Nov. 14, and the film’s box office is north of $700,000. \n\n\tThe feature has attracted notable support from prominent figures in the industry, including Bong Joon Ho, Kim Jee-woon, Yeon Sang-ho, Kim Tae-ri, Kore-eda Hirokazu, Jia Zhangke, BTS member RM and Greta Lee.\n\t\n\n\tDirector Bong hosted a talk session focused on the film, building on his long-standing admiration for Yoon’s work. He has previously described her as one of three masters at directing child actors alongside Abbas Kiarostami and Kore-eda.\n\n\n\tDuring the session, Bong said the film qualified as a masterpiece after his second viewing. “There was so much to dig into in this film, and I even felt professional jealousy,” he said. He highlighted Yoon’s distinctive approach to storytelling, noting that she allows audiences to gradually understand the narrative through extended observation rather than direct explanation. He singled out the car wash sequence as particularly striking, calling it “the sequence of the year.” Bong jokingly referred to himself as the “Seoul Branch Chief of Director Yoon Ga-eun’s Fan Club.”\n\n\tOther industry figures have added their endorsements. Kim Jee-woon called it “this year’s best independent film,” praising Yoon’s perspective as warm and profound while declaring her the future of Korean cinema. Yeon Sang-ho described it as a masterpiece from a filmmaker who “walks to a different rhythm.”\n\t\n\n\tChinese director Jia Zhangke added: “As one of the very first audiences of the film, I would confidently recommend it.” Actor Kim Tae-ri said the film was extraordinary and hoped more audiences could experience it, while Park Jung-min remarked that “something incredible has been born.” Greta Lee simply called it “a perfect film.”\n\n\tThe title has gained traction on the festival circuit, collecting jury and audience awards at Pingyao International Film Festival’s Crouching Tigers section, along with the Fipresci Award at the Warsaw Film Festival. The film recently played at the Cork International Film Festival’s Momentum section.\n\n\tUpcoming festival appearances include competition slots at QCinema International Film Festival’s Asian Next Wave section, Festival des 3 Continents Nantes, Tokyo FILMeX, Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival and Red Sea International Film Festival. The film has also earned a nomination for Best Youth Film at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLionsgate U.K.’s “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” narrowly claimed the No. 1 position at the U.K. and Ireland box office, opening with £2,384,018 ($3,132,924), according to Comscore. \n\n\tParamount’s “The Running Man” was a whisker behind, also launching to £2,383,269 ($3,131,904), with very little separating the two debuts in what was effectively a photo finish at the top of the chart.\n\n\n\tDisney’s “Predator: Badlands” slid to third place but remained a solid draw, scaring up $1.2 million in its second frame for a running total of $5.6 million. New entry “Nuremberg,” from Studiocanal, arrived in fourth with $1.2 million, while Sony’s anime feature “Jujutsu Kaisen: Execution” rounded out the top five on $1.1 million, all of which counts as its cumulative gross.\n\t\n\n\tFurther down the chart, Sony’s“The Choral” ranked sixth, adding $800,000 in its second weekend to reach approximately $3.4 million. True Brit Entertainment’s “Christmas Karma” opened at No. 7 with $500,000. In eighth place, Paramount’s “Regretting You” collected $500,000, pushing its total to $7.8 million. Paramount’s family spin-off “A Paw Patrol Christmas” padded the No. 9 slot with $300,000 for a cumulative $700,000, while Universal’s sci-fi thriller “Bugonia” completed the top 10 with a shade under $300,000 lifting its total to $3.5 million.\n\n\tA varied slate rolls out across the U.K. and Ireland this week, beginning on Tuesday with “La Traviata – OperaGlass Works 2025,” distributed by 606 Distribution. The filmed staging adds another operatic entry to the year’s growing pipeline of event-cinema titles.\n\t\n\n\tOn Thursday, Dreamz Entertainment unveils Telugu-language film “Premante,” expanding the week’s South Asian representation before a crowded Friday corridor led by two major national releases. Universal Pictures launches “Wicked: For Good,” Jon M. Chu’s big-screen continuation of the “Wicked” franchise, featuring Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo, Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum. Positioned in more than 300 locations, it is one of the week’s widest openers. \n\n\tSony Pictures counters with “Sisu: Road to Revenge,” Jalmari Helander’s action-revenge thriller starring Jorma Tommila, Richard Brake and Stephen Lang. Also landing wide on Friday, the title rolls out in more than 300 sites.\n\n\tVue Lumière offers “The Thing With Feathers,” starring Benedict Cumberbatch, while BFI Distribution releases Lucile Hadžihalilović’s “The Ice Tower,” led by Marion Cotillard and Clara Pacini. MusicFilmNetwork presents the documentary “The Session Man – The Nicky Hopkins Story,” profiling the celebrated pianist through interviews with contributors including Keith Richards, Mick Jagger, Albert Lee and Pete Townshend.\n\n\tAdditional releases include the war epic “120 Bahadur” from Bakrania Media; Verve Pictures’ horror “Game”; the family-facing “CBeebies Panto 2025: Cinderella”; Altitude’s horror “The Carpenter’s Son,” headlined by Nicolas Cage; Zee Studios International’s raunchy comedy “Mastiii 4”; the Netflix’s “The Stringer: The Man Who Took the Photo” ; Miracle/Underground/Rocliffe’s “Testimony”; and Dreamz Entertainment’s “Eko.”\n\n\tThe week concludes on Saturday with another operatic event-cinema title, “Arabella – Met Opera 2025,” via Trafalgar Releasing.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe inaugural Doha Film Festival launches Thursday with the official Middle East premiere of Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania’s politically charged drama “The Voice of Hind Rajab” and a slew of regional premieres, including Steven Soderbergh’s black comedy “The Christophers” with the director and its star Michaela Coel on hand.\n\n\tRami Malek, who is the first actor of Egyptian heritage to win the best actor Oscar (for “Bohemian Rhapsody”), is also set to make the trek to the Qatari capital for the event, which aims to raise Qatar’s profile on the global film industry map.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s significant that Ben Hania’s moving drama – which tells the true story of a 5-year-old Palestinian girl who was stranded in a car that was attacked by Israeli forces in Gaza and later found dead – is launching into the region from Qatar, which has been a key mediator in cease-fire negotiations involving Israel and Hamas.\n\n\n\tEqually relevant is the fact that “The Voice of Hind Rajab” previously opened the first edition of the Gaza International Festival for Women’s Cinema held Oct. 26-31 amid the rubble in Deir Al-Balah — a Palestinian city roughly nine miles outside Gaza City in the heart of the Gaza strip, marking the film’s de facto Middle East premiere.\n\n\tBut the film’s real launch in the Arab world will be taking place in Doha.\n\n\t“I’m very happy that the movie is launching from Doha, who wanted the [regional] premiere,” Ben Hania told Variety, noting that when she told Doha organizers that the “pop up” Gaza fest wanted to show it first, “they immediately said: yes, sure.”\n\t\n\n\tOther films featuring Palestine at the new Doha fest –  which will run Nov. 20–28 – are competition entries “Once Upon a Time in Gaza,” directed by Palestinian directorial duo Tarzan and Arab Nasser, which world premiered in Cannes, and Kamal Aljafari’s doc “With Hasan in Gaza.”  \n\n\tStandout titles in the competition strand also include “The President’s Cake” from Iraqi filmmaker Hasan Hadi, about a young school girl chosen to bake a celebratory dessert in observation of Saddam Hussein’s birthday, which is representing Iraq at the Oscars; “Khartoum,” the potent doc about five residents forced to flee the Sudanese capital’s conflict that launched from Sundance; and Iranian director Ali Asgari’s dark comedy about Iranian film censorship, “Divine Comedy.”\n\n\t“The Christophers” will be among the Doha fest’s special screenings that also include Jim Sheridan’s courtroom drama “Re-Creation”; Andy Mundy-Castle’s doc “Shoot the People,” about Nigerian photographer and activist Misan Harriman; Yasser Ashour’s “My Story,” about the life and political journey of Syrian actor and activist Jamal Soliman – who will be honored during the festival’s opening ceremony. Then there is the world premiere of Qatari thriller “Sa3oud Wainah” by Mohammed Al-Ibrahim, produced by Katara Studios, which stands as testimony to Qatar’s moviemaking ambitions.\n\n\tBesides Soderbergh, Coel and Malek, other prominent names set to make the trek to the Qatari capital comprise Turkish TV talents Engin Altan Duzyatan (“Resurrection: Ertuğrul”) and Hazal Kaya (“Midnight at the Pera Palace”); Tunisian/Egyptian multi-hyphenate Dorra Zarrouk (“Walls,” “Zombie Goes Zombie”); and Palestinian stars Saleh Bakri and Hiam Abbass (“Succession”).\n\n\tThe new Doha Film Festival is run by the Doha Film Institute. It transforms the DFI’s existing Ajyal Film Festival, dedicated to youth and family-friendly cinema, into a more ambitious international event for a broader audience. The new fest has four competition strands: international feature film competition, short film competition, the Ajyal film competition (judged by the festival’s unique youth jury), and the Made in Qatar competition, dedicated to projects made in Qatar regardless of the director’s provenance.\n\t\n\n\tThe Doha Film Festival is being endowed with a total prize pot of over $300,000 that places it on a monetary par with Saudi Arabia’s more glitzy Red Sea Film festival in Jeddah.\n\n\tThe Nov. 20–28 event is the latest addition to an already crowded Arab film festival calendar during the Fall/Winter season. The Cairo fest runs Nov. 12-21, the Marrakech fest runs Nov. 28-Dec. 6 and Red Sea’s fifth edition is set for Dec. 4-13.\n\n\tJust as the tiny Arab state, rich in oil and gas, diversifies from the energy sector into cultural and media and entertainment — as attested by broadcaster Al Jazeera and the 2022 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament — the DFI has steadily grown into a crucial cornerstone of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region film industry.\n\n\t“As Qatar’s cultural presence expands and the regional film landscape matures, we saw an opportunity to elevate our festival offering. Doha Film Festival (DFF) builds on Ajyal’s success but introduces broader industry engagement, global programming and new pathways for cultural exchange,” DFI CEO Fatma Hassan Al Remaihi recently told Variety.\n\n\tThe Doha Film Festival does not have a structured market. The DFI already has a unique event called Qumra, an incubator and co-production market that helps foster first and second works, mostly by Arab directors. Qumra, which was conceived by the DFI following the failure of the Tribeca Doha Film Festival, which ran from 2009 until 2012, recently held its 11th edition. Qumra mentors this year included Johnnie To, Walter Salles and Darius Khondji.\n\n\tHowever the Doha fest does have an industry program presented by the Qatar Film Committee, an official body that is part of the Media City Qatar hub and is tasked with driving growth of the country’s entertainment industry. This program will include a series of panels held by, among others, former MSNBC broadcast journalist Mehdi Hassan, founder of media company Zeteo; Egyptian journalist and Palestinian rights advocate Rahma Zein; and Emmy-nominated journalist and Vice and HBO correspondent Ahmed Shihab-Eldin.\n\n\tIt will be interesting to see if and how this new festival will succeed in strengthening Qatar’s cultural soft power. \n",

    "body": "\n\tA coalition of 46 prominent Indian independent filmmakers has issued a joint statement demanding equitable theatrical opportunities for indie cinema, citing the restricted Indian release of Kanu Behl‘s Cannes-selected feature “Agra” as emblematic of systemic challenges facing the sector.\n\n\tThe appeal follows the Nov. 14 theatrical bow of “Agra,” which was relegated to limited and inconvenient showtimes despite strong audience interest and extensive media coverage. Signatories include Payal Kapadia, Rima Das, Nandita Das, Ajitpal Singh, Alankrita Shrivastava, Megha Ramaswamy, Raam Reddy, Ruchi Narain, Shaunak Sen, Shonali Bose, Varun Grover and Vasan Bala.\n\t\n\n\t“Update on ‘Agra’, the film: We’re being denied shows because of the so called ‘big blockbusters’ and because small films ‘don’t fit into’ multiplex chain programming. It’s up to you the audience now! Speak up and tag the chains. Say that you want to see the film!,” Behl had posted on the eve of the release. “Spread the word. Or this will just go on and on. And the space for anything else other than mindless ‘infantilised cinema’ will disappear.”The indie filmmakers’ statement emphasizes that the issue extends beyond a single release, noting that independent features across India routinely face barriers to theatrical exhibition. Key challenges identified include severely restricted screening slots, morning-only or weekday-exclusive showtimes, abrupt cancellations, opaque allocation processes and multiplex prioritization of big-budget releases.\n\n\n\tThe filmmakers also highlighted an emerging obstacle in the streaming sector, where platforms increasingly base acquisition decisions on box office performance, creating what they describe as an inequitable cycle that limits indie films’ theatrical exposure while simultaneously demanding commercial results.\n\n\tThe coalition outlined five specific requests: guaranteed accessible evening screenings for every independent release, transparent criteria for screen allocation, regular monthly or quarterly indie showcase programming, support from cultural institutions and alternative venues, and streaming acquisition policies independent of theatrical performance metrics.\n\t\n\n\tThe statement contextualizes these demands within Indian independent cinema’s international impact over the past decade, noting that films from the sector have premiered at major festivals including Cannes, Venice, Berlin, Sundance, Locarno, Rotterdam and Busan, expanding global perceptions of Indian storytelling.\n\n\t“We offer this statement with respect, seriousness and urgency,” the filmmakers wrote. “No antagonist. No blame. Only the collective need for a healthier ecosystem. Indian independent cinema has shaped how the world sees us. Now, we must shape a system where our own audiences can see us too.”\n\n\tThe complete list of signatories in alphabetical order: Aamir Bashir, Aditya Kripalani, Aditya Vikram Sengupta, Ajitpal Singh, Akshay Indikar, Alankrita Shrivastava, Anuparna Roy, Arati Kadav, Ashim Ahluwalia, Bauddhayan Mukherji, Bhaskar Hazarika, Chaitanya Tamhane, Devashish Makhija, Dibakar Das Roy, Diwa Shah, Dominic Megam Sangma, Gurvinder Singh, Haobam Paban Kumar, Hardik Mehta, Honey Trehan, Kanu Behl, Karan Gour, Karan Talwar, Karan Tejpal, Leena Yadav, Megha Ramaswamy, Nandita Das, Payal Kapadia, Pradip Kurbah, Prateek Vats, Q (Quashik Mukherjee), Raam Reddy, Rahat Mahajan, Rima Das, Ronny Sen, Ruchi Narain, Sumit Purohit, Safdar Rahman, Sarvnik Kaur, Shaunak Sen, Sharukhkhan Chavada, Shlok Sharma, Shonali Bose, Tanuja Chandra, Varun Grover and Vasan Bala.\n",

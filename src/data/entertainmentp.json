    "body": "\n\tNetflix viewers are about to be stirred and possibly even shaken as several James Bond titles are set to come to the streaming giant starting in January. It’s a surprising development considering Amazon MGM owns the James Bond library and the two are streaming competitors. \n\n\tStarting Jan. 15, Netflix subscribers in the U.S., German-speaking countries, France, Latin America and several other territories can watch the most recent Bond movie “No Time to Die” as well as “Die Another Day,” “Quantum of Solace” and “Skyfall” for a three-month period. Other Amazon-owned titles including select “Rocky” and “Creed,” and the “Legally Blonde” films will also stream on Netflix. \n\t\n\n\tAmazon’s original series “Hunters” is already available in the U.S. and several other territories, and “Man in the High Castle” and other series will also stream on Netflix.\n\n\n\tChris Ottinger, Head of Worldwide Distribution at Amazon MGM Studios, said, “When Amazon acquired MGM, Amazon’s plan was to continue licensing MGM’s iconic library to streaming and television partners around the world. Bringing these iconic films and shows to Netflix is part of that continued strategy. James Bond remains one of the most enduring and influential franchises in cinematic history, and alongside other beloved titles in our library like Hunters among other series, this agreement reflects the continued global appetite for premium storytelling and the strong working relationship we’ve built with Netflix.”\n\n\tThe Bond films typically stream on Prime Video for two months each year around Bond Day in October, and also play on MGM+ during the period from October through December. \n\t\n\n\tThe Netflix deal should help keep interest in the franchise alive as viewers wait for the 26th James Bond movie from director Denis Villeneuve. Although the director is already in place, the release date is likely to be several years in the future, possibly in 2028.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJake Paul knew the odds were against him in the bout against Anthony “AJ” Joshua, two-time unified heavyweight world champion and Olympic gold medalist. Paul, the YouTube creator who became a pro boxer, lasted six rounds before Joshua scored a knockout — and broke Paul’s jaw in two places.\n\n\tThe Paul-Joshua matchup was the main event Friday at Kaseya Center in Miami, Florida, with Netflix livestreaming the evening’s lineup of fights. In their fight, Joshua dropped Paul in the fourth, fifth and sixth rounds, ultimately sealing the victory with a sixth-round knockout at 1:31.\n\t\n\n\tIn a post on X after the fight, Paul wrote, “Jaw broken. Heart and balls in tact. Time to rest, recover and return to Cruiserweight.” He also posted an X-ray of his “double broken jaw” and added, “Give me Canelo in 10 days.”\n\n\n\n\tIn a post-fight press conference, Joshua said, “Jake [did] well while it lasted… I wish that I could have knocked him out at the start, but as we saw tonight, Jake has spirit. He has some heart. He tried his best, and I take my hat off to him because number one, a lot of fighters haven’t got in the ring with me, and Jake did. And secondly, even when he got knocked down, he kept on trying to get up, and I take my hat off to him. So, America, I think you have someone who could potentially, if he still has the heart for it, come back again, dust the dirt off his shoulder, and come again, and maybe sell out this center sometime in 2026.”\n\n\tAccording to fight promoter Most Valuable Promotions, the event set a new record as the highest-grossing boxing gate in history of the Kaseya Center. A replay of the Paul-Joshua fight, along with several undercard bouts, is currently available to stream on Netflix.\n\t\n\n\tThose in attendance at the fight included Netflix chief content officer Bela Bajaria, Rick Ross, Benny Safdie, Bert Kreischer, Dave Portnoy, Young Thug, Ryan Serhant, Trippie Red, Tekashi 69, Ty Dolla $ign, Timbaland, Matt Rife, Rory McIlroy, Brandon Marshall, Michael Irvin, Juan Soto, Kay Adams, Shaggy, Antonio Tarver, Rolando Romero, Paulie Malignaggi and MVP’s Shadasia Green, Lucas Bahdi and Wanna Walton.\n\n\tIn a surprise announcement before Paul and Joshua got into the ring, Dave Chappelle revealed that he was releasing a new stand-up special, “The Unstoppable,” on Netflix after the fight.\n\n\tPaul had originally been scheduled to take on boxer Gervonta “Tank” Davis in November, but that fight was canceled after Davis was sued in an alleged domestic violence incident.\n\n\tIn November 2024, Netflix streamed Paul’s record-breaking fight against Mike Tyson, which drew an estimated average minute audience (AMA) of 108 million live viewers globally. (Paul defeated Tyson in the eight-round bout by a unanimous decision.) The Paul-Tyson fight was the most-streamed sporting event to date, according to Netflix. “It’s a Super Bowl-like audience we were able to draw,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said at an investor conference after that event.\n\n\tFor Netflix — whose execs once dismissed the company’s entry into live sports — Jake vs. Joshua is part of a growing lineup of live events on the streamer. “WWE Raw” airs weekly on Netflix globally. Starting in 2026, it will carry a few select Major League Baseball games. And this month Netflix is again hosting an exclusive NFL doubleheader on Christmas Day, featuring the Dallas Cowboys vs. Washington Commanders and Detroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings. Earlier this week, Netflix announced that it hired former ESPN host Elle Duncan as its first on-air sports anchor. \n",

    "body": "\n\tDave Chappelle is delivering a holiday treat for standup fans by surprise dropping a new Netflix special called “The Unstoppable.”\n\n\tBefore the main event during the Dec. 18 Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua fight night, Chappelle stopped by the livestream with a short clip to announce the news.\n\n\t“I wanted to shout out my hometown, Washington, D.C., and thank everybody that came out in October to support me at that show,” Chappelle said in the video. “I just want you to know that show will be streaming on Netflix tonight after the fight. My new special drops, and I hope you love it. Thank you very much.”\n\t\n\n\tChappelle has had a long professional relationship with Netflix. This upcoming program will be his eighth standup special with the streamer, following “The Age of Spin,” “Deep in the Heart of Texas,” “Equanimity,” “The Bird Revelation,” “Sticks & Stones,” “The Closer” and “The Dreamer.” Netflix also released a recorded speech the comedian gave at his alma mater, the Duke Ellington High School of Arts, titled “What’s in a Name?”\n\n\n\tThe Paul vs. Joshua fight brought Netflix notables and other celebrities ringside in Miami, including Netflix chief content officer Bela Bajaria, director Benny Safdie, comedians Bert Kreischer and Matt Rife, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, singer Shaggy and more. In addition to the main event, earlier matches included Alycia Baumgardner defeating Leila Beaudoin, Anderson Silva defeating Tyron Woodley and Jahmal Harvey defeating Kevin Cervantes.\n\n\tAs for the fight itself? Joshua ended up the winner by knockout, with Paul lasting six rounds.\n",

    "body": "\n\tToho has revealed celebrations for the 10th anniversary of “My Hero Academia The Animation,” unveiling plans for a new episode, global concert tour and commemorative visual at Jump Festa.\n\n\tThe milestone anniversary arrives as the anime adaptation of Kohei Horikoshi’s manga reaches a significant chapter in its history. The series, which premiered in April 2016, aired its final episode on Dec. 13 following eight seasons and 170 episodes across a decade-long run.\n\t\n\n\tA brand-new episode titled “More” will premiere May 2, 2026, streaming exclusively on Crunchyroll worldwide outside Asia. The episode adapts content from the manga’s 431st chapter, which appeared exclusively in the final volume, following protagonist Deku and his classmates eight years after their graduation from U.A. High School. The episode expands the narrative beyond the anime’s original conclusion.\n\n\n\tThe series follows Izuku Midoriya, a boy born without superpowers in a world where 80% of the population possesses abilities called Quirks, as he trains at U.A. High School to become a professional hero. The story chronicles Midoriya and his classmates as they develop their abilities and navigate the challenges of hero society.\n\n\t“We are incredibly proud to celebrate ten years of ‘My Hero Academia’ with fans around the world,” a Toho spokesperson said. “This milestone represents not only a decade of unforgettable stories, heroic characters, and epic battles, but also the incredible support and passion of our global audience.”\n\n\tToho also unveiled “My Hero Academia in Concert,” a world tour featuring composer Yuki Hayashi’s music paired with scenes from the anime. The tour launches May 30, 2026, at Pacifico Yokohama before expanding internationally. \n\t\n\n\tAt Jump Festa, Toho debuted the official 10th anniversary logo and teaser visual. The anniversary visual, produced by Bones Films and illustrated by longtime character designer Yoshihiko Umakoshi, showcases 10 versions of Deku across his evolution as a hero. \n\n\tThe anniversary follows a landmark year for the franchise. Horikoshi’s manga, which has sold 100 million copies worldwide, concluded its serialization in Weekly Shonen Jump in August after a decade-long run. The anime adaptation includes four feature films alongside its television run.\n\n\tThe official anniversary celebration begins April 3, 2026, marking exactly 10 years since the anime’s first broadcast. Toho indicated that today’s announcements represent the initial wave of anniversary plans, with additional projects, collaborations and events to be revealed throughout 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThat’s a wrap on “Spider-Man” star Tom Holland for his latest outing as the web-slinging Marvel superhero.\n\n\t“Spider-Man: Brand New Day” director Destin Daniel Cretton announced Friday that filming has wrapped on the fourth of Holland’s solo movies, thanking the star for his “kind, generous leadership on and off screen, for your relentless work ethic, your fearless performances, and for your friendship.” \n\n\n\tIn “Brand New Day,” Holland returns as Peter Parker after the kid from Queens accidentally broke open the multiverse in 2021’s “No Way Home,” and is forced to make the difficult decision to make the entire world, including his closest friends MJ and Ned (Zendaya and Jacob Batalon), forget his identity. The Sony/Marvel movie also features Mark Ruffalo (as original Avenger Bruce Banner aka the Hulk), Jon Bernthal (Frank Castle/the Punisher), “Severance” standout Tramell Tillman, “The Bear’s” Liza Colon-Zayas, Michael Mando (Scorpion), Marvin Joness III (Tombstone) and Sadie Sink (playing an undisclosed, but much-discussed role). \n\t\n\n\t“I’m so deeply grateful for the people who walked with me through the biggest, most rewarding film I’ve ever been a part of,” Cretton wrote on Instagram. “To our amazing cast, for breathing so much life into these beloved characters and moving us every day. To our unbelievable crew, who worked tirelessly with unmatched creativity and craftsmanship, who made me laugh so hard my stomach never stopped hurting. I love you all so much and can’t wait for the world to see your stunning work on the big screen.”\n\n\tOn a more personal note, Cretton also thanked his wife, fashion designer Nikki Chapman, “for laughing through the insanity and carrying our entire family on your back” and his kids “for forcing me to put my phone down and get out of my head long enough to build a fort in the living room with couch cushions.” \n\t\n\n\t“Brand New Day,” which swings into theaters on July 31, is Cretton’s second MCU movie, following 2021’s “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.” He was previously set to direct the now-scrapped “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty,” but departed the project in November 2023. Cretton is also the co-creator and one of the directors of the upcoming “Wonder Man” series. The Disney+ show, starring Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, begins streaming on Jan. 27.\n\n\t“Captain Marvel” star Brie Larson, who starred in Cretton’s acclaimed 2013 indie “Short Term 12,” was among the many commenters to salute the filmmaker on a job well done, writing, “Congrats!!!! Love you bro!” and “Hugs to my spidey too!!!”\n\n\tThe “Brand New Day” update comes as the first teaser for the next “Avengers: Doomsday” debuted in theaters ahead of “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” The clip for the movie, out next December, reveals the return of Chris Evans as Steve Rogers. Anticipation for the new Spider-Man movie is high, as each of Holland’s outings has been more successful at the box office than the last. “Spider-Man: Homecoming” grossed $880 million in 2017; then, in 2019, “Far From Home” generated $1.13 billion. 2021’s “No Way Home,” which featured previous Spider-Men Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, became the first post-pandemic blockbuster, with a global box office haul of $1.9 billion.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Last Frontier” has been canceled after one season at Apple TV.\n\n\tThe thriller series stared Jason Clarke as Frank Remnick, who is described as “the lone U.S. marshal in charge of the quiet, rugged barrens of Alaska. Remnick’s jurisdiction is turned upside down when a prison transport plane crashes in the remote wilderness, setting free dozens of violent inmates. Tasked with protecting the town he’s vowed to keep safe, he begins to suspect the crash wasn’t an accident, but the first step of a well-crafted plan with far-reaching and devastating implications.”\n\t\n\n\tAlong with Clarke, “The Last Frontier” starred Dominic Cooper, Haley Bennett, Simone Kessell, Dallas Goldtooth, Tait Blum and Alfre Woodard. Jon Bokenkamp and Richard D’Ovidio created the series and served as executive producers along with Clarke, Laura Benson, Glenn Kessler, Albert Kim and director Sam Hargrave.\n\n\n\t“The Last Frontier” received mixed reviews from critics, achieving a 46% on Rotten Tomatoes. Variety‘s review said that after “an entertaining bait-and-switch” in the first episode, the show “gets bogged down in a serialized plot that’s more convoluted and generic than the simple pleasures of maniacs running amok and small-town cops chasing them down.”\n\n\t“The Last Frontier” premiered on Oct. 10, with the Season 1 finale coming on Dec. 5. In an interview with Variety after the finale, Bokenkamp and D’Ovidio said they were already discusing ideas for a potential second season, including a change of location. “I think that we’ve discussed many avenues to take with the second season, but we’ve pretty much exhausted a lot of stories in Alaska,” D’Ovidio said, with Bokenkamp adding, “We’ve certainly talked a lot about where they end up, maybe a beach somewhere. But it also occurs to me that the U.S. Marshals hunt bad guys around the world. Sidney [Bennett] and Havlock [Cooper] represent a problem to Frank, but that doesn’t mean they are his only problem.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBlake Lively‘s lawyers filed a motion for sanctions Friday against attorneys for Justin Baldoni, accusing them of laughing, speechifying and engaging in other disruptive behavior during depositions.\n\n\tHer lawyers have also complained about questions regarding Lively’s romantic and sexual history, which they argue are irrelevant to her harassment and retaliation lawsuit against Baldoni and others involved in “It Ends With Us.” \n\n\n\t“Ms. Lively’s sexual and/or romantic history has no bearing on the matters at issue in this case and we will not tolerate such examination,” her lawyers wrote to Baldoni’s lawyers, including Bryan Freedman, in September.\n\t\n\n\tLively’s side invoked the “rape shield law,” which protects victims of sexual assault from questions about their sexual history.\n\n\tThe last straw apparently came on Monday, when, according to Lively’s side, Freedman and co-counsel Kevin Fritz impeded and delayed the deposition of Nicole Alexander, who is testifying as a defense expert.\n\n\tLively’s side accused Freedman and Fritz of an “ongoing pattern of deposition misconduct,” including chewing up time by making lengthy objections.\n\n\tLively’s lawyers have filed motions for sanctions several times already in the highly contentious case. In one such instance, they accused Freedman of trying the case in the media. In another, they accused Baldoni’s lawyers of improperly withholding evidence during discovery.\n\n\tThe parties have a court-mandated settlement conference scheduled for Feb. 11. The trial, originally set to begin in March, was postponed earlier this month to May 18.\n\t\n\n\tBaldoni’s team has filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that her allegations amount to nothing more than a “litany of minor grievances” and the case should be thrown out. Lively’s side responded that her director and co-star is seeking to avoid accountability for creating a hostile environment on set. \n\n\tJudge Lewis Liman is expected to hear argument on the summary judgment motion and on one of the sanction’s motions on Jan. 22.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains major spoilers for plot points in “The Housemaid,” now in theaters.\n\n\tFor fans of Freida McFadden’s thriller no",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains major spoilers for plot points in “The Housemaid,” now in theaters.\n\n\tFor fans of Freida McFadden’s thriller novel “The Housemaid,” watching the Lionsgate adaptation movie was a bit of a different experience — we went in knowing the twist. While most of the largest moments in the book were represented in the movie, not everything weas the same. In fact, one storyline was much smaller in the film than in the book.\n\t\n\n\t“The Housemaid” follows a young woman, Millie (Sydney Sweeney), who has a dark past and is desperate for work; she excitedly accepts the job as a live-in housemaid for a wealthy family, Nina and Andrew Winchester (Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar). Soon, she finds out their seemingly perfect life is far from it.\n\n\n\tThe book is split into two perspectives — first, Millie’s, then Nina’s. From Millie’s POV, Nina is the villain, a mentally unstable, harsh wife and mother while Andrew does everything to keep her happy. From the community, Millie hears that Nina tried to take her own life after leaving her daughter to die in the bathtub. Luckily, doting husband Andrew called the police just in time and Nina was hospitalized. He’s the man who chose to stay with her and take care of her.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrandon Sklenar as Andrew Winchester and Amanda Seyfried as Nina Winchester \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel McFadden/Lionsgate\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe second half of the book and movie, Nina’s POV reveals what actually happened: Shortly after marrying Andrew, he began abusing her and locking her in the attic without food, torturing her. He once drugged her and she woke up in the bathroom only to discover her daughter in the bathtub — and the police taking her away. From then on, he continued to punish her and threatened to get her taken away again if she didn’t stay. She decided to hire Millie so that she could escape — she knew he’d cheat — but also because of Millie’s past. Millie spent 10 years in prison for murdering a man who assaulted a friend — so she could take him down.\n\t\n\n\tBelow, Variety breaks down some of the biggest changes from the book and the movie — including that ending.\n\n\tAndrew’s torture of Millie\n\n\tIn both the movie and the book, Millie starts to put together what has happened after Andrew locks her in the attic, beginning to torment her. But in the book, he makes Millie painfully balance three large books on her stomach for hours. He has installed a camera to watch and when she doesn’t do it correctly the first time, he makes her do it again.\n\n\tIn the movie, the scene is more violent. Since she’s been locked in the attic for accidentally breaking antique dishes, he orders her to, using a piece of the plate, slice 21 deep cuts into her stomach.\n\n\tMillie’s torture of Andrew\n\n\tIn the book, Millie then taunts Andrew and gives him a taste of his own medicide, asking him to balance the same three books on his groin, then instructs him to pull out his teeth with pliers.\n\n\tIn the movie, after being let out, Millie uses the knife Nina has hidden inside to slit Andrew’s throat and lock him inside the room. As he bleeds out, she breaks more of his mother’s china in front of the door and instructs him to pull out his front tooth since he’s convinced too many people he’s a good person with this perfect smile.\n\n\tAndrew’s death\n\n\tIn the book, the gardener, Enzo (who knew what happened to Nina, and stayed on the grounds to try and help), convinced Nina to go back to the house to save Millie. When she does, she finds Andrew in the attic, dead of starvation.\n\n\tThe movie gets a bit darker; Nina’s daughter is the one to convince her to go back and help Millie, but when she returns to the attic, she opens the door assuming Millie is locked inside. Instead, Andrew is alive and charges out, trying to attack both Nina and Millie; eventually, he begs Nina to give him another chance, giving her the opportunity to tell him how awful he is. Ultimately, Millie shoves him over their spiral staircase where he falls to his violent death.\n\n\tThe end\n\n\tA policeman questions Nina in the book, revealing that his daughter was once involved with Andrew. In the movie, it’s a policewoman who does the interrogating before sharing that her sister was in a relationship with him. Since they both knew the harm he caused, they believe that his death was an accident. \n\t\n\n\tAt the end of the book Millie teams up with Enzo to form a group to help women in abusive relationships. That doesn’t exist in the movie but the flash forward to one year later is the same: she’s interviewing for a new position at the home of  woman who’s being abused and got her name from Nina. Has she been hired to kill him? Possibly. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichele Morrone as Enzo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel McFadden/Lionsgate\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEnzo’s patricipation\n\n\tOverall, it’s important to note that in the book, the family groundskeeper Enzo is a much larger part of the story, trying to help Nina escape multiple times and eventually, helping her come up with the plan to hire a new woman to draw Andrew’s attention away. Millie once makes a move on him, knowing that it’d be smarter than going after Andrew, a married man. He turns her down.\n\n\tAfter she did escape, Nina and Enzo spends a night together. Eventually, he tells her it’s not right to leave Millie in danger with Andrew. Later, he calls to alert her the attic light on is on and Millie hasn’t been seen in days, encouraging Nina to come check on her. She agrees to do so as long as he’ll protect her daughter; he does just that.\n\n\tIn the movie, the character, portrayed by Michele Morrone, was barely part of the story. It’s made clear, eventually, that he did help Nina try to escape but he’s more of a background character than a key part of the film.\n\n\tIf more movies come out, and they stay close to the story told in the books, Enzo will be back — and not in a small way.\n",

    "description": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains major spoilers for “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\tDirector James Cameron is back with bigg",
    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains major spoilers for “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\tDirector James Cameron is back with biggest and longest “Avatar” movie yet, “Fire and Ash.” Taking place shortly after the events of 2022’s “The Way of Water,” “Fire and Ash” ups the stakes even further, bring massive battles between the Na’vi and humans, and introduces the series’ scariest villain yet.\n\n\tJust like “The Way of Water” introduced the aquatic Metkayina clan, who became allies with Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his family, “Fire and Ash” debuts the evil Mangkwan tribe, led by the mystical Varang (Oona Chaplin). The Mangkwan live in a dormant volcano and raid the other Na’vi groups on Pandora, which is how they first run afoul of the Sullys. \n\n\tSoon, the Mangkwan ally themselves with Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who still has a bone to pick with Jake, and trade in their spears and arrows for guns and flamethrowers. Varang grows close with Quaritch and joins her fiery Mangkwan forces with the human RDA army, who captures Jake. \n\n\tAfter escaping, Jake bands together the Na’vi forces to battle the Mangkwan and RDA, but the bad guys are nearly too powerful and kill many of the Sullys’ allies. In the nick of time, the whale-like Tulkun aid the heroes, and Jake’s adopted daughter Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) connects with the spiritual deity Eywa and rallies the animals of Pandora to their cause. Jake’s family saves the day and defeats Quaritch, Varang and the RDA…for now.\n\n\tCameron has long spoken about his plans to make “Avatar 4” and “Avatar 5,” which have release dates set for 2029 and 2031, respectively. The director has said he’s already shot some footage for a fourth movie, but Disney greenlighting it will depend on how well “Fire and Ash” is received. The two previous “Avatar” movies each grossed more than $2 billion at the worldwide box office, so expectations for “Fire and Ash” are high. \n\n\tJust like “The Way of Water” and “Fire and Ash,” the next sequels would jump ahead in time to account for the young actors’ aging, Cameron has revealed. “Fire and Ash” also briefly introduces a new, airborne group of Na’vi called the Wind Traders, who would play a role in the fourth and fifth movies. They’re led by Peylak (played by “Harry Potter” alum David Thewlis), who shelters the Sully family before they’re attacked by the Mangkwan raiders.\n\n\tSee who else may reappear in future “Avatar” sequels, and who fans said goodbye to in “Fire and Ash” below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tQuaritch: Dead or Alive?\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tQuaritch and Jake Sully are forced to partner up but also face off multiple times in “Fire and Ash.” In the climactic battle, the two fight in the midst of a gravity well that sends rocks hurtling through the air. The two briefly put aside their differences and save Spider, Quaritch’s human son raised by Jake, who nearly falls to his death. Just when it seems like Quaritch and Jake have made amends, Neytiri joins them with her bow pointed at Quaritch, and he throws himself to the fires below. We don’t see Quaritch fall to his death, only disappear into the plumes of smoke. So, it’s possible that he survives and could reappear in “Avatar 4,” but would he ally himself with Varang once again or finally switch sides and be Team Sully?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tVarang: Missing\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tVarang, the newest villain in the “Avatar” franchise, goes missing after she leads her fiery Mangkwan forces along with the RDA against the Sully family and their own army. She flees the battle after Kiri connects with the mystical Eywa and summons more animal allies to turn the tide of the fight. Currently missing, Varang is too compelling of an antagonist to not bring back for “Avatar 4.” There are also fan theories that she and Quaritch could reunite, or possibly start their own family to take on the Sullys in a sequel.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRonal: Dead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tKate Winslet’s Metkayina mother dies during the final battle against the Mangkwan and RDA. However, she’s able to give birth in her final moments with the help of Neytiri, who promises to raise the newborn girl as one of her own. If there is an “Avatar 4,” surely the Sully family’s latest addition would have to factor into the plot, with Neytiri, Jake and their children raising a young kid in the dangerous world of Pandora.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRotxo: Dead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tRotxo is one of the divers of the Metkayina and a friend of the Sully children and Ronal’s son, Ao’nung. He dies during the final battle against the Mangkwan and RDA.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tScoresby: Dead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCaptain Mick Scoresby returns after his debut in “The Way of Water,” this time rocking a robotic arm after losing the limb in the last movie. The deep-sea fisherman hunts the Tulkun and harvests the valuable substance Amrita found inside of them, which can stop humans from aging. However, Scoresby meets his match in “Fire and Ash” and is swallowed by a Tulkun out of revenge during the final battle.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

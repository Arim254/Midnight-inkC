    "body": "\n\tEmma Stone is looking to break some Oscar records.\n\n\tThe two-time best actress winner could etch her name even deeper into Academy Awards history if she receives double nominations for Focus Features’ “Bugonia” when Oscar nods are announced on Jan. 22.\n\n\tA double bid — for best actress and as a producer in the best picture category — would place Stone, 37, in extraordinarily rare company. She would become the second-youngest person in Oscar history to reach seven career nominations, trailing only Walt Disney, who achieved the milestone at age 34 in 1936.\n\t\n\n\tThe honor would also allow Stone to surpass Meryl Streep as the youngest woman ever to earn seven nominations (in any categories). Streep received her seventh nod for “Ironweed” when nominations were announced on Feb. 16, 1988. She was 38 at the time.\n\n\n\tBeyond the raw numbers, a dual citation would also carry historic weight. Stone would become the first woman ever to be nominated twice in the combined categories of best actress and picture. She previously accomplished the feat with “Poor Things” (2023), winning her second Oscar for best actress for her portrayal of Bella Baxter while also earning a best picture nomination as a producer.\n\n\tFrances McDormand remains the only other woman to achieve the dual nomination, sweeping both categories for “Nomadland” (2020).\n\n\tActresses being nominated as producers of films in which they also star remains an anomaly in Oscar history, particularly when compared with their male counterparts. For example, stars like Clint Eastwood, Warren Beatty and Bradley Cooper have done it multiple times each. Outside of Stone and McDormand, the list of actresses is strikingly short.\n\t\n\n\tBarbra Streisand earned a best picture nom as a producer for “The Prince of Tides” (1991), in which she also starred but failed to receive a best actress nomination. It was a similar fate for Margot Robbie when she was nominated as a producer for “Barbie” (2023) while starring in the film, and then notably snubbed in the best actress race despite the movie’s cultural impact and box office dominance. Oprah Winfrey became the first Black female producer nominated for best picture for “Selma” (2014), appearing in a supporting role as civil rights activist Annie Lee Cooper.\n\n\tBorn Nov. 6, 1988, Stone has built one of the most formidable Academy Awards résumés of her generation. Her first nomination came in 2015 for best supporting actress for “Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance).” Two years later, she won her first Oscar, claiming best actress for the musical “La La Land” (2016). Stone earned another supporting actress nom for her first collaboration with director Yorgos Lanthimos on “The Favourite” (2018) before her landmark year with “Poor Things,” which brought both her second best actress win and a best picture nomination as a producer.\n\n\tThe all-time record she would be chasing has stood for nearly a century. Born Dec. 5, 1901, Disney received his first two nominations on Oct. 12, 1932, for the fifth Academy Awards, competing in best short subject (cartoon) for “Mickey’s Orphans” and the winning “Flowers and Trees” at age 30.\n\n\tHis seventh nomination came in 1936, via another pair of bids in the same category for “Who Killed Cock Robin?” and the winning “Three Orphan Kittens,” cementing his place in Oscar lore at just 34 years old.\n\n\tSo far this Oscar season, Emma Stone has received double bids at the Critics Choice and Golden Globe Awards for the Focus Features black comedy that also stars Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis. The actress race is competitive with many prognasticators viewing only two sure bets at the moment: Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”) and Renate Reinsve (“Sentimental Value”). The other spots are up for grabs between Stone, Rose Byrne (“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”), Cynthia Erivo (“Wicked: For Good”), Chase Infiniti (“One Battle After Another”) and more.\n\n\t“Bugonia” premiered at the Venice Film Festival before making its debut stateside at the Telluride Film Festival, receiving critical acclaim. Along with Stone, the film is also produced by Lanthimos, Ari Aster, Ed Guiney, Lars Knudsen, Jerry Kyoungboum Ko, Miky Lee and Andrew Lowe. However, official PGA credits were given to Guiney, Knudsen, Lanthimos, Lowe and Stone, which the Academy typically recognize for nominations. The official receivers of the noms won’t be revealed until nominations morning.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn its first released footage, Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey” promises to be the director’s most expansive vision yet.\n\n\tA six-minute clip from the film is playing before this weekend’s Imax 70-millimeter screenings of “Sinners” and “One Battle After Another.” The clip depicts the story of the Trojan horse — ironically, not a major plot element in Homer’s Odyssey, though part of the mythology around Odysseus in general. For those unfamiliar, the story is one of warrior Odysseus’ canniest strategems: He ordered built an enormous, hollow horse that could be occupied by soldiers. If the Trojans accepted it as a seeming peace offering, the men within could breach the impenetrable walls of Troy and wage war from the inside.\n\t\n\n\tAll of which, it seems, will be explained onscreen. As the clip begins, Jon Bernthal’s Menelaus, king of Sparta, asks Tom Holland’s Telemachus, son of Odysseus, “Did you hear the story of the horse?” Telemachus indicates that he has. \n\n\n\t“Did you hear it from the inside?” Bernthal says. And then we’re off: Matt Damon’s Odysseus, Bernthal, and many others are shown huddling within a giant wooden horse that has landed ashore in Troy. The Trojans are shown cheering with delight as Odysseus listens incredulously — then, soon enough, he and his men are being jostled as the horse is brought onto land and are forced to dodge swords being plunged into the horse, seemingly to test for hidden Greeks within. \n\n\tTime passes, and the horse sits triumphantly at the steps of a massive building within the walled city of Troy. Appearing nervous in close-up, Damon commits to action; in a cut to a view of the horse from the outside, we see Damon drop a rope to climb down and silently attack an unsuspecting sentry. A dialogue-free assault ensues, with the Trojans sounding an alarm. A high volume of faceless guards stream out and attack the Greeks; Odysseus is shooting their men with arrows, but the real hope for his men lies in a ploy to which we cut repeatedly amidst the action. As the melee continues, the Greeks are effortfully turning the gears that will open the gates of Troy.\n\t\n\n\tNo student of classics — or fan of movies — will be surprised that they succeed. And as the gates open, a mass of Greek soldiers stream in. Odysseus’ men have been fighting with only the clothes they wore in the horse: These additional soldiers, though, are fully armed, and Menelaus raises his arms in triumph as he’s handed a helmet to wear. Odysseus bellows in triumph. Brief flashing images of men in full suits of armor, a cryptic monster, and a head being lopped off of a marble sculpture hint at the massive scope of the film before the footage ends. (Notably, cast members including Anne Hathaway, Charlize Theron, Zendaya, and Robert Pattinson aren’t shown.)\n\n\tWhile what we see plays like a grand-scale epic, Nolan hasn’t lost his touch with delicately intercutting between various developments — the chaos of the warfare against the precision of the gears gradually turning in the Trojan wall’s door — or for granular character detail in the midst of the spectacle. One might say the carefully wrought story within the massive drama is some kind of, well, Trojan horse. \n\n\tAnd the particular aspect of how the footage first finds audiences, attached to two Imax rereleases from Warner Bros., provides no small measure of poetic justice for Nolan. Having bolted the studio for Universal to make “Oppenheimer” and then “The Odyssey,” promo for his new film is being used to induce people to come see WB’s 2025 offerings.\n\n\t“The Odyssey” is to be released July 17. 2026. \n",

    "body": "\n\tRound one, fight!\n\n\tIt seems like there’s a face-off brewing between next year’s “Street Fighter” and “Mortal Kombat 2″ movies, live-action adaptations of two of the most popular and long-running fighting game franchises. “Street Fighter” star and provocative comedian Andrew Schulz threw the first punch in the video game beef Thursday night when his movie’s cast came out on stage to debut their first trailer at the Game Awards.\n\n\n\tSchulz plays Dan Hibiki, a jokey, annoying character in the “Street Fighter” games who’s overconfident and underpowered. He walked out on the Game Awards stage with his co-stars Noah Centineo (Ken), Andrew Koji (Ryu), Callina Liang (Chun-Li), Jason Momoa (Blanka), Roman Reigns (Akuma), David Dastmalchian (M. Bison), Cody Rhodes (Guile), Vidyut Jammwal (Dhalsim), Orville Peck (Vega), Olivier Richters (Zangief), Rayna Vallandingham (Juli) and Mel Jarnson (Cammy).\n\t\n\n\tAs his co-stars talked about their love of “Street Fighter” and teased their fight scenes, Schulz took the mic from Dastmalchian and joked that the “Mortal Kombat 2” cast didn’t fly out to the Game Awards because “they only care about money” and not the fans — while the “Street Fighter” stars care about money and the gamers.\n\n\t“Guys, it’s so important that we appreciate you all here for being great patrons of ‘Street Fighter.’ If you played the game in your life, make some noise,” Schulz said to large applause from the crowd. “This movie is not possible without you guys. We are so grateful. And we’re not the only game that appreciates your patronage. There’s another game out there. They also flew from around the world to be here because they appreciate you. So give it up for the whole cast of ‘Mortal Kombat 2’!”\n\t\n\n\tThe crowd gave another round of applause, while Centineo and Momoa hyped up the fans, only for Schulz to reveal he was joking and the “Mortal Kombat” cast wasn’t there.\n\n\t“I’m just kidding, I’m just kidding. They don’t care about you. They only care about money,” he said, as the crowd groaned. “We care about money and you. ‘Street Fighter’ forever!”\n\n\t“Schulz cannot be trusted,” Liang laughed. “He’s joking.” Koji and Centineo proceeded to announce the best ongoing game category, revealing the winner to be “No Many’s Sky” with the entire cast.\n\n\tThe moment played as a joke, but it may have ruffled the feathers of “Mortal Kombat” producer Todd Garner, who worked on the original 2021 movie and its 2026 sequel. Replying to a video of Schulz, Garner wrote “I don’t climb over others to get ahead” on X.\n\nI don’t climb over others to get ahead.— Todd Garner (@Todd_Garner) December 12, 2025\n\n\n\tGarner added in another post, “I hope both are huge,” referring to “Street Fighter” and “Mortal Kombat 2.” He replied to a fan, who said “the hype for MK2 is no where near ‘Street Fighter,'” that “it will be.”\n\n\n\tWarner Bros.’ “Mortal Kombat 2” was originally set to release on Oct. 24, but then was delayed to May 8, 2026. The cast is equally packed with fan-favorite characters, including Karl Urban (Johnny Cage), Adeline Rudolph (Kitana), Tati Gabrielle (Jade), Hiroyuki Sanada (Scorpion), Joe Taslim (Sub-Zero/Noob Saibot), Ludi Lin (Liu Kang), Jessica McNamee (Sonya Blade), Josh Lawson (Kano), Mehcad Brooks (Jax), Damon Herriman (Quan-Chi), Chin Hang (Shang Tsung) and Tadanobu Asono (Raiden). Paramount’s “Street Fighter” hits theaters on Oct. 16, 2026, so the two movies won’t duke it out directly at the box office, but gamers will likely choose their favorites of the two beat-’em-up games.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAndy Serkis‘ all-star animated adaptation of George Orwell’s classic allegorical novella has been acquired for U.S theatrical rights by Angel. \n\n\tWith a voice cast including Seth Rogen, Glenn Close, Woody Harrelson, Kieran Culkin and more, the film was produced by Adam Nagle and Dave Rosenbaum for Aniventure, and Jonathan Cavendish for Imaginarium Productions, with animation from Cinesite. It’s now scheduled for a wide theatrical release on May 1, 2026 through Utah-based Angel (which changed its name from Angel Studios in September 2025 after going public). \n\t\n\n\tAcclaimed actor and director Serkis shepherded “Animal Farm” to life with a screenplay by Nicholas Stoller. The film premiered at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival earlier this year.\n\n\n\t“Orwell’s Animal Farm has never felt more relevant,” said Serkis. “In an age where power, propaganda, and inequality shape our societies, it’s vital that we remember his cautionary tale. This adaptation isn’t just a story for entertainment — it’s a reminder that democracy, freedom, and integrity are fragile, and must be watched over.” \n\n\tHe added: “My hope is that audiences walk away moved, thoughtful, and inspired to stand up for the values that matter. I’m honored that Angel and the Angel Guild are willing to bring this film to big screens around the world.”\n\n\tThe voice cast includes Rogan as Napoleon, Close as Freida Pilkington, Harrelson as Boxer and Culkin stars as Squealer. Meanwhile, there’s Gaten Matarazzo as Lucky, Laverne Cox as Snowball, Jim Parsons as Carl, Kathleen Turner as Benjamin and Iman Vellani as piglets Puff and Tammy. Serkis himself voices Mr. Jones and Randolph the Rooster.\n\t\n\n\t“This is a project of tremendous heart,” said Brandon Purdie, executive vice president of theatrical and brand development at Angel. “Andy Serkis’ visionary direction, combined with this powerhouse cast, creates a film that feels timely, urgent, and deeply human — even though the protagonists might be pigs, donkeys, and horses. We’re confident that moviegoers will see not just a story of farm animals, but a mirror held up to our world today.”\n\n\tAdded Adam Nagle, CEO of Aniventure: “We are thrilled to partner with Angel Studios, as their unique connection with audiences, amplified by an exceptional marketing team, ensures this story will get in front of as many people as possible. We are incredibly proud of this adaptation we have made and can’t wait for everyone to see it .”\n\n\tSee the first trailer to “Animal Farm” below\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor Stellan Skarsgård, art is imitating life this fall in one sense: In “Sentimental Value,” he plays a well-known artist with actor children. The difference may be in, well, sentiment — the real-life Stellan Skarsgård has an affectionate bond with his son, Alexander (one of several Skarsgård offspring to work as actors), while Gustav Borg, the character he plays onscreen, is far more closed-off. It’s a triumphant return to the screen for the actor, who suffered a stroke in 2022. Stellan and Alexander Skarsgård affectionately rib one another at only the latest of their awards-season stops together, as Alexander promotes his own knotty and complex film, “Pillion,” in which he plays the forbidding, unknowable top in a gay BDSM relationship.\n\t\n\n\tStellan Skarsgård: When did you first want to be an actor? Did you want to be an actor? The first film you did, you were seven or something, right?\n\n\n\tAlexander Skarsgård: Allan Edwall, the iconic Swedish actor-director, was over at our place. You guys were drinking wine. He was going to direct a film, and he needed a seven-year-old kid. I happened to be around and I happened to be seven, so he probably just asked you. Straight-up nepotism: That’s how I booked the job. I don’t even think I auditioned for it. He cast me as the lead of the movie — it’s about a bourgeoise family in the ‘30s, and it’s quite an affluent neighborhood, but his friend is from a poor part of town and ends up dying in the movie. I was cast as a lead, and then Allan found another guy who looked way more bourgeoise.\n\n\tStellan: You weren’t bourgeoise enough.\n\t\n\n\tAlexander: Well, I was very skinny and looked malnourished. It made sense that I would be the dying buddy, rather than the lead.\n\n\tI didn’t answer your question. I didn’t want to be an actor. Your question was when did I know?\n\n\tStellan: Maybe you don’t know even now.\n\n\tAlexander: I’m still trying to figure it out, what do I do when I grow up.\n\n\tStellan: That’s something you’ve got to wait until you’re mature enough to make a decision about, isn’t it?\n\n\tAlexander: Have you landed comfortably in the decision?\n\n\tStellan: As long as I make a lot of money and have fun with this, I will do this until I know what I will do.\n\n\tAlexander: You still want to be a firefighter? Never give up on your dreams, Dad.\n\n\tStellan: You were playing consumption very well. You really looked dying. The smaller role that you did was a much better role, don’t you agree? You got to die!\n\n\tAlexander: It was a very juicy part. But I did not walk away from that production thinking, “This is what I do for the rest of my life.” I remember craft services was great. I got free Cinnabons, which was exciting. But that was the main thing I took away from that experience.\n\n\tStellan: It’s about the same time you told me, “Why can’t you have a normal job and work with data and drive a Saab, like everybody else does?”\n\n\tAlexander: And wear a suit, goddamit, instead of your weird hippie sarongs or nothing. My dream was for my family to be normal and fit in and be like everybody else’s family. For you to have a briefcase, that would’ve been fantastic, rather than a weird tote bag that you found in India. Most people in our family are artists — a lot of eccentric, big personalities that I loved. But the early teens, bringing friends over was always like, “Oh, God,” because I wanted it to be like everyone else’s household. I was very adamant — I was going to be in a cubicle, drive a Saab, and have that beautiful briefcase.\n\n\tStellan: You did some TV series when you were in the early teens, right? And that was a disaster because you got too popular.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAlexander: I did a television film when I was 13. It got a little bit of attention — enough to make me freak out. Not that I had pursued acting up until that point, but after that, I was like, I don’t want to do this at all. I didn’t act for another eight years.\n\t\n\n\tStellan: If you work with data, you can afford to buy your own Cinnabons.\n\n\tAlexander: That was what I pursued after that. But I failed.\n\n\tStellan: You failed trying to have a normal life?\n\n\tAlexander: I think I did. Clearly, we’re sitting here with no briefcase.\n\n\tStellan: You went into the military — did you do that in opposition to me, to provoke me?\n\n\tAlexander: Looking back, I don’t think it was an act of rebellion against you. But coming from a bohemian family, I was like, I want to find my own path. The most extreme contrast would be to go into the military. So it wasn’t a conscious “Fuck you, Dad” thing.\n\n\tStellan: I felt fucked.\n\n\tAlexander: You’re a tremendous actor, Father, because I never felt that.\n\n\tStellan: I am not the kind of father who says, “No, you shouldn’t do that.” I don’t interfere with your decisions. But being a military evader like me, it felt like, “Oh, wow.” I also knew that all you eight kids have different ways of approaching everything. Maybe I’m lazy, but I think it’s best to let you do it on your own.\n\n\tAlexander: How did you get out of the military? When I joined, it was semi-mandatory. But when you were a teenager, it was mandatory.\n\n\tStellan: I went to a friend who worked at a drug rehabilitation institution. And I made him write a letter to the draft board saying, “If you feel that Skarsgård is fit for military service, keep him under special surveillance because he might influence other kids. He smokes hashish.” Four hours later, I got a message from the draft: “Don’t come here. Don’t go near us.”\n\n\tAlexander: You were pursuing acting at that point.\n\n\tStellan: I was working as an actor in the theater. I quit school when I was 17 because I got a theater offer in another town.\n\n\tAlexander: Are you ever going to be on stage again?\n\n\tStellan: No, never. A couple of years ago, we had a reading of a play in London. The actors rehearse a little, and then you gather in the evening and read from the script to find out if it’s a good play. I had not been working in the theater for years, and I found, “My God, this doesn’t work.” I couldn’t reach the audience. I felt like I was just waiting for my close-up so I could do something. I ran out in the West End and went up and down the streets, doing voice exercises and physical exercises. I was so scared when I came back to the theater in the evening, I shook so much that I couldn’t even read the lines from the script.\n\t\n\n\tWhen my cue came, suddenly I felt something. The voice came, and the expression came, and the feeling came from years of theater work. And I knew that I could reach the furthest away in the audience.\n\n\tAlexander: When you stepped out onstage and felt that, were you bitten by the bug again? Were you feeling like, maybe it’d be fine to do something more than a reading?\n\n\tStellan: Of course, I felt this was lovely. But it’s too much work for me now — I can’t remember a lot of lines like that. But when theater is good, it’s better than anything else. But that doesn’t happen that often. When you’re working on a bad show, going down every night knowing it’s bad, you have to struggle. I’ve been enjoying learning film, learning more every day.\n\n\tAlexander: That’s interesting, because I have nothing more to learn.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tStellan: When you suddenly decided to become an actor, you went to a university in New York and studied acting for a while. And then you did some small things in Sweden, but basically were going to auditions in L.A. for six years, right?\n\n\tAlexander: It was 2000 — you were shooting a movie in L.A. I came out to visit, and I had just finished drama school in New York and didn’t have representation in Sweden. Your old manager was like, “Gee, I’ll send you out to an audition. Wouldn’t that be fun?” And it was for “Zoolander,” and I got a small part in the movie. Two weeks later, I’m in Tribeca shooting with Ben Stiller.\n\n\tI was very naive, because I’d only been to one audition, and I’d booked it. I was like, it’s a piece of cake. You just walk in and Ben Stiller’s there and then they fly you business class to New York and you shoot. And then I realized it was a lot harder; it was many years of auditioning and not booking anything. It wasn’t down to the wire, the last group of guys — I was often cut way earlier. But occasionally, almost getting stuff was enough to keep me going.\n\n\tStellan: I felt I was bleeding with you because of this constant rejection.\n\n\tAlexander: I know you were nervous going into “Sentimental Value” — about the weight of it, or your own capability of playing the part.\n\n\tStellan: You mean because of the stroke? I wasn’t that nervous, because I’d made the second season of “Andor” and the second part of “Dune” after the stroke. The directors of both helped me a lot — I was in the hospital and called Tony Gilroy and Denis Villeneuve and said, “I don’t know what’s going to happen.” They were very supportive.\n\t\n\n\tAlexander: Did you feel like, “I know I can fix this”?\n\n\tStellan: I felt I could do it. I still had my voice. I didn’t know how to handle this sort of earwig thing. But with the earwig — the guy talking in my ear — must not interrupt my rhythm; I have to hear the other person saying my cue, and he has to be very fast and clear, without emotion, say the line, and then I can create my rhythm. That was complicated. I thought, “Well, maybe this is it. Maybe I won’t get any more jobs.” And then Joachim [Trier] called me.\n\n\tAlexander: I remember before going into it, it was almost an existential crisis. You’ve been acting for 60 years, and then it’s like, “Is that it? Am I never going to do this again?”\n\n\tStellan: But also, I’m 74 years old now. Most people writing are much younger. They rarely understand older people. They think old people can’t handle a cellphone, walk funny and can’t tie their shoelaces. Most of the scripts that I get are someone who’s got dementia or Alzheimer’s. With all respect for those people, I don’t want to play that yet. Suddenly you’re supposed to play a certain age, not a person.\n\n\tWhen I got the offer to do Joachim’s film, he knew that I would say yes, of course. I invited him to Stockholm to dinner. I insisted on paying, because I said, “I don’t want to owe you anything, you cocky fucker.” I got the script and read it and it was fantastic, very sexy and beautiful. I knew I would say yes, but I still didn’t say yes immediately.\n\n\tAlexander: Why did you not commit?\n\n\tStellan: He was being a little shy himself. We were dancing around each other like two dogs sniffing each other’s asses. “How does your feces smell? Can I trust you?”\n\n\tAlexander: Clearly his feces smelled pretty good.\n\n\tStellan: His process is brilliant, and he had written the role basically for me. Getting a role like that, one of the best roles I’ve ever had, it was magic to me. The feeling on set is beautiful.\n\n\tAlexander: Similar to [Lars] von Trier?\n\n\tStellan: Yes, but the outcome is different. The Trier brothers have this similar thing that, for whatever is produced in front of the camera, you have to let go. It has to be spontaneous. And you have to allow accidents to happen — the weirdness that you can’t plan.\n\t\n\n\tWhen you got the script for “Pillion,” did you know [writer-director Harry Lighton] before?\n\n\tAlexander: Not at all. It was kind of out of the blue.\n\n\tStellan: What was it that caught your eye?\n\n\tAlexander: Well, it was a love story set in the world of BDSM, which intrigued me enough to open the script, at least. As soon as I did that, I was hooked. I was really surprised — I didn’t expect it to be so tender and sweet and funny and awkward. It was such a rich, beautiful script. I had a conversation with Harry and was incredibly impressed by his vision, how he wanted to tell this story.\n\n\tJournalists have been like, “Oh, it must have been such a scary decision to jump onboard. It’s a kinky gay biker movie by a first-time filmmaker. Why take that risk?” But if a script is phenomenal and you believe in the director, it’s not scary. I am scared if I’m not crazy about the script or if I have reservations about the filmmaker. I really believed in Harry.\n\n\tThe elephant in the room here, Dad, is that we’re both nominated for a Gotham Award in the same category. [At this year’s Gotham Awards, held on December 1, both Skarsgårds lost their category to “Sinners” actor Wunmi Mosaku.] \n\n\tAnd people believe that it’s all going to be chummy and dad and son support each other. Which we are to a certain extent.\n\n\tStellan: There are limits.\n\n\tAlexander: Now we’re up against each other.\n\n\tStellan: Now it’s gloves off.\n\n\tAlexander: “Sentimental Value” — a beautiful film. You play yourself, right? An absentee father?\n\n\tStellan: That’s an insult.\n\n\tAlexander: The smear campaign has begun.\n\n\tStellan: You don’t have to smear “Pillion.” It smears itself.\n\n\tAlexander: What do you think of my performance in “Pillion”? Was it worthy of — I don’t know — a Gotham Award?\n\n\tStellan: It’s very hard to predict whether it is worthy of a Gotham Award or not. But it was a very moving and beautiful film, and I had a lot of fun seeing it. You showed me sides of you that I had never seen before.\n\n\tAlexander: Literally.\n\n\tStellan: Literally.\n\n\tAlexander: But it was a really incredible weekend we had at the Telluride Film Festival. Usually, you dip in for 48 hours and it’s press junkets and screenings and then you’re out. But this was lovely, because all we had to do was one Q & A each. So we had time to hang out, get drunk together, be hungover together, see each other’s movies. Watching “Sentimental Value” with you next to me was something I’ll never forget. Because knowing what you went through in the years leading up to it … It was a 9 a.m. screening, so I was a little hungover, very fragile and emotionally open.\n\t\n\n\tStellan: It really gets to people when they’re slightly fragile, right?\n\n\tAlexander: Yes.\n\n\tStellan: Like any film does.\n\n\tThis is a conversation from Variety and CNN’s Actors on Actors.

    "body": "\n\tSydney Sweeney holds a melting ice cream cone, Jacob Elordi prepares raw meat, Hunter Schafer poses in front of a painting, Zendaya sits in pews and more in new images from “Euphoria” Season 3.\n\n\tOn Friday morning, HBO released six distinct looks at the main characters of Sam Levinson’s high school fantasia, which jumps ahead five years in the new episodes. “Euphoria” Season 3 premieres on HBO and HBO Max in April 2026.\n\n\n\tIn the last couple of months, HBO has trickled out imagery and information on “Euphoria” Season 3. In October, the cabler revealed the new installment’s sprawling cast, and in early December, series creator Sam Levinson shared a sneak peak with British press, explaining where some of the characters end up after a time jump. “Five years felt like a natural place because if they’d gone to college they’d be out of college at that time,” he said of where the show picks up. “We basically pick up Rue [Zendaya] south of the border in Mexico, in debt to Laurie [Martha Kelly], trying to come up with some very innovative ways to pay it off.”\n\t\n\n\tPlus: “Jules [Schafer] is in art school, very nervous about having a career as a painter and trying to avoid responsibility at all costs. Maddy [Alexa Demie] is working in Hollywood at a talent agency for a manager, she’s obviously got her own side hustles going. And Lexi [Maude Apatow] is an assistant to a showrunner played by Sharon Stone, who is just absolutely delightful and a true icon.”\n\n\tHe continued, “And then Cassie [Sweeney] is living in the suburbs with Nate [Elordi], they’re engaged and she’s very addicted to social media and envious of what appears to be the big lives that all of her high school classmates are living at this point in time. I feel strongly this is our best season yet… I will say that Cassie and Nate do in fact get married. I’m confirming it. And I promise that it will be an unforgettable night.”\n\t\n\n\tHBO released the first footage of “Euphoria” in a 2026 sizzle reel on Friday, which also included glimpses of “Lanterns,” “House of the Dragon,” Larry David’s new series and more.\n\n\tSee the new “Euphoria” images below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Down Cemetery Road,” the Apple TV thriller series starring Emma Thompson and Ruth Wilson, has been renewed for a second season.\n\n\tThe news comes on the heels of the show’s Season 1 finale, which aired on Wednesday. Season 2 will “reunite Zoë Boehm (Thompson) and Sarah Trafford (Wilson) chasing down another twisted mystery,” according to a provided synopsis. “After a woman falls in front of a train Zoë is called in to investigate, but this seemingly simple case soon upends her life as she and Sarah find themselves navigating the glamorous but ruthless world of black market antiquities. Matters take a deadly turn when they stumble into the path of a brutal serial killer who will stop at nothing to cover up his crimes.”\n\t\n\n\tThompson also executive produces “Down Cemetery Road” alongside writer Morwenna Banks; Jamie Laurenson, Hakan Kousetta and Tom Nash at 60Forty Films; and Mick Herron, the author of the 2003 novel the show is based on. Börkur Sigþórssen (“Insomnia”) will serve as lead director for the second season.\n\n\n\t“I’m so thrilled that ‘Down Cemetery Road’ has been enjoyed enough to warrant a second season,” Thompson said in a statement. “The thought of working with the team again, with wonderful Morwenna Banks in the writer’s seat and the indomitable Ruth Wilson who is the best and most brilliant co-star any aging Dame could desire, is frankly far more than I feel I deserve. Zoë Boehm is a punkishly delicious avatar and I can’t wait to pull on her knock-off Doc Martens again. Thanks to everyone who watched! We are go for the next one and it’s all down to you.”\n\t\n\n\tAdded Jay Hunt, creative director, Europe at Apple TV: “Audiences around the world fell in love with ‘Down Cemetery Road’ and I am glad the unlikely duo of Zoë and Sarah will be back with their unique form of acerbic wit.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLiam Neeson “never has been, and is not, anti-vaccination,” a representative for the actor told Entertainment Weekly amid controversy over Neeson’s participation in the documentary “Plague of Corruption: 80 Years of Pharmaceutical Corruption Exposed.” The film, directed by Michael Mazzola and based on the 2021 book of the same name, “expresses skepticism toward vaccines, features discredited science and includes an interview with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services and a noted vaccine skeptic.” Neeson serves as a narrator in the documentary.“We all recognize that corruption can exist within the pharmaceutical industry, but that should never be conflated with opposition to vaccines,” Neeson’s representative said. “Liam never has been, and is not, anti-vaccination. His extensive work with UNICEF underscores his long-held support for global immunization and public-health initiatives. He did not shape the film’s editorial content, and any questions about its claims or messaging should be directed to the producers.”\n\t\n\n\tVariety has reached out to Neeson’s representative for additional comment.\n\n\n\tPer Entertainment Weekly: “Clips from ‘Plague of Corruption’ posted to social media promote the disproven notion that autism is linked to vaccines, the baseless idea that the polio vaccine caused the COVID-19 pandemic, and an insistence that ‘some vaccines are not safe and effective.’ Neeson’s voice can be heard in several clips on the film’s social media page, including one in which he claims that ‘science has become dangerously politicized.'”\n\n\tNeeson has regularly advocated for vaccines throughout his role as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, saying in 2022: “Once a terrifying diagnosis, polio is no longer a threat in most of the world. The conversation about vaccines in recent years has lost sight of how much good they have done for each of us. We need to celebrate this. It is perhaps one of the biggest collective achievements in human history.”\n",

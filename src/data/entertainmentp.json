    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThough a yearslong diet of budget cuts, corporate mergers, course corrections and C-suite retrenchments have dimmed the optimism of many TV industry professionals as commissioning numbers continue to dwindle, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/banijay-entertainment/\">Banijay Entertainment</a>‘s head of scripted <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/steve-matthews/\">Steve Matthews</a> insists now is the time to think big.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I do think that there is optimism at the moment, in terms of a little bit of creative risk. Things are not as grim as they were a couple years ago,” Matthews said on Tuesday, speaking at Rome’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mia-market/\">MIA Market</a>.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter several painful years in which streaming platforms were hampered by “terribly conservative” decision-making, according to the Banijay exec, those very same streamers are pushing back, insisting that they’re “not quite like that anymore.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I think it’s improving. I think there is a kind of doom loop where we’ve convinced ourselves as producers that they’re risk averse, and it’s going round and round in circles,” Matthews said. “But I think now is the time to give a bit of a push…. I think that there is a little bit more openness from the buyers for other things.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRecent breakout shows, such as Netflix’s “Baby Reindeer,” have offered a blueprint for global success, according to Tesha Crawford, EVP head of international television at New Regency in the U.K., who noted how the hit series used a “very local, very specific” story to reach audiences worldwide. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I think it really had something to say about abuse and trauma,” she said. “I think if you’re really clear about what you’re trying to say, that also really resonates.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“What we look for is who’s really the creator — to put a lot of stock in that person and in that [writer’s] room,” said Larry Grimaldi, senior vice president of creative affairs and original movies at Fox Entertainment Studios. “To really look for that singular point of view, that when you read it on the page, and when you talk to a writer, you want to believe that this is the only person that can write this story.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes time to selling that story to audiences, however, the Fox exec acknowledged that the industry is becoming overly reliant on “the face in the box” — streaming shorthand for casting recognizable actors whose thumbnails drive audience engagement. </p>\n<p>\n\t“TV used to be a place where you would discover new actors, and you would discover new writers. And it’s kind of a shame that we have to put all this stock in people who are just the easy bets,” he said. “I think there’s a place for both.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLéo Becker, head of international originals and co-productions at France’s Federation Studios, noted that producers often have to go to such lengths “in a market that’s so competitive for everybody’s eyeballs and attention.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Whether it’s the face in the box, or it’s the big creator, or it’s the big IP, or it’s something you’ve never seen before — that’s the kind of show that you can specifically tailor for the international market,” he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tBecker, who’s executive producing an adaptation of Charles Dickens’ “Tale of Two Cities” for the BBC and MGM+, said he passed on several iterations of the series until he was approached two years ago with a package toplined by “Game of Thrones” star Kit Harington, “who’d been wanting to make this for years,” according to the Federation exec. </p>\n<p>\n\t“You can have the same IP, the same story, but if you don’t develop it right and if you don’t package it right from the beginning, it’s not going to work for the international market,” said Becker.</p>\n<p>\n\tBrendan Fitzgerald, CEO of Spain’s Secuoya Studios, agreed that top talent can help push a package past the finish line, describing his company’s strategy to secure in-demand actors as executive producers on a “two-step deal” that ensures they’ll join the cast if the project is greenlit.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“That, immediately from the beginning, adds momentum to the pitches, adds credibility to the pitches, adds excitement and buzz,” he said. “It also gives the actor…the ability to truly engage and help drive the project from the get-go.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThere’s no one-size-fits-all solution, according to New Regency’s Crawford. “You have to do what is best for the project creatively,” she said. “Sometimes there are actors who don’t have a big following on social media, but people do know them and love them. And I think it’s just about finding roles that are really interesting for them.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s not about calling up an agent and getting the most famous actor on television,” added Christian Rank, managing director at Sweden’s Miso Film. “It’s about packaging organically. And it’s always story first…. How do I make this resonate? How do I attach the right people to the show at the right time to make those commissioners feel safe?”</p>\n<p>\n\tCoddling commissioning agents might go with the territory for TV producers in 2025. But Banijay’s Matthews doubled down on his conviction that series creators can “push some things a little bit forward” in the current climate — and encouraged them to take big swings.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Whatever it is you’re trying to do, do it to the maximum,” he said. “Don’t water it down.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRome’s MIA Market runs Oct. 6 – 10. </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has weighed in on the political debate over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bad-bunny/\">Bad Bunny</a> being booked to play the 2026 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/super-bowl/\">Super Bowl</a> halftime show, saying it was “a terrible decision” — echoing the beliefs of President Donald J. Trump, who already established his own antipathy toward Bad Bunny.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohnson did have some constructive input for who he believes should have been picked to perform by halftime producer Roc Nation: The Republican leader said ’80s country star Lee Greenwood would have been America’s clear and obvious preference, citing “a broader audience.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAsked about the controversy outside House chambers, Johnson admitted that the globally popular artist who just hosted “Saturday Night Live” over the weekend was not really on his radar, but said he knew it was a bad call anyway.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I didn’t even know who Bad Bunny was. But it sounds like a terrible decision, in my view, from what I’m hearing,” Johnson said.  Asked why, the speaker noted, “It sounds like he’s not someone who appeals to a broader audience.”</p>\n<p>\n\tJohnson added, “And there are so many eyes on the Super Bowl — a lot of young, impressionable children. And, in my view, you would have Lee Greenwood, or role models, doing that. Not somebody like this.”</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tJohnson did not mention, as some other Bad Bunny detractors have, that a bone of contention for some conservatives is that the Puerto Rican artist sings exclusively in Spanish. The singer also took flak from the right for recently saying that, following a record-breaking residency in Puerto Rico, he would not be bringing his tour to the continental United States any time soon because of the possibility that it would draw ICE raids on his crowds. That fear was all but confirmed when Trump administration officials said ICE would be at the Super Bowl in force, in response to Bad Bunny getting star billing.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday, the president took a stance much like Johnson’s — likewise declaring that while he knew nothing about Bad Bunny, he knew his appearance would be a travesty nonetheless. Responding to a question from a NewsMax host who said “the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nfl/\">NFL</a> just chose the Bad Bunny Rabbit, or whatever his name is,” Trump answered, “I’ve never heard of him. I don’t know who he is. I don’t know why they’re doing it. It’s crazy. … I think it’s absolutely ridiculous.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOther members of the administration have indicated they have a better idea who Bad Bunny is, and that it has affected plans for ICE to be out in force at the Super Bowl. After the halftime booking was announced, Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem both indicated agents would be deployed to the game to pick up undocumented migrants. Asked specifically about the NFL’s Bad Bunny booking, Noem said: “Well, they suck and we’ll win, and God will bless us and we’ll stand and be proud of ourselves at the end of the day, and they won’t be able to sleep at night because they don’t know what they believe. And they’re so weak, we’ll fix it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the encounter in the House hallways Tuesday, the speaker was asked the questions about Bad Bunny by Pablo Manríquez, who runs the immigrant news outlet Migrant Insider.</p>\n<p>\n\tBad Bunny has had more than 100 songs chart on the Hot 100 in the U.S., including the No. 1 single “I Like It.” His last four albums have all debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s U.S. album chart. The most recent, “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 in January with 122,000 units, then climbed to No. 1 with 203,500 units the following week.</p>\n</div>",

Or if he did, he didn’t take it to heart.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWinstone recalled that he was “out all night” the evening prior, and as soon as he walked into the audition, he knew he was “wrong for the part.” Instead of telling him outright, Winstone said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/george-lucas/\">George Lucas</a> “relayed the message to me through someone else,” which he “took umbrage” at.</p>\n<p>\n\tWinstone remembered Lucas yawning through his entire casting, presumably because of “jet lag.” After the try-out was over, the “Star Wars” mastermind was dead silent, prompting Winstone to tell him, “Why don’t we both have a 15-minute sleep and then I’ll fuck off?”</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite missing out on the role, Winstone has no regrets. He said that “Star Wars” is “that sort of film would bore the arse off me, all that bluescreen work.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe role of Padmé’s father, Ruwee Naberrie, ultimately went to Graeme Blundell, who appeared in the role in “Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThree years after the 2005 release of “Revenge of the Sith,” Winstone reunited with Lucas on “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” Lucas was a writer and executive producer on the film, while Winstone played antagonist George “Mac” Michale.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWinstone’s more recent credits include “Damsel,” “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” and “The Gentlemen” TV series.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nancylee-myatt/\">Nancylee Myatt</a>, a television writer and producer who created NBC’s teen sitcom”Social Studies” and won a Daytime Emmy Award for her writing on the animated series “Teacher’s Pet,” died on Sept. 23 in Basel, Switzerland. She was 68. Her death was confirmed by her wife, Paige Williams Bernhardt. </p>\n<p>\n\tMyatt was diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment in 2021, a condition that ran in her family. The disease progressed to Alzheimer’s dementia in 2023. Myatt elected to “end her life peacefully and with dignity,” per a statement from Bernhardt. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMyatt was born in 1957 and was a card-carrying member of the Cherokee tribe in Oklahoma. She graduated from the University of California, Irvine and acted on stage and in commercials as she began her career as a playwright. She penned the Los Angeles-produced plays “Two on the Aisle for Murder,” “Slumber Party,” “Afterlife,” “Nothing So Simple as Love” and “Wet Paint” before graduating from the Warner Bros.’ writers workshop in 1990 and turning to television.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a mentee of Norman Lear, Myatt was the only female staff writer on the early-’90s sitcom “The Powers That Be.” She later wrote on the last two seasons of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/night-court/\">Night Court</a>,” including the show’s finale. She was a writer and producer on CBS’s “The Five Mrs. Buchanans” and Fox’s “Living Single.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMyatt created and produced the short-lived sitcom “Social Studies,” which premiered in 1997 and hailed from Dolly Parton’s Sandollar Productions. Her other TV writing credits include episodes of “Recess,” “Lloyd in Space” and “Teacher’s Pet” for Disney TV Animation and ABC, “Trackers” for Sony TV and the  pilot for “Nikki & Nora,” which went unaired but later leaked and inspired the webseries “The N&N Files.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tShe also wrote TV adaptations of the teen novels “Annie on My Mind” and “A Time for Dancing” and served as the showrunner, co-executive producer, writer and director on “South of Nowhere.” Her other TV producing credits include “Life with Roger,” “Cleghorne!,” “Muddling Through” and “South of Nowhere.” Later in life, she was co-writing a teen pilot called “Cupidity” with Ralph Maccio.</p>\n<p>\n\tMyatt is survived by her wife and writing partner, Paige Williams Bernhardt, and friends and family. Donations can be made in Myatt’s memory to the Alzheimer’s Association Louisiana Chapter or the National Spay Alliance Foundation(NSAF Savannah).</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/cody-johnson/\">Cody Johnson</a>, one of the leading contenders for the upcoming CMA Awards, says he has had to cancel the remaining dates on his current arena tour due to a ruptured eardrum that requires immediate surgery.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe country star, who just picked his first CMAs nomination for entertainer of the year, broke the news about the cancellations and shared his health emergency on his social media.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It is with a very heavy heart I have to share the remainder of this year’s concert performances will not be able to happen,” Johnson wrote. “While battling a severe upper respiratory and sinus infection, I burst my ear drum. The severity of the rupture means I must undergo immediate surgery. The healing process will take many weeks, and it is not possible for me to sing during this time.”  \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added, “Without the surgery my downtime could be months. I pray for full healing so I can get well and return to doing what I love. Thank you COJO Nation for the love and support now, and always.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe further posted a video message with a bandage over his left ear, saying he was “home from surgery and it went well, as best as they could have expected.”</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tJohnson had six dates left to go on his schedule this year, all in arenas or at festivals: Oct. 18 in Pittsburgh, Oct. 24-25 in Birmingham, Oct. 31 at Lousiana’s Boots in the Bayou festival, Nov. 8 in Phoenix and Dec. 5 in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis social blast said to “please stay tuned for an email from your ticket providers for further details.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn mid-September, Johnson had canceled shows in Columbus due to health issues. He wrote then, “I arrived home Monday after my shows in Nebraska feeling fine. Tuesday, I felt like I was coming down with a mild cold. I took every precaution that I could: IVs, meds, even sweated in the sauna… unfortunately today I woke up without a singing voice: severe cough, burning chest and throat.” He said then that his team was working on rescheduling those shows for 2026.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThere’s no word yet on whether Johnson will be sufficiently recovered to appear at the CMAs on Nov. 19, where, as one of the leading nominees, it’s expected he would receive a first-call invitation to perform. Johnson’s reps could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tJohnson is nominated for four CMAs, the most of any male artist. Besides entertainer of the year, he is up for male vocalist of the year, music event of the year and music video of the year (the latter two for his duet with Carrie Underwood, “I’m Gonna Love You”).</p>\n<p>\n\tBesides his CMA nominations, Johnson was in the news recently when he was announced as one of three headliners for next April’s Stagecoach Festival in California, alongside Post Malone and Lainey Wilson. The next date currently on his schedule is Feb. 14 in Louisville.</p>\n</div>",

Rocking a black and blue “Marty Supreme” branded track suit and a ping-pong ball Halloween mask, faceless individuals also sporting the mask droned on around him, rallying in pairs at ping-pong tables. Soon enough, Chalamet rips off his mask and storms out of the box, and the masked men follow close behind.\n\t</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tChalamet stomps through an open field to the sound of a skull-shaking EDM track, which samples Jason Mewes’ monologue from the 2001 film “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.” Eventually, he retreats into a shipping container decorated like an interview set. Pleasant muzak played as Chalamet tied his shoelace and slipped water from an armchair, a poster for the A24 propped up behind him on an easel.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“‘Marty Supreme’ is an American film that comes out on Christmas 2025,” Chalamet said after nearly two minutes of silence, appearing out of focus in the frame of his Instagram live as the camera displayed the film’s poster.</p>\n<p>\n\tChalamet teased the live broadcast with a clip from an intense music festival mosh pit, with the hand-drawn caption “Supreme season incoming.”</p>\n<p>\n\tA24 is known for its left-field marketing tactics, and Chalamet has more skin in the game than usual — he’s credited as a producer on the project.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAlong with Chalamet, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/josh-safdie/\">Josh Safdie</a>-directed film stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Odessa A’Zion, Kevin O’Leary, Tyler Okonma, Abel Ferrara and Fran Drescher.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tBeing at war with Gavin Adcock was one thing. But to be warred upon by some of his own fans is another. And so <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zach-bryan/\">Zach Bryan</a> has clarified, somewhat, his intentions with a song snippet he posted on social media that contained a line about ICE, saying that “when you hear the rest of the song, you will understand the full context that hits on both sides of the aisle.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBryan’s attempt to tell his followers that he was not making a partisan political statement with the song comes in the wake of a deluge of “fans” posting that they are now ready to cancel the singer-songwriter. Many have posted that they are even ready to “Dixie Chick” him, which would amount to not just abandoning him but working to ruin his career. Even the White House and the Department of Homeland Security weighed in Tuesday on the partial tune.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“To see how much shit it stirred up makes me not only embarrassed but kind of scared,” wrote the Navy veteran, who has claimed in the past that he does not stand on either side of the political divide, and is trying to reiterate that now in the face of a firestorm. “Left wing or right wing we’re all one bird and American. To be clear I’m on neither of these radical sides,” he said.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe brouhaha started over when an audio snippet of a verse of an unnamed song began to be recirculated, in both electric and acoustic versions. Not all of the lyrics were completely legible, nor was it clear if the song was meant to be from Bryan’s point of view or one of his character-driven songs. What was clear, though, was that it included the line “ICE is gonna come bust down your door,” and was captioned “the fading of the red, white and blue” — lines that deeply upset many on the right, who weren’t about to wait to hear the full tune before weighing in with outrage. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBryan posted his first message with the header: “Pls fuckn read this””</p>\n<p>\n\t“I wrote this song months ago,” he began. “I posted this song three months ago as a snippet. This shows you how divisive a narrative can be when shoved down our throats through social media. This song is about how much I love this country and everyone in it more than anything. When you hear the rest of the song, you will understand the full context that hits on both sides of the aisle. Everyone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are. We need to find our way back.” </p>\n<p>\n\tHe continued, “I served this country, I love this country and the song itself is about all of us coming out of  this divided space. I wasn’t speaking as a politician or some greater-than-thou asshole, just a 29-year-old man who is as confused as everyone else. To see how much shit it stirred up makes me not only embarrassed but kind of scared. Left wing or right wing we’re all one bird and American. To be clear I’m on neither of these radical sides. To all those disappointed in me on either side of whatever you believe in, just know I’m trying my best too and we all say things that are misconstrued sometimes.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe concluded this first message on a sunny note: “Everyone have a great day and I love each and every one of ya!!!”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a followup post on his Instagram Stories, Bryan added: “The last few months of my life I’ve been scrutinized by more people than I ever thought possible. I feel like I’ve tried my hardest in so many ways and it’s so hard to see where my bearings even are anymore. Been falling off a cliff while trying to grow wings at the same time.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I am SO proud to have served in a country where we can all speak freely and converse amongst each other without getting doxed or accosted on the internet or worse; the violence and heartbreak we’ve faced in the last few months!” he concluded. “God speed ol sons, I’m out!”</p>\n<p>\n\t(His reference to having received other scrutiny over the past few months likely refers to his feud with country singer Adcock. Video was shown of Bryan climbing a fence at a music festival they both were attending to try to get at Adcock and being held back by security guards.)</p>\n<p>\n\tThe furor over the lyrics prompted Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary of public affairs Tricia McLaughlin to issue a statement telling Bryan off: “Stick to ‘Pink Skies,'” she said, referring to a hit ballad about family members gathering for a funeral.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLater, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson took Bryan on with a social post that mashed up a half-dozen of his song titles: “While Zach Bryan wants to Open the Gates to criminal illegal aliens and has Condemned heroic ICE officers, Something in the Orange tells me a majority of Americans disagree with him and support President Trump’s great American Revival. Godspeed, Zach!”</p>\n<p>\n\tBryan is said to have a new album in the works that will presumably include the new song in full, but no release date has been announced.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the past, while trumpeting his nonpartisan bona fides, the singer did praise President Donald J. Trump, after last fall’s assassination attempt on the campaign trail. “I don’t support Trump or Biden,” Bryan said in an Instagram video post, “but the man got shot in the ear, head, whatever you guys want to call it. And then: fist bump in the air! That is sick, dude!” </p>\n<p>\n\tA typical response to Bryan’s new song snippet came from the MAGA commentator self-described as “Catturd,” who posted that that the song was a “desperate Hail Mary” from Bryan, whose “non-career is in the toilet.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBryan has sold the equivalent of 30 million units in the U.S. alone, according to the RIAA, has amassed more than 16 billion Spotify streams, and set a record for the largest ticketed concert in U.S. history last month, drawing more than 112,000 fans to Michigan Stadium.</p>\n</div>",

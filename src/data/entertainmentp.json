    "body": "\n\tAfter a whirlwind 2025, actor-director Hafsia Herzi will step before the camera in “La Foudre” (“Lightning”), the latest feature from Arnaud and Jean-Marie Larrieu, while continuing to develop the literary adaptation “Adèle” as a potential directorial outing.\n\n\tAdapted from Pierric Bailly’s 2023 novel, “La Foudre” unfolds as a love triangle within the shepherding community of the Haut-Jura mountains, set in motion when a young man is accused of murder. The film marks the Larrieu brothers’ second consecutive adaptation of Bailly’s work, following “Jim’s Story,” which premiered at Cannes and earned Karim Leklou the César for best actor in 2025 — an evening that also saw Herzi take home the best actress prize for her performance in “Borgo.”\n\t\n\n\tHerzi also has Léa Mysius’ “The Birthday Party” and Rudi Rosenberg’s “Quelques Mots d’Amour” set for release this year. Looking further ahead, she will return to writing with her long-gestating adaptation of Leïla Slimani’s “Adèle” (original title “Dans le jardin de l’ogre”), a project she has been attached to since 2021. She plans, however, to take her time before stepping back behind the camera, telling Variety that she needs to recharge after an “exhausting,” “roller-coaster” year.\n\n\n\tIndeed, the past 12 months have been exceptional by any standard. Herzi won a César for best actress before breaking into the Cannes competition with her third feature, “The Little Sister,” which follows a young woman juggling her devout Muslim faith with her desire to live freely as a lesbian. The film left the Croisette with the Queer Palm and the festival’s best actress prize for newcomer Nadia Melliti, before launching the French awards season by winning the Louis-Delluc Prize, widely regarded as France’s most prestigious film honor.\n\t\n\n\tThe multi-hyphenate also starred in two productions back-to-back during the brief summer window between Cannes and her film’s French release  — shooting “The Birthday Party” alongside Monica Bellucci and Benoît Magimel, and “Quelques Mots d’Amour” before embarking on a rather challenging promotional tour for “The Little Sister.”\n\n\t“I didn’t want to talk about it too much when the film came out, so as not to draw attention, but we received several threats,” Herzi reveals. “Nadia herself was really harassed, and we had to have extra security at every premiere. That negative reaction was a small percentage, and there was ultimately far more goodwill than hostility — but still, it wasn’t easy.”\n\n\tThe filmmaker was alarmed, but hardly shocked. \n\n\t“I knew it would be complicated,” she says. “If a character like this hadn’t existed on screen before, it’s because she unsettles people. I felt that very clearly when we began looking for financing—I was even told that this kind of story wasn’t realistic. That only made me fight harder.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the season finale of “Percy Jackson and the Olympians,” now streaming on Disney+.\n\n\tFresh off his breakout role in “The Adam Project,” Walker Scobell was just 12 years old when he took on one of YA literature’s most beloved heroes, Percy Jackson. Five years later, he’s growing up as he plays the demigod son of Poseidon, who weathered epic battles and emotional twists in Season 2 of Disney+’s hit adaptation, which is based on Rick Riordan’s second “Percy Jackson” book, “The Sea of Monsters.” Along the way, Scobell has had to balance life as a teenager with the pressures of bringing Riordan’s beloved character to life.\n\t\n\n\tThe Season 2 finale opens with Percy, Annabeth (Leah Sava Jeffries), Grover (Aryan Simhadri), Tyson (Daniel Diemer) and Clarisse (Dior Goodjohn) racing back to Camp Half-Blood after successfully stealing the magical Golden Fleece back from Luke (Charlie Bushnell). But getting there isn’t easy. They’re ambushed by Laestrygonian giants, and to make matters worse, some of the campers they trusted have turned out to be traitors. While they fight their way home, Luke and his forces launch a full-scale assault on the camp, trying to break through its weakened defenses.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCharlie Bushnell as Luke\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney/David Bukach\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAgainst heavy odds, Percy and the group make it to Thalia’s tree and place the Fleece on its branches. The Fleece’s powers are so strong that not only is the tree healed from Luke’s poison, but Thalia (Tamara Smart) emerges in human form, brought back to life without having aged since the day six years ago when Zeus (Courtney B. Vance) erected the tree to hold her spirit. Percy is no longer the only child of the “big three” gods who could fulfill the Great Prophecy.\n\t\n\n\tIn a dramatic departure from the book, the finale delivers a shocking twist. It’s revealed in a flashback that the Furies didn’t attack Thalia. Instead, they told her about the Great Prophecy and Zeus’ hopes that she will grow up to save Olympus on his behalf. Angry that he would expect this of her despite his absence in her life, Thalia tells Zeus when he appears that she refuses to serve as his weapon. He decides she cannot remain alive, transforming her into the magical tree that will protect Camp Half-Blood. He then orders Chiron (Glynn Turman) to tell everyone he did it to save Thalia’s life after the Furies almost killed her. The new ending changes everything the campers thought they knew about Thalia’s “sacrifice,” and sets the stage for conflicts in Season 3.\n\n\t“It just solidifies everything we know in mythology about Zeus,” Scobell told Variety. “And it makes it a lot easier for a lot of demigods to join Luke’s side.”\n\n\tScobell is now heading into uncharted waters with Season 3, as Riordan’s book “The Titan’s Curse” has never been adapted. “I almost feel like there’s less pressure, because I don’t think there’s anything to really compare it to,” he said. “I thought Logan Lerman had a wonderful performance as Percy Jackson, but now I’m on my own.”\n\n\tVariety spoke with Scobell about his experience closing out Season 2, and what lies ahead for Percy Jackson.\n\t\n\t\tThroughout the season, Percy is the one person who’s not particularly eager for Thalia’s return. How did it feel to build up that tension in Season 2 when you didn’t have scenes with Thalia until the very end? And how does it feel now that you’re acting with her as you shoot Season 3?\t\n\n\tWhen we were doing these scenes, building up that tension, I was kind of nervous. I was like, “What are we gonna do next year?” I didn’t know if they were going to add something else or if they were going to change something, and they did it. I just had no idea what they were gonna do with it, especially after that big plot twist on Thalia’s backstory — that Zeus did it. So I was really excited to see what was gonna happen when Annabeth and then Thalia and I are just left almost alone.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLeft to right: Leah Sava Jeffries as Annabeth, Tamara Smart as Thalia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney/David Bukach\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Season 2 finale takes a pretty dramatic pivot from the book. How do you think the difference in Thalia’s sacrifice is going to change things now that the gang knows it wasn’t what they thought it was?\t\n\n\tIt’s just gonna be even more of a reason to join Luke’s side. We explore that a little bit more in Season 3. And it’s difficult, because Percy can’t argue with that at all really. From Percy’s point of view, she’s not really wrong. Percy agrees with her. It just solidifies everything we know in mythology about Zeus, in my opinion. It makes it a lot easier for Thalia to join Luke’s side.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPercy gives a very motivating and inspired speech to dozens of campers before the final battle. How was that to do?\t\n\n\tNerve-racking for sure. I was definitely freaking out a little bit. A lot of people in that room were really familiar faces, so it made it very easy. We’ve all been acting together forever. So I think it made it a lot easier.\n\t\n\t\tWe got a glimpse at what happens to Percy when he thinks Annabeth is in danger, and in “The Titan’s Curse,” they’re separated for a long time. How does it feel for you to not have Leah around as you’re shooting Season 3? And how is Percy dealing with the absence of Annabeth?\t\n\n\tIt was definitely different on set without Leah, for sure. But it was also different without Aryan. Things are different every season. But yeah, he’s just on a mission, and he’s not really going to stop until he gets her back.\n\t\n\t\tPercy and Annabeth have had a slow burn, but you also have lines like, “If I had to choose between you and Olympus, I’d burn it all down.” Rick Riordan told Variety after the Season 2 premiere that they were both still in denial about their feelings for each other. At this point in the story, do you think Percy has realized what his feelings towards Annabeth are?\t\n\n\tI don’t think at this part of the story he necessarily has romantic feelings. I think yes to slow burn, and I think yes, if there wasn’t these books, people would also ship them together. But at the same time, I can imagine him saying these lines to Grover; I can imagine saying these lines to Tyson — it just happens to be that it is Annabeth. I guess they have been trying to lean into that. \n\n\tAnd I guess in Season 3, we pull back a little bit. We don’t lean into it as much. It’s more like he’s trying to get to her over anything. But that’s just like Percy; it’s like getting to Grover. He really cares about her, and I don’t think it’s like a romantic thing yet. I mean, he still has two love interests to go, so that’s what also makes it difficult. Sometimes I read those lines and I’m like, “I gotta not lean into this with what I’m doing” —  but then, I get the notes to lean into it. It’s gonna be interesting when Rachel and Calypso show up.\n\t\n\t\tHow do you think Annabeth feels about Percy right now?\t\n\n\tI think they like each other — not like a crush or anything. I think they’re just really good friends. I would say Grover is like his brother, and I would say Tyson’s like his brother. I think Annabeth is basically one of his best friends at this point. I also don’t think they’re thinking about that at all, because there’s a lot more going on.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLeft to right: Aryan Simhadri as Grover, Leah Sava Jeffries as Annabeth\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIs there a scene from the book that you wish was in the show but didn’t make it?\t\n\n\tSome things just don’t work out because of pace, or they don’t work out because we wanted to lean into something else that’s a bigger deal. I was missing the Hydra a little bit, but then it’s like, we made the Scylla sequence really massive. And that makes a lot of sense to me. Sometimes you have to pick and choose what you really make a big deal. And it’s also expensive. Hydra is a lot of money, and you’ve got to be careful. It would be cool to have the Hydra and Scylla, but at the same time, I’d rather have one of those things that looks really good, rather than both of them not looking that great and not being able to lean into them completely.\n\n\tI also missed the dodgeball sequence at school. But then, we made enough room for the Manticore and Dr. Thorn chase in Episode 2 [of Season 3], focusing on that and then also that fight sequence.\n\t\n\t\tYou’re in the middle of filming Season 3. The third book has never been adapted. How does it feel now that you’re moving into uncharted territory? Do you feel any pressure, or is it more exciting?\t\n\n\tI almost feel like there’s less pressure, because I don’t think there’s anything to really compare it to. I thought Logan Lerman had a wonderful performance as Percy Jackson, but now I’m on my own.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWalker Scobell as Percy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney/David Bukach\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBetween seasons, do you go back home? Do you live with your parents? Do you go to school? Do you live a relatively normal life?\t\n\n\tYeah, it’s actually a lot like Percy in a weird way, and I always found that pretty funny. I go home from this, and I just go right back to school — I just pick up where I left off. I’ve known all these teachers at the school I go to for a long time. I definitely get cut some slack. But at the end of the day, I do the same work that every other kid does, and I like going back to that.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Great British Bake Off” judge Prue Leith has revealed that she is leaving the beloved Channel 4 competition series.\n\n\tIn an Instagram post on Wednesday, Leith wrote: “After nine series and judging more than 400 challenges, I have decided to step down as a judge on ‘The Great British Bake Off.'”\n\n\tLeith replaced Mary Berry on the baking show in 2017, joining Paul Hollywood to judge the contestants’ confectionary creations. The current hosts of “The Great British Bake Off” are Alison Hammond, who joined in 2023, and Noel Fielding, who has been presenting the show since 2017. \n\t\n\n\n\t“‘Bake Off’ has been a fabulous part of my life for the last nine years, I have genuinely loved it and I’m sure I’ll miss working with my fellow judge Paul, Alison and Noel and the teams at Love Productions and Channel 4,” Leith continued. “But now feels like the right time to step back (I’m 86 for goodness sake!), there’s so much I’d like to do, not least spend summers enjoying my garden. Whoever joins the team, I’m sure they’ll love it as much as I have. I feel very lucky to have been part of it.”\n\n\n\tIn 2024, Leith stepped down from the celebrity version of “The Great British Bake Off” and was replaced by Caroline Waldegrave. A replacement for Leith on the civilian “Bake Off” has not yet been announced.\n\n\tFormer “Bake Off” winners and contestants took to the comments section on Leith’s post to wish her well.\n\n\t“We will miss you so much,” wrote 2018 champion Rahul Mandal. “It was a joy and privilege to be in the tent with you. You are kind, funny passionate and always inspired us.”\n\t\n\n\tAdded last year’s winner Jasmine Mitchell: “You’re amazing and we will miss you so very much.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlix Earle and her family will be the subject of a new Netflix reality series in 2026.\n\n\tPer the streamer, the show will spotlight the Gen-Z it girl’s “modern family,” including her influencer sister Ashtin Earle and her group of friends. It promises to “document the real-time messiness of a young woman in transition.”\n\n\t“I share a lot of my life on social media, and people think they know everything there is to know about me and my family, but honestly, there’s still so much more,” Earle said in a statement. “We are so happy that the show found a home with Netflix. At its core, this show is about our fun, loving, sometimes chaotic modern family, and how we always show up for each other through it all.” \n\t\n\n\tEarle hosts the podcast “Hot Mess” and was recently seen on “Dancing With the Stars” and “Happy Gilmore 2.” She rose to stardom as a college student at the University of Miami, where her “get ready with me” videos went viral. Soon, she became an internet celebrity with a growing business empire as a strategic investor.\n\n\n\tAs someone who is used to steering her own narrative, Earle said it will be “a little scary” to have someone else behind the camera. “I’m so used to being in control of what I share and what I keep private, so having cameras around in moments I normally wouldn’t post is definitely an adjustment,” she said. “But the real, human moments are what connected me to my audience in the first place. If letting people in even more makes someone feel less alone, or even just makes them laugh, then it’s worth it.”\n\n\tBen Winston, Paul Loban and Charlie Van Vleet are executive producers of the project for Fulwell Entertainment, as well as David Grutman’s DGN Studios with Evan Rosenfeld.\n\t\n\n\tUTA brokered the deal.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBeauty is pain — that’s a saying that has echoed across generations while being lobbed at women and femme-presenting people. Now in his latest FX series, “The Beauty,” Ryan Murphy and co-creator Matt Hodgson are addressing the real price of aesthetics. Adapted to television from Jeremy Haun and Jason A. Hurley’s comic of the same name, the horror thriller grapples with the cost of perfection and how unbridled greed and power contribute to the instability of our present-day society. “The Beauty” is a frenzied ride that will undoubtedly endear audiences at times and have them begging to get off at others.\n\t\n\n\t“The Beauty” opens at a fashion show in Paris. Ruby (Bella Hadid) steps onto the runway and into the spotlight. However, she is neither poised nor focused. Instead, she’s dazed and sweating profusely. Losing control, she embarks on a violent and blood-filled tirade. Unfortunately, the incident with Ruby is not an anomaly; it’s just one of many recent gruesome displays involving supermodels globally. As a result, FBI Agents Cooper Madsen (Evan Peters) and Jordan Bennett (Rebecca Hall) find themselves holed up at a Hyatt in the City of Lights, determined to uncover the root cause of the incident. What they uncover is a sexually transmitted virus that begins as an injectable drug, transforming people into the most physically perfect version of themselves. This is very similar to the black market drug at the center of Coralie Fargeat’s 2024 body-horror epic, “The Substance,” starring Kutcher’s ex-wife, Golden Globe winner Demi Moore. The main difference in the medication is that The Substance allows a younger, more perfect version of a person to emerge, splitting the user into two separate entities. Meanwhile, the injection in “The Beauty” transforms the consumer from the inside out.”\n\t\n\n\t​Capitalism is typically where the rot begins in society, as is true in the world of “The Beauty.” The mastermind behind this virus of perfection is a maniacal Elon Musk-type figure who has dubbed himself The Corporation (Ashton Kutcher). Fixated on amassing even more wealth, The Corporation obsesses over monetizing his “miracle drug” turned STI at any cost. His weapon of choice is The Assassin (Anthony Ramos), a hired hit man deployed to quell any investigations into the new biotech before they start. Kusher is perfectly cast in the role, mirroring the mannerisms and obsessions of our real-life trillionaires and billionaires. Meanwhile, in Indianapolis, basement dweller Jeremy (Jeremy Pope, oddly miscast for the role) descends further and further into the black hole of incel culture when he accidentally stumbles upon a lifeline.\n\n\t​“The Beauty” is a ton of fun until it isn’t. The build-up of the first several episodes spans everything from a secret romance to The Corporation’s detailed backstory. The body horror depicted in the 11-episode first season is a sight to behold, from botched facelifts to the varied beauty births, the season is drowning in blood, guts, vomit and an abundance of other unseemly bodily fluids. What’s most visually unnerving is the painful, prolonged transformation people undergo after receiving their shot or catching the virus. It’s so grotesque that viewers possessing weak stomachs will want to look away.\n\n\tHowever, by Episode 8, “Beautiful Brothers,” and the umpteenth “beauty birth,” the story splinters into so many varied directions that audiences will likely get whiplash trying to keep up. Though the side stories showcased are, of course, relevant to the central narrative, they would be better reserved for later seasons of “The Beauty,” allowing the story to expand naturally, rather than continuing on a ride that should have ended hours ago.\n\n\tMurphy is known for camp, drama and over-the-top satire, but Episode 8 is also when “The Beauty” completely stops taking itself seriously. After getting a hold of the beauty shot, one non-Black character randomly transforms into a Black man. In explanation, the character’s father declares that he is 5% Nigerian. This moment begins the show’s downward spiral into the absurd. Additionally, though the cast is multi-racial, there is no true commentary about the white beauty standards illustrated here. As a non-white viewer, seeing those who have been deemed conventionally attractive or ideal is always interesting to unpack, but it’s never addressed here. Instead, it is skirted around, with a throwaway line on race.\n\t\n\n\t​Still, despite its mishaps and chaotic one-liners, “The Beauty” is a mostly enjoyable watch. Ranging from 24 to 50 minutes, the 11 episodes are highly engaging and digestible. It’s a series that dares to say a lot, while exploring the thrills of pretty privilege and the perils of beauty as a commodity, all amid the rise of GLP-1 use, social media addiction and a rampant lack of sexual education in America. Viewers will need to prepare themselves for this wild and imperfect journey, but they won’t walk away regretful.\n\n\tThe first three episodes of “The Beauty” are now streaming on Hulu and FX, with the remaining episodes streaming weekly on Wednesdays.\n",

    "description": "\n\tPaul Thomas Anderson had a strong visual sense of what he wanted “One Battle After Another” to look like.\n\n\tCinematographer Michael Bauman sat down ",
    "body": "\n\tPaul Thomas Anderson had a strong visual sense of what he wanted “One Battle After Another” to look like.\n\n\tCinematographer Michael Bauman sat down for Variety’s Inside the Frame and explained that the writer-director wanted something in the “vein of ‘70s cinema,” pointing to films like “The French Connection” and “The Last Detail.”\n\n\tBauman explains, “A lot of the movies in that period that had a certain stylistic roughness to it that he really felt was essential in telling this story. He also really wanted to shoot the movie in VistaVision.”\n\t\n\n\tVistaVision was developed in the early 1950s as an alternative to CinemaScope, offering filmgoers a new kind of spectacle in theaters. By the beginning of the 1960s, it had died out.\n\n\tAccording to Bauman, the format “was a response to television that some of the studios were developing. And instead of it being four-perf vertical, like a normal 35 millimeter camera, this takes the film and puts it eight-perf horizontal, which allows for a much bigger negative space. Each frame is twice the size. And so it’s a much richer image.”\n\n\tThe format was ideal for capturing some of the action sequences in “One Battle After Another,” particularly the captivating car chase.\n\n\tIn the film, Leonardo DiCaprio plays Bob Ferguson, a former revolutionary who must save his teenage daughter after she’s kidnapped by the merciless army officer, Colonel Lockjaw (played by Sean Penn). Teyana Taylor, Regina Hall, Benicio del Toro and Chase Infiniti also star.\n\n\tWhen Willa (Infiniti) is taken from the Sisters of the Brave Beaver compound by Lockjaw, she eventually escapes, stealing bounty hunter Avanti’s car and fleeing while being pursued by Tim Smith of the Christmas Adventurers. Ferguson follows close behind.\n\t\n\n\tBauman’s challenge was figuring out how to “blend the richness of VistaVision” and make “One Battle After Another “look like a ’70s type of film that felt like a lot of the scenes out of ‘The French Connection.'”\n\n\tHe says, “The idea behind the scene was how to create tension as these two cars are driving around.” \n\n\tFlorencia Martin, the film’s production designer, previously told Variety that the location was discovered as she returned from scouting in Blythe near the Arizona border. Martin came across what would become the epic setting of the car chase scene. \n\n\t“We were going back to Borrego Springs, and we all got on this road and instantly felt how special and magnetic and unique it was, to suddenly be dipping up and down through these hills,” Martin explained. “So then I studied the landscape all through Borrego Springs and Anza Borrego and pieced together the sequence.”\n\n\tWhat became clear was that the location’s unique topography allowed them to see the cars disappear — entering and exiting the frame — which Bauman says “was really critical to building how the two cars chase each other in the cat-and-mouse game on the way to the end.”\n\n\tHis other challenge was how to use the camera in that space. He used long lenses on the side of the road ranging from 1000mm to 1200mm to stack the cars up against each other as they popped over the hills.\n\n\t“We started working with a company out in Santa Clarita called Allan Padelford Camera Cars. I had worked with them previously on ‘Ford v Ferrari,’ and Allan Padelford is one of the old school masters of camera car usage,” Bauman says. “He’s developed numerous amounts of different types of systems that really benefited what we were trying to do.”\n\n\tBauman, camera operator Colin Anderson and key grip Tana Dubbe spent a day testing different systems. “It was really clear that while we were doing that — using wide lenses close to the ground, just a few inches off the surface of the road — was super effective for creating a dynamic sense of speed,” Bauman explains. “Even on our small monitors that we were looking at at the time, we could tell that was really going be some powerful stuff.”\n\n\tHe continues, “We were able to take that out onto the river of hills and really lean into all that emphasis of speed and scale. It just had an incredibly powerful effect when we saw it for the first time in dailies.”\n\t\n\n\tSince the setting involved an active road, Bauman notes, there was a “tremendous amount of traffic.” To pull it off, they had 10 minutes where they could lock the road down, set up the cars and race around in a safe environment for the crew.\n\n\tBauman also took the VistaVision camera — originally designed to work only on a tripod — and strapped it to the cars, mounting it on elaborate camera rigs to get it close to the ground and race alongside the action.\n\n\tThe cinematographer pushed VistaVision to its limits while using it and testing it. He says, “This camera system hadn’t really been used at this quantity of film because we shot about 1.5 million feet of film for the project. This camera system hadn’t had that kind of level of film run through it in a long time. And so that inherently had its own problems, especially when it’s vibrating along us — we’re going 70 miles an hour — and so we had to discover methods of working within the parameters that the camera would give us on any kind of day.”\n\n\tBauman adds, “It really underscores the power of shooting on film and what VistaVision is as far as projecting it. It’s really a super resting image that has a strong emotional feel to it. The ability to experience that by going to the theater is really unique.”\n\n\tWatch the video above.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJason Statham‘s upcoming action-thriller “Shelter” has launched a game experience in Fortnite ahead of the Ric Roman Waugh-directed film’s Jan. 30 theatrical release. \n\n\tThe game is 1–4 player co-op roguelike experience that places players alongside Statham’s “Shelter” character, former rogue assassin Michael Mason, on a remote island as a massive storm approaches. Their mission: hold off waves of enemy squads breaching the perimeter to protect Jessie (played in the film by Bodhi Rae Breathnach), hidden inside a reinforced lighthouse. \n\t\n\n\tDeveloped in collaboration with “Shelter” production company Black Bear Pictures, creative agency Sawhorse and Chartis Interactive and made in consultation with popular Fortnite content creator Jayth, the “Shelter” experience features original voice recording by Statham.\n\n\n\tPer Sawhorse, key gameplay features include:\n\n\nPersistent Progression: A “cash” system allows for permanent upgrades and skill trees that carry over between runs.\nThe Rebirth System: A unique mechanic that rewards players for resetting progress to gain powerful permanent buffs.\nWeaponry RNG: A dog from the film gives players random good or bad weapons to help with their quest. Players can upgrade their “RNG” to get better luck throughout the game.\n\n\n\n\tThe “Shelter” experience is available now in Fortnite via the Island Code: 2883-8391-6703.\n\n\tIn connection with the game’s launch, a creator-led showcase and community tournament will run through the film’s Jan. 30 release featuring streamers including AussieAntics, Grxnt, BushCampDad, LittlestSnail and OliverOG compete in “The Shelter Speedrun” for the highest global score.\n\n\t“Shelter” marks the latest film or TV series to debut an interactive experience in Fortnite to promote the project’s release. However, the game is distinct from an official partnership with Fortnite creator Epic Games, which recently teamed with Quentin Tarantino for a “Kill Bill” project, and instead made by third party developers using Epic’s Unreal Engine for Fortnite tool.\n\t\n\n\t“We wanted to create an experience that ignites and celebrates the Fortnite community in a way that honors the authenticity of the film,” Sawhorse Productions co-founder and chief innovation officer Nic Hill said. “By working with native Fortnite creators and Jason himself, we can reach gamers and get people excited to see the movie, or replay their favorite parts in an immersive way.”\n\n\tWatch the trailer for the “Shelter” Fortnite game and Statham’s promo for the new experience in the videos below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDuetti, a catalog acquisition company that works with independent artists, announced that it has secured $200 million in new funding to “accelerate music catalog acquisitions and expand its technology and services globally,” according to the announcement. The financing is led by a $50 million Series C equity investment by Raine Partners, alongside a second $125 million private securitization and a $25 million increase of an existing credit facility.\n\t\n\n\tOver the past three years, the company has raised over $635 million, including over $100 million in equity, and has partnered with more than 1,100 artists, songwriters, and other music creators to purchase and manage portions of their music rights catalogs.\n\n\n\tAccording to the announcement, the funds will be used to expand Duetti’s technology infrastructure, enhance marketing services, and grow its global presence. The company says it is currently signing more than 80 deals each month and expanding into publishing rights, in addition to master recording rights. The company also provides marketing and catalog management services. In connection with the equity financing, Joe Puthenveetil, Partner at The Raine Group, will join the Duetti Board of Directors.\n\n\n\t“The traditional music industry and the financially driven catalog buyout funds are not able to keep pace and adapt their infrastructure to the explosive growth of the independent music sector,” said Lior Tibon, CEO and Co-Founder of Duetti. “This new funding allows us to continue building proprietary databases and systems to identify, predict, and effectively manage and support music catalogs of independent creators, the fastest growing and most exciting segment of the industry.”\n\t\n\n\t“We are excited to partner with Lior and team as they develop a next-generation music company that empowers independent creators. Duetti has democratized the industry by enabling artists at every stage of their careers to monetize their rights and access the marketing and growth resources offered by a modern label and publisher,” said Joe Puthenveetil and Fred Davis, partners at The Raine Group.\n",

And Alex pre-emptively chose option 2 ... with Michelle agreeing, brushing off any potential sex talk, light-heartedly saying that might be \"sad.\"\n      \n\n          Hopefully, Michelle was just joking -- and hubby Barack wasn't listening!\n      \n    \n          But, enough about the no-sex talk ... Michelle and Alex had a robust discussion on a wide-range of themes, including planning playdates with her daughters, Malia and Sasha, when the girls were young and living in the White House between 2009 and 2017.\n      \n    \n          Alex also chatted with Michelle about how a woman can get elected president in the United States, as well as the intense scrutiny Michelle was under as First Lady.\n      \n    \n          At one point, they turned to the subject of Trump possibly running for a third term ... and Michelle made it clear that's not on the table for Barack!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Michelle Obama\n              \n                          \n                Alex Cooper\n              \n                          \n                Donald Trump\n              \n                          \n                Barack Obama\n              \n                          \n                Sasha Obama\n              \n                          \n                Malia Obama\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Podcasts\n              \n                          \n                Sex\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

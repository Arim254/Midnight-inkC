    "body": "\n\tAMC Theatres is releasing 1977’s “Annie Hall” and 2003’s “Something’s Gotta Give” to 100 cinemas nationwide in tribute to the late Diane Keaton, Variety has confirmed. Screenings will run for one week, starting on Friday.\n\n\tKeaton died on Oct. 11 in Los Angeles after being rushed from her home to the hospital. The Oscar winner was 79.\n\n\t“Annie Hall” earned Keaton her first Oscar nomination for best actress in a leading role. Starring alongside her long-time paramour and creative collaborator Woody Allen, the film became widely considered among the best of her career and one of the most revered comedies of all time. The film follows Allen as Alvy Singer, who, in a surreal retelling, examines his failed relationship with nightclub singer Annie Hall, played by Keaton.\n\t\n\n\t“Something’s Gotta Give,” which earned Keaton her fourth Oscar nomination for lead actress, was a box office smash upon its 2003 release, grossing $265 million worldwide against a budget of $80 million. Much like “Annie Hall,” the Nancy Meyers directorial boasted an A-list cast and tackled love and relationships in a nostalgic, romanticized cadence. The film follows Jack Nicholson as Harry Sanborn, an aging womanizer who falls for his much younger girlfriend’s mother, portrayed by Keaton, while vacationing together in the Hamptons.\n\n\tKeaton also earned Oscar noms for best lead actress for her roles in 1982’s “Reds” and 1997’s “Marvin’s Room.” Her other notable credits include “The Godfather,” “Father of the Bride” and “Baby Boom.”\n\n\tTributes from Hollywood poured out on Saturday upon news of Keaton’s death. Allen broke his silence on his most beloved co-star in a Sunday night essay posted to The Free Press. He wrote, “It’s grammatically incorrect to say ‘most unique,’ but all rules of grammar, and I guess anything else, are suspended when talking about Diane Keaton. Unlike anyone the planet has experienced or is unlikely to ever see again, her face and laugh illuminated any space she entered.”\n\t\n\n\tMeyers also paid tribute to her star in an Instagram post on Monday. Along with a photo of Keaton, the Oscar-nominated director wrote, “As a woman, I lost a friend of almost 40 years – at times over those years, she felt like a sister because we shared so many truly memorable experiences. As a filmmaker, I’ve lost a connection with an actress that one can only dream of.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBill Nye the Science Guy is adding TV guest star to his already impressive resume. The science icon and advocate will appear as himself on Tuesday’s episode of “High Potential” on ABC.\n\n\tNye will offer his science knowledge to help out “High Potential” star Kaitlin Olson’s character Morgan Gillory in a “Morgan Vision,” guiding her one step closer to solving the episode’s case. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn Season 1, Gillory was a janitor at the LAPD but become a full-time consultant after solving a murder case and impressing everyone with her IQ of 160. The show premiered in the fall of 2024 and was renewed for a second season in January ahead of the season finale. It was a hit at ABC and averaged 16 million viewers per episode, with the series premiere racking up more than 30 million views by the time it was renewed.\n\t\n\n\tNye is best known for hosting the popular educational program “Bill Nye the Science Guy” in the ’90s. Since then, he’s also had a Netflix series titled “Bill Nye Saves the World” and a Peacock show “The End Is Nye.” He’s appeared on other shows like “The Big Bang Theory,” “The Masked Singer,” “Dancing With the Stars,” “Blindspot” and more.\n\n\n\tAlong with Olson, “High Potential” also stars Daniel Sunjata, Javicia Leslie, Deniz Akdeniz as, Amirah J, Matthew Lamb and Judy Reyes. The show is based on the French series “Haut Potentiel Intellectuel (HPI).” Drew Goddard developed the series for American television and serves as executive producer via Goddard Textiles along with Sarah Esberg. Todd Harthan serves as showrunner and executive producer. Olson is a producer on the series in addition to starring. 20th Television produces, with Harthan currently under an overall deal at the studio.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“I get along without you very well,” sings Nina Simone in her beautiful, grazed voice at a pivotal moment in Isabel Coixet‘s “Three Goodbyes,” a glimmering drama adapted from a short story collection by celebrated Italian writer and activist Michela Murgia. Lit equally by a radiant Alba Rorhwacher and by a sweet but never saccharine presentiment of future nostalgia (Murgia’s 2023 book was published just months before she died of cancer at 51), the film earns the lovely song fully. It too, is a funny, rueful valentine to the fine art of the farewell — the smaller ones that litter our lives and the big final one at the end. \n\t\n\n\tThe first goodbye, however, is pretty banal even if, when it happens, it is fairly catclysmic for the lovers it separates. Returning home from some opening or other one evening, Marta (Rohrwacher) and her partner Antonio (Elio Germano) get into an apparently familiar argument — more of a tiff really — that for some reason this time escalates towards a different end, with Antonio moving out. In the period of mutual mourning that follows, restaurateur Antonio throws himself into his work, while high school gym teacher Marta comes home to a dripping tap in her empty apartment and spreads ketchup on crackers for dinner. Her sister (Silvia D’Amico) and her friends worry about her. Marta worries gently about herself, in particular about her disordered eating and loss of appetite. But mostly she goes about self-healing in amusingly whimsical ways, having bickering one-sided conversations with a slightly soiled full-sized cardboard cut-out of a K-pop star she pulls out of the trash one day, and posting anonymous one-star online reviews of Antonio’s otherwise popular and successful restaurant. \n\t\n\n\tDP Guido Michelotti’s 35mm camerawork is pretty but not overly romantic, except perhaps when it catches the sun flattering Marta’s fabulous halo of artfully messy blonde hair. But its warmth cues a kind of cosiness that is abruptly interrupted when Marta gets an unexpectedly devastating diagnosis from her doctor (Sarita Choudrey). \n\n\tIn other hands, this would cue a standard disease-of-the-week weepie, but Coixet keeps the tone lightly wistful and wise, and trains her attention ever more minutely on Rohrwacher, who along with her character, seems to blossom gradually under this steady gaze. Every personality is an iceberg — 90% of each is underwater — but sometimes a shock to the system can reveal one’s hidden depths to the world, and to the person herself.\n\n\tSo it is with Marta, who in the months following the grim news gets distracted from her various stages of grief by small dramas happening to and around her, through which she gradually begins to re-engage with the world: re-establishing a friendship with Antonio; catching the eye of a charmingly flustered colleague (Francesco Carril); and perceptively, non-judgmentally intervening in the self-harming habits of two of her students. It’s as though the light at sunset suddenly illuminates colors she might not otherwise have seen in the ordinary vistas of the everyday world, which is observed by the sensitive screenplay, adapted by Coixet and Enrico Audenino, in grounded little bits of business that feel directly lifted from normal experience. Connoisseurs of real-things-we-rarely-see-happening-in-movies will enjoy, for example, the way that Marta obtains the three bowls that become a symbol of her appetite for life (the title of Murgia’s book translates to “Three Bowls: Rituals for a Year of Crisis”) not in some deep, meaningful way, but as a points reward on her local supermarket’s loyalty card.\n\n\tThere’s an agreeable chattiness to certain scenes, with characters dropping witty aphorisms into their conversation like “I am not brave enough to turn down an invitation from people I don’t like.” But the film is most moving in its quieter moments, when the longest and most painful goodbye mellows into something like acceptance, tinged with gratitude for the moments that remain to be lived. Rohrwacher’s uncanny ability to make even the most internalized moment of self-revelation unusually interesting to watch has seldom been better used than in the glimpses that we sometimes get here, of a reserve of inner calm so immense it feels like it must spill over from this life into the next. \n\t\n\n\tThat might sound maudlin and kind of twee, but it really shouldn’t. To wonder, every now and then, how you will be thought of after you’re gone is useful and instructive for the type of person you want to be while you’re still here. At some point in the future, hopefully not soon but doubtless sooner than you’d like, the whole world will get along without you very well — except sometimes. And that’s when you must hope you’ll have lived a life like the one celebrated with such quiet, absorbing eloquence in “Three Goodbyes”: one that will be remembered with love.\n",

    "body": "\n\tZoe Saldaña said in an interview with Beyond Noise that James Cameron is “considering a documentary about the making” of the “Avatar” movies, which the Oscar-winning actor is keen on because it will “finally give us a chance to explain, in a meticulous way, why performance capture is the most empowering form of acting.”\n\n\t“It gives us the credit, the ability to own 100 percent of our performance on screen,” said Saldaña, who has long been a champion of motion capture acting and has been outspoken about award bodies such as the Oscars needing to consider it. “With animation, you might go into the studio for [a few] sessions; that’s as much as they’ll need you for the whole movie. You go into a studio, however you’re dressed, and you lend your voice, right? Performance capture means that ‘Avatar’ wouldn’t exist if Sigourney Weaver, Sam Worthington, Stephen Lang, Kate Winslet, myself, and the entire cast didn’t get up and put those dots on our faces.”\n\t\n\n\t“We put on that little unitard with all those dots on it, and step into a volume – that’s what we call the set – that’s rigged on the ceiling, with all these cameras in measured positions,” she added. “They’re all pointing into this space that finds us, and feeds that information into the system that is Pandora.”\n\n\n\tSaldaña plays Neytiri in the “Avatar” films, which include 2009’s “Avatar,” 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water” and the upcoming “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Cameron intends to make two more “Avatar” movies.\n\n\t“It takes an average of seven years between [each ‘Avatar’ film],” Saldaña said. “From the archery, the martial arts, the free diving, the scuba diving – so that you can hold your breath under water for longer than five minutes – to the language [James] conceived out of thin air, to physically training with former gymnasts, circus performers, and acrobats so you can learn how to walk like an extraterrestrial human species… That’s all us, and a group of incredible stunt actors that make our characters feel bionic. God bless them. With the technology that Jim creates, he gives the artist the power of complete ownership.”\n\t\n\n\tSaldaña spoke to The Independent last year and called out the Oscars for continuing to snub motion capture performances. Be it the actors in the “Avatar” movies or Andy Serkis’ acclaimed motion capture work as Gollum in “The Lord of Rings” and Caesar in “Planet of the Apes,” motion capture acting has yet to break into the Oscar races.\n\n\t“Old habits die hard, and when you have old establishments, it’s really hard to bring forward change,” Saldaña said on the topic. “And I understand that, so I’m not bitter about it, but it is quite deflating when you give 120% of yourself into something. I mean, not winning is ok, not being nominated is ok, but when you’re overlooked and then minimized and completely disregarded…”\n\n\tCameron told Variety as part of a Saldaña cover story last year that the Oscars are overdue to recognize her work as Neytiri in the “Avatar” franchise. \n\n\t“I’ve worked with Academy Award-winning actors, and there’s nothing that Zoe’s doing that’s of a caliber less than that,” the director said. “But because in my film she’s playing a ‘CG character,’ it kind of doesn’t count in some way, which makes no sense to me whatsoever. She can go from regal to, in two nanoseconds, utterly feral. The woman is ferocious. She is a freaking lioness.”\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” opens in theaters Dec. 19 from Disney and 20th Century Studios.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter becoming the biggest Kickstarter funding draw ever for a horror features, “Shelby Oaks” certainly evinces popular YouTuber Chris Stuckmann’s love of the genre. But while imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, it isn’t necessarily the most rewarding for others to watch. This mix of found-footage, missing-person, demonic-possession and other stock narrative hooks too often feels like a compendium of ideas from other movies Frankenstein’d together, with too little effort put towards finding a personality of its own. \n\t\n\n\tIn theaters from Neon on Oct. 24, over a year after premiering at 2024’s Fantasia Film Festival, the film should scare up decent interest from fans eager for Halloween season thrills. But it’s not a terribly promising, let alone memorable, start to what one assumes is intended as a franchise. Instead it feels more like the kind of watchable but mediocre entry you typically get when a series runs out of creative inspiration. \n\n\n\tStuckmann began posting film reviews on YouTube in 2009, racking up over two million subscribers while gradually moving more towards an identity as a filmmaker himself. Though his online presence demonstrates a wider viewing range, “Oaks” has the deja vu air of someone who’s watched almost nothing save fairly mainstream horror their whole life. Which is not an inherently bad thing… but, as yet, this writer-director hasn’t developed the style or finesse to make well-worn ideas feel fresh again. \n\n\tThe opening stretch here is in faux-documentary mode, as we get the mysterious backstory on one Riley Brennan (Sarah Dunn). With three friends, she had a YouTube channel dubbed “Paranormal Paranoids” where they investigated alleged supernatural phenomena. Its modest following often dismissed those posts as fakes, presuming the quartet staged spooky stuff for clicks. But that attitude changed when all four disappeared in 2008, while staying overnight in a titular Ohio ghost town not far from their homes. There is extant footage of a Riley in a room, terrified by loud noises just outside, then never returning after she tremulously dares to investigate. \n\t\n\n\tThe mutilated bodies of her three companions are eventually found. But 12 years later, her own fate remains unknown — a source of fascinated public speculation, and personal obsession for Riley’s older sister Mia (Camille Sullivan). The latter is just wrapping up a related interview when there’s a knock on her door. Upon being greeted, the disheveled man outside abruptly shoots himself in the head. It emerges he’s an ex-con who’d been incarcerated at Shelby Oaks’ sinister, now-shuttered penitentiary. He dies clutching a video Mia decides to keep and watch, rather than surrendering to police. That cassette makes it clear that the disturbed Wilson Miles (Charlie Talbert) played some unpleasant role in whatever happened to Riley and company.\n\n\tYet Mia isn’t convinced he committed any dire deeds alone, per se. To the dismay of her husband (Brendan Sexton III), she fixates on finding some deeper, yea darker truth — one suggesting a supernatural evil behind not just her sister’s disappearance, but once-populous Shelby Oaks’ slow extinction. \n\n\tThere are decently unsettling moments as Mia’s quest leads her to poke around a decrepit former amusement park, the empty prison and other sites. But we never feel anything more than routine genre buttons are being pushed as she suspects something lurking in the shadows behind her for the 90th time. And it’s downright silly when she is menaced by glowing-eyed “hellhounds.” \n\n\tWhile the filmmaking itself is not atmospheric or distinctive enough to help, a core problem is that Stuckmann’s script (from a story conceived with wife Samantha Elizabeth) comes off as a checklist of horror conventions rather than something that’s building its own original mythology. It’s hard not to groan upon discovering these events take place in “Darke County,” or hearing the humorlessly cornball dialogue that guest-star actors Keith David (as an ex-warden) or Michael Beach (a police detective) get stuck with.\n\n\tNone of this is boring, but it is perilously generic. Things do get more interesting when Mia stumbles upon an improbable house in the middle of the woods, occupied by a witchy old lady (Robin Bartlett). But this climactic sequence, too, is redolent of too many other films to name, as is a final stretch where the apparent resolution to the sisters’ travails turns out to be something else. \n\t\n\n\tStarting off with quasi-found footage, the movie initially asks its performers to convince as “real” people caught on camera — a ruse that doesn’t work, then hobbles the cast from convincing us once “Oaks” adopts a more conventional storytelling style. It’s not really their fault that they fail to sell material that demands near-constant expressions of fear, yet almost always feels like formulaic second-hand goods. \n\n\tPresumably the involvement of executive producer Mike Flanagan kicked up overall polish a notch or two. The results are respectable given budgetary limits. There are passable jump scares, plus some quease-inducing locations, effectively exploited by production designer Christopher Hare and cinematographer Andrew Scott Baird. A loud score attributed to both James Burkholder and The Newton Brothers keeps telling us to be very, very frightened. Still, while diverting enough as a whole, “Shelby Oaks” feels too much like horror cosplay to truly get under the skin. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTo write or not to write?\n\n\tCBS News staffers were grappling with conflicting orders Monday, according to three people familiar with the matter, after some producers at the Paramount Skydance news unit urged reporters and journalists to respond to an eyebrow-raising memo from new Editor in Chief Bari Weiss that drew criticism last week from the Writers Guild of America. In the memo, Weiss asked staffers to tell her “how you spend your working hours” and what they thought of CBS News, so that she and editorial employees could be  “aligned on achieving a shared vision for CBS News.”\n\t\n\n\tWithin hours of the memo surfacing, the WGA counseled union members at CBS News not to answer the missive until CBS provided more details on what its purpose was, including whether their replies could serve as “a basis for discipline, discharge, or layoff.”\n\n\n\tWeiss was named editor in chief at CBS News last week by Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, and CBS News staffers have been roiled since that time. Weiss, a digital entrepreneur and opinion writer who built The Free Press, has no experience running a mainstream TV-news outlet, and little history in helping traditional journalists navigate the challenges to finding facts. She has a direct line to Ellison, while Tom Cibrowski, a former ABC executive who came aboard as CBS News president earlier this year, has been tasked with working alongside Weiss and lending his expertise.\n\n\tCBS News declined to make executives available for comment. \n\n\tThe Paramount news drama takes place as most employees are fearful they are about to lose their jobs. Paramount executives have said they intend to cut the company’s workforce significantly in order to trim costs. Details on staff layoffs are expected to be revealed by Paramount’s next earnings report.\n\t\n\n\tOne person familiar with the newsroom said staffers were dealing with “mass confusion,” because they have been urged by some of their superiors to file notes to Weiss, and their union has told them the exact opposite. Some producers are not covered by a union contract at CBS News and may feel pressure to get employees to follow the new boss’ orders, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\tThere is good reason to shake up CBS News. The division has suffered through a parade of senior executives over the last few years, none of them able to buck recent trends and gain more traction for weekday standards “CBS Evening News” and “CBS Mornings,” which continue to rest in third place when compared with time-slot competitors from NBC News and ABC News. At the same time, CBS News already enjoys a hard-won trust with a large set of viewers, and its “CBS Sunday Morning” and “60 Minutes” are some of the best known news brands on TV.  Among U.S. adults who have at least some trust in the information they get from national news organizations, according to Pew Research Center, 51% trust CBS News. Only ABC News and NBC News have more trust among this group, and CBS News is on par with both CNN and PBS.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRockmond Dunbar, an actor on the TV series “9-1-1,” is set to go trial on Tuesday over his claim that he was fired due to his religious beliefs, which forbade him from getting the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\tDunbar’s character, Michael Grant, was written off the show in November 2021, a month after studios began requiring COVID-19 vaccines for actors and others on set. Dunbar asserts that he is a member of the Congregation of Universal Wisdom, which holds that it is sinful to inject chemicals that “defy natural law.” \n\t\n\n\tDisney‘s 20th Television argues that Dunbar came up with a phony religious excuse to avoid complying with the vaccine mandate. During pre-trial investigation, the company’s lawyers discovered that Dunbar had taken other drugs, including steroids for shoulder pain, and had been getting regular injections of synthetic testosterone from “The Man Clinic” since 2018.\n\n\n\tThe trial is a vivid reminder of the COVID era, when Hollywood unions negotiated complex safety protocols, including frequent testing and different distancing and masking requirements for different production zones. \n\n\tMany had long since grown tired of the rules by the time they were discarded in 2023.\n\n\tAt trial, Disney’s lawyers will seek to avoid re-litigating the COVID protocols. According to an exhibit prepared for jurors, they will say that they respect Dunbar’s personal choice. But the issue, they will argue, is whether that choice arose from a sincere religious belief. \n\n\tUnder the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for employees’ religious practices.\n\t\n\n\tThe Congregation of Universal Wisdom was founded by Dr. Walter Schilling, a New Jersey chiropractor, in 1975. Members have long used the church’s teachings to avoid school vaccination requirements.\n\n\tSchilling, 82, was expected to testify at the trial, but recently indicated he is too ill to travel to Los Angeles. Instead, his depositions are expected to be played for the jury. \n\n\tSchilling testified that the church does not have a place of worship or regular meetings. Members can join by submitting an application and a fee.\n\n\t“A lot of people in the general public hold our beliefs but then they don’t have a place to go to verify those beliefs,” Schilling said. “So what has happened when they started mandating things, it incentivized people to actually join the church.”\n\n\tHe also said that it would be “sacrilege” to inject oneself with synthetic testosterone, or any other prescription drug. \n\n\tDunbar’s lawyers have argued that the actor holds a “nuanced” set of beliefs that melds CUW with the teachings of Buddhism and African Yoruba faith.\n\n\t“Since at least 2014, Plaintiff has held sincere religious beliefs that prevent him from receiving vaccines because he believes they will tether his soul to earth, thereby preventing him from ascending to be with God after his death,” his attorneys argued in a pre-trial memo.\n\n\tDunbar and his wife, Maya, are also expected to testify, as is “9-1-1” showrunner Tim Minear.\n\n\tDunbar’s lawyers have argued that he does not need to be a perfect adherent to CUW practices in order for his beliefs to be protected. \n\n\tDunbar has said he is “not against western medicine that is made with God’s consent or that does not cloud my communication with God.”\n\n\tDuring discovery, Dunbar failed to turn over most of his medical records to Disney’s lawyers. The attorneys ultimately obtained records from 44 providers, including Dr. Fong of The Man Clinic. Fong had been providing him twice-weekly testosterone injections, as well as injections of anastrozole, a chemotherapy drug intended to prevent breast growth, which can be a side effect of testosterone.\n\n\tJudge Dolly Gee faulted Dunbar for “egregious” failures to disclose evidence.\n\n\tDunbar’s lawyers sought to block use of Dunbar’s medical records at trial, arguing they were irrelevant, but the judge disagreed.\n\t\n\n\t“Dunbar’s medical records include behavior that is contrary to the tenets of the CUW religion,” she wrote. “This evidence is relevant to a credibility determination of whether Dunbar’s beliefs are sincere or merely opportunistic.”\n\n\tAsked in his deposition how he had determined that the vaccine was against his belief system, while other interventions are permissible, Dunbar said he “spoke to God.” \n\n\t“I believe God told everybody in this world, before they sat down or as they sat down to receive the shot, to not get it,” Dunbar said. “And they chose to do it. So that was their spiritual test, and they failed.”\n\n\tGee previously rejected many of Dunbar’s other legal claims, but left it up to a jury to decide whether his religious beliefs are sincerely held. Efforts to settle the case before trial were unsuccessful.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJackie Burch, a casting director known for her work in “Die Hard,” “Sixteen Candles,” and “The Breakfast Club” died on Oct. 12 in Atlanta. She was 74. \n\n\tBurch’s family said that Burch died after a four month battle with endometrial cancer. “We are heartbroken and in shock at the prospect of living without our vibrant, charming, funny, special, and incredibly loving mom. Her generous spirit touched so many lives – professionally and personally – and we are endlessly proud of the legacy she leaves behind,” her family wrote in a statement.\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Newburgh, N.Y., Burch began her career in Los Angeles as a deaf education teacher. While subbing for an assistant who worked for an executive at Universal, Burch became interested in the film industry. She began her casting career in the early 1980s, where she served as the casting director for features such as “Psycho II,” “Forbidden World,” “DC Cab,” and “Smokey and the Bandit Part 3.”\n\n\n\tBurch became a frequent collaborator with director John Hughes, where she oversaw casting for “Sixteen Candles,” “The Breakfast Club” and “Weird Science.”\n\n\tBurch worked on various films throughout the 1980s  such as “The Running Man,” “Dick Tracy,”  “Coming to America,” “Three Amigos,” “Mask,” “42,” “Hot Shots! Part Deux and Mafia.” In 1988, Burch cast Bruce Wills as John McClane in “Die Hard,” which grossed over $143 million in the global box office. Burch went on to cast its 1990 sequel “Die Hard 2.”\n\n\tThroughout the 2010s, Burch oversaw the casting for “The Hunger Games” series, “Iron Man 3,” “Hidden Figures,” and “Bessie.” Her final project, “This Is the One They’ll Remember Me By” will be released in 2026.\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to her work as a casting director, Burch was an active member of Casting Society and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. \n\n\tBurch is survived by her daughters Samy, a screenwriter and Molly, a former singer-songwriter; sons-in-laws Alex Mechanik and Dailey Toliver, and her twin sister, Janice Papolos.\n",

    "body": "\n\tProvo, Utah-based FilmQuest, already one of the buzziest genre film festivals, has the unique opportunity to step up with an even bigger footprint in the state when its industry big brother, Park City-based Sundance, heads to Colorado after its 2026 edition.\n\n\t“The city of Provo is fully going to back us moving forward to becoming the premier festival in the state, and possibly the region,” FilmQuest founder and festival director Jonathan Martin says. “We’ve got some friends in the legislature that we’ve cultivated over the years that we’re going to be talking to and establishing that voice and community here.” \n\t\n\n\tFilmQuest, specializing in fantasy, horror, sci-fi and beyond, launched in 2014 when Martin, a filmmaker himself, envisioned a festival that felt truly independent.\n\n\n\t“We’re not setting up deals with distributors, streamers and studios to showcase their films that they’re already planning to release anyway,” Martin says. “We want to celebrate discoveries and find the voices of tomorrow.” \n\n\tAdditionally, as the team behind FilmQuest began to find the festival’s identity, it hit its stride as a different kind of fest.\n\n\t“We really are this rock ‘n’ roll-vibe event,” Martin says. “You’re going to come to the festival and rub shoulders with everybody. Nobody’s off into a black limousine in the night. You’re going to come in, meet everybody that’s there, and potentially make a relationship there. For example, Sean Gunn was here a couple years ago and he’s just hanging out with everybody, exchanging phone numbers with people that he’s meeting right there, filmmakers that are up-and-coming and hungry. We’re all getting along and more relaxed.”\n\t\n\n\tMartin says that equity is essential for the festival.\n\n\t“All are welcome and there is no preconceived notion,” he says. “I don’t care if you are white, Black, Latino, Asian, LGBT — we’re all equal together in this. That’s what we’re doing here: To help you find those opportunities and also expand your network. And it’s not that we don’t take ourselves seriously, but it doesn’t feel like you’ve walked into a church and it’s all sanctimonious. This is very much something for people to feel welcome for what they created and who they are.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFilmQuest founder and director Jonathan Martin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJosh Tug\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis year’s features lineup includes plenty of wild loglines: A metal band battles cannibals (“Jump Scare”), a college kid tries to escape a killer barber (“Bad Haircut”) and a deadly health drink is brewed (“Kombucha”). \n\n\tAdditionally, FilmQuest emphasizes an unproduced screenplay competition and a robust selection of shorts. Its 2024 grand prize winner in shorts was this year’s Oscar-winning “I’m Not a Robot,” which reinforced the programmers’ intuition for quality storytelling. \n\n\t“A lot of these things are going to be dictated by our own personal taste,” Martin says. “I’m not going to say we bat 1000, but I think we bat .950. I think we do a very good job of identifying what are the very best of the independent genre feature films out there that are available to us, and the very best of the genre short films — as evidenced by the fact that our grand prize short film award winner ended up winning the Oscar last year. We’ve proven that.”\n\n\tOther activities during the fest encourage community building between filmmakers and fans, with plenty of mixers, industry labs taught by talent like “Quiet Place” writers Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, parties and special screenings — all of which showcase a different side of Provo than people expect.\n\n\t“There’s something for everybody,” Martin says. “It’s a launching pad for the most exciting and talented voices in genre cinema today that may or may not have been discovered.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2025 FilmQuest Poster\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of FilmQuest\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSAG-AFTRA has unveiled the launch of the union’s Verticals Agreement, a new media contract created for the needs of serialized micro and vertical dramas. \n\n\tThe agreement will cover various productions with budgets under $300,000, and offer protections and flexibility for creators, actors, and producers in SAG-AFTRA. \n\n\t“We’re thrilled to introduce an agreement that reflects the way today’s audiences consume content while ensuring performers are protected and supported. This agreement works for the realities of these productions — their pace, their budgets, and their creative ambitions, while upholding the union’s core standards of actor protections,” said Chief Negotiator and National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland in a press release. “Verticals are more than just a new format, they open up more opportunities for new stories to be told, reaching new audiences every single day.”\n\t\n\n\t“Our members are always on the lookout for good work opportunities. As technology develops and our industry looks for creative ways to engage audiences, new formats emerge,” said Crabtree-Ireland. “SAG-AFTRA perceives the advent of so-called “verticals” as an exciting new space. This fast-evolving format is catching on and we are here to support our performers as they pursue their craft and engage this new business model. By offering a contract that is tailored to the unique needs of these projects, our union is meeting the moment. As the business of verticals experiences substantial growth, so too will our relationship with the producers.”\n\t\n\n\tVariety reported last month that microdramas generated $819 million in revenues in 2024, with revenues projected to climb to $3.8 billion by decade’s end. In China, microdrama revenues are expected to surpass theatrical box office this year.\n\n\tThe vertical agreement will be available later this month for members in the SAG-AFTRA union.\n",

Greenberg, a 27-year-old Philly teacher, was found dead by her fiancé in 2011 ... she'd been stabbed 20 times in the back of her neck and head, with a knife protruding from her chest. Her death was initially ruled a homicide ... but after a meeting with Philly PD, assistant Medical Examiner Dr. Marlon Osbourne determined she died by suicide.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Fast-forward to February 2025 ... under pressure from Greenberg’s family, the medical examiner's office revisited the case ... and is maintaining the same manner of death.\n      \n\n          Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Lindsay Simon re-examined the case and, in a 32-page report released Oct. 10, concluded, \"while the distribution of injuries is admittedly unusual, the fact remains that Ellen would be capable of inflicting these injuries herself.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The Philadelphia Inquirer reports Simon discovered 20 more bruises on Greenberg's body, and three more “perforations in the skin” that hadn't been documented in the original autopsy ... but still ruled her death a suicide.\n      \n    \n          The decision is definitely stirring the pot again ... people are asking the obvious -- how does someone stab themselves over and over in the back and head and call it suicide?\n      \n    \n          TMZ reached out to the Medical Examiner for an explanation on how they think Ellen could’ve done it herself ... so far, no word back.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Greenberg family attorney Joseph Podraza Jr.  tells TMZ ... “MEO Simon’s so-called 'independent review' of Ellen Greenberg’s death is a deeply flawed attempt to justify a predetermined conclusion. It includes false claims—like the assertion that a stab wound in Ellen’s spinal column was made during autopsy, a theory rejected by every credible expert, including the City’s own neuropathologist. By ignoring key evidence that contradicts suicide—the extensive 3D photogrammetry, a recreation which proves Ellen could not self-inflict all of the wounds, unexplained bruises, missing surveillance footage, an intact lock, accounts of a toxic relationship, etc.—Simon builds a flimsy case on distorted portrayals of Ellen’s mental health, propped up by cynical distortions of Ellen’s managed anxiety, a condition widely experienced daily by over 40 million Americans. Shame on you Simon.\"\n      \n    \n          Podraza continued ... \"This report is tripe, an embarrassment to the City, and an insult to Ellen and her family. Ellen’s family just wanted the truth. It is clear the truth will not come from Philadelphia’s law enforcement machinery. Though Ellen’s city turned its back on her, we will continue through other avenues to get justice for her murder, by any means necessary.”\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

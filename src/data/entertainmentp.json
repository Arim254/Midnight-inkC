    "body": "\n\tThe Tokyo Broadcasting System has made a strategic investment in Legendary Entertainment, the producer of “Dune” and the Godzilla franchise, that will allow the Hollywood company access to more Japanese intellectual property.\n\n\tTBS – which operates broadcast networks, streaming platforms, production studios and a broad entertainment portfolio – has acquired a $150 million minority ownership stake in Legendary, led by CEO Josh Grode and chief creative Mary Parent. Legendary leadership and Apollo Funds remain co-owners of the studio’s majority stake. The partnership is non-exclusive across content verticals. \n\t\n\n\t“For decades, TBS has played a central role working with all members of the creative ecosystem in Japan, from multiple publishers to animators to writers and artists. Its position within the local market presents exciting opportunities for collaboration. We look forward to working with TBS to broaden our relationships in Japan and to help expand the global reach of its rich IP to the rest of the world in a manner that respects and honors the talented creators,” said Grode.\n\n\n\tIncluded in the TBS portfolio is production shop The Seven (which has both Japanese and domestic offices), behind series including Netflix’s “Alice in Borderland” and “Yu Yu Hakusho.” Legendary’s slate is steeped in Japanese IP across both theatrical films and shows, including “Godzilla x Kong: Supernova,” “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters,” “Street Fighter,” which recently wrapped production and the previously produced “Pokémon: Detective Pikachu.” \n\t\n\n\tYayoi Nakatani, board director and chief growth officer of TBS Holdings, said he was “thrilled to partner with Legendary, a world-class studio with a remarkable track record of history-making global hits. Legendary’s exceptional creativity and their proven ability to build and expand IPs into worldwide franchises will be an indispensable driving force to our global strategy.”\n",

The structural pivot transforms the competition into a collective challenge where entire kitchens compete for pride and reputation, rather than individual culinary prowess.\n\t\n\n\tChef applications for Season 3 are via Netflix Korea’s social channels. Eligibility is restricted to four-person teams currently employed at the same restaurant. Individual submissions and cross-restaurant lineups will not be accepted, though restaurants operating under the same brand across multiple locations may enter as a unified team.\n\n\n\t“Culinary Class Wars” has maintained a presence in Netflix’s Global Top 10 Non-English TV rankings for two consecutive years. Season 2 drew particular notice for its intensified competitive dynamics, inventive rule structures and escalating stakes while retaining the franchise’s core appeal.\n\n\tStudio Slam returns to produce Season 3, reuniting the original creative team including producer Kim Eun-ji and writer Mo Eun-seol, who have been instrumental in shaping the series’ trajectory.\n\n\t“Thanks to the incredible support from viewers around the world through Season 2, we’re grateful to move forward with Season 3,” Kim said. “We’ll do our best to deliver an even more exciting format and entertainment that lives up to expectations.”\n\t\n\n\tThe first season was widely credited with revitalizing Seoul’s dining scene, which saw increased restaurant bookings and renewed interest in the city’s culinary talent.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\t“Daily Show” host Michael Kosta will play a different type of anchor on Tracy Morgan’s “The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins,” premiering on Jan. 18.\n\n\tKosta will guest star on the upcoming NBC comedy series as Brett Mann, the smug, self-important host of a “SportsCenter”-style show. (Kosta himself was a former professional athlete, and he he hosts the podcast “Tennis Anyone” and contributes to Tennis Channel.)\n\n\n\tMorgan leads “The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins” as a disgraced former football star on a mission to rehabilitate his image with acclaimed filmmaker Arthur Tobin (played by Daniel Radcliffe). On his climb back to greatness, Reggie is forced to confront the ghosts of his past. The cast also includes Erika Alexander as Monica — Reggie’s ex-wife, agent and business manager — plus Bobby Moynihan, Precious Way and Jalyn Hall. \n\t\n\n\t“Reggie Dinkins” will have an early premiere on Sunday, immediately following the Rams-Bears NFL game. The series will then return on Feb. 23 at 8 p.m. with an encore of the pilot, plus a new episode.\n\n\tThe series reunites Morgan with “30 Rock” creator Tina Fey, who serves as an executive producer on “Reggie Dinkins.” Robert Carlock and Sam Means are the co-showrunners and writers, and they executive produce alongside Morgan, Eric Gurian and David Miner.\n\n\tThe series is produced by Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group; Little Stranger, Inc.; 3 Arts Entertainment; Bevel Gears; Means Ends Production; and Streetlife Productions, Inc. \n\n\tKosta is an Emmy-winning comedian who sits behind the “Daily Show” desk on Comedy Central.

    "body": "\n\tPamela Anderson told Andy Cohen during an SiriusXM radio interview (via TMZ) that it was “yucky” being in such close proximity to Seth Rogen at the Golden Globes earlier this month. Rogen won two prizes at the ceremony for his Apple TV comedy “The Studio,” including best actor in a comedy series and best comedy series. Anderson has continued beef with Rogen after he executive produced and starred in Hulu’s “Pam & Tommy,” a 2022 limited series about Anderson’s tumultuous romance with Tommy Lee and how their unauthorized sex tape went public.\n\t\n\n\t“Seth Rogen… he did ‘Pam & Tommy’ without talking to me,” Anderson told Cohen. “I just felt like ugh. How can someone make a TV series out of difficult times in your life? And I am living, breathing human being over here.\n\n\n\t“He was in the pit at the Golden Globes. We were close. I felt like I’m not chopped liver over here. I felt weird about it,” Anderson continued about Rogen. “I’ve been so busy working. I’ve done 5 movies in the last year. Sometimes it hits you and you feel kind of down. It felt a little yucky. Eventually, hopefully, he will reach out to me to apologize, not that it matters. When you are a public person, they say you have no right to privacy. But your darkest, deepest secrets or tragedies should not be fair game for a TV series. That pissed me off a little bit.”\n\n\tAnderson concluded by saying that while she did not “make a beeline” for Rogen to address him directly, she did thinking about doing so “in my mind” where “I really told him what I thought.”\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety in 2023, Anderson said “assholes” were behind “Pam & Tommy” and added: “Salt on the wound. … You still owe me a public apology.” The show starred Lily James as Anderson, Sebastian Stan as Tommy Lee and Rogen as Rand Gauthier, the man responsible for steeling the couple’s sex tape. The series earned 10 Emmy nominations, including outstanding limited series, while Rogen, James and Rogen were all nominated for their performances.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlan Cumming has signed with UTA for representation in all areas, Variety has learned. He will continue to be repped by Bond Artists and by B-Side in the UK. \n\n\tAlthough Cumming has enjoyed a highly-successful career that spans over four decades, he has found remarkable success in the past few years as the host of the US version of the hit reality competition show “The Traitors.”  The show has already been renewed through Season 5 at Peacock, while an all-civilian season hosted by Cumming is set to air on NBC. \n\t\n\n\tCumming has twice won the Emmy Award for outstanding host for a reality or reality competition program, while the show has won two Emmys for outstanding reality competition program to date out of eight total Emmy wins. \n\n\n\tAs an actor, Cumming is known for starring in films like “Spy Kids,” “X2: X-Men United,” “Goldeneye,” “Romy and Michelle’s High School Reunion,” and “Glenrothan.” In television, he is known for roles in shows like “The High Life,” “The Good Wife,” “Sex and the City,” “Broad City,” “Doctor Who,” and “Schmigadoon.” \n\n\tOn the stage, Cumming has performed roles in “Hamlet,” “Cabaret,” and “Macbeth” as well as hosted the Tony Awards. He was recently named Artistic Director of Pitlochry Festival Theatre in his native Scotland.\n\n\tAside from his Emmy wins, Cumming has won two Tony Awards, a BAFTA Award, an Olivier Award, an Independent Spirit Award, and many other accolades. He received multiple Golden Globe and Emmy nominations for his role as Eli Gold in “The Good Wife.” To date, he has authored seven books, including his memoir “Not My Father’s Son.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tTaye Diggs is entering the vertical drama space, a growing industry around content made to be watched on smartphones. CandyJar, which bills itself as the first microdrama streaming platform out of the U.S., has set Diggs as the star and executive producer of a series titled “Off Limits & All Mine.” \n\n\tDiggs may be the first A-lister to appear in a project like this. Part of the success of vertical dramas — which have already generated billions of dollars of revenue in other countries, particularly in Asia — has to do with low production costs. As such, the burgeoning American microdrama industry has thus far been populated with working actors who make around $500 a day. But CandyJar hopes that involvement from someone like Diggs — beloved for roles in “The Best Man,” “How Stella Got Her Groove Back,” “Rent” and more — will add sheen to the format as a whole.\n\t\n\n\t“Off Limits & All Mine” (working title) is a romance starring Diggs as “a widower who takes in his best friend’s rebellious daughter and realizes that a dangerous and transformative connection is about to unfold,” per the official logline. The series will feature a Black ensemble; CandyJar says in a press release that it aims to “prove that Black-led romantic dramas belong at the center of the microdrama boom, not at its margins.” As such, CandyJar parent Inkitt is producing the series in partnership with Atlanta-based Freeli Films, which has made films for BET, Starz, Peacock and Amazon Prime Video.\n\n\n\tProduction on “Off Limits & All Mine” begins in Atlanta in February. Diggs’ frequent collaborator J. Carter serves as lead producer, with Troy Brookins executive producing and Alexandria Collins directing. \n\t\n\n\tFounded in 2013, Inkitt is a digital platform that uses AI to identify user-submitted stories that have potential for franchising. Selected stories are then moved to Galatea, the company’s pay-to-read app, or adapted into microdramas on CandyJar. Inkitt says that it has become “a hit-making engine now delivering a million-dollar success every seven days” and that CandyJar averages 70 million episodes streamed per month, more than 5.5 million users and an audience that spends an average of 40 minutes per day watching.\n\n\t“Microdramas are no longer experimental,” Inkitt’s director of production Lily Darragh Harty said in a statement. “Projects like this show that the format can support serious creative ambition, high production standards and top-tier talent, which is exactly the future CandyJar is building toward.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tManhattan’s Sunset Pier 94 Studios has found its first tenant ahead of the studio’s opening later this month. \n\n\tParamount Television Studios has signed the facility’s first lease to film Showtime’s “Dexter: Resurrection” Season 2. The series will take up 70,000 square feet, filming in two sound stages and occupying office space.\n\n\t“We are thrilled to bring the second season of ‘Dexter: Resurrection’ to Sunset Pier 94 Studios and its state-of-the-art facilities and sound stages,” said Drew Brown, EVP of production for Paramount TV. “Last season saw Dexter move to New York City – and now we look forward to following suit, gaining greater access to the region’s incredible creative talent, leveraging a competitive tax credit program and reinforcing our commitment to U.S. production.”\n\t\n\n\tSunset Pier 94 Studios features 232,000 square feet of leasable stages, production support space and offices. Located on the West Side Highway, it also boasts views of the Hudson River. With an ideal Manhattan location and New York’s recently expanded state tax credits, the studio hopes to entice Hollywood projects to keep production in the U.S. \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Sunset Studios’ success in attracting and retaining top-tier productions across multiple seasons speaks to the caliber of our studios and services, and we look forward to the opportunity to expand our relationship with Paramount on the lot,” said Victor Coleman, chairman and CEO of Hudson Pacific, a joint venture partner in the studio. “Robust pre-leasing interest in Sunset Pier 94 Studios underscores the project’s unmatched quality and prime location—there is truly nothing else like it in the market, and we look forward to announcing additional leases soon.” \n\t\n\n\tEmpire State Development president and CEO Hope Knight added: “Congratulations to Sunset Pier 94 Studios on booking the second season of Paramount Television Studios’ ‘Dexter: Resurrection.’ We’re proud that season one was filmed right here in New York, generating significant economic impact in our neighborhoods through jobs and small business spending. Governor Hochul’s expansion of the film production tax credit and initiatives like Production+ are incentivizing companies like Paramount Television Studios — which has filmed in New York for decades — to continue investing in our state. We look forward to welcoming more projects to Sunset Pier 94’s stages as this world-class facility opens its doors.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tKathleen Kennedy will end her 14-year run at Lucasfilm. She will be replaced by not one, but two executives when she leaves the Walt Disney Company this year. Chief Creative Officer Dave Filoni and President and General Manager Lynwen Brennan will both lead the company behind “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones” as it looks to recapture its stride. Filoni’s elevation had been widely expected, but Brennan’s promotion is something of a surprise. It suggests that Disney felt the need to pair a strong filmmaking force with someone with a firm sense of budgets and balance sheets. \n\t\n\n\tFiloni has been named president and chief creative officer, Lucasfilm, and Brennan has been named co-president. Their task will be to find ways to keep “Star Wars” fresh and relevant, as well as to deal with a fanbase that can be very vocal when it feels that a film or series is departing too drastically from the canon. Filoni and Brennan will report to Alan Bergman, co-chairman of Disney Entertainment.\n\n\n\tKennedy will continue to have a relationship with the company and will serve as producer of the studio’s next two theatrical films, “The Mandalorian and Grogu,” and “Star Wars: Starfighter,” which will hit theaters in 2026 and 2027. She will pursue other producing projects independently. \n\n\tIn a statement, Disney CEO Bob Iger, who is also expected to leave his role this year, praised Kennedy’s leadership.  “When we acquired Lucasfilm more than a decade ago, we knew we were bringing into the Disney family not only one of the most beloved and enduring storytelling universes ever created, but also a team of extraordinary talent led by a visionary filmmaker – someone who had been handpicked by George Lucas himself, no less,” Iger said. “We’re deeply grateful for Kathleen Kennedy’s leadership, her vision, and her stewardship of such an iconic studio and brand.”\n\t\n\n\tKennedy is a widely respected producer who worked closely with Steven Spielberg for many years, but her tenure at Lucasfilm has had both highs and lows. She helped select J.J. Abrams to direct 2015’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” which went on to earn more than $2 billion, successfully bringing the franchise back to the big screens. Its two sequels also were box office hits, as was “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” a spinoff adventure. \n\n\tHowever, 2018’s “Solo,” an attempt to look at the early years of Han Solo, failed at the box office and suffered from a chaotic production during which original directors, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, were fired and replaced with Ron Howard. Keeping filmmakers employed has been a consistent struggle for Kennedy, who has seen the likes of Patty Jenkins, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, and Taika Waititi announce “Star Wars” movies of their own that never materialized or were cancelled because of creative differences. That’s left Disney with a seven-year gap in “Star Wars” films, one that will be filled when “The Mandalorian and Grogu” opens in theaters this summer. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” a 2023 sequel to the long-running action action franchise, also failed at the box office.\n\n\tKennedy has helped “Star Wars” enter the world of streaming, producing hit shows such as “The Mandalorian” and critically acclaimed series such as “Andor.” A few of these faltered, however. “The Acolyte,” for instance, was canceled after one season.\n\n\tFiloni is a longtime veteran of Lucasfilm. He was selected by George Lucas in 2005 to build Lucasfilm’s animation studio and created its first series, “Star Wars: The Clone Wars,” and “Star Wars Rebels.” Filoni is the executive producer, episodic director and writer on some of the company’s live-action series, including “The Mandalorian” and “Ahsoka” and producer and writer of “The Mandalorian and Grogu.”\n\n\tBrennan joined Industrial Light & Magic in 1999, eventually becoming its president in 2009. She later became Lucasfilm’s president and general manager in 2024. She led the company’s business strategy and franchise and production operations and has overseen ILM’s expansion.\n\n\tPuck first reported Filoni and Brennan’s promotions. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothy Busfield will get a court hearing next Tuesday on whether he should be held in jail pending a trial on child sex abuse charges.\n\n\tBusfield remains at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Albuquerque after turning himself in on Tuesday. At a press conference on Thursday, D.A. Sam Bregman said is routine for his office to seek pre-trial detention in child sex abuse cases.\n\n\tBusfield, 68, faces three charges — two counts of criminal sexual contact with a child and one count of child abuse. The first two charges carry a maximum sentence of six years each, while the third carries a maximum of three years.\n\t\n\n\tBusfield is accused of groping a 7-year-old boy who was an actor on “The Cleaning Lady” in 2022. The boy told investigators last fall that Busfield — who was hired to direct six episodes of the Fox show — had touched his “private areas” on set.\n\n\n\tBusfield, a star of “Thirtysomething” and “The West Wing,” has adamantly maintained his innocence. His attorney, Stanton “Larry” Stein, said Wednesday that Busfield had voluntarily submitted to a polygraph examination and had passed.\n\n\tAt the press conference, Bregman declined to discuss the facts of the case, saying it would be improper.\n\n\t“My first obligation and the obligation of my office is to ensure the integrity of this process,” he said. “The rules of professional conduct are clear. Prosecutors should try cases in the courtroom and not in the media and that is what we intend to do.”\n\n\tHe also asked anyone with information to come forward to law enforcement.\n\n\tNew Mexico voters reformed the bail process in 2016, eliminating cash bail while allowing judges to hold defendants in custody if they pose a risk to the community. \n\t\n\n\tIn a motion on Wednesday, prosecutors argued that Busfield does pose a risk to children if released.\n\n\t“His conduct reflects a calculated pattern of grooming, lack of boundaries, and exploitation of professional authority to gain access to minors,” wrote Savannah Brandenburg-Koch, a deputy district attorney.\n\n\tThe prosecutor also faulted Busfield for delaying before turning himself in, and for flying to New Mexico instead of turning himself in to authorities near his home in New York so he could be extradited.\n\n\tThe court’s pre-trial services division recommended that he be released on his own recognizance. \n\n\tJudge David Murphy will hold a hearing on the state’s request on Tuesday afternoon. Busfield will subsequently be formally charged and arraigned. \n\n\tBregman estimated that the case would take 12-18 months to resolve.\n\n\tBregman is a candidate for the Democratic nomination for New Mexico governor. He is also the father of baseball star Alex Bregman.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNBC has picked up its third drama pilot of the week, greenlighting an untitled crime investigation drama from writers/executive producers Dean Georgaris (“Quantum Leap”) and John Fox (“The Equalizer”).\n\n\tUniversal Studio Group’s Universal TV is the studio on the show, which also comes from exec producer John Davis, via his Davis Entertainment shingle. Per the logline, the show revolves around professor Georgia Ryan, described as “a trailblazing psychologist who challenges the field of criminology by shifting the investigative focus to the victim rather than just the perpetrator in order to uncover the crucial clues that more traditional methods leave behind. Alongside her team, this pioneering expert consults with the FBI to solve the most baffling and elusive cases.”\n\t\n\n\tThe character of Ryan is inspired by the real-life work of expert profiler and author Dr. Ann Burgess. A forensic nurse, Burgess pioneered the assessment and treatment of trauma in rape victims; later, she collaborated with the FBI’s Behavioral Science Unit thanks to her work with victims of sexual abuse. \n\n\n\tBurgess is on board the NBC pilot as a consulting producer, as is Steven Constantine. Burgess and Constantine co-wrote the book “A Killer by Design: Murderers, Mindhunters, and My Quest to Decipher the Criminal Mind,” which chronicled Burgess’ work assisting the FBI in profiling serial killers. The duo also wrote last year’s “Expert Witness: The Weight of Our Testimony When Justice Hangs in the Balance.”\n\n\tBurgess has consulted on cases involving Bill Cosby, the Menendez Brothers and other high profile names. For her work, she has received honors including being named a Living Legend by the American Academy of Nursing.\n\t\n\n\tBesides the “Quantum Leap” revival, Georgaris’ credits include “The Meg” and “The Meg 2,” as well as “The Baker and the Beauty” and “Bluff City Law.” Fox’s credits include “The Blacklist” and the updated “Magnum P.I.”\n\n\tWith this week of pilot orders, NBC is aiming to bring back some semblance of a pilot season like the old days. Earlier this week, NBC gave a pilot order to “Protection,” written by Josh Safran, about a family of law enforcement agents who become the target of a mysterious assassin. Safran exec produces that one with Jenna Bush Hager and Ben Spector. NBC also picked up the pilot to a reboot of “The Rockford Files,” from writer and executive producer Mike Daniels and exec producers Carl Beverly and Sarah Timberman. Those two pilots also come from Universal TV.\n",

Tyler was arrested Tuesday on a warrant after he got into a violent altercation back in November with his then-girlfriend.\n      \n    \n          Palm Beach County Sheriff deputies received a call for a domestic dispute and responded to a home in Loxahatchee, Florida. When the deputies arrived, the gf approached them and turned over videos she said proved Nolan abused her.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          The report says one video showed the girlfriend holding a towel, which Nolan pulled forward, causing her to be \"yanked forward and downward.\" The recording allegedly captured Nolan coming into contact with her as he reached around to grab another item, and he also appeared to grab her arm.\n      \n\n          Police say a separate video from October shows Nolan snatching a blanket from his ex and then throwing it back at her. Deputies ultimately determined there was probable cause to issue an arrest warrant for Nolan for simple battery.\n      \n    \n          Police then booked Nolan into the Palm Beach County jail and, at his court hearing Thursday, a judge ordered him to stay away from the alleged victim.\n      \n    \n          But Nolan tells TMZ everything his ex has been saying is a \"bunch of bulls**t and she's a vengeful person.\" He adds, \"I haven't talked to her since October, bunch of he said she said bulls**t.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    In the hours before his arrest, Tyler filed a motion asking a judge to set aside the arrest warrant, claiming he never received any notice about the case and was never contacted by law enforcement. He also claims his ex filed the battery charge against him only after he filed to get a protective order against her.In his docs, Nolan claimed he was the victim of domestic violence at the hands of his ex. He says she verbally harassed him and destroyed his property, among other things, but the case was eventually dismissed when he skipped a hearing.\n    \n          As you might know ... Nolan is a tattoo artist who competed on the sixth season of the \"Ink Master\" reality series, and finished in sixth place.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

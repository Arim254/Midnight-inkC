    "body": "\n\tBAFTA North America is postponing its upcoming inaugural BAFTA Honours until next fall.\n\n\tAs first reported by Variety in August, BAFTA North America‘s new awards — which would include one honoree per category across the TV, film and video game industries — were originally slated for Sunday, Nov. 2. Plans to delay the show by one year were confirmed this week. \n\n\t“BAFTA North America is postponing its inaugural BAFTA Honours to fall 2026,” BAFTA North America said in a statement to Variety. “Further details, including the date, location and honourees, will be shared in the coming months. We are excited to bring BAFTA Honours to Los Angeles next year and present the iconic BAFTA mask to three distinguished individuals across Film, TV and Games.”\n\t\n\n\tNo specific details were provided at the time of publication as to the primary reason for the postponement of the inaugural awards, which BAFTA North America had been promoting as part of its continued mission to grow in the U.S., as well as the organization’s commitment to acknowledging the gaming industry at the same level as the film and TV communities.\n\n\tRecently, BAFTA North America has expanded its engagement with the gaming community with appearances at Games for Change in New York and Unreal Fest in Orlando, as well as the formation of a new BAFTA Games North America Committee.\n\n\tSee below for an updated list of upcoming BAFTA & BAFTA North America events, which notes the shifting of the BAFTA Honours to fall 2026.\n\n\tBAFTA Tea Party – January 10, 2026 / Los AngelesEE BAFTA Film Awards – February 22, 2026 / LondonBAFTA Games Awards – April 17, 2026 / LondonBAFTA TV Awards with P&O Cruises – May 10, 2026 / LondonBAFTA Student Awards – Spring 2026 / Los AngelesBAFTA TV Tea Party – Fall 2026 / Los AngelesBAFTA New York Tea Party – Fall 2026 / New YorkBAFTA Honours – Fall 2026 / Los Angeles\n",

    "body": "\n\tSteven Spielberg made a surprise appearance at the London Film Festival premiere of Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet” on Saturday night, praising the director for her devastating historical drama.\n\n\tThe audience at Royal Festival Hall erupted in cheers as Spielberg took the stage and explained how he first met Zhao at a dinner for Oscar-nominated directors, the year after she won the award for “Nomadland.” \n\n\n\t“We became friends and we’d have lunch together at Amblin and I’m just amazed by her, you know,” Spielberg said before sharing what he thinks makes Zhao such a special filmmaker.\n\t\n\n\t“I really believe the earth has a heartbeat. It’s a 24/7 seismic cycle, and all of us are connected to this heartbeat which happens right under our feet. But Chloé Zhao is connected to it in a profound way because it’s where her art comes from,” the legendary director continued. “It’s what she brings to set every day, it’s what she anoints and shares with her cast every day. And I really believe that when you see ‘Hamnet,’ you’ll be able to feel the seismic heartbeat of the earth because of Chloé Zhao.”\n\n\n\tSpielberg is a producer on “Hamnet,” which tells the “powerful story of love and loss that inspired the creation of Shakespeare’s timeless masterpiece, ‘Hamlet,'” according to the film’s synopsis. Paul Mescal plays William Shakespeare with Jessie Buckley as his wife, Agnes.\n\n\tAt the premiere, Mescal applauded Zhao as “one of the great witches of our day,” saying that “the atmosphere she established is one of the main reasons that people seem to be responding to the film.”\n\n\tWhen it came time for Zhao to take the mic, she was visibly overcome with emotion. “I am very emotional, so I ask for your grace,” she began. “I feel immense gratitude because today we finally brought ‘Hamnet’ home.” \n\t\n\n\tShe continued: “Making a film on this island with this village has given me a deep feeling of community, of safety that I don’t think I’ve ever experienced before. It helped me through a very difficult time in my life and I don’t take it for granted, especially in a world that is becoming increasingly lonesome.” \n\n\tThe director then led the audience in a breathing exercise before the screening started, leaving them with a mantra to keep in mind during the film: “All emotions are welcome.” \n\n\t“Hamnet” world premiered at the Telluride Film Festival last month, where it made a huge splash and sparked Oscar buzz, and went on to win the People’s Choice Award at TIFF. In Variety‘s review, chief film critic Peter Debruge wrote that the film is “so emotionally raw as to be almost excruciating at times.”\n\n\t“Jessie Buckley delivers a heroic performance as Shakespeare’s wife Agnes and the mother of his children — although as presented, she could be the mother of us all — the grounded, near-shamanic spirit forced to accept the death of her son, Hamnet,” the review continues. “Meanwhile, Paul Mescal plays Shakespeare, who pours his grief into “the Danish play,” but both actor and character are eclipsed by the feminine elements of this story.”\n\n\t“Hamnet” will receive a limited theatrical release in the U.S. and Canada from Focus Features beginning Nov. 27 before expanding wide on Dec. 12. It will release in the U.K. on Jan. 9 via Universal Pictures.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDirector Bill Condon‘s vision for adapting “Kiss of the Spider Woman” for the big screen was to draw inspiration from the old MGM musicals. Specifically, Vincente Minnelli’s productions from the golden age of Hollywood.\n\n\tManuel Puig’s 1976 novel “Kiss of the Spider Woman” was first turned into a movie by director Héctor Babenco in 1985. Condon’s version, now in theaters, is based on the stage musical by Terrence McNally, John Kander and Fred Ebb. It stars Jennifer Lopez in the dual roles of screen goddess Ingrid and the sultry and seductive Aurora.\n\t\n\n\tProduction designer Scott Chambliss was instructed by Condon to “mimic as closely as we possibly could the style of those movies and not filter it through contemporary tastes.” Those films included “An American in Paris,” “Gigi” and “Ziegfeld Follies.“\n\n\n\tHowever, the film’s plot meant that Chambliss felt like he was making two movies in one. Set in Argentina in 1983, as a military dictatorship rules the country, Luis (Tonatiuh), a gay window dresser, is imprisoned with Valentin (Diego Luna), a political prisoner. Luis hangs a poster of his favorite movie star, Ingrid, and spends his time fantasizing about Ingrid as Aurora.\n\n\tFor the showstopping musical numbers, which play as a fantasy in Luis’ mind, Chambliss says, “We were always referring back to Vincente and his work.” He adds, “Sometimes, it was his less successful movies that we were looking at for inspiration, like ‘Yolanda and the Thief.’”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFor designing the prison cell, Chambliss explains, “In looking at that tiny cell and the drama of those two men and the horror of the prison they were in, it felt like this prison had to be operatic in its drama and in its visual style. That’s what led us directly to the location we chose to be our prison in Montevideo, which is this grand, scary-as-hell ruin of what used to be a prison.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe two stories are intimately tied together through the characters. For Aurora’s lair, Chambliss was inspired by the musicals of Hollywood’s golden age, specifically the 1953 film “Sombrero.” “Cyd Charisse is dancing on a soundstage on a fake-ass mountaintop with the two-dimensional painted backdrop right behind her head, and these ridiculous-looking sculptures and rocks. It’s the most fabulous thing ever,” he says. The sheer artificiality of that scene was something he and Condon wanted to capture. “The Spider Woman’s lair itself was the perfect moment to do that.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tChambliss confirmed there were no visual effects tricks used in the movie, “except to plug in a few deep backgrounds when we needed to.” Aurora’s spider web was made out of string and glue, very much in line with how the old musicals were created. Says Chambliss, “It is as old school as it gets, and that was such fabulous fun.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wonder Man” has arrived at Marvel — not the superhero, but the superhero character. The first full trailer for the Disney+ series features Emmy winner Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Simon Williams, a struggling actor desperate to land the role of his childhood idol, Wonder Man. Marvel also announced that “Wonder Man,” which was previous slated to debut in December, will now premiere on the streamer on January 27.\n\n\tIn the trailer, Simon is shocked when renown filmmaker Von Kovak (Zlatko Burić from “Superman”) announces that he’s going to remake the classic “Wonder Man” film that Simon adored as a child. In his quest to land the role, Simon winds up befriending fellow actor Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley), who infamously played the “role” of international terrorist the Mandarin in 2013’s “Iron Man 3.” Kingsley reprised Trevor in 2021’s “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” directed by Destin Daniel Cretton — who co-created and executive produced the series, and directed the first episode.\n\t\n\n\tCretton, currently in production directing “Spider-Man: Brand New Day,” co-created the show with Andrew Guest (“Hawkeye,” “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” “Community”), who also served as the showrunner. “Wonder Man” co-stars X Mayo, Demetrius Grosse, Arian Moayed and Olivia Thirlby.\n\n\n\tCreated by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Don Heck in 1964, in the Marvel Comics, Wonder Man is the alias of Simon Williams, the son of rich industrialist Sanford Williams. After Williams Innovations faces financial troubles due to competition with Stark Industries, Simon ends up accepting an offer from Baron Zemo that gives him ionic superpowers. After over a decade as a villain to the Avengers, Simon ultimately turns over a new leaf and becomes a longstanding member of the team. Later on in his career, Simon gains an interest in acting and moves to Los Angeles, where he works as a stuntman and books minor roles in blockbusters.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the trailer below.\n\n\n\n",

The announcement was made during the “Star Trek” Universe panel at New York Comic-Con on Saturday. \n\n\tIn addition, it was revealed during the panel that Stephen Colbert is officially part of the show — at least, his voice is. Colbert will voice Starfleet Academy’s Digital Dean of Students, giving daily announcements to the students and alerting them of anything that needs their immediate attention.\n\t\n\n\tParamount has also dropped a new trailer for the series, which can be seen below. \n\n\n\tAs previously announced, “Starfleet Academy” has already been renewed for a second season. This week also marks the launch of StarfleetAcademy.com, where fans can explore the Academy’s campus life, academics and faculty.\n\n\t“Star Trek: Strange New Worlds” was also featured on the panel, including a new first-look clip from the show’s upcoming fourth season. The show has already been renewed for a fifth and final season at Paramount+.\n\n\tThe Season 4 clip, and a behind the scenes featurette about the costumes of Season 3, can also be seen below. \n\n\t“Starfleet Academy” stars Holly Hunter as the Chancellor of Starfleet Academy, with the Starfleet cadets played by Sandro Rosta, Karim Diané Kerrice Brooks, George Hawkins and Bella Shepard. Zoë Steiner, Tig Notaro, Robert Picardo also star along with guest stars Oded Fehr, Mary Wiseman, with recurring guest stars Gina Yashere and Paul Giamatti.\n\t\n\n\tThe logline for the series states that it “introduces viewers to a young group of cadets who come together to pursue a common dream of hope and optimism. Under the watchful and demanding eyes of their instructors, they discover what it takes to become Starfleet officers as they navigate blossoming friendships, explosive rivalries, first loves and a new enemy that threatens both the Academy and the Federation itself.” \n\n\tAlex Kurtzman and Noga Landau serve as co-showrunners and executive produce the series alongside executive producers Gaia Violo, Aaron Baiers, Olatunde Osunsanmi, Jenny Lumet, Rod Roddenberry, Trevor Roth, Frank Siracusa and John Weber. The series’ premiere episode is written by Gaia Violo and directed by Alex Kurtzman. It is produced by CBS Studios in association with Secret Hideout and Roddenberry Entertainment. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution.\n\n\tSeason 4 of “Strange New Worlds” stars Anson Mount, Rebecca Romijn, Ethan Peck, Jess Bush, Christina Chong, Celia Rose Gooding, Melissa Navia, Babs Olusanmokun and Martin Quinn, along with guest star Carol Kane, plus special guest star Paul Wesley.\n\n\tAkiva Goldsman and Henry Alonso Myers serve as co-showrunners. Kurtzman, Goldsman, Myers, Aaron Baiers, Dana Horgan, Alan McElroy, Robbie Thompson, Siracusa, Weber, Chris Fisher, Mount, Roddenberry and Roth serve as season four executive producers.

The trailer showed Bettany back as White Vision from the ending of “WandaVision,” plus a regular-looking human version. There was also human versions of Ultron, who was voiced by James Spader in the second “Avengers” movie, and the AI programs Jarvis, Friday and Edith. At the end of the trailer, there was a brief shot of an adult Tommy, Vision and Wanda’s son that appeared as a child in “WandaVision.”\n\t\n\n\t“Vision Quest” was described as the third part of a trilogy that included “WandaVision” and “Agatha All Along.” In the trailer, Bettany walks up to a white mansion and is greeted by human servants who are really just recreated AI programs. They include Jarvis, who was Tony Stark’s AI program that later became Vision; Friday, who replaced Jarvis and was the AI assistant to Stark and Spider-Man; and Edith, the AI program in Stark’s sunglasses from “Spider-Man: Far From Home.”\n\n\n\tSpader reprises his role from “Avengers: Age of Ultron” as the titular genocidal AI, who Vision appeared to destroy at the end of the film (though it happened off camera). In addition to reappearing as Ultron, Spader was shown as a human in the trailer. “Vision Quest” co-stars Todd Stashwick, T’Nia Miller, Ruaridh Mollica and Emily Hampshire. Terry Matalas (“Star Trek: Picard”) created the show and is the showrunner and executive producer.\n\t\n\n\tOne of the last times Marvel fans saw Vision was when he had been killed by Thanos in “Avengers: Infinity War.” The purple supervillain had ripped the Mind Stone from Vision’s forehead, killing him instantly before he snapped and turned half the universe into dust. Then Vision was mysteriously reanimated and lived a peaceful, domestic life in “WandaVision” opposite Elizabeth Olsen’s Wanda Maximoff, aka the Scarlet Witch. However, it was slowly unveiled in the miniseries that Wanda was mentally unstable, and the quiet, TV sitcom-inspired life she lived with Vision was all a magical conjuring she had created out of her grief. It’s revealed that Wanda had stolen Vision’s lifeless body from the government organization S.W.O.R.D. and reanimated it with her dark, powerful magic. Wanda’s recreation of Vision had no memories of his former life nor death, and he soon fights a government-controlled, all-white Vision sent to destroy him. The evil White Vision regains all of his previous memories and flies off by himself.\n\n\tWanda then reappeared in 2022’s “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” where she undergoes a heel turn and becomes the film’s main villain. In 2024, Joe Locke (“Heartstopper”) played Wanda and Vision’s son Billy in the “WandaVision” spinoff “Agatha All Along,” starring Kathryn Hahn as the witch Agatha Harkness. That series ended with Agatha and Billy setting off to find Billy’s brother Tommy. It appears that “Vision Quest” will age up Tommy just as “Agatha” did for Billy.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLostprophets singer Ian Watkins was found dead after being attacked in jail on Saturday, according to BBC. He was 48.\n\n\tWatkins was sentenced to 29 years in prison at HMP Wakefield after he was convicted of multiple sexual assault and exploitation offenses, including heinous crimes against children, babies and animals.\n\n\tWest Yorkshire Police confirmed the 48-year-old singer’s death after being called to the prison on Saturday morning about an assaulted prisoner and finding Watkins. He was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\t\n\n\tBBC reported that Watkins was attacked with a knife by another inmate. While the exact details and motives of the attack have yet to be revealed, a prison service spokesperson said that a police investigation is currently underway. \n\n\tIt was previously reported by Rolling Stone that the musician was attacked at the jail in August 2023 by three other prisoners. The incident left him with several neck injuries that required him to seek immediate medical attention.\n\n\tAccording to Rolling Stone, Watkins was first arrested in September 2012 after police officers seized a large number of mobile phones and storage devices after conducting a drug search warrant at his home in Pontypridd, a town in Wales. \n\n\tHe was imprisoned in December 2013 after admitting to the attempted rape and sexual assault of a minor, along with a string of other child sex offenses.  \n\n\tA rock star in his 20s, Watkins founded the Welsh rock band Lostprophets in 2000. Their most popular hits include “Lost Train Home” and “Rooftops.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDiane Keaton, whose long, versatile career as an actress, producer and director was indelibly highlighted by her Academy Award-winning performance as Woody Allen’s titular love interest in the actor-writer-director’s 1977 romantic comedy “Annie Hall,” died Saturday in Los Angeles. Her death was first reported by People. She was 79.\n\n\tShe was transported from her home to a hospital at about 8 a.m., TMZ reported.\n\n\n\tIn addition to her “Annie Hall” win, Hall was Oscar-nominated for best actress for “Reds,” “Something’s Gotta Give” and “Marvin’s Room.” Her other notable roles included “The Godfather,” “Father of the Bride” and “Baby Boom.”\n\t\n\n\tHer more recent feature roles included “Book Club” and its sequel, “Poms” and her last role onscreen in 2024’s “Summer Camp,” co-starring with Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard.\n\n\tAfter establishing herself on Broadway in 1969 as Allen’s co-star in his comedy hit “Play It Again, Sam” (during which the performers became romantically involved), Keaton made an impression in Hollywood as Kay Adams, the tormented girlfriend and then spouse of mobster Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), in Francis Ford Coppola’s “The Godfather” (1972) and “The Godfather Part II” (1974).\n\n\tBut it was as Allen’s frequent co-star and onscreen comedic foil – even after their life as a couple was over – that Keaton made her deepest impression. After reprising her role in “Play It Again, Sam” in Herbert Ross’ 1972 screen adaptation, she appeared with the diminutive comic in his sci-fi comedy “Sleeper” (1973) and his spoof of Russian literature “Love and Death” (1975).\n\t\n\n\tHowever, it was the role of Annie Hall, the loopy, charming girlfriend of comic Alvy Singer (Allen) in the unconventionally structured feature, which truly launched her into the top echelon of screen actresses, scoring Oscars for best picture, best director and best original screenplay in the process. Keaton, who had served as the model for her character, also emerged as a style icon (for her off-kilter fashion sense) and an immediate influence on other young actresses.\n\n\tIn a New Yorker profile published at the height of Keaton’s first flush of fame, Penelope Gilliatt noted, “She is not at all like the many actresses who have skimmed some mannerisms off her and done insultingly mild imitations by relying on ‘Well’s and dither. Miss Keaton…is not a whit like the flustered ingénue she was cast to play.\n\n\t“‘I’ve noticed people saying ‘La-di-da’ like Annie Hall, and I don’t like it, you know?’ she told me. ‘It’s not a good idea to be identifiable, though it’s reassuring. It feels safe in most ways, and that’s bad, because it means that you’re accepted, and once that happens that’s where you stay. You have to watch yourself. I’d like a life like Katharine Hepburn’s in terms of work. She matured. She made the changes.’”\n\n\tWhile Keaton would sometimes draw on the dizzy attributes of the Hall character in her later work, she quickly moved into work in other, more somber projects. She succeeded her turn as a promiscuous schoolteacher in Richard Brooks’ adaptation of the shocking bestseller “Looking for Mr. Goodbar” (1977) with appearances in Allen’s Bergmanesque drama “Interiors” (1978) and his dark comedy-drama “Manhattan” (1979).\n\n\tKeaton captured a second Oscar nomination for her performance as the early 20th-century socialite-turned-radical Louise Bryant in “Reds” (1981), a sprawling political-historical drama directed and co-authored by her then-paramour Warren Beatty, who also starred as left-wing journalist John Reed.\n\n\tShe received strong notices for her work in Gillian Armstrong’s “Mrs. Soffel” (1984) and Bruce Beresford’s “Crimes of the Heart” (1986), and returned to work with Allen in a small part in his period comedy “Radio Days” (1987). That same year, her role as a harried career woman saddled with her dead cousin’s infant daughter in “Baby Boom” inaugurated a fruitful series of comedic collaborations with writer (and later director) Nancy Meyers.\n\t\n\n\tIn 1990, Keaton — who was intermittently involved with her “Godfather” co-star Pacino from 1971 — reprised her role as Kay Adams Corleone in Coppola’s long-delayed “The Godfather Part III.” She made a profitable return to comedy opposite Steve Martin in Meyers’ hit remake of “Father of the Bride” (1991) and its 1995 sequel; took another turn opposite Allen in “Manhattan Murder Mystery” (1993); and teamed with Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn in the smash hit “The First Wives Club” (1996).\n\n\tKeaton went on to garner two more Oscar nods as best actress, as a leukemia-stricken woman coping with family upheaval, opposite Meryl Streep and Leonardo DiCaprio, in Jerry Zaks’ drama “Marvin’s Room” (1996) and as a playwright who becomes involved with an aging roué (Jack Nicholson) in Meyers’ rom-com “Something’s Gotta Give” (2003).\n\n\tShe was active as a director from the ‘80s, when she notably helmed the video for Go-Go’s lead singer Belinda Carlisle’s 1987 solo hit “Heaven is a Place on Earth”; she went on to direct episodes for the network series “China Beach” and “Twin Peaks” and the features “Unstrung Heroes” (1995) and “Hanging Up” (2000), in which she also co-starred with Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow. She produced the Fox series “Pasadena” and Gus Van Sant’s startling Columbine-inspired feature “Elephant” (2003).\n\n\tShe published the bestselling memoirs “Then Again” (2011), “Let’s Just Say It Wasn’t Pretty” (2015) and “Brother and Sister” (2020). From the ‘70s on, she was an avid photographer whose work was collected in “Reservations,” and she also edited several photo collections. She was also active in preserving historic houses.\n\n\tKeaton received a 2017 Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute. Woody Allen, who served as presenter, twitted the fedora-wearing honoree’s timeless style, quipping, “She looks like the woman in ‘A Streetcar Named Desire’ who comes to take Blanche away.”\n\n\tAccepting the award, the actress eschewed a speech in favor of a performance of “Seems Like Old Times,” which she memorably sang in “Annie Hall.”\n\n\tShe was born Diane Hall in Los Angeles on Jan. 5, 1946; Allen would later take her nickname and family name for the handle of her most famous character. During high school in Santa Ana, Calif., she was active in both music and theater (and in fact played Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams’ “A Streetcar Named Desire”).\n\t\n\n\tAfter dropping out of college, she moved to New York to pursue acting professional using her mother’s maiden name. In 1968, she landed a role in the Broadway production of “Hair,” the “American tribal love-rock musical,” and attracted attention by declining to strip for the play’s notorious ensemble nude scene. She made her big-screen bow in “Lovers and Other Strangers” in 1970.\n\n\tAn open audition scored her the role as the female lead in Allen’s “Play It Again, Sam,” in which a sexually maladroit film critic receives counsel in romance from the shade of Humphrey Bogart. The co-stars became an item, but their work together on screen persisted long after they separated in the late ‘70s.\n\n\tThe impact of her captivating performance as the aspiring singer in “Annie Hall” (a role she failed to live out successfully in real life) extended well beyond her skillful acting and into the realm of national style. Her wardrobe in the film – wide-brimmed hats, men’s shirts, ties and vests, slacks – became much-emulated street wear for young women of the late ‘70s\n\n\tKeaton, who never married, is survived by her adopted daughter Dexter and son Duke.\n",

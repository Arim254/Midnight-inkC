    "body": "\n\tIt’s official: Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery announced an agreement Friday under which Netflix will acquire Warner Bros., including its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO.\n\n\tThe deal has a total enterprise value (including debt) of approximately $82.7 billion, with an equity value of $72 billion, the companies said. The announcement of Netflix’s deal to buy the Warner Bros. streaming and studios business came after a weeks-long bidding war that pitted the streaming giant against David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance and Comcast.\n\t\n\n\tThe cash and stock transaction is valued at $27.75 per share of WBD. The deal is expected to close in the next 12-18 months, the companies said, after the previously announced separation of WBD’s TV networks division, Discovery Global, into a new publicly traded company, which is now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026.\n\n\n\tUnder the terms of the agreement, each WBD shareholder will receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock for each share of WBD common stock outstanding at the closing of the transaction.\n\n\tThe transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery. The deal is contingent on the completion of the spin-off of Discovery Global as well as regulatory approvals, the approval of the deal by WBD shareholders and other “customary closing conditions.”\n\n\tAccording to the companies, “This acquisition brings together two pioneering entertainment businesses, combining Netflix’s innovation, global reach and best-in-class streaming service with Warner Bros.’ century-long legacy of world-class storytelling. Beloved franchises, shows and movies such as ‘The Big Bang Theory,’ ‘The Sopranos,’ ‘Game of Thrones,’ ‘The Wizard of Oz’ and the DC Universe will join Netflix’s extensive portfolio including ‘Wednesday,’ ‘Money Heist,’ ‘Bridgerton,’ ‘Adolescence’ and ‘Extraction,’ creating an extraordinary entertainment offering for audiences worldwide.”\n\t\n\n\t“Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” said Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, in a statement. “By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies—from timeless classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to modern favorites like Harry Potter and Friends—with our culture-defining titles like Stranger Things, KPop Demon Hunters and Squid Game, we’ll be able to do that even better. Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling.”\n\n\tGreg Peters, co-CEO of Netflix, added: “Warner Bros. has helped define entertainment for more than a century and continues to do so with phenomenal creative executives and production capabilities. With our global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they create — giving our members more options, attracting more fans to our best-in-class streaming service, strengthening the entire entertainment industry and creating more value for shareholders.”\n\n\t“Today’s announcement combines two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most,” said David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery. “For more than a century, Warner Bros. has thrilled audiences, captured the world’s attention, and shaped our culture. By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world’s most resonant stories for generations to come.”\n\n\tIn June 2025, WBD announced plans to separate its Streaming & Studios and Global Networks divisions into two separate publicly traded companies. This separation is now expected to be completed in Q3 2026, prior to the closing of this transaction. The newly separated publicly traded company holding the Global Networks division, Discovery Global, will include premier entertainment, sports and news television brands around the world including CNN, TNT Sports in the U.S., and Discovery, free-to-air channels across Europe, and digital products such as Discovery+ and Bleacher Report.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBUENOS AIRES — Daniela Vega, star of Sebastián Lelio’s Academy Award winning “A Fantastic Woman” has boarded as executive producers of “Desierto Rosa,” the debut feature film of Constanza Majluf.\n\n\tProduced by Chile’s Espejismo Cine and Peru’s Mestizo Studios, “Pink Desert” (“Desierto rosa”) will topline Lola Bravo, one of the stars of Sebastián Lelio’s Cannes-selected “The Wave,” in the role of Mariola, known in town as Mario, who lives in a desert mining town, in north Chile, in 1970. Invited by a theater company of transvestites, to travel to Lima, during the trip Mariola begins to discover who she has always wanted to be. “Returning to Chile, a new era of political and social change drives her to affirm her identity,” the synopsis runs.\n\t\n\n\t“Pink Desert” also stars Daniela Vega, Marcelo Alonso (Pablo Larraín’s “The Club”), Mina Serrano (“Cris Miró, Ella”) and Claudia Di Girolamo (“Chromosome 21”).\n\n\n\t“In Chile and Latin America, we are entering a stage very similar to the one portrayed in ‘Pink Desert’ where extremist political positions are failing to guarantee the rights that began to be achieved more than 50 years ago. As an actress and artist, I consider ‘Pink Desert’ urgent and necessary,” said Vega. \n\n\t“The film maintains a comedic tone mixed with dramatic moments, which is what I find most outstanding about it and what attracted me to be a part of it,” she added. “This is part of our cultural identity, and it is presented in an honest and unique way. \n\t\n\n\tThe film is written by Majluf and Cannes Queer Palm winner Ignacio Juricic (“Lost Queens”). It is produced by the indefatigable Rodrigo Díaz, also behind “Do Not Let Me Die Alone,” from Chile’s Francisco Rodríguez Teare, which won two top awards at this year’s San Sebastián Co-Production Forum. Juan de Dios Larraín, producer of “Jackie,” “Spencer” and “Maria,”  is collaborating on the project.   \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tConstanza Majluf Courtesy of Constanza Majluf\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDevin Armstrong\n\t\n\n\n\n\tKey crew takes in Sergio Armstrong as DP, known for his cinematography on the films of Pablo Larraín, and Amparo Baeza (“White on White”) as production designer. \n\n\t“We are at a crucial stage,” said producer Rodrigo Díaz at Espejismo Cine. “We have a confirmed cast with strong appeal both in Chile and internationally, as well as a top-tier technical team. We plan to enter pre-production in April 2026, and to do so we still need additional resources.\n\n\t“Although we have secured the Feature Film Production Fund from the Chilean Ministry of Culture, along with Juan de Díos’s collaboration, we still require further support to produce the film under optimal conditions. We are particularly seeking co-producers, sales agents, platforms, and distributors who can join the project with their own funds, private investment, pre-sales or minimum guarantees.”\n\n\tA National Board of Review student grant-winning actor, screenwriter and director, Majluf began her film career playing a sister in “The Motorcycle Diaries” and then a nurse on Pablo Larraín’s “Post Mortem.” She went on to work as a second assistant director on Eli Roth’s “The Green Inferno” and “Knock Knock.” As a director scored recently with the vertical series “Wings of Fire: The Dragon Slayer Is My Ex-Lover.”  \n\n\tAs a project, “Pink Desert” participated in the Estelab Latin America-Europe co-production lab, Cine Qua Non Lab, Ibermedia and Fundación Carolina’s CDPAI, El Principio del Film at Ventana Sur and this year’s MAFF.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPink Desert producer Rodrigo Díaz Credit – Maj\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrime Video has set Dec. 19 as the global premiere date for the final season of its International Emmy-nominated original series “Four More Shots Please!“\n\n\tThe Indian series, which has become one of the streamer’s most-watched originals, will close out its run with a fourth and final season launching just ahead of the holidays. The finale brings back the core quartet of Sayani Gupta, Kirti Kulhari, Bani J and Maanvi Gagroo, who return alongside Prateik Smita Patil, Milind Soman, Rajeev Siddhartha, Lisa Ray and Ankur Rathee reprising their roles. New additions to the cast this season include Dino Morea, Anasuya Sengupta and Kunaal Roy Kapur.\n\t\n\n\tProduced by Pritish Nandy Communications, the final season is created by Rangita Pritish Nandy and Ishita Pritish Nandy, developed and written by Devika Bhagat, with dialogues by Ishita Moitra. Arunima Sharma and Neha Parti Matiyani direct the season.\n\n\n\tThe series follows four women navigating friendship, romance and personal challenges. In its final outing, the show’s central characters Damini, Umang, Anjana and Siddhi return with what the streamer describes as the mother of all pacts.\n\n\t“‘Four More Shots Please!’ is the OG series that sparked vital conversations, inspired countless viewers and pushed the boundaries of what female-led storytelling can be,” said Nikhil Madhok, director and head of originals at Prime Video India. “The show’s unapologetic honesty, no holds barred perspective and vibrant characters struck a chord not just in India but across the globe. As we unveil the final season, we’re proud to honour the journey of these much loved and discussed lead characters. This finale reflects our continued commitment to championing bold, authentic, and fearless voices on Prime Video.”\n\t\n\n\tRangita Pritish Nandy, president and creative director at Pritish Nandy Communications, added: “‘Four More Shots Please!’ was born from a desire to showcase women not as they are expected to be, but as they truly are: wildly ambitious and fiercely loyal.

This finale is the crescendo of that journey.”\n\n\tPritish Nandy Communications’ credits include theatrical releases such as “Kaante,” “Chameli” and “Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi,” as well as streaming originals including Prime Video anthology “Modern Love Mumbai” and “The Royals” for Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe trailer for “Sholay: The Final Cut” has been unveiled, previewing the Dec. 12, 2025 worldwide theatrical release of India’s most celebrated blockbuster in its 50th anniversary year.\n\n\tFor the first time, audiences will experience the original uncut version of Ramesh Sippy’s 1975 epic, restored in 4K with Dolby 5.1 sound. The trailer employs the tagline “The Greatest Story Never Told,” a play on the film’s reputation as Indian cinema’s greatest achievement, since general audiences have never seen this complete, uncut version.\n\t\n\n\tThe story follows former police officer Thakur Baldev Singh, who enlists two small-time rogues — the charismatic Veeru and introspective Jai — to capture the notorious dacoit Gabbar Singh, who terrorizes the village of Ramgarh. \n\n\n\tThe preview showcases the iconic partnership of Jai and Veeru, played by Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra, alongside Sanjeev Kumar’s emotional gravitas as Thakur, Hema Malini’s charming Basanti, Jaya Bachchan’s quietly powerful Radha, and Amjad Khan’s unforgettable villain Gabbar Singh. The trailer’s release takes on added poignancy following the recent deaths of cast members Dharmendra and Asrani, making the reissue a tribute to their legacy.\n\n\t“This is a milestone that finally presents ‘Sholay’ exactly as it was intended to be seen,” said Shehzad Sippy, reviving the Sippy Films banner. “This version contains the film’s original ending as well as the original soundtrack composed by R.D. Burman. I can’t wait for audiences to experience it on the big screen for the first time.”\n\n\tThe restored version follows a three-year collaboration between Film Heritage Foundation and Sippy Films that culminated in a world premiere at Italy’s Il Cinema Ritrovato Festival in June. That screening marked the first public viewing of the original ending, in which Thakur kills Gabbar Singh rather than having him arrested by police, a change mandated by India’s Central Board of Film Certification in 1975 during the Emergency period.\n\t\n\n\tWritten by legendary duo Salim-Javed, “Sholay” blends Western influences from Sergio Leone, Akira Kurosawa and John Sturges with distinctly Indian storytelling. \n\n\tDespite a modest initial reception, the 204-minute epic dominated Indian box office for 19 years after its Aug. 15, 1975 release, running for five consecutive years at Mumbai’s Minerva cinema. A 2002 British Film Institute poll named it the greatest Indian film ever made, while BBC India crowned it “Film of the Millennium” in 1999.\n\n\tWatch the trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 5 of “Stranger Things.”\n\n\tThe jaws of “Stranger Things”s cast literally dropped when the Duffer brothers revealed the shocking twist of Season 5 Volume 1 where Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) becomes “a sorcerer.”\n\n\tThe YouTube page of the Netflix show shared on Thursday a video of a table read showing the cast, including Noah Schnapp, Millie Bobby Brown, Sadie Sink, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo Caleb McLaughlin, freaking out, cheering and clapping their hands when the Matt Duffer read the ending of Season 5 Volume 1. \n\t\n\n\tThe last battle that concludes Volume 1 of “Stranger Things 5” sees Will unexpectedly taking down an army of Demogorgons who have begun a mass slaughter in the Upside Down and saves his friends, unlocking a new power to end Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower). \n\n\n\t“Mike, Lucas, and Robin watch transfixed as the monsters levitate 10 feet into the air,” we see Matt Duffer reading. “Will closes his eyes, and then he rolls his hands into fist. Quick cuts as all three demos are violently killed by a powerful force. Their arms snap, their legs break, their necks twist, they crash to the ground. Dead. Will drops to his knees in the middle of the burning battlefield. Mike and Joyce look on, speechless. Will slowly unclinches his fist and peels open his eyes. His eyes are back to normal, only they now reveal a new sense of calm and strength. He is now in control. He is a sorcerer. As a trail of blood slips from his nose, we end Volume 1.”\n\n\tJust when Duffer read those last words describing Will wiping his nosebleed with his sleeve like Eleven, Millie Bobby Brown banged the table and teased Schnapp, “You’re one of me! Now you get to deal with that bloody nose.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tIn an interview with Variety last month, the Duffer brothers said that nosebleed aside, Will’s powers are different from Eleven’s. \n\n\t“It’s different in that he’s able to channel Vecna’s powers. But they’re all related. Vecna and Eleven, their powers are similar. The powers aren’t within him. He’s able to channel these powers from Vecna and use it, sort of puppeteering,” Ross Duffer said. Matt Duffer, meanwhile, said Will “taps into the hive mind, and then he can manipulate anything within the hive. You’ll see how far he can take it as you continue to watch. But that’s how he’s able to manipulate the monster. So he can’t open a door, because the door is not part of the hive mind.”\n\n\tThe first four episodes of “Stranger Things,” Season 5 are now available to stream on Netflix. The next three episode will drop on the streamer on Christmas, while the finale will roll out on New Year’s Eve.\n",

    "description": "\n\tNetflix has entered exclusive talks with Warner Bros. Discovery to acquire the company’s film and television studio, as well as the HBO Max streamin",
    "body": "\n\tNetflix has entered exclusive talks with Warner Bros. Discovery to acquire the company’s film and television studio, as well as the HBO Max streaming service, Variety confirms. \n\n\tThe development comes after a weeks-long bidding war for the assets at Warner Bros. Discovery between Netflix and rivals Paramount Skydance and Comcast. Paramount Skydance, under the newly minted studio CEO David Ellison, had sought to acquire the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery in an all-cash deal, while both Netflix and Comcast only submitted bids for the company’s studio and streaming businesses. News of the exclusive window was first reported by Bloomberg News.\n\t\n\n\tThe move marks a shocking turnaround for Netflix, which for years has resisted opportunities to make a big bet on traditional Hollywood assets. Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, Netflix’s co-CEOs, have long asserted that the company’s growth was not hampered by the lack of a deep content library. But the chance to acquire the vast Warner Bros. film and TV library and the equally renowned HBO brand was too enticing to pass up. Any deal would undoubtedly face a difficult road to securing regulatory approval given the unpredictability of the Trump administration. Already, the Directors Guild of America and Cinema United, the exhibition trade organization, issued statements with warnings that the marriage of Netflix and WBD would have dire consequences for theatrical moviegoing.\n\n\n\tThe news follows months of speculation and anxiety in the larger entertainment and media sector surrounding the potential sale of Warner Bros. Discovery. Ellison’s Paramount was the first and, arguably, most aggressive bidder at roughly $27 per share for the whole of Warner Bros. Discovery. Netflix and Comcast came in later to solidify an intense horse race.\n\t\n\n\tThe bidding war saw highest offers submitted Monday. Paramount went nuclear Thursday morning, accusing Netflix of impropriety surrounding its bid for the legendary studio, arguing that it “has a credible basis to believe that the sales process has been tainted by management conflicts, including certain members of management’s potential personal interests in post-transaction roles and compensation.”\n\n\tParamount’s offer submitted on Monday included financial backing of three Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, Variety reported.\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery, the byproduct of a hastily arranged 2022 marriage of AT&T’s WarnerMedia and Discovery Communications, was thrust into M&A play in October when David Ellison made an unsolicited offer for the entirety of the WBD.\n\n\tPrior to the Ellison move, Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav and the board opted to address the company’s stock price slump with a spinoff plan that would separate Warner Bros. studio and HBO Max streaming from the legacy linear cable channels (CNN, TNT, TBS et al) that defined the company’s strength in the Time Warner era. WBD confirmed plans to proceed with a spinoff plan that was projected to close by mid-2026. Ellison already had his eye on a WBD acquisition to add needed heft and scale to Paramount’s streaming and studio operations. But the WBD divestiture plan likely forced Ellison to act sooner rather than later.\n\n\tShould Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery reach a deal, it would mark a seismic transformation in the media and entertainment landscape. As the leader in paid streaming services, Netflix has grown into far and away the largest and most influential company in Hollywood with a market cap of $437 billion, far eclipsing even Disney ($190 billion). \n\n\tNetflix did not buy its way into Hollywood, it built up into a dominant position by starting as the first premier streamer, beginning with a library of licensed content from traditional studios before developing original content, with outside studios as well as wholly owned productions such as the “Stranger Things” fantasy franchise. \n\n\tA deal would give Netflix rights to the Warner Bros. library — from “Casablanca” and “The Maltese Falcon” to “Friends” to “Ted Lasso” — and its IP, including Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and other comic book characters at DC Studios. HBO’s library includes such landmark TV series as “The Sopranos,” “The Wire,” “Deadwood,” “Game of Thrones,” “Sex and the City,” “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and “Six Feet Under.” WBD’s assets also include broad film and TV rights to the Harry Potter franchise.\n\t\n\n\tBut a potential Netflix-WBD acquisition will also face an uphill battle in securing government approval for the deal, given Netflix’s size and market clout. On Thursday, Variety exclusively reported that a consortium of A-list talent signed an open letter to Congress, imploring members to speak out against a Netflix deal and arguing that the streamer would “effectively hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace” by reducing output to movie theaters and forcing down subsequent licensing fees for home video windows. The statement was signed anonymously, with an explanation that it was done so “not out of cowardice” but fear of retaliation, given Netflix’s considerable power in the marketplace.\n\n\tLate Thursday, the Directors Guild of America issued a sharply worded statement underscoring its misgivings about the transaction.\n\n\t“The news that Netflix had secured exclusive rights to negotiate for WBD raises significant concerns for the DGA,” the guild stated. “We believe that a vibrant, competitive industry — one that fosters creativity and encourages genuine competition for talent — is essential to safeguarding the careers and creative rights of directors and their teams. We will be meeting with Netflix to outline our concerns and better understand their vision for the future of the company. While we undertake this due diligence we will not be commenting further.”\n\n\tThe deal has drawn particularly sharp criticism in the bedrock film production community and among exhibitors, who see Netflix’s strategic goals as a grave threat to the moviegoing tradition. However, sources close to Netflix urged onlookers to reserve judgment and speculation about its strategic approach to theatrical film releases amid the cut-throat dynamics of a bidding war. These sources said Netflix would naturally evaluate its film distribution protocols and corporate priorities if it were to make such a massive acquisition such as Warner Bros., which is built to distribute films around the world.\n\n\tAnother dire warning about the consequences of a Netflix-WBD union came late Thursday from Cinema United, the exhibition industry trade organization previously known as the National Association of Theater Owners.\n\n\t“The proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business. The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,” said Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of Cinema United. “Cinema United stands ready to support industry changes that lead to increased movie production and give consumers more opportunities to enjoy a day at the local theatre. But Netflix’s stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite. Regulators must look closely at the specifics of this proposed transaction and understand the negative impact it will have on consumers, exhibition and the entertainment industry.”\n\t\n\n\tO’Leary didn’t shy away from pointing out the distinction between the medium in which Netflix has thrived — television — and theatrical films. He also pointed out trickle-down effects of moviegoing on restaurants, bars and other retailers, calling exhibitors “a Main Street industry.”\n\n\t“Netflix success is television, not movies on the big screen. A true commitment to exhibition means a robust slate of movies with a meaningful period of theatrical exclusivity supported by marketing. Sporadic and truncated theatrical releases to meet awards criteria in a handful of theatres is not a commitment to exhibition,” O’Leary said. “Movie theaters are cultural and economic anchors of communities of all sizes — we are a Main Street industry. Research shows that for each dollar spent in a local movie theatre, an additional $1.50 is spent in surrounding businesses in the community—restaurants, bars, shopping centers, transportation. That is what is at risk here if we sanction fewer movies in the marketplace. Theaters will close, communities will suffer, jobs will be lost.”\n\n\t(Cynthia Littleton contributed to this report.)\n",

    "body": "\n\tSet against a Puerto Rico still reeling from the devastation of Hurricane María, Raisa Bonnet’s debut feature “Braided” (“Trenzadas”) brings a ground-level perspective to a national trauma whose aftershocks continue to shape the island’s social fabric. \n\n\tScreening this week in Ventana Sur’s rough cut Primer Corte, the drama is produced by La Nauta and Belle Films. It turns on a mother and her two daughters forced to navigate displacement, fractured identity, and the fragile decision to remain in their home when many were compelled to abandon.\n\t\n\n\tBonnet traces the origins of the project to the months immediately after the hurricane, when communication collapsed and Puerto Ricans returned overnight to pre-digital routines. “We were left without communication across the island, no signal, no water, no electricity for three months in my experience. We lived as our grandparents once did — washing clothes by hand, surrounded by darkness, silence, nature, and neighbors. There was nothing to distract us, nowhere to escape,” she told Variety. \n\n\n\t“Yet in the middle of so much loss, something beautiful surfaced – people reached for one another. Neighbors became family, strangers shared food, and children played again in the streets, as if time had shifted into a slower, older rhythm.” Observing the uneven recovery firsthand, and families who lost everything while others rebuilt quickly, Bonnet found the emotional territory that anchors “Braided,” “These dualities are difficult to name, but cinema allows them to be felt.”\n\n\tCentral to the film is a question: ‘If everyone leaves, who stays?’ The line, contributed by lead actress Mar Cruz, emerged from her experience. “I was one of the few who stayed and it wasn’t easy,” she said. Many had to leave because they had no choice. She stayed because of her children, wanting them to see her endure and rise up. For Bonnet, the protagonist Marisol remains because leaving “feels like severing a root. After María, even people with destroyed homes often refused to leave. That kind of love burns in the chest.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t(L-R) Mar Cruz Abril, Jonaibett Cruz Manso and Valentina Cruz Vásquez\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCasting was built around naturalism. Working with casting director Alexandra Talavera, Bonnet selected three actresses Mar Cruz Abril, Jonaibett Cruz Manso, and Valentina Cruz Vásquez who struck up an immediate rapport. A pre-shoot beach session, led by acting coach Pedro Juan Colón, helped forge the trust that underpins the film’s improvisational approach. “There was a spiritual trust, a bond between all of us,” Bonnet explained.\n\n\tVisually, the film shifts aspect ratios across three acts to mirror the characters’ emotional trajectory. “Act 1 is claustrophobic, gritty, and chaotic, captured in a tight aspect ratio that confines the world and immerses the audience in the disorientation of post-disaster life.” cinematographer Sheldon Chau noted. \n\n\t“Act 2 shifts to a tense but cautiously hopeful period of transition, with the 1.85:1 frame offering a bit more breathing room as the characters, and the world, begin to adjust. By Act 3, the story reaches a place of acceptance and renewal, expressed through a wide 2.39:1 aspect ratio that reflects an opened-up landscape and the characters’ evolution, even as they have drifted further apart.”Developed at Trinidad and Tobago’s script lab, Málaga’s co-production market, EAVE Puentes and, notably, Punto G at Ventana Sur in 2020 which the director recalls as “a turning point” “Braided” hits Primer Corte seeking a sales agent aligned with its sensibility. Producer Eliomer Laurean says the team is targeting major festivals. “What matters most is that ‘Trenzadas’ reaches people deeply, whether internationally or at home. Braided’s themes travel beyond Puerto Rico, opening both theatrical and non-theatrical windows.”\n\n\tFor Puerto Rican and Caribbean audiences, Bonnet hopes the film serves as a collective reckoning and offers “the possibility of healing through remembering together what we all lived.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t(L-R) Mar Cruz Abril, Jonaibett Cruz Manso and Valentina Cruz Vásquez\n\t\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tColombian-Canadian filmmaker Juan Andrés Arango returns to features with “Where the River Begins,” a Colombian-set drama that follows a young, widow",
    "body": "\n\tColombian-Canadian filmmaker Juan Andrés Arango returns to features with “Where the River Begins,” a Colombian-set drama that follows a young, widowed Emberá mother and her daughter as they leave a violent Bogotá neighbourhood and attempt to reach the Andágueda River, the jungle landscape they once called home. \n\n\tThe film marks Arango’s first time centring of an Indigenous female protagonist and continues his exploration of migration, marginalisation and the blurred line between memory and present reality, themes that have shaped his work since “La Playa DC” (Un Certain Regard, Cannes 2012) and “X500” (TIFF 2016).\n\t\n\n\tShot across Bogotá, Medellín, Quibdó and deep into the Chocó rainforest, “Where the River Begins” combines social realism with a strong sensory dimension, drawing on Emberá cosmologies, the belief of the jungle as judge and the experience of communities displaced by Colombia’s long conflict. \n\n\n\tWorking with non-professional actors, the director cast Girleza Duave Cerezo from the Emberá Dobidá community as Yajaira, and Juan David Junca Linares as Jhon, a teenage gang member who joins the journey after a confrontation leaves Yajaira’s nephew dead. The film follows the characters’ movement from cramped urban peripheries to a rainforest marked by loss, armed groups and erasure; an all too real trajectory that mirrors the displacement of many Indigenous communities and the disappearance of villages across Colombia’s Pacific coast. \n\n\t“This return is a complex and non-linear process, since the violence has mutated and continues to exist in many of these territories, and because the war has transformed these spaces, distancing them from the places of memory that their former inhabitants carry within themselves. This search for the spaces of our roots in a country transformed by war is my main motivation for telling this story.” the director told Variety.\n\t\n\n\tProduced by Paola Pérez Nieto of Inercia Películas, with co-production partners Midi La Nuit (Canada) and Stær (Norway), the film accumulated substantial international support during development. It participated in the Cinéfondation Workshop, Sørfond Pitching Forum, Cine Qua Non Lab, BAM Stories and San Sebastián’s Co-Production Forum, where it won the Dale! Award. \n\n\tBacking includes SODEC, Telefilm Canada, Sørfond, CALQ, the FDC production fund, and regional support from the Cali city authorities. The production wrapped a two-month shoot in July 2025. “Juan Andrés and I first met on his debut feature, ‘La Playa DC,’ where I worked as the line producer. Since then, we’ve maintained a creative relationship.” said Perez Nieto. “However, it wasn’t until 2019, when I shifted fully into producing through Inercia Películas and he began developing this profoundly feminine film, that he saw me as the right person to produce his project.”\n\n\tPresenting at Ventana Sur’s rough-cut Primer Corte, the team is seeking an international sales agent, distributors in key territories and festival programmers, alongside partners to close the remaining financing on a $2.2 million budget.\n\n\tVariety spoke with Arango about the film’s political and cultural context, his work with Emberá collaborators, and how the edit is shaping the emotional spine of the story.\n\n\tThe film ties territorial displacement to a more inward exile — loss of voice, of community, of spiritual grounding. How early did this dual structure emerge in your writing?\n\n\tJuan Andrés Arango: “Where the River Begins” wants to explore the return that thousands of Colombians have gradually begun to make after the peace agreements with the paramilitary groups and the FARC allowed them to go back to the territories they were forced to abandon because of the war. This return is a complex and non-linear process, since the violence has mutated and continues to exist in many of these territories, and because the war has transformed these spaces, distancing them from the places of memory that their former inhabitants carry within themselves. This search for the spaces of our roots in a country transformed by war is my main motivation for telling this story.\n\n\tSeveral scenes hinge on Yajaira sensing danger or “hearing” the jungle. How did you work with the community to depict spiritual knowledge without exoticising it?\n\t\n\n\tThe film’s script was inspired by several years of conversations with Embera youth living in Colombia’s main cities. One recurring element in these conversations was the longing for the space of the rainforest and how it remained present in the dreams and imagination of Embera adolescents in the city. The film depicts this presence of the jungle, which at moments takes the place of the city, suggesting the space it occupies within the protagonist. The script went through different versions that were shared with members of the Embera community in order to refine the way the jungle’s spiritual presence is portrayed and to present the Embera community in a respectful way.\n\n\tYou’ve consistently used non-professional actors. What specific processes did acting coach Catalina Arroyave and you build to help Girleza Duave Cerezo access Yajaira’s inner world?\n\n\tGirleza, or Anyela as she prefers to be called, has a personal history and an expressive essence that are very close to those of the character Yajaira. The work with Catalina focused on jointly finding the expressive paths specific to her personality so that she could convey to the other actors and to the camera the energy we already knew she possessed.\n\n\tThe film touches directly on paramilitary displacement, a topic deeply linked to land restitution debates in Colombia. How did you balance political precision with the film’s dream-memory tone?\n\n\tMy intention with the film is to explore war, displacement, and land restitution without ever exposing them explicitly or taking a political stance toward them, but rather by giving them the role of a backdrop—an omnipresent force that influences the characters’ everyday lives. This comes from my interest as a filmmaker in exploring conflict not through explicit violence, but through the psychological consequences that decades of war have left in us, and how we must learn to coexist with these consequences in order to move forward.\n\n\tThe film avoids easy redemption arcs. Was it always clear to you that forgiveness in this story would be conditional, ambiguous, and rooted in place rather than personal transformation?\n\n\tThe film aims to be as fair as possible to the character of Yajaira. For this reason, it does not present a clear redemption or an ending in which all the threads of the story are resolved, but rather a direction of movement. Through the story, I hope to bring the viewer closer to the complex and harsh reality faced by young Embera people in the cities, but also to the great human and cultural strength they possess. I believe that it is in this resilient strength where the film’s hope resides.\n\t\n\n\tYou shot from Bogotá to the Chocó rainforest with local communities supporting the production. What agreements or collaborative structures were essential for filming respectfully?\n\n\tThe film is the result of three years of joint work with Embera communities located in the Chocó rainforest and in Bogotá. This work was coordinated by Nury Dumaza, the project’s researcher, who is a member of the community. Together with her, we approached the community leaders and elders to present the project’s initial idea as well as its development through the different versions of the script. They contributed – and continue to contribute – their knowledge and guidance, without which it would have been impossible to carry out the project. On a practical level, the communities took part in the film’s production at every stage, with members participating in the production and directing teams, acting, food preparation, transportation, and guidance within the territory.\n\n\tAs you assemble the first cut with editor Xi Feng, what has surprised you most, any emotional through-lines that only arose in the edit?\n\n\tI think what surprised me the most during the editing process with Xi was the expressive force with which the jungle emerged in the film. We had always been aware of its importance in the story, but shooting in the rainforest is a bit like swimming in a river – you become so absorbed in the current that it’s difficult to analyze anything rationally. Rediscovering the jungle in the footage was therefore a very emotional surprise.\n\n\tYou call this your most personal film. Has making it shifted the direction of your next project, in terms of scale, geography, or thematic concerns?\n\n\tI don’t think there is a change of direction in my work as a director, but rather a deepening of the themes of identity, transformation and belonging that fascinate me. I believe that “Where the River Begins” allowed me to approach these themes from a more intimate and spiritual perspective, one that will continue to grow in my future films.\n\n\tAnything else you would like to say…\n\n\tThis film is the result of passionate work carried out under difficult shooting conditions by people from a variety of backgrounds and cultures. I believe that it is precisely the fact that we are different, yet want to communicate something essential together, that gives strength to the process and shapes this film’s final result.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJeremy O. Harris, whose boundary-pushing “Slave Play” earned a record number of Tony nominations, has been detained in Japan for nearly three weeks following his arrest on drug smuggling charges at an Okinawa airport.\n\n\tThe multihyphenate writer-actor, whose work spans Broadway, HBO’s “Euphoria” and the critically lauded feature “Zola,” was stopped by customs officials Nov. 16 at Naha Airport after they allegedly found less than a gram of MDMA in his bag, according to Reuters. Harris, 36, has remained in custody since his arrest under Japan’s strict narcotics laws.\n\t\n\n\tLocal prosecutors received a criminal complaint Thursday from Okinawa customs officials, moving the case toward formal charges. Authorities have not disclosed whether Harris has addressed the allegations. Variety has reached out to Harris’ representatives for comment. It remains unclear whether he has secured legal representation in Japan.\n\n\n\tThe Yale School of Drama graduate had traveled to the resort island from the U.K. with a layover in Taiwan, reportedly for tourism. Okinawa, known for its beaches and located about 930 miles southwest of Tokyo, is a popular vacation destination.\n\n\tHarris emerged as one of theater’s most provocative voices with “Slave Play,” which interrogated race, sex and power dynamics en route to becoming the most Tony-nominated play in Broadway history. Beyond theater, he’s built a robust screen career, co-writing A24’s “Zola” with director Janicza Bravo and contributing to Olivier Assayas’ “Irma Vep” for HBO. He’s also attached to adapt Brit Bennett’s novel “The Vanishing Half.”\n\t\n\n\tJapan maintains some of the developed world’s strictest drug enforcement policies, prosecuting even small-scale possession cases. The country’s penalties, while severe, stop short of the death sentences imposed in other Asian nations including China and Singapore.\n\n\tOther entertainment figures have faced similar troubles in Japan: Grammy-winning DJ David Morales was arrested in 2018 at Fukuoka airport over alleged MDMA possession, while Paul McCartney’s 1980 marijuana arrest in Tokyo resulted in a lengthy entry ban.\n",

    "body": "\n\tResplendent in costume and production design, but shaky in overall execution, the star-studded fantasy romance “100 Nights of Hero” is the second feature from writer-director Julia Jackman. Based on the graphic novel by Isabel Greenberg, it takes its cues from “One Thousand and One Nights” (or “The Arabian Nights”) of West Asian folklore, responsible for such cultural mainstays as Aladdin, Sinbad and Ali Baba. However, in Jackman’s movie, these narrative layers aren’t nearly as fantastical as their forebears from the Islamic Golden Age. They serve as thinly veiled extensions for their fictitious storyteller: a Scheherazade stand-in, whose queer reimagining works far better in theory than in practice.\n\t\n\n\tThe film initially features a mischievous spark, as Felicity Jones narrates the meta-textual origins of the subsequent story. A child with godlike powers, referred to as “kiddo” (Safia Oakley-Green) defies her carnivalesque father, “Birdman” (Richard E. Grant) by creating the world and its human inhabitants. This flourish of magical realism gives way to the central conceit and its Victorian dollhouse conception, as a melancholy woman named Cherry (Maika Monroe) is married off to the neglectful prince Jerome (Amir El-Masry), with the expectation of bearing an heir. Jerome, it turns out, isn’t interesting in consummating their union, even though he boasts otherwise. So, the blame for their lack off progeny falls on Cherry’s shoulders.\n\n\n\tAll the while, Cherry’s servant and loyal companion, the diligent, pixie-haired Hero (Emma Corrin), maintains a watchful eye and lends emotional support. When Jerome takes an extended leave of absence from his castle, he makes a wager with his scheming friend Manfred (Nicholas Galitzine), who sets out to seduce Cherry in his stead, in an effort to prove her infidelity. Cherry, it turns out, is taken with Manfred’s advances (and with Galitzine’s He-Man physique). But she remains conflicted, and thus, open to Cherry’s distractions, in the form of nightly stories about women in similar positions, ending on a cliffhanger every night. At least, that’s the intent.\n\t\n\n\tNight after night, Hero’s yarns enchant the would-be couple — literally at times, as Hero appears to call on witchcraft, causing Manfred to lose all sense of days and weeks. This imbues the passageways of Jerome’s lush estate (guarded by masked figures) with a dreamlike quality. However, the fog that falls upon Manfred during these bedtime stories is rarely supported by the tales themselves. One follows a betrothed woman, Rosa (Charli XCX), in a remarkably familiar marital dilemma. Another is about Hero’s own mother, and the tales she once told Hero about her grandmother, who happens the Moon. Before long, these stories become bound by references to a secret society of storytellers, as the movie gestures towards the idea of narrative as a weapon in the face of gendered oppression. But these are glancing blows that barely land.\n\n\tAt the core of Hero’s tall tales is her own affection for Cherry, which is not altogether uninteresting, but neither the movie’s queer nor heterosexual pairings are ever presented with enough subdued passion to really light a fire under the film. Ironically, its story is far more told, in words, than actually felt, as the film spends much of its runtime circling its feminist themes rather than engaging with them head on, as a story of love and companionship beset by hegemonic structures. Its comedic flourishes are appropriately restrained, with humor seeping through its stilted compositions — picture an austere Wes Anderson — but its visual approach rarely evolves, even though the characters’ evolving dynamics demand aesthetic transformation. The camera seems hesitant to explore the movie’s picturesque world, as though tethered to the still panels of its comic source material; if the actors have romantic and sexual chemistry, they’re seldom allowed to explore it either.\n\n\tThe haziness that scatters the on-screen candles and other light sources gives it the appearance of a lurid fairytale. However, its human elements — its withheld, morose performances, and the distance with which they’re captured — render its characters’ alleged fervor, attraction and vigor mere theoretical concepts, rather than embodied impulses that either create a sense of allure, or justify the numerous overtures towards companionship and community as foundational rebellions against hetero-patriarchy. It’s a gorgeous-looking film, but a drag.\n",

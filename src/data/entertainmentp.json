    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/blackpink/\">Blackpink</a>’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jisoo/\">Jisoo</a> is cooking up something special for fans — and she appears to be bringing a major pop star along for the ride.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe K-pop sensation dropped a cryptic teaser on social media hinting at an upcoming surprise single, featuring a shadowy silhouette that suggests the track will be a duet. While the mystery collaborator’s identity remains under wraps, <a href=\"https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10589718\" target=\"_blank\">a report in The Korea Herald</a> suggests that Jisoo is teaming up with none other than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zayn-malik/\">Zayn Malik</a>, the British heartthrob who made his name with chart-topping boy band <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/one-direction/\">One Direction</a>.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Jisoo is releasing a new ballad duet with Zayn, sometime in this month,” a source told The Korea Herald. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the teaser images <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DPe3GL2kwdz/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=eDYxaXkwczVoYmJ0\" target=\"_blank\">released on Instagram</a>, Jisoo strikes a pose in the foreground while a male figure stands with his back turned, his features obscured but bearing a resemblance to the “Pillowtalk” singer. The images suggest that the single will be titled “Eyes Closed.” “Two voices, one orbit. Coming soon,” Jisoo wrote in the caption. While Jisoo does not name Malik, the tattoo on the back of the mystery singer’s head looks similar to one that the former One Direction member sports.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe potential collaboration could have been months in the making. In July, Malik was spotted catching Blackpink’s show at New York’s MetLife Stadium with his daughter Khai in tow. The former boybander later took to Instagram to share a snap from the concert, showing father and daughter with their hands raised in the crowd. “@BLACKPINKOFFICIAL THANK YOU :) ME & KHAI LOVED IT,” he captioned the post.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe timing works out: Jisoo is currently taking a breather from Blackpink’s “Deadline” world tour, which kicked off in Seoul in July. After wrapping shows at London’s O2 Arena on Aug. 15-16, the group is gearing up to resume the tour in Kaohsiung, Taiwan on Oct. 18.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe upcoming single would mark Jisoo’s first new music since dropping her solo EP “Amortage” in February. That project showcased her vocals across four tracks: “Earthquake,” “Your Love,” “Tears” and “Hugs & Kisses.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for Malik, the singer famously exited One Direction — one of the best-selling boy bands in history — in 2015, launching a successful solo career that’s seen him explore R&B and alternative pop sounds far removed from his 1D days.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety</em> has reached out to Jisoo’s label YG Entertainment and Malik’s publicists. Neither have confirmed the collaboration at the time of going to print, but fans are already buzzing about the pairing of K-pop royalty and British pop aristocracy.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe 69th edition of the BFI <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/london-film-festival/\">London Film Festival</a> — the biggest film event in the U.K. — kicks off on Oct. 8. </p>\n<p>\n\tLaunching with the European premiere of Rian Johnson’s “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery,” the lineup of around 250 films, like most years, is awash with big hitters from across 2025’s other major festivals. Jim Jarmusch’s Venice-winner “Father Mother Sister Brother” is there, as is Jafar Panahi’s Cannes winning “It Was Just an Accident,” plus “Frankenstein,” “After the Hunt,” “Bugonia,” “Die My Love,” “Hamnet,” “The Testament of Ann Lee,” “Sentimental Value” and “Jay Kelly.” Many of the key titles will likely be getting a sizeable push from studios and streamers hoping to impress the British capital’s growing number of resident AMPAS, BAFTA and Golden Globe voters as awards season kicks into gear. There are also eight features world premiering, including British boxing drama “Giant.” The festival closes with Julia Jackson’s “100 Nights of Hero” on Oct. 19, with the hope that the film’s all-star cast — including Charli xcx — will be in attendance. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking to <em>Variety</em> ahead of the event, festival director Kristy Matheson discussed the importance — or not — of landing world premieres, accepting that protest may take center stage and, with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/tilly-norwood/\">Tilly Norwood</a> still causing a stir, the prospect of programming a film starring an AI creation.\n</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow are you feeling about this year’s edition of the festival?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI’m really excited. We sort of start in January, looking at works in progress over the winter, but really we’re viewing finished films from January onward. And even by the time we sort of got out of the winter festivals, the program team and I were thinking it was going to be very, very busy. And then, as we headed into the spring and the summer the abundance of films kept coming. It didn’t seem to slow, which made for some pretty tough program meetings toward the end, because there were so many things that we really liked. But yeah, I’m really proud of the program.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tI know you’re can’t really single things out, but is there anything you’re particularly excited about?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThis year we’re have a very large scale installation called “NowIsWhenWeAre (the stars),” and it’s created by an artist called Andrew Schneider. It’s very immersive, with over 4000 reactive LED lights and a soundscape made up of something insane, like over 450 different channels of sound. So you walk in and you are in the cosmos. I’m very excited about that, because it’s something I haven’t actually got to see myself yet. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThere’s obviously an obsession with festivals having world premieres. London usually managed to carve out a few bigger name titles to debut and last year opened with the world premiere of “Blitz,” but there aren’t any major studio titles bowing this time around. Is it becoming more difficult to negotiate premieres from studios and streamers?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWe sit in a luxurious corridor in the sense that we come after all the major summer festivals. And I think that you could look at that as a real disadvantage, but for myself and the programming team, it feels like a real sense of freedom. There’s so many films that gets that get launched in this period and we’re an audience facing festival. That’s who we program for and who the festival really is for and in terms of audiences, last year with admissions at 230,000 there’s a lot of audience appetite here for the festival. But I think that this idea of chasing world premieres takes a lot of energy. And I feel for audiences, they’re not as interested in the world premiere. As a curator, it’s very important to not lose sight of the audience.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tFestivals have always been platforms for protests but this year more than ever given what’s going on in the world, especially in Gaza. Are you anticipating protest to play a major part of this edition of the festival, even if not related to any of the films?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWe’re running a festival which is a large public event. And so, by very nature of it being a large public event, we’re always planning for those moments to happen. Primarily when we’re putting the festival together, there’s obviously a lot of thinking that goes into the production and for us it’s about making sure that we can present the films in a space that’s safe and that feels very comfortable for our filmmakers and audiences. But I think that people need to express feelings. The point of art is that it brings up a lot of ideas and emotions, so by its very nature it’s a space where people want to have dialog. So I think that’s a very normal thing to happen within a festival.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tSo beyond the aspects of safety, there’s not going to be any effort to diminish any of that?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWe’re always mindful, but we certainly don’t want a situation where we wouldn’t want people to be able to express their feelings.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAnother hot topic is AI and we’re all seen the recent uproar and debate about Tilly Norwood. Has AI infiltrated the festival in any way? Does anyone use a little ChatGPT to write the program or anything like that?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tNo! I told someone recently I had to write all my synopses. And they said, oh, you should just get ChatGPT to do it. And I was like, what? It was a very like old lady moment. But no, we don’t use it. We schedule with humans in a room, and we write all of our notes at a computer.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWould you ever allow a film to be programmed starring an AI actress on your watch?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWho knows! It could be happening and I don’t even know! It feels like we’re in a very strange space between two worlds. Maybe this is what people felt like when photography happened.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tWelcome to the world of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kill-jackie/\">Kill Jackie</a>.” </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety</em> can exclusively reveal a glamorous first look at the upcoming thriller series (see above) starring Oscar winner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/catherine-zeta-jones/\">Catherine Zeta-Jones</a> as Jackie Price, an international drug smuggler turned art dealer who embarks on a journey for revenge. The series, which just wrapped production, hails from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/prime-video/\">Prime Video</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fremantle/\">Fremantle</a> and Steel Springs Pictures and is set to launch next year. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Kill Jackie” is based on the acclaimed novel “The Price You Pay” by bestselling author Nick Harkaway, writing under his pseudonym Aidan Truhen. The show follows Jackie Price, who has “been living a wealthy, luxurious existence for the last 20 years — traveling the world, selling fine art using sophisticated tax loopholes and, above all, trying to stay anonymous after escaping a dangerous past as an international drug smuggler,” its plot description reads. “But just as life starts to feel a little boring, it takes a sudden lethal turn when she discovers The Seven Demons, a squad of the world’s most terrifying hitmen, have been hired to kill her. Assuming someone from her past is behind it, Jackie unleashes her old instincts and embarks on a wild, dangerous game plan: to take down The Demons one by one before they kill her. However, she soon realizes her own demons are much more terrifying than the ruthless killers on her trail… and her buried secrets ultimately lead her much closer to home, with surprising consequences.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAlongside Zeta-Jones, the “Kill Jackie” cast comprises Daniel Ings, Sidse Babett Knudsen, Óscar Jaenada , Hattie Hook, Darci Shaw, Raff Law , Enzo Cilenti, Christine Adams, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Karlis Arnolds Avots, Set Sjöstrand, Tadashi Ito, Sebastian Armesto, Julian Barratt, Gavin Spokes , Jonathan Cake, Bamshad Abedi-Amin and Bill Paterson.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe eight-part series is co-produced by Fremantle and Steel Springs Pictures and was co-created by Conor Keane, Tom Butterworth (“Gangs of London”), Peter Lawson (“John Wick”) and Damon Thomas (“Killing Eve”). Zeta-Jones executive produces alongside Lawson and Jose Augustin Valdes for Steel Springs Pictures, Butterworth, Thomas, Dante Di Loreto and Jeffrey Levine. Thomas is the lead director, with Butterworth serving as writer and showrunner and Keane co-writing and associate producing. Harkaway was an executive consultant on the series and José Luis Escolar’s Deabru Kalea Filmeak supervised production in Bizkaia.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Kill Jackie” will launch on Prime Video in the U.K. and Ireland, the Netherlands, Turkey, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Canada. Fremantle will handle sales in all territories besides the U.S., which will be managed by Steel Springs Pictures.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe book rights deal was handled by the Curtis Brown Media Rights Team on behalf of Patrick Walsh at PEW Literary. Zeta-Jones is represented by UTA and Ziffren Brittenham LLP. Butterworth is represented by Curtis Brown (Nick Marston and Katie Battcock).</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIt was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/netflix/\">Netflix</a>, in the development room, with the greenlight.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe streamer has ordered a competition series based on the murder mystery board game and movie “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/clue/\">Clue</a>.” </p>\n<p>\n\tThe unscripted show will feature a group of contestants who undergo physical and mental challenges, collecting clues before they are launched into a real-life game of detective work and deception. To win, the contestants must outwit their opponents and identify the suspect, location and murder weapon of the crime. If they guess right, they add money to the prize pot; if they guess wrong, they may be eliminated. The competition series will, of course, include familiar suspects such as Colonel Mustard, Miss Scarlett and Professor Plum.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Clue” is produced by Hasbro Entertainment, The Intellectual Property Corporation (IPC) and B17 Entertainment. Executive producers are Gabriel Marano, Zachary Edwin (Hasbro Entertainment); Eli Holzman, Aaron Saidman (IPC); Rhett Bachner and Brien Meagher (B17).\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Like so many families and friends over the years, we’ve gathered around the table trying to figure out who did it — making ‘Clue’ a source of nostalgia that everyone shares,” said Jeff Gaspin, VP of unscripted series at Netflix. “Thanks to the incredible vision of our partners at Hasbro Entertainment, IPC, and B17, we’re delivering a fresh, imaginative whodunit competition that will invite today’s audiences into that iconic world.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThis announcement comes off the heels of Netflix landing the rights to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/monopoly-netflix-reality-show-1236362165/\">“Monopoly” competition series</a> earlier this year. That show, another TV program based on a bestselling board game, is similarly described as a “large-scale social-experiment contest” that will force contestants to form alliances and betray their competitors.</p>\n</div>",

A newly designed 25th anniversary logo, which is meant to evoke the magical glow of a Patronus, will feature prominently across new and existing product lines and engaging retail activations, the company noted in a press release.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“This anniversary not only celebrates the legacy of the original film but also introduces the magic to a new generation,” Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products group said. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” which opened on Nov. 16, 2001, became an instant sensation, paving way for one of the most successful franchises in box office history and turning then-unknown stars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint into household names. The sprawling Wizarding World continued with seven sequels as well as three “Fantastic Beasts” prequel spinoffs. There’s also a stage show, “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” and theme parks in various parts of the world. </p>\n<p>\n\tNow, a quarter-century after the first film and 15 years after the final chapter, “Deathly Hallows: Part 2,” the studio is returning to Hogwarts with the upcoming HBO television series. The show, which will revisit the popular books by author J.K. Rowling, is slated to premiere in 2027.</p>\n</div>",

    "description": "<div><p>\n\tThe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ozzy-osbourne/\">Ozzy Osbourne</a> documentary “No Escape From Now” is finally streaming o",
    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ozzy-osbourne/\">Ozzy Osbourne</a> documentary “No Escape From Now” is finally streaming on Paramount+, offering an intimate look at the last months of the rock icon’s life and his journey to say goodbye to his fans with one last head-banging concert.</p>\n<p>\n\tDirected by Tania Alexander, the two-hour film chronicles the health struggles of Osbourne — who died on July 22 at the age of 76 — over the past six years. Emotional and raw, the doc shows the Prince of Darkness at his lowest while struggling with chronic pain after a 2019 fall and several surgeries, in addition to battling Parkinson’s disease. However, his signature sense of humor is present through it all — as is his enduring love for his wife, Sharon.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThroughout the documentary, the one thing that seems to keep Ozzy going is his desire to return to the stage for one last gig, which became the “Back to the Beginning” concert in his hometown of Birmingham, England. “I don’t feel I’ve finished yet,” Ozzy says in the doc. “I want to say to my fans, ‘Thank you for the years.’ I haven’t said that yet. That’s what it’s all about.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond some of Ozzy’s final on-camera interviews, “No Escape From Now” also features revealing conversations with Sharon; his children Aimee, Kelly and Jack; and a slew of rock icons including Tony Iommi (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/black-sabbath/\">Black Sabbath</a>), Duff McKagan and Slash (Guns N’ Roses), Robert Trujillo and James Hetfield (Metallica), Billy Idol, Maynard James Keenan (Tool) and Chad Smith (Red Hot Chili Peppers).</p>\n<p>\n\tRead on for the biggest revelations from the documentary, including that his 2019 spinal surgery may have been unnecessary and that he was “very afraid” for his final show.\n\t</p>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tOzzy Struggled With ‘Massive Depression’ After His 2019 Fall\t</h3>\n<p>\n\tAfter Ozzy fell at the Osbournes’ Los Angeles residence in February 2019 and underwent spinal surgery, forcing him to cancel his tour dates for that year, Sharon watched him fall into a “massive depression.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“He’s so depressed. He’s gone through hell and back, he’s gone through so much pain with these operations,” she says in the doc as a couch-bound Ozzy watches TV on his iPad. “It’s like he woke up and he was a different guy because that whole [touring] part of his life is gone.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIt got so bad at one point that Ozzy turned to medication to improve his mood. “The thought of not doing any gigs anymore, I went really into depression. I’m on antidepressants now, actually,” he says. “I was getting fucking ready to off myself at some point. But then I’ll go there in my head and I’ll go, what are you fucking talking about? Because knowing me, I’d half do it and I’d be half dead. I’d fucking set myself on fire and I wouldn’t die, you know? That’s my luck.” </p>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tHis Spinal Surgery May Have Been ‘Overly Aggressive’ \t</h3>\n<p>\n\tAfter Ozzy’s fall, he underwent a major spinal surgery that the doc reveals may have hurt him more than it helped. Ozzy recalls waking up in the hospital “completely fucked.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“To be honest, I thought, ‘What the fuck have they done to me?'” Ozzy says. “I never thought a surgeon could do wrong.” He was in the hospital for three months before finally coming home, but due to his inactivity he also developed severe blood clots. “It’s a pain that no matter what you do, it’s always there,” he says in the doc.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’re kind of raised to believe that doctors are superheroes, in a way,” Ozzy’s daughter Aimee says of her father’s surgery. “And although they’re very skilled — some of them — a lot of them really don’t have the answers.”</p>\n<p>\n\tA couple of years later, Ozzy saw a doctor who seemed to confirm what his family had feared about his initial surgery. “We finally found a surgeon that said, ‘They were overly aggressive with your operation. They’ve done stuff that you didn’t need doing,'” Sharon says. “And what this other surgeon had done was, he’d put plates either side with all these screws and apparently that didn’t need to be done. So he caused even more damage. They took out the metal plates and the screws that were in Ozzy and tried to patch up as much as he could, but the main damage was done.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a particularly emotional moment, Ozzy’s son Jack says: “That fucking doctor just stripped him of his abilities to move, and it makes me so angry because I felt like all of this could have been avoided. It didn’t have to happen.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_1-SCREEN-GRAB.jpg 4096w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_1-SCREEN-GRAB.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_1-SCREEN-GRAB.jpg?resize=300,158 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_1-SCREEN-GRAB.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Ozzy Osbourne in “No Escape From Now.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFilm still/Paramount+\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tOzzy ‘Never’ Got Over Being Fired From Black Sabbath\t</h3>\n<p>\n\tThe doc briefly touches on the importance to Ozzy of reuniting with Black Sabbath during his final show after he was originally fired from the band in 1979 due to his substance abuse issues. </p>\n<p>\n\t“My dad will never get over being fired from Black Sabbath,” Ozzy’s daughter Kelly reveals. “He’ll never get over that, ever ever ever. It hurt him more than anything people can put into words. It destroyed him. Those were his brothers, those were his extended family and all he knew.” </p>\n<p>\n\tThough Ozzy himself doesn’t directly speak on the topic, he tells producer and friend Andrew Watt during a conversation in the studio: “To be honest with you, we were all fucked up … At the end of the day everybody was stoned, but they all went, ‘Oh Ozzy’s stoned.’ Because when you do a lot of acid like I used to, you gotta be fucking off your nut. That’s what it does, it sends you fucking crazy. I can’t take it anymore.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOzzy had rejoined Black Sabbath several times previously, including from 1997 to 2005 and again in 2012 before embarking on a farewell tour that ended in 2017. In the doc, Ozzy says that Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi had been “very supportive” through his recent health struggles and the doc shows the two reuniting for a performance at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.</p>\n<p>\n\t“When Ozzy got sick, Tony was there every week,” Sharon says. “He would reach out to him. He was there when Ozzy needed someone to talk to, and he’s just been amazing.”</p>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tBeing Inducted Into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Broke Ozzy’s Heart\t</h3>\n<p>\n\tWhat should have been a moment of pride — Ozzy’s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in October 2024 — was instead heartbreaking. Due to chronic pain and the progression of his Parkinson’s that kept him sitting on a “throne” instead of performing, Ozzy was unable to perform at the induction ceremony and instead put together a super group including Keenan, Idol and Smith to perform several of his songs.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I wasn’t thinking, ‘I’m glad they’re doing my fucking gig for me.’ I was going, ‘What the fuck is wrong with me?'” Ozzy says of the ceremony. “And that feeling of wanting to get up there and have a go myself, that broke my heart, you know? I nearly said, ‘Let me have a go.’ But I know I would be on the floor in two fucking seconds.” </p>\n<p>\n\tOzzy even admits that he “spent some time in the middle of the night looking online for these fucking bionic legs and things” just to be able to perform. “I was thinking that would be great — the real Iron Man,” he says with a smile. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe doc takes viewers inside the final rehearsal for the induction ceremony performance, where Jack Black — who was set to intro the tribute — told Ozzy “I owe it all to you” and “it was you who changed my life.” During “Mama, I’m Coming Home,” Ozzy and Black start to sing together and it looks like Ozzy wants to leap out of his throne. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I swear I saw him, like the legs were going … it looked to me like he was thinking about fucking getting up,” Smith says in the doc. “I’m like, you might not wanna, I don’t know if you can do that. But in his mind, he thinks that he can do it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the song finishes, Black tells Ozzy: “You sounded great. Oh my God, I almost passed out. It’s so good to hear you sing, man. Love you, Ozzy.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring the actual ceremony, Ozzy confesses that he was overcome with emotion. “I just welled up in my fucking throat because I was feeling sorry for myself at the same time that I couldn’t get up there to do the thing myself. It was a bittersweet thing, the whole thing,” he says. “A big part of my heart was getting broken because I belong up there, you know?”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_12-NEIL-POLLOCK.jpg 5477w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_12-NEIL-POLLOCK.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_12-NEIL-POLLOCK.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_12-NEIL-POLLOCK.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_12-NEIL-POLLOCK.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_12-NEIL-POLLOCK.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_12-NEIL-POLLOCK.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_12-NEIL-POLLOCK.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_12-NEIL-POLLOCK.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_12-NEIL-POLLOCK.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_12-NEIL-POLLOCK.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sharon-osbourne/\">Sharon Osbourne</a> in “No Escape From Now.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeil Pollock/Paramount+\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tThe Birmingham Concert Was Touch-and-Go Until the Last Minute\t</h3>\n<p>\n\tIn April, just two months before Ozzy’s big farewell show in Birmingham, a weakened Ozzy sits for an interview and tells the camera: “The way I feel now, it will be a miracle if I make it.” </p>\n<p>\n\tSharon reveals that Ozzy has been dealing with a new health issue: a cracked vertebrae as a result of the botched surgery from six years earlier. He had to go to the hospital and get it surgically filled, which fixed the problem for about two weeks, until he was in agony once again. While in the hospital, he caught both pneumonia and sepsis, and then another vertebrae beneath the one that was filled also cracked. Everyone was shocked he survived.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The problem now is getting to England. But it’s just fucking soul destroying, you know?” Ozzy says. “I’ve gotta be there. I have to be there. I’ve been sick now, this is year seven, you know? As I’m getting on with it and going further into this thing, it’s getting slowly worse. It’s fucking crippling me. I can’t walk very far, I can’t bend down … all I can do is turn up and do the best I can.” </p>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tOzzy Was ‘Very Afraid’ and ‘Nervous’ for Final Gig\t</h3>\n<p>\n\tThough Ozzy eventually is cleared to fly and makes it for the Birmingham show, Sharon says that his “mind is overwhelmed with the way people are showing up for him.” Not only did “Back to the Beginning” reunite Black Sabbath for one last time, but the event also featured performances from Metallica, Guns N’ Roses, Ronnie Wood, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, Slayer, Pantera, Tool, Yungblud and more. </p>\n<p>\n\t“He’s very afraid,” Sharon adds. “But I know that with the emotion behind it all, it will carry him through the day. He’s going to be fine.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m nervous. It’s my last hurrah, so it’s going to be pretty emotional for me up there,” Ozzy admits. He wasn’t the only one: the video footage in the doc shows countless fans weeping over getting to see their idol play his last concert ever.</p>\n<p>\n\t “I just hope I don’t think of Sharon when I’m up there, because then the fucking tears will start coming. We’ve done a lot of miles together, me and my old girl,” Ozzy concludes. “This is it, this is the last thing. And I’ve accepted it, you know.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_9-SCREEN-GRAB-1.jpg 4096w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_9-SCREEN-GRAB-1.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_9-SCREEN-GRAB-1.jpg?resize=300,158 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OZZY-NEFN-UHDMMOV177_9-SCREEN-GRAB-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Ozzy Osbourne in “No Escape From Now.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFilm still/Paramount+\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>",

Didn’t know what I’d do if I did.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Second Time Around” follows a waitress (Onslow) who, “while closing a café, is confronted by a mysterious older woman (Goodall),” according to a press release. “At its core, this film is an intimate, time-bending story about love, grief and the weight of moments we don’t yet realize will come to define us.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe short, which has partnered with LGBTQ+ charity MindOut, won best sci-fi at the HollyShorts Film Festival in August as well as the grand prize at London’s Ealing Film Festival. It will broadcast on Channel 4 in the U.K. this fall as a finalist for best British film at the Iris Prize LGBTQ+ Film Festival in partnership with Film4. After its debut, “The Second Time Around” will be available to stream on the Channel 4 website for a year.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Second Time Around” is produced by Ash Horne and Max Marlow with the support of 42, in association with A Marlow’s Production, Dull Boy Pictures and Two Magpies Entertainment.

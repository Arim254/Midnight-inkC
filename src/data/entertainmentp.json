    "body": "\n\tVintage movies and soundtracks buff Nicolas Winding Refn, Oscar-winning “The Brutalist” composer Daniel Blumberg and music supervisor Mary Ramos — known for her long-standing collaboration with Quentin Tarantino — are among high-caliber guests set to attend Italy’s new Sounds Like a Movie (SLAM) festival dedicated to soundtracks.\n\n\tThe three-day event, featuring live performances, screenings, panels, masterclasses and workshops, is being launched in Milan by Italian label CAM Sugar.\n\t\n\n\tThe inaugural SLAM event, to be held Nov. 14-16 at the Triennale Milano museum, is bowing in tandem with the 65th anniversary of CAM Sugar. The label boasts the world’s largest catalog of Italian film soundtracks, with over 2,500 original titles including Nino Rota’s compositions for Federico Fellini’s “La Dolce Vita” and “8 1/2,” their “Morricone Segreto” album drawing on Ennio Morricone’s lesser-known experimental compositions for films and “Eli Roth’s Red Light Disco: Dancefloor Seduction From Italian Sexploitation Cinema” compilation featuring tracks handpicked by Roth that was released earlier this year.\n\n\n\t“SLAM is a tangible example of what we are constantly working towards: enhancing not just the deep connection between music and images, but also between the people who carry out this precious cultural endeavor,” said Sugar Group CEO Filippo Sugar in a statement. “We are proud to inaugurate this event that we believe will help make Milan a truly international hub for music and cinema.”\n\n\tThe fest will open with a panel on soundtrack preservation held by Gianluca Farinelli, head of Italy’s venerable Bologna Film Archives film restoration lab. He will chat with Stéphane Lerouge, who curates the Écoutez le Cinéma collection at Universal Music France and CAM Sugar’s Andrea Fabrizii. Winding Refn will hold an onstage conversation with genre films specialist Manlio Gomarasca. Ramos and Holly Adams, who is Universal Music Group’s head of soundtrack and score, will hold court with Italian journalist Dario Zonta about soundscapes in the “Cinematic World of Ennio Morricone.” \n\t\n\n\tFollowing a screening of “The Brutalist,” Zonta will also host an onstage conversation with Blumberg about his Oscar-winning score blending experimental pieces with traditional genres like period jazz and soundtracking its finale with the 1978 Italo disco hit “One for You, One for Me” by La Bionda.\n\n\tLive events at SLAM will comprise concerts by multi-hyphenate Emile Mosseri, who composed the 2021 Oscar-nominated soundtrack for “Minari”; Dustin O’Halloran, winner of an Emmy for his title theme to Prime Video’s “Transparent”; and a set by Italian trance music producer Lorenzo Senni.\n\n\tPictured above (from left to right), Nicolas Winding Refn and Daniel Blumberg. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe marquees on Broadway will remain illuminated after the musicians union announced it had reached a tentative agreement on a new contract, averting a strike that would have severely impacted the theater industry. Without the deal, 23 musicals — including hits such as “Hamilton” and upcoming shows like “Chess” with Lea Michele — would have had to stop performances.\n\n\tAFM Local 802, which represents musicians, said the tentative pact with the Broadway League and Disney Theater Production includes wage increases, as well as a pledge to increase contributions to the union’s health fund. A strike was set for Thursday, but the agreement was reached just under the wire at 4:30 a.m. \n\t\n\n\t“This three-year agreement provides meaningful wage and health benefit increases that will preserve crucial access to healthcare for our musicians while maintaining the strong contract protections that empower musicians to build a steady career on Broadway,” AFM Local 802 President Bob Suttmann said in a statement. \n\n\n\tEarlier this month, Broadway producers avoided another potentially catastrophic shutdown when Actors’ Equity reached an agreement with producers on a new contract for theater performers. Broadway had a record-setting season in 2024 to 2025, earning revenue of $1.9 billion. However, the business has also struggled with the high costs of producing shows like buzzy productions such as “Sunset Blvd.” and “Gypsy.” There are also concerns that government subsidies that helped Broadway theaters come back after more than a year-long closure has expired and may not be renewed.\n\t\n\n\tNegotiations on a new contract for musicians have been underway since Aug. 31 when the prior deal ended. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe beloved “Karate Kid” franchise is headed to the British stage next spring, with a major national tour set to kick off in April 2026.\n\n\tProducers Naoya Kinoshita, Kumiko Yoshii, John Gore and Kenny Wax have revealed that “The Karate Kid – The Musical” will make its U.K. premiere with an extensive tour prior to planned West End and Broadway productions. \n\n\tWritten by Robert Mark Kamen, who penned the original 1984 film that starred Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita, the musical features music and lyrics by Drew Gasparini. The production reimagines the coming-of-age story through movement and music, centered on the mentor-student relationship between Daniel LaRusso and Mr. Miyagi.\n\t\n\n\t“William Goldman said about Hollywood ‘No one knows anything.’ He was right,” Kamen said. “Who knew that 43 years after I wrote the original script for ‘The Karate Kid,’ we would see these very same characters acting and singing on the British stage in a story that is as fresh and universally relevant as it was four decades ago.”\n\n\n\tThe original film became a cultural phenomenon following its theatrical release, earning Morita an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor. The franchise has since expanded to include three sequels, a 2010 remake starring Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan, the Netflix series “Cobra Kai” (2018-2025), and this year’s sixth film, “Karate Kid: Legends.”\n\n\tThe musical received its world premiere in St. Louis in 2022, playing to sold-out houses and rave reviews.\n\n\tAmon Miyamoto directs, with choreography by Keone and Mari Madrid. The Tony Award-winning design team includes scenic designer Derek McLane, costume designer Ayako Maeda, lighting designer Bradley King, sound designer Kai Harada and projection designer Peter Nigrini. John Clancy provides orchestrations, with music supervision and arrangements by Andrew Resnick and wigs and hair design by Tommy Kurzman.\n\t\n\n\tThe show opens April 28, 2026 at New Wimbledon Theatre before visiting 11 cities across England, Scotland and Wales through Aug. 1. The tour schedule includes stops in Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Oxford, Milton Keynes, Glasgow, Sheffield, Sunderland, Birmingham and Cardiff. \n",

    "description": "\n\t“Mockbuster,” an upcoming Australian documentary that dives into the “eccentric, fast-and-loose filmmaking world” of The Asylum, the B-movie studio ",
    "body": "\n\t“Mockbuster,” an upcoming Australian documentary that dives into the “eccentric, fast-and-loose filmmaking world” of The Asylum, the B-movie studio best known for the “Sharknado” franchise and numerous low-budget Hollywood copycat films, has been acquired by Giant Pictures for worldwide distribution. \n\n\tThe film is set to have its world premiere at the Adelaide Film Festival on Oct. 24th followed by a North American festival run and a U.S. theatrical release late spring 2026. Umbrella will distribute the film in Australia and New Zealand.\n\t\n\n\t“Mockbuster” marks the — double — feature directorial debut of Anthony Frith. With a once-promising film career flattened to corporate video gigs, the Australian decided to pitch himself to The Asylum to direct a lost-world dinosaur epic. \n\n\n\tAs per the doc’s description, “Against all reason, the studio famous for its guilty-pleasure exploitation films, says yes. What follows is a madcap production of ‘The Land That Time Forgot’ in suburban Adelaide, shot in just six days on a budget that could generously be described as ‘aspirational.’”\n\n\tBut Frith wasn’t just directing the “The Land That Time Forgot” — he was also helming the behind-the-scenes documentary “Mockbuster,” aimed at “capturing the beautiful mess of full-blown B-movie filmmaking.” \n\n\tBetween demanding LA executives, a game but bewildered cast, and his own self-doubt, the pressure builds. What emerges is not just a chronicle of chaotic production, but according to the synopsis is an “unexpectedly tender portrait of chasing the dream through the absurd hustle of genre filmmaking — and finding a different kind of success behind the scenes.”\n\t\n\n\tIt adds: “Throughout the shoot, Frith navigates the gloriously chaotic orbit of Asylum producer Brendan Petrizzo and studio Founders David Rimawi, David Latt, and Paul Bales, as he attempts to keep a prehistoric adventure afloat amid rubber dinosaurs, last-minute rewrites, and caffeinated panic.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I went into this project thinking that directing a dinosaur movie for The Asylum would be fun, and that it would make for a hilarious behind-the-scenes doc,” said Frith. “From the outside, they look like Hollywood’s punk rockers, working fast and loose. But somewhere between receiving the script on Sunday and shooting on Monday, I started to see their true genius: controlled chaos – a method that, against all odds, produces movies audiences keep coming back for.”\n\n\t“Mockbuster” is executive produced by “Tickled” filmmaker David Farrier, and was acquired by Nick Savva, general manager of Giant Pictures, who also serves as executive producer alongside Madeleine Schumacher, Alex West, Ty Morse, Phil Laboon, Ari Harrison, and Cam Rogers.\n\n\t“’Mockbuster’ is a love letter to ambition, chaos, and the people who somehow make movies happen anyway,” said Savva. “The Asylum’s business model is legendary and we’re thrilled to finally share a behind the scenes look at how in the world they’ve managed to succeed in such a big way.”\n\n\tThe film was co-written by Frith and Sandy Cameron, and produced by David Elliot-Jones, Cameron, and Naomi Ball. It was supported by Screen Australia, with the South Australian Film Corporation and Adelaide Film Festival Investment Fund, in association with VicScreen.\n\n\t“Mockbuster is a one-of-a-kind documentary – offbeat, chaotic and ultimately, full of heart,” said Screen Australia head of documentary Richard Huddleston. “Following director Anthony Frith, the team’s singular vision to create the next B Grader gives audiences an entirely original, access all areas ticket into the film industry.”\n\n\tThe film is produced by Mostly True Media and Walking Fish Productions. Major production investment came from Screen Australia, in association with South Australian Film Corporation, Adelaide Film Festival, Giant Pictures and VicScreen. It was financed with support from KOJO Studios, Green Marble Productions and Time Horse Productions.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSpanish-language giant TelevisaUnivision said third-quarter profit declined as the company continued its efforts to streamline operations and downturns in linear advertising outpaced new gains in efforts to bring advertisers to streaming.\n\n\tThe company said net income fell to $90.5 million, compared with $180.9 million in the year-earlier quarter, when TelevisaUnivision enjoyed a gain from the sale of a portfolio of towers that weren’t core to its business. Revenue was off 3%, to $1.27 billion, compared with a little more than $1.3 billion in the year-earlier period.\n\t\n\n\t“Our third-quarter results demonstrate the results of our disciplined execution of our reimagined content strategy and the continued momentum” of the company’s ViX streaming service, said Daniel Alegre, the company’s CEO, in a prepared statement. \n\n\n\tTelevisaUnivison said advertising revenue fell 6% to $755 million during the quarter, citing a decline in linear viewership for its media assets. Subscription and licensing revenue rose 3% to $493 million, thanks in part to consumer interest in ViX in the United States.\n\n\tTelevisaUnivision has been working to bolster its balance sheet after Alegre took its corporate reins of TelevisaUnivision from Wade Davis, the former Viacom CFO who orchestrated a buyout of Univision in 2020 before merging it with Mexico’s Grupo Televisa in 2022, ceded his CEO role to him. Alegre was president and chief operating officer of Activision Blizzard, which was acquired for $69 billion by Microsoft. Davis remains TelevisaUnivision’s vice-chairman.  Since Alegre joined last year, TelevisaUnivision has been working to streamline operations that had previously been siloed by geographic region. The company owns media assets in both the United States and Mexico.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMorocco has been selected as the country in focus at the upcoming European Film Market (EFM), which will run Feb. 12-18 as part of the 76th Berlin International Film Festival. \n\n\t“With its rich cinematic heritage, internationally acclaimed filmmakers pushing boundaries and an ongoing thriving creative community, Morocco has established itself as a dynamic bridge between Africa, the Arab world and Europe,” the EFM said in a statement. “The country’s presence at the Berlinale and the EFM stretches back decades and underscores its strong ties to the international film industry, with Moroccan stories and talent regularly featured in the festival and market program.”\n\t\n\n\t“Moroccan cinema has a proud history of storytelling that resonates far beyond its borders,” noted Berlin fest chief Tricia Tuttle. “From auteurs such as Nabil Ayouch, Faouzi Bensaïdi, Asmae El Moudir, Halima Ouardiri or Maryam Touzani to a new wave of emerging filmmakers, Moroccan voices bring distinctive perspectives to the Berlinale and to festivals worldwide. Their work draws on deep cultural roots while speaking to contemporary issues with originality and power and we are thrilled to celebrate this creative energy at the European Film Market.”\n\n\n\tThe EFM also noted that Morocco, with diverse landscapes ranging from the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara Desert and historic cities such as Marrakech, Ouarzazate and Casablanca, has become an increasingly attractive hub for international productions. Morocco most recently welcomed productions such as “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” and Nicolas Cage’s “Lord of War” sequel. The country offers a 30% rebate, VAT tax exemption, up to 80% equipment rental discount, hefty discounts on hotels and English-speaking technicians.\n\t\n\n\t“The Moroccan film and media landscape has reached a new level of international visibility,” said Berlinale Pro director Tanja Meissner in the statement. “It combines a strong national cinema with an openness to international collaboration, offering high production value, skilled professionals and distinctive locations. These factors, along with targeted support mechanisms, make Morocco one of the most compelling focus countries in recent years.” \n\n\t(Pictured above: Nabil Ayouch’s “Everybody Loves Touda.”)\n",

The debut spotlights the growing important of so-called “programmatic” advertising, or digital commercial inventory that is purchased via algorithms that help seek out particular consumers based on geographic region or potential interest in a particular product or service, among other factors.\n\t\n\n\tAmazon Web Services expects to lure companies that might not have been able to afford the cost of running real-time bidding applications or the data processing required to make it happen.\n\n\n\tThe new AWS product will provide noticeable savings and fewer obstacles notes Stephanie Layser, global head of ad tech solutions at AWS.\n\n\tCiting data, Amazon Web Services projects that the programmatic advertising market could reach $2.75 trillion by 2030, thanks to increased mobile and digital usage. \n\n\tIn recent months, many companies have struck alliances involving their demand-side platforms. Amazon has secured alliances with with Netflix, Disney and SiriusXM. The hope is that giving marketers the chance to buy a broader set of programmatic inventory from a single venue might reduce the number of commercials they show to the same consumer, and improve the effectiveness of commercials by distributing them with more precision.\n\n\tReal-time bidding involves the use of split-second auctions that help process millions of requests for inventory from advertisers, and helps marketers put their messages in front of a better defined audience while not overexposing those consumers to the same commercials again and again — a challenge that has only grown as more people migrate to streaming.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Royal Shakespeare Company‘s multi-award-winning stage adaptation of Studio Ghibli‘s beloved animated classic “My Neighbor Totoro” will continue its London engagement at the Gillian Lynne Theatre through Aug. 30, 2026, the producers have revealed.\n\n\tExecutive producer Joe Hisaishi and the RSC, in collaboration with Nippon TV and Improbable, also released new images to mark the extension announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“My Neighbor Totoro”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tManuel Harlan\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAdapted by Tom Morton-Smith from Hayao Miyazaki’s celebrated 1988 animated feature film, the production is directed by Improbable Co-Founder Phelim McDermott. The show has won six Olivier Awards and five WhatsOnStage Awards since its October 2022 global premiere at the Barbican, where it broke box office records for most tickets sold in a single day. Following critical and audience acclaim, the production returned to the Barbican for a limited run in autumn 2023 before closing in March 2024.\n\t\n\n\tThe cast features Victoria Chen as Mei, Ami Okumura Jones as her older sister Satsuki, Dai Tabuchi as Tatsuo, Jacqueline Tate as Granny, and Ai Ninomiya as the Singer.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“My Neighbor Totoro”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tManuel Harlan\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe production features design by Tom Pye, puppetry design and direction by Basil Twist, costumes by Kimie Nakano, lighting by Jessica Hung Han Yun, and movement by You-Ri Yamanaka. Joe Hisaishi’s iconic score is performed live in a new orchestration by Will Stuart, with sound design by Tony Gayle.\n\n\t“‘My Neighbor Totoro’ is a story of kindness, courage and the power of the imagination,” said RSC co-artistic directors Daniel Evans and Tamara Harvey. “Our audiences get to meet the magical creatures of the forest through extraordinary storytelling, dazzling puppetry and beautiful songs. Watching the joy on people’s faces when they meet Catbus, Chu, Sho and of course Totoro, is a delight to behold, and we can’t wait to welcome more people to the show at the Gillian Lynne Theatre.”\n\t\n\n\tKenichi Yoda of Nippon TV and Studio Ghibli added: “We are truly thrilled that ‘My Neighbor Totoro’s’ journey in London is set to enter its third year. It is our heartfelt wish that you will share this story with your loved ones — your family, friends, or partner. It’s a show that reminds you to cherish the people you love even more on your way home.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“My Neighbor Totoro”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tManuel Harlan\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Strictly Come Dancing” presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman have announced their departure from the BBC series.\n\n\tIn a video posted to both their Instagram accounts, the pair revealed they had made the joint decision to leave the show. “There have been some rumblings, and we want you to hear this from us,” Winkleman began. “After 21 wonderfully joyful years on ‘Strictly,’ we have decided that the time is right to step aside and pass on the baton,” Daly continued. \n\t\n\n\tDaly has presented the dance competition series since its start in 2004, whereas Winkleman joined as her co-host in 2014 when Sir Bruce Forsyth left the show. \n\n\n\t“We have loved working as a duo and hosting ‘Strictly’ has been an absolute dream. We were always going to leave together and now feels like the right time,” they continued in the video’s caption. “We will have the greatest rest of this amazing series and we just want to say an enormous thank you to the BBC and to every single person who works on the show. They’re the most brilliant team and we’ll miss them every day. We will cry when we say the last ‘keep dancing’ but we will continue to say it to each other. Just possibly in tracksuit bottoms at home while holding some pizza.”\n\n\n\tDaly added in her own statement on Instagram: “This isn’t a goodbye to glitter, sequins or Saturday night sparkle (I could never say goodbye to those!). ‘Strictly’ will forever hold a special place in my heart — but it does feel like the right time to hand over the reins.”\n\n\tThe 23rd season of “Strictly Come Dancing” is currently airing on the BBC, with its finale set for Dec. 20. Daly and Winkleman will continue to host the show through the end of this season, and then the hunt will be on for the BBC to find new presenters. \n\t\n\n\t“I’ve always believed it’s best to leave a party before you’re fully ready to go and I know the new hosts will be magnificent, I look forward to watching them take ‘Strictly’ to new heights,” Winkleman added in a separate post. “As for Tess — I’m so so lucky I got to stand next to you. You’re funny, kind, whip smart and a true friend and I love you.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“F1: The Movie‘s” hot streak in theaters propelled Imax to record third quarter earnings. The racing drama used Imax’s cameras to film key action sequences and prominently featured the premium theater brand in its marketing materials. “F1” grossed $97 million worldwide on Imax screens, making it the company’s most successful release of the year so far. \n\n\tImax also got a lift from other summer and early fall hits such as anime breakout “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” and horror hits such as “Weapons” and “The Conjuring: Last Rites.” \n\t\n\n\tRevenue at Imax was up 17% year-over-year, topping out at $106.6 million. Net income at the company increased 48% to $22.6 million. Adjusted earnings per share ended up 47 cents, a 34% increase from the prior year period. Shares of Imax climbed more than 2% in pre-market trading on the strength of the latest earnings report. \n\n\n\tImax licenses its technology to theater chains, in addition to sharing in box office revenues from its screens. The company installed 38 systems during the quarter, which was down 22% However, it has installed 95 systems in 2026, up from 88 systems last year.\n\n\tThe company touted the wide range of films, from scary movies to spectacle adventures to local language favorites such as Japan’s “First Slam Dunk,” that had drawn crowds in their venues. The company also screened a concert film, “The Grateful Dead Movie,” and the 50th anniversary re-re-release of “Jaws” during the quarter. Historically, Imax has been associated with comic book adventures that appeal to fanboys and fangirls. \n\n\t“Imax is moving into a new position — building to something bigger — and our performance for the quarter and year to date demonstrate we’re breaking out and delivering at a higher level,” said Rich Gelfond, CEO of Imax, in a statement. “We continue to deliver results that exceed expectations and transcend the broader marketplace – thanks in large part to our unique, diversified global content portfolio spanning Hollywood, local language, music and more.”\n",

'cause Kristen also spills on how some red flags still manage to sneak past the casting stop sign -- just look at the contestants who got booted after their racist and homophobic posts resurfaced.\n      \n    \n          Lastly, Kristen also tackled Harvey’s burning question -- who’s crazier in the casting process … men or women? Trust us, you’re not gonna wanna miss her answer!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Sex\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

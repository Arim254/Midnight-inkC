    "body": "\n\tThe International Film Festival of India (IFFI) will spotlight emerging directors in its 56th edition through a competitive section featuring seven first-time filmmakers from across the globe.\n\n\tThe festival has assembled five international titles alongside two Indian productions for its Best Debut Feature Film of a Director Award. The category’s victor takes home the Silver Peacock trophy along with INR10 lakh ($11,270) and a certificate of commendation.\n\t\n\n\tIndian director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra leads the jury evaluating the competition. He’s joined by Australian editor-director Graeme Clifford, German actor Katharina Schüttler, Sri Lankan filmmaker Chandran Rutnam and English cinematographer Remi Adefarasin.\n\n\n\tAmong the international entries, Tribeni Rai’s “Shape of Momo” arrives with notable festival credentials. The Nepali-language feature was among five Asian projects spotlighted at the HAF Goes to Cannes market showcase and was a Film Bazaar Work-in-Progress selection before launching at Busan and competing for San Sebastián’s New Directors Award. The Sikkim-set story tracks a woman named Bishnu who challenges the status quo in her female-dominated household, pushing against patriarchal traditions.\n\n\tSpain’s Gemma Blasco makes her feature bow with “Fury,” which played both SXSW and San Sebastián earlier this year. The film examines sexual violence aftermath through an actor who processes her New Year’s Eve assault by performing “Medea,” while her brother struggles with guilt over the attack.\n\n\tChristina Tournatzés claimed director and screenwriter prizes at Munich for “Karla,” her German-language debut. The 1962-set true story dramatizes a young girl’s legal action against her father’s abuse.\n\t\n\n\tEstonia’s Tõnis Pill drew Fipresci jury prize attention at the SCHLINGEL fest with “Fränk,” tracking a 13-year-old’s struggle to adapt after domestic violence upends his life, until an unusual friendship provides direction.\n\n\tIranian helmer Hesam Farahmand, previously known for shorts and documentaries, tackles class tension in “My Daughter’s Hair.” The narrative kicks off when a father sells his child’s hair to afford a laptop, only to face ownership claims from a wealthy family.\n\n\tMexico’s Ernesto Martínez Bucio captured Berlin’s new Perspectives competition with “The Devil Smokes.” His feature depicts five children left alone who project their fears through their grandmother’s mental illness.\n\n\tThe Indian entries also include Shivraj Waichal’s Marathi feature “Ata Thambaycha Naay!” (Now, there’s no stopping!), based on actual events involving Mumbai sanitation workers who pursued education later in life with encouragement from a municipal officer.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 20th Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival (JAFF) will open with Garin Nugroho‘s musical “Opera Jawa” and close with Aco Tenriyagelli’s feature directorial debut “Comedy Buddy” in Yogyakarta.\n\n\tThis edition marks a milestone for the festival, which was first held in 2006. Carrying the theme Transfiguration, JAFF20 highlights the festival’s two-decade journey and the transformation of Indonesian and Asian cinema during that period.\n\n\n\tThe opening film, originally premiered at JAFF’s inaugural edition in 2006, will be screened in its original 35mm celluloid format at a ceremonial program at Universitas Gadjah Mada’s Gelanggang Inovasi dan Kreativitas. “Comedy Buddy” is produced by Bion Studios and Spasi Moving Image.\n\t\n\n\tJAFF20 will present 227 films from 43 countries across competitive and non-competitive programs. Eleven feature films will compete in the main competition for the Golden and Silver Hanoman Awards: “A Useful Ghost” by Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke, winner of the Grand Prix at the 2025 Cannes Critics’ Week; “Amoeba” by Siyou Tan; “Becoming Human” by Polen Ly; “Flames” by Ravi Shankar Kaushik; “Girl” by Shu Qi, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival; “Hair, Paper, Water” by Nicolas Graux and Trương Minh Quý; “Lost Land” by Akio Fujimoto; “On Your Lap (Pangku)” by Reza Rahadian, winner of four awards at Busan; “Summer’s Camera” by Sung Divine; “Sunshine” by Antoinette Jadaone; and Pingyao winner “The World of Love” by Yoon Ga-eun.\n\n\tThe Indonesian Screen Awards will feature 13 Indonesian films competing across nine categories, with four new categories added this year: Best Production Design, Best Sound, Best Original Music and Best Poster Design. \n\t\n\n\tCompeting titles include “A Thousand Shades of Purnama” (Seribu Bayang Purnama) by Yahdi Jamhur; “Agak Laen: Menyala Pantiku!” by Muhadkly Acho; “Better Off Dead” (Tinggal Meninggal) by Kristo Immanuel; “Dancing with the Body” (Lenggak-Lenggok) by Andi Imam Prakasa; “Dopamine” (Dopamin) by Teddy Soeriaatmadja; “Ikatan Darah” by Sidharta Tata; “Mothernet” by Ho Wi Ding; “Rangga & Cinta” by Riri Riza; “Smothered” (Legenda Kelam Malin Kundang) by Rafki Hidayat and Kevin Nugroho; Indonesia’s Oscar entry “Sore: A Wife from the Future” by Yandy Laurens; “The Period of Her” by Erlina Rakhmawati, Praditha Blifa, Sarah Adilah and Yulinda Dwi Andriyani; “The Tiger” by Ardiansah Sulistiana; and “Worn Out” (Judheg) by Misya Latief. “Ikatan Darah” and “Mothernet” will have their Indonesian premieres at JAFF20.\n\n\tNon-competition programs include 22 feature films and 27 short films in Asian Perspectives, and nine Indonesian features in the Indonesian Film Showcase, including “Lost in the Spotlight” (Lupa Daratan), which marks Ernest Prakasa’s return to the director’s chair.\n\n\tThe Panorama program will feature works by acclaimed Asian directors, including “It Was Just An Accident” by Jafar Panahi, winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes 2025, and “Two Seasons, Two Strangers” by Miyake Sho, winner of the Golden Leopard at the Locarno Film Festival 2025.\n\n\t“Indonesian cinema continues to show significant growth. In just the first quarter of 2025, cinemas recorded 35 million admissions, or around 44% of the total audience in 2024,” said Ifa Isfansyah, JAFF festival director. “A remarkable milestone this year was the animated feature ‘Jumbo,’ which broke records by surpassing 10 million viewers. Indonesian films have also premiered at major international festivals and brought home prestigious awards.”\n\n\tThe festival continues its partnership with Cinema XXI as the main screening venue.\n\n\tJAFF20 will continue collaborations with longtime partners including the Asian Film Academy and Netflix. Under the Asian Film Academy collaboration, JAFF will bring director Ann Hui for a masterclass and screen two of her seminal works, “A Simple Life” (2011) and “July Rhapsody” (2002), in newly restored 4K versions. The collaboration will also present seven Hong Kong feature films and four short films.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix programs include Reel Life Film Camp, a hands-on workshop for entry-level professionals, and Creative Asia, a forum bringing together creators from across Southeast Asia featuring filmmakers including Kimo Stamboel, Joko Anwar, Erik Matti and Kulp Kaljareuk.\n\n\t“Last year, we introduced the Sneak Peek program, giving filmmakers a special platform to present early footage of their upcoming releases. This year, Sneak Peek will feature ‘Four Seasons in Java’ by Kamila Andini,” said Alexander Matius, JAFF program director.\n\n\tJAFF Market returns with six programs: JAFF Future Project, Content Market, Talent Day, Film & Market Conference, Market Screening and Film Lab, held Nov. 29 through Dec. 1 at Jogja Expo Center.\n\n\tJAFF20 runs Nov. 29 through Dec. 6.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGiulio Base began his journey with the Torino Film Festival from the ground up.\n\n\t At just 17, in 1982, he attended the very first edition, then called Cinema Giovani (“Festival of Young Cinema”) and co-founded by Alberto Barbera. From that moment, he was hooked. \n\n\tOver the next four decades, as the festival grew in name, scope, and reputation, Base built a career both in front of and behind the camera, earning acclaim for his directing work and gaining international recognition for his theologically themed films. Forty-one years after that first encounter, he returned to where it all began as the festival’s artistic director.\n\t\n\n\t“The Torino Film Festival has always been known as a prestigious, auteur-driven event,” Base says. “That will never change, it is who we are. But I wanted to add another dimension, something more popular, glamorous, and open. I wanted films that appeal not only to cinephiles and students but also to those who might not usually attend festivals. My goal is to preserve Torino’s auteur spirit while making it more accessible and exciting for everyone.” \n\n\n\tBase also sought to rekindle the youthful spark that first drew him to the event. He kept the focus on debut and sophomore features while renewing the selection committee, appointing six new members under the age of 30. \n\n\t“Let’s be honest,” he says with a laugh. “Italy can be a country of old men. I wanted a fresh perspective. Their vision and their approach to cinema helped shape a competition that remains true to the festival’s founding spirit: youthful, daring, and determined to change the world, or at least change cinema.” \n\t\n\n\tNow in his second year at the helm, Base has focused on clarity and curation to create a festival that feels both manageable and memorable. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTorino Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I am not a fan of overly complicated or cluttered lineups,” he explains. “Some festivals screen hundreds of films, and as a viewer, that can be overwhelming. I prefer quality over quantity. Our festival runs for eight days with three main competitions: features, documentaries, and shorts, each presenting 16 titles. That means two films per day per section. The program is clear, balanced, and easy to navigate.”\n\n\tA figure of wide-ranging tastes and curiosities, Base holds doctorates in literature and philosophy as well as in theology. His eclecticism is most apparent in the festival’s Zibaldone program, one of his signature contributions. Named after poet Giacomo Leopardi’s celebrated “hodgepodge,” the section follows no single path, blending restorations, tributes, special screenings, premieres, and works connected to the festival’s guests. \n\n\tAlongside a 24-title Paul Newman retrospective, this year’s Zibaldone will showcase standouts from festival guests such as Terry Gilliam with “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” and Alexander Sokurov with “Russian Ark,” interspersed with playful programming that follows broader thematic rhythms. \n\n\tTo mark the 50th anniversary of Pier Paolo Pasolini’s final film, the festival will screen “Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom” exactly 50 years to the day of its first public screening on Nov. 22, 1975.\n\n\tAt the same time, the festival’s artistic director is bringing a similar creative energy to his curatorial vision.\n\n\t “In English, the term ‘director’ means both the director of a film and the director of a festival,” Base says. “I think that is fitting, because I approach the festival as I would a movie: with a vision, a sense of timing, and a belief in collaboration. For our opening ceremony, both Alexander Sokurov, a Russian honoree, and Sergei Loznitsa, a Ukrainian jury member, will appear on the same stage. For me, that is deeply symbolic. Cinema stands against war. It stands for dialogue, for peace, and yes, for love.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe voice cast for animated movie “Unknownia” – directed by “Cryptozoo’s” Dash Shaw – will feature Tim Roth, Barbara Sukowa, Angeliki Papoulia, Larry Fessenden, Robbie Crandall and Sabrina Sickler.\n\n\tIn the film, little Rory needs to save her father who’s disappeared on a treasure quest during an unfortunate encounter with a dragon. Luckily, a weasel or mysterious beings called The Shapes are there to help. \n\n\n\t“Tim was my hero. ‘Reservoir Dogs’ was the reason I went to film school. I really tried not to geek out on Tim Roth in the recording studio,” said Kyle Martin, who produces alongside Jane Samborski and Emily Wolver for Electric Chinoland and Mubi. \n\t\n\n\t“When Tim came in and started doing the weasel, we were like: ‘Oh my God, this is so not what we thought we wanted. And boy, were we wrong.’ That’s exactly how this weasel should sound like. At that point we’d been working on this for years, and yet it completely changed the meaning of the scenes. Tim is just that kind of a performer.” \n\n\tThe whole cast brought their own ideas, he stated, underlining Shaw wanted to stay away from “broad, cartoony voices.” \n\n\t“He really likes an interesting voice, one that has texture to it or an accent. Angeliki, Tim, Barbara – they all check that box. As performers, they have very varied backgrounds and they bring something to the characters that certainly adds depth. It breathes life into them.”\n\n\tMartin added: “When you watch this, and the same thing happened with ‘Cryptozoo,’ you’re really feeling these characters, you know? That was the goal.”\n\t\n\n\tAnd yet “Unknownia,” presented at Tauron American Film Festival’s industry event U.S. in Progress, is “very different” from festival hit “Cryptozoo.” Also visually. \n\n\t“Cryptozoo’ was R-rated. There was nudity. This is not that. It’s a PG movie and a fantasy adventure,” said Martin. Awarded at Sundance, “Cryptozoo” focused on people trying their best to protect endangered mythical creatures. \n\n\t“We want ‘Unknownia’ to be more of a family movie for kids. Dash and Jane [Samborski] made it with their daughter Castle in mind. They wanted this to be something that they could share with her and it was factored into the look as well.”\n\n\tThe director agreed: “When you’re 10 or 11 years old, you see an unusual animated movie for the first time. Maybe it’s your first non-Disney film – something like ‘The Secret of Nimh’ or ‘Spirited Away’ – and it’s like the 10-year-old’s version of discovering the French New Wave,” Dash Shaw wrote to Variety.  \n\n\t“It’s like: ‘Oh wow, a movie can be like this? Nobody told me.’ ‘Unknownia’ is that movie we made for our daughter.”\n\n\tAccording to Martin, “Unknownia” was born out of a “legacy of Miyazaki films and independent alternative animation.” \n\n\t“Also narratively, because many of his films [made for Studio Ghibli] have a young female protagonist that’s on this coming-of-age journey. The dream would be to be thought of in that same category,” he said.\n\n\t“International audiences are more familiar with that. In the U.S., it just doesn’t exist. There’s big studio stuff coming from Pixar or DreamWorks and nothing else except foreign films that get brought in. There’s really no independent English-language animation, so in a way, it’s in its own lane.”\n\n\tDuring her journey, Rory will come to a realization that those she used to unquestionably admire are ultimately just human as well.\n\n\t“It’s about wealth and greed, but it really is about that experience of learning that the people you look up to as a young child, your parents, your elders, have their own problems and their own flaws. They might not be the best role models,” said Martin.\n\n\t“For me, personally, it’s a sad realization, although it’s something everybody goes through and relates to. It might be a little melancholic, but the movie is hopeful.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 56th International Film Festival of India has unveiled the 10 films competing for the ICFT-UNESCO Gandhi Medal, an international honor that recognizes cinema promoting peace and inter-cultural dialogue.\n\n\tInstituted at IFFI‘s 46th edition, the award is presented in collaboration with ICFT (International Council for Film and Television) Paris under the aegis of UNESCO, celebrating work that honors Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of non-violence and peace.\n\t\n\n\tLeading the lineup is Iraqi filmmaker Hasan Hadi’s directorial debut “The President’s Cake,” which won both the Audience Award and Caméra d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival’s Directors’ Fortnight section. The film, selected as Iraq’s entry for the international feature Oscar at the 98th Academy Awards, follows nine-year-old Lamia in 1990s Iraq as she scrambles to bake the President’s birthday cake amid U.N. food sanctions and political unrest.\n\n\n\tAlso competing is Chilean auteur Sebastián Lelio’s musical drama “The Wave,” which premiered at Cannes. Loosely inspired by the 2018 Chilean feminist protests, the film follows university student Julia as she navigates a recent sexual assault within the context of a burgeoning movement.\n\n\tOther contenders include Nadia Falls’ “Brides,” which premiered at Sundance and earned a grand jury prize nomination in the World Cinema Dramatic category. The British-Muslim coming-of-age drama follows two teenage girls who run away from troubled lives, confronting radicalization, identity and belonging.\n\n\tNorwegian filmmaker Eirik Svensson’s “Safe House,” which won the Audience Dragon Award for best Nordic film at the Göteborg Film Festival, depicts 15 harrowing hours inside a Doctors Without Borders hospital during the 2013 Central African Republic civil war.\n\t\n\n\tKosovian filmmaker Ujkan Hysaj’s debut “Hana” makes its world premiere at IFFI, exploring an actor who joins an art-therapy program at a women’s rehabilitation center in Kosovo, helping war survivors transform pain into expression.\n\n\tIranian actor Ebrahim Amini’s directorial debut “K Poper,” which screens at Tallinn Black Nights, follows an Iranian teenage girl obsessed with a K-pop idol who dreams of traveling to Seoul despite her mother’s refusal.\n\n\tJapanese auteur Kawase Naomi’s “Yakushima’s Illusion,” starring Vicky Krieps, premiered at Locarno with a Golden Leopard nomination. The existential drama follows a French transplant coordinator in Japan searching for her missing partner who has become a “Johatsu” — one of Japan’s thousands of annual disappearances.\n\n\tRounding out the selection are Anupam Kher’s “Tanvi the Great,” about a woman with autism who resolves to complete her deceased father’s dream of saluting the flag at Siachen Glacier; Praveen Morchhale’s Urdu-language drama “White Snow,” about a young filmmaker whose work is banned by a religious leader; and Jitank Singh Gurjar’s Toronto Netpac Award winner “Vimukt” (“In Search of The Sky”), a Braj-language film about an elderly couple taking their son with intellectual disabilities on a pilgrimage to Maha Kumbh festival.\n\n\tThe jury will be chaired by Ahmed Bedjaoui, artistic director of the International Film Festival of Algiers, alongside Xueyan Hun, vice-president of ICFT and director of the Platform for Creativity and Innovation; Serge Michel, vice president of UNICA; Tobias Biancone, former director-general of the International Theatre Institute; and Georges Dupont, director-general of ICFT and former senior international civil servant at UNESCO.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDavid Harbour is not having a good month. But attendees at the Los Angeles premiere event on Nov. 6 for the fifth and final season of Netflix’s “Stranger Things” might not have noticed.\n\n\tHarbour was all smiles on the red carpet, particularly as he playfully hugged co-star Millie Bobby Brown, and they took selfies with fans. The two arrived at the event together, and even traded compliments in interviews on the carpet: Brown told “Entertainment Tonight” that she “obviously had a really special bond with David because we have a father-daughter relationship, and we do every scene together… It’s been so special to have him along the journey for me.” When Harbour spoke with ET, the only outlet he granted an interview, he said of Brown: “I adore her, and I’ve been proud to watch all of them grow up and become such great artists… this particular project is so special, and we’ve gotten to know each other so deeply.”\n\t\n\n\tIf the two seemed overly chummy on Thursday, perhaps that was the point: The premiere event came just days after the U.K.’s Daily Mail Nov. 1 report that Brown had filed a complaint of bullying and harassment against Harbour prior to the start of production of Season 5. Neither star commented on the story, and Harbour limited his interactions with the press at the premiere.\n\n\n\tThe news of Brown’s complaint against Harbour has threatened to overshadow coverage of the final season of “Stranger Things.” But insiders say that even before the recent news, Harbour wasn’t expected to take part in press junkets for the show due to his busy filming schedule. (His upcoming projects next year include HBO’s “DTF St. Louis” — with Jason Bateman and Linda Cardellini — and Marvel’s “Avengers: Doomsday,” opening December 2026.)\n\t\n\n\tPR experts suggested to Variety that the red carpet choreography — as well as the full cast’s appearance together on stage at the TCL Chinese Theater prior to screening Episode 1 — was meant to send a message that the cast is united, and that the show is bigger than any one person. “The goal in these situations is to make it no worse,” one crisis PR exec said.\n\n\tInstead, Netflix leaned into the imagery of Harbour and Brown being playful on the carpet, posting a video of the two as they greeted fans. Brown’s fashion brand, Florence by Mills, liked the video and posted a heart emoji, and many of the fan comments on the post suggested that they thought the reports of drama between the two stars was much ado about nothing. Photos taken inside the party also show the two being chummy.\n\n\n\tSources with knowledge of the situation have confirmed to Variety that there was an investigation into Brown’s complaint, and that it was resolved. As father and daughter on the show, as well as comrades in arms, Brown and Harbour share multiple scenes in Season 5 of “Stranger Things,” including a scene observed by a reporter for Variety during a day-long visit to the set in July 2024.\n\n\tRepresentatives for Brown, Harbour and Netflix did not respond to requests for comment. On the carpet, the show’s creative leaders — creators Matt and Ross Duffer, and executive producer Shawn Levy — were asked about the complaint directly by the Hollywood Reporter; while they declined to speak about the actors by name, they all spoke about the importance of ensuring their cast feels safe within the “family” atmosphere of the show.\n\n\t“I’ve read a bunch of stories and they range from wildly inaccurate to…there’s so much noise around it,” Levy told the outlet. “But the truth is that we view this crew and this cast as family, and so we treat each other with respect, and that’s always been bedrock.” Said Ross Duffer: “We’ve been doing this for 10 years with this cast, and at this point they’re family and we deeply care about them. So, you know, nothing matters more than just having a set where everyone feels safe and happy.”\n\n\tIn the first four seasons of “Stranger Things,” Brown’s character, Eleven (introduced in Season 1 as a quiet, pre-teen girl with extraordinary telekinetic abilities), and Harbour’s character, Hopper (introduced as the burnout chief of police of Hawkins, Indiana), form a surrogate father-daughter bond. In Seasons 2 and 3, Eleven and Hopper experience some friction due to Hopper’s overprotective concern for Eleven’s safety; by Season 4, the characters operate in totally separate storylines and don’t share a scene until the last minutes of the season finale.\n\t\n\n\tThe Daily Mail report was sourced to “a friend” of Harbour’s ex-wife Lily Allen. That’s of note because the story of Brown’s complaint broke amid a flurry of attention surrounding Harbour’s divorce from singer-songwriter Allen, whose new album, “West End Girl,” goes into extensive detail about Harbour’s alleged infidelity, as in the song “Pussy Palace.” In his review in Variety, Chris Willman said the album “is a divorce record with a capital D,” and that Allen and Harbour split up “after five years of marriage that apparently started as a fairy-tale romance for her and ended in the devastation strewn throughout every track on the album.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi first auditioned for “Predator: Badlands,” he didn’t know he was trying out to play the first of the titular aliens to be the hero, instead of a villain, in the 38-year-old franchise. In fact, he didn’t know he was auditioning for a “Predator” film at all. He wasn’t even provided with any written lines.\n\n\t“All it said was ‘a creature,’” Schuster-Koloamatangi says. “The little character brief just said, ‘It’s all up to your interpretation.’”\n\t\n\n\tThe 24-year-old actor has had to rely on his own imagination. As a kid in Auckland, New Zealand, he relished going to his local cinema and drank in movies as often as he could. But as the child of a Tongan father and Samoan mother, “I grew up not really seeing too many Polynesians on screen,” he says. “I didn’t think it was possible, to be honest, to have a brown face on screen, especially from my end of the world.” \n\n\n\tInstead, as part of a family of athletes, Schuster-Koloamatangi saw rugby as a possible career path. “Growing up, it’s either rugby or go to university and get a nine to five,” he says. “Acting was never, never something I thought was even possible.”\n\n\tEven so, he found himself drawn to performing. In middle school, he started his own YouTube channel — until it was taken down for copyright infringement (which he didn’t know at the time would be an issue). In high school, he acted in school plays and took a media studies course his final year, where he met two Tongan filmmakers and peppered them with questions. A few months later, they called him in to audition for a small role in a New Zealand miniseries about a Kiwi rugby player. He nailed it.\n\t\n\n\t“It was only, like, three scenes, and my character died,” he says. But from there he landed an agent, and then the lead role in the 2021 miniseries “The Panthers,” about a group of Polynesian youths who form their own political movement inspired by the American Black Panther Party. It was then “the switch started.”\n\n\t“I’ve never been good at anything off the bat,” he says. “I’ve always just kind of been average or below average, so I’ve had to really work at things to be good. It’s cultivated just a ruthless work ethic.” He took acting courses to hone his craft and dedicated himself to the profession.\n\n\t“I have big ideas,” he says, breaking into an infectious grin. “When I decided fully that this is the career path that I want to chase, it came with a lot of big visions. … I see myself going to the Oscars. I see myself with all the top players. I see myself being on the biggest stage possible. And I’ll get there somehow.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi, Elle Fanning and Dan Trachtenberg at the “Predator: Badlands” premiere in London.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLia Toby/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWith his performance in “Predator: Badlands,” Schuster-Koloamatangi has taken his first big step into that spotlight. He plays Dek, a young member of the alien species known as Yautja who is cast out by his father for being the “runt” of the clan. To prove himself, Dek travels to Genna — known as one of the deadliest planets in the galaxy due to its profusion of lethal animal and plant life — so he can hunt and kill the Kalisk, understood to be an unkillable predator in its own right.\n\n\tBecause the role is so intensely physical, for Schuster-Koloamatangi’s second audition, director Dan Trachtenberg (who also helmed the 2022 “Predator” prequel film “Prey” and the animated feature “Predator: Killer of Killers,” released in June) had the actor tackle an obstacle course with a team of stunt performers — some of whom were also gunning for the part.\n\n\t“The way Dimitrius moved was so cool, so ferocious — so much cooler than the stuntmen were doing it, frankly,” Trachtenberg says. “What I was not prepared for was him throwing down on set and really being incredibly powerful and intense. He just insanely elevated the movie far past what we could have expected.”\n\t\n\n\tSchuster-Koloamatangi’s only co-star, Elle Fanning, plays Thia, an android who’s been stranded on Genna without her legs. Dek carries her on his back for most of the film. It’s a fitting metaphor for the task that faced Schuster-Koloamatangi, who has the weight of the entire film on his fearsome shoulders, in a performance delivered entirely in the invented Yautja language, wearing a full Yautja body suit with his face replaced via performance capture CGI.\n\n\tHe spoke with Variety about his unconventional audition process, the how he bonded — literally and figuratively — with Fanning, the experience of shooting in his home country and how he mastered the Yautja language.\n\n\t\n\t\tSince you didn’t know the character, let alone the movie, at first, how did you audition for “Predator: Badlands”?\t\n\n\tI had to do one in English, one in an alien language that’s up to you to make up. I had a lot of fun just remixing Samoan and Tongan and gibberish. From there, I got a call back, and it was an obstacle course. I was like, what is this job? \n\t\n\t\tHow did you approach the obstacle course?\t\n\n\tBecause I am competitive, I had to keep reminding myself, “It’s not a race.” I had to keep slowing down to focus on performance, just show as much creature as I could. They had been drip feeding us information throughout. I was finding out, like, the director is Dan Trachtenberg, the studio is [20th Century]. I was doing a little research in the background, like, “Wait, this could be Predator, but I’m not sure.” So I just took a swing and was aiming my performance towards a Predator-like creature. I think it worked.\n\t\n\t\tHad you done obstacle course, Ninja Warrior-type stuff before?\t\n\n\tNo, that was my first time. I was like, “What am I even doing here?” They had stunt men hanging around doing flips and whatnot. The people that I was auditioning with, a few of them were stunt people that had been in the game for a long time. It would have been easy to kind of overthink it. But I don’t know. I grew up playing sports and just having the mindset, “You’re supposed to be here.” Not getting too caught up in imposter syndrome, you know? Just give it your best. If it doesn’t work out, it’s not mean to be. But it was really exciting. I felt like I was in “Wipeout.” I was just missing the big red balls. It was cool, man.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t20th Century Studios\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOnce you got the part, when did you understand that you were going to be carrying Elle Fanning on your back?\t\n\n\tSo that’s funny, too. The first read through of the script, I saw that Dek carries Thia on his backpack, and I was like, “This is a great idea, but this will be like, CGI, right? This isn’t actually going to be a thing because she has legs in real life.” But with Dan, he can make anything a reality. We were rehearsing with the stunt team for a month all the different rigs that they had come up with to carry Elle on my back. It worked really well. Elle’s legs were in a sling. They both had us in harnesses. When we were strapped up, we couldn’t get ourselves out. Someone had to unscrew us to release us. It was a massive learning process. They were making up rigs on the spot to accommodate the both of us. I think it adds texture to the film, and it makes it feel real and authentic. You can see it on Dek’s face.\n\t\n\t\tI understand that you met Elle when you started work in rehearsal. How did you break the ice there?\t\n\n\tIt happened so naturally that I couldn’t even tell you when exactly we just started clicking. I had my reservations a little bit before meeting her. She’s a massive name, and with that comes a little bit of uncertainty on how she might be. But Dan said that Elle was really down to earth and lovely to work with, and from the first second of properly talking to her, I could tell she was going to be a breeze. Once we were strapped up, I was always checking in and making sure she was good, and I think she really appreciated that. So the trust formed quite fast. \n\n\tWe had literal hours strapped together. A lot of the time they would just leave us strapped because it was too much time and effort to release us while they moved around cameras. There would be days where we just stayed linked up and would just talk about random things. \n\t\n\t\tI imagine bathroom breaks must have been very tricky.\t\n\n\tOh man, those were the worst. In the suit, you can’t really get in and out too easy. So I’m kind of cramped up in the bathroom stall. My body’s in a C shape, trying to track the aim. It was a whole process. If someone had a camera in there, they would make a lot of money from the positions I tried to be in to go to the bathroom.\n\t\n\t\tYou also performed in the Yautja language, invented by linguist Britton Watkins solely for this film and “Predators: Killer of Killers.” \t\n\n\tI thought I wouldn’t have to learn any lines because in the audition process — they were like, “Make up a language.” So I was like, “Man, I can just freestyle the whole time. This is great!” Later on, they told me I had to learn a whole language. So that was fun.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat was your process to learn that language?\t\n\n\tI was on Zoom calls with the linguist, probably three to four times a week the month before [filming]. When I wasn’t doing stunt work and training, I was at home, drilling the language over and over. That’s the only way to learn any language. You just have to fully immerse yourself in it. And because it was constructed like a real language, there was a lot of material that Britton had come up with to learn. I’d just have it in the car when I’m driving everywhere, on my speaker at home, when I’m chilling, practicing. The clicking with the throat was probably the hardest just get my head around, because you have to breathe out while breathing in at the same time. It was just getting my mouth and my throat used to those movements, and a lot of honey ginger teas.\n\t\n\t\tWere you always speaking the language on set, or were you sometimes doing it in English?\t\n\n\tThe majority of the time was in the language. There would be a few days where we’d get new lines, like, 10 minutes before we shot, and we couldn’t get the translation fast enough from Britton, so those would have to be shot in English and then later [recorded] again in Yautja. \n\t\n\t\tYou grew up in New Zealand, so how did it feel to shoot in your home country?\t\n\n\tI was very proud to show off my backyard. You’d hear all the Americans raving about the landscape, and I’m standing there like, “Yeah, this is standard” — but in actuality, I hadn’t been to some of these locations before and I was just as in awe. Hūnua Falls, Bethells Beach, the Redwoods in Rotorua — these were all places that I had never been before, even though it was my home. A lot of locals don’t really take the time to see their own country. They always feel like they have to sightsee somewhere else. I was very blessed and fortunate because of the access the film gave us. If it wasn’t for the shooting, I wouldn’t even be allowed in some of these places that are blocked off to the public. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t20TH CENTURY STUDIOS\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat was it like to see your performance transformed into Dek’s face as a Yautja for the first time?\t\n\n\tI only just watched the full cut when we were in London for the premiere. I hadn’t seen any cuts with CGI when I started doing ADR. It was just still my face. So I didn’t really know if this was going to work. I worked really hard on the Predator’s animalistic and primal behaviors, that presence that he has in all the previous films. But at the same time, I was also trying to inject my own unique flavor to Dek — they shouldn’t all look and be the same. \n\n\tBut once I saw all of the finished product, it was so cool to see. And it was really cool to be able to separate myself from it as well. A lot of the times when I’m watching things that I’m in, I can’t help but just nitpick at things. But since it looks like an alien, I can just watch the story and fully invest, like an audience member.\n\t\n\t\tNow that you’ve got your first Hollywood movie behind you, what about the past year has most surprised you?\t\n\n\tIt sounds really bad, but I think because I’ve seen it so clearly in my mind before that it didn’t really come as too much as a surprise. The best thing that has come out of this year was I was able to bring my family to the premiere in L.A., and they got to see me work. None of them are in the industry, so none of them really know anything about what I do. I’ll go home and tell them, like, “Work was good,” but they didn’t really know even what to ask. \n\t\n\t\tDo you know what you’re next going to do?\t\n\n\tI’m working on a local New Zealand film at the moment. I land on Saturday back home. I go into rehearsals on Sunday and then we start shooting on Monday. I get to get back to my roots a little bit. It follows a young Tongan immigrant who is trying to make a living for himself back in the ’90s. It goes from a comedy-drama to a thriller. I’m really excited for it. I get to play human for this one, which is great.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers for all eight episodes of “All Her Fault,” now streaming on Peacock.\n\n\tThe wild ride that is Peacock’s “All Her Fault” stars Sarah Snook and Jake Lacy as Marissa and Peter Irvine, ultra-wealthy Chicago parents of 5-year-old Milo (Duke McCloud) driven to the edge when he’s kidnapped. That Milo’s kidnapper is Carrie (Sophia Lillis), the nanny of another couple at their private school, sets off a series of events that, by the end of “All Her Fault,” have completely unraveled the Irvines’ lives. To say the least! In the finale of the limited series — created by Megan Gallagher, from Andrea Mara’s 2021 novel of the same name — Marissa has murdered (yes, murdered!) Peter in order to protect herself and Milo.\n\n\t“All Her Fault” is Snook’s first television role since she won the drama lead actress Emmy for the final season of “Succession,” and since winning both an Olivier and a Tony award for the feat of playing all 26 characters in “The Picture of Dorian Gray” on stage. (She filmed “All Her Fault” in Melbourne, Australia, her home base, in between the play’s first run on the West End and its move Broadway last spring.) As an executive producer on the show, as well as its star, Snook tells Variety that she was attracted to “All Her Fault” because she’d “never done a thriller — I’ve never really dived into this world.” The character, who is under duress from the show’s first minute, also posed an acting challenge, she says, because she “wanted to see what it’s like to live inside a harrowing moment.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Also, I read the book,” Snook says. “And it’s got a plot twist that just couldn’t say no to, you know?” That’s actually plot twists, plural. With its cliffhanger endings, and gasp-inducing reveals, “All Her Fault” joins recent thrillers such as “The Hunting Wives,” “Paradise” and “Presumed Innocent” as chaotic new entries in the 2.0 version of OMG TV.\n\n\tA synopsis: the blast radius from Milo’s kidnapping causes chaos among the Irvines, specifically with Peter’s siblings, Lia (Abby Elliott) and Brian (Daniel Monks). Their family mythology — an insidious fiction of Peter’s, as it turns out — is that, during their early childhood, Lia had caused an accident that’s left Brian disabled and in chronic pain. The fallout changed all of their lives: A guilt-ridden Lia has continuously struggled with addiction, Brian is depressed and has no self-worth — and both of them rely on Peter for their livelihoods. But then, in the show’s sixth episode, Peter finally confesses that he was the one who had tripped Brian when they were kids. This revelation is significant, because it shows Marissa that Peter is willing to lie about just about anything.\n\n\tIncluding the fact that Milo isn’t their biological son! Which Marissa discovers in the most batshit possible way. Five years earlier, during their drive home from the hospital after Milo’s birth, Peter and Marissa were in a horrific car wreck with another car, driven by a young mother named Josie (Carrie’s real name) and carrying her infant son, both of whom survived the accident. In the finale, Peter admits to Marissa, who had been knocked unconscious in the crash, that he had switched Josie’s living baby with their newborn who’d been killed.\n\n\tYears later, Carrie figured this out after meeting Milo, immediately establishing a connection with him and realizing that he too has synesthesia (long story!). Yes, it’s a stretch, but the mentally unstable Carrie is in fact correct, and, after becoming fixated on the idea that her baby had lived through the crash, poses as a nanny for Jenny (Dakota Fanning) — a parent at Milo’s school — so she can infiltrate Milo’s life.\n\n\tBut before Carrie can expose Peter to Marissa as the villain he really is — that is, not only a baby-snatcher himself, but a killer who’d also bludgeoned Carrie’s father (and fellow kidnapper) to death — Peter shoots Carrie in their living room. Milo had just been “found,” because Peter had taken him from the motel room where Carrie and her dad were keeping him, leaving the child in a car to be turned into a police station. Carrie’s dad had recorded his interaction with Peter (including the murder!); rather than let Carrie play the recording, Peter silences her at any cost. Marissa does listen afterward, but what’s she to do? Peter is right that the police will take Milo away, should Marissa tell them what he’s done.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSo as you can see, Marissa is really in a bind. But the Chekhov’s gun of “All Her Fault” is Peter’s deadly allergy to soy. After subbing out his EpiPen with an expired one, and getting rid of the First Aid kit in their car, Marissa she deliberately kisses him …. after just eating soy-filled food. And then she watches him intently as he goes into anaphylaxis — at first seeming like she wants to help, and then revealing her clear purpose. And Detective Alcaraz (Michael Peña) even figures it out eventually, but because he’s done some morally questionable things for the sake of his own son, he tells Marissa he won’t come after her for murdering Peter.\n\n\n\tWhew! Right? In its final moments, “All Her Fault” deliberately gives the finger to its title, and ends with the pleasingly matriarchal image of Marissa and Jenny (who’s also gotten rid of her husband, though not via crimes) drinking wine and looking lovingly at their two sons playing together.\n\n\tIn an interview this week, Snook talks about choosing the role of Marissa, what the show’s final shot means to her and what the most recent message on the “Succession” group chat is.\n\n\t\n\t\tThis is your first TV acting role after “Succession.” What was it that about this project and the part itself that made you want to do it?\t\n\n\t“Succession” is a career-defining highlight that I really have had to work hard to put into a separate category — it’s not something that can be repeated. There’s no trying to find projects that are going to be like “Succession” — “Succession” is its own thing, and I’d like to keep it that way!\n\t\n\n\tBut I’d never done a thriller. I’ve never really dived into this world. They’re a popular genre at the moment, and I wanted to see what it’s like to live inside a harrowing moment. Like, what is the sustainability of doing that as an actor? Also, I read the book, and it’s got a plot twist that just couldn’t say no to, you know?\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI read the book to prepare for this, and the ending is very different — it’s just a news article about Peter’s death six months later from an allergy attack abroad. Were you talking to Megan Gallagher about the kinds of things she was changing to fill out that ending?\t\n\n\tI respectfully let Megan take the lead on that, obviously, and she’s such a brilliant writer, and had really expanded the universe of what the book offers. There’s the novel that explores it in different ways, and it’s set in Dublin — and then we’ve got the series that is set in Chicago and really goes into different worlds.\n\n\tChanging the ending in the ways that we did — obviously, the major part isn’t changed as much. But having Marissa have that last say was really important to wrapping up our story.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s go into the spoilers! So at the beginning of the finale, Marissa learns that Peter is not only is a literal murderer, but that he’d switched Milo — I can barely say this — with their infant who had died in the car accident. How do you even approach figuring out how a person would deal with such revelations?\t\n\n\tExactly! How do you begin? It felt very Greek tragedy to me. It felt very much like these are gods and deities fooling around with human lives, and making bad decisions. Marissa definitely had to have the last word, I think. In the book, it’s a quiet final moment — an allusion to Peter dying via poisoning. But here, it’s much more activated for Marissa to take back the control of her own narrative.\n\n\tAnd dealing with the revelation that Milo isn’t her son — if it was real life, you receive that information, and it doesn’t all sink in in that one moment. There’s going to be something beyond Episode 8 and the show’s final moments: The revelations will still continue to sink in, and the shock will still continue to ricochet for Marissa and for Milo. Fortunately, she has the friendship of Jenny to find strength from.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou alluded to this, but in “All Her Fault,” there are so many scenes of heightened emotion — within five minutes, she’s found out that her child is missing, and that pitch is sustained over eight episodes. Yet “Succession” was so singularly restrained. What was your experience of that? \t\n\n\tYeah, I mean, that’s part of the reason I said yes, and I wanted to be a part of the project as well. Shiv was such a restrained and repressed character emotionally. She had short outbursts of rage and other kind of bites. And also, her maternal instincts — who knows?\n\t\n\n\tWhereas Marissa definitely, confidently, wants to be a mum. Always has wanted to be a mum! Always wanted to have that close family life. It’s something that she didn’t have growing up. We hear a little bit about her history. But she’s got a sort of small life with her husband, her brother-and-sister-in-law and her kid. And that’s what she likes. It’s cozy. And to have it all sort of blown up is — that’s a challenge coming in as an actor to think, “OK, we’re gonna have to sustain this for how long?” But it’s also a rewarding challenge.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAt first, it seems like maybe Marissa is going to have to stay quiet about all the things Peter did, because, as he says, she’s scared that Milo will be taken away from her. Did you decide for yourself when it is that Marissa decides to kill Peter?\t\n\n\tYeah, there’s a moment in the scene with Jenny. It’s one of those things where you kind of go, “OK, now there’s no turning back.” So the “now there’s no turning back” is the moment she’s just kissed him, I think. There’s turning back up until the deed is done.\n\n\tI think she knows intuitively that she can’t have this revolting human being around her anymore, and have any kind of influence over her son. Imagine the custody battle with that man! So she knows that he has to go. He just has to go. And he deserves to.\n\n\tBut what does the future hold for Marissa if that truth ever comes to light? Which is why I really loved that scene with Detective Alcaraz, where he sort of infers that, yes, he knows everything, and yet still has the grace to tell her that he knows everything — and also to stand back and say, but I’m gonna let it go.\n\t\n\t\tYou don’t have a line in that scene, I think! What was that like to play with Michael Peña?\t\n\n\tIt’s amazing. I mean, acting is always reacting and listening, and so there may not be actual lines, but there’s all sorts of things going on in her head. Listening to these revelations and calculating, “OK, am I safe? Am I not? Is this good for me? Is this bad for me?” And just getting to watch Michael Peña act is great. \n\t\n\t\tThe scene when Marissa kills Peter by kissing him with her soy-infected mouth — can you talk about filming that with Jake Lacy as Marissa watches Peter die? \t\n\n\tIt’s a really complex scene to approach, because you don’t want to lean into melodrama or histrionic kind of, like, “Die!” — like throwing the eyebrows up and eyeballs down. There’s just so much release going on, and it’s a very complex, very difficult scene to play. And hopefully we got the tone right, but it was one I was worried about.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAnd it seems like she doesn’t want to indicate too early to him that she’d done it on purpose in case, maybe, someone is about to appear with an EpiPen or something.\t\n\n\tYeah, absolutely.\n\t\n\t\tBut it’s so clear in those final moments, when he’s looking at her and she glares at him, and says, “That’s true — I manage your allergy for you.” Were there other versions when she reveals it earlier?\t\n\n\tProbably in the edit there were times when in enacting it, there’s indications earlier. But it’s better for tension to leave it right to the last minute, because you want to know, “Is he gonna die knowing? Is he gonna die not knowing?” There’s much more tension in that. I think.\n\t\n\t\tI mean, he sure dies knowing! In the final scene, when Jacob and Milo are playing as Marissa and Jenny are watching — hilarious. Can you talk about that scene, and how you decided to play it?\t\n\n\tYou have to be able to breathe out with a story like this. You’ve got to be able to go, [exhales], “Oh, OK.” Like, everything’s probably gonna be OK. You have to find, what’s the rainbow here? And the risk is to make something too shiny and too wrapped up and too like, “Aha! Now the two friends can be friends forever, and what’s gonna happen next?”\n\n\tSo we had to try and strike a balance between too shiny and also realistic. But realistically, what Marissa and Jenny really found in their friendship was that it was the strongest bond in their lives. So for me, it totally made sense: I’m gonna move as close as I can to create a community, to really, to really start again in the way that I’m in control of my own narrative. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCouSarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBy the end of the show, Marissa has murdered her husband — which she’s gotten away with — after she has learned that her son was stolen from the woman who’d kidnapped him. This is all traumatic! What do you think Marissa would do next?\t\n\n\tIt’s crazy. I mean, for a little while, just deal with the whiplash of all those revelations. I think at some point Milo is going to have to know or find out, or he’s going to cotton onto something, and she has to support him in the dealing of grief of losing his father. He’s gotta get over all the trauma of being away from us, and being kidnapped. But then also, he’s going to deal with the grief of losing his father as a 5-year-old. And the difficulty for Marissa to uphold which memory: The memory of this amazing dad, the one that Milo remembers? Or the real truth of who Peter really was. And that’s going to be difficult for Marissa.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tMarissa is extremely rich, which is Shiv Roy-like, though the characters are so different. Did you ever think of Shiv as you were creating Marissa?\t\n\n\tOnly in the sense of like that they’re wealthy characters. I think Shiv is in a different category. She’s in this astronomical wealth elite, whereas Marissa is more socially wealthy and you might meet her on the street. You wouldn’t meet Shiv on the street.\n\t\n\t\tNo, Shiv doesn’t go on the street! \t\n\n\tI think Marissa is more of a reflection of myself, maybe — much more personable, warm. Whereas Shiv is much more of a cold-hearted bitch. She’s a different kind of stern character.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat do you think Marissa sees in Jenny that creates that immediate bond? I mean, she really risks her well-being by telling Jenny what Peter did.\t\n\n\tI think she sees a comrade, a compatriot. In the shooting of the scene in the bathroom — where they turn up in the same dress — we had to make sure that that was a really believable rapport-building, grounding, beginning of a friendship. That you go, “I really like that person.”\n\n\tSome people just have chemistry, and you can’t fake it; Marissa and Jenny, they have chemistry. They go well together. And this is a kind of circumstance that, unfortunately, has thrown them together. But they found real strength and empowerment from each other. And yeah, it is a risk to let her know what her plans are regarding Peter. But in some ways, you kind of have just got to offload, and share it with somebody. Maybe that’s the takeaway — keeping secrets to yourself is often doomed to fail.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t“Cold-hearted bitch” as she was, I do miss Shiv! Do you ever find yourself imagining what she might be up to?\t\n\n\tI think Jesse Armstrong, the creator, put it really well, when he said at one point, “I don’t really believe that people can change. They’re always going to be who they are, inevitably.” There’s an inevitability, I think, about people. And there’s something about that with Shiv, like she probably is still second next to Tom. In some ways, still in charge, and in some ways scratching, scrapping, reaching for — but always just missing out. And that’ll always be the source of great frustration and annoyance for her.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was the last text on the “Succession” group chat?\t\n\n\tLet me find out! I’ll see if I can say it — one second [looks at phone]. It’s been active recently, because they all came to the show, and I sent them a smiley face with love hearts and a celebratory-like emoji. But Dag wrote, “Can’t wait to see you later, Sarah!” And Fisher [Stevens] was like, “Good luck! Wish I could be there, but not in New York.”\n\t\n\t\tBoring! You filmed this in between your two stints of “The Picture of Dorian Gray.” Was it a relief to play one person instead of 26?\t\n\n\tYes! Although I don’t know if you could ever really describe this character — and what Marissa goes through — as a relief. But a different kind of compartmentalizing going on, yeah.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat’s next for you, do you know?\t\n\n\tDon’t know yet! Other than that, at the end of this press tour, I am unemployed. [cackles] And I’m quite happy about it.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

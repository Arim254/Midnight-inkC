    "body": "\n\tLionsgate U.K.’s “The Housemaid” returned to the top of the U.K. and Ireland box office, adding £2 million ($2.8 million) in its fifth weekend for a cumulative £26.1 million ($35.3 million), according to Comscore.\n\n\tUniversal’s “Hamnet” held firm in second place, collecting $2.7 million in its third weekend and lifting its total to $16.3 million. Sony’s “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” moved to third in its sophomore frame with $1.7 million, taking its running total to $7.8 million.\n\t\n\n\tWalt Disney’s “Avatar: Fire And Ash” continued its steady run in fourth place, adding $1.5 million in its sixth weekend for a cumulative $54.4 million. Disney also occupied fifth with “Zootopia 2,” which grossed $1.4 million in its ninth weekend, pushing its total to $42.9 million.\n\n\n\tEntertainment Film Distributors’ “Marty Supreme” followed closely behind, earning $1.3 million in its fifth weekend for a $18.4 million cume.\n\n\tNew releases filled much of the lower half of the top 10. Vertigo Releasing’s “Saipan” debuted in seventh place with $1 million, while Mubi’s “No Other Choice” opened in eighth on $841,000. Sony’s ‘Mercy’ landed ninth with $829,000, and Entertainment Film Distributors’ ‘Return To Silent Hill’ rounded out the top 10 on $785,000.\n\n\tLeading the new arrivals is Studiocanal’s family-friendly adventure “Kangaroo,” directed by Kate Woods and starring Ryan Corr and Deborah Mailman, which rolls out on more than 300 screens. The same scale of release is reserved for Black Bear’s action thriller “Shelter,” from Ric Roman Waugh, toplined by Jason Statham alongside Bill Nighy and Naomi Ackie. \n\t\n\n\tParamount also goes wide with horror entry “Primate,” directed by Johannes Roberts, while Disney adds Bradley Cooper’s “Is This Thing On?” to the marketplace. \n\n\tPicturehouse Entertainment releases Bryn Chainey’s “Rabbit Trap,” starring Dev Patel and Rosy McEwen, while BFI Distribution opens beloved 1962 British B-movie “Strongroom,” directed by Vernon Sewell. Altitude Film Distribution’s “Nouvelle Vague” by Richard Linklater adds further weight to the arthouse lineup, alongside Central City Media’s Golden Horse-winning Cantonese-language animation “Another World.”\n\n\tBollywood continues to maintain a visible theatrical footprint with Yash Raj Films’ “Mardaani 3” and Zee Studios International’s “Gandhi Talks,” while Amazon-backed FLOTUS documentary “Melania” lands on more than 100 screens. Rounding out the week are event-led offerings, including MusicScreen’s operatic presentation “Evgenij Onegin – Tchaikovsky” and CinemaLive’s Paris Hilton documentary “Infinite Icon: A Visual Memoir.” \n",

The edition includes a newly commissioned fold-out map of Ingary, printed on metallic paper and presented in its own dedicated map case. The book itself is quarter-bound in leather with printed art-silk sides, housed in a cloth-bound slipcase silk-screen printed with original artwork by illustrator Marie-Alice Harel. A cut-out window in the box reveals the map case beneath, designed to echo the four portals connecting the worlds Howl travels between.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIMITED-EDITION\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHowl’s Moving Castle\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tThe new edition features brand-new illustrations by Harel, whose work will appear extensively throughout the book, including two new full-color images.

The film broke box-office records in Japan upon release and earned an Academy Award nomination.\n\n\n\t“We’re excited to share our Limited Edition of one of the world’s greatest fantasy novels with the book’s generations of fans,” James Rose, Head of Editorial at the Folio Society, said in a statement. “Never has Sophie and Howl’s magical world been bettered in print.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“I want it to look like you,” resonates as the most romantic line exchanged between the two young men at the center of “Leviticus,” a tightly conceived, gripping queer horror that reaches for unassuming brilliance through a supernatural premise that’s as terrifying as it is thematically relevant. The statement implies that even if their fate is to be haunted, likely to death, by an entity that takes the form of the person they are most attracted to, they would choose for that malevolent force to personify each other. What is love if not a willingness to fight another person’s demons alongside them?\n\t\n\n\tTitled after the book in the Bible that features what some devotees interpret as a condemnation of homosexuality, calling it an “abomination,” this outstanding debut from writer-director Adrian Chiarella organically marries blood-curling fright with incisive social commentary. He joins a large contingent of accomplished Australian genre filmmakers working today (Jennifer Kent and Danny and Michael Philippou among them).\n\n\n\tChiarella introduces his two main characters while they hang out inside an abandoned mill. The boys challenge each other to throw heavy objects, which leads to intense roughhousing. That early scene, at first, seems typical of two young male friends asserting their masculinity in a juvenile manner. But then, blonde-haired Ryan (Stacy Clausen) kisses Naim (Joe Bird) while pinning him down on the ground. Conscious that in their small and mostly desolate Australian town, where everyone knows everyone, life still revolves around Christianity, they agree to keep their newfound, mutual desire a secret.\n\t\n\n\tPacked within that initial exchange is believably casual dialogue that conveys not only their inner concerns but also their relationship to their environment. Naim questions why Ryan acts so distant in school. The latter denies it, but his behavior responds to the fear of being ostracized if any suspicions were to arise. Around others, Ryan must keep up the performance of what’s expected of him. New in town after his emotionally stunted mother (Mia Wasikowska) chose to move them there, Naim is still making sense of this uninviting place. The dense fumes from nearby industrial facilities often float into the purview of cinematographer Tyson Perkins, a reminder of the harsh, isolated backdrop where the narrative unfurls. Visually, “Leviticus” reads like a social realist drama, which grounds even the most gruesome events under a veil of unnerving normalcy, as if they could happen anywhere.\n\n\tSomething sinister is set in motion when Naim discovers his intimate pal might have similar feelings for another boy, Hunter (Jeremy Blewitt), the local pastor’s son. When that relationship is brought to the adults’ attention, drastic action is taken. In front of the congregation, Ryan and Hunter meet with a “deliverance healer,” whose prayer, or spell, makes them convulse and contort to everyone’s shock —Naim’s in particular. The implication is that the righteous, homophobic “men of God” willingly invoke a demon to punish those whose sins they deem abhorrent. Chiarella is less concerned with the otherworldly mechanics, though they are clear enough, and instead focused on what it symbolizes. The entity they’ve been cursed with will morph itself into the object of their desire to test them, and if they surrender to lust, brutal violence will ensue.\n\n\tThe vicious paranormal entity is the embodiment of the self-hatred and shame certain religious groups impose on queer people, especially at a young age. Niam eventually receives the same spiritual “treatment,” and begins to see a fake version of Ryan following around. Bird’s pronounced eyes express Naim’s astonishment at the circumstances he’s found himself in, but also a genuine sadness and concern for Ryan. Both Clausen and Bird give cautiously tender performances laced with mounting dread and sorrow. Only being apart can they maybe remain safe. In Clausen’s case, the role is a dual one, since he must also play the version of Ryan who chases after Naim with the intend of causing him harm.\n\t\n\n\tAnd yet, as disturbing as realizing that he’s being taunted by something only he can see is, what’s most painful for Naim is knowing it was the person who’s supposed to love him most, his mother (Wasikowska plays her with stern coldness) who agreed for this hex to be bestowed upon him. Illustrated via the filter of horror, what happens to Naim and Ryan is, in essence, a heightened, ghostly reinterpretation of conversion therapy. With smartly pointed moments, however, “Leviticus” also takes the time to suggest homophobia tarnishes everyone’s lives, not only does with a certain sexual orientation, but also that of the father who won’t see his son again, due to either death or estrangement.\n\n\tTestament to the director’s assured control of his own concept, the tensest scenes are those when the young protagonists give into their desire for one another. They have experienced such violent attacks after being tricked into putting their guards down that trying to kiss or touch each other’s bodies fills them with anxiety, and yet they can’t help it. In one particular instance on a bus, Chiarella, knowing that the viewer will be on high alert, expertly toys with expectations. It’s a nail-biting scene that stands out as more intense than a run-of-the-mill jump scare. Not only because it’s logically built on the mechanics the filmmaker has established, but demonstrate Chiarella understands how long to let the scene run for powerful effect. The crux of the entire ordeal is that physical displays of affection carry life-or-death stakes, and yet Ryan and Naim are willing to take that risk.\n\n\tWith “Leviticus,” Chiarella wields horror in defense of queer love, avoiding easy sentimentalism, while also not surrendering to hopelessness, all while still satisfying the audience’s cravings for effective, bone-chilling uneasiness. Time will do its thing, but “Leviticus” does seem bound to earn a place in the pantheon of notable queer horror.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJessica Jones has officially returned to the MCU.\n\n\tDisney released the “Daredevil: Born Again” Season 2 trailer on Tuesday, which revealed Krysten Ritter’s street-level hero has made her way back and is teaming up with Charlie Cox’s Daredevil, aka Matt Murdock. The second season will premiere on Disney+ on March 24.\n\n\tSet to Donald Glover’s song “Lithonia,” the trailer brings back many of the major characters from “Daredevil: Born Again” Season 1, including Vincent D’Onofrio’s Kingpin, who’s now the mayor of New York City, Deborah Ann Woll’s Karen Page, who returned in Season 1 and is re-sparking her romance with Matt, plus Elden Henson’s Foggy Nelson, Matt’s best friend who was shockingly killed by Bullseye (Wilson Bethel) in the Season 1 premiere. His appearance in the trailer is likely a flashback or dream sequence. Michael Gandolfini’s Daniel Blake, Kingpin’s protege, and Arty Froushan’s Buck Cashman, the villain’s right hand man, also return in the trailer.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to a missing person’s poster, Matt hasn’t been seen in quite some time, but his alter ego Daredevil has been taking on Kingpin’s forces. He’s aided by Jessica Jones, who uses her super strength (and sarcasm) to beat up Kingpin’s goons.\n\n\n\t“I hope you can walk, because I’m not carrying you,” she says to an injured Matt, before helping him up. Like Cox, Ritter originated her role in Netflix’s run of Marvel shows in the 2010s. She starred in three seasons of “Jessica Jones” and teamed up with Cox’s Daredevil in “The Defenders.” She’s the first of Netflix’s characters to cross over into the main MCU apart from the “Daredevil” cast.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile in the trailer, Kingpin steps into a boxing ring to face off against an opponent, and Bullseye flashes a chilling smile and a wink after he escaped from prison in Season 1. There’s also a shot of Matthew Lillard’s mysterious new character, who joins the cast of Season 2.\n\n\tWatch the trailer below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tCharli xcx‘s “Brat” domination has translated to the big screen, with “The Moment” — Aidan Zamiri‘s mockumentary about the cultural phenomenon kickstarted by the pop star’s hit album — becoming A24‘s fastest-selling limited release to date. \n\n\tFollowing “The Moment’s” Sundance Film Festival premiere last week, more than 50 screenings have sold out across key markets. The movie, which opens in New York City and L.A. on Friday, is especially appealing to younger audiences, with the majority of ticket buyers being under the age of 35.\n\t\n\n\tTickets for Alamo Drafthouse screenings of the film alongside a livestreamed Q&A with Charli and Zamiri have also sold out and started to appear on secondary resale websites and Reddit. In addition, over 70% of the film’s premium large format screenings have sold out ahead of its wide release on Feb. 6. \n\n\n\tDirected by Zamiri, “The Moment” stars Charli as an alternate-reality version of herself grappling with whether to stay true to her art or cross over to the commercial dark side. When a sinister director, played by Alexander Skarsgard, is hired to make a concert film about her upcoming “Brat” tour, Charli faces the ultimate test. Alongside Charli and Skarsgard, “The Moment” also stars Rosanna Arquette, Kate Berlant, Jamie Demetriou, Hailey Benton Gates, Isaac Powell, Rish Shah, Kylie Jenner and Rachel Sennott.\n\n\tAt Variety‘s Sundance Studio, Charli spoke about her motivations behind making the film. “I was approached to make a more traditional tour film around the ‘Brat’ shows I was doing,” she said. “It kind of felt like a way to elongate the life span of the album for my record label. I was just not really into that. I was only interested in flipping the form of something quite traditional.”\n\t\n\n\tVariety also caught up with Zamiri in London before “The Moment’s” Sundance debut. The film marks the photographer and creative director’s first time helming a feature, which he found “terrifying.” \n\n\t“I’m very conscious that there is so much stuff made all the time, and I don’t want to ever contribute to noise in general,” Zamiri said. “There’s also the responsibility of communicating something which feels true and correct and meaningful. And I feel good about that. I’m sure there will be a mixed reception to it, or maybe everyone will love it! Who knows. But I feel really confident that it feels like me and it feels like Charli and it feels like us.”\n\n\t“The Moment” releases wide in the U.S. on Feb. 6 and in the U.K. on Feb. 20. \n",

    "body": "\n\tEthan Hawke is having a moment, the way fellow Newton boy Matthew McConaughey did a few years back. Onscreen since age 14 — yet taken for granted far too long — the undeniable talent behind those chiseled cheeks and snaggled teeth has been more visible than ever of late, finally earning Academy recognition for “Blue Moon,” in which he took the biggest stretch of his career: playing short, balding Broadway lyricist Lorenz Hart. “The Weight,” which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival but feels like it could have been made in the 1970s, features a role that fits more neatly within Hawke’s wheelhouse … but that doesn’t mean you’ve seen him like this before.\n\t\n\n\tAn old-fashioned, off-the-grid adventure story set during the Great Depression — a “Wages of Fear”-like wilderness trek, as John Huston or John Boorman might have told it, involving the transport of four packs of heavy gold bars — “The Weight” boasts not only Hawke (who’s clearly the main attraction) but also Russell Crowe. Making his feature debut, director Padraic McKinley had worked with both actors as an EP on TV miniseries (“The Good Lord Bird” and “The Loudest Voice,” respectively), talking them into participating in a modernized “The Treasure of the Sierra Madre”-style tale.\n\n\n\tIn Hawke’s case, Murphy could well be the most physical role he’s ever accepted. With his neat suit and greased hair, Murphy (who’ll be battered and bloody by the film’s finale) looks about as presentable as a mechanic possibly could. It’s not clear whether that’s his job — in 1933, a man would be lucky to have any job — or just his unique skill, as he improvises work with his dear girl Penny (Avy Berry) in tow, looking more than a little like the father-daughter grifter duo in “Paper Moon.” Murphy can study any problem and see a way through it, whether by engineering or simple human psychology.\n\t\n\n\tLooking for a place to live, fortune throws him a doozy of a predicament. A skirmish with three thugs (who turn out to be law enforcement officers) gets Murphy arrested and sent away to a labor camp for almost a year. If he can’t find his way to freedom, Penny will be placed in foster care. Escape isn’t an option, though a conniving warden named Clancy (Crowe) offers a path to early release: President Roosevelt has ordered all the country’s mines to close and the gold turned over to the federal government, but before that happen, Clancy aims to make an entire stockpile disappear.\n\n\tIf Murphy will agree to help him steal about half a ton or gold bars and move them five days through densely forested Oregon terrain, Clancy will sign his papers. He can take three men along to help transfer the load — he picks prison poker buddies Akers (Peter Lewys Preston), Rankin (Austin Amelio) and Singh (Avi Nash) — and will be accompanied by Clancy’s trusted gun Taggert (Alec Newman) and a great big ox of a brute named Letender (George Burgess). Again, escape isn’t an option, though accepting the task comes with considerable risk. Lose an ounce, and their lives are forfeit. Make it to the end, and chances are they’ll be murdered.\n\n\tWhile the pieces for a white-knuckle mission seem to be in place, “The Weight” has an uneven, lurching quality, where slogging through the picturesque-yet-endless expanse of tall trees (arboraceous Bavaria doubling for Oregon) is punctuated by bursts of excitement. Unconventional composers Latham and Shelby Gaines’ terrific, mood-setting score does a lot of the heavy lifting, so to speak, as the movie skips between set-pieces. In the film’s most unnerving sequence — wherein the crew must find a way to cross a rickety rope bridge, knowing it can’t take the weight of more than one man and one gold brick at a time — McKinley didn’t have an actual bridge to work with.\n\n\tBy this point, we’ve seen Murphy work miracles, using a tire jack and ingenuity to move a boulder out of the road. So why would he choose such a ridiculous solution, whereby he stands in the unstable middle and asks the others to toss him all 50 or so bricks one by one by one. It’s a foolish strategy — the film’s answer to the hardboiled-egg-eating contest in “Cool Hand Luke” — but one that McKinley isn’t equipped to shoot properly.\n\t\n\n\tFor that section of the film to work, a skeptical character needs to push back on Murphy’s plan, calling him crazy or questioning his judgment, so we collectively lean forward and watch with mounting satisfaction (and suspense) as his fingers jam and energy wanes every time a brick is thrown to him. The moment Murphy loses his footing and nearly plunges to his death, one brick away from his goal, audiences should be on the edge of their seats, primed to applaud when the deed is done.\n\n\tHeck, the whole film should feel like that. But apart from Murphy, the other characters aren’t nearly as three-dimensional — not even Anna (Julia Jones), a Native woman who joins the outfit for no logical reason beyond the clear fact that it makes the chemistry more interesting. Screenwriters Matthew Booi and Shelby Gaines weave subtle humor — and more overt racial politics — into the way the surly group engage with one another.\n\n\tEarly on, darker-skinned, Communist-minded Singh upsets the racist Rankin when he explains how the system threw him in with a whites-only prison detail. Later, Anna shares a powerful story about how she resisted harsh attempts to assimilate. Such details give “The Weight” a certain allegorical heft: All four of the prisoners, as well as Anna, are victims of an unjust system, thanklessly doing the heavy lifting for corrupt power-holders. Murphy doesn’t quite fit the mold, but in Hawke’s hands, he’s the most vivid character of all — crushed, clobbered and nearly drowned.\n\n\tIn the past, Hawke often played characters who were shy, scruffy and slightly unsure of themselves, but here he’s the film’s proactive problem solver — a classical hero more than capable of carrying the film.\n",

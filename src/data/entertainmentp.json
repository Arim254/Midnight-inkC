    "body": "\n\tDr. Peter Attia, who was recently named as a contributor to CBS News, put out a lengthy statement on X Monday morning saying he is “ashamed” of his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Attia and Epstein’s apparent friendship was revealed through emails included in the Department of Justice’s latest Epstein files release.\n\n\t“The purpose of the DOJ releasing these documents is clear: to identify individuals who participated in criminal activity, enabled it, or witnessed it. I am not in any of those categories, and there is no evidence to the contrary,” he wrote. “1. I was not involved in any criminal activity. 2. My interactions with Epstein had nothing to do with his sexual abuse or exploitation of anyone. 3. I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties.”\n\t\n\n\tAttia went on to apologize for his correspondence with Epstein. He called the emails “embarrassing, tasteless and indefensible.”\n\n\n\tAttia, a high-profile author, health influencer and celebrity doctor, was mentioned more than 1,700 times in the latest batch of files, which revealed a back-and-forth with Epstein that lasted long after the disgraced New York financier was hit with sex trafficking and prostitution charges. In a 2016 email to Lesley Groff, a former assistant to Epstein, Attia wrote, “I go into JE withdrawal when I don’t see him.”\n\n\tCBS News named Attia as one of 19 new contributors on Jan. 27. The move is part of editor-in-chief Bari Weiss’ mission to reshape the program for the modern era of media and newsmaking. Attia’s relationship with Epstein has ignited significant online blowback for CBS News. CBS has not yet confirmed whether Attia will remain a contributor.\n",

    "description": "\n\tChuck Negron, one of the three founding members of the rock group Three Dog Night and lead singer on some of their biggest hits, died Monday at age ",
    "body": "\n\tChuck Negron, one of the three founding members of the rock group Three Dog Night and lead singer on some of their biggest hits, died Monday at age 83. A statement from his publicist said Negron died peacefully at his home in Studio City, Calif., surrounded by family. \n\n\tNegron’s voice was heard as the lead vocalist on such hits as “Joy To The World (Jeremiah Was a Bullfrog),” “One (Is the Loneliest Number),” “Old Fashioned Love Song,” “The Show Must Go On” and “Easy To Be Hard.” \n\t\n\n\tAlthough no exact cause of death was given, a statement said that Negron struggled with heart failure in his final months, in addition to the chronic COPD he had dealt with for three decades.\n\n\n\tThree Dog Night was founded in 1967 by Negron, Danny Hutton and Cory Wells. The group struggled to find credibility with some rock audiences, who resisted the band for not writing its own songs as the singer/songwriter age took over. Yet they had 21 top 40 hits, many of them offering early shots to some of the top writers of the day. They recorded material by Nilsson, Randy Newman, Laura Nyro, Paul Williams, Neil Young, Robbie Robertson, Tim Hardin, Hoyt Axton and Leo Sayer, among others.\n\n\t“I like different songs for different reasons,” he told Rock Cellar. “I like ‘One’ because it was our first million-selling record, that one really put us in the game. It has a special place in my heart for other reasons too, it was done in one take, and at the time I was in awe of what came out of me, I couldn’t believe I’d done that. … I loved ‘Joy to the World’ because it became a signature song for us, and it’s still a hit to this day.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tThe group’s self-titled debut album came out on Dunhill in 1968 and went platinum. Wells sang most of the lead vocals on the first album, but, fatefully, the very first song on the very first LP, “One,” written by Nilsson, was sung by Negron. It went to No. 5 on the Hot 100.\n\n\tTheir following seven album releases, through 1974, all reached gold status. The group’s first No. 1 was “Mama Told Me Not to Come,” sung by Wells, in 1970, and the second was the Negron-sung “Joy to the World” in 1971.\n\n\tThe partnership fell apart in the mid-1970s, due in part to Negron’s well-documented and admitted struggles with drugs, including a heroin addiction that he finally kicked. The group disbanded between 1976-1981, then reunited from 1981-1985 before there was another fallout, this one more permanent. Hutton and Wells carried on under the Three Dog Night banner, and Hutton continues to tour behind it today, as the sole original member. Negron eked out a successful career as a solo artist on the oldies circuit for decades to come, until the pandemic put a halt to his touring.\n\n\tNegron estimated that at one point, he was spending $2,000-3,000 a day on drugs and spent millions of dollars on his habit over time. In 1991, Negron checked into rehab, later telling Rock Cellar of his time at CRI: “I wanted to cry help, and they took a spiritually and physically broken man, and they changed me with many tools and an unbelievable support group.” Later he did benefits for the rehab center, and would speak at hepatitis conventions to share his experiences with the condition.\n\n\tAn obituary provided by Negron’s representative said that although he and Hutton had been estranged for decades, they met up last year ” in a timely effort to exchange apologies and bury the hatchet.”\n\n\tIn a December interview Hutton did with Catalyst’s Bill DeYoung, he spoke of that meeting with Negron. “They’re making a documentary on us now, and the producer asked me… ‘Would you and Chuck ever get back together again?’ I just looked at her and said, ‘Absolutely not. No way.’ She said, ‘He would love to talk to you,’ and I said ‘Look, I don’t want to talk to him.’ A lot of hurt, all of that stuff. And then I finally said, all right, you know what? I’ll talk to him. So we went to his place – she had a whole crew there – and we hugged. And made up. It was wonderful. It was a great relief to get that burden … it’s not healthy to keep that anger. Anger always comes from hurt, I think.”\n\t\n\n\tThe third founding membrer, Wells, died in 2015 at age 74.\n\n\tNegron told Rock Cellar about the secrets of performing with COPD. “I reached a point where the COPD was going to prevent me from performing live; I could have literally died on stage,” he said. “But people aren’t going to pay to see someone singing with an oxygen mask on, so I had to do something or it was all going to be over. Luckily my girlfriend Amy stumbled across this pair of glasses that feed the oxygen from the tank, through the glasses, to the wearer. The cord has been modified to look like a guitar cable, so it’s more ‘rock ‘n’ roll.’ The audience can’t even tell. It changed my entire career.”\n\n\tNegron is survived by his wife, Ami Albea Negron; his children Shaunti Negron Levick, Berry Oakley, Charles Negron III, Charlotte Negron, and Annabelle Negron; his brother Rene (Jody) Negron, sister Denise (Janey) Negron; nine grandchildren, five nieces and two nephews, as well as his children’s mothers, Paula Servetti, Julia Negron, Robin Silna and Kate Vernon. \n",

    "body": "\n\tComedian Sherri Shepherd’s talk show “Sherri” is ending its run after four seasons, Variety has learned. News comes just as another daytime yakker, “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” also announced that it would wrap up at the end of 2026 after seven seasons. \n\n\tLionsgate’s producer/distributor shingle Debmar-Mercury confirmed the news Monday. “Sherri” had most recently been cleared through the 2025-2026 TV season on station groups like the Fox TV Stations, Nexstar, Hearst, Sinclair, Gray, Tegna and Sunbeam. Season 4 production will continue as planned, with the series airing its final episodes in the fall.\n\t\n\n\t“This decision is driven by the evolving daytime television landscape and does not reflect on the strength of the show, its production – which has found strong creative momentum this season – or the incredibly talented Sherri Shepherd,” Debmar-Mercury co-presidents Ira Bernstein and Mort Marcus said in a joint statement. “We believe in this show and in Sherri and intend to explore alternatives for it on other platforms.”\n\n\n\tLast season upon its pickup, Fox TV Stations exec vice president of programming Frank Cicha called the show “a linchpin of our daytime lineup.” \n\n\t“Sherri” tapes at New York’s Chelsea Studios and is both produced and distributed by Debmar-Mercury. \n\n\t“I don’t take it for granted that people welcome me into their homes daily,” Shepherd said last year when the show was renewed for a Season 4. “I work so hard to bring escapism to viewers’ lives through joy, laughter and inspiration, and I’m grateful that the audience has embraced what we do. I look forward to raising the bar and turning up the volume as we plan for our season four return.”\n\t\n\n\tThe former cohost of “The View,” actress, comedian and Emmy winner Shepherd first launched her own talk show in fall 2022. “Sherri” originally took over the time slots on the Fox stations that were previously occupied by “The Wendy Williams Show,” which Debmar-Mercury produced and distributed for 13 seasons.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBTS is mounting a big comeback with the announcement of both a livestreamed performance and a feature-length documentary, both airing on Netflix in partnership with Hybe.\n\n\tThe live performance, titled “BTS the Comeback Live | Arirang,” will stream on Netflix on March 21 at 4 a.m. PT / 7 a.m. ET. The concert will take place in Gwanghwamun in Seoul, just after the release of their new album “Arirang” on March 20. Hamish Hamilton, known for directing the majority of Super Bowl Halftime shows since 2010, is slated to direct the performance, which will be the first-ever live event broadcast from Korea to be livestreamed globally.\n\t\n\n\tThen, just a week later, the documentary “BTS: The Return” will debut on Netflix on March 27. The film, directed by Bao Nguyen (“The Greatest Night in Pop”), will chronicle the return of the group — consisting of RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, V, Jimin and Jung Kook — as they reunite in Los Angeles to make music following their hiatus. According to a press release, the film will portray them as they “create new music that reflects who they are now — culminating in what will become a landmark album of its time.”\n\n\n\t“Arirang” marks BTS’ first new album since 2022’s “Proof,” which was followed by the hiatus. The gap saw the individual members fulfilling mandatory military service in South Korea and recording a multitude of solo projects.\n\n\tJust last month, BTS announced its global tour for 2026 and 2027, with 79 performances slated for 34 markets. The tour will launch with three hometown concerts in Goyang, South Korea on April 9 and April 11-12, followed by extensive dates in Tokyo before heading over to North America.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNFL commissioner Roger Goodell reaffirmed his support for Super Bowl halftime performer Bad Bunny, telling reporters at a press conference on Monday that the Puerto Rican superstar proved he is “one of the great artists in the world” after his commanding presence at Sunday night’s Grammy Awards.\n\n\t“Listen, Bad Bunny is, and I think that was demonstrated last night, one of the great artists in the world. That’s one of the reasons we chose him,” Goodell said (via Yahoo Sports). “But the other reason is he understood the platform he was on, and that this platform is used to unite people and to be able to bring people together with their creativity, with their talent, and to be able to use this moment to do that. I think artists in the past have done that, I think Bad Bunny understands that, and I think he’ll have a great performance.”\n\t\n\n\tEver since Bad Bunny, an outspoken immigrants’ rights activist, was named the 2026 Super Bowl halftime performer, he has been the target of much conservative ridicule. After winning the Grammy for best música urbana album with “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS” on Sunday, he used his acceptance speech to uplift immigrant voices and condemn the actions of ICE.\n\n\n\t“Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ICE out,” he said. “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans. Also, I will say to people, I know it’s tough to know not to hate on these days and I was thinking sometimes, we get contaminados [contaminated], I don’t know how to say that in English. The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love.”\n\t\n\n\tBack in October of 2025, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said during an episode of Benny Johnson’s podcast that federal agents will be “all over” the Super Bowl with every intention to “enforce the law.” When asked about ICE presence at Sunday’s Super Bowl, Goodell said the NFL is working with “assets at the federal level, the state level and the local level” as standard practice dictates, but did not directly address whether ICE would be at the game.\n",

    "body": "\n\tReliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited has acquired a 50.1% stake in Sikhya Entertainment, the Indian production house behind Academy Award-winning documentaries “Period. End of Sentence.” and “The Elephant Whisperers.”\n\n\tThe deal unites Jio Studios, India’s largest film studio and the media arm of billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Limited, with the company co-founded by producers Guneet Monga Kapoor and Achin Jain. The partnership aims to develop films and series for loval and international audiences, combining Jio Studios’ distribution reach with Sikhya’s track record in globally resonant storytelling. Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited.\n\t\n\n\tSikhya Entertainment stands as the only Indian production house to have won both an Academy Award and multiple Indian National Film Awards. Beyond its Oscar victories for documentary shorts, the company’s Indian National Film Award-winning slate includes “Masaan,” “Soorarai Pottru” and “Kathal.” Its multilingual portfolio also features “The Lunchbox,” “Pagglait” and “Kill.”\n\n\n\tJio Studios has produced more than 150 films and series across Hindi and other Indian languages. The studio’s recent slate includes the “Stree” franchise and “Laapataa Ladies,” India’s official submission for the international feature Oscar.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ The studio’s “Dhurandhar,” starring Ranveer Singh, has become the highest-grossing Hindi-language film of all time in India.\n\t\n\n\t“Sikhya Entertainment has consistently delivered stories that are deeply Indian yet resonate globally. This association reflects our long-term belief in partnering with creators who combine creative excellence with cultural authenticity,” said Jyoti Deshpande, president of Jio Studios. “Over the last seven years, Jio Studios has built a strong track record of producing and championing some of the most successful box office winners and critically acclaimed films alike, from the most recent phenomenon ‘Dhurandhar’ to ‘Stree 2’ and ‘Laapataa Ladies’ which went all the way to the Oscars. I have known Guneet for a very long time and really admire her fire and tenacity. We are delighted to partner with Guneet, Achin and the Sikhya Entertainment team and by combining their distinctive storytelling legacy with Jio Studios’ scale, distribution, creative prowess and global ambition, we aim to give Indian stories the platform and pathways to reach audiences around the world.”\n\n\tMonga Kapoor and Jain said they have “always believed that stories have the power to connect people across cultures, geographies, and languages.” \n\n\t“At the heart of Sikhya’s work is a deep belief in storytelling and in the people who bring these stories to life,” they said in a joint statement. “Over the past decade, we have collaborated with bold new directors, writers, actors, and exceptional creative teams who continue to push the boundaries of independent cinema with honesty and ambition. For independent producers like us, driven by dreams and the audacity to turn those ideas into reality, this journey has been deeply rewarding.”\n\n\tThe producers said partnering with Jio Studios “allows us to take these stories to audiences around the world, while empowering us to champion emerging talent from across the country, where stories exist in every fabric and every thread.”\n\n\t“Jyoti Deshpande’s commitment to innovation and her instinct for bold ideas and creative risk make this partnership especially exciting,” they added. “Together, we celebrate a rising India, confident in its voice, unapologetic in its stories, and ready to shape the next chapter of cinema.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tHalle Berry recently sat down with The Cut for a profile ahead of the release of her new thriller “Crime 101” and revealed that she once advised Cynthia Erivo not to place any real weight on winning an Oscar. Erivo has been nominated twice for best actress (“Harriet” and “Wicked”), while Berry made history as the first Black woman to win the Oscar for best actress with her performance in “Monster’s Ball.” She remains the only Black winner in the category to this day.\n\t\n\n\t“That Oscar didn’t necessarily change the course of my career,” Berry told the publication. “After I won it, I thought there was going to be, like, a script truck showing up outside my front door. While I was wildly proud of it, I was still Black that next morning. Directors were still saying, ‘If we put a Black woman in this role, what does this mean for the whole story? Do I have to cast a Black man? Then it’s a Black movie. Black movies don’t sell overseas.’” \n\n\n\tAs Erivo’s acting career took off years later with its own Oscar nominations, Berry told her fellow performer: “You goddamn deserve it, but I don’t know that it’s going to change your life. It cannot be the validation for what you do, right?”\n\n\tBerry has often spoken out in disappointment over how her historic Oscar win lacked impact for both her own career and the industry at large. She told Marie Claire in 2024 that she’s “eternally miffed that no Black woman has come behind me for that best actress Oscar. I’m continually saddened by that year after year. And it’s certainly not because there has been nobody deserving.” In fact, Michelle Yeoh for “Everything Everywhere All at Once” is the only other woman of color to win the best actress Oscar.\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety in 2020, Berry cited Erivo in “Harriet” and Ruth Negga in “Loving” as Oscar-worthy performances by Black women. She later added Andra Day in “The United States vs. Billie Holiday” and Viola Davis in “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” to the list. \n\n\t“I thought there were women that rightfully, arguably, could have, should have. I hoped they would have, but why it hasn’t gone that way, I don’t have the answer,” Berry told Variety at the time, noting her win remained “one of my biggest heartbreaks” as it never opened up a door for more Black women at the Oscars.\n\n\t“The morning after, I thought, ‘Wow, I was chosen to open a door.’ And then, to have no one … I question, ‘Was that an important moment, or was it just an important moment for me?’” Berry said. “I wanted to believe it was so much bigger than me. It felt so much bigger than me, mainly because I knew others should have been there before me and they weren’t…just because I won an award doesn’t mean that, magically, the next day, there was a place for me. I was just continuing to forge a way out of no way.”\n\n\tHead over to The Cut’s website to read Berry’s latest profile in its entirety. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Kelly Clarkson Show” is coming to an end after its currently airing seventh season.\n\n\tThe show’s conclusion was Clarkson’s decision. In a statement thanking her crew and fans, she said, “Stepping away from the daily schedule will allow me to prioritize my kids, which feels necessary and right for this next chapter of our lives.”\n\n\tThe news comes after the 2025 death of Brandon Blackstock, who was her ex-husband and former manager as well as the father of her two children. Blackstock, who battled cancer for three years, was 48.\n\t\n\n\tProduction on Season 7 of “The Kelly Clarkson Show” will continue as previously planned, with the series airing its final episodes this fall. The season will also feature special guest hosts to be announced at a later date.\n\n\n\tClarkson’s full statement reads, “I have been extremely fortunate to work with such an outstanding group of people at ‘The Kelly Clarkson Show,’ both in Los Angeles and New York. There have been so many amazing moments and shows over these seven seasons. I am forever grateful and honored to have worked alongside the greatest band and crew you could hope for, all the talent and inspiring people who have shared their time and lives with us, all the fans who have supported our show and to NBC for always being such a supportive and incredible partner. Because of all of that, this was not an easy decision, but this season will be my last hosting ‘The Kelly Clarkson Show.’ Stepping away from the daily schedule will allow me to prioritize my kids, which feels necessary and right for this next chapter of our lives. This isn’t goodbye. I’ll still be making music, playing shows here and there and you may catch me on ‘The Voice’ from time to time … you never know where I might show up next. But for now, I want to thank y’all so much for allowing our show to be a part of your lives, and for believing in us and hanging with us for seven incredible years.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Kelly Clarkson Show” premiered in 2019. The series features Clarkson as she interviews celebrities as well as non-celebrities with inspiring stories. Each episode opens with a “Kellyoke” segment, in which Clarkson and her band perform covers of other artists’ songs. The show’s occasional “Songs & Stories” episodes see Clarkson do deep dives on the work of artists such as Alanis Morissette, Babyface, Miranda Lambert and Pink, with NBC later airing a primetime spinoff in which she interviewed the Jonas Brothers, Gloria Estefan, Teddy Swims and Lizzo.\n\n\tThroughout its run, “The Kelly Clarkson Show” has won 24 Daytime Emmys, including four consecutive wins for both outstanding daytime talk series and talk show host. \n\n\t“The Kelly Clarkson Show” is produced by Universal Television and distributed by NBCUniversal Syndication Studios, airing in over 200 markets nationwide. Alex Duda serves as showrunner and executive producer.\n\n\t“‘The Kelly Clarkson Show’ has been an extraordinary collaboration,” said Tracie Wilson, executive vice president of NBCUniversal Syndication Studios. “I’m grateful to Kelly for bringing her talent and energy to this. Her warmth, quick sense of humor and connection with people created a show that made fans feel seen, heard and a little bit better about their day. We couldn’t have achieved the show’s success without our exceptional showrunner/EP Alex Duda, whose vision, leadership and unwavering commitment across all seven seasons have guided us through unprecedented times and a cross-country move. Together with producers, staff and crew, they created a legacy to be proud of.”\n\n\t“‘The Kelly Clarkson Show’ has been a valued part of our NBC-owned stations’ lineup for seven seasons, always delivering an entertaining and engaging show for our daytime audiences,” said Valari Staab, chairman of NBCUniversal Local. “We thank Kelly and the production team for the wonderful, high-quality show they’ve produced consistently since 2019, and look forward to the remainder of this season as they complete their successful run.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tFox has given a straight to series order to the drama “The Interrogator” with Stephen Fry attached in a lead role. \n\n\tThe logline for the show states it is “centered on Conrad Henry (Fry), former MI6 agent, and his elite team. When conventional methods have failed, Henry’s quirky charm, superior intellect, and mind-bending behavioral maneuvers make him the only man able to lockpick the minds of the world’s most dangerous criminals.”\n\t\n\n\tFox has ordered 12 episodes of the show. Fry wrote the pilot, with revisions by Bill Harper and Matt Pyken. All three are executive producers along with Anonymous Content, Neil Burger and Paul McGuigan. McGuigan will also direct. Likely Story’s Anthony Bregman and Miriam Mintz also serve as executive producers. Lionsgate Television and Fox Entertainment Studios produce. \n\n\n\tFry previously appeared on the hit Fox procedural “Bones” in the role of Dr. Gordon Wyatt. A highly-acclaimed actor and comedian, Fry is known for his work in shows like “Blackadder” and “A Bit of Fry & Laurie,” as well as films like “Wilde,” “Gosford Park,” “V for Vendetta,” and “Love & Friendship.” \n\n\tHe is repped by CAA and Hamilton Hodell.  \n\n\tThis is the latest series pickup for Fox looking toward the 2026-2027 broadcast season. The network has also greenlit a reboot of “Baywatch,” which has had a long road to the screen but was formally ordered back in September. \n\n\tFox has few scripted dramas on its slate at present. The network’s current drama lineup consists only of medical drama “Doc,” the well-received “Doc Martin” adaptation “Best Medicine” starring Josh Charles, and the recently-launched “Memory of a Killer” starring Patrick Dempsey. \n",

Police have not identified a suspect.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          Police declined to say whether blood was found inside the home, if the home was in disarray from a struggle or if there was forced entry. But, the sheriff's department said they're talking with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has a long history of working with kidnapping and missing persons cases.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          The sheriff's spokesperson tells us ... Customs and Border Protection are also involved in the case ... the agency's specially trained K-9 dogs were used to help search for Guthrie, who is 84, lives alone and suffers from poor health. Police say she needs to take her daily medications to survive so time is of the essence to find her.\n      \n    \n          As we reported ... 84-year-old Nancy was reported missing Sunday afternoon, and was last seen Saturday night at her Tucson house. Authorities previously announced homicide detectives were investigating the case.\n      \n    \n          In a statement Sunday, Savannah said ... \"On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers and messages of support.

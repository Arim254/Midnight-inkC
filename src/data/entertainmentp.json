    "body": "\n\tYou’ve probably seen a variation of this news on social media over the past few days: MTV officially shut down on New Year’s Eve, ending their final broadcast the same way the network started: With the clip “Video Killed the Radio Star” by The Buggles. \n\n\tBut those posts are misinformed. It’s New Year’s Day 2026, and MTV is still around. Granted, today the channel is playing a marathon of “The Big Bang Theory” sitcom repeats, so your interpretation of “MTV is still around” may vary. \n\t\n\n\tHere’s where the confusion is coming from: On New Year’s Eve, Paramount Skydance did indeed shut down several MTV-branded music channels in the U.K. According to a source, “MTV’s specialist music channels in the UK will no longer operate as linear channels. The flagship MTV UK channel will continue to broadcast… Paramount is reviewing and adjusting its international Pay TV portfolio, given shifts in audience behavior towards streaming and digital platforms.”\n\n\n\tAs for the U.S., the existing MTV channels will continue to broadcast without change — including MTV and MTV2. MTV hasn’t been “Music Television” for a long time, but the network does still program some digital music channels in the U.S., including “MTV Classic” (playing retro music videos from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s), “MTV Live” (which runs current music videos, as well as other music programming from the Paramount library) and a collection of MTV-branded FAST channels (“MTV Biggest Pop,” “MTV Spankin’ New,” “Yo! MTV” and “MTV Flow Latino”), which play contemporary music videos on Pluto TV. \n\n\tOf course, fans of MTV’s golden 1980s, 1990s and 2000s era still look nostalgically at when the flagship network really was about music. In those days, MTV’s programming consisted of music videos and music-oriented series like “Headbanger’s Ball,” “120 Minutes” and “Yo! MTV Raps.” Later, “TRL” was an afternoon staple for an entire generation of kids. \n\t\n\n\tBut in recent years, MTV has focused on reality programming — which currently includes “The Challenge” and “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” The network has also been criticized for its over-reliance on series like “Ridiculousness,” which often takes up the lion’s share of its programming. (As Variety wrote in 2020, at one point “Ridiculousness” took up 113 of 168 total hours on MTV — 67.3% of its entire schedule.)\n\n\tAnd that’s probably why, while inaccurate, this “news” that MTV is shutting down has resonated across social media — especially among Gen Xers and Millennials. They still remember that music on MTV came more than just once a year on the VMAs. And they’ve also seen the recent reports of how cutbacks have eliminated the last vestiges of MTV as we know it: In 2023, the remaining shell of a once-vibrant MTV News division was shut down, and then last year the legacy MTV News website went dark, and its archives were scrubbed from the internet. \n\n\tThen there was the sense in 2025 that we’ve hit the tipping point when it comes to the decline in basic cable, as companies like NBCU look to shed those once-valuable assets. When Skydance acquired Paramount and started making drastic cuts, its cable networks were hit especially hard: MTV shed most of its remaining comms and talent teams, including top remaining music programming and talent execs. The idea that even a major network like MTV might shut down no longer seems so far-fetched.\n\n\tAccording to Variety‘s 2025 tally of the most-watched linear networks in primetime, MTV rated No. 49 — with an average of 189,000 viewers. In adults 18-49, MTV ranked No. 25. Compare that to 10 years ago: In 2015, MTV ranked No. 36 with 606,000 viewers.\n\n\tSo yes, the MTV as we knew it disappeared a long time ago. But MTV as a channel still exists. For now.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tA new documentary from CNN offers an unvarnished look at one of the most polarizing figures in comedy: Chevy Chase. “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” premieres on CNN on Thursday, Jan. 1.\n\n\tCable-cutters can stream the documentary online through a variety of Live TV streamers with access to CNN, such as DirecTV, Sling TV and Hulu + Live TV. DirecTV offers a free trial that you can use to stream the new Chevy Chase doc online for free.\n\n\n\tDirected by Marina Zenovich, the CNN Films project arrives amid renewed scrutiny of Chase’s career and conduct, including his fraught exits “from Saturday Night Live” and “Community,” as well as personal health-related revelations, including that he was put into a coma for eight days during the pandemic after experiencing heart failure. The film — which traces Chase’s rise as a foundational figure of modern TV —  includes interviews with dozens of the 82 year-old comedian’s personal and professional connections such as his daughter Caley Chase and “Community” creator Jay Chandrasekhar, who reveals in the doc that he was on set the night that Chase got fired. \n\n\tThe documentary is highly anticipated not only because of its long-awaited Hollywood revelations but also because Chase’s infamous attitude made the idea of him collaborating with a director — and letting go of all editorial control — feel like an impossibility. Until Zenovich came along. \n\n\t“I’d never done an interview where someone was so rude to me,” Zenovich told Variety last month. “But I was so worried going into that first interview with him about how I was going to say to him, like, ‘Everyone thinks you’re an asshole.’ I thought if I did, he would throw me out of his house. So the minute he said that to me, I had a way in.”\n\n\n\t“I wanted to figure out who was the real person behind the conflicted, guarded and somewhat fragile man we see on camera,” she continued. “What was behind the surface of his slightly intimidating superstar bravado? Was there any self-awareness there? Having interviewed Chevy at length, I have to say that yes, it’s all there – and a whole lot of pain and heartache too.”\n\n\tThe documentary premieres tonight on CNN at 8 p.m. ET/PT, making it accessible to both traditional cable subscribers and cord-cutters alike. Viewers can watch the film live through major TV streaming services that carry CNN, including DirecTV, Sling TV and Hulu + Live TV, both of which include the channel in their standard lineups and allow subscribers to tune in across smart TVs, mobile devices and web browsers. For those unable to catch the premiere in real time, both services also offer cloud DVR options.\n\n\tStream “I’m Chevy Chase and You Are Not” online here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tGeorge Clooney suggested the midterm elections could put the country on the right track in a response to President Trump’s snarky social media posts about the actor’s recent decision to get French citizenship.\n\n\tOn New Year’s Eve, the president hailed Clooney’s move as “Good News!” and made a stream-of-consciousness reference to the movie star’s 2024 op-ed urging former President Biden to drop out of the race.\n\n\n\t“Remember when Clooney, after the now infamous debate, dumped Joe during a fundraiser, only to go onto the side of another stellar candidate, Jamala(K!), who is now fighting it out with the worst governor in the Country, including Tim Waltz [sic], Gavin Newscum, for who is going to lead the Democrats to their future defeat,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies. He wasn’t a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\t\n\n\tIn response, Clooney, who has been one of Hollywood’s most outspoken critics of Trump, used the president’s own mantra. “I totally agree with the current president,” he said. “We have to make America great again. We’ll start in November.”\n\n\tClooney seems to be suggesting that he believes the Democrats could retake the House and possibly the Senate in the next election. The actor, his wife Amal Clooney and their two children have all received French citizenship. Clooney has praised French privacy laws, saying they provide more protections from paparazzi looking to snap photos of his kids. \n\t\n\n\tIn a recent cover story with Variety, Clooney also addressed his former friendship with President Trump.\n\n\t“I knew him very well,” Clooney says. “He used to call me a lot, and he tried to help me get into a hospital once to see a back surgeon. I’d see him out at clubs and at restaurants. He’s a big goofball. Well, he was. That all changed.”\n\n\tClooney also argued that news networks like ABC and CBS should have fought back instead of settling lawsuits that the president filed against them.\n\n\t“If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go fuck yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,” Clooney said. “That’s simply the truth.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWill Smith has been sued by a tour violinist who is accusing the rapper of sexual harassment, wrongful termination and retaliation.\n\n\tIn the suit, filed yesterday and reviewed by Variety, musician Brian King Joseph names Smith and Treyball Studios Management as defendants and accuses Smith of “predatory behavior” and “deliberately grooming and priming Mr. Joseph for further sexual exploitation” while on his “Based on a True Story: 2025 Tour” this past spring.\n\t\n\n\tThe suit alleges that Smith hired Joseph in November 2024 to perform at a show in San Diego and was subsequently invited to join his 2025 tour and play on his upcoming album. As their relationship grew closer, Smith told Joseph that “you and I have such a special connection, that I don’t have with anyone else,” among other similar expressions.\n\n\n\tJoseph, who previously competed on “America’s Got Talent,” joined the first leg of Smith’s tour in March 2025 for a show in Las Vegas, where hotel rooms had been booked for the band and crew members. His suit claims that his bag, which contained his hotel room key, went missing for several hours before management found and returned it to him, and that members of management were the “only individuals with access to [his] room.”\n\n\tLater that night, Joseph returned to find that someone had “unlawfully” entered the room and left behind belongings including wipes, a bottle of HIV medication with another individual’s name, and a note that read, “Brian, I’ll be back no later [sic] 5:30, just us (drawn heart), Stone F,” which Joseph interpreted as a warning that “an unknown individual would soon return to his room to engage in sexual acts” with him.\n\t\n\n\tHe notified hotel security and Smith’s representatives and reported the incident to a non-emergency police line. He claims that just days later, a member of the management team “shamed” him for the incident and told him he was being terminated, suggesting that Joseph made the whole thing up.\n\n\tA representative for Smith did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.\n\n\tThe suit claims that due to the termination, Joseph suffered from PTSD and economic loss. He is suing for retaliation, wrongful termination and sexual harassment, and that damages be determined by a jury.\n",

    "description": "\n\tA brief chapter in Chevy Chase‘s illustrious comedy career is his ill-fated late-night talk series “The Chevy Chase Show,” which ran on Fox for six ",
    "body": "\n\tA brief chapter in Chevy Chase‘s illustrious comedy career is his ill-fated late-night talk series “The Chevy Chase Show,” which ran on Fox for six weeks in 1993 and was cancelled after scathing reviews and low ratings.\n\n\tIn the new CNN documentary “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not,” Chase opens up about his experience hosting a talk show — and the disappointment that followed. “I never took anybody’s advice about how to do a talk show. I can do it, I kept thinking,” he said in the doc. “It was hideous. I just didn’t really have a sense of what you do on a talk show.”\n\t\n\n\tChase’s representatives and collaborators explained in the documentary that the show, which debuted Sept. 7, 1993, failed because it had “old-time” TV producers and needed a new vision. Plus, while Chase was a gifted comedic actor and movie star, he was less skilled in stand-up comedy.\n\n\n\tChase’s eldest daughter, Cydney, remembered visiting her dad on set of the talk show. “He felt nervous to me,” she said.\n\n\tAndy Aaron, a writer on “The Chevy Chase Show,” recounted, “The reviews were universally terrible, and Chevy literally would come into the writers room and say, ‘You guys are doing a great job. It is not your fault, it is my fault.'”\n\n\t“I don’t know how people like Letterman and others do it,” Chase said. “It’s beyond me. You can say, ‘Well, it’s interesting to have different people…’ Yeah right. We’re all the same, pretty much. It’s not that interesting.”\n\n\tThe staff found out the show had been pulled by Fox at the end of Chevy’s 50th birthday party. CAA leader Michael Ovitz, Chase’s agent at the time, asked him if he wanted to go a couple more weeks. “‘Couple of weeks?‘” Chase recalled in mock surprise. “I think we’re finished.”\n\t\n\n\tChase’s daughters talked about Chase’s mental health struggles after the series’ cancellation. “It was kind of a weird environment after his talk show,” said Cydney Chase. “I know my dad has been depressed. I knew that at a young age. That was sort of hard for me because I would go in and, like, tug on his shirt and he’d say, ‘Not now, honey.'”\n\n\tChase’s daughter Caley added, “One thing that was interesting about our household is that my parents were pretty open with some of the things going on that were deeper, depending on our ages. My parents were communicating enough to say, ‘There’s something called depression, and it is hard for people to get out of bed.'”\n\n\t“He would get in bed and not come out,” added Chase’s wife, Jayni. “I didn’t understand why.”\n\n\tChase would go on to star in a handful of films after the talk show ended, and eventually he would have a career resurgence playing Pierce Hawthorne on the sitcom “Community,” which ran from 2009 to 2014 on NBC.\n\n\tIn 1993, “The Chevy Chase Show” arrived in a moment of frenzy around late-night television. Johnny Carson’s retirement from “The Tonight Show” one year earlier opened up opportunities, and Arsenio Hall was already hosting a successful, syndicated late-night yakker, “Arsenio,” which was an immediate draw with younger, multicultural viewers in big cities. Distributed by Paramount, “Arsenio” was the first competitor to go up against Carson that stuck around and made a dent in his audience.\n\n\tThe Fox network saw “Arsenio’s” success and decided to take a swing with a late-night show. It marked Fox’s second attempt to establish a foothold in late-night. In October 1986, Fox Broadcasting Co. was born when it tapped Joan Rivers to host “The Late Show” in the hopes of taking on Carson with one of his longtime guest hosts. But Rivers’ show had a rocky run and was axed by May 1987. It was replaced briefly by the offbeat, proto-“Daily Show” newsmagazine-style “The Wilton North Report.” That show lasted about three months. After that, Fox was out of late-night, turning its focus to primetime and finding traction with hits like “Married With Children” and “21 Jump Street.”\n\n\tFive years later, Carson’s retirement set off the Leno vs. Letterman battle that ended in Leno taking “The Tonight Show” throne and Letterman moving on to launch a new franchise on CBS. Letterman’s “The Late Show” launched on CBS with great fanfare on Aug. 30, 1993, after Letterman famously had to wait out the rest of his contract as host of NBC’s post-“Tonight Show” hour, “Late Night With David Letterman.” (The open slot at “Late Night” eventually went to Conan O’Brien, who was famously renewed in six-week increments in his first few months.)\n\t\n\n\tSo into this mix came Chase to do battle against Leno and Letterman, who were both revved up to prove themselves as the top-dog in the time slot. The whole fracas was quickly dubbed “the late-night wars” in media and pop culture.\n\n\tEven though it was short-lived, the arrival of Chase’s show as a Fox network offering spelled the end for Hall’s show in syndication. That’s because a number of the stations that carried Hall’s show in major markets were Fox affiliates. When the Fox network decided to go for “Chevy Chase,” those affiliate stations were under pressure to drop Hall’s show to make way for the network offering. Most of them did. Despite Chase’s quick hook, the damage was done. “Arsenio” aired its final episode on May 27, 1994.\n\n\t“I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” premiered on CNN on Jan. 1.\n\n\tHere’s the first episode of “The Chevy Chase Show,” via YouTube\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” continued to draw crowds on New Year’s Eve, topping the box office with $8.1 million. The film has become another holiday juggernaut for James Cameron and Disney, which acquired the rights to all things Pandora when it bought Fox in 2019. It has earned just over $250 million during its first two weeks in theaters and has been an even stronger performer overseas. It should cross $1 billion globally in the coming days. \n\t\n\n\tBut the movie business didn’t have as much to celebrate as it hoped to as the year came to a close. Cinemas in the U.S. and Canada sold an estimated $8.87 billion in tickets in 2025, representing a modest 1.5% increase on 2024’s domestic revenues. That’s also short of the $9 billion that many analysts expected the industry to generate. Prior to the pandemic, ticket sales were on an upward trajectory, routinely nearing or topping $11 million, but attendance has yet to return to the same levels even as the cost of going to the movies has increased. The popularity of premium formats like Imax, which have higher ticket prices, has bolstered grosses even as fewer consumers have opted to hit up the multiplex. \n\n\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” continued to be a force, earning $4.6 million to bring its domestic total to $337.9 million to take second place. “Marty Supreme” continued to be one of the few indie films to break out at the box office, earning $2.4 million on Wednesday to nab third place. That brings the domestic total for the A24 drama about a ping pong hustler (Timothée Chalamet) to roughly $39 million. The film, which has been acclaimed by critics, was costly. It has a budget of $70 million and the studio spent tens of millions more to market the picture. \n\t\n\n\tIn fourth place, Angel Studios’ “David” picked up $2.4 million, pushing its Stateside results to $58.5 million, while Sony’s horror-comedy “Anaconda” rounded out the top five, earning $2.2 million to bring its domestic total to $31.7 million.\n\n\tElsewhere, Lionsgate’s “The Housemaid,” a campy thriller with Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, earned $2.1 million, leaving it with a domestic haul of $56.2 million. And Focus Features’ “Song Sung Blue,” featuring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson as Neil Diamond interpreters, also earned $2.1 million, bringing its grosses to $16.9 million. \n\n\tTheaters are also leaning into alternative content over the holidays, with many screening Netflix’s “Stranger Things” finale. The show’s creators, the Duffer Brothers, announced that 1.1 million seats had been sold in over 620 locations, but Netflix did not announce grosses. \n\n\tThe New Year’s Eve box office tends to be sleepy, as many consumers prefer to eat, drink and be merry. Look for ticket sales to rebound on Thursday as sleep-deprived audiences look for something to do while shaking off a champagne fog. \n",

    "body": "\n\tChina‘s theatrical market staged a robust recovery in 2025, with total box office reaching RMB51.83 billion ($7.41 billion) and admissions climbing to 1.24 billion – both representing year-over-year increases exceeding 20%, according to a new report from Maoyan Entertainment’s research division.\n\n\tIn 2024, the China box office plummeted 23% to $5.8 billion. The 2025 rebound was fueled primarily by animated titles and IP-driven franchises, with 57 animated films generating over RMB25 billion ($3.57 billion) in revenue – representing nearly half of the year’s total gross. Leading the charge were local sequel “Ne Zha 2” ($2.13 billion) and Disney’s “Zootopia 2” ($558.3 million), which delivered exceptional box office performance.\n\t\n\n\tThe Maoyan Research Institute’s “Insight Report on 2025 China’s Box Office Film Data,” highlighted animation’s outsized impact on the market’s growth trajectory.\n\n\n\tIP strength proved particularly potent in the animation sector, with select franchises recording significantly higher rewatch rates than market averages. “Ne Zha 2” achieved the year’s highest rewatch ratio, while “Zootopia 2” and other popular titles demonstrated sustained fan engagement and loyalty.\n\n\tThe report revealed increasing market concentration around tentpole releases. Among 2025’s top 10 new films, four surpassed RMB3 billion ($429 million) at the box office and eight crossed the RMB1 billion ($143 million) threshold. Local productions captured a slightly larger market share compared to 2024, though the number of local films grossing over RMB1 billion remained steady year-over-year.\n\t\n\n\tHowever, mid-tier local releases faced challenges, with films earning between RMB100-500 million ($14.3 million-$71.5 million) and RMB500 million-1 billion ($71.5 million-$143 million) showing marked declines, underscoring the market’s growing polarization toward blockbuster projects.\n\n\tLower-tier cities emerged as crucial growth engines, with third- and fourth-tier markets’ box office contributions reaching a five-year high in 2025, marking three consecutive years of expansion. The proportion of first-time and infrequent moviegoers also increased, broadening cinema’s audience reach.\n\n\tLocal productions shifted away from sweeping narratives toward stories reflecting everyday life, employing diverse visual styles and genres to meet varied audience preferences. Meanwhile, imported superhero franchises experienced notable declines, suggesting these properties require fresh creative approaches to maintain market appeal.\n\n\t“In 2025, several key holiday release windows outperformed expectations thanks to the support of breakout hits, setting multiple new records and delivering pleasant surprises to both the industry and audiences,” said Maoyan Entertainment market analyst Lai Li. “The traditional ‘blockbuster model,’ in its classic sense, is no longer a guaranteed formula for box office success, offering new lessons for market participants.”\n\n\tLooking toward 2026, Lai emphasized the industry must continue refining its content pipeline, attracting diverse audience segments with high-quality films combining popularity, strong word-of-mouth, and freshness to unlock further growth potential.\n",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\tJan 1, 2026 5:00am PT\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tWatching the ‘Stranger Things’ Finale in a Theater: 11 Moments That Got the Biggest Reactions\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Netflix\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for the series finale of “Stranger Things,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tAfter five seasons and nearly a decade of anticipation, the “Stranger Things” finale has arrived. Unlike the 41 episodes preceding it, the finale was not exclusive to the small screen, as Netflix decided to event-ize the pop culture phenomenon’s send off with a limited theatrical release on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 across 500 theaters.\n\n\tThe earliest screenings took place at 5 p.m. PT, coinciding with the moment that the episode dropped on the streamer. While there was no formal red carpet premiere, the most sensational screening may have been at Netflix’s very own Egyptian Theater in the heart of Hollywood. Audiences donning Hellfire Club t-shirts, WSQK shirts, bowl cuts and other 1980s apparel from the show packed the historic theater, eager to experience their favorite show on the big screen for the first time.\n\n\tThe audience was a sea of nerds. Considering that “Stranger Things” began in 2016, the youngest fans in the crowd very well may not have been born when the show first debuted. Similarly, the adolescents in the theater were probably in kindergarten when the first season came out. Personally, I was in college in 2016, and have been watching the show for most of my twenties. To see the finale in theaters, surrounded by fans on the day of its premiere was thus akin to seeing “Avengers: Endgame” or “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” in the cinema on their respective opening weekends. It was the conclusion to a decade-long journey of fandom, and it made for moments that simply couldn’t be replicated in a watch party.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFans at the “Stranger Things 5: The Finale Fan Screenings” at The Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood on New Year’s Eve. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrom cheering on the Netflix logo at the top of the episode to singing along with David Bowie in the closing credits, these are the 11 moments from the “Stranger Things” finale that received the biggest reactions in the theater.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t11. Hopper Goes Back For Kali\n\t\t\t\t\n\tHopper (David Harbour) and Kali (Linnea Berthelsen) have been at odds with one another for the entirety of Season 5, arguing over their respective approaches to how Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) should use her powers. When both Kali and Eleven are paralyzed during a tense chase from the military, Hopper at first just rescues Eleven, but when he goes back for Kali, it affirms his heroism, warranting strong applause from the audience. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t10. Eleven Pulls Lt. Akers’ Trigger\n\t\t\t\t\n\tShortly after Hopper rescues Kali, both are captured and held hostage by the season’s side-antagonist Lt. Robert Akers (Alex Breaux). Akers has proven a nasty force throughout the season, so when Eleven liberates them by forcing Akers to turn his gun on himself, it received a cathartic response. Credit is also due to Murray (Brett Gelman) for disrupting the situation by blowing up the helicopter outside, adding to the climactic sequence.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t9. Hopper Proposes To Joyce\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Andrew McGowan\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tBecause the “Stranger Things” finale wraps up the stories of its enormous ensemble, it suffers from a bit of “Return of the King” syndrome (i.e. it seems to have several final farewell scenes taking place in sequence). Luckily, all of the farewells are heartfelt, but the one that got the biggest reaction was Hopper and Joyce’s (Winona Ryder) final scene together. After the kids all graduate from high school, Hopper takes Joyce out to a fancy restaurant and floats the idea of them leaving Hawkins for Montauk (a nod to the show’s original proposed setting). However, the reaction came not from this subtle Easter Egg, but from the moment that Hopper gets down on one knee, presents Joyce with a ring and asks her to spend the rest of her life with him.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t8. Eleven Releases Hopper\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAudiences weren’t cheering during this scene, but sniffles were audible in the theater. Hopper has long been protective of Eleven, and his refusal to let her sacrifice herself for the world stems from the pain he felt at the loss of his daughter, Sara. In this emotional scene, Eleven tenderly explains that even though Hopper has proven a loving father figure to her, she isn’t Sara. She then returns to him a hair tie that once belonged to Sara, relieving him of his guilt. There was hardly a dry eye in the house.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t7. Eleven Says Goodbye To Mike\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIf Eleven’s emotional moment with Hopper made for some dewy eyes and sniffles, her final scene with Mike created audible sobs. When Eleven makes the decision to stay in the Upside Down when the bomb goes off, Mike (Finn Wolfhard) rushes in to try and save her, but she takes him into her mind and explains what must be done. All the while, they share tearful embraces over Prince’s “Purple Rain.” It’s beautiful and tragic all at once, and the audience was breaking down with the characters.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t6. Joyce Decapitates Vecna\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThere are several cathartic moments in the ensemble’s defeat of Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower), but Joyce delivers the final blow to the archvillain, decapitating him with an ax after he’s impaled against a spike in the heart of the Mind Flayer. Before she starts hacking away at his neck, she says, with fire in her eyes, “You fucked with the wrong family.” It was the finale’s “I am Iron Man” moment, and the audience absolutely ate it up.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t5. Eleven Reenters the Abyss\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWhen Vecna gives into the Mind Flayer and it starts attacking the heroes in the Abyss, there are several moments of heroism. The audience clapped when Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) saves Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) from getting smushed and then again when Nancy (Natalia Dyer) volunteers herself as bait. However, the largest applause came when its revealed that Eleven has successfully reentered Abyss via her shortcut and distracts the Flayer with a boulder to the head. She then charges towards it head on, rips a hole in its chest and dives in like a superhero, receiving a superheroic ovation.  \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t4. Derek Saves Holly\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJake Connelly’s Derek Turnbow is one of the best additions to “Stranger Things 5” and perhaps the funniest character in the entire series. It’s therefore no surprise that he solicited some of the biggest laughs in the theater— from his unexpected hug with Steve (Joe Keery) to his awkward wave to Mike. However, his most shining moment in the finale comes when he helps Holly (Nell Fisher) escape Vecna’s clutches while entering the Cave. He saves her by pulling her in and once they’re both safe, flips off Vecna and utters his signature line: “Suck my fat one.” Dipshit Derek certainly Delighted the crowd with that one.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t3. Hopper Shoots Eleven\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAudiences audibly gasped in this scene, where Hopper, tricked by Vecna, fires his gun at an apparition only for the bullets to go right into the water tank where Eleven is submerged. When he pulls back the metal to reveal the blood pouring from Eleven’s body, the theater’s shock was audible. One person behind me even blurted, “Shut the fuck up!” in surprise. Fortunately, Eleven’s wounds ended up being as fabricated as the apparition itself, but Hopper’s panicked decision to free her from the tank veered the plot in an unexpected direction. Also, when Vecna plays with Hopper’s mind, it’s the first time that his villainous voice is heard in the finale. Its vibrations rumbled the theater, sounding superbly spooky over the Egyptian’s cinematic sound system.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t2. Jonathan Saves Steve\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe entire scene where Eleven is trying to align the falling Abyss with the radio tower in the Upside Down was thrilling to watch on the big screen. With the seconds counting down and characters facing odds across three different realms, everyone was on the edge of their seats. However, the audience cried and screamed when the screen cut to black as it appears that Steve will fall to his death. Those cries of despair turned into cheers of triumph when it’s revealed that Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) — a rival of Steve’s throughout the series — saves him. It’s an early moment in the episode that tests the audience’s fears for all of the characters’ fates. Fortunately, this one ended with catharsis. Also, as a bonus, Joe Keery’s name received the loudest applause during the closing credits.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t1. Will Becomes Vecna to Save Eleven\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIf Joyce telling Vecna that he “fucked with the wrong family” was the finale’s “I am Iron Man” moment, then Will (Noah Schnapp) embodying Vecna to save Eleven and make way for his defeat was Captain America wielding Mjölnir. Just when Vecna appears to have the upper hand in the final battle against Eleven, Will taking control gives the heroes the upper hand for the final time. It is the satisfying moment that affirms the villain’s fate and everything the heroes are capable of.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNew ‘Wicked: For Good’ Performances Arrive on Roku City Platform – Here’s How to Watch\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBeyoncé Is Officially a Billionaire\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAlabama, Indiana Bring Stark Contrasts to CFP Clash\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZohran Mamdani Gets a Warm Welcome From Thousands in New York City\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Johannes Roberts’ film doesn’t take itself too seriously, and the titular antagonist is a performance from an actor versus CGI, which gives it some serious gravitas for a killer animal flick.\n\n\t“28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” (In theaters Jan. 16 via Sony Pictures Releasing) — Just months after the release of the stylish hit “28 Years Later,” Nia DaCosta helms this direct sequel which focuses on Ralph Fiennes’ Dr. Ian Kelson and Jack O’Connell’s wild Sir Lord Jimmy Crystal, who was introduced as a bonkers cult leader at the end of the last film. Early reactions have also been strong for this installment.\n\n\t“Send Help” (In theaters Jan. 30 via 20th Century Studios) — Sam Raimi’s newest thriller pairs Rachel McAdams and Dylan O’Brien as feuding co-workers who are the sole survivors of a plane crash and must survive together on a deserted island. Previews of the film, penned by “Freddy vs. Jason” duo Mark Swift and Damian Shannon, look to be filled with twists and dark humor.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOff the Beaten Path\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Shudder\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“We Bury the Dead” (In theaters Jan. 2 via Vertical) — Zak Hilditch’s nuanced take on a zombie movie is carried by star Daisy Ridley, a woman desperately trying to find her husband as the dead rise. Great production design and a chilling soundscape amp up the tension.\n\n\t“Self-Help” (Debuts on Screambox on Jan. 6) — A young woman tries to rescue her mother from a wellness cult and its creepy guru in “Founders Day” director Erik Bloomquist’s newest feature. \n\n\t“Sleepwalker” (In theaters Jan. 9 via Brainstorm Media) — Hayden Panettiere stars as a grieving mother haunted by visions of her abusive husband, who was put in a coma by the same accident that killed her daughter. Brandon Auman wrote and directed this psychological thriller, which plays effectively with scares shrouded in darkness.\n\n\t“Night Patrol” (In theaters Jan. 16 via RLJE Films) — Ryan Prows’ vampire cop thriller is a genre mashup that brings bloodsuckers to the streets of L.A. With a unique cast led by Jermaine Fowler and Justin Long, and featuring a blend of rappers and character actors in supporting roles, “Night Patrol” also makes room to touch on some real-life social issues.\n\n\t“Savage Flowers” (Debuts on Screambox on Jan. 20) — Brad Watson directed this apocalyptic tale of children who are carriers of a global virus, and a young girl who ends up at a makeshift orphanage and must survive the sinister girls around her.\n\n\t“Return to Silent Hill” (In theaters Jan. 23 via Cineverse) — The first new “Silent Hill” movie since 2012 is an adaptation of the video game franchise favorite “Silent Hill 2,” and early footage looks devoted to the vibe of the game.

    "description": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the series finale of “Stranger Things,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tAnd so ends the nine-and-a-hal",
    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the series finale of “Stranger Things,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tAnd so ends the nine-and-a-half-year journey of “Stranger Things,” which launched in July 2016 and concluded on Dec. 31, 2025. Creators Matt and Ross Duffer wrapped up the series in a finale that ran just over two hours, and not only premiered on Netflix, but played in select theaters as well. In a media landscape that’s splintered into a million pieces, the conclusion of “Stranger Things” — with its finale dropping precisely at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on New Year’s Eve — felt like a throwback to an earlier time, and a last gasp of monoculture.\n\n\t“The Rightside Up” wrapped up the stories of all the major characters, after Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), Will (Noah Schnapp), Nancy (Natalia Dyer), Joyce (Winona Ryder) and the rest of the Hawkins heroes went into the Abyss to defeat the Mind Flayer and kill Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) for once and for all. In Variety’s Oct. 15 cover story about “Stranger Things,” Matt Duffer said explicitly, “This is a complete story. It’s done.”\n\n\tWhich doesn’t mean that every single plot thread was tied up in a neat bow, as TikTok will undoubtedly be telling us for the next few months (and possibly forever). The biggest lingering question that “The Rightside Up” leaves ambiguous is whether Eleven is dead (did she sacrifice herself when the Upside Down was destroyed to thwart the military from weaponizing future clones of her?) or alive (was that last image just a projection of her, as aided by Linnea Berthelsen’s Kali, and Eleven managed to escape?). Viewers will surely reach their own conclusions, but in the spirit of “Stranger Things” and its inspirations, Eleven may very well be alive.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMike (Finn Wolfhard) certainly seems to think so. The show’s final scene — after an 18-month time jump to the class of ‘89’s graduation — is set in the Wheelers’ basement as the gang plays Dungeons & Dragons one last time, in a throwback to the series premiere. It’s then that Mike tells Will, Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), Max (Sadie Sink) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) how he sees their stories moving forward, as they each embark on their futures — and it’s where he tells them that he thinks Eleven might be alive after all. As his sister Holly (Nell Fisher), her friend Derek (Jake Connelly) and their other friends come barreling down the stairs, ready to take over the D&D game, Mike closes the door. (For Variety’s full recap of the “Stranger Things” finale, read this.)\n\n\tIn an interview with the Duffer brothers on the morning of Jan. 1, they delve into the uncertainty of Eleven’s fate; staging the final battle with the Mind Flayer and Vecna, and debating who got to deal the death blow; the element unveiled in the finale that will be key to the spinoff — and being unpleasantly surprised by the review bombing of “The Bridge,” the series’ penulimate episode. The New Year’s Day conversation is interrupted only by Brown repeatedly trying to call Matt Duffer, which disrupts the Zoom.\n\n\tSee, everybody? She’s alive!\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve been clear that you’ve known for a long time that the final scene was that D&D campaign with the kids, who are now young adults. But how much of that scene did you know far in advance? Like, did you know Eleven wouldn’t be there, that Max would be there — break it down for me, please!\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Initially, when we came up with it a very long time ago, it was the kids — the “kids,” in quotes — play one final game of D&D, put their books away and go upstairs. And Mike was going to shut the door, closing the door effectively on childhood. So that was the idea. Once we introduced Holly, and this is one of the reasons we were so interested in bringing Holly and her friends and Derek into the show, was to be able to have a passing of the torch moment. To be able to recapture Season 1, it allows Mike to reflect on his childhood and feel happy that his sister and her friends are going to have a magical experience, or adventures like they had — hopefully not as traumatic. But as Dustin said, there was so much good amongst so much bad. It changed them in so many meaningful ways. \n\n\tRoss Duffer: Eleven was never going to be there. It was very early on in the writing process of this season that we figured out exactly how to tell that story and landed on the “I believe” moment. And once we landed on “I believe,” then that sort of cracked it wide open. That was in those first few weeks of the writers’ room, because we started at the end, at that basement scene, and wanted to make sure that we got it to a place where we felt was the right ending for the show. And then we built the season to that moment.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I also love the idea that the original ending of “ET” was them going to be them playing D&D again. So I like the idea of doing that.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of the Eleven ending, and the ambiguity of whether she’s alive, can you talk about when you had that idea and why you wanted to do that?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: A couple things: Eleven represents, in a lot of ways, the magic of childhood. And we knew for our kids to be able to grow up, the magic had leave Hawkins. There was never a version that we had written where it was Eleven down in that basement. It was never going to be that simple and that easy. It was finding a way to come up with an ending where it was not that simple, but also bittersweet, and that there was hope there.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Speaking of Eleven, Millie keeps Facetiming, disrupting the Zoom.\n\n\n\tRight now?\n\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Yeah. And Millie, if you don’t answer, just keeps hitting you up.It’s two fronts. Ross is talking about it thematically, in terms of the magic of childhood. And then there’s this story element of it in Eleven’s choice, ultimately. It was a huge debate — she’s calling again, I’m so sorry, Kate. I’m curious, actually, what she’s saying. Everybody’s very emotional.She’s like, “I’m alive, guys!” \n\n\tMatt Duffer: “I’m alive, guys,” yeah — no, she’s very emotional. Everybody’s very emotional. And no one’s here in L.A., so we haven’t gotten to see anyone after it played. I’m so sorry.\n\t\n\n\tI know what I was gonna say: From a character point of view, not a thematic point of view, we had so many debates in the writers’ room about what we were going to do with Eleven. And then we tried to actually express everything we were talking about in the room on the screen. So Hopper’s speech to Eleven is vocalizing what a lot of people in the room were saying. And then what Kali was saying to her was vocalizing the other side of the argument. \n\n\tThe question was, which of those choices is Eleven going to choose? And if you, like Mike and the others, choose to believe that she is alive somewhere, then she picked something in the middle. But either way, it’s a completely selfless act and heroic act on Eleven’s part. I mean, you’ve seen all those pregnant women, and how many children are going to be born, potentially, using her blood, how the cycle will exist, and how many other kids will go through what she went through. And she’s making damn sure that that never happens again.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOne discussion online this morning is whether Mike made the whole thing up, or Eleven actually told him what her plan was. Or, that during the graduation, Mike realized that Eleven never could have gotten from the truck to the gate because of the kryptonite, so that’s not really her and was a projection. Discuss!\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: The only thing I’ll debunk is that Eleven does not communicate with Mike in any way. But what you just said at the end — yes, at graduation, he’s hearing the speakers distort because the principal is so angry, and it makes him realize that there was the kryptonite. So how could she have possibly made it all the way to the gate? Not only that. How could she have possibly used her powers to bring him into the void? \n\n\tBut there are a lot of other questions. Could Kali have actually done that? Could she have possibly been alive? We like that it’s up to the audience. Obviously, we tell you what the characters choose.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAnd when you decided to bring Kali back, was it in your imagination that she could possibly help Eleven with a potential fake-out at the end? And is she alive long enough to do that?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Well, that’s the question. We wanted to bring her back for a lot of reasons. We wanted that story to have existed for a reason, and we’ve been looking for a way to bring Kali back and a reason to bring her back. And we found it this year.\n\n\tBut it wasn’t just for her ability to project or create these illusions. The other part of it was Hopper and Mike are so close to Eleven. Mike is such — I don’t want to call him naive, but a little bit. And he’s such a dreamer and an optimist. I know a lot of people were frustrated with what Kali was saying to Eleven, and I get that. But what she was saying was accurate in so many ways, and we needed someone to be able to voice that — the dark reality of what potentially exists on the other side of that. So those were two of the main reasons we brought her back into the fold.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s assume Eleven is still alive, because that’s more in the spirit of “Stranger Things.” Can she ever reveal herself again to her friends and family?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: If she were alive, the way I would see it is no. Any contact would risk bringing her back out in the open and starting the cycle again. So, in the story that Mike’s telling, I don’t think he sees a version where they reconnect.\n\t\n\t\tThis is a fandom that I’ve realized over the past month or two does not love ambiguity. How do you feel about the fans who are upset there isn’t more clarity about Eleven?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Are a lot of people upset about that? I really don’t know!\n\t\n\t\tI mean, after Volume 2, people didn’t understand that Jonathan and Nancy broke up. I was like, what are you watching?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: This is obviously intended to be ambiguous, right? With Eleven. At the end of the day, it’s being told from the point of view of Mike and his friends. And they don’t know, and the audience can’t know. If you knew that she was out there and you knew she existed, then she’s very much at risk. So we thought there was something really cool about not knowing for sure, and having our characters choose to believe. We just thought that was more powerful than providing a definitive answer, one way or the other. And I like that the audiences are in Mike, Max, Lucas and Dustin’s shoes, in the sense that they get to choose or not choose. I mean, I’m definitely seeing the majority choosing to believe and side with the kids.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI side with the kids. Can you talk about the final battle between the Mind Flayer, Vecna and our heroes, and how you specifically wanted to stage that?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: We were originally going to go to New Mexico to shoot it, and logistically, that became impossible as we moved into the finale. We shot it in some, like, decrepit quarry in Atlanta. But obviously, WETA visual effects, some of the best in the world, did an incredible job.\n\n\tMainly, what we needed was a huge battlefield for this monster. I don’t think we fully realized quite how large it was until once we built the interior sets. And we were like, “Well, if that’s the size of its interior, how big is its exterior?”\n\n\tMatt Duffer: We were thinking about D&D, and I was playing Baldur’s Gate 3 at the time, and we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat it was for the entire party to work together. Everyone had fully realized — either through self-acceptance or they’ve resolved all their various issues — moving into that final battle, they’re absolutely primed. They’re the ultimate team, and it’s the party working all together to defeat this thing. And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that’s where I go back to Dungeons & Dragons, and something like Baldur’s Gate. Because that’s how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable. Lots of video game references were applied to that final battle.\n\t\n\t\tEleven obviously is the nuclear option, but Will really helps when she’s on her back foot. When did you figure out that part of it?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Well, we knew that Will was obviously going to play a major role in it, and it just came down to, who did we want to deliver the final blow? Was it going to be Will, or was it going to be Eleven? Then we tried to work on a way where it was actually both of them. Eleven throws him into the spike, but Will is the one who allows her to do that. He just breaks him down, rips off his left arm, allowing Eleven that final opportunity. Will was always going to be a key part in defeating Vecna. Without Will, it wouldn’t have happened.\n\t\n\t\tAnd Joyce beheads Vecna. How did you arrive at that moment?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: In the writers’ room, I remember we went through, “Who gets to do the final blow?” It works with all of them in a way. So, we just cycled through, what if Steve does it? What if Dustin does it? And then finally, when we landed on, what if Joyce does it? It felt right for a lot of reasons. She is sort of the mother of this group, the protector. And also, we never got to see her hit anything with that ax, so that felt like such a satisfying way to deliver the final blow to Vecna.\n\t\n\n\tBut it was in editorial really, where, as we were working on it, that we had the initial flashbacks to her remembering back to Bob, and building up that anger. It felt right that it’s just not just a “fuck yeah” moment. It was also, in a way, a cathartic moment for our characters, who are purging all this trauma that’s been caused here. It’s not just a stand-up and cheer moment. It’s remembering that this evil has caused them so much pain.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I remember working with our editor and our composer and just talking to them and going, “Let’s make this the most emotional decapitation in history.” That was the goal.\n\t\n\t\tShe’s, of course, decapitating the kid whom she cast in “Oklahoma.”\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Yeah, I guess so!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWas there ever a scene in the 18 months after Season 4 when Hopper and Joyce realized that Henry Creel, aka Vecna, was the kid they went to high school with?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Yeah, I’m sure there was. We had a walk a fine line with the play — we don’t want to frustrate, because so much of our audience is unable to see it. To have them start talking about it would have been confusing in the context of someone who hasn’t seen the play. But I’m sure they did have that conversation.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: We really needed the final season to be exactly as it would have been without the play. The play is Henry’s backstory after he’s infected by the Mind Flayer. But this is how the season was going to play out regardless.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Mind Flayer is the real evil, which we asked about in our Volume 1 postmortem. But if you had to define what that rock in the briefcase is, how would you describe it?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Hmm. How would we describe it?\n\n\tWhat is it?!Matt Duffer: I’m gonna be sketchy here, Kate, because I will say that is — can I say this, Ross? Because it’s just hard to not say it. \n\t\n\t\tSpinoffy?!\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Spinoffy, yeah. You pinned us down. So annoying. I do want to explain, just because people’s expectations go in certain directions: The spinoff is going to delve into that and explain that, and you’re going to understand it. But it’s a completely different mythology. So it’s not a deep exploration of the Mind Flayer or anything like that. It’s very fresh and very new, but yes, it will answer some of the loose threads that are remaining.Where are you with the spinoff?\n\n\tRoss Duffer: We’re going to start working on it again on Monday. We’ve been working on it on and off. We’ll take a few days off.\n\t\n\t\tOn Monday?!\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: You don’t understand. My favorite part of the show is working on it. It’s not releasing it — that’s just stressful, no matter how it goes when you release it. It’s maybe my least favorite part of the process. I like the creative part. I like making it. So, we’re actually really excited, and it’s very exciting to work with a clean slate: completely new characters, new town, new world, new mythology.\n\n\tAnd no common characters?Matt Duffer: Right. Exactly. No common characters.\n\n\tI wanted to ask you about the review bombing of “The Bridge,” which appears to be a coordinated attack by people who didn’t like Will’s coming out scene. It’s now the lowest rated episode in the series. Can you talk about why it was important to you all along to have Will’s queerness associated with his powers?\n\n\tRoss Duffer: The coming out scene is something we’ve been building to for nine years now. It was a really important scene for us, and a really important scene for Noah — not just from a thematic point of view, but also a narrative point of view. This show has always been about our characters overcoming evil, and in order to overcome this evil, Vecna, in so many ways, represents all the dark thoughts and the evil of society. And for our characters to overcome that, it really becomes about embracing themselves, and then also embracing one another and coming together.Matt Duffer: Right. It was the final step in Will’s journey. And Will is, in so many ways, the key to defeating Vecna. Volume 1 is really about self-acceptance, right? I mean, that’s sort of step one. And then step two is Will is talking to Robin — it’s something that he wants to do. He’s trying to figure out how to come out, and he knows that he needs to do that, and that that’s the final step for him. And he finds the courage to be able to do it. And it’s really the ultimate fuck you to Vecna. That was the intention.\n\n\tAnd were you prepared for a homophobic campaign like that? Matt Duffer: No. I mean, no is the honest truth. Because it is, as Ross said, something we’ve been building for a really long time. I always say, Ross and I are many things, but subtle is not one of those things!\n\n\tRoss Duffer: We’re proud of the episode, and we’re proud of the scene, and proud of Noah, who gave a really brave, very vulnerable performance.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I think that’s where Ross and I were most sensitive, was Noah — because of how close to home this hit for him. And our goal was to make sure that he was comfortable and happy with the scene. And when he was, we felt good about it. I’ve been texting with him a lot, but texting with him specifically after that scene and after that episode aired. And he’s in a really good place. He’s very proud of the scene, and we’re proud of the scene.\n\t\n\t\tHe should be, and so should you. I have another question along these lines. There’s a QAnon-ish conspiracy theory going around that Volume 2 was — and I’m doing air quotes, in case you’re not actually looking at me — “tampered with.” That there were scenes that were cut, including El and Mike going into Camazotz to rescue Will, and a Mike and Will one-on-one scene. Have you seen this Google Doc?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Someone sent it to us, yeah. Obviously, that’s not a real thing. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tHave you seen the Change.org petition with 370,000+ signatures to release the footage?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: I have not seen that! I don’t think there’s a single cut scene in the entire season. \n\n\tMatt Duffer: The show has just grown so massive. Online, there’s just so much misinformation. Just tons of it. We would be here for hours trying to bat down the stuff that was not true. But at the end of the day, hopefully the work speaks for itself, and it is the show that Ross and I wanted to make. Netflix was, and has always been, incredible. I mean, there’s no interference or direction at all from them on us. They really trust us, and that’s been true from Season 1 on. It’s never changed, even though the show and the size of the audience have grown.\n\t\n\t\tWe do need to wrap, I know, but I saw you guys were at the Americana last night. Did you actually sit and watch it? And how was it?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: It was awesome. We never get that experience. I mean, the premieres are one thing, but that’s generally friends and crew. So, to sit there with just true fans — they’re all decked out in merch, and to hear them in real-time responding, whether it’s applauding or laughing or crying. It was an incredible experience. It was really special.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• Variety‘s series finale recap• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 2 Spoilers• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 1 Spoilers• Our 13 Burning Questions Ahead of the Series Finale• Noah Schnapp on That Scene in Volume 2• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1• Why Will’s Coming Out Is Seismic• Director Shawn Levy on Will’s Huge Breakthrough• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff\n",

V, Jung Kook, Jimin and RM were gone around the same time ... from December 2023 until June 2025.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Suga was able to tour in support of his \"D-Day\" album before enlisting in September 2023 ... and completed his service in June 2025 to officially wrap up the group's military duties.\n      \n    \n          The group sparked a ton of buzz last month ... when they posted several snaps on social media from rehearsals -- hinting their comeback was on the horizon.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          Now that the group has an official return date, fans can now count down the days until BTS' new album is in their hands. Tour dates have not been announced just yet ... but we take it that's the next nugget of info to come.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                K-Pop\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

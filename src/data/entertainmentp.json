    "body": "\n\tA sleeper hit in 2022, Jalmari Helander’s “Sisu” was a cartoonishly down-and-dirty adrenaline rush for action fans, not unlike the OG “Mad Max” decades earlier. That particular comparison grows even more apt with the arrival of “Sisu: Road to Revenge,” in which Jorma Tommila’s seemingly unkillable protagonist must battle innumerable bad guys at high speed on various forms of transport. \n\n\tBigger isn’t necessarily better, and this larger-scaled sequel almost inevitably lacks some of the freshness that made the original such a kick. Still, the director’s undeniable flair for gleefully excessive mayhem and propulsive pacing will more than satisfy those who loved its predecessor. Its comparatively lean, mean progress feels particularly welcome after so many recent screen thrill rides that delivered far less punch at much greater length and expense. \n\t\n\n\tLast time around, decommissioned Finnish army commando Aatami Korpi (Tommila) only wanted to be left alone as WW2 wound down. Alas, finding gold in the Lapland tundra awakened the greed of departing Nazi forces with zero idea who they were messing with: a “one-man death squad” who’d already claimed many a uniformed Russian life after Soviet forces killed his family during the brief but brutal “Winter War” of 1940. His vengeance was sweet, gory and spectacularly over-the-top. \n\n\n\tThis time, the terrifically fit 60-something protagonist is encountered in 1946, the global conflict now officially well over. He’s driving a huge truck to his old home, which thanks to redrawn borders now lies in Russian territory. He intends to dismantle, then reassemble it in what remains of Finland. But Soviet authorities haven’t forgotten that this “legend” singlehandedly snuffed out more than 300 of their troops. \n\t\n\n\tRed Army officer Igor Draganov (Stephen Lang) is released from a Siberian prison — where he’s being held for committing innumerable needless wartime atrocities — by a KBG bigwig (Richard Brake) to ensure Aatami never sees Finnish soil again. The two adversaries are uniquely matched, in that Korpi knows the other brutally murdered his wife and sons, while Draganov won’t feel he’s truly completed the job until the father is dead, too.\n\n\tThis setup takes about 10 minutes, after which it’s one dynamic set-piece after another: Aatami manages to escape an initial roadblock-cum-ambush, then attack by phalanx of motorcylists, followed by fighter planes with machine guns. After a brief aquatic interlude, there’s a protracted climax aboard a train speeding back to Siberia, bearing myriad armed Soviets plus one bloodied, shackled prisoner. Needless to say, the survival odds are stacked — against the poor Russkies, that is. \n\n\tDivided into six titled “chapters,” these episodes are mostly aces in terms of staging, stuntwork and CGI. Occasionally, the violence comes so thick, we’re not quite sure what just happened. And even within the suspended-disbelief bounds established, a few hairbreadth escapes are preposterous, notably one where Aatami makes a tank do mid-air acrobatics to leap past a barrier. \n\n\tEntertaining as it is, such craziness isn’t so well supported by a thread of black comedy as it was in the first “Sisu.” You could also argue there’s a bit too much dwelling on general ickiness here, as the manliest man in the far north seems to be frequently digging bullets and other objects out of his lacerated flesh. (Spending pretty much the last half hour bleeding in boxer shorts amid subzero weather appears not to bother him in the slightest.) \n\n\tBut Tommila’s turn retains a degree of flinty humor, even some warmth — despite never getting so much as a word to speak. Lang’s expletive-riddled speech comprises most of the dialogue. If Draganov isn’t the most distinctive villain role he’s ever essayed, he still fills its shoes well, receiving a particularly explosive exit as reward. Brake’s part is brief, while other cast members provide no more than cannon fodder. The canine performer playing the protagonist’s Bedlington terrier disappears for quite some time, in one among several minor if conspicuous plot holes in Helander’s script that it’s best just to step over. \n\t\n\n\tShot largely in Estonia, “Sisu: Road to Revenge” is muscular rather than ingratiating in most aspects, from Mika Orasma’s widescreen cinematography to the physical design contributions. The fairly standard action bombast of Juri Seppa and Tuomas Wainola’s original score gets some idiosyncratic flavor via passages of throat singing and spaghetti-Western-style whistling. The English-language version reviewed has a bit of subtitled Finnish speech toward the end; a separate Finnish-language edition is also in release.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIsrael’s mostly Arabic-language international feature submission “The Sea” offers a deceptively simple premise: a headstrong 12-year-old boy from a Palestinian village in the occupied West Bank illegally enters Israel on his own to see the sea. Without being judgmental, director-writer Shai Carmeli Pollak uses this foundation to expose painful realities of the occupation, as well as the indifference to them displayed by many of those in Tel Aviv’s urban “bubble.” Made as a collaboration between Jewish and Palestinian Israelis, the film becomes a deeply humanist tale about borders, permits, the interdependent economies of two neighbors and the power of the dominant language. Menemsha Films is distributing in the U.S.\n\t\n\n\tKhaled (Mohammed Ghazaoui, the best actor winner at Israel’s Ophir Awards for his nearly silent performance) lives with his two younger brothers and an older sister in a home lovingly but somewhat ineffectively presided over by his grandmother (Marlene Bajjali). His mother is dead and the village’s harsh economic situation leads his father Ribhi (Khalifa Natour, winner of the supporting actor Ophir) to work construction jobs in Israel. Since Ribhi lacks a permit to be in Israel, he sometimes stays on his job site for weeks at a time and calls home at night.\n\n\n\tAs with many tween boys, consideration doesn’t appear to be Khaled’s strong suit. Without much supervision, he often finds trouble. He heedlessly wanders into demonstrations against the occupation, during which the Israeli soldiers repel the demonstrators by firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Without considering the danger, he collects empty shells and canisters, which he can sell for the metal. When we see him stow one metal item in his backpack, it becomes an object of tension as we wonder who might discover it.\n\t\n\n\tLike his classmates, Khaled has been eagerly awaiting his school’s trip to the Mediterranean. For him and most of the others, it will mark the first time they have been to the beach and can splash in the waves. The sea is less than an hour from Khaled’s village, but it lies within Israel’s borders. At a checkpoint, a young soldier with a large assault rifle enters the bus and the previously noisy youngsters fall silent. The teacher presents a list of who is on board, but for unknown reasons Khaled lacks a permit to enter and must disembark and return home, while the others drive on.\n\n\tIndignant, Khaled crosses illegally into Israel along with a bunch of manual workers. He has no plan, no money and doesn’t speak or understand Hebrew — but he is determined to see the sea. Like some holy fool, his determination and innocence protect him, but only up to a point.\n\n\tShot in a straightforward style with an acute attention to detail, Pollak shows the urban landscapes and multi-ethnic denizens of Tel Aviv through Khaled’s eyes. The boy has the presence of mind to seek help from Arabic-language speakers, but these are not so easy to find. One kind young woman gives him a slip of paper and teaches him to say in Hebrew, “Excuse me, where is the sea?”\n\n\tMeanwhile, Ribhi is notified of Khaled’s disappearance and hears that he crossed into Israel. Angry and frustrated, he leaves the relative safety of his workplace to try to find the lad. Armed with his basic Hebrew, along with some money, a bus pass and a simple black yarmulke provided by his workmates to help him blend in, Ribhi sets out. A fine, nuanced performer, Natour makes us aware of the danger his illegal status puts him in. Every time he speaks in Arabic on his phone, he feels that people regard him suspiciously.\n\n\tUltimately, Khaled and Ribhi reunite, but not in the way viewers might have expected. The powerful finale, witnessed by Tel Avivans and tourists drinking iced soy lattes at an outdoor café, serves as a powerful empathy generator for some, although not all. After the film nabbed five awards at Israel’s annual Ophirs, the Minister of Culture, outraged at the depiction of Israeli soldiers, threatened to defund the ceremony.\n\n\tDespite what some may think, “The Sea,” is no cynical usurpation of the “other” or a sanitization of Israel’s reputation. Veteran helmer Pollak (“Bil’in, My Love”), an Arabic speaker, has again ventured to a place most Israelis tend to repress or ignore. Producer Agbariya is known for prize-winning films by Palestinian directors such as “Thirst,” “Omar” and “Mediterranean Fever.” Their sincere collaboration even involves their extended families, with Agbariya’s brother playing the role of Khaled’s uncle, plus Pollak’s wife and daughter portraying friendly people that Khaled meets on the Tel Aviv streets.\n\t\n\n\tLike Tunisia’s Oscar submission “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” “The Sea” offers a look at contemporary interactions between Palestinians and Israelis. But while “Hind Rajab” presents and preserves a sadly lost voice, “The Sea” is all the more powerful for showing how other young Palestinian voices are going unheard.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAustralia’s National Indian Film Festival (NIFFA) is expanding into regional territories and has signed partnerships with India’s National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) and the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) ahead of its 2026 edition.\n\n\tThe festival, which spans seven Australian capital cities including Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, will add six regional locations for 2026: Broken Hill, Alice Springs, Dubbo, Leeton, Griffith and Geelong. Additional regional centers are being added in coming weeks, organizers said.\n\t\n\n\tNIFFA is signing a memorandum of understanding with NFDC India and IFFI at the WAVES Film Bazaar, positioning the festival as a key platform for Indian cinema in Australia. \n\n\n\tThe expansion comes as India has become the largest source of new migrants to Australia, with Punjabi now the fastest-growing language in the country. Indian films are currently outperforming Australian films at the domestic box office, according to festival organizers. The shift, combined with the Australia-India Co-Production Treaty, has positioned Australia as a strategic gateway for Indian cinema.\n\n\t“NIFFA was created to honor India’s many cinemas, not just Bollywood, and to give Australia a national platform to engage with Indian storytelling,” said Anupam Sharma, the festival’s director and founder. “The love we receive from cities and regional centers across Australia shows that this festival isn’t growing — it’s exploding. With NFDC and IFFI coming on board, NIFFA 2026 will be the biggest national celebration of Indian cinema outside India.”\n\t\n\n\tA new section titled “His Excellency Recommends” will feature five Indian films curated by the Indian High Commissioner for Australian audiences.\n\n\tNew programming includes a Co-Production Pitch Forum connecting Indian and Australian producers with funding bodies and studios, with one project receiving a co-production and distribution deal. Forum Films, an Indian cinema distributor operating in India, Fiji and New Zealand, will fund one distribution deal for the Australia-New Zealand territory.\n\n\tReturning partners for 2026 include Dendy Cinemas, NDTV, SBS, Marriott, Murdoch University and the Australia India Business Council, which celebrates its 40th anniversary next year.\n\n\tThe 2026 edition has assembled an advisory council including Western Australia’s first Sikh Member of Parliament Parwinder Kaur, Kings Counsel Brian Hayes, and several state legislators including NSW Members of Parliament Warren Kirby and Charishma Kaliyanda, Northern Territory Minister Jinson Charls, and Motion Picture Association VP of communications for Asia Pacific Stephen Jenner.\n\n\tKaur described the festival as embodying the spirit of Australia-India collaboration, weaving stories that transcend borders and celebrate diversity. “Culture and creativity are the DNA of human connection,” she said.\n\n\tHayes noted that film is a major component of the arts industry that opens up the world to sharing stories across boundaries. India and Australia share many common features, he said, which combine to make NIFFA an ideal vehicle for collaboration.\n\n\tKirby emphasized the enormous opportunity for collaboration between Indian and Australian cinema. “We have some of the world’s best production crews and storytellers, and there is an exciting future in greater ties between the two industries,” he said.\n\n\tCharls called cinema one of the most powerful ways to share stories, struggles, humor and hopes. “The National Indian Film Festival of Australia brings this extraordinary storytelling tradition to new audiences, strengthening the cultural, social and people-to-people ties between India and Australia,” he said. In the Northern Territory, diversity is celebrated as a strength, and the festival exemplifies how art can bridge distances and bring communities together, he added.\n\t\n\n\tJenner said he’s excited to join the NIFFA advisory board at a time when Indian cinema is entering a remarkable new chapter, with creativity surging across languages, genres and generations. “Global audiences are paying attention like never before. This is a moment of expansion, opportunity and reinvention,” he said. “NIFFA has an important role to play in showcasing this energy to Australian audiences and building new bridges between our screen industries.”\n\n\tKaliyanda said she’s proud to help drive a bold vision for the future of independent film and creative storytelling, working to build a stronger, more sustainable and innovative industry.\n\n\tAustralia India Business Council chair Deepak Raj Gupta added: “AIBC looks forward to collaborating with NIFFA for important conversations around commerce, cinema and culture between Australia and India.”\n\n\tThe festival takes place in the second half of March 2026, with film submissions closing Jan. 20. The program will be announced on Australia Day, which coincides with India’s Republic Day on Jan. 26.\n",

    "body": "\n\tZee Studios and Bhansali Productions will release Bollywood romantic drama “Do Deewane Seher Mein” on Feb. 20, 2026, positioning the film to capitalize on Valentine’s week moviegoing.\n\n\tThe film stars Siddhant Chaturvedi and Mrunal Thakur in what producers are billing as a contemporary romance with old-school sensibilities. Ravi Udyawar directs the project.\n\n\tChaturvedi recently starred in “Kho Gaye Hum Kahan” and “Gehraiyaan,” continuing to diversify his portfolio beyond his breakthrough role in “Gully Boy.” Thakur’s credits include “Sita Ramam,” “Jersey” and Netflix streaming series “Lust Stories 2.”\n\t\n\n\tUdyawar previously helmed the 2017 thriller “Mom,” starring Sridevi in her final film role.\n\n\n\tProducers describe the story as a return to sincere, heartfelt romance in Hindi cinema, with the musical score blending contemporary production with melodic sensibilities designed to evoke classic romance films.\n\n\tSanjay Leela Bhansali produces alongside Prerna Singh, Umesh Kumar Bansal and Bharat Kumar Ranga in association with Ravi Udyawar Films. Bhansali’s recent directorial work includes “Gangubai Kathiawadi” and the Netflix series “Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar,” while his production company has backed titles including “Tuesdays and Fridays” and “Malaal.”\n\n\tBhansali’s next directorial spectacle “Love & War,” starring Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal, will open in theaters on Aug. 14, 2026. Kapoor debuted as a leading man with Bhansali’s romance “Saawariya” (2007), a Fyodor Dostoevsky adaptation. Bhatt headlined Bhansali’s women empowerment saga “Gangubai Kathiawadi,” which bowed at the 2022 Berlinale. They starred together in Disney’s sci-fi mythological superhero film “Brahmastra Part One: Shiva” (2022). Kaushal, meanwhile, delivered 2025’s biggest Bollywood hit with the historical epic “Chhaava,” following his turns in “Bad Newz,” “Sam Bahadur” and “Dunki.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tFarhan Akhtar‘s war epic “120 Bahadur” will make cinematic history with an unprecedented screening at the Rezang La War Memorial Auditorium in Chushul village, Ladakh, marking what organizers claim is the highest-altitude film release ever at 16,452 feet.\n\n\tThe film centers on the Battle of Rezang La, the 1962 conflict in which 120 Indian soldiers of Charlie Company, 13 Kumaon Regiment, fought Chinese forces at an altitude of over 16,000 feet in Ladakh, with 114 soldiers killed in action.\n\t\n\n\tThe screening on Nov. 22 will bring the film to soldiers and local residents near the site of the battle, just days after its 63rd anniversary on Nov. 18. Mobile theater company PictureTime will host 14 shows at the memorial auditorium for military personnel serving in the region and villagers.\n\n\n\t“We are going to show the film at Rezang La memorial auditorium in Chushul village, which is next to the mountain pass where the war was fought,” said Sushil Chaudhary, founder-CEO of PictureTime, who will be on site amid harsh minus-10-degree Celsius conditions. “This is going to be the highest altitude screening for any film. We are proud that the story of this incredible bravery will be witnessed by the villagers and soldiers on the big screen. We will show the film for at least two weeks.”\n\n\tThe mountain premiere follows the recent announcement that “120 Bahadur” will become the first film to release across India’s defense theaters. In partnership with GenSync Brat Media, PictureTime will screen the film exclusively for the defence community in over 800 cinema halls nationwide starting Nov. 21.\n\t\n\n\tThe initiative represents PictureTime’s latest effort to expand cinema access beyond traditional venues. The company is currently operating an inflatable theater at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa, screening titles including Shah Rukh Khan classics and contemporary films through Nov. 28.\n\n\tThe ensemble cast includes Akhtar, Raashii Khanna, Sparsh Walia, Vivan Bhatena, Dhanveer Singh, Digvijay Pratap, Sahib Verma, Ankit Siwach, Devendra Ahirwar, Ashutosh Shukla, Brijesh Karanwal, Atul Singh, Ajinkya Deo and Eijaz Khan.\n\n\tRazneesh “Razy” Ghai directs. Ritesh Sidhwani and Akhtar produce for Excel Entertainment, with Amit Chandrra for Trigger Happy Studios. “120 Bahadur” opens in cinemas Nov. 21.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEddie Murphy, as he has always been the first to acknowledge, is the rare comedian who set out to model himself on rock ‘n’ roll superstardom. He wanted to be Richard Pryor, but he also wanted to be Elvis. That’s why, in his two legendary stand-up performances of the 1980s, the HBO special “Eddie Murphy Delirious” and “Eddie Murphy Raw” (the 1987 concert movie that’s still the highest-grossing comedy concert film ever released), he strutted around in leather suits — a red one open to the waist in “Delirious,” a paisley blue one in “Raw” — that showcased him as the sexiest stand-up comedian the world had ever known.\n\t\n\n\tIn “Being Eddie,” the engaging if also relentlessly upbeat and manicured documentary portrait of Murphy that’s now showing on Netflix, Jerry Seinfeld makes the point that comedians aren’t really known for being good-looking. But in the ’80s, Murphy, with his sleek swagger and bedroom eyes, was the comedian as rock-star pin-up, and that smolder of glamour was built into the effrontery of his act. He was like a Richard Pryor who wasn’t sitting on a powder keg of anxiety. He was bold, insolent, cathartically hilarious. His other role model was Muhammad Ali, and the way Murphy explains it in “Being Eddie” is that he, Oprah Winfrey, Barack Obama, and Michael Jordan were “the first generation of Black overachievers, the first fearless ones,” adding, “I think that’s what we got from Ali.”\n\n\n\tPryor, Elvis, Ali: That’s quite a legacy to build yourself on. And Murphy, for a few years there, was such a mighty god of comedy that he became the next figure in that line. In the Reagan era, he could do no wrong, which is why it didn’t even matter that “Beverly Hills Cop” was, at heart, a serviceable, ramshackle vehicle that worked because Murphy all but hijacked the movie. His in-your-face, fastest-mouth-in-the-West presence was ahead of everyone, ahead of the whole culture. He talked and talked and talked, and audiences were electrified. Pryor had been a revolutionary talent (and let’s be clear: he was a genius), but Murphy was revolutionary too. We hear eloquent testimonials from Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock about how Murphy, even more than Pryor, redefined the power of what a Black movie star could be.\n\t\n\n\tThe first half of “Being Eddie” is very satisfying, because in telling the story of Murphy’s rise it invites us to revel in what a magical performer he was. Every detail is fascinating — the way he grew up in an all-Black neighborhood of Roosevelt, Long Island, fixated, from the age of 13, on the destiny of his future fame (“That was my mantra. And I really, really, really, really believed it with every fiber”), not just idolizing Pryor but channeling him, becoming a stand-up comedian in his teens, then landing on “Saturday Night Live” just out of high school, when he was only 19, in what turned out to be the most unlikely opportune moment.\n\n\tHe started there in 1980-81, the first season after the original cast members had left, and Lorne Michaels along with them. It was a new show, with Jean Douminian in charge, and audiences resented it; they wanted their Dan and Gilda and Bill and Laraine back. The new edition was something of a washout, but Murphy busted through the mediocrity because everything he did was so outrageous and alive that it was undeniable.\n\n\tI can still remember how you’d wait for Murphy to show up, seeing what he would dare to do next: Mr. Robinson’s Neighborhood, Gumby, Velvet Jones, his X-ray impersonations of Bill Cosby and Mr. T and Stevie Wonder, and the recurring sketch that cemented his rock-star status, James Brown’s Celebrity Hot Tub, because apart from how funny it was it’s as if he had become James Brown, in all his big-bad-dog charisma. In “Being Eddie,” Jamie Foxx captures something about Murphy when he recalls “seein’ Eddie on ‘SNL’…skinny. That’s when comics are most lethal, when we’re skinny. When we ain’t had no food, we ain’t even ate yet. He’s just skinny and funny as fuck.”\n\n\tMurphy built on that authority in his first movie, “48 HRS.” (1982), which came together because Jeffrey Katzenberg saw his talent and rolled out the carpet for him. Yet he was nearly fired during the first weeks of filming. By the standards of corrupt Hollywood thinking, Murphy was playing “the Black sidekick,” but he never got that memo. Somehow, he took over the movie (from Nick Nolte at his most shaggy-gruff), and in the bar scene he did nothing less than rewrite the rules of what a Black actor could be. Brandishing a stiletto, he comes up to a white stooge and says, “You know what I am? I’m your worst fuckin’ nightmare, man. I’m a n—- with a badge. That mean I got the mission to kick your fuckin’ ass whenever I feel like it.” He says it like he means it. It’s as if all the power of the rising energy of hip-hop was compressed into that one game-changing, American-paradigm-shifting speech. And…he was funny as fuck.\n\t\n\n\tThe Eddie Murphy we see in “Being Eddie” views that whole period with a Zen detachment that’s compelling. I’m used to thinking of Murphy as compulsively private, to the point that he could get prickly with interviewers. But in “Being Eddie,” seated alone in the living room of the beautiful mansion he built in Los Angeles, he speaks with an expansive ease, and a directness, that has a captivating surface candor. At 64, he’s still lean and youthful, maybe one result of the fact that he shunned cocaine (as in the first time he went out on the town with John Belushi and Robin Williams, and they laid lines on the table, which he refused), never drank, and tended to sit quietly in the back of parties nursing a Coca-Cola. Was the rock ‘n’ roll spiritual-son-of-Richard Pryor comedy upstart actually shy? Some call him that. But maybe he was just sane.\n\n\tYet the documentary, directed by Angus Wall, treats him with kid gloves and, bottom line, refuses to go near his personal peccadilloes (though he confesses to having OCD as a kid, which he says he cured in himself when he learned it was a mental illness), or really to get into his personal life at all. We learn that he has 10 children, and that he got divorced, but there’s no other mention of the woman he was married to for 23 years. The implication is that what Eddie Murphy became was a paterfamilias. And maybe he did. He speaks with reverence of how having children changes you.\n\n\tBut the reason the movie feels a bit bubble-wrapped is that it goes through the paces of Murphy’s career, ticking off almost every key moment as a creative triumph. And while there’s no doubt that Murphy kept trying things, going with the flow of what he was offered, I still think there’s a mystery at the heart of Eddie Murphy’s career that the film doesn’t touch, and that is this: Why did he draw back? Why did the Eddie Murphy who had positively ruled in the ’80s end up taking a back seat to a Murphy who was a far more complacent talent?\n\n\tPart of it is that you can only by the young Elvis once. Murphy, as the critic Elvis Mitchell argues in the documentary, didn’t just change comedy — he changed the world. And once you’ve done that you likely can’t exert that revolutionary magic again. But Murphy’s description of why he never did stand-up after “Raw” feels lame. He says that when he would go to comedy clubs to try out bits, the unfinished routines would be reported on in the gossip columns, which he hated. Maybe that’s true, but you want to go: So what? That didn’t stop Pryor or Robin Williams or Seinfeld. Murphy could, and should, have continued to work in the awesome medium that is stand-up — not every year, but at least once or twice more, going back to giving us the Eddie Murphy vision of the state of the world. (He could still do it now.)\n\t\n\n\tEarly in the documentary, Murphy says he can’t think of another actor who has done as many types of roles as he has. Normally, that observation would be made by someone who’s not the subject of the film. But what it reveals is that Murphy thinks of himself as the ultimate chameleon, factoring in the multiple roles he has played under pounds of prosthetics in films like “Coming to America” and “The Nutty Professor” and “Norbit.” There’s no question that a few of those roles are gems (the old Jewish man in “Coming to America,” the whole family of Klumps). Evaluated not as comedy but simply as acting, those bite-size performances are rather amazing. (It’s one of the reasons I’d passionately hoped, 30 years ago, that Murphy would play Martin Luther King Jr. in a proposed Oliver Stone conspiracy biopic. He could have been brilliant.) And yes, he’s terrific in “Dreamgirls.”\n\n\tBut the simple truth is that Eddie Murphy’s movies wound up losing their edge. He got his mojo back for “The Nutty Professor” (which was 30 years ago), and also for “Shrek” (five years later), but in the vast majority of films I’ve seen him in since, I often get the feeling that I’m watching an Eddie Murphy replicant — an actor doing an impersonation of his earlier state of being. In the ’80s, when he wasn’t faking it, a simple talk-show appearance of his (we’re shown several of them) could be mesmerizing. I think what changed is that he became the cautious guardian of his brand.\n\n\tMaybe what was going on behind that façade is that he’d become a family man, and that’s where he was putting his passion. But even as he sustained his comedy career, doing “family movies” like “Dr. Doolittle” and “Daddy Day Care,” he ceased to be the blissful renegade he once was. “Being Eddie” reminds us that Eddie Murphy, back when he was changing the world, was an explosive comedy artist. The movie tries to bring his career full circle by devoting too much time to his 2019 hosting of “Saturday Night Live,” as if that was an epochal event. And more than anything, Murphy seems happy now, a man who has transcended his demons. In “Being Eddie,” you can get a contact high off his well-being, but you may wish that a few of those demons would come back.\n",

TMZ has confirmed.\n      \n    \n          We're told \"The Real Housewives of Orange County\" star allegedly gave Hayes, one of the 6-year-old twins, Ritalin multiple times, despite the child not having an ADHD diagnosis.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          According to sources, the situation escalated when King allegedly asked the school nurse to give Hayes the medication as well. That request reportedly triggered a Child Protective Services investigation.\n      \n\n          King was granted supervised visitation twice a week with Hayes, his twin brother Hart, and their older sister, Aspen.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          As we previously reported ... a temporary restraining order was put in place after a school employee allegedly contacted CPS with concerns. A judge is expected to consider a more permanent solution in a custody hearing set for early December.\n      \n    \n          King and Edmonds, who tied the knot in 2014 before splitting in 2019 amid a cheating scandal, have been operating under a joint custody agreement since May 2021.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          We've reached out to reps for Meghan ... so far, no word back yet.

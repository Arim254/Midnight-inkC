    "body": "\n\tKorean sales powerhouse Finecut has closed multiple international deals for local hit “Boss,” the action-comedy that has pulled in over 2.3 million admissions in its home territory and ranks as the fifth highest-grossing Korean film of 2025.\n\n\tThe gang-themed comedy has been snapped up by distributors across Asia and beyond, including Abnormal Studios for Cambodia, Star Entertainment for the Indian subcontinent, and Clover Films for Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Japan’s KDDI, Mongolia’s Izagur Media, and Vietnam’s Khang Media have also acquired the film.\n\t\n\n\tIn North America, 213 Pictures & Media picked up rights, while Cai Chang International secured Taiwan. Encore Inflight nabbed inflight rights. The deals were inked following the film’s screening in the Korean Cinema Today Special Premiere section at Busan International Film Festival.\n\n\n\t“Boss” centers on an ironic power struggle within a gangster organization, where two men are reluctant to assume leadership while a third desperately craves the position that nobody wants him to have. The ensemble cast features Jo Woo-jin (“Harbin,” “Hard Hit”), Jung Kyung-ho (“Men of Plastic,” “Hospital Playlist”), Park Ji-hwan (the “Roundup” franchise), Lee Kyoo-hyung (“Prison Playbook”), and Lee Sung-min (“No Other Choice,” “Handsome Guys”).\n\n\tThe film already rolled out theatrically in North America on Oct. 17 and Mongolia on Oct. 24, with Indonesia slated for a Nov. 5 bow and Taiwan set for Nov. 21. \n\n\tDirector Ra Hee-chan made the rounds at Hawaii International Film Festival to promote the film, engaging directly with audiences to boost the film’s international profile.\n\t\n\n\tThe comedy is produced by Hive Media Corp, the outfit behind “12.12: The Day,” “Handsome Guys” and “Harbin,” and presented by Hive Media Corp and Mindmark.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSydney Sweeney is getting ready to finish filming “Euphoria” Season 3.\n\n\t“I wrap ‘Euphoria’ in two days,” she told me at the AFI Fest premiere of her new drama “Christy” on Saturday night in Los Angeles.\n\n\tSweeney talked about returning to the HBO series after three years. “It’s mostly the same crew, so it feels like I’m going home to family,” she said. “I’ve grown up with them. I was 20 when I did the pilot, so being able to see a lot of the same people, it feels very comforting.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile HBO previously announced that the third season would be its last, I did ask Sweeney about the possibility of a fourth. “I cannot confirm any information,” she said.\n\n\n\tJust last week, Jacob Elordi teased Season 3 while walking the red carpet at the Academy Museum Gala in Los Angeles. “It was incredible, man,” he told me. “It was incredibly liberating. I got to play something so sort of far out from what I’ve done before.”\n\n\tHe said that series creator Sam Levinson “constructed something that’s incredibly clever and cinematic. I think people are really going to like it.”\n\n\tElordi also insisted he doesn’t know exactly what happens in the third season. “Everybody shoots at different storylines,” he said. “I don’t know what anyone else is doing. I had a really singular storyline. You don’t know what the other story lines are. It’s like FBI files. So it’s great because I’ll get to consume the show the same way that everybody else does as a fan, which I haven’t been able to do before. I’m really excited.”\n\t\n\n\tSweeney said, “I feel like I’m going to get to watch it with everyone else.”\n\n\tSweeney will soon begin prep work to play actress Kim Novak in “Scandalous.” The Colman Domingo-directed film tells the story of Novak’s interracial romance with Sammy Davis Jr. (David Jonsson) in 1957.\n\n\t“I’m going to meet with her,” Sweeney said. “I’m going to work with some movement coaches and dialect coaches, watch and study all of her films. I’m really excited.”\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tAnother win for anime. \n\n\t“Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc,” the latest offering from Sony’s Crunchyroll, was No. 1 at the box office with $17.2 ",
    "body": "\n\tAnother win for anime. \n\n\t“Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc,” the latest offering from Sony’s Crunchyroll, was No. 1 at the box office with $17.2 million from 3,003 North American theaters. It’s the second consecutive success for Crunchyroll following September’s sleeper hit “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle,” which cemented a genre record with its $70 million debut.\n\n\n\tTo a lesser degree, “Chainsaw Man” also eclipsed expectations while managing to outpace a movie about one of the biggest names in music (Disney and 20th Century’s musical biopic “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere“), an adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s best-selling novel (Paramount’s romantic drama “Regretting You”), as well as last weekend’s champion (Universal and Blumhouse’s “Black Phone 2”). \n\t\n\n\t“Regretting You” opened in third place with a better-than-expected $12.8 million from 3,393 venues. Meanwhile, “Deliver Me From Nowhere,” starring “The Bear” actor Jeremy Allen White as the Boss, underwhelmed at No. 4 with $9.1 million from 3,460 locations. And “Black Phone 2” slid to second with $13 million from 3,460 theaters, declining 52% from its domestic debut. So far, the horror sequel has earned $48 million in North America and $80.4 million globally, marking a needed win for Blumhouse in what’s otherwise been a rough theatrical year for the low-budget horror empire.\n\n\t“Chainsaw Man,” which serves as a sequel to the popular manga TV series, is playing in subtitled and dubbed versions. It’s also showing on premium large formats such as Imax, which carry higher ticket prices. Nearly 75% of opening weekend crowds were males, while 50% were under the age of 25 years old. Those audience members bestowed the film an “A” on CinemaScore exit polls, the highest grade in the top five on box office charts. Anime features tend to be front-loaded with big debuts followed by substantial drops in subsequent weekends. Even if that happens, “Chainsaw Man” has already grossed $108 million worldwide, thanks to a robust international run.\n\t\n\n\t“This opening follows a big success in Asia. But it’s not just Asia. Anime is doing well everywhere now,” David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, says of “Chainsaw Man.” “This is a worldwide phenomenon.”\n\n\t“Springsteen” launched below projections at the international box office with $7 million, bringing its global tally to a soft $16.1 million. The biopic cost $55 million, and since theater owners keep roughly half of the ticket sales, the film needs to keep rocking at the box office to justify its price tag. Luckily, moviegoers appeared to like the film more than critics; “Deliver Me From Nowhere” landed a “B+” grade on CinemaScore and holds a 61% Rotten Tomatoes average.\n\n\t“Deliver Me From Nowhere” takes a less conventional approach compared to other recent musical biopics about artists like Bob Dylan (“A Complete Unknown”) or Bob Marley (“One Love”). Instead of focusing on his mainstream rise or the making of his biggest hits like “Born in the U.S.A.” or “Born to Run,” director Scott Cooper’s film chronicles the writing of Springsteen’s 1982 critically adored (but less commercial) acoustic album “Nebraska.” Ticket sales were initially tracking a similar start to last year’s “A Complete Unknown,” featuring Timothée Chalamet as the “Like a Rolling Stone” composer in his earlier years. But that film, from Disney’s Searchlight banner, ended up faring better with $11.6 million to start. “A Complete Unknown,” which had the benefit of playing over the holiday season, eventually powered to $75 million domestically and $140 million globally. \n\n\t“As a genre, these pictures have the natural advantage of great music,” Gross says. However, he caveats that “Bruce Springsteen was not a controversial figure; his music was not part of a social movement; and he did not hurt himself with self-destructive behavior.” Unlike commercial hits in the vein of Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” or Elton John’s “Rocketman,” this film is a “smaller story […] about the artist’s struggle for his unique voice.”\n\n\t“Regretting You,” produced by Constantin Films, earned another $10 million overseas for a worldwide start of $22.85 million. Audiences — 80% of whom were female — were mixed on the movie, which earned a “B” grade on CinemaScore. Allison Williams and Mckenna Grace star as a mother and daughter who grapple with the aftermath of a devastating accident. “Regretting You” cost a modest $30 million and marks Hoover’s second novel to get the big screen treatment following “It Ends With Us,” which became a breakout hit with $344 million worldwide. If “Regretting You” sticks around on the big screen, it’ll cement Hoover as a major cinematic force. Her books “Verity” and “Reminders of Him” are currently being adapted by other studios for release in 2026.\n\t\n\n\tDisney’s sci-fi tentpole “Tron: Ares” rounded out the top five with $4.7 million from 2,940 venues in its third outing. The film, which carries a massive $180 million price tag, has grossed just $63 million domestically and $123 million worldwide to date.\n\n\tAlso new to theaters was Neon’s supernatural thriller “Shelby Oaks,” which bowed at No. 7 with $2.3 million from 1,823 locations. The film follows the fictional disappearance of a YouTube star and amateur ghost hunter in the abandoned town of Shelby Oaks. The movie was saddled with a “C+” grade on CinemaScore, which is typical for the horror genre but doesn’t necessarily bode well for word-of-mouth.\n\n\tIn limited release, director Yorgos Lanthimos and star Emma Stone’s latest collaboration, “Bugonia,” kicked off with $690,000 from 17 locations — averaging a strong $40,588 per location. Stone plays a high-powered CEO who is kidnapped by two conspiracy theorists who believe she is an extraterrestrial being sent to destroy Earth. The film’s commercial viability will be tested when Focus Features expands “Bugonia” nationwide next weekend.\n\n\tOverall, this weekend is down 22% from the same frame in 2024 when Sony’s comic book threequel “Venom: The Last Dance” opened to $51 million. And while domestic year-to-date revenues are hovering 4% above last year, the box office is pacing around 20% below pre-pandemic times, according to Comscore. Attendance is expected to remain on the lighter side until Universal’s musical adaptation “Wicked: For Good” (Nov. 21), Disney’s animated sequel “Zootopia 2” (Nov. 26) and James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” (Dec. 19) land on the big screen.\n\n\t“October has fallen short of last year’s comparable timeframe,” says Comscore’s head of marketplace trends Paul Dergarabedian. “Therefore, patience will be a virtue as the industry awaits the holiday season. Thanksgiving should power solid box office momentum heading into December.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter discovering that a potential “Star Wars” project titled “The Hunt for Ben Solo” was shelved back in 2021, fans are rallying for Disney to reconsider their decision with a new billboard in New York City.\n\n\tDays after “Star Wars” fans paid for a plane to fly a banner reading “Save The Hunt for Ben Solo” over Disney Studios in Burbank, Calif., Collider reported that a billboard popped up at 1500 Broadway, between 43rd and 44th, above Carlo’s Bake Shop. The sign read “For Adam. No one’s ever really gone. Hope lives. Ben is alive! #THBS.” \n\t\n\n\tIn a recent interview with AP, Adam Driver spoke about the development process for “The Hunt for Ben Solo” and working with director Steven Soderbergh. The film would follow Ben Solo on a quest for redemption, shortly after the events of “The Rise of Skywalker.” The screenplay was edited by Soderbergh and “Logan Lucky” screenwriter Rebecca Blunt, later bringing on Scott Z. Burns to pen the script. \n\n\n\t“I always was interested in doing another ‘Star Wars,’” said Driver. “I had been talking about doing another one since 2021. Kathleen [Kennedy] had reached out. I always said: ‘With a great director and a great story, I’d be there in a second.’ I loved that character and loved playing him. It was called ‘The Hunt for Ben Solo,’ and it was really cool. But it is no more, so I can finally talk about it.”\n\n\tDuring the interview, Driver revealed how the script was received and how the project was shut down. “We presented the script to Lucasfilm. They loved the idea. They totally understood our angle and why we were doing it,” Driver said. “We took it to Bob Iger and Alan Bergman and they said no. They didn’t see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that.”\n\t\n\n\tSoderbergh commented on Driver’s reveal on his Bluesky account, confirming the existence of the project. “For the record, I did not enjoy lying about the existence of ‘THE HUNT FOR BEN SOLO,’ but it really did need to remain a secret…until now!”\n\n\t“I really enjoyed making the movie in my head,” added Soderbergh. “I’m just sorry the fans won’t get to see it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBruce Springsteen is one of music’s biggest names, but his global popularity didn’t exactly translate at the box office. \n\n\t“Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,” a musical biopic about the making of his beloved 1982 acoustic solo album “Nebraska,” is falling flat with $7 million at the international box office and $16.1 million globally. Analysts suggest the film is struggling because unlike, say, “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Rocketman,” which were all-encompassing, crowd-pleasing looks at the Queen and Elton John, “Deliver Me From Nowhere” focuses on one, less commercial chapter in Springsteen’s expansive, decade-spanning career. \n\t\n\n\tDisney’s 20th Century Studios is backing the $55 million-budgeted film, which stars Jeremy Allen White as the Boss and was directed by Scott Cooper. Top markets in its debut include the United Kingdom with $1.6 million, Germany with $1 million and Italy with $800,000. “Deliver Me From Nowhere” has yet to open in 20% of overseas territories such as Brazil, Japan and Korea. \n\n\n\tOn international charts, “Springsteen” arrived behind Paramount’s romantic drama “Regretting You.” The PG-13 film, adapted from Colleen Hoover’s best-selling novel, launched with $10 million from 43 markets. The film overperformed in North America with $12.8 million, bringing its three-day global tally to  $22.85 million. “Regretting You,” starring Allison Williams and Mckenna Grace as a mother and daughter who grapple with the aftermath of a devastating accident, is Hoover’s second page-to-screen adaptation following 2024’s surprise hit “It Ends With Us.” Two of the author’s other books, “Verity” and “Reminders of Him,” are the subject of feature films at Amazon MGM and Universal.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, “Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc” continued to dominate at the international box office, adding $14.7 million while expanding to 46 total markets. The R-rated film, a sequel to the popular manga TV series, has been playing in Japan and other Asian countries for weeks and notably just surpassed the $100 million mark. “Chainsaw Man” topped the North American box office this weekend with $17.2 million and has so far earned $108 million worldwide. It’s the second consecutive win for Sony’s Crunchyroll following September’s sleeper hit “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle,” which stands as the highest grossing anime film of all time with $666.8 million globally.\n\n\tIn another milestone, “Black Phone 2” is a commercial winner for Blumhouse after a rough theatrical year for the low-budget horror empire. The scary sequel added $10 million overseas in its second weekend of release, bringing ticket sales to $31.3 million internationally and $80.4 million globally. Universal distributed the film, which cost $30 million. “Black Phone 2″ easily became Blumhouse’s highest-grossing release of the year because its other recent releases — January’s “Wolf Man” ($34 million), March’s “The Woman in the Yard” ($23 million), April’s “Drop” ($28 million), and June’s “M3GAN 2.0” ($39 million ) — flatlined in theaters. This December’s sequel, “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” should also help to restore the company’s fortunes.\n\n\tElsewhere, Disney’s sci-fi tentpole “Tron: Ares” collected $6.3 million from 52 territories in its third weekend in theaters. So far, the big-budget sequel has grossed $60 million overseas and $123.4 million globally, a disappointing tally given its massive $180 million price tag.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGavin Newsom is teasing his presidential bid for the 2028 election.\n\n\tIn an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, the California Governor said he’d “be lying otherwise” if he stated he wasn’t thinking about running for president after his term limit is up in 2027. However, he isn’t 100% set on the idea.\n\n\t“I have no idea,” Newsom said. “The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary. Who the hell knows? I’m looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. That’s the question for the American people.”\n\t\n\n\tTurning his attention to the midterms, Newsom said that Democrats winning back the House in 2026 is crucial to restoring a “rebalanced system.” He also fears that if Mike Johnson remains Speaker of the House, Republicans may try to push for “a third term of President Trump.”\n\n\n\t“[Trump’s] presidency, de facto, ends next November, if we’re successful. If we, the people, are successful in taking back the House,” Newsom said. “His presidency is over, de facto as we know it today, fire and fury signifying maybe something. But finally, you have rebalanced this system.”\n\n\tAnother prominent Democrat, former Vice President Kamala Harris, also recently spoke about her future aspirations. She told BBC‘s “Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg” of working in politics, “I am not done. I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it’s in my bones.”\n",

    "description": "\n\t“Interview With the Vampire,” the opening salvo of AMC’s attempt to turn the oeuvre of fantasy author Anne Rice into a so-called Immortal Universe o",
    "body": "\n\t“Interview With the Vampire,” the opening salvo of AMC’s attempt to turn the oeuvre of fantasy author Anne Rice into a so-called Immortal Universe of television shows, is one of the best shows on air. Smart, sensual and frequently funny, “Interview” manages the balancing act of all great adaptations in both preserving and updating its source material; I ecstatically await a Season 3 styled as a rock documentary about the vampire Lestat (Sam Reid). \n\t\n\n\tThis master plan’s sophomore effort, “Mayfair Witches,” has been a relative letdown. The  scattered drama lacks the passion and eccentricity that are the, well, lifeblood of “Interview With the Vampire.” Nor does the starring vehicle for Alexandra Daddario offer a concise, specific take to differentiate itself from Rice’s original — its own version of making Louis de Pointe du Lac (Jacob Anderson) a Black man who falls in love with his maker. A second season came and went earlier this year with minimal fanfare.\n\n\n\tThe third Immortal Universe show, “Anne Rice’s Talamasca: The Secret Order” — which we will refer to from here on out as “Talamasca,” because let’s not be ridiculous — sadly hews closer to “Mayfair” than “Interview” in quality. The six-episode season, which was provided to critics in its entirety, is a disjointed and muddled attempt to turn Rice’s centuries-old secret society into a vehicle for a half-hearted spy thriller. The premiere has a couple bright spots in the form of cameos from “Interview” star Eric Bogosian and, in a confusing but welcome appearance, Jason Schwartzman as a vampire who lives in the penthouse of the Dakota. (Maybe he’s a big Rice fan, if not enough of one to stick around past a single episode.) Once these training wheels come off, though, “Talamasca” never achieves the momentum to chart its own path.\n\t\n\n\tWhat is the Talamasca, exactly, and what do its members do? Answering these questions would seem to be a basic prerequisite of a show named after the fictional group, but “Talamasca” will leave viewers mostly in the dark. Creator John Lee Hancock (“The Blind Side”) and co-showrunner Mark Lafferty (“Halt and Catch Fire”) position protagonist Guy (Nicholas Denton) as a classic audience surrogate, speed-running a chosen one narrative as the telepath is recruited by mysterious Brit Helen (Elizabeth McGovern, channeling her “Downton Abbey” co-stars) to join the Talamasca in lieu of starting a lucrative law job. Where Guy’s abilities come from and how they fit into this world’s cosmology are never fully explained. Supposedly, the Talamasca are a mortal-led counterweight to paranormal forces like vampires and witches, but they clearly have some supernatural tools of their own.\n\n\tGuy himself proves as generic a hero as his name. Denton, an Australian who could be cousins with Eddie Redmayne, struggles with his American accent even after his character gets shipped off to London to check in on a Talamasca “mother house” when another operative turns up dead. His training is supposed to take a year, but gets crammed into a week because time is of the essence — a compression that reads like a metaphor for this overstuffed, rushed-feeling season. Guy gets little motivation or personality besides the search for his mother, a fellow telepath he grew up in foster care believing to be dead. It turns out the Talamasca was behind not just his placement with a Florida family, but the scholarships that afforded him an elite education.\n\n\tAs if the Talamasca’s deep pockets and connections weren’t shady enough, Guy keeps getting standard-issue warnings about how “they’re lying to you” and “they can’t be trusted.” These flags come from a slew of secondary characters who abruptly rise and fade in significance as Guy tries to figure out where his loyalties should lie. The constantly shifting allegiances are meant to form a twisty yarn in the aggregate, though the effect is largely just confusing — especially when Helen gets a subplot investigating her own past that distracts from her role as the chilly, withholding boss. \n\t\n\n\tThe throughline here is a hunt for a MacGuffin known as the 752, named for the year of the Talamasca’s founding. It’s the backup of an archive that burned 50 years ago in a fire at the organization’s Amsterdam outpost, and Helen is hot on its trail at the same time as Jasper (William Fichtner), a vampire with an axe to grind against the Talamasca. Fichtner is alone in the cast in giving a performance with the flair Rice’s prose deserves, perhaps because only Jasper gets nonsensical-yet-hilarious lines like “You are a flea bouncing off the hard dick of our immortal history!” But Jasper is outnumbered by perfunctory elements like the 752, Guy’s mother and Helen’s own long-lost family, none of which successfully infuse a sense of urgency.\n\n\tWith “Talamasca,” the underwhelming entries in the Immortal Universe now outnumber the exciting ones. Though “Talamasca” ends with enough balls in the air that a Season 2 seems assured, no additional concepts have been ordered to series. Before that happens, some introspection might be in order as to why neither “Mayfair” nor “Talamasca” has measured up to the operatic thrills of “Interview.” Until then, fans will just have to wait for “The Vampire Lestat.”\n\n\t“Anne Rice’s Talamasca: The Secret Order” will premiere with two episodes on AMC and AMC+ on Oct. 26 at 9 p.m. ET.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe editorial board of the Washington Post, owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, expressed approval of President Donald Trump‘s “aggressive” move to tear down the White House‘s East Wing in order to erect a massive ballroom funded by private corporations — including Amazon.\n\n\t“Strong leaders reject calcification,” the Washington Post editorial board said in the op-ed, titled “In defense of the White House ballroom,” published Saturday.\n\t\n\n\t“Many see the rubble [of the East Wing] as a metaphor for President Donald Trump’s reckless disregard of norms and the rule of law,” the Post’s editorial said. But others “see what they love about Trump: A lifelong builder boldly pursuing a grand vision, a change agent unafraid to decisively take on the status quo and a developer slashing through red tape that would stymie any normal politician.”\n\n\n\t“In classic Trump fashion, the president is pursuing a reasonable idea in the most jarring manner possible,” the Post editorial said. The piece claimed that privately, “many alumni of the Biden and Obama White Houses acknowledge the long-overdue need for an event space like what Trump is creating. It is absurd that tents need to be erected on the South Lawn for state dinners, and VIPs are forced to use porta-potties.”\n\n\tBezos, currently executive chairman of Amazon, bought the Washington Post in 2013 and owns it in his personal capacity. He has recently made several changes to the legendary paper, including overhauling the Post’s opinion section earlier this year to focus on “personal liberties and free markets” rather than “broad-based” issues. After Washington Post editorial opinion page editor David Shipley resigned following Bezos’ decision, the paper in June appointed Adam O’Neal, a former correspondent for the Economist and an opinion writer for the Wall Street Journal, as opinion editor.\n\t\n\n\tTrump’s planned gold-gilded ballroom, to be built where the East Wing once stood, will cost an estimated $300 million. Amazon is one of the donors to the project, according to the White House. \n\n\tThe Post’s editorial acknowledged that “the fundraising for the ballroom creates problematic conflicts of interest,” but it did not identify Amazon as among the donors. \n\n\tAfter raising those ethical issues without additional discussion, the Washington Post’s editorial board said in the piece that “Trump’s aggressive approach” is “justified.” The op-ed cited two examples: a yearslong delay in getting approvals for improving White House perimeter fencing after a 2014 incident in which a fence-jumper made his way inside the White House; and an even longer approval process for the erection of the “modest” Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial near the National Air and Space Museum.\n\n\tOther corporate donors to Trump’s new ballroom include Comcast, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and T-Mobile. Google also is listed as a donor; Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, agreed to pay Trump $22 million as part of settling the president’s lawsuit alleging “censorship” over YouTube’s suspension of his account for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. According to court documents, Trump directed the $22 million go toward the construction of the new White House ballroom.\n\n\tIn its Oct. 25 editorial, the Post said, “Preservationists express horror that Trump did not submit his plans to their scrutiny, but the truth is that this project would not have gotten done, certainly not during his term, if the president had gone through the traditional review process. The blueprints would have faced death by a thousand papercuts.”\n\n\t“The White House cannot simply be a museum to the past,” the Post editorial concluded. “Like America, it must evolve with the times to maintain its greatness. Strong leaders reject calcification. In that way, Trump’s undertaking is a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere.”\n\n\tTrump’s teardown of the East Wing included the demolition of the White House’s 42-seat movie theater, which FDR installed in 1942. Over the years, the theater was home to President Barack Obama’s screenings with the casts and crews of “Lincoln” and “Selma”; Richard Nixon’s viewing of “Patton” the night before the Cambodia invasion; JFK’s second screening of “From Russia With Love” the day before he was assassinated in Dallas; and Jimmy Carter’s screening of “Apocalypse Now,” attended by Francis Ford Coppola, prior to the movie’s premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, according to the New York Times.\n\t\n\n\tTrump himself once watched “one of his favorite movies,” Billy Wilder’s 1950 classic “Sunset Boulevard,” in the East Wing theater, per the Times.\n\n\tPictured above: An excavator works to clear rubble after the East Wing of the White House was demolished on Oct. 23, 2025, in Washington, DC..\n",

    "description": "\n\tOut of the many thousands — surely tens of thousands — of albums I’ve listened to in my time, I can’t recall one that had me on the edge of my seat ",
    "body": "\n\tOut of the many thousands — surely tens of thousands — of albums I’ve listened to in my time, I can’t recall one that had me on the edge of my seat from the first moments to the last on first listen the way Lily Allen’s new “West End Girl” did, almost as if it were a suspense movie. The tension doesn’t come in wondering about where the record’s narrative is ultimately headed; as you may have heard, this is a divorce record with a capital D. My inability to sit back in my chair came from just savoring every confessional line and wondering what the hell she was going to tell us in the next one to top it. It’s the pleasure of listening to a master storyteller who makes your jaw drop by seeming to have spilled all the tea almost at the outset, and then the tea just keeps on coming. Not since Boston in 1773, maybe, has anyone dumped it this massively, or this fulfillingly.\n\t\n\n\tIf that sounds a little hyperbolic, well, sure. But “West End Girl” is the kind of record that can inspire crazy superlatives. It’s not solely about the candor — although if all Allen did was read like-minded passages of her diary aloud, you’d still have to give the album some points. It’s not just what she says from moment to moment but how she says it that keeps you riveted. And that applies on fifth, sixth and seventh listen, too, however well you’ve absorbed the story beats. The level of pop craftsmanship remains superb throughout, too, in 14 songs that somehow manage to keep the emotions feeling utterly raw at every turn, even as the music itself is anything but.\n\t\n\n\tSo: Come for the shock value, and stay for the high level of craftsmanship. Then stay even longer for how cannily the album sustains its mix of droll delivery and pure heartbreak. It’s a place you’ll probably want to linger.\n\n\tThere have been a lot of powerful divorce albums in recent years: Already in 2025, we had Jason Isbell’s and Amanda Shires’ both-sides-now releases, plus Maren Morris’ roman-a-clef set. Going back further, we’ve had Adele’s “30,” Kacey Musgraves’ “Star Crossed” and the Chicks’ “Gaslighter,” and the divorce-court near-miss that was Beyonce’s “Lemonade,” not to mention non-marital laments like Taylor Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department.” What all those albums had in common was how those artists offered at least occasional time-outs from the trauma. Usually the artist will feel obligated to give the audience a breather with at least a couple songs that deal with something other than the central rupture, or which flash forward to assure everyone that the singer is doing all right and healing up, thank you, post-split.\n\n\tBut there will be no such commercial breaks or reassurances about time’s healing power for Allen. These 14 songs never offer the slightest relief from the intense emotionality of the breakdown of her relationship. But they’re so uniformly good, the fact that she doesn’t stray for a second from the subject of straying and its effects, but holds onto it like a dog with a bone, is… well, it’s a relief, actually. Allen has been working as a stage actress lately, on London’s West End (hence the title), and listening to the album one fell swoop at a time is like immersing yourself in a terrific one-woman show, where she’s running through the demise of a dream marriage in something that feels like real time. If you’re not riveted by all of this, you may not even be rivet-able.\n\n\tReleased with only a few days’ warning, “West End Girl” has already prompted scores of headlines in the U.K., where Allen remains a paparazzi-attracting A-lister, and just a few less in the U.S., where she is revered by most of the pop intellgentsia but has been known to walk down the street unaccosted. It doesn’t hurt, as far as intense public curiosity goes, that she was just divorced from “Stranger Things” actor David Harbour, after five years of marriage that apparently started as a fairy-tale romance for her and ended in the devastation strewn throughout every track on the album. We say “apparently” because Allen did suggest in a British Vogue interview that there’s at least a little fiction mixed in with the blatant autobiography. But every lyrical detail is so vividly delineated — in a “she probably wouldn’t make this up” way — that, rightly or wrongly, you’re likely to walk away thinking that possibly the only thing fabricated from whole cloth is the pseudonym she came up with for the story’s principal mistress (“Madeline”).\n\t\n\n\tThe album gets off to a blithe enough start… for a couple of verses. The title track is styled initially as a kind of samba, with Allen breathlessly reeling off how she and her husband moved to a brownstone in New York: “Found ourselves a good mortgage / Billy Cotton got sorted.” (Cotton is the designer who made the couple’s new digs worthy of a much-talked-about home-tour profile in Architectural Digest in 2023.) All is bliss until Allen tells her husband in the tune that she had just landed a leading role in a London play, presumably referencing her award-nominated breakout role in “2:22 – A Ghost Story.” (She subsequently starred on the West End again this year, in “Hedda.”) “That’s when your demeanour started to change,” she sings. “You said I’d have to audition / I said, ‘You’re deranged’ / And I thought that that was quite strange.” And there, two minutes in, with 42 left to go, end the sum total of the album’s sunny moments. Halfway through this title track, the music suddenly changes, turning to a creepily underwater-sounding version of that electro-samba, as the backdrop to a phone call we hear only Allen’s side of, in which her partner delivers some unknown bad news from the other side of the pond. It’s up to the listener to imagine what’s being said on the other end of the line: Is he telling her he’s moving out for good? Or just moving to another state, or getting his own flat in town (all of which will factor in in songs that come later)? All she can think of to say back is a dumbstuck “It makes me really sad but… I’m fine, I just want you to be happy… I love you.” And with that, the dream is over. Even though the album is just getting started.\n\n\tShe saves the discovery of infidelity for track 2, “Ruminating” (and practically every track thereafter). This one is a delectable slice of hyperpop, paced to keep up with the racing thoughts that keep our heroine awake at 4 a.m.: “I’m not hateful but you make me hate her / She gets to sleep next to my medicator… / And I can’t shake the image of her naked / On top of you, and I’m disassociated.” She repeats a statement of her partner’s — “If it (casual sex) has to happen, baby, do you want to know?” —answering back, ad nauseum, “What a fucking line, line, line,” repeated endlessly in a lovely, profane, Autotune-enhanced vocal cascade.\n\t\n\n\t“Sleepwalking” brings some sweetness back to the album, but only in the ironic music, which uses the cadences of a sweet girl-group ballad from the ‘50s or early ‘60s top underscore a bitter lyric that says: “Who said romance isn’t dead? / Been no romance since we wed / ‘Why aren’t we fucking baby?’ / Yeah, that’s what you said / But you let me think it was me in my head / And nothing to do with them girls in your bed.” Allen says she’s become the madonna in her marriage when she’d eagerly play whore, if only. (Freud’s interpolation there goes uncredited.)\n\n\tIn “Tennis,” deceptively cheerful couplets that are divided up by light banging on a single piano key, she sings about how his abrupt grabbing back of his phone caused her to take a look at his texts, revealing that he’s been exchanging volleys on the court with a mystery woman, which in her mind may count as the more unforgivable infidelity: “If it was just sex, I wouldn’t be jealous / (But) you won’t play with me,” she sings — and then the music drops out for a blunt spoken-word inquiry: “And who’s Madeline?” (Soon to be drolly repeated and amended as: “Who the fuck is Madeline?”) In one of the great segues of our time, the next number is actually titled “Madeline,” and it’s there that Allen gathers the moxy to text the pseudonymous woman — and, for our listening pleasure, recites the answers that get texted back to her in an amusinglyu authentic American accent. (Whether she’s quoting real-life texts verbatim or paraphrasing for comedic effect is hard to know, but the end result is a dialogue that feels satirical and real at the same time.)\n\n\tIt’s so easy to become wrapped up in what’s actually being sung and said in “Madeline” that you might miss what’s happening musically, on first listen. The instrumental bed for this track focuses on a kind of acoustic guitar strumming that feels faintly redolent of a Marty Robbins ballad about Western gunslingers in a showdown — and yeah, that does become a bit more obvious when a couple of actual gunshot sound effects are eventually thrown into the mix.\n\n\tIt’s not the only time stylistic pastiche is employed for humor. It happens again, for instance, in “Dallas Major,” a song about Allen reentering the dating scene against her better judgment. That one brings in a light R&B groove that is meant to confer a surface sexiness, even as Allen warns a possible suitor, “I’m almost nearly 40 / I’m just shy of five-foot-two / I’m a mum to teenage children / Does that sound like fun to you?” Well, it does, kind of, but only because primary producer Blue May and his cohorts are adding bits of funk guitar, ‘70s-style keyboards and even some ‘80s-style scratching, while Allen conversely laments, over and over: “I hate it here.” If you don’t notice all these fairly subtle arrangement touchs on the first couple of listens, it’s understandable — you are busy being hit by a 2-by-4, which is to say, the accumulative effect of Allen’s jaw-dropper divulgements.\n\t\n\n\tIn “Madeline,” the “it’s complicated” part of the story really starts to take effect. There we learn the rules of the game of the marriage: It’s an open one, but Allen posits that she’s only agreeing to that to keep the embers of her former fairy-tale union alive. It’s here that she may lose some listeners who would otherwise be down to empathize with a straightforward divorce album: If you agreed to an open marriage, why are you so outraged he had sex with other women? The singer establishes there were boundaries set: “We had an arrangement / Be discreet, and don’t be blatant / There had to be payment / It had to be with strangers… [Dramatic pause.] But you’re not a stranger, Madeline.”\n\n\tThe magnitude of the extramarital exploits is stressed in an unforgettable sing-along that soon follows, “Pussy Palace.” In this one, the narrator goes to drop off medication at the West Village apartment her husband is keeping on his own, to discover a shoebox of love letters from serial lovers and a “Duane Reade bag with the handles tied / Sex toys, butt plugs, lube inside / Hundreds of Trojans, you’re so fucking broken / How’d I get caught up in your double life?” If that sounds stressful, know that the chorus is actually the kind of earworm you may spend the fall singing out loud — “I didn’t know it was your pussy palace (x4) / I always thought it was a dojo (x3) / So am I looking at a sex addict (x4)?” (It’s pretty much guaranteed, by the way, that with this album Merriam-Webster look-ups on dojo just went up 10,000%.)\n\n\tThe musical dynamics of the record are fairly spectacular. At its tenderest, there is “Just Enough,” a ballad with finger-picking guitar and orchestra that has Allen caught up in seeing herself as a hag: “Look at my reflection / I feel so drawn, so old / I booked myself a facelift / Wondering how long it might hold / I gave you all my power / How I’m seen through your eyes…” It’s one of the few songs on the album that is universal enough that many women will presumably relate — although, again, she can’t resist bringing it home to some triggering specifics when she asks aloud: “Why are we here talking about vasectomies?”\n\n\tContrast that with the wildly up-tempo tune that immediately precedes it, “Nonmonogamummy.” (Best tongue-twister of a title for a great pop song since “Femininomenon.”) In this one, Allen has reluctantly given in to keeping her side of the marriage open and is working the apps herself, in frustration. Her date for the evening is a British DJ named Specialist Moss, who raps, “I look at your eyes, you say your heart is broken,” while Allen can’t stop thinking about her husband: “I don’t want to fuck with anyone else / I know that’s all you want to do / I’m so committed that I’d lose myself / Because I don’t want to lose you.” The date goes badly, but the song goes spectacularly. An irresistible electric guitar line and an unbeatably furious beat help Allen and Blue May make “Nonmonogamummy” into what may be the most brilliant banger of the year.\n\t\n\n\tMuch respect, also, for “Relapse,” in which Allen, who is apparently about five years sober, writes about how the breakdown of her personal life and dreams is driving her to want to drink, or drug — but expresses this hunger not as some kind of slog but as a delicious piece of dubstep.\n\n\tFor an album that proceeds quite deliberately as a narrative, “West End Girl” doesn’t have a terribly definitive wrap-up. In the finale, “Fruityloop” (seemingly named for her ex’s choice of cereal, as well as the snare-drum loop that underlies the track), Allen brings the fatal attraction down to unresolved parental-neglect issues: “You’re just a little boy, looking for his mummy… / Playing with his toys, he just wants attention / He can’t really do attachment, scared he’s gonna be abandoned.” For herself, “I’m just a little girl, looking for a daddy / Thought that we could break the cycle.” If that sounds like pretty reasonable, even high-minded after all that has preceded it, rest assured that Allen is not quite done with the tough talk yet. “You’re a mess, I’m a bitch,” she proclaims. Magnanimous, sort of, but then she can’t help finally quoting the sage that was Lily Allen, circa 2008: “It’s not me, it’s you.”\n\n\tIf her deep woundedness comes as a bit of a surprise on this album, it may be because cockier older songs like “F— You” gave her the image of a tough broad, or because she already had one divorce album, 2017’s “No Shame,” in which she seemed to take a lot of responsibility for her first marriage’s failure. So among the many things that feel shocking here is just how submissive she seems to her mate’s will and wishes, up to a breaking point. The picture painted is of a wife who’s a true lovestruck romantic, and maybe even,  aspirationally, a tradwife. There’s an interesting contrast here, between the Allen who might be seen by some as a ball-buster for how candidly she’s laying out her anger for the world to see here, and the Lily who is — like a globetrotting woman before her — just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. (Even for a while after she’s learned what minefields his phone and his Duane Reade bag are.) For all of the avenging spirit that animates a good part of this album, it’s tremendously touching, when she’s not turning up the pyro. Or even when she is.\n\t\n\n\tFor now, it’s enough that we have her back with an album-of-the-year contender. (Extra kudos to Blue May, who is not really a famous name among producers yet, but is probably about to become one, based on this.) But is this the beginning of a renaissance — a Lily-sance? — after she spent eight years off the recording scene? It’s not as if whole generations of women haven’t followed in the footsteps she set down more than 20 years ago, yet it still feels like we need her now more than ever. \n\n\tAllen has said she was indeed recording prolifically in the lead-up to the domestic drama detailed here, but not releasing those tracks because she felt she was writing too impersonally, putting down her thoughts about the internet and stuff like that. You’d hate to think it would take this much trauma for her to follow up with another great album. (Here’s betting those unreleased songs about the worldwide web are not as bad as she thinks they are, right?) Anyway, we are just a world, standing in front of a girl, asking her to make more records.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGus Van Sant is still moving. \n\n\t“I think a lot of the films I’ve made, even unintentionally, have been based on real things,” Van Sant says with his familiar mix of understatement and curiosity. “That’s a genre, I guess. I’ve always been drawn to what makes people do what they do.”\n\n\tIn “Dead Man’s Wire,” Van Sant’s latest film, which premiered at AFI Film Festival on Saturday, that fascination becomes electrified — literally. The historical true-crime drama, based on the real-life 1977 Tony Kiritsis hostage case, unfolds like a pressure cooker between desperation and spectacle.\n\t\n\n\t“When I read the script,” he recalls, “there were links embedded in it — you could click them and hear the real 911 calls. Tony talked so fast, like Scorsese on a cocaine bender, cracking jokes and losing his temper. I thought, ‘This is an amazing character.’”\n\n\n\tVan Sant’s words carry a quiet thrill, the sound of an auteur who has spent a career balancing empathy and danger. From “Drugstore Cowboy” and “My Own Private Idaho” to the Oscar-nominated “Good Will Hunting” and “Milk,” he’s never chased a single genre; only human behavior.\n\n\t“The story had this weird barnstormer energy,” he shares. “We were meeting in the Soho House, and the producer said, ‘We have to start shooting in Louisville in two months.’ That was the most appealing thing — just hitting the road like Huckleberry Finn.”\n\n\tNow 73, Van Sant is nostalgic when talking about creative chaos. “The best thing about film is still the accident,” he says. “River Phoenix used to love when something unexpected happened on set. He’d come alive inside those moments — he could feel his character reacting in real time.”\n\t\n\n\tThat memory lingers, as does the one of the fog machines at the 1998 Oscars that made him physically ill while “Good Will Hunting” (1997) lost most of its awards to “Titanic.”\n\n\t“I’m allergic to stage fog now,” he says with a chuckle. “So I never use it on set.”\n\n\tIt’s been seven years since his last theatrical film (“Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot”), but Van Sant is back with a story that echoes his fascination with real American tragedy and absurdity — a director drawn, as ever, to the ragged edge between empathy and obsession.\n\n\tWith “Dead Man’s Wire,” Van Sant delivers his most arresting and charged work since “Milk.” The film hums with the restless energy that defined his early 1970s-like masterpieces while showcasing a sharpened maturity in tone and control. Skarsgård gives a career-best performance, grounding Tony Kiritsis’ volatility with flashes of humor and heartbreak, while Dacre Montgomery and Colman Domingo deliver richly textured performances. Dark horses for the Oscars? Of course. But that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be considered. In particular, Van Sant’s direction is at once intimate and explosive, framing the chaos with empathy, allowing the audience to feel the pulse of desperation behind every decision. The film’s screenplay, adapted from real events by first-time screenwriter Austin Kolodney, is infused with humanism and dark wit, standing as one of the year’s finest.\n\n\tIn a wide-ranging interview with Variety, Van Sant talks about his past, present and future in the industry he’s spent over four decades mastering.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Dead Man’s Wire”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStefania Rosini SMPSP\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLooking at your filmography, this fits with your interest in real-life characters and crimes.\t\n\n\tYeah, I think so. A lot of my films, even the fictional ones, are based on something from the real world — a news story or an article. “Drugstore Cowboy,” “Elephant,” and “Last Days” all came from that impulse. It’s not “true crime” like television, but it’s about what makes someone act a certain way — that question inside the crime.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you settle on Bill Skarsgård for Tony and Dacre Montgomery for Richard?\t\n\n\tCasting was probably as important as the script. I was at a spa one weekend, listening to ambient music, trying to decide if I should jump into this project immediately — we had to start shooting in November. I’d always wanted to work with Bill. I’d offered him roles before that didn’t happen. He has this fascinating career — horror films, yes, but he’s like Lon Chaney, the man of a thousand faces. He’s also 10 years younger than the real Tony, which made it interesting.\n\t\n\n\tDacre I knew because of his audition tape for “Stranger Things.” It’s one of those legendary tapes actors pass around — perfect lighting, perfect eyelines. I didn’t even watch the show at first, just his scenes. He felt new, unpredictable, and that was what the movie needed.\n\t\n\t\tAnd Colman Domingo as the radio DJ — it’s such an inspired choice.\t\n\n\tWe actually modeled that character after the DJ in “The Warriors.” That was in the script. We had a few actors pass before Colman came aboard. He was working with our producer, Cassian Elwes, on another project and said, “I’d love to work with Gus.” He was perfect — his presence grounds the film.\n\t\n\t\tFans always ask if you’d ever revisit “Drugstore Cowboy.”\t\n\n\tActually, there are screenplays that the same writer wrote — James Fogle. There were four different ones, and one of them is called “Satan’s Sandbox,” that I think James Franco wanted to do, but that was the one I kind of preferred. It’s set in San Quentin prison. And actually, when we met him and made the movie, he was in Walla Walla State Penitentiary in Washington State, and so he had some stories when they were out of prison, like “Drugstore Cowboy,” when they were running around, selling drugs and stealing drugs. So there are other ones, yeah, there are other ones that exist.\n\t\n\t\tRiver Phoenix was so prolific in your cinema journey. He definitely is one of the core reasons I, myself, fell in love with movies. How often does he cross your mind?\t\n\n\tI mean, I think about him all the time — there’s a picture on the wall of him. He was sort of like, you know, a very great collaborator. And we only did that one piece, and we were planning on — he was planning on being in what turned out to be “Milk.” But that didn’t happen till later, before he died, so there was a project that we were talking about. But, yeah, he was very spontaneous. He loved to improvise. That was his favorite thing. And I don’t think he got to, necessarily, depending on who he was working with, go off the page and improvise. It probably wasn’t the type of films that he was doing — he was doing traditional pieces that were pretty much, like, securely in Hollywood. You know, he was doing traditional pieces, that’s what he was offered.\n\t\n\n\tAnd in that environment, you’re not making a film like — you know, like you’re mentioning Scorsese — where they improvise whole scenes. And when we did, he found out that I liked it, you know, that I was okay if he just did something for like five minutes that wasn’t even in the screenplay, because then he could actually research stuff, and he could feel very open about what he was playing. So that was kind of magical, that he liked it, and he had not been able to do it. So he was very excited about it, because he wasn’t normally doing it.\n\n\tI don’t know, there’s lots of things. His upbringing was such that he didn’t really have a lot of film history connected to his memory banks. He was homeschooled, so he didn’t have a lot of teaching that he knew about concerning war. His homeschooling consisted of, like, no war. So characters like General MacArthur weren’t in his world — he didn’t know who they were. And then conversely, he didn’t know what humor was. He didn’t know what, like, a quote-unquote joke was, until he was nine, he said.\n\n\tHe found that out because he went to a traditional school — a public school — and kids were telling jokes. It was an era when kids were all about jokes. He didn’t know what they were; they were just like a foreign thing to him. He also didn’t have a smile, which people don’t necessarily know. He told me that — he said, ‘Well, I don’t have a smile.’ And I said, ‘You’re kidding.’ And then he smiled and showed me his smile, and I said, ‘Oh yeah, I don’t see that smile in your films.’\n\n\tSo he had this interesting thing — for a movie star, an interesting absence of that kind of giant smile. But meanwhile, he was very funny, and his most favorite thing was just to laugh and tell stories.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve been nominated twice for an Oscar. What do you remember about those mornings?\t\n\n\tMostly that I didn’t realize when the announcements were happening. I woke up to a bunch of phone calls. It’s the big Hollywood prize — it feels great. At the ceremony for “Good Will Hunting,” they unveiled this huge Titanic ship set, and fog rolled out everywhere. I got so sick sitting there, I swore I’d never use fog on my sets again.\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a lot of talk about the “death” of cinema. Do you believe that?\t\n\n\tNot at all. Movies always follow technology — from nickelodeons to iPhones. What matters is the gathering, that communal experience. The art form isn’t dying; it’s just shifting. The best films of the 1920s were miracles because nobody knew what cinema was yet. We’re in another one of those periods of discovery.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCan we expect another film soon? Or do we have to wait another seven years?\t\n\n\tI hope so. I did the Gucci project and six hours of “Feud,” so I haven’t been idle. There are hundreds of ideas — digital files full of them. Some might take decades, like “Milk” did. But they’re there, waiting.\n",

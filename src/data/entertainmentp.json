    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers for the ending of “Shelby Oaks,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\tSo, who took Riley Brennan?\n\n\tDirector Chris Stuckmann makes his directorial debut with Neon’s horror “Shelby Oaks,” which follows the disappearance of a YouTuber and amateur ghost hunter Riley Brennan (Sarah Durn). Having started his career as a film critic and essayist on YouTube, Stuckmann makes the transition to director with a horror movie that expertly blends media and feels at times like a mockumentary ripped right from the video platform.\n\t\n\n\tCamille Sullivan stars as Mia Brennan, who has been searching for her younger sister Riley after she vanished 12 years ago in the remote town of Shelby Oaks with her YouTube group, the Paranormal Paranoids. The film starts out like a fictional documentary on Riley’s disappearance, but then transforms into a supernatural horror that uses found footage and scripted scares unlike any recent studio movie. It’s like “Blair Witch Project” for the YouTube generation, and Stuckmann uses his years of experience on the platform to maximum effect.\n\n\n\tWith Variety, the director discusses his YouTube origins, shooting on old-school camcorders and that shocking ending.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhy was “Shelby Oaks” the story you wanted to tell with your directorial debut?\t\n\n\tI didn’t want to give any producers that I met a chance to turn me down, so I wrote probably like six or seven spec scripts and I went to film festivals and met so many different filmmakers and spent a lot of time trying to meet people and network and get to a place where I could make a connection with someone. It finally helped me get a movie off the ground, because I had been trying for so long. I didn’t want to go into these situations with one script and pitch. So I went into a lot of these film festivals hoping to meet producers with a lot of scripts and pitches. When I bumped into Aaron Koontz at Fantastic Fest in 2019, I had two or three different things I could have pitched him at the time, and “Shelby Oaks” was the one that caught his attention. From there, it became a process of developing it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI’m from the Midwest, but I’d never heard of Darke County in Ohio before. How did you choose that as your setting?\t\n\n\tI was trying to think of a general area in Ohio to set it in. Obviously Shelby Oaks is fictional, but as soon as I discovered the name “Darke” and it has an E, which makes it feel more artsy and it’s farm country, it’s literally exactly what I want. I’ve taken a bit of a “Castle Rock” approach because a lot of my spec scripts take place in Darke County, this little mini cinematic universe that may or may not happen one day.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you blend the mix of mockumentary footage, YouTube found footage and scripted horror?\t\n\n\tBeing on YouTube since 2009, there is a phenomena that I have witnessed over the years: People like to watch people watch things. Reacting videos are a very, very popular trend. There is something very inviting about the idea of seeing a person take in information. There’s this sequence with Mia where she watches the tape, and you’re kind of there with her feeling her emotions. She’s your conduit for these emotions. I really love the idea of mixing media, because I feel like that’s how we all live now. We all pop on TikTok, YouTube, TV, movies, audio books, physical books, there’s no set thing for all of us. We all experience media in different ways.\n\t\n\t\tWas there ever a version of this that was a full mockumentary version?\t\n\n\tIt started out completely mockumentary. The very first pitch that we ever had was that, out of necessity. My first idea for this movie was that I would self-finance it for like $20,000 and put it on YouTube, because I was tired of waiting. Eventually the ideas kept evolving and kept coming. As I was writing, I couldn’t stop it. It was this whole thing, and now I had to figure out where this goes. The way it came to me was that every time you watch a mockumentary that’s fictional, you know it’s fictional. You’re in on the joke. I understand that most of them are made out of a budgetary necessity, but since we’re all in on the joke, why can’t we have some fun with this? We have cameras that the actors are aware of, why can’t we also have cameras they’re not aware of and just play in that world?\n\t\n\t\tSome of the found-footage jump scares feel like throwbacks to the early days of scary YouTube videos, like the “Relaxing Car Drive” video that I’m sure many people have stumbled upon. How did you make these retro, proto-internet scares?\t\n\n\tI do think it does have something to do with YouTube, the internet and the creepypasta generation. We all look for ways to describe how art makes us feel through past pieces of art. We always try to find a way to connect. But we’re in this generational shift now where filmmakers are starting to come out of the early YouTube years. Not all the inspiration is coming from film or TV anymore. A lot of it is coming from the internet. Like you mentioned that relaxing car video, I remember watching that back in the day and the thing pops up at the end and I’m falling back in my seat. We weren’t used to being scared by the internet yet. The internet was still kind of a remotely safe place. There wasn’t social media yet. When things on the internet started to scare us, it’s a whole new world of potential horror that can be mined. The mixed media element was very important to me to present different types of scares. The found-footage scare is very different from the traditional narrative scare, not just in visual presentation, but in sound. In the traditional narrative portion of the film, we really opened up the sound channels and explored so many more possibilities of what we could do with sound. In the the earlier portions of the movie, we tried to restrict ourselves a little bit more to the types of sounds that would come from an old-school camcorder. In those Paranormal Paranoids episodes, I shot all those myself with gear from pre-2008. The camcorder was from 2006. The microphone we used was from 2007. We didn’t allow ourselves to have things they wouldn’t have had.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDid you always imagine the ending as a bleak punch to the gut? How much of it did you want to leave open to interpretation for fans?\t\n\n\tYes, there was never any question for me. All of my favorite horror films tend to have an ending that sticks with you. Obviously, when you’re trying to get your script seen, there are going to be people who make requests, especially some of the less risk-taking producers. I was always very adamant that this has got to be the way it is. When I think about all my favorite horrors, they’re very rarely warm and fuzzy at the end.\n\n\tIf you want to look at just the emotion of it, when something happens to you when you’re younger that leaves a scar or some kind of trauma that it sticks with you, you could view that literally as a crack in a window. If you don’t fix it or get and try to better your life, you just let it sit there and fester and grow and spider-web into something worse, eventually it will probably eat you alive. That’s been the emotional idea behind this thing that has always been looming in the background of Riley and Mia’s life that is also literally represented by this window in the conclusion of the movie. It’s all in there, and there’s a lot of hidden stuff too in various shots.\n\t\n\t\tThere are so many filmmakers, like Danny and Michael Philippou and Curry Barker, who are getting Hollywood deals after starting out on YouTube. How does it feel to see them grow after starting out online? \t\n\n\tI think it’s absolutely wonderful. I’ve talked with Danny and Mike, and I had Danny and Curry on my podcast. When I started my YouTube channel in 2009, it took about six years before I even was able to get press tickets to movies at advanced screenings. That’s because at that time, YouTube as a platform was not taken seriously by Hollywood. If you said you were a YouTube film critic, they’d be like, ‘Cool. Have a nice day.’ Now, when you go to a premiere, what do you see everywhere? YouTubers and TikTokers. Hollywood has had to take the platforms seriously. I think it’s the same with film. There is a new generation of people in their 30s or late 20s who are coming up and started on Vine, TikTok and YouTube. Now they’re getting a chance to make movies, because that is the progression of time that we’re in. If YouTube existed in the ’70s or ’80s, I guarantee Scorsese, Spielberg, Robert Rodriguez, all those guys, would have been uploading.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Gabe Polsky pitched his latest documentary, “The Man Who Saves the World?”  to the major streamers, they weren’t interested.\n\n\t“I made a sizzle and took it to all the usual suspects,” Polsky says. “For them, it felt like it was just too far out.”\n\n\tRevolving around Patrick McCollum, a 75-year-old eccentric peace activist who believes he has been chosen by an ancient prophecy to help unite the Indigenous tribes of South America to save the Amazon and the planet from environmental ruin, the 85-minute film is undeniably surreal. Even Polsky was initially skeptical of McCollum, a jack-of-all-trades ordained chaplain who, prior to facilitating peace in countries around the world, served as a prison chaplain to both Charles Manson and the Menendez brothers and designed jewelry for members of the British royal family.\n\t\n\n\tProducer Doug DeLuca introduced Polsky to McCollum in 2023.\n\n\n\t“Doug knows some wacky people in this world, and he said, ‘Look. I heard this story. It’s really crazy, but I think maybe you should get on the phone and listen and hear this guy out,” Polsky says. “I did, and right away, I was like this guy is crazy.”\n\n\tDespite his initial hesitations, Polsky (“Red Army”) ultimately decided to follow McCollum as he attempted to fulfill the prophecy.\n\n\t“I really had nothing to lose except my time,” Polsky says.\n\n\tThe director appears in the doc and often voices his skepticism, which creates a push-and-pull dynamic between him and McCollum. Just when Polsky is finding it impossible not to feel like he’s part of a lunatic’s sham, Jane Goodall appears.\n\t\n\n\t“I can honestly say Patrick is one of the most extraordinary and inspirational people I have had the good fortune to know and count as a true friend,” Goodall says in the film.\n\n\t“Jane was an absolute game changer,” Polsky says. “I knew that it would be very difficult for this film to work if I didn’t have her because his story’s so unbelievable.”\n\n\tTo say that “The Man Who Saves the World?” is funny is an understatement. It’s a hilarious character study that tackles environmental issues. But despite being that rare doc that combines humor with urgency, Polasky’s inability to find a mainstream distributor has made it hard to find an audience for the film. So, the director asked a few Hollywood heavyweights, including Peter Farrelly, Danny McBride and David Gordon Green, to help get the word out about his doc by signing on as executive producers.\n\n\t“Danny and I were watching cuts and saying, this is awesome. How do we find a home for this doc, knowing that there’s a unique spirit and eccentric quality to it that doesn’t necessarily check the box of your average film festival depressing doc,” says Green. “It’s something different, and that’s what our company ends up just loving to support.”\n\n\tMcBride said that his and Green’s Rough House Pictures, which executive produced the 2023 HBO doc “Telemarketers,” try to champion filmmakers with voices that they believe in.\n\n\t“If weirdly our involvement can help them reach a larger audience, it feels like it’s our duty to participate and lend a hand wherever we can,” says McBride.\n\n\tIn July, Area 23a, the company known for distributing the 2019 doc “Fantastic Fungi,” signed on to do a hybrid, experience based release of “The Man Who Saves the World?” across the country in cities including Portland and Seattle. On Oct. 17, the film kicked off an awards-qualifying theatrical run in Los Angeles. \n\n\t“The documentary is a great journey and it’s hopeful,” says Farrelly. “That is the main reason I wanted to be involved with this film. It’s such a hopeful vision, and that’s what we need right now.”\n\n\t“The Man Who Saves the World?” is now playing in limited release in theaters, starting with New York. The film will expand to additional markets in November with theatrical runs in Chicago and Orlando and major theatrical events in Minneapolis and Charleston.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s Warren Zevon season. That may sound like a funny thing to say, in 2025, or in any year since the legendary rock singer-songwriter died in 2003, given a perennial underdog status that never augured for anything that would be likely to be called a posthumous groundswell, per se. And yet, downtown Los Angeles is about to see two major celebrations of Zevon in less than a month, against all odds. The second will come when he is inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Nov. 8. \n\t\n\n\tBut preceding that this Friday night is the true concentrated dose of Zevon power — a full-on tribute concert involving dozens of singers and dozens more backing musicians taking place at the United Theatre on Broadway. It’s being produced as the annual benefit of the Wild Honey Foundation, which earns plaudits every year for salutes to Buffalo Springfield, the Band, the Beach Boys, the Beatles and so many other classic rock acts that start with a B that it’s a wonder they ever looked to the opposite end of the alphabet. Wild Honey tributes tend to push the three-hour mark, so “Play It All Night Long” may be the operative song of the night — that, or “I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead.”\n\n\n\tThe two key frontpeople of the night may be Jackson Browne and Jorge Calderón, both of whom worked with Zevon from his first album in 1976 and remained close with him until the end — not to mention his son, Jordan Zevon, the night’s most important co-sign. Other participating artists include Dwight Yoakam (who’ll surely be reprising his well-known cover of “Carmelita”), Fountains of Wayne, Shooter Jennings, Marshall Crenshaw, Chris Stills, Steve Wynn and many more. (Veteran L.A. rock writer and Variety contributor Chris Morris will host the evening.)\n\t\n\n\tJordan Zevon is sitting at a rehearsal studio in North Hollywood after running through his chosen songs for Friday’s show. Asked if this tribute is the kind of event he’s been waiting for to honor his dad for the last 20 years or more, he shakes his head.\n\n\t“Quite the opposite,” Zevon demurs. In the past, when much smaller-scale salutes took place, “I kind of avoided them and didn’t  get too involved,” he says.. “I always wished everybody well. But I knew I’d get really picky about it. Even thinking about it gives me chills,” and not the good kind. “What made this exciting for me was that I knew Wild Honey and I’d been to their shows in the past, so I knew this would be one that would just sound really great. And I knew a lot of the people that would be involved, so it made it much more appetizing for, for me to do.” (It helped that one of the musical directors, Jordan Summers (who plays with artists from the Wildflowers to Cat Powers), was his classmate, bandmate and BFF going back to their days as the only two Jordans then attending University High in West L.A.)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCalderón was Zevon’s most regular collaborator, co-writing songs with him ranging from “Veracruz” and “Nighttime in the Switching Yard” on the earliest albums to finally producing and co-writing the singer-songwriter’s swan song, “The Wind,” released a month before his death.\n\n\t“Jackson Browne and myself put together three or four tributes at Largo, before the pandemic,” Calderón recounts, “and they were great because it was a smaller scale. But I hadn’t done one in a long time when Jordan Zevon called me to do it, and I said, ‘You know, I, I don’t want to do this. Leave it to the youngsters to do the songs.’ Immediately I got a phone call from Jackson” — and faster than you can say “Mama Could Be Persuaded,” “he talked me into doing it.”\n\n\tNot everyone stepping up to the mic has a long association. Shooter Jennings would seem to be one of the most qualified acts on the bill: On several occasions in recent years, he has done full-length Zevon tribute shows in different cities, and even released a limited-edition vinyl LP of his Zevon covers. So to hear him admit that he was not super into Zevon until the past decade is somewhat shocking… if a good sign of just how far beyond his death the artist is still picking up wholesale converts who become devoted for life.\n\t\n\n\tAdmits Jennings, “I’m a latecomer to the party, compared to some of these dudes who have been swimming in it for 30, 40 years. I knew his music a little — I even used to sing ‘Carmelita’ with buddies at Molly Malone’s back in the early 2000s, and I loved Drive-by Truckers’ cover of ‘Play It All Night Long,’ and I knew him from seeing him on Letterman. But I hadn’t really done a deep dive until a friend of mine made me sit down and listen to the words of ‘Desperados Under the Eaves.’ And then it kind of made me collapse inward with my lack of knowledge of him. But I definitely, take it very seriously now.” Once he got over the shame, starting around 2018 “l started to go crazy over him and then I spent like the next few years pretty much only listening to him and Linda Ronstadt. It became this period of time where I was just loving the Los Angeles of the ’70s and the bands that were recording here at the time.”\n\n\tLiving in L.A. and thinking about its literary traditions was part of the appeal of adopting Zevon as a favorite, Jennings says. “I mean, his perspective is pretty cold and dark, in moments, and you gotta kinda live and learn , I think, to get that, and to have that sense of humor in a weird way,. There was a point in time in which I felt I was the guy in ‘Desperados Under the Eaves,’ you know? Tthere’s a part of me that believes that he’s like if Bukowski was a musician or something, exploring that kind of hard, ugly truth a lot of the time. I like the guy who was in the gutter and, strung out and, made his way back from it and hates everybody for every reason in the world. That’s the stuff that interests me in life. I’m not interested in the pretty picture as much,” he says, extolling the guy who — beyond his hit “Werewolves of London” — has songs like “Ain’t That Pretty at All” and “Life’ll Kill Ya.”\n\n\tBut Jennings points out that his couth side was very much a match for his wildman side, even before he became renowned as one of the first rockers to go public with his detox experiences in the ’80s. “He wrote this brutal stuff, but then he was armed with the piano, and the stuff had a classical bent to it — these neoclassical arrangements mixed with this kind of folk and almost Beatles-meets-country kind of sensibility musically excited me.”\n\t\n\n\tPaul Rock is the chief driving force behind Wild Honey, having set the org up going back to the ’90s as a chance to gather some of L.A.’s best musicians in tribute to the world’s greatest artists, as a fundraiser for causes related to autism, a condition that has touched his family. (See this Variety story for an account of how his son, Jacob, found a way to co-compose music, despite being non-verbal, and had his own Wild Honey show.) This year, there are two beneficiaries of the proceeds: the Ed Asner Family Center, which is for autism families, and the Asbestos Disease Awareness Foundation, the Zevon family’s charity of choice.\n\n\tRock says putting together the Zevon show was “two years in the process, but maybe another year before that that we thought about it. The Jackson Browne connection is strong and we knew he was Interested in doing it, so that plays a role when you know you can get somebody that’s that passionate and have someone like that to build the show off. Because the only tricky part of this is that it’s just about the first time where we can’t bring the original artist because he’s not alive. We’ve always tried to have a key member of the band.” (Past Wild Honey shows have seen Richie Furay show up for the Buffalo Springfield show, John Sebastian for the Lovin’ Spoonful, Garth Hudson for the Band, Al Jardine and Brian Wilson for the Beach Boys and Dave Davies for the Kinks.)\n\n\t“So to supplement that for this show, we tried to get people that were crucial to his career, in his band live or in the studio. Of course Jackson produced his first two early records, which gives us a lot of authenticity in this one, along with Jorge. Then we got all the session guys like Bob Glaub and Rick Marotta. I think that’s what’s selling the show to the hardcore Zevon fan.” (As of this writing, only a handful of seats were left in the balcony of the United, formerly the Theatre at Ace Hotel, and at least dozens of those tickets are being claimed by fans flying in from around the country.)\n\n\t“I think there’s a real cult of personality there, even with people who are  way too young to have heard him originally. It strikes a chord, the guy who just couldn’t stop himself; the myth of the wild man artist, I think. is pretty strong with him, and with young people, more than you’d think.”\n\t\n\n\tBut the irony with Zevon, as Rock also points out, is that there are fans who have little interest in the artist as anti-hero and just revere him for the songwriting that has resulted in dozens if not hundreds of covers — starting with the woman who first introduced his name to much of America, Ronstadt.\n\n\t“Over the year his songs have continued to be covered songs by people that are somewhat contemporary. So when you’re thinking about who’s gonna play,  you go through everybody who’s covered the songs, you know, and you find their videos on YouTube and know you could ask them, so there’s still a presence there that’s stronger than most of his time. Plus, I think his appearances on Letterman over the years kept it alive” — including the one in 2003 where he revealed he had terminal cancer, where he uttered his famous “Enjoy every sandwich” maxim. “He was on quite a bit, so there’s a whole generation of people who saw him do that.”\n\n\t“The thing about Warren being known as a songwriter, all the way back to Linda, that really makes it  a real easy one for us. When you have someone whose appeal is built mostly around their style or their stage thing or  something that’s very unique to them, as opposed to the songs that have been covered by many people, it’s harder to do a show if people are just sitting there thinking about the qualities of the original artist and what makes them so striking. Warren is obviously a unique personality, but the songs are very universal.”\n\n\tExcept, of course, for when they’re incredibly peculiar. On this particular rehearsal day, Inara George, of the Bird and the Bee, and Eleni Mandell, who sometimes joins George in their side project the Living Sisters, are rehearsing a duet of a song that is about as distinctive as it gets: “Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner,” which starts off as a heavily detailed foreign mercenary story and ends somewhere in the land of Ichabod Crane.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEleni Mandell and Inara George rehearse for the ‘Join Me in L.A.’ Wild Honey tribute to Warren Zevon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChris Willman/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It’s a march,” says George. “It’s a jig,” counters Mandell. “It’s a marching jig,” they collectively decide. With an almost nursery rhyme-like quality, amid the bloodshed. “I actually am really excited about this one,” George said, “because my husband Jake got my kids into Warren Zevon when they were really little and they could sing every word of this song.” (Allegedly, even “Through sixty-six and seven they fought the Congo war / With their fingers on their triggers, knee-deep in gore / For days and nights they battled the Bantu to their knees / They killed to earn their living and to help out the Congolese.” And: “The CIA decided they wanted Roland dead / That son-of-a-bitch Van Owen blew off Roland’s head.”)\n\t\n\n\tThere was a machismo to some of Zevon’s work, clearly, but George finds a different message in “Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner.” “I was listening to it coming over here, and I feel like [the theme is] violence begets violence. It’s not gonna work out, killing people.”\n\n\tThat attention to period detail or geographical specificity very much applied to “Veracruz,” one of the seminal co-writes between Calderón and Zevon, toward the beginning of their three-decade alliance.\n\n\t“Back then in ’78 when he was doing the ‘Excitable Boy’ album, he had started writing the song, and he told me it’s about when Woodrow Wilson sent troops to the port of Veracruz in 1914. He had the first part of the song, but said, ‘I need something because I’m stuck.’ And that was the first one we actually wrote and got recorded. I heard what he had and I came up withthat music and lyrics for the Hispanic part, and that’s how our collaboration started. That song is about the imperialistic government of the U.S. They’re just going somewhere to invade something, and nothing has changed. You know, it’s the same thing. The only thing is that now they send the troops to our cities to mess with us.”\n\n\tHe says “Veracruz” is “an anti-war song war, but it has a lot of heart in it because there’s a family in a horrible situation and they have to leave. After I wrote the Spanish part, Warren says, ‘Man, now the song has heart.’ Because the other part of the song is the description of the people, but now the people are. speaking. And so it was a wonderful song and he loved it till the end of his life.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJordan Summers and Jorge Calderon rehearse for the ‘Join Me in L.A.’ Wild Honey tribute to Warren Zevon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChris Willman/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCalderón was critical in the final part of Zevon’s musical journey. “I really, really thought that we were meant to have been together in this lifetime, to meet and, and collaborate. Sometimes I would go there and be with him andend up playing bass or guitar, or I’d clap my hands or sing Harmony, or write a song. You’d see some albums that I just did a few things, and some other albums I’d do more. The only one that I didn’t do anything was ‘Transverse City,’ because he called me up to come work but I had chickenpox!\n\n\t“When we did ‘The Wind,’ it was such a ominous thing. He was dying,” says Calderon. “We were already planning to write the songs fast and do something fast, but between that and starting to work on it, he found out about the cancer. At first I said, ‘Maybe you should just forget the record and go be with your family, get treatment.’ He said, ‘No, I wanna do the record.’ So we did it the same way we had talked about, but with this cloud of a different reality. Nobody knew. The doctors had said, ‘Oh, three months, six months’ — he lasted a year, but we didn’t know that. And the creative energy and process that he was going through and the joy of the songs that we were writing kept him alive longer. And he knew it and the people around us knew it. So that was a beautiful thing. It’s a wonderful album, very honest and sincere. It was done fast, so it’s not perfect. But rock ”n’ roll is not perfect. Rock ‘n’ roll is rock ‘n’ roll.”\n\t\n\n\tThe song that has come closest to becoming a standard from the final album is “Keep Me in Your Heart.” Calderón says, “That was another one that he started from the beginning, but then it became too hard for him to write — too sorrowful. He told me, ‘It’s too painful. Dude, you gotta finish this song. You are gonna have to help me, because I cannot do it.’ I don’t know how I did it, but I did, and at the end, we were both glad that the song got written, because it’s a beautiful song, touching song. What can I say? That album was a special thing, and it was the culmination and the catharsis of knowing each other.”\n\n\tHis son, Jordan, has had a great deal of time to consider his father’s dual (at least) legacies as a wild man before rehab, and a musical scholar before and after finding his sobriety and his footing.\n\n\t“He was a brilliant songwriter, and I don’t think that that’s something that I say just because he is my dad,” Jordan says. In fact, he adds, “it might have taken me longer than some people to get old enough to realize. He really put work into it and tried to create deep, meaningful indelible songs. And he certainly never lost that when he also was being seen as a rock star and, at times, people said, a wild man on stage. A lot of people in his position might have let persona take over when the audience is sort of latching onto that image. But when you go into it with classical training and you put in this kind of deep work, you can kind of let the other stuff get to the bare edge and the talent is still there. I think he would be the first person to say that none of that stuff helped him be what he was in the ’70s. It certainly wasn’t his favorite time of his life, but he got through it.\n\n\t“I think that there’s a lot of timelessness to the music. If you look at some of the brilliant songwriters, the Beatles or Elton John and Bernie Taupin, there’s that same craftsmanship to it. You know, we’ve all gone through a couple of apartments worth of IKEA furniture, and eventually we end up with the antique dresser that still looks as beautiful as the day it was made.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMorena Baccarin has done her crimefighting homework.\n\n\tThe actress stars in CBS’s new “Fire Country” spinoff “Sheriff Country” as Sheriff Mickey Fox. The procedural follows Mickey as she heads up her small hometown police force while grappling with her daughter’s battle with addiction.\n\n\t“It’s been so fun to understand law enforcement, to train in that way,” Baccarin tells me on Zoom video during a lunch break on the Ontario, Canada set. “We always have somebody on set with us, helping us with things like if I’m suspecting somebody’s going to come at me and they’re potentially armed and I’m walking out of my car and I’m parking, how do I do it? Do I pull my gun out?”\n\t\n\n\tRemoving her gun from a holster takes a lot of practice. “Matt Lauria [he co-stars as deputy Nathan Boone]  and I joke around a lot because half of our time on set is spent practicing pulling the gun out, putting it back in, pulling it out and putting it back in,” Baccarin says. “You want it to be second nature because when you put that gun back in you don’t want to look down to see where it is.”\n\n\tNot that Baccarin will ever get completely comfortable handling a firearm. “I’ve aways been very scared of guns. I don’t own a gun. I believe if we didn’t have guns at all, then a lot of the stuff that we deal with would not be happening,” she says. “But I have a new respect for it. Everybody who has been teaching us has been incredibly respectful about the weapon and when you use it, when you touch it, what you do with it and how to handle it.”\n\n\tBaccarin says she was sure she wouldn’t be cast on the show when she told producers she would only sign on if production moved from its planned West Coast location to the East Coast because she wanted to be closer to her family, husband Ben McKenzie and their three kids, in New York. “I 100% thought the job was going away once I said that,” she says, adding, “I think that was a big moment for me to realize that I am valuable enough for them to make that concession. It also sets up a really nice work relationship, not just that they want me, but that we are partners in this.”\n\t\n\n\tBaccarin reflects on being a working mom in Hollywood. “You’re definitely letting somebody down sometimes, at all times, whenever,” she says. “You come to work without having done enough work at home. You miss a birthday, so you make up for something by having a day off and doing more than you should. It’s a mess. But I try to remind them that even if we’re not together, I’m thinking of them, that they’re a part of me, and that it makes me a better mom if I can do what I love, and that one day they’ll understand that.”\n\n\tBaccarin is a familiar face in the superhero world. Her voicework for animated projects is prolific, but her most prominent role is that of Vanessa Carlysle in the “Deadpool” movies. “It’s been such a long journey. I can’t it’s almost 10 years since we shot the first one,” she says. “I never would have imagined in my wildest dreams that that’s what it would have turned out to be. We had so much fun shooting it. It was such a fun world. I hope that I get to do more of it and participate a little bit more than the last one [“Deadpool & Wolverine”]. But I understood that it was the bro comedy.”\n\n\tHer superhero resume expands with her role as The Sorceress in the upcoming live-action “Masters of the Universe” opposite Nicholas Galitzine as He-Man.\n\n\tShe says of Galitzine’s muscled-up transformation for the role, “It’s insane. I saw him on set and he’d been training for months and months and months, I was like, ‘Oh, my god, how did you do that?’”\n\n\tJoining the film was a no-brainer for Baccarin. “I grew up watching He-Man, my brother and I, so it was a really big part of my childhood,” she says, smiling. “It was really cool once I got there and saw the costume and what they had in mind for me — the whole get-up and the wig and contacts and all of it. I’m so excited to see what they make of it because I feel like my part of it was just such a small element to what it’s going to actually be in the end.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tXbox’s prized “Halo” franchise is coming to PlayStation 5 next year with a remake of the very first “Halo” game, 2001’s “Halo: Combat Evolved.”\n\n\tTitled “Halo: Campaign Evolved,” the game is described as “a faithful yet modernized remake of Halo: Combat Evolved’s campaign, rebuilt from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5.” \n\n\tPer Microsoft Gaming and Halo Studios, “Play the legendary story with upgraded visuals, refined controls, two-player split-screen (console only), up to four-player online co-op with cross-play and cross-progression, three new missions, and an expanded arsenal of weapons, vehicles, and new enemies.”\n\t\n\n\tThe news was announced Friday out of the Halo World Championship 2025.\n\n\n\t“We wanted to start where it all began, with the original campaign that defined Halo,” executive producer Damon Conn said in an Xbox Wire post Friday. “Starting here means people that have never played the game before will be able to understand the story from the very beginning, and that can help us chart a course forward with new Halo stories. Focusing on the campaign experience means we can concentrate fully on really capturing the atmosphere, tone – the emotional impact of what made the first campaign so special and iconic.”\n\n\t“Halo: Campaign Evolved” is coming in 2026 to Xbox Series X and S, Xbox on PC, Steam, PlayStation 5. The game will support Xbox Cloud Gaming and Xbox Play Anywhere and be available at launch with Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. \n\n\tWatch the PlayStation 5 trailer for “Halo: Campaign Evolved” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tMint Mobile is bringing its irreverent, budget-conscious branding from cell phones to the living room with 5G Home MINTernet, a new low-cost home internet service powered by T-Mobile’s 5G network. Launching this month, the plan starts at $30 per month and offers unlimited data — positioning it as one of the most aggressively priced broadband options on the market. \n\n\tFor Mint, co-owned by Ryan Reynolds until its $1.35 billion sale to T-Mobile earlier last year, the move into home Wi-Fi feels like a natural next act. The brand built its reputation on comical marketing and transparent pricing, thriving in a telecom space long dominated by corporate giants like Verizon and AT&T. Now, it’s targeting the same frustration that made its mobile plans go viral — high bills and hidden fees — with a service that promises “exceptional value” and an easy plug-and-play setup. \n\t\n\n\tThe strategy mirrors a broader shift in the streaming era, where affordable, reliable internet has become essential to entertainment consumption as the platforms themselves. As studios, streamers and advertisers compete for attention, the real gatekeeper is increasingly the Wi-Fi connection. With T-Mobile’s 5G infrastructure backing it,  MINTernet is an attempt to democratize high-speed access without the installation costs and long-term contracts that often come with traditional broadband providers like Spectrum or Comcast’s Xfinity. \n\n\tMint’s pricing also undercuts emerging 5G home internet players such as Verizon’s 5G Home ($35–$50 per month) and T-Mobile’s own 5G Home Internet ($40–$50), reinforcing the brand’s underdog positioning. Existing Mint Mobile users get an additional $10 monthly discount on MINTernet, further integrating the wireless and home categories into one ecosystem. \n\t\n\n\tThey launched Minternet with a Reynolds spot, reflecting the same challenger-brand DNA that has made Mint one of the most talked-about disruptors in telecom. If the company can deliver on its promise of high-speed simplicity, Home MINTernet could do for broadband what Mint did for mobile: turn an everyday utility into a lifestyle brand with cultural clout.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tPaul Thomas Anderson is ready to lean into the laughs with “One Battle After Another.”\n\n\tThe acclaimed action thriller, loosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s novel “Vineland,” will compete in the comedy categories at the upcoming Golden Globe Awards, Variety has confirmed via FYC materials that were sent to voters. \n\n\tThe Warner Bros. epic follows a group of former revolutionaries who reunite to rescue a comrade’s daughter after a long-dormant enemy reemerges. The ensemble cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, Regina Hall, Teyana Taylor and Chase Infiniti. As previously reported by Variety, DiCaprio and Infiniti will compete in the lead acting categories across all groups during awards season, while the rest of the cast will seek consideration in supporting roles.\n\t\n\n\tThe film’s tonal balancing act — mixing absurdist humor with Anderson’s trademark intensity — seemed obviously comedic to casual awards observers, and the filmmakers, along with studio awards strategists, felt similarly. In the comedy and musical races, the movie is expected to face off against A24’s “Marty Supreme,” Focus Features’ “Bugonia,” Universal Pictures’ “Wicked: For Good” and others.\n\n\n\tWith a 95% critics’ score on Rotten Tomatoes and a 95 rating on Metacritic, “One Battle After Another” has emerged as one of the most celebrated releases of the year. Variety’s recent predictions list it as a major Oscar contender, potentially scoring up to 14 nominations — a number that would tie the record held by “All About Eve” (1950), “Titanic” (1997) and “La La Land” (2016). The film could manage to break the record with the addition of a new casting category this year.\n\t\n\n\tAt the Golden Globes, the film also has a shot to make history. Robert Altman’s classic “Nashville” (1975) currently holds the record for most nominations for a single film with 11, while Jacques Audiard’s Spanish-language musical “Emilia Pérez” (2024) is second with 10. Variety’s Globes forecast below has “One Battle After Another” on track to land around 10 nominations, which would tie it with “Emilia Pérez” as the second-most nominated film ever.\n\n\tIf “One Battle After Another” can manage to cross the $100 million domestic mark, it would also qualify for the Globes’ Cinematic and Box Office Achievement category, which requires a film to earn $150 million worldwide and at least $100 million in the U.S. (or equivalent digital streaming metrics). The film has grossed more than $165 million globally but remains shy of the domestic threshold at $65 million. A submission in that race would open the possibility of 11 nominations (without an original song in the mix). Nonetheless, Anderson’s latest may be the rare film that defies category lines with a blend of high-concept spectacle and political farce. \n\n\tWhether voters see it as an action epic, a biting comedy, or both, “One Battle After Another” is positioned to dominate the season: one award, and one battle, after another.\n\n\tThe Golden Globe nominations will be revealed on Dec. 8. Updated predictions for both film and television categories are listed below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“One Battle After Another”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGolden Globes Predictions Tracking(Oct. 23, 2025)\t\n\t\n\t\tFilm\t\n\n\tBest Picture (Drama)“Avatar: Fire and Ash” (20th Century Studios)“Frankenstein” (Netflix)“Hamnet” (Focus Features) ***“The Secret Agent” (Neon)“Sentimental Value” (Neon)“Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\n\n\tAlternates: “It Was Just an Accident” (Neon); “A House of Dynamite” (Netflix); “Train Dreams” (Netflix)\n\n\tBest Picture (Comedy or Musical)“Bugonia” (Focus Features)“Jay Kelly” (Netflix)“Marty Supreme” (A24)“One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.) ***“Song Sung Blue” (Focus Features)“Wicked: For Good” (Universal Pictures)\n\n\tAlternates: “No Other Choice” (Neon); “The Testament of Ann Lee” (Searchlight Pictures); “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Story” (Netflix)\n\n\tActor (Drama)Joel Edgerton, “Train Dreams” (Netflix)Colin Farrell, “Ballad of a Small Player” (Netflix)Dwayne Johnson, “The Smashing Machine” (A24) Michael B.

We hope this release will inspire many epic kitchen sing-alongs and dress-up dance parties!”\n\n\tThis collaboration builds on Yoto’s mission to partner with leading entertainment and music creators to deliver safe, independent, and enriching screen-free storytelling and soundtracks to kids globally.\n\n\n\tThe KPop Demon Hunters Yoto card launched on Oct. 15, and is available at yotoplay.com priced at $14.99 each with a run time of 37min.

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tNugget’s foam play couch has long been a favorite for parents and kids alike. With a mission to grow imaginations across the U.S, the brand pioneered family-friendly play furniture when it first launched in 2014.\n\n\tNow, they’re tapping into the cultural zeitgeist with a strategic partnership with the ultra-popular Youtuber Ms. Rachel, who this week has launched her own version of the brand’s headlining Original Play Couch. The Ms. Rachel Nugget is now available to shop online for $289.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tWith designs inspired by Ms. Rachel’s most popular songs, including “Hop Little Bunnies,” “If You Should Meet an Elephant” and “Wheels On The Bus,” the new launch highlights her song-driven education style, all while encouraging creativity, movement and connection.\n\n\t“Play is one of the most powerful ways children learn. That’s why I’m excited to collaborate with Nugget, a company that shares our commitment to sparking imagination and connection at home,” Ms. Rachel, born Rachel Griffin-Accurso, said in a statement. “The Ms. Rachel Nugget was created to bring families together, and I can’t wait to see the joy it inspires in little ones everywhere.”\n\n\tDavid Baron, CEO and co-founder of Nugget shares, “Our collaboration with Ms. Rachel embodies Nugget’s fundamental mission to grow imaginations through thoughtfully designed play furniture. The Ms. Rachel Nugget is a perfect testament to that commitment.”\n\n\tOver the past few years, Ms. Rachel has transformed from a YouTube educator into a full-fledged children’s media brand with a suite of high-profile partnerships — from a global master toy deal with Spin Master to music collaborations with “Sesame Street” and John Legend. Most recently, Netflix signed Ms. Rachel to a streaming content deal.\n\n\n\tThe Ms. Rachel Nugget is now available to pre-order and will ship on Nov. 14, exclusively at NuggetComfort.com. \n",

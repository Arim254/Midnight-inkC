    "body": "\n\tSunny Side of the Doc will take place June 22-24, in La Rochelle, France, following a strategic partnership with Documentary Campus that has revived the documentary market after its cancellation was announced last December.\n\n\tThe event’s return marks a dramatic turnaround for the 37-year-old market, which cited lost European funding and organizational constraints when Doc Services announced in December 2025 that it would not hold the 2026 edition. The new partnership with Documentary Campus, combined with support from France’s CNC and industry mobilization, enabled organizers to restructure the market with what they describe as a more focused approach.\n\t\n\n\t“This partnership allows us to look ahead with clarity and ambition,” said Aurélie Reman, managing director of Sunny Side of the Doc. “Taking time to listen and reflect was essential to design a model that aligns with the shifting demands of the documentary community. Sunny Side of the Doc is that lighthouse guiding the way, the entry point for a world of stories with power and authenticity.”\n\n\n\tThe 2026 edition will feature a streamlined three-day format centered on essential B2B functions, with programming restructured around linear productions and digital-first strategies. Traditional on-stage pitches will be replaced by a round-table pitching format designed to facilitate direct, discussion-driven encounters between producers and decision-makers. The program will also include high-level talks addressing documentary content, storytelling and business models.\n\n\tDocumentary Campus brings 25 years of experience in professional training, networking and market development for documentary and factual content. The organization manages programs including the Silbersalz Science & Media Festival and World Congress of Science & Factual Producers.\n\t\n\n\t“Documentary Campus brings long-standing expertise in designing and managing market-driven programmes that respond directly to the industry’s most urgent needs,” said Donata von Perfall, managing director of Documentary Campus. “With this new partnership, we are working together to build a market that addresses today’s challenges while driving the future of how documentaries are financed, produced, and shared globally.”\n\n\tRoman Jeanneau, president of Doc Services, which implements Sunny Side of the Doc, added: “This partnership with Documentary Campus and Donata von Perfall’s commitment are a response to the needs of professionals at a pivotal moment for the industry.”\n\n\tThe market typically attracts more than 2,100 participants from 60 countries, including decision makers, producers, filmmakers, sales agents and funders. \n",

    "body": "\n\tParis-based sales-production Charades, a director-driven sales banner intent on bringing new voices to the world such as Gints Zilbalodis’ Oscar winner “Flow,” has boarded “Almost There,” the feature debut of Norway’s Rikke Gregersen whose first short “Dog Eat Dog” (2018) won a Student Academy Award. Her second, “The Affected” (2020) was selected for the Sundance Festival.\n\n\tYmer will release “Almost There” in Norway. The film is set to open in the rest of Scandinavia via distribution powerhouse Scanbox Entertainment.\n\t\n\n\t“Almost There” (“Suser avgårde”) also represents one of the latest films from Norway’s resolutely independent production house Motlys, which produced Berlin Film Festival’s 2025 Golden Bear winner “Dreams,” and indeed all of Dag Johan Haugerud’s “Sex”/“Love”/“Dreams” trilogy. Motlys was also behind the second to fourth features of Joachim Trier, now Oscar nominated for “Sentimental Value”: “Oslo, August 31st” (2011), “Louder Than Bombs” (2015) and “Thelma” (2017).   \n\n\n\tStarring Renata Reinvse, who has just scored an Academy Award actress nomination for Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” “Dog Eat Dog,” and “The Affected” – where Reinvse has a high-profile cameo in a large ensemble cast – Gregersen’s two shorts are laced by what look like signature arch ironies. \n\n\tThey also ring totally true as they respectively ask discomfiting but totally questions about, repectively, selflessness in relations and activism while immersing the viewer in situations which are totally relatable.\n\t\n\n\tThat relatability looks set also to mark “Almost There” apart, which is already cast by Variety as one of the potential top attractions at the Works in Progress strand of this week’s Göteborg Festival’s Nordic Film Market, which runs Jan. 28-30.\n\n\tWritten by Rakel Kraft Biørnstad and produced by Motlys’ Ingvil Sæther Berger, “Almost There” turns on Agnes, 29, an aspiring musician, as she desperately clings to her youth while the world refuses to stand still. “The film explores the shift from carefree twenties to more serious thirties, capturing the chaos, pressure, humor and melancholy of this transition,” runs a logline.\n\n\t“We immediately fell in love with the work of Rikke Gregersen when we came across ‘The Affected’ and ‘Dog Eat Dog.’ For us it was clear she was going to be a new voice to reckon with in Norway, and the fact that veteran company Motlys was developing her debut feature further convinced us we wanted to be a part of it,” Lucie Desquiens, Charades’ manager of acquisitions & sales  and co-fonder Carole Baraton said in a joint statement. \n\n\t“The script had everything that convinced us in her shorts – biting humor, complex emotions and deeply ambiguous characters we nonetheless wanted to spend all of our time with,” they added. “We think the film has wide appeal to both the youth – “Almost There” is a generational film – and a more mature cinephile audience, and are excited to bring it to them, hopefully starting with a launch in an A festival.”\n\n\tGregersen’s debut stars Sarah Francesca Brænne (“Sick of Myself,” “My Uncle Jens,” “Nach”), Ada Eide (“Basic Bitch,” “Utøya, July 22”), Steinar Klouman Hallert (“Sick of Myself,” “Thelma”) and Fredrik Stenberg Ditlev-Simonsen (“Wisting,” “The Architect”).\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAlmost There cast \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: Jan Tore Eriksen\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“‘Almost There’ explores the complex and often contradictory transition from young adulthood to full adulthood,” Gregersen said. “The film aims to capture that unique phase where people, even in the same environment, find themselves at very different points in life, facing profound questions about identity and purpose. I want to create moments that resonate deeply, moments that make the audience think, ‘That’s exactly how it feels.’”\n\t\n\n\tGregersen told Variety when it announced the titlethat working closely with her usual cinematographer Torjus Thesen (“Solomamma”), that she would shoot with long takes, in the cinéma vérité style. Music is deeply woven into the film’s fabric, with performances and songs from both actors and musicians serving as the omniscient voice of the characters’ lives. “Almost There” is backed by the Norwegian Film Institute, Nordic Film & TV Fund and Oslo Film Fund.\n\n\t“The film captures the awkward, restless space between youth and adulthood with subtle honesty and emotional clarity,” said producer Sæther Berger. “Through Rikke Gregersen’s precise balance of humor and discomfort, the film unfolds with a natural intimacy that feels lived-in. At its core is her collaboration with screenwriter Rakel Kraft Biørnstad, a creative partnership that crafts a freakishly accurate portrait of young adults still figuring out who they want to be.”\n\n\tA Few Details on ‘Dog Eat Dog,’ ‘The Affected’ and ‘Requiem for Selina’\n\n\tWritten and directed by Gregersen, and also a BAFTA/LA Student Award winner, “Dog Eat Dog” sees Renata Reinvse play Silje, who thinks it’s not the best time to announce to her boyfriend Thomas family that she has left him when that drives him to a highly theatrical attempt to hang himself. She ends up trapped on an island and, even when she comes clean about her dumping him and his suicide attempt, perhaps still tied to Thomas whose behaviour betrays increasingly his self-obsessed and maybe pathological true self. The film stands out in its choice of camera set up, from a “Rear Window”-style opening shot to a masterful circular sweep of Silje, Thomas, his brother and his brother’s g.f. in conversation capturing a physical sense of Silje’s emotional confinement.\n\n\tWritten by Gregersen and Trond Arntzen (“The Night”), “The Affected” is set on a just-to-take-off airplane on which one passenger refuses to take her seat until an Afghan deportee is taken off the plane. The short doesn’t record her confrontation with a flight attendant and the plane’s captain but rather bystanders’ reactions. Some ignore the incident. Others sympathise with the protestor and the airplane bursts into applause when the deportee is finally lead off the plane. But nobody got up to join the protestor. “Everybody wants to do something but nobody does anything,” one passenger observes, capturing the film’s central irony.\n\t\n\n\tGregersen is best known of late, however, as a co-director with Ole Sebastian Kåss of series “Requiem for Selina.” Set in a snowy northern Norway in the 2000s, it chats how Selina, when bullied at school, creates in a blog a glamorous on-screen alter-ego, Celina Isabelle, who becomes one of the world’s first beauty-tip influencers, as the real-life Selina dies, acquiring the identity of Celina. Gregersen and Kåss nail the aesthetics, music – Britney Spears – and garb of the aughts. Created by Emeline Berglund and written with Benjamin Berglund, “Requiem for Selina” won the Series Mania International Panorama Students Award.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Give Me the Ball!,” the title of Liz Garbus and Elizabeth Wolff’s ferociously inspirational and entertaining documentary about Billie Jean King, refers to something that the fabled tennis superstar would say repeatedly when she was growing up. King, born in Long Beach, California, in 1943, was raised in a 1950s world where girls weren’t supposed to want to play sports. But King was such a natural-born athlete that she wanted to play all of them. Football, baseball — whatever the game, she’d say, “Give me the ball!” When a friend of hers told her that she should try tennis, King had never even heard of it. She asked what the sport involved, and when the answer was running, jumping, and hitting a ball, her response was: I’m in.\n\t\n\n\tNone of this may sound like a big deal. But what it captures is that from the very beginning, Billie Jean King’s relationship to sports was primal. She wanted — needed — the ball, to throw it and hit it, to throw her whole body into the action (even as her mother was telling her that that’s not what a “lady” does). And that’s the kind of tennis player she became. She was all over the court, charging at the ball from every corner, but fundamentally she was a power hitter who would come up close to the net, smashing the ball, then doing it again, wearing her opponent down with the relentlessness of her attack. In the ’60s and early ’70s, when King wasn’t just playing tennis but blazing trails (athletic, financial, cultural), she was thought of as a woman who played tennis “like a man.” Her aggression was in every way a game-changer.\n\t\n\n\tWhat “Give Me the Ball!” shows you is that Billie Jean King turned what she wanted into a mission. That’s how she became so much more than a tennis superstar; she became a culture hero as important as Muhammad Ali. Almost singlehandedly, she planted the idea on the map that women, like men, should be paid for playing tennis (when she started, they were not), and also — radical notion! — that they should make the same amount of money that men did. The world has changed so much since then that it’s hard to describe how heretical that idea seemed at the time. King fought for it not because she set out to be an “activist,” but because it simply made no sense to her that star female athletes wouldn’t be compensated for doing the same thing that star male athletes did. This wasn’t about box office. (In tennis, the women were sometimes bigger draws than the men.) It was about second-class citizenship. And her attack on that system played out the same way that her game did on the court: She was relentless. She smashed the opposition. She was going to win the fight — and did — because she was hard-wired to win it.\n\n\tThe movie is built around a freewheeling interview with King today, who unfurls the saga of her life. She’s 82 now, and the filmmakers frame her in a single head-on shot. She’s wearing fuchsia horn-rims and a teal athletic jacket, and what gives the documentary its unique pulse is that King has the energized articulation of a woman decades younger than her years. She’s warm and laceratingly honest, with a ripe sense of humor, and she speaks in rich percussive sound bites, which the filmmakers employ in a nearly musical way, cutting back and forth, often rapidly, between King’s words and clips of the story she’s telling. We feel like we’re inside her head, and the footage itself is extraordinary.\n\n\t“Give Me the Ball!” tells King’s whole story, opening with a kaleidoscopic blast ahead to 1973, when she was at the height of her powers but everything in her existence — her athletic genius, her war for equal pay, her messy personal life — was coming to a head. The footage of her in action on the court looks more astonishing than ever. The sheer force of her playing was embodied in moves of extraordinary elegance; she was like a dancer. And that quality of hers was abetted by something that most tennis champions don’t have: a charisma on the level of a movie star. She was beautiful, like Diane Keaton’s jock sister, and that thick shag haircut of hers was singular — it made her look as iconic and electrifying as David Bowie in his “Aladdin Sane” days.\n\t\n\n\tGarbus and Wolff take us through her life in a way that’s both propulsive and reflective, mirroring King’s energy on the court. The drama never lets up, from her days as a girl named Billie Jean Moffitt who couldn’t afford tennis lessons but attended the free youth clinics available in Long Beach, even as she was competing with the rich kids who populated the sport; to the way that she declared early on — she simply decided — that she was going to be the number-one female tennis player in the world; to her rise in the ’60s, when she became a champion yet still couldn’t make a living at it; to her heroic, exhausting, no-holds-barred fight for the establishment of prize money, which meant going out and finding sponsors; to her voluminous tournament wins; to her marriage to a man named Larry King, who became her loving supporter and business partner, even as they fell apart when she began to discover her sexual identity; to the quiet turmoil of her closeted existence, which ultimately led to a serious eating disorder and to a nasty court fight with her first female partner, Marilyn Barnett, a battle that wound up outing her sexually; and to the way that cataclysm proved to be both agonizing and liberating.\n\n\tIt all comes to a climax in the legendary “Battle of the Sexes” exhibition match that she fought against Bobby Riggs on Sept. 20, 1973, the two facing off in the Houston Astrodome before a live television audience of 90 million. King was 29. Riggs, a former tennis champion, was a 55-year-old carny-barker hustler who truly believed that women should stay “in their place.” As we see from footage of the time, he was hardly alone. This tennis match was a symbolic feminist civil war. It was publicized like one of those only-in-the-’70s freak media events, but it had as large on impact on gender politics as Jesse Owens’ triumph at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin had on racial politics.\n\n\tThe filmmakers devote a lot of time to the match, letting it play out as King narrates her inner state, and the result is one of the most thrilling sequences I’ve seen in a documentary in years. The strategy that King decided on at the last minute was to hang back, lobbing softballs to create long volleys that would tire Riggs out. (It was almost a tennis version of the rope-a-dope.) Yet it took her a while to get her bearings. The pressure King felt was unreal. She believed that if she lost to this joker in front of the entire world, in a contest he had set up to be a measure of women’s “inferiority,” it would set the women’s movement back years. But then she calms herself and settles into playing in the moment, and the spectacle of her doing that is intensely moving.\n\t\n\n\t“Give Me the Ball!” captures how the victories of Billie Jean King did nothing less than help change the trajectories of women’s lives. For too long, though, she couldn’t be who she was. The film shows us how her close friendship with Elton John, who wrote “Philadelphia Freedom” for her, was rooted in that shared predicament (though he says it was harder for her, because many in the entertainment industry knew he was gay). Yet even as we glimpse the torment behind her cool façade, we also see that she handles it the same way she did everything else: with a quality that can only be called grace. She still has that (in a feisty way). Maybe that’s why the ball stayed in her court.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn Dawn Porter’s powerful documentary “When A Witness Recants,” Ta-Nehisi Coates presents — both as an executive producer and occasional subject — a stirring tale of American injustice, which he remembers from his high school days. The story of three Black teenage boys falsely convicted of murdering their classmate (and subsequently sentenced to life), the movie spans several decades, functioning as both an archival portrait of Baltimore in the 1980s and a retroactive true-crime investigation. However, its conclusions are entirely unexpected, and entirely devastating.\n\t\n\n\tThe film is based on Jennifer Gonnerman’s 2021 New Yorker article of the same name, which opens with the harrowing details of a shooting in the hallways of Harlem Park Junior High, in which 14-year-old DeWitt Duckett was killed in a robbery gone wrong. Porter, on the other hand, expands her view of the case by having Coates set the cultural stage from the top down, through his memories of growing up in Maryland and his recollections of community. This also serves as an introduction to several of the movie’s key players, including the aggrieved trio of wrongful suspects — Alfred Chestnut, Andrew Stewart and Ransom Watkins — now men in their 50s, finally out from behind bars. \n\n\n\tThe movie doesn’t play coy about this outcome, nor does it allow Coates to overstay his welcome as a distant observer to their case. Instead, Coates and Porter hand the trio the reins of the story. They’re allowed to finally take control of their own narratives through the movie’s skillfully cross-cut interviews (one of which begins with the stirring image of an empty seat; Duckett’s absence looms large over all their lives).\n\t\n\n\tIn the meantime, legal depositions from 2022, both with Black witnesses to the crime and its white key investigator, function as secondary interview sources and also allow those involved to either confess their roles in this miscarriage of justice or deny it outright. Eventually, this bifurcated structure, focused on the recent present, gives way to a story of time and place, rendered with moods both wistful and agonizing, as news footage and archival videos from 1983 gradually become the film’s new lingua franca. For every bit of story that isn’t readily available, Porter employs (en lieu of live-action reenactments) the talents of Philadelphia comic book artist Dawud Anyabwile, whose stark black-and-white motion comics depict the accused trio — and the teens manipulated to testify against them — as young boys placed in impossible predicaments, their respective futures hanging in the balance.\n\n\tAs one might gauge from these descriptions, Porter takes a multitude of visual approaches, but they each end up justified, given the sheer temporal and emotional expanse the movie has to cover. One recollection at a time, “When a Witness Recants” reverse-engineers its subjects’ present predicaments by revisiting enraging details of the case and the way Chestnut, Stewart and Watkins first came under the police’s microscope (which is to say: all but randomly). There’s barely any mystery to all the wrongdoings and witness tampering, and no factual gray area in which the movie can dabble. It isn’t interested in relitigating a case that has already been reopened and closed, albeit several decades too late.\n\n\tInstead, Porter’s interests lie in the enormous emotional toll of these events, both on the trio themselves — dubbed the “Harlem Park Three,” like the similarly wrongfully convicted “Central Park Five” — and on one of the witnesses forced to testify falsely against them at the time, their classmate Ron Bishop. These ripple effects are captured with dramatic rigor, from the anguish of their families in the aftermath, to their own survival mechanisms in the years that followed (both in prison and outside its walls). However, just as intriguing as what each man readily shares is that which they hold close to the chest, and the many visual details that go unremarked upon by the film and its narrations.\n\t\n\n\tWe as viewers are left to draw our own conclusions from the trio’s matching “HP3” necklaces (are they bonded, in some manner, by their shared trauma, perhaps in ways they may not recognize?) and from the fleeting courtroom sketches from their trials, which depict them as hulking, dangerous adults, despite being 16 years of age, and meek of stature. The framing and trying of young Black boys as adults in the United States is a continued iniquity and may have even contributed to their conviction at the time. No one in the film comes right out and says it, but Anyabwile’s sketches practically work to rehumanize them in the face of a society and systems that once robbed them of everything from their youth to the benefit of doubt to the promise of their respective futures.\n\n\tWhat is perhaps the movie’s narrative masterstroke is that even once it approaches the temporary catharsis of the men’s case being overturned, it doesn’t stop there. Instead, its extended final act follows not only their lives in the aftermath of decades behind bars, but the shattering lack of closure over what was done to them, in the form of a filmed confrontation that allows them much-needed release. To contextualize this story as justice delayed, or finally delivered, would be a betrayal of what the trio was forced to endure. Even the most joyful moments of “When a Witness Recants” are framed within its larger tale of justice denied, making it a thorough and affecting work of nonfiction cinema.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWith “The Real Housewives of Orange County” gearing up to begin production on its history-making 20th season — a landmark for the Bravo franchise that changed popular culture as we know it — its cast is taking shape, and Gretchen Rossi will not be in the ensemble, Variety has learned.\n\n\tSeason 20 is set to begin filming soon, and, Rossi aside, the rest of the 19th season’s cast is expected to remain intact, minus one other: On Jan. 9, Katie Ginella posted on Instagram to say that she’d been fired, writing, “After two seasons as a cast member on RHOC, the network has decided to move forward with Season 20 without me.” Ginella’s ouster was not unexpected, after a disastrous season in which she was caught in a number of lies — about having made an illicit recording of fellow castmate Shannon Beador the previous season, and after being accused of spreading information about the show and the cast to Bravo content creators. After flagrantly failing a lie detector test on camera, Ginella more or less stopped filming, apparently at the producers’ insistence. Ginella was the first Asian American woman to be cast on “The Real Housewives of Orange County.”\n\t\n\n\tRossi had returned to “The Real Housewives of Orange County” with some fanfare, as a “friend” of the cast, having been brought in as a foil to her arch-nemesis Tamra Judge. Rossi was a full-time cast member from Seasons 4-8, and had always clashed with Judge: a situation that grew worse in Rossi’s years off the show as the two of them continued to feud off-camera. Their enmity did continue to play out throughout Season 19, but Judge — who had a horrendous season for personal reasons, and quit the show several times while being filmed — gained the upper hand in the finale when her vessel Gina Kirschenheiter brought up an infamous Twitter thread from 2023 that catalogued screenshots of Rossi liking transphobic, anti-abortion and anti-vaccine posts on social media. Rossi’s reaction to the sudden introduction of this topic at the cast’s final dinner in Amsterdam was bizarre, and she gave the impression she was in a fugue state — and sort of denied liking the posts, but not really. During the show’s reunion episodes, she put up more of a fight, and tried to turn the tables on Judge by saying she’d hired a cyber analyst who tied something on social media (it wasn’t clear) to Judge, but she didn’t produce any tangible receipts either during the reunion or later on Instagram, and her allegations didn’t stick.\n\t\n\n\tAnd Judge will return for Season 20, despite her behavior the previous season: She’s been saved because of the storyline potential that comes from reuniting the now-splintered “tres amigas,” which consisted of Judge, Beador and Vicki Gunvalson. “Real Housewives” executive producer Andy Cohen offered Gunvalson, the “OG of the OC,” an orange on stage at BravoCon in November, fittingly making her the first cast member of Season 20. It seems that the trio of former besties — who exist in various states of conflict, always — must be allowed to enact their psychodramas on camera.\n\n\tAs for the rest of the cast, despite speculation in the Bravosphere about a more major overhaul, the remaining Season 19 group will be back, with (a newly engaged) Kirschenheiter, Emily Simpson, Heather Dubrow and Jennifer Pedranti alll returning for Bravo’s milestone 20th season.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA melancholic affection for New York City permeates writer-director Noah Segan’s nostalgia-powered “The Only Living Pickpocket in New York,” a minor-key character study that quietly mourns a bygone era, when life was analog, and so were its criminals. Bookended by two pitch-perfect needle drops that signify every New Yorker’s complex emotions about their city (LCD Soundsystem’s “New York, I Love You but You’re Bringing Me Down” and the Bobby Short version of “I Happen to Like New York”), longtime actor Segan’s sophomore feature feels like a warm embrace in defiance of an increasingly cold world that has lost its manners, along with the tactile elements worth holding onto.\n\t\n\n\tOften accompanied by a groovy, ’70s-style score of the Lalo Schifrin jazz-funk variety, the 60-something Bronx man Harry is certainly trying his darndest to maintain some semblance of that past. Played by John Turturro in a mesmerizingly tender performance, Harry lovingly cares for his disabled, nonverbal wife Rosie (Karina Arroyave) and wrestles his way through the stuffed subway cars of the Big Apple in search of cash and valuables to lift as a pickpocket with old-school skills, while being increasingly confronted by harsh contemporary realities where an average person no longer carries cash or wears heirloom timepieces.\n\n\n\tThe most Harry can swipe these days is a slim wallet here or an iPhone there — a traceable nuisance that isn’t all that lucrative to sell to his longtime partner-in-crime and good friend Ben (Steve Buscemi, in his wonderfully acerbic mode), a pawn shop owner as perplexed by the techy gluten-free kids of today as his pal. He makes an exception for his savvy daughter Eve (Victoria Moroles), one of the good ones, who helps out her dad and treats Harry like family.\n\t\n\n\tIn an ingenious prologue, “Pickpocket” starts with the daily grind of New York, following a white-collar man through his morning routine and workday, until he can’t locate his wallet to pay for a business meal. That’s because he’s just been one of the countless New Yorkers who had the misfortune of standing right next to Harry in a subway car earlier, an instance we only briefly witness with Harry being just another face amid the rush hour.\n\n\tExcept, it’s hard not to notice Harry if we’re being honest, not when he’s wrapped in an instantly iconic cashmere overcoat that matches his salt-and-pepper hair and feels as essential and character-based a choice of outerwear as Alain Delon’s “Le Samouraï” trench. The coat looks expensive (and is expensive, having been made by Ermenegildo Zegna as eagle-eyed viewers will notice), but far from unrealistic an item for the otherwise modest Harry, who doesn’t even have a mobile device to own. \n\n\tThat’s because Harry believes in things that last — as such, the coat invites us to imagine that he’s owned and cared for it for some time. Plus, investing in good clothes isn’t a bad idea for a street thief like Harry, who should want to evade suspicion. He hasn’t always been successful at dodging trouble — that much we pick up from his close relationship with Detective Allan Warren (Giancarlo Esposito, in a gently pensive register).\n\n\tSoon enough, Harry messes with the wrong sort, stealing from a wealthy and well-connected Gen-Z kid from a shady crime family — not that he realizes it at the time. He is the flashy Dylan (an impressive Will Price), comically dressed in an overpriced and oversized tracksuit, versus Harry’s old-world elegance. It doesn’t take long for him to figure out Harry’s whereabouts, once Harry and Ben naively plug in the USB card Harry finds in Dylan’s wallet. (Harry is so clueless about these technological advancements that he can’t even spell USB properly, the kind of comedic flourish Segan’s script leans into.) Once cornered, Harry has no choice but to retrieve the card — he might not be able to save his own life, but he can save his wife’s.\n\n\tHarry’s trek across all five boroughs of New York City gives us a unique taste of the sprawling town that’s been a playground for many legendary films and filmmakers. In that, the New York of “Pickpocket” isn’t the picturesque Central Park, charming brownstone blocks or imposing highrises. Not unlike Sean Baker’s “Anora,” this film navigates and caresses the overlooked corners of arguably the most popular movie town in cinema history, while lamenting an old way of being in urban spaces. \n\t\n\n\tThat means asking for directions instead of using GPS, relying on the generosity of strangers and looking up and around instead of touchscreen scrolling. Along the way, Harry’s race against the clock gradually shifts into a journey of reconciliation, even self-discovery, especially when he takes a detour to visit his estranged daughter Kelly (a scene-stealing Tatiana Maslany) in Queens. The scene plays like a thoughtful aside, giving us just enough (but not too much) backstory, like the rest of the well-calibrated script that leaves some room for audience imagination.\n\n\tThere are some frisky reveals throughout the last act of “Pickpocket,” bouncily assembled by editor Hilda Rasula, as well as a quietly playful cameo by an A-lister as the formidable matriarch of Dylan’s family. But across all of its humor-filled touches, “Pickpocket” mostly preserves its bittersweet, gloomy tone across its economic runtime, a temperament matched by Sam Levy’s beautifully elegiac cinematography. It’s the kind of unapologetically local love letter to the Big Apple and its less-illustrious denizens that New York deserves.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter an old-fashion, multi-day bidding war, Olivia Wilde‘s Sundance darling “The Invite” has sold to A24.\n\n\tA24 and Focus Features were locked in a tense fight for rights to the relationship comedy after other interested buyers, like Neon, Netflix, Apple, Searchlight and new distributor Black Bear, backed out of negotiations. The sale is north of $12 million, according to sources familiar with the terms of the deal. \n\n\n\tWilde reteamed with Megan Ellison’s Annapurna on the project, the studio that made her directorial debut, “Booksmart.” UTA Independent Film Group and FilmNation co-repped the sale.\n\t\n\n\tWilde pushed for a traditional theatrical release for “The Invite,” which she directed and co-stars in with Seth Rogen, Penelope Cruz and Edward Norton. The hilarious ensemble comedy plays out during a dinner party between a couple who are going through a rough patch and their upstairs neighbors, who turn out to be swingers. Rashida Jones and Will McCormack wrote the screenplay, a remake of the Spanish film “The People Upstairs.” CAA reps Wilde and Cruz. UTA reps Rogen, Norton and McCormack and Jones. \n\n\tSo far, it’s been a slow sales market out of the festival’s final hurrah in Park City. (Sundance heads to Boulder in 2027). Neon is closing a sale for the conversion therapy thriller “Leviticus” for a price tag that’s reportedly in the seven-figure range. “Wicker,” a fantasy comedy with Olivia Colman, Peter Dinklage and Alexander Skarsgard, as well as the harrowing drama “Josephine” starring Channing Tatum and Gemma Chan, have also been drawing interest from buyers.\n\t\n\n\t“The Invite” is Wilde’s third directorial effort — she also helmed 2019’s “Booksmart” and 2023’s “Don’t Worry Darling” — and her second film at this year’s festival. She was also at Sundance with director Gregg Araki’s “I Want Your Sex,” an erotic thriller in which she co-stars with Cooper Hoffman.\n\n\tVariety’s chief film critic Owen Gleiberman praised “The Invite” as a “bravura dinner-party dramedy” that “keeps you laughing and never stops surprising.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCopenhagen-based international film sales and aggregation house LevelK has acquired world sales rights to Gunnbjörg Gunnarsdóttir’s “The Pension Heist,” the first feature to benefit from the company’s strategic partnership with audience-insight company Publikum. \n\n\t“The Pension Heist” follows three ageing women as they pull off the seemingly impossible task of robbing the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. The Norwegian release is set for Oct. 16 via SF Studios.\n\t\n\n\tLevelK and Publikum sealed their partnership last year to invest in the strengthening and refining of sales and marketing tools for a selected number of titles. The collaboration is looking to maximize the audience potential of the LevelK slate, with Publikum having already worked with LevelK on major titles such as Berlinale main competition film “Dust,” by Anke Blondé.\n\n\n\t“The Pension Heist” is written by Peder Udnæs (“Milk”) and produced by Jørgen Storm Rosenberg for 74 Entertainment. The film first finds 65-year-old Annema in the aftermath of discovering her husband’s affair. Desperate for money, she enlists two equally broke friends – Nina recently got fired for being too old and Mona needs money for a crucial operation – to concoct a plan to rob the Norwegian Oil Fund. “The Pension Heist” stars Hege Schøyen (“Thomas Vs. Thomas”), Anne Marie Ottersen (“Sex”) and Anette Hoff, who previously collaborated on Gunnarsdóttir in “Victoria Must Go.”\n\n\tLevelK CEO Tine Klint said she “adores” Gunnbjørg’s “colorful directing style and talent for choosing projects that entertain while still carrying a spark of truth.” “‘The Pension Heist’ is a perfect example. It is an action comedy that invites us to laugh with respect and genuine affection at the way we see age and ageing. It’s also a real pleasure to collaborate with Jørgen and Publikum on optimizing all elements surrounding the film.”\n\t\n\n\tTo Rosenberg, mature viewers present both a growing market and “an exciting opportunity.” “‘The Pension Heist’ is set to tap into this demographic by offering relatable, entertaining content that appeals to their interests and experiences.”\n\n\tPublikum CEO Niels Alberg said he believes that “one of the greatest untapped potentials for European film lies in a more seamless collaboration between the film’s artistic and commercial interests and stakeholders.” “We are very pleased that ‘The Pension Heist’ has provided such a strong first experience with this approach. We have greatly valued the collaboration so far and look forward to the next phase of work, which will bring the film even closer to audiences across multiple territories.”\n\n\tDirector Gunnarsdóttir is also a writer and editor known for her bold, character-driven storytelling. Her 2018 feature debut “Forever and Never” established her as a distinctive new voice in Nordic cinema. Gunnarsdóttir also directed the 2018 doc “The Art of Fallism” and 2024’s “Victoria Must Go.” Icelandic-Norwegian, she brings a unique cross-cultural perspective to her films, blending emotional precision with visual flair and colour.\n\n\t“The Pension Heist” is produced by 74 Entertainment, in co-production with Påfilm in Norway, and supported by the Norwegian Film Institute, SF Studios, LevelK, Publikum and Mediefondet Zefyr AS.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMeredith Marks was in the hot seat during the three-part reunion of Season 6 of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” which concluded on Tuesday. Bravo’s reunion host (and the franchise’s executive producer) Andy Cohen pressed Marks throughout — about that infamous airplane ride, her relationship with alcohol and her accusation that cast member Britani Bateman “had supported a bigot.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLeft to right: Britani Bateman, Meredith Marks, Lisa Barlow \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Fred Hayes/Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tOn that last subject, during the reunion’s second episode, after being asked by Cohen whether she’d had a drink before getting on the plane, Marks tried to explain her enmity toward Bateman by bringing up a controversy that viewers hadn’t seen addressed during the season. To summarize the conflagration, which happened before filming Season 6 began, Marks, who is Jewish, had told Bateman to delete a positive review she’d left for a local nail technician who’d been revealed to be an antisemite in an incident that had been covered by the news and was, Marks said, “all over social media.” According to Marks, Bateman had left the review up for a long time — saying “I only saw the one thing, was there more?” — until she finally deleted it, and it caused Marks to be wary of Bateman. At the end of Part 2, Bateman left the stage in tears, saying, “Fuck this!” (For a complete Reddit rundown of this feud, here’s a Megathread.)Over the weekend at the Sundance Film Festival, Variety caught up with Marks, who hosted various events at her store on Main Street in Park City. Before a party celebrating GLAAD, Marks discussed the fallout from the plane incident, where she stands with certain members of the cast, her alcohol intake and her beef with producers. Based on the first two episodes of the reunion, it doesn’t seem like you regret what happened between you and Britani on the plane. Is that accurate?\n\n\tI vented to Lisa. It was the wrong place and the wrong time. Everything I said, I had said to Britani’s face, so I don’t regret saying it. It wasn’t like I was gossiping behind somebody’s back. So, I’m not going be sorry for that. I am not going to apologize for physical actions, because they didn’t happen. There is no video for one reason: Those things did not happen.\n\n\tIt should have been in a different setting. It was wrong, and I apologize for that. I did apologize that Britani’s feelings were hurt by that, because I don’t want to hurt somebody’s feelings. That’s not my intention.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Jocelyn Prescod/Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tWhy didn’t you do what you do best and “disengage”? Why did that TikTok she brought up on the yacht get under your skin?\n\n\tIt was the intention of it all. It was a very obscure TikTok. I couldn’t find it. I had to have it sent to me by someone from production, and it was like a gossip session. It was very obscure. When the episode aired, it had 25 likes. What bothered me was we don’t usually follow little TikTok storylines. So why suddenly are we following that? Why was that OK? That’s why I was so bugged.\n\n\tBritani wants to project her miserable relationship onto me. I’m sick of it. My marriage has come under fire. Yes, we went through a horrible time. I talked about it, but when I am saying things are good now you don’t want to believe me You want to say I’m this crazy liar.What did the TikTok say? That Seth was cheating on you?\n\n\n\tSomething about him being with a woman in an Uber. First of all, let me be very clear, he has never taken an Uber in Ohio. When he was living there part-time, he had a car, and he wasn’t even in Ohio anymore when this Uber thing supposedly happened. Seth has been living and traveling with me over the last year. He’s been working completely remote. That’s what we should have been talking about. That’s the real story here. For the first time in our marriage, we are fully together 24/7.\n\t\n\n\tDuring the reunion, it got heated between you and Heather Gay. She said that your friendship is over. Where do you stand with her now?\n\n\tI say, “You have been screeching at me for the last two months…” and it’s like, you are not my friend ever again. OK. Well then, I guess we weren’t ever friends. That’s what that tells me. I thought we were, so it’s just sad to me. You showed me who you are.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMeredith Marks and Charli xcx \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndieWire via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhere do things stand with you and Bronwyn Newport and Mary Cosby?In terms of Bronwyn, it’s problematic for me because she claims that I didn’t support her marriage when it came up on the boat. I said, “I don’t know what you guys are talking about, but I support you, and I wouldn’t make yourself vulnerable to this right now.” I don’t know what else I was supposed to do. Am I supposed to end my friendship with Lisa because Bronwyn didn’t like what Lisa said about her marriage? Am I supposed to end my friendship with everyone else because they didn’t stand up for me and talked about my marriage, and quite honestly, spread lies about my marriage all season? Bronwyn knew she was lying about that dinner Seth had in New York City. I have text messages from Todd that very clearly say there were four businessmen at that dinner with Seth in New York, and it is abundantly clear that it was a business dinner and nothing else. She needs to own up to it. Apologize. Admit she is a liar. We already knew it with a necklace, and a multitude of other things. This is another big one. You clearly have a problem with the truth. Come clean.\n\n\tAnd Mary?Mary and I seem to be in a good place. I’m just a little confused by her because she always tells me she loves me, and then I got a little bit blindsided by some of the comments she made. But since the reunion, we have been good. I think a lot of the problems that I had with Mary this season were because she has so much going on in her life. Seeing stuff going on with your kid really takes a toll on you, and I’m sure that was her focus. She had all these people in her ear saying, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. They are all telling her all this stuff. So, I feel like they kind of just got in her ear, and quite frankly, she was the only one who appeared to come to me out of concern rather than out trying to hurt me and take me down and defame me. Mary had a genuine concern because people were telling her these things.\nMary brought up Lisa’s hot mic moment from Season 2 when she called you a “whore” who has “fucked half of New York.” How did you move on from those remarks, which were made on camera and can never be erased?It took a while. In Season 3, we were not getting along at all. During Season 4, we started to get along a little bit, but the women were in her ear. Season 4 was another attempt to take me down, completely decimate me and destroy my character. The women were telling Lisa false narratives about me. When you have all these people saying this stuff to you about your friend, at some point, you start believing it. But the thing is, now Lisa and I are onto it, and we’ve agreed that we are not going to let anyone say anything about either of us to the other without talking to each other first. If someone comes to me and says, “Lisa, blah, blah, blah, blah,” my answer is, “I really hope that’s not true. I’ll talk to Lisa.” It’s been an ongoing thing. There are a large number of women who either don’t like me or don’t like Lisa, and are jealous or whatever. I don’t know. I’m not in their head. But for whatever reason, they are looking to isolate us and basically either get us booted off or destroyed.\nRecently on SiriusXM’s Jeff Lewis Live, you told Jeff that you “think it would be great to have a little bit of a cast shakeup. I don’t know what that means for who or what, but I do think it would be positive.” Who would you like to see go?It’s really hard, especially in the second episode of the reunion, where we see the whole other side of the couch voicing their opinions on Britani’s side. But there were people who agreed with my side of the [Britani] story, and we didn’t see that. For me, that is very problematic. It makes me really second-guess what I’m doing here, because these are not small issues. This is not, you bought your jewelry off Alibaba — like, come on. These are big, big issues, and you don’t always get the full story. As much as I have issues with a lot of the women, I hope they all thrive and do well in whatever they’re doing. I don’t feel like I need to knock someone else down to look better. I’ll look good or bad on my very own. I make mistakes all the time and I take accountability for my mistakes. I apologize. What I don’t do is take accountability for things that other people accuse me of that aren’t true, and that happens a lot.\nWould you ever consider being a “friend” of the cast so you don’t have to put your full life on display?No. I wouldn’t be willing [to do] that, and let other people win this argument. Things need to be fair, and we will see how it goes moving forward. I’m really optimistic that things will be more fair next season.\n\n\tYou recently liked Monica Garcia’s post about someone from the cast being taken to the hospital to get their stomach pumped allegedly for alcohol poisoning. Why did you like the post?\n\n\tI don’t do drugs. I’ll have a gummy here and there to sleep. But it’s not my thing. I am not a heavy drinker. Do I have fun here and there? Absolutely. But I’m looking at a woman at the Bronwyn event seven glasses of wine in at 11 in the morning, which was Whitney. She poured seven glasses, and eventually took the bottle back to her chair so that it’s close enough to keep pouring it. I am stone cold sober drinking tea, because it is 11 in the morning. Then Whitney calls me an alcoholic. So, you are going to defame me this way, and we have someone else taken off in an ambulance for alcohol poisoning or whatever?\n\n\tWas that about Heather?\n\n\tI’m not spreading new tea on it. But I liked the post, because Monica’s point was how can we talk about Meredith being an alcoholic? [Monica] has been on the cast; she knows I’m not a heavy drinker. But there are people who are heavy drinkers on this cast. I don’t know what else they do, it’s not my concern. But don’t put your finger at me when I’m one of the light drinkers on the cast.\n\n\tYou told Jeff Lewis you recently spoke to Jen Shah. Are you friendly with her now?\n\n\tI don’t know where Jen and I are at. We had a very tumultuous relationship. I do believe in second chances. Whether I ever have any relationship with her or not, I hope she is turning things around. She’s obviously served her time. I hope that she pays her restitution. I am pretty sure she started on down that path. I think Sharif was doing that while she was in prison. They are trying to right her wrongs. I hope she contributes something positive to society. Just because you made a mistake, no matter how big it is, it doesn’t mean you can’t turn things around. And I hope she does. I don’t know what that means between her and I. Obviously, if she doesn’t turn things around, there’s nowhere to go, but I’m rooting for her to do well in her life. Whether that means I have a part of it or not, I have no idea.\n\n\tAndy Cohen has said that she would never be on the show again.\n\n\tNot to ever speak for Andy because I’m not in his head at all, but I would guess that if she did actually pay all her restitution back and there was a positive ending to this story, he would be a little more interested. I don’t know though. I’m not Andy.\n\t\n\n\tIn the third episode of the reunion it is revealed that you and production had problems this season. Why?\n\n\tThat’s what I mean by the TikTok. [The cast] is repeatedly told that we don’t follow social media stories: It’s ruining the show. But when it comes to me, we are following it. Why are we following a story of false accusations of substance abuse, but not following the truth? That was my real issue. I told my producers that I will take a drug test every single day. You are going to do damage to me, and there’s no way to prove it wrong. But they aired it.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Natalie Cass/Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBoth Whitney and Bronwyn were very open during the season about how they might want marriages that are less typical than the usual monogamous ones that we see. You and Seth have been clear that you lived separate lives for a while. Do you still not have a typical marriage?\n\n\tWe never had an open marriage. We separated, and we weren’t together. But then we got back together. I know a lot of people who live in an open marriage and are very, very happy. It’s just not for me. I’m not knocking it. But it would not work for me. That would make me crazy.\n\n\tDo you think that Britani is antisemitic?\n\t\n\n\tI have no idea. All I can say is she supported one, and she did not take that [post] down immediately. It was up for a while. I have messages and voice memos that somebody sent to her that she should probably take it down, but she had to talk to Bravo to see what the right thing to do is. It wasn’t about the fact that she wrote the Google review, because even though it was on the news, obviously it’s possible she didn’t see it. The problem was how she handled it once it was brought to her attention, and she answered with, “Maybe I’ll take it down, I have to talk to Bravo.” That’s where I ran into a problem, and I was like, “Whoa.” So, do I think she’s an antisemite? I have no idea. I know she supported an antisemite.\n\n\tAnd what’s your response to Heather saying you lied about her mocking Bronwyn for kissing a girl?\n\n\tI didn’t lie. That’s what Bronwyn told me. I wasn’t there.\n\n\tHow was meeting Charli xcx at Sundance?\n\n\tOh my gosh, she’s amazing! She was so cool. I was just mad I didn’t have my Meredith Marks Caviar to give her, because I play her song during my DJ set.\n\n\tHow’s the DJing going?\n\t\n\n\tSo fun. It’s been, like, the best thing I’ve ever done in my life.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Welcome to BravoCon DJ Set with Meredith Marks” — Andy Cohen, Meredith Marks at Caesars Forum in Las Vegas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Griffin Nagel/Bravo via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n",

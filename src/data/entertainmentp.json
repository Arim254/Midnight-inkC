    "body": "\n\tDisney’s animated sequel “Zootopia 2” continued to tower over the Korean box office, delivering $6.7 million from more than 1 million admissions over the Dec. 12–14 frame. According to KOBIS, the tracking service operated by the Korean Film Council, the film now stands at a commanding $35.2 million cumulative gross since its Nov. 26 debut, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the weekend’s total market share.\n\n\tLocal comedy-drama “The People Upstairs” held firmly in second place, adding $948,236 to lift its total to $2.6 million after two weekends in release. The film drew 140,352 admissions across 768 screens, remaining the strongest Korean performer in the chart. Directed by Ha Jung-woo and starring Gong Hyo-jin, Kim Dong-wook, Lee Ha-nee and Ha Jung-woo himself, the film follows a downstairs couple driven to exhaustion by constant noise from their upstairs neighbours. A tense dinner meant to resolve the issue quickly unravels into an evening of sharp confessions and shifting dynamics.\n\t\n\n\tFamily fare “Pororo the Movie: Sweet Castle Adventure” opened in third with $449,879 from 74,435 admissions, narrowly edging out Universal’s horror sequel “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” which collected $449,123 and pushed its cumulative tally to $1.2 million.\n\n\n\tJapanese action-fantasy “Jujutsu Kaisen: Shibuya Incident / Culling Game – The Movie” followed in fifth, earning $405,974 for a running total of $2 million. Directed by Shōta Goshozono, the film condenses the anime’s Shibuya Incident arc as Yuji Itadori and his allies face a coordinated curse attack on Halloween. The aftermath sets up the looming Culling Game and Yuta Okkotsu’s mission that puts Yuji’s fate in jeopardy.\n\t\n\n\tIn sixth place, “Wicked: For Good” added $224,840, bringing its Korean total to $6.4 million. “The Running Man” placed seventh with $115,810 in its second weekend.\n\n\tSouth Korean crime comedy “The Informant” slipped to eighth, grossing $86,310 for a cumulative $916,697. Directed by Kim Seok, the film stars Heo Sung-tae and Jo Bok-rae as a compromised smuggling informant and a hapless detective who blunders into the operation. Forced into an uneasy alliance after both take substantial losses, the pair attempt to claw their way back while dismantling the criminal ring.\n\n\tIllusionist sequel “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” followed with $81,568, lifting its total to $8.7 million.\n\n\tRounding out the top 10, Japanese filmmaker Miyake Sho’s Locarno Golden Leopard winner “Two Seasons, Two Strangers” earned $80,278, bringing its cumulative gross to $136,275. Drawing from Tsuge Yoshiharu’s 1967 and 1968 short stories, the film follows a screenwriter named Lee (played by Korean actress Shim Eun-kyung) as she embarks on contrasting seasonal journeys — a summer encounter at a seaside town and a winter retreat to a remote mountain lodge.\n\n\tThe top 10 films collectively grossed $9.5 million over the Dec. 12–14 weekend, down from the previous frame’s $12.1 million.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Fallout” is coming back for round two earlier than expected.\n\n\tOn Monday, Amazon revealed the second season of its “Fallout” TV series will debut Tuesday, Dec. 16 at 6 p.m. PT — one day earlier than the previously announced Dec. 17 release.\n\n\tAmazon broke the news of the “Fallout” Season 2 release date shift via a collaboration with the Exosphere of Sphere in Las Vegas, which it described as “bringing an element of the season’s journey to New Vegas to life by turning Sphere into a post-apocalyptic snow globe featuring series’ fan-favorite characters Lucy, Maximus and The Ghoul, and surprising with a monstrously large Deathclaw attempting to break through the Exosphere.”\n\t\n\n\tPer Amazon’s description for “Fallout” Season 2, the new episodes pick up after Season 1’s epic finale and take audiences along for a journey through the wasteland of the Mojave to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas. \n\n\n\t“Fallout” Season 2 stars Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Walton Goggins, Kyle MacLachlan, Moisés Arias and Frances Turner.\n\n\tBased on the Bethesda Game Studios video game franchise of the same name, the “Fallout” TV series is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there’s almost nothing left to have. Two-hundred years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind—and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them.\n\n\t“Fallout” hails from creators and showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner, who executive produce alongside Kilter Films’ Jonathan Nolan, Lisa Joy and Athena Wickham, and Todd Howard of Bethesda Game Studios and James Altman for Bethesda Softworks. Margot Lulick also executive produces. Amazon MGM Studios and Kilter Films produce in association with Bethesda Game Studios and Bethesda Softworks.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“One Battle After Another” will soon become available to watch at home. The Paul Thomas Anderson movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio will debut on HBO Max on Dec. 19.\n\n\tStarring DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Teyana Taylor, Regina Hall, Benicio del Toro and Chase Infiniti, “One Battle After Another” follows a washed-up revolutionary who must save his teenage daughter after she’s kidnapped by a merciless army officer. The film is loosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s 1990 novel “Vineland.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter premiering on Sept. 26, “One Battle After Another” received huge critical praise for its story, direction and performances. It’s expected to be a major Oscar frontrunner at next year’s awards show and recently picked up an industry-leading 9 nominations at the Golden Globes, including best picture.\n\n\n\tIn Variety’s review, chief film critic Owen Gleiberman called “One Battle After Another” a “mesmerizing vision of a police-state America” and praised Anderson for delivering “the kind of twists and turns that feed the audience, giving us the childlike sensation that we have no idea what’s coming next.”\n\n\tGleiberman went on to name “One Battle” the best movie of 2025, writing: “Paul Thomas Anderson’s greatest film since ‘Boogie Nights’ is a dystopian adventure of hair-raising relevance and haunting desperation. It’s at once a political thriller, a bravura chase movie, a world-turned-upside-down satire, a movingly fraught father-daughter love story — and, more than that, a movie that plants us in the paranoid cave of anxiety that is life in an autocratic society, in this case one that uncannily mirrors what’s happening to our own Disunited States.”\n\t\n\n\t“One Battle After Another” has earned $204 million worldwide at the box office, making it the highest-grossing movie of Anderson’s directorial career. \n",

    "body": "\n\tLaura Fernández Espeso, a major driver of Grup Mediapro dramatic international expansion over the last decade, is leaving the company where she took up the post of its general manager in January 2025. \n\n\tFernández Espeso’s departure is understood to be amicable, and is part of a more general managerial restructuring at Grup Mediapro.  \n\n\tJoining the Mediapro-owned Globomedia in 2009, Fernández Espeso, one of just a handful of executives in Spain with real TV work experience abroad, was named Grup Mediapro’s director of international content in 2015, just as international’s TV high-end drama revolution began to lift off, driving Grup Mediapro’s expansion abroad. \n\t\n\n\tAppointed corporate and TV director at The Mediapro Studio, housing Mediapro’s content business, which launched 2019, she became its CEO a year later. \n\n\n\tUnder Fernández Espeso, The Mediapro Studio drove hard into top-notch creative talent, tapping Israel’s Ran Tellem, a primetime Emmy Award-winning executive producer on “Homeland,” and a year later Daniel Burman, a leading light of the New Argentine Cinema, buying into his label Oficina Burman, in Buenos Aires.  \n\n\tFurther moves have included the launch of j.v Moonlyon with Penelope Cruz, the purchase of Latin American services and production company Cimarrón, and backing for Erik Barmack’s L.A.-based Wild Sheep Content. \n\n\tMediapro has also proved a pioneering force in international TV alliances, co-producing or linking to major broadcasters and studios on a score and more of series, on Wildside’s “The Young Pope” and “The New Pope” with Sky and HBO, the first also with Canal+;  with Viacom (“Victoria Small”) on four series, Prime Video (“The Boarding School: Las Cumbres”) and Hulu Japan (“The Head”).\n\t\n\n\tSony Pictures Television (“Implacables: Mexico”), Lionsgate+ (“Express), Warner Bros. Discovery (“Las Bravas”), BBC Studios and ZDF (“The Famous Five”), Movistar Plus+ (“Celeste”) and TelevisaUnivision’s ViX (“Las Pelotaris”) were further co-production partners, when Fernández Espeso served at The Mediapro Studio.\n\n\tBy the time Fernández Espeso was chosen as Variety’s International Media Woman of the Year in March 2024,  The Mediapro Studio was one of the biggest production-distribution global powerhouses based out of Southern Europe with an H.Q. in Madrid and 53 offices spread around the world. \n\n\tIn May 2024 it announced new U.S. headquarters in Los Angeles to double down on U.S. and English-language production for the U.S. and global market, under “J.C.” Acosta.\n\n\tAt The Mediapro Studio, Fernández Espeso was in her element: Content creation in a globalized context is her passion. \n\n\tUnder the majority ownership of Southwind Group, which houses China’s Hontai Capital, Grup Mediapro’s main challenge currently, the loss of a keystone contract to produce and transmit soccer games with La Liga, is of another order. \n\n\tHontai Capital has appointed Sergio Oslé, ex-president of Movistar Plus+, who laid many of the foundations of its current subscriber resilience, such as a lower-cost SVOD offer, as Grup Mediapro’s new president from Jan. 2026. A close ally of Javier Tebas when at Movistar Plus+, Oslé worked hand in hand to modernize soccer broadcasts in Spain.\n\n\tFernández Espeso’s next appointment is unknown, but is unlikely to take her far from international content creation. \n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump commented on the shocking death of legendary film director Rob Reiner, who was found dead Sunday in his Brentwood home alongside his wife Michele Singer.\n\n\tTrump blasted Reiner, who was strongly opposed to Trump’s politics and was a noted supporter of Democratic causes, as having “Trump Derangement Syndrome” in a post on social media Monday.\n\n\tTrump wrote in a post on Truth Social: “A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood. Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.”\n\t\n\n\tThe U.S. president continued: “He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before. May Rob and Michele rest in peace!”\n\n\tVariety has reached out to the White House for any additional comment.\n\n\tAmong Reiner’s remarks opposing Trump and his policies, the late director said in a recent interview with MSNBC that the U.S. is danger of becoming an “autocracy” if Trump is allowed to “control the media.”\n\n\t“Make no mistake; we have a year before this country becomes a full-on autocracy, and democracy completely leaves us,” Reiner told MSNBC (since renamed MS NOW) in October. “And we’re looking at the election in 2026, and Donald Trump knows that in a free and fair election, he will lose. He will lose the House, the House will flip and will become in Democratic hands. There will be committee chairs who will be able to hold meetings, and this is the last thing he wants.”\n\t\n\n\tThe deaths of Reiner and Singer are being investigated as a homicide, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The couple was reported to have been stabbed to death.\n\n\tNick Reiner, the 32-year-old son of the couple, was arrested Sunday night at 9:15 p.m. and booked on a felony charge on Monday at 5:04 a.m., according to LAPD online records. The LAPD could not confirm to Variety whether Nick Reiner is in custody related to the homicide investigation into the deaths of Rob and Michele but listed Nick’s booking description as “gang activity.” His bail has been set at $4 million.\n",

    "body": "\n\tComedy group Smosh is scrubbed in for its next live digital special: “Smosh Hospital,” a spoof of TV medical dramas like “The Pitt,” “Grey’s Anatomy” and “E.R.”\n\n\t“Smosh Hospital” is billed as a one-night-only, fully improvised medical-drama parody — in which the scripted “doctors” walk into each scene with no idea what they are about to face and react in real time to whatever chaotic cases the “patients” throw at them. The 90-minute “Smosh Hospital” livestream will take place on Friday, Jan. 16, starting at 6 p.m. PT, exclusively on live.smosh.com. Tickets, available now on the site, cost $19.99 and include a copy of last year’s “Smosh: The Sitcom Live!“\n\t\n\n\tThe lead doctor and nurse characters are double-cast: If the primary actor breaks character or otherwise makes a mistake, they will be replaced by their second. The actors playing the doctors will be doing their best to pull off an intense medical drama — while those portraying the patients will be doing everything they can to break them. \n\n\n\t“We’re beyond excited to bring the next installment of Smosh Live, ‘Smosh Hospital,’ to fans,” said Smosh CEO Alessandra Catanese. “Our live shows have been so well received and ‘Smosh Hospital’ leans even further into what makes Smosh, Smosh. Lots of energy, big characters and unforgettable moments. It’s a core part of our expanded strategy to deliver fun, immersive experiences that bring our community together.”\n\n\t“Smosh Hospital” stars Tommy Bowe and Arasha Lalani (as Doctor Boone); Courtney Miller and Shayne Topp (as Nurse O’Connell); Ian Hecox and Angela Giarratana (as Doctor Condo); and Olivia Sui and Trevor Evarts (as Doctor Green). The show will include special appearances from Smosh cast members Amanda Lehan-Canto, Anthony Padilla, Chanse McCrary, Damien Haas, Keith Leak, Noah Grossman and Spencer Agnew, who will play unruly patients and medical “experts.”\n\t\n\n\tExpect “line-breaking character swaps, wild patient scenarios and a steady build of chaos as the episode unfolds,” Smosh says. The show is built on the fan response of “Smosh: The Sitcom Live!”, featuring a bigger cast and “more unpredictable setups.”\n\n\t“Smosh Hospital” has been in the works for several months, and “it’s undoubtedly the most ambitious project I’ve ever worked on,” said creative director Shayne Topp. “This show will have everything: suspense, improv, love triangles, betrayal, a cowboy, life or death decisions, and that’s just the first 10 minutes. I have honestly no idea what’s going to happen, but that’s the fun of it.”\n\n\tSmosh, which touts itself as the internet’s longest-running digital sketch comedy brand, was founded in 2005 by childhood friends Padilla and Hecox. The duo split up in 2017 and Smosh subsequently was sold in 2019 to Rhett & Link’s Mythical Entertainment. Hecox and Padilla acquired control in Smosh in 2023, with Mythical retaining a minority stake.\n\n\tWatch the “Smosh Hospital” trailer:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrench President Emmanuel Macron has given the prestigious Legion of Honor to Darren Star, the creator of “Emily in Paris.”\n\n\tStar was named Knight of the Legion of Honor today during an intimate ceremony attended by Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, among others. Even before he made “Emily in Paris,” Star was already famous in France for having delivered many iconic shows from the 1990s, notably “Sex and the City,” “Melrose Place” and “Beverly Hills 90210.”\n\t\n\n\tMacron, whose wife Brigitte had a cameo in Season 4 of “Emily in Paris,” spoke to Variety about his love for the show, praising it for highlighting France’s soft power and the finest things that the country has to offer. He also pledged to “fight hard” to make sure the show will remain in Paris when he found out Season 5 was going to take place in Rome. “’Emily in Paris’ in Rome doesn‘t make sense,” Macron had said, sparking a feud with the mayor of Rome. As Macron pointed out in his speech, as much as “38% of tourists mentioned the series as one of their motivations for coming to Paris,” according to last year’s report from the National Film Board (CNC).\n\n\n\tIn his speech today, Macron also called Star an “exceptional showrunner. A creator of iconic shows that make millions of viewers laugh, dream and even understand themselves a little better.”\n\n\tThe French president said the show depicts Emily falling in love with Paris, “despite the cultural clashes you portray with such wit, the touch of French arrogance you manage to make charming and those language quirks that never fail to challenge beginners.”\n\t\n\n\tMacron also paid tribute to Sarandos, who has been an ally on several fronts. Sarandos took part earlier this year in Macron’s summit, Choose France, which is dedicated to promoting the country’s attractiveness to draw investments.\n\n\t“I would like to salute Ted Sarandos, who is with us today and who has helped make your creation such a success. And all the show’s team, the director, French and American actors in the casting,” Macron said, pointing out that the total viewing time that “Emily in Paris” has generated on Netflix since 2023 amounts to “1 billion hours.”\n\n\tHe said Star “made this series your love letter to France,” adding: “You, who always dreamt of living in Paris. You, who share with Emily a love for our architecture, our history, our fashion, our gastronomy.”\n\n\t“You make France shine across the world. In every episode signed Darren Star, the City of Light sparkles — as do Champagne, Normandy, the Riviera and the Alps — making these places come alive just as vividly as the characters on screen,” Macron added.\n\n\tStar will be attending the premiere for Season 5 of the show tonight in Paris, alongside the beloved cast including Lily Collins, Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, Ashley Park, Lucas Bravo, Lucien Laviscount, Eugenio Franceschini and Minnie Driver.\n\n\tOther Hollywood figures who have been inducted Knights of the Legion of Honor include Tom Cruise and Denis Villeneuve. \n",

    "body": "\n\tChina’s box office was once again led by Disney’s “Zootopia 2,” which grossed RMB390.3 million ($55 million) over the Dec. 12–14 frame, lifting its cumulative total to RMB3.55 billion ($500.6 million), according to Artisan Gateway.\n\n\tThe animated sequel comfortably held the No. 1 position, accounting for the bulk of a weekend that continued to be dominated by holdovers and locally produced titles further down the chart.\n\n\n\tDaylight Entertainment’s “Gezhi Town” remained in second place, adding $10.2 million in its second weekend for a running total of $43 million. Directed by Kong Sheng and written by Lan Xiaolong, the film tells the story of displaced civilians who, after the fall of Nanjing during wartime, resettle in a remote mountain town near Yichang only to find peace shattered when Japanese forces arrive. The lead cast includes Xiao Zhan, Zhou Yi Ran and Peng Yu Chang among others.\n\t\n\n\tEmperor Motion Pictures’ “Under Current” placed third with $1.2 million, bringing its cumulative to $3.1 million. Directed by Alan Mak and starring Aaron Kwok, Simon Yam and Francis Ng, the Hong Kong crime thriller centres on a barrister and a police officer who team up to investigate the suspicious death of a charity organisation’s finance chief — exposing corruption and money-laundering at the heart of the group.\n\n\tLionsgate Films’ “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” earned $700,000 for a $39.7 million total. Chinese auteur Jia Zhangke’s acclaimed 2015 drama “Mountains May Depart,” reissued by Shanghai Film Group, rounded out the top five with $400,000. \n\t\n\n\tThe weekend box office reached $70.1 million. China’s year-to-date box office now stands at $7.08 billion, up 22.7% compared with the same period in 2024.\n",

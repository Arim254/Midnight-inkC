    "body": "<div><p>\n\tA multi-part animated film adaptation of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/batman/\">Batman</a>: Knightfall” is currently in production, <em>Variety</em> has learned.  </p>\n<p>\n\tThe announcement was made at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/new-york-comic-con-2/\">New York Comic-Con</a> at the end of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/warner-bros-animation/\">Warner Bros. Animation</a> panel “The Art Knight: Batman in Animation.” The first part of”Batman: Knightfall” is slated to debut in 2026, with an exact premiere date to be announced at a later time. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe film is based on the Batman comic book arc of the same name that was released in three parts between 1993 and 1994. It was created by Doug Moench, Chuck Dixon, Alan Grant, Dennis O’Neil, Peter David, Jo Duffy, Jim Aparo, Graham Nolan, Norm Breyfogle, and Jim Balent.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is widely regarded as one of the best Batman stories of all time. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe official logline states, “When the mysterious behemoth known only as Bane frees Batman’s entire Rogue’s Gallery from Arkham Asylum, the Caped Crusader is pushed to his mental and physical breaking point.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Batman: Knightfall Part 1: Knightfall” is directed by Jeff Wamester and written by Jeremy Adams. Rick Morales serves as supervising producer alongside producers Jim Krieg and Kimberly S. Moreau. Sam Register and Michael Uslan are executive producers.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Knightfall” has never been directly adapted for the screen, though it has been referenced in numerous Batman projects over the years. Perhaps most famously, elements of the storyline were incorporated into the film “The Dark Knight Rises” starring Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Tom Hard as Bane. </p>\n<p>\n\tPrevious Batman animated films include “Batman: Death in the Family,” “Batman: The Killing Joke,” and “Batman: Under the Red Hood.” </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tWith the French box office <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/french-box-office-drops-first-half-2025-1236464575/\">down for nine consecutive months</a>, local exhibitors are facing their first financial crisis since the pandemic; and one they hadn’t seen coming after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/france-box-office-2024-europe-healthiest-market-1236262703/#:~:text=Elsa%20Keslassy,-International%20Correspondent&text=After%20surging%20back%20from%20the,National%20Film%20Board%20(CNC).\">a milestone 2024 </a>which positioned France as Europe’s healthiest theatrical market.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn most other countries, that sudden turmoil would have translated into a wave of cinemas shuttering, but in France, where the film industry benefits from a strong support system, the National Film Board (CNC) has come up with a targeted scheme to rescue small- and medium-sized exhibitors.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tUnder the initiative, which was first outlined during the Congres des Exploitants (an annual convention for French exhibitors) at the end of September, the CNC will provide immediate cash flow to struggling independent operators who are facing liquidity issues or potential bankruptcy. The interesting thing with that plan is that the funds won’t come from the state budget, but rather from a levy on theatrical admissions that the CNC collects from exhibitors and saves up for them. The CNC will therefore be issuing cash advances to exhibitors in need from their savings and unlike with subsidies, those advances will have to be repaid by exhibitors.</p>\n<p>\n\tRichard Patry, who presides over the National Federation of Cinemas (FNCF) and sits on the board of the Cannes Film Festival, pointed out that time is of the essence for the CNC to enact a rescue plan as many exhibitors are now on the brink of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We are in a very difficult period for cinema. I’ve never seen such a long and severe crisis in the many years I’ve worked in this sector,” Patry tells <em>Variety.</em> “Before mid-September, we were in an uninterrupted eight-month period of declining attendance, down 15%. We’re missing between 15 and 20 million viewers.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe says exhibitors have been alerting the FNCF since July about their situation. “We’ve received testimonies telling us, ‘I can’t do it anymore, I’m not going to make it, I’m at risk of filing for bankruptcy, I’m at risk of going into receivership,’ for months now,” he says.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe most affected are the independent exhibitors who invested heavily in 2019-2020, ahead of the pandemic, when the market was much healthier than it is today, and now find themselves in situations of over-indebtedness.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut even multiplexes have been feeling the pinch. Both Pathé and UGC, which run leading cinema chains in France, have recently welcomed new shareholders, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/pathe-shareholder-rodolphe-saade-cannes-festival-1236393950/\">shipping billionaire Rodolphe Saadé</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/canal-minority-stake-studio-ugc-1236505026/\">Canal+ Group</a> (owned by another billionaire, Vincent Bolloré), respectively.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The fact that they’re investing in cinemas means that they believe in them, but if they are doing so now, it’s also because these big chains were also in difficulty and shared some of same struggles as the independents,” Patry said. </p>\n<p>\n\tFor Comscore France head Eric Marti, the box office drop is mainly connected to the film selection that has failed to lure moviegoers over the summer, with the exception of Universal Pictures’ “How to Train Your Dragon” and Apple’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/f1-the-movie/\">F1: The Movie</a>.” Even those performances pale in comparison with last year’s bullish B.O. which was bolstered by a trio of local blockbusters, “A Little Something Extra,” “The Count of Monte Cristo” and “Beating Hearts.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“At the end of September, we had about 111 million admissions, that’s a 13% year-on drop on 2024 and is down 18% on 2023,” Marti said. </p>\n<p>\n\tPatry, meanwhile, argues the box office crisis results from a “perfect storm” of market conditions. Besides the skyrocketing energy costs that have dramatically increased utility bills for exhibitors, he noted the difficulty in enticing back regular filmgoers after the pandemic when theaters were closed for 300 days. While there’s been a recent resurgence in attendance from younger audiences, he says getting older demographics back into theaters has become a challenge. </p>\n<p>\n\tThere’s still hope, however, that the last quarter will revert the downward trend with a bunch of anticipated releases, including U.S. tentpoles such as Disney’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zootopia/\">Zootopia</a> 2″ and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Patry and Marti are also enthused by the promising French releases coming up, including “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/dog-51/\">Dog 51</a>,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/cedric-jimenez/\">Cedric Jimenez</a>‘s dystopian movie from Studiocanal which will even get an IMAX rollout; as well as Jan Kounen’s “Shrinking Man” from UGC; Éric Besnard’s “Jean Valjean” from Studio TF1; and Alexandre Astier’s “Kaamelott Part 2” from SND.</p>\n</div>",

In an effort to encourage his listeners to shop local, Young called out the corporation in a post published to his website on Oct. 8.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Forget Amazon and Whole Foods. Forget Facebook,” Young said on <a href=\"https://neilyoungarchives.com/news/1/article?id=Amazon%20No\" target=\"_blank\">the Neil Young Archives website</a>. “Buy local. Buy direct. Bezos supports this government. It does not support you or me.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYoung, long one of the most outspoken figures in rock, has been a critic of President Donald Trump for years. Last month, Young penned a song called “Big Crime” that calls out “fascists” and includes the line, “There’s big crime in D.C. at the White House.” He also occasionally publishes commentary on politics, the entertainment industry and other global issues on the Neil Young Archives.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The time is here, forget Amazon,” he continued. “It is easy to buy local. Support your community.<br />Go to the local store. Don’t go back to the big corporations who have sold out America. We all have to give up something to save America from the Corporate Control Age it is entering. They need you to buy from them. Don’t.”</p>\n<p>\n\tYoung previously pulled his from Spotify after he claimed the platform was enabling podcasts like Joe Rogan’s to spread misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines. Back in August, Young also announced that he was leaving Facebook over the company’s AI chatbot. </p>\n<p>\n\tHe ended his message on Wednesday writing: “[Amazon] needs you to buy from them. Don’t. They shut down our government your income your safety your family’s health security. Take America Back together, stop buying from the big corporations support local business. Do the right thing. Show who you are.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt remains unclear whether Young is removing his digital music library from Amazon Music or if he is also enforcing removal of products from Amazon. </p>\n<p>\n\tRepresentatives of Amazon Music and Neil Young did not immediately return<em> Variety</em>‘s requests for comment. </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThere’s no denying that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift/\">Taylor Swift</a> has changed the face of football — or its fandom at least. Ever since the pop megastar appeared at a Kansas City Chiefs game in September 2023 to root on her new beau, tight end Travis Kelce, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nfl/\">NFL</a> viewership among young women has skyrocketed. Games where Miss Americana is spotted regularly spike in all female demographics, from teens to college age to the over-35 set, per Nielsen and NBC ratings. With the power couple announcing their engagement in August, it’s likely the influx of new football fans will only grow — and the NFL ecosystem is shifting to serve this passionate female base. Here’s how football is enticing more women to tune in (and spend money).\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tTaking the Field \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tFrom refs to scouts to iPad-toting assistants, on-field jobs are increasingly being filled by women. This season, 358 women hold coaching and football operations jobs in the league, up from just 92 in 2020. “The goal is normalization and balance,” Sam Rapoport, NFL diversity and inclusion consultant and creator of NFL Women’s Forum, says. “I’m not a big proponent for ‘The future is female.’ I think the future is balanced.” This is in line with the increased interest the league is seeing from women: Figures from a 2025 SSRS Sports Poll show that 47% of the U.S. NFL fan base is female, and women represent 40% of the league’s international growth. \n</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAds Aren’t Just for Men \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tYes, the lion’s share of ads running during NFL games still sell light beer, sports betting and junk food. But eagle-eyed viewers noticed some spots during Week 1 that bucked bro-centric convention. Pampers was an advertiser during the first week of Sunday games, targeting the women viewers who invariably do the majority of shopping for babies. Hyundai also debuted a Palisade ad starring Parker Posey during the season’s first game, banking on the “White Lotus” star’s charisma as opposed to football-ad staples like retired athletes and comedians. “When you think of families, they influence about 80% of the car-buying decisions,” Kate Fabian, marketing communications director for Hyundai Motor America, says. “So it’s important for us to connect with women. The NFL is the biggest cultural stage in many aspects. It’s where families and communities come together.” \n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tA New Voice\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tKate Scott made NFL history as the first woman to call a regular-season game for Westwood One, the official radio partner of the league, on Sept. 28. “It’s an incredible honor. I grew up listening to football on the radio with my dad,” Scott says. And the giant step for representation isn’t lost on her. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I carry so many women that I’ve met over the years with me when I’m in a broadcast booth, because I know that so many women before me would have loved to do this, but it was too soon,” she says. “They were ahead of their time.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the response from men? “Some are very honest and tell me, ‘I hated you at first, but my daughter is paying a lot more attention to the sport now,’” Scott says. “There’s going to always be people who doubt that you can do it simply because you are a woman,” she adds. “So work hard and prove them wrong.” </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tFashion Meets Fan Base \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tMerchandise isn’t just the ultimate expression of team loyalty but also big business, bringing in billions of dollars for the NFL. For some female fans, however, the styles for women leave something to be desired.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Everything I have, I purchased from the men’s section, because I didn’t wear the type of stuff they had for women,” says Zara Terez Tisch, whose clothing line Terez aims to move sports apparel in a different direction. Tisch is now partnering with the NFL to produce officially licensed gear. The league’s collaboration with Off Season also came about organically: Co-founder Kristin Juszczyk was making custom game day apparel for players’ wives, then created a jacket for Swift — and the rest is history. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I never knew I wanted to even be in the sports category, but our mission has always been about bringing people together,” Tisch says. “In the male-dominated industries, we need to celebrate the women behind the athletes, the women at home, the women in the field and the women on the team.” </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mark-hamill/\">Mark Hamill</a> has spent nearly five decades in the spotlight, but the actor insists he’s still learning to disappear.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The definition of a character actor is an actor that disappears, and you see only the character,” Hamill says about his role in Mike Flanagan’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-life-of-chuck/\">The Life of Chuck</a>,” which won the Toronto International Film Festival Audience Award in 2024 before being acquired by Neon. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Flanagan’s adaptation of Stephen King’s novella, Hamill plays an aging accountant — an intimate and surprising departure from the larger-than-life characters that made him famous, such as Luke Skywalker from the “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/star-wars/\">Star Wars</a>” series. The film, which stars Tom Hiddleston, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Karen Gillan, explores memory, mortality and the marks we leave behind.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOne thing about Hamill, he knows how to keep a secret.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore playing accountants and voicing cartoon villains, Hamill kept one of Hollywood’s biggest secrets. While filming “The Empire Strikes Back” in 1978, director Irvin Kershner pulled the actor aside with news of a script change.</p>\n<p>\n\t“’I’m going to tell you something. I <em>know </em>it. George Lucas <em>knows </em>it, and when I tell you, you’ll know it,’” Hamill recalls Kershner saying. “So, if it leaks, we’ll know it’s <em>you</em>.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe original script had Darth Vader telling Luke Skywalker that Obi-Wan Kenobi killed his father. But Kershner revealed the new line: “I am your father.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The hard part was I had to keep that secret for over a year and a half,” Hamill says. He kept it so well that Harrison Ford, sitting in front of him at the premiere screening, turned around and said, “You didn’t even tell me.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHamill said the original twist would have been compelling on its own. “That is a great twist, if it turns out that he didn’t present himself honestly and he was a villain.” Nonetheless, the father’s revelation became “one of the all-time great twists” in cinema history.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile “Star Wars” made Hamill a household name, voice-over work gave him artistic freedom. His portrayal of the Joker in “Batman: The Animated Series” became definitive for fans of the popular TV series.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Nobody believed it was me,” Hamill says. He would do the voice for people at grocery stores, seeing their reactions to his Joker voice. The role became a turning point in his career, showing him a world where physical appearance didn’t limit his casting opportunities.</p>\n<p>\n\tHamill is passionate about animation as a medium. He argued that voice acting offers liberation from physical constraints while requiring the same emotional depth as on-camera work.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe laughs when asked about his 2021 Emmy win for his guest role in the animated series “Regular Show.” “I’ve never even seen it,” he admits. “I was thrilled, of course — who doesn’t like getting an award? But it was one of those surreal moments where you go, ‘Wait, for what exactly?’ It just shows how unpredictable this business is. You can work your whole life chasing one kind of recognition, and then it sneaks up on you from something you barely remember doing.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBetween “Star Wars” films, Hamill spent a decade on Broadway seeking character roles that would let him disappear into someone else. He played Mozart in “Amadeus” and the sleazy Gordon Miller in “Room Service,” earning critical acclaim. Despite not having plans to return to the stage, Hamill considers theater essential. “The audience is different every night, and they are a major part of a theatrical experience.” </p>\n<p>\n\tAsked about Tilly Norwood, the AI-generated “actress” reportedly in talks to be signed by talent agencies, Hamill’s tone shifts to alarm.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s terrifying,” he says. “After I pass away, are they going to go to my family and say, ‘We’ll pay you all this money so we can do him at age 28’ or whatever they do?”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe compared the development to ads featuring deceased performers, such as Gene Kelly. “Would Gene have wanted to be a spokesman for a vacuum cleaner? I don’t know,” Hamill says. “It’s too many unanswered questions.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe actor called AI performers “terrible,” “ghastly,” “ghoulish” and “weird,” struggling to articulate concerns that felt beyond comprehension.</p>\n<p>\n\tNonetheless, working on “The Life of Chuck” compelled Hamill to confront questions of his own legacy and memory in ways his blockbuster work had not. His wife has told him “The Life of Chuck” is her favorite thing he has ever done. For an actor who has played icons, voiced villains and wielded lightsabers, that verdict from someone who knows him best is what brings him immense joy.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I wouldn’t be sitting here talking about it if it weren’t for Mike Flanagan,” Hamill says passionately. The director thought outside the box in casting him, offering “a small but distinctive character part” that terrified him precisely because he couldn’t immediately figure out who the character was.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat uncertainty brought Hamill back to what drew him to acting in the first place: the opportunity to look in the mirror and not recognize himself.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn this week’s episode of the <em>Variety </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/awards-circuit-podcast/\">Awards Circuit Podcast</a><em>,</em> Hamill reflects on his career, the joy of working on “The Life of Chuck,” and the stories that continue to make him one of Hollywood’s most treasured performers.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso on this episode, “Ballad of a Small Player” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/awards/colin-farrell-batman-2-script-ballad-of-a-small-player-1236541408/\">star Colin Farrell discusses working with director Edward Berger</a> and what we can expect from “The Batman 2.” Listen below!</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Read excerpts from the edited and condensed version below.</em></p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Life-of-Chuck.jpg 1181w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Life-of-Chuck.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Life-of-Chuck.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Life-of-Chuck.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Life-of-Chuck.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Life-of-Chuck.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Life-of-Chuck.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Life-of-Chuck.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Life-of-Chuck.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeon\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>You’re here for Mike Flanagan’s “The Life of Chuck.” What surprised you about the film and working with him on Stephen King’s material? And did you enjoy Tom Hiddleston’s dance as much as we did?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s one of the greatest dance sequences of all time, because it’s unexpected and grows organically in a believable way. If you go to an MGM musical, you’re expecting a dance number. This one grows out of nowhere, and like everything else about the movie, it’s so unexpected.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the challenges for me was how to promote this — how do you describe the indescribable? When Mike emailed me that he had a part he thought I’d be right for, I immediately ordered “If It Bleeds,” the collection it’s in. I’d worked for Mike in “The Fall of the House of Usher,” and I’d seen his work — “The Haunting of Hill House,” “The Haunting of Bly Manor,” “Midnight Mass.” With his reputation and Stephen King’s, I was expecting the epic supernatural horror script of all time. I was set up the wrong way, but it really worked because it was so unexpected.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tStephen King doesn’t get the credit for his versatility as a writer. He wrote “The Green Mile,” “The Shawshank Redemption” and “The Body,” which became “Stand by Me.” He’s capable of much more than “The Shining” or “Carrie.” Even then, I wondered how he came up with this. And then I thought, how will they adapt it? Mike did an incredible job. I’ve seen it three times, and each time I’ve picked up something different. My wife says it’s her favorite thing I’ve ever done. She’s seen it six or seven times.</p>\n<p>\n\tBeing isolated the way I am in Act One — which comes at the end — spoiler alert — I read what happened on the page, but seeing the performances by Karen Gillan and Chiwetel Ejiofor, I mean, come on. Carl Lumbly, whom I worked with in “Usher,” is always great. Tom Hiddleston — who knew he was such a nice person and enormously talented?</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>You’ve worked with Flanagan on “Usher.” What made that collaboration click for you?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tI wouldn’t be sitting here talking about it if it weren’t for Mike Flanagan. He came over with Trevor Macy to my house to talk about “The Fall of the House of Usher.” I’d seen three or four things of his, so I was already a fan. When I signed on, I went back to his IMDb and watched everything he had done.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I found remarkable was that the part would have been routine in voice-over. I’ve played sociopaths — but never on camera. That’s what I found so interesting. It’s a small but distinctive character part, and it was scary because usually when you read something, you say, “Oh, I know who this guy is.” I flew to Vancouver with no clue, which was really scary.</p>\n<p>\n\tRemarkably, Mike thought of me at all. Should I be insulted that he wants me to play an evil, sociopathic enabler? One thing I love about Mike is that he makes it relatable. The Usher family sells Ligodone — billions of dollars — but it’s highly addictive and kills hundreds of thousands of people. Oh, you mean like the Sackler family with OxyContin. With that relatable baseline, you can accept the bizarre happenings. As the family lawyer, I’m investigating. Call me Mr. Exposition, because I’m providing the information the audience needs. It was hard to memorize.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I’m grateful that Mike thought of me and thought outside the box. I’d never been offered something like that. And he’s one of the most even-tempered people. I’ve never heard him raise his voice, lose his temper or throw things. It’s like being in a big family.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>You’ve said animation lets you disappear. What does animation mean to you, and how did playing the Joker in “Batman: The Animated Series” change things?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tI can see why people distinguish the mediums. In one, you cannot be seen — and that’s liberating. You’ll make choices you might not make on camera, where subtlety and nuance count for a lot.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I love about animation is that the definition of a character actor — an actor who disappears and you see only the character — applies to everyone. You’re immediately a character actor, and you get parts you would never get on camera because you’re not physically right for them. If you can sound like a 6-foot-2, muscle-bound bodyguard, you’ll get the part.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was a revelation to me. I spent 10 years on Broadway, but when I really got deeply into animation, I built a reputation with directors and writers for being on time and professional. I’m sure people thought, “Oh, he’s going to show up with an entourage.” But once you establish that you’re there for the work, I thought, where has this been all my life? I’d be happy never to be on camera again. That’s how much I loved it. The voice-over community is welcoming, and they’re all so gifted. It doesn’t seem as cutthroat as competing for on-camera parts.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Joker was a turning point because it had such a profound impact. The series was well written and beautifully cast. There were episodes that could have been live action. There’s an integrity and seriousness of intent. It wasn’t the Saturday morning “Super Friends” version. It was written to attract children, as well as their parents and older audiences.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Would you ever go back to Broadway? What did theater teach you?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMy wife says that since I played Mozart in “Amadeus,” now I’m old enough to play Salieri. I say no. The older you get, the less you care, in a way. But if something came along, you’d have to say yes. I love people who sign on for a 16-week run, not an open-ended year or year-and-a-half commitment — you start getting a bit batty.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne alarming moment came after a performance of “Amadeus,” when a teenage girl at the stage door was in tears. She was so moved — effusive with praise. In the cab home, I thought I should remember what I did to move her like that — and I couldn’t remember anything. I thought, “Wow, am I turning into Mr. Machine?”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPeople say, “How can you do the same thing every night eight times a week?” The audience is different every night, and they are a major part of a theatrical experience — unlike anything on television or in movies. It’s a singular experience every actor should try.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Let’s rewind back to “Star Wars” and your time in the franchise. Are there any good stories you’d like to tell us?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tLet me tell you a little story about that reveal in the script. The line was, “You don’t know the truth. Obi-Wan killed your father,” and it was played exactly as you see it in the film: “No, that’s not true. That’s impossible. Search your feelings. You know it’s true.” This is how we filmed it.</p>\n<p>\n\tIronically, within two days, one of the stormtroopers would go down to the pub during lunchtime, and there’d be tabloid people offering five or 10 pounds for any news. Irvin Kershner came to my dressing room and said, “I’m going to tell you something. I know it. George Lucas knows it, and when I tell you, you’ll know it. So if it leaks, we’ll know it’s you.” And I said, “What is it?” He said, “We’re going to take out the line ‘Obi-Wan killed your father’ and put in ‘I am your father.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Guinness thing was a pretty good twist. Unfortunately, it’s impossible to control leaks, but it was still stunning. The hardest part was keeping that secret for over a year and a half. At the first screening, Harrison was sitting in front of me. He turned around and said, “You didn’t even tell me.” I was too afraid. I didn’t leak it to anybody, and I didn’t tell my wife. I thought, “Well, I talk in my sleep.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Would you return for future “Star Wars” projects?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe way I feel is I had my time, and I love what they’re doing with “The Mandalorian” and “The Book of Boba Fett.” They asked me to do brief cameos when Luke was at the height of his powers. I told George it’s almost like if you did this for James Bond — Episode One, he’s a kid dreaming about the future and hearing about secret agents. In Episode Two, he trains to be a secret agent. In Episode Three, he earns his license to kill — and then you stop. No “Dr. No,” no “From Russia With Love,” no “Goldfinger.” Luke has a beginning and an end, but no middle. That’s just how it played out.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tI had my time. They’re doing great, and I wish them all the best.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>There’s a new AI “actor,” Tilly Norwood, who is reportedly going to be signed by a talent agency. What do you make of AI actors?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t[shows picture of Tilly Norwood] Oh my gosh, she looks like a real person. It’s terrifying. After I pass away, who knows — they could go to my family and say, “We’ll pay you all this money so we can do him at age 28,” or whatever. It’s unfathomable. That’s the problem — it’s beyond my comprehension in terms of the effects. I almost don’t know what to think, other than it’s terrible, ghastly, ghoulish, weird.</p>\n<p>\n\tRemember that ad where Gene Kelly was dancing with a vacuum cleaner? His estate got paid and all that. But would Gene have wanted to be a spokesman for a vacuum cleaner? I don’t know. Too many unanswered questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The film deals with legacy. Did making it spark reflections on your own?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIt made me aware of that aspect. It’s something you’d rather not think about.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

From monster openings for movies like “Sinners” and “Final Destination Bloodlines” to word-of-mouth streaming debuts like “Dead Mail” and “Best Wishes to All,” there are so many standouts that any horror fan has their work cut out for them to catch up. There’s still plenty on the way this year as well, including “Black Phone 2,” “Predator: Badlands” and many more. Below, take a look at <em>Variety</em>’s list of the Best Horror Movies of the Year So Far, a selection that hopefully invites spirited debate and encourages adding some new titles to your Letterboxd Watchlist.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, some honorable mentions, in alphabetical order:  </p>\n<div>\n\t<p><strong>“Bring Her Back” </strong>(A24) — Danny and Michael Philippou’s “Talk to Me” follow-up is handsomely shot and features a great Sally Hawkins performance, but is stuck in one wildly depressing gear.</p><p>  <strong>“Clown in a Cornfield” </strong>(RLJE Films and Shudder) — More clever than the name implies, a mid-film twist plays well at upending genre conventions.</p></div>\n<div>\n\t<p><strong>”Drop”</strong> (Universal Pictures) — In one of the year’s best popcorn movies, Meghann Fahy has to squeeze out of one sticky situation after another in this dynamically filmed low-budget thriller. </p><p>  <strong>“Predator: Killer of Killers” </strong>(Hulu) — This impressive triptych delivers some of the most epic Predator battles ever, with animation acting as a wonderful canvas for prohibitively expensive fight scenes.</p></div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>”Sweet Revenge”</strong> (Horror Inc. and Jason Universe) — It may be a short, but this brief Jason tale does a great job of delivering some bloody action with a retro feel, and gives the legendary killer a formidable foe. Here’s hoping it gets turned into a feature-length film, as it seems like writer and director Mike P. Nelson really understands what makes the “Friday the 13th” universe tick.<br /></p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>The Toxic Avenger</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/THE-TOXIC-AVENGER_2.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"The Toxic Avenger\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/THE-TOXIC-AVENGER_2.jpg 6048w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/THE-TOXIC-AVENGER_2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/THE-TOXIC-AVENGER_2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/THE-TOXIC-AVENGER_2.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/THE-TOXIC-AVENGER_2.jpg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/THE-TOXIC-AVENGER_2.jpg?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/THE-TOXIC-AVENGER_2.jpg?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/THE-TOXIC-AVENGER_2.jpg?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/THE-TOXIC-AVENGER_2.jpg?resize=250,140 250w\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Yana Blajeva\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Cineverse</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tWriter and Director Macon Blair amps up the heart — but keeps the splattery violence and satire — in this reimagining of the signature Troma movie.

The laughs ultimately outweigh the scares, but it’s a great genre twist for slasher fans, elevated by a supporting cast that includes memorable turns from Gigi Zumbado, Michaela Watkins, Devon Sawa and Jordana Brewster.</p>\n</div></article>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Best Wishes to All</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/best-wishes-to-all.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"best wishes to all\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/best-wishes-to-all.jpg 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/best-wishes-to-all.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/best-wishes-to-all.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/best-wishes-to-all.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/best-wishes-to-all.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/best-wishes-to-all.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/best-wishes-to-all.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/best-wishes-to-all.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Shudder / Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Shudder</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThis Japanese horror movie is filled with some of the most indelible imagery put on screen this year, nightmare fuel for those able to keep their eyes open.

But ultimately, what worked very well were the ooey gooey kills, which were a perfect blend of funny and cringey. Mix in a heartfelt goodbye from franchise fixture Tony Todd, and it’s no surprise why this was such a critical and commercial success.  </p>\n</div></article>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>The Shrouds</h2>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MCDSHRO_EC037.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"THE SHROUDS, (aka LES LINCEULS), Vincent Cassel, 2024. © Janus Films /Courtesy Everett Collection\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MCDSHRO_EC037.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MCDSHRO_EC037.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MCDSHRO_EC037.jpg?resize=300,155 300w\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Janus Films</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tDavid Cronenberg’s latest film is about the living who haunt graveyards, namely Karsh (Vincent Cassel), a man who builds in-tomb cameras so that mourners can watch their loved ones rot in real time.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-real-housewives-of-potomac/\">The Real Housewives of Potomac</a>” star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/wendy-osefo/\">Wendy Osefo</a> and her husband Eddie Osefo were indicted on Oct. 9 in Carroll County, Maryland on multiple charges of fraud. Following the news of their arrest, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bravo/\">Bravo</a> pushed the series premiere of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/wife-swap-the-real-housewives-edition/\">Wife Swap: The Real Housewives Edition</a>” to Oct. 21 (it was scheduled for Oct. 14). Each episode showcases a “swap” between a “Real Housewives” cast member and an ordinary civilian, and Osefo and Eddie Osefo were to be featured in the first episode. When it premieres on Oct. 21, “Wife Swap” will feature “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” star Angie Katsanevas instead of the Osefos, whose episode has been delayed.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tA spokesperson for Wendy Osefo emailed a statement to <em>Variety</em>: “Dr. Wendy Osefo and her husband, Edward Osefo, are back home safely with their family and in good spirits. They are grateful for the outpouring of concern and support from friends, fans, and colleagues. The Osefos, alongside their legal team, look forward to their day in court. At this time, they respectfully ask for privacy as they focus on their family and the legal process ahead.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTMZ was the <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2025/10/10/wendy-osefo-husband-eddie-arrested/?adid=social-tw\" target=\"_blank\">first to report</a> that the Osefos had been arrested on insurance fraud charges. According to court documents from Carroll County, Maryland obtained by <em>Variety</em>, the charges allege that the Osefos falsely claimed to have been burglarized in April 2024, and that items from their home were stolen (designer bags and jewelry). They then submitted three separate insurance claims estimating that $450,000 worth of goods had been stolen, according to the documents.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey were indicted on slightly different charges. Wendy Osefo was indicted on seven counts of insurance fraud, eight counts of conspiracy insurance fraud, and one count of false statement to a police officer, totally 16 charges. Eddie Osefo was indicted on 18 total counts, with one extra count each on the insurance fraud and the conspiracy insurance fraud charges.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tInvestigators appear to have been suspicious from the start of the burglary that the Osefos reported on April 7, 2024. The Osefos had been in Jamaica, and claimed to have returned home to find their “bedroom and both closets to be ransacked.” Their ADT alarm hadn’t gone off, and their Ring camera hadn’t detected anything. Later, investigators “determined that numerous items that the Osefos claimed were stolen had been purchased then returned to the store where a full refund was provided prior to the alleged burglary,” and saw that Wendy Osefo posted a photo on April 27, 2024 wearing a ring she’d claimed had been stolen in the robbery.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a press conference called by the Carroll County sheriff’s office on Friday afternoon, Sheriff James T. DeWees detailed the charges, and then took questions. DeWees was asked whether Osefo’s status as a reality star affected the investigation, and he said: “I don’t care if she’s real housewife, fake housewife, or whatever she is — we would handle it the same way, regardless of who she was.” DeWees said he does not watch the show, and asked a reporter who was there whether he watches it, and when the reporter mumbled something, DeWees said, “You don’t want to admit it? OK.” </p>\n<p>\n\tState’s Attorney Haven N. Shoemaker Jr. also appeared at the press conference, and said the Osefos are tentatively scheduled to appear in court on the charges on Nov. 7. Most of the felony charges carry a maximum penalty of 15 years.</p>\n<p>\n\tWendy Osefo — known as “Dr. Wendy” in the Bravosphere — joined the cast of “The Real Housewives of Potomac” in its fifth season, which premiered in August 2020. At the time, she was an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins and a regular pundit on CNN. Over her years on the show, she has been known to announce a time or two that she has “four degrees.” Bravo even put together a tribute to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DO3KJDYFFuQ/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Wendy on its Instagram account</a> in anticipation of the show’s 10th season, which began airing on Oct. 5.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Osefos married in 2011, and have three children: Eddie Osefo, who is an attorney, has been nicknamed “Happy Eddie” by fans. Osefo is scheduled to appear at BravoCon in Las Vegas in mid-November — a spokesperson for the network did not respond to an inquiry about Osefo’s attendance at the fan convention.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOsefo isn’t the first member of the “Potomac” cast to be faced with legal problems. Original cast member Karen Huger was arrested in March 2024 for driving under the influence, which she denied all throughout Season 9 of the show. She was then convicted in December 2024, and sentenced to up to two years in prison — she was released on Sept. 2 after serving a six-month sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Gene Maddaus contributed to this report.</em></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/cynthia-erivo/\">Cynthia Erivo</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ariana-grande/\">Ariana Grande</a> are heading back to Oz — and potentially back to the Oscars.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety</em> has confirmed that Erivo and Grande will once again campaign in the lead and supporting actress categories, respectively, for the sequel “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/wicked-for-good/\">Wicked: For Good</a>.”</p>\n<p>\n\tUniversal Pictures’ musical fantasy, directed by Jon M. Chu and written by Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox, continues the story begun in 2024’s “Wicked,” which adapted the first act of the hit 2003 Broadway musical by Stephen Schwartz and Holzman. The follow-up adapts the second act, exploring the aftermath of Elphaba and Glinda’s diverging paths — one as the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, the other as the beloved Glinda the Good.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIf both Erivo and Grande are nominated again for playing Elphaba and Glinda, they would join a very short list, becoming the seventh and eighth performers in Oscars history to be recognized twice for the same role.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBing Crosby was the first ever, after winning best actor for “Going My Way” (1944) before earning another nom the following year for its sequel, “The Bells of St. Mary’s.” Peter O’Toole received two nominations for portraying King Henry II in “Becket” (1964) and “The Lion in Winter” (1968), while Al Pacino was nominated for both “The Godfather” (1972) in supporting actor before landing a lead nod for “The Godfather Part II” (1974).</p>\n<p>\n\tOn his eighth career nomination, one year after receiving an Honorary Oscar, Paul Newman finally won a competitive statue for reprising Fast Eddie Felson in “The Color of Money” (1986), 25 years after “The Hustler.” Cate Blanchett earned dual nods for playing Queen Elizabeth I in “Elizabeth” (1998) and “Elizabeth: The Golden Age” (2007), while Sylvester Stallone did the same as Rocky Balboa in “Rocky” (1976) and “Creed” (2015). \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tErivo and Grande lead an ensemble that includes Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Bowen Yang, Marissa Bode, Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum, all reprising their roles from the first installment. Other than Erivo, each member of the ensemble will be submitted in supporting categories.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film will feature a mix of beloved songs from the stage musical and new original numbers, including “No Place Like Home” sung by Erivo’s Elphaba and “The Girl in the Bubble” performed by Grande’s Glinda. Both tracks are penned by Stephen Schwartz, who also composes alongside John Powell.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first “Wicked” was a major awards force last season. At the Oscars, the film tied with “The Brutalist” for the second-most nominations with 10 apiece, including best picture, best actress for Erivo and best supporting actress for Grande. It ultimately won best costume design for Paul Tazewell, who became the first African American man to win the category, and production design for Nathan Crowley and Lee Sandales.</p>\n<p>\n\tProduced by Marc Platt and David Stone, “Wicked: For Good” will open in theaters on Nov. 21.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/channing-tatum/\">Channing Tatum</a> knows a thing or two about patience, especially when it comes to construction. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Renovations, man,” he says, shaking his head. “I’ve been renovating my house for almost two and a half years now. It’s just been a nightmare.” </p>\n<p>\n\tThe actor hoots about lawsuits and lost money, but beneath the frustration, there’s a telling throughline — endurance. The same dogged persistence that got him through a grueling house remodel defines his work in “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/roofman/\">Roofman</a>,” a film inspired by the real-life story of Jeffrey Manchester, a man who robbed multiple McDonald’s restaurants, and when arrested, repeatedly escaped prison and found refuge in a Toys “R” Us.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tI share with Tatum that my first job was at McDonald’s when I was 16, making $5.15 an hour — minimum wage at the time. Almost a decade later, around the time the events of “Roofman” take place, I was working at a Toys “R” Us in New Jersey as a human resources supervisor (the film’s events take place in North Carolina). I was responsible for hiring during the holiday season when the company earned 80% to 90% of its annual revenue. In one scene, Tatum’s co-star Peter Dinklage, who plays the store manager, even mentions that same statistic. Part of my job back then was to let nearly all of those temporary hires go on New Year’s Eve, roughly 95% to 99% of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe irony isn’t lost on Tatum. The man who once sold cologne at Macy’s, worked fast food, and stripped in Florida nightclubs now plays a fugitive who turns a retail space into both his prison and his playground. “What a dark side of Toys “R” Us I didn’t know existed!” he laughs, before pausing with a grin. “It’s the kind of story that feels absurd and human at the same time. That’s what Derek [Cianfrance] does best. He finds the heart in the chaos.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe performance is among Tatum’s finest, the culmination of a career that has quietly built toward this moment. From his breakout in “A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints” to his raw work in “Foxcatcher,” Tatum has long balanced movie-star charisma with bruised, soulful intensity. In “Roofman,” he brings that duality to its most vulnerable point yet. It could get him a Golden Globe nom, and perhaps make him a dark horse for some Oscar attention if it strikes the right chords.</p>\n<p>\n\t“He did bad things,” Tatum acknowledges. “But he’s not evil. He’s funny, charming, delusional, and he survived solitary confinement for nearly a decade. That does something to a person.” </p>\n<p>\n\tTatum still hasn’t met the real Manchester, who remains incarcerated in North Carolina, but he plans to meet him. “He said something that stuck with me: ‘When I’m Happy Jeff, everything’s great. But when they break the deal, when they don’t give me what I’m supposed to have, Bad Jeff shows up.’ That’s a simple truth. We all have a Bad Jeff somewhere inside us.” </p>\n<p>\n\tWorking with Cianfrance, who co-wrote the script with Kirt Gunn, proved to be one of the most immersive experiences of his career. “Derek is probably the most performance-loving director I’ve ever worked with,” Tatum says. “He thinks of the character first, and then builds the world around them from the inside out.” </p>\n<p>\n\tCianfrance’s process was demanding, unorthodox, but always enjoyable. “He’d say, ‘Give me the Seinfeld one — talk with your hands the whole time.’ Or, ‘Give me the Buster Keaton take, give me the Jerry Lewis take,'” Tatum says with a laugh. “We’d do a silent take where we just think the words. I guarantee you there’s a silent version of this movie.” </p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P10253QC.jpg 2000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P10253QC.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P10253QC.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P10253QC.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P10253QC.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P10253QC.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P10253QC.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P10253QC.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P10253QC.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P10253QC.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P10253QC.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Derek Cianfrance and Channing Tatum at Variety’s Cover Party at TIFF.</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichelle Quance/Variety\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tOpposite Tatum is Oscar-nominee <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kirsten-dunst/\">Kirsten Dunst</a> (“The Power of the Dog”), playing Manchester’s love interest and emotional anchor. “I was terrified to work with her,” he admits. “She’s one of our greatest living actors, and people forget because she makes it look effortless.” </p>\n<p>\n\tDunst gives what Tatum calls a performance that’s “slow, precise and devastating.” Cianfrance intentionally kept the pair apart until filming their first scene together. “The second I looked into her eyes, every bit of nervousness was gone,” Tatum says. “I thought, ‘She’s going to make me better.'” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAs he did in Bennett Miller’s psychological drama “Foxcatcher,” Tatum poured every part of himself into “Roofman.” He recalls his experience with co-star Mark Ruffalo years earlier: “We held each other and cried for minutes. That movie was a meditation on suffering. I’ve never given that much of myself to a part — until this one.” </p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the conversation turns to AI-generated performers like Tilly Norwood, Tatum pauses. “I instinctually hate it,” he says before sharing an interesting metaphor. “But every innovation in art has caused panic. When acrylic paint came out, oil painters said it wasn’t real art. In the end, it’s just another tool. Still, I hope humans always want to see <em>real</em> humans; to feel what’s on screen that <em>actually </em>hurts and breathes.” </p>\n<p>\n\tTatum’s schedule remains busy. He lights up when the topic turns to Gambit — the long-delayed X-Men character he once tried to bring to life in a solo film before the Disney-Fox merger. His brief cameo in Shawn Levy’s “Deadpool and Wolverine” finally gave him a taste of what might have been. “It was the most high-stakes cosplay of all time,” he says, giddy and excited. “I looked around and saw Deadpool, Wolverine, Blade — and I’m standing there in full Gambit. I had this out-of-body kid moment.” As for what comes next, Tatum hints that Marvel “has ideas” for the character’s future. “If the fans really want it, I think there’s a world where Gambit could finally get his due.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen asked whether the long-lost “Gambit” movie could ever rise from the ashes, Tatum smirks. “Look…if we’d made our Fox version, that script would’ve never gotten made — <em>ever</em>. It was an R-rated romantic comedy. And when I say R-rated, I mean we <em>went </em>for it,” he says. “We made Gambit the kind of character who could only exist in a movie with Deadpool. We had mutants having sex! It was wild — full-on. That’s something Marvel and Disney would never do. You don’t always know what Disney will be, but you definitely know what it’s <em>not </em>going to be. It’s <em>not </em>gonna be horror. It’s not gonna be sex. But I think Marvel needs that kind of tonal diversity; something to balance the other side. Gambit’s a great opportunity for that. There’s so much you can do with him, and he’s slowly being built into the Marvel psyche. It’s fascinating, and I think one day they’ll figure it out.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe grins, imagining another version of the film. “If Derek Cianfrance had directed it? Man, it would’ve been ‘Henrich.’ He doesn’t think in terms of special effects. He’d be like, ‘Why does he have to throw cars? Why can’t we do it practical?’ That’s how his brain works.

Despite what Tatum calls “sincerely the best script I’ve ever read for me and Jonah [Hill],” the project has repeatedly stalled in development, weighed down by what he describes as outsized budgets and producer fees that keep sinking it.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I get asked more about ‘Jump Street 3’ than any other movie on the face of the planet that I’ve ever done,” Tatum says. “I don’t think it’ll ever happen. The problem is the overhead. It would cost as much as the actual budget of the film — if not more — because of all the producers involved. It’s just too top-heavy. It falls over every time.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Tatum, he, Hill and directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller have agreed to smaller producer fees. The sticking point, he says, remains producer Neal H. Moritz’s compensation, which has made the project financially unworkable. “Neal’s price for a producer fee is huge,” Tatum shares. “And to be honest, that’s what’s killing it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first film grossed $201 million worldwide in 2012, followed by $331 million for the 2014 sequel. Yet despite several attempts, including a scrapped crossover with “Men in Black,” Sony and the filmmakers have struggled to get a third installment off the ground.</p>\n<p>\n\tNext for the actor, he’s headed to Australia to star in “Cockroach,” directed by “Captain Fantastic” helmer Matt Ross, which he calls “the role of a lifetime. Three movies in one, and totally bonkers.” </p>\n<p>\n\tAs we wrap, Tatum makes his way out of the <em>Variety </em>offices and stops in the hallway, where a framed photo of Andrew Garfield and Ryan Reynolds from their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/video/ryan-reynolds-andrew-garfield-actors-on-actors-full-conversation/\">Variety Studio: Actors on Actors shoot</a> catches his eye. Pulling out his phone, he records a playful video addressed to Reynolds. “Why are you in this car? Where are you driving to?” he jokes, grinning as he walks toward the exit — a movie star still finding humor in the madness of Hollywood. “I’m sure he’ll love that,” as he sends the text.\n\t</p>\n</div>",

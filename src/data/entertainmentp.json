    "body": "\n\t“Predator: Badlands” is this weekend’s apex predator at the box office, collecting a better-than-expected $40 million in its domestic debut. \n\n\tThose ticket sales were enough to cement a franchise record, overtaking 2004’s “Alien vs. Predator” ($38 million, not adjusted for inflation) as the biggest opening weekend in the long-running property. The sci-fi series ignited with 1987’s “Predator,” starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and extended over the years with sequels, reboots and “Alien” crossover films.\n\t\n\n\t“Badlands” is reviving a moribund box office. With a pileup of flops in October, such as “Tron: Ares” and “The Smashing Machine,” revenues for the month had plunged to a 28-year low. November releases including “The Running Man,” “Now You See Me 3,” “Wicked: For Good” and “Zootopia 2” will aim to keep up the momentum. That’s as overall domestic box office returns are pacing roughly 3% ahead of 2024 — a gap that’s been rapidly shrinking since summer, when ticket sales were 25% ahead of last year. Ticket sales remain around 20% behind pre-pandemic times.\n\n\n\tHeading into the weekend, Disney and 20th Century’s “Predator: Badlands” was aiming for $25 million to $30 million to start. However, positive reviews and great word-of-mouth, including an “A-” grade on CinemaScore exit polls, helped the newest “Predator” crush initial expectations. “Badlands” also had a broader theatrical reach with its PG-13 rating. (Most of the “Predator” films have been rated R.)  Meanwhile premium large formats like Imax and Dolby, which cost more than the average ticket, contributed a substantial 59% of the overall domestic tally.\n\t\n\n\t“Predator: Badlands” earned another $40 million at the international box office, bringing its global total to $80 million. That’s a promising start for the $105 million-budgeted tentpole. It’s also a return to form for Disney, which has struggled with recent theatrical releases such as “Tron: Ares” and “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.” Now through the end of the year, Disney is poised to dominate at the box office with “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” both of which could earn $1 billion — and then some.\n\n\tDan Trachtenberg returned to direct “Predator: Badlands” after helming the two most recent franchise entries, 2022’s “Prey” and this June’s animated “Predator: Killer of Killers,” both of which skipped theaters and landed directly on streaming. This standalone story is about an outcast alien hunter (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) and his unlikely ally (Elle Fanning) who embark on a dangerous journey to defeat a menacing adversary. Variety’s chief film critic Peter Debruge praised “Badlands” as the “most interesting — and the strongest film with ‘Predator’ in the title since the 1987 original.”\n\n\t“Predator: Badlands” was easily No. 1 over several new releases — including Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson’s psychodrama “Die My Love,” Rami Malek-led historical drama “Nuremberg,” Sydney Sweeney’s boxing biopic “Christy” and Amazon MGM’s inspirational true story “Sarah’s Oil” — which were mostly catering to older audiences or arthouse crowds.\n\n\t“Sarah’s Oil” enjoyed the best start among newcomers with $4.5 million from 2,410 theaters, enough for fourth place on domestic charts. The feel-good film, about a young Black girl who finds oil on her land and becomes a millionaire at age 11, landed a rare “A+” grade on CinemaScore exit polls. \n\n\t“Nuremberg” wasn’t far behind on box office charts, debuting at No. 5 with $4.1 million from 1,802 venues. Sony Pictures Classics is releasing the film, which follows a psychiatrist (Malek) who has to determine whether the Nazi Hermann Goring (Russell Crowe) is fit to be prosecuted at the Nuremberg trials.\n\n\tIn eighth place, “Die My Love” collected $2.8 million from 1,983 theaters. That’s not a terrible opening except that Mubi reportedly paid $24 million for distribution rights. And “Die My Love,” directed by Lynn Ramsey, was saddled with a “D+” grade on CinemaScore exit polls — which isn’t great in terms of word-of-mouth but also isn’t entirely unexpected for a polarizing and deeply unsettling film. Lawrence has been praised for her performance as a new mother who begins to unravel while suffering from postpartum depression.\n\t\n\n\tMore to come…\n",

    "body": "\n\tSuzannah Mirghani’s Sudanese drama “Cotton Queen” won the top prize Sunday at the Thessaloniki Film Festival, taking home the Golden Alexander for best feature film.\n\n\tMirghani’s arresting debut — the first-ever feature film shot by a female Sudanese director — wowed the festival jury, which included Match Factory head of sales Τhania Dimitrakopoulou, U.S. cinematographer Frederick Elmes (“Blue Velvet,” “Wild at Heart”) and writer-director Elegance Bratton (“The Inspection”), who said “Cotton Queen” “blew us all away.”\n\t\n\n\t“This film sat with all of us judges from beginning to end,” said Bratton. “As we live in a world consumed by genocide and war, it’s important to remember what we’re all fighting for: our families, ourselves, our friends, our communities. This film…kept us focused on what matters most.”\n\n\n\t“Cotton Queen” follows a young Sudanese woman living in a village on the banks of the Nile River. The granddaughter of the so-called “Cotton Queen,” an elderly woman who’s taken on legendary dimensions due to her resistance against the British and her alleged ability to see the future, Nafisa works in her grandmother’s cotton fields and dreams about the young man she loves. \n\n\tBut the arrival of a wealthy entrepreneur from London upends everything, with her parents, her grandmother and her community planning Nafisa’s future without her knowledge. The film premiered in the Critics’ Week strand at this year’s Venice Film Festival.\n\n\tAccepting the Golden Alexander in Thessaloniki, Mirghani dedicated the award to Sudan, which is now in the grips of a devastating civil war, and to her Sudanese cast and crew, who are clinging to survival and “seeking a way out.”\n\t\n\n\t“In this time of war and of genocide, to make a film with actors who are now all displaced from their homes, all in Egypt where we shot the film, seeking refuge — to show that you can still work, you can still make a film, you can still make art in this time and be recognized for it, is really the most welcome news at this time,” she said.\n\n\tGreek filmmaker Aristotelis Maragkos won the Silver Alexander for best director for his sophomore feature “Beachcomber,” which tells the story of a young man chasing his sailor father’s legacy who is forced to confront the fragile truth of who he really is. The film also took home the Artistic Achievement Award for Best Cinematography for DoP Giorgos Karvelas.\n\n\tElsewhere in the international competition, the best actor award went to Harry Melling for his depiction of a mild-mannered traffic warden exploring his submissive side in Harry Lighton’s queer romance “Pillion,” while best actress honors went to Sabrina Amali, who plays an Egyptian archaeologist whose past catches up to her in Nancy Biniadaki’s “Maysoon.” A Special Award for Best Screenplay, meanwhile, went to writer Yvonne Görlach for Christina Tournatzès’ “Karla.”\n\n\tIn the festival’s Meet the Neighbors+ competition section, which includes debut or sophomore films from the 36 countries of Southeastern Europe, the Mediterranean and the Middle East, the Golden Alexander for best feature went to “The Last One for the Road,” Francesco Sossai’s boozy dramedy about a pair of aging drinking buddies that premiered in the Cannes Film Festival’s Un Certain Regard section. The film also scooped best actor honors for its two leading men, Pierpaolo Capovilla and Sergio Romano.\n\n\tThe section’s Silver Alexander for best director went to Yanis Koussim for the horror film “Roqia,” which follows a young Algerian man tormented by mysterious nighttime visitors after a car crash leaves him with amnesia. The award for best actress in the Meet the Neighbors+ section went to Manuela Martelli for her portrayal of a Chilean widow in Hana Jušić’s “God Will Not Help,” which also won the award for Best Artistic Achievement.\n\n\tIn the Film Forward competition section showcasing innovative filmmaking, the Golden Alexander went to Mehrnoush Alia’s “1,001 Frames,” while the Silver Alexander went to Manoël Dupont for “Before/After,” whose stars Jérémy Lamblot and Baptiste Leclere also earned a Special Mention from the jury. The award for Best Artistic Achievement went to Kristen Stewart’s “The Chronology of Water.”\n\t\n\n\tOther big winners at Sunday’s award ceremony included “Bearcave,” a queer romance by first-time directors Stergios Dinopoulos and Krysianna Papadakis, which premiered in the Venice Days sidebar of the Venice Film Festival and took home seven awards in Thessaloniki, and “Patty Is Such a Girly Name,” by Greek filmmaker Giorgos Georgopoulos, which won five awards following its world premiere this week.\n\n\tThe Thessaloniki Film Festival runs Oct. 30 – Nov. 9.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” made fun of the viral “spirit tunnel” videos from “The Jennifer Hudson Show” in a sketch during Nikki Glaser‘s episode.\n\n\tThe sketch was styled like an advertisement for antidepressants, beginning with shots of Glaser sadly staring through a window at the rain outside. In voiceover, a woman said, “Are you anxious? Overwhelmed? Have you stopped feeling like yourself? Are you overcome with an intense feeling of foreboding and dread? If so, you may be one of the many celebrities who are scheduled to dance through the Jennifer Hudson spirit tunnel.” \n\t\n\n\tOn her phone, Glaser watched TikTok videos of stars like Kathryn Hahn and Simon Cowell dancing down a hallway as the staff of “The Jennifer Hudson Show” cheers them on.\n\n\n\tThen Glaser addressed the camera directly. “I love Jennifer Hudson, but as an uncoordinated white woman, I felt trapped. I tried practicing, but everything I came up with looked career-ending,” she said. “I even tried to put my ass into it, but I don’t have one.”\n\n\t“I just kept imagining myself in that tunnel,” Glaser said, looking distressed as the “Jennifer Hudson Show” staff sang the song “Hey Mickey” — but with “Nikki” replacing “Mickey.” “It felt like there was no way out.”\n\n\tThen her tone brightened. “That’s when my doctor told me about Hudsacillin,” Glaser said as the sketch cut to the pink and purple packaging of a pill. “Hudsacillin is the only medication proven to kill spirit tunnel-related symptoms. Hudsacillin works. Not by taking your anxiety away, but by making you so violently ill you have no choice but to cancel. It works fast — maybe too fast. Thirty seconds after my first dose, I was shaking on the bathroom floor, not knowing which end of me to aim at the toilet.”\n\t\n\n\t“That’s because Hudsacillin is made from a gentle blend of E. Coli, influenza, C. Diff. and rancid buttermilk. I finally have my life back, and now my spot in the tunnel can go to someone who really wants it,” Glaser said as “SNL” cast member Marcello Hernandez was shown in the tunnel.\n\n\tAs the sketch ended, a man in voiceover said, “Hudsacillin. ‘Cause what’s the alternative? Lightening up and being fun? Good luck.”\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tPete Davidson made a surprise return to “Saturday Night Live” for a sprawling Weekend Update segment that tackled Zohran Mamdani’s election victory in New York, Davidson’s controversial decision to perform at the Riyadh Comedy Festival and a few jokes about his old boss, Lorne Michaels.\n\n\t“If Lorne Michaels has taught us anything, it’s that you never, ever give up. Even if everyone says the time has come and Tina Fey is ready to take over,” Davidson said, drawing some scattered but passionate applause from the crowd and a somewhat squirmy off-screen laugh from Weekend Update co-anchor Michael Che.\n\t\n\n\tDavidson brought up such perseverance because he was introduced by Colin Jost to discuss a ferry that the pair had purchased together with plans to transform it into an upscale entertainment venue — and a recent New York Times article about it that deemed the vessel a “money-losing fiasco.” \n\n\n\t“In case you’re wondering why I had to do a show in Saudi Arabia, we’re losing millions on this ferry. I assume that’s what the article says. I can’t spend $5 on a paywall when I got a kid on the way,” Davidson said. “I’m just excited to be a dad and to give it all the energy and enthusiasm I never had for this show.”\n\n\tSpeaking about New York City mayor-elect Mamdani, Davidson poked fun at Staten Island, the only of the five boroughs to turn in a majority vote for Mamdani’s main opponent, Andrew Cuomo.\n\n\t“I have a message for everyone who did not vote for our new mayor. Hey, Staten islanders! Did you promise to move out of New York if Mamdani won but have too many warrants in New Jersey and not enough guns for Florida?” Davidson exclaimed, introducing a new photoshopped image of his ferry. “Welcome to New Staten Island! … We can’t call it the Titanic anymore, since the people on this ship will actually love running into ICE.”\n\t\n\n\tDavidson was an “SNL” cast member for eight seasons, running from 2014 to 2022.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNikki Glaser opened her “SNL” monologue with an ode to the Big Apple: “Here I am in New York City, Epstein’s original island!”\n\n\tShe returned to the topic of the infamous sex offender — and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell later in her monologue while talking about her Gen Z friends who “have a really big fear of being trafficked.” \n\n\t“In my 20s, I just feared good old-fashioned rape. I didn’t think it would be a career. We didn’t think it was anything more than a temp job at a frat house futon,” said Glaser, who is 41. “They’re like, ‘We’re safer when you’re with us because they think you’re our madam. You have resting Ghislaine face, so keep that up.'”\n\t\n\n\tGlaser didn’t shy away from taboo topics in her monologue, and later jokingly worried that she might be a pedophile while telling a story about her four-year-old nephew asking to take a shower with her.\n\n\n\t“My sister’s like, ‘He can take a shower with you. It’s fine. He does it with us,'” she said. “‘OK, that’s fine for you guys, but are you okay with an adult showering with your child? … What if I molest him?’ She was like, ‘Would you?’ I was like, ‘No! I would never! That’s disgusting! But that’s what I’d say if I was gonna.'”\n\n\t“Don’t trust anyone. I don’t even trust myself,” Glaser continued. “I don’t want to go in there. How do you become a pedophile? You don’t get to choose what you’re into, dude. What if it’s one of those things you don’t know you until you get in there, and you’re like, ‘Well, this is my thing,’ and it opens up a part of my brain? I know that sounds crazy, but there have been so many things in my life that I’ve been like, ‘I would never do that.’ And now I’m like, ‘Looks kind of fun, actually.”\n\t\n\n\tGlaser also made jokes about Donald Trump’s “orange” tan.\n\n\t“He picked an insane shade. He went pretty dark,” she said. “He didn’t go Kamala, but he picked a shade that half of America was like, ‘Okay, we can still tell he’s white.'”\n\n\t“It is kind of insane that white people can just paint their skin,” Glaser continued, making fun of her own spray tan this time. “I feel like that’s cultural appropriation. I don’t know. I mean, it’s not blackface, but it is Guatemalan leg. This is not my leg. I’m like, ‘Oh my god, me llamo is Nikki!’ Am I saying that right?”\n\n\tGlaser is a first-time “SNL” host. Next year, she will host the Golden Globes for the second consecutive year. Hulu will also debut a comedy special from Glaser that was taped in October. \n\n\tSombr was the musical guest during Glaser’s episode, also making his debut on the show.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSlovenian filmmaker Kukla, whose debut feature “Fantasy” premiered at Locarno Film Festival and played this week at Thessaloniki Film Festival, is working on her sophomore feature. The project has been mentioned briefly previously, but Variety has exclusive additional details, including the working title, casting, and Kukla’s sources of inspiration.\n\n\tHer next project, which has the working title “Good Girl,” is a modern take on the Ancient Greek comedy “Lysistrata,” by Aristophanes, in which an Athenian woman advocates that women from warring city states should stop having sex with men until they stop fighting in the war between them, Kukla tells Variety in the Greek coastal city of Thessaloniki, with Mount Olympus visible across the sea.\n\t\n\n\tIn this updated version of “Lysistrata,” a third world war is threatened, and a TikToker “randomly speaks her thoughts out loud that we should stop having sex with men and stop giving birth to their kids if they want to kill them, and she starts a huge movement all over the world,” Kukla says.\n\n\n\tThe film is partly inspired by the Korean 4B Movement, a radical feminist movement that called for a rejection of sex, giving birth, dating and marriage. This started as a response to male violence against women, but broadened out to become a protest against male oppression. It spread to the U.S. following President Trump’s victory last year.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe new film will be set in different territories, including in the Balkans and France, “because I think that female solidarity will save the world, and I really want to show the strength of women everywhere,” Kukla says.\n\t\n\n\tThe lead actresses from “Fantasy,” Sarah Al Saleh, Mina Milovanović and Mia Skrbinac, will also appear in the second feature. Skrbinac is a professional actress but Al Saleh and Milovanović are non-professionals. All three also appeared in Kukla’s 2020 short “Sisters,” which featured the same characters and storyline as “Fantasy,” and won the Grand Prix at Clermont-Ferrand Intl. Short Film Festival.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMina Milovanovic, Sarah Al Saleh and Mia Skrbinac in “Fantasy”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Lazar Bogdanovic\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Good Girl” is “like an homage to them, because we have been on a long journey together, and we have grown up together as people and as filmmakers as well,” Kukla says.\n\n\tLike “Good Girl,” “Fantasy” also has its roots in Kukla’s interest in patriarchy, gender roles and identity.\n\n\tThe film centers on three tomboys, Mihrije, Sina and Jasna, best friends in Slovenia, who refuse to conform to the conservative norms of their communities, and traditions such as arranged marriages.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAlina Juhart and Sarah Al Saleh in “Fantasy”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Lazar Bogdanovic\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTheir world is turned upside down when they meet Fantasy, a transgender woman, which leads them on a journey of self-discovery in which they explore alternative approaches to gender roles and sexuality.\n\n\tAlina Juhart, who plays Fantasy, is well-known in the Balkans because she took part in a TV talent show. “It’s very interesting how, on the one hand, it’s such a conservative place, but on the other, they’re very welcoming, and that’s where I see the power of pop culture. That’s why the film has a lot of pop culture moments, because I think it’s good to make it approachable for the viewer.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Fantasy” stars Mina Milovanovic, Mia Skrbinac, Sarah Al Saleh and Alina Juhart\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Lazar Bogdanovic\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRegarding her three young lead actresses, she says: “I really wanted them to be co-creators of the film. In a sense they were co-editing the script with me,” so that it was seen through their eyes. “I really believe I found people who have the essence of the characters in themselves. So, it’s not that they were playing themselves, but some part of themselves. That’s why it was a very transformative process for all of us. They were speaking their words, from their perspective. It was really important to me that this film came from within, that we are represented equally.”\n\t\n\n\tThe idea for the film occurred to Kukla 10 years ago when she became interested in the phenomenon of “sworn virgins,” who were women in the Balkans in times past who took a vow of chastity, and lived and dressed as men, and were considered to belong to a third gender.\n\n\tShe had the idea to transfer this rejection of femininity and traditional gender roles to a contemporary environment, albeit one in which the patriarchy still holds sway. In this social setting, they would be called tomboys, who fight like boys and are fiercely independent.\n\n\t“Then there was a spark of an idea: What would happen if a sworn virgin met a transgender woman in the Balkans?,” she says. “That meeting was a spark that expanded the whole view on femininity in the Balkans. And through that, I came to the core questions like, ‘Am I able to see myself uncontaminated by the male gaze? Or, where is the female eye? Where’s the female voice? And, from there, it goes in so many directions.”\n\n\tKukla lives in Belgrade, Serbia, but grew up in Slovenia, and her parents came from North Macedonia. Her birth name is Katarina Bogdanovic, but Kukla, which means “doll” in Macedonian, was her nickname as a child and stuck.\n\n\t“In the late 90s and early 2000s [Slovenia] was a very xenophobic place,” Kukla says. “My national identity was drowned in shame. I speak perfect Slovenian, but when they heard my mother speaking, there was a lot of bullying. So, we just weren’t accepted as a community.”\n\n\tShe adds: “And then the integration process successfully, let’s say, manifested. And now it has become some sort of a subculture. So it’s a very interesting cultural phenomenon. I’m really interested in those fluidities of identity. So I’m reflecting also on that in the film, because every diaspora is always more conservative than the original country. And also, there’s a mix of a lot of different cultures.”\n\n\tFantasy acts as a catalyst in the film, leading to a questioning of views on identity, including queer identity in the Balkans.\n\n\t“Fantasy is not afraid of her vulnerability, but also not afraid of her power. I wanted to include this Balkan queerness in my film, which is not dependent on Western queerness. I think we have our own version of it,” Kukla says.\n\t\n\n\t“I don’t see her as a passive character at all. I think she’s very active, but she shows the other three girls that with her stance on her identity and with her honesty and courage that there are so many versions of femininity, and that you can live your own truth. And that is something that I was very eager to show in the film, because the Balkans is a very contradictory place. It’s very transphobic, homophobic and misogynistic place, yet her DMs are full of straight men with families. That was the contradiction that I was quite mad at, because there’s a lot of sexual interest in trans women, but no interest in them as normal humans, as equals in society.”\n\n\t“Fantasy” is produced by Lija Pogačnik, Barbara Daljavec and Vlado Bulajić for Slovenia’s December. The film, which also screened in competition at Sarajevo Film Festival, is being sold internationally by Totem Films.\n\n\tThe Hollywood Reporter first reported on Kukla’s second feature.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” got straight to President Trump in its cold open for this week’s episode, with James Austin Johnson’s commander-in-chief bragging from the Oval Office about the ongoing government shutdown, which has dragged on since Oct. 1. \n\n\t“The Supreme Court said we could stop feeding poor people. You can clap for that. SNAP!” Trump said. “For those of you who can afford food — no, you can’t. I promised grocery prices would plummet and they did. They plummeted straight up. People are saying, ‘But sir, how will I afford my Thanksgiving turkey for my family? Well, good news is your family’s not coming because all the planes are gone.'” \n\t\n\n\tThe cold open was referencing the Supreme Court’s ruling on Friday that allowed the Trump administration to continue paying reduced food stamp benefits.\n\n\n\t“Anyways, government is still shut down, all thanks to the Democrats and some Republicans and all Republicans and me,” Trump continued. “We’re going to keep the government shut down. We’re looking into perhaps stealing Christmas. We’ll be doing Grinch. I like the Grinch. He’s a great guy.”\n\n\tThe sketch also kicked off with a recreation of an incident from Thursday, in which an Oval Office guest collapsed during Trump’s announcement of a weight loss drug cost reduction program.\n\n\t“Didn’t see you there. Someone was dying in my office,” Trump began. “I think I’m playing this very normal. Just stand there and stare like a sociopath.”\n\n\tThe Nov. 8 episode of “Saturday Night Live” was hosted by Nikki Glaser, with musical guest Sombr. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inducting the White Stripes did not result in the reunion of the long-dissolved duo, as many had hoped, with Meg White remaining out of the spotlight, as she has been since they announced their split nearly 15 years ago. But if she was absent from the Hall of Fame proceedings at Los Angeles’ Peacock Theatre, her presence was very much felt in remarks from Iggy Pop, who formally inducted the pair, and especially from Jack White, who accepted on both their behalfs and even read a fable he wrote down this week about their origin story. \n\t\n\n\tFollowing the speeches, here were also salutes offered by two twosomes: Olivia Rodrigo and Feist, who sang “We Are Going to Be Friends” as a tender duet, and Twenty One Pilots, one of the few other true duo acts in the recent history of rock, recreating “Seven Nation Army” as a bass-and-drums-only rocker.\n\n\n\tSpeaking to his former drummer’s absence, White said: “I spoke with Meg White the other day, and she said that she’s very sorry she couldn’t make it here tonight, but she wanted me to tell you that she’s very grateful. And to all of the folks who supported her in all the years, it really means a lot to her. She also helped me write all this… I sent these things to her. She checked it for me for a lot of punctuation and corrections. She’s pretty good at that.”\n\n\tHe continued by sharing a random thought of Meg’s: “She said, ‘Do you remember, Jack? We used to walk around and animals, for some reason, would stare at us. They would stop and stare at us for some reason. Even at the Detroit Zoo, an elephant did the exact same thing one time.’ She just wanted me to tell you that,” he explained, to crowd laughter.\n\t\n\n\tWhite gave props to some other iconic duos — representing non-musical disciplines — that preceded the White Stripes onto the national artistic stage.\n\n\t“There was a duo of songwriters important around the time of the birth of rock ‘n’ roll called Leiber and Stoller, and they wrote a lot of songs that a lot of people probably never heard of, but they also wrote a couple that really connected with folks, like ‘Jailhouse Rock’ and ‘Stand By Me,’ and you for sure heard those songs,” White said. “There was once a duo called Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, and they were a comic-book-hero writing team who came up with all kinds of heroes you’d never heard of — Slam Bradley and Dr. Occult and so forth — but they also came up with this character that really connected with people: Superman, I’m sure you heard of. And there was once a comedy duo called Abbott and Costello that I remember hearing from my father as a child that had thousands of jokes kept on white cards in a file cabinet, jokes and routines that nobody had ever heard before and they never got to perform, but they also developed a joke that for some reason really connected with people, and the routine was called ‘Who’s On First?’ I know you’ve heard that one.”\n\n\tMaking the connection, White added: “I myself have been in a lot of bands that you probably never heard of, but for some reason people especially connected with this one two-piece duo project that I was in called the White Stripes. We don’t know why these things connect with people, but when they do, it’s the most beautiful thing you can have.”\n\n\tWhite read off a litany of musicians he wanted to thank as influences, including such varied names as Loretta Lynn, Fugazi, the Misfits, Jethro Tull, the Troggs, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Arthur Lee and Love, the Flat Duo Jets, Dick Dale, Ritchie Blackmore’s Rainbow, the Sonics, Pavement, Black Flag, Sleater-Kinney, the Breeders, the Cramps, Merle Haggard, the Hives, Them, the Damned, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Minor Threat and Captain Beefheart.\n\n\tThere were other thanks to give. “To the factories and tools and electricity and vacuum tubes, we say thank you. To the Coney Islands of Detroit and the honky-tonks of Nashville and the corner pubs of London, we say thank you. To the homeless and the powerless and the forgotten, we always say thank you.”\n\t\n\n\tAs advice, he offered, “To the young artists, I want to say: get your hands dirty and drop the screens and get out of your little room and get obsessed. Get obsessed with something… We all want to share in what you might create.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJack White at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnd then, a parable, which he said Meg White would be hearing for the first time along with the audience. \n\n\t“I was gonna send this to Meg, but I didn’t get around to it, so I thought I’d read it to you all tonight,” White began. “One time a girl climbed a tree and in that tree was a boy — her brother, she thought — and the tree looked so glorious and beautiful, but it was just an oak tree. And these two so loved the world that they brought forth a parade float, one they built in their garage behind the oak tree with their own bare hands. And the boy looked at this giant peppermint on the wheels and felt pride. Pride that it was produced in the Motor City, just like in the big factories, but it was just in their garage. He looked at the girl — his sister, he thought — and like the Little Rascals, they said, ‘Let’s put on a show.’ And they paraded this float through the Cass corridor, standing atop the peppermint pulled by white horses, or maybe it was an EconoLines van. And many of the blocks they traveled were empty, but some had people. And some of those people cheered, and some laughed, and some even threw stones.\n\n\t“And with their bare hands,” White continued, “the two started to clap and sing and make up songs. And some people kept watching and swaying and moving. And then one person even smiled. And the boy and the girl looked at each other and they also smiled and they both felt the sin of pride, but they kept on smiling. Smiling from a new freedom, knowing that they had shared and made another person feel something. And they felt the person smiling at them was a stranger. So they didn’t even know. But it wasn’t just a stranger, it was God.”\n\n\tKeeping up the sibling theme to the end, he concluded: “My sister thanks you and I thank you.”\n\n\"Get your hands dirty and drop the screens and get out of your garage.\" — Jack White, accepting The White Stripes’ Induction into the Rock & Roll of Fame.📺 Check out the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony NOW on @DisneyPlus.#RockHall2025 pic.twitter.com/nlSutGZLcR— Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (@rockhall) November 9, 2025\n\n\n\tIn his intro, fellow Detroit native Iggy Pop said, “The first time I saw them was in a photograph… grinning like they had some kind of fun secret, like they stole some cookies from a cookie jar. Basically I was looking at a 20th century Adam and Eve who had started a rock ‘n’ roll band… Cute ckids, they’ll probably go places,” he remembered thinking.\n\t\n\n\tPop saluted “Meg White, who is a timeless beauty. Meg White, who gave her name to the group, was a charismatic, naturally likable person. I met her once and she had the most genuine and charming smile. She  gave the drum kit a good whack like Fred Below did for Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry. I think it was Meg’s support that helped launch the rocket of racket that was Jack White.\n\n\t“Jack could screech like an owl. He could twang like a hillbilly… I hear echoes of the Who, the Small faces, the Beatles, art-rock and country-blues in his playing. He could do it all. And the writing he is capable of was something that was not typical of the great Detroit bands of the ‘60s and ‘70s —  this was more melodic, more hooky. After all, it was a new century, and the White Stripes’ music was coming from a foundation of love instead of revolution.”\n\n\tIn the video tribute that the Rock Hall put together for the duo, Rodrigo offered a younger generation’s appreciation of the pair — and the highest possible veneration for “Seven Nation Army” in particular: “Do you hear those seven notes? There’s no question what it is. ‘Seven Nation Army’ is the most iconic song of all time — it’s just so ingrained into who we are as humans.”\n\n\n",

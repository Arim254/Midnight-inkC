    "body": "\n\tNicholas Hoult, speaking at Red Sea Film Festival on Monday, touched on his upcoming Tom Ford movie, “Cry to Heaven,” the adaptation of Anne Rice’s 1982 novel.\n\n\tHoult stars alongside Adele, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ciarán Hinds, George MacKay, Mark Strong, Colin Firth, Paul Bettany, Hunter Schafer and Thandiwe Newton, among others.\n\n\tHoult, who previously appeared in Ford’s “A Single Man,” said: “Yeah, we start shooting next year for that. I’m really looking forward to being back on set with Tom. He’s a wonderful director to work with. Just his attention to detail. His understanding of the emotions of the characters. He’s written a really beautiful script, and it’s a wonderful cast. So I’m really looking forward to working with everyone.”\n\t\n\n\tHoult, who recently appeared in Clint Eastwood’s “Juror #2,” said that he’d like to do a Western. “Working with Clint, I went back and watched all of his classic movies. One of my all time favorite movies is ‘Unforgiven.’ I think it’s a masterpiece. So I really at some point want to do a Western.”\n\n\n\tHoult has been taking part in the Ferrari Challenge Series and had a crash racing this year at Daytona. He is likely to have his first proper race in March, he said, and added that he’d love to be in a racing movie. \n\n\tHe said: “I find [racing] very similar to acting, in some ways. It’s like an intense focus, but also this kind of flow state where it’s input, output. You’re just focusing on, like, what you need to look at, what’s happening, and then what you need to do too, and so they’re very similar in many ways. Like acting, you’re looking at the other person, seeing whatever it is, observing, and then hopefully the output comes naturally. \n\t\n\n\t“So there’s a lot of similarities, but it’s also terrifying. I had my first crash at Daytona this year. That was a weird thing, because as I was spinning across the track, all I can remember thinking was, ‘Oh, this is what it feels like.’ You know, when you haven’t experienced something before and it’s happening, and it’s quick, but it’s happening, and you’re like, ‘Oh, this is it.’ And it’s not necessarily like a total fear, but it’s like, ‘Huh,’ because you can’t imagine what that feels like. So then when it happens, you go, ‘Oh, that’s the feeling … interesting.'”\n\n\tHoult said that after he and his son watched “F1: The Movie,” one of the first movies they’ve gone to see as father and son, they then went go-karting. “I took him go-karting a few weeks after that, and just as we were about to walk out the door, he goes, ‘Wait, wait, wait,’ and he goes running off, and he comes back. ‘Where’d you go? What happened? What is it?’ And he showed me he had two playing cards. I don’t know if you remember Brad Pitt’s character has his two playing cards, his lucky playing cards for whenever he drives. So my son was like, ‘Oh, I need my playing cards to be like Brad.'”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix’s teen drama “My Life With the Walter Boys” has added three more recurring cast members for Season 3.\n\n\tChad Rook (“It: Welcome to Derry,” “Joe Pickett”) has joined as Mac, described as “a cool drag racer who hires Cole to revamp the engine of one of his racing cars. After seeing Cole take the car for a spin on the track, Mac is impressed by Cole’s natural skills behind the wheel.”\n\n\n\tNaveen Paddock (“Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,” “Anything’s Possible”) is Eliot, Uncle Richard’s new intern who is handsome and charming, with an air of New York sophistication. Eliot’s arrival in Silver Falls leaves Jackie caught between her old life in Manhattan and her new one in rural Colorado.\n\t\n\n\tErin Karpluk (“Being Erica,” “Smoke”) will play Hannah, the nomadic sister of George and mother to Isaac and Lee. Per Netflix, “Hannah is a free spirit or irresponsible as hell (take your pick). She previously left her sons to live with the Walters and then split for reasons unknown, but when she suddenly shows up at the front door a thousand days later, she has a lot of bridges to rebuild.”\n\n\n\tBased on the coming-of-age novel by Ali Novak, “My Life With the Walter Boys” follows Jackie Howard, an orphaned teenager who relocates from New York City to rural Colorado after the Walter family takes her in. She soon finds herself caught in a love triangle between two of the brothers.\n\n\tSeason 3 of the series has wrapped production in Canada and will premiere on Netflix sometime in 2026. Rook, Paddock and Karpluk join series regulars Nikki Rodriguez, Sarah Rafferty, Marc Blucas, Noah LaLonde, Ashby Gentry, Connor Stanhope and Jaylan Evans, as well as a recurring cast that includes Corey Fogelmanis, Johnny Link, Isaac Arellanes, Myles Perez, Alisha Newton, Mya Lowe, Ellie O’Brien, Kolton Stewart, Natalie Sharp, Alex Quijano, Ashley Tavares, Dean Petriw, Alix West Lefler, Lennix James and Gabrielle Jacinto.\n",

In that same timeframe, Wrapped shares grew to 575 million, while shares on Instagram nearly doubled year over year.\n\n\tOn a more granular level, there were over 65 million shares from the Listening Age story, a newly added feature that calculated how old a given user is based on annual listening habits. Elsewhere, in-app messaging on Spotify grew 100 percent, the biggest jump since the feature’s announcement earlier this year.\n\t\n\n\tWrapped launched as a revamped experience for 2025, refreshing previous inclusions like top genres and top songs. Spotify also rolled out new features like Listening Archive, which breaks down your most memorable streaming days, and Wrapped Party, an interactive feature that allows you to compare listening habits and compete with friends in bespoke breakout rooms.\n\n\tIn tandem with the launch of Wrapped 2025, Spotify announced its year-end charts, with Bad Bunny becoming the top global artist of 2025. He ranked ahead of Taylor Swift, the Weeknd, Drake, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar, Bruno Mars, Ariana Grande, Arijit Singh and Fuerza Regida.\n\n\tThe Puerto Rican rapper also had the most-streamed global album of the year with “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS,” while Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’ “Die With a Smile” topped the global songs of 2025 list. Taylor Swift was the top artist in the United States, and Lamar’s “Luther” featuring SZA was the top U.S. song of the year.\n",

It also marks the seventh consecutive year that “All I Want for Christmas Is You” has hit No. 1.

The pair also asserted that they are committed to Warner Bros. theatrical films in the same way that the studio operates now — addressing the immediate backlash from the film community out of concern that Netflix will dramatically shrink the theatrical exhibition window at a cornerstone film studio.\n\t\n\n\t“Today’s move was entirely expected,” Sarandos said. “We have a deal done, and we are incredibly happy with the deal. We think it’s great for our shareholders. It’s great for consumers. We think it’s a great way to create and protect jobs in the entertainment industry. We’re super confident we’re going to get it across the line and finish.”\n\n\n\tMore to come\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tWhat happens when someone hacks your brain? That’s exactly the challenge Simu Liu‘s Alexander Hale is facing in Peacock’s new espionage thriller, “The Copenhagen Test.” The trailer for the series, produced by UCP, dropped on Monday, with all episodes debuting on December 27.\n\n\tPer the official logline, the “series follows first-generation Chinese-American intelligence analyst Alexander Hale, who realizes his brain has been hacked, giving the perpetrators access to everything he sees and hears. Caught between his shadowy agency and the unknown hackers, he must maintain a performance 24/7 to flush out who’s responsible and prove where his allegiance lies.”\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to Liu, series regulars include Melissa Barrera, Sinclair Daniel, Brian d’Arcy James), Mark O’Brien and Kathleen Chalfant. Barrera plays the agent assigned to watch Alexander — but could be more, as hinted at in the trailer.\n\n\n\t“They want me to play the girlfriend,” she tells him. He responds, “Or you’re just keeping an eye on me.”\n\n\tThomas Brandon is the creator and serves as executive producer, writer and co-showrunner. Jennifer Yale is co-showrunner, writer and executive producer. Executive producers include Liu, James Wan, Michael Clear, Rob Hackett, Mark Winemaker. Jet Wilkinson executive produces and directs the first two episodes. UCP is the studio.\n\n\tWatch the full trailer below: \n\n\n\n",

The limited-time promotion is being billed as the company’s “best iPhone offer ever.”\n\n\n\tApple fans have several additional ways to score new hardware this season. T-Mobile is offering the iPhone 17 Pro “on us” — no trade-in required — when you bring your number over and add a new line on an Experience Beyond plan, also running for a limited time. You can also scoop up the new Apple Watch SE 3 for just $99 when you add an eligible watch plan, making it an easy upgrade for your wrist, too.\n\n\tSamsung’s lineup gets a similar spotlight in T-Mobile’s holiday playbook. The carrier is touting its “best Galaxy offer ever,” headlined by four Samsung Galaxy S25 devices “on us” when customers switch four lines for $25 per line, again with no trade-in needed.\n\n\tA separate holiday offer for Samsung enthusiasts includes the Flip7 “on us” — a value of $1.1k — with no trade-in required on T-Mobile’s Experience Beyond or Next plans. That promotion runs for a limited time, giving holiday — and even early-January — shoppers a longer window.\n\n\tAcross both device families, T-Mobile is doubling down on effortless upgrades: customers can hang onto their current phone and score a brand-new one for no extra cost — freeing them to gift, resell, or repurpose last year’s device while stepping into the latest flagship. With smartphone upgrades consistently peaking during the holidays — and both Apple and Samsung anchoring the premium device market — T-Mobile is positioning its lineup as a turnkey gifting solution for families looking to upgrade together.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery, responding to Paramount Skydance‘s unsolicited takeover offer to acquire all of WBD’s outstanding stock for $30/share, said it will review the proposal and issue its decision within 10 business days.\n\n\tFor now, the WBD board “is not modifying its recommendation with respect to the agreement with Netflix,” the company said in a statement Monday. On Friday, WBD and Netflix announced a deal under which Netflix would buy Warner Bros.’s studio operations, HBO and HBO Max for $72 billion (with an enterprise value of $82.7 billion). Paramount’s hostile takeover bid, backed in part of three Arab sovereign wealth funds and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners, has an enterprise value at $108.4 billion.\n\t\n\n\t“The Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors (the ‘Board’), consistent with its fiduciary duties and in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, will carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance’s offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s agreement with Netflix, Inc.,” the company said. “Warner Bros. Discovery intends to advise its stockholders of the Board’s recommendation regarding Paramount Skydance’s tender offer within 10 business days.”\n\n\n\tTen business days from Monday would be Friday, Dec. 19. Warner Bros. Discovery stockholders are advised “not to take any action at this time with respect to Paramount Skydance’s proposal,” WBD said. \n\n\tAllen & Co., J.P. Morgan and Evercore are serving as financial advisers to Warner Bros. Discovery and Wachtell Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Debevoise & Plimpton are serving as legal counsel.\n\t\n\n\tSEE ALSO: Paramount Launches Hostile Takeover Bid for Warner Bros.

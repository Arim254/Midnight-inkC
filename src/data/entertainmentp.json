    "description": "\n\tTurkish writer/director Emin Alper – who was at the Berlinale in 2019 with “A Tale of Three Sisters,” followed by his incendiary 2022 Cannes entry “",
    "body": "\n\tTurkish writer/director Emin Alper – who was at the Berlinale in 2019 with “A Tale of Three Sisters,” followed by his incendiary 2022 Cannes entry “Burning Days” – is back in Berlin with timely drama “Salvation” that delves, he says, into the dynamics of contemporary “mass murders, massacres, genocides, and wars.” \n\n\tSet in a remote Turkish mountain village, “Salvation” revolves on a conflict sparked by land dispute. It is inspired by a true 2009 event in which 12 members of a family in a village in the Kurdish region of Türkiye raided a wedding and killed 44 people, including women and children.\n\t\n\n\tAlper speaks to Variety about the film’s broader significance in today’s war-torn world.\n\n\n\tAs I understand it, “Salvation” stems from a true story involving a land dispute between different families that led to a massacre. Is that right?\n\n\tYes. It it took place almost 15 years ago in the Kurdish region of Türkiye. It was a shocking event for me, just like for many other people, of course. From that event onwards, I started asking myself: “How can a group of people collectively act in such a way? How can they commit such a heinous crime?” I understood that there was a leader prompting the perpetrators. So I wondered: “How can a leader convince the others?” There were 12 murders. “How did he convince the others to kill all those people?” I read the actual news, interviews, etc. But could not get a satisfactory picture from all this information. So I found myself writing a story that has references to the modern history of humanity which involves these kinds of mass murders, massacres, genocides, and wars. I have a PhD in history, so it was easy for me to find a connection between this story and the broader picture.\n\t\n\n\tUnfortunately massacres seems to have become quite timely. Are there any specific current references that come to mind?\n\n\tWell, on the one hand there is the Palestinian issue and the accusation – which I believe to be correct – that Israel has committed genocide. On the other hand, there is the new Trump era. So everyone is asking this question. “These types of leaders [Netanyahu, Trump, Putin] towards where are they dragging the world? This issue suddenly became more timely than when I was writing the screenplay four years ago.\n\n\tMore specifically, there is a feud between two brothers and a specific religious context. Talk to me about those dynamics\n\n\tIt comes from the real story. I mean, in the real story there’s a kind of religious context. But more importantly, I believe that these kind of people, these kind of leaders, who direct their people towards those kinds of crimes, they generally believe they have a mission. It can be religious or secular. But they have a mission; they have a target. And these targets are always sacred targets. It can be the religious salvation of a people. It can be the salvation of a nation, and the nation state. Or it can even be the salvation of people in socialist terms. You know, socialist leaders committed these types of crimes and legitimized them as being [for] the salvation of the people, for the equality of the people. So this sacredness is very important for me. The leader and the collectivity believe they have a kind of mission, a sacred mission. I used the religious element specifically to underline this reality.\n\n\tAesthetically, this film seems a departure for you. There are shades of horror genre. Do you agree that you’ve made a tonal shift towards the supernatural?\n\n\tYes, the dreams and the supernatural elements for me function on both the aesthetic level and the storytelling level. All the mystical religious experiences refer to dreams, especially in Turkey where there is this Sufi tradition. They got religious messages, through their dreams. They see the futureand prove their mystical powers in their dreams. But of course, it has a kind of collective aspect. Because not only does the leader claim leadership through dreams. It spreads to the whole collectivity that experiences fears and paranoias so it’s quite important to understand how dreams shape their worldview.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Doha Film Institute has recruited Mexican multi-hyphenates Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna, Venice prizewinner Alice Diop, Moroccan auteur Faouzi Bensaïdi, and Oscar-winning composer and producer Gustavo Santaolalla to hold onstage conversations and act as mentors during its upcoming Qumra Arab industry incubator.\n\n\tQumra, which means “camera” in Arabic, blends together a creative workshop, co-production market and festival elements. It was established by the Doha Film Institute (DFI) to help foster first and second works, mostly by Arab directors, and to create curated networking opportunities between the Arab and international film communities.\n\t\n\n\tThe DFI is a major indie Arab film industry driver and has also been providing funding for Arab TV series for the past few years. Qumra 2026 will feature a selection of top notch Arab films in various stages, as well as some TV projects.\n\n\n\tDFI-supported films screening at the Berlinale this year include Franco-Lebanese director Danielle Arbid’s Panorama section opener “Only Rebels Win,” starring Hiam Abbas (“Succession”); Palestinian Syrian filmmaker Abdallah Alkhatib’s “Chronicles from the Siege, in Perspectives; and Egyptian psychological thriller “Safe Exit” by Mohammed Hammad. \n\n\t“Qumra was created to ensure that emerging filmmakers are not only supported, but truly seen —artistically, professionally and globally,” said DFI Ceo Fatma Hassan Alremaihi in a statement. “Welcoming these luminaries as our 2026 Qumra Masters reflects our belief that generous mentorship can change creative trajectories,” she added. \n\t\n\n\tDFI artistic advisor Elia Suleiman – the Palestinian auteur known for movies such as “Divine Intervention,” “The Time That Remains” and, most recently, “It Must Be Heaven” that premiered at Cannes in 2019 –  pointed out in an interview with Variety that Gael García Bernal is returning to Qumra having been a master during the event’s very first edition. He also noted that both García Bernal and Luna wear different hats, since they are actors, directors and also producers. “It’s quite interesting to have people who know more than one  [industry] role,” Suleiman said. \n\n\tThe unique event, now celebrating its 12th edition, will run March 27-April 1 in the Qatari capital of Doha.\n",

    "body": "\n\tProjeto Paradiso, a philanthropic initiative supporting the Brazilian film sector from the Olga Rabinovich Institute, has selected the buzzy Brazilian film capital of Recife as the location for its third Paradiso Talent Network national meeting in April. Recife has skyrocketed to international prominence on screen following the success of Kleber Mendonça Filho’s quadruple-nominated “The Secret Agent,” which takes place in the Pernambuco capital, as well as being the home of other major Brazilian talent such as Silver Bear-winning “The Blue Trail” director Gabriel Mascaro and Marcelo Gomes (“Cinema, Aspirins and Vultures”).\n\t\n\n\tAround 200 guests are expected, including members of the Paradiso Talent Network, members of Projeto Paradiso’s advisory board, players from Brazil’s Northeast region, and international guests yet to be announced. Now in its third edition, the gathering brings together professionals from Brazil’s audiovisual sector who have previously received support from Projeto Paradiso, in what is described as “a unique encounter of an exceptional pool of talent.”\n\n\n\tSpeaking of talent, Projeto Paradiso is currently on a major roll when it comes to spotlighting Brazilian prodigies to the world. The organization recently attended the International Film Festival Rotterdam alongside over a dozen members of their talent network following last year’s announcement of the HBF+Brazil program, delivered by IFFR’s Hubert Bals Fund in partnership with the Brazilian philanthropic initiative, as well as RioFilme, Spcine and Embratur. The program is dedicated to supporting the early development of projects by second and third-time filmmakers from Brazil.\n\t\n\n\tThat momentum continues in Berlin, where, for the first time, films developed through Projeto Paradiso’s Incubator have their world premieres at a major A-list festival. The program, focused on the development of Brazilian fiction features, spawned two highly-anticipated Berlinale titles: Grace Passô’s debut feature “Our Secret” (“Nosso Segredo”), which was part of the 2021 cohort, and Allan Deberton’s “Gugu’s World” (“Feito Pipa”), developed in the 2020 edition of the program. \n\n\tPassô praised the Incubator, saying it has become “a reference for the development of film projects in Brazil.” The filmmaker said the support she received throughout the program was “fundamental to bringing ‘Our Secret’ to life. “Being part of a program that encompasses skill building, craftmaking, funding and human encounters was transformative,” she added. “As artists, we are always searching for a place like this: one where it is possible to think, live, and survive in the market without giving up on dreams and experiments that also challenge systems.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Our Secret,” courtesy of entrefilms / Wilssa Esser\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t‘Our Secret’ © entrefilms / Wilssa Esser\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Gugu’s World” screenwriter André Araújo highlighted the program’s decentralization efforts, recalling how he joined the initiative during the pandemic, a “time of great uncertainty for everyone and especially challenging for filmmakers from outside of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.” \n\n\t“Writing is, in itself, a solitary process, and the Incubator created a real space for exchange, both with other screenwriters and with mentors,” he continued. “The investment in the script and in the screenwriter, understood as the foundation of cinema, gave ‘Gugu’s World’ time and structure to mature. Premiering at the Berlinale has a very special meaning. It’s a project that was born from a very intimate place and now begins to exist in dialogue with other people, other cultures, and other perspectives. Beyond visibility, it’s the possibility for the film to circulate, create encounters, and open new paths.”\n\n\tDirector Allan Deberton emphasized the initiative’s focus on developing partnerships, saying that being part of the program “enabled the meeting of parties who went on to become co-producers and incredible partners. Deberton Filmes and Biônica Filmes came together through Projeto Paradiso, and for that I’m deeply grateful.”\n\t\n\n\tJosephine Bourgois, executive director of Projeto Paradiso, said it is an “especially meaningful” moment for the Incubator, given it was the first program launched by the philanthropic initiative. “Following projects from early development through to a premiere at a festival like Berlinale reinforces the importance of long-term, consistent investment in creative processes and in Brazilian filmmakers, strengthening their trajectories from the very beginning.”\n\n\tOn top of “Our Secret” and “Gugu’s World,” Projeto Paradiso is supporting another whopping seven Brazilian features playing in Berlin through their Brasil no Mundo initiative, focused on strengthening Brazil’s presence in international festivals and markets. Titles include Gabe Klinger’s “Isabel,” André Novais Oliveira’s “If I Were Alive” and Marcelo Martinessi’s “Narciso.” The organization is also present at the Berlinale Co-Production Market with Lô Politi’s “Apneia,” which is part of the Talent Project Market. \n",

    "body": "\n\tHow do you justify the unjustifiable? How do you get to the point where you feel morally in the right while you slaughter unarmed men, women and children? These are the questions director Emin Alper seeks to explore in “Salvation,” a film notionally about the longtail fallout from a land dispute, but more elementally about how violence happens. Set in a Turkish village high in the mountains, the director’s fifth film — and his first since the 2022’s Cannes Un Certain Regard entry “Burning Days” — follows the trajectory of Mesut (an excellent and tragically believable Caner Cı̇ndoruk), whose personal insecurities set him on a path leading to a massacre.Mesut has always played second fiddle to his handsome younger brother, Sheikh Ferit (Feyyaz Duman). Their grandfather was an important man, seen by some as a savior of their village. He was their Sheikh, a local cultural and religious leader, and he passed this status on, not, as might have been expected, to the older brother, but to the younger. Meanwhile, Mesut’s wife is pregnant with twins and he is troubled by anxious dreams and thoughts concerning her sexual life. In the village, men mutter about their land being taken over by outsiders.Psychologically, then, Mesut is on the back foot. Sexual jealousy, sibling rivalry and a broader feeling of impotence in the face of potential threats from outside combine in a potent brew that, lacking the ear of a good therapist, isn’t going to turn out well for anyone. That’s not to say that Alper falls into the fallacy of laying everything that subsequently happens at one man’s door: On the contrary, this is a smart study of a community.Cı̇ndoruk gives a nimble performance as Mesut: At first, he plays a kind of low-status grudge-bearer, the sort of person who might be characterized as a boot-licker if there were any boots around that he deemed worthy of licking. Into this vacuum of leadership, as he perceives it, some chosen one must surely arrive. Lo and behold, he realizes it is he himself who must be reluctantly entrusted with the mission to protect his people. As he convinces others of his cause, he blossoms, and we see in his manner and bearing a man stretching himself out and becoming accustomed to power.One of “Salvation’s” greatest strengths is in capturing a subjective sense of the threat that the villagers collectively feel themselves to be facing. The signs, portents and omens come thick and fast, almost to the point of caricature: a burned field, uncanny storms, a sleepwalking child, a pair of identical twin girls herding goats, and theoretical religious discussions of the possibility of having confused the roles of Cain and Abel. The mood is one of permanent unease, with all the characters bubbling away together in a melting pot of distrust.\n\t\n\tAlper strategically avoids creating a clean delineation between dream worlds and reality. This deliberate decision to not formally telegraph dream sequences has an intentionally disorienting effect: We can’t tell when a character is experiencing a dream or vision until something explicitly unreal takes place. While we might not sympathize with Mesut as he foments specific acts of violence, this all-pervading atmosphere of psychological threat helps us see how he convinces himself of his mission. This apposite demonstration of religious convictions being used to prop up concrete actions, spurred on and given fuel by tribalist rivalries, elevates “Salvation” from a merely striking mood piece to an astute psychological study.Sadly, the film isn’t mere fiction. In 2009, 44 people were murdered at a party in the Mardin Province of Turkey by masked assailants using automatic weapons and hand grenades. The attack left over 60 children orphaned. In taking this event as his starting point, Alper has created a film that is both culturally specific, and has plenty of wider applicability as well. There are, for instance, obvious parallels in “Salvation” with acts of violence committed by Israel in Gaza.But the relevance of “Salvation” is even broader: The rhetoric of politicians like Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin, or of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s statement that “we risk becoming an island of strangers,” plays on the same primal fears that allow Mesut to secure support for his bloodthirsty strongman tactics. As has been seen with ICE agents in the streets of Minneapolis, Mesut’s followers are very happy to indulge themselves in the sensation that they are noble soldiers defending themselves and their loved ones from foreigners, when they are in fact the aggressors.The fact that “Salvation” is not overtly and literally about ICE, Palestine or any of the aforementioned political figures may provide useful cover for any festivals, curators or distributors frustrated by institutional complicity or timidity in confronting these issues directly in their programming. This is simply a film inspired by a tragedy in rural Turkey that occurred nearly 20 years ago. And if audiences or critics wish to reach for contemporary parallels drawn from other examples of reprehensible violence? Why, then they may do so.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJohnny Knoxville and Jason Flemying are starring in two new thrillers from Vienna-based Pont Pictures that are slated to film in Serbia this year.\n\n\tKnoxville is toplining the psychological thriller “Night Sessions,” based a script by American writer Christopher Beachum that Pont Pictures’ Philipp Mair Vargas came across on the Black List database of unproduced screenplays.\n\n\tFlemyng, meanwhile, stars in “Fractal,” a time-loop thriller about a toxic relationship that leads to murder, from writer-director Faisal Hashmi, which will likewise lens in Serbia.\n\t\n\n\tPont Pictures is also producing “Tunnel Vision,” a supernatural thriller from American director Justin P. Lange, whose credits include the 2021 horror drama “The Seventh Day,” starring Guy Pearce and Stephen Lang, and 2022’s Blumhouse Television and MGM+ pic “The Visitor,” starring Finn Jones and Jessica McNamee.\n\n\n\t“Night Sessions” is directed by Austrian filmmaker Gregor Schmidinger, who made a critical splash with his 2019 debut feature “Nevrland.” Knoxville plays a charismatic psychiatrist from the U.S. living in exile in Berlin, where he hosts a late-night radio show. A rock-star therapist haunted by his past, Dr. Rick Brennan helps lonely and broken callers with their problems on his daily radio show, until his life is upended by a mysterious caller who accuses him of a horrendous crime, leading to a deadly cat and mouse game between the two.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPhilipp Mair Vargas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPont Pictures\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDescribing “Night Sessions” as one the best scripts he’s read in a long time, Mair Vargas says the part of Brennan is an “an actor’s showcase” and ideal for Knoxville.\n\t\n\n\tDespite the Berlin setting, the film will shoot entirely in the Serbian capital. “The movie is 90% inside the radio station,” notes Mair Vargas. “We found a nice location in Belgrade that has a view of the brutalist architecture and the brutalist nature of the city — it’s fantastic, a perfect fit.”\n\n\t“Fractal,” meanwhile, follows, Emily, who has been married to her abusive and alcoholic husband Tom (played by Flemyng) for six years and has finally had enough. She teams up with her ex-convict former boyfriend to kill Tom and bury his body in nearby woods. But what seems like the perfect murder quickly turns into a never-ending nightmare as they find themselves stuck in a terrifying time loop in which Tom keeps coming back.\n\n\tAlso attached alongside Flemyng is Gabriela Garcia Vargas.\n\n\tMair Vargas initially planned to shoot “Night Sessions” and “Fractal” in Austria, but after government budget cuts defunded the Austrian Film Institute’s ÖFI Plus funding initiative, he decided to head to Serbia, which offered an ideal alternative and a 25% tax rebate on local production expenditures.\n\n\tPont Pictures had previously used the ÖFI Plus subsidy program to finance international co-productions, such as Glenn McQuaid’s comedy-thriller “The Restauration at Grayson Manor,” starring Chris Colfer and Alice Krige.\n\n\tWithout the support of ÖFI Plus, shooting in Austria with private equity has become too high-risk under the current conditions, Mair Vargas notes.\n\n\tAustria still offers funding for international productions via its FISA Plus incentive aimed at film, TV and streaming projects and service productions via a 30% rebate, but Pont Pictures had utilized the ÖFI Plus vehicle, which specifically targeted Austrian films and co-productions.\n\n\tLikewise dealing with supernatural twists and turns is “Tunnel Vision,” a movie that is ultimately about grief, guilt and the trauma that can make kids turn into monsters, says Mair Vargas. “It’s such a great, metaphorical piece of art.”\n\n\tWritten by Moritz Licht and Jonas Steinacker, both former students of Michael Haneke, the story follows a troubled couple and their young son who, while driving through a tunnel in the Austrian Alps, become trapped in a nightmarish existence after a natural phenomenon suspends the rules of space and time.\n\t\n\n\tThe team is currently exploring options, and while Austria is the preferred location, in view of the current situation, that may not be feasible, Mair Vargas says.  \n\n\tPont Pictures is also working on “Amygdalla,” described as an elevated horror pic that plays with hyperrealism, co-directed by Adriana Mrnjavac and Nicole Stigler. The production is being revised following the ÖFI Plus cuts but the film will likely still shoot in Austria.\n",

The film claimed the number one position at Taiwan’s daily box office on January 12, overtaking “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” achieved consistent daily grosses exceeding NT$10 million ($318,000) since Jan. 16.  \n\n\n\t66cc Company Limited handles local distribution in Taiwan and international sales for the production. The film has already opened in Singapore and Malaysia alongside its Taiwan release. In Hong Kong, preview screenings began Jan. 17, with a theatrical rollout scheduled for March 5. Additional territories including Cambodia, North America, Australia and New Zealand are planned for March releases, while Vietnam is tentatively scheduled for April.\n\n\tThe ensemble cast features veteran actor Judy Ongg, alongside Chen Yi-Han, Sun Shu-May, Amber An and Chung Hsin-Ling. Director Lin previously gained international recognition with “More Than Blue” (2018), a box-office success that earned a Golden Horse Award nomination in 2019. His other credits include “Welcome to the Happy Days” (2015) and “A Trip with Your Wife” (2021).\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe first image from “The Idiot(s),” directed by Małgorzata Szumowska, who has twice won the Berlinale’s Silver Bear, and Michał Englert, has been released.\n\n\t“The Idiot(s)” stars “White Lotus” breakout Aimee Lou Wood, Johnny Flynn, who is in Berlin with “A Prayer for the Dying,” Vicky Krieps, who won a best performance prize at Cannes for “Corsage,” and Christian Friedel, who was also in “White Lotus,” as well as leading Oscar winner “The Zone of Interest.”\n\t\n\n\tCAA Media Finance represents the film’s North American rights, while The Match Factory sells the film internationally.\n\n\n\tThe story is based on the novel “The Gambler’s Wife: A True Story of Love, Risk, and the Woman Who Saved Dostoyevsky” by Andrew D. Kaufman, published in 2021, which follows the lives of the famous writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky and his wife Anna during a period that inspired him to write “The Idiot” — at the time a commercial flop, but today, considered one of the greatest novels in the history of literature.\n\n\tThe film is co-written by Szumowska and Englert together with Kasper Bajon and Bríd Arnstein. Englert also is in charge of cinematography. The producers are Vladimir Zemtsov, Ilya Stewart and Lota Dascioraite.\n\n\tSzumowska is a two-time Silver Bear winner at the Berlinale for “Mug” (2018) and “Body” (2015), and won the Locarno Special Jury Prize for “33 Scenes from Life” (2008). Englert was the cinematographer for all three films.\n\n\tSzumowska and Englert co-directed “Woman Of…” (2023) and “Never Gonna Snow Again” (2020), which both premiered in competition at the Venice Film Festival. Englert was a recipient of the Sundance cinematography award for “Lasting” (2013).\n\t\n\n\tThe film is produced by Gold Rush Pictures and Hype Studios. \n\n\tGold Rush Pictures slate includes “Club Zero,” “The Entertainment System Is Down,” “An Unfinished Film,” “The Fin,” “The Light” (Das Licht), “Glenrothan,” “Disappearance” and “Rosebush Pruning.” Hype Studios is a Paris and Los Angeles-based production company, known for “Persian Lessons” (2020) and the Palme d’Or nominee “Limonov: The Ballad of Eddie” (2024).\n\n\tWood is represented by CAA and Independent Talent, and Flynn is represented by CAA and United Agents.

    "description": "\n\tAustria continues to entice international film, TV and streaming productions with targeted funding, diverse locations and impressive infrastructure,",
    "body": "\n\tAustria continues to entice international film, TV and streaming productions with targeted funding, diverse locations and impressive infrastructure, despite the slashing of a key incentive that has rattled the local industry.\n\n\tThe country’s film funding programs, while reduced, still offer a wide range of support, particularly for international productions, and it boasts a slew of factors that make it a location hot spot.  \n\n\n\t“Even in the context of recent funding cuts, Austria remains a highly attractive destination for international productions thanks to its modern studios, excellent post-production facilities and highly skilled, internationally experienced film crews,” says Nina-Anica Keidies, film commissioner at Film in Austria.\n\t\n\n\tLast year the Austrian government, facing soaring debt and a faltering economy, implemented far-reaching budget cuts that hit the Austrian Film Institute (part of the culture ministry) and its ÖFI Plus location-based automatic funding program. Aimed at Austrian films and co-productions intended for theatrical release, the ÖFI Plus program has been all but scrapped, with its budget slashed from €44.3 million ($52.7 million) in 2025 to a mere €2.5 million for 2026. At the same time, ÖFI Classic funding for culturally relevant films was raised from €21 million to €39 million. According to the Austrian Film Institute, a solution is being sought to restart the ÖFI Plus incentive by next year. \n\n\tAustria’s other major incentive program, FISA Plus, is, unlike ÖFI Plus, part of the economy ministry. While it also saw its annual budget cut, it was by a less severe 30%, from €80 million in 2025 to €55 million this year. \n\t\n\n\tFISA Plus supports international film, TV and streaming productions as well as service productions via a 30% rebate plus a 5% green bonus for projects that meet environmental sustainability requirements, with maximum funding at €5 million per film and €7.5 million per series.\n\n\tSince its launch in 2023, FISA Plus has supported 193 projects with €180 million, generating €485 million in production spending in Austria, “including 55 international service productions and 61 international projects that came to Austria only for post production,” Keidies stresses. “This demonstrates a strong demand for the successful funding program.”\n\n\tIn 2025, more than 47 film productions in Austria were supported by FISA Plus funding program.\n\n\tKeidies adds: “The diversity and quality of the country’s infrastructure – from state-of-the-art studios and specialized service providers to sustainable production options – are frequently cited by international producers as decisive advantages. These factors ensure that Austria continues to be well positioned in the global market and able to attract ambitious projects. Nevertheless, access to funding remains a crucial factor for many large-scale productions when choosing a location.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Netflix hit “Crooks” returned to Vienna for Season 2, backed by the Vienna Film Incentive. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSebastian Kreuzberger\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAustria has in recent years proved a particularly attractive location for streaming and theatrical productions, among them Netflix’s German crime show “Crooks” and black comedy “Murder Mindfully” as well as its upcoming Spanish series “The Map of Longing,” Keidies adds.\n\n\tLeonine Studios’ “Bibi Blocksberg – Die Verhexte Zeitreise,” the latest installment in its hit big-screen franchise about a precocious girl witch, likewise shot on location in the country last year, securing some €1.9 million from FISA Plus in the process.\n\n\tOther local and international pics that lensed in Austria include Gastón Solnicki’s “The Souffleur,” starring Willem Dafoe as a hotel manager grappling with change, which shot in Vienna; and Sven Unterwaldt’s “Woodwalkers 2,” which continues the adventures of a shapeshifting cougar attending a school for fellow Woodwalkers. Filmed in the Alpine state of Tyrol, the pic, produced by Germany’s Blue Eyes Fiction, Studiocanal, Austria’s Dor Film Wien and Filmvergnuegen in Italy, benefitted from nearly €1.66 million in ÖFI Plus funding.\n\t\n\n\tNorbert Lechner’s “The Secret Floor,” which follows 12-year-old Karli, who, while in an old hotel in the Alps, is magically transported to 1938, where he befriends a girl and a boy amid the growing menace of Nazi Germany. The film shot on location at the historic Südbahnhotel in Semmering and at the Grand Hotel de l’Europe in Bad Gastein.\n\n\tOn the TV front, hit local series from public broadcaster ORF, such as medical drama “Pflegeleicht” and detective shows “Die Toten von Salzburg,” “Soko Donau” and “Schnell Ermittelt,” have continued to film across the country, Keidies notes. “These projects make use of Austria’s varied locations — from urban settings and historical backdrops to alpine landscapes — showcasing multiple regions and contributing to a vibrant year for film production.”\n\n\t“Austria has much to offer,” she adds. “Whether it’s Alpine mountain roads, remote villages, rich forests, historical and contemporary architecture, or vibrant urban life — it is a country of remarkable diversity.”\n\n\tIndeed, it is that rich diversity that continues to attract filmmakers.\n\n\t“As the national film commission, we frequently receive inquiries for locations featuring majestic mountains, picturesque alpine roads and historic sites, as well as iconic cities like Vienna and Salzburg. These contrasts within short travel distances make Austria an exceptionally versatile filming destination.”\n\n\tDespite funding reductions, international producers remain keen to shoot in the country, Keidies says. \n\n\t“We have a strong funding scheme with a fixed annual budget. This naturally limits the number of productions we can support; however, we notice that demand remains consistently high. Due to the shared language, we continue to maintain strong working relations with Germany, but we continue to receive requests from all over the world, including the U.K., the U.S. or Spain.”\n\n\tWhile competition in countries like Hungary and the Czech Republic remains high, Austria has managed to hold its own due to a number of factors.\n\n\t“First, Austria has the funding scheme FISA Plus with a location-based incentive of 30% plus an additional 5% green bonus on production costs in Austria, which is highly competitive,” Keidies points out.\n\t\n\n\t“Furthermore, under FISA Plus, it is also possible to apply for funding exclusively for post-production or music recordings carried out in Austria, offering additional flexibility for international projects.”\n\n\tAustria also offers regional funding programs in all of its nine states, including the Vienna Film Fund, the Vienna Film Incentive and the Cine Tirol Production Incentive. \n\n\t“Additionally, only a few countries in the world can consider themselves fortunate to be home to Alpine regions, and Austria is one of them,” Keidies notes. “One of the advantages of a comparatively small country lies also in the relatively short distances and the resulting efficient infrastructure. Moreover, Austria offers, as mentioned, an exceptional variety of locations — from breathtaking Alpine landscapes to historic cities, stunning architecture both historical and contemporary, as well as castles and palaces. This diversity makes Austria an outstanding destination for productions seeking unique and versatile settings.\n\n\t“Combined with highly skilled film professionals boasting international experience, multilingual capabilities, and solid training, Austria provides an outstanding environment for productions of every scale.”\n\n\tAmong Austria’s latest film productions, six high-profile titles will be premiering at this year’s Berlin Film Festival:\n\n\t“Rose,” Markus Schleinzer’s competition screener starring Sandra Hüller (“The Zone of Interest”), follows a mysterious soldier in 17th-century Germany who arrives at an isolated Protestant village claiming to be the heir to an abandoned farmstead, arousing suspicions among the locals.\n\n\t“The Loneliest Man in Town,” by Tizza Covi and Rainer Frimmel, likewise unspooling in competition, centers on a blues musician facing the loss of his home, only for a long-forgotten dream to suddenly resurface.\n\n\tUlrike Ottinger’s “The Blood Countess,” which premieres in Berlinale Special Gala, stars Isabelle Huppert and Birgit Minichmayr as a notorious noblewoman and her maid who embark on a quest for the elixir of life, the buried history of their ancestors and a book that threatens to destroy their kingdom.\n\n\tAdrian Goiginger’s “Four Minus Three,” which unspools in Panorama, follows Barbara, a professional clown struggling with a tragic loss that puts her hope and humanity to the ultimate test.\n\t\n\n\tSebastian Brameshuber’s “London,” likewise premiering in Panorama, offers a portrait of today’s Europe as it follows Bobby, who drives back and forth between Vienna and Salzburg, picking up strangers along the way and engaging with them in conversations that range from the everyday to the deeply personal.\n\n\t“Wax & Gold,” Ruth Beckermann’s Berlinale Special Presentation entry, looks at a grand hotel in Addis Ababa that was opened at the end of the 1960s by Emperor Haile Selassie and explores Ethiopia’s past and present, interweaving fact and fiction.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVariety is exclusively unveiling a new clip from “Light Pillar,” the feature debut from Chinese writer-director Xu Zao, which is in the Berlin Film Festival‘s Perspectives section.\n\n\tDubai-based company Cercamon recently acquired worldwide sales rights to the production, which screens in competition for the best first feature award in the strand.\n\n\t“Light Pillar” follows a solitary janitor working in a deteriorating film studio who becomes absorbed in a virtual romance before his illusion collapses. When a production crew arrives to film an alien invasion movie on the crumbling backlot, the janitor decides to vanish alongside the studio itself.\n\t\n\n\tThe genre-crossing romantic sci-fi drama with touches of comedy uses hand-drawn animation to portray the protagonist’s mundane reality while live-action sequences depict the virtual realm to where he escapes.\n\n\t“‘Light Pillar’ combines romance, science fiction, and comedy,” Xu said in a statement. “Although the story takes place in the future, its themes come from our lives today. In life, love and happiness are sometimes things we chase, but often they are already around us – we just don’t notice them because we’re distracted by everything else.”\n\n\tThe director explained his unconventional visual strategy: “Visually, the film mixes animation and live action to show two different worlds. Unlike the usual approach, animation here represents our protagonist’s real life, while live-action footage shows the virtual world. For him, reality feels flat, while the virtual world looks vivid, rich, and full of new possibilities.”\n\t\n\n\tDa Peng stars as the janitor and serves as executive producer on the film, which Lu Xiaowei produces.\n\n\tXu holds a master’s degree from the Beijing Film Academy’s School of Fine Art. His 43-minute animated work “No Changes Have Taken In Our Life” premiered at Rotterdam in 2023 and collected the Golden Dove for animated film at DOK Leipzig plus the Grand Prize at Japan’s Image Forum Festival. Beyond directing, Xu also wrote the screenplay and created the storyboards for “Light Pillar.”\n\n\tWatch the clip here:\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\t“Wuthering Heights,” a steamy romantic drama starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, is heating up the box office over Valentine’s Day weekend. \n\n\t",
    "body": "\n\t“Wuthering Heights,” a steamy romantic drama starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, is heating up the box office over Valentine’s Day weekend. \n\n\tThe R-rated film has debuted to $33 million from 3,682 North American theaters and is projected to earn $40 million through President’s Day on Monday. In a box office twist, “Wuthering Heights” enjoyed a bigger start at the international box office with $42 million for a global launch of $82 million. Since the initial domestic ticket sales are slightly softer than expected, the movie may rely on overseas audiences to justify its $80 million production budget (not including the tens of millions spent on the global promotional tour).\n\t\n\n\tEmerald Fennell wrote and directed “Wuthering Heights,” which is her third feature film following the Oscar-winning revenge thriller “Promising Young Woman” and ultra-provocative “Saltburn.” Netflix had offered to pay a staggering $150 million for Fennell’s take on Emily Brontë’s novel about a toxic couple in 18th century England. However, the filmmaker and producers, including Robbie, opted to take less money from Warner Bros. in exchange for a wide theatrical release and full-scale marketing campaign.\n\n\n\t“They were right [to want a theatrical release]. It’s paying off,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “The classic material, good-looking actors, and steamy treatment are connecting. Business should be strong overseas, thanks to Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi.” \n\n\tLike the spicy “Fifth Shades” trilogy and rom-coms “Isn’t It Romantic” and “How to Be Single” before it, “Wuthering Heights” was the de facto choice for females around Valentine’s Day. More than 75% of opening weekend crowds were women. However they were mixed on the film, which earned a “B” grade on CinemaScore exit polls, so it’s unclear what that’ll mean for word-of-mouth.\n\t\n\n\t“Wuthering Heights” towered over several newcomers, including the animated sports adventure “GOAT” and heist thriller “Crime 101” with Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Barry Keoghan. Two holdovers, survival thriller “Send Help” and the Angel Studios rom-com “Solo Mio,” rounded out the top five.\n\n\t“GOAT” debuted in second place with $26 million from 3,862 venues over the weekend and a projected $32 million through the four-day holiday frame. It’s a respectable start at a challenging time for original animation. (Disney’s Pixar, considered the gold standard in animation, has particularly struggled to launch a new property in several years.) Sony Pictures Animation, which produced “GOAT” for $80 million, hopes the well-received sports story will become a slow-and-steady hit in the vein of recent Universal and DreamWorks properties that showed impressive box office endurance, including 2023’s “Migration” (which opened to $12.7 million and eventually earned $300 million globally) and 2024’s “The Wild Robot (which debuted to $35 million and powered to $334 million worldwide).\n\n\tDirected by Tyree Dillihay and produced by NBA champ Steph Curry, “GOAT” follows an anthropomorphic goat who aspires to become the greatest of all time at a basketball-esque sport called roarball. Audiences, most of whom were families, gave the movie an “A” grade on CinemaScore exit polls, which bodes well for word-of-mouth. Plus, there won’t be competition on the kid-friendly front until Pixar’s “Hoppers” arrives in March.\n\n\t“Crime 101” stumbled in the No. 3 spot with $15.1 million from 3,161 locations over the weekend and a projected $17.7 million through Monday’s holiday. Rivals believe the four-day number will be closer to $15 million to $16 million. It would be a decent start for adult-oriented fare, except that Amazon MGM spent $90 million to produce the film. Since theater owners keep roughly half of ticket sales, “Crime 101” will need to stick around in theaters long after opening weekend to justify its price tag. Moviegoers were mixed, as evidenced by the “B” CinemaScore grade. Bart Layton (“American Animals”) directed “Crime 101,” which stars Hemsworth as an elusive jewel thief who plots high-stake heists across the Los Angeles freeway.\n\n\tAmazon MGM would argue that “Crime 101” doesn’t need to be a box office juggernaut in order to be successful; the e-retailer-turned-media giant is looking for theatrical to elevate the film’s launch on Prime Video. However those viewership metrics go largely unreported so it’s nearly impossible to know what constitutes a win in the streaming era. The studio, which has released the Chris Pratt-led “Mercy” and first lady documentary “Melania” earlier this year to middling results, could rebound in the spring with “Project Hail Mary,” a sci-fi adventure starring Ryan Gosling.\n\t\n\n\t“Send Help,” a well-reviewed horror film starring Rachel McAdams and Dylan O’Brien, slid to fourth place with $9 million over the weekend and an estimated $10.7 million through Monday. After three weekends of release (two of which were spent at No. 1), the Disney movie has generated $48 million and $72 million globally against a $40 million budget. Thanks to “Send Help,” as well as “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” Disney is the first studio to cross the $1 billion mark at the global box office. \n\n\tFifth place went to “Solo Mio” with $6.2 million over the weekend and a projected $7.8 million through the four-day stretch. The PG film, featuring Kevin James as a man who gets left at the alter and goes on his honeymoon alone, has grossed $18 million after two weekends on the big screen. \n\n\tAnother newcomer, sci-fi comedy adventure “Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die,” opened at No. 7 with $3.6 million from 1,610 theaters over the weekend and an estimated $4.1 million through Monday. Sam Rockwell and Haley Lu Richardson star in the film, which follows a futuristic man who takes hostages at a Los Angeles diner to recruit a band of heroes to help him save the world. Gore Verbinski, best known for directing three “Pirates of the Carribean” installments, directed “Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die,” with Briarcliff Entertainment handling the theatrical rollout. It received a “B” grade on CinemaScore.\n\n\tMore to come…\n",

The couple got married in 2018, and they share a son, Gene. When news of their split became public last year, Amy addressed it in her signature candid style, emphasizing the focus remains on co-parenting and mutual respect.\n      \n\n          While the breakup appears amicable, Valentine's Day can hit differently during a major life change, and Amy didn't pretend otherwise. Rather than posting flowers or a romantic tribute, she embraced the moment with a tongue-in-cheek setup that felt both vulnerable and on brand.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Schumer has long built her career on turning personal experiences into relatable comedy, and this was no different.

    "body": "\n\tAna Navarro is free, finally free, to say what she wants. And she wants listeners of her new podcast to know it right from the start.\n\n\tThe title of the new show, “Bleep! with Ana Navarro,” lets audience members know they’re in for an unfiltered version of the popular commentator, who appears regularly on CNN and ABC’s “The View.” The program launched Monday.\n\n\t“I can’t cuss on TV,” she acknowledges in a recent interview. Even so, she adds, “there’s a lot of s–t in the world that requires, that merits a good cussing.”\n\t\n\n\tNavarro is one of a growing line of popular analysts and commentators keeping their feet in two different worlds. One is the traditional-media news sources and the other is the growing digital-media realm, where many are trying to set up new offerings in hopes of catering to a younger audience that tends to get more of its information from social outlets and streaming venues.\n\n\n\tNavarro says she is eager “to form a sense of community” among people who believe the current news cycle is “as insane as it’s ever been in my lifetime.” “People tell me they are sad. They can’t sleep. They feel helpless. They feel hopeless,” she says. She hopes her program will give people a new source of conversation. “A lot of people are feeling alone and overwhelmed,” she adds, “I think it’s important to have that feeling that there are more of us than we think, and we are in things together.”\n\n\tThe weekly podcast is the latest project for Navarro, who has pivoted from working in and for Republican administrations to charting a more centrist positioning in her commentary and analysis work. “Bleep!” is the first new show to launch under iHeartMedia’s My Cultura Podcast Network and Hyphenate Media Group’s joint podcast slate, and is executive produced by Eva Longoria, who launched Hyphenate in 2023.\n\t\n\n\t“Eva is one of my best friends,” says Navarro. “We have conversations that are very truthful. We talk about politics. We talk about life. We talk about our families, our history and our heritage.” The idea for the podcast “grew out of those conversations.”\n\n\tNavarro will use “Bleep” to point out the courageous and cowardly, and to discuss things that offer the audience respite. “This last year has been hard on a lot of people and we have to give ourselves grace and the ability to find some joy,” she says. “Joy is most definitely a form of resistance” and can help “interrupt the barrage of s–t” that people grapple with every week.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHelsinki-based creator studio and production company Tarinatalli has appointed former Banijay executive Unne Sormunen as CEO and partner.\n\n\t“Tarinatalli is a talent-led creator studio built around the idea that the next generation of IP will be driven by personalities, communities and direct audience relationships. We see strong opportunities in Finland and in the Nordics as content trends, technology and distribution models are evolving rapidly,” he told Variety. \n\t\n\n\t“Recent podcast and talent deals by global players such as Netflix, Spotify and Amazon Prime Video show that platforms are increasingly investing in personality-led IP and long-term creator partnerships. We believe this shift is only accelerating.” \n\n\n\tHe added: “Our ambition is to scale a creator-first model that combines premium storytelling with audience-driven formats, branded partnerships and multi-platform distribution. We want to build sustainable IP with talents across audio, video, social and TV and create new revenue streams beyond traditional commissioning.”\n\n\tSormunen succeeds Jonna Linnanahde, who continues as COO and co-founder. Tarinatalli was founded in 2022 by TV personality, producer and podcaster Aki Linnanahde.\n\n\tAccording to Linnanahde, in its early years, the company focused on “premium podcasts and strong local talent.”\n\n\t“Recently, we have expanded into multi-platform storytelling, branded entertainment and strategic partnerships with platforms and brands. We see a clear shift toward personality-driven IP and long-term collaborations that creates exciting opportunities.”\n\t\n\n\tSormunen added: “Tarinatalli has recently produced some of Finland’s biggest podcasts, videocasts and creator-led formats for both platforms and YouTube. Going forward, we will focus on three key areas: talent-led content and personality-driven IP, branded entertainment and long-term partnerships with brands and multi-platform storytelling across audio, video, social and television.” \n\n\tThe company is also building strategic partnerships with traditional production companies and distributors. \n\n\t“Our digital-first approach allows us to develop IP in a more agile and cost-efficient way before scaling it into larger unscripted or scripted formats. In addition, we are actively exploring how AI and new technologies can support creative development, production workflows and audience insights while keeping human storytelling at the core.”\n\n\tSormunen most recently served within Banijay Group as managing director of EndemolShine Finland and CEO of Jarowskij Finland, overseeing the likes of Finland’s first Netflix original series “Dance Brothers,” “MasterChef,” “Big Brother,” “LEGO Masters,” crime drama “Detective Maria Kallio” and Prime Video’s first Finnish-language original, “The Bridge Suomi.”\n\n\tBefore joining Banijay, he spent five years as head of domestic programming at Finnish commercial broadcaster Nelonen. \n\n\t“We currently work with many of Finland’s leading TV hosts, radio personalities and podcast creators. Our role is to help them build long-term 360 creator businesses, not just individual shows. Brands are also moving from short-term campaigns toward long-term storytelling partnerships. Instead of advertising around content, they want to be part of the narrative. We see opportunities in this area, particularly in sports, lifestyle and entertainment,” he said.\n\n\tWhile Finland experienced a peak TV boom during the early 2020s, he said – “especially during the pandemic” – over the past two years, the market has become more challenging for scripted series and feature films as both public and commercial broadcasters have reduced investments.\n\n\t“Non-scripted production has remained a bit more stable, and audio and podcast platforms have grown significantly. At the same time, international streamers have been relatively cautious with local investments, partly because a local levy system has not yet been implemented. This has created a reset in the market,” he noted. \n\t\n\n\t“Producers and platforms are looking for more efficient development models, lower risk and stronger audience validation before making larger commitments.”\n\n\tThe biggest challenge right now? “Financing and risk-sharing in a fragmented and rapidly changing ecosystem.” \n\n\t“We see this moment as an opportunity. Lean operating models, strong talent relationships and closer collaboration between platforms, producers, brands and creators will be key. Companies that can build engaged communities and prove audience demand early will have an advantage,” assured Sormunen.\n\n\t“We believe the future belongs to producers that combine premium storytelling with creator-driven development and diversified revenue models. Our goal is to help talents and producers build sustainable IP and bring authentic local stories and formats to both Finnish and international audiences.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFangoria Studios has partnered with filmmaker-actor Luke Barnett on the upcoming horror short “Goodbye, Monster,” starring Barnett and Kue Lawrence with voice performances by Patton Oswalt and Tina Majorino. The film marks one of the first projects from the studio’s expanding slate of original genre projects. \n\n\tThe horror short is written and directed by Barnett. Per an official synopsis, “‘Goodbye, Monster’ centers on Wilson, a 12-year-old boy who receives one final visit from the creature under his bed. The short continues Barnett’s signature blend of empathy, emotional storytelling, and genre craft.”\n\t\n\n\t“Luke is someone we’ve watched make incredible choices over the past few years with his shorts, and we knew we wanted to be part of what he’s creating,” Tara Ansley, co-owner of Fangoria, said in a statement. \n\n\n\t“Goodbye, Monster” was shot using practical effects, with creature makeup designed by Dan Crawley (“The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Terrifier 3”). Vince Masciale and Natalie Masciale produced the short alongside Barnett. Executive producers include Tara Ansley, Armen Aghaeian, Abhi Goel, Jake Morgan and Cole Travis. Co-producers are Jake Bootz, Adam J. Losoya and Michael Brodner. \n\n\t“For anyone who loves horror, Fangoria is sacred ground,” said Barnett. “They’re champions of practical effects, fearless storytelling, and filmmakers who take big swings. It’s a dream come true to collaborate with a team so passionate about the art form. Long live practical effects.”\n\n\tBarnett recently appeared in the anthology drama film “Sunfish (& Other Stories on Green Lake),” which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2025. His script “Epilogue” was announced last year, with Mike Flanagan attached as executive producer and David Dastmalchian and Kate Siegel set to star.\n\t\n\n\t“Goodbye, Monster” is currently in post-production and will premiere on the festival circuit later this year. \n",

    "body": "\n\tRoy Wood Jr. doesn’t sound like Jake Tapper, Anderson Cooper or Erin Burnett. And yet, his importance to CNN could start approaching that of those popular anchors.\n\n\tWood isn’t at CNN to deliver the news. His hosting duties at “Have I Got News For You,” a comedic panel show that analyzes and laughs at some of the biggest events of the week — as well as some of the silliest — has him doing that, anyway. Of a sort.\n\n\n\t During one recent  — and raucous — Friday-night taping, Wood tilted back and forth with his two regular panelists. Amber Ruffin and Michael Ian Black, as well as two guests, comic Hasan Minhaj and Senator Adam Schiff. The group considered everything from recent behavior by Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina to content in the Epstein Files. Some of the segments come in the form of games, and elements of the program might remind viewers of a combination of “The Daily Show” and “After Midnight.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile the show offers up a lot of laughs and silliness, it’s the sort of thing where if you aren’t careful, you just might learn something before it all comes to an end.\n\n\tOther CNN shows can grill newsmakers and experts, says Wood. “Have I Got News For You,” which is in its fourth cycle of running on ten Saturdays, offers something different — a “release” from the headlines. “We like to have on people who may not know s–t. Because that also matches the American voter to some degree,” he says while preparing for a recent show’s taping. “You don’t have to know everything about everything, but you know good versus bad. You know right from wrong. And if you know that, then I feel like we have a show that’s probably the most relatable. And you’re most likely to see someone who looks and even feels like you. I mean, we’re probably the closest thing you could get to, say, the man on the street.”\n\t\n\n\tCNN is betting on the appeal of “Have I Got News For You” — and, potentially, other programs that examine news and current events through a alternate lens. “It’s sort of a natural thing that you would cover stories all week and do the tough stuff that we have to do,” says Amy Entelis, CNN’s executive vice president for talent, CNN Originals and creative development. But viewers are also ready, she says, for the network “to show our ability to step back and look at things from an entirely different angle.”\n\n\tIncreasingly, it’s a comic one. CNN has over the years tapped comics like W. Kamau Bell to lead an original series about American subcultures or enlisted D.L. Hughley to try this band a a Saturday-night program. There have in recent years been documentaries about TV comedy across the decades, and about single subjects including Gilda Radner and, in January, Chevy Chase. Both Fred Armisen, the former ”SNL” cast member and Craig Ferguson the former host of “The Late Late Show,” will both lead new CNN original series.\n\n\t“CNN’s foray into comedy-news is part of a bigger pivot to entertainment content by formerly ‘serious’ outlets to try to both stay afloat in linear and generate social media hits, especially with the dreariness of news under Trump 2,” says Nick Marx, a professor of film and media studies at Colorado State University who studies the cultural implications of comedy programs. CNN may have also noticed some of Fox News Channel’s recent weekend efforts with comedy content, he says, including shows from Jesse Watters, Greg Gutfeld and Jimmy Failia.\n\n\tCNN’s Saturday night schedule is where to find the laughs.  Repeats of Bill Maher’s HBO show “Real Time” kick off the primetime schedule and are often followed by the program executives call “HIGNFY.” Viewership has spiked for the series’ fourth season, in some weeks growing the audience from “Real Time.” The season debut on January 31 lured an average of nearly 1.04 million, its biggest audience since the series debuted in 2024 and a doubling of its audience from the third-season premiere. The fourth season debut beat other cable-news outlets among viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic coveted most by advertisers in news programs.\n\t\n\n\tCNN is helped by the fact that “Have I Got News For You” isn’t exactly an unknown property. The show has run in the U.K. since 1990, and is a TV staple in that nation. So much so that U.S. TV executives have tried on at least four different occasions to launch the show for American audiences, according to Jim Biederman, the program’s executive producer, who spent time developing TV programs with Lorne Michaels’ Broadway Video.\n\n\t“I’ve done pilots of it over 20 years,” he says, recalling efforts to get the series on NBC, Bravo, TBS and ABC. “Each time we did it, we got a little bit more American.” CNN, with multiple news shows featuring panels or roundtables, offers a natural habitat for the show, he suggests. “CNN is a network that kind of has panel shows in its DNA,” he says, which means “HIGNFY” is “not so foreign that you’re talking a different language to your network.”\n\n\tWood believes the show has broader appeal than many of its late-night contemporaries. “The true measurement of whether or not you’re reaching people is blue collar,” he says.  “. “Because that guy doesn’t have a lot of time to watch TV.” When he started hearing remarks about the program from baggage handlers and sanitation workers in the Midwest and New York he says,   “that’s when I really started feeling like we had found some degree of a stride.”\n\n\t“Have I Got News For You” isn’t put together like other programs. While it’s only an hour on CNN, the tapings can last more than two, because producers like to give the assemblage room to find a real conversation. Biederman and Jodi Lennon, the show’s co-executive producer, often spend hours on Friday nights and Saturdays editing the proceedings into something that shows off the panel’s ability to come together in real time. “There’s no script. you know, it’s just kind of playing along in this kind of improvised moment,” says Biederman.\n\n\tPart of the appeal is found in Wood’s teammates. Amber Ruffin and Michael Ian Black offer a sort of sweet-and-sour mix. Ruffin, who many people know form her appearances on “Late Night with Seth Meyers” sometimes plays innocent, as if she hasn’t read any news for weeks, only to surprise the audience with a hilarious remark in the end. Black, meanwhile, seems as if he’ s read every story on every subject.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m annoying. That’s my role. My role is to be annoying. Amber’s role is to be funny and delightful,” says Black. “We’re very rowdy, and I think we’re rowdier than what they bargain for, but it turns out it’s fun,” says Ruffin.\n\n\tNow that the program has been able to book members of Congress, there’s hope for other luminaries. Wood would love to get sports figures to visit the show. “There’s a lot of athletes that are a lot smarter than you presume them to be. Many of them might not even come on the show yet, because they still have brands to protect,”  he says. “But when you look at the influx of athlete led podcasts, they all like to run their mouths.”\n\n\tAll the participants are surprised that CNN hasn’t been more heavy-handed with the program. “We’ve been sequestered from the rest of the CNN, which I think is for the best. For both parties,” says Black. “They don’t want clowns running up and down their hallways squirting seltzer bottles. And I think we would like to avoid this sort of serious newsy vibe that’s going on over there.”\n\n\tThat separation can be a good thing. “This becomes the show that has an opportunity to stand out because it’s on the news network,” says Wood. “We’re not like anything else.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBrontë fever has officially hit Hollywood. \n\n\tFollowing the success of Emerald Fennell’s bodice-ripping take on Emily Brontë’s “Wuthering Heights,” Aimee Lou Wood is set to lead a series adaptation of Charlotte Brontë’s “Jane Eyre” from Working Title. “Succession” writer Miriam Battye is penning the script and a U.K. broadcaster is in advanced talks to board the project.\n\n\tThe 1847 novel — which was considered revolutionary for its first-person narrative style and approach to class, sexuality and female independence — follows the titular heroine as she grows into adulthood and falls for the brooding Mr. Rochester. The last major TV adaptation of “Jane Eyre” was in 2006, starring Ruth Wilson, while Cary Joji Fukunaga last adapted it for the big screen in 2011 starring Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender.\n\t\n\n\tEnglish actress Wood broke out in the Netflix series “Sex Education” before starring in the last season of “The White Lotus” alongside Walton Goggins. That role earned her critical and commercial acclaim, resulting in nominations at the Emmys, Golden Globes and SAG’s Actor Awards. \n\n\n\tU.K. production powerhouse Working Title is currently working on a film adaptation of Jane Austen’s “Sense and Sensibility” starring Daisy Edgar-Jones. Its other credits are a rom-com hall of fame including “Love Actually,” the “Bridget Jones” films, “About Time,” 2005’s “Pride and Prejudice” starring Keira Knightley and 2020’s “Emma” with Anya Taylor-Joy. Working Title’s most recent TV production was Lena Dunham’s Netflix series “Too Much” starring Meg Stalter and Will Sharpe.\n\t\n\n\tDeadline Hollywood was the first to report Wood’s casting.\n",

    "body": "\n\tU.S. President Donald Trump’s latest spat with Europe over tariffs is prompting a legislative impasse regarding European exports to the U.S. On Monday, European Union lawmakers postponed a vote to ratify a long-gestating trade deal that had capped U.S. import tariffs at 15%. \n\n\tThough the tariffs being discussed in the EU parliament apply only to physical goods and not film and TV, Trump recently reiterated his threat to slap hefty tariffs on films made overseas as part of the global trade war he has embarked on during his second term as president.\n\t\n\n\t“Trump is reshuffling the cards,” said François Godard, an analyst at Enders Analysis, adding that “as long as tensions are not resolved, and there is uncertainty, they represent “a risk on investment and on long term decisions made by companies,” including those in the media and entertainment sphere.\n\n\n\tNow, Trump’s legal authority to randomly impose tariffs is being concretely challenged by both the U.S. Supreme Court and the EU parliament.\n\n\tOver the weekend, Trump announced new additional international import tariffs “over and above our normal tariffs already being charged” after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down his previously implemented global tariffs policy in a landmark decision on Friday. This, in turn, has caused Europe to warn that the agreed trade deal is on hold.\n\n\tTrump has twice threatened to impose a 100% tariff on films made abroad, without explaining how that would work or what legal authority would allow it.\n\n\t“I’m going to be putting tariffs on movies from outside of the country — if they’re made in Canada, if they’re made in all these places, because Los Angeles has lost the movie industry,” Trump told the New York Post in late January.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s just hot air again,” a producer told Variety in September after Trump took to social media with a fresh wave of threats to impose tariffs on films made outside the U.S.\n\n\tBut the fact that Trump is not backing down can be cause for concern. \n\n\t“I think countries like Canada and the U.K. should be the most sensitive since there is a lot of production by American studios and for the American market taking place in both countries,” Godard noted.\n\n\t“Then there are question marks regarding the European policy towards American tech exports [to Europe] and American tech giants, as a form of retaliation,” Godard went on to add. “The matter is certainly not settled.”  \n\n\tHollywood unions have praised Trump’s attention to the issue of runaway production, but sought to redirect his interest to a more limited goal of extending and reauthorizing U.S. federal tax deductions that assist American producers to shoot more movies locally.\n",

    "description": "\n\tAt a presentation at this year’s Mip London, Ampere Analysis’ executive director Guy Bisson drilled down on the current state of factual television,",
    "body": "\n\tAt a presentation at this year’s Mip London, Ampere Analysis’ executive director Guy Bisson drilled down on the current state of factual television, looking into the booming effect of sports commissioning, the impact of YouTube as a destination for factual content and shifting differences between streamers and broadcasters. \n\n\tBisson gave Variety a comprehensive look into his research, compiled into a presentation titled “10 Factual Facts to Flourish in the Future.” The exec mentioned his previously coined 75% Peak TV as a point of reference, which refers to the 25% decrease in scripted commissioning since the peak of TV, around 2022. Conversely, factual commissioning is down only 15%, with Bisson calling it “one of the areas of opportunity.” Below is a breakdown of the main takeaways from Bisson’s analysis on the current moment for factual commissioning:\n\t\n\n\tGood news for once\n\n\n\tAs mentioned above, documentary commissioning is only down 15%, compared to the 25% decrease in scripted commissioning. Some subgenres within documentary, like biography and military and war, have “hardly dropped,” added Bisson. \n\n\tThe exec also highlighted how Western Europe is a “bit of a hotbed for documentary.” “If we look at the first six months of 2025, you can see that Europe has been stable while other regions have declined a bit. The majority of commissioning is going to Western Europe, and that is across four key genres: cultural, crime, biographical and historical.”\n\n\t“Western Europe and North America are going into recovery after a minor dip in the first half of 2025,” he noted. “A year earlier, we were in a bit of a mini-peak for documentary commissioning in North America and Western Europe. We’re now going back to levels we saw in 2024. Again, a positive story.”\n\t\n\n\tThe sports effect\n\n\tOne of the reasons for the steady numbers in factual is the rise of sports content commissioning. “As streamers move into live sports, they are commissioning content that is sports-related, like Netflix’s ‘Drive to Survive,’” said Bisson. “Within the areas that have benefited from that upswing in sports commissioning, documentary is the one that has benefited most.”\n\n\tOther major events, such as the Winter Olympics and the FIFA World Cup, help drive this demand. Original sports streaming series orders by the Global 6 streamers increased exponentially in 2024 before a small dip in 2025, which would signal a peak in commissioning tied to both major sports events taking place in 2026. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty\n\t\n\n\n\n\tYouTube impact\n\n\tWhile factual subgenres like crime are still majorly important commissioning drivers, with Bisson emphasizing it remains “the most important genre” and “has not declined since peak,” the truth is that streamers are pulling back “pretty much across the board” when it comes to greenlighting factual content. “Even crime has dropped a bit but, crucially, it remains 40% of their commissioning activity. That drop is very small.”\n\n\t“One reason that might be, and this is circumstantial evidence rather than numerical, is YouTube,” the exec pointed out. “I made a similar point around children’s content recently, where commercial players are pulling back from it, and even more so with documentary. Is it because children go to YouTube now? If adults are now going to YouTube for documentaries, is that one of the drivers for that pullback we are seeing from the commercially-driven players?”\n\n\tBisson noted how we are also seeing broadcasters “increasingly putting full-length content on YouTube.” “We are also seeing shorter windows between the two,” he said. “Basically 70% of documentary content is now dropping on a broadcaster’s YouTube channel within 30 days or less of its on-air premiere.”\n\n\tPublic broadcasters are more important than ever\n\n\t“The commercially-driven operator — that would include streamers, commercial broadcasters and traditional legacy pay TV players — is generally pulling back from documentary. Which means that public broadcasters, the most important commissioners anyway in documentary, have become ever more important. Public broadcasters are generally very news-driven, so when it comes to war-related content, culture, and what would fall into medical and health like mental health issues and the impact of social media on children’s mental health, these are all topics that are growing and that public broadcasters can move very quickly on, while streamers are a little less able to address. Broadcasters also have a lot of content they can adapt and repurpose very quickly to keep it topical.”\n\t\n\n\t“When we look at where streamers are pulling back, it is pretty much across the board. Even crime has dropped a bit but, crucially, it remains 40% of their commissioning activity. That drop is very small.”\n\n\tWhat do commissioners want?\n\n\tBased on the data gathered, Bisson neatly wrapped up commissioning trends for streamers and broadcasters. The exec emphasized there is “overlap,” but approached from different angles. “While broadcasters are also interested in crime, they’re after a social angle and often want to tie it to a historical perspective,” he offered as an example. “If you can work in some collective trauma, that helps, as well as connecting historical legacy to contemporary social challenge.”\n\n\tLooking at commissions by streamers, Bisson singled out content that offers “a new or untold angle, focus on personal cost and sacrifice, leverage infamy, expose institutional secrets and look for gendered or archetypal protagonists.” “If you can bring in the personal cost of sacrifice in sports performance or music, that’s going to help,” he noted.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix co-founder, chairman and former CEO Reed Hastings is continuing his long-standing support of Ukraine and aid for its war efforts. As Ukraine’s war with Russia enters its fourth year, Hastings just donated $5 million to White Stork, a charity that will use the funds to support combat medics along the frontline with anti-drone jamming systems and other help.\n\n\tHastings previously donated $2 million last year to White Stork, and before that, gave $1 million to Razom for emergency relief.\n\t\n\n\tWhite Stork, which is named for the national bird of Ukraine, bills itself as the largest non-governmental organization supplying individual first aid kits and anti-drone jamming systems to Ukraine. That’s key because Russia is flying weaponized first-person view drones into casualty evacuation vehicles.\n\n\n\t“The resource needs of Ukrainian combat medics are shifting as technology evolves on the battlefield. While evacuating wounded soldiers, medics must navigate a gauntlet of killer Russian drones that are persistently monitoring, and relentlessly targeting, anything that moves along the front line,” said White Stork head of mission William McNulty, who is also a U.S. Marine Corps veteran. “With Reed’s gift, White Stork is increasing production orders to 80 jamming systems per month. I am grateful for his enduring support for democracy in Ukraine.”\n\n\tThe anti-drone jamming systems, which blast electromagnetic noise at the radio frequencies that the drones use to operate, cost up to $7,000. \n\n\tWhite Stork has delivered more than 174,000 combat first aid kids and 471 jamming systems since the start of the war. The aid organization notes that 100% of jamming systems components and 67% of individual first aid kid component costs come from Ukranian manufacturers, in order to build up Ukraine’s domestic production capacity and reduce its reliance on foreign hardware donations.\n\t\n\n\t“I have discussed our need to maintain the technological edge on the battlefield with Reed. His donation provides Ukrainian soldiers with lifesaving technology and helps build up our defense industry through domestic production,” said Alexander Kamyshin, Ukraine’s presidential advisor for strategic affairs. \n\n\tOther aid supplied by White Stork include de-mining equipment, kevlar blankets, trench shovels, flame resistant flight suits and body armor.\n\n\tHastings has been known for his generous donations over the years, including $50 million to fund AI research for the humanities at Bowdin College; Netflix shares worth $500 million to Silicon Valley Community Foundation; $7 million to Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign; $20 million to San Francisco’s Minerva University; $10 million to Mississippi’s Tougaloo College, as well as $120 million to other historically Black colleges and universities; $1 million to police reform research group Center for Policing Equity; and $30 million to nonprofit immunization org Gavi Alliance, among others.\n",

    "description": "\n\tEvery time Noah Cyrus drives by a billboard for the upcoming Universal movie “Reminders of Him,” she gets giddy. It’s not because she’s a Colleen Ho",
    "body": "\n\tEvery time Noah Cyrus drives by a billboard for the upcoming Universal movie “Reminders of Him,” she gets giddy. It’s not because she’s a Colleen Hoover super fan per se, but Cyrus plays a key part in the project: the Grammy nominee penned the end credits song “Light Over the Hill” — her first track for a movie.\n\n\t“I feel like I’m on that billboard, even though I’m not,” Cyrus tells Variety, practically bubbling over with excitement. “I’m just so proud of it. Every time we pass the billboards, I say, ‘Oh my god, there’s my movie!’ It really is such a loving project; everything just feels so light and authentic about it.”\n\t\n\n\tWriting a song for a film had been one of Cyrus’ goals for years. (“There are two things you can’t do without music, and that’s fashion and movies and TV. They all go together,” she says.) So, when “Reminders of Him” director Vanessa Caswill reached out to discuss the prospect of writing a piece for the end credits, Cyrus was elated.\n\n\n\n\tCaswill wanted to show her the movie, starring Maika Monroe as Kenna, a young woman who returns to her hometown in Wyoming after serving five years in prison for a tragic mistake and hopes to reconnect with Diem, the daughter she’s never known. Everyone is intent on keeping them apart, but Kenna grows a bond with local bar owner Ledger (Tyriq Withers), who has become an important part of Diem’s life. Rudy Pankow (Scotty, Kenna’s first love and Diem’s late father), Lauren Graham, Bradley Whitford, Nicholas Duvernay and Grammy winner Lainey Wilson round out the ensemble cast.\n\t\n\n\tCyrus hadn’t read Hoover’s bestseller before the private screening, just her and Caswill, so she was able to react to all the story’s twists and turns in real time. “I’m a movie-before-book person. I have bad ADHD,” Cyrus says. “When I was a little girl, and I saw ‘Twilight’ for the first time, I watched all the [movies] and then read the books.”\n\n\tThat said, Cyrus’ mom, Tish Cyrus-Purcell, is a huge Hoover fan, so she’s a touch jealous that her daughter got a sneak peek at the big-screen adaptation, which hits theaters March 13. (“Oh my gosh, my mom was like, ‘I wish you would have told me. I would have gone,’” Cyrus says, laughing.)\n\n\t“We watched the film and I took my notes,” Cyrus says. She was particularly touched by the story’s themes about rebirth, which she’d recently explored on “New Country,” a song from her sophomore album. “I had this overwhelming emotion of how freeing it is to make a new start and the chance to rebuild yourself and make a better version of yourself for the people that you love. That inspired me.”\n\n\tAfter chatting with Caswill, Cyrus took her notes to the recording studio and got to work with her co-producer and co-writer, PJ Harding. “I was just trying to channel what the movie made me feel,” she says. “We felt this fresh lift of energy and hopefully of having love and family and the chance of a new start. The representation of light and that new beginning.”\n\n\tAs such, the instrumentation on the track became a folky-bluegrass blend. “Everything is so organic. It’s so light and airy [because] that’s what I felt from watching the film from start to finish.”\n\n\tThe song’s title, “Light Over the Hill,” represents a few things. “The light is Scotty. The light is hope. The light is love. The light is moving forward,” Cyrus says. “That’s what life is: every day we wake up and the sun is shining, that’s another blessing.”\n\n\tWorking with Caswill was a dream. “She gave me the artistic freedom to go where I wanted with the song,” Cyrus says. “We had some focal point on what we might want to touch on or specific words that could evoke feelings. But I wanted to create a song that sonically put you in the location and the community they live in, and music that the people in the movie would have liked.”\n\t\n\n\tBut writing a song for someone else’s art is a bit different than writing for one’s own vision. “As much as this was my song, I wanted this to complete their film. So, if it wasn’t going to be this song, I was ready to write another song,” Cyrus says. Fortunately, the filmmakers were thrilled with what she’d delivered. “They were just like, ‘This is it. It was everything we all imagined and more,’” she recalls. “We were all very aligned through the whole process. I’m so grateful this was my first opportunity, and it just left me so hungry to do more work with film and TV.”\n\n\tCoincidentally, Cyrus’ older sister, Miley Cyrus, was recently on the same path, contributing the end credits song for December’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” But Cyrus didn’t ask big sis for advice about writing for the screen; in fact, they didn’t even realize they were both in the studio on the same mission.\n\n\t“We are so not the family that, like, goes to each other and is like, ‘I’m doing this this week. I’m doing that this week,’” Cyrus says. “I totally didn’t know she was doing the ‘Avatar’ song until it was broadcast on my feed. Then we talked about how cool it was that we both had songs coming out in movies.”\n\n\tShe adds, “I really believe in gifts and blessings and things from the universe that just align, and I think that’s really one of them. It’s been a really, really cool thing to see my sister do her thing, while I also feel like I’m really getting a hold of mine.”\n\n\tRight now, the younger Cyrus is eagerly anticipating her movie moment. She won’t see the final cut of the “Reminders of Him,” with her song as its coda, until the Los Angeles premiere next month. (And yes, she’s going to make sure her mom sees the movie too.)\n\n\t“I ran into [Withers], and he was like, ‘I just saw [Caswill] and she was telling me about the song. She is so freaking excited!’ I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, do you want me to send it to you?’ and he’s like, ‘No! I don’t want to hear it until it’s in the movie.’” Cyrus says, grinning. “So, we’re all gonna see it in the movie together for the first time at the premiere. It’s gonna be such an amazing experience that I’m so, so honored and delighted to be a part of.”\n",

A housekeeper reportedly discovered Anna's body underneath her bed — and the ship returned to Miami, Florida, the next day, as the FBI launched an investigation. \n      \n\n          In the court docs, the legal team for Thomas Hudson, the stepbrother's father, says the Kepner family revealed his son's charges via social media on Feb. 3. The doc reads .... \"According to social media from the Kepner family ... the Petitioner/Father's son, TH, was charged by the United States Attorney in the Southern District of Florida for the [redacted] and homicide of Anna Kepner.\"\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TikTok/@fl.anna18\n          \n    \n          The emergency filing is part of a custody fight between Hudson and Shauntel Kepner, who are the parents of Anna's stepbrother. Hudson has asked for sole custody of Kepner’s other stepsibling, identified as BH.\n      \n    \n          In early February, TMZ reported the stepbrother was arrested by the U.S. Marshals Service and dragged before a judge for a closed-door hearing in a Miami federal court. Since the stepbrother is considered a juvenile, his criminal case has been sealed.   \n      \n    \n          The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida have not publicly commented on the Kepner case.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Anna Kepner\n              \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tNelson Peltz is accusing Bob Iger of manipulating the Walt Disney Company’s CEO succession plan — pushing for Josh D’Amaro to succeed him — in order to retain power after he steps down from the top job.\n\n\tPeltz, the billionaire co-founder and CEO of Trian Fund Management, suggested to the Wall Street Journal that Iger fought for D’Amaro, the head of parks and cruises, over entertainment co-chairman Dana Walden so he’d have a reason to stick around at the Magic Kingdom after he retires. Walden, a frontrunner for the CEO role who has deep ties to Hollywood, was elevated to the newly created position of president and chief creative officer.\n\t\n\n\t“Iger needs a reason to stay on,” Peltz said. “And if he put the person in charge of entertainment as the CEO, he wouldn’t have an excuse to stay on.”\n\n\n\tPeltz is alluding to the Disney’s prior succession plan, which crumbled after Iger handed the CEO baton to former parks chief Bob Chapek in early 2020. Weeks later, the pandemic plunged Disney — and much of the world — into crisis. Iger and Chapek fought internally over the transition before the Disney board ousted Chapek in late 2022 and Iger returned as CEO.\n\n\tDuring Chapek’s brief tenure, he clashed with Hollywood talent, including Scarlett Johansson over her payday tied to the COVID-era release of “Black Widow.” \n\n\tPeltz predicts that Iger will eventually try to undermine D’Amaro and determine that “Josh doesn’t know anything about the movie business…Therefore, I’m gonna stay on and guide them.”\n\n\tD’Amaro’s appointment will be effective on March 18. Iger will remain a senior adviser and member of the Disney board until his retirement from the company at the end of the year. James Gorman, chairman of Disney’s board, orchestrated the succession process. Gorman says the second transition attempt will go smoother and told Variety that D’Amaro isn’t a complete newb to the entertainment sphere.\n\t\n\n\t“He has some experience. He’s been sitting on Bob’s operating committee for several for several years. He’s participated in a number of the movie versions as they’ve gone through the various editing processes. He’s worked with directors in bringing like [James] Cameron and bringing the Avatar franchises into the park,” Gorman said on Tuesday. “It’s not like he’s come out of nowhere.”\n\n\tPeltz has been a long-time adversary of Iger, having waged two high-profile proxy wars against Disney over his many gripes with the company, including its prior succession plan. Peltz alleged that Disney’s board failed to do its job the first time around by not properly vetting Chapek. After the activist investor lost his bid to win seats on the Mouse House’s board, he reportedly sold all of his Disney stock and made about $1 billion on the sale.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThough Apple is still on an award season run with “F1,” the tech monolith popped the hood on numerous new movies they will release in 2026.\n\n\tAt a blowout media event in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Apple Studios took over Santa Monica’s Barker Hangar to unveil footage and conversations from its forthcoming slate. Cameron Diaz, Keanu Reeves, Chris Pratt, Amy Adams, Colin Farrell and more showed to create buzz with global press and influencers.\n\t\n\n\tWhile heavy on series, five feature titles were introduced, starting with Jonah Hill’s “Outcome.” The film will mark Hill’s third directorial effort, after 2018’s “Mid90s” and the 2022 therapy documentary “Stutz.”\n\n\n\tLed by Reeves, Diaz and Matt Bomer, “Outcome” tells a story of sobriety and redemption through a Hollywood lens. Reeves plays Reef Hawk, a movie star who spends five years off the grid recovering from heroin addiction.  As Hawk’s handlers, Bomer and Diaz learn that a mysterious and incriminating video featuring the actor may come to light. The team struggles to find out what could be on the tape, sparking an amends spree for the leading man that helps him confront old ghosts and ask for forgiveness.\n\n\tIt’s interesting to see Hill explore themes of isolation and public exposure. The actor-director himself has kept a low profile since 2023, when his ex-girlfriend and pro surfer Sarah Brady published private text messages that many viewed as controlling and abusive on Hill’s part.\n\n\t“Outcome,” which Hill co-wrote with Ezra Woods, asks what an apology really means and who it serves. An early trailer was played for the crowd, the highlight of which was a cameo from soap queen Susan Lucci (she plays Reeves’ expletive-spewing mother). It has a “Jay Kelly” vibe, left bleaching in the Malibu sun (where much of the movie seems to be set).  The film hits Apple TV globally on April 10.\n\t\n\n\tNext came the briefest of looks at “The Dink,” a pickleball comedy starring Jake Johnson, Mary Steenburgen and Ed Harris. Johnson, of the beloved “New Girl” ensemble, plays a tennis prodigy cut short after a run-in with Andy Roddick. To the chagrin of his dad (Harris), Johnson’s character takes up pickleball with Steenburgen as a partner. He finds a new passion and confronts old demons while enjoying, presumably, very low-impact cardio. Josh Greenbaum (“Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar”) directs, and the film hits platform on July 24.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom left: Arturo Castro, Jessica Beil, John Cena, Teyonah Parris, Sam Richardson. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Apple\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThird up was “Matchbox The Movie,” what will be Mattel Films’ second significant outing since the unit relaunched in 2023 with box office phenomenon “Barbie.”  A trailer played for the room showed off what seems to be a squeaky-clean take on “Fast and Furious.” The cutesy ensemble includes John Cena and Jessica Biel (who have surprising chemistry, and it’s so nice to see Biel back on a movie screen), Sam Richardson (“Veep”), Teyonah Parris (“The Marvels”) and Arturo Castro (“Broad City”). Skydance co-produced the project, which hits October 9.\n\n\tChris Pratt touched down to reveal “The Way of the Warrior Kid,” an adaptation of Navy SEAL Jocko Willink’s nonfiction work that teaches kids about valor. Pratt plays uncle to the oft-bullied Marc (“Belfast” star Jude Hill) and helps train him in the ways of self-defense and integrity. Linda Cardellini co-stars, and McG (“Charlie’s Angels”) directs for a November 20 release.\n\n\tThe day wrapped with a virtual message from Ryan Reynolds and Kenneth Branagh, speaking from the set of Apple and Skydance’s “Mayday.”  \n\n\tThis Cold War-era action comedy is a first for Reynolds, who is probably happy to be fighting a different kind of battle. The actor said he finally “gets to play the character in need of saving” in the pre-recorded greeting. As a Navy pilot who crashes on Russian territory, Reynolds relies on Branagh’s ex-KGB agent to help him survive and protect American interests. That hits Apple TV Plus on September 4.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTracy Zamot, a veteran publicist who worked for Atlantic, Virgin and Motown Records, Pandora Radio and others, has died after a long illness, her family has confirmed. No specific cause of death was announced; she was 55.\n\n\tA graduate of the State University of New York at Albany, Zamot’s joined Atlantic Records as a tour publicist in 1992 and rose to vice president over the course of her decade with the company, which saw her work closely with such artists as Matchbox 20 and Rob Thomas, Genesis and Phil Collins, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin, and many others.\n\t\n\n\tShe left Atlantic in late 2001 to join Virgin Records, which at the time was run by her former Atlantic colleague Jason Flom. There, she worked closely the such acts as Lenny Kravitz, Gorillaz, Iggy Pop and others. A two year stint with Universal Motown Records followed next.\n\n\n\tShe returned to high-profile roles in 2015 when she joined Pandora Radio, serving there for nearly three years before a brieft stint at SiriusXM.

    "body": "\n\tChristian Bale revealed to Entertainment Weekly that he spent six hours in the makeup chair in order to transform into Frankenstein’s monster for Maggie Gyllenhaal’s “The Bride!” Bale stars in the reimagining of the 1935 film “Bride of Frankenstein” opposite “Hamnet” Oscar nominee Jessie Buckley, who plays the title role. Buckley spent an hour and a half in the makeup chair for her transformation into the Bride.\n\n\t“I would scream like crazy, every day. Just to [release the] despair, all of that restraint that you have to display when you’re sitting still for that long,” Bale said about how he kept himself “from going insane” amid the six-hour transformation.\n\t\n\n\t“I didn’t want to do it driving into work because I thought I might cause a crash. And I didn’t want to do it by myself because I thought everyone would just think I’m going nuts,” Bale said about screaming. “Oh man, I’m telling you, the whole crew got involved by the end because people would hear us screaming. We would open the doors, and gradually, a bit like the Bride’s revolution, a few people were going, ‘Can we do it too?’ And then by the end, there were like 30 people who would hear us and run to the makeup trailer to be a part of it and scream as well.”\n\n\tBale is well known for his intense physical transformations across his acting career. He went on an all-protein diet to bulk up for “American Psycho,” for instance,” and infamously spent four months shedding 60 pounds so he could weigh 120 pounds for “The Mechanist.” His diet for the movie consisted of having “water, an apple, and one cup of coffee per day.” Bale then put on 100 pounds of muscle in six months to play Bruce Wayne in Christopher Nolan’s “Batman Begins.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Bride!” opens in theaters March 6 from Warner Bros. Head over to Entertainment Weekly’s website  to read more about the making of the movie.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRay Romano is set for a lead role in the HBO Max drama pilot “How to Survive Without Me.” \n\n\tAs previously reported, the pilot hails from writers and executive producers Greg Berlanti and Bash Doran, with the story by Berlanti, Doran and Robbie Rogers. \n\n\tThe logline for the pilot states, “In the wake of matriarch Beverly’s passing, the De Angelis family have begun to drift, unsure how to manage their complicated, evolving lives without her guidance, but in true Beverly fashion, she found a way to keep running the show from the beyond. Should they wish to experience Beverly’s final work, the family must find the time — and make the effort — to remain connected, and be there for each other through all of life’s challenges yet to come…”\n\t\n\n\tRomano will star in the pilot as Leo, who is described as “newly a widower and suddenly performing the lead role of parent that he never auditioned for. As his five, complicated adult children begin to navigate life without their mother at the center, Leo is forced to find his own voice as a parent, moving out of wife’s shadow to become the family’s new, differently effective center.” \n\n\n\t“We are so excited to work with Ray on ‘How to Survive Without Me,'” said Sarah Aubrey, head of Max Original Programming. “The show harkens back to the kinds of aspirational family dramas that Greg does so well, a grounded narrative centered around navigating love, loss, and a one-of-a-kind family. It’s a project designed to return year after year, continually deepening the audience’s connection to these beloved characters and their unique story.”\n\t\n\n\tAlong with the aforementioned EPs, Rogers is also executive producing alongside Sarah Schechter and Leigh London Redman via Berlanti Productions and its overall deal with studio Warner Bros. Television. \n\n\t“Ray is a beloved icon who has an incredible gift for bringing both depth and levity to every character he portrays,” said Clancy Collins White, president of creative affairs for Warner Bros. Television. “We’re thrilled to welcome him to ‘How to Survive Without Me’ as Leo, the patriarch woven into this deeply moving family story. We know his performance will bring nuance and heart to Greg and Bash’s vision, and form a powerful emotional connection with viewers.”\n\n\tRomano is best known for starring in the self-titled sitcom “Everybody Loves Raymond,” which ran for nine seasons and remains popular to this day. His more recent TV roles include the upcoming second season of “Running Point,” “No Good Deed,” “Made for Love,” “Bookie,” and “Bupkis.” In film, Romano starred in “The Irishman” for Martin Scorsese as well as features like “The Big Sick” and the “Ice Age” animated movie franchise.\n\n\tHe is repped by WME, LBI Entertainment, The Conversation Company, PMK Entertainment and Del Shaw Moonves Tanaka. \n\n\t“How to Survive Without Me” is one of two drama pilots that HBO Max is currently prepping, with the other being the cop drama “American Blue” starring Milo Ventimiglia. The move comes as the streamer is looking to develop more shows in the same vein as “The Pitt” following the breakout success of that show when it debuted in 2024. \n\n\tDeadline was first to report Romano’s casting. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 68th annual Grammys drew an average of 14.4 million viewers on Sunday night, which marked the ceremony’s last time airing on CBS before its upcoming move to ABC.\n\n\tMeasured by Nielsen, that total represents a 6% decrease from the 15.4 million viewers the ceremony drew year before — which was itself down 9% from 2024 — while still ranking as the most-watched awards show since last year’s Oscars hit 19.7 million viewers.\n\n\n\tCBS also touts that the Grammys were the “most social” TV program in the last six months with 74.8 million total interactions and 302.5 million total video views.\n\t\n\n\tAiring at 5 p.m. PT, the Grammys were hosted by Trevor Noah for the sixth consecutive year. Variety music critic Chris Willman wrote in his review of the show that Noah remained apolitical, “doing the inoffensive opposite of his ‘Daily Show’ persona” while “celebrating who was in the room, with no edge to any of the recognitions”; at the same time, “there’s something sweet about his ultra-avuncular cheerleading for the artists that may be missed, depending on who ABC lands as his successor next year.” Overall, he wrote, “the tension between the show’s somber and silly moments felt a little difficult to navigate, but that’s a reflection of how a lot of us are torn between the lure of celebratory entertainment-as-usual and a righteous anger, or sadness, over the chaos being wreaked by the federal government in local communities.”\n\n\tBad Bunny won the award for album of the year, making headlines for saying “ICE out” and advocating for Latinos in his speech. Kendrick Lamar was the biggest winner of the night, taking home five trophies including record of the year. See the full list of winners here.\n\t\n\n\tThe Grammys were produced by Fulwell Entertainment for the Recording Academy. Executive producers included Ben Winston, Raj Kapoor, Jesse Collins and Noah.\n",

    "body": "\n\tApple TV‘s upcoming “Cape Fear” series starring Javier Bardem, Amy Adams and Patrick Wilson will premiere with two episodes on June 5. The images were unveiled at Apple TV’s 2026 Press Day on Feb. 3, as well as a teaser that played only in the room. Creator and showrunner Nick Antosca moderated a panel with Wilson and Wilson.\n\n\tThe 10-episode drama series is based on John D. MacDonald’s 1957 novel “The Executioners” as well as Martin Scorsese’s 1991 film “Cape Fear,” which was a remake of Gregory Peck’s 1962 adaptation of the novel. Scorsese is an executive producer on the new series, as is Steven Spielberg, who executive produced Scorsese’s adaptation.\n\t\n\n\tAntosca introduced the panel by talking about how much Scorsese’s movie scared him — which Wilson and Adams agreed with — saying, “there’s a kind of feverish energy to it,” and “it’s Southern, it’s swampy — it looks like a nightmare.” Antosca said that he didn’t want to spoil any twists, but that the original story has been “reimagined.”\n\n\n\tIn this version of the story, which examines “America’s obsession with true crime in the 21st century” according to an official description, “a storm is coming for happily married attorneys Anna (Adams) and Tom Bowden (Wilson) when Max Cady (Bardem), the notorious killer they are responsible for putting behind bars, is let out of prison — and he wants vengeance.” The ensemble cast also includes CCH Pounder, Joe Anders, Lily Collias, Jamie Hector, Malia Pyles, Anna Baryshnikov, Ron Perlman, Ted Levine and Margarita Levieva.\n\n\tAntosca asked Adams and Wilson about how they captured the story’s “elemental terror,” and they talked about being parents trying to protect their children at all costs — “full stop,” Adams said.\n\t\n\n\tAdams said that Bardem brought his “natural charisma” to the role of Max Cady, made iconic in the films by Robert Mitchum and Robert DeNiro. But Bardem put a twist on the villain role, Adams said: “He also brings a lot of vulnerability, and there’s so much devastation in this betrayal. I look forward to you guys getting to see it.”\n\n\tAntosca considers the Scorsese film to be firmly in the horror genre, a tone that inspired the series as well. “The first moment the show, to me, is about ambient dread,” Antosca said. “And it reflects the atmosphere of being alive in 2026, with its uncertainties and ambiguities and paranoia.”\n\n\tAlong with Scorsese and Spielberg, executive producers include Antosca and Alex Hedlund via Eat the Cat; Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey for Spielberg’s Amblin Television banner; Bardem; Adams; and Morten Tyldum, who also served as director on the pilot. The series was developed and produced through Universal Studio Group’s Universal Content Productions, where Antosca has been under an overall deal since 2017.\n\n\tApple TV also debuted a first look at Bardem, Adams and Wilson in character.

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the seventh episode of “The Traitors” Season 4, now streaming on Peacock.\n\n\tLisa Rinna made it seven episodes as a Traitor on Season 4 of “The Traitors” — long enough to wear the dress she wanted to to the Black Banquet and rack up an impressive body count. During her time in the game, the Traitors successfully murdered “Big Brother” star Ian Terry, “Survivor” legend Rob Cesternino, “Real Housewives of Dubai” star Caroline Stanbury, “RuPaul’s Drag Race” winner Monét X Change and “Survivor” winner Yam Yam Arocho.\n\t\n\n\tFor fans accustomed to Rinna’s chaotic, scene-stealing antics on “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” “The Traitors” revealed a different side of her — a calculated, strategic and surprisingly stealthy one. She kept off the Faithfuls’ radar for weeks until Yam Yam, whom she had just murdered at the Black Banquet, screamed her name as he was escorted out and sealed the deal.\n\n\n\t“I literally kill him, and then as he’s being taken out, he screams my name,” she tells Variety. “That’s good TV… like, he just sunk you.”\n\n\tThe “RHOBH” alum was selected as one of the original Traitors alongside Candiace Dillard Bassett and Rob Rausch. In Episode 7, Rob led the charge to banish her, voting against her and convincing the house to eliminate her despite her efforts to redirect suspicion toward “Survivor” star Natalie Anderson. Lisa admitted she had no idea her Traitor ally was orchestrating her downfall until after the episodes aired.\n\n\tThe intensity of the experience required recovery time, but she has no regrets — and plenty of opinions about the Faithful players’ detective skills. “The Faithfuls are so bad,” she says. “They really are; they’re terrible.”\n\t\n\n\tBelow, she spoke to Variety about Rob’s betrayal, that infamous Yam Yam moment, her dynamic with Colton Underwood and why she “loved murdering people.”\n\t\n\t\t‘The Traitors’ seems very stressful to be a part of. Your daughter mentioned to Variety that you needed time to “heal” after filming. What was that process like?\t\n\n\tIt did take me a minute to kind of recalibrate. It’s an intense experience, and so I needed a little time. And now I’m great. My husband and I were watching the show, and he was watching the roundtable with Michael [Rapaport] and Colton, and he goes, “OK, now I understand what you went through. There’s a lot of psychosis going around this table.” Finally, you understand what I went through.\n\t\n\t\tRob voted against you, and kind of led the charge to get you banished —\t\n\n\tKind of? Kind of? Hello!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEuan Cherry/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYes, it was him. When did you realize he was willing to sacrifice you?\t\n\n\tI never knew. I mean, he voted for me the night before, so my spidey senses were already up. But I had no idea that he was leading the charge the next day. That’s surprising, but that’s the game. He’s smarter than I am, because everyone thought it was going to be me going against the Traitors, and it wasn’t. I can’t fault him for it. It was sad, because I love my little Traitor group, my little Traitor family. It’s great to kiki and have fun, but at the end of the day, it’s called “Traitors.” This always happens — Traitor-on-Traitor crime. I happen to be the Traitor-on-Traitor crime. I’m kind of glad it wasn’t me doing it. He’s getting a lot of shit for it, and I think he deserves every bit of it.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s talk about the Black Banquet and Yam Yam screaming your name. Did you actually kiss him differently than anyone else?\t\n\n\tI air-kissed everyone. If you look at the tape, he comes in to kiss me first. It’s not me. And I don’t kiss people — I air kiss people. He also has a beard. You’re not going to go in and kiss a beard. It was frustrating that it was all about the kiss because we know it was about the amulet. But you can’t say that… The minute he screamed my name, I was like, “Oh, Rinna, you’re sunk. You’re sunk. That’s it.” No matter what, his conviction was so strong that I can see why Rob was like, “All right, well, she’s a sinking ship. I might as well just literally sink her.” He’s going to have a little karma for that, but that’s OK. He’s young. He’ll figure it out.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSo what was your first reaction when Yam Yam yelled your name?\t\n\n\tMy first reaction was, “Did he just say your name?” And then I was like, “Oh my God, he just said my name.” Inside, I’m laughing because you can’t write that. I literally kill him, and then as he’s being taken out, he screams my name? That’s good TV. The producer kind of thing in my head is going, “Wow, that’s really good.” I was sunk the minute he screamed my name with such conviction. No matter what, I was just like, someone should just give me a cigarette and I’ll just go.\n\t\n\t\tYou and Candiace almost flipped the vote onto Natalie. Do you think you could have survived another round if it weren’t for Rob coming after you at the round table?\t\n\n\tI do — I think that I could have gone one more episode. It was already going toward Natalie, but Rob must have wanted to keep Natalie. I’m not sure what his gameplay is, but there’s a reason why he went after me, and I’ll ask him that at the reunion. “What made you finally make that decision?” Because I’m curious. \n\t\n\t\tColton had it out for you for much of the game, and he’s received a lot of negative attention online since the show premiered. You made a joke about him being a “stalker,” seemingly referring to his past, but you later apologized. What’s your relationship with him now?\t\n\n\tI didn’t know anything about his past. I will say, in my defense, he wanted a Housewife, so I gave him a Housewife moment in my sassy response to a thread message. Then it was like putting gas on a fire, and I didn’t want to do that. It’s not what I’m out to do. Listen, he was a great nemesis for me. I can see that, and I thanked him for it while we were in the game. I saw it for that. It makes me sad that anybody gets hate online, because I’ve been through it, and I certainly don’t want to be a part of somebody else’s hate online. So I didn’t like that.\n\t\n\t\tDid you enjoy being a Traitor?\t\n\n\tI loved murdering people. It was so much fun. I loved being a Traitor. I loved every second of it. I wouldn’t change anything. I had the best time of my life.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNow it’s Tom Llamas‘ turn to try his hand at a Super Bowl tradition: the pre-game interview with the President of the United States.\n\n\tLlamas, the anchor of “NBC Nightly News,”  will sit down with President Donald Trump for an exclusive  interview at the White House on Wednesday, February 4. A portion of the exchange will air on “NBC Nightly News”  at 6:30 p.m. eastern that day, with an extended version streaming on “Top Story with Tom Llamas,” the live-streamed programs shown on NBC News Now, at 7 p.m. \n\t\n\n\tA separate segment of the interview will air during NBC’s Super Bowl pre-game show on Sunday, February 8. \n\n\n\tNBC’s handling of the “get” spotlights how much the business of news has changed. In most years, the Super Bowl pre-game interview got the most emphasis, with other segments following across other shows backed by the news outlet that snared the access. But in an era when news doesn’t hold for very long, NBC News may feel obligated to share what it has as soon as its able. \n\n\tOne reason for the different order in distribution? The interview, which became a more formal part of the Super Bowl ritual during the Obama administration, has become less of a guarantee in recent years. President Trump avoided one with NBC News in 2018, and President Joe Biden didn’t take part in one with Fox in 2023 or CBS News in 2024 — in hindsight, that decision may have been tied to what were perceived to be some declines in his public-speaking abilities.\n\n\tTrump sat down with Fox News’ Bret Baier for a pre-taped exchange that aired ahead of Fox’s telecast of Super Bowl LIX in 2025. President Joe Biden spoke to NBC’s Lester Holt in 2022. \n\t\n\n\tA bevy of TV journalists have described the Super Bowl interview as one of the toughest assignments in TV news. Over the years, notable anchors including Gayle King, Scott Pelley and Matt Lauer have interviewed the president, all of them live. “I would say it’s the most important interview of my life,” Bill O’Reilly told Variety in 2017 in the hours leading up to his interview with Trump before Fox’s broadcast of Super Bowl LI. NBC News’ Savannah Guthrie interviewed President Obama in 2015, and told Variety the process was “really tricky.“\n\n\tBut it has become less so during Trump’s time in office. The interviews in recent years have almost all been taped beforehand, giving news organizations the chance to edit remarks and decide how best to feed different programs and various platforms that range from streaming services to traditional TV shows.\n",

    "body": "\n\tElle Fanning paints her body green and fires up OnlyFans in the teaser trailer for “Margo’s Got Money Troubles,” an upcoming Apple TV dramedy about a young woman who is forced to reckon with the financial burden after an unplanned pregnancy — the result of an affair with her creative writing professor. The teaser was unveiled at Apple TV’s 2026 Press Day on Feb. 3.\n\n\tMargo, a community college dropout and aspiring writer, must come up with creative ways to pay the bills, so she posts alien-themed fetish content on OnlyFans and watches the tips roll in. The series, premiering on April 15, also stars Michelle Pfeiffer as Margo’s ex-Hooters waitress mom and Nick Offerman as her ex-pro wrestler dad. Nicole Kidman and Thaddea Graham also star, and Marcia Gay Harden, Greg Kinnear, Michael Angarano, Rico Nasty and Lindsey Normington round out the cast.\n\t\n\n\tA panel at the event at the event was moderated by Rufi Thorpe, who wrote the source material, a bestselling novel of the same name, and featured showrunner and writer David E. Kelley (“Ally McBeal,” “Big Little Lies”). Kelley, who’s been married to Pfeiffer for more than 32 years, made a joke about how her saying yes to the role of Margo’s mother was the second best “yes” he’s gotten from her.\n\n\n\tFanning said what drew her to the role was Thorpe’s book. The character of Margo, she said, is “full of spunk, and optimism,” and “she’s doing it her way. Fanning, an Oscar nominee in the supporting actress category this year for “Sentimental Value,” said she wanted to portray Margo’s post-partum life as realistically as possible — and relied on “all the mothers on set” to keep her on track.\n\t\n\n\tTo play Jinx — who is just out of rehab and moves in with Margo, forging a relationship with his daughter for the first time — Offerman also said Thorpe’s book “scared him.” But it’s “sublime art,” and when he took the role, he wondered, “Can I live up to it?”\n\n\tKelley executive produces alongside Fanning, Dakota Fanning and Brittany Kahan Ward for Lewellen Pictures; Nicole Kidman and Per Saari of Blossom Films; and Matthew Tinker for David E. Kelley Productions. Pfeiffer, Thorpe, Eva Anderson and Boo Killebrew also executive produce alongside Dearbhla Walsh, who directs the pilot. Additional directors include Kate Herron and Alice Seabright.\n\n\t“Margo’s Got Money Troubles” is produced for Apple TV by A24. It marks the latest collaboration between the streamer and Kelley, who created the legal thriller “Presumed Innocent” based on the 1987 novel. Season 2 of “Presumed Innocent” is currently in production.\n\n\tWatch the teaser trailer for “Margo’s Got Money Troubles” below.\n\n\n\n",

Looks like we’re getting dueling docs ... Tyra’s version based on what aired on screen, and Lisa’s focused on the psychological warfare contestants say went down when the cameras weren’t rolling.

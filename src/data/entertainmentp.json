    "body": "\n\t“Black Swan” director Darren Aronofsky landed at the Red Sea Film Festival in a situation fitting to an Aronofsky film: the whole of Jeddah suddenly in a panic when rain began falling from the sky. “Thanks for coming out in the middle of this national tragedy of a rainstorm,” he jokingly told the scattered audience who managed to bypass cancelled rides and blocked entrances to get to his festival talk. “You’ve got to get better sewers!”\n\t\n\n\tThe director briefly commented on the deal taking over industry news over the last few days, Netflix agreeing to buy Warner Bros., including its film and TV studios, its gaming business, HBO Max and HBO, with Paramount recently launching a hostile takeover bid.\n\n\n\t“I have not digested it yet,” he said. “It’s such brand new news. My sense is it’s not going to be a smooth road. I caught a few headlines today. It feels like everyone’s freaking out about it. I don’t want to comment on it because I just don’t understand any of it, and it’s very easy to fall into rally points right now. The only thing I’d say is it’s always good to have more buyers. Anytime there is consolidation, it’s bad. We already only have a limited amount of buyers. When you want to make a TV show or a movie, you send it out to everyone, and you hope a few of them get hungry for it and get a bidding war of some type that gives you what you need to make a piece of art. Having one less player is always bad. That’s a bummer.”\n\n\n\tTalking to renowned American neuroscientist Heather Berlin, whose work focuses on trying to understand the neurobiological basis of creativity and emotion, the director discussed AI and new technologies at length. Earlier in the year, Aronofsky launched AI-driven production studio Primordial Soup, a venture to “empower filmmakers with AI-based creative tools” in partnership with Google DeepMind’s AI research team. As part of the program, the studio is working with filmmakers to produce short films, resulting in a creative exchange: directors get early access to generative-AI video tools while giving feedback to the tech company to help guide their tech development.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s evolving super quick,” Aronofsky said of working closely with AI. “When I first started seeing the images coming out of the models, I recognized [it] was going to have a big impact on what I do. What is coming out of the models now is content that looks super high production value, it only lasts 8 seconds, and it’s generally meaningless. But it’s attracting more and more of the world’s attention because it’s looking better and better. It’s sweeter and sweeter candy.”\n\n\tStill, the director said storytelling remains “one of our most important arts.” “When you watch a movie, you’re asked to forget about yourself and go on a journey with someone else. That’s the magic,” he said. “It’s an exercise in empathy and ultimately what makes us a better species and gives us a better chance to survive. I don’t think staring at those little clips for 10 seconds is doing much for us.”\n\n\tDespite being a staunch defender of new technologies, the “Requiem for a Dream” director said we are still “pretty far away” from being able to make films audiences will be interested in with artificial intelligence. “Very soon, it will be able to tell a story in a very basic way, but even though that’s happening, I think a human collaborator can then take that and turn it into art. I think that’s when it becomes interesting.”\n\n\t“There will be lots of people playing with it and turning it into something that’s unexpected,” he added. “And that unexpected turn is something the machines aren’t going to be able to make sense [of].”\n\n\tAsked by a young filmmaker how AI can democratize access to filmmaking itself, Aronofsky said: “If I were a filmmaker right now, I’d be in a room with five friends and five computers, figuring out what’s possible.”\n\n\t“There’s something about the golden age of movies when clearly they’re not occupying the same cultural space,” he added of the current landscape for films. “But storytelling will be around forever; it’s just taking a different form. I don’t know that the dominance of the two-hour-long movie is going to have that cultural power forever.”\n\n\t“It already feels like you get more cultural power from some of these TV shows. Arguably, ‘Squid Game’ is reaching larger audiences and affecting culture in a deeper way. Storytelling is here to stay; it’s just about figuring out how to get a story into the world and the most interesting way to make it. And the most interesting way to get around is with these tools, and they’re incredibly powerful.”\n\t\n\n\tAs for next projects, the director got asked about the rumor he might direct a film about businessman Elon Musk: “Who?” he responded jokingly. “Elon Musk? I don’t know who that is.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndian actor Kartik Aaryan didn’t fear typecasting at the start of his career, rather he welcomed it. Speaking during an “In Conversation” session at the Red Sea Film Festival, the Bollywood star said that in his early years, being narrowly defined felt preferable to not getting any roles at all. “I wanted to be typecast,” he admitted with a laugh. “I just wanted people to watch the film and love it.”\n\n\tThat frank acknowledgment set the tone for Aaryan’s first public appearance in Saudi Arabia. The conversation quickly turned to “Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2,” the blockbuster horror comedy sequel that would secure his place as one of India’s most commercially successful talents, though he initially turned it down. Aaryan recalled that he was reluctant to step into a franchise, especially since the offer came without a complete script.\n\t\n\n\tThe film’s producer, Bhushan Kumar, later persuaded him to reconsider, a decision that proved career-defining. The film’s runaway success transformed Aaryan into a pop-culture fixture, with fans now referring to him by his on-screen persona. “These films really changed my life,” he said, adding, “I think I’m really fortunate that it turned out the way which we were imagining it to be, and not the way I thought when the opportunity presented itself and I immediately reacted to it.”\n\n\tAaryan also discussed “Dhamaka,” the single-location thriller about a journalist who turns threatening calls into an opportunity for a comeback, shot during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. With theaters shuttered and no idea of when the industry would come back to life, he sought a project that could be executed quickly and safely. Aaryan recounted how the film, shot in an isolated hotel over roughly 10 days, demanded long monologues and precision. For Aaryan, the experience was a reminder of why adaptability and faith in a director’s vision remained essential.\n\t\n\n\tFrom there, Aaryan addressed the “overnight success” label that followed “Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety,” the 2018 hit he credited as his true breakthrough. The phrase, he argued, erases years of effort. “That night came after seven years,” he said, describing a long stretch of auditions, rejections, and slow progress.\n\n\tBeyond individual milestones, Aaryan framed his journey through the lens of conviction rather than luck. Asked whether he ever doubted himself early on, he said no, acknowledging that the mindset could be mistaken for overconfidence. “That belief system has worked for me,” he said, crediting passion, patience, and what he described as manifestation. “You have to be a go-getter,” he added. “You have to work towards the dream.”\n\n\tAaryan repeatedly described himself as “a proud outsider” — someone whose career was not shaped by family or personal connections. “I’m proud to be that outsider who carved his own audience,” he said, pointing to the increasingly global nature of Indian cinema and the role festivals like Red Sea play in expanding that reach.\n\n\tNow firmly established as a commercial lead in Bollywood, Aaryan said his choices begin with the script, which he calls “the most important pillar of any film,” followed closely by trust in the director. Whether discussing mainstream entries like “Luka Chuppi,” a romcom in which a couple pretends to be married in order to live together, or more experimental projects still in development, he emphasized the challenge of balancing accessibility with emotional depth. Even in blockbuster cinema, he argued, gravitas matters.\n\n\tAaryan closed the conversation by pushing back on the idea of legacy altogether. “This script isn’t completed yet,” he said. “It’s still being written.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBFI Distribution has acquired U.K.-Ireland theatrical rights to Imran Perretta’s debut “Ish,” which premiered earlier this year in Venice’s Critics’ Week, where it won the Audience Award, before going on to compete for the Sutherland Award at the BFI London Film Festival. Dhiraj Mahey won the breakthrough producer prize for the film at the British Independent Film Awards.\n\n\tThe distributor is scheduling a release for next year. Global Constellation handles worldwide sales, and brokered the deal on behalf of the filmmakers.\n\t\n\n\t“Ish” follows 12-year-old best friends Ish and Maram, who wrestle to hold onto their friendship in the wake of a police stop and search. As the ripples take hold, the boys try to make sense of the men they are becoming – and how “letting go” can be the hardest part of growing up.\n\n\n\tThe Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw described the film as “a compassionate, poignant and poetic urban pastoral about young masculinity, in which racial profiling pushes teen friends apart.”\n\n\tLaura Dos Santos, BFI Distribution’s head of acquisitions, said: “It is an impressive achievement for Imran Perretta to have directed, penned and scored ‘Ish’ – his gorgeously immersive, empathetic feature debut. The film also showcases the brilliance of many other British and Irish talent such as cinematographer Jermaine Canute Edwards, co-writer Enda Walsh and the electrifying leading duo of non-professional local actors Farhan Hasnat and Yahya Kitana. The Audience Award won in Venice shows its potential to connect with people, and we cannot wait to present it to audiences in its home territory.”\n\t\n\n\tCo-written by Perretta and Enda Walsh (“Hunger”), “Ish” is produced by Primal Pictures’ Mahey (“The Ghoul,” which was BAFTA nominated in 2018 for Outstanding Debut by British Writer, Director or Producer) and Bennett McGhee (“Mogul Mowgli,” which was BAFTA nominated in 2021 for Outstanding British Film, and “Brooklyn”), in association with Good Chaos’ Mike Goodridge (“Triangle of Sadness,” “Santosh”) and Home Team. \n\n\tThe film is financed by BBC Film and the BFI, awarding National Lottery funding, with additional support provided by U.K.-based media financier Calculus Media, and Dorian Grinspan’s Out of Order. Executive producers are Claudia Yusef for BBC Film, Ama Ampadu for the BFI, Goodridge and Yoav Rosenberg for Good Chaos, John Glencross and Mariyah Dosani for Calculus Media, and Dorian Grinspan and Eric Kuhn (“Grand Theft Hamlet”) for Out of Order. Kuhn is also an exec producer. \n\n\tPerretta, a London-based writer, director, composer and visual artist, achieved critical acclaim in the world of contemporary art, receiving the prestigious Turner Prize bursary in 2020 for his work “The Destructors,” which has been shown in major institutions in the U.K. and internationally.\n\n\tPerretta walks in the footsteps of other notable British film directors who have transitioned from the world of contemporary art to filmmaking, including Clio Barnard and Steve McQueen, to name but two, often pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling.\n\n\tThe film stars young newcomers Farhan Hasnat and Yahya Kitana in the leads, with cinematography by Jermaine Canute Edwards (“My Father’s Shadow”), editing by Adam Biskupski (“Mogul Mowgli”), score by Perretta and sound design by Jens Rosenlund Petersen and Nina Hartstone (“Bohemian Rhapsody,” “Saltburn”), who also received a nomination at the 2025 BIFA Awards for their work on “Ish” for Best Sound.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile Jimmy Kimmel noted his contract extension with Disney during Monday night’s broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” he also jabbed at President Donald Trump for the job he did as host of Sunday’s Kennedy Center Honors.\n\n\tAt a Saturday event related to the Kennedy Center Honors, Trump singled out Kimmel as a “horrible” TV host. Kimmel responded on Monday’s monologue with his own critique. \n\n\n\t“I thought we were friends. I’m starting to think he’s got a crush on me,” Kimmel joked, pointing out Trump’s weekend activities at the Kennedy Center Honors and the FIFA World Cup 2026 Draw, also held in D.C.\n\t\n\n\t“He’s been boasting about hosting, saying, ‘We’ve never had a president host the Kennedy Center Honors before,’ which, yeah, why do you think that is?” Kimmel asked during his monologue. “We’ve also never had Neil Patrick Harris order a military strike on a fishing boat before.”\n\n\tLater in his monologue, Kimmel told the crowd he has renewed his deal to host “Jimmy Kimmel Live” through May 2027, “or until the world ends, whichever comes first,” as he told the crowd at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood.\n\n\t“I was giving a lot of thought and decided I would like to spend less time with my family, and so to our audience here and at home – I’m honored and humbled to be a part of your routine. Whether it’s in bed at night, or …during your morning toilet time,” Kimmel said. “It means a lot to me to have your attention – and to work with this great group of people for another year.”\n\n\tKimmel renewed his deal with Disney early Monday and will remain the host of ABC‘s late-night program through 2027. His current deal was expected to expire in 2026.\n\t\n\n\tKimmel confirmed the renewal in an Instagram post Monday afternoon, writing, “I am pleased to announce another no-talent year!” The phrase “no-talent” is a favorite of Trump’s when lashing out at late-night hosts who criticize him on air.\n\n\tKimmel’s relationship with Trump is tumultuous to say the least. The president habitually attacks Kimmel on Truth Social, often after the late-night host takes a swipe at him on air. In November, Kimmel said during a Tuesday night broadcast that Trump “loses his mind” every time a reporter asks about his connection to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The following night, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “Why does ABC Fake News keep Jimmy Kimmel, a man with NO TALENT and VERY POOR TELEVISION RATINGS, on the air?”\n\n\tKimmel’s relationship with ABC hasn’t been the smoothest either. In September, the network pulled “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” off the air for several days after Nexstar and Sinclair, two of the nation’s largest TV station owners, complained about the host’s on-air comments about Charlie Kirk, a young conservative activist who was assassinated.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Baahubali” star Tamannaah Bhatia has been cast as actor Jayashree in the upcoming Indian biographical drama “V. Shantaram,” joining Siddhant Chaturvedi in the epic chronicle of the pioneering Indian filmmaker’s life and legacy.\n\n\tThe makers unveiled a first-look poster of Bhatia as Jayashree, the accomplished actor known for her work in films including “Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani,” “Shakuntala,” “Chandra Rao More” and “Dahej.” Jayashree was also V. Shantaram’s second wife and a key figure in his cinematic journey.\n\t\n\n\tThe poster showcases Bhatia draped in a pink Nauvari saree, evoking the vintage era of Indian cinema. The casting follows the recent unveiling of Chaturvedi in the title role of the biographical drama tracing Shantaram’s journey from the silent era through his emergence as one of India’s most influential auteurs.\n\n\n\t“It’s a great responsibility to portray a character rooted in one of the most influential eras of our cinema. And I feel immensely honored to bring to life Jayashree, as she has been part of such legendary projects and the amount of grace she had was surreal,” Bhatia said. “Shantaram built a legacy that continues to shape generations, and decoding his universe has allowed me to witness the brilliance of the man behind the legend. Bringing a piece of that legacy to the screen is truly a special feeling, and I am thankful for the makers of ‘V. Shantaram’ to see me as Jayashree.”\n\n\tV. Shantaram, born Shantaram Rajaram Vankudre in 1901, was a pioneering force in Indian cinema whose career spanned nearly seven decades. He founded two major film studios — Prabhat Film Company in 1929 and Rajkamal Kalamandir in 1942 — and directed the first Marathi-language talkie, “Ayodhyecha Raja,” in 1932. His films, including classics like “Duniya Na Mane” (1937), “Do Aankhen Barah Haath” (1957), “Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje” (1955) and “Navrang” (1959) were celebrated for their technical innovations and progressive social themes addressing issues like communal harmony, dowry, and prisoner rehabilitation. Known for his signature style of lavish sets, unique song picturizations, and visual symbolism — he used cinema as an instrument for social change throughout his career. He received India’s highest film honor, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, in 1985.\n\t\n\n\tWritten and directed by Abhijeet Shirish Deshpande, “V. Shantaram” is presented by Rajkamal Enterttainment, Camera Take Films and Roaring Rivers Productions. Rahul Kiran Shantaram, Subhash Kale and Sarita Ashwin Varde serve as producers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron revealed in an interview with Discussing Film that he received pushback from the studio when he decided to expand the number of “Avatar” sequels from three films to four. After the record-breaking success of the original “Avatar” in 2009, Cameron assembled a writer’s room to begin developing the continuation of a story across three sequels.\n\n\t“We were working on three scripts and then it turned into four. Two got split into two and three,” Cameron said about his decision to split what was the original script for “Avatar: The Way of Water” into both “The Way of Water” and a new third movie, “Fire and Ash.” The decision meant that what was planned to be the third “Avatar” movie would now be the fourth, bringing the total number of films in the franchise to five.\n\t\n\n\t“I actually got a fair bit of pushback from the studio,” Cameron said. “My counterargument was, ‘Wait a minute. What part of you getting another chance to make $2 billion is in question here?'”\n\n\n\tThe original “Avatar” remains the highest-grossing movie in history (unadjusted for inflation) with $2.9 billion. Cameron knew what he was talking about with his counterargument to the studio as 2022’s “The Way of Water” grossed $2.3 billion to become the third highest-grosser in history. Now the pressure is on for “Fire and Ash” to cross the $2 billion mark at the worldwide box office later this month.\n\n\tCameron previously revealed that he’s already shot footage for “Avatar 4,” but going back to finish the next sequel and continue into “Avatar 5” will all depend on the success of “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Speaking to Collider in 2022, the filmmaker revealed that the “Avatar 4” script was the first “Avatar” sequel not to receive a single note from studio executives.\n\t\n\n\t“I can’t tell you the details, but all I can say is that when I turned in the script for [‘The Way of Water’], the studio gave me three pages of notes,” Cameron said. “And when I turned in the script for 3, they gave me a page of notes, so I was getting better. When I turned in the script for 4, the studio executive, the creative executive over the films, wrote me an email that said, ‘Holy fuck.’ And I said, ‘Well, where are the notes?’ And she said, ‘Those are the notes.’ Because it kind of goes nuts in a good way, right?”\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” opens in theaters Dec. 19.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn this week’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart called out Donald Trump for accepting FIFA’s inaugural Peace Prize while simultaneously escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela.\n\n\tAt the top of Monday’s show, Stewart turned his attention to last Friday’s FIFA World Cup draw, during which the groups for the initial phase of the global soccer tournament were revealed. But, as noted by the late-night pundit, the big question of the night wasn’t “who would be in this year’s group of death or how FIFA would find a way to fuck over Scotland,” but rather “who would win FIFA’s first Peace Prize?”\n\t\n\n\t“Because when I think of one sport that fosters peaceful coexistence, it’s the beautiful game,” Stewart joked. “All right, here we go! Who’s it going to be?”\n\n\n\tStewart then cut to the World Cup draw, where FIFA president Gianni Infantino announced Trump as the first-ever recipient of the Peace Prize.\n\n\t“Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!” Stewart facetiously exclaimed. “He won the prize specifically created to appease him! The FIFA appease-prize!”\n\n\tLater in the show, Stewart added, “The craziest part wasn’t necessarily Donald Trump being awarded an entirely fictitious golden butt plug. It was the cognitive dissonance of flipping over to the news channels, post-peace ceremony.”\n\n\tStewart then cut to a series of news clips claiming that America is “on the brink of war with Venezuela,” and that Trump is “ramping up the pressure” on the nation’s leader, Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\t“The brink of war? President Trump, did this meaningless award mean nothing to you?” Stewart said. “By the way, if you think they’re not serious about Venezuela, they seem to be setting a pretty nice table.”\n\t\n\n\tMore soundbites followed, explaining that the Pentagon is “surging battleships towards the coast of Venezuela,” and that the campaign amounts to “the largest U.S. show of force in the Caribbean in decades.”\n\n\t“Not including, of course, your friend Stephanie’s destination bachelorette party. That is the largest show of force,” Stewart joked.\n\n\tWatch the entire monologue below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tT-Series and JP Films have unveiled the first look of Ahan Shetty from “Border 2,” expanding the war film’s scope to include the Indian Navy alongside the Army and Air Force.\n\n\tThe poster depicts Shetty as a Navy officer in combat, with blood streaked across his face and a military weapon in hand. The reveal follows earlier character posters for Sunny Deol, Varun Dhawan and Diljit Dosanjh, the latter portraying an Indian Air Force officer.\n\t\n\n\tShetty, the son of actor Suniel Shetty, made his acting debut with the action romance film “Tadap” (2021), for which he won the IIFA Award for Star Debut of the Year – Male. “Border 2” marks his second major film role. Next up for Shetty is a horror feature. \n\n\n\tSet in 1971, the original “Border” (1997) was headlined by Deol, and took place along the border region of Longewala, where a small battalion of Indian soldiers fought a large Pakistani strike force. It is considered a landmark Indian war film.\n\n\t“Border 2” is directed by Anurag Singh who previously helmed Akshay Kumar-starring “Kesari” (2019), based on the Battle of Saragarhi in which an army of 21 Sikhs fought against 10,000 Afghans in 1897.The cast includes Deol, Dhawan, Dosanjh, Shetty, Medha Rana, Mona Singh and Sonam Bajwa. The production is backed by Bhushan Kumar, JP Dutta and Nidhi Dutta under the T-Series and JP Films banners.\n\n\tPresented by Gulshan Kumar and T-Series in association with J.P. Dutta’s J.P.

    "body": "\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWelcome to Variety Awards HQ! Your weekly command center for the Oscars race.\n\n\tIt’s Dec. 8, 2025, and we’re deep in the thick of it. The past seven days have been a whirlwind of major awards season benchmarks, and if anyone thought this year’s race would follow a predictable script, they were proven wrong.\n\n\n\tThe Golden Globe nominations dropped Monday, marking a notably international and genre-diverse field, with Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” leading all films with nine nominations. Other top contenders included “Sentimental Value,” “Sinners,” “Marty Supreme” and “The Secret Agent,” while films like “Jay Kelly” and “Wicked: For Good” fell short in best picture (comedy), despite multiple nods.\n\t\n\n\tJust days prior, the Critics Choice Awards nominations added fuel to the fire, helping clarify which films are gaining real momentum. “Bugonia” snagged a surprise best picture nom, in addition to its star Emma Stone. At the same time, there were strong showings with acting nominations for Jacob Elordi (“Frankenstein”) and Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”) signaled real heat behind the performances.\n\n\n\tThen came the Los Angeles Film Critics Association on Sunday night, throwing a few calculated curveballs. Ethan Hawke picked up leading performance for “Blue Moon” alongside Rose Byrne’s work in “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” which brings her three of the “Big Four” critics awards, with the National Society of Film Critics still to come in January.\n\n\tThis week also brought major events across the circuit, from studio FYC screenings and Q&As to the early guild buzz already beginning to percolate. It’s been a week that sharpened the picture, and in some cases, rewrote it entirely.\n\t\n\n\tAs always, each week, we’ll deliver sharp analysis, exclusive interviews with key contenders (both above and below the line), and inside reads on the behind-the-scenes shifts affecting the race.\n\n\tWe’re always looking to spotlight unique angles, rising talent, and sharp on-the-ground reporting. Email me at cdavis@variety.com for submissions and coverage consideration.\n\n\tCatch up on the week’s top five events below.\n\t\n\t\tInside the NYC ‘Sinners’ Luncheon: A Starry Celebration In Soho\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn Dec. 2, Warner Bros. hosted an intimate luncheon at Manuela in Soho to celebrate Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners,” one of the season’s most closely watched awards contenders.\n\n\tThe event brought together an eclectic and powerful mix of filmmakers, actors, producers, and tastemakers for a day of conversation, connection and celebration of the film’s rising momentum.\n\n\tHosted just days before Golden Globe and Critics Choice nominations were announced, the luncheon functioned as both a quiet flex and a strategic push, reminding voters and influencers alike of the film’s cultural impact and deep creative bench.\n\n\tAmong the attendees were writer and director Ryan Coogler, star Michael B. Jordan, and co-star Delroy Lindo. Also present at the event were: Gayle King, Laverne Cox, Phylicia Rashad, Shaka King, Julie Dash, Elegance Bratton, and Barbara Broccoli.\n\n\tOther notable guests included Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy, Todd Komarnicki, Stella Meghie, Omar Benson Miller, Marsha Stephanie Blake, and comedian Hannibal Buress.\n\n\tThe room also included several award-winning filmmakers and Academy members such as Dee Rees, J.C. Chandor, and Lisa Cortés, as well as casting director Francine Maisler and composer Jon Batiste.\n\t\n\t\tReba McEntire Hosts Starry ‘Song Sung Blue’ Event at DGA\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHugh Jackman, Reba McEntire, Kate Hudson and Craig Brewer seen at a special screening of ‘Song Sung Blue’ \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFocus Features via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn Dec. 7, Focus Features teamed up with country music icon Reba McEntire to host a special screening of “Song Sung Blue” at the Directors Guild of America in Los Angeles.\n\n\tThe event was part of the ongoing awards push for Craig Brewer’s musical drama, which has been building strong word of mouth the past few weeks.\n\n\tThe evening drew a packed house of Academy members, DGA voters, and industry insiders, with representation from major agencies including WME. Following the screening, McEntire introduced a lively and heartfelt Q&A featuring director/writer/producer Craig Brewer alongside stars Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson.\n\n\t“Song Sung Blue” has been quietly emerging as one of the season’s sleeper contenders, particularly for Hudson, whose performance has been singled out in recent screenings, and just garnered a Golden Globe nom for best actress (comedy).\n\t\n\t\tCharlize Theron Joins Baz Luhrmann for ‘Wicked: For Good’ Celebration in L.A.\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMiranda McDonald\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn Dec. 2, Baz Luhrmann hosted a special celebration for Universal Pictures’ “Wicked: For Good,” featuring a live performance and reception in Los Angeles. The event, part of the studio’s ongoing awards season campaign, highlighted the film’s original music and showcased its ensemble cast. Among the notable attendees was Charlize Theron, adding star power to the evening. The celebration drew industry voters, guild members, and creatives for a night honoring the musical’s achievements. As “Wicked: For Good” builds momentum this season, the Luhrmann-led event served as a stylish reminder of the film’s artistic and cultural impact.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDocumentary Oscar Hopeful ‘Predators’ Gains Awards Momentum\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter premiering at Sundance 2025 to widespread acclaim, “Predators” has steadily emerged as one of the year’s top documentary contenders. Directed by David Osit and distributed by MTV Documentary Films, whose recent Oscar track record includes “Ascension,” “The Eternal Memory,” and “Black Box Diaries,” the film has built momentum through the fall season.\n\n\tCurrently boasting a 98% Certified Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, “Predators” has resonated with critics and audiences alike across its theatrical run in over 35 markets.\n\n\tWith support building from both critics and the documentary branch, “Predators” is positioning itself as a dark horse contender in a competitive nonfiction field this awards season.\n\t\n\t\t‘Sentimental Value’ Ramps Up Awards Season Presence With Tastemaker Events in L.A. and NYC\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStephanie Augello\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJoachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” continued to solidify its status as a major awards season contender with a series of high-profile screenings and Q&As this past week, drawing enthusiastic support from voters according to sources and attendees.\n\n\tOn Dec. 1, the Directors Guild of America hosted a packed screening followed by a thoughtful conversation between Trier and editor Olivier Bugge Coutté, moderated by Judd Apatow.\n\n\tThe campaign continued in New York on Dec. 3, where the “Sentimental Value” team held a tastemaker screening at iPic Fulton for Academy members. Trier was joined by stars Stellan Skarsgård, Renate Reinsve and Elle Fanning. Academy Award winner Sofia Coppola (“Lost in Translation”) introduced the screening, adding an extra layer of prestige and support.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFascism has arrived and settled into Los Angeles. And before you say “Tell us something we don’t already know,” this refers to the opening on this coast of “Here Lies Love,” the David Byrne-created musical about the Philippines’ dictatorial First Lady, Imelda Marcos, now getting its L.A. premiere at the Mark Taper Forum. A whole different set of audiences is being posed with the musical question: Do disco balls and martial law mix?\n\n\tDuring the show’s 2023 Broadway run, SRO audiences were encouraged to dance in place and ponder despots at the same time — a greater disassotiative challenge than walking and chewing gum at the same time, but hardly an insurmountable one. For this engagement (just opened, and newly extended through April 6), the audience remains seated, since ripping seats out for ironic boogieing was a bridge too far for a Music Center venue. The good news: “Here Lies Love” remains one of the most intriguing and rewarding “rock musicals” ever to emerge from the brain of a major pop figure. And that’s with or without the innovative staging that caused New York theatergoers to have to use their brains to figure out which way to move as ushers literally directed traffic on a constantly shifting dance floor.\n\t\n\n\tByrne admits that he never foresaw the musical being produced without the constant audience participation that has been a part of all previous productions. But he’s not objecting to it being done as more of a traditional proscenium musical in L.A., mind you… just wondering if the impact will be the same.\n\n\n\t“I’m very curious how the non-immersive staging will work,” Byrne tells Variety, in an email interview about the Taper production. He’s busy overseas with his acclaimed “Who Is the Sky?” tour — a traveling show that has its own revolutionary sense of invention — so he will have to get reports on how well this version has weathered a less radicalized treatment. “The immersive disco setting put the audience in the position of the Philippine people, and that worked,” he says, “so I’m curious if that connection will still happen.”\n\t\n\n\tInitial audience and critic responses have been highly favorable, including among those who have some experience of previous presentations, which stretch back to an initial off-Broadway run at New York’s Public in 2013. The direction of this version has been undertaken by the man who directs the Center Theatre Group as an institution: CTG artistic director Snehal Desai. He’s wanted to direct “Here Lies Love” since he saw it at the Public 13 years ago. And once he took the reins of the Music Center venues, he came to believe that the Mark Taper Forum was immersive enough. It does have the western United States’ most famous thrust stage, after all, so the line between audience and actors is more thinly drawn even on a normal night out in the up-close-and-personal, 739-seat space.\n\n\tSays Desai, “When I saw the show in 2013 at the Public, I was just so taken with it — taken with the experience of it, but also just the storytelling and the sung-through format. You’re there for this kind of disco party celebration where you’re kind of like, ‘Well, I know this isn’t a good person. What am I doing?’ The complicity [with Imelda and Ferdinand Marcos] is happening, and then the rug is pulled out, and suddenly, what was a kind of a party turns into almost a rally. I viscerally remember that experience.\n\n\t“When I saw it at the Public, everyone was standing,” the director notes. “But then when it went to Broadway, I experienced it from the seats.” (The balcony of the Broadway Theatre remained intact, and a few elevated mezzanine rows were constructed on either side of the so-called dance floor.) “And I was like, ‘Oh, the storytelling still works.’ \n\n\t“The thing about the Taper is, it doesn’t have that fourth-wall separation. We’re all in the same room. When someone gets up to go to the bathroom, everyone notices everything! So I was like, I think we can tell the story in this space, and we don’t have to rip out the seats, but we can activate the entire Taper. We can have different areas [amid the audience] where we stage things, and then we can still have moments where we invite folks to stand up and join with us, or maybe have a few members  come on stage so that it can lend itself to the experience. But it doesn’t have to be fully immersive in the way that it was at the Public. Because both times I watched it, I thought, ‘This whole element of it is fun, it’s intriguing, but there’s no reason this couldn’t be staged traditionally, either.'”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAura Mayari and the company of HERE LIES LOVE at the Mark Taper Forum. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJeff Lorch\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWith everyone seated on a rake, Desai didn’t think it still made sense to pretend the night is starting out inside an actual 1970s disco, as in New York. Changing that opening locale offered a chance to do something even more specifically Filipino, he thought, after consulting with the mostly AAPI creative team. “We knew we’re not gonna make it so everyone’s moving around the whole time. But how can we make it a space particularly that, particularly to the Filipino community, is a world they recognize. That’s where my scenic designer said, ‘You know, the show lends itself to these noontime variety shows that they have in the Philippines. There are these long-running shows that are oftentimes multi hours, with a variety-show feel, and there’s a host who’s holding everything together.’ And I thought, ‘That might be it. We can be a noontime variety show format.’ Then the audience is a studio audience,  invited still to interact like a studio audience is, but we’re not fully in a club disco world the whole time.”\n\n\tThat entailed the Taper’s dramaturg writing up one new character not in previous productions, the drag-queen TV host, Imeldific (Aura Mayari, of Season 15 of “RuPaul’s Drag Race”), who provides a bit of spoken scene-setting near the beginning to help familiarize the audience with the milieu, in a musical that is for all intents and purposes sung-through. (Projections with names, dates and pertinent historical details also help provide context that the songs alone can’t.) But the new emcee doesn’t substantially change the show, and it doesn’t stay in either a disco or a TV studio for long. Desai points out what a logistical challenge “Here Lies Love” is to design and direct, in any setting: “It’s a crazy show. There’s 31 songs and there’s 30 transitions” — all in a very fast-moving hour and a half, with no intermission.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChris Renfro, Reanne Acasio, and the company of HERE LIES LOVE at the Mark Taper Forum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJeff Lorch\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGiven all those possible speed bumps — from having to establish core historical facts while crooning is occurring, to rapid-fire scene and costume changes that often seem to be happening even faster than the b.p.m. pace set up by Byrne’s and Fatboy Slim’s busy score — the Taper production has not only met most of the standards of previous productions but established some new ones. The dancing on stage is more vigorous and exciting than ever, as if William Carlos Angulo, the choreographer, felt that he had to make up for the lack of participatory audience dancing (or shuffling) by making what the cast is doing that much more vivacious. David Byrne fans make up one natural audience for the show, and Filipinos another. But if anyone who doesn’t give a whoop about Talking Heads or the Phillipines comes in wanting the traditional virtues of costume and dance — and maybe some head-turning whiplash as the action moves around the audience — this “Here Lies Love” has the effect of offering show-biz enchantments even for those less intrigued by its exotic aspects.\n\t\n\n\tBut, with apologies to Tracy Chapman, we are talkin’ about a revolution. So how is the show’s political relevance holding up in 2026? \n\n\tTalk about a loaded question: Even if you’ve followed the course of the show back not just to its first staging but to Byrne’s original 2010 concept double-album, there will be plenty of moments in this production of “Here Lies Love” where you may have to defy your instinctual feeling that this was written in the last few years as an allegory.\n\n\tSays Byrne, “I’m aware there’s a huge Filipino community in L.A .and around, so the show should resonate for them — it’s their history. Some may look on the People Power revolution as a positive example for the world (I do), while others will be Marcos loyalists (guess who is back in power!).” That last remark refers to Bongbong Marcus, son of the late Imelda and Ferdinand, who now leads the country, not so many decades after his parents were forcefully driven out of it. \n\n\tByrne continues, “I hope non-Filipinos will see some parallels in the show — how populist leaders can actually sometimes deliver on their promises — but there is the danger of seducing the public and holding on to power too long.\n\n\t“The story has sadly remained relevant beyond the Philippines,” Byrne adds. “Without giving too much away, the peaceful People Power revolution that ousted a corrupt dictator and his wife is hugely encouraging — it has been done before and can be done again.” And he leaves the obvious contemporary parallels as that, for now.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJeffLorenz Garrido, Joshua Dela Cruz, and Garrick Goce Macatangay in HERE LIES LOVE at the Mark Taper Forum. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJeff Lorch\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDesai is more explicit about the reverberations this has for any audience in the present day — which are  likely to be received with appreciative nods in L.A. If the show were being staged somewhere deep in MAGA country, it might start to become as uncomfortable for them as it is for Claudius in “Hamlet” when he just sits down to watch a nice play… even if its take on the Marcoses was all conceived during the Obama years.\n\n\tDesai was in rehearsals when we first spoke with him last month. “As we’re rehearsing right now, there is a big march happening here in downtown L.A.,” he said. “And literally every day as we work on this show, what we’re seeing in this country is kind of the fascist dictators’ playbook, right? Don Lemon just got arrested. It’s press that they’re really going after today. Yesterday was about the censorship that’s coming out with TikTok now changing ownership. A few days before, it was the front lines in Minneapolis. The people who have been leading the fight are the clergy, and even the Pope has spoken out. So a lot of the things that are happening are running very parallel to what happened in the Philippines during the Marcos regime. And we know that  this wanting to enact censorship and martial law in this country is something that this president wants. \n\t\n\n\t“So what I loved about this musical is, I felt that I went on a journey and experience, but I left reminded that I can empower myself and we can all empower ourselves by coming together, by rallying together. And you know, I didn’t think when we planned this a year ago exactly how far we would be in terms of the moment of what’s happening nationally.”\n\n\tOne sensitivity any time “Here Lies Love” has been produced has been to the sensibilities of parts of the Filipino community that may suspect the show is a glorification of the Marcoses (although, as Byrne said, a few might welcome that), given how few musicals have ultimately unsympathetic characters in the leads. In the Taper production, you can feel Imelda being given some sharp and brittle edges earlier into her girlhood scenes than she was on Broadway, where she was a little more mistakable for a Disney princess in her opening reading of the title song, before she increasingly breaks bad. A lot of community outreach was done in New York to make sure that most in the Filipino community who were engaged “got” it, and were able to take pride in a show with an all-Filipino cast and primarily Filipino behind-the-scenes team, even if the Marcoses hardly prompt pride.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSnehal Desai \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I think the story is the start of the conversation, right?” says the director. “We have worked really hard, particularly in the second act, to make sure this is not meant to glamorize anyone. And if anything, the folks who have the arc of the journey, who have the change, are the community that leads to the People Power revolution. So Imelda, Marcos and Aquino (a more heroic figure in the action), they don’t have full redemptive arcs like traditional musical characters, which is something David and I talked a lot about. But someone needs to, so that it’s a fulfilling experience.” It’s an interesting conceit: Although the show has some secondary characters to root for, the real hero and protagonist is the long-suffering, eventually triumphant chorus line, as it were — a chorale that gets the last word in the show, when the neo-disco rhythms give way to a beautiful power-to-the-people folk song.\n\n\t“L.A. is the home to the largest Filipino community outside of the Philippines,” points out Desai, who himself has Indian heritage. “As an artistic producer, this is I think the fifth project I’ve worked on that is a Filipino story. There is an amazing community, but then Filipino artists,  it’s like they grow up eating and drinking musical theater as well as karaoke and stuff like that, and they’re just such great performers. So this was one of the easiest casting processes —  easy in that I had many, many options of who we could cast for this show. I wasn’t like, ‘Oh my God, where’s my Imelda?’ I could have cast the show so many times over.” \n\t\n\n\tThere are a few people in the cast with previous “Here Lies Love” experience: “Joan Almedilla, who’s our Aurora, was actually one of the first performers that David called when, after the concept album came out, she performed in the Carnegie Hall concerts they did. Then as Imelda we have Reanne Acasio, who was on Broadway playing Aurora and then was the Imelda understudy. We have  Carol Angeli, who plays Estrella, and then Joshua Dela Cruz (as Aquino), who was involved when the show was at Williamstown. So we have artists who are involved with the show in all different gestations of its life. And then the rest of the company is L.A. actors who are just phenomenal voices…\n\n\t“The design team is predominantly Filipino. Our music director is Filipino. Our dramaturg is. The process was made to make sure that we incorporated as many voices as possible, including so many folks who had their own personal experiences of experiencing martial law or knowing family members who were impacted… And you’ll hear a lot more Tagalog in the storytelling. There’s some traditional Filipino folk dancing that makes an appearance, some tinkering with things like that. I wanted it to feel like an environment that the community would recognize and see themselves reflected in. And the costumes do that a lot, too.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tReanne Acasio and the company of HERE LIES LOVE at the Mark Taper Forum. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJeff Lorch\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOther tinkering involved adding a bit of music not heard in the Broadway version. “One of the things that was part of the show, but we’re now bringing back as a refrain or reprise, is ‘American Troglodyte,’ which is the song that opens the show. As the opening song, it’s really rousing. But you’re like, ‘Wait, what are you saying? I’m a little uncomfortable.’ And you see that song and that phrase kind of go on its own journey, when it’s first a part of a big disco number and the second time when it’s just sung a cappella directly to you. And then there are two songs that weren’t in there, brought in from David’s concept album. ‘Never So Big’ is a song with Estrella, who is Imelda’s nanny and housekeeper but also confidante, whom Imelda ultimately turns her back on. We wanted to make sure that that throughline was there, because the whole show was created as a song cycle between those two women, originally. And the other added song is ‘Whole Man,’ which comes in at the end. I wanted a moment where you saw a little bit of Imelda unraveling, but no one really questioning it, and then I also wanted a second just to show Aquino sitting in a jail cell for seven years while she’s out in the world philosophizing about love and beauty.\n\t\n\n\t“With this show, you’re kind of like shot out of a cannon, especially if you’re new to the story. It doesn’t stop. And so it was a little bit of, like, where can we put in some of these moments where we can just give everyone a second to reflect and breathe, and also have these characters on stage have a moment for us to have connection or stillness, before we get into the next chapter of things.”\n\n\tByrne, for his part, is happy to see this production happening, even if he probably won’t get to see it. “Sadly I won’t be around for the opening; my tour dates were already set and tickets on sale.” But, he says, “Selfishly, yes, if this works, I’m sure other theaters will be watching and will want to pick it up. The music and the karaoke-style vocals are not typical for Broadway-style musicals, so that could be a plus for some demographics as well. A key ingredient is the sound: it should really sound like a club, plenty of low end and groove, which is also atypical for Broadway.”\n\n\tHe didn’t give up on the show finding a wider in the audience in the 13 years between concept album and Broadway, and he’s not seeing an end in sight for it now. “I believe it has plenty of life left,” Byrne says. “Look at all the pop artists who have done disco and dance music records in the last few years! And the story, as you say, is maybe more close to home and relevant than ever.”\n\n\t“Here Lies Love” runs at the Mark Taper Forum through April 5. Tickets can be found at centertheatregroup.org.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTed Sarandos is not amused and he’s not sitting quietly.\n\n\tThe Netflix co-CEO is vigorously making his case on why Netflix should be the ultimate owner of Warner Bros. Discovery. Sarandos has been speaking out forcefully even as the board of WBD went back into negotiations with Paramount Skydance this week.\n\n\tIn Sarandos’ view, the seven-day window for Paramount to impress the WBD with a better offer than the $83 billion one it has with Netflix is a minor hurdle to the end game. He’s not shy about calling out what he sees as “misinformation” spread by the Paramount Skydance team and its leader, CEO David Ellison.“It’s probably cheaper to make noise than it is to raise your bid,” Sarandos says in an interview at Netflix headquarters in Hollywood.\n\t\n\n\tSarandos is still playing his strategic cards close to the vest when it comes to discussing what a post-merger Netflix-WB-HBO would look like. But he offers some glimpses of his vision for how the enlarged company would run. He talks about competing with YouTube and how he felt after losing to them in the hunt for the Academy Awards TV rights pact. And of course, Sarandos revisits his “blood oath” regarding preserving the 45-day theatrical exhibition window. He also commits to maintaining the existing paid download home entertainment window – which means no streaming on Netflix or HBO on Day 46.\n\n\n\tTed, you’ve been living this now for many months. And certainly, you know, when the cap gun went off on December fifth, I’m guessing you didn’t think that we would be sitting here on Feb. 20 still talking about the wrangling over whether or not you and Warner Bros. will consummate this deal?\n\t\n\n\tYeah, over a deal that we have signed and endorsed by the board unanimously and is getting ready to go for shareholder approval. So it’s a remarkable amount of noise from Paramount around this since we announced that we agreed to sign our deal. I guess it’s probably cheaper to make noise than it is to raise your bid. So at every step of this process, I’ve been super-impressed with Warner Bros. Discovery’s directness and clarity about what the bid process would be and what you had to cover to do it and when you had to do it. And what’s the deadline and what state those bids would have to take? And shocked that of all the people had complained about the process, Warner Bros. Discovery had shared that there were multiple bidders as they shared in their filings, Paramount had missed every deadline — they’re bidding for assets that weren’t for sale. There was all this lack of clarity about what they were even offering. That’s the reason why we’re having this seven-day window that we granted them, was to bring some clarity to the shareholders of Warner Bros. Discovery. So they knew what our deal was, and they knew what these other deals were because they were so noisy on that side. Our deal is super-simple — $27.75 cents a share plus the value of Discovery Global. All the other things what what Paramount is and isn’t doing are completely not clear. Not clear to shareholders, not clear to us. Not clear to Warner Brothers Discovery. So we said, look, take this seven days to try to get some clarity about what they’re saying.\n\n\tI’ve got to believe that there was a candid assessment of that this takes away a point that somebody could raise in a shareholder lawsuit down the road. Was that part of the calculation?\n\n\tThat’s what I mean about complete certainty and clarity. Let’s say we didn’t turn over one last stone, which is say, will you please clarify what this is? \n\n\tWas it a debate among the Netflix board or the committee that is adjudicating all of this? Was it a vigorous debate to do the waiver?\n\n\tI think it was a sign of confidence and everyone agreed with that. And also it was an opportunity for clarity, which everybody saw the value in. I didn’t want a black cloud over the decision.\n\n\tWhen did Warner Bros. come to you and say, would you consider this? Was it weeks ago? Was it days ago? How long did Netflix folks consider whether to grant this?\n\t\n\n\tJust a day or two? I don’t feel like it was a controversial thing. I know it’s an unusual thing in the bidding process, but the other thing we got in exchange for it was we set a date for the shareholder meeting. We’d bring this thing to a head.\n\n\tHad there been hurdles to that process before this latest round of negotiations happened?\n\n\tThis process could have gone on until the end of the regulatory process for months and months and months. So, yeah, this at least brings this piece of it, which is getting the shareholders say off the table so we can keep moving forward on the regulatory process.\n\n\tJust looking at the chess of this all, obviously the world is waiting to see if Paramount Skydance raises its bid. You could also change the stakes if you threw another dollar on the table. Has that at all been a consideration?\n\n\tThe next move is up to somebody else. We have a signed deal with Warner Bros. Discovery. If someone wants to make a better deal, which Warner Bros. Discovery board has said has not happened yet, then we’ll see what happens down the road. But let’s not get ahead of that process. And I certainly wouldn’t comment on the bidding strategy anyway. But the core of it is, you know, we’re super-disciplined buyers, as you probably know we have a reputation for such so that I’m willing to walk away and let someone else overpay for things. We have a rich history of that.\n\n\tYou’ve been asked many times about Warner Bros. and theatrical exhibition, and I know you have said very publicly that you would commit to a 45-day window. The sub-question there is …\n\n\tYour listeners can watch us now, cut a finger and do a blood oath together.\n\n\tYou did it under oath in front of the Senate. And that was quite a performance. You did not get rattled. I think the highest compliment we can say is you did not become a meme.\n\n\tI understand I have earned the skepticism on this issue for sure, but I have to just remind everybody we were not in the theatrical business. Any time I made any commentary about the theatrical business, it was an observation. It wasn’t a wish. It wasn’t a desire. We don’t compete with with time spent in the movie theater. When we just did the “Stranger Things” finale, we put it in theaters on the same day we released it on Netflix. About half the audience watched it in the theater after already watching it at home. So they watch it a second time, and the other half went home and watched it again. And what I think it does, anything you could do to raise enthusiasm and excitement for movies and television, you should do that. And I think when you can do it like this, that’s phenomenal. When somebody leaves their house, goes to see a movie, if they had a great experience in the theater, the first thing they want to do is watch another movie and they turn on Netflix. So I think it’s a hugely complementary business now, everything I’ve ever said about it before has just been raw observations of data. And I do think what we can do is to help make the movie business a more healthy business. I don’t want to open theaters and compete with theater owners. Of course not. What I want to do is supply them with great movies. And then they will provide a great experience for consumers. And we both have to do that for this to work. And I’m committing to my part, which is I’m going to give them movies, and we’re going to give them a window of time to exploit them. And they have to create a great experience for theater goers.\n\t\n\n\tWould Warner Bros.’ pay TV output remain with HBO, or would that potentially move over to Netflix?\n\n\tIt would remain with HBO, and there’s more than 100 output deals around the world that they will continue to honor.\n\n\tAbout the 45-day window — on day 46, would the movie be available to stream on HBO or potentially on Netflix?\n\n\tNo, it would go into a traditional [paid download] window after that, just so same as it does today.\n\n\tRight now there’s about a 90-day difference between the theatrical exhibition window, then PVOD and some other home entertainment windows.\n\n\tThe [PVOD] days are a little squishier than that. As you know, some films go a little faster, some go a little slower depending on how they’re doing or what their strategy is or holiday calendars and those kind of things. But these would go through from theatrical exclusivity, that 45-day window. After that it would go into various other traditional windows of PVOD and then go into the traditional pay-TV window.\n\n\tNetflix’s history is rooted in build, not buy. Obviously, this public lobbying campaign for WBD are unfamiliar territory for Netflix. Can you talk about how you got to the price that you got to? What were some of the components that made you confident in the number that you got to of almost $83 billion?\n\n\tLook, a lot of it is in the secret sauce of the business. So I’m not going to go into much rich detail on it, except for it was a bottoms up process of valuing the properties, valuing the films, valuing the series relative to price, relative to audience, all those kind of things. And so for us, when we looked at it, it is a culmination of our valuation work that we do every day, and we’ve been doing since we started streaming. But it’s also richly informed by intuition. We have all this history of this is what this revenue has been historically. But is it monetized to the best of its ability in the form that it’s in right now? So some that’s where the gut part comes in.\n\n\tMonday, Feb. 23 marks the end of the seven-day deadline. And if there is in fact an agreement, if the Warner Bros. Discovery board feels that they have put a superior offer on the table, you have a four-day period to match it. At the end of that, what is in your best case scenario? What’s the outcome?\n\t\n\n\tAgain, I don’t want to get ahead of this whole process. We we have the deal done. They have this window of time to get to a place where they make an offer, that they can then evaluate that offer, and then we can decide if or what we want to do. So that’s let’s just let it play out after Monday.\n\n\tThis morning, Paramount came out with the news that they have completed the Hart Scott Rodino process that is part of every regulatory review. They trumpeted that this is now completed but it obviously relates to a deal that they don’t have in hand. You have a deal in hand. Where does Netflix stand with that process?\n\n\tWe’re in the process, as you know, completing the HSR request and waiting ten days is not the same as being approved. That’s turning in the homework. That’s not getting a passing grade. And they know that too. The guy from their legal counsel who used to be in the Department of Justice ais on record saying that that means nothing. It just means that you’ve filled out the forms. I think it’s an unusual process that Paramount takes, putting out a press release that they met with the culture secretary. Maybe it’s that unusual for them to meet a culture minister that they put out a press release. But we deal with the culture ministers around the world every day. So we’ve not taken out press releases about our progress with the European regulators, but we are ongoing. We’re deep into the regulatory process. It is following traditional DOJ merger guideline rules that they’ve laid out nothing. There’s nothing unusual happening in this process. We’ve said it a couple of days ago. We knew that they would come out and try to make the HSR some kind of a milestone, which it is clearly not.\n\n\tDo you have any sense where the hurdles are going to be, where the discussions or even potentially down the road concessions in certain areas?\n\n\tMost of the work that we’ve been doing is un-ringing the bells of a misinformation campaign. What is our market share? I mean, the market share is very clear. Nielsen publishes the market share constantly called The Gauge, and it shows that we are 9 percent of the business. And if you put HBO together with us, we’re 10 percent of the business. And it certainly is nowhere near monopoly, which folks have been batting around the last couple of days, which is 50-70 percent market share. It’s insane. There’s no way you could dice the market up and say that we were that. And there’s also, I believe, no way that you could make it so narrow that it wouldn’t include things like YouTube. But let’s just say for the sake of indulging fantasy, you take YouTube out of it. We’re not even 20 percent of the marketplace for SVOD. So much of the work has been clearing up misconceptions that have been intentionally put in the market.\n\t\n\n\tBy traditional metrics of these things, monopoly, oligopoly, there’s definitely a very high bar. But as you know in the broader regulatory world and in media and outside of media, you’ve seen both under Republican and Democratic administrations, a more aggressive FTC. Certainly, this FCC is very, very crusading and very, very aggressive.\n\n\tI think Paramount and CBS have had to deal with that because they have a broadcast network.\n\n\tI know you you can’t get into detail, but are you to the stage of thinking of the concessions or the places where you would give to get a deal done?\n\n\tThose are remedies to deal with market concentration. We don’t have anywhere near the market concentration risk that would require those kind of remedies.\n\n\tYou’ve used the word misinformation. M&A processes are famously aggressive. Do you feel like the Ellisons and that the Paramount/Skydance Camp have done things that are below the belt beyond an aggressive pursuit of an asset?\n\n\tI think that putting out information that’s knowingly, provably wrong, is is pretty below the belt.\n\n\tWhat provably wrong information have they put out about Netflix?\n\n\tI’ve had people to me parrot back information — 60-70 percent market share, which is just obviously knowingly, provably wrong. I think much of the things you’ve heard about woke content that came out of the Senate hearing, I’m sure, was given to him directly from Paramount communications and policy people. I think it’s just meant to distract from what we have, which is a superior offer. And one way to try to defend your inferior offer is to try to attack ours, instead of just making a superior offer yourself.\n\n\tIn doing the math on things that have been talked about and things in SEC disclosures, you are saying that the numbers have added up to about $16 billion dollars in synergies that Paramount is looking at to make their numbers work.\n\n\tSo in their offer and their filings, they talk about $6 billion in synergies. That’s cost savings that they’re proposing in the deal, what they’re telling people who are lending them the money. And they said themselves in December on the record. If they were able to close this deal, they would end up with a business that’s six to seven times levered. This would be the largest [leveraged buyout] in history. And LBO are inherently risky. They have a very bad track record, even worse than media mergers generally. But when you look at this and say, well, what they’re doing to try to give people some comfort is saying that they intend to be two to three three times de-levered in as little as 18 months. So to do that is $16 billion, not six. Sixteen billion dollars worth of cuts. Now, I don’t know if it’s sixteen plus the six they are talking about or it’s six plus the 10 to get to 16. But it is definitely at least $16 billion to deliver that company. And their biggest cost centers are production and people. So these are job cuts. These are fewer productions. And at the same time that they’re promising more production somehow. I don’t understand the deal, but I do know how to count. And I do know that if you want to deliver a company from seven times down to two and a half times, it would cost at least that.\n\t\n\n\tWould you commit to preservation of a certain amount of jobs, committing to allocating a certain amount of resources?\n\n\tOur whole business track record has been about doing more, about adding more jobs, about more production. Remember the knock on Netflix was always there’s too much to watch. So this whole business model is contingent. The reason we’re buying this very expensive asset is because it generates revenue that we don’t currently make, and because we believe that putting these two companies together that we could better monetize those assets than they’re being monetized today. And we need all those people to keep making them. So I’m not proposing any cuts. We’re proposing to run Warner Bros. largely like it is today, television and film and running HBO largely as it is today, just giving it a better business model and better distribution. And that’s where the value and the deal is. It’s not those media mergers and what Skydance Paramount just did, what Fox and Disney did a few years ago. That is a classic horizontal media merger. You take two studios and turn them into one and cut all your costs in half and make less and don’t make more movies. So in Disney-Fox, they went from making over 30 movies between them to making around 20. So that’s not a big win for the town. Paramount is offering this exact thing, which is they’re going to take Paramount and Warner, two of the five remaining large studios and crush them down to one. Paramount put out like a half a dozen movies last year, and now they’re going to say that somehow they’re going to go to 30. So I don’t see how any of that makes sense. And, you know, this is a vertical merger, adding assets that we don’t currently have and having a balance sheet to continue to invest in them.\n\n\tYou’ve been consistent in saying we’re not buying this to dismantle it. I do think the YouTube of it all is fascinating, because it does seem it’s going to be, if not pivotal, very important in the regulatory process. If a regulator asked you to, could you show that Netflix was watching YouTube as a competitor long before the potential to buy Warner Bros. came into the picture?\n\n\tYou can go back to our quarterly earnings calls 10 years ago, and we identified YouTube as a potential competitor, and we’ve talked about them in nearly every quarter since. We definitely saw where this was going. We compete with YouTube on the television screen for viewing for advertisers, for subscription dollars and for ad dollars. And and creators as well, and projects as well. You know, we were bidding for the Oscars. We were bidding for the Brazil NFL football game. And that’s just going to continue to grow. So to me, it’s like you look at this and say OK, the television screen itself is a zero-sum game. When you’re on the screen, you cannot watch two apps at the same time. You can’t watch broadcast at the same time you watch Netflix. And so when you look at all the different the sea of choices that a consumer has broadcast cable, all the different direct to consumer ad choices, like Tubi and all these things, and you add them all together. You’d say, well, they don’t do exactly this, and they don’t do exactly that. But that’s what you’re choosing to do tonight on your screen. And then it’s paid for sometimes with advertising, sometimes with subscription, either way it’s monetized and it’s often the same content. It’s always the same viewer. So when I look at these things I think it’s a fantasy to say, here’s the world of television, and it doesn’t include the thing that people spend the most time doing, which is watching YouTube on TV. And I think people also lose track that this was a very deliberate move for YouTube to move off of the phone, where they were getting knocked around by TikTok and go onto the TV screen and compete there. So if they’re there on the TV screen, competing with Netflix, competing with broadcast, competing with HBO, competing with CBS, then they are on the TV and they are a competitor and they’re part of the competitive landscape.\n\t\n\n\tWere you disappointed about the Oscars?\n\n\tYeah, no. I’m glad — I hope it’s really good and strengthened the Academy, the deal that they got. So I hope it’s successful, and we’re thrilled about the SAG Awards next week.\n\n\tI want to talk about HBO because it is a huge component of this deal. And a big part of the issue certainly with the questions about concentration. Do you have a vision for it? Does HBO Max itself go away in a future where you do come together?\n\n\tWe’ll continue to distribute HBO Max as a standalone product, and will also offer some ways that they can get it in conjunction with a Netflix subscription as well. But I think in general, what it’s really important for this deal is that with HBO, we’re buying a very respected brand, incredible content, and we just we think we can better distribute it under our deal. I do think if you look at the difference between the businesses, they’ve been at this for a long time too, and I have said this before about the naming mechanics, why they went from HBO and HBO Go, HBO Now, HBO Max, Max, HBO Max, and and I said, look, when they get serious about the business, they’re going to just go by HBO because everyone loves HBO. What I want to do in this deal is make sure that HBO can keep being exactly what it is. It doesn’t need to become a general entertainment brand to get big. It needs to do exactly what it’s doing to get big, which is deliver great stories. And we have a rich history of taking great stories and making them big. And we didn’t have to contort prestige television into general entertainment to that. We do both prestige television and general entertainment.\n\n\tTo be clear, you would keep the HBO Max name alive. And not just HBO?\n\n\tI don’t know about the Max part. Remember we’ve always just used Netflix. We never were Netflix Plus or Netflix Max or any of those things. So I just think it’s a known well and respected brand, and I don’t think it actually needs any amplifiers.\n\n\tWould HBO would be better served with its more traditional, call it pre-2019, strategy before HBO Max launched in 2020. Would they be better served with a more bespoke and boutique lineup of programming?\n\n\tI don’t think that was true for us, but our roots began in DVD by mail. In that model, we carried everything ever published. So of course we’re a general entertainment brand because what happened is, as we grew up with consumers, if you love documentaries, Netflix was the best place in the world to get a documentary because you could. They were so under-distributed at the time. Foreign language film. Netflix was the best place to get a foreign language film. It was also the best place to get a big blockbuster movie that weekend. So for us, we’ve always been by design, a general entertainment brand that is highly personalized, personalized so that whatever you’re watching, Netflix would morph into that for you. And I think that has served us very well. I don’t think with HBO trying to say, well, let’s become Netflix. It was just always in our DNA to be one, to be this and in their DNA was always to be a little more prestige, and then trying to be something else just probably wasn’t a good use of resources. But I do think that you don’t for us, you know, “Adolescence” was, as prestige TV as you get. It just has swept through every awards. And remember “Baby Reindeer” before that and “Beef” before that. So when you look at that and think, OK, those are those were what you would call prestige TV. And they were enormous successes, big audience shows. And that’s what Netflix is really good at. Those two things have never been in conflict with each other on Netflix, and they won’t be with HBO programming in there as well. And I think the point of it is 85 percent of HBO subscribers also subscribe to Netflix. So that is a good example of how incredibly complementary these services are. And those people pay roughly a 100 percent premium to have both services today. So those folks are going to get a nice discount when this deal closes.\n\t\n\n\tI have the numbers here. Netflix is about $18 a month without ads. HBO Max is about $18.50 a month without ads. Obviously, the concern about pricing power, the concern about the cost of the service and the impact on consumers is one of the huge issues around this deal. What can you say now, what might you say in a regulatory filing in a couple of months that would be concrete and rock solid in terms of the cost of these services to people, especially because there is so much overlap?\n\n\tif there’s ever been a greater champion of consumer value in entertainment than Netflix, I don’t know who it is. Our whole history is about giving more for less. And we are very fine-tuned into the pricing. Price to value proposition. People always talk about affordability. Affordability is value. And when you look at what it costs for Netflix and how much entertainment value you get for Netflix, it’s probably the greatest value in the history of entertainment. And by the way, it’s one-click cancel if we’re ever wrong. So when our pricing goes up, if people look at it and they make a decision, they say, Well, I watch a lot of Netflix and I don’t want to not have Netflix and I’ll pay an extra buck or I’ll pay, you know, so they go through this every time we talk about pricing, and we don’t ever do that until we know we’ve got that value proposition in order. So we are very consumer-led. This notion that we’re just going to get these assets and raise the price on everybody….Those people are voluntarily paying one hundred percent more to add HBO to their Netflix subscription. They’re going to see tremendous value in a combined service. And if they don’t, if they only want HBO, some percentage of them only want HBO, we’ll continue to distribute HBO largely like it is today for them.\n\n\tFrom the most recent figures, Netflix right now is around 325 million subscribers global, HBO Max about 128 milllion. Netflix, about 89 million U.S., HBO Max about 58 million U.S. Where do you see the upside in that? Do you see the upside as being able to significantly expand that pie, whether globally or in the U.S., or is it going to come from efficiencies over time?\n\n\tRight now, even with all of our great successes, we’re about 10 percent of engagement view time. So can we win those moments more often over the years and grow that number? And then people will see great value in that.\n\t\n\n\tDo you know [HBO chief] Casey Bloys? Did you have a relationship before this?\n\n\tI know him socially and I deeply respect him. I think he’s done a phenomenal job there over the years, and he’s had this very long track record of doing it. Beyond that, I don’t know him well, but I do know the key creative leaders at the company. And I’ve just been so thrilled to get to spend some time with them through this process. And they seem to be quite really excited about it too, which just makes me happy because I would love to keep those folks in those chairs doing exactly what they’re doing for years to come.\n\n\tIn the last 10 years as Netflix really ramped up, were you ever tempted to buy a studio before? There were assets up for sale, including Warner Bros. in 2022. Were you ever tempted to jump in before this, or is this time with Warner Bros. Discovery sui generis for Netflix?\n\n\tIt was very unique because it did not have all of the linear television assets [cable channels CNN, TNT, etc.] attached to it that we didn’t want to get into. So when I look at that business, it’s not because it’s a bad business, it’s just not our business. I didn’t want a whole suite of linear TV channels to deal with. So this was a very unique offer because the Warner Bros. Discovery board decided was in their strategic best interest to sell these assets separate from the linear television assets. And that’s when it got attractive.\n\n\t“Strictly Business” is Variety’s weekly podcast featuring conversations with industry leaders about the business of media and entertainment.

    "body": "\n\tNatasha Kermani’s film began with a dark vision she couldn’t shake.\n\n\t“I couldn’t let go of this idea of two women living in a very desolate, barbaric landscape,” she says. “I felt like that was a relationship I didn’t see a lot, and one I wanted to explore. We see a lot of mothers and daughters, but we don’t see a lot of mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, two women of two different generations who have been thrust into coexistence.”\n\t\n\n\tFrom there, the idea of “The Dreadful” was born. The film, headed to theaters today via Lionsgate, is a dramatic horror tale set during the War of the Roses, at the tail end of the Dark Ages. Sophie Turner stars as Anne, who is living with her mother-in-law, Morwen (a fiery Marcia Gay Harden), while her husband is at war. But when her childhood friend (Kit Harington) tells her that her husband has died, they grow closer and evil starts lurking.\n\n\n\tWhile Kermani, who wrote and directed the film, is upfront about her love of genre films, she says she is always careful to make sure the scares work in service of the characters.\n\n\t“I don’t think anything I do is a horror conceit first,” she says. “Everything I do is based on relationship and a character’s journey from Point A to Point B. The horror needs to express that journey. The horror needs to be a color in our palette that we’re using to tell this character’s story. Often these characters are experiencing fear, so it’s always the question of, ‘What is this character afraid of?'”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSophie Turner and Natasha Kermani on the set of “The Dreadful.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKate Eccarius\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBeyond traditional scares, “The Dreadful” amps up the eerie atmosphere and discomfort. One meta element comes from the casting of Turner and Harington as lovers, which feels a bit wrong given that their “Game of Thrones” characters are raised as siblings. Even Turner admitted it felt odd. But Kermani says it’s a happy accident that audiences are coming in with that subtext.\n\t\n\n\t“These characters were always childhood friends,” she says. “One of the themes of the film is growing up, so she has these memories of this character as a child and their childhood together. Now here they are as adults, reevaluating their relationship. They’re not related in our film, but there is a bit of a love triangle, so there is a forbidden fruit feeling in our film. I think it’s interesting that it worked out that way.”\n\n\tKermani went on to praise Turner’s performance as uniquely intuitive, able to draw even more from her character beyond the script.\n\n\t“One of the things she latched onto was the character’s spirituality and inner strength,” she says. “I think that was something I didn’t necessarily see up front. I thought maybe this character would feel more childlike, a bit of a blank slate that evolves. But what Sophie brought that I loved so much, and I’m so glad she did, is that you can actually see that strength and steeliness in her from the first time she appears onscreen. She has these instincts and intuition for the characters that she is able to string through in a very consistent way.”\n\n\t“The Dreadful” is a melting pot of influences, including a reimagining of the folk tale that inspired the classic Japanese horror film “Onibaba.” Yet even as the stakes rise and the scares come along, Kermani says it’s a small-scale story at heart.\n\n\t“That core relationship between the two women, specifically the older generation and a younger generation, and the struggle between them as it starts to fray and to fall apart, and the one character is trying to move away, and the other one is trying to hold onto her, felt to me like an interesting sandbox to play in,” she says. “Everything else — the mythology, the fantastical elements, the period — really came out of exploring that core relationship.”\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “The Dreadful” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTurtle brothers Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo’s next big screen adventure will crash into theaters a little sooner than previously scheduled.\n\n\tThe new “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” movie, “Mutant Mayhem 2,” will debut on August 13, 2027, moving up a month from its announced September 17 release date.\n\n\t“Mutant Mayhem 2” is directed by Jeff Rowe with co-directors Kyler Spears and Yashar Kassai. Rowe and Spears worked on the first film alongside producers and writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who also return. Rounding out the producing team are Point Grey’s James Weaver, Josh Fagen and Ramsay McBean, with Lukas Williams serving as executive producer.\n\t\n\n\tThe “TMNT” brand has been a major priority for Paramount in recent years, and the focus on the beloved cross-generational IP only increased under the new Skydance management. The first “Mutant Mayhem” movie launched in August 2023, grossing $181 million worldwide. But Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies were already so bullish on the fresh new spin on the 40-year-old franchise that they began developing the sequel before the movie hit theaters. \n\n\n\tLast year, Paramount also added an untitled live-action/CG animation hybrid “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” film to the calendar for Nov. 17, 2028. It will be the first live-action “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” since 2016’s “Out of the Shadows.”\n\n\tThen, earlier this month, Paramount announced plans to expand the “TMNT” franchise through several ventures, including a major toy licensing partnership with Mattel (beginning in 2027), an illustrated book for middle schoolers (“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splinter’s Dojo”), a novel for adults (based on the bestselling graphic novel “The Last Ronin”), a preschool-targeted digital series (“Teeny Mutant Ninja Turtles” for YouTube) and themed pizzerias opening in Santa Monica, Monterrey, Mexico and Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNicole “Snooki” Polizzi, who first rose to fame as the star of MTV’s “Jersey Shore,” shared that she received a cervical cancer diagnosis. \n\n\t“My results came back for my cone biopsy, and it came back stage 1 cervical cancer called adenocarcinoma,” the reality star said in a nearly eight-minute long video posted to her TikTok account on Friday. “Obviously not the news that I was hoping for, but also not the worst news just because they caught it so early. Thank freaking God!”\n\t\n\n\tIn the video, Polizzi shared that she had been at a post-op appointment for a cone biopsy (a surgical procedure that removes tissue from the cervix to test for early-stage cervical cancer or precancerous cells) she’d had done earlier.  \n\n\n\tShe noted that she’d been “struggling with abnormal pap smears for three or four years now.” Earlier this year, Polizzi had shared on TikTok that her doctor had “found cancerous cells on the top of my cervix” following a colposcopy and biopsy. \n\n\t“That’s why I’m literally telling you guys to get your pap smears done. I’m 38 years old… and now look at me,” she said. “And instead of just putting it off because I didn’t want to go and it hurt and I was scared, no, I just went and did it. And it was there, cancer is in there. But it’s only stage 1 and it’s curable.”\n\n\t“So get your appointments done, bitches! I’m telling you,” she continued, noting that she’d likely need a hysterectomy and possible removal of her lymph nodes. “2026 is not panning out how I wanted it to, but also [it] could be worse.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s the dawn of a new era for Xbox.\n\n\tOn Friday, Microsoft Gaming announced longtime leader Phil Spencer would be retiring as CEO and that Asha Sharma, Microsoft CoreAI’s head of product development, had been named his successor. \n\n\tWith Spencer having been a staple in the gaming community for decades, Sharma knows she has some big shoes to fill, telling Variety in an interview she has “deep respect” for Spencer’s leadership and the legacy he’s leaving behind to her and now-chief content officer Matt Booty.\n\t\n\n\tSharma was quick in laying out her top priorities for Microsoft Gaming in an internal memo announcing her promotion, noting “great games,” “the return of Xbox” and the “future of play” as her three main commitments to the gaming community.\n\n\tSo first, what makes a great game for Sharma, whose roles prior to CoreAI include top positions at Instacart and Meta? The new Microsoft Gaming CEO tells Variety it’s all about games with “deep emotional resonance” and “a distinct point of view.” She wants to develop stories that make players “feel something,” like the kind of feelings Campo Santo’s 2016 first-person mystery “Firewatch” elicited in her.\n\n\tSharma takes on the mantle as head of the leading competitor to Sony’s PlayStation and Nintendo knowing full well she’s entering the role as an outsider to the larger gaming community and has “a lot to learn” still. But Sharma says she’s got a commitment to “being grounded in what the community is telling us.”\n\n\t“I’m coming into gaming as a platform builder,” Sharma said, adding that her goal is to “earn the right to be trusted by players and developers” and show the fanbase that “consistency” over time.\n\t\n\n\tIn her interview with Variety, Sharma acknowledged the tumultuous state of the gaming industry, referencing Matthew Ball’s recent State of Video Gaming in 2026 report as evidence that the larger “transformation” of the sector is “protecting what we believe in while remaining open‑minded about the future.”\n\n\tDue to her strong background in AI, initial reactions to Sharma’s appointment have raised concerns about what her specific views are on the use of generative AI in game development. Sharma says her stance is simple: she has “no tolerance for bad AI.”\n\n\t“AI has long been part of gaming and will continue to be,” Sharma said, noting that gaming needs new “growth engines,” but that “great stories are created by humans.”\n\n\tSpencer’s exit comes as Microsoft Gaming is approaching its 25th anniversary this fall, an event Sharma is looking forward to ushering in as she sets the stage for the company’s future. Sharma sees it as “a moment to honor the past while setting direction for the next chapter,” which will include big updates out of the upcoming GDC Festival of Gaming next March and even some larger announcements ahead of Xbox’s next Games Showcase presentation this spring.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAnderson Cooper turned down an opportunity to keep working there. Stephen Colbert recently became vocal about his relationship with attorneys at the same company. And Seth Strickland, a UFC fighter, didn’t think the league’s critical ties to the corporation would suffer if he threw out some profanity and disparaged celebrities while trying to promote a coming bout on the conglomerate’s streaming service.\n\n\tThe business in question is Paramount Skydance, owner of CBS, Paramount+ and cable networks like MTV and Comedy Central. And just as the organization careens toward one of the more pivotal chapters in its short existence, it seems to have talent problems.\n\t\n\n\tWhile Paramount Skydance “may easily be able to sign up talent that appeals to a MAGA base, what will be PSKY’s ability to sign talent that appeals to a bigger and more profitable audience?” asked Blair Levin, a media analyst for New Street Research in a note issued earlier this week. He sees a parallel with events taking place at the Kennedy Center, which artists have deserted as President Trump has sought a heavier hand in the types of shows and events taking place there. “The dynamic of talent migration leading to customer migration and then repeating in a vicious cycle downward could be repeated,” he cautioned.\n\n\tParamount Skydance is in the midst of a seven day window during which it can make  a “best and final offer” in its effort to pry Warner Bros. Discovery out of an agreement already in place to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix, then spin off its TV assets into a separate publicly traded concern. The negotiating window with Paramount ends Monday, Feb. 23.  Netflix, which granted Warner a waiver to hold new talks with its rival, would have four days to make a counteroffer in the event Paramount puts forward a higher bid.\n\t\n\n\tWhile the scene has played out on Wall Street, the company hasn’t seemed, um, paramount in the minds of some of its key personalities. A spokesperson for Paramount Skydance did not immediately respond to a query seeking comment.\n\n\tAnderson Cooper on Monday surprised the industry by issuing a statement on his own that he planned to leave CBS News’ “60 Minutes” to focus on expanding duties at CNN and spend more time with his young children. Even so, the move has been interpreted in media circles as the result of dissatisfaction with how the venerable newsmagazine has been treated in recent months, with senior executives pressing the show to cut back on its hard-news and investigative stories. One such segment  —  a piece by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi — was delayed for a few weeks by the new editor in chief of CBS News, Bari Weiss, after she said it required more response from Trump administration officials. When the story aired, it did so without edits, though some commentary was added in a preamble and an afterword.\n\n\tHaving an anchor walk off a major news program without a statement at the ready by the news division or its corporate parent is exceedingly rare. CBS News required nearly four hours to respond to news of Cooper’s exit — a sign that it was unexpected. CBS later said that for Cooper, “’60 Minutes’ will be here if he ever wants to return.”\n\n\tLater that evening, Stephen Colbert took the company to task. In remarks delivered on his February 16th program, the late-night host told viewers that network executives told him an interview with Democratic Texas Senate candidate James Talarico should not run on CBS, due to concerns it would run afoul of new guidance from the Trump administration that would hold talk shows to what is known as TV’s “equal time” rule, which requires broadcast networks and radio stations to give equal time to candidates in an election after one has made an appearance.\n\n\t“I was told, in some uncertain terms, that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on,” Colbert said. The show subsequently made the interview  made available on YouTube.\n\n\tCBS pushed back on the matter, noting later that Colbert and his staff were given “legal guidance” but were not “prohibited” from broadcasting the interview. This sparked another round, with Colbert retorting Tuesday that “I don’t even know what to do with this crap.”\n\t\n\n\tStrickland, who has developed a reputation for making outrageous statements, dropped some more Wednesday, hurling insults and offensive language at Bad Bunny and female athletes such as Ronda Rousey. He made the remarks during a media event to tout a UFC fight streaming Saturday on Paramount+\n\n\tParamount hasn’t been shy about its zeal to align itself with the Trump administration. But doing so may make its operations harder to monetize, says Levin, in his research note. “Telling talent that management’s top priority is to please governmental officials is a sure path to redirect them to entertainment platforms where management prioritizes supporting talent that knows how to attract customers,” he says.\n\n\tIn decades past, talent squabbles largely took place behind the scenes, but Parmount executives must realize that anchors, actors and sportscasters feel increasingly empowered to on screen and tell viewers when they are unhappy with the TV life. Pat McAfee, the colorful ESPN commentator and Rachel Maddow, the studious MS Now news analyst, would seem to have little in common. Both, however, have taken their media employers to task with blunt language on screen. So too have Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski and Chuck Todd, among others.\n\n\tWhat gives the talent such confidence in criticism? Perhaps the rise of social media and creator forums like newsletters and video podcasts, where telling it like it is (or at least appearing to) is the tone of the day. Paramount Skydance should probably expect more of the same in months to come — even when the company is not trying to put its best foot forward to acquire a major media property.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor the BDSM drama “Pillion,” Harry Melling traded the world of wizarding for one of leather, licking boots and orgies in the wilderness.\n\n\tBest known for playing Dudley Dursley in the “Harry Potter” films, the actor, now 36, takes on his first true leading role in Harry Lighton’s unorthodox romance. In the film, Melling plays Colin, a shy meter maid and barbershop quartet singer who catches the attention of Ray (Alexander Skarsgård), a stoic motorcyclist looking for a “sub” to fulfill his sexual (and domestic) desires.\n\t\n\n\tSoon, Colin is cooking meals and doing chores for Ray. They don’t kiss, and Ray makes him sleep on the floor by the bed like a dog. It might sound degrading, but when Colin appears midway through the movie in a leather biking outfit and shaved head, he looks liberated.\n\n\n\tBelow, Melling talks to Variety about the year’s kinkiest rom-com, getting comfortable with Skarsgård and why he has never consciously tried to escape the long shadow of Hogwarts.\n\t\n\t\tDid you have any hesitations when you first read the script?\t\n\n\tI kind of went in with no fear, to be honest. I think I would have been nervous if the sex scenes — or the more risky, out-there moments — weren’t grounded in the storytelling. If they’d just been interludes meant to be sexy, I think I would have felt quite nervous about that.\n\n\tBut when I read the script, I always felt those scenes were genuinely pushing the narrative forward. They tell the story very intricately — Colin’s journey from inexperience to experience — and because they were so embedded in the narrative, they felt like a continuation of the acting process rather than a moment designed to create a “beautiful love scene,” if you know what I mean.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat do you make of the studies that say Gen Z rejects sex scenes?\t\n\n\tWith a movie like “Pillion,” if you take the sex out of it, you don’t have a movie. The sex, the expression of it and the way it helps build the characters and their stories is so pivotal to the DNA of the film. I can’t really comment on the idea of a younger generation rejecting sex scenes. I’m 36 now, and in my experience of going to the movies, sex has always featured in some way. Maybe the question is more about how sex is being portrayed — perhaps that’s what’s shifting. I haven’t seen “Heated Rivalry” yet, but obviously in the states it has blown up. Maybe there’s something about sex being articulated in a different way now than it was before.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPILLION, Harry Melling, 2025. © A24 /Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen you choose roles, is there an appeal to go for projects that feel dangerous and exciting in order to shed the “Harry Potter” thing?\t\n\n\tIt’s never been something I’ve thought about directly. I’ve never said to myself, This is a good decision because it pushes me further away from how people might have seen me when I was younger. That’s not really how I operate. In fact, when I try to think strategically, it always backfires in some way.\n\n\tWhat I am looking for is variety. I’m always looking for new challenges and for as rich and varied a career as I can possibly have. And I know this sounds strange, but I’ve felt that way since I was about 10 years old, when I started doing the “Potter” films. Trying to deliberately maneuver away from “Harry Potter” would probably hinder me, because I’d be too aware of what I’m coming from. It’s far better to live in a kind of ignorance and just follow your nose — to pursue the work that genuinely excites you.\n\t\n\t\tYou and Alexander Skarsgård met only a couple of days before filming. How did you build trust in each other?\t\n\n\tI had done a week of filming prior to when Alex flew in. We met on a Saturday, and on Sunday we rehearsed the wrestling scene. We basically jumped on each other and worked that out, into the intimate scene. Then on Monday, we started shooting. It really was: “bish, bash, bosh — here we go.”\n\n\tFor my character especially, it was kind of incredible for that reason. Colin is always second-guessing Ray’s behavior — how do I please this man? What does he want? Am I in the right place? All of those thoughts are constantly running through his head. The fact that we hadn’t had months beforehand to sit down and talk through how we’d play the roles or what backstories we’d each imagined was actually really useful. It meant that what we were discovering happened in real time, on set, in front of the camera. It was a happy accident — not by design at all, just a logistical necessity because Alex was away — but it worked in our favor.\n\t\n\n\tWe also worked with an incredible intimacy coordinator, Robbie Taylor Hunt, who was instrumental in shaping those scenes. In many ways, his role is like that of a stunt director. It’s about camera placement, angles, physical positioning — the practical details that help sell a moment on screen — but also about protecting the narrative beats of the story. He was pivotal in making sure those scenes served the characters and the arc.\n\t\n\t\tIt’s funny to hear about how some of the sexiest scenes are filmed in very unsexy ways.\t\n\n\tOh, big time. If you saw some of the outtakes from the alleyway scene, where I’m giving Alex a blowjob, I was completely at the wrong angle. It looked hilarious. Hopefully, in the edit, the thrill of it comes across. But in the doing of it, it’s often just about nailing those small adjustments and technical details that help sell the sex of it.\n\t\n\t\tSome of the sex scenes are quite funny and elicit laughs, but the movie doesn’t mock the sexual subculture. How did you straddle that line between shock value and respect?\t\n\n\tA huge part of doing that was working with the GBMCC — the Gay Bikers Motorcycle Club. They’re a real organization, and they were in the film, playing the pillions and bikers, but they were also central to our research. They introduced me to people in the kink scene who taught me about things like bootlicking. They were a pivotal part of making the film feel authentic. A lot of them came to Cannes when the film premiered, and they seemed genuinely thrilled with the film. That was such an important thing, that they felt their story was represented on screen.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPILLION, from left: Alexander Skarsgard, Harry Melling, 2025. © A24 /Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOne of the things I enjoyed about the film is that Colin’s parents are incredibly supportive of him and set him up on dates with men. But they feel, justifiably, protective and slightly uncomfortable with his dynamic with Ray.\t\n\n\tThe parents’ journey in the film is almost the opposite of the norm. They start from a place of absolute acceptance. They’re almost overly supportive, suffocating Colin in certain ways — “Have you got a boyfriend yet?” and all of that. As the story progresses and they begin to understand — or not understand — Ray and the nature of the relationship, they shift. They don’t deny the relationship, but they challenge it. \n\t\n\n\tThe Sunday dinner scene was always one of the most important in the script for me, because it’s where all the perspectives coexist in one space. You’ve got Peggy, who’s deeply questioning the relationship and who Ray is and what his intentions are. You’ve got the dad trying to stay in the middle, keeping the peace. And then you’ve got Ray saying, “It’s a consensual relationship. Colin knows what this is. This is how it works. What’s the problem?”\n\n\tIt’s been fascinating talking to audiences in Q&As, because that’s the scene where people really divide. Some are firmly on Team Peggy; others are on Team Ray, asking what Peggy’s problem is — they’re happy, it’s working. For Colin, that confrontation becomes the catalyst for the final act. It’s the moment that pushes him to question the dynamic Ray has established and say, “Actually, I think I need more. I want more from this relationship.”\n\t\n\t\tWhen the relationship ends, Colin has developed a sense of what he wants and the ability to express that. Have you had similar moments in your career, of coming out of a project with newfound knowledge about yourself?\t\n\n\tSometimes there are things that linger; characteristics that hover and stay with you for a while after you finish. “Pillion” was the first film where I’m in nearly every scene and every shot, which is a very different beast for me. What stayed with me was Colin’s optimism and his curiosity — those are the things that really lingered. I felt like a much more receptive human being for a long while, because I was still in Colin’s pursuit of understanding, his wanting to put himself together. When I finished playing Edgar Allan Poe in “The Pale Blue Eye,” it had a different kind of after-effect — a quite sad one, given the ending of that film. Every movie is somewhat different in terms of the place it leaves you.\n\t\n\t\tWhat feedback have you gotten so far on “Pillion”? Have you talked to people in sub/Dom relationships?\t\n\n\tA lot of the Q&As we’ve been doing, particularly in the U.K., have been fascinating. We spoke to one woman after a screening who was really interested in talking about consent — about how in some relationships, a contract is drawn up to establish the rules, and how that didn’t happen in “Pillion.” It’s interesting, because there are just so many different versions of how these relationships can work. A lot of people come up to me and say, “I understand Colin” or “I felt like I was Colin” — and that, to me, is really moving, that they feel they can share that with me.\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed. “Pillion” is in theaters now.\n",

The group will continue scheduled activities during this time, and we look forward to being together again when the time is right.”\n\t\n\n\tThe global girl group, which also includes Daniela Avanzini, Lara Raj, Megan Skiendiel, Sophia Laforteza and Yoonchae Jeung, climbed the ranks as K-pop trainees on the 2023 reality competition series “Dream Academy.” Katseye became breakout performers following the Netflix docuseries “Popstar Academy: Katseye” along with their aptly-titled first single “Debut.”\n\n\tIn their time together as a group, they’ve released a pair of EPs — 2024’s “SIS (Soft Is Strong)” and last year’s “Beautiful Chaos” — as well as a handful of singles. “Gnarly,” which was co-written by Alice Longyu Gao, became their first song to hit the Billboard Hot 100 last year. The sextet followed with “Gabriela,” “Gameboy” and “Internet Girl,” the latter of which debuted at No. 29 on the chart last month.\n\n\tKatseye performed “Gnarly” at the Grammy Awards earlier this month. In addition to their best new artist nod, “Gabriela” was nominated for best pop duo/group performance.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tLeonardo DiCaprio, Emma Stone and the independent Irish drama “Christy” were among the winners at the 2026 Irish Film and Television Awards, announced in Dublin on Friday.\n\n\tThe Brendan Canty-directed “Christy” (not to be confused with the Sydney Sweeney boxing drama of the same name) entered the night as the top-nominated title with 14 mentions and delivered in key races, winning best film, director and casting, along with editing and a supporting actor prize for Jamie Forde.

In the docs, Aaron says he entered a plea of not guilty and has denied all of Denise’s claims of abuse.\n      \n\n          In his filing, Aaron said he is without a stable income, while Denise earns a ton from reality television gigs and OnlyFans.\n      \n    \n          He also argues he took the photos for OnlyFans and should be paid a 50-percent cut of the profits, because the pics are his intellectual property. Aaron said he was supposed to be paid for his role on Denise’s Bravo reality show, but was never paid a dime.\n      \n    \n          Denise and Aaron wed in 2018 and split in 2025. The \"Wild Things\" star obtained a restraining order against Aaron and he is still facing criminal charges.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Denise Richards\n              \n                          \n                Aaron Phypers\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Divorce\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tMarc Maron interviewed former president Barack Obama on the 1,686th and final episode of his pioneering “WTF” podcast.\n\n\tObama was previously a guest on the show while still in office in 2015, marking a milestone for “WTF” and helping legitimize podcasts in general as a political platform. A decade ago, Obama recorded the interview in Maron’s garage in Los Angeles; for the final episode of the podcast, Maron traveled to his office in Washington, D.C.\n\t\n\n\t“First of all, congratulations. Second of all, I’m honored to be on your last show,” Obama said, then asking Maron how he is feeling about moving on from a “defining” part of his career and life.\n\n\n\t“I feel OK. I feel like I’m sort of ready for the break,” Maron said. “But there is sort of a fear of: ‘What do I do now?'”\n\n\tObama asked Maron how old he is, and then gave the 62-year-old comedian advice. “You’ve still got a couple of chapters left,” Obama said. “Don’t rush into what the next thing is. Take a beat. Take some satisfaction looking backwards. … Just be a little brain-dead for a while.”\n\n\tOver the course of an hour-long interview, the two spoke about the state of the world and how to stay optimistic amid political strife and chaos. Obama referenced Maron’s stand-up bit about how liberals “annoyed the average American into fascism.”\n\n\t“You can’t just be a scold all the time,” Obama said. “You can’t constantly lecture people without acknowledging that you’ve got some blind spots too, and that life’s messy.”\n\n\tAt the end of the interview, Obama took a moment to praise Maron and acknowledge the impact of “WTF,” which has boasted guests like Paul McCartney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Robin Williams and Lynn Shelton, who Maron would go on to marry. \n\t\n\n\t“Part of the reason you had such a big fan base during this 16-year run is there is a core decency to you and the conversations you had … that I think speaks to who we are,” Obama said. “We can’t take this stuff for granted, but my experience is: Most people are really decent. And I think that’s why, when they hear somebody else who is, it gives them courage. It gives them hope. And you should be proud of having done that.”\n\n\tThe final episode of “WTF” was not an emotional farewell. Maron got that out of the way in the penultimate episode, which did not feature a guest. Maron recapped his 16 years hosting the show and explained why it made him “more empathetic of others” and taught him to “surrender my selfishness.” “I imagine that some of you took some of that away from this,” Maron said. \n\n\t“I’m grateful to have been part of your lives,” Maron said on Thursday’s episode. “We’ve been through a lot of stuff together. A lot of breakups. Death. Cats. The world.” Holding back tears, he named the pets he lost over the years and ended the episode by saying: “Cat angels everywhere.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBanijay Benelux has taken a majority stake in Dutch label Werktitel, expanding its portfolio of production companies and broadening its activities in the creator space.\n\n\tNoting that Werktitel was focused on opportunities in the creator economy, Banijay Benelux, part of Banijay Entertainment, said the acquisition was intended to diversify the company’s “content and partnerships across fast-growing platforms.”  \n\n\n\tFounded by Bob ten Berge, David Mol and Timo Verbruggen, Werktitel develops innovative concepts for online creators, brands and producers, spanning IP and content development, live and theater productions, and live experience marketing and publishing. The team also strategically supports creators on creative growth, market positioning and business development.\n\t\n\n\t“With the addition of Werktitel, we’re taking a major step forward within the creator economy,” said Banijay Benelux CEO Sandra Hilster.\n\n\t“Bob, David and Timo have quickly built a close-knit hub where online talent can truly grow and flourish. The theater shows, and branded live events they’ve developed and produced, are only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what they can achieve. And their approach – combining creativity with entrepreneurship – aligns perfectly with our core values at Banijay Benelux.”\n\n\tIn a joint comment, Ten Berge, Mol and Verbruggen, added: “Banijay Benelux is the ideal partner to help us take our hub to the next level. Backed by its vast network, state-of-the-art studio facilities, and proven production expertise, we’re positioned to build a truly modern ecosystem that taps into the power of creator economy — we can think bigger, move faster and build new and scalable collaborations.”\n\t\n\n\tWerktitel develops and produces innovative concepts at the intersection of entertainment, live experience and brand activation. As part of its activities, the   company previously produced the theater show “VrouwMiShow,” featuring Nina Warink, Iris Enthoven and Sophie Milzink, as well as the live podcast musical “De Stijn, Tobi & Jeppe Show.”\n\n\tFor the upcoming theater season, the company has tours for Eva Eikhout, Quinn and Aaron, and Hokjesdenker — creators who each push the boundaries between online and live performance.\n\n\tProviding strategic guidance around channel management, Werktitel already works closely with creators Quinn and Aaron Bezemer, who generate over 50 million monthly views on YouTube Shorts. It also develops branded partnerships with them for the likes of Intertoys, Lego and Samsung, and for Broodjestester, the company facilitated collaborations with Burger King, Netflix and HEMA.\n\n\tThe team has also produced online social series such as “Gen Zwevend” for content creator Annemarie Lekkerkerker.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBanijay Entertainment boss Marco Bassetti told an audience at TV conference and market Mipcom Monday that the company has commissioned 10 new pilots from partners in the creator economy in France and U.K., utilizing dormant IP from the Banijay catalog. He describes this as a “test.”\n\n\tWorking more closely with the creator economy was a priority for the company, he said, during an onstage conversation with Elsa Keslassy, Variety‘s executive editor of international, and Cynthia Littleton, the magazine’s co-editor-in-chief, after he was honored with the Variety Vanguard Award.\n\t\n\n\t“For us, it’s an opportunity to test, to launch and maybe to scale up in the future some of our dormant IP, because we have a huge dormant catalog of formats, or maybe to launch a new show,” he said.\n\n\n\tHe sounded a note of caution with regards to the financial model of this type of partnership with creators. “For sure, a clear business model, to be very honest, is not yet there. The only one that has made a lot of money is the creator,” he said. “For us, it’s quite complicated, because our cost of production is different from what their cost of production is. So to find the balance where it is a win, win for both is not yet there, but we will continue to test.”\n\n\tBassetti said that it could become a win-win situation with the creators, where Banijay could bring the IP and the capacity to produce to a high standard and the creators bring a “huge community.”\n\n\tMore to follow.\n",

    "body": "\n\tM. Night Shyamalan will direct a scripted, live-action TV show based on Mattel’s famous Magic 8 Ball toy.\n\n\tThe project is written by Brad Falchuk, the co-creator of “Glee,” “American Horror Story,” the “911” series and more television titans.\n\n\tShyamalan, the horror master behind “The Sixth Sense,” “The Village” and last year’s “Trap,” made the announcement on Instagram, posting a script that reads: “Magic 8 Ball Season 1 ‘Pilot.'” He and Falchuk serve as co-creators on the series, which is produced by Mattel Studios.\n\t\n\n\t“Been working on this for a couple years… Who’s in?” Shyamalan asked in the caption, with the hashtag “It Is Certain,” nodding to a popular response from the fortune-telling device.\n\n\n\tIt’s unclear who will distribute the “Magic 8 Ball” series, or whether talent is yet attached.\n\n\tInvented in 1946, the Magic 8 Ball is a black sphere that, when shaken, provides “advice” in response to yes-or-no questions. After you ask the toy a question and shake it, an answer will appear. Responses range from affirmative (“Without a doubt”) to neutral (“Ask again later”) to negative (“My sources say no”).\n\n\tMattel has buffed up its film and television divisions after the launch of Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” a $1.4 billion-grossing blockbuster starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the plastic toys. Mattel Television had previously produced various TV shows based on Barbie, Polly Pocket, Masters of the Universe, Thomas the Train, Pictionary, Hot Wheels and other IP.\n\n\tOn the film side, the company is producing the “Masters of the Universe” movie starring Nicholas Galitzine and Camila Mendes, due in 2026. Plenty of other projects are in development, including a Hot Wheels movie; a Barney film written by Ayo Edebiri and produced by Daniel Kaluuya; a live-action Matchbox movie; a Polly Pockets film with Lena Dunham and Lily Collins; and a Vin Diesel title based on the Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots toy.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDoc Martin himself is coming to Fox. \n\n\tVariety has learned that Martin Clunes, the star of the long-running ITV series “Doc Martin,” is set to guest star on “Best Medicine,” the American remake of the series currently in the works at Fox. \n\n\tClunes will appear alongside Josh Charles, who stars in “Best Medicine” as Dr. Martin Best. Clunes will play Dr. Robert Best, Martin’s father. The official character description states Robert is “an accomplished, headstrong gastroenterologist whose abrasive demeanor makes Martin look practically cozy by comparison. Estranged from his sister Sarah (Annie Potts), Robert’s surprise visit to Port Wenn puts everyone on edge. But underneath his snobby, stone-cold exterior, he’s hiding a few secrets of his own… that could turn Martin’s new life upside down, and force him to confront his past.”\n\t\n\n\tClunes starred in “Doc Martin” throughout the show’s 10-season run at ITV. He also previously starred in the BBC comedy “Men Behaving Badly,” for which he on a BAFTA TV Award. His other TV credits include “No Place Like Home,” “All at No 20,” “Jeeves and Wooster,” “Goodbye Mr. Chips,” and “William and Mary.” \n\n\n\tHe is repped by Independent Talent Group. \n\n\tAlong with Charles and Potts, the cast of “Best Medicine” includes Abigail Spencer, Annie Potts, Josh Segarra, Cree, John DiMaggio, Didi Conn, Clea Lewis, Stephen Spinella, Jason Veasey, Carter Shimp and Cindy De La Cruz\n\n\tThe official series description states:\n\n\t“The series centers on Martin Best (Charles), a brilliant surgeon who abruptly leaves his illustrious career in Boston to become the general practitioner in a quaint East Coast fishing village where he spent summers as a child. Unfortunately, Martin’s blunt and borderline rude bedside manner rubs the quirky, needy locals the wrong way, and he quickly alienates the town, even though he’s all they’ve got. Although Martin can expertly address any medical ailment or mystery in this idiosyncratic town, he’s really just desperate to be left the hell alone. Instead, he keeps getting dragged right smack into the middle of their personal chaos, feuds and fantasies. What the locals don’t know is that Martin’s terse demeanor masks a debilitating new phobia and deep-seated psychological issues that prevent him from experiencing true intimacy with anyone. But tenacity is the creed of everyone in their small village, and the people who live there may be exactly what the doctor ordered.”\n\t\n\n\t“Best Medicine” is executive produced by Ben Silverman, Howard T. Owens, Rodney Ferrell, Liz Tuccillo, Mark Crowdy and Philippa Braithwaite. In the U.K., “Doc Martin” was produced by Buffalo Pictures in association with Homerun Film Productions. The format, from All3Media International, was brought to the U.S. by Propagate Content. Fox Entertainment Studios will produce, with Fox Entertainment wholly owning the new series. The series is distributed worldwide by Fox Entertainment Global. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“F1: The Movie” will zoom to the small screen around the holiday season. The sports drama, starring Brad Pitt as a has-been Formula One driver, is making its global streaming debut on Apple TV on Dec. 12.\n\n\t“F1” was released in theaters in June and generated a huge $629 million at the global box office, becoming the highest-grossing movie of Pitt’s career as well as the biggest film ever for Apple Original Films. It’s one of just six releases in 2025 to cross the $600 million mark. Directed by Joseph Kosinski (“Top Gun: Maverick”), “F1” follows Pitt’s character as he emerges from retirement to coach a rookie driver and save a failing team. Damson Idris, Kerry Condon and Tobias Menzies co-star in the film, while real-life Formula One champ Lewis Hamilton counts himself among the producers.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s been thrilling to see audiences around the world embrace ‘F1 The Movie ’ in theaters,” said producer Jerry Bruckheimer. “Now, we’re beyond excited to bring this exhilarating, cinematic ride to fans everywhere through Apple TV’s unparalleled global reach. Partnering with Apple and Formula 1 has been an incredible journey, and we’re proud that even more viewers, from every corner of the world, will get to experience the heart-pounding action and passion that defines ‘F1.’”\n\n\n\tAfter Apple’s string of commercial misfires, including “Killers of the Flower Moon” and “Napoleon,” the crowd-pleasing “F1” has been considered a step in the right direction for the fledgling studio’s theatrical ambitions. The $250 million-budgeted film benefitted at the box office from positive word-of-mouth, premium formats like Imax and Dolby, as well as international appeal (overseas territories accounted for a mighty $439 million of ticket sales). \n\t\n\n\tIn Variety’s review, chief film critic Owen Gleiberman praised the action adventure, writing that “there’s a certain kind of summer movie that’s so revved and ready to go, so fuel-injected with flash and talent and star power, not to mention an irresistible subject, that before the movie is barely under way you can feel yourself getting excited about being excited. ‘F1’ is one of those movies.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt has taken over 50 years for Guillermo del Toro’s most personal project to make it to the big screen — since “The Shape of Water” filmmaker was just seven years old and first fell in love with Mary Shelley’s seminal, monstrous creation. But at its Hollywood premiere, del Toro seemed assured that his “Frankenstein” was invading theaters (and soon, Netflix) and just the right time.\n\n\t“To me, [the message] is to reconnect emotionally to the idea of the power of forgiveness and acceptance — which is absolutely … a very scarce material right now,” he explained to Variety, adding that a new, “handmaid” version crafted by humans and “acted in human terms” was essential in 2025. “It’s not a blockbuster — a preconceived notion. It’s not a franchise. It’s something that it speaks very directly and autobiographically, unfortunately to me and many in the past.”\n\t\n\n\tThe idea of a misunderstood monster has recurred throughout del Toro’s work, not only in the Oscar-winning “Shape of Water,” but in his most recent directorial efforts “Pinocchio” and “Nightmare Alley.”\n\n\n\t“It’s all about respect and love the other,” composer Alexandre Desplat explained. “In Greek, you say ‘xenophilia,’ which means ‘love the stranger.’ Because when you love the stranger, the stranger loves you. It makes a big difference.”\n\n\t“I think it demands hope,” said Jacob Elordi, who plays the famed monster. “I think this film demands that we’re hopeful, and it demands that we are emotional and that we see the beauty.”\n\n\tElordi said that both “Frankenstein” and Emily Brontë’s “Wuthering Heights” — which he’ll appear as Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell’s adaptation of next year — were novels he was reluctant to read as a teenager, but was excited to rediscover at this moment in time.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve [grown up] and I’m in my later-20s now, so they mean something else — the experience of … the characters. It’s kind of ideal,” he said.\n\n\tMia Goth, who portrays Elizabeth Lavenza said she was nervous to work with the esteemed del Toro.\n\n\t“I’ve never been so scared stepping into a movie. I really haven’t,” Goth said. “It was a lot for me, and I was always in my head. I kept thinking to myself, ‘Guillermo del Toro is making ‘Frankenstein,’ the movie you’ve always wanted him to make, and I get to be a part of that.’ And I was so scared that I was going to be the one bad thing in it, and I would ruin it.”\n\n\tGoth said she eventually meditated her way out of self-doubt. “I decided to feel that moment when you open your eyes, you have that calm and just a little bit more wisdom. That’s where Elizabeth was.”\n\n\tDr. Frankenstein himself, Oscar Isaac, explained that del Toro instilled confidence in his performers.\n\n\t“He very quickly said this: ‘You cannot fail. I made this bespoke for you.’ He approached it the same way that Mary approached writing ‘Frankenstein,’ which is making it a completely personal expression of what their experience has been, and it’s what he asked us to do as well,” Isaac said. “So as long as we were doing that in an honest, passionate way, there was no failing and there was no obligation.”\n\n\tFelix Kammerer, who plays Dr. Frankenstein’s brother, was approached by del Toro during the 2023 Oscars, when “All Quiet on the Western Front” — in which Kammerer starred — took home the award for Best International Feature Film.\n\n\t“I went to the bathroom, and he approached me, and he just pulled me aside, ‘When are we going to work together, kid?’ And then I told him my agency and how to reach out, and I thought, ‘He’s never going to call,’” Kammerer recalled. “Two weeks later, my agent calls, and she says, ‘So Guillermo del Toro wants to talk to you.’”\n\n\tIt was del Toro’s perfect ensemble for the story he’s always dreamed of telling — despite the fact that for decades, producer Scott Stuber said, it seemed “Frankenstein” was del Toro’s “white whale.”\n\n\t“This was the right time. We tried a couple times earlier, but [del Toro’s] like, ‘This was the right time for me to understand the themes and mythology and what I want to tell of the story,” Stuber related.\n\t\n\n\t“Frankenstein” arrives in select theaters Oct. 17 and will stream on Netflix Nov. 7.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNaomi Watts has two Oscar nominations and was a 2024 Emmy nominee, but there’s something different about the latest honor she is about to receive. The thought that her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame will be there for family, friends and industry compatriots to see — not to mention fans, tourists and any-one else who happens to stroll past that stretch of sidewalk —makes it feel, well … concrete. Literally.\n\n\t“I can’t even believe it,” she says of the accolade, shaking her head in disbelief. “It’s interesting, because I have all kinds of imposter syndrome. I’ve always felt like I’m supposed to struggle, I’m supposed to keep proving myself, and this sort of just came out of the blue. It’s really lovely.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Oct. 13 ceremony will be a milestone moment for a career that’s now spanned more than two decades, from her breakout role in David Lynch’s L.A. neo-noir “Mulholland Drive” to her recent run of collaborations with Ryan Murphy (current project count: four, including the soon-to-debut legal drama “All’s Fair”).\n\n\n\tWatts was drawn to acting at an early age. The actor, who was born in England, recalls watching her mother perform in a local play in Shoreham, Kent, when she was around 4 or 5 years old, and not understanding why she wouldn’t acknowledge her daughter waving from the audience. Finally, “to put me out of my frustration,” her mother gave her a little wink and wave — and the young Watts was transported: “I thought, that’s a world I want to be a part of.”\n\n\tThat love of acting carried her through a move from England to Australia at age 14 — her mother promised to put her in an acting class to ease the transition — and then her early years working Down Under and struggling to find her footing in Hollywood. “I pretty much was deemed as unhireable,” Watts remembers of that late 1990s period. “I was flunking auditions over and over again, or I’d get in a movie and it would get cut down or out. It was just bad luck.” But those fortunes reversed when casting director Johanna Ray called her in for a television pilot Lynch was working on.\n\t\n\n\tLynch’s method of casting, choosing actors to consider based on headshots, meant her odds were better, and she cut a family vacation short to meet with him. “The minute I walked in, it just felt different,” Watts remembers. “He was present. He was asking me questions. It felt very different than any previous audition I’d gone to — there were so many where it’s a line of people, you’ve had to wait two hours, you’ve had to drive across town to get there and then go back the next day, and people would barely look at you. But David just lit up, and I was able to connect with him in a different way.”\n\n\tWhen ABC rejected the pilot, Lynch re-fashioned it as a movie, and his Hollywood story became Watts’ Hollywood breakout. Released in 2001, “Mulholland Drive” received widespread critical acclaim, as did Watts’ dual performances as fresh-faced ingenue Betty Elms and the bitter, hardened Diane Selwyn, two very different shades of the L.A. experience. \n\n\tLynch (who died in January 2025) told the L.A. Times in 2001 that he “saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence — possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package.”\n\n\tNearly a quarter-century later, both the film and Watts’ tour-de-force portrayal(s) are still spoken of reverently. She hasn’t seen the film in some 20 years, though she does want to revisit it. “It would have a whole other meaning now, with David gone. I just wish he could be there,” she says.\n\n\t“Mulholland’s” triumph put Watts on the map, and on the radar of other major filmmakers. In the years that followed, she appeared in films from Gore Verbinski (“The Ring”), Alejandro González Iñárritu (“21 Grams,” and her first Oscar nomination), David O. Russell (“I Heart Huckabees”), Peter Jackson (“King Kong”), David Cronenberg (“Eastern Promises”) and J.A. Bayona (“The Impossible,” her second Oscar nod), to name a few. That impressive resume spans blockbuster spectacle and intimate drama, with much of it tying back to themes of grief and identity, things she’s had to probe in her own life. “I lost my father very young, and then we moved around a lot. My mom was trying to find her feet, [I went through] several different schools and counties in the U.K., then moving countries. So [that concept of] having to reshape myself. How do I fit in?”\n\t\n\n\tIn recent years, while Watts has kept up a stream of film credits (among them dramas like “Emmanuelle,” “Penguin Bloom” and acting against a canine co-star in “The Friend”), she’s done some of her best work on the small screen, much of it with Murphy. After starring in his 2022 thriller series “The Watcher,” Watts has joined the roster of actors Murphy turns to again and again. \n\n\tWorking with him “has been incredibly meaningful at this point in my life,” Watts says, adding, “I trust him wholeheartedly. … He’s very good to women. It’s so rare that you get to even work opposite other women — it’s usually you and a bunch of guys. But more than once now, I’ve worked with a bunch of great women” in his projects. Those collaborations also include her Emmy-nominated work as Babe Paley in “Feud: Capote vs. the Swans”; the “escapism” and “juicy drama” of “All’s Fair”; and a three-episode guest arc as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the upcoming “American Love Story,” focusing on John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy.\n\n\tWatts will be the first to note her career hasn’t been a straight-upward trajectory: she makes an up-and-down motion to illustrate, versus the up-up-up others might experience. Part of that is because she’s taken risks, or took time to be present for her children. But that awareness that none of this came easy or fast is part of what continues to drive her — and she has no plans to slow down. \n\n\tWhile she loves her work with Murphy and the family she’s found in him and that team, she’s also excited to stretch herself by “working with new and exciting people doing bold things, things that take me out of my comfort zone.” She has projects on the horizon that fall into that realm, she says, and she’s keen to do more comedy in the wake of her appearance in Lena Dunham’s rom-com series “Too Much.”\n\n\tBut first, there’s a Walk of Fame star to unveil. Murphy will be a speaker at the ceremony, and other attendees could include her “Mulholland” co-star Justin Theroux and Edward Norton, who worked with her on “The Painted Veil.” She hopes some of the “All’s Fair” ladies will attend, and perhaps her “St. Vincent” and “The Friend” co-star Bill Murray too (“You never know with him!” she notes with a laugh).\n\t\n\n\tThe magnitude of the moment isn’t lost on her. “I struggled for so long. I’m so familiar with that side of things more than this incredible good fortune, celebrations like this. It’s wonderful.” You could even call it the stuff Hollywood dreams are made of.\n\n\tTipsheetWHAT Naomi Watts receives a star on the Hollywood Walk of Famewhen 11:30 a.m., Oct. 13WHERE 6201 Hollywood Blvd., HollywoodWEB http://www.walkoffame.com\n",

    "body": "\n\tMediawan Pictures boss Elisabeth d’Arvieu said that the decision to relocate its distribution business from Paris to London – headed up by former All3Media International exec Sally Habbershaw – was part of a new strategy to move “the gravity center of our international sales activity” to the U.K.\n\n\tThe news came just a month after Brad Pitt’s production company Plan B, in which Mediawan acquired a majority stake three years ago, announced they were opening a London office led by “Baby Reindeer” producer Ed Macdonald.\n\t\n\n\t“We also wanted to grow in general our English-speaking content,” d’Arvieu said of Mediawan’s distribution business during a conversation with Variety’s co-editor-in-chief Cynthia Littleton at the Cannes-based TV confab Mipcom. “In four years we partnered with Drama Republic…. we partnered with See-Saw, we launched Plan B in Europe… So English-speaking content and international content in general was becoming more and more key.”\n\n\n\tThe company, which is headed by chairman and co-founder Pierre-Antoine Capton, has been riding on a wave of hits, including from Plan B’s racing drama “F1: The Movie” which became Apple’s highest grossing movie to date, and the multi-Emmy Award-winning series “Adolescence,” as well as “Slow Horses’” from See-Saw Films. \n\n\tThe Paris-based executive said Mediawan was “very, very happy that Sally brings her expertise on the U.S. market in particular, which has proven to be a challenging one […] and it will allow us to really accelerate on the English-speaking side and our English-speaking content.”\n\t\n\n\tD’Arvieu also gave some insight into the decision behind acquiring a stake in Plan B. “We are a European studio and we remain a European studio — but we felt the need to be put on the map in the U.S.,” d’Arvieu explained. “To be identified by commissioners and by clients. We also wanted to follow up on the promise that we made to our European talents, to give them a proper international exposure and to give the proper international exposure to their art. And we know that the U.S. markets are key.”\n\n\tThe Mediawan Pictures boss, who works closely with Capton, also admitted that part of the reason to move on a U.S. company was because she and her colleagues were “frustrated” by the fact that their IPs were being “exploited in the U.S. – not by us.” To wit, one of Plan B’s latest projects, currently in production, is “Weekend Rebels,” which is an adaptation of a German Mediawan film.\n\n\tLittleton also asked whether Mediawan has plans to move into areas outside of its core film and TV business, to which d’Arvieu acknowledged that “diversification is key.” She cited huge IPs like French animation “Miraculous” and comedy-drama “Call My Agent” as examples where “you have to explore the full potential,” which could include a musical, live experience or consumer products.\n\n\tThere is also integration into film and TV, particularly in the areas of sports and luxury brands. “I’m not talking about product placement,” d’Arvieu explained. “I’m talking about telling stories for them, reaching an audience for them in a different way.”\n",

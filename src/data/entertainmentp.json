    "body": "\n\tThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented Honorary Oscars to actor and producer Tom Cruise, choreographer and actor Debbie Allen and production designer Wynn Thomas at the 16th Governors Awards on Sunday at the Ray Dolby Ballroom in Hollywood.\n\n\tMusic icon and philanthropist Dolly Parton received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, which she accepted via a pre-recorded message.\n\n\n\tThe annual event, produced by Jennifer Fox, drew numerous filmmakers, stars and Oscar hopefuls. Director Guillermo del Toro attended alongside his “Frankenstein” cast members Jacob Elordi, Oscar Isaac and Mia Goth, as well as costume designer Kate Hawley and composer Alexandre Desplat. \n\t\n\n\tOther notable attendees I spotted included Noah Baumbach and Adam Sandler from “Jay Kelly,” Edward Berger and Colin Farrell from “Ballad of a Small Player,” and Kate Winslet with writer Joe Anders from “Goodbye June.” Directors Clint Bentley, Richard Linklater and Rian Johnson were present with cast members from their respective films “Train Dreams,” “Nouvelle Vague” and “Wake Up Dead Man.” “Wicked: For Good” stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo also charmed the room, along with Ethan Hawke from “Blue Moon” and Chloé Zhao from “Hamnet.”\n\n\tNotable absences included Timothée Chalamet from “Marty Supreme,” Paul Mescal from “Hamnet” and Russell Crowe from “Nuremberg.”\n\n\tLegendary production designer Wynn Thomas received his first Oscar, presented by Octavia Spencer. Widely recognized as the first African American production designer in film history, Thomas has worked with directors including Spike Lee, Tim Burton and Ron Howard on films such as “Do the Right Thing,” “Malcolm X,” “Hidden Figures” and “A Beautiful Mind.” He was also the first African American to join the Art Directors Guild and be nominated for an Art Directors Guild award.\n\t\n\n\tIn his acceptance speech, Thomas reflected on growing up poor and Black in Philadelphia, finding escape and purpose in books. He delivered the night’s biggest laugh with this line: “The local gangs looked down on me and called me a sissy. But that sissy grew up to work with some great filmmakers!”\n\n\t“Wicked for Good” star Cynthia Erivo had the honor of presenting an Honorary Oscar to choreographer and actor Debbie Allen, whom she affectionately calls, “Auntie.”\n\n\tAllen spotted Cruise in the audience and couldn’t resist a playful nod to his iconic “Risky Business” moment. “Honey,” she teased, “we loved when you slid out in those tightie-whities.” The crowd roared as Allen leaned into the nostalgia, reminding everyone why Cruise remains one of Hollywood’s most enduring showmen.\n\n\tThe Honorary Award, according to the Academy, is given “to honor extraordinary distinction in lifetime achievement, exceptional contributions to the state of motion picture arts and sciences, or outstanding service to the Academy.”\n\n\tThe Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, also an Oscar statuette, is awarded to “an individual in the motion picture arts and sciences whose humanitarian efforts have brought credit to the industry by promoting human welfare and contributing to rectifying inequities.”\n\n\tThe 2024 Governors Awards ceremony honored Quincy Jones (posthumously), the first Black producer to be nominated for best picture; legendary casting director Juliet Taylor; screenwriter and director Richard Curtis; and longtime James Bond producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli.\n\n\tAs usual, the un-televised ceremony delivered a mix of heartfelt speeches, star-studded reunions and candid moments that viewers at home will never see. Here are the 10 most memorable highlights from inside the room.\n\n\tAriana Grande Takes a Photo with EJAE, the Voice Behind “Golden”\n\n\tAriana Grande had one of the night’s most charming cross-generational interactions when she took a photo with EJAE, the singer behind “Golden,” the biggest hit of the year and a leading contender in the original song race. She also posed with singer-songwriter Aiyana-Lee, who sings and appears in Spike Lee’s “Highest 2 Lowest.” The exchange delighted nearby attendees — and showed how the Governors Awards uniquely blends music, film and rising talent.\n\t\n\n\tTom Cruise’s Honorary Oscar — and the Moment Sydney Sweeney Froze\n\n\tTwo-time best director winner Alejandro González Iñárritu presented Tom Cruise with his Honorary Oscar, calling him an “Amores Perros” superfan and praising him as “the embodiment of movies.” Iñárritu is directing Cruise in an as-yet-untitled Warner Bros. film slated for 2026.\n\n\tWatching Cruise at that moment, I couldn’t help but think of Paul Newman’s trajectory — when he received an Honorary Oscar and then won competitively the following year for “The Color of Money” (1986), which co-starred a young Cruise.\n\n\tEarlier, Sydney Sweeney experienced her own movie-star shockwave. When Cruise approached, she froze.\n\n\t“Have you ever met him?” I asked.\n\n\t“No, never,” she said.\n\n\t“Go say hi.”\n\n\t“I don’t even know what to say.”\n\n\tEarlier in the evening, Andra Day — a clear Cruise superfan — adjusted his undone button mid-conversation. The movie-star aura remains undefeated.\n\n\tWill Arnett Kicks Things Off, Andra Day Brings the House Down\n\n\tWill Arnett, star of Bradley Cooper’s third feature as a director, “Is This Thing On?,” set the tone with a loose, deadpan introduction: “You might know me from my storied film career — and the story is thanks to Bradley Cooper, he finally made a good one, huh?” Arnett then handed things over to co-star Andra Day, who performed a soulful cover of Dolly Parton’s “Jolene” immediately after Parton’s pre-recorded acceptance speech, earning huge applause from the room.\n\n\tAustin Butler Chats With Jacob Elordi and Walks With Josh O’Connor\n\n\tBetween greetings and photo ops, Austin Butler found himself playing unofficial usher. The “Elvis” actor appeared to point “Wake Up Dead Man” star Josh O’Connor to his seat before chatting with Jacob Elordi. The “Frankenstein” star also squeezed in conversations with Jennifer Lopez, there to support her film “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” and the cast of Cannes darling “Sentimental Value,” including Renate Reinsve, Elle Fanning and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas.\n\n\tTom Cruise’s Speech Leaves Wagner Moura Ready to Shoot\n\n\t“The Secret Agent” star Wagner Moura was deeply moved by Tom Cruise’s career reel and speech.“I really want to go make a movie right now,” he told me afterward, calling Cruise’s tribute “pure fuel.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Room So Star-Packed You Couldn’t Walk Straight\n\n\tAt one point, I found myself surrounded by Leonardo DiCaprio, Regina Hall, Benicio Del Toro, Jennifer Lopez, Ted Sarandos, Hailee Steinfeld, Rian Johnson, Mark Hamill, Sydney Sweeney — and Cruise himself. Navigating the room became an Olympic sport but what a room to be in.\n\n\tLily Tomlin’s Wild and Wonderful Dolly Parton Tribute\n\n\tComedy legend Lily Tomlin received a standing ovation before launching into a hilariously meandering, heavily improvised 15-minute introduction for Dolly Parton. After sharing that she has double-vision issues, she reminisced about pajama-party sleepovers with Jane Fonda and Parton while making their 1980 comedy classic “9 to 5,” joking, “Can you picture Brando inviting Pacino and Duvall over for a sleepover?”\n\n\tHalfway through, producers tried to roll Parton’s pre-taped speech — prompting Tomlin to pause and ask whether she was being gently nudged offstage.\n\n\tAn “Uncut Gems” Reunion\n\n\tAdam Sandler caught up with his “Uncut Gems” directors Benny and Josh Safdie, who were supporting their respective new films as individual directors: “The Smashing Machine” and “Marty Supreme.” The moment prompted a flurry of table-hopping from filmmakers eager to greet them.\n\n\tLooking Forward to “Project Hail Mary”\n\n\tPhil Lord and Christopher Miller don’t have a movie this year, and were at the Governors Awards as guests. Still, they teased scarce details of their Ryan Gosling sci-fi adventure, “Project Hail Mary,” set for release in March. “Ryan is very emotional in it. Surprisingly emotional,” Miller said. Rumors have been making their way around the town that the film is excellent, but the pair aren’t “picture locked” yet.\n\n\tA Menu for the Stars\n\n\tGuests dined on smoked salmon Oscar matzahs; aged Parmesan; beet and truffle mushroom hummus; avocado purée with house-made lavosh; steak frites with roasted filet mignon; Café de Paris butter; French fries; and roasted Brussels sprouts. Dessert featured an espresso chocolate bonbon, raspberry linzer cookie and caramelized lemon tart, paired with La Clarté de Haut-Brion 2021, Le Clarence de Haut-Brion 2015 and Champagne Lallier R.021.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTom Cruise was presented with an Academy Honorary Award during the Nov. 16 Governors Awards, and it’s no surprise that the larger-than-life movie star had a blockbuster acceptance speech.\n\n\tThe award was presented by Alejandro G. Iñárritu, who is directing Cruise in an upcoming, as-yet-untitled film set to be released in Oct. 2026.\n\n\tUpon accepting the award, Cruise gave an emotional speech paying tribute to all of the people who make films possible, as well as the unifying power of cinema.\n\t\n\n\t“The cinema, it takes me around the world,” Cruise said. “It helps me to appreciate and respect differences. It shows me also our shared humanity, how alike we are in so, so many ways. And no matter where we come from, in that theater, we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together, and that is the power of this art form. And that is why it matters, that is why it matters to me. So making films is not what I do, it is who I am.”\n\n\n\tCruise also spoke about the genesis of his film fandom.\n\n\t“My love for cinema began at a very early age, as early as I can remember,” he said. “I was just a little kid in a darkened theater, and I remember that beam of light just cut across the room, and I remember looking up, and it seemed to be just exploded on the screen. Suddenly, the world was so much larger than the one that I knew. And entire cultures and lives and landscapes all unfolded in front of me, and it sparked something. It sparked a hunger for adventure, a hunger for knowledge, a hunger to understand humanity, to create characters, to tell a story, to see the world. It opened my eyes. It opened my imagination to the possibility that life could expand far beyond the boundaries that I then perceived in my own life. And that beam of light opened a desire to open the world, and I have been following it ever since.”\n\t\n\n\tCruise has been nominated for four Oscars in the past: Best actor for “Born on the Fourth of July” and “Jerry Maguire,” best supporting actor for “Magnolia” and best picture for his role as a producer on “Top Gun: Maverick.”\n\n\tEarlier in the ceremony, Cynthia Erivo presented choreographer Debbie Allen with an honorary Oscar. Production designer Wynn Thomas also received a statue celebrating his lifetime of work. The Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award was presented to Dolly Parton, who wasn’t able to attend the show in person because of health concerns, so she sent a pre-taped speech.\n\n\tThe Governors Awards red carpet drew scores of actors eager to join the awards season race this year, including Jennifer Lawrence, Michael B. Jordan, Sydney Sweeney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Dwayne Johnson, Emma Stone and many more.\n\n\tWatch some of Cruise’s speech below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tWalton Goggins has played complex characters in series including “The Shield” and “Justified.” Now he’s hoping his latest nuanced performance will help an unexpected beneficiary: Walmart.\n\n\tGoggins is taking up the role of The Grinch once more in a bid to call attention to the retailing giant’s plans for Black Friday. New deals will be available November 25 through 30, with Cyber Monday promotions dropping December 1. Goggins has appeared in Walmart ads since June, and says the decision to tackle The Grinch during holiday season was not one he made lightly.\n\t\n\n\t“When they brought up this idea to me, I just howled,” the actor confesses during a recent interview, noting that “my elation turned to anxiety, because the thing is The Grinch is one of the most beloved characters in literature. Dr. Seuss is literature and this is one of the most iconic characters in the world.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe actor says he carried around “The Grinch Who Stole Christmas” with him on various travels for several weeks, immersing himself in the story and the way the author described the character, who must overcome a strong desire to ruin the holiday season for a nearby village until he finds the holiday spirit of its citizens rests on caring and camaraderie, not gifts and commercialism.\n\n\tBut Goggins’ true recognition of the character did not come until he was fully adorned in the prosthetics he would wear for the commercial shoot. “It took me a two and a half, three hour process of getting made up for the first time, and we just kind of found it,” he recalls. “Once we settled on the face and waht it was, and we got that prostethic over my nose and my mouth, I asked if I could be alone. My grin told me who wanted to be.” He began to see The Grinch as someone who is “just irritated, slightly annoyed,” and he sent an image of himself to his wife, who added that she saw the character as someone she could hang out with, despite his inherent feeling of being annoyed. \n\t\n\n\tWalmart has in recent years tried to capture attention for Black Friday and holiday shopping by evoking famous movies or TV shows. The company has launched campaigns that reunite actors from the hit “Mean Girls” or the cult favorite “Office Space.” Last year, it debuted a ten-part “series” of commercials that talked up great bargains available at its stores, tapping actors including Taye Diggs, Lisa Rinna, Ian Somerhalder, Anthony Ramos, Chad Michael Murray Jake Shane and Goggins to take part in vignettes meant to remind viewers of video favorites such as “Bridgerton,” “Yellowstone,” “Friday Night Lights” or “Vampire Diaries.”\n\n\tBut the true stars of the campaigns are the deals. Walmart intends to unveil a 10-in-1 game table set available for $149.99 compared with its original price of $381.99; a Flashforge Adventurer 3D printer that sells for $229 rather than $799; and an iHome towel warmer that is listed for $34.24\n\n\tGoggins has increasingly been doing more work for big advertisers, including GoDaddy and PepsiCo’s Doritos. At an earlier point in his career, the actor says, he was “fearful” about taking part in ads. Over time, he says he has learned that he can add his own twist to the project — something he discovered after a conversation with actor Samuel L. Jackson, who has done work for Capital One, Adidas and the energy company Vattenfall. \n\n\tJackson told Goggins that when it came to commercial work, he would “stand in front of a mirror” and figure out how he might deliver the message in his own unique way. And that is “my strength,” says Goggins, “not to play into somebody else’s idea of the way in which they communicate with the public, but the way that I would do it.\n\n\tWould Goggins like to play the character again, if Walmart needs him? “I had such a good time playing him I didn’t want ti to end,” he says, but such a decision “is way above my pay grade.”\n\n\tY\n",

    "body": "\n\tAranya Sahay’s feature “Humans in the Loop” has received the Film Independent Sloan Distribution Grant as the film officially qualifies for Academy Awards consideration.\n\n\tThe grant, administered by Film Independent and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, supports narrative features that engage meaningfully with science or technology themes, providing strategic release support to help films reach wider audiences. The Sloan Film program has backed more than 850 screenplays, short films and features over the past two decades, including “The Imitation Game,” “Hidden Figures,” “The Man Who Knew Infinity” and “Oppenheimer.” The award makes Sahay and producer Mathivanan Rajendran Film Independent Fellows.\n\t\n\n\t“Humans in the Loop” follows an Indigenous woman working at a rural data-annotation center in India. The film examines the ethics and inequities of machine learning while foregrounding empathy, lived experience and cultural knowledge.\n\n\n\t“We are at a cusp with artificial intelligence, and humanity needs to take responsibility for the kind of AI and the kind of future we are building,” said Sahay. “I’m deeply grateful to Film Independent and the Sloan Foundation for allowing us to take this conversation across the U.S. ‘Humans in the Loop’ is about the human heartbeat inside technology, and this grant recognizes the people whose labor and stories often remain unseen.”\n\n\tRajendran added that through the film and their work at the Museum of Imagined Futures, they’ve been creating space for technologists and creatives to rethink how stories about technology are told. “The Sloan Foundation’s support and now the film’s entry into the Oscar race are a validation of Aranya’s screenplay that creatives can help shape the future of tech,” he said.\n\t\n\n\t“We are proud to help bring awareness in the U.S. about ‘Humans in the Loop’ through the Sloan Distribution Grant,” said Dea Vazquez, associate director of fiction programs at Film Independent. “The film’s rigorous and deeply human approach to exploring AI and the role of technology in our lives perfectly reflects the mission of the grant.”\n\n\tEarlier this month, the producers brought on Misaq Kazimi as executive producer to lead the film’s U.S. distribution strategy, which the grant will support further. “It is no surprise that ‘Humans in the Loop’ has received this prestigious grant from a preeminent U.S. film institution, as the film is both timely and relevant globally,” said Kazimi. “We have already begun our impact screenings, hosting a weeklong theatrical showcase in Los Angeles and at UCLA, bringing together filmmakers, academia and technologists to have interconnected discourse on the film’s pivotal question of how AI is handled by humanity.”\n\n\tFollowing its U.S. theatrical release and meeting other eligibility criteria, “Humans in the Loop” has officially qualified to be a contender for the 98th Academy Awards, where it will compete in the best original screenplay category.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJohn Oliver tackled the Trump Administration’s defunding of public media for his final “Last Week Tonight” episode of 2025, detailing how the decision to eliminate $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting earlier this year has severely impacted radio and TV stations, particularly in rural areas. So Oliver and “Last Week Tonight” are doing their part to help: The show has launched an auction website, John Oliver’s Junk, where 65 items are currently up for bid — including an original 1987 painting by late PBS icon Bob Ross, “Cabin at Sunset,” which at press time was fetching $51,000.\n\t\n\n\tThe idea for the auction actually came from the Bob Ross estate, which recently sold three Ross original paintings at auction to support public broadcasting, raising $662,000.\n\n\n\tOliver announced the “John Oliver’s Junk” auction on Sunday’s show, and said the auction would continue through Nov. 24. “We’ve actually accumulated a bunch of weird artifacts on this show over the years that we could definitely auction off to raise some much needed money,” Oliver said. “I am proud to announce last week tonight’s first ever auction in aid of public media. This is real!” Proceeds go to the Public Media Bridge Fund, which is assisting local public broadcasters in temporarily finding new funds in the wake of the CPB closure.\n\n\tRELATED: PBS CEO Reveals Plan to Save Stations and Programming After Trump Killed Funding, Admits There’s No ‘White Knight That Will Save Us’\n\n\tFans of “Last Week Tonight” will recognize several of the items being auctioned: Among them, Russell Crowe’s jock strap (“worn by Russell Crowe in the major motion picture Cinderella Man and later purchased by ‘Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,’ during season 5 of the show, as part of Crowe’s ‘Art of Divorce; auction in which Crowe sold his personal belongings to pay for his divorce”), and “Mrs. Cabbage Oliver” (“John Oliver’s on-screen wife, married during an on-screen wedding officiated by Steve Buscemi. Part of ‘Last Week Tonight’s’ season 9 segment on AI-generated art in which John marries a cabbage in the studio”).\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAlso: A large, gold-plated re-creation of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s balls (“Sculpture of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s scrotum, part of the season 12 segment on presidential libraries”), five wax Presidents of the United States, golden Adidas sneakers (“Gold sneakers John Oliver promised to wear in a season 2 episode of ‘Last Week Tonight with John Oliver’ if scandal-ridden FIFA President Sepp Blatter stepped down”).\n\n\tAmong other items: A trip to New York to meet Oliver; “a case of Cabernet SauvignJohn, a wine years in the making by ‘Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,'” and a chance to appear in a photo over Oliver’s shoulder during an episode — along with two VIP tickets to a live taping of the show.\n\n\tOliver’s “Community” colleague Joel McHale also appeared in the episode, which featured a flashback to when McHale hosted a pledge drive for Seattle’s PBS station in 1999 — and couldn’t stop talking about “Mr. Bean.” To commemorate that, McHale has signed a DVD set of “Mr. Bean” episodes, which is also being auctioned.\n\n\tOliver spent much of Sunday’s episode discussing public broadcasting’s predicament: “Public media has been truly innovative in reaching underserved audiences. It was public TV station that first invented closed captioning in the 1970s. Stations around the country offer programming in Haitian, Creole, Navajo, Vietnamese and many other languages. But as you undoubtedly know, it is now facing a serious threat, as over the summer, Congress decided to eliminate $1.1 billion that have been allocated to fund public broadcasting for the next two years.”\n\n\tOliver took on how Republicans have attacked public media since almost the moment that President Johnson first signed the law putting the CPB into existence, and he explained how criticism of a “liberal bias” inside public media is really about something else: “there can be a good faith debate over bias in the media, liberal or otherwise, but I’ll point out that a lot of the time, what conservatives claim as ‘liberal bias’ is often just things like showing there’s a long history of racism in America, or that gay people exist — making it hard to interpret those criticisms as anything other than bigotry. And yet, arguments like those just got used to justify zeroing out the entire budget of the CPB.”\n\t\n\n\tOliver also noted the irony that by cutting budgets, local stations will now have to rely more on national content coming out of major markets like New York, instead of producing vital local community programming. “The irony is, the more local stations budgets are slashed, the more they may come to rely on programming produced in those urban echo chambers. As the executive director of a station in California said, the local stuff that’s so important to people is probably the stuff that will go away.”\n\n\tOliver noted that public radio and TV stations have been behind vital local investigative reporting in areas where there are few other media outlets. And “Last Week Tonight” has relied on public reporting for pieces it has done on subjects such as HOAs, juvenile justice and lethal injection.\n\n\t“Public Media can be how critical information gets disseminated in communities with limited broadband or cell service,” he said. “Public Radio may be the only way to distribute missing and endangered persons alerts. It can also be crucial during an emergency like a hurricane.\n\n\t“Frankly, it’s always been a bit weird how little we fund public media, given how vital it can be. Here in the U.S., public media is a global outlier in how little federal funding it receives. Even before these cuts, federal spending amounted to less than $1.60 per capita — compared to countries like Norway, Sweden and the UK, which devote nearly $100 or more,” he added. “And research shows a positive correlation between the strength of public media systems and the health of democracies…. We’d ideally work on a long term fix for the way the CPB is funded. And instead of giving Congress the power to take its money away every two years, we’d institute some kind of tax or licensing fee that could reliably fund it. That is something people have been recommending since the CPB was first created. Sadly, we do not live in that universe right now and until we do, public media is in a dire situation now.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndian digital star and actor Anushka Sen is expanding her creative portfolio with her first foray into music, with debut single “Chameleon.”\n\n\tThe pop track pairs Sen’s vocal debut with the production expertise of Ken Lewis, a two-time Grammy Award winner and eight-time nominee whose credits include work with Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West. Lewis has contributed to 79 Billboard No. 1 hits throughout his career.\n\n\n\tSen commands a substantial social media presence with nearly 40 million followers across platforms. The 21-year-old began her entertainment career as a child actor on Indian television before transitioning to digital content creation. In 2024, she made her streaming debut in Prime Video’s coming-of-age series “Dil Dosti Dilemma,” earning praise for her performance in the original production.\n\t\n\n\tThe single was recorded during a recent trip to the U.S., with Lewis crafting what’s described as a pop anthem reflecting Sen’s artistic evolution. The track explores themes of transformation and self-definition, drawing on Sen’s background in music, which she studied from childhood under her mother’s guidance.\n\n\t“Music has always been a part of my life, but I never imagined I’d have the courage to actually create something of my own and share it with the world,” Sen said. “‘Chameleon’ was born out of a very personal space – it’s about evolution, identity, and not letting the world define you.”\n\n\tShe continued: “I’ve always been someone who likes doing things differently, whether it’s my work or the choices I make. People often expect you to stay in one lane, to keep doing what you’re known for, but I’ve for one never believed in that.”\n\t\n\n\tThe artist cited her Bengali heritage as an influence on her multidisciplinary approach to creativity, encompassing dance, music and acting. “Being a Bengali it’s been super inspiring for me to be able to immerse myself in different forms of art,” she said. “Through this new journey I’ll be able to learn and be able to merge everything and create something new.”\n\n\t“Chameleon” will be available worldwide on Nov. 18, with an audio version releasing first.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Jimmy Kimmel Live” bandleader Cleto Escobedo III, who died last week at 59, was honored on Sunday night during the opening credits of “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver“: A photo of Escobedo, with his saxophone, was spotted under the word “maestro.” \n\n\tOliver and team frequently use the last image in their credits before cutting to the host behind his desk to honor a newsmaker from the previous week — and given the tight camaraderie that exists among the late night shows, it’s probably no surprise that “Last Week Tonight” would want to recognize a fallen colleague. \n\t\n\n\tKimmel announced Escobedo’s passing on Tuesday via an Instagram post, and on that night’s episode, he shared the news and some of his memories of his childhood best friend. “To say that we are heartbroken is an understatement,” Kimmel wrote in his Tuesday post. “Cleto and I have been inseparable since I was 9 years old. The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto’s wife, children and parents in your prayers.”\n\n\n\tOn Friday, Kimmel announced that he and the show had launched fundraisers for UCLA Medical Center and Las Vegas’ Animal Foundation in memory of Escobedo. “Cleto was always kind and eager to help others. As we mourn his loss, we have started two fundraisers to celebrate his life and give back. The first is for UCLA Medical Center where he received such incredible care. Together we can help vulnerable patients and families in need of financial assistance during hard times. And to honor his love of animals, the The Animal Foundation in our hometown of Las Vegas.”\n\t\n\n\tThe UCLA Medical Center fundraiser noted, “In memory of our friend Cleto, we’d like to thank all the hardworking specialists, doctors, and nurses at UCLA. They worked tirelessly and generously to give him the best care. Cleto was always kind and eager to help others. To honor his generous spirit, we’d like to help vulnerable patients and families in need of financial assistance during hard times. Let’s help others in Cleto’s name.”\n\n\tAnd at The Animal Foundation, the fundraiser noted, “Cleto was a beloved friend, father, and animal lover whose heart was always open to pets in need. His family shares this message: ‘Cleto was a  compassionate animal lover. He loved each of his rescue dogs like they were family. Please consider making a donation to The Animal Foundation in his hometown of Las Vegas. Cleto would have loved his friends and family helping to provide safety, healing and homes for pets in need.’ In honor of Cleto’s lifelong love for animals, gifts made through this page will support The Animal Foundation’s work to save and care for vulnerable pets right here in Las Vegas.”\n\n\tAccording to People magazine, which credited TMZ with first receiving Escobedo’s death certificate, “cardiogenic shock is listed as the immediate cause of death. Vasodilatory shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation and alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver are listed as underlying causes.” \n\n\tEscobedo played the alto, tenor and soprano saxophones and also sang as part of the Cleto and the Cletones house band. Outside of performing on Kimmel’s show, Escobedo toured with Paula Abdul, Marc Anthony and Earth, Wind & Fire’s Phillip Bailey.\n\n\tWhen Kimmel launched “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on ABC in 2003, he asked Escobedo to lead the house band. “I always thank him for this gig because he could have tried to get somebody that was established and would help the show more, being a bigger name or whatever,” Escobedo told ABC7 in a 2013 interview. “But he trusted me with this job, and I’ve tried to do the best I can.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle” powered China’s box office over the Nov. 14–16 frame, debuting with RMB354.2 million ($49.9 million), according to Artisan Gateway.\n\n\tThe Aniplex release, directed by Sotozaki Haruo and produced by ufotable, adapts the climactic final arc of Gotouge Koyoharu’s blockbuster manga. Returning voice cast members include Hanae Natsuki, Kitō Akari, Shimono Hiro, and Matsuoka Yoshitsugu. The film follows the Demon Slayer Corps’ all-out assault on Kibutsuji Muzan’s stronghold in a bid to end the war between humans and demons. \n\t\n\n\tAfter its first three days, it has reached $52.5 million, of which Imax accounted for $12.3 million. \n\n\n\tLionsgate’s “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” bowed in second place with $21.6 million. \n\n\tLocal crime drama “Family at Large,” released by Hehe Pictures, opened in third with $1.9 million. Directed by Kang Bo, the film stars Hu Ge as an estranged father nicknamed Reindeer who is drawn into a gruelling human-trafficking run on China’s northeastern border, escorting a young pregnant woman and a boy who has previously been kidnapped. The cast also includes Wen Qi, Yan Ni, Song Jia, Gao Ye and Ou Hao.  \n\n\t“Predator: Badlands” placed fourth with $1.8 million, lifting its total to $12.6 million.\n\n\tShanghai Film Group’s “Shanghai Wonton” rounded out the top five with a $900,000 weekend and a cumulative $1.7 million. Directed by Wu Tiange, the film follows Wang, a retired engineer who cooks wontons every Saturday while worrying about his unmarried son. He heads to the city’s park dating corner to look for a match and falls in with a group of parents in similar situations. The ensemble cast includes Zhou Yemang, Pan Hong, Mao Shanyu, Wang Lin, Chen Guoqing and Xu Xiang.  \n\t\n\n\tWeekend box office surged to $79.7 million – compared to a couple of dismal $21 million frames – bringing China’s 2025 total to $6.41 billion, up 16% year-on-year.\n",

While beloved by some, “Chess” is a famously messy musical, particularly due to Rice’s confused book, which has been reworked too many times to count. Songs have been moved, added, cut, or reassigned. Settings (both locations and years) have been altered. Characters have been expanded, removed, or significantly tweaked. The ending (particularly for Florence) has gone through numerous versions, each with completely different meanings and messages. Even seemingly core and essential details, like who wins the chess matches, have been changed across productions. \n\t\n\n\tThis revival represents director Michael Mayer and Strong’s third stab at the material, having previously worked on it in 2018 and 2022. Among Strong’s larger changes is altering the timeline and providing some wider historical context, setting the first act amidst the SALT II treaty negotiations and the second act culminating with the Abel Archer 83 military exercises. In theory, this should work, and in the first act, it basically does. The second act premise, though, goes off the rails: the various shifting allegiances become convoluted and the idea that the US and USSR were ready to blow each other up with nuclear weapons based on the outcome of a chess match is absurd. The stakes are unnaturally high, with a countdown to world destruction — but then nothing happens. No bombing occurs. What’s more, the book has been pored over, snipped, and revised so often that there remain remnants of earlier versions, such as lines referencing moments that have been cut or motifs that never get resolved. \n\t\n\n\tRegardless of the version, there is a compelling human drama at the center of “Chess,” floating atop some killer songs and an often gorgeous score. In its sweeping musical moments (“Nobody’s Side,” “Anthem,” “I Know Him So Well,” “Someone Else’s Story,” and the catchy but dated “One Night in Bangkok”), it’s easy to see why “Chess” has diehard fans. However, there’s so much else that brings everything down: clunky plotting, nonsensical character motivations, and, here, a useless ensemble. Mayer has the chorus thrash about in a mob and sit onstage all of act one, but then completely forgets about them for act two. We might have been better off without these useless pawns. \n\n\tAs soon as the overture begins, this revival feels less like a Broadway production and more like City Center Encores! concert. The cast is stacked but there’s no set to speak of, beyond some stairs that house the onstage orchestra, a row of banquet benches, and several columns filled with lawn chess pieces. The back wall features some very on-the-nose projections, including the domes of St. Basil’s in Moscow, American and Soviet flags, and an oft-repeated photo of a child being hoisted over a wall. The costumes are entirely nondescript, with the leads in black and white, and the chorus in grey double-breasted suits. The lighting design is occasionally effective, other than several strips of thin, chintzy LED light strips that rotate between blue and red. \n\n\tThe production seems to have no faith that the audience will remember this is a Cold War musical, so it constantly reminds us in the projections, lighting, and in the speeches of the character known as the Arbiter (played by Bryce Pinkham). As our narrator, the Arbiter here is an annoyingly metatheatrical figure, who quips to the audience, praising Michele’s singing, apologizing for Tveit’s character’s last name sounding like Trump (“remember this show was originally written in 1984”), constantly referencing the fact that we’re watching a musical, and making cringy attempts at topical jokes about RFK Jr.’s brain worm and Joe Biden’s decision to run for re-election. Pinkham comes across as pesky and tiresome, though this is mostly the fault of Mayer’s direction and Strong’s writing. \n\t\n\n\tDespite this revival of “Chess” making some wrong moves, it always remembers that the queen is the most powerful piece, wisely letting Michele shine like the star she is. Unlike in “Funny Girl,” in which she was perpetually the center of attention, here she has to share the stage more, and does so with humility and aplomb. Never overpowering or scene stealing, Michele has a commanding presence, and finds the depths of pain, longing, and conflict in her character. She is an undeniable grandmaster, with the rare combination of perfect technique, clarion tone, vocal power, and exemplary emoting skills. This performance solidifies that Michele is back on Broadway, hopefully for a long time — and we are certainly lucky to have her. Her rendition of “Nobody’s Side” is so superb it will make you wish we still had encores on Broadway. \n\n\tTveit is as talented as always, and his hair is as mesmerizingly coiffed, but sadly he doesn’t have much to do, especially in the second act. His voice is intoxicating and he’s clearly having fun with the role, but as the show progresses, his presence becomes superfluous, with Strong relying on increasingly unrealistic reasons to keep him around. Freddie is not well developed or nuanced, flipping between asshole antics and depressive paranoia. Tveit tries his best, but he fades a bit compared to Michele and Chrisopher. \n\n\tOf our three leads, Christopher may be the only non-household name, but he gives an impressive performance. He captures the cynical and suicidal pain of Anatoly, a child chess prodigy ripped from his family and turned into a Soviet robot, who now must confront what he wants in life, if he can love, and how he feels about his mother country. Christopher’s singing is quite powerful, too, especially his “Anthem,” but his key achievement is proving that acting and character work are vital to nailing this role.  \n\n\tSean Allan Krill as Walter, the CIA operative, and Bradley Dean as Molokov, the KGB chess mentor, serviceably represent feuding factions and come off as equally slimy. Rounding out the principal cast is the usually lovely Hannah Cruz as Svetlana (Anatoly’s wife) in a rare misstep. Despite using a Russian accent in her dialogue, she makes no attempt to sing with it, a confounding and distracting choice (made especially stark because Dean and Christopher expertly speak and sing with Russian accents). \n\t\n\n\tFor a musical about chess, this revival ironically doesn’t seem very interested in the game itself. This production has two chess matches, and in both the players stand at microphones narrating their moves in monotone voices (“Pawn to E6,” “Knight to F3”), thus rendering the matches in an entirely nontheatrical and nonvisual manner. For those unfamiliar with chess or unable to imagine the board, pieces, and moves in their head, the crucial matches are impossible to follow. Mayer and Strong seem exclusively invested in the symbolism of the Cold War as a chess battle, so they don’t let us see and understand the contours of the actual chess matches. \n\n\tAlas, the debate of whether “Chess” can be saved or fixed must continue, for this is likely not the best iteration of the material. What Florence sings rings true for “Chess” overall: “I’ve still a lot to prove; there must be more I could achieve.” There’s so much potential, it’s hard not to continually yearn for a version of “Chess” that fully works. \n\n\tAlthough this “Chess” match may not have produced a new champion, there’s still some thrilling gameplay, especially from Michele and Christopher, who help provide insight into the magic of “Chess” and make this sometimes uneven game still feel entirely worth watching. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTom Cruise Accepts Honorary Oscar: ‘Making Films Is Not What I Do, It Is Who I Am’\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMeet Strangelove, the Cult-Favorite Fragrance House Powered by Oud\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder Armour’s CEO Just Did the Thing He ‘Couldn’t Imagine’\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

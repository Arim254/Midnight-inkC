    "body": "\n\tOver the course of about two hours, Michael B. Jordan relived his 25 years as an actor.\n\n\t“Nobody warns you how crazy this is to see your whole career flash before your eyes,” Jordan said, wiping tears away as he accepted the 39th American Cinematheque Award from his longtime collaborator Ryan Coogler on Thursday night. \n\n\tIt had been an emotional day for Jordan, who spent the morning saluting his friend, the late Chadwick Boseman. The “Black Panther” star, who died in 2020, received a posthumous star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame. Jordan also has a slice of real estate on that famed stretch of sidewalk — his star was unveiled in 2023 — so he’s well-aware of how poignant that moment can be. But as he listened to Coogler, Viola Davis and Boseman’s wife Simone Ledward-Boseman speak, Jordan tried to remain “even-keeled” amid all the emotion.\n\t\n\n\t“It made you reflect and think about time. The time that you have and what you do with that time,” Jordan told Variety on the red carpet at the Beverly Hilton. About the serendipity of the two events taking place just hours apart, he added: “I wouldn’t want to share this day, this moment, with anyone else. I’m actually so happy that it happened on the same day. I’ll never forget it.”\n\n\n\tThe American Cinematheque tribute chronicled Jordan’s achievements in cinema and television over the decades — from his earliest roles (think “The Wire,” “Friday Night Lights,” “All My Children” and his first movie, “Hardball”) to his breakthrough performance in Coogler’s indie drama “Fruitvale Station,” which established Jordan as a movie star to watch. Then came roles in box office blockbusters like “Black Panther” and three “Creed” movies — plus he directed “Creed III” — culminating with this year’s massive hit “Sinners.” Next, Jordan directs, produces and stars in a new version of “The Thomas Crown Affair.”\n\t\n\n\t“As we’ve watched his career blossom and grow, each performance gets better and better. And when I first saw ‘Sinners,’ I said, ‘That’s the best work yet,'” his father, Michael A. Jordan, told Variety. \n\n\t“It wasn’t an overnight thing,” his mother, Donna Jordan, pointed out. “I’ve seen so much of what he did to put the work in. His work ethic is amazing, and I’m most proud of that.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichael B. Jordan poses on the red carpet with his mother Donna Jordan, sister Jamila Jordan-Theus, brother Khalid Jordan and father Michael A. Jordan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEarl Gibson III\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichael B. Jordan poses with Tessa Thompson and Ryan Coogler.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Sinners” breakout talent Miles Caton, Grammy winner Raphael Saadiq and Oscar winning composer Ludwig Göransson perform “I Lied to You,” an original song from the hit film.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBefore Jordan’s tribute, NBC Universal chief Donna Langley honored the Motion Picture Association’s Charles H. Rivkin with the Power of Cinema Award, presented by Hill Valley. Onstage, Rivkin, who was accompanied by his colleagues at the MPA and his son, Eli, cracked before the crowd of studio heads and industry executives: “Let’s face it, like the rest of us, myself included, they’re really here to see Michael B. Jordan.” \n\n\tIndeed, the A-list lineup of presenters confirmed that the entertainment industry loves Jordan. Ben Affleck kicked off the kudos by sharing how, after watching “Fruitvale Station,” he’d reached out to the young actor to offer advice about navigating a rapidly accelerating career. \n\n\t“In retrospect, it’s clear to me those conversations were much more valuable to me,” Affleck admitted. The Oscar winner also ribbed Jordan’s parents about giving him that name when the other Michael Jordan was already on his way to a legendary basketball career. “This was not an exercise with low expectations,” he quipped, but Jordan has lived up to the moniker.\n\n\tThe parade of Oscar winners continued with Mahershala Ali, who introduced a clip package from Jordan’s first works: “A time before Michael was a multi-hyphenate actor, producer, director; before he became one of the most sought-after leading men and bachelors of Hollywood, a time we all affectionately refer to as the ’90s,” he cracked. \n\n\tThen, Octavia Spencer recalled playing Jordan’s mother in “Fruitvale Station” and how, when the film ran into financing issues, she became an executive producer on the project. “When you take an inspired and culturally important script and you add a supreme talent like Michael, who I always say is a brilliant character actor with a beautiful, leading man’s face, you make more than a lasting impression; you make a movie that withstands the test of time,” she said.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBen Affleck and Octavia Spencer speak onstage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Kaluuya presents onstage. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDaniel Kaluuya (“Black Panther”) described Jordan as “a human torch in real life,” sharing that before they were co-stars in the MCU, he and his friends had seen a billboard of Jordan in “Fantastic Four” and been further inspired to chase their dreams. “He’s Johnny fucking Storm.” That moment, Kaluuya said, solidified that “Michael’s reach, influence and impact,” and that he was “global before he was given permission.”\n\n\tFor the “Creed” section of the program, Irwin Winkler, who produces the “Rocky” franchise, and Jordan’s co-stars Phylicia Rashad and Tessa Thompson took the stage. Rashad praised Jordan for his “impeccable” artistry, while Thompson reflected on playing soulmates onscreen for a decade. \n\n\t“I know my work husband extremely well,” she quipped. “I have watched my workplace spouse evolve immensely and grow tremendously, but at the same time, not change one bit.” Meanwhile, “Sinners” actor Delroy Lindo, Jordan’s most recent co-star on the bill, said that the evening helped him get a better sense of the “breadth and depth” of his brilliance, genius and impact.\n\n\tBradley Cooper, who received the American Cinematheque tribute in 2018, lamented the fact that he’s yet to work with Jordan. “Not a movie, not a show, never made a TikTok, nothing,” he cracked. “I’m simply a dedicated fan who has now, I’ve been miraculously upgraded to a friend.” \n\n\tAngela Bassett — who played Queen Ramonda, Jordan’s “auntie,” in “Black Panther” — and Tom Cruise — who, like Cooper, is simply a longtime fan — also appeared via video messages.\n\n\t“The first time I saw your work, it was immediately clear to me what a tremendous, tremendous talent you are, and I’ve been watching your career grow over these many years,” Cruise said in the clip. “I admire your talent, your dedication, your constant willingness to learn and push the boundaries of storytelling. You’ve brought to life so many authentic, memorable characters — always with such depth and always in service of the story.” And by taking on dual roles in “Sinners,” Cruise continued, Jordan “validated the magic of the big screen experience.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBradley Cooper points to Jordan in the audience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPhylicia Rashad speaks onstage. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTom Cruise praised Jordan in a pre-recorded message.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCoogler was the final presenter of the evening. “I’m really upset because I’ve never had to follow up that many incredible actors before,” he said, joking that all the other presenters used all the best anecdotes about Jordan. “It made my speech kinda worthless.”  \n\t\n\n\tBut Coogler did his best to sum up their 13 years of partnership, friendship and brotherhood, regardless, by focusing on Jordan’s incredible dedication to the craft of acting. Coogler detailed how Jordan transformed physically and dove deep into character work for each of their collaborations, with “Sinners” as his heaviest lift to date.\n\n\t“I don’t think there’s any other actor in the world who might’ve pulled that off,” Coogler said about the more intricate aspects of playing two characters in the same shot. “He makes these things look so easy; he often gets overlooked.”\n\n\tCoogler shared the story of their first coffee meeting as he pitched Jordan on “Fruitvale Station.” To him, it was obvious that Jordan was a movie star in the making. “I said, ‘Hey, man, I think you’re a star. Let’s do this project together and show the world,’ he recalled. “And this dude looked back at me like it was the first time somebody told him that.” (“It was,” Jordan yelled out from his table in the center of the ballroom.) \n\n\tAt the Sundance premiere of “Fruitvale Station,” Coogler said Oscar Grant’s family watched the film for the first time and his uncle’s review was poignant: “I felt I saw my nephew for an hour and a half,” he’d said. \n\n\t“That’s the power of Mike when he’s in his bag. Doing his first love,” Coogler said. “He has a power to make magic. He has a power to get to the truth. That all of our humanity is real, that all these constructs that we make — race, identity, citizenship — though deadly, though powerful, are just constructs. Mike shines through that.”\n\n\tThen, Coogler invited Jordan to the stage; the audience saluted the actor with an impressively long standing ovation, giving him time to wipe the tears from his eyes and regain his composure.\n\n\t“That reel keeps playing back in my head,” Jordan said. “It’s inspiring, because now I want to go do something else. I’m like ‘What’s next?’ For anybody that knows me, I’ve got an idea. I come with ideas.”\n\n\tAs Jordan looked around the room, full of people who’d witnessed different parts of his journey, he said the event felt like the “ultimate homecoming.” Jordan thanked his family, co-stars, collaborators and various members of his team, but choked up when he looked to Coogler.\n\n\t“Finding a collaborator like him early in my career changed everything for me. Words cannot describe the impact you’ve had on me and my life,” he said after a long pause. (“My friends and family had a bet on how many times I was gonna cry tonight,” Jordan admitted.)\n\t\n\n\tTo conclude his speech, Jordan focused his remarks on the power of storytelling to be a light in heavy times. “It’s a blessing to wake up and do what we do every day for a living,” he said, then quoted author Toni Morrison. “‘If there’s a book you really want to read but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it.’ So, to the artist, plant your seeds, find your people, build with them. And to the people making decisions about what stories will be told: Be bold. Take the risk. These stories matter.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMahershala Ali and Michael B. Jordan on the red carpet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCharles Rivkin (center) smiles alongside Hill Valley’s Eric Nebot, American Cinematheque president Mark Badagliacca, Charles Rivkin, Cinematheque chair Rick Nicita and NBC Universal’s Donna Langley. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichael B.

    "body": "\n\tLena Dunham‘s Netflix series “Too Much” is done after one season at Netflix. \n\n\tAccording to an individual with knowledge of the situation, Dunham felt the story was complete after one season. The series had originally debuted at the streamer in July. Despite solid reviews, the show seems to have failed to find much of an audience, as it spent just one week on the Netflix Global Top 10 English language TV chart, though it did reach the Top 10 in 27 individual countries. \n\t\n\n\t“Too Much” starred Megan Stalter as Jessica, who, per the series’ official description, “is a New York workaholic in her mid-thirties, reeling from a broken relationship that she thought would last forever and slowly isolating everyone she knows. When every block in New York tells a story of her own bad behaviour, the only solution is to take a job in London, where she plans to live a life of solitude like a Bronte sister. But when she meets Felix (Will Sharpe) — a walking series of red flags — she finds that their unusual connection is impossible to ignore, even as it creates more problems than it solves.”\n\n\n\tAlong with Stalter and Sharpe, the cast of the series included: Richard E. Grant, Stephen Fry, Janicza Bravo, Andrew Rannells, Michael Zegen, Rhea Perlman, Rita Wilson, Leo Reich, Adele Exarchopoulos, Adwoa Aboah, Daisy Bevan, Dean-Charles Chapman, Kaori Momoi, Prasanna Puwanarajah, and Emily Ratajkowski. \n\n\tDunham co-created “Too Much” with her husband, Luis Felber, with their relationship inspiring the series. Dunham is also credited as writer, executive producer, and director. Felber is also an executive producer, while his band Attawalpa provided original music for the show. Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, Michael P. Cohen, Surian Fletcher-Jones, and Bruce Eric Kaplan also executive produced. Camilla Bray served as producer. The series hails from Universal International Studios’ Working Title Television as well as Dunham’s Good Thing Going banner.\n\t\n\n\tDunham remains in business with Netflix under the deal she and Good Thing Going struck with the streamer early this year. \n",

    "body": "\n\tGeorge Clooney had an enraptured London crowd in stitches Friday, taking comedic jabs at President Trump and Brad Pitt, while also sharing the devastating put-down he received from his son recently. Clooney, whose latest film “Jay Kelly” was released in theaters earlier this month, was in conversation with Scottish broadcaster Edith Bowman at the British Film Institute’s large theater on the south bank of the River Thames.\n\n\tLooking back at his first film with the Coen Brothers, “O Brother, Where Art Thou?,” he joked that “they like to make me out to be, you know, just a pure knucklehead in every film.” He recalled how nervous he felt when he shot his first scene, in which he gets the shit beaten out of him by John Goodman. “Joel came over and goes, ‘Yeah, that’s great. It’s just, you know, you’re not dumb. You’re the smartest guy in every room you walk into’ – which, of course, is what I should have thought of as an actor. I should have understood that dumb people don’t think they’re dumb. They think they’re smart. You know, we have a President to prove that.”\n\t\n\n\tDiscussing “Good Night, and Good Luck,” which he directed, co-wrote and acted in, he explained that he was prompted to make the film because of the Iraq War, which was “a pretty shameful moment in our history when the three branches of government – the judicial, the executive and the legislative branches – all failed in their job.”\n\n\n\tReminding the audience that he was “the son of a newsman,” he continued, “The Fourth Estate, meaning journalism, has the responsibility to question authority, has to, and when it doesn’t – it didn’t and it failed – we end up in a war in Iraq, a war of choice.”\n\t\n\n\tHe also mentioned the flak he received for criticizing the war. “And it’s funny too, by the way, they protested against me. There was only about five of us that came out at that point. People forget that. The government put me on a deck of cards, called it a deck of traitors. They picketed my movies, put me on TV shows, and all this shit, and those exact same people now they all talk about how bad that war was, so it’s like, ‘Fuck off.’”\n\n\tHe added, “So I wrote ‘Goodnight, Good Luck,’ because I wanted to talk about when journalism, when the Fourth Estate, stood up to a populist, stood up to a bad idea when it wasn’t convenient, and when it was difficult to do and when it mattered.”\n\n\tAlthough he didn’t play the lead role of Edward R. Murrow in the film, he did in a stage version on Broadway earlier this year. “It was fun to do it, and there was a different urgency to do the play this spring. It felt like we were talking about things now that, you know … the idea of telling the truth and speaking truth to power is more important than ever. Truth is more negotiable than ever.\n\n\t“There’s a line in this that Murrow said, this isn’t my writing, ‘We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. You must remember always that accusation is not proof, and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine and remember that we are not descended from fearful men, not from men who fear to write, to speak or to associate with people whose ideas for the moment are unpopular.’\n\n\t“It was important to say those words,” he said to warm applause from the London crowd.\n\n\tAt the end of the play, he said, “Murrow looks out at the audience and says, ‘What are you prepared to do?,’” and some in the New York audience, he said, shouted back, “Resist!” He added, “It’s an interesting thing to remember that each of us, each one of us, our voices, have to matter, and being silent is not an option.”\n\n\tAsked about the challenges of being a movie star, he mentioned that he had to watch what he said. “Every opportunity to have an interview or to have a conversation could result in the end of your career. You know, I’m not on Twitter or Instagram or any of that bullshit because … I drink. You know, 3 a.m., my Mother Teresa joke might not play so well when I wake up the next day.”\n\t\n\n\tHe added that his children keep him grounded. “My son, for Halloween, dresses up as Batman. He has no idea that I’m Batman. And I said, ‘You know, I was Batman,’ and he’s like, ‘Err … no.’ He has no idea how right he is.”\n\n\tClooney made repeated references to his age, 64. He joked that in the upcoming “Ocean’s 14,” starring Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts, “we are all in wheelchairs.’” He later added, “It is like, you know, all the things we used to be able to do that we can’t do anymore […] It’s gonna be like ‘The Golden Girls.’ […] So, we’re looking forward to that, and I’m not sure when we start that yet. It’s about getting the schedule going, and we also have to take all of the budget and give it to Brad, now that he’s had a hit. He’s hard to live with, you guys.”\n",

Glinda’s new song is “Girl in the Bubble,” while Elphaba sings “No Place Like Home.” The song title is a direct nod to Dorothy and “The Wizard of Oz,” who, in her quest to return to Kansas, repeats, “There’s no place like home,” while clicking her ruby-slippered heels.\n\n\tComposer John Powell’s score weaves in several musical callbacks to Act I. There’s a reprise of “What Is This Feeling?” with revised lyrics praising Glinda and her goodness, and Elphaba delivers a reimagined version of “The Wizard and I” that reflects her disappointment with the man she once admired. Throughout the film, additional musical changes appear, including new lyrics in “Wonderful” and an expanded version of the scene that now incorporates Glinda.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGown Inspirations\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tGlinda’s purple dress – which audiences first see in “Thank Goodness” – pays homage to both Billie Burke’s gown from the “Wizard of Oz” and Glinda’s finale dress in the Broadway musical. Costume designer Paul Tazewell took the silhouette from the 1939 film, designing a full, multilayered tulle and organza gown with crystal and glass beads. However, the color palette was inspired by the lavender-blue hues from Broadway’s Glinda. “That was a nod to honor that image,” Tazewell tells Variety.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tShattered Glass\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIn a callback to Part One, the first sign that Elphaba has come to see Glinda is the subtle cracking of Glinda’s window — just as it shattered when they quarrelled while sharing a dorm room. This time, though, the fracture is more controlled, reflecting how much mastery Elphaba has gained over her magic and signaling her arrival.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCamouflage\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIn another callback to the first film, Elphaba narrowly avoids being spotted by the royal guards by blending into the trees. Remember — when she first met Fiyero, he joked that he barely noticed her because she “blended in with the foliage.” In Part Two, that line comes full circle as she evades him and his guards by doing exactly that.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBlue Horse\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFiyero’s trusty steed is a blue horse — a subtle nod to the “Horse of a Different Color” from “The Wizard of Oz.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWestward Looking\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAll of Oz’s landmarks were strategically positioned to guide Elphaba’s journey from east to west, according to production designer Nathan Crowley. “She has to make a western journey, because she has to accept that she has to become the Wicked Witch of the West. She has to become the villain that Oz needs,” he tells Variety. So, the canopy where Elphaba fashions a hiding place faces west; then, by the end of the film, she reaches Kiamo Ko castle, completing her western arc.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBoq Foreshadowing\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tUniversal hinted at Boq’s future in the marketing. The character is framed by tin, teasing his transformation into the Tin Man. And the Munchkin wears an “M” embroidered over his heart, but the letter is filled in to form the shape of a heart, which he eventually loses when a spell goes wrong. During his first scene in “For Good,” audiences see Boq chopping wood in Nessarose’s chamber, foretelling what’s to come.\n\n\tBecause Boq’s transformation takes place in Nessarose’s mansion, “all the metal in the room attached to him,” explains Francis Hannon, the film’s head of makeup. “The handles of the jug were on his ears. His fingers were made from the salt and pepper pots.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSilver Slippers\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe iconic ruby red slippers never actually appear in the film. Due to a trademark issue with MGM, neither the movie nor the Broadway musical can use the famous red heels. Instead, filmmakers turned to the silver shoes originally described in “The Wizard of Oz” book, which is in the public domain. Their workaround? When Nessarose flies, cinematographer Alice Brooks uses red lighting instead — signaling to audiences that these are the beloved slippers we all know and love. “They get hotter and hotter, and that red became our most vibrant red,” Brooks says.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Wonderful Rainbow\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDuring their dance in “Wonderful” (now featuring Glinda), the Wizard’s palace is covered in rainbow-colored lights as a nod to Judy Garland’s iconic song, “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tA Peter Pan-Inspired Flight\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAs the ‘Wonderful’ number continues, Elphaba and Glinda levitate over the diorama of Oz. The filmmakers conceived the idea for the seated broomstick ride based on an idea director Jon M. Chu shared just before they flew to London to begin production. Chu shared photos with his team, explaining that he wanted the scene to play out similarly to the Peter Pan ride at Disneyland. \n\n\t“Jon wanted to build a ride, and we were three weeks away from shooting this scene. We only have Jeff Goldblum for four weeks to shoot all of movie one and two with him,” recalls cinematographer Alice Brooks. Chu was adamant he wanted a ride that could actually take off with its stars onboard; but the stage had already been built, so the team crafted a seated ride. \n\n\tThe scene also mimics “The Wizard and I,” Brooks notes: “We slowly dim on the pink light as they take flight on this ride, and Elphaba’s green skin disappears in pink light.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t‘Dancing Through Life’ Callback\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIn addition to soaring around the palace, Glinda and Elphaba also dance together, recreating the emotional moment where they became friends at the Ozdust Ballroom in the first film. They reprise their signature moves — a wrist to the forehead and the playful “chicken wing” arm gesture — reminding viewers of both the origins and strength of their friendship.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAnimal Covers\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIn the first film, Elphaba’s magical powers explode in the Shiz University courtyard, knocking an engraved portrait of the Wizard off the wall to reveal a painting of animals, symbolizing how Oz once functioned. In Part Two, the Wizard’s palace features another similar portrait on the wall. Prompted by the flying monkey, Chistery, Elphaba looks behind the artwork to uncover a secret room and finds that there are real animals trapped behind bars.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOff to See the Wizard\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIn one scene, Elphaba tells Glinda, “I’m off to see the Wizard,” which is a direct nod to “The Wizard of Oz” and Judy Garland’s Dorothy who sings, “We’re off to see the wizard.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAlice Fearn’s Return\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tEarly in the film, Glinda has a flashback to when she was a little girl performing magic tricks in front of her friends. Her parents make an appearance, with Alice Fearn returning as Glinda’s mom. Fearn played Elphaba in the West End production of “Wicked.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFlashback Rainbow\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWe got to meet young Elphie in Part One, and now in Part Two, we meet young Galinda. We see her at a party, where she tries — and fails — to perform a magic trick. But when a rainbow (alluding to “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”) appears outside and her friends ask if she made it, she confidently says yes.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWedding Scene\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe wedding is full of symbolic Easter eggs. First, the aisle runner of yellow butterflies represents the yellow brick road. There’s also the juxtaposition of Elphaba being underground, representing her journey into darkness and wickedness, while Glinda is above ground, celebrated among her peers.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFiyero Foreshadowing\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAfter betraying the Wizard’s guards and allowing Elphaba to escape, Fiyero meets his fate: he becomes the Scarecrow. On closer inspection, the clues to his future were there all along — from the poster, which shows the character surrounded by cornfields, to elements of his costume.\n\n\t“When you see him from the back, there’s a three-point pattern that’s created with the bullion … And that might be suggestive of something,” Tazewell tells Variety. In addition, the straw embroidery on this chest also hints toward this future. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRed Poppies Return\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tPoppies play a key role in “The Wizard of Oz,” with a field of them lulling Dorothy to sleep. Poppies also appear throughout “For Good,” including on the Wizard’s robe and on his desk, as a nod to the iconic, intoxicating flower.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGingham Curtains\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWhile Dorothy is not directly seen, nor does she have any lines, she appears in her all-too-familiar blue gingham dress. However, there’s another subtle nod to the character; the house that falls on Nessarose also features blue gingham curtains.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tToto on a Leash\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWhen Dorothy begins walking down the Yellow Brick Road, Elphaba notices Dorothy has Toto on a leash. This indicates that Dorothy is becoming an agent of the Wizard, and while she doesn’t have the pup in a cage, she, too, is an oppressor.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFighting Scene\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDuring “What Is This Feeling?” in Part One, the two witches clash during a combat class. Their fighting skills pay off later, when they reunite to battle following the death of the Wicked Witch of the East.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWitch Laugh\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAfter Glinda slaps Elphaba following their fight, Elphaba lets out a cackle — an homage to Margaret Hamilton’s iconic laugh from “The Wizard of Oz.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTiny Bubbles\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJust as Boq and Fiyero’s futures are embroidered and hinted at in their costumes, Glinda’s outfit also reflects her character development. She’s adorned with circles on her earrings, crown and dress, all mirroring the bubble she uses for transportation.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Wizard’s Exit  \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tWhen the Wizard is finally exposed and leaves Oz forever, he exits in the same way as the original “The Wizard of Oz” film — via hot air balloon.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEnding and Rainbow\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe final scene in Kiamo Ko echoes the opening scene of Part One, where the spilled water and abandoned hat mark the aftermath of the Wicked Witch’s “melting.” But as the camera pulls back to Munchkinland’s celebration of her demise, one last rainbow reference appears.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Grand Finale\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Wicked: For Good’s” final scene differs from the Broadway musical. On stage, Fiyero and Elphaba walk off together. However, the film ends with a flashback of Glinda and Elphaba when they were at Shiz; Glinda, wearing a white hood, whispers to Elphaba in a direct callback to the musical’s original poster.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOlivia Dean Blasts ‘Disgusting’ Ticketmaster, Live Nation and AEG Over Resale Ticket Prices\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRefinement and Serenity on the Yucatan Coast\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNCAA Rescinds Rule to Allow Betting on Pro Sports Amid Reckoning\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPierre Hotel Marks 95 Years Amid Dispute Over Potential Sale\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tAward-winning filmmaker Eisha Marjara’s “Calorie” is set to make its Asian premiere at the 56th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa, with Compass Productions unveiling a trailer ahead of the screening.\n\n\tThe coming-of-age drama, which recently swept Toronto’s IFFSA festival with wins for best film, director, and actress (Canadian film), will launch its Canada-wide theatrical release on Nov. 28 through distributor Filmoption International.\n\t\n\n\tThe film follows three generations of women whose present and past collide during an emotionally charged summer in India. Monika (Ellora Patnaik), a stressed-out single mother, sends her two teenage daughters — calorie-obsessed Alia (Shanaya Dhillon-Birmhan) and rebellious Simi (Ashley Ganger) — to India to visit their great aunt and uncle, hoping to connect them with their Punjabi roots. What begins as a reluctant trip transforms into a coming-of-age journey as the sisters discover a hidden family tragedy that threatens to splinter the entire family.\n\n\n\tThe production stars Patnaik alongside Indian thespian Anupam Kher, known for “Silver Linings Playbook,” Ganger from Netflix’s “Grand Army,” and introduces Dhillon-Birmhan in her first major starring role. The cast also includes Dolly Ahluwalia, a Indian National Film Award winner for “Vicky Donor.”\n\n\tInspired by real events, the film draws from Marjara’s personal history. In summer 1985, her mother and younger sister boarded Air India flight 182 from Montreal, which exploded mid-air, killing all 329 passengers. Marjara, who was due to be on that flight, channels this tragedy into a narrative about intergenerational trauma and healing.\n\t\n\n\t“The film serves as a way to mend the complicated fabric of this past to those affected by it and provide a broader picture that leans towards connection and healing by putting a family at its centre,” Marjara said. “We witness a Sikh Canadian family grappling with contemporary issues within walls of silence, misunderstanding, and buried hurt and see them come out on the other side more whole, more centered and united.”\n\n\tProducer Joe Balass, who founded Compass Productions in 1997, emphasized the decade-long journey to bring the project to screen. Dhillon-Birmhan was only 11 years old when filming began on what became her feature debut.\n\n\tThe feature was shot in both Canada and India, with cinematography by Marc Simpson-Threlford (CSC) and Christophe Dalpé. The film received support from Telefilm Canada, the Canada Media Fund, CBC Films, Hollywood Suite, and ATN. It previously participated in Film Bazaar, as the market component of IFFI was known as earlier.\n\n\tThe project marks Marjara’s latest feature following her NFB documentary “Am I the Skinniest Person You’ve Ever Seen?,” which won the Betty Youson Award for Best Canadian Short at the 2024 Hot Docs Festival.\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “Calorie” here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tChristopher Nolan confirmed to Empire Magazine (via World of Reel) that Warner Bros. originally hired him to direct its swords-and-sandals epic “Troy,” more than two decades before Nolan would mount his adaptation of Homer’s “The Odyssey.” The events depicted in the former movie factor into the latter, which is why the Oscar winner told the publication mounting his film version of “The Odyssey” did not come out of nowhere despite some fans being surprised Nolan would want to tackle Homer’s Greek epic. \n\t\n\n\t“I was originally hired by Warner Bros. to direct ‘Troy.’ Wolfgang [Petersen] had developed it, and so when the studio decided not to proceed with his superhero movie [‘Batman Vs Superman’], he wanted it back,” Nolan said. “At the end of the day, it was a world that I was very interested to explore. So it’s been at the back of my mind for a very long time. Certain images, particularly. How I wanted to handle the Trojan horse, things like that.”\n\n\n\tWolfgang Peterson was fresh off the box office hits “Air Force One” and “The Perfect Storm” when he pivoted away from “Troy” and into the superhero space with his own take on “Batman v Superman” for Warner Bros. Nolan had successfully jumped from “Memento” into the Hollywood studio space by helming Warner Bros.’ 2002 thriller “Insomnia.” The studio wanted to keep Nolan in house with “Troy.” In an ironic twist of fate, Nolan told Empire that Warner Bros. took back “Troy” to give to Peterson and then offered Nolan “Batman Begins” as a “consolation prize.” \n\n\tPeterson’s “Troy” ended up starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger. The movie opened to mixed reviews in summer 2004 but earned nearly $500 million worldwide. Nolan’s “Batman Begins” arrived the following summer and launched what would become one of Warner Bros.’ most acclaimed and financially successful film trilogies. \n\t\n\n\tWith the upcoming “The Odyssey,” Nolan is finally getting to fulfill his dream of bringing the Trojan war to the big screen. The movie stars Matt Damon in the lead role of Odysseus. Tom Holland plays his son, Telemachus. The sprawling ensemble also includes Anne Hathaway, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong’o, Robert Pattinson, Charlize Theron and Jon Bernthal.\n\n\t“As a filmmaker, you’re looking for gaps in cinematic culture, things that haven’t been done before,” Nolan also told  Empire magazine about why he chose to turn Homer’s “Odyssey” into a movie. “And what I saw is that all of this great mythological cinematic work that I had grown up with – Ray Harryhausen movies and other things – I’d never seen that done with the sort of weight and credibility that an A-budget and a big Hollywood, IMAX production could do.”\n\n\t“The Odyssey” is set for release on July 17, 2026, from Universal Pictures.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCulver City has approved a $500,000 film incentive program that Mayor Dan O’Brien calls an effort to “reignite” production activity in the city that once touted itself as “the Heart of Screenland.” \n\n\tThe package was championed by O’Brien, a longtime film editor who has been mayor since December 2022. The film industry support package was voted in by the Culver City Council on Nov. 10. The package was billed as a “comprehensive set of measures designed to support recovery for film and television” that will in turn attract business and boost the local economy.\n\t\n\n\t“As a 30-year film professional, I think it’s critical we find ways to reignite film production efforts in Culver City,” said O’Brien. “I’m proud to see our City Council come together to support a far-reaching piece of our economy that affects every part of our community. These steps should boost production, and I’m excited to see the results.”\n\n\n\tIt’s a thorough checklist for studios and production companies looking to squeeze costs wherever they can. The legislation includes a temporary incentive for film permit fees, free production parking, the creation of a film-specific business directory and a resolution extending the suspension of business tax collection “for itinerant motion picture and television producers” through 2036. The city has set a $500,000 cap on total incentives; they want films to make money, but they can’t afford to lose any, either.\n\n\tThe city is also launching a public awareness campaign to showcase the incentives, and the development of a film location familiarization tour in partnership with FilmLA.\n\t\n\n\tCulver City is hoping the incentive dollars will attract new productions and retain existing filming. For the long term, it is also hoping these rules will support student films and small-scale projects, and provide essential support for creative sector jobs. Culver City was historically the home of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the most prosperous and influential studio of Hollywood’s 1930s and ’40s Golden Age. Today, Sony Pictures Entertainment is housed on the former MGM grounds. Amazon, Apple and Warner Bros. Discovery also have media and content operations in the area.\n\n\t“The incentives announced by the City Council are a great start to reinvigorating filmmaking in Culver City,” said independent film director Dan Mirvish, who lives and works in Culver City, “Robust film communities like Culver City can’t and shouldn’t wait for the State of California to save us from runaway production. We need to save ourselves, and these incentives are definitely a good start.”\n\n\tBig shifts in Hollywood, consumer tastes and the business models for movies and TV shows have added up to a precipitous drop in lensing activity in Los Angeles County — a situation that was temporarily made worse by January’s wildfires. The state of California expanded its Film & Television Tax Credit Program this year, increasing statewide incentives to $750 million annually through 2030.\n",

After the six-month promo period is over, the price will go up to $12.99/‍month. The deal is not available to customers who are eligible for three free months of Apple TV with the purchase of an Apple device, as well as to those whose subscriptions are billed through a third party.\n\t\n\n\tThe deal comes after Apple TV (formerly known as Apple TV+, before the tech giant dropped the plus sign last month) in August bumped up the monthly price from $9.99 to $12.99 per month. It’s the third price increase for the streaming service in the last three years.\n\n\n\tApple TV’s originals include the mind-bending sci-fi series “Pluribus,” as well as award-winning shows like “Severance,” “The Studio,” “The Morning Show” and “Slow Horses.” Its movie lineup includes “The Family Plan 2,” which bowed Nov. 21, and “F1 The Movie” starring Brad Pitt, which will hit the service Dec. 12. The service also features a lineup of kids programming, including new and classic Peanuts specials, and offers access to MLB’s “Friday Night Baseball” live games and Major League Soccer matches (and next year MLS games will be available at no additional cost to Apple TV subscribers). \n\n\tStarting in 2026, Apple TV will be the exclusive U.S. home for Formula 1 races under a five-year deal estimated to be worth $750 million. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tThis story contains major spoilers for “Wicked: For Good.”\n\n\tJon M. Chu isn’t shy about it — the second half of his two-film adaptation is the one where he tears down walls. Literally.\n\n\tOne of the film’s most talked-about sequences — the split-door staging of “For Good” — wasn’t scripted and almost didn’t exist.\n\n\n\tChu says he found the emotional shape of the moment months before cameras rolled. During an early rehearsal, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande began improvising a goodbye — speaking, not singing — with their arms wrapped around each other in a corner of the room. When they placed their hands against an imaginary door, Chu says he “started to weep.”\n\t\n\n\t“It was in rehearsals that we found it,” Chu reveals. “Cynthia grabs her and says, ‘Come here.’ And I’m like, where are they going? And they go to this corner, and she puts her in a box or a closet.”\n\n\tThat rehearsal changed everything. The director admitted he forgot to call cut as the two stars continued riffing on their characters’ farewell. The moment’s authenticity convinced Chu to demolish a wall to capture it on film.\n\n\tBy the time production reached the number, Chu insisted the physical set had to match the emotional truth. “We had to knock down that wall,” he says. “They told me, ‘If you knock down that wall, you can’t use the set anymore.’ But I didn’t care. It was the moment. Knock down the effing wall.”\n\n\tThe resulting split-frame sequence, with Erivo and Grande pressed against opposite sides of a now-destroyed barrier, quickly became the emotional centerpiece of the film — and, Chu says, his personal favorite moment across both installments.\n\t\n\n\tIt also led directly to the title. “That’s when I knew the second movie had to be called ‘For Good.'”\n\n\tThe scene also required bending one of the film’s established linguistic guidelines. According to Chu, Oz has language rules — ones that Stephen Schwartz, who wrote the original stage score, had long held as canon.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCynthia Erivo is Elphaba and Ariana Grande is Glinda in “Wicked for Good.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversal Pictures\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“You’re not allowed to say ‘I love you’ in Oz,” Chu says. “No God, no okay, no I love you.”\n\n\tBut when Erivo told Grande, “I love you” on set, Chu fought to keep the line. “It was so human,” he says. “It crossed over a boundary of Oz into our world.” Schwartz eventually agreed.\n\n\tIf “Wicked” is the lighter, comedic rise, “Wicked: For Good,” Chu says, is a descent — a darker, more political tragedy.\n\n\tChu details the transformation of Boq into the Tin Man, played exquisitely by Ethan Slater, which he describes as “the birth of a monster” that goes beyond the physical metamorphosis. “Boq is someone who’s ignored. Someone who wants acknowledgement that he exists,” Chu says.\n\n\t“When he’s making his speech in front of that crowd on the steps of the capital of Oz, and there’s fire, and he’s telling his grievances. He changes in that moment even more than he changed when he turned into the tin man,” Chu explains.\n\n\tIn “Wicked: For Good,” Boq stands on the steps of the Capitol, flames behind him, railing against everything he’s lost. Slater suggested one of the transformation’s defining beats: Boq looking at Glinda, realizing he no longer needs her, then turning back to the roaring crowd that validates his growing rage.\n\n\t“That is the full transformation,” Chu asserts. “That’s when he really loses his heart. Not when his body turns to tin — but when he finds community in hate.”\n\n\tLongtime fans of the stage musical have spent two decades debating whether Glinda knows Elphaba is alive at the end of the story. Chu says the film has an answer, but he doesn’t want to confirm it.\n\n\t“I definitely have a definitive idea in my head,” he says. “But I prefer everyone to be able to interpret it how they want to.”\n\n\tChu emphasizes that the power of the ending lies in both women stepping into the unknown — Glinda choosing to try to be Glinda the Good, and Elphaba stepping into a new life beyond the shadows of Oz.\n\n\t“It was never a buttoned-up fairy tale,” he says. “It was born of raw human nature, and something beautiful emerges from that.”\n\n\tChu is aware that the political imagery — misinformation, fracturing communities, a populace choosing “truths” based on collective belief rather than fact — is resonating more sharply today.\n\t\n\n\tBut he insists it wasn’t intentional commentary.\n\n\t“The line ‘the truth is not a thing of fact or reason, it’s just what we all agree on’ was written 20 years ago,” he says. “That’s the power of a timeless story. It always feels timely.”\n\n\tStill, he acknowledges that the world seems to keep catching up to the movie’s themes. “Every week it gets more relevant.”\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is now playing in theaters.\n",

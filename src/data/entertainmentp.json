    "body": "\n\t“Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!” has sold to Sony Pictures Classics following its debut at Sundance. The crowd-pleasing story of a widow named Haru — whose love of ballroom dancing helps her overcome her grief after the shocking death of her husband — was one of the festival’s opening night films, scoring a standing ovation. Critics seemed to agree with the audience, with reviews praising the direction of Josef Kubota Wladyka, the lead performance of Oscar nominee Rinko Kikuchi and the imaginative dance sequences.\n\t\n\n\tIndieWire wrote, “‘Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!’ offers an effervescent spirit so often missing in this milieu, with a lovely performance from Kikuchi at its center.” And The Hollywood Reporter raved, “with an engaging star and a story that leads to a touching, optimistic ending, Wladyka has created a little gem likely to find its audience.”\n\n\n\tThe pact is for global rights to the picture. Alberto Guerra, Alejandro Edda, Yoh Yoshida, You and Damián Alcázar co-star in the film. Wladyka co-wrote the screenplay with Nicholas Huynh. Additional members of the creative team include composer Nathan Halpern, cinematographer Daniel Satinoff and editor Benjamin Rodriguez Jr. Producers include Kimberly Parker Zox and Mao Nagakura. \n\n\tKikuchi is best known for her work in “Babel,” for which she was nominated for an Academy Award, and for her turns in “Pacific Rim” and “Tokyo Vice,” which she worked on with Wladyka. For her latest role in “Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!,” Kikuchi underwent six months of ballroom dance training.\n\n\t“I needed the dance to be as convincing as possible,”Kikuchi told Variety. “It was very critical in order to show Haru and Luis’ relationship.”\n\t\n\n\tWladyka’s credits include the features “Catch the Fair One,” which launched the acting career of Kali Reis and earned the pro boxer an Independent Spirit Award nomination, as well as “Manos Sucias.” He has directed episodes of “Narcos” and “One Piece.” Wladyka said “Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!” was inspired by his own mother, who was in the audience on opening night and received her own standing ovation. “Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!” is the first feature film in competition at Sundance to score a distribution deal. Olivia Wilde’s “The Invite” was purchased by A24, but that film bowed out of competition. \n\n\t“Exhilarating, surprising, immensely entertaining describe this wonderful new film directed by filmmaker, Josef Wladyka. We can’t wait for theatrical audiences everywhere to be energized by and smile as they watch ‘Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty,” stated Sony Pictures Classics. \n\n\tSony Pictures Classics has released such seminal indie films as “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” “Howard’s End,” “Whiplash,” “Capote” and “The Lives of Others.” Last year, it distributed the Oscar-nominated “Blue Moon,” as well as the box office hit “Nuremberg.”\n\n\t“I have so much admiration and respect for the body of work and history that Sony Pictures Classics represents. To join their family and put this film out into theaters is a dream come true. I can’t wait for the world to see Rinko Kikuchi’s formidable performance,” Wladyka said in a statement. \n\n\tCAA handled sales of the film. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Berlin Film Festival has added Xu Zao‘s animated film “Han ye deng zhu” (“Light Pillar”) to its Perspectives section for first-time features.\n\n\tThe Chinese production is set in the future, where “space travel is no longer a dream,” according to its official synopsis. “A lonely janitor tends the grounds of a dilapidated bankrupt film studio with only a former cat actor for company until he embarks on a romantic journey with a female player in a beautiful virtual world.” The Berlinale will mark its world premiere.\n\t\n\n\t“Light Pillar” completes the Perspectives sidebar, which now consists of 14 feature film debuts. The selection also includes “Adolescence” star Ashley Walters’ drama “Animol,” Dara Van Dusen’s Western “A Prayer for the Dying” starring Johnny Flynn and John C. Reilly and the Israel-Germany co-production “Where To?” from Assaf Machnes. “Light Pillar” is the second animated feature slated to bow in the main programme of the Berlinale, alongside Yoshitoshi Shinomiya’s “A New Dawn” which will play in competition. \n\n\n\tThe Chinese film was produced by Xu and actor-filmmaker Da Peng at Fengduan Film. Xu previously won the DOK Leipzig’s Golden Dove in 2023 with his animated documentary short No Changes Have Taken in Our Life.”\n\n\tThe Perspectives section was launched last year, at the inaugural edition of artistic director Tricia Tuttle, who joined the Berlinale after a decade spent at the BFI London Film Festival. \n\n\tThe 76th edition of the Berlin Film Festival boasts a competition lineup that includes Karim Aïnouz’s starry “Rosebush Pruning” with Riley Keough, Callum Turner and Elle Fanning, as well as Channing Tatum’s latest feature “Josephine;” and Kornél Mundruczó’s “At the Sea” starring Amy Adams. \n\t\n\n\tAfghan director Shahrbanoo Sadat’s romantic comedy “No Good Men” will kick off the festival on Feb. 12. \n",

    "body": "\n\tLater tonight, João Nicolau’s “Providence and the Guitar” will play concurrently in five screening rooms across Rotterdam as the opening film at this year’s International Film Festival Rotterdam, an occasion the Portuguese filmmaker calls a “great responsibility.” \n\n\tAdapted from Robert Louis Stevenson’s eponymous short story, “Providence and the Guitar” trails travelling artists León (Pedro Inês) and Elvira (Clara Riedenstein) as they dodge moody police officers and rivals while hopping from town to town. The period piece is peppered with sequences in the present, where the two musicians, now in a punk rock band, continue to struggle to make a living through their art. Speaking with Variety ahead of the film’s world premiere in the Dutch city, Nicolau says, “It’s an immense joy” to have such a prestigious slot.\n\t\n\n\t“I have never been to Rotterdam, but several colleagues have and have told me it is a vibrant festival willing to platform riskier cinema as well as smaller productions,” he adds.\n\n\n\t“I think it was a very bold, courageous choice by the programming team to have us as the opening film, because it is not necessarily your typical opener. I say this not because of the themes that the film explores, but because of its language. There is a certain demand to it, and we open several doors to the audience and invite them in. I’m very curious about the reaction on the ground.”\n\n\tNicolau points out that the brief original short story acted as “a starting point” for the two-hour film. “I fell in love with the tone of the narrative and the characters, and I thought it deserved a feature film to translate its richness and the nuances of the language. My previous films have featured drier, more laconic characters, and I wanted to find the pleasure of exploring language.”\n\t\n\n\t“I wrote a first version that followed the structure of the short story, which I called the camera version, and then I wrote the symphonic version,” he goes on when asked about the time-hopping element. “That version features sequences in the future, which are, in a way, flashbacks exploring the relationship between the main couple. I thought the themes explored in the short story were really current, so the jumps in time came naturally.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Providence and the Guitar,” courtesy of IFFR\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAll songs in the film are original compositions by Nicolau and creative partner João Lobo, except for one tune that uses a poem by lauded Brazilian poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade. The director, also an amateur musician, says music has always occupied a “central stage” in his work. “Music is a key part of human existence. If we film characters eating, working, making love, we can also film characters singing, playing and composing together.”\n\n\tAs for the song’s simple arrangements, Nicolau says it came from the film’s period background. Since the main characters are on the road with access only to an acoustic guitar, “there was no space or scope for big musical arrangements.”\n\n\tTalking about music, Nicolau was glad to be able to work with longtime friend and popular Portuguese singer — and 2017 Eurovision winner — Salvador Sobral. “I am interested in having professional musicians try their hand at cinema in my films,” he says. “The process of casting Salvador went very well and, interestingly, he barely sings in the film. But his nature as a musician is present in all of his scenes.”\n\n\tBut, of course, there were several challenges in getting such an ambitious production off the ground. The greatest of them all was the production’s limited budget, given that Nicolau could not land a co-production deal with prospective partners in Belgium and France. “Providence and the Guitar” is an entirely Portuguese production, supported by the country’s national film body, the ICA. \n\n\t“This lack of money ended up orienting a lot of my creative choices,” remarks the director. “We couldn’t spend a lot on production design or building entire new sets, which meant I decided to create an indefinite past. Not that this is key to the film itself, as long as we did not have contemporary elements on the screen. The past in the film could be 70 or 200 years ago.”\n\t\n\n\tDespite believing the film could have been shot in “any small European village that was convenient for the co-production,” Nicolau is glad to have made the film in his native language. “I always wanted the film to be in Portuguese because, despite the original text being in English, I fell in love with the Portuguese translation. That was my starting point for all the dialogue. There was a pleasure in the language and the sound that was fundamental to me creatively.” \n\n\t“Providence and the Guitar” is produced by Luís Urbano and Sandro Aguilar for O Som e a Fúria. Shellac holds international sales rights. \n",

    "body": "\n\tComcast said its fourth quarter was crimped by losses of broadband customers, a less robust slate of Universal movies and broader losses at its Peacock streaming service as the company navigates through a difficult operating climate for traditional media companies.\n\n\tThe Philadelphia media giant said net income attributable to its operations fell 54.6% to $2.17 billion, or 60 cents per share, compared with $4.78 billion, or $1.24 per share, in the year-earlier period. The company said the year-earlier quarter contained a take benefit that created an “unfavorable comparison.”  Stripping out one-time items, Comcast’s adjusted net income stood at $3.06 billion, or 84 cents per share.\n\t\n\n\tRevenue in the fourth quarter — Comcast’s last with the suite of cable networks recently spun off to form the new company Versant — was up more than 1%, to $32.31 billion. \n\n\n\tThe company’s broadband operations showed further signs of erosion, with 181,000 domestic broadband customers  lost during the period,. Comcast indicated losses were offset by an increase in international subscribers. Comcast also lost 245,000 pay TV customers during the period, leaving its pay TV subscriber base at 11.27 million.\n\n\tRevenue at the company’s NBCUniversal operations proved more hardy, with revenue from media operations up 5.5% to $7.62 billion. \n\n\tComcast said U.S. advertising from media operations rose 1.5% due to the addition of the NBA on NBC.\n\n\tThe company’s streaming service, Peacock, has in recent quarters grappled with luring new customers, but it saw a new tranche of 3 million paid customers in the fourth quarter, ending 2025with 44 million paid subscribers. Even so, losses widened at the streaming service to $552 million for the fourth quarter, compared with $372 million in losses  in the year earlier period. Peacock revenue rose to $1.6 billion in compared with $1.3 billion a year ago.\n\t\n\n\tRevenue from film fell 7.4% to $3.03 billion, due to what the company said was a drop in licensing and theatrical revenue. Movies such as “Wicked: For Good” and “Black Phone 2″ did not perform as robustly as the year-earlier slate, which included “Wicked” and “The Bad Robot.”\n\n\tThe company’s theme-parks business offered a bright spot, with revenue up 22% to about $2.9 billion, spurred in part by the opening of Epic Universe.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter nearly two years, Netflix’s beloved 19th-century-set series “Bridgerton” has returned, and this time, the focus is on the love life of the esteemed family’s bisexual second son, Benedict Bridgerton (Luke Thompson). A talented artist with diverse sexual appetites, Benedict has always been a part of this world. But now, in a season that is quite distinct from the previous ones, he’s stepping into the spotlight as the Ton’s most eligible bachelor. Though Season 4 Part 1 offers a slight twist on the classic “Cinderella” story, the romance between Benedict and Sophie Baek (an outstanding Yerin Ha), a maid working for a high-ranking family, is actually the least interesting aspect of this new chapter. ​\n\t\n\n\tThe fourth season of “Bridgerton” opens in a frenzy. In preparation for her masquerade ball, Lady Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) glides through Bridgerton House, overseeing her staff and eagerly awaiting the return of her daughters, Francesca (Hannah Dodd) and Eloise (Claudia Jesse), from Scotland. Though the majority of the Bridgerton siblings are squared away, Benedict remains unaccounted for. Despite taking over the duties of the Viscount in his older brother Anthony’s (Jonathan Bailey) absence, finding a wife and settling down is the last thing on Benedict’s mind. In fact, Violet has to nearly drag him away from his bachelor pad to attend her highly anticipated soirée.​\n\n\n\tDetermined to keep the eager debutantes and their desperate mamas at bay, Benedict reluctantly attends the ball, in which everyone must don a mask. In the midst of the overwhelming and undesired attention on him, he finds himself alone with a mysterious (and also masked) Lady in Silver, who flees just as the clock strikes midnight. Smitten with this unknown woman and having few details to confirm her identity, Benedict teams up with Eloise (Claudia Jesse) and Penelope (Nicola Coughlan), aka Lady Whistledown (still voiced by Julie Andrews), to find his fleeing dance partner.\n\t\n\n\tBenedict doesn’t realize that the woman who has entirely captured his attention is Sophie, the maid for the formidable Araminta Gun (Katie Leung), aka Lady Penwood and her daughters, the vicious and self-absorbed Rosamund Li (Michelle Mao) and the sweet but simple Posy Li (Isabella Wei). Over the course of four episodes, Sophie grapples with the fleeting magical moment she and Benedict shared and the reality of her wearisome existence. Unpacking the Penwood legacy is one of the season’s more gripping components. Leung, who played Cho Chang in the “Harry Potter” films, portrays the twice-widowed mother with such fierce, unsettling wickedness that she is absolutely mesmerizing to watch.\n\n\tHa is also fantastic in her role as a sharp and earnest young woman intent on carving out some semblance of happiness for herself in a culture that has deemed her invisible. Unfortunately, at least as depicted in Part 1, Sophie and Benedict’s romance lacks the tantalizing heat and erotic chemistry of the show’s previous central couples. Though they are doing and saying all of the right things, their connection doesn’t leap off the screen.\n\n\t“Bridgerton” is known for its steamy sex scenes between the central couple. This season, those visuals are thus far reserved for the connection between newlyweds Penelope and Colin (Luke Newton). Viewers also get insight into the lives of Francesca and John Stirling (Victor Alli), who have returned to London from Scotland for the social season. However, the true romantic highlight of Season 4 thus far is the burgeoning lust, yearning and flirtation Lady Violet shares with Lord Marcus Anderson (Daniel Francis). A limited series could be devoted solely to them. Meanwhile, Benedict and Sophie fade into the background, especially amid the bizarrely split season, which harms the show’s pacing and its central romantic tension.\n\n\tOther compelling themes so far this season are the importance of female friendships, especially in a society that pits women against one another. This is spotlighted in Lady Penwood’s home, in the decades-long relationship Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel) shares with Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh) and in the evolving sisterhood of the fiercely independent Eloise and her baby sister Hyacinth (Florence Hunt), who is bursting at the seams to be thrown on the marriage market.  \n\t\n\n\tAdditionally, showrunner Jess Brownell goes behind the veil of the upstairs newly to focus on the staffers of these elite homes (in the downstairs). Viewers are taken into the kitchens, laundry rooms and the private quarters of the people who keep the Ton’s lives running smoothly. Seeing their concerns, hardships, joys and the sheer amount of work they do expands the “Bridgerton” world in a way that is needed to carry the audience through the next four seasons.\n\n\t“Bridgerton” Season 4, Part 1 works despite Sophie and Benedict’s restrained courtship. Familiar faces pop in and out, and viewers are introduced to several new characters who will undoubtedly put their own stamps on the franchise.\n\n\tAll episodes of “Bridgerton” Season 4 Part 1 are streaming on Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere aren’t many world premieres where you get to meet actual, crown-wearing heads of state. Likewise, there aren’t many world premieres where meetings with those heads of state are interrupted by bona fide rock legends.\n\n\tBut then, there are very few world premieres like the one for “Finding Harmony: A King’s Vision” — King Charles’ environmental documentary launching on Amazon — that took place on Wednesday night at Windsor Castle, the still-active palace founded by William the Conqueror almost 1,000 years ago.As Kate Winslet noted in the opening speech of the night, it was “the first time a film premiere had taken place in a royal residence.”\n\t\n\n\tWinslet, who narrates the documentary, was speaking to a room of fellow film royalty (Judi Dench was there alongside Benedict Cumberbatch, Kenneth Branagh and Stanley Tucci), plus experts, academics, charity professionals and entrepreneurs from across the environmental and sustainability worlds. Other assorted notables were also in attendance, including musicians (Jools Holland), former F1 champions (Sebastian Vettel), astronauts (Tim Peake) and TV bosses (Apple TV’s European chief Jay Hunt, whose sister Kristina Murrin runs The King’s Foundation and features in the film).\n\n\n\t“It appears we have an archbishop here,” one guest exclaimed to Variety (one of a very small handful of press invited) before the screening started as a man played the bagpipes nearby. Indeed, across the room was someone decked out head-to-toe in red Catholic Church robes (actually later confirmed as the Dean of Windsor, Christopher Cocksworth). Archbishop or not, this was no ordinary premiere.\n\t\n\n\tAnd then there was the actual royalty, King Charles and Queen Camilla, seated at the very front (in slightly plusher chairs).\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKing Charles and Queen Camilla attend the film premiere for “Finding Harmony: A King’s Vision” at Windsor Castle. (Photo by Jonathan Brady – Pool/Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The King is not going to say any words — he’s going to come in and sit down,” the audience was politely told before the monarch’s arrival. As part of strict royal protocol, we were also informed which doors the King and Queen would be exiting out of afterwards and which doors everyone else should depart from (note: the other side).\n\n\tAs for the setting, this was somewhat removed from the U.K.’s usual world premiere location, the Odeon Luxe in Leicester Square. And it no doubt far overshadowed the makeshift cinema put up at the White House recently for Melania Trump’s doc (although that boasted an equally eclectic list of attendees). There may not have been branded popcorn buckets here (or any popcorn at all, for that matter), but each guest did get a King’s Foundation water bottle on their seat.\n\n\tDeep within the ancient and sprawling Windsor Castle, lit up majestically for a plethora of blurry outdoor photo opps, the “Finding Harmony” screening took place in the Waterloo Chamber, accessible only after passing numerous displays of medieval armor, canons, muskets and other suitably castle-like decorations. Inside the Chamber, glitteringly ornate and boasting several several crystal chandeliers, scores of paintings of British royals dating back hundreds of years and dressed in all their regal splendor beamed down from each wall. Impressive they may have looked, but none of them have fronted their own documentary, have they?\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKing Charles speaks to Stanley Tucci and Dame Judi Dench (Photo by Jonathan Brady – Pool/Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn that note, the film itself, releasing on Prime Video Feb. 6., sees King Charles reflect on more than half a century of environmentalism, his own philosophy when it comes to nature and the founding of The King’s Foundation, which has been putting it into practice for the last 35 years. Of a number of guests speaking on camera about the King’s work, most notable was perhaps Al Gore.\n\n\tWhile few would be shocked to hear that “Finding Harmony” contains the sort of puff piece element often seen in such bio docs, there are moments many might not expect, not least its coverage of the ridicule Charles received in the press when he became an early advocate for organic farming and began highlighting concerns over climate change long before it became a major global debate. There was even space for some laughs — Charles is seen in a chicken coop called Cluckingham Palace. At the end of the film, the royal even appears to shed a tear while considering the current state of the planet.\n\t\n\n\tAs we were told, the King did not say any words before the premiere. But he delighted everyone by jovially working the room at the post-screening reception in the neighboring — and equally majestic — St. George’s Hall, flanked closely by his fraught-looking (yet expertly trained) personnel.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKing Charles and Kate Winslet (Photo by Jonathan Brady – Pool/Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tVariety was among those who managed to shuffle in line to get a few words with the King, who joked that it had been “absolutely awful” to see himself on the big screen. He later asked about Variety’s circulation, but before we could deliver the monarch any stats (top entertainment business news website since June 2022, for example), we were sadly interrupted.\n\n\tNaturally, given the wonderfully surreal nature of the evening, it was perhaps unsurprising who interrupted our royal chinwag. It was Rod Stewart.\n",

    "body": "\n\tInternational Film Festival Rotterdam is known for its highbrow programming, but that’s not all it offers viewers, argues festival director Vanja Kaludjercic.\n\n\t“The perception of IFFR as an event with edgy and unconventional cinema isn’t wrong. But it’s just one part of a much bigger truth,” she tells Variety ahead of 55th edition. \n\n\t“You’re going to find the most avant-garde and the most popular films – two sides of everything. Tiger films [shown in the Tiger Competition] don’t immediately speak to many people, but then we show Kleber Mendonça Filho’s ‘The Secret Agent,’ which does.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Secret Agent” has been making waves during awards season, emerging as an Oscar contender. \n\n\n\t“We need to support a wide variety of films. We need to be there for all of them.”\n\n\tShe states there’s a “responsibility” that comes with being the biggest cinema-related event in the country.\n\n\t“You want to engage with a different audience and be there for those who might be just starting their adventure with us, also because of their age. But even if you’re a six-month-old baby, we have Baby Film Club [a selection of shorts for children ages 0 to 3].”\n\n\tAlso this year, there’re many audience-friendly films and initiatives for children and students. \n\n\t“Thanks to IFFR Education, we’re catering to thousands and thousands of kids. If you’re in the main square around 9 a.m., you’ll see buses of children entering different venues,” she laughs. “We really want to be accessible to as many people we can.”\n\t\n\n\tManaging director Clare Stewart adds: “Our IFFR Education team just went to a pre-festival event at a hospital. It really goes that far. We’re working in a very collaborative way with different communities, from skaters to refugees.” \n\n\tIn an effort to mirror the realities of Rotterdam, “the most diverse city in the Netherlands,” Stewart says “it’s all about ‘placemaking.’ “We think about how this event fits into the fabric of the city.”\n\n\tThe launch of the Displacement Film Fund and this year’s introduction of CineMart’s market program Safe Harbour fits within that strategy, too. The latter will focus on projects in development from emerging filmmakers who have experienced displacement or forced migration.\n\n\t“It’ll create more opportunities, but also hopefully raise awareness. We want to make everyone feel fully embedded in the ecosystem that we can offer,” notes Kaludjercic. Stewart agrees: “We have a role to play in supporting cinema from places without easy access or where the line to funding is not straightforward because of political conditions or lack of infrastructure.” \n\n\tApart from trying to grow with its audience and opening up to disadvantaged filmmakers, IFFR continues to rely on surprising encounters. Its Big Talks usually feature unexpected pairings. This year, that includes Mendonça Filho and Carla Simón, Marwan Hamed – also celebrating his retrospective – and Yousry Nasrallah or Valeria Golino and Palestinian actor and “Succession” alumnus Hiam Abbass. \n\n\tThe idea originated with the book “25 Encounters,” which celebrated the festival during the pandemic era through conversations with 50 people. \n\n\t“We thought: What makes a film festival a film festival? It’s all these amazing figures. Engaging in a dialogue with someone you might not even know but who you find intriguing raises curiosity and opens up new perspectives,” Kaludjercic says.\n\n\t“Carla Simón and Kleber Mendonça Filho actually have a lot in common: they’re both attached to the places they come from, and that fuels their storytelling. Or take Hiam Abbass, known for her incredible contribution to Arab cinema and her international career, and Valeria Golino. I first saw her in ‘Rain Man,’ not in an Italian film. She’s this big, mesmerizing figure. I already know they’re going to deliver something special.”\n\t\n\n\tIt’s all about discovery – also in its selection. \n\n\t“It’s a programmers’ festival, too. They’re looking for gems, which becomes even more important as the independent film sector faces more challenges,” observes Stewart. But here is good news, too. Last year’s winner, ‘Fiume o Morte!’ by Igor Bezinović, broke decades-long records for documentary admissions in Croatia.\n\n\tAnother challenge that the IFFR continues to address is finding space for art. \n\n\t“Exploding Cinema has gradually evolved into commissioned works by high-profile artists like Steve McQueen. Now, we’re celebrating 30 years of Art Directions, which speaks beautifully to the film program,” says Kaludjercic, also mentioning “very immersive film piece” “Krakatoa,” accompanied by an installation, as well as this year’s Reality Check conference dedicated to immersive works. \n\n\t“There are no borders; they just seep into one another. The freedom of formats and forms we can offer to artists is something I really cherish.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tChristopher Nolan’s mind-bending thriller “Inception,” Amy Heckerling’s coming-of-age comedy “Clueless” and Richard Linklater’s slice-of-life drama “Before Sunrise” are among the 25 films selected for preservation by the National Film Registry.\n\n\tOther titles deemed by the Librarian of Congress as “culturally, historically or aesthetically” that were made at least 10 years ago include 1989 war epic “Glory,” martial arts-inspired “The Karate Kid,” Tom Hanks-led historical drama “Philadelphia,” biopic “Frida,” Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel” and Pixar’s “The Incredibles.”\n\t\n\n\tThis year’s selections date back to the silent film era with six films from 1896 through 1926, such as “The Tramp and the Dog” and “The Lady.” Additions to the Classic Hollywood category include the 1954 musical “White Christmas” as well as the romantic comedy “High Society,” featuring Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong and Grace Kelly. Others that made the list were the Ken Burns documentary “Brooklyn Bridge,” Jim Carrey’s dramedy “The Truman Show” and ensemble comedy “The Big Chill,” featuring Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt and Kevin Kline.\n\n\n\t“When we preserve films, we preserve American culture for generations to come. These selections for the National Film Registry show us that films are instrumental in capturing important parts of our nation’s story,” said Acting Librarian of Congress Robert R. Newlen. “We are proud to continue this important work, adding a broad range of 25 films to the National Film Registry as a collective effort in the film community to protect our cinematic heritage.”\n\t\n\n\tThis year’s choices bring the number of titles in the registry to 925. Turner Classic Movies will host a television special on March 19 to screen a few of the new entrants.\n\n\t“It is very meaningful that the National Film Registry is adding six silent film titles, showing the range of topics and styles in the earliest years of American filmmaking,” says TCM host and film historian Jacqueline Stewart, who is chair of the National Film Preservation Board.  “And it is especially exciting to see that the top title nominated by the public for this year, ‘The Thing,’ has been added to the National Film Registry, along with ‘The Truman Show’ and ‘The Incredibles’ which also had very strong public support.”\n\n\tFilms Selected for the 2025 National Film Registry\n\n\t• The Tramp and the Dog (1896)\n\n\t• The Oath of the Sword (1914)\n\n\t• The Maid of McMillan (1916)\n\n\t• The Lady (1925)\n\n\t• Sparrows (1926)\n\n\t• Ten Nights in a Barroom (1926)\n\n\t• White Christmas (1954)\n\n\t• High Society (1956)\n\n\t• Brooklyn Bridge (1981)\n\n\t• Say Amen, Somebody (1982)\n\n\t• The Thing (1982)\n\n\t• The Big Chill (1983)\n\n\t• The Karate Kid (1984)\n\n\t• Glory (1989)\n\n\t• Philadelphia (1993)\n\n\t• Before Sunrise (1995)\n\n\t• Clueless (1995)\n\n\t• The Truman Show (1998)\n\n\t• Frida (2002)\n\n\t• The Hours (2002)\n\n\t• The Incredibles (2004)\n\n\t• The Wrecking Crew (2008)\n\n\t• Inception (2010)\n\n\t• The Loving Story (2011)\n\n\t• The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)\n",

Despite his reputation as an eternal bachelor, Benedict is captivated by a woman he spots at the masquerade ball: the Lady in Silver. But beneath the bejeweled mask is Sophie Baek (Yerin Ha), a maid — not a member of high society. \n\n\tThe Netflix series, inspired by Julia Quinn’s “Bridgerton” book series, first premiered in 2020 to rave reviews, quickly becoming a steamy, fan-favorite hit for the streamer. Since then, audiences have watched the show with baited breath as the Bridgerton siblings attempt to find love. The fourth season will premiere in two parts, the first on Jan. 29 and the second on Feb. 26. \n\n\tA long list of beloved cast members are back for the fourth season, including Jonathan Bailey as Anthony Bridgerton, Simone Ashley as Kate Bridgerton, Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Bridgerton and many more. \n\n\tHere’s a guide to all the stars of “Bridgerton” Season 4.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLuke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tLuke Thompson plays Benedict Bridgerton, the second-eldest Bridgerton brother who, after first being introduced to audiences in Season 1,  is now taking center stage as Season 4’s leading man. While he’s been reluctant to settle down in the past, it’s love at first sight when he spots the mysterious Lady in Silver at the masquerade ball, who, unbeknownst to him, is Sophie Baek, a maid. Thompson has previously appeared on screen in “In the Club” and “Transatlantic,” and was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for his role in the 2024 play “A Little Life.”  \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tYerin Ha as Sophie Baek\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tA newcomer to the “Bridgerton” universe, Yerin Ha is the starlet of Season 4 and the romantic interest of Benedict Bridgerton.

The last viewers saw of the eldest Bridgerton, he and Kate appear to be happily married in Season 3. While the English-actor might best be known for stepping into the role of Fiyero in “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good,” the star has a long list of credits that include “Jurassic World Rebirth” and “Fellow Travelers.” \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSimone Ashley as Kate Bridgerton \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSimone Ashley first graced viewers’ screens as Kate Sharma in the show’s pining-filled second season, which focused on the romance between her and Anthony Bridgerton.

Season 3 focused on Colin’s romance with family friend Penelope Featherington, and the season ended with the birth of the couple’s child. Newton has been on the show since its first season in 2020 and also appeared on British musical drama “The Lodge.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNicola Coughlan as Penelope Bridgerton\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tNicola Coughlan returns as Penelope Featherington, who took center stage in Season 3 when she publicly revealed herself as Lady Whistledown and finally won the heart of Colin Bridgerton. The Irish actress is perhaps best known for playing the lovable Clare Devlin in Channel 4’s hit sitcom “Derry Girls,” though her portrayal of Penelope earned her a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Season 3. Coughlan recently added to her accolades with a Best Comedy Performance win at the 2025 TV Choice Awards for her role as Maggie in Channel 4’s “Big Mood,” which also garnered her a BAFTA Television Award nomination.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRuth Gemmell as Violet Bridgerton\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tViolet Bridgerton played by Ruth Gemmell is most known for tirelessly wrangling her unwed children toward suitable matches. In Season 3, the family matriarch finds herself confronting the possibility of a romance of her own with Lord Marcus Anderson. A veteran of British stage and screen, Gemmell is known for her work in “EastEnders,” “Utopia,” and “Home Fires,” bringing emotional depth and gentle authority to the beloved role.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFlorence Hunt as Hyacinth Bridgerton\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFlorence Hunt is back as the youngest Bridgerton, Hyacinth, who comes into her own in Season 4 with mischievous charm and a keen eagerness to enter society despite her young age. Already showing a maturity and poise that rivals her older siblings, she continues to steal scenes with her wit and adventurous spirit.

He says half of his heart has turned black and it's only beating at 60 percent, which is not a good sign.\n      \n\n          Ray J says doctors prescribed him several different meds, including the cholesterol medication Lipitor, Jardiance and Entresto -- medications for people at high risk of heart failure -- among others.\n      \n    \n      \n      Ray J reveals his heart is only operating at 25%, with doctors giving him a short time to live.

In the essay, she says the next morning she woke up in a pool of blood.\n      \n    \n          \"It hurt to walk. It hurt to sit. It hurt to remember,\" she writes.\n      \n    \n          But later, Brooke says she actually initiated a subsequent sexual encounter, thinking it would help her take back control.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Tragically, Brooke writes, her plan completely backfired ... \"I just implicated myself in my own abuse.\"\n      \n    \n          According to Brooke, it was her \"preexisting relationship\" with Matt that made it difficult for her to frame it as abuse at first.\n      \n    \n          She writes, \"Even now, I hear 'rape' and think of masked strangers in dark alleys. Back then, I had no idea what to call what happened other than weird and humiliating.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          As you know ... Brooke's complaint led to Matt's firing from NBC. He denied the accusation, saying all their encounters were consensual. In the aftermath, several other women came out with their own allegations against Matt. His wife of 19 years, Annette Roque, later filed for divorce.\n      \n    \n          When TMZ reached out to Matt by phone for comment, he said he was at dinner and hung up.\n      \n      ",

    "body": "\n\tAgnis Shen Zhongmin’s debut feature, “Shanghai Daughter,” approaches China’s Down to the Countryside Movement through an unconventional lens, treating the southwestern rubber plantations where her late father was sent during the Cultural Revolution as what she calls “a geological theater that already contained all the information of the scripts.”\n\n\tThe film, which is in the Panorama section of the Berlin Film Festival, follows a Shanghai woman who journeys alone to a rubber plantation in southwest China, searching for a mysterious woman while strangers drift unexpectedly into her path. Starring Liang Cuishan alongside non-professional performers, the project deliberately blurs the boundaries between fiction and documentary.\n\t\n\n\t“I have never believed that there exists such a thing as pure fiction or pure reality,” Shen Zhongmin says. Her hybrid approach extended to treating her non-professional cast as creative collaborators rather than traditional actors. “To me, they were even my ‘screenwriters’ and my ‘on-site producers,'” she explains. “Not a single non-professional performer in the film ever received a so-called ‘script.’ They had no prior concept of what they were going to shoot or say.”\n\n\n\tThe director’s methodology emerged organically from her initial search for her father’s old farm residence, a process marked by uncertainty and improvisation due to limited archival materials. “This was never a project that began as a research-based or investigative endeavor; it arose purely from a very primal intuition and emotional impulse within me,” she says. That experience of drifting and searching directly shaped the film’s narrative structure.\n\t\n\n\tRather than treating the rubber plantations and forests as mere backdrops, Shen Zhongmin positions the natural environment as an active narrative force. “A rubber tree produces latex for only about 20 or 30 years, which is not so different from a person’s youth,” she observes. “On many levels, I feel that trees are like people — they have sensations, life cycles and the same impermanence of fate.”\n\n\tThe filmmaker’s approach to collaboration created what she describes as a kinship-based dynamic on set. Liang, the only professional actor in the cast, “possesses a natural, almost non-professional quality” with strong empathetic capacities that allowed her to blend seamlessly with the ensemble. “The state of the set truly was an overlap of real life and fictional creation — for example, after the camera cut, the food on the table could still be eaten, and the conversation could continue,” Shen Zhongmin says.\n\n\tComing to cinema from backgrounds in literature, journalism and contemporary art, the director views filmmaking as a particularly expansive medium. “Compared with these, cinema is perhaps more vast and complex, and also more ambiguous and multivalent,” she says. “It can borrow from, transform, and contain all the fields mentioned above.”\n\n\tThe film touches on themes of ecofeminism and social history without overt didacticism, favoring what Shen Zhongmin calls “a space for perception” over comprehensive explanation. “Sometimes, ambiguity may actually activate our senses and thinking more effectively,” she notes, adding, “I even think it’s perfectly fine if an audience member falls asleep in the cinema — because in sleep, our perception can still be stirred.”\n\n\tAbout the film’s Berlin world premiere, she says: “This film carries both the cultural specificity of China and the universal dimensions of human experience. I hope this premiere in Berlin can serve as a window through which Chinese local filmmakers can convey new reflections on history and the present, as well as a form of subjective lived experience with international audiences.”\n\n\tThe cast also includes Zhu Yufei, Kong Chuanzhen and Li Xiuqiong. “Shanghai Daughter” is produced by Twelve Oaks Film Art. Parallax Films is handling international sales. \n",

    "body": "\n\tChinese and Greater China cinema have a significant presence at the 2026 Berlin Film Festival and European Film Market, with multiple official selections and several market premieres being introduced to international buyers.\n\n\tHong Kong-based Golden Network Asia is bringing Jackie Chan‘s latest dramedy “Unexpected Family” to the market. The Chinese production, directed by Li Taiyan and featuring Chan alongside Peng Yuchang and Zhang Jianing, is currently playing theatrically across multiple territories including China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Cambodia and Myanmar. A North American release is scheduled for February.\n\t\n\n\tThe comedy-drama follows Zhong Bufan (Peng), a broke tenant struggling to survive in the city who finds himself living with an elderly landlord, Dad Ren (Chan), who mistakes him for his long-lost son. Also under the same roof are Su Xiaoyue (Zhang), a drifting tenant chasing her dreams; Jia Ye (Pan), a middle-aged housing agent; and Jin Zhengu (Li), a warm-hearted neighbor who treats everyone like family. The ensemble cast navigates Dad Ren’s unpredictable memory lapses until Bufan uncovers a long-buried secret. Han Sanping serves as executive producer, with production by Wuhan Legendary People Film & TV Art Co., China Film Group and Xiao Xiang Pictures.\n\n\n\tParallax International Sales is representing four officially selected films across different sections of the festival. In Panorama, Chinese filmmaker Agnis Shen Zhongmin makes her feature debut with “Shanghai Daughter,” a meditative work that blends fiction and documentary while drawing from the director’s family history. The film follows a Shanghai woman’s journey to a rubber farm in southwest China, where her late father was sent during the Cultural Revolution.\n\t\n\n\tIn the Forum section, Japanese choreographer and filmmaker Nao Yoshigai presents documentary “Masayume,” which chronicles her Zen training journey after losing her mental and physical balance at age 34. North American rights have been acquired by Kani Releasing.\n\n\tTwo Chinese short films round out Parallax’s lineup: Qu Jingkai’s “Kleptomania” in the Shorts Competition and Wang Beidi’s “Scorching” in Generation 14plus. “Kleptomania” is set on a frigid Harbin night and follows a boy trapped in a cycle of violence, while “Scorching” centers on Li Yan, who refuses to work at the local poultry factory and instead obsesses over hatching a stolen egg.\n\n\tParallax is also launching several new projects at EFM aimed at world premieres at major festivals later in 2026. These include “Crossing a Dawn,” a commercial romance directed by Zhao Badou and starring Ma Sichun and Edward Chen, produced by China’s MOMO Pictures.\n\n\tTaiwanese director Wang Yi-Ling’s debut feature “Running Wild” is described as an LGBTQ+ youth film that combines elements of crime escape and self-exploration. Wang’s short film “Towards the Sun” was previously selected for the Cinéfondation section at the 70th Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\tDocumentary “Coo Coo, Quark Quark” comes from Zhu Xin, whose “Vanishing Days” screened in Berlinale Forum in 2018. The project continues Zhu’s exploration of abstract concepts including memory, melancholy and poetry through documentary form.\n\n\tChina’s Rediance Films is handling world sales for Tobias Nölle and Loran Bonnardot’s Switzerland production “Tristan Forever,” screening in Panorama Dokumente, and represents mainland China rights for Anthony Chen’s Singapore film “We Are All Strangers,” which is in the main Berlin competition.\n\n\tAdditional Chinese titles in the official selection include Zhang Xinyang’s “Panda” from Singapore, Hong Kong and China in the Forum strand, and Tan Yucheng’s “The Girl” from China in Generation 14plus Short Films.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVeteran producer Bill Kong is bringing four commercial titles to the European Film Market through his Edko Films banner as Hong Kong makes a strong showing at the 2026 Berlin Film Festival with Singapore-Hong Kong-China co-production “Panda” selected for the Forum section.\n\n\tKong, whose credits include the Oscar-winning “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” and Zhang Yimou’s “Hero,” is presenting two sequels to the “Cold War” franchise — “Cold War 1994” and “Cold War 1995” — both directed by Longman Leung and produced by Kong alongside Ivy Ho. In “Cold War 1994,” M.B. Lee, head of the Organized Crime and Triad Bureau, becomes embroiled in a high-profile kidnapping case involving a wealthy family. As Lee navigates various circles, including the triads, the city’s elite and the British regime, he discovers that factions within the police force have their own agendas, seeking power, fame and fortune.\n\t\n\n\t“Cold War 1995” picks up the aftermath as the kidnapping case triggers a backlash from the British government, prompting MI6 agents to arrive from London to manage the fallout with the 1997 handover looming and various factions striving to secure their positions. \n\n\n\tThe films star Daniel Wu and Terrance Lau, with the first installment currently in post-production.\n\n\tEdko is also showcasing “Night King,” a comedy-drama from “A Guilty Conscience” director Jack Ng, starring Dayo Wong and Sammi Cheng as a divorced couple forced to reunite to save their failing nightclub. Set in 2012, the film follows Club EJ’s manager Foon as the once-glamorous venue undergoes a hostile takeover, with his cutthroat ex-wife Madame V arriving as the new CEO. Determined to modernize and breathe new life into the business, the estranged couple must join forces with the hostesses to make an epic last stand against a powerful conglomerate intent on shutting down Club EJ for good. The film is produced by Kong and Ho.\n\t\n\n\tRounding out Edko’s EFM lineup is “Unidentified Murder,” a comedy-drama about an influencer couple whose staged prank spirals out of control into real tragedy. A series of accidents, blackmail and extraterrestrial encounters somehow unveil a mysterious child disappearance from 25 years earlier. The film marks the directorial debut of Jack Lee Chun Kit, co-directed with writer-director Kwok Ka Hei, and stars Ling Man Lung, Renci Yeung and Peter Chan Charm Man.\n\n\tIn the festival’s Forum section, “Panda” follows four marginalized individuals wandering through Nanjing along the Yangtze River, grappling with trauma and seeking redemption.\n\n\tDirector Zhang Xinyang, who won Jia Zhangke’s Next Talent Project scholarship in 2019, describes the film as an exploration of “Chineseness” that draws on classical Chinese literature and magical realism. “Society alienates people, but beauty is a means for us to resist alienation,” Zhang says.\n\n\tThe Singapore-Hong Kong co-production is produced by Guo Xiao-Dong, Frank Yung and Shan Yinghao, with Singapore’s Levo Films handling production. The project has had a long development journey, winning best film script at the 2018 Changjiang River Youth Film Festival, best film project at the 2019 Chongqing Youth Film Festival and best pitching at the 2019 HiShorts! Film Festival before winning the Juries’ Choice Award in the work-in-progress section at Shanghai International Film Festival’s Project Market in 2024.\n\n\t“We are honored to be selected as the only Chinese film in the independent and visionary Berlinale Forum,” says producer Guo. “Zhang Xinyang is a shining star among Chinese post-’95 generation filmmakers.”\n\n\tLevo Films’ previous productions include “Caro Mio Ben” (“My Dear Beloved”), which screened at the 2017 Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival; “The Tree House,” which unspooled at the 2019 Locarno Film Festival; “The Men Who Wait,” which played at the 2021 Berlinale; and “Republic,” which screened at the 2023 Busan International Film Festival.\n\n\tShot in black and white and color, “Panda” features a cast including Zhang Xianmin, Elvis Yang, Chen Han, Lyu Jiahe and Zhang Ruyin, with cinematography by Carl Hou.\n\n\tThe Hong Kong presence at EFM also includes Entertaining Power Co.’s “Pass and Goal,” directed by Jil Wong Pak Kei and starring Gigi Leung as a financial consultant who helps train a youth soccer team. The family drama also features Rondi Chan, Sahal Zaman and Chan Charm Man, marking another example of the territory’s diverse genre offerings at the market.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Sinners,” “Frankenstein” and “One Battle After Another” took home the top prizes in the Feature Motion Pictures categories at the Make-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild (IATSE Local 706) Awards.\n\n\t“One Battle After Another” took home two awards winning best contemporary make-up (Heba Thorisdottir, Mandy Artusato) and best contemporary hair styling (Ahou Mofid, Gina Maria DeAngelis, Sacha Quarles).\n\n\n\tDuring her acceptance speech, Mofid said, “I am a child of two Iranian immigrants. I am first generation. I wanted to say this film meant so much to me. Paul Thomas Anderson wrote a film that was very close to me, and we’re fighting, all of us for freedoms: for freedom of speech, for all our rights, for all our women’s rights, for all of it.” She added, “Today, one of the biggest protests to Free Iran happened right outside…I want to say that a movie like this can move mountains. It can make people realize how crazy our world is, but community is where we are going to thrive.”\n\t\n\n\t“Sinners” also won two awards including best period and/or character make-up (Ken Diaz, Siân Richards, Ned Neidhardt, Allison LaCour, Lana Mora) and best period and/or character hair styling (Shunika Terry-Jennings, Elizabeth Robinson, Tene Wilder, Jove Edmond, Sherri B. Hamilton).\n\n\tTelevision winners included “The Studio,” “Palm Royale”, “Stranger Things: Season 5,” “Saturday Night Live,” “Dancing with the Stars” and “Skeleton Crew”.\n\n\tThe 13th Annual MUAHS Awards, presented by L’Oréal Groupe and Giovanni Eco Chic Beauty, were held at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel. The MUAHS Awards honor outstanding achievement in make-up and hair styling across motion pictures, television, music videos, and live theater. The show was also livestreamed to viewers worldwide.\n\t\n\n\tThe California Regional Theatrical Award was presented to “The Monkey King”, while the Broadway/International Theater Award went to “Frankenstein.” \n\n\tThe Commercial/Music Video Award was presented to Sarah Tanno and Phuong Tran for their makeup work on Lady Gaga and the “Abracadabra” video. \n\n\tThe MUAHS Awards were held before a  crowd of more than 850 attendees, including guild members, industry executives, and press.

Frankie Grande, host, performer, and social media personality, returned as the star host of the “Live from the Red Carpet” pre-show livestream. This spring, Grande will join the cast of “Titanique” on Broadway. Julie Socash, President of Local 706, presided over the ceremony.\n\n\tSocash addressed the crowd and said, “We are brothers, sisters and kin, connected as artists. The nominees tonight put forth dedication, collaboration and craftsmanship that go into every brush stroke, every wig, every transformation, you continue to deliver work that elevates storytelling across film, television, theater and live performance. You don’t just support the story. You help create the story. These awards exist because your work matters.”\n\n\tAmy Madigan received the prestigious Distinguished Artisan Award, from “Weapons” director Zach Cregger alongside Leo Satkovich, Melizah Wheat, and Jason Collins. During her speech, Madigan recognized the importance of the hair and makeup team. She said, “I’ve had a lot of different looks, and it always starts in the trailer, and that’s the most important moment of the whole day.” She went on to talk about playing “Aunt Gladys” which landed her a supporting actress Oscar nomination. “Gladys is somebody that when you see her look, which was pretty amazing to figure out. And we had a lot of time together and a lot of trying on things and not liking them and collaborating.” She added how on the page Cregger had described Gladys as “flamboyant. She has makeup and red hair.”  Madigan said, “We got it down to about three hours every day. But even when we get in that trailer so early in the morning, it was a joy. And you didn’t just slap that lipstick on, and you didn’t erase the eyebrows just by doing that. It was meticulous, and the eyeliner was meticulous.” \n\t\n\n\tThe Vanguard Award was bestowed upon Emmy-nominated make up artist Michael Johnston, a pioneering force in children’s and teen television for more than three decades. \n\n\tOscar-nominated and Emmy-winning make-up artist Greg Nelson, known for his work on “Raging Bull,” Michael Jackson’s “Thriller,” “Batman Returns” and “Death Becomes Her,” received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Make-Up.\n\n\tHairstylist Judy Alexander Cory, whose 60-year career ranges from Elvis Presley’s “Clambake” to the digital revolution of “The Matrix” and acclaimed classics such as “Forrest Gump” and “Hook,” received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Hair Stylists. \n\n\tThe In Memoriam tribute was performed by long-time Local 706 member Angie Wells.

    "body": "\n\tParamount Skydance accused ByteDance of engaging in “blatant infringement” of its intellectual property with its Seedance video and Seedream image generative AI platforms, alleging the Chinese internet giant is illegally ripping off IP including “South Park,” “Star Trek,” “The Godfather,” “Dora the Explorer” and more.\n\n\tThe media company sent a cease-and-desist letter Saturday to ByteDance, a copy of which was obtained by Variety, demanding it discontinue the alleged infringement. The letter from Gabriel Miller, Paramount Skydance’s head of intellectual property, was addressed to ByteDance CEO Liang Rubo.\n\t\n\n\tThat came after Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter Friday to ByteDance asserting the company’s AI platforms are making available “a pirated library of Disney’s copyrighted characters from Star Wars, Marvel, and other Disney franchises, as if Disney’s coveted intellectual property were free public domain clip art.” “ByteDance’s virtual smash-and-grab of Disney’s IP is willful, pervasive, and totally unacceptable,” David Singer, a partner at Jenner & Block, wrote on behalf of Disney.\n\n\n\tSeedance is the latest AI video system to set off alarms across Hollywood. After videos generated by ByteDance’s Seedance 2.0 went viral this week — including one of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting on a rooftop (pictured above) — the Motion Picture Association condemned ByteDance on Thursday, calling on the company to immediately cease its infringing conduct. Actors union SAG-AFTRA and the Human Artistry Campaign, a coalition of artists’ rights groups affiliated with Hollywood unions, also spoke out against the ByteDance AI model.\n\t\n\n\tParamount’s Miller, in the letter to ByteDance, wrote that “much of the content that the Seed Platforms produce contains vivid depictions of Paramount’s famous and iconic franchises and characters, which are protected under copyright law, trademark law, and the law of unfair competition (among other doctrines).” The content in the AI-generated images and videos produced by ByteDance’s platforms “is often indistinguishable, both visually and audibly,” from Paramount’s copyrighted characters and stories.\n\n\tReps for ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.\n\n\tAccording to Miller’s letter, Paramount properties including “South Park,” “SpongeBob SquarePants,” “Star Trek,” “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” “The Godfather,” “Dora the Explorer” and “Avatar: The Last Airbender” have “all been repeatedly infringed by the Seed Platforms’ production and subsequent public performance and distribution of these images and videos.” Moreover, with the recent release of the Seedance 2.0 video generation tool, “ByteDance’s infringing activities appear not only to be continuing but becoming more prevalent and the unlawful outputs more widely disseminated,” Miller wrote.\n\n\tIn the letter, Paramount Skydance demanded that “ByteDance immediately take all necessary steps to (i) prevent violations of our intellectual property rights by ensuring that our content is not used or created by ByteDance or the Seed Platforms going forward, and (ii) remove all infringing instances of Paramount’s content from ByteDance’s platforms and systems.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCatherine Laga’aia, who is set to make her breakout as the titular character in Disney’s upcoming live-action “Moana,” has been tapped to lead the Australian Gen-Z thriller “Crashout.”\n\n\tDeadhouse Films unveiled the casting for the project at Berlin’s European Film Market. The film marks Laga’aia’s first project after landing the headline role in Disney’s adaptation.\n\n\t“Crashout” follows three high school graduates who become stranded on a remote stretch of highway after a fatal car accident. In a desperate bid to conceal their unintentional crime, they fabricate a found footage film. The darkly comic satirical thriller explores themes of self-preservation and narrative control through a contemporary youth perspective.\n\t\n\n\tThe film is written and directed by Nick Annas, with Helen Tuck and Enzo Tedeschi producing for Deadhouse Films. Executive producers are Deanne Weir of WeirAnderson Films, along with Bobby Romia and Tianna Roberts of newly formed Atypical Originals. Stephanie Pringle and Alison Fowler of Chicken and Chips Casting are handling the casting.\n\n\n\tAnnas, now 19, wrote the screenplay when he was just 17, ”mostly in my childhood bedroom or the back of my high school classrooms,” the writer-director said. “Welcoming Catherine to lead the film in her first project after ‘Moana’ feels pretty unreal. ‘Crashout’ will be a very different ride, but Catherine’s fearless pivot is exactly the bold energy the film is fueled by. I couldn’t imagine anyone better to be stuck in a forest with.”\n\n\t“Crashout” is scheduled to begin production in Australia in March. \n\t\n\n\tLaga’aia is represented by the Agency at AIPA, Venture Entertainment Partners, CAA and Jackoway Austen Tyerman.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSince arriving on the world cinema stage with the deeply personal docudrama “Bye Bye Africa” (1999), Chadian auteur Mahamat-Saleh Haroun has been at the forefront of a generation of filmmakers who have landed African cinema squarely on the map. Despite emigrating to France in the 1980s, at the height of Chad’s devastating civil war, he’s continued to return to his Central African roots, calling it his “duty” to document life in his native country. \n\t\n\n\tA fixture at the Cannes Film Festival, where he scooped a Special Jury Prize for “A Screaming Man” (2010), and has three times competed for the Palme d’Or, the director will vie for his first Golden Bear at this year’s Berlin Film Festival with “Soumsoum, the Night of the Stars.” It’s a story of sisterhood that follows a young woman troubled by haunting visions who befriends a village outcast.\n\n\n\tVariety spoke to Haroun about his latest.\n\n\n\t“Soumsoum, the Night of the Stars” was filmed in the Ennedi Desert, a striking, remote region in northeastern Chad. How did that place inspire your movie?\n\n\tIt reminded me of all these legends and childhood tales that I grew up with. When I was a child, there were people who [were said to] become animals during the night. They became foxes, hyenas, lions. All that was so exciting to me. There are a lot of stories and legends about the Ennedi Desert. I saw that landscape and then I started writing the story. \n\n\tWhat do you find so special about the region?\n\n\tIn this part of Chad, they discovered the [fossilized remains of the] first human being on Earth. I think the whole human race belongs to this place. All of us are migrants — we moved from there. I wanted to create a kind of mythology about this place and this story, which is a tale of the beginning of our world. It is a Biblical story. It belongs to the beginning of humanity.\n\t\n\n\tThe film stars newcomer Maïmouna Miawama as Kellou, a very spirited, headstrong, determined young woman. How did you know she was right for the role?\n\n\tWhen she came for the casting, I loved the way she moved in the scene — there was a kind of grace. We started talking about her life. She was a little melancholic. She lost her brother when she was a child, and she started crying. I was so touched. She is someone living with these absences. Having the awareness of something like that was so powerful for me. \n\n\tYou emigrated to France more than four decades ago. What’s your relationship like with Chad?\n\n\tI’m back in Chad three or four times a year. I’m always in contact. I think it’s very important to tell stories from the inside, [not] from abroad. That’s why I try to be there as much as possible. Sometimes people say, “It’s a long time you have been in France, but you look just like someone who lives here.” I love that. That means I’m not lying in my films.\n\n\tYou’ve described it as your “duty” to make movies in Chad. Why?\n\n\tMy cinema has become a kind of archive. A lot of the places I have shot in my movies have disappeared. Everything is being destroyed, because of modernity. I have to preserve the past. If not, there is no history. It’s like building a kind of memory of this country. \n\n\tIs that what inspires you to continue?\n\n\tWe need to tell all these stories, because if not, no one will be there to tell them. It’s a kind of sadness, always. But cinema brings something like brightness and hope. We need that.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTurkish cinema, despite being held back by economic and political constraints, looks poised for a global breakthrough this year. Its milestone Berlin 2026 contingent — comprising three feature film premieres, two of which are competing for the Golden Bear — kicks off the campaign.\n\n\tFor years, Turkey’s government, headed by authoritarian President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been muzzling filmmakers’ voices through censorship laws and state funding constraints on projects that didn’t seem to toe the political line. On top of that, the value of the Turkish lira has been plunging to record lows as inflation rises, which in turn impacts local production costs.\n\t\n\n\tBut Turkish directors, who often mount their productions outside the country, “Have lots of energy; they never give up” says former Antalya Film Festival artistic director Başak Emre, who now heads the Istanbul Film Festival’s revamped co-production platform Meetings on the Bridge.  \n\n\n\tSpearheading Turkey’s Berlin contingent are the two competition titles, “Yellow Letters” and “Salvation” (pictured above), both by name auteurs who were able to find financing in Europe and elsewhere. The directors certainly didn’t shy away from politics in their films.\n\n\tBerlin-born İlker Çatak is at the Berlinale with “Yellow Letters,” which, unlike his last film — the Oscar-nominated, Germany-set “The Teachers’ Lounge” — takes place entirely amid political repression in Turkey, even though it was shot in Germany. The film stars Turkish actors Özgü Namal (Derya) and Tansu Biçer (Aziz) as an artist couple whose marriage implodes after they lose their jobs due to their political views, reflecting the country’s reality.\n\t\n\n\tÇatak is uncertain whether “Yellow Letters” will ever be released in Turkey’s cinemas. “That’s a big question mark,” he says. But the director also points out that if the culture ministry censors his film, “this will generate attention [for it] in its own right.”\n\n\tEmin Alper says he was “blacklisted” from getting government funding for “Salvation” after making his 2022 drama “Burning Days,” which reflected rising authoritarian populism and mounting homophobia — and not just in his country. His latest work, which is set, and shot, in a remote Turkish mountain village, revolves on a land dispute rooted in the conflict over rights for Turkey’s Kurdish minority. It’s a potential political hot potato, but Alper is hopeful that “Salvation,” which has Turkish distribution attached, will make it past censors. He notes that tensions between the government and rebel Kurdish group PKK have eased, and “the atmosphere on that front is a bit more relaxed,” he says.\n\n\tAlso set in a Turkish village is sophomore director Banu Sıvacı’s more intimate 2026 Berlin Forum title “Hear the Yellow.” In the drama, a young woman named Suna returns to her parental home in a rural area “riven with cracks caused by drought,” that make it “as fragile as the relationships between the local people,” says the synopsis. Sıvacı, who debuted with “The Pigeon” in Berlinale Generation in 2018, was able to finance “Hear the Yellow” entirely in Turkey.\n\n\t“There’s a new generation coming, and there’s kind of a burst of production, despite the difficulties,” says Alper. \n\n\tÇatak agrees: “There is a tremendous amount of talent in Turkey and great stories coming out, which is often is the case in societies where there are lots of tensions.” \n\n\tIndeed, there is a promising crop of finished films from prominent Turkish auteurs that will soon hit the festival circuit. Expect Yeşim Ustaoğlu’s long-gestating seventh feature, “Left Over,” a road movie about a poetess who leaves her Istanbul home to go back to her family roots, to surface as well a new doc that she’s made. Ustaoğlu broke out with 1999’s “Journey to the Sun,” which competed in Berlin.\n\n\tGürcan Keltek, who in 2024 made a splash in Locarno with atmospheric horror film “New Dawn Fades,” has completed “Horde,” which he shot during COVID lockdown. Ferit Karahan, who was at Berlin in 2021 with “Brother’s Keeper,” has picture-locked his “Djinn Wedding,” which looks at family’s fate over three generations.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Turkey’s longtime Cannes darling Nuri Bilge Ceylan (“Winter Sleep”) will be back on set this year with a father-daughter drama (details are being kept under wraps). Kaan Müjdeci, who won the Grand Jury Prize at Venice in 2014 with “Sivas” and subsequently made “Iguana Tokyo” and the TV series “Hamlet,” will be back with “Dreamgirl.” The pic centers on a young Roma girl who escapes from a small town in Eastern Anatolia, where she is not welcome. And Berkun Oya, creator of hit Turkish shows “Ethos” and “Cici,” will shoot previously announced “Merci Charlotte,” starring Juliette Binoche as a French woman who adopts a Turkish boy.\n",

It’s unfortunate that the film vilified that, and it’s f***ing wrong.”\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Producer Edward Saxon echoed Levine's sentiments ... telling THR the filmmakers didn't think they'd upset the transgender community because they didn't consider Buffalo Bill trans.\n      \n    \n          They felt he just was a sick individual with an \"aberrant personality.\" However, Saxon admits he feels the team wasn't sensitive enough to sterotypes.\n      \n    \n          He goes on, \"There’s regret, but it didn’t come from any place of malice. It actually came from a place of seeing this guy. We all had dear friends and family who were gay. We thought it would just be very clear that Buffalo Bill adapts different things from society, from a place of an incredibly sick pathology.”\n      \n    \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n    \n          BTW ...

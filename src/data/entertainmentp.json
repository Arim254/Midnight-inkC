    "body": "\n\tAfter testing the interest of sports fans in short-form content, Disney aims to bring brief bursts to a broader audience.\n\n\tThe company aims to bring so-called “microcontent” to Disney+ in 2026, it announced Wednesday at CES, and in doing so joins a parade of traditional media purveyors working harder to court younger consumers who have grown more accustomed to swiping through Tik Toks, Reels and other attenuated attempts to entertain. \n\t\n\n\tDisney first put a stake in short-attention-span theater with “verts,” or  short video vignettes placed on its new ESPN streaming app that might include important game moments or pieces of commentary or analysis from various sports personalities. Fans are able to exert more control over a feed through whichi they can scroll or swipe, and the videos are tailored to the individual interests of users.\n\n\n\tDisney indicated it intends to expand the use of short-form video across both news and entertainment, betting that such features will make Disney+ a daily destination for users who want to get updates on their favorite content areas. There have already been some intriguing experiments. In 2025, ABC News launched a daily short-form show for Disney+ called “What You Need to Know” that is hosted each weekday by Rachel Scott or James Longman. \n\n\tOthers are courting similar engagement. Procter & Gamble, one of the nation’s largest advertisers, this month is launching “The Golden Pear Affair,” a 50-episode “microsoap” that will be made available initially via social media and, later, a bespoke mobile app. The idea, say backers of the new program, is to reach people who are used to giving content a swipe on a mobile phone, rather than those who sit back and passively swoon in front of a more traditional screen. Spanish-language giant TelevisaUnivision has been wooing advertisers to a growing series of sudsy “microdramas” that emulate many of the elements of the company’s popular telenovelas. The company recently worked with the Dentsu ad agency to create a bespoke Spanish-language microdrama for retailer JCPenney. \n\t\n\n\tDisney also made outreach to Madison Avenue Wednesday, unveiling a “brand portal” that will allow clients to measure the impact of ad campaigns on Disney properties using data from Affinity Solutions, CINT, EDO, Innovid and VideoAmp.  “We’re empowering advertisers to move smarter and faster to reach their goals, with data and measurement guiding their strategy,” said Dana McGraw, Disney’s senior vice president of data and measurement science, in a statement. The company also unveiled a new “impact metric” that it said would offer insight into goals such as consumer attention, reach, brand health, search and actions taken by consumers following exposure to commercials.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNow that Miley Cyrus has said she would love to do music for the second season of “Heated Rivalry,” one of the show’s stars, Connor Storrie, has a confession to make.\n\n\tStorrie, who plays Russian hockey player Ilya in the queer romance series, tells me he was only 13 when he dressed as Cyrus for Halloween.\n\n\tAs Hannah Montana?\n\n\n\tNope, it was Cyrus from her very controversial MTV VMAs performance with Robin Thicke in 2013. “Not to expose myself a little bit, but…it was a big cultural moment at the time,” Storrie told me Wednesday morning after he and “Abbott Elementary” star Janelle James announced this year’s SAG/Actor Awards nominations in Los Angeles. “Me and my best friend — I was Miley Cyrus for Halloween and he was Robin Thicke.”\n\t\n\n\t“I was in middle school,” he continued. “I think those photos don’t exist anymore. I want to plant the seed for people to try to find them, but I don’t think they will.” (Turns out they do. Fans were quick to find one after Variety posted a video of my interview on social media.)\n\n\tCyrus was blasted for her appearance at the VMAs for not only twerking on Thicke during their set, but she was also accused of cultural appropriation.\n\n\tUnlike Storrie’s YouTube videos from around that time that have become quite popular these days, Storrie doesn’t believe there’s any footage of him as Cyrus. As James said, “That’s probably a good thing.”\n\n\tLooking into the camera, Storrie said, “So, Miley Cyrus, know that I was you at the MTV Movie Awards.”\n\n\n\tIt’s been a meteoric rise for Storrie and his “Heated Rivalry” co-star Hudson Williams ever since HBO Max debuted the first two episodes of the show over Thanksgiving weekend. HBO Max acquired the series from Canadian streamer Crave.\n\t\n\n\tMemes and gifs of the show’s most explicit sex scenes and other moments from the episodes quickly went viral.\n\n\tIn mid-December, Storrie told me he decided to do his self-tape audition shirtless. “I was like, ‘If we’re doing a show that heavily involves sex,’” he said. “So I took off my shirt, even though it didn’t say that. I had my shirt off the entire time because I was like, ‘If we’re doing that, you all have to see what these people look like naked.’”\n\n\tStorrie has signed with mega talent agency CAA. He and Hudson will present at the Golden Globes on Sunday. Storrie will make his late-night talk show debut on “Late Night with Seth Meyers on Jan. 12.\n\n\tSadly, because “Heated Rivalry” is a fully Canadian-financed production, it’s ineligible for Emmys and Actor Awards.\n\n\t“Do I think it would be cool to get that recognition for the show?” Storrie asked. “Yeah, 100%. Do I think the show has a level of quality that I think will get recognized? 100%. But also, awards are a cherry on top of the cake, which is just being able to do what you want. We all make things to be seen, so when you get reinforcement that things are being watched, that’s kind of all you need, especially with something like this that had little promise going into it.”\n\n\tJames said she watched “Heated Rivalry” about three weeks ago when her assistant recommended it. “What I’m thinking about his excellent Russian accent that he does,” she said when I alluded to his risqué sex scenes. “I’m thinking about his characterization. I’m thinking that he is adorable, and he looks like a leading man, and I’m excited to see where he goes next.\n\n\tAdditional reporting by Kennedy French.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tClassic anime outside of Hayao Miyazaki’s work has never really made serious inroads with the Academy voters during Oscar season, but Crunchyroll is looking to change that with “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle.” The feature shattered box office records, becoming the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time, earning $682 million worldwide. It also landed a Golden Globe nomination for motion picture — animated. \n\n\t“Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” follows Tanjiro Kamado and the Demon Slayer Corps in a battle against Muzan Kibutsuji and the Upper Moons inside his hideout, known as the Infinity Castle.\n\t\n\n\tThe animated feature, produced by Ufotable, blends both 2D and CG styles. \n\n\tDirector Haruo Sotozaki explains that the characters were animated by hand, and one of the main challenges was “marrying the 2D frames within the CG background and environments.” Speaking via a translator, he adds, “It was one of the hardest marriages we’ve had to take on.”\n\n\tMatching the 2D animation to 3D back grounds required an additional step in the production pipeline.“We would send the key frames to the 3D team,” Sotozaki says. “They would try to match those key frame animations to the surrounding 3D environments.”\n\n\tOnce the match was achieved, the frames were sent back to the animators to polish each one.\n\n\tAs far as the story is concerned, Ufotable president and chief director Hikaru Kondo reveals that the film was originally over three hours long after storyboarding. However, even at that length, there was no clear “overall groove of what the journey was.”\n\t\n\n\tFor the animators and the studio, it was crucial to ensure emotional investment for the audience, given how beloved the franchise, story and characters are.\n\n\tThe key was not to rush the process — the film took over three and a half years to make. “We’ve been building up to this moment from the ‘Unwavering Resolve’ arc, laying it down for the fandom and theaudience to really buy into what is happening in the ‘Infinity Castle,’” Kondo says.\n\n\tIt was a massive undertaking, but the team had a blueprint.\n\n\tThey had faced a similar challenge when creating “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba — The Movie: Mugen Train.” “There were a lot of questions about how you can take all of this information and put it into a single film. I think that learning has been applied to ‘Infinity Castle,’” Kondo says.\n\n\tCinematographer Yuichi Terao played a key role in balancing the visual spectacle of action sequences and battles with an engaging story.\n\n\tOnce the emotional backbone was established, it was also about creating an “epic space.” Everything had to take place within the Infinity Castle itself. The Infinity Castle first appeared in the “Unwavering Resolve” arc of the TV series, but now the studio had to create something even bigger.\n\n\tAmid the action and drama, there’s also destruction, which Terao says gives fans something new to experience. “We were getting all of the destructive effects and the physics to work this hybrid effect that we’ve designed. As a member of the audience, it’s a fun experience, but we all collectively as the studio had to work together to put it onto the screen,” he says.\n\n\tCrunchyroll remains hopeful that “Demon Slayer” will connect with Oscar voters and bring greater anime representation to the Academy Awards. Mitchel Berger, Crunchyroll exec VP of global commerce. has been on the FYC trail. He notes that being part of the awards conversation is a way to elevate the art form. “It’s a beautiful piece of artwork,” he says of ‘Demon Slayer.” “The craftsmanship, the care, and the love that goes into this — just being able to expose people to that is a wonderful thing.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatt Damon appeared on the latest episode of the “New Heights” podcast and revealed that he cut his weight down so much for Christopher Nolan‘s “The Odyssey” that at one point during filming he weighed as much as he did in high school. Damon reunites with Nolan after “Interstellar” and “Oppenheimer” to lead the epic adventure film as Odysseus.\n\n\t“I had a beard like yours for like a year,” Damon told podcast co-host Jason Kelce (via Entertainment Weekly). “I was in really good shape. I lost a lot of weight. [Nolan] wanted me lean but strong. Just because of this other thing that I did with my doctor, I stopped eating gluten. I used to walk around at between 185 and 200, and I did that whole movie at 167. And I haven’t been that light since high school. So it was a lot of training and a really strict diet.”\n\t\n\n\tIt’s a far cry from when Damon has had to pack on the pounds for his characters. The Oscar nominee gained 30 pounds for 2009’s “The Informant” by “eating like crazy and drinking dark beer,” he told EW at the time. “Between meals on set, I’d eat a No. 1 Value Meal at McDonald’s and then Doritos on top of it. It was absolute heaven.”\n\n\n\tExpanding on “The Odyssey,” Damon marveled over how Nolan achieved the feat of making the first Hollywood feature film to be entirely shot with Imax cameras.\n\n\t“Imax cameras are really loud. It sounds like a blender, like a Cuisinart in your face when the camera’s close to you. So there’s never been these dialogue [scenes in Imax],” Damon said. “We couldn’t have this conversation with a normal Imax camera because you wouldn’t be able to hear us. They built this giant thing around the Imax for those dialogue scenes and a system of mirrors so your eye line would be close to the camera and you could talk to the other actor. The amount of work that went into figuring out how to do [that], because he wanted to do 100 percent Imax and he did it!”\n\t\n\n\t“The Odyssey” cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema previously revealed to Empire magazine that he shot Imax test footage of a kid reading David Bowie’s “Sound And Vision” lyrics to prove whether or not Imax film cameras were advanced enough to record dialogue. A new Imax film casing called a “blimp” was created to significantly reduce the noise Imax cameras produce.\n\n\t“The blimp system is a game-changer,” Nolan told Empire. “You can be shooting a foot from [an actor’s] face while they’re whispering and get usable sound. What that opens up are intimate moments of performance on the world’s most beautiful format.”\n\n\tDamon shot “The Odyssey” around the world in locations such as Greece, Iceland and Morocco and said he was stunned by the scope of Nolan’s on-location ambitions. \n\n\t“We would get there and I’d just start laughing,” Damon said. “I’d be like, ‘Nobody has any business shooting here! Of course he wants to shoot here. That tracks.’ He has such a great crew. His crew is so badass. And everybody just maxed out on that movie, and we made all of our days. We actually finished ahead of schedule. It was an awesome experience.”\n\n\t“The Odyssey” opens in theaters July 17. Watch Damon’s full interview on the “New Heights” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tInspiration can come from the most unlikely of places. For husband and wife filmmakers Shane Brady and Emily Zercher, it happened while they were on hold with the FBI.\n\n\tWhile buying a house during the pandemic, the pair was scammed into sending a down payment to a hacker. Once notified, they immediately took action — although as Zercher tells it, they wanted to go much further.\n\n\t“We were on hold with the FBI fraud department, which is something that they tell you to do,” she says. “They have hold music that will drive you insane. Shane’s on hold with the bank, and we had the actual hacker’s address and full name on the receipt of our wire. So I knew who it was. I knew their address. Because I was on hold for way too long with this terrible music, I announced that I have the hacker’s address: I will just go there myself, and I will hack him up with a machete. I realized in hindsight it may not be the smartest thing, but it created the seed of vengeance that was planted.”\n\t\n\n\tThe duo put their creativity to work, and the result is “Hacked: A Double Entendre of Rage Fueled Karma,” which recently wrapped a festival run that included screenings at FilmQuest, Celluloid Screams and Soho Horror Fest. The film, which follows the plight of the fictional Rumble family in a based-on-reality setup, is kinetic, cathartic and filled with snappy in-jokes and an infectious “let’s put on a show” energy that sprung from the project’s development.\n\n\n\t“We found out how many other people had been victims where their money had been stolen,” Brady says. “I’m sure you get those texts daily that say, ‘If you don’t pay this toll right now, we got you.'”\n\t\n\n\t“We also learned that when people hack into other people’s stuff, they will never be prosecuted for it because it’s a fingerprintless crime,” Zercher adds. “So not only does it happen all the time and everyone is upset about it, everybody’s hands truly are tied.”\n\n\tIn addition to a script filled with flights of fancy and dreams of delivering ultraviolet justice, the filmmaking evokes the loss of control the couple faced after the incident. Brady, who edited the film, says he carefully considered the feature’s flow.\n\n\t“The rough cut that I showed a lot of my friends was an hour and 55 minutes,” he says. “Across the board, they all had a version of the note: ‘This feels like a 90-minute movie.’ So I literally set a timeline marker to 90 and started hacking away. I felt like the movie started getting richer and becoming more … I don’t take offense when there’s a Letterboxd review calling it ‘The TikTok movie.’ It’s fast-paced, it’s insane, but I take it as a compliment for two reasons. Number one is that the goal audience is the younger generation and those dealing with technology. Furthermore, by leaning into this frenetic-paced world, that’s what Emily and I were dealing with. We felt crazy. We felt insane. And everywhere we looked for help or closure, it was a joke. Then you make a movie that’s a joke.”\n\n\t“Hacked” has recently been acquired for distribution by S&R Films, and the pair is excited for larger audiences to get the same jolt as at festival screenings. Ultimately, Brady says that the film has helped him to process and move past the robbery.\n\n\t“I’ve been working diligently in my life to embrace suffering as a gift,” he says. “‘Right now, this is very bad, and what is happening is very bad, but maybe there’s a reason for it.’ Not to say that our future is preordained or our destiny is written in the stars, but perhaps the suffering that we went through is meant to allow us to bond with other people who have gone through similar things. Perhaps by us killing ourselves with work to make this movie a reality, it will help somebody else who got their money stolen, and they’re never going to get it back. It’ll help somebody through a really crappy day, and they want to put on a movie where they get to have that release and have fun and not take themselves so seriously.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “Hacked” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tLawyers for Live Nation and Ticketmaster are calling for the dismissal of a lawsuit brought against them last September by the Federal Trade Commission and seven states in a motion filed Jan. 6.\n\n\tThe companies claim that the suit is an “egregious instance of agency overreach” and that much of the FTC’s case against them, which cites the Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act of 2016, is a misapplication of that law.\n\n\n\tThe lawsuit claims the companies enabled scalpers to purchase beyond their advertised ticket purchasing limits, allowing for the resale of tickets at steep markups far above face value. \n\t\n\n\t“This statute is designed to help ticket issuers like Ticketmaster combat ticket harvesting and scalping, ensuring that tickets are accessible to genuine fans,” their lawyers wrote. “Plaintiffs now ask this Court to take the unprecedented step of applying this law against a ticket issuer for its operation of a resale platform.”\n\n\tThe companies later admit that despite “Ticketmaster’s efforts, scalpers persist in using technology to step in front of fans to obtain an outsized share of tickets and resell them at marked up prices in a multibillion-dollar resale market. For instance, brokers create hundreds or thousands of Ticketmaster accounts to buy more tickets without exceeding the per-account ticket limit. Scalpers also use software that allows them to log into multiple accounts at the same time to bypass screening and verification measures,” they wrote. The motion asserts that Ticketmaster is the intermediary of person-to-person resales, not a reseller itself.\n\t\n\n\tLive Nation is already facing another federal case, with arguably bigger stakes, after being sued by the Biden administration’s Department of Justice for having a supposed monopoly on the live events business. “We allege that Live Nation relies on unlawful, anticompetitive conduct to exercise its monopolistic control over the live events industry in the United States at the cost of fans, artists, smaller promoters, and venue operators,” then-Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement announcing that suit.\n\n\tAs Variety previously reported, Live Nation’s stock price increased dramatically in the wake of Trump’s re-election in Nov. 2024. “We believe at least some parts of the case reflect a much more interventionist philosophy than you’d expect from a Republican administration,” said Live Nation CFO Joe Berchtold at the time. Live Nation’s stock price was $144 at market close Wednesday.\n\n\tNotably, in May of last year Live Nation voted to add Trump appointee and veteran Republican Richard Grenell, who currently oversees the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, to its board. Trump’s recent rebranding of the Center has resulted in several canceled performances.\n\n\tGrenell’s joining of Live Nation’s board followed Trump’s Executive Order in March that directed the FTC to “rigorously enforce” the BOTS Act in collaboration with State Attorneys General.\n\n\tA hearing on yesterday’s Live Nation/Ticketmaster recent motion is scheduled for Feb. 19.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tParamount+ is expanding its push into live sports with the launch of a sprawling UFC fight archive. The new content lineup includes access to more than 1,400 bouts, highlights and event programs ahead of the platform’s first-ever live UFC broadcast later this month.\n\n\tThe newly unveiled UFC library spans more than two decades of fight history, with select main cards and curated “best of” compilations dating from the early 2000s through 2025. Organized into  collections, the archive is designed to let fans easily jump between eras, fighters and finishes.\n\n\n\tAmong the featured collections are full UFC numbered events from multiple decades, a “Legends” section spotlighting career-defining bouts from icons like Georges St-Pierre, Chuck Liddell, Anderson Silva, Ronda Rousey and Brock Lesnar, as well as collections centered on current champions and a knockout-heavy “KO City” hub. The archive also includes Spanish- and Portuguese-language fight programs, with additional content slated to roll out on a regular basis.\n\n\tThe timing is deliberate. The archive launch serves as a runway to UFC’s live debut on Paramount+ with UFC 324: Gaethje vs. Pimblett, airing Saturday, Jan. 24 from T-Mobile Arena. The event will feature former interim lightweight champion and BMF titleholder Justin Gaethje against fan favorite Paddy Pimblett, alongside bouts involving UFC Women’s Bantamweight Champion Kayla Harrison and Hall of Famer Amanda Nunes.\n\n\tThe live debut also marks a significant shift in UFC’s distribution strategy, signaling the end of traditional pay-per-view for UFC events in the U.S. and Latin America and positioning Paramount+ as the sport’s primary streaming home in those markets. All UFC content on the platform — both live and archived — is available to subscribers across Paramount+’s Essential and Premium tiers.\n\n\n\tCheck out UFC’s new fight archive here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney’s live-action “Tangled” movie is once again moving ahead with Teagan Croft (“Titans,” “True Spirit”) and Milo Manheim (“Zombies,” “Dancing with the Stars”) landing the coveted lead roles of Rapunzel and Flynn Rider.\n\n\tThe hit 2010 animated movie, “Tangled,” tells the tale of Rapunzel, a magically long-haired princess who is eventually rescued from her secluded tower by an outlaw named Flynn Rider. The film, which featured Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi in the respective voice parts, grossed over $591 million worldwide and spawned the 2012 short film “Tangled Ever After” and the successful Disney Channel series “Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Greatest Showman” director Michael Gracey will helm the live-action adaptation. Jennifer Kaytin Robinson (“Do Revenge,” “Thor: Love and Thunder,” “I Know What You Did Last Summer”) penned the screenplay. Kristin Burr (“Freakier Friday,” “Cruella”) is producing, and Lucy Kitada will executive produce. Further production details and a release date have not yet been announced.\n\n\n\tCroft is best known for her role as Rachel Roth a.k.a. Raven on the DC series, “Titans.” The rising Australian actress also starred in the Netflix movie “True Spirit,” portraying Aussie sailor Jessica Watson, who attempted solo global circumnavigation at just 16 years old.\n\n\tManheim is already well-known to Disney faithful after starring in the long-running “Zombies” franchise. The multi-talented performer, who is also the son of Emmy and Golden Globe winner Camryn Manheim, finished in second place on season 27 of “Dancing with the Stars.”\n\t\n\n\t“Tangled” — which was first reported as being in early development in December 2024 — is the latest of Disney’s animated movies to get the live-action treatment, following “The Lion King,” “Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin,” “Mulan,” “Dumbo,” “The Little Mermaid,” “Snow White” and “Lilo & Stitch,” the last of which was the first movie to gross $1 billion in 2025. The live-action “Moana,” starring Dwayne Johnson as the tattooed demigod Maui and newcomer Catherine Laga‘aia as the titular princess, hits theaters on July 10.\n\n\tThe “Tangled” live action project had been previously put on hold in April after the lukewarm box office for “Snow White.”\n\n\tTHR first reported the casting news. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” is ringing in the new year with three new episodes in January, led by first-time hosts Finn Wolfhard, Teyana Taylor and Alexander Skarsgård. They’ll be joined by respective musical guests A$AP Rocky, Geese and Cardi B.\n\n\tOn Jan. 17, Wolfhard will make his “SNL” debut a couple of weeks after the series finale of Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” on which he has starred since 2016. Rocky, who starred in Spike Lee’s “Highest 2 Lowest,” has his fourth album, “Don’t Be Dumb,” dropping Jan. 16.\n\t\n\n\tTaylor will command Studio 8H on Jan. 24 while on her awards campaign for “One Battle After Another,” in which she stars opposite Leonardo DiCaprio. She has already received Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Actor Award (formerly SAG) nominations for her performance in the Paul Thomas Anderson film. Brooklyn band Geese will make a stop on their world tour in celebration of its 2025 album “Getting Killed.”\n\n\n\tSkarsgård will host “SNL” on Jan. 31 to promote his film “Pillion,” out Feb. 6, as well as his role in the Charli xcx movie “The Moment,” premiering on Jan. 30. Cardi B will make her second appearance on the series, performing songs from her new album, “Am I the Drama?”\n\n\tWolfhard’s episode will mark the first telecast after the emotional exit of Bowen Yang, who left the show after seven seasons. Yang’s departure came after a cast shakeup that saw series vets Heidi Gardner and Ego Nwodim leave the show, while new faces such as Jeremy Culhane, Kam Patterson and Veronika Slowikowska joined the ensemble.\n\n\t“SNL” airs on Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET on NBC.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRoku founder, chairman and CEO Anthony Wood has some big predictions about the pending impact of generative AI on Hollywood — including that the first 100% AI-generated “hit movie” will debut within the next three years.\n\n\t“I have no idea if there’s an investment bubble, but I know that AI is going to be huge, and it already is,” Wood said during a headliner conversation with Variety‘s co-editor-in-chief Cynthia Littleton at the Variety Entertainment Summit at CES Wednesday. “So it’s going to affect lots of different industries, but in our industry, it’s going to lower the cost of content production. I predict within the next three years, we’ll see the first 100% AI-generated hit movie, for example.”\n\t\n\n\tWood founded Roku in 2008 and has since grown the tech company into the world’s largest streaming platform, with more than 50% of broadband households using its service. According to Wood, Roku processes 40% of all streaming flows in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Latin America and the U.K.\n\n\tWith a business that big on the line, Wood is embracing AI’s potential for streamlining streaming.\n\n\t“The way I think about it is in three buckets,” Wood said during Variety‘s CES summit at the Aria in Las Vegas. “One is just business operations. How do we just make our business more efficient by adopting AI? We do that aggressively. I think companies that don’t do that are going to be at a serious competitive disadvantage; their operating expenses will be higher than other competitors. So we’re very focused on just being more efficient. Second is we use AI throughout our product: targeted ads, recommendations, these are all AI based technologies. That’s traditionally machine-learning-based AI, but we’re moving all that to generative AI. It’s like the next generation.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the full conversation with Roku’s Anthony Wood:\n\n\tOutside of the positive potential for business operations, Wood concurs with a widely held industry opinion: The biggest way generative AI will impact the media industry is by lowering the cost of content creation.\n\n\t“I think people underestimate how dramatic that’s going to be,” Wood said. “I mean, obviously I don’t think people are going to get replaced. Humans are still the creative force behind creating content and hit shows, but the cost is going to come down dramatically, and that’s going to change a lot of companies’ business models. So I’m focused on, how do we take advantage of that? That’s a big opportunity for us.”\n\n\tCurrently, Roku’s primary focus is its platform business, which includes advertising and subscriptions, which Wood says generated more than $4 billion in revenue in 2025. However, it recently acquired two new businesses that expand its portfolio and money-making potential: low-cost, ad-free streamer Howdy (which includes a wide library of content rather than Roku originals) and bundled channel service Frndly TV.\n\n\tFor Howdy, Wood describes the $3-per-month Howdy offering as “not designed to replace a major streaming service like Netflix or Disney, it’s designed to be an add-on service.”\n\n\t“The opportunity for Howdy was, if you just look at what’s going on in the streaming world with streaming services, they’re getting more and more expensive,” Wood said. “They keep raising prices, and they keep adding larger and larger ad loads. So the part of the market where it actually started, low cost and no ads, is gone now. There’s no streaming services that addressed that portion of the market. That’s the opportunity for Howdy. It’s three bucks a month and no ads and it’s doing extremely well. Just like we built the Roku Channel using the promotional power of our platform, that’s what we’re doing with Howdy. We’re using that to grow it. But Howdy has very broad appeal. There’s lots of people in the world that want a $3-a-month streaming service with no ads. So we’ll start on Roku, but we’ll also take it off platform as well. I think it’s going to be a really large business.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“King,” the keenly anticipated next project from Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, has locked its 2026 release date. \n\n\t“King” reunites Khan with his “Pathaan” director Siddharth Anand, marking the superstar’s first theatrical release in three years. The cast also includes Khan’s daughter Suhana Khan, Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan, Anil Kapoor, Jackie Shroff, Arshad Warsi and Rani Mukerji.\n\n\n\tWriters on the action thriller include include Sujoy Ghosh, Anand, Suresh Nair, Sagar Pandya and Abbas Tyrewala. The film is produced by Gauri Khan, Siddharth Anand and Mamta Anand for Red Chillies Entertainment and Marflix Pictures.\n\t\n\n\t“King” is due a Dec. 24 release. \n\n\tKhan, often referred to by his initials SRK, has been a dominant force in Bollywood since his breakthrough role in the 1993 thriller “Baazigar.” His charisma and versatility quickly established him as a leading man, with romantic comedies like “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge” (1995) cementing his status as Bollywood’s “King of Romance.”\n\n\tThroughout the ’90s and early 2000s, Khan’s star power seemed unstoppable. He delivered a string of box office hits, including “Kuch Kuch Hota Hai” (1998), “Devdas” (2002), and “Kal Ho Naa Ho” (2003). These films not only dominated the domestic market but also found significant audiences in the Indian diaspora, helping to expand Bollywood’s global footprint. Notably, his 1998 film “Dil Se” became the first Indian film to break into the U.K. box office top 10, signaling Bollywood’s growing international appeal.However, Khan’s career hasn’t been without its challenges. The mid-2010s saw a series of commercial disappointments, including “Fan” (2016), “Zero” (2018) and “Jab Harry Met Sejal” (2017). These setbacks led to speculation about whether the actor’s reign at the top was coming to an end.\n\t\n\n\tYet, true to form, Khan has demonstrated resilience. The year 2023 marked a triumphant return after a four-year hiatus with three major releases: “Pathaan,” “Jawan,” and “Dunki.” Both “Pathaan” and “Jawan” have joined the ranks of India’s all-time highest-grossing films, reaffirming Khan’s enduring appeal and his ability to evolve with changing audience tastes.\n\n\tIn 2024, Khan was accorded a career achievement award at the Locarno Film Festival. \n\n\t“King” is IMDb’s most anticipated Indian film of 2026. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAudience members were moved to tears during the world premiere of “Josephine,” one of the first major revelations out of this year’s Sundance Film Festival. One of the people who was blubbering at Park City’s Eccles Theater was none other than the film’s star Channing Tatum, who confessed that he “cried five, six, seven times” as he finally watched the movie for the first time.\n\n\tFestival-goers didn’t just weep through “Josephine.” They also laughed and cheered during the few lighthearted moments in the otherwise heart-wrenching drama about a young girl who witnesses a brutal sexual assault at her local park in San Francisco. Tatum and Gemma Chan star as Josephine’s parents, who struggle to console their young daughter as she grapples with the aftermath of the traumatic event.\n\t\n\n\tBeth de Araújo wrote and directed the film about a harrowing real-life experience she faced as a child. When the director took the stage at the Eccles on Friday afternoon, she wiped away tears of her own as she was greeted with a standing ovation. The crowd continued to clap and cheer as de Araújo brought out her actors, newcomer Mason Reeves who plays Josephine, as well as Tatum — who picked up his pint-sized co-star and swung her around — and Chan. \n\n\n\t“I started writing this in 2014 when I realized that something happened to me when I was young that haunted me,” De Araújo said during the Q&A after the screening. “I took a stab at writing about female fear, and how that’s shaped who I’ve become. I kept it through the eyes of an 8-year-old and how she learns about male aggression, and I took the fear to the extreme.”\n\t\n\n\tFriday’s premiere was a star-is-born moment for 8-year-old Reeves, whom the director discovered at a farmer’s market in San Francisco. As for her first time on a film set, Reeves declared “what I liked most was all of it” — prompting laughter from the audience. Reeves continued to charm the crowd, saying she hopes to keep acting but would prefer a less-intense genre the next time around. “I have five different [in mind]…. the first is action, then fantasty, a musical, a movie with animals in it, and the last is one a movie filmed in Paris.”\n\n\tThroughout the film, Tatum and Chan’s characters are forced to reprimand their daughter, who acts out as she wrestles with a newfound fear and anger that she can’t yet comprehend. Tatum, in real life the father to a 12-year-old daughter, was worried that Reeves wouldn’t be able to differentiate pretend from reality.\n\n\t“I was concerned about her actually thinking I was mad at her,” Tatum said about Reeves. “I was like, ‘You know I’m just acting, right?'”\n\n\tReeves, decked out in a sparkly silver dress, interjected: “He kept asking me about it, and I was like, ‘I’m fine!‘”\n\n\tChan, who was the first actor to sign onto the film, said she felt “there was a truth radiating from the page” while reading the script. “It’s a really challenging subject matter, and I thought the way [Beth] approached it and forced us to see it through a child’s eyes was brave.”\n\n\tBefore the audience ventured back into the cold, De Araújo thanked everyone for “engaging with something that isn’t an easy sit” and added, “I hope you feel like you had an opportunity to crack your heart open and give yourself the time and space to imagine a better world for yourself.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tChhattisgarh Chief Minister Vishnudev Sai presided over the foundation stone ceremony for Chitrotpala International Film City and Tribal & Cultural Convention Centre on Saturday, marking a significant infrastructure push for India‘s central state to position itself as a production destination.\n\n\tThe 95-acre first-phase development is being spearheaded by creator Tarun Rathi through Rajnandini Entertainment Ltd. and Indradeep Infra Ltd. The project is receiving support under the Special Assistance Scheme from India’s Ministry of Tourism, signaling central government backing for the facility positioned as the country’s first fully-equipped international film city.\n\t\n\n\tIndustry interest is already materializing, with early discussions reportedly exploring the venue as a potential shooting location for upcoming tentpoles including “Golmaal 5” and “Gadaar 3,” alongside other titles in pre-production stages.\n\n\n\tThe development extends beyond soundstages, incorporating exhibition and convention infrastructure through partnerships with India Exposition Mart Limited and the Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts. IEML chair Rakesh Kumar and EPCH chair Neeraj Khanna are developing facilities including an exhibition center, convention hall, hotel, business showrooms and helipad, aimed at creating economic opportunities for local artisans and tribal communities.\n\n\tVeteran filmmaker Anil Sharma (the “Gadar” franchise) attended the ceremony, lending industry credibility to the state’s filmmaking ambitions.\n\n\tThe state government is committing INR150 crore $16.3 million in the initial phase, with subsequent funding of INR250–300 crore ($27.2 million to $32.7 million) earmarked for later development stages from the developers.\n\t\n\n\t“There has long been a demand from the people of the state for our own film city, which will help take stories from Chhattisgarh to global audiences,” Sai said at the event. “I am glad that the government is supporting this new world-class film city with INR150 crore in the first phase and INR250–300 crore in later phases. It should take us about two years to fully develop this dream project.”\n\n\tRathi emphasized the facility’s positioning as a turnkey production solution. “We are trying to support filmmakers with all possible equipment and a complete ecosystem so that producers and crews from Mumbai and across India can come to Raipur to shoot and execute everything seamlessly,” he said. “The accessibility and the shooting friendly environment will help the filmmakers from start to finish.”\n\n\tThe project represents Chhattisgarh’s bid to diversify India’s production geography beyond established hubs in Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai, while leveraging the development to boost local employment in creative industries and related sectors.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFemale friendships demand something a little extra. As that famous America Ferrera monologue in “Barbie” reminded us, it’s tough to be a woman — or, in the case of the two off-kilter leads of the uniquely witty “Extra Geography,” to be in that transitional and equally contradictory period known as girlhood. On top of the burdens you’re born into, how do you simultaneously navigate schoolwork, peer drama, the many mysteries of your budding sexuality, and the unknowable land of boys while also trying to stay loyal to your friendships and be true to your own identity? And on that note, have you figured out who you are yet?\n\t\n\n\tBased on Rose Tremain’s dreamlike 2007 short story with the same name, Molly Manners’ debut feature “Extra Geography” (adapted by “Succession” scribe Miriam Battye) conquers these treacherous coming-of-age waters with a prose so sharp-tongued, timelessly wise and funny that this Gen-Xer felt as if it arrived to fill a cinematic void in her own teen-hood retroactively, just like other comparable movies this side of “Ghost World.” In that, the first quarter of the 21st century has indeed been good to movies about female friendships, with “Extra Geography” joining the ranks of instant greats like “Lady Bird,” “Booksmart” and “Frances Ha.”\n\n\n\tThen again, the proudly British text and aesthetics of Manners and Battye’s “Extra Geography” charts its own fresh territory, like a contemporary Jane Austen novel unfolding within the walls of an English school. Stylistically in step with Tremain’s nostalgic tale, it’s rooted in the palpable pains of youth, while hovering slightly above the realities of everyday life like a cheeky fantasy. At the film’s center are the lovably gruff duo Flic and Minna, played with precision and stiff-upper-lipped hilarity by newcomers Marni Duggan and Galaxie Clear respectively. Accompanied by a range of tunes — from a touch of Boccherini to the likes of “Crimson and Clover” that accentuates the story’s timeless qualities (“Extra Geography” doesn’t spell out the period it’s set in) — Flic and Minna keep busy enough at their boarding school by playing lacrosse, moving across the property’s expansive grounds with an air of snide untouchability and bickering about the future, almost exclusively with one another. “What will happen if we don’t get into Oxbridge?,” Minna wonders right at the start, while the two pick on their perennially bruised knees. “Maybe we’ll just die,” Flic suggests.\n\t\n\n\tAnd there you have it — the risks always seem that intense during one’s youth when every little triumph or mistake lands like a life-or-death situation. Caught in these currents, the amusingly terse Minna and Flic decide that it isn’t enough to just go to a good school and get good grades. In order to really thrive in the future, they also need to become “worldly.” And you can’t possibly be worldly unless you give yourself a little taste of Shakespeare no matter how “rubbish” he might be, and fall in love with someone. Excited about their plan, the duo auditions for an upcoming production of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” and choose an unlikely school project on the side: fall in love with the first person that they’d come across.\n\n\tThe first part of the plan doesn’t quite work out when the casting gets announced with Minna landing the role of Titania the Queen of Fairies, and Flic, a lowly tree. As for the second part, the girls set their sights on their geography teacher Miss Delavigne (a wonderfully nervy Alice Englert). They check out romantic books from the library, study up the intricacies of courtship, and try to score an invitation to their teacher’s cottage to advance their plan. Except, when the rehearsals start in earnest and boys enter the duo’s orbit in after-school adventures, their already off-balance dual existence and sneaky one-upmanship worsens. Will Minna and Flic maintain their best-friend status against the odds?\n\n\tExploring an eager case of codependency, and later on, a heartbreaking instance of growing apart, a film like this requires utmost chemistry between the co-leads, an occasion Duggan and Clear rise to with ease. Establishing a rare closeness of the finishing-each-other’s-sentences kind, the duo truly embrace the immersive feeling of being one half of that singular, irreplaceably defining friendship of the teen years, one that often feels like a high-stakes romantic entanglement. \n\n\tThroughout the movie chaptered like a stage play, Manners captures the two actresses’ rhythms organically with an insightful and mischievously British sense of humor. Her perceptive lensing is especially poignant across wordless scenes where the two girls romance their teacher through longing gazes. (It’s also quite funny when Minna involuntarily makes a “longing” sound while reading about love, to Flic’s astonishment.) When they finally receive that coveted invitation to Miss Delavigne’s home with the pretense of researching their teacher’s motherland New Zealand, Manners follows the trio through a vigilant sense of awe and restraint, without ever sensationalizing the shocking occurrence that follows. \n\t\n\n\t“I’m stressed about everything and I don’t even know what any of it is,” Flic says early on in this infinitely quotable film that feels like a new high-school movie classic. In a way, her words also sum up what’s so wonderful about the searching spirit of “Extra Geography,” a film that mines reserves of tenderness in young female angst and cluelessness with loving empathy.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSure, the devil wears Prada, but what does an aggressive contemporary artist wear to work? How about a see-through dress and stiletto heels? Kinky costumes are just a fraction of the fun in Gregg Araki’s “I Want Your Sex,” which stars Olivia Wilde as Erika Tracy, the most domineering movie boss since James Spader in “Secretary” (the last BDSM-themed workplace comedy to premiere at Sundance). Cooper Hoffman plays her all-too-eager subordinate in a film that’s fully liberated where sex and nudity are concerned, but kind of old-fashioned when it comes to the interpersonal dynamics between its lusty leads.\n\t\n\n\tSurprisingly enough, “I Want Your Sex” shares a decent amount of common ground with screwball classics like “The Shop Around the Corner” and “His Girl Friday” — not that anyone in the target demographic will be making the connection. For Araki, who most recently tried remixing familiar themes for a new generation with “Now Apocalypse,” this unconventional rom-com feels like a natural extension of the queer indie pioneer’s sex-positive sensibility, even as he steers things into novel territory.\n\n\n\tInfinitely less punk that his early work, though still edgier than nearly everything else out there, “I Want Your Sex” represents a sincere attempt by Araki to connect with the kids, whose relationship to sex couldn’t be more confusing to a child of the ’60s: Whereas Araki is a child of the Swinging ’60s, the neuter-minded audience for this movie grew up overexposed to porn and insecure about intimacy, but relatively considerate when it comes to consent. That’s why Hoffman’s Elliot seems so thrilled to find himself at Erika’s service: When she’s in charge, “I don’t have to make any decisions,” he beams, more than happy to relinquish control. But even that freedom can go too far.\n\t\n\n\tAs the movie opens, Elliot stumbles out of Erika’s posh mansion in a blood-splattered pink bra and panties, only to discover his boss floating face down in the pool. Cut to a police interrogation room, where a straight-faced Margaret Cho and Johnny Knoxville grill Elliot about what happened. “9 1/2 weeks earlier,” reads the fluorescent pink caption (Araki is second only to Almodóvar when it comes to ultra-saturated color schemes), winking at ’80s cine-kinkster Adrian Lyne.\n\n\tMost erotic movies come with an element of danger, and though this one starts off with Elliot under suspicion for Erika’s death, Araki can’t resist leaning into the comedy — and why not? Sex should be joyful, and even when there’s degradation and pain play involved (pig masks and ball gags, handcuffs and sharp heels), he clearly thinks it’s more fun to laugh alongside the participants than to go down whatever dark black rabbit hole directors like David Cronenberg and the Wachowskis do with their leather and latex.\n\n\tAraki movies are color-coded like candy, and “I Want Your Sex” is no exception, especially when it comes to Erika’s art studio, where Elliot is hired as one of her assistants. They’re the grunts who paint the papier-mâché phalluses and chew gum all day, sticking the bright pink wads to a labia-shaped canvas. “Contemporary art is a scam,” opines Erika. “The real art is convincing people you’re making something meaningful.” With those words, Araki could be criticizing fellow queer director Bruce La Bruce, who has somehow figured out how to get each new film (no matter how terrible) invited to prestigious international film festivals.\n\n\tBy contrast, Araki belongs to the John Waters school of outsider filmmaking, poking fun at uptight mainstream culture, whether that’s via a stoner comedy like “Smiley Face” or a nihilistic cri de coeur like “The Doom Generation,” without paying much mind to such square notions as “good acting.” Wilde delivers a pure-camp performance here, trying to one-up Miranda Priestly with her imperious workplace attitude, cover-girl eyeliner and droll line deliveries. More ferocious than any cougar, she lures Elliot into her spider’s web of an office and threatens to report him to HR, before propositioning him for sex. She wants it without strings. He’s too naive to realize she’ll have him whipped in every sense of the word.\n\t\n\n\tElliot already has a girlfriend (Charli xcx), though she’s too distracted with grad school to satisfy him sexually. So he turns to his friends for advice, whether it’s Chase Sui Wonders as the roommate who lives vicariously through his exploits or Mason Gooding as his insatiably gay co-worker. The script (which Araki wrote with “Now Apocalypse” partner Karley Sciortino) never fully makes the case for how this vixen figured out her employee’s deepest fantasies, though nearly all of Araki’s characters are sexually fluid, so maybe Elliot’s awakening isn’t such a stretch.\n\n\tIn Hoffman’s hands, Elliot looks like a cross between the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman (the young actor’s dad) and a roguishly handsome member of the Kennedy clan. He amounts to a less confident version of his “Licorice Pizza” character, still plenty enthusiastic about crawling around on all fours or taking a sex toy in the backdoor (the look on Elliot’s face after Erika penetrates him for the first time says it all). Tellingly, when thinking about Erika on his own, Elliot entertains more traditional desires, like getting married and starting a family.\n\n\tHoffman and Wilde’s commitment makes the film feel more important than it is. It’s better to think of this either as pure, irreverent escapism or a guiltless pleasure. There’s no important message or perceptive social insight to be gleaned from “I Want Your Sex,” beyond Araki giving the kids enthusiastic permission to test their own boundaries. Once you get past the shock, the plot falls apart. But that hardly matters, since Araki’s achieved his main goal: getting a repressed generation to loosen up about sex by pushing the boundaries between profound and profane. How’s that for a happy ending?\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs a founding member of Duran Duran, you wouldn’t think that much could surprise John Taylor.By 1984, each of the British new wave gods’ first three albums had gone platinum, their cinematic videos were regularly rotated on MTV, and nonstop global touring attracted Swiftian levels of excitable fans. So, to get away from it all, and rock harder than the synth-pop-driven Duran Duran, bassist Taylor and his guitarist bandmate Andy Taylor hooked up with Chic drummer Tony Thompson, invited Chic bassist Bernard Edwards to produce, and brought in blue-eyed soul legend Robert Palmer to sing a few songs. The next thing Taylor knew, his sidepiece supergroup, the Power Station (named for the NYC studio), had racked up two Billboard Top 10 hits in “Some Like It Hot” and a cover of T. Rex’s “Get It On (Bang a Gong).” The group’s 1985 self-titled debut got to No. 6 on Billboard’s Top 200) and went platinum without even trying.\n\n\n\t“I was not, in annnnny way, prepared for that to happen,” says Taylor, from his home in Los Angeles, about the astonishment that was the success of the Power Station.\n\t\n\n\tTo quote one of Robert Palmer’s solo songs: “Some Guys Have All the Luck.”\n\n\tTaylor is on tour through the end of January with Duran Duran, which will soon release a deluxe version of its eponymously titled 1993 comeback record, oft-referred to as “The Wedding Album.” But the reason for our conversation is a well-deserved 40th anniversary edition of that famous side project, out today. Expanded into 4-CD and 2-LP packages, “The Power Station” comes complete with, among other extras, live rarities from their time with a second journeyman singer Michael Des Barres. (Palmer performed on stage with the Power Station just once, for “Saturday Night Live” in February 1985, then left the band shortly after their album came out the following month.) It also includes testimonies form Taylor paying respects to Power Station’s two late members, Palmer and Thompson, and their producer, Edwards.\n\n\tGoing back to before the start of the supergroup, Taylor recalls Duran Duran’s biggest moment with bittersweet reminiscence. “Collectively, psychologically, after ‘Seven and the Ragged Tiger’… that record was a bitch to make, something where we went in having to top to our massive second album (1982’s “Rio”) and show musical growth,” Taylor says, thinking of the heights of Duran-mania that accompanied their third album. “We had a huge, long arena tour where everything’s bonkers, and was truly the first time that we’d been exposed to such mass hysteria, internationally. To be honest, we were frazzled at tour’s end, to say the very least.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Power Station\n\t\n\n\n\n\tKnowing that, in 1984, the post-tour Duran Duran did not have another album in them, despite the urging of its management (“We gave them one new song, ‘The Wild Boys,’ for the live album ‘Arena'”), the quintet decided to take a break, yet make their time away from each other a working vacation.\n\n\t“Everything was changing within Duran,” Taylor notes of that band’s suddenly sweet smell of success, and the so-called “fork in the road” that brought about both the Power Station and Arcadia, Simon Le Bon and Nick Rhodes’ art-pop project with Roxy Music’s Andy Mackay.\n\n\t“Going back to the question of what was going on psychologically with Duran Duran then, things were complicated. It was the first time where we all had money; some of the guys got married; some of us began to develop outside relationships during that time off, most notably with Tony and Robert. Andy and I just broke off a bit from the others – we were like Thelma and Louise, off into the sunset, motherfuckers…. And with those two guys right there, Andy and I couldn’t resist doing something, something a little bit more organic, a little more muscular, a little less thought-out.”\n\n\tTaylor met Thompson around the time that his fellow Chic member Nile Rodgers had exploded with his first huge production outside of their disco ensemble, David Bowie’s “Let’s Dance” album. “Tony played on ‘Let’s Dance’ and Madonna’s ‘Like a Virgin’ (another Rodgers production) and his was a style of drumming that lit up the dance floor,” says the bassist, before adding that Thompson was the “real star” of the Power Station, the foundation upon which every other sound was built.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt was, however, another non-Duran relationship of the time that signaled the start of the Power Station project before it had a name: the one with model and Playboy Playmate Bebe Buell, who, at that moment, was John Taylor’s paramour. It was upon Buell’s urging that the bassist would back her on a crunching cover of 1971’s “Get It On.”\n\t\n\n\t“I was dating her at the tail end of that Duran tour. She was an artiste who’d already had a record out by that time (1981’s “Covers Girl” EP produced by Ric Ocasek and Rick Derringer), and I thought it could be fun producing something with her,” says Taylor, who went to his then-label, EMI, for backing. “They weren’t going to say ‘no,’ so we got the green light for studio time to develop the idea, then she and I fell out. But by then the horse was running, and Andy and I took the bit between our teeth…\n\n\t“Andy, Tony and I were going to be this rhythm section, despite not having played together as a unit at that point,” adds Taylor, talking about a “fantasy” of that trio of musicians backing various vocalists ,as if they were “a new version of the Stax house band.” The schematic of many singing cooks in one Power Station kitchen changed when their pal Robert Palmer stopped by the studio.“Robert came in, sang ‘Communication’ (a tune penned by the two Taylors and co-composer Derek Bramble, to which Palmer added lyrics), and asked about ‘Get It On.’ We put that track up next, and as soon as he finished singing, Bernard said that we’d need not look further for vocalists – that Robert was the perfect singer for this project. At that exact moment, the nature of the project changed.”Robert Palmer, by 1984, was a cooly composed, eclectic, British R&B-rock vocal legend — a “concessioner of many things,” by Taylor’s estimation — without having ever had a huge, continuous presence on the charts since his solo album debut with “Sneakin’ Sally Through the Alley” (1974).\n\n\t“Robert had a very dexterous voice and a clever lyrical style about him,” says Taylor.\n\n\tPalmer’s gritty but gracefully soulful singing prowess and fast way with a lyric brought a different energy to what the Taylors and Thompson had planned for the sessions. “We didn’t have a plan…. Didn’t really think it all out,” says the bassist. “Andy and I didn’t have, as our goal, to start another band. We just wanted to make cool music with Tony and Bernard. Suddenly, however, we had this other group. Fuck me, right? But it all sounded so incredible with Robert in the mix.”Suddenly, and quickly, the Power Station became an “antidote” to what Duran Duran had become at that time, where everything they did felt important and pre-planned, if not fussy. “It was nice to do something that wasn’t at all important,” Taylor says. “Actually, what we did was like we were having an affair from our marriage. And we knew that this affair wasn’t going to last. We were built to come together like a lightning flash, and pull off something unusual.”The album’s most thundering track, one that came together speedily, was Power Station’s biggest hit, “Some Like It Hot,” a Twin Taylor idea where Palmer immediately added the “sweat when the heat is on” lyrics after hearing the title.“The success of these songs was excess to expectation, as no one could anticipate the outcome, let alone the lot of us who made it,” says Taylor. “This project was driven solely by a desire to fuck, to rock – nothing contrived. It all started out as truly unconventional.” Taylor quickly credits the work of “the hottest engineer and mixer at that time, Jason Corsaro, from the hottest studio around, the Power Station,” as hugely beneficial to his band’s buoyant vibes.That drive – and this band’s muscular rock and funk sound – quickly pushed “The Power Station” up the charts following the March 1995 release, to the point they immediately scheduled a summer shed tour. That same sound was so crisp, cutting and, yes, commercial that Palmer suddenly took it as his own, and recorded 1985’s “Riptide” with producer Edwards, drummer Thompson and guitarist Taylor on his biggest-ever solo hit to date, “Addicted to Love.” Not long after “Riptide’s” release, Palmer left his longtime label, Island, for new digs at EMI, and a continuation of the crunch-rock-rhythm sound.\n\n\tPalmer bailed on the tour and split from the Power Station weeks after the album’s release. Taylor doesn’t sound angry at Palmer, now, for having jumped ship on the Power Station when he did.\n\n\t“Hey, Island made him a huge money offer at the time to deliver a new album on the heels of ours,” says the bassist. ”Look, we were blessed just to be able to make a record with Robert. He’s a great artist, a great collaborator, and should be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Robert just came into the studio, loosened his tie, and took off – he made it all look so easy.”\n\n\tTaylor makes sure to mention that Palmer’s Power Station tour replacement, Michael Des Barres, came nobly to their rescue when the already-booked 1985 Power Station summer tour and Live Aid appearance reared its head. “We started out as a band meant to have more than one singer, so why not,” says Taylor with a laugh. “Still, we needed a singer for this tour, so God bless Michael. \n\t\n\n\t“Everyone knew his reputation as an amazing singer and an underachiever who had two bands who were supposed to have been massive – Silverhead and Detective – that just didn’t happen. And it wasn’t as if he wasn’t current; he had just written that Animotion song ‘Obsession,’ which was a huge hit, and he was wide and alive. We found Michael in Texas hanging out with Don Johnson on a movie set, flew him into New York, he hit the mic, and immediately we knew that he just got it. Michael was perfect. He came in and embraced it.”\n\n\tTaylor says that listening to the never-before-released August 1985 live show that’s part of the new Power Station boxed set was something of a thrill, as he’d never heard the tapes prior to creating this 2026 collection. “I forgot that we’d had to fill out a two-hour set on that tour based on a Power Station album of just eight songs, so, sure, we did ‘Obsession.’ And of course, let’s do a Duran Duran song. Hey, let’s do two.”\n\n\tThe lesson John Taylor learned with the creation of the supergroup: there’s no place like home.\n\n\t“The idea of a supergroup was so everything not punk-rock, right?” says the bassist with a big laugh. “The Power Station started off as this unconventional thing, gained traction, and became more legitimate, more conventional. And by the end of its 1985 tour, I realized that I didn’t start the Power Station for the sake of convention, or even to have another band. I was already in a great band to start: Duran Duran.”\n",

    "description": "\n\t“I Want Your Sex,” an erotic thriller starring Olivia Wilde as a sexually assured artist who embarks on a sadomasochistic relationship with her gall",
    "body": "\n\t“I Want Your Sex,” an erotic thriller starring Olivia Wilde as a sexually assured artist who embarks on a sadomasochistic relationship with her gallery assistant, got Sundance’s pulse racing on Friday night. Cooper Hoffman plays Elliot, the sub to Wilde’s dom in Gregg Araki’s latest piece of boundary-pushing provocation, one that Sundance programming director Kim Yutani dubbed a “return to form” for the filmmaker in her introductory remarks.\n\t\n\n\tBoth stars go for it — baring all in a relationship that is kinky, but also tender at times. Not in a conventional way, of course. Wilde’s character, Erika Tracy, opens a sexual Pandora’s box for Hoffman, one that comes with ball gags, stilettos, whips, chains, and a cornucopia of dildos and strap-ons. There’s even a disastrous threesome that goes comically off the rails.\n\n\n\tWhen Araki heard that Wilde was interested in playing Erika, he made it clear what would be required. \n\n\n\t“We had a meeting, and I just said, ‘you know, to do this part, you gotta just not give a fuck, and just want to just fucking take the plunge,'” Araki recalled during a post-screening Q&A. “‘Because I don’t want to compromise it. I don’t want to water it down.’ And she said, ‘Let’s go.'”\n\n\tWilde said she never looked back after signing up to play the role of an artist whose swagger masks her dwindling self-confidence.\n\n\t“I was just so excited by Gregg’s enthusiasm for the medium, for the process,” Wilde said. “I wish more people made movies like [Gregg]. You just said, ‘Let’s do it. Let’s get cool people together who want to tell a story, and let’s just do it. And it doesn’t have to be a whole thing, and it doesn’t have to feel like this corporate project. It has to just come from the heart.’ And I wanted to be a part of something like that.”\n\t\n\n\tHoffman, who turned heads in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Licorice Pizza,” wasn’t sure he was right for the part of a bumbling boy toy. Araki was drawn to Hoffman because he reminded him of Dustin Hoffman in “The Graduate” and thought he could bring the same nebbish intensity to the part.\n\n\t“I honestly didn’t think I’d get cast,” Hoffman admitted. “I just threw my hat in the ring and kept getting closer and closer. And then they said I got the job. And I was like, ‘Ah, shit. I gotta go do this.’ And I’m very happy I did.”\n\n\tOn the red carpet prior to the premiere, Wilde told Variety that Gen Z wants to see less sex in movies and TV because they “don’t want to see inauthenticity anymore.”\n\n\t“The way that sex has been portrayed in film for a long time hasn’t been particularly realistic,” Wilde said. \n\n\n\tThat may not be a critique that’s leveled at Araki and company. The nudity and S&M mean “I Want Your Sex” will push the R-rating to the breaking point, but it was the film’s heart that the cast kept emphasizing on stage.\n\n\t“Ultimately, the sex feels secondary,” Chase Sui Wonders, who plays Hoffman’s best friend and roommate, said. “It’s a story about being obsessed with someone…It’s just a tragic love story.”\n\n\tMason Gooding, Daveed Diggs and Charli xcx round out the ensemble. Black Bear produced the film, which is looking for distribution. The packed auditorium included executives from indie labels like Magnolia, Roadside and Mubi, and the room was so crowded that Patrick Schwarzenegger was spotted walking up and down the aisle looking for an empty seat.\n\n\t“I Want Your Sex” is Araki’s eleventh feature at Sundance, with the director having previously debuted the likes of “Mysterious Skin” and “The Doom Generation” at the mountain festival. Before the film screened, Araki praised Sundance founder Robert Redford, who died last year at the age of 89.\n\n\t“There’s been nobody in the history of fucking Hollywood movies who says, ‘I want to use my fucking incredible star power and all my fucking clout to create this place in the world for those fucking weird filmmakers, those outsider filmmakers, those different voices,” Araki said. “It’s all about DEI.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Once upon a time, there lived an extraordinary man who connected all of us in this room,” Ethan Hawke narrated to kick off the Sundance Institute’s annual gala, fittingly a tribute to the film festival’s late founder.\n\n\t“We wouldn’t be here without the love and appreciation for Robert Redford,” Hawke said.\n\n\tThis year’s event was emotional, not just because it’s the last hurrah in Park City, but also because it was held shortly after Redford died in September at the age of 89. The actor-turned-director, a sought-after leading man through much of the ’70s and ’80s through films such as “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “The Way We Were,” and “All the President’s Men,” founded Sundance Film Festival in 1978 as a launchpad for independent filmmakers. Friends of the filmmaker and alumni of the festival, including Woody Harrelson, Chloé Zhao, Ava DuVernay and Taika Waititi, trekked on Friday night to the Grand Hyatt Deer Valley one last time to toast to Redford.\n\t\n\n\t“For some of you younger folks who didn’t live in the ‘60s, ‘70s or ‘80s, it might be hard for you to understand what Robert Redford meant to my generation,” Harrelson said. “He was part of my childhood.”\n\n\n\tHarrelson described a sense of “unbridled euphoria” when he got to know Redford while filming the erotic thriller “Indecent Proposal” in the early ‘90s. “I admit he’s the only man on earth I’d sell my wife to,” Harrelson cracked. “And I also admit, unabashedly, that he’s the only man I’d return the money to, to take me for a night.”\n\n\tFriday night’s event also honored Zhao, who just made history as the first person of color and second woman to be nominated twice for the best director Oscar for “Hamnet,” with the Trailblazer Award. Nia DaCosta, who recently directed “Hedda” and made her Sundance debut with 2018’s “Little Woods,” was feted with the Vanguard Award.\n\t\n\n\t“Being part of this community taught me something very important, which is trailblazing or leadership is not about dominance. It’s about interdependence. It’s about community,” Zhao said. “I want to thank Robert Redford for knowing the importance of interdependence in nature and human nature.”\n\n\tHawke, a Sundance regular over the decades in films such as “Before Sunrise” and this year’s drama “The Weight,” shared the story of the first time he met Redford. Hawke had auditioned for the 1992 drama “A River Runs Through It” but didn’t get the role. Hawke remembers that Redford, who directed the film, told him: “You’re too young for this part. But I just want you to know, you’re going to have a wonderful career, and I can’t wait to watch it.”\n\n\tHawke’s takeaway from the exchange? “He believed in me. He followed up. He came to see me in a play. It was 99-seat theater; $10 a ticket. What the fuck?” Hawke recalled. “He championed other people. The fact that he had time to care about all of us is so meaningful.”\n\n\tA recurring theme of the emotional evening was Redford’s passion for cultivating and supporting new talent, as well as his insistence that they called him “Bob.” However several filmmakers, including DuVernay and DaCosta, admitted they were uncomfortable using a casual nickname for someone they considered a hero.\n\n\t“When I think of Robert Redford, I think of how frustrated he was when I never called him Bob,” DuVernay shared. “When he asked why, I’d say ‘Because you’re Mr. Redford.’ He’d said, “Ava, please call me Bob.’”\n\n\t(That didn’t apply to Waititi, who later in the evening joked, “Robert Redford — Bob to me, not to you.”)\n\n\tBefore Patti LuPone made a surprise appearance to perform a heartfelt rendition of “Forever Young,” Robert’s daughter Amy Redford honored her father and said the evening felt “like a homecoming.”\n\n\t“I can’t help but think of all the galas my dad had no interest in showing up to,” Amy said, “and how he might have actually enjoyed this one.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Moment” kicks off with black-and-white strobe images of Charli xcx writhing on the floor in skimpy torn clothing, as an industrial beat pounds away with apocalyptic fury on the soundtrack. In other words, this could be one of her videos. The movie then mixes in a montage of news clips reporting on Brat Summer, the music/culture/style/celebrity/marketing juggernaut that was spun out of “brat,” the 2024 Charli xcx album that became a global phenomenon.\n\t\n\n\t“The Moment,” in theory, is a mockumentary, set during the weeks when Charli is preparing to launch a massive worldwide brat tour. But the word “mockumentary” has connotations that, in this case, need to be instantly dispelled. The movie isn’t a cheeky satirical pop-music spoof, like “This Is Spinal Tap” (the film that invented the form) or Christopher Guest’s “A Mighty Wind” or Andy Samberg’s “Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping.” It’s a mock documentary played straight. And it’s not just that the jokes are understated (a generous way to put it, given that the jokes are so understated you’re barely going to laugh at them). It’s that Charli xcx, in “The Moment,” really is playing a close-up version of herself, and what the movie presents isn’t so much a comedy landscape as an alternate-reality version of the world in which Charli xcx actually exists.\n\n\n\tFerried around in SUVs, surrounded by frenetic handlers, she’s the eye at the center of the pop-media storm, whirling from photo shoots to brand endorsements to appearances on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and a British Vogue “What’s in My Bag?” segment. At the same time, the executives at Atlantic Records, led by the formidable Tammy (Rosanna Arquette), attempt to raise the ante on all this by pushing ahead to the question: How can Brat Summer be extended? They’re really asking: How can we keep the money flowing? Even the way Charli’s handlers confront her with a never-ending onslaught of fawning praise mixed with nattering demands, to the point that they make Jay Kelly look like someone in danger of being ignored, is all about the money. The Charli we see is a true artist of dance pop, and one of the hottest celebrities in the world, but what that really means is that she’s the golden goose: the one everyone puts on a pedestal so the golden eggs can keep coming.\n\t\n\n\tThe first idea they come up with is that Charli should endorse a new credit card, launched by Britain’s Howard Stirling Bank, aimed at young queer people. (It’s hipster capitalism.) And when it’s proposed that Charli should now, of course, do a concert film, that seems a bull’s-eye extension of where she’s at, and everyone is onboard. Amazon MGM Studios will back the project. The only question is: Who will be the director? The name that bubbles to the surface is Johannes (Alexander Skarsgård), a hot helmer who, according to Celeste (Hailey Benton Gates), Charli’s creative director and close confidante, “basically makes adverts for women.” That’s supposed to be a red flag. But after a hastily assembled Zoom meeting in which Charli tells Johannes that she simply needs someone to record the show, and he agrees, the concert film seems set, and Brat Summer looks ready to roll on.\n\n\tAidan Zamiri, the 29-year-old Scottish photographer and music-video maven who’s the first-time director of “The Moment,” does a good job of staging the early scenes of the movie as, in essence, a documentary. The Charli xcx we see is simply herself, and she’s quite captivating, with her dark eyebrows and fuck-it-all attitude and middle-class-princess-of-Essex-gone-bad-girl way. And the hubbub that surrounds her is an effective enactment of the multitasking pressures a contempo pop star faces.\n\n\tThen Johannes shows up. Alexander Skarsgård, who resembles a very tall version of Jim Carrey, plays him with a passive-aggressive fatuousness that is, in itself, a bit Carrey-like. Johannes thinks that everything about Charli and her show is fantastic! Except for everything about it that he’d like to change.\n\n\tIf you wanted to tell the forces of Christian nationalism why tradwife culture is never going to take hold the way they want it to, you could explain it all in two words: Charli xcx. Just watch the video for “Guess,” the song she did with Billie Eilish — though the video is ruled by Charli, which means that it’s all come-hither-but-be-warned erotic abandon, from the liquid way she moves her body (every inch of it seems to quiver) to the way she tosses off words in her accent that’s equal parts posh and punk to her whole captivating air of dominatrix delirium. What Robert Plant was to the ’70s, what Madonna and Prince and Axl Rose were to the ’80s, what Britney Spears was to the ’90s…Charli xcx is to today. She’s an intoxicating siren song of sexual danger you’d be hard-pressed to resist. In a world with Charli xcx, how trad is a wife really going to want to go?\n\t\n\n\tIn “The Moment,” everyone onscreen seems to understand what Charli is about: the handlers, the record-company executives, the talk-show hosts, the advertisers, the Tim Gunn costume person, the surge of fans. But there’s one person who, for some reason, doesn’t get it at all: Johannes, the director of the concert film. Early on, when he sees that Charli is flashing a nasty sexual word on stage and singing a song about cocaine, he asks if she can tone it down. He wants the movie to be presentable for a “family” audience. Johannes, in other words, is the same stooge we’ve seen in a thousand satires — the lame voice of corporate blanding, the one who fights the artist-hero to neuter her voice. The argument made by Johannes is the same one this character always makes. He’s saying: Let’s make more money! It’s what Col. Parker said to Elvis and what movie producers have said to every great director in the history of cinema.\n\n\tBut in the case of Charli xcx, Johannes’ demands are more than oppressive. They’re eccentric, because they make no sense. Charli xcx is an awesome dance-pop star, a saturnine goddess who has the world in her hand. But apart from how electric her music is, her brand is bad-girl subversion. That’s how she moves product. So when Johannes, the doofus dictator, tells her to scale it back, to lose the naughtiness, to cut down on the strobe-light aggression and substitute what everyone in the movie says looks like an onstage lava lamp, he’s literally asking her to neuter the thing that makes her successful. Why would Charli go along with it?\n\n\tThe answer is supposed to be that she’s still fighting the tyranny of a male-dominated music industry. But Charli xcx, as “The Moment” presents her, has already shot far beyond that. She has used her own raw aggression as a pop star to put the male suits in their place. And so the scenario that unfolds in “The Moment” doesn’t parse, either as satire or as mock drama. It hinges on Charli, in a tizzy, going to Ibiza for a quick vacation, where she runs into Kylie Jenner (playing herself), who talks up Johannes as a genius and as a director she herself wanted to use (but couldn’t because he had already committed to Charli’s project). This is supposed to set off a fatal fit of jealous insecurity on Charli’s part.\n\t\n\n\tAnd then…there’s the credit-card disaster. Charli, through a text on social media, somehow sets off a chain reaction, so that all the queer folk who got the brat card try to win free concert tickets…which crashes the system…and brings the Howard Stirling Bank to ruin…but I can’t truly explain how any of this happens, because it’s all presented in such a slipshod manner. I’m sorry, but this is not how an effective mockumentary works. I actually think “The Moment” should have pushed further into crackpot satirical extremes. In that case, it wouldn’t have been a movie that featured a “real” version of Charli xcx. But it might have made you laugh more, because it would have been genuinely outlandish rather than just unconvincing.\n",

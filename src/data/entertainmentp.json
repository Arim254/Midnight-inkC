    "body": "\n\tIt was a holiday-tastic mix of Snoop Dogg‘s greatest hits and Christmas favorites that livened up Minneapolis’ U.S. Bank Stadium during the halftime break for Netflix‘s Christmas Day telecast of the NFL’s Detroit Lions game against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n\tSnoop Dogg, Lainey Wilson and Huntr/x of “Kpop Demon Hunters” fame brought their own brand of Christmas cheer to the event. Martha Stewart introduced the “Snoop’s Holiday Halftime Party” segment with a Snoop Dogg spin on “Twas the Night Before Christmas,” with lines such as, “Fans forgot about their beef, because gin and juice filled the air.”\n\t\n\n\tSnoop entered the arena in a fire engine-red double breasted suit topped by a long red coat with fuzzy red trim. He walked through a clever medley of his signature hits, starting with “The One and Only,” that shifted into “My Favorite Things” and then into “Nuthin’ But a ‘G’ Thang.” He was backed by a small orchestra that assembled on the gridiron, along with energetic dancers dressed in suits that suggested candy canes. A high-energy marching band and drummers added to the wall of sound presented.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSnoop Dogg performs U.S. Bank Stadium on Dec. 25, 2025, in Minneapolis. (Julian Dakdouk/Netflix via AP Content Services)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJulian Dakdouk/Netflix via AP Content Services\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere was some chatter online about the weak audio quality on Snoop’s vocals for telecast viewers. The challenge of delivering strong sound in a live broadcast was probably compounded by the fact that Snoop moved all over the stage and field during his performance.\n\n\tSnoop was joined after a few minutes by Huntr/x, the trio of singers behind Netflix’s smash hit “Kpop Demon Hunters” movies, for a pop take on “The 12 Days of Christmas.” \n\t\n\n\tCountry star Lainey Wilson then joined the scene in a white sleigh for a spirited rendition of “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.” Beloved Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli came out with his son, Matteo, to close out the show with a powerful duet on “White Christmas.” The elder and younger Bocelli were, of course, joined at the end by Snoop, Wilson and Huntr/x in classic network TV special closing number form.\n\n\tThis marks the second year that Netflix has carried two Christmas Day NFL games with a high-profile musical performance in between. Last year the appearance by Beyoncé added superstar status to Netflix’s inaugural “Christmas GameDay” telecast. This year, Snoop Dogg and friends, which included rising singer Tonio Armani, provided a modern spin on a feel-good, sing-along musical Christmas event. The segment closed with a cuddly picture of Snoop surrounded by his many children and grandchildren, all wearing holiday pajamas.\n\n\tEarlier Thursday, Netflix carried the first of its two games, in which the Dallas Cowboys beat the Washington Commanders 30-23, in Washington.\n\n\t(Pictured top: Lainey Wilson and Snoop Dogg)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSnoop Dogg performs the halftime show during the game between the Minnesota Vikings and the Detroit Lions at U.S. Bank Stadium on Dec. 25.

    "body": "\n\tChristmas albums still have a bit of a stigma among fans of higher-cred artists. It can be difficult, first, to overcome the expectation that they’re either cash grabs or sops to sentimentality, and secondly, to come up with an original take on seasonal music, even with the best intentions. Should an artist deign to embark on a full-on Christmas music tour, suspicions might be even more aroused. What, other than opportunism, could be the reason for that much devotion to the season?\n\t\n\n\tSo God bless the occasional singer-songwriter like Ben Folds who sees Christmas as a way into writing the kinds of songs he would usually write, not just for the purposes of a new album but a proper concert outing. His recently wrapped Tis the Season tour was a veritable Christmas Star in shining a light on the right path to undertake doing this kind of thing, as was the album of mostly original material that precipitated it, 2024’s archly titled “Sleigher.” Folds brings to the concert state a satisfyingly holistic approach to holiday music, give or take a couple of “ho’s.”\n\n\n\tEven before Folds recorded “Sleigher,” there was a body of solid evidence that he was the right man for the task. That was the fact that he’d already written and recorded a number of songs that mention Christmas or the holidays either prominently or incidentally — prior tunes that, combined with the “Sleigher” material, easily added up to a full set, before getting to any non-seasonal numbers thrown in as bonus tracks for the encore. Most notable of these, as any fan would know, is his late ’90s hit “Brick,” a ballad about taking one’s girlfriend to get an abortion on Dec. 26. Once you’ve written that as your first “Christmas song,” you’ve established a fine outer parameter for how far you’re willing to stretch the genre, such as it is. \n\t\n\n\tAt one of two sold-out appearances at L.A.’s new Blue Note Cafe, where he was among the few non-jazz artists booked thus far in the young life of that club, Folds and his combo naturally performed “Brick,” along with a few other pre-existing holiday songs that tended toward that outer edge, like the novelty songs “Bizarre Christmas Incident” and the indelicately titled “Bitch Went Nutz.” But being subversive about Christmas is not actually really his thing, or his current thing, anyway. And the “Sleigher” album, despite its irreverent name, tends more toward the center, with earnest songs that aren’t afraid to at least skim sentiment, if not indulge in it, even if the sentiment is loneliness. In the overall course of the set, Folds was able to play Christmas for comedy, but more often than not came up for something more earnest, all the way to covering Mel Torme and Vince Guaraldi without apology.\n\n\tRight at the outset, he explained why he came to see the season as a meaningful setting for original songs.\n\n\t“I like a good rhyme, and that’s why I guess I’ve bothered to write a whole Christmas album, plus a few other songs in my past,” he told the Blue Note audience. “There were Christmas songs and a whole slew of songs that mention it” in his catalog, “and I think the reason is because it is so all-pervasive once a year. It is such a bully of a holiday — it takes over everything. It’s the holiday that’s too big to fail. And it’s the same shit every year. It’s the same colors, the same sights, sounds, songs, everything… same ads… And that’s the gift.”\n\n\tHe would have to further explain that, and did. \n\n\t“Because when everything is the same and it just feels like a continuation of yesterday, which was 2024, and the day before that was Christmas 2023, the only thing that’s changed is you. And I think that’s the reason I’ve been interested in the topic. You could be at at dinner at Christmas and realize that only two days in Christmas time ago, there were a couple people that used to be here that are not here anymore. And then you’re sitting and talking to nephews who weren’t even here what seems like a couple days ago, and now they’re bald and telling you about their bankruptcy. It’s crazy. So, by having that as a marker, it makes it a rhyme. That’s what a rhyme is for. It is at the end of a phrase or a couplet to sound the same. Everything seems like it ought to be same, but it’s a little bit different; you actually learned something in the last 10 syllables.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBen Folds at the Blue Note\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMajor Caldwell IV\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWith that, he went into “Christmas Time Rhyme,” which, as he explained, was originally supposed to be the title track of his holiday album last year, before “I thought of ‘Sleigher’ and I thought, ‘Man, I gotta use that. That’s better.'” It’s a lovely song tracing those noble thoughts about cyclical thoughts and time speeding up and slowing down and putting us back down where we were, the same and different. And it also puts that poetry aside to cut to the chase: “Precious moments like these, they mean the world to me/ Listen, you’re all fuckin’ freaks, but we’re family / So we do what it takes to be in one place, if just for a day.”\n\n\n\n\n\tAlong with the more familiar cover chestnuts that also peppered his set, Folds introduced his audience to “You Don’t Have to Be a Santa Claus (When Christmas Comes Around),” a fairly obscure oldie dating back at least to 1955, when the Mills Brothers recorded it. (Folds said it was written during the Great Depression.) “I thought it might be relevant these days because it’s about how you might think about helping someone out on other days besides Christmas, and that at the time was a controversial statement, like it is now, to help someone else out.”\n\n\tCloser to home, he got at what it’s like to be truly solitary at Christmas — or at least other than the companionship of a pet — with his original “Maurice,” written in Nashville in “one of those really everything-looks-the-same sort of suburban neighborhoods that’s not that inspiring. And all the neighbors had the same exact Christmas decorations in their front yard — an inflatable Santa that’s about two stories high and an inflatable reindeer next door; every House down the street almost had the same thing in the front of the yard. Maurice fucking hated the reindeer. He said so many inappropriate things to them in their reindeer language… Our yard was right next to I-40, which comes out here too. And Maurice would dig holes in the snow, and I sort of imagined he was trying to dig a path out.”\n\n\tThe funnier songs of the past had their own stories. “Bitch Went Nutz” was about a young, conservative lawyer on the rise inviting a liberal barista to be his date at the office Christmas party, only to have her wind up in a screaming political argument with his right-wing colleagues. “Bizarre Christmas Incident” was written as his first misguided attempt at an end-titles theme for “How the Grinch Stole Christmas”; he regaled the Blue Note audience with the tale of how horror-stricken the music supervisor was when he turned it in: “Ben Folds, it’s a fucking kids movie. I’m not showing this to Ron Howard!” He then followed that in concert with the much more appropriate song he turned around in the next 24 hours that successfully made it into the movie, “Lonely Christmas Eve.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tMost plaintive was a song he co-wrote with Nick Hornby, “Picture Window,” about the celebrated novelist and his wife spending New Year’s Eve with their chronically ill son in a London hospital room. The refrain: “You know what hope is? / Hope is a bastard, hope is a liar, a cheat and a tease / Hope comes near you / Kick its backside / Got no place in days like these.” The holiday season doesn’t get any more sobering than that, notwithstanding the Blue Note’s drink minimum.\n\n\tWhat do you do after that full spectrum of holiday fare than sing “The Christmas Song”? Along with, come the encore, unseasonal chestnuts from his own catalog, like “Philosophy,” from his more keyboard-pounding Ben Folds Era, before circling back to Charlie Brown with “Christmas Time Is Here,” sung by duet partner Lindsey Craft, to send the audience out into the non-chill on a note of buzzed tranquility.\n\n\tFolds remains one of our most reliable songwriters, so it’s not surprising that his Christmas material would be as solid as the rest — and that he, unlike most of his contemporaries, would recognize that the mass audience’s hunger for seasonal songs is something worth sating. Because, if nothing else, it does represent a twelfth of our lives, give or take. He has a song called “Sleepwalking Through Christmas,” but it’s to his credit he doesn’t sleepwalk through the task of coming up with this stuff. Here’s hoping for “Sleigher 2” and a perennial touring season.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“You simply must marry. You just haven’t met the right young lady,” Benedict Bridgerton‘s mother Violet admonishes him in the trailer for season 4 of Netflix’s “Bridgerton.” \n\n\tBut he might disagree after he meets the fetching Sophie Baek, played by Yerin Ha, unleashing a captivating romance.\n\n\tPart one of season four of the popular period series arrives Jan. 29 on Netflix, while part two premieres on Feb. 26.\n\n\n\tIn season 3, childhood pals Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton finally get together when their friendship turns into love and marriage. But until his masked ball encounter with Sophie, Colin’s brother Benedict is more focused on painting and various dalliances — “he’s a rake,” as his sisters say in the trailer.\n\t\n\n\tThose who have read Julia Quinn’s third “Bridgerton” book, “An Offer From a Gentleman,” will recognize key scenes from the book, as this season is said to be one of the most faithful to the series.\n\n\tEven Violet’s Joan of Arc costume for the masquerade ball is inspired by her look in “An Offer From a Gentleman.” When Benedict first meets the masked Sophie, he finds her immediately captivating, but then he must uncover the identity of Lady in Silver, who he calls “the most intriguing person he’s ever met.” Also straight from the book is the famous Lake Scene, in which Sophie encounters Benedict while he’s taking a skinny dip. \n\n\t“With a little imagination, the impossible seems possible,” says the trailer’s narrator, just as Benedict is told by Violet, “It is all very well to dream, but life is meant to be lived.”\n\n\tWatch the trailer below:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel has delivered a scathing — and typically comical — attack on president Donald Trump in a special Christmas Day address to the U.K. on Channel 4.\n\n\tFor its 2025 annual Alternative Christmas Message, broadcast by the Brit network since 1993 with an eclectic array of guests invited to speak over the years, Channel 4 turned to Kimmel, who used the opportunity to claim that “tyranny is booming” in the U.S. thanks to Trump, who he said “thinks he is our king.”\n\t\n\n\tKimmel also reflected on the controversial — and brief — suspension of his talk show “Jimmy Kimmel Live” from ABC after comments he made in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder, accusing Trump of trying to “shut me up because I don’t adore him in the way he likes to be adored.”\n\n\n\tHis return to airwaves he likened to an (early) “Christmas miracle,” asserting it was because people stood up to support free expression of speech. “Our show came back stronger than ever. We won, the President lost and now I’m back on the air every night giving the most powerful politician on earth a right and richly deserved bollocking,” he said, deploying a rather British term. “That’s a word, right, I used it properly?”\n\n\tKimmel concluded his message, broadcast shortly after the more traditional King’s Christmas Day speech, by apologizing to the U.K. for the current state of the U.S., asserting that Americans are “not all like” Trump and urging Brits to hold out. \n\n\t“No one knows better than you we’re always just a little bit late to the game, but do we come through in the end? Maybe. Give us about three years. Please.”\n\t\n\n\tSee the full transcript of Kimmel’s Christmas Day message below: \n\n\tHi I’m Jimmy Kimmel.\n\n\tI have no idea if you know who I am, but I was asked to deliver this year’s Alternative Christmas Message (which I’ve heard is a big deal) so I hope you do, but if not I host what you call a chat show (we call it a talk show) in what you call the colonies, I think? I honestly have no idea what’s going on over there.\n\n\tI do know what’s going on over here though, and I can tell you that, from a fascism perspective, this has been a really great year. Tyranny is booming over here.\n\n\tYou may have read in your colourful newspapers my country’s President would like to shut me up because I don’t adore him in the way he likes to be adored. The American government made a threat against me and the company I work for, and all of a sudden we were off the air. But then, you know what happened? A Christmas miracle happened. Well, it was September, it was a September miracle. But the holiday does seem to come earlier and earlier every year, doesn’t it?\n\n\tMillions and millions of people stood up and said: ‘No, this is not acceptable’. People who never watched my show, people who were on record saying they hate my show spoke out, they marched, they did this all to support the right to a free expression of speech and because so many people spoke out, we came back. Our show came back stronger than ever. We won, the President lost and now I’m back on the air every night givin’ the most powerful politician on earth a right and richly deserved bollocking. That’s a word, right, I used it properly?\n\n\tAnd the reason I’m telling you this story is because maybe you’re thinking: ‘Oh a government silencing its critics is something that happens in places like Russia, or North Korea, or LA, not the UK’. Well, that’s what we thought and now we’ve got King Donny the Eighth calling for executions. It happens fast.\n\n\tYou know it’s funny we Americans are very proud of not having a king. It’s kind of why we left. Earlier this year tens of millions of us marched at protests called No Kings. You had some of those there. And just for the record we have nothing against your king. I mean I don’t know if you know this, but his son lives here. We just – well some of us – just have a problem with the guy who thinks he is our king.\n\t\n\n\tHere in the United States right now we are both figuratively and literally tearing down the structures of our democracy. From the free press, to science, to medicine, to judicial independence, to the actual White House itself, we are a right mess. And we know this is also affecting you, and I just wanted to say sorry. And we want you to know or, at least I want you to know, that we’re not all like him. We’re not all like that.\n\n\tLook I know (from the musical Hamilton) that our countries didn’t start off on the greatest note, but I also know (from seeing Love Actually) that we have a special relationship. So, if I might speak on behalf of my country – which I most certainly do not – our message to you, our friends across the pond this Christmas is: don’t give up on us. We’re going through a bit of a wobble right now, but we’ll come around. It may not seem like it, but we love you guys. We even love the things about you that you don’t like, like Simon Cowell for instance. We are not bright. We’re Americans. No one knows better than you we’re always just a little bit late to the game, but do we come through in the end? Maybe. Give us about three years. Please. Thank you for your patience, and thank you for Spider-Man. Merry Christmas, and happy holidays.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” dominated at the box office on Christmas Eve.\n\n\tJames Cameron’s third sci-fi epic unwrapped $10.7 million on Wednesday from 3,800 North American theaters. That’s less than its predecessor, 2022’s $2 billion behemoth “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which earned $14.8 million on Christmas Eve. However that year, Christmas Eve fell on a Saturday, which is a much more popular day of the week for moviegoing.\n\n\n\t“Avatar 3,” from Disney’s 20th Century Studios, is projected to collect $75 million to $80 million between Thursday and Sunday. So far, the big-budget film has grossed $129.6 million domestically and $353.7 million overseas, bringing its global tally to $483.3 million after a week of release.\n\t\n\n\tThree new films — A24’s Timothée Chalamet-led sports dramedy “Marty Supreme,” the Focus Features musical drama “Song Sung Blue” and Sony’s disaster comedy “Anaconda” — were playing in previews ahead of their Christmas Day debuts. \n\n\t“Anaconda” made $2.1 million from 2,808 theaters during Wednesday’s previews. The PG-13 adventure is expected to secure around $20 million between Thursday and Sunday. A $45 million-budgeted meta-reboot, “Anaconda” follows best friends who travel to the jungle to pursue their childhood dream of remaking their all-time favorite movie (you guessed it!) 1997’s “Anaconda.” The project starts to unravel when life imitates art and a real anaconda begins hunting them down.\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” was ever-so-slightly behind “Anaconda” on box office charts with $2.01 million from 2,668 venues during Wednesday’s previews. After one weekend in limited release, the R-rated film has generated $3.15 million to date. “Marty Supreme” is targeting a launch above $20 million through the four-day holiday frame. That’s a great start for the arthouse film, which carries a hefty $70 million budget. It helps that Chalamet, who stars as the fictional table tennis champ Marty Mauser, has been a one-man marketing machine, going to great lengths — and heights — to get out the word about the original film, directed by Josh Safdie of “Uncut Gems” fame.\n\t\n\n\t“Song Sung Blue” didn’t report Wednesday previews. The film is projected to earn $10 million to $14 million from 2,400 theaters in its first weekend of release. Brewer directed the $30 million-budgeted movie, featuring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson in the true story of two down-on-their luck musicians who form a Neil Diamond tribute band.\n\n\tMeanwhile Disney’s animated juggernaut “Zootopia 2” outpaced the other newcomers in second place on Wednesday charts with $3.2 million from 3,540 cinemas. Since its debut around Thanksgiving, the PG film has generated $296 million domestically and $1.3 billion globally, making “Zootopia 2” the highest-grossing Hollywood release of the year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMartin Scorsese honored the late Reiners in an essay published in The New York Times, writing, “Rob Reiner was my friend, and so was Michele. From now on, I’ll have to use the past tense, and that fills me with such profound sadness. But there’s no other choice.”\n\n\tThe Reiners, aged 78 and 70, were found dead in their Brentwood home on Dec. 14 with knife wounds. Their 32-year-old son, Nick Reiner, has been arrested and charged with two counts of murder.\n\t\n\n\tScorsese first got to know Rob Reiner shortly after moving to Los Angeles in the early 1970s, when he started going to get-togethers hosted by George Memmoli and filled with comedians and actors.\n\n\n\t“Rob and I were both Eastern transplants, in a way,” Scorsese wrote. Reiner came from show business royalty, his parents being the performers Carl and Estelle Reiner. “This was 100 percent New York humor, and it was in the air I breathed.”\n\n\t“Right away, I loved hanging out with Rob. We had a natural affinity for each other. He was hilarious and sometimes bitingly funny, but he was never the kind of guy who would take over the room,” Scorsese wrote. “He had a beautiful sense of uninhibited freedom, fully enjoying the life of the moment, and he had a great barreling laugh. When they honored him at Lincoln Center, Michael McKean did a bit, which was a brilliant parody of solemn official tribute speeches. Before he got to the punchline, Rob laughed so hard you could hear it throughout the auditorium.”\n\n\tScorsese’s favorite film directed by Reiner is “Misery,” which he described as “a very special film, beautifully acted by Kathy Bates and James Caan.” And he wrote that “This Is Spinal Tap” is “in a class of its own … an immaculate creation.” When Scorsese was casting his 2013 film “The Wolf of Wall Street,” he “immediately thought of Rob” to play the father of Leonardo DiCaprio’s Jordan Belfort.\n\t\n\n\t“He could improvise with the best, he was a master at comedy, he worked beautifully with Leo and the rest of the guys, and he understood the human predicament of his character: The man loved his son, he was happy with his success, but he knew that he was destined for a fall,” Scorsese wrote of Reiner. “There’s that wonderful moment where Rob watches as Jon Favreau explains to Leo that he can get out relatively unscathed if he just walks away from his company before the S.E.C. has a chance to charge him with violations. The look on Rob’s face, as he realizes that Leo is hesitating and that he ultimately won’t stop, is so eloquent. ‘You got all the money in the world,’ he says. ‘You need everybody else’s money?’ A loving father, mystified by his son.” \n\n\tScorsese added, “I was moved by the delicacy and openness of his performance when we shot it, moved once again as we brought the scene together in the edit and moved as I watched the finished picture. Now, it breaks my heart to even think of the tenderness of Rob’s performance in this and other scenes.”\n\n\tThe filmmaker concluded his essay: “What happened to Rob and Michele is an obscenity, an abyss in lived reality. The only thing that will help me to accept it is the passing of time. So, like all of their loved ones and their friends — and these were people with many, many friends — I have to be allowed to imagine them alive and well … and that one day, I’ll be at a dinner or a party and find myself seated next to Rob, and I’ll hear his laugh and see his beatific face and laugh at his stories and relish his natural comic timing, and feel lucky all over again to have him as a friend.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story discusses spoilers for “Anaconda,” now playing in theaters\n\n\tWhen co-writers Tom Gormican and Kevin Etten first pitched what would become their reimagined take on the so-bad-it’s-good 1997 classic “Anaconda,” they never thought Sony would be on board with the idea. \n\n\t“We went to them and said, ‘If we could make ‘The Big Chill’ becomes ‘Anaconda,’ then we’d be interested,’” said Gormican. “We expected them to laugh, [But] they bought it. It was one of those strange pitches where we’re going, ‘No, no, you guys can’t do this. You can’t.’ And they’re like, ‘We want to do this with you.’” \n\t\n\n\tPremiering on Christmas, this “Anaconda,” also directed by Gormican, is not a reboot, remake or even a continuation of the original. While the ’90s reptilian horror provides a solid springboard for the film, the new “Anaconda” is something different entirely, centering not on a National Geographic crew but rather a group of life-long, middle-aged friends who head to the Amazon to shoot their own version of the original film. Stars Paul Rudd, Jack Black, Steve Zahn and Thandiwe Newton soon find themselves fighting for survival against the world’s largest snake (which is even larger this time around, thanks to CGI). And while it definitely has nods to its predecessor, it was important to Gormican to toe the line carefully. \n\n\n\t“These are two stories about taking a boat up the river, right?” said Gormican. “A snake basically slithers on land or in the water. It can either wrap around you or bite you. So you’re locked into the ways that it kills, and you’re locked into a structure of going from point A to point B, which is what this shares with the original story…I have a lot of reverence for the original. I love what they did. [But] I didn’t want to play in that sandbox.”  \n\t\n\n\tInstead, they upped the comedic ante, creating what Gormican describes as a “buddy movie that becomes an adventure film that becomes an action film that becomes a horror film.” (He cites “City Slickers” and “American Movie” as points of inspiration). “Audiences are just tired of not seeing original stories,” he explained. “It’s been a decade of, ‘Here’s some remakes of stuff that you used to love,’ and there’s a limit to people’s nostalgia.” \n\n\tThis “Anaconda” is also full of meta elements that poke fun of Hollywood itself. Famously charismatic Rudd plays a struggling actor in Los Angeles, and the rag-tag group runs into a “real” Sony crew filming a reboot of “Anaconda” who joke about Hollywood having “no new ideas.” The characters also stumble upon original “Anaconda” star Ice Cube, who is on the studio’s snake-destroyed set to reprise his role. When they ask how the writers planned to kill the reptile in their movie, he responds they never finished the script. \n\n\t“It was mirroring exactly what was happening,” said Gormican, who lost two final locations while filming in Australia — the first being a factory that then went on strike, and the second being a boatyard the crew had created, only for it to get destroyed by a cyclone. Parts of the latter set actually made it into the movie as they pivoted to end the film using what was left of it: “We went in and made it look [purposefully] destroyed,” explained Gormican. “And we just said it was a snake.” \n\n\tAnd while “Anaconda” doesn’t get too sentimental over its source material, it does capitalize on a few familiar faces. In addition to Ice Cube, Jennifer Lopez also has a cameo in the film, where the two actors play themselves. “We were always thinking that it would be fun to have the surviving members,” said Gormican, especially once they decided the friends would run into the filming of the reboot. “So we just kept reaching out.” Ultimately, both joined in, giving the film their “stamp of approval.” And, yes, they considered bringing back other “Anaconda” actors, though it ended up not making sense to: “If they died in the original, would they be back at the remake if their character was dead?”\n\n\tAbove all else, with this new “Anaconda,” Gormican was dedicated to creating a film that felt like fun. \n\t\n\n\t“The thing that I’ve been missing in my cinema-going experience is a movie for everyone, that plays in a massively fun, adventurous way,” said Gormican. “People lament the loss of the communal feeling of being at a comedy together. And I hope that people get a chance to experience that in this film, and maybe ignite something in  a younger generation where they go, ‘Oh, shit. That’s actually something we love to do.’”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSpoiler warning: This article contains spoilers for “Marty Supreme,” now in theaters.\n\n\tJosh Safdie‘s “Marty Supreme” is galvanized by an invigorating performance by Timothée Chalamet as the cocky young table tennis champion Marty Mauser. Safdie and his crew faithfully recreated the world of 1950s ping pong players in New York, Tokyo and beyond, then populated that milieu with a cast of memorable supporting characters from movie star Kay Stone, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, to her ruthless businessman husband, played by Mr. Wonderful himself, Kevin O’Leary.\n\t\n\n\tThe details of the parlors and matches are so carefully rendered that it’s no surprise that Safdie is very familiar with that world. In fact, his 2008 film “The Pleasure of Being Robbed” features a sequence set in a Chinatown table tennis parlor. \n\n\n\t“The people who excelled at table tennis were often people who didn’t fit anywhere else,” says Safdie in the film’s press materials. “It wasn’t respected, so naturally it attracted weirdos, purists, obsessives.”\n\n\tIn addition to doing extensive historical research, the crew consulted experts, including Steve Grant, publisher of Table Tennis History magazine, who spoke to Variety about the inspiration for the film.\n\t\n\t\tWas Marty Mauser based on a real person?\t\n\n\tMarty Mauser, played by Chalamet, is based on a real table tennis champion of the 1950s, Marty Reisman, who died in 2012. Sports Illustrated called him “the game’s most celebrated hustler.” While the film is only loosely inspired by his story, the character definitely shares similarities with Reisman, Grant explains.\n\t\n\n\t“He was very good at marketing himself,” Grant says, “That was his biggest skill. Of course, he was a very good player.” But like Marty Mauser, who plays pretty loose with the truth, Reisman likely inflated his stories, Grant says. Reisman’s book, “The Money Player,” is a “great book about his career back in the ’50s,” Grant explains. “But don’t take everything in it as the word of truth. He liked to exaggerate things.”\n\n\tWhen Safdie came across an old copy of “The Money Player,” he sparked to the idea of a story based on Reisman. “When I read that the sport was filling stadiums in the U.K. and throughout Europe, I realized that it was entirely plausible for a kid in 1952 to actually believe he could parlay the game into a life of fame and glory,” Safdie said in the press materials.\n\t\n\t\tHow many of Marty Supreme’s stunts were real?\t\n\n\tWhile many of Marty Mauser’s antics stretch credulity, the real Reisman, nicknamed “the needle” for his slight build and fast swing, was known for his showmanship and hustle. He could split a cigarette in half with a ping pong ball from across the net and would play blindfolded or sitting down if the stakes were high enough. As shown in the film, he and a partner did tour the world with the Harlem Globetrotters with a comedy ping pong routine in which they hit balls with frying pans and sneakers.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tVariety’s announcement of “The Money Player” option\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe real Reisman pulled off enough wild escapades to fill a whole other movie, according to an extensive Sports Illustrated profile — as he traveled the world, he was smuggling and selling goods, from nylon stockings to fine crystal, and challenging heads of state to high-stakes games. He really did fly on a military transport, as shown in the film, and did briefly work in a shoe store. Reisman told the magazine his book had sold to the movies, and he proposed that Robert De Niro could play him. But although it was optioned after publication, according to a 1974 Variety article, the project never got off the ground.\n\t\n\t\tDid Reisman really lose the World Championship to a Japanese player?\t\n\n\tReisman traveled to India, not Japan as in the movie, to compete against Hiroji Satoh. As depicted in the film, he took a hard loss to Satoh, who was using a new sponge rubber-coated type of paddle. But the loss came in round 64, not the final. “The truth was he would have had to win five more matches in 1952 to win the title, and he was not the top favorite,” Grant explains.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWere there other Jewish table tennis champions? \t\n\n\t“Fellow Jewish New Yorker Dick Miles won many championships in the 1940s and ’50s, well before Reisman won much of anything,” Grant explains. In fact, Jewish Europeans, especially Hungarians, dominated table tennis in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1950s, Asian and particularly Japanese players began to gain prominence in the sport.\n\t\n\t\tWere any other characters based on real people?\t\n\n\tWhile many of the film’s characters feel deeply authentic, most are fictional, with the exception of Koto Endo, played by real-life champion Koto Kawaguchi and based on Reisman’s competitor Satoh. There’s also basketball star George “The Ice Man” Gervin, who plays a character based on Herwald Lawrence, who owned a ping pong parlor that was the first Black-owned business in Times Square.\n\n\tPlaywright David Mamet has a cameo in the film and he has a historic ping pong connection. Mamet, who was a table tennis hustler himself in his college days, used to frequent Reisman’s table tennis gym on the Upper West Side, along with other notables including Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHowie Klein, a veteran record executive, radio DJ and political activist who was a leader in the famously artist-friendly Warner Music family during its golden era of the 1980s and early ‘90s, died Wednesday after a long battle with pancreatic cancer, according to a social media post from his sister. He was 77.\n\n\tHe was a top executive at Sire Records during the label’s peak era — a time when the label had everyone from the Smiths and Depeche Mode to Madonna and Lou Reed on its roster — and later was president of Warner’s Reprise label from 1989 to 2001. He was a co-founder of the San Francisco-based 415 Records during the 1970s, and was a strong and vocal presence in the music industry’s anti-censorship efforts in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, focusing on political activism in his later years.\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Brooklyn in 1948, Klein began his music career at Long Island’s Stony Brook University, where he began writing about music and later booked many legendary artists to perform at the school, a list that reads like a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame from the late 1960s: the Who, Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, Otis Redding, Pink Floyd, the Doors, Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, Tim Buckley, Jackson Browne, and many others. \n\n\tHe spent several years traveling in Asia and Europe before settling in San Francisco in 1976. There, he became a popular DJ at the city’s KSAN-FM and was a vocal supporter of the city’s then-nascent punk and alternative scenes; on the station, he interviewed such acts as the Sex Pistols, Devo, Iggy Pop, the Cramps and others. In 1978, he co-founded the San Francisco-based 415 Records, which released singles and albums by Romeo Void, Wire Train, the Nuns, Translator and others, several of which were distributed by major labels.\n\t\n\n\tKlein moved to Los Angeles to join Sire Records in 1987, which was then at the peak of its reign as a mecca of alternative music. He played a key role in bringing Lou Reed to the label and helping to launch his legendary “New York” album, which revitalized the singer-songwriter’s career and was seen by many as his late peak. Klein often spoke of the signing as a full-circle moment, as he had seen Reed perform with the Velvet Underground first as part of Andy Warhol’s “Exploding Plastic Inevitable” show in 1966, and also at one of his last shows with the band at New York’s Max’s Kansas City nightclub four years later.\n\n\tAfter just two years he was elevated to president of Reprise Records, the Warner label founded by Frank Sinatra, a post he held for the next 13 years. Among the dozens of acts he worked closely with during these years are Green Day, Ice-T, the Ramones, the Pretenders, Neil Young, Alanis Morissette, Eric Clapton, Fleetwood Mac and many others. \n\n\tDuring these years the music industry, and Warner Music in particular, was a frequent target of censorship efforts by right-wing organizations — notably the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), many of them aimed at gangsta rap and heavy metal, and Klein became an outspoken purveyor of free speech in the business and the country. He was a leader of the Rock the Vote campaign and other efforts, and had found the causes that would occupy much of his later life. His efforts were recognized twice with Spirit of Liberty Awards from People for the American Way; in 1999 he shared that honor with filmmaker and actor Rob Reiner. \n\n\tIn 2000, he was honored by the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California with its Bill of Rights Award.\n\n\tIn 2001, following Time Warner’s ill-fated merger with AOL, Klein accepted a buyout and resigned from his post. Ironically, a day after his resignation, his successor rejected the new album from Wilco, “Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,” setting off a controversy, documented in the film “I Am Trying to Break Your Heart,” that ultimately resulted in a bidding war over the album that saw a different Warner label, Nonesuch, re-signing the band.\n\n\tIn his later years, Klein published a political blog and social media account titled DownWithTyranny! and worked with such organizations as the Blue America PAC, the Progressive Congress Action Fund and others. \n",

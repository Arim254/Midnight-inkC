    "body": "\n\tDisney+ is not moving forward with its TV adaptation of the Louis Sachar novel “Holes” — which was the basis of Disney’s 2003 film of the same name — after ordering a pilot at the beginning of this year.\n\n\tSachar’s novel was published in 1998 and won a National Book Award and a Newbery Medal. The film, directed by Andrew Davis, starred Shia LaBeouf as Stanley Yelnats, a teenager sent to a juvenile detention camp called Camp Green Lake for a crime he did not commit. There, while being forced to spend every day digging holes in the desert, he discovers a shocking connection between the land and his family. The cast also included Sigourney Weaver, Khleo Thomas, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Patricia Arquette, Dulé Hill and Eartha Kitt. Both the book and the movie were critical and commercial successes.\n\t\n\n\tThe new Disney+ pilot was gender bent, following a teenage girl at a detention camp instead of a boy. Shay Rudolph was set to play Hayley, the lead role, with Greg Kinnear as the warden. The cast also included Aidy Bryant as camp counselor Sissy, Noah Cottrell as kitchen employee Kitch and Flor Delis Alicea, Anire Kim Amoda, Iesha Daniels, Sophie Dieterlen, Alexandra Doke and Maeve Press as Hayley’s fellow campers at Camp Yucca.\n\n\n\tThe “Holes” pilot had Alina Mankin attached as writer with Liz Phang as showrunner and Jac Schaeffer as director. Executive producers included Mankin, Phang, Drew Goddard via Goddard Textiles, Sarah Esberg and Mike Medavoy via Shamrock, which holds the rights. Goddard Textiles’ Andrea Massaro was a co-executive producer. The pilot was produced by Walden Media, which produced the film, and 20th Television was the studio.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrançois Ozon has emerged as the early frontrunner in France’s awards season, with “The Stranger” leading the nominations for the 31st Lumières Awards. \n\n\tConsidered France’s equivalent to the Golden Globes, the Lumières Awards are voted on by international journalists from 36 countries and are handed out during a ceremony that takes place roughly a month before the Cesar Awards and kicks off France’s awards season. The Lumières ceremony will be hosted on Jan. 18 at Paris’ Institut du monde arabe.“The Stranger,” an adaptation of Albert Camus’ literary masterpiece which was backed by Gaumont and world premiered at Venice, scored six nominations; ahead of Richard Linklater’s “Nouvelle Vague,” a black-and-white love letter to the French cinematic movement known as the New Wave, which opened at Cannes and landed five Lumières nods. \n\t\n\n\tDominik Moll’s “Case 137,” which is set during France’s yellow vests protests; and Stéphane Demoustier’s “The Great Arch,” a historical drama starring Claes Bang, followed closely with four nominations each. All four titles will compete for best film; alongside Abdellatif Kechiche’s “Mektoub My Love: Canto Due,” which is the last chapter of the controversial French-Tunisian filmmaker’s coming-of-age trilogy and picked up three nominations.\n\n\n\tAside from best film, “The Stranger” is nominated for best director, actor for Benjamin Voisin, screenplay, cinematography and original score. Set in the early 1940s, the film depicts life in Algeria, then under French colonial rule and stars Voisin as the novel’s antihero, Meursault, who is sentenced to death after shooting a young Arab man five times. Voisin stars opposite rising French talent Rebecca Marder. \n\n\t“Nouvelle Vague,” meanwhile, is competing for best director, screenplay, best male newcomer for Guillaume Marbeck and best cinematography.\n\t\n\n\tOther notable nominees include Jodie Foster, who delivers a bold French-language performance as a tormented psychiatrist alongside Daniel Auteuil in Rebecca Zlotowski’s humor-laced thriller “A Private Life;” “Arco,” Ugo Bienvenu’s animated feature voiced and produced by Natalie Portman; Hafsia Herzi’s queer coming-of-age drama “The Little Sister” which won Cannes’ best actress prize for Nadia Melliti and just picked up the Louis Delluc Award from French Critics earlier this week; and Cannes boss Thierry Fremaux’s documentary feature “Lumière ! L’Aventure Continue,” an exploration of the invention of cinema showcasing more than 100 immaculately restored short films shot by Louis and Auguste Lumière.\n\n\tFoster will be facing off Isabelle Huppert for her colorful – and lauded — performance in “The Richest Woman in the World,” a film loosely based on the 2010 Bettencourt Affair involving the heiress to the L’Oreal empire. Lea Drucker in “Case 137,” Vicky Krieps  in “Love Me Tender” and Melanie Thierry in “La Chambre de Mariana” round up the best actress category.  \n\n\tJafar Panahi‘s “It Was Just an Accident,” a morally charged thriller that the Iranian filmmaker shot clandestinely, is vying for best international co-production, alongside Kleber Mendonça Filho’s Brazilian period thriller “The Secret Agent,” Albert Serra’s “Tardes de Soledad,” Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” and Kaouther Ben Hania’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab.” Nominations for the 31st Lumières Awards:\n\n\tBest Film\n\n\t“Case 137,” Dominik Moll“The Stranger,” François Ozon“The Great Arch,” Stéphane Demoustier“Mektoub My Love: Canto Due,” Abdellatif Kechiche“Nouvelle Vague,” Richard LinklaterBest Director\n\n\t“The Great Arch,” Stéphane Demoustier“Mektoub My Love: Canto Due,” Abdellatif Kechiche“Nouvelle Vague,” Richard Linklater“Case 137,” Dominik Moll“The Stranger,” François OzonBest Screenplay\n\n\t“The Great Arch,” Stéphane Demoustier“Nouvelle Vague,” Holly Gent, Vince Palmo and Michèle Halberstadt“Nino,” Pauline Loquès“Case 137,” Dominik Moll and Gilles Marchand“The Stranger,” François OzonBest Documentary“Le Chant des Forêts,” Vincent Munier“Dites-lui que je l’aime,” Romane Bohringer“Lumière !

    "description": "\n\tElle Fanning‘s first arrest came at a Sabrina Carpenter concert. Just an hour before leaving for the show, she received a text: “Getting arrested to",
    "body": "\n\tElle Fanning‘s first arrest came at a Sabrina Carpenter concert. Just an hour before leaving for the show, she received a text: “Getting arrested tonight. Dress accordingly.”\n\n\tThe mock arrest, captured on the big screen for all concertgoers to see, was worth it.\n\n\t“At least it was a joint arrest,” Fanning laughs, referring to sharing the experience with her sister Dakota. “If it’s going to happen, might as well happen together.”\n\n\n\tIt’s fitting that Fanning approaches even staged arrests with grace and humor, because in Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” she plays Rachel Kemp, a Hollywood actress who must learn the hardest lesson of all: how to walk away from something she desperately wants.\n\t\n\n\tThe role came as a surprise. “I was a big fan, obviously, of ‘The Worst Person in the World,’ like everyone,” Fanning says. “You think of directors, and you think, ‘Yeah, Joachim, he’s on my bucket list,’ but I didn’t know if there would ever necessarily be a part for me.”\n\n\tWhen the script arrived while she was in New York preparing to shoot “Predator: Badlands” in New Zealand, her heart started racing. “I didn’t even necessarily care what the part was. After reading the script, I was in tears. And then I really just related to Rachel Kemp so much. I could just see how I wanted to play her.”\n\n\tWhat followed was a logistical ballet worthy of Rachel herself: rehearsals in Oslo, shooting an action franchise in New Zealand, then flying directly to France to film beach scenes with Stellan Skarsgård at the Deauville Film Festival — all while the festival was happening. Two studios worked together to make it possible, a rare feat in Hollywood, Fanning notes.\n\t\n\n\tRachel Kemp is an actress in crisis, miscast in a prestigious European film but desperate to prove herself. She’s goal-oriented, slightly thirsty, and lost.\n\n\t“I think you’re right,” Fanning says when asked about drawing from the experiences of actors she’s worked with. “There are definitely feelings that I can relate to, or maybe my younger self has felt. We find her at a place when she’s lost, and a little depressed herself. I don’t think she feels like she has much agency over her career and choices. She feels that she has so much to give, but you have to be given the opportunities or placed in those roles to show that.”\n\n\tThe key, Fanning explains, was balancing Rachel’s Hollywood star quality with her vulnerability. “I was aware that audiences have to believe that she is a big star. So there has to be a bit of that air.” But Rachel is also learning something crucial that she points to: “She’s learning how to say no for the first time and think to be confident in being like, as much as she wants something, she’s walking away for reasons that aren’t like, the director is a monster, or it didn’t pay enough money. She knows it’s a great opportunity, but she knows that it’s just not right. And that can be very hard for actors.”\n\n\tThe role comes at a pivotal moment in Fanning’s career. Having acted since age two — starting with playing young Dakota in “I Am Sam” — she’s navigated the treacherous transition from child star to adult actress with remarkable grace. Unlike many young actors who struggle to shed their childhood image, Fanning credits shows like Hulu’s period comedy “The Great” with helping audiences see her evolution in real time. “I felt myself growing in my power doing that show,” she reflects.\n\n\tNext on the docket is a long-gestating project. After years of delays, she’s finally preparing to shoot “The Nightingale” with Dakota, their first narrative film together through their production company. Originally scheduled to shoot in March 2020, the pandemic derailed those plans. “We were about to get on a plane to go to Budapest, right before the lockdown,” Fanning recalls. But she sees the silver lining: “Everything happens for a reason, and it’s even better now. We get to produce it now.”\n\n\tAs for those Oscar dreams, Fanning keeps it all in perspective. “I have been acting since I was two years old, so I have felt like I’ve had a lot of firsts, but I also know that I’m still young. It would be a very special thing. Of course, it’s the pinnacle of that, but you have to keep in perspective what matters in the world.”\n\t\n\n\tFor now, she’s savoring the response to “Sentimental Value” and the character who taught her — and Rachel — that sometimes the bravest thing an actress can do is walk away.\n\n\tOn this episode of the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast, Fanning discusses working on the Norwegian drama, transitioning from a child actor to one of the most exciting young adult performers, and finally getting to produce her first big feature with her sister Dakota. \n\n\tAlso on this episode, Amanda Seyfried, the star of the musical drama “The Testament of Ann Lee” who discusses dancing, singing and if we are getting “Mamma Mia 3.” Listen below!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMubi\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRead excerpts from her interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you get involved with Joachim Trier and “Sentimental Value”?\t\n\n\tI was a big fan of “The Worst Person in the World,” like everyone. You think of directors and you’re like, “Yeah, Joachim, he’s on my bucket list,” but I didn’t know if there would ever be a part for me. It all happened pretty quickly. I had finished “A Complete Unknown” and was about to go to New Zealand to film “Predator: Badlands,” and then I got a call saying Joachim was thinking of me. My heart just started racing. I didn’t even necessarily care what the part was. I wanted to work with him. After reading the script, I was in tears. I related to Rachel Kemp so much. We got on a long Zoom call, and we both had the same ideas about her. From that Zoom he said, “Okay, let’s do this.” But he also said, “I do like doing rehearsals, so you need to come to Oslo.”\n\t\n\t\tThat must have been complicated with your “Predator” schedule.\t\n\n\tThere was some scheduling stuff between “Predator” and “Sentimental Value.” I wanted to do both, which turned out to be kind of meta for the Rachel character. Two studios worked together to make it happen, which I’m so grateful for. Joachim finagled a couple of things too—he wanted to film the beach scenes in Deauville while the festival was happening. So I went to Oslo before New Zealand, we rehearsed for a week, and then I wrapped “Predator,” flew to Paris the next day, drove to Deauville and was on the beach with Stellan the next morning.\n\t\n\t\tWhat drew you to Rachel Kemp as a character?\t\n\n\tThere are definitely feelings I can relate to, or that my younger self has felt. We find her when she’s lost and a little depressed. She doesn’t feel she has much agency over her career, and she knows she has so much to give. Every actor wants the meaty role and a director who sees you and digs things out of you. Joachim is an expert at connecting with his actors and creating a safe space. I liked that she isn’t the cliché Hollywood star, but you still need a little of that air so audiences believe she’s famous. She’s also desperate and confused. She hits a real high during the monologue rehearsal—I’ve had that feeling on set—but it’s not captured on screen, which becomes a huge learning experience for her.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tRachel eventually walks away from something she really wants. Have you ever had to do that?\t\n\n\tI’m a very instinctual person when I choose projects, and normally the first gut reaction is the one. There have been times where I’ve tried to fit a square peg in a round hole, but your initial reaction is usually right. I’ve never walked away from something as far down the line as she does, but the feeling is universal. I also love how Joachim wrote that she hits that high and then is lost again, and Gustav isn’t giving her the answers. Rachel’s the one who realizes it’s not about his mother—it’s about his daughter. I was so happy I got to have that scene with Renate.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve been acting since you were two. How did you navigate the transition from child actor to adult roles?\t\n\n\tPeople talk a lot about that transition period. I feel lucky because it happened organically for me. “Super Eight” was a big role for me at 12—it was the first time people recognized me for me and not as my sister. “Somewhere” was so important because it wasn’t a kid’s film. Then “The Neon Demon” came along when I was 16. It was my taste, and I really pick the directors. Staying true to that made the transition feel effortless. “The Great” was a big turning point too, because you watch that character grow from a girl into the Empress of Russia. I felt myself growing in my power doing that show. And comedy is harder than drama—it taught me a lot.\n\t\n\t\tYou mentioned “A Complete Unknown” earlier. That role felt like a breakthrough.\t\n\n\tIt was such a tricky role because it was the least “famous” role in the movie. It’s easy to go into a biopic knowing someone’s voice or mythology. But Sylvie was like, “Who’s Sylvie?” It was the first time I saw myself doing the work for the audience to understand someone we don’t know. I wanted to make it as raw as possible.\n\t\n\t\tYou and Dakota are finally making “The Nightingale.” What has that process been like?\t\n\n\tWe were about to get on a plane to Budapest right before the lockdown in March 2020. Crew was already there. But in hindsight, everything happens for a reason. It’s even better now, and we get to produce it. It being a sister story—and us being sisters—is going to add a lot. We’re going in spring. I don’t fear it. I like fear. If you’re not getting nervous, that’s a problem. The book is beloved, and we want to stay true to it. We just have to do it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow do you and Dakota approach your careers differently?\t\n\n\tWe kept things separate growing up so we could find our own paths. Now we’re doing things together and have a production company. People who’ve worked with both of us say we work very differently. We’ve never run lines together or gotten involved in each other’s choices. Sometimes I’ll ask her, “Should I do this?” and she’ll ask me too, but we never talk about process. It’s going to have to merge soon—we’ll have to read lines together.\n\t\n\t\tWhat’s the best directorial note you’ve received?\t\n\n\tPeople say this all the time, but it’s true: I like simple notes. “Faster, angrier, slower.” Not over-analyzing or manipulating. I shut down with that. The best directors give you space but make you feel incredibly seen. Joachim is like that—he’s right next to the camera watching in real time. They’re not micromanaging. They want to be surprised, and I love surprising a director. Nicole Kidman once said, “Don’t ever cut a take.” If you think you messed up, just roll with it. The magic happens in the imperfections. I used to be a perfectionist about that, but I’ve tried to take her advice. It’s the director’s job to cut.\n\t\n\t\tHow would it feel to get an Oscar nomination after acting for so long?\t\n\n\tI would be really excited, and it would be very moving for me and my family. I’ve been acting since I was two, and there are still firsts. I had never been to the Oscars until last year, when I got to present. Being on that stage was incredible. You feel the Hollywood history and magic of it. I love old movies and old Hollywood stars. It’s the pinnacle. But you have to keep perspective about what matters—the experiences, the steppingstones. What will be, will be. Whatever happens, happens.\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

    "body": "\n\tHari Nef is starring alongside Louisa Jacobson and Oliver Edwin in “Situation #64.” The high-concept, psychological drama is Edwin’s directorial debut from his original script. It quietly wrapped production in Skaneateles, New York, last month.\n\n\tThe film follows Nef as a performance artist and Edwin as her former performance partner and lover, as they begin rehearsing their final piece. When his new partner (Jacobson) joins them and secrets of their past emerge, the gap between their work and reality blurs. \n\t\n\n\tThe film will mark Nef’s first as a producer following her turn in Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and HBO’s “The Idol.” Nef is also set to star as Candy Darling in a currently untitled biopic which she also wrote, and will produce. Her other credits include the Amazon original series “Transparent” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” as well as the film “Assassination Nation.”\n\n\n\t“I finally get to say that I’m making a movie with my friends. Oliver is a young auteur of rare precision and sensitivity. Louisa is deeply talented and kind. Lizzie and Lexi are among the most intrepid, discerning indie producers I have ever worked with. ‘Situation #64’ is the kind of film I have always wanted to do, and unlike any I’ve done yet,” said Nef.\n\n\tJacobson currently stars in Julian Fellowes’ Emmy-nominated HBO series, “The Gilded Age,” which was recently renewed for a fourth season. She also played a pivotal role in Celine Song’s summer hit, “The Materialists” opposite Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans. \n\n\tEdwin appeared in Rob Reiner’s “LBJ” and HBO’s “Divorce.” He has published essays, fiction and photographs, as well as several short films both behind and in front of the camera. “Situation #64,” which was chosen for the 2024 Tribeca Creator’s Market, will be his first feature film as a writer and director.\n\t\n\n\tThe film’s producers Lizzie Shapiro and Lexi Tannenholtz of The Space Program recently debuted their film, “The Plague,” at Cannes. It was directed by Charlie Polinger and stars Joel Edgerton. Independent Film Company acquired the picture and will release it this month. “Situation #64” is also being produced by Jason De Beer of Escape Route Films and Jake Casey of The Dazey Phase.\n\n\tExecutive producers include Gus Deardoff of The Space Program, Nathan Mardis of 2801 Productions, Andrew Peters, George Scarles, Tart Productions, Topher Lin, John King, Zachary Michel, Tinygiant’s Neil Champagne, Sara Eolin and Veronica Diaferia, Marco Vicini and Fernando Tsai of Oscura Film, and Tiffany Boyle and Elsa Ramo of Vested Interest.\n\n\tUTA Independent Film Group is repping worldwide sales rights for the film. Nef is repped by Gersh, Untitled Entertainment and Jackoway Austen Tyerman; Jacobson by CAA, Brookside Artist Management, Schreck Rose Dapello Adams Berlin & Dunham; and Edwin by Untitled Entertainment and Sloss Eckhouse Dasti Haynes. The Space Program is repped by UTA.\n",

We’ve diligently studied each of this year’s offerings from the major streamers, and this crop really has it all: mystery Santas, precocious kids, grand larceny, ski-slope bullies, chaste smooches, sculpted abs, snowstorms, messy divorces — and Oliver Hudson. With so many presents to choose from, this handy chart will help you pick the right movie for a hot cocoa-fueled evening by the fire.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFinding Joy\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chip Bergmann/Prime\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAmazon Prime Video\n\n\tLovelorn New York fashion designer Joy (Shannon Thornton) is stranded in a snowstorm in Colorado for Christmas. Luckily, a mysterious man, Ridge (Tosin Morohunfola), is ready to assist.\n\n\tCHEMISTRY: Fine? The enemies-to-lovers trope is convincing, but the cutting away to her two stoner friends distracts from the romance. \n\n\tCHEER: Negative. This could have taken place any time of year. \n\n\tVERDICT: If you’re looking for a light holiday romance, this isn’t it! (But it’s almost worth it for the very nontraditional Christmas movie ending.)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tChampagne Problems\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tNetflix\n\n\tExecutive Sydney (Minka Kelly) is sent to Paris to acquire a Champagne brand, then accidentally falls for the heir of the empire, Henri (Tom Wozniczka). \n\n\tCHEMISTRY: Decent. They hook up the night they meet(!) — plus, he doesn’t lose interest after she reveals her relatable tummy issues. \n\n\tCHEER: Pretty. How could Christmas in Paris with holiday markets and bubbly not be pretty? \n\n\tVERDICT: It’s charming and sweet, while reminding you to follow your heart, pursue your career aspirations … and go to Europe.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMerv\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Amazon/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAmazon Prime Video\n\n\tCharlie Cox and Zooey Deschanel are exes who split custody of their pup, Merv. But when Merv is diagnosed with depression, the trio heads to a pampered dog resort where the human romance rekindles. Plenty of cute set pieces and misunderstandings follow.\n\n\tCHEMISTRY: Intense. Cox and Deschanel play yearning just right, and once the sad reason behind their split is revealed, there won’t be a dry eye in the audience.\n\n\tCHEER: Apathetic. It’s snowy in one early scene, but most of the movie takes place on a Florida beach.\n\n\tVERDICT: It’s a mostly cute sitcom-level romp, but the lack of holiday tidings doesn’t make it feel seasonal at all.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMy Secret Santa\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tNetflix\n\n\t“Mrs. Doubtfire,” but with a single mom (Alexandra Breckenridge) cosplaying as St. Nick who falls in love with a nepo baby ski lodge tycoon (Ryan Eggold).\n\n\tCHEMISTRY: Low.

It looks like Buddy the Elf set-decorated this drenched-in-tinsel production. \n\n\tVERDICT: So delightfully sweet and sappy it will rot your teeth.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJoy to the World\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Hulu\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tHulu\n\n\tLifestyle author Joy (Emmanuelle Chriqui) enlists her best friend (Chad Michael Murray) to play her husband for a Christmas broadcast — but he’s a little too believable. \n\n\tCHEMISTRY: Joyful! The trope of the best friend who secretly wants more packs on extra heat here — pun intended for that kitchen kiss. \n\n\tCHEER: Happy. Joy and her fake family give her house a complete Christmas makeover. Gorgeous. \n\n\tVERDICT: Highly predictable, but combining veteran actors with great chemistry works holiday wonders.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tA Merry Little Ex-Mas\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tNetflix\n\n\tKate (Alicia Silverstone) and Everett (Oliver Hudson) are recent exes hoping to do Christmas as a family with the kids — but he brings along his new girlfriend. \n\n\tCHEMISTRY: Merry! Kate and Everett are clearly meant for each other, since they broke up for … no real reason. \n\n\tCHEER: Bright! There’s sledding, cozy sweaters, snuggling, tree trimming, snowmen and flannel everywhere. \n\n\tVERDICT: It’s the perfect family holiday vibe, and Pierson Fodé takes MVP as Chet, Kate’s hunky and good-natured fling.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJingle Bell Heist\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Rob Baker Ashton/Netflix ©2025\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tNetflix\n\n\tSophie (Olivia Holt) and Nick (Connor Swindells) are two desperate (and sexy!) singles who conspire to rob her greedy boss. \n\n\tCHEMISTRY: Sad. Sophie and Nick are much more focused on their tragic backstories than on flirting. \n\n\tCHEER: Happy. The mood is heavy, but the department store backdrop dazzles. \n\n\tVERDICT: If you’re looking for a sappy Hallmark movie knockoff, search elsewhere. But if you’re looking for a darkly comedic heist film with a Christmas setting, this is a solid watch.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tJim Carrey recently joined Vulture for an oral history to mark the 25th anniversary of “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” Ron Howard’s 2000 film adaptation of Dr. Seuss’s 1957 children’s book. The movie was a giant box office hit, earning $346 million worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2000 domestically, but it was also a tortuous experience for Carrey given the grueling transformation process. Carrey has been honest in previous interviews about how “excruciating” it was to play the Grinch under heavy makeup and prosthetics, but he revealed wild new details to Vulture about the process.\n\t\n\n\tRick Baker, the legendary make-up effects artist who won an Oscar for his work on “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” told the publication that the studio originally offered to just have Carrey painted green as the Grinch.\n\n\n\t“The studio said, ‘We’re paying Jim $20 million, and we want to see him. Just paint him green,'” Baker said. “But it’s not ‘How the Green Jim Carrey Stole Christmas.’ It’s ‘How the Grinch Stole Christmas.’ He should look like a fantasy character.\n\n\t“There was a popular movie website at the time, Ain’t It Cool News, and the guy who ran it was a fan of my work, and I contacted him,” Baker continued. “I said, ‘Listen, Universal wants to paint Jim Carrey green. I feel it’s a major mistake. I did a test on myself of what I think it should look like. Can you somehow say that you saw this test and that Universal is making a major mistake and they don’t know what the fuck they’re talking about?’ And he did. And it was outrageous responses from everybody. ‘What the hell is wrong with these people at Universal? I don’t want to see green Jim Carrey. I want to see a Grinch!’ Blah, blah, blah. So they finally caved in.”\n\t\n\n\tCarrey was also adamant about undergoing a full transformation into the character, much to his own detriment.\n\n\t“When it came down to actually designing the Grinch to look like the Grinch, they had to put the tip of my nose on the top of the bridge of the Grinch’s nose,” the comedian explained. “So, all of the rest of it was covered and I couldn’t breathe through my nose, and they had a real problem trying to get holes in the mask that could allow me to breathe through my nose. Ultimately, I ended up mouth-breathing through the entire movie.”Carrey continued, “The suit was made of unnervingly itchy yak hair that drove me insane all day long. I had ten-inch-long fingers, so I couldn’t scratch myself or touch my face or do anything. I had teeth that I had to find a way to speak around, and I had full contact lenses that covered the entire eyeball, and I could only see a tiny tunnel in front of me.”\n\n\tThe film’s producer, Brian Grazer, revealed to Vulture that the team originally offered Carrey the option of using digital special effects to turn his eyes green. But Carrey “didn’t want to do that. He wanted to have green eyes. They were like Frisbees in his eyes. He was in so much pain.”\n\n\t“It was something that I asked for that I can’t blame on anyone but myself,” Carrey admitted. “You’ve got to be careful what you ask for. You don’t think about it when you see an actor do a part that is about excruciating pain or whatever. But that actor has to live in that feeling. They don’t just go home and suddenly stop feeling it.”\n\n\tDirector Howard said Carrey “started having panic attacks” during the early days of filming because of how uncomfortable the transformation was on his body, adding: “I would see him lying down on the floor in between setups with a brown paper bag. Literally on the floor. He was miserable.”\n\n\tCarrey threatened to quit the movie after his first day of filming required eight hours in the makeup chair, with Howard revealing: “He was ready to give his $20 million back! I mean, he was sincere.”\n\n\tA solution came in the form of “a guy who trained the military on enduring imprisonment and torture,” who was brought on to the film’s set to prevent Carrey from quitting the movie and to teach him how to endure the hardship of his Grinch transformation.\n\n\t“Richard Marcinko was a gentleman that trained CIA officers and special-ops people how to endure torture,” Carrey said. “He gave me a litany of things that I could do when I began to spiral. Like punch myself in the leg as hard as I can. Have a friend that I trust and punch him in the arm. Eat everything in sight. Changing patterns in the room. If there’s a TV on when you start to spiral, turn it off and turn the radio on. Smoke cigarettes as much as possible. There are pictures of me as the Grinch sitting in a director’s chair with a long cigarette holder. I had to have the holder, because the yak hair would catch on fire if it got too close.”\n\t\n\n\t“Later on I found out that the gentleman that trained me to endure the Grinch also founded SEAL Team Six,” Carrey added. “But what really helped me through the makeup process, which they eventually pulled down to about three hours, was the Bee Gees. I listened through the makeup process to the entire Bee Gees catalogue. Their music is so joyful. I’ve never met Barry Gibb, but I want to thank him.”\n\n\tCarrey told ComicBook.com last year that he would be interested in playing the Grinch again if he was able to do it through motion capture technology and not makeup. \n\n\t“Oh, gosh, you know, if we could figure out the Grinch,” Carrey said at the time. “The thing about it is, on the day, I do that with a ton of makeup and can hardly breathe. It was an extremely excruciating process. The children were in my mind all the time. ‘It’s for the kids. It’s for the kids. It’s for the kids.’ And now, with motion capture and things like that, I could be free to do other things. Anything is possible in this world.”\n\n\tSpecial effects makeup artist Kazuhiro Tsuji worked with Baker on applying Carrey’s makeup every day and once revealed that he checked into therapy after working with Carrey because the actor was so difficult in the makeup chair.\n\n\t“In the makeup trailer he just suddenly stands up and looks in the mirror, and pointing on his chin, he goes, ‘This color is different from what you did yesterday,’” Tsuji once told Vulture. “I was using the same color I used yesterday. He says, ‘Fix it.’ And okay, you know, I ‘fixed’ it. Every day was like that.”\n\n\tHead over to Vulture’s website to read the full “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” oral history.\n\t\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains minor spoilers from “Silent Night, Deadly Night,” now in theaters.\n\n\tThe 1984 slasher “Silent Night, Deadly Night”",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains minor spoilers from “Silent Night, Deadly Night,” now in theaters.\n\n\tThe 1984 slasher “Silent Night, Deadly Night” was an above-average movie, which grew in infamy due to advertising that depicted a bloodied, axe-wielding Santa. Nationwide protests to shield children from the images coincided with the opening, which, of course, had the unintentional effect of drumming up more business. This ultimately led to four more chapters in the series and a loose 2012 reboot, yet most of the movies haven’t stood the test of time in the horror community compared to franchises like “Halloween” or “A Nightmare on Elm Street.”\n\t\n\n\tIn fact, horror filmmaker Mike P. Nelson says his first experience with “Deadly Night” wasn’t the film itself, but rather the advertising campaign.\n\n\n\t“I was born in ’82 and the movie came out in ’84,” Nelson says. “I do feel like a lot of people my age who weren’t able to watch the movie remember that poster: Santa Claus, but then he’s got an axe, and he’s coming down the chimney. That left a pretty big impression on me. From there, that movie was always forbidden. Not that my parents were like on the whole bandwagon of “Ban this movie,” but like horror movies in general, it was off limits. So I didn’t see it until much later in life.”\n\n\tPerhaps that’s why, when he was asked if he wanted to pitch an idea for a remake, Nelson went with a bold vision that wasn’t nostalgically beholden to the plot of the original.\n\n\t“It was super important to me to not over-think it,” he says. “I think it’s so easy to go into these and be like, ‘Oh my God, what does everybody want to see?’ And then you get mush. You get a gray pile of mush because you’re either trying to satisfy everybody or it’s too close to the original.”\n\t\n\n\tThe result is a wholly different “Silent Night, Deadly Night,” written and directed by Nelson, in theaters Friday via Cineverse. Outside of some key elements and nods to the original film series, it is nowhere near a beat-by-beat remake of the original. In Nelson’s vision, a young Billy Chapman (Rohan Campbell) witnesses a family tragedy perpetrated by a psychotic Santa. This causes him to snap and grow up to become a red-suited killer himself, guided by a mysterious imaginary voice in his head. But once he falls in love with a young woman (Ruby Modine) in a small town with her own issues, things go in very unexpected — and bloody — directions.\n\n\tSurprisingly, Nelson says the romantic thread of “Deadly Night” took inspiration from Will Ferrell and Zooey Deschanel’s quirky, mismatched flirtation in another holiday favorite, 2003’s “Elf.”\n\n\t“I’d be lying if I said that had no influence,” he says. “We have two very different people in our movie, obviously, but they have their thing. Billy literally has a demon in his head, and Pam is dealing with her own demons and explosive personality disorder. What does that look like when those two people come together? Is it explosive? Is it perfect? Or is it explosive perfection? It’s this perfect merging of these people that are going through crazy shit.”\n\n\tWhile Nelson has had success in taking big swings with genre reboots in the past — including the well-received 2021 “Wrong Turn” and this year’s “Friday the 13th” short film “Sweet Revenge” — he says that even the marketing team behind “Deadly Night” was surprised at how much the central relationship resonated with audiences.\n\n\t“We got to see what people responded to in that first screening, and we were all surprised at how well people responded to the love story and the warm, fuzzy, almost Hallmark-y vibe of it,” he says. “It was really cool. We knew it was there, but it’s ‘Silent Night, Deadly Night.’ It’s a horror film. But when we found that really good response to that, the marketing team said, ‘Well, let’s put more of that in [to the promotion]. Let’s show that there is a relationship story. There’s this romance, a kind of whimsy to it.’ Strangely enough, that has been a really good thing for the movie. I think it’s opened a wider audience. ‘Yeah, this movie is going to be probably violent and bloody, but there’s also this other aspect to it that I’m very intrigued about. It’s this love story.'”\n\t\n\n\tLike any good slasher, Nelson admits that he’s already considering more gory installments.\n\n\t“Ruby and I have already started talking about weird things, like where things could go,” he says. “We’ve been having a lot of fun. We’ve already created a handful of moments and scenes we’d love to see in it, and it’s absolutely off the wall. It’s a lot of fun, though, and it keeps in the same spirit of the movie. You learn more about the lore. But it remains a relationship movie. It remains a love story. There are so many fun things that we play with and expand on.”\n\n\tWatch the “Silent Night, Deadly Night” trailer below.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tHitchcock & Herrmann — the alliteration rolls off the tongue almost as agreeably as the collaboration between Alfred Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann ",
    "body": "\n\tHitchcock & Herrmann — the alliteration rolls off the tongue almost as agreeably as the collaboration between Alfred Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann came to fruition in the 1950s and ’60s. Their relationship and work together on such films as “Vertigo,” “Psycho,” “The Man Who Knew Too Much” and “North by Northwest” is celebrated in the thoughtful exegesis that is Steven C. Smith‘s must-read dual biography, “Hitchcock & Herrmann: The Friendship & Film Scores That Changed Cinema.”\n\t\n\n\tSmith (who will be speaking in person at New York’s Film Forum this weekend) has been to the Herrmann well before, having authored the 1991 book “A Heart at Fire’s Center: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann,” which has become a staple in the library of any serious student of film scoring. In-between then and now, he published the equally estimable “Music by Max Steiner: The Epic Life of Hollywood’s Most Influential Composer.” (Read Variety‘s 2020 interview with Smith about Max Steiner here.) But most roads having to do with brilliant film composing ultimately lead back to Herrmann, as they have for his biographer with this new work. “Hitchcock & Herrmann” is an especially fun read, even for those who aren’t particularly knowledgeable about film music, because the two personalities in question are at least as interesting as their landmark films, individually, let alone in tandem.\n\n\n\tVariety talked with Smith about how these two brilliant men brought out the best in each other — and the very best in mid-century cinema — before their volatile personalities inevitably led to a sadly abrupt split that cineastes still speculate about today. He’s got the answers, of course, so read the following Q&A to pick up some of them… or, if you’re in New York, go to his talk Sunday at Film Forum at 1:10 p.m. (He’ll also be introducing “The Man Who Knew Too Much” Friday evening and “North by Northwest” Saturday. Get ticketing information here.)\n\t\n\n\tHas anybody done a book specifically about a composer/director collaboration before, or would this be the first?\n\n\tThat’s a good question. My friend Tim Greiving has just published his John Williams biography, and it devotes a lot of space, understandably, to the Spielberg relationship. But I’m not aware of any other book that focuses entirely on a director/composer relationship, and I think that this is the most interesting one. You know, it’s a fun game to play about which is the greatest pairing — is it Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone? Is it Spielberg and John Williams? Is it Truffaut and Georges Delerue? You can go through all these pairings, but I think that Hitchcock and Herrmann are the best for a book because, also, I’m not sure we will ever see personalities as outsized as theirs ever again.\n\n\tYou published a Herrmann biography as your first book in the early ‘90s. What made you want to revisit him?\n\n\tThe reason I wrote this book after publishing a biography of Bernard Herrmann in 1991 is because there was so much that I discovered about the relationship between these two men. But also, when I started that book in the 1980s, people in the industry didn’t necessarily even know who Bernard Herrmann was. I remember telling several people about him who should know and didn’t know until I mentioned “Psycho.”  And then after my book was published, suddenly not only was Herrmann’s name better known, but his music was everywhere. It started to be used in movies: “The Artist,” “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” “Kill Bill”…  Lady Gaga used the “Vertigo” main title almost intact in the video for “Born This Way.” I had interviewed Stephen Sondheim for my first book, but he was talking much more in his later years about how “Sweeney Todd” was his homage to Herrmann, and that he built it on what he thought of as his Bernard Herrmann chord. So there were all these extraordinary sightings of Herrmann, and especially Hitchcock/Herrmann, coming up.\n\n\tIt’s inescapable: Herrmann’s music was used in “Wednesday.” Ryan Murphy has licensed Herrmann music in several of his projects. It’s astonishing that now the music’s everywhere. But it was fun going back to talk about things like how, when the Beatles recorded “Eleanor Rigby” in 1966 and Paul McCartney wanted strings, their brilliant producer George Martin based the string arrangement on the main title of “Psycho.” When I give my presentations, and put the music side by side, you can really hear the influence of the famous chugging prelude of “Psycho” on the string arrangement of “Eleanor Rigby,” something that Paul has talked about.\n\t\n\n\tAnd then, as thoroughly as I researched my original biography of Herrmann, interviewing many key people in his life, in the decades since, when other people passed on, they left their papers to libraries. Tapes of recording sessions turned up. And I found a great deal of new, very intimate material that gave more insight into how the dynamic of how a Hitchcock production worked and where Herrmann fit into that. Interestingly, one of the things that makes their partnership so unusual was that Herrmann was invited into that inner circle after just one movie. He was always involved from the very inception of a Hitchcock project.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSteven C. BookSmith\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“Mark A. Vieira”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The Trouble With Harry” is not going to be very many people’s favorite Hitchcock movie, but besides being very enjoyable on its own terms, it set up their tight relationship and teed up a whole series of masterpieces to follow.\n\n\tThis wasn’t just a professional relationship; this was, as my book title says, a friendship between two men. By their second film, Hitchcock is signing notes to Benny and his wife “Love, Hitch.” When he heard the music for their first collaboration, “The Trouble With Harry,” he knew that after 15 years of making movies in America, and after 35 years of working on the film industry, he finally had found the composer who could put into music exactly what he was putting on the screen in images. He chuckled as he listened to the music, he just was so delighted. And although it’s not a film people know these days, it was a black comedy that really introduced audiences to Hitchcock’s sense of macabre comedy. Up to that point, his movies had touches of dark humor in them, but it wasn’t until “The Trouble With Harry,” which preceded his television series just slightly, that Hitchcock really got to show people what his sense of humor was like. And it also has some lovely romantic scenes in it. It isn’t just the story of corpse that won’t stay buried and hidden. It’s also got these two romances between a young couple and an older couple falling in love, and it’s filmed and set in Vermont with these lovely autumnal reds and greens. So there’s a lot of tone switching in the movie, and Benny handled that brilliantly.\n\n\tFor the first time, Herrmann put Hitchcock in the music. You can listen to the score of “The Trouble With Harry” and close your eyes and you see Alfred Hitchcock. Thirteen years later, Benny arranged a suite of music based on that first score, and he called that suite “A Portrait of Hitch.” So, when Hitchcock heard Herrmann’s music for him for the first time, he just knew, “This is it. This is what my movies have needed.”\n\t\n\n\tAnd it was such an instantaneous creative falling in love that Hitchcock didn’t just ask Herrmann to score his next film, “The Man Who Knew Too Much”; he had the screenwriter put Herrmann in the screenplay before they shot the movie. In the screenplay, it says that Bernard Herrmann is the conductor in the Albert Hall sequence, the famous sequence of the attempted assassination. And sure enough, in the movie, you see Doris Day arrive the Albert Hall, and there’s a big poster that has Herrmann’s name on it. He gets a big entrance and they filmed it inside the Albert Hall for five days, and Hitchcock gave Herrmann the best onscreen cameo that any composer for film has ever had. So it just shows how quickly these men connected with each other.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOf course, it’s not an entirely happy story — either the Herrmann/Hitchcock relationship, or Herrmann’s own professional trajectory, although his “solo career,” if we can put it that way, has a nice denouement. But as your first book well established, he fit the tortured artist stereotype in certain regards.\n\n\tHe was a true renaissance man, and that’s why it’s so tragic that the thing that separated him from, say, a renaissance man like Leonard Bernstein was that while Bernstein was charismatic and a very sharp political animal, as you needed to be to succeed in music, film or anything, Herrmann had a personality that had a very volatile side to it. He could be delightful company, he could be a great conversationalist, or he could be a volcano who blew up, and then you couldn’t get to the exit quickly enough if you were the subject of his invective. And unfortunately, as the world around him changed in ways that he didn’t like, and as he was not reaching the goals he had in mind for his life, that volatile side of him came out more often, and Hitchcock saw it more and more often.\n\n\tWe all know how entertaining a story of a great odd couple can be, and in a way, Herrmann and Hitchcock and Herrmann are a great odd couple. Hitchcock was very British and extremely conflict-averse, and he would leave the room if there was even the hint of conflict brewing, whereas Herrmann walked into a room and brought the conflict, quite often. Conflict could be a source of artistic creation for him. It could be positive, or it could just be him railing against things he was unhappy about and driving people away. Unfortunately, if we could give him a magic pill that made him a calm and courteous person every day of his life, he probably could not have written the music for “Psycho” or the romantic turmoil of “Vertigo,” or name any of the Hitchcock scores. It came from his personality. So, what was so great about him artistically is tied into what made him a problematic figure in his life as well.\n\t\n\n\tBut despite that, they had so much in common, and that’s the other thing I really wanted to bring out in the book. If Hitchcock was outwardly placid and in public exhibiting a version of his TV host persona — someone very calm and mordantly comic in his comments and all that — inside, Hitchcock was roiling with anxieties and terrors, which is why he made the movies he did. And if Herrmann was outwardly explosive at times — and if he was kind of a mess in his wardrobe, with cigarette butts going down his shirt— on the inside, he had the soul of a romantic poet. Listen to scores not just for something like “Vertigo,” but outside of Hitchcock, “The Ghost and Mrs. Muir,” and this is some of the most beautiful music of the 20th century.\n\n\tSo what Hitchcock and Herrmann recognized in each other was that, outside of what they showed the public, they had so much in common in terms of their artistic impulses — a dark, romantic vision that they had in common. They had a shared sense that life was tragic but had great beauty to it; that life was filled with tension, and constant tension, but that tension could be the source of movies that were entertaining and music that was wonderfully thrilling to listen to, either in the film or on its own.\n\n\tWhat was their friendship like, in their best days together?\n\n\tHerrmann and his wife Lucy would be invited over to the Hitchcocks’ home and Alma would cook these wonderful meals. And Hitchcock had a tradition that the guests, no matter who they were, would have to do the cleanup with Hitchcock after the meal. So there are these wonderful scenes that Benny would talk about later where … they cleaned dishes and put things away, and they would trade stories about their lives. There’s one that Benny loved to tell where they would talk about what they would do if they hadn’t gone into the professions that they had. And Benny said that it was his dream to run a pub, either in London or a London-style pub somewhere, because Herrmann was a tremendous Anglophile. And Benny asked Hitch what he would’ve done, and according to Benny, Hitch took a napkin and put it on his head and said, very solemnly, “A hanging judge.” So you could just imagine how fun it would be to be with these two, either when they were having meals and just talking together or when they were creating together.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere’s pretty much a three-picture peak with “Vertigo,” “North by Northwest” and “Psycho,” which very few people would dispute are masterpieces, through and through. If people pick one of those as either Herrmann’s or Hitchcock’s best, a lot of people tend to pick “Vertigo.” Do you agree with that?\n\n\tYeah, I’ll say no director-composer team had a better three-movie run than “Vertigo,” “North by Northwest” and “Psycho.” But if “Psycho” is the example of how the music really saved a movie — and I don’t mean that it was bad, but it added the ingredient it needed — and if “North by Northwest” is a perfect combination of humor and suspense, which is something Herrmann didn’t get to do very often, “Vertigo” is the summit of their collaboration, because it’s arguably Hitchcock’s most personal film. The reason people go back to it is about the brilliance of its filmmaking but also its rather disturbing picture of a highly dysfunctional relationship, of romantic obsession. And Herrmann was as obsessively romantic as Hitchcock was, so they really met on this film.\n\n\tWhat I detail in this book that I didn’t get to talk about in the first book was how Hitchcock had such faith in the power of this music was that there is an entire reel in “Vertigo” that has almost no dialogue. Hitchcock directed this film and edited this film in a different way because he knew that Herrmann would be scoring it. And Hitchcock, who started in silent films, makes in effect a silent movie for long stretches of “Vertigo,” with total faith that Herrmann is going to write something compelling enough that we can follow Jimmy Stewart’s character driving around and walking around San Francisco for an entire reel of film and not be bored. And Herrmann just didn’t deliver; he gives you a masterclass in how to make it compelling and beautiful.\n\n\tAnd it was a very difficult score to finally record, because there was a musicians strike. There’s a very colorful story of how the poor associate producer and Hitchcock traveled the world trying to find an orchestra that wouldn’t quit on them when they showed up to record this score. So they spent a lot of money, going the extra mile to have this score recorded as best as it could be. And I think it is the peak in terms of collaboration. For the famous love scene, the 360-camera shot, Benny loved to recall Hitchcock saying to him: “We’ll just have the camera and you.”\n\t\n\n\tIs it fair to say “North by Northwest” created a template in some way for light-hearted action thrillers, and that the score might have done the same?\n\n\tBenny said that “North by Northwest” was basically the template for the Bond film series, and it’s a fact that the makers of the Bond series went to see “North by Northwest” and were very interested in Hitchcock and certainly drew from that film. Benny loved working on “North by Northwest” because it’s written by a friend (Ernest Lehman), it’s directed by a friend and it’s fun. And he lamented the fact that people didn’t ask him to score more comedies. But you think, “Well, because they listened to your music! You take things pretty seriously.”\n\n\tSomeone at MGM evidently suggested that the main titles for “North by Northwest” should have kind of a Gershwin-esque sound, because the movie starts in New York City, Benny said, “Absolutely not.” He instead based his main theme on the rhythm of a Spanish fandango, similar to what Leonard Bernstein would use in the song “America” in “West Side Story.” Benny said he used a Spanish fandango rhythm because the movie wasn’t about New York, it was about the crazy dance about to take place between Cary Grant and the world. And it’s funny how Herrmann could come up with something that’s intellectually clever; that doesn’t matter if it doesn’t work, but just instinctively, it’s right. No one in the general public goes to “North by Northwest” and says, “Oh, wasn’t that clever that he used a Spanish fandango.” No, it’s just that the music’s exciting and it’s menacing, but it’s got a little bit of wit to it.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnything having to do with how the “Psycho” score came to be legendary.\n\n\tIn 1960, when Hitchcock finished the very, very risky-for-the-time “Psycho,” a movie that he personally financed — he was not going to be reimbursed for the production until he turned in the negative to Paramount — many people in his circle had urged him not to make it because of the violence and the sex. They thought it was sleazy. When Hitchcock looked at the rough cut, which was longer than the final film and had no music, he was very disappointed in the movie, and he thought that his friends were right and Paramount was right and he had made a terrible mistake. According to Herrmann, Hitchcock mused that he might cut the film down and put it on television, because he had his television series at the time and some other television projects too. Benny was amazed because he saw the potential of the film at a time that Hitchcock was ready to give up on it. And Herrmann wrote a score that I think is the most extreme example of what music can do: to take what is potentially in a film, but not there yet, and addit to the movie to the degree that it went from something that was listless and slow to something electrifying and transformative for the culture in general. I mean, every serial killer series you see on Netflix, you can all trace that back to “Psycho,” so imagine, for better or worse, what the world would be like if “Psycho” had been cut down to a television program and forgotten. But Herrmann convinced Hitchcock that this film was something fresh and came up with what he later famously called “a black and white sound” for the black and white film. He created a score for an enormous string orchestra — 50 players, only strings — and created that sound so harsh that it’s been called “marrow-scraping.”\n\t\n\n\tAnd Hitchcock went along with that choice for “Psycho,” obviously, as bizarre as it must have seemed at the beginning of the ‘60s.\n\n\tOne story that I was able to get for the new book is a detailed and quite revealing  description of the cast and crew screening. Those are not screenings where people are really engaged in the story. The actors traditionally watch a cast and crew screening and think, “Oh, that wasn’t my best take” or “God, it was hot that day.”  Well, none of the people involved had seen “Psycho” with the score yet, except for the screenwriter, Joseph Stefano, who loved the music. You have Janet Leigh and her husband, Tony Curtis. You have the soon-to-be-head of Universal Studios, Lew Wasserman, one of the most powerful people in Hollywood. And the script supervisor, Marshall Schlom, recalls that basically it turned into an audience screening where, when the murders happened, the people who made the movie jumped six inches in the air. Schlom had never been to a screening where the makers of the film turned into the opening weekend audience… Marshall said that in the dim light of reflection from the screen, he saw Hitchcock’s smile. And he had reason to smile, because it was the smile of a man who was going to make, I think we can conservatively estimate, something like $100 million in today’s money for a movie that he almost put on television. And Bernard Herrmann played a tremendous part in that.\n\n\tAnd then after that is “The Birds,” which had a non-score, really, although Herrmann was involved in making those choices, even without composing music. But after that is when the story starts to go haywire, with “Marnie” not being a success, and the studio telling Hitchcock that Herrmann’s score was too old-fashioned… that they needed someone with more of a pop-score sensibility. And then their relationship completely falls apart on “Torn Curtain,” and it’s curtains for everything about their friendship.\n\n\tThere are so many interesting details to the slow car crash that was the breakup of Hitchcock and Herrmann that I devote two chapters to it in my book. There are elements of personality. There are areas of small grievances and things irritating each other about the other person. But what I found most poignant researching this book was that everyone involved thought they were doing what they were doing for the best of the project.   \n\t\n\n\tThe supreme high point of collaboration on “Psycho” laid the seeds for the disaster that would happen six years later in March of 1966 when Hitchcock went to hear the score for “Torn Curtain.” You couldn’t really hear a film score in those days before it was recorded, if it was written for an orchestra. Hitchcock showed up to the session wanting a miracle for this movie that he knew wasn’t particularly good. He heard that Herrmann had written a heavy, dark, sometimes lugubrious score that Benny thought would convey the sense of the Soviet Union, the Iron Curtain that the heroes are trapped behind. Benny thought Hitchcock would love that. I was able to hear the recording of the session, and you can tell that Benny has no idea what’s coming. He’s in a great mood, so he was absolutely stunned when Hitchcock listened to two cues and fired him on the spot and canceled the session.\n\n\tCan you go into how the success of their collaboration on “Psycho” ironically set up the disaster that happened with “Torn Curtain”?\n\n\tFour or five times, Herrmann was told by Hitchcock or by Hitchcock’s staff that they did not want a score that sounded like what he’d done in the past. And yes, the terminology was a little vague, but Hitchcock made it clear that he did not want a heavy score. He used words like “light.” He used the word “beat.” He wanted something contemporary and energetic. And Benny basically let Hitchcock and everyone else think that he was going to follow those instructions, and he didn’t. He wrote a heavy, militaristic, threatening score — the opposite of the light “beat” score that Hitchcock wanted. He wrote it not to be contrary, but because he thought that Hitchcock was just getting bad advice from others. And he didn’t think that Hitchcock had the right perception of his own film. Benny thought, “I’m going to do what the movie needs, and he’s going to hear it and he’s going to love it. And I’m going to rescue this film as much as a composer can, and he will be thrilled.”\n\n\tAnd the reason he thought that was because that’s what happened on “Psycho,” with such great, transformative results?\n\n\tYes, the reason Benny felt that he could go against Hitchcock’s wishes on “Torn Curtain,” I’m confident, is because Hitchcock said on “Psycho,” “Do whatever you think is best. I only have one instruction. Do not write music for the murders.” And of course, Herrmann ignored that, and he wrote the music for the shower scene. … Herrmann had what was the supreme triumph, I think, of his career in film when he said, “Hitch, I did write music for that scene. May I play it for you?” And he did, and Hitchcock said, “Well, that’s what we’ll use.”\n\t\n\n\tI have a much clearer understanding now of how, when Hitchcock walked in to the “Torn Curtain” scoring session, he was just stunned, and his thought was an understandable “Why have you betrayed me like this? Everything’s gone wrong, and I counted on you, my friend, and you did this to me too.” Benny didn’t do what he was told, and he wasn’t the director of the movie. And this could have been avoided. Benny had the chance to turn it down, and they could have gotten Henry Mancini or John Addison (who ultimately did score the film after Herrmann was removed), because the movie would’ve flopped and then maybe Benny could have come back on the next one. As this book shows, he was at the lowest point of his life at that moment, and I think that he was not able to view a project with the same open-mindedness that he could have if his world had not gotten very darkin his head.\n\n\tIt’s funny that, today, the main reason anyone talks about “Torn Curtain” is to talk about the Hitchcock/Herrmann breakup.\n\n\tIsn’t that ironic, that that’s more interesting than the movie? It’s true. There are few discussions of that movie that don’t quickly turn to Bernard Herrmann. When Universal put the movie out on DVD, they put on every single scene that was recorded with Herrmann’s music before Hitchcock let him go because they knew people were so interested.\n\n\tMost people who’ve heard the “Torn Curtain” music don’t think it’s a great lost score, and yet there was some vindication when Quentin Tarantino used some of the unheard music for one of his films.\n\n\tHitchcock wasn’t wrong in thinking the music needed energy. If you had a generic library and you wanted ominous Bernard Herrmann music, that (unused score) would be fine for that. But the murder cue is terrific. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tYou start the book off with Herrmann recording the score for “Taxi Driver,” on what turned out to be the last day of his life. What was meaningful about starting the book there, before you jump back in time to tell the story of his life with Hitchcock?\n\n\tWell, just as the Hitchcock/Herrmann films have become greater and greater in our culture, people’s awareness of them, “Taxi Driver” is one of the most famous things that Herrmann did, as well as the last thing he did. And for a book where the whole goal was to make you feel as much as possible that you were inside the room with people, I realized that if I started with the final “Taxi Driver” session, I would be starting on the last night of Herrmann’s life, and you can’t get more dramatic than that. And there were younger people in the room that I could still talk with and get their impressions. They had vivid memories of Herrmann on that night that I hadn’t heard before. So I could do an almost forensic account of his last few hours. Martin Scorsese was so excited to be working with this force of nature that was Herrmann, and to him, Herrmann seemed very powerful. But to people in the orchestra, some of whom who had played on “Citizen Kane” 34 years earlier, they saw him as a man who was near death, as he was.\n\t\n\n\tHerrmann was having this extraordinary creative renaissance, and his whole next year was booked with major A-list movies like “Carrie” and others, and yet he just had hours left to live, with his body failing him. And then meanwhile, literally a slight distance away, Hitchcock is at Universal making what will be his last film (“Family Plot”), while his body is failing. Unlike Herrmann, Hitchcock had remained famous, he’s been popular, but his creative abilities were no longer at their fullest. So it’s rather poignant, the fact that Benny won’t live as long, but he’s going out on top. And you have Hitchcock dying more slowly at Universal, which I thought was very poignant.\n\n\tIt’s hard to say what counts as a happy ending for anyone. But it is reassuring to know that Herrmann was getting respect at the end, whatever he might have done to alienate people, even if he doesn’t live to see all the results of it. Hitchcock doesn’t go out on as much of a high, although no one commands more respect to this day.\n\n\tI have enormous compassion for Hitch because he was really frightened as he reached the end of his life. You know, he made all of these movies about death and murder and laughing at it, and part of the reason was because death was his greatest fear, and he was in absolute terror of dying at the end. Whereas with Herrmann, you couldn’t ask for a better night. You’ve got Steven Spielberg, who visited the session, kneeling down before you to tell you how wonderful you are. You’ve got Martin Scorsese thanking you for a great score. You’ve got musicians applauding. You get taken out to dinner, and you think about the major movies you’re going tobe doing for the next year of your life, and you just go to sleep. I’d take that over the long, slow agony that Hitchcock had at the end.\n\n\tBut, yeah, it’s a poignant story. and I hope that when people read the book, they will get a sense of these men not as just icons, but as flesh and blood people who had the same anxieties and yearnings and loves that we have. They just had a particular genius in translating that into art.\n\n\tTheir collaboration wasn’t going to last forever, because of their personalities. I think even if Herrmann had been an easier person to get along with, something would’ve happened, as it did with just about everyone. Hitchcock fell out for a time with Ernest Lehman. He fell out completely with the screenwriter of “Rear Window,” John Michael Hayes. I think perhaps with all really singularcreative people, there is a shelf life — a time limit — of how much they’re going to work with certain other people before it just doesn’t gel anymore. But the miracle of it is that for a decade, from 1955 to 1965 — because my book goes into the 17 scores that Benny wrote for the Hitchcock TV series too — these two men with strong egos were able to collaborate and, for most of those years, absolutely be on the same page.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere is a documentary being made that is a companion piece to the book, right?\n\n\tYes, I’m co-producing it with Diana Friedberg. I’m also doing a documentary on (famed film director and Hollywood blacklist victim) Abraham Polonsky, with Eddie Muller as the primary producer and Claire Lockhart as co-producer.\n\n\tWhat do you think most sets Herrmann apart from other great film scorers?\n\n\tOne thing Benny said that I always quote is, “The composer’s first job is to get inside the drama.” And I would say that Bernard Herrmann was the greatest writer of psychological music in the 20th century. No composer in any medium could make a listener feel a character’s thoughts and emotions more vividly than he did. That’s part of his genius. And it’s what I miss in movie scores today, having music that can help you feel the way you do when you watch “Vertigo” or the way you feel when you watch Janet Leigh’s character in the first 45 minutes of “Psycho.” That identification is intense, and it’s so rare that music has the opportunity to do that now.\n\n\tAn audiobook version of “Hitchcock & Herrmann,” read by Smith, will be released Jan. 6; preorder it through your favorite audio service here.

    "description": "\n\n\tThe day after the world premiere of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” in Los Angeles, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver — who wrote the third film in the multibill",
    "body": "\n\n\tThe day after the world premiere of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” in Los Angeles, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver — who wrote the third film in the multibillion-dollar movie series with director James Cameron — are huddled in a hotel restaurant, nursing large cups of chicken broth.\n\n\t“I’m not a late-night person, and …” Silver says before turning to her husband. “What time did we get home last night? At 1?”\n\n\t“It was close to one o’clock, yeah,” Jaffa says. “And by the way, we’re usually sleeping at 10.”\n\n\tSilver playfully bats at Jaffa’s arm. “Don’t make us seem like oldies!”\n\n\n\tThe night before, Jaffa and Silver also sat side by side in the Dolby Theatre, nudging each other to look around and gauge the reactions of their fellow moviegoers as they returned to the far-flung moon of Pandora. They’d seen a cut of the film a few weeks prior, so they steeled themselves for the waves of emotion to come.\n\n\t“If I had not, I’d still be sitting in the Dolby weeping,” Jaffa says.\n\n\n\tIn 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,” the family of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) suffered a tragic loss: Their eldest son, Neteyam (Jamie Flatters), was killed in battle. “Fire and Ash” follows the Sully clan as they try to pick up the pieces.\n\n\n\t“Grief is a great teacher. It teaches us how fragile life and connections are. The movie does a good job of dramatizing that,” Silver says. “The Na’vi are fantastical creatures, but they really do experience human emotions, and all humans struggle with mortality.”\n\t\n\n\tThe emotional plot sees Jake and Neytiri figuring out how to cope while their younger son, Lo’ak (Britain Dalton), who narrates the story, grapples with survivor’s guilt. For all the wrenching moments, Jaffa and Silver insist that the arc is more hopeful than sorrowful.\n\n\t“The great takeaway — and we’re living proof of it — is, as Lo’ak says in the voice-over, ‘The light always returns,’” Jaffa says.\n\n\tIt’s been a decade since Silver and Jaffa wrote that line, but they understand it more deeply today, as their son, Joe Jaffa, died last summer. He was 33.\n\n\t“Joe was a bright light in the world. In his short time on the earth, he really affected a lot of people,” Silver says. “No matter what he went through — and he had health issues his whole life — he brought joy into the world.”\n\n\tJaffa chimes in: “He wanted to tell people that he didn’t lose his battle to cancer, that he fought it to a draw and took it down with him.”\n\t\n\n\tThen, in January, the couple and their daughter, Franki, lost their home when wildfire engulfed their Pacific Palisades neighborhood. “To be very candid, the holiday season has been difficult, not just without our son but without the comforts of our home,” Jaffa says.\n\n\tIt’s another element echoed in “Fire and Ash,” which introduces a Na’vi clan whose home was destroyed in a volcanic eruption, and something the screenwriters couldn’t have fathomed when they landed the “Avatar” gig more than a decade ago.\n\n\tMarried since 1989 and writing partners since 1992, Jaffa and Silver have been blockbuster cinema mainstays since their scripts for 2011’s “Rise of the Planet of the Apes” and 2015’s “Jurassic World” relaunched each franchise. But their work on “Fire and Ash” and “The Way of Water” was unlike anything they (or any screenwriters, for that matter) had done before. In 2013, Cameron hired them, as well as Josh Friedman and Shane Salerno, to help him expand the story of 2009’s “Avatar” into a proper sci-fi saga. They spent six months in a writers’ room hashing out what was planned to be three new films about the Sully family.\n\n\tJaffa and Silver speak of that period with a kind of wide-eyed awe. “Jim created a safe space for us to throw out stupid ideas, to try things out,” Silver says. “He invites us — the actors, the art department, everybody — to dream as big as they can and let him choose what he likes and figure out how to make it.”\n\n\tBut as Jaffa and Silver set about writing “Avatar 2” based on the extensive outline they’d all crafted together, their script began to expand well beyond the length of even a Cameron-sized movie. So they sent what they’d written to Cameron and asked him, “Should we start editing?”\n\n\t“He just wrote back, ‘Take the hill,’” Jaffa recalls. “Which basically meant, keep going.”\n\n\tAdds Silver: “And he knew what material was ahead of us. It’s not like we were making that material as we went.”\n\n\tBy the time they finished the full script in 2015, they estimate it approached 350 pages. “Insanely long,” Silver says with a knowing smile. “We never would write that long, but we had a mandate.” Ultimately, Cameron decided he wanted to include as much material as possible, so he split their mega-script into two movies, “The Way of Water” and “Fire and Ash.” \n\n\tThat led to some substantial creative changes: What Silver says “we used to call ‘the skirmish’” halfway through the story became the climactic battle at the end of “The Way of Water,” and Cameron gave that film the ending that Jaffa and Silver had written for “Fire and Ash.” But it also meant that Jaffa and Silver had the space to explore all the nuances of the emotional arc in service of the audience.\n\t\n\n\t“People go to the movies for catharsis. And sci-fi and fantasy provide a huge opportunity to hold a mirror up to the human condition, and you can experience these difficult emotions at a safe distance,” Silver says. “The lights come up at the end of the movie. You throw away your popcorn and your soda; you’ve had a good cry. People need that.”\n\n\tBut she insists that “Fire and Ash” isn’t a melancholy experience.\n\n\t“It’s about joy and triumph and connection,” Silver says. “That’s the Sully way. And that’s also the Jaffa way.”\n",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          Lizzo's powerhouse attorney, Marty Singer, and his partner, Melissa Y. Glass, tell TMZ the fat-shaming claims were a major part of the sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Arianna Davis, Noelle Rodriguez, and Crystal Williams, but they insist it always lacked merit.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          According to Lizzo's attorneys, the allegations were refuted by 18 witnesses in sworn declarations submitted to the court.\n      \n    \n          They say the Superior Court judge concluded Davis was fired because she made \"an unauthorized recording of Lizzo in a dancer meeting and sent it to Williams, who was no longer working on The Special Tour\" ... and now the dancers dropped their appeal of the dismissal of the fat-shaming claims.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          The fat-shaming claims are just one of many that they brought against the artist.\n      \n    \n          You'll recall ... back in 2023, Arianna, Noelle and Crystal claimed Lizzo subjected them to nude entertainment shows in Amsterdam and Paris on tour, which they said they were clearly uncomfortable with.\n      \n    \n          In the docs, the women say Lizzo pressured dancers to interact with sex performers at Bananenbar in Amsterdam, where patrons are known to eat bananas out of the performers' vaginas. Lizzo denies the claims.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          While the more serious claims are still being disputed in court, Lizzo's team says they remain \"confident she will prevail in the case.\"\n      \n    \n          But the dancers' attorney, Ronald Zambrano, told TMZ, \"We are maintaining that Judge Epstein was correct in his ruling denying Lizzo's special motion to strike the vast majority of claims they attacked, including false imprisonment and harassment. Of the couple of claims Judge Epstein did dismiss, the plaintiffs have taken a considered approach to leave that be. One would hope to see the same level of intellectual honesty and neutral assessment from the defendants, but that hasn’t been the case thus far and it’s disappointing.\"\n      \n      ",

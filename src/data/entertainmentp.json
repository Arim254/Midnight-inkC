    "body": "\n\tA sing-along — but make it super short.\n\n\tIn a new wrinkle in the microdrama trend, Hannah Stocking, a hugely popular digital creator and comedian with more than 72 million followers, is starring in “Playback.” The series hails from digital studio Second Rodeo, which is touting “Playback” as the first-ever musical produced specifically for vertical video. The project also stars Amber Laird (“Day Trip,” “Ratched”) and Sophie Sumner (winner of “America’s Next Top Model” Cycle 18), alongside Royce Lundquist (“Callsign Legacy,” “Queen of the Court”) and  Sarah Sampino (“I Became Mrs Greyson by Bragging”).\n\t\n\n\tThe series recently wrapped production and will premiere on Holywater’s My Drama microdrama streaming app in early 2026. This fall, Fox Entertainment announced an investment in Holywater, along with a production pact.\n\n\n\tThe musical series follows Maddie Bryce (played by Amber Laird), a struggling songwriter who secretly creates an AI version of herself that becomes a global pop sensation. As fame overtakes her digital double, Maddie must navigate the pressures of her dual life while reclaiming her voice and identity in a climactic musical finale about authenticity and courage, per Second Rodeo.\n\n\t“Microdramas represent the next evolution in short-form content, and creators are seeing the value and opportunity to reach new audiences in this format,” said Scott Brown, founder and CEO of Second Rodeo. “By combining narrative depth with mobile-first vertical storytelling, we’re pushing the boundaries of what a microdrama can be.”\n\n\t“Playback” is co-produced by Second Rodeo, 3Pas Studios and Mexico City-based Visceral Productions. The series is led by Second Rodeo executive producers Scott Brown, who also directed the series, and Stacy Howard, alongside Javier Williams and Pablo Calasso. Co-executive producers include Brandon Carroll, Andrew Barcello and Keith Knee. Serving as producers are Caroline Stella, Carmina Carballal and Juan Pablo Caussin. Original songs for the series are written by songwriter Keeley Bumford, known professionally as Dresage.\n\t\n\n\t“Playback” follows the release of Second Rodeo’s romantic thriller “The Diamond Rose,” which launched on Holywater’s My Drama in summer 2025. “Diamond Rose” became one of the platform’s most popular titles, achieving 20 million views within the first 24 hours, and earning awards at the International Short Drama Awards and LA Vertical Drama Market.\n\n\tBogdan Nesvit and Anatolii Kasianov, co-founders and co-CEOs of Ukraine-based Holywater, said their vision is to vertical series into “a cinematic experience.”\n\n\t“Vertical series are the next frontier, and ‘Playback’ is a perfect example of the innovation this format allows,” the duo said. “Having worked with Scott before, we know how exceptional he is at creating series that resonate with millions of viewers around the world. We’re excited to see him and the incredible cast of ‘Playback’ bring this must-see story to life.”\n\n\tWatch the teaser trailer for “Playback,” featuring a cover of David Bowie’s “Life on Mars” performed by Ting Min:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJodie Foster still thinks about Clarice Starling.\n\n\tAfter winning her second Oscar for playing the dogged FBI agent who must rely on Anthony Hopkins’ insinuating cannibal in 1991’s “The Silence of the Lambs,” she ceded the role of Clarice to Julianne Moore for “Hannibal,” the 2001 sequel. \n\n\t“It was easy,” Foster recalls of the decision not to join the film. “We waited years for that novel that Thomas Harris said he was writing, that he probably wrote in eight weeks.” Director Jonathan Demme had wanted to base any future films in the Hannibal Lecter universe on Harris’ work. But the book was substantially more grotesque than “The Silence of the Lambs,” and took both Hannibal and Clarice in implausible directions. (Hannibal feeds Clarice a victim’s brain, and the novel ends with the pair as romantic partners.)\n\t\n\n\t“We waited,” she goes on. “Jonathan said no, because he did not appreciate the book. And luckily, I was doing something else, so I was able to say, ‘Ah! No. I’m shooting something else.’” She grins.\n\n\tBut she can’t help pondering Clarice today, openly musing about directions the character might go. “Let’s just say she stayed in the FBI,” Foster says. “She’s spent 40 years in the FBI: What has she seen, and what has that culture taught her, and what is the culture now?”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFoster and Starling are inextricably linked in the cultural imagination. The actress wasn’t the first choice for the role — Michelle Pfeiffer, who’d just worked with Demme on “Married to the Mob,” turned it down due to discomfort with the subject matter. But the character’s clenched jaw and coiled intellect have, until Foster’s late-period revival, shown us what Foster has seemed to do best. And, like Clarice in the FBI, Foster has had to fight to keep the environment in which she grew up from changing her into someone she didn’t recognize. Famous since childhood, Foster has struggled mightily to resist giving some essential part of herself away, to the industry, to fans or to the press.\n\t\n\n\tShe wonders whether her best-known character would have done the same — stayed essentially herself despite the pressure to transform: “Would she have adopted the FBI, judgy, tough on crime, or would she have grown out of it and become something else? Or would she be the person who changed the FBI and said, We’re not going to do it the old way?\n\n\t“Who would Clarice be?” Foster asks. “At 63, who would she be?”\n\n\n\tIt’s an intriguing question. At 63 herself, Foster intrigues as well. Speaking to her, as I do in November in Los Angeles, is a disarming experience. You’re talking to a star who had two best actress Oscars before 30 (the first was for 1988’s “The Accused”) — but she also trundles into the interview with a giant paper bag from Joan’s on Third and a similarly massive desk calendar tucked under her arm, prompt and utilitarian and refusing to force anyone else to carry her detritus. \n\n\tLater, when we part ways, Foster will ask me to mention that she was severely overcaffeinated during our conversation, and moments of fitful hops between subjects begin to make sense. Take her description of her decision to quit acting after turning 50 — prompted by her peremptory tone when speaking to an unnamed person on set. \n\n\t“I asked someone for a cappuccino?” she recalls with a tone of barely restrained horror. “I did what? I thought I knew what I was talking about and ranted on for 45 minutes? I didn’t send that person a condolence letter when their mom died? I wasn’t at their wedding? I disappeared for four months and expected everybody to be my friend when I came back?” \n\n\tI know what she means, sort of. Foster, who had been truly famous since her breakout role at age 12 in 1976’s “Taxi Driver,” feared she was becoming a creature of Hollywood — in other words, an asshole. But there are, of course, people on set whose job is to make sure Ms. Foster has an espresso drink made to her specifications. And is that really such an offense, on par with skipping a wedding? In the flow of Foster’s charisma, though, it’s hard to get a foothold — caught up in the story, I find myself horrified at her temerity, and relieved she’s not asking anyone for cappuccinos anymore.\n\n\tAudiences felt the same way — moved, if befuddled — during her 2013 Golden Globes speech. After Robert Downey Jr. presented her with the Cecil B. DeMille Award, she delivered an address that many took as Foster coming out of the closet. When I bring it up, she blurts out, “They were confused!” (Thinking back on our interview, perhaps there were signs of this self-confessed overcaffeination.) \n\n\tWell, can one blame them for not quite getting Foster’s meaning? In her speech, Foster thanked her “heroic co-parent” and “ex-partner in love but righteous soul sister in life,” Cydney Bernard. (Foster and Bernard’s two sons, Charlie and Kit, are now in their 20s.) This acknowledgment, after decades of silence on the subject of her sexuality, was seismic. \n\t\n\n\tBut she doesn’t see it that way. Foster had written a speech that was artful and elusive. Her mention of Bernard was in a weaving narrative of her growing up in the industry, her fears that the pressure for her to talk about her personal life were tied to a larger cultural shift and her increasing disaffection with Hollywood. There was a lot going on. Even reflecting on it, she refuses to be pinned down. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It was really important that it be so literary,” Foster says, “because I knew that it would be chopped up, misinterpreted.” She wanted it as a document, so that “20 years from now, my kids will go back” and see where she was at 50. In the midst of coming-out-or-not-coming-out, Foster also spoke at length about privacy — how it was vanishing, and how much she’d miss it when it was gone. An audience of her peers, many of whom had long since begun sharing their lives on Instagram, sat rapt in the Beverly Hilton ballroom that January night. \n\n\tPerhaps more consequentially, though, Foster used the speech to announce that she was thinking about walking away from large-scale moviemaking. (Few people understood this part either.) “From now on,” she declared, “I may be holding a different talking stick. And maybe it won’t be as sparkly. Maybe it won’t open on 3,000 screens.”\n\n\tAnd then she followed through. Foster picked up TV directing gigs on “Orange Is the New Black,” “House of Cards” and “Black Mirror,” and helmed the 2016 movie “Money Monster.” She acted in only two movies in 10 years, both little seen: “Hotel Artemis” and “The Mauritanian.” She returned to major roles in 2023’s “Nyad” and on HBO’s  “True Detective: Night Country” early the next year. She received an Oscar nomination and an Emmy in 2024. Foster was an anonymous TV director no more: She was back on the promotional and campaign trail.\n\n\tIn Foster’s time away from the limelight, Hollywood missed her particular actorly touch with flintiness or with a hard edge — showing the delicacy that lies under a defense mechanism. Audiences may have also missed her remove: The A-listers of her generation have embraced social media even more assiduously than millennials or Gen Z. Watching Foster’s peers do the “That’s Not My Name” challenge on Instagram, one yearned for a star who knew how to keep something in reserve — even if, at times, Foster’s longing to keep herself in hiding could frustrate fans and journalists alike. \n\t\n\n\tNow, in “A Private Life,” which opens Jan. 16 after a Cannes premiere last year and an awards qualifying run, she plays Lilian Steiner, an American psychiatrist living in Paris who is having a breakdown over the death of a patient and sets out to solve what really happened, if she can hold it together long enough to crack the case. It’s a fittingly titled film for a star who’s determined to do Hollywood her own way — to overcaffeinate, but on cappuccino she procures for herself.\n\n\t“I think I’m doing the best work of my life,” she says. “And the dirty little secret is that I’ve never worked less in terms of my energy output. I just do what I think, and then I drink a coffee.” \n\n\tNo kidding.\n\n\tIt was Clarice who showed Foster the value of doing things one’s own way. At the start of “The Silence of the Lambs,” she’s an apple polisher, determined to rise through the FBI ranks; Foster could relate. “I’m a good girl, not a rebel,” she says. “I got good grades. Being raised in the 1960s — you know your place, and then you challenge within the system and make changes within the system.” But to stop a serial killer, Clarice must confront her own inner darkness. \n\n\t“She has to become the tragic prince who starts out as a good boy and learns that his worst failing is actually his greatest strength,” Foster says. “This is usually a male character. Why should that only be reserved for men?” (It’s apt, perhaps, that an actress who got rejected from an audition to play Cindy on “The Brady Bunch” for not being girly enough got to play the male archetype. “You knew Peppermint Patty, but other than that, you never saw a tomboy,” she says.)\n\n\t“The moment she becomes pure instinct instead of Yes, sir; no, ma’am,” Foster says, “that was life-changing.”\n\t\n\n\tFoster had refused to back down in her pursuit of the role, despite the specter of peak-of-fame Pfeiffer; she’d been the “consolation prize,” as she puts it, for “The Accused” too. And her mother, who’d managed Foster’s career since childhood, didn’t want her to take the part of Clarice even if she got it.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“She said, ‘Why do you want to be second fiddle? He’s got a great part. Your part … there’s nothing showy or flashy.” \n\n\tFoster kept pushing, auditioning in a style the producers wanted even as she knew she’d play the part a different way. Her mother was unconvinced. Foster says, “I was trusting a creative instinct, and she was giving me the Hollywood wisdom. I want to challenge Hollywood wisdom. She was guided by fear and convention. It was really clarifying, at 27, to say, I am not going to listen to your fears.”\n\n\tThere was tension between Foster and her mother over the decision. This was a somewhat novel situation: Evelyn “Brandy” Foster, a single mother who also managed the career of her son, Buddy Foster, had always told Jodie she could accomplish anything. “She was infuriating in some ways — and then, ‘You’re a Picasso! You want to sing? Be a singer! Go, go, go. You can do it all.’ And then handicapping in other ways, which is part of the female problem.” After “The Silence of the Lambs” became a smash, Brandy worried that Jodie thought less of her over the conversation. “I was like, Mom, no, this is a dialogue. And if you hadn’t pushed back, maybe I wouldn’t have cared so much.”\n\n\n\tFoster’s mother looms large in stories about her early career. When she started “Taxi Driver,” for instance, Foster wasn’t yet taking acting seriously. Her mother had predicted that her career would be over when she was 16, so this was all for fun. Brandy died at 90 in 2019; she had pushed Jodie toward Scorsese because mother and daughter had seen “Mean Streets” together five times. \n\n\tGranted, Foster had played a small role in Scorsese’s “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” but it had been nothing like this. “Robert De Niro kind of took me under his wing,” she recalls. The actor began improvising with her: “I suddenly realized: The dissatisfaction that I had with acting, thinking this is not a job that’s going to satisfy me for life, was because I didn’t bring enough to the table. I hadn’t done the work of creating a character. There was this infinite amount of challenge and love and connection that I just didn’t know.” She rushed back from improvising with De Niro to her Manhattan hotel to tell her mother what she’d learned.\n\n\tImpressing her mom, for Foster, was paramount. “I loved her, and she was an amazing manager and a brilliant woman,” she says. “But I was a vicarious instrument. She was a pre-feminist woman who would have loved to have been taken seriously, to have been doing important things that were not about her looks.” The concept of a “momager” comes with some heavy baggage, but while Brandy was pushing Jodie forward, she was at least pushing her toward art. “The vicarious path that she wanted for me was really amazing,” she says. “She was like, you will be respected. You will not do stuff for money. You will not be objectified.”\n\n\t“She wanted so much more than her lot in life,” Foster says now. That included a desire to travel. Foster recalls her asking: “What if you go to France and become a French actor, and then you can work with the Cahiers du Cinéma people?” \n\t\n\n\n\tWith “A Private Life,” Foster’s fulfilling that desire a bit later on. While it’s not the first time she’s acted in French, it’s the most substantial role in the language that she’s ever played, and one with a director who’s working totally outside the Hollywood system. Parisian director Rebecca Zlotowski had not expected Foster to sign on, even though she’d written the role for her. \n\n\t“I’m still figuring out why she said yes,” says Zlotowski. “One person told me French directors allowed her to drink, smoke, curse. So it’s a kind of safe space where you can escape from your celebrity.”\n\n\tLilian does do all that — smoke, drink, curse and escape whatever image comes pre-attached to the woman playing her. In the past, the archetypal Jodie Foster role has been one with a furrowed brow and intense, plainspoken directness. As a stubborn but loving swim coach in “Nyad,” a troubled Alaskan cop in “True Detective” and now a freewheeling shrink in disarray in “A Private Life,” Foster has been messily human, strikingly relaxed.\n\n\t“She’s not only a legendary actor,” Zlotowski says, “but she’s very picky with her roles. Every role creates a sub-sentence. At the end of her filmography, a secret sentence will be delivered.”\n\n\tSubverting the movie-star image is one thing, but the secret sentence was a little more personal for Foster too. Late in her life, Brandy Foster, the mother who’d encouraged Jodie to learn French so that she could act with French New Wave directors, moved to Paris.\n\n\t“Walking those streets that my mom took me down,” she says, “I was reliving this new identity my mom got. She lived in Paris for 10 years without speaking a word of French. And she was the person there that she always wanted to be.” It was a fantasy life — but it was, for a woman whose life had been lived primarily through her precocious daughter, finally her own. “I feel like,” Foster says, “I was channeling my mom.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBrandy was suffering from dementia when her daughter delivered her Golden Globes speech announcing her step back from the spotlight. For Foster, who was realizing she needed a break, it was a precarious moment. \n\n\t“There were a lot of years where I just wasn’t a good friend, and I didn’t show up for people, and I was so busy protecting myself,” she says. As she approached and then turned 50, Foster wasn’t sure what the career she’d fought so hard for was even supposed to look like. “That awkward moment between 50 and 60 is just crazy — maybe it is for men too,” she says. “You’re like, wait, who am I? And am I supposed to be like I used to be, except kind of worse?” \n\t\n\n\tSomething shifted in her time away. While in 2013 the mere fact of her mentioning Bernard kicked off a news cycle, at the socially distanced 2021 Globes ceremony, Foster picked up best supporting actress for the film “The Mauritanian,” and accepted the prize from her couch, seated next to her wife, photographer Alexandra Hedison, and their dog. There are now certain things that Foster is willing to let go. Other issues broached in her DeMille speech still remain fresh. She’s angry to see that what she most feared about the loss of privacy came true. “Did we sign a document that said you can scan my face everywhere in the world and then put me on someone else’s body?” she asks, her voice rising. “Did we say yes to fucking trolls invading our life and bullying our children?”\n\n\tFoster’s approach to her public life had been to put it all on the screen. “I hope you actually read it, as opposed to just seeing it,” she says of her speech late in our conversation. When I do, I’m struck by a line about her childhood. “I have given everything up there,” she says, referring to the movie screen, “from the time that I was 3 years old. That’s reality show enough, don’t you think?”\n\n\tShe insists that her refusal to perform celebrity was a necessary choice: “I had to do it my way. You like me as someone who has my dignity. You can’t strip it away from me and then have me remain the me that I am.” This extends to her longtime silence around her home life, tentatively broken in 2013. For years, members of the queer community criticized Foster for not being out publicly, particularly during the AIDS crisis as activist groups fought for visibility. The plot of “The Silence of the Lambs” — with its trans-coded serial killer — exacerbated their frustration. \n\n\t“Thank God there were the wonderful pioneers that were out there changing the world,” Foster says. “That’s true of the Civil Rights Movement, and yet you have Denzel Washington, who just made movies. Are we mad at him? Does everyone have to?”\n\n\tBut as her bristling at the question even now makes clear, there’s dignity, and then there are … trust issues. Foster compares her mindset to the plot of the 2011 film “The Beaver,” which she directed and in which she appears. In the film, Mel Gibson uses a beaver hand puppet to communicate emotions that he as an adult man cannot voice. “The whole story of ‘The Beaver,’ she says, “is, we put on the survival tools that helped us, when we were 5 and 6, survive and not kill ourselves. And then, as you get older, you’re like, These survival tools are killing me. The 40s to 60s is the painful process of going, This is not helping me. How can I stop this? How can I stop distrusting everyone?”\n\t\n\n\tFoster always, at least, trusted her creative collaborators. And she fears that the elements of influencer culture that she despises will chip that away. What she calls “the selfie generation,” is, in her view, too focused on bolstering its image at the expense of the art: “They’re so self-conscious. It’s going to take an ice pick to get them to be actors.” Kristen Stewart, Foster’s on-screen daughter in “Panic Room,” is an exception: “She is brave. She had parents that were brave. And she was given the keys to bravery. I didn’t know that I would ever have them. I thought my role was to make other people happy, and to eat shit. I was the right person to put in rubber boots at 20 degrees below zero, because I was never going to complain.”\n\n\tAs a child, Foster didn’t complain because of an esprit de corps. It wouldn’t help the project to whine. “You can commend her for being such an amazing team player,” “Panic Room” directer David Fincher tells me, “but my feeling at the time was that she’d been this way since she was in middle school. She’s been No. 1 on the call sheet and been No. 11 on the call sheet. She knows it all, and she remembers it all.”\n\n\tNow, though, she’s just over the drama. On one notably cold rubber-boot-clad set — that of “True Detective: Night Country,” which shot nights in the Iceland winter — Foster was trying to engage a young co-star in conversation. The actor, Finn Bennett, in his mid-20s, was thrown off during an outdoor night shoot in subzero temperatures: There was an issue with the lighting. Meanwhile, Foster was asking him if he’d ever seen a favorite movie of hers, the 2004 political satire “Team America: World Police.” \n\n\t“I was like, ‘Dude, it’s fine. It does not matter.’ If you give me the wrong word, I’m going to listen and respond with your wrong word. It’s the worrying that kills everyone — people spend 45 years of their lives trying to distract from worrying.”\n\t\n\n\n\tFoster can feel like a figure out of step with the expectations and interests of contemporary stardom: Many of her peers, for instance, go on “Watch What Happens Live” to tell Andy Cohen who’s their favorite Real Housewife. But during our cover shoot, when our video producer mentions to Foster that she will shortly be covering BravoCon, a gathering of reality-TV celebrities, Foster suggests that she take the opportunity to interview Foster’s Yale mentor Henry Louis Gates Jr. there. His PBS genealogy series “Finding Your Roots” is a reality show, after all. Back in 2013, she’d mentioned the “Toddlers & Tiaras” star Honey Boo Boo in her Golden Globes speech, as an example of culture’s coarsening; in our conversation, she brings her up again, having perhaps learned no new reality-star names in the intervening 13 years.\n\n\tShe’s interested in mentorship, though, and was as early as “Panic Room”: Fincher couldn’t physically fit into the space where Foster’s and Stewart’s characters were hiding, and Foster would guide Stewart toward giving the performance the famously exacting director wanted. “She was so good at being able to take stuff that I was used to talking to adults about,” Fincher says, “and making it bite-sized for a child.” Now, though, Foster’s not sure what to say: “What do I have to teach a new generation?” she asks. “Except that meditation is good, and knowing how to relax and drink coffee and listen to music and be able to have a conversation about other things.”\n\n\tFoster’s later-career resurgence has been defined by a step away from worrying. And notably, it’s been centered on two films and a TV show either directed or co-directed by women. After the underperformance of the George Clooney-led thriller “Money Monster,”  Foster swore off studio filmmaking. “It was amazing having all the money I needed,” she says, “but the mandate of a mainstream movie opening up, the idea of quadrants, the ‘Let’s sell the movie for something it isn’t so that more people come and then they’ll be disappointed’ … Yeah, I don’t ever want to do that again.”\n\n\tWorking with male directors almost exclusively earlier in her career, she says, “my relationship is kind of simple. You tell me; you want it; I do it.” She notes with a gleam in her eye that while Fincher often requires many takes of his actors, that was not the case on “Panic Room,” where she calibrated her performance precisely to his specifications: “I know what you need here,” she recalls saying. “Let me give it to you.”\n\n\tWorking with women is both “really amazing” and novel for Foster. “It is much more complex,” she says. “I get more irritated. There’s a thing we have to figure out. With women, these boundaries are fuzzy.” Foster is now, for example, close friends with Issa López, her “True Detective” showrunner, but she didn’t want a friendship during the shoot; it would have distracted from the work.\n\n\tAnd boarding “A Private Life,” Foster wanted to be clear that it would not be what she calls a “behavior movie” — more about small social incidents than a defined character arc. “She cannot do a totally unresolved part,” Zlotowski says. “This is something that she may like in European films, but that she would never delve into.”\n\t\n\n\t“I look for: How can I serve a story?” Foster says. “What can I bring to the table to get from A to D?” In moments when she and Zlotowski disagreed, Foster says, she thought to herself, “OK, that’s fine. It’s your movie. I’m just going to hang on to mine.” \n\n\tZlotowski says the arc of Foster’s “A Private Life” character goes “from a very bad therapist in the beginning to a slightly better therapist at the end.” There’s the smallest of breakthroughs. That’s enough for Foster, who doesn’t need the character to be a Clarice-style good guy in order to find her compelling: “I’m not interested in repeating the same things I did that are very iconic central figures. I did that, and it’s great. It’s so much fun to be older and have a more nuanced route to things. I don’t have to hold the movie’s moral weight on my shoulders.” \n\n\tShe returns to this just as I’m about to turn off my recorder, so that she can tell me she’s overcaffeinated and offer me a ride back to my hotel. (It turns out I’m staying in the other direction — she’d have to drive west, and now that they’re not working together, she has plans to get dinner tonight at République with López.) I mention that the roles she’s taken since returning sit off the center of the frame, far from the kind of moral exemplar Clarice represented.\n\n\tShe agrees. “When I was young,” she says. “I wanted to be the winner. I wanted to be the hero that gets the gold in the end and learns the big lesson, and everything’s about them. Now, I want to be the person that loses.”\n\n\tAfter all, you can lose things and the story isn’t over. Foster lost her interest in acting, and found it again; she lost whatever it was that kept her from ordering coffee like an asshole, and then she came back to herself. “The movies I make,” she says, “will be about this big life that I have, not about references from 365 days a year in a reality show.” She tells me a story about how her family is renting an Airbnb to spend Christmas together, and the boys are worried they won’t get enough time with her, and she’s as animated by this prosaic story as she is recalling her audition for Jonathan Demme. \n\n\t“They call me with these heartfelt difficulties or insecurities,” she goes on. “I got to be with my mom for the 15 years of dementia, and when she died, I was there. That’s the stuff that I’m really proud of.” She exhales. “Oh, life!” This last word she says as if she’s just rediscovering a concept from her childhood, one that she’d left in a pocket somewhere and is delighted to find once more. “I was present for life.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tStyling: Samantha McMillen/The Wall Group; Makeup and hair: Brett Freedman/Celestine; Look 1 (Cover / Jean): Shirt and jeans: Levi’s; Loafer: Thom Browne; Look 2 (Suede Jacket): Jacket: St. John; Top: Argent; Jean: APC; Loafer: Gucci; Look 3 (Jumpsuit): Jumpsuit: Paige Denim; Look 4 (Trench Coat): Coat: TWP; Shirt: Buck Mason; Jeans: Celine: Belt: Celine; Shoe: Doucal’s\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tFox is leaning into the creator economy, launching a digital division to court creators and develop next-generation content for multiple platforms.\n\n\tFox Creator Studios will launch with an initial focus on food-centric personalities, with plans to expand to other verticals and niches. To whip up a batch of fresh ideas, the unit has cut development deals with such foodie stars as Rosanna Pansino, Jolly, Sorted Food, Little Remy Food and Food Theorists. \n\t\n\n\tCulinary superstar Gordon Ramsay, who has been a staple of the Fox network for more than 20 years, has also made a deal with Fox Creator Studios to leverage the value of his 115 million social media followers around the world. Studio Ramsay Global, the production venture he set up with Fox in 2021, will also be involved in nurturing foodie talent and developing content.\n\n\n\tThe goal is to marry Fox’s production and distribution capabilities with the buzz, fandom and the immediacy that top creators have with their audiences. Fox is pitching these deals to creators as a means of “diversifying revenue streams, reducing algorithm dependency and tapping into new, meaningful business opportunities.” It’s another sign that the social media realm is increasingly exerting influence on traditional media platforms.\n\n\t“Creators are today’s production companies, storytellers and superstars,” said Rob Wade, CEO of Fox Entertainment. “They command massive audiences, build genuine fan communities in real time and redefine what global hits look like. At Fox Creator Studios, we’re backing the next generation of talent by investing in creators, growing their brands and helping them develop new IP, while expanding their reach on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok and every platform worldwide, across every genre, and together building long-term cultural operating systems.”\n\t\n\n\tPer Fox, Pansino is “a beloved baker whose high-energy, creative culinary content brings joy to nearly 20 million home kitchens, with billions of views that span baking, challenges and approachable recipes.”\n\n\tJolly is the British duo of Josh Carrott and Ollie Kendal, “whose joyful, cross-cultural exploration of global flavors has built a community of nearly 5 million fans worldwide.”\n\n\tSorted Food is “a collective of lifelong friends whose collaborative, challenge-driven approach to cooking has earned nearly 3 million subscribers and inspired a global audience through accessible recipes, food travel, and inventive storytelling.”\n\n\tFood Theorists is “a curiosity-driven channel that applies investigative, myth-busting storytelling to food culture and trends, blending science, history, and experimentation that resonates with their 5.5 million subscribers worldwide.”\n\n\tLittle Remy Food is “a viral food creator turning snack culture and trendy recipes into crave-worthy content with playful, fast-paced shorts. Little Remy’s audience has grown to 3.4 million subscribers, attracting a highly engaged, youthful foodie audience.”\n\n\t(PIctured: Rosanna Pansino)\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Paparazzi King,” a docuseries about Italian media personality Fabrizio Corona — who is known for capturing celebrities in compromising moments — is set to drop globally on Netflix Jan. 9. The news comes as the prominent paparazzo is making headlines by leveling accusations of sexual misconduct against a local host of reality show “Big Brother.”\n\n\tCorona, who has been involved in many of Italy’s most sordid scandals over the past two decades, alleged on his YouTube show “Falsissimo” in December that “Big Brother” host Alfonso Signorini “carried out a system of sexual favors” in exchange for several contestants’ participation on “Big Brother.” Signorini – who has vehemently denied Corona’s accusation – reacted by suing Corona for “revenge porn” after the paparazzo showed “Falsissimo” viewers what he claimed were private text messages and images involving Signorini and a former “Big Brother” contestant.\n\t\n\n\tCorona’s accusations subsequently led to former “Big Brother” contestant Antonio Medugno taking legal action against Signorini which, in turn, has prompted Italian prosecutors in Milan to open an investigation against the “Big Brother” host for alleged sexual violence and extortion. In essence, the Milan court is now investigating separate charges reciprocally leveled against Corona and Signorini, who both claim they are innocent.\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, “Big Brother” Italy broadcaster Mediaset announced on Dec. 30 that Signorini has voluntarily “suspended himself” from his role at the network while the alleged sexual abuse case is pending. Mediaset is reportedly seeking another host for the upcoming edition of “Celebrity Big Brother” Italy in March.\n\t\n\n\tEndemol Shine, the Banijay-owned company which retains the “Big Brother” format, said in a statement on Dec. 26 that they had “initiated the required internal audits to ensure compliance with the code of ethics and the procedures governing the selection of contestants for the program.” The company also noted they would “take any action against anyone who may have caused damage to the reputation of the format and the good name of those who have dedicated their professionalism to its great success over the years.”\n\n\tThe totally tatoo-clad Corona has been jailed several times in Italy for extortion and blackmail related to celebrity photos, most notably during Italy’s so-called Vallettopoli scandal in 2007, which involved showgirls who appeared on Silvio Berlusconi-era Mediaset shows as well as TV and movie actors, soccer players and politicians.\n\n\tThis latest scandal prompted by Corona is certainly well-timed to promote his Netflix docuseries.\n\n\t“Communication genius or shameless manipulator?” asks Netflix’s promotional materials for “Paparazzi King.”\n\n\tThe five-episode show, Netflix adds, “spans the Berlusconi era, the rise of social media and the contradictions of Italian justice, with an unfiltered story that is not intended to be a biography of the ‘King of Paparazzi,’ but a portrait of a country that, from the 1990s to today, has ceased to distinguish between reality and reality TV.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tCinema United told Congress on Wednesday that it has concerns about the sale of Warner Bros., arguing that losing a major studio will result in fewer movies, job losses and theater closures. In a letter to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Administrative State, Regulatory Reform and Antitrust, the exception industry trade group focused much of its attention on the threat that Netflix could pose to their business, noting the streaming service’s skepticism about the cinema business.\n\t\n\n\t“We are deeply concerned that this acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix will have a direct and irreversible negative impact on movie theaters around the world,” the group writes. “Such an acquisitionwill further consolidate control over production and distribution of motion pictures in the handsof a single, dominant, global streaming platform in a market that is already highly concentrated.The impact will not only be felt by theater owners, but by movie fans and surrounding businessesin communities of all sizes.”\n\n\n\tHowever, it stressed that if Netflix falters and Paramount — which is trying to outmaneuver the streaming giant — buys Warner Bros., that also presents challenges.\n\n\t“If Paramount or another major studio ends up displacing Netflix as the buyer, our concerns are no less serious,” the group writes. “A combination of Paramount and Warner Bros., for instance, would consolidate as much as 40% of each year’s domestic box office in the hands of a single dominant studio.”\n\n\tWhen Netflix announced that it had a deal in place to buy Warner Bros. and HBO Max for $82.7 billion, the company’s co-CEO Ted Sarandos said it would honor the studio’s existing theatrical commitments. Yet, he couched that, arguing that time windows, industry parlance for the amount of time movies play exclusively in theaters, will “evolve” in a way that is more “consumer friendly.”\n\t\n\n\t“If Netflix’s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. is not challenged, the threat to our members is grave —and possibly even existential — given its hostility toward exhibition,” the group writes. “Netflix described theatrical distribution ‘outmoded,’ and restated their goal that they make movies exclusively for Netflix members distributed primarily on Netflix, not in theaters.”\n\n\tCinema United notes that since 2023, the average theatrical window for Netflix films has been 11 to 17 days, which is in contrast to major studio films that have an average window of 46 days in 2024 and 58 days in 2023.\n\n\tIn general, Cinema United sounded skeptical that any sale of Warner Bros. to a competitor benefits the cinema business. It noted that there have been several mergers in recent years, including Amazon’s purchase of MGM and Disney’s acquisition of Fox, and that the new companies often released fewer films. In Disney’s case, the group says “the entities produced about half the movies they did annually pre-merger.”\n\n\tCinema United argues that if movie theaters go under, the economic impact will be felt in a much wider way. \n\n\t“Movie theaters are cultural and economic anchors of their communities — to repeat, we are a Main Street industry. That is what is at risk here if we sanction fewer movies in the marketplace. Theaters will close, communities will suffer, jobs will be lost.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMiraculous Corp and Monlove have partnered to develop a new live stage production based on the global animated franchise “Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir,” set to launch worldwide in 2027.\n\n\tThe show is being created by Ella Louise Allaire and Martin Lord Ferguson, the award-winning duo behind family entertainment productions including “Ice Age Live! A Mammoth Adventure,” “Scooby-Doo! and The Lost City of Gold” and “All Systems Are Go! A NASA/Peanuts Experience.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production is developed in partnership with Miraculous Corp, produced by Montreal-based Monlove, and represented by Wasserman Music, with Mediawan as a key partner.\n\n\n\tThe stage show will feature an original story and songs, incorporating stage-to-video interaction, acrobatics, aerial choreography, illusion, dance and puppetry. The show centers on superheroes Ladybug and Cat Noir as they face a new threat.\n\n\tSince its 2015 debut, “Miraculous” has become one of the most recognized family entertainment franchises worldwide, reaching audiences in more than 150 countries. The franchise has 53 million followers across social platforms and 50 billion views on YouTube, with more than 300 licensing partners.\n\n\t“Miraculous has always been about more than superheroes – it’s about the courage to be yourself and the hero you choose to be every day,” said Roz Nowicki, global head of consumer products at Miraculous Corp. “With this ‘Miraculous’ live stage spectacular, we’re bringing that spirit to the stage in a bold new way. Partnering with Monlove allows us to honor the heart of the franchise while reimagining it as a world-class live experience that will connect with families and fans across generations and around the globe.”\n\t\n\n\tAllaire, founder and artistic director of Monlove, added: “I was drawn to ‘Miraculous’ because of Marinette, she’s bright, athletic, and creative: a teenage girl portrayed as a true superhero. We need more heroes like Ladybug and Cat Noir for families and for this generation of boys and girls. Our goal is to honor these extraordinary characters and celebrate the world created by Jeremy Zag, Thomas Astruc, and Nathanaël Bronn.”\n\n\tFerguson, head of creation at Monlove, said: “This isn’t a typical kids’ show. It’s a premium spectacle for family audiences that fuses stagecraft and technology to deliver moments you can’t get on a screen. It’s crafted like a pop concert, paced like an action film, and grounded in a fairytale, where courage is contagious.”\n\n\tMiraculous Corp is a joint venture between Mediawan and ZAG, established in 2024. Monlove was founded in 2005 by Allaire in partnership with Ferguson.\n\n\tSpecific cities, venues and on-sale dates for the 2027 world tour will be announced this year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTony Dokoupil‘s first week as “CBS Evening News” anchor under Bari Weiss continued to raise eyebrows during the new host’s Tuesday half-hour, which broadcast from Miami, Fla. as part of Dokoupil’s “Live From America Tour” to celebrate his first week on the job. Dokoupil, who was raised in Miami for a time as a child, did a companion interview with CBS Miami and fought back tears when asked why the city is his favorite place in the world.\n\t\n\n\t“It makes me emotional, it’s so funny,” Dokoupil said as he started wiping back tears and saying “let me get a second here” to compose himself.\n\n\n\t“To help people understand why I have such a reaction… Florida is where I grew up,” he continued, fighting back more tears. “My grandmother’s here, my father, my mother, my aunts and uncles, cousins, and it’s where I would have spent all of my childhood. But we left because my father got in trouble with business. We laugh about it now, but he was a drug dealer and he went to jail. The reason it’s so emotional for me is because I feel like I was robbed of the full Miami experience.”\n\n\tDuring the official broadcast, Dokoupil turned heads again by signing off with a tribute to Secretary of State and Miami’s own Marco Rubio. The host acknowledged the “many lives and many jobs” of Rubio, from being the face of U.S. foreign policy to “his roles as interim national security advisor” and more.\n\n\t“Whatever you think of his politics, you’ve got to admit it’s an impressive résumé,” Dokoupil said before showing AI memes casting Rubio in other jobs such as the prime minister of Greenland, the head of Hilton Hotels and the Michelin man.\n\t\n\n\tDokoupil concluded with a salute to Rubio: “Back in real life, of course, these memes may not add up to much, but for Rubio’s hometown fans, which are many around here in Miami, it’s a sign of how Florida, once an American punchline, has become a leader on the world stage. Marco Rubio, we salute you. You’re the ultimate Florida man.”\n\n\tEarlier in the week during Dokoupil’s debut, he struggled to read a teleprompter during an on-air gaffe and got confused over which segment he was supposed to be presenting. Dokoupil next heads to Dallas, Texas for the Wednesday broadcast of “CBS Evening News” as part of his “Live From America Tour.”\n\n\n\n\n",

Prior to that, “Poor Things” (Shona Heath and James Price) and “Dune” (Patrice Vermette and Zsuzsanna Sipos) also won the Oscar for production design.\n\t\n\n\tThe event will be produced by Megan Elizabeth Bell, Michael Allen Glover and Tom Wilkins. “As we commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Excellence in Production Design Awards, we celebrate not just the outstanding achievements of the past year, but also three decades of visionary artistry that have defined the visual storytelling of film and television,” said Dina Lipton, President of the Art Directors Guild. “This milestone honors the Art Directors, Illustrators, Storyboard Artists, Set Designers, Scenic and Graphic Artists and all of the creative minds who work in the art department and continue to captivate and inspire audiences worldwide.”\n\n\tBell, Glover and Wilkins said, “This 30th Annual ADG Awards marks a meaningful moment in our industry’s history, as we recognize the remarkable creativity and innovation that drive production design forward. We’re honored to gather the creative community to celebrate this year’s standout work across film, television, and beyond—and to pay homage to the legendary artists whose lifelong contributions have helped shape the art and craft of our profession.”\n\n\tThe ceremony will take place on Feb. 28 at the InterContinental Los Angeles Downtown. \n\n\tFEATURE FILM NOMINEES:\n\n\tPERIOD FEATURE FILM\n\n\t“Frankenstein”Production Designer: Tamara Deverell\n\n\t“Hamnet”Production Designer: Fiona Crombie\n\n\t“Marty Supreme”Production Designer: Jack Fisk\n\n\t“The Phoenician Scheme”Production Designer: Adam Stockhausen\n\n\t“Sinners”Production Designer: Hannah Beachler\n\n\tFANTASY FEATURE FILM\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash”Production Designers: Dylan Cole, Ben Procter\n\n\t“The Fantastic Four: First Steps”Production Designer: Kasra Farahani\n\n\t“Mickey 17”Production Designer: Fiona Crombie\n\n\t“Superman”Production Designer: Beth Mickle\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good”Production Designer: Nathan Crowley\n\n\tCONTEMPORARY FEATURE FILM\n\n\t“Bugonia”Production Designer: James Price\n\n\t“F1”Production Designers: Ben Munro, Mark Tildesley\n\n\t“Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning”Production Designer: Gary Freeman\n\n\t“One Battle After Another”Production Designer: Florencia Martin\n\n\t“Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery”Production Designer: Rick Heinrichs\n\n\tANIMATED FEATURE FILM\n\n\t“The Bad Guys 2”Production Designer: Luc Desmarchelier\n\t\n\n\t“Elio”Production Designer: Harley Jessup\n\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters”Production Designers: Mingjue Helen Chen, Dave Bleich\n\n\t“The SpongeBob Movie: Search for Squarepants”Production Designer: Sean Haworth, Animation Production Designer: Pablo R.

    "body": "\n\tThe Resonator Awards will return in late January in what is being billed as a “kick-off” to Grammy week, with Chaka Khan, St. Vincent and Haim among the figures being honored in a program being put on Jan. 27 at Chaplin Studios by We Are Moving the Needle, an organization devoted to increasing recognition for women and non-binary individuals in the recording industry.\n\n\tBehind-the-scenes luminaries set to receive awards at the event include songwriter Amy Allen, producers Alissia and Roselilah, recording and mix engineers Jayda Love and Bella Blasko, the writer-producer duo Elvira Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser, and audio company co-founder Betty Bennett.\n\t\n\n\tThe evening boasts a high-profile list of presenters, with Olivia Rodrigo, Laufey, Addison Rae, Anderson .Paak, Jason Isbell, Aaron Dessner, Sia, Tony Berg and Rostam among those set to hand off awards to friends and colleagues. Performers will be announced at a later date. \n\n\n\tThis will be the second time We Are Moving the Needle has presented the Resonator Awards. The first such event was in 2024; the 2025 edition was canceled last January, along with a good number of other pre-Grammy events, in the wake of the devastating Los Angeles-area fires.\n\n\tThe event, which will include a seated dinner, is among the first high-profile ticketed events to take place on Chaplin Studios’ soundstage since the former A&M/Henson lot was formally rebranded by new owners John Mayer and McG.\n\n\t“Empowered women empower women,” said honoree Khan in a statement. “I am honored to be part of a movement that celebrates the creativity, resilience and determination of women creators everywhere. We lift each other and shine. Together, we are moving the needle.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWe Are Moving the Needle is a 501c3 non-profit founded by Emily Lazar, who will also be among the presenters. In 2019 Lazar became the first female mastering engineer to win a Grammy for best engineered album, non-classical (for Beck’s “Colors”). \n\n\tThe 2025 awards and their respective presenters are:\n\n\tLuminary Award – Chaka Khan, presented by Sia. Khan will be having a big week during Grammy week, and not just because of this award. She’ll be getting the lifetime achievement award from the Recording Academy at the Special Merit Awards on Jan. 31. She’s also a prior 10-time Grammy winner. \n\n\tGolden Trifecta Award – St. Vincent, presented by Olivia Rodrigo. Rodrigo is returning the favor done when St. Vincent presented her with a Variety Hitmakers award. Their friendship includes co-writing the track “Obsessed” for Rodrigo’s “Guts” album. St. Vincent has won six Grammys. \n\n\tDisruptors Award – Haim, presented by Rostam. Haim is a five-time Grammy-nominated group that recently wrapped up a U.S. tour behind its “I Quit” album of last year.\n\n\tPowerhouse Award – Gena Johnson, presented by Jason Isbell. Johnson received acclaim last year for engineering Isbell’s solo acoustic album, “Foxes in the Snow,” and in fact she was the only other person in the studio with him. She has two Grammys (including best Americana album for Isbell’s previous full-band effort, “Weathervanes”). \n\n\tExceptional Ears Award – Bella Blasko, presented by Aaron Dessner. As a recording and mixing engineer, Blasko has worked with Taylor Swift, the National and Gracie Abrams, among others.\n\n\tExceptional Ears Award – Jayda Love, presented by a guest to be announced. Love is currently nominated for a record of the year Grammy (as the engineer/mixer of Doechii’s “Anxiety”).\n\n\tCalliope Award – Amy Allen, presented by Laufey. Allen has four Grammy nominations going into this year’s ceremony — for songwriter of the year, non-classical (following her win last year); album of the year (for Sabrina Carpenter’s “Man’s Best Friend”; and song of the year, twice (for writing contributions the Bruno Mars/Rosé single “APT.” and Carpenter’s “Manchild”).\n\n\tAll-Star Award – Alissia, presented by Anderson .Paak. Alissia is among this year’s nominees for producer of the year, non-classical. Her credits include Mary J. Blige, Kaytranada and, of course, .Paak.\n\t\n\n\tIn Stereo Award – Elvira Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser, presented by Addison Rae. Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser served as Rae’s songwriter-producer collaborations on the debut album that earned the singer a best new artist nomination.\n\n\tBreakthrough Award – Roselilah presented by Emily Lazar. Roselilah is currently up for a record of the year Grammy (for co-producing Kendrick Lamar and SZA’s “Luther”).\n\n\tEqualizer Award – Betty Bennett presented by Tony Berg. Bennett is co-founder of the audio company Apogee Electronics.\n\n\tAlso part of the program will be a presentation of the Resonator Hall of Fame Awards, designated for the career achievements of producers and engineers. Those honorees are:\n\n\tAllee Willis (In Memoriam)\n\n\tElaine Martone\n\n\tJaime Sickora\n\n\tJudith Sherman\n\n\tMary Mazurek \n\n\tMichelle Sabolchick \n\n\tSophie (In Memoriam)\n",

    "body": "\n\tJacob Soboroff will never forget the feeling he had as he rushed out of the NBC News’ Los Angeles bureau on the afternoon of Jan. 7, 2025, as word began to spread of a devastating fire in the area where he grew up in Pacific Palisades. \n\n\tThe veteran correspondent and author volunteered to go the chaotic scene because of his personal connection and familiarity with the area. Within 48 hours, his childhood home and most of what he remembered from his youth in the 1980s and ’90s had been reduced to ashes and rubble.\n\t\n\n\tSoboroff turned his in-the-moment reporting into the basis for a book that chronicles the extraordinary events of Jan. 7 and Jan. 8, which left more than 6,800 homes and buildings in the Palisades and Malibu area. Another 9,400 homes and structures were destroyed 35 miles away to the east in Altadena. “Firestorm: The Great Los Angeles Fires and America’s New Age of Disaster,” was published Jan. 6 by Mariner Books, an imprint of HarperCollins.\n\n\n\tHere, Soboroff discusses his reporting on the still-disputed events that unfolded during the peak of the inferno, and what it portends for the future of weather-driven disasters.\n\n\tYour book title is “Firestorm: The Great Los Angeles Fires and America’s New Age of Disaster.” I want to start by talking about the second half of that, of that title. In the reporting of this, what did you learn about America’s new age of disaster?\n\n\tI ended up covering the carbonization, the destruction, the incineration of my childhood home and my childhood hometown, and watching it happen in real time with my own eyes. And I couldn’t comprehend at the time exactly what I was witnessing. What I have come to learn in writing this book and spending the better part of 2025 diving deep into the experience that I had, and reflecting on it and reporting it out, is that in some measure it was the fire of the future. And so when I say America’s new age of disaster, to me, it also is synonymous with the fact that I experienced what one senior career emergency management official who has spanned Democratic and Republican administrations said to me was something not only that was a look into my past, at my childhood, but also into my own children’s future.\n\t\n\n\tSo what the new age of disaster is, and what the fire of the future is, is a conflagration, excuse the term, of several things. There is not one proximate cause to natural disasters like the one we experienced in L.A., the costliest wildfire event in American history. It was obviously the global climate emergency, but it’s also the degradation of our infrastructure. It’s also changes in the way we live. I went back and listened to a lot of audio and watched video of my reporting, and I heard electric car batteries exploding all around us. And I think maybe most importantly, it is the misinformation and disinformation, the charged political moment that we’re living in that makes the recovery from events like this all the more difficult, and all the more painful, instead of the opposite, which is what I think we all expect.\n\n\tIn doing all of this investigative reporting with incredible sourcing that you have, but did you find things that helped you understand where that infrastructure is just breaking down?\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn the book in particular you see the relationship completely falling apart between Gavin Newsom, the governor of California and Donald Trump, the President-elect at the time. [President] Joe Biden, a lot of people might forget, was actually here in Southern California when the fires broke out. He was going down to the Coachella Valley and to the Chuckwalla National Monument to dedicate the final national monument of his presidency. Gavin Newsom, as you will see, was literally on his way driving there, getting ready to meet Joe Biden. And their relationship, interestingly, was critical to the major disaster declaration being declared almost immediately, because the two of them were in person together, and the President United States was here, but Donald Trump almost inexplicably injected himself from the moment that the fires started and started sowing the seeds of misinformation and disinformation about who was to blame, about whether one person could be to blame for something like this. And of course, he blamed “Newscum.” And [Los Angeles] Mayor Karen Bass, but also pointed a finger at the water supply, saying that there was some magical, mystical source of water from the Pacific Northwest that could, quote, unquote, flow down with a tap that would open, and it would have stopped the fires or prevented them from happening in the first place. I’m not absolving local political leaders at all. Gavin Newsom promised me when I interviewed him for ‘Meet the Press’ a Marshall Plan 2.0 for Los Angeles, I haven’t seen that materialized. Karen Bass, of course, was in Ghana on that presidential delegation [when the fires began], and there are lots of questions about what could have been done differently operationally, whether it’s deploying firefighters to different places in the Palisades, or taking down those big steel lattice towers in Altadena that were inactive but were the source of the Eaton fire. All of that there is ripe for decades, frankly, of investigative journalism that’s happening from from our colleagues in the local media in Los Angeles. \n\t\n\n\tBut what this book will show you is that in real time, minute to minute, what it was like to be there and what it was like to feel Elon Musk down at Zuma Beach, talking to firefighters, pressing them on a live stream, and Gavin Newsom watching and having to respond in real time, what it was like for residents to experience this confusion about information, where it was coming from, and what the source of it was and how to even figure out when and how to evacuate. I think all of it combined sowed the seeds for the travesty that we all experienced together, collectively, and the trauma that we’re all trying to still recover from, which is part of the reason I wanted to do this. I’ve never had to process a story I have personally covered in the way that I had to cover this one. And so for me, it’s as cathartic as I hope it might be for people reading it in Los Angeles and around the world to want to learn about this event and what it really meant to the people, in my opinion, the greatest city in the world.\n\n\tIn the immediate aftermath of the fires there was discussion about maybe there should have been more accessibility and exit routes in the central core of the Palisades that was so devastated. Was it hard to report those kinds of things about your hometown?\n\n\tI can’t wait for people to read the scenes in the book about L.A. Fire Department air support having to figure out that they had to ground themselves. This is not something is not something that anybody that is in that line of work takes lightly. And so the decision to ground those choppers really does show the severity of the conditions at the time, and then as it relates to the building materials and the fact that we all, in some some way, put ourselves in harm’s way. That’s not new. In the 1960s when, after the Bel-Air fire, the L.A. Fire Department produced a documentary called “Design for Disaster,” and it literally talked about how the ways in which we live in Los Angeles are primed to make us all victims of massive wildfire events like happened in the ‘60s and happened again in early January of 2025 and so now I think it’s more acute and more sort of obvious than ever to everybody. The question is, do we when we come back, if we come back, and there are big questions about that, how do you build back? Is it? Is it a decision that everyone will make to want to live in such vulnerable circumstances as part of the paradox of living in a place that is unbelievable and as deadly as Mike Davis has told us all about Los Angeles.\n\t\n\n\tCity of Quartz. Of course, Hollywood is the big hometown business. Did you get a sense of how the entertainment industry was affected by the fires? One thing we saw right afterwards was a lot of calls for more tax incentives and government support to keep the industry here. For a moment it seemed like there was going to be some good that comes out of this for the industry.\n\n\tWhat it meant for the entertainment industry and what it meant for our neighbors who work in in Hollywood and who have been really suffering. Perhaps for a moment it did open the eyes to the policymakers that we need to incentivize people to continue to come to work in Southern California and in Los Angeles, because of how clear it was after the fires, how bad the industry was hurting. And I think that that same story can sort of be extrapolated as well to the defense of immigrants that we’re seeing in the city while they’re rebuilding, or the realization that L.A. is one of the most unaffordable cities, not only in the United States, but on planet Earth. And all of these things are issues that needed to be addressed before the fire, but I think in the wake of the fire it is crystal clear for all of us how acute those issues are.\n\n\tHave you and your family found a way to memorialize or process all that you lost?\n\n\tThere’s a physical memorial outside the Palisades Recreation Center, the building was around World War II. There is a giant bronze plaque about the rebuilding of the park at the Palisades Park in 1986 when I was two going on, three years old, that my dad and my mom and my four grandparents all participated in the fundraising for. That plaque still stands. And when I go back there, I see the names, not just of my mom and dad and my grandpa Irv, and grandma Evelyn and my mom’s parents, but I see the names of so many neighbors, some of whom lost their homes in the fire, some of whom I hadn’t thought about in a long time, some of whom are no longer with us. It’s where I go every time I go back to the Palisades now, because it reminds me of what that place was, not just in the days before the fire, because it had changed, but what that place means to me. And I hope that everybody can find something like that for them as we try to move forward from this. And I think that the book hopefully can be that for a lot of people.\n",

Watts claims he submitted the script to a production company back in the day, which was absorbed by Lionsgate.\n      \n    \n          Watts claims Joshua Cozine worked for Lionsgate at the time and even emailed with him about the film ... and, Cozine attended USC's film program at the same time as Cooper years earlier -- which Watts claims creates the basis for a \"reasonable possibility\" Cooper had access to the film.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Watts also cites Wan's past comments about being a \"creepy doll aficionado\" as potential evidence he saw \"Paranormal Adoption.\"\n      \n    \n          Watts is suing all the defendants for copyright infringement. He's asking the court to award him at least $5 million.\n      \n    \n          \"M3GAN\" became a huge hit after its release in 2023 ... spawning the 2025 sequel \"M3GAN 2.0\" and an upcoming spin-off titled \"SOULM8TE.\"\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                James Wan\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Confronted with accountability for his own conduct, Baldoni became fixated on the perceived threat Blake posed and went to extraordinary lengths to try to bury her.\"\n      \n    \n          Remember ... Lively sued Baldoni and several of his associates over alleged sexual harassment and retaliation, seeking $160 million in damages back in December 2024. Baldoni denied the claims and filed a $400 million countersuit, which was dismissed. Their next court date is set for January 22.\n      \n      ",

He said he served her favorite breakfast each morning, as well as her afternoon snack -- tea with milk and a croissant.\n      \n\n          The morning of her death, d'Ormale said he was half asleep when he heard Bardot say, \"Pioupiou,\" the nickname the couple used for each other in private. Then \"it was over,\" d'Ormale notes.\n      \n    \n          Bardot began her career as a teen model, gracing the cover of Elle magazine at 15 years old before becoming a film star in Europe with major box office success. She appeared in hit movies like \"Naughty Girl,\" \"Plucking the Daisy,\" \"Babette Goes to War,\" and \"La Parisienne.\" She also crossed into Hollywood with \"Dear Brigitte\" opposite James Stewart, and starred alongside Sean Connery in \"Shalako.\"\n      \n    \n          Bardot was 91.\n      \n    \n          RIP\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Brigitte Bardot\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                RIP\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Death\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

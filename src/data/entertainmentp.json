    "body": "\n\tOn the red carpet for the DGA Awards Saturday night, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos addressed the proposed Netflix-Warner Bros. merger and President Donald Trump’s possible role in the deal. \n\n\tAsked by Variety‘s Marc Malkin if it makes him nervous when the President says he’s watching the deal, Sarandos answered, “Look, I think he has a keen interest in the entertainment business.”\n\n\t“He knows about the entertainment business, and he really does care about the health of the industry, the American industry generally, but I think particularly the entertainment industry,” Sarandos continued. \n\t\n\n\tHowever, Sarandos said on the carpet, “He’s made no indication that he’s going to do anything or be involved in any way that’s improper. This is the DOJ’s deal.”\n\n\n\tSarandos testified before the Senate on Tuesday, and was adamant in his testimony that the deal would be good for consumers. \n\n\t“Maybe, folks don’t quite understand is just how competitive the marketplace is, for where to put your project or where consumers are gonna watch it, and it’s never been more competitive.\n\n\t“It’s a really Wild West landscape right now, and this idea that there’s this concentration risk in our deal is ludicrous when you’ve got one player, YouTube, which is already 15% of TV time and growing.”\n\n\tHe characterized it as “fantasy world” to not consider YouTube as a major TV competitor. “We are 9% of the TV business,” he said, referring to Netflix. “We get HBO and we grow to 10%. That is not an antitrust problem.”\n\n\tSarandos continues to insist that Netflix intends to preserve a robust theatrical window for Warner Bros. films. “We’re going to nurture Warner Brothers and HBO and Warner Brothers Television and make those great brands even better for the next century,” he told Variety.\n\t\n\n\tThe Netflix chief called it “ludicrous” that one senator claimed that 50% of the children’s content on Netflix had “trans ideology.” Netflix has something for everybody, Sarandos said, and viewers can block any content that offends them by title, which he says is unique to the streamer. \n\n\tWhen asked if there was any truth to the idea that the Department of War had an influence on the cancelation of Netflix’s “Boots,” Sarandos said “Absolutely not.”\n\n\t“These are all business decisions based on audience relative to the cost of the show. Do the people who push play watch it to the end? Do they give it a couple of thumbs up? Does it keep growing? All of those,” Sarandos explained.\n\n\t“That’s the best part about the internet, about our business, is that people really love the product and it’s it’s heartbreaking to cancel any show ever, particularly a show that Norman Lear brought to me. It was his last show. I’m a fan,” said Sarandos.\n",

    "body": "\n\tYou have to love Caleb McLaughlin for being so public about wanting to play Miles Morales.\n\n\t“I would love to play Miles,” he told me Friday night at the premiere of his new animated movie “Goat.”\n\n\tThe “Stranger Things” star has been a fan favorite to slip into the Spider-Man suit as Miles. \n\n\t“I think Miles represents something bigger than myself; it represents something bigger than most people,” he said. “Also, being from New York [McLaughlin grew up in the Bronx] and then just seeing the “Spider-Verse” story, I just feel it’s really, really connected and I feel like a lot of people understand what that means.”\n\t\n\n\tMiles was most recently voiced by Shameik Moore in the animated “Spider-Verse” franchise. “Sinners” star Hailee Steinfeld plays Gwen Stacy. A third and final “Spider-Verse” is set for release in June 2027.\n\n\tMcLaughlin’s latest comments come just about a month after speculation that he’s been cast as Miles hit a fever pitch after the actor posted videos on social media of his gymnastics training.\n\n\tHe recently ended his run as Lucas in “Stranger Things” with the show’s fifth and final season premiering on New Year’s Eve. “It’s a blessing,” he said. “Looking back on the past, I’m truly grateful for everything that I went through, people that I’ve met along the way and all the friends that I have. I am very grateful. I think life after the show is a new chapter and I’m happy to start it with ‘Goat.’”\n\n\t“Goat” marks McLaughlin’s first major role since “Stranger Things.”\n\n\t“Goat” tells the story of Will, a goat who gets a shot at playing a professional roarball, a basketball-like sport featuring the world’s biggest and strongest animals. The cast also includes Gabrielle Union, Stephen Curry (who is also producer on the film), Jennifer Hudson, Nicola Coughlan, Nick Kroll, David Harbour, Jenifer Lewis, Aaron Pierre, Patton Oswalt, Andrew Santino, Bobby Lee, Eduardo Franco, Sherry Cola and Jelly Roll. \n\t\n\n\t“Goat” is in theaters on Feb. 13.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tKumail Nanjiani gently skewered a room full of Hollywood heavyweights in his opening monologue at the Directors Guild Awards, taking aim at the Epstein files, runaway production, the extended running times of many movies and the fact that the guild’s top award was named in honor of director D.W. Griffith until 1999.\n\n\tHe quipped that the DGA kudos, which are part of a marathon of industry precursor awards events leading up to the March 15 Academy Awards, represents “Hollywood’s biggest night — Excuse me, Vancouver, Budapest and sometimes Atlanta,” he said. Looking out at the ballroom at the Beverly Hilton, with tables packed with directors and their teams of assistant directors and unit production managers, Nanjiani observed, “It’s like if a movie was just the credits.”\n\t\n\n\tNanjiani noted that as a native of Karachi, Pakistan, his gig as host marked a first for the Directors Guild Awards: “You don’t have to know where I’m from to know I’m the first person from there to host this show,” he said.\n\n\n\tNanjiani delivered a 20-minute opening in front of a room that included DGA president Christopher Nolan, Steven Spielberg and DGA nominees Ryan Coogler, Paul Thomas Anderson, Chloe Zhao and Josh Safdie. He closed on a heartfelt note that was then punctuated with a final joke about Griffith, whose 1915 film “The Birth of a Nation” presents an abjectly racist vision of post-Civil War America, with the Klu Klux Klan presented as a heroic organization. \n\n\tNanjiani lauded “the power of filmmaking” and told a story about the first movie he saw in a theater as a kid growing up in Pakistan: Spielberg’s 1993 smash “Jurassic Park.” Nodding to the director, who is a DGA board members, Nanjiani stated, “You made an audience of people on the other side of the world explode with laughter.” He made oblique references to DGA nominees “Sinners,” “The Pitt” and “Marty Supreme.”\n\t\n\n\t“This is why what you all do is so important right now. We are in a moment where people are focused on the differences between us, but your beautiful art reminds us that we have all have much more in common than we don’t,” Nanjiani said. “I can watch your work and know what it feels like to be in a juke joint in the Mississippi Delta or to try to patch up people in an ER in Pittsburgh. You even made me give a shit about ping pong. I’m kidding. I’m Asian. I have always given a shit about ping pong.\n\n\t“In this challenging moment is more important than ever, and I genuinely, sincerely thank you for doing it. You remind us of our shared humanity while also celebrating our differences, because our commonality may make us human, but our differences make us beautiful — and that is what D. W. Griffith represents,” Nanjiani said.\n\n\tAmong Nanjiani’s other zingers: \n\n\t“I’d ask you to keep your speeches short but I’ve seen your movies we all know that’s not going to happen.”\n\n\t“Every bad guy in ‘Sinners’ is a white person, which makes it the most realistic movie of the year. No offense to almost everyone here. No film has so effectively captured the true horror of white people dancing.”\n\n\tNanjiani riffed on the fact that “Sinners” star Michael B. Jordan shares a first and last name with the NBA legend: ” ‘Sinners’ starred Michael B. Jordan and his brother Scottie B. Pippen. For those who don’t know, Michael Jordan was a basketball player, and Scottie Pippen did as much work as he did for a fraction of the praise and money. He was like his first AD.”\n\n\tNanjiani returned his focus to Spielberg when he noted that the filmmaker has made films in the past (2002’s “Minority Report,” 1993’s “Schindler’s List” and 1982’s “ET the Extra-Terrestrial”) that have predicted the tumult and technological and societal disruption of modern times. He also worked in a jab at President Trump, albeit not by name.\n\n\tSpielberg “is not only perhaps the greatest filmmaker of all time, he’s also clairvoyant. He’s made movies about everything we’re talking about right now: AI, Nazis, the government coming after harmless aliens. It’s like you’ve predicted the last 10 years of our lives. Steven, can your next movie be about an 80-year-old on the Epstein list who gets shot into space?”\n\t\n\n\tNolan, the most prominent director brand in Hollywood today, addressed the challenges that Hollywood’s creative community is facing amid the great contraction in film and TV and consolidation among its largest players. Hollywood’s three key creative unions — SAG-AFTRA, Writers Guild of America and DGA — are heading into a new contract negotiation cycle that begins Feb. 9 when SAG-AFTRA sits down with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.\n\n\t“In 2024 our employment was down about 40% and that was followed by another decline in 2025,” Nolan said. “The complicated part of this is that we as directors have to talk to our employers, talk to the people who run our business, and really get to grips with that the amount of money that people spend on our work, on entertainment, is very, very steady. Audiences are invested in us. We have to be sure that we are able to repay that investment.”\n\n\tNolan continued, “We are the storytellers. We are the people who have to innovate on the screen. And it’s very, very important that as our industry progresses, new technologies and new forms of distribution come along that we are always sensitive to. How are our voices being put across? How can we get our messages across? How can we engage with that audience and repay that investment that they continue to give us?”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTeam USA alpine skier Mikaela Shiffrin on Saturday told reporters during a press conference (via USA Today) that she hopes to elevate “inclusivity… diversity and kindness” at the 2026 Winter Olympics despite the current political turmoil in the United States.\n\n\tWhen asked about representing the United States during a time of deep social and political division, she said, “I think there’s a lot of hardship in the world globally, and there’s a lot of heartbreak, there’s a lot of violence. It can be tough to reconcile that when you’re also competing for medals in an Olympic event. I actually have some thoughts. I can read something that I had written.”\n\t\n\n\tShiffrin then shared a quote from Nelson Mandela. She said she was inspired by Charlize Theron, who quoted the South African civil rights leader during the Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony. “’Peace is not just the absence of conflict. Peace is the creation of an environment where we can all flourish regardless of race, color, creed, religion, gender, class, caste, or any other social markers of difference.’”\n\n\n\tShe concluded, “And for me, as this relates to the Olympics, I’m really hoping to show up and represent my own values. Values of inclusivity, values of diversity and kindness and sharing, tenacity, work ethic, showing up with my team every single day, like I said before, and the values that we bring and put out on the mountain and on the hill every single day. I’m hoping to represent those who have been supporting me this entire time, and I’m really thankful to be here. My greatest hope for these Olympic Games, from a broader perspective, is that it is a beautiful show of cooperation and of competition.”\n\t\n\n\tTeam USA’s freestyle skiers also had some complicated feelings about representing America. Chris Lillis told the press he feels “heartbroken” about the turmoil that ICE has caused in Minnesota, but hopes American athletes can represent a more unified vision of the United States.\n\n\t“I think that as a country, we need to focus on respecting everybody’s rights and making sure that we’re treating our citizens, as well as anybody, with love and respect,” Lillis said. “I hope that when people look at athletes compete in the Olympics, they realize that that’s the America that we’re trying to represent.”\n\n\tFellow Team USA freestyle skier Hunter Hess said during a press conference that representing the United States brings up “mixed emotions,” and that if he wins a medal, it would be more for his “family and the people that support me getting here” than his home country.\n\n\t“I think it’s a little hard,” Hess said. “There’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren’t. If it aligns with my moral values, I feel like I’m representing it. Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the U.S.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDays after The Washington Post laid off nearly one-third of its staff, the outlet’s publisher and CEO, Will Lewis, has stepped down. Current CFO Jeff D’Onofrio will step into Lewis’ role, effective immediately. \n\n\t“After two years of transformation at The Washington Post, now is the right time for me to step aside,” Lewis wrote in an email to staffers that was then shared to X by Post reporter Matt Viser. “I want to thank Jeff Bezos for his support and leadership throughout my tenure as CEO and Publisher. The institution could not have a better owner.”\n\t\n\n\tLewis’ note continued: “During my tenure, difficult decisions have been taken in order to ensure the sustainable future of The Post so it can for many years ahead publish high-quality nonpartisan news to millions of customers each day.” \n\n\n\tD’Onofrio joined the Post in June 2025, having formerly been the CFO of Raptive and, before then, the CEO of Tumblr. He also held leadership roles at Yahoo and Google.\n\n\t“The Post’s resolute commitment to writing the first rough draft of history anchors and imprints its future,” said D’Onofrio in a statement. “I am honored to become part of charting that future and to take the lead in securing both the legacy and business of this fierce, storied American institution.”\n\n\tJeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, also issued a statement: “The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity. Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus. Jeff, along with Matt and Adam, are positioned to lead The Post into an exciting and thriving next chapter.”\n\t\n\n\tLewis’ statement on his departure is the first Washington Post staffers have heard from the executive following Wednesday’s layoffs, though a now-viral snap posted of Lewis to X shows that he was at a red carpet for the NFL honors on Thursday ahead of the Super Bowl in San Francisco. \n\n\tPrior to stepping down, Lewis had served as the newspaper’s publisher and CEO for the past two years,\n",

    "body": "\n\tSam Raimi told Total Film that Rachel McAdams was “underutilized” in his 2022 MCU sequel “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” and after that movie, he “promised” himself he would work with her again. This pledge led to Raimi casting McAdams in his latest comedy thriller, “Send Help.”\n\n\t“First, she was the perfect person because she’s such a brilliant actress,” Raimi said. “I had a chance to work with her on my last film and saw how talented she was and actually underutilized, and I promised myself that I would work with her again. And then this film came up, and her warmth is wonderful.”\n\t\n\n\tHe added, “The fact that she has not really played a dark, terrible villain before, [producer Zainab Azizi] is the one that told me this, really sets the audience up to be surprised.”\n\n\n\t“Send Help” follows an underutilized and undervalued employee (McAdams) and her younger, douchebag boss (Dylan O’Brien), whose toxic power dynamic is reversed when they become stranded on a remote island. Other cast members include Dennis Haysbert, Edyll Ismail, Xavier Samuel, Chris Pang and Thaneth Warakulnukroh. The film hails from Disney and 20th Century.\n\n\t“Because the movie’s focus is not a whodunnit, but what comes next, that’s what really the movie wants to do to the audience,” Raimi concluded. “They don’t know what’s right around the corner. It turns left when they think it’s gonna turn right, that was an important factor, that she, this good person that we know and love, becomes this terrible villain.”\n\n\t“Send Help” is currently in theaters nationwide.\n",

The event, honoring the year’s most outstanding directorial achievements in film and television, was hosted by Oscar and Emmy-nominated comedian Kumail Nanjiani and took place in Beverly Hills.\n\n\tThe DGA Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Theatrical Feature Film has long been one of the most reliable predictors of the Academy Award for best director, which makes the ceremony one of the season’s most closely watched bellwethers for the Oscars race.\n\t\n\n\tIn his acceptance speech, Anderson spent much of the time paying tribute to late assistant director Adam Somner, who died in 2024.\n\n\n\tOn the TV side, “The Pitt” won the top dramatic series prize, via helmer Amanda Marsalis for the episode “6:00 PM.” She even beat out “The Pitt” exec producer John Wells, also nominated. In comedy, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg picked up the win for their “The Studio” episode “The Oner,” which had also earned them a directing Emmy last September.\n\n\tGoldberg and Rogen dedicated their win to the late “Studio” star Catherine O’Hara. “We grew up in Canada and she is and was our idol since we were children,” Goldberg said. “She showed you could be an utter genius and the nicest person in the world.”\n\n\t“SNL50: The Anniversary Special” kicked off the evening’s wins, with director Liz Patrick landing the honors in the variety category. Later, “Dying for Sex” helmer Shannon Murphy won for limited or anthology series, and “Conan O’Brien Must Go’s” Mike Sweeney picked up the win for Reality/Quiz and Game. Netflix’s “Nonnas” won TV movie for director Stephen Chbosky.\n\t\n\n\tThroughout the night, the five DGA nominees in the top theatrical race — Paul Thomas Anderson (“One Battle After Another”), Ryan Coogler (“Sinners”), Guillermo del Toro (“Frankenstein”), Josh Safdie (“Marty Supreme”) and Chloe Zhao (“Hamnet”) — received their DGA medallions, presented by someone involved in the film’s production. (Leonardo DiCaprio presented the honor to Anderson, while Michael B. Jordan paid homage to Coogler, Jacob Elordi feted del Toro, Timothée Chalamet showed up for Safdie and Stephen Spielberg introduced Zhao.)\n\n\tQuipped Nanjiani (who, unlike previous DGA Awards host Judd Apatow, allowed his monologue to be viewed by reporters in the press room): “Welcome to the DGA Awards. It’s like if a movie was just the credits!” And later: “I’d ask you to keep your speeches short, but I’ve seen your movies, I know it’s not going to happen!”\n\n\tThis year’s film nominees also mark a historic milestone for representation. It is only the second time in DGA history that a majority of nominees in the organization’s top category hail from underrepresented communities. The first occurred in 2017, when Guillermo del Toro won for “The Shape of Water,” alongside fellow nominees Greta Gerwig (“Lady Bird”), Jordan Peele (“Get Out”), Christopher Nolan (“Dunkirk”) and Martin McDonagh (“Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”).\n\n\tSince its inception, the DGA has correctly predicted the Academy Award winner for best director in all but eight instances. The most recent divergence came in 2019, when Sam Mendes won the DGA Award for the war epic “1917” but lost the Oscar to Bong Joon Ho for the South Korean drama “Parasite,” which also captured best picture. Last year, Sean Baker won the DGA’s top honor for “Anora,” which went on to secure four Academy Awards, including best picture, best director, best original screenplay and best film editing.\n\n\tWhen it comes to the broader best picture race, DGA history points to the vital importance of a nomination. Only two films — “Driving Miss Daisy” (1989) and “CODA” (2022) — have won the Academy Award for best picture without receiving a DGA nomination. Meanwhile, six films have claimed the top Oscar prize without earning an Academy Award nomination for directing: “Wings” (1927), “Grand Hotel” (1932), “Driving Miss Daisy,” “Argo” (2012), “Green Book” (2018) and “CODA.”\n\t\n\n\t“Frankenstein” helmer Guillermo Del Toro is the only DGA nominee this year who failed to garner an Oscar nomination, with “Sentimental Value” director Joachim Trier earning the Academy slot instead.\n\n\tGoing into the night, Anderson’s action epic had amassed 35 critics and guild prizes for best picture, including a rare sweep of all four major critics prizes — National Board of Review, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, New York Film Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics. Only four films in history have achieved that feat: “Schindler’s List” (1993), “L.A. Confidential” (1997), “The Social Network” (2010) and now, Anderson’s latest. Of those titles, only “Schindler’s List” went on to win the Oscar for best picture. However, in the directing race, Anderson has been equally dominant, with 32 wins to date, while Coogler trails with 19.\n\n\tIn TV, “The Pitt” and “The Bear” led individual series with two nominations each. And “Saturday Night Live” tops all franchises with three noms, via a trio of different “SNL50” entities: The specials “SNL50: The Homecoming Concert” and “SNL50: The Anniversary Special” and the doc series “SNL50: Beyond Saturday Night.”\n\n\tIn addition to competitive awards, the DGA presented two special service honors recognizing exemplary contributions to the guild and the industry. Associate director and stage manager David Charles received the Franklin J. Schaffner Achievement Award, honoring extraordinary service to both the profession and the DGA. Commercials first assistant director Gregory G. McCollum will receive the Frank Capra Achievement Award, given in recognition of notable career achievement and outstanding service to the guild.\n\n\t“We could not be prouder to recognize the incredible work of this year’s nominees for their dedication to the art of filmmaking,” DGA president Christopher Nolan said in January when announcing the nominees. “On behalf of the entire Guild community, I extend my congratulations to these directors on this achievement, and we look forward to celebrating your work at the DGA Awards.”\n\n\tWinners will be updated throughout the night. The full list of nominees and winners appears below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPaul Thomas Anderson – Ryan Coogler – Chloe Zhao\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHere are this year’s film nominees and winners:\n\t\n\t\tDIRECTORIAL ACHIEVEMENT IN THEATRICAL FEATURE FILM\t\n\n\tWINNER: Paul Thomas Anderson, “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.

    "body": "\n\tSavannah Guthrie took to Instagram on Saturday afternoon to share another message with her mother’s kidnapper, this time saying she and her family will pay for Nancy Guthrie‘s return.\n\n\t“We received your message, and we understand,” Guthrie said in the video, flanked by her siblings Annie and Camron. “We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her. This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”\n\t\n\n\tNancy Guthrie went missing from her Arizona residence on Jan. 31, and on Monday, the Pima County Sheriff’s Office announced that the disappearance was being treated as a crime. Sheriff Chris Nanos told CBS that investigators found “very concerning” evidence in her home.\n\n\n\t“I believe she was abducted, yes,” he said. “She didn’t walk from there. She didn’t go willingly.”\n\n\tOn Thursday, the FBI, which is also investigating the suspected kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie, put up a $50,000 reward for information leading to her recovery, “and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.”\n\n\t“The FBI has agents, analysts and professional staff employees working day and night with our partners at the sheriff’s department,” FBI Special Agent in Charge Heith Janke said during a press briefing. “We have deployed additional intelligence and agents from our Phoenix office.”\n\n\tNanos, who also spoke during the briefing, said that authorities “have not identified a suspect or a person of interest in this case.” He also shut down claims that force entry was used to gain entrance to Nancy Guthrie’s home.\n\t\n\n\tDonald Trump, who ordered “all federal law enforcement” to help search for Nancy Guthrie, told reporters on Air Force One Friday night that the investigation is going “very well” and “definitive” answers as to what happened could be released in the coming days.\n\n\t“I think we’re doing very well in that regard,” he said. “You’re probably surprised to hear that. I think we’re doing very well. Very well meaning we have some clues, I think, that are very strong, and I think we could have some answers coming up fairly soon.”\n\n\tOn Wednesday evening, Savannah Guthrie posted an emotional video to her Instagram in which she and her two siblings, Annie and Camron, pleaded with their mother’s kidnapper to give them a sign of life.\n\n\t“She’s 84 years old. Her health, her heart, is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive, and she needs it not to suffer,” Guthrie said. “We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Milan Cortina Winter Olympics kicked off with an opening ceremony on Friday that averaged 21.4 million viewers on NBC and Peacock, according to preliminary Nielsen ratings and digital data from Adobe Analytics. \n\n\tThe official Nielsen Big Data + Panel viewership will be posted on Tuesday. But for now, NBCUniversal is reporting that this year’s Winter Olympics opening ceremony was up 34% from the one that kicked off the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics — which posted 15.9 million using similar methodology.\n\t\n\n\tCoverage of the ceremony, live from Italy, aired in the afternoon (“Milan Prime”) followed by a primetime presentation.\n\n\n\t“We are off to a strong start with Friday’s captivating Opening Ceremony highlighted by the historic cities, the scenic mountain areas, and the Parade of Athletes,” NBC Sports prexy Rick Cordella said in a statement. “The Opening Ceremony audience exceeded our expectations, and we can’t wait for the next two weeks of competition.”\n\n\tAccording to NBCU, the opening ceremony averaged more than 3 million on Peacock, making it the most streamed for a Winter Games. The company also noted that “Milan Cortina Olympics streaming consumption across NBCUniversal platforms exceeded 700 million minutes through Friday – most ever for a Winter Games and 2.5 times greater than the 2022 Beijing Olympics through the comparable time frame.”\n\n\tThe opening ceremony also gave Friday’s episode of “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” a boost, as the talker posted its most-watched telecast since Thanksgiving (2.3 million viewers).\n\t\n\n\tOn Sunday, the Winter Olympics will get another big ratings boost, as NBC is once again opting not to take advantage of the massive Super Bowl lead-out to promote a new, returning or pre-existing entertainment program. Instead, just like the network did in 2022, it will instead go right back to coverage of the Winter Olympics.\n\n\tAfter the Vince Lombardi trophy is hoisted at the end of Super Bowl LX on Sunday, Feb. 8, NBC Sports will segue to the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics primetime show, “Primetime in Milan,” at approximately 10:45 p.m. ET — including the women’s downhill competition (which will include Lindsey Vonn going for the gold as part of her comeback) and team figure skating.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“One Battle After Another” cinematographer Michael Bauman has won the British Society of Cinematographers Award for best cinematography in a feature film.\n\n\tThis is Bauman’s first win and nomination at the BSC Awards. He triumphed over “Die My Love” (Seamus McGarvey), “Marty Supreme” (Darius Khondji), “Sinners” (Autumn Arkapaw Arkapaw) and “Frankenstein” (Dan Lausten).\n\n\n\tWhen Bauman joined Variety for Inside the Frame, he said Anderson wanted something in the “vein of ‘70s cinema,” pointing to films like “The French Connection” and “The Last Detail.” He explained, “A lot of the movies in that period that had a certain stylistic roughness to it that he really felt was essential in telling this story. He also really wanted to shoot the movie in VistaVision.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the Television Drama (UK Terrestrial) category, Ollie Downey won for his work on the BBC drama “Reunion,” and in the Television Drama (International/Streaming) category, Suzie Lavelle won her second award for her photography of the Apple TV series “Severance.”\n\n\tIn the Music Video category, cinematographer Jake Gabbay followed on his victory at Camerimage by taking home the Cinematography in a Music Video Award for “Chains and Whips” from Kendrick Lamar, Pusha T and Malice.\n\n\tThe Operators Award, presented by the British Society of Cinematographers, Association of Camera Operators and Guild of British Camera Technicians named Danny Bishop Assoc the winner for his operating on the Netflix film “Ballad of a Small Player” and in the Television category Peter Robertson Assoc and Emiliano Topai were victorious for their work on the series “Mussolini: Son of the Century.”\n\t\n\n\tThe BSC Short Film Awards were presented to Linda Wu, Christopher Hudson and Theo Hughes for their respective films.\n\n\tThe evening was filled with emotional and humorous moments as the BSC presented its highest honor, the BSC Lifetime Achievement Award, to Remi Adefarasin.\n\n\tAdefarasin’s career began at the BBC, where he worked his way up through the ranks until reaching the role of Cinematographer – shooting while he was there some of the most iconic TV movies, including work by Mike Leigh, Adrian Shergold and Anthony Minghella. His work as a Feature Film Cinematographer led him to being Oscar-nominated in 1998 for “Elizabeth,” in so doing becoming the first Black Cinematographer to be nominated in that category. He was Emmy-nominated for his work on the Miniseries “Band of Brothers” and “The Pacific. “\n\n\tJohn de Borman received the BSC John Alcott Memorial Award for his work for the BSC, and focus puller Hilda Sealy was awarded the Special Achievement Award for her work toward transforming the industry into a more inclusive space. The BSC Bert Easey Technical Award was awarded to Optical Support.\n\n\tPresident of the British Society of Cinematographers, Oliver Stapleton said, “Tonight we celebrated 70 years of the British Society of Cinematographers Awards, a moment to reflect on the previous winners from ‘Lawrence of Arabia’ to ‘Schindler’s List,’ but also to celebrate the addition of ‘One Battle After Another’ to that list. My congratulations to all the winners and recipients tonight, your work is a reminder of just how vibrant and creative our industry still is.”\n\n\tThe awards were held at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London and hosted by Edith Bowman. The BSC wishes to thank all our sponsors who have helped make the evening happen.\n",

Kennedy Jr. certainly has some interesting hobbies ... including dinosaur bone hunting -- which he allegedly did with Jeffrey Epstein back in the day.\n      \n    \n          Among the numerous documents released by the Department of Justice related to the notorious pedophile recently were emails sent between Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell ... in which he said he went dinosaur and fossile hunting with renowned paleontologist Jack Horner on a ranch.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Maxwell then asked Epstein, \"Didn't we go fossil hunting with him and Bobby Kennedy in N Dakota?\" to which he replied yes.\n      \n\n          It's worth noting, this isn't the first we've heard about the trip ... Maxwell mentioned it when the DOJ interviewed her back in July -- though she said she doesn't remember Kennedy ever flying with them.\n      \n    \n          Kennedy also previously admitted he'd been on the trip with Epstein ... revealing on Fox News in 2023 he flew on Epstein's jet three times -- including once with his then-wife Mary Richardson Kennedy and their four children to go \"fossil hunting for a weekend.\" He made it clear he never flew on the jet without his family.\n      \n    \n          Kennedy is far from the only celebrity mentioned in the most recent release of the so-called \"Epstein Files\" ... with President Donald Trump, Jay-Z, Brett Ratner, Prince Andrew and more receiving mentions in the documents.\n      \n    \n          To be clear, Kennedy has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection to Epstein ... he was just an excited excavator!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jeffrey Epstein\n              \n                          \n                Robert F.

Or does Schizas have the same standards as everyone else?

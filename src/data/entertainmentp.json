    "body": "\n\tPaul Thomas Anderson won the BAFTA Film Award for best director for his sprawling and politically-charged satire “One Battle After Another,” which has long been an awards season favorite. As he accepted the award, Anderson quipped, “I feel like the prettiest girl in the room right now,” prompting laughter from the crowd.\n\n\tBut Anderson’s tone soon turned serious as he dedicated the award to the late producer, assistant director and Brit Adam Somner. “You may think that your greatest export is Alfred Hitchcock or Charlie Chaplin, but it wasn’t,” Anderson said. “To me, it was Adam Somner, who was my assistant director and producer for about 20 years. He came over to America and the line was out the door of people who wanted to work with him because he made us all better.”\n\t\n\n\tAnderson continued: “About three weeks into our film, he found out he was sick, and he made it through production. If you’ve ever gone to work before with someone who’s very ill, there’s something miraculous that makes you pay attention and reminds you the privilege of the work that we do. So thank you for sending him to me.”\n\n\n\tOne of contemporary cinema’s most acclaimed directors, the BAFTA win is Anderson’s first for best director, having previously been nominated in the same category for “We Will Be Blood” and “Licorice Pizza.” \n\n\tLoosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s novel “Vineland,” “One Battle After Another” — PTA’s most epic and ambitious film to date — follows a rabble of ex-revolutionaries reuniting to rescue a comrade’s daughter after an old enemy resurfaces. The ensemble cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, Regina Hall, Teyana Taylor and breakout Chase Infiniti. \n\t\n\n\tAnderson, also behind films such as “Boogie Nights,” “Magnolia” and “The Master,” can now add another director award to an array of honors that already includes best director at the Cannes Film Festival, the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival, and the Silver and Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\n\t“One Battle After Another” went into the BAFTA Awards leading the pack with 14 nominations, just two short of the record set by “Gandhi.” For the upcoming Academy Awards, the film has 13 nominations, with hopes that Anderson will finally add a long-awaited Oscar to his collection.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBerlinale hit “Truly Naked” bets on intimacy, not porn.\n\n\t“Porn is very much like WWE. It’s the fantasy that pays the bills. They get in the ring, fight and bleed. But it’s all fake,” adult performer Alessa Savage tells Variety. \n\n\t“As soon as you put sex into the mix, people find it harder to understand it’s not real. What you see in porn isn’t supposed to be replicated at home. Real intimacy is supposed to feel better than it looks.”\n\t\n\n\tIn Muriel d’Ansembourg’s film, Savage plays Lizzie, another adult entertainer who frequently works with Dylan (Andrew Howard). It’s a family business: his own teenage son, Alec (Caolán O’Gorman), films and edits their content. But when Alec meets Nina (Safiya Benaddi), he starts to crave more. \n\n\n\tAs reported by Variety, “Truly Naked” has already sparked bidding wars among distributors. It’s sold by M-Appeal.\n\n\t“The reception to the film has been absolutely phenomenal. It’s the right time for it. It’s the right time for people to talk about these subjects, for boundaries to be broken and for shame to be put aside,” adds Savage. \n\n\t“Seeing people fight for this film as much as Muriel has, as much as we all have, is heartwarming and nerve-wracking. It’s really something.”\n\n\tD’Ansembourg, making her feature debut, worked with Savage on her short “Fuck-a-Fan.” \n\n\t“Quite a few [adult] actresses have made that jump, like Sasha Grey, Nina Hartley or Chloe Cherry. There were so many women on our crew, which Alessa wasn’t used to. She has this incredible range she’d never really gotten to show,” says the director, who noticed a “strange contradiction” in our culture around sexuality. \n\t\n\n\t“It’s everywhere, it’s used to sell everything, and at the same time, so much shame and judgment can be attached to it. That’s heartbreaking. Sexuality can teach us a lot about ourselves and each other.”\n\n\tIn “Truly Naked,” Dylan strives for perfection. But d’Ansembourg chose to embrace the “messiness” of love lives instead. \n\n\t“It’s precisely those real moments that I find most compelling as a filmmaker. Real intimacy is awkward and hesitant, full of small gestures and stolen glances.”\n\n\tWhile occasionally explicit, the film cares for its characters. \n\n\t“We were all taken aback – and delighted – that the audience found its humor. That was a thrill because we were expecting walk-outs,” recalls Andrew Howard.\n\n\t“People have seen it work on many different levels aside from it being a tender, intimate coming-of-age love story. As a father of a young daughter, I find it damaging the way young people are learning about sex online, which is often extreme and violent, rather than fumbling about organically, like my generation did.”\n\n\tAlec and Nina are torn between what they see on their screens and what they experience together. \n\n\t“I think people don’t necessarily struggle with sex itself anymore because we’re surrounded by it in our everyday life. People struggle with vulnerability,” notes Caolán O’Gorman.\n\n\t“For me, at its core, this film isn’t really about porn. It’s about breaking free from old patterns, from the life you’ve been handed, and from the version of yourself you’ve been performing. Alec starts the film observing life rather than living it. He is detached and hides behind a camera. By the end, he chooses something more honest.” \n\n\tWhile the team worked with intimacy coordinator Philine Janssens, their main focus was never on the physical side, but on “the emotional truth underneath,” he says. His co-star Safiya Benaddi adds: “That contrast is the absolute heartbeat of the film. You can be physically exposed without being seen at all.”\n\n\tShe says: “We wanted to show that true intimacy is often quiet and awkward, and deeply personal, whereas the explicit world is loud, choreographed and transactional. The film highlights that vulnerability is an act of bravery.”\n\t\n\n\tStill, there was no shortage of bold moments. \n\n\t“It was quite daunting having to walk out in massive heels from Alessa and a strap-on, and dangle it in front of Andrew Howard’s face! He’s a brilliant actor, and I couldn’t walk in those heels to save my life.”\n\n\tBenaddi was also surprised by the laughter in the room during the premiere.\n\n\t“It was incredible to hear the audience grasp the bizarre tension between the mundane and the explicit. There’s a certain absurdity in the contrast between the high-pressure, neon-lit world of the adult industry and the reality of a stoic, rainy British seaside town.”\n\n\tAccording to Savage, people often feel more comfortable talking about “heinous things in life” because they are more detached from them. \n\n\t“Most people haven’t murdered or even punched someone, but everyone past a certain age has had sex or wants to have sex. All of the sex we see in the media, be it a Hollywood film or porn, is highly choreographed. It’s there to elicit certain reactions. It’s not there to facilitate real intimacy.” \n\n\tThe characters in the film find it easier to be naked than to talk about their feelings – she did too. \n\n\t“People have seen my naked body online for years, in all sorts of positions. But getting the opportunity to speak to them this way feels like I’m being seen for the first time.”\n\n\tUltimately, even in a world of “commodified bodies,” the human spirit is still searching for something real, observes Benaddi.\n\n\t“We’ve become very comfortable with pornographic imagery because it’s accessible at any time. In theory, that isn’t an issue, with consenting adults creating content for pleasure. In practice, it can become a mess. As my dad likes to say: ‘All things in moderation.’ Young people need guidance on this.” \n\n\t“[My character] Nina is looking at a world that’s supposedly all about intimacy, asking why it feels so cold. By approaching the topic with curiosity instead of shame, she opens up a lighter, more honest conversation. That’s what the audience responded to. They were invited into a dialogue.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAlessa Savage in ‘Truly Naked’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t© DoP Myrthe Mosterman\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMarty Mauser has lost another critical match — but this time, it was in the awards game.\n\n\tJosh Safdie’s sports dramedy “Marty Supreme” left this year’s BAFTA ceremony with an unwelcome distinction, tying the record for most losses in a single night after going 0-for-11.\n\n\tThe film entered BAFTA with formidable nomination strength and broad expectations of converting in at least a handful of categories — particularly for leading actor Timothée Chalamet, who picked up major stops this season at the Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes in Jan. In one of the night’s biggest shocks, Chalamet lost to Robert Aramayo from Kirk Jones’ Tourette’s drama movie, “I Swear.” \n\t\n\n\tNow, the A24 contender was shut out across the board, joining “Women in Love” (1969) and “Finding Neverland” (2004) as the only films to go winless with 11 nominations. Notably, both of those titles still went on to win a single Oscar on their respective nights: Glenda Jackson for best actress (“Women in Love”) and Jan A.P. Kaczmarek for original score (“Finding Neverland”). The BAFTA result is especially striking given Safdie’s own dominance on the ballot; he is the year’s most-nominated individual with four nominations, spanning his roles as director, co-producer, co-writer and co-editor.\n\n\n\tDespite the BAFTA setback, “Marty Supreme” remains a formidable player in the wider awards conversation, and history offers a reminder that a rough precursor night isn’t always fatal. Another A24 title, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (2022), managed only one BAFTA win (film editing) before going on to take seven Oscars, including best picture, director and three acting prizes. The moving drama “Moonlight” (2016) also went without a single BAFTA win that year, losing all four of its awards, before pulling off a historic upset in best picture at the Oscars.\n\t\n\n\tStill, the optics sting with a win-less night and a record-tying losses stat, which is not the kind of headline any campaign wants in the final stretch.\n\n\tAt BAFTA, “Marty Supreme” was nominated for best film, director, leading actor (Chalamet), supporting actress (Odessa A’zion), casting, original screenplay, production design, cinematography, costume design, film editing and makeup and hairstyling. At the Oscars, the film is nominated for nine, but misses BAFTA nominations for supporting actress and makeup and hairstyling.\n\n\tFinal Oscar voting runs from Feb. 26 to March 5. The 98th Oscars will be held on March 15 on ABC, hosted by Conan O’Brien.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThis weekend at the global box office was the tale of two holdovers as “Wuthering Heights” waltzed to $150 million while “GOAT” hit the $100 million mark.\n\n\tDirector Emerald Fennell’s gothic romantic drama “Wuthering Heights,” which ceded the top spot in North America to “GOAT,” was No. 1 at the international box office with $26.3 million from 76 markets. In a theatrical surprise, the R-rated film has been a bigger draw overseas with ticket sales having climbed to $91.7 million to date. Top foreign territories include the United Kingdom with $22.5 million, Italy with $9.4 million and Australia with $8.3 million. So far, “Wuthering Heights” has grossed $151.7 million worldwide against an $80 million production budget.\n\t\n\n\t“GOAT” captured second place with $17 million from 51 territories, representing 70% of its overseas footprint. Sony’s original animated adventure, about an animal who aspires to be a basketball champion, has earned $44 million internationally. The U.K. is the highest-grossing market with $14.5 million, followed by Mexico with $3.4 million and France with $3 million. Along with $58 million at the domestic box office, “GOAT” has generated $102.3 million against a price tag of $80 million.\n\n\n\tElsewhere at the international box office, Amazon MGM’s heist thriller “Crime 101” added $6.2 million from 75 markets in its second weekend of release. The film, starring Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo, has stalled with $21.6 million overseas and $46.3 million worldwide. That’s a terrible result for the studio considering it spent $90 million to produce the film (and theater owners keep roughly 50% of ticket sales).\n\t\n\n\tOutside of Hollywood releases, China’s comedy “Pegasus 3” is dominating with estimates of over $200 million during the Chinese New Year, a popular time for moviegoing in the country. The film is doing especially well in Imax with $21.7 million over the weekend, the second consecutive Chinese-language hit for the company after last year’s phenomenon “Ne Zha 2.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRyan Coogler continues to make history.\n\n\tCoogler added another landmark first to an already seismic awards season, winning the BAFTA for original screenplay for “Sinners” and becoming the first Black winner in the category’s history.\n\n\t“I didn’t expect that,” Coogler said as he took the stage to massive applause. “This is nerve-wracking.” \n\n\n\tCoogler continued: “I come from a community that loves me. They made me believe that I could do this, that I could be a writer. And it was amazing to be accepted into the community of film actors, the community of Los Angeles … For all the writers out there, when y’all look at that blank page, think of who you love, think of anybody who you’ve seen in pain that you identify with and wish they felt better and let that love motivate you. I’ll be forever grateful for this, thank you all.” \n\t\n\n\tHe beat a formidable lineup that included “I Swear” (Kirk Jones), “Marty Supreme” (Ronald Bronstein and Josh Safdie), “The Secret Agent” (Kleber Mendonça Filho) and “Sentimental Value” (Eskil Vogt and Joachim Trier).\n\n\tThe win bodes well for Coogler’s Oscar prospects, where he will face two of his BAFTA competitors again — “Marty Supreme” and “Sentimental Value” — along with “Blue Moon” (Robert Kaplow) and “It Was Just an Accident” (Mehdi Mahmoudian, Jafar Panahi, Shadmehr Rastin and Nader Saivar). At the Academy Awards, only one Black screenwriter has won for original screenplay: Jordan Peele for “Get Out” (2017) — coincidentally, also a horror film.\n\n\tCoogler’s historical horror “Sinners” is the year’s second-most nominated film at BAFTA with 13 nods — the most ever for a film directed by a Black filmmaker — and it shattered the all-time Oscars nominations record with 16.\n\t\n\n\tFinal Oscar voting will take place from Feb. 26 to Mar. 5. The 98th Oscars will be held March 15 and will air on ABC, hosted by Conan O’Brien. \n",

    "body": "\n\tDennis Quaid thinks that American politics have gone too far to the left in recent years. \n\n\tThe actor, who portrayed President Ronald Reagan in the 2024 biopic “Reagan,” was interviewed on Pastor Greg Laurie’s “The Greg Laurie Show” earlier this week. Laurie proposed to Quaid, “Things have gone so extremely, so far left right now. I saw a podcast — it was Bill Maher and Dana Carvey, and I’m forgetting the other guy’s name — but anyway, I think it was Dana Carvey said, ‘I’ve told my friends in Hollywood I’m a Clinton Democrat, and some of them are calling me a Nazi now.’”\n\t\n\n\tQuaid replied, “You can’t do that.”\n\n\n\tThe 71-year-old actor agreed that these days, being a Clinton Democrat is the “same thing as being a neo-con, on the right side or whatever. What used to be, you can’t be anymore.”\n\n\tHe doesn’t describe himself as a Republican, however “I’m a common-sense independent, myself, he said, although he leans “more conservative in my head.”\n\n\t“I’m just for common sense, is really what I am,” said Quaid.\n\n\tLaurie brought up the subject of the current president, describing Donald Trump as “very personable, incredibly funny, a good listener and surprisingly approachable person.” \n\n\tQuaid agreed that Trump is “surprisingly approachable and very funny. And really genuine. He wouldn’t be president if he wasn’t genuine. The people who voted for him, they know that he has their best interests at heart, that he is a genuine person.”\n\n\t“I’ve never seen anybody with that kind of energy,” Quaid continued. “People say that about me, but he’s really got a lot of energy.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen Laurie asked if he has stayed in the Lincoln bedroom at the White House, Quaid said he did stay in the Queen’s bedroom across the way. Quaid related that they “serve instant coffee in the morning” in the White House, which “really puts things in perspective.” “Pretty bad coffee,” he observed, then said it was during the Clinton presidency, during which time he once spent a whole weekend with the president.\n\n\tQuaid said that when he played Reagan, he tried to get “past the event, and get to the human of it,” such as portraying the former president’s facial nerve damage in addition to his walk. \n\n\t“We’re going through a spiritual revolution,” Quaid later told Laurie. “I’m not talking Republican and Democrat,” he says about the spiritual shift in the country, “But I am talking about those two coming together.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBAFTA Film Awards host Alan Cumming mostly left politics — domestic and global — outside the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday night but couldn’t resist a sly nod to world events, asking the Americans in the audience — which included Leonardo DiCaprio, Emma Stone and Donna Langley — whether the plot of “Zootopia 2” (called “Zootropolis” in the U.K.) reminded them of any world leaders.\n\n\t“Watching the films this year was like taking part in a collective nervous breakdown,” he said before recapping some of the biggest awards season contenders. “‘Hamnet’ a film about child death, ‘One Battle After Another,’ constant stress, hurry up Leo […] ‘Sinners’ any Scottish or Irish person will tell you, never let folk singers into a party. They’re always vampires. Oh and ‘Marty Supreme’ was so anxiety-ridden watching it was like doing a core workout and a dog nearly died. How dare you?”\n\t\n\n\t“Bugonia, with Emma Stone, the loveliest person in the world. Not anymore. Have you seen it? She wants to kill us all […] even ‘Bridget Jones’ – they killed Colin Firth, who does that?”\n\n\n\t“Then I thought, I know, I’ll watch a nice animated film to relax me and cheer myself up. Do you know the plot of ‘Zootropolis 2?’ Lies, corrupt leaders, poisoning and persecution of a race. Too soon, Disney. Come on, people. Cut us some slack here. Whatever happened to escapism? I’m exhausted. It’s almost as though, I don’t know, there are events going on in the real world that are influencing filmmakers. Anyone know what I’m talking about? No? Ring any bells for you Americans in particular? You know, I think it’d be a good idea if we all just had one big collective primal scream. Ready? Okay, let’s scream on the count of three. Are you ready? 123, aaarggggh. That felt better didn’t it?”\n\t\n\n\t‘Zootopia 2’ is up for two BAFTAs for best animated film and best children’s and family film. It lost in the latter category to “Arco.”\n\n\tNotably Cumming, who is the host of “The Traitors U.S.,” did not make any reference to U.K. politics or, in particular, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as the Duke of York, who was arrested last week on suspicion of misconduct in a public office. The former Duke’s nephew, Prince William, was in the first row of the audience as he is the president of BAFTA.\n\n\tSpeaking ahead of the awards, Cumming told the Press Association: “I know I’ve got to strike that balance between celebration and mischief, but I won’t be too satirical or mean because we’re there to celebrate people’s achievements.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Garden We Dreamed” opens on a complex symphony of natural sound: layer upon layer of birdsong, insect chatter and weather-rustled foliage, all the more intensified for playing out over a virtually dark screen. It’s barely the first light of dawn in the forested wilds of central Mexico, as the camera pans across treetops just discernible from the charred sky above them, and we’re reminded that nature, even at its most tranquil, is never quiet. Still, it’s drowned out in short order by the flatter, harsher man-made noise of trucks and power tools, as trees are felled and hasty construction begins. Joaquín del Paso’s film initially promises an environmental fable of sorts, a reflection on man’s destruction of the earth beneath his feet — though we’ll soon see it’s as much about man’s destruction of man too.\n\t\n\n\tThe third feature by the Mexican writer-director (following 2021’s Venice-premiered “The Hole in the Fence”)  is another timely entry in the rapidly expanding canon of contemporary migrant portraits, though its specific tale is an unusual one — following as it does a makeshift family of Haitian outsiders attempting to integrate with a group of Mexican logging-industry laborers, and finding themselves marginalized by a community already on the outskirts of society. But it’s a parallel strand tracing the mass southward migration of monarch butterflies, crossing paths with this human family’s long journey north, that lends del Paso’s lyrical film a distinguishing shimmer of what might be called natural magical realism — the sense of a world far larger than our immediate experience of it.\n\t\n\n\tA standout in this year’s Panorama program at Berlin, “The Garden We Dreamed” is a small-scale production that nonetheless has real cinematic heft — in large part thanks to striking widescreen lensing by Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s regular DP Gökhan Tiryaki — and urgent human stakes that steadily vault this intimate, delicately sensory film into heart-in-mouth survival thriller territory. That escalation ought to turn the heads of arthouse distributors, while a long trail of further festival invitations is a given.\n\n\tEsther (a superb Nehemie Bastien) and Junior (Faustin Pierre) have not been together for that long, but they’ve evidently weathered enough hardship together on their arduous trek from Haiti through North America to have bonded them into a tight, mutually dependent unit. Esther’s two young daughters, Flor (Kimaëlle Holly Preville) and Aisha (Rut Aicha Pierre Nelson), already regard Junior as a father figure, and when he takes a grueling, high-risk job with a crew of illegal loggers led by shady boss Toño (Carlos Esquivel), it’s with the responsibilities of a family breadwinner weighing down on him. \n\n\tThe cacophonous construction in the film opening scene is of a ramshackle company hut for Junior’s whole family to live in — nothing more than a one-room shed, it’s cramped and unequal to the coming rainy season. Esther does her best to make it a home with colorful fabrics and freshly picked wildflowers, while the girls delight in the paradisiacal playground on their doorstep: Every shade of green is present and correct in Tiryaki’s lush compositions. But hazards hover both in the turning weather, a threat in particular to Flor’s severe asthma, and in Junior’s work environment, where he’s treated with racist disregard by his co-workers, while locals incensed by the company’s violation of the forest make vengeful overtures.\n\n\tThere’s real, sweat-inducing tension to scenes where Esther, alone at home with her children, is encircled and menaced by mobs of men preying on the easiest of targets. But others, where relentless, shelter-soaking rain is the aggressor, are no less vivid and terrifying, amplified by the rattling, percussive intensity of extraordinary sound design by Lena Esquenazi, Valeria Mancheva and Antonio Porem. Well supported by her two marvelously unaffected onscreen children, Bastien anchors such passages with palpable physical exhaustion and staunch but visibly fraying maternal resolve: a remarkable performance that invites audiences to step outside mere sympathy into shared, visceral anxiety.\n\t\n\n\tIf “The Garden We Dreamed” flirts with outright horror at its most perilous points, however, it’s neither exploitative nor a punishing downer, as del Paso maintains a perspective in line with the characters’ ruggedly hopeful, die-hard persistence, and a pure, exhilarated thrill in their natural surroundings. The fiery flutter of the swarming monarchs might beautify many a frame, but their presence isn’t merely decorative, as the film ponders how multiple species move through a world increasingly hostile to them, and survive the journey — though not without occasional, peaceful pauses to take in the scenery, surveying it at once for danger and wonder.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBAFTA Film Awards host Alan Cumming thanked the audience for their understanding on Sunday night after a number of outbursts from Tourette’s campaigner John Davidson during the show.\n\n\tDavidson, who is the inspiration for BAFTA-nominated movie “I Swear,” was diagnosed with the syndrome at the age of 25. His symptoms, which first began when he was 12, include tics and uncontrollable outbursts, often involving cursing.\n\n\n\tA number of outbursts could be heard throughout the BAFTA ceremony, including “shut the fuck up” being shouted during an introductory speech from BAFTA chair Sara Putt and “fuck you” when the directors of “Arco,” which won the BAFTA for best children’s and family film, accepted their award. During another outburst, the audience inside the BAFTAs heard Davidson shout the n-word when Michael B, Jordan and Delroy Lindo presented the award for best visual effects to “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”\n\t\n\n\t“You may have noticed some strong language in the background. This can be part of how Tourette’s syndrome shows up for some people as the film explores that experience,” Cumming told the audience, which included the Prince and Princess of Wales. “Thanks for your understanding and helping create a respectful space for everyone.”\n\n\tLater on in the ceremony Cumming made a further statement, saying: “Tourette’s Syndrome is a disability and the tics you’ve heard tonight are involuntary, which means the person who has Tourette’s Syndrome has no control over their language. We apologize if you are offended tonight.”\n\n\tThe outbursts could not be heard in the second half of the ceremony when Davidson appeared to have left the room. Variety understands he left of his own accord and was not asked to leave by BAFTA. A source told Variety earlier that Davidson was an “invited guest” and under no circumstances would he be asked to leave the ceremony. BAFTA did not respond to comment regarding whether the outbursts would be cut for the broadcast, which goes out with a two-hour delay on BBC One in the U.K. (In the U.S. and other international territories it goes out on BritBox International).\n\t\n\n\tBefore the ceremony began the floor manager also introduced Davidson to the audience, saying: “I’d like to welcome John Davidson MBE from one of our nominated films ‘I Swear’. John has Tourette’s Syndrome so please be aware you might hear some involuntary noises or movements during the ceremony.”\n\n\t“I Swear” features “Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” star Robert Aramayo as Davidson, following him at the age of 25 after his appearance in a seminal BBC documentary “John’s Not Mad,” which first introduced Tourette’s to a wider audience.\n\n\tThe film, which was directed, written, and produced by Kirk Jones, is up for five BAFTAs, including best leading actor for Aramayo, best supporting actor for his co-star Peter Mullan, best original screenplay and casting (the latter which it won). The film is also competing for outstanding British film.\n\n\tAramayo was also awarded BAFTA’s EE Rising Star award on Sunday night. Collecting his award, Aramayo said: “John Davidson is the most remarkable man I ever met. He’s so forthcoming with education and he believes there should be still so much more we need to learn about Tourette’s. Especially, I just want to say for people who are living with Tourette’s it’s the buzz around them that helped define what their experience is so, to quote the film, ‘They need support and understanding.'”\n\n\tSince Davidson went public with his diagnosis four decades ago, a number of public figures have revealed they suffer from the syndrome, for which there is no cure. They include Billie Eilish and Lewis Capaldi.\n\n\tIn a statement to Variety before the ceremony, Emma McNally, CEO of support and research charity Tourettes Action, said: “We’ve had a huge amount of people reach out to us about ‘I Swear,’ both individuals living with Tourette’s syndrome and those with no previous connection to the condition. All have been deeply affected by the film. It’s clearly created a huge public reaction.”\n\n\t“Viewers have told us that seeing John’s real story portrayed with such depth and honesty has given them a far more accurate understanding of what Tourette’s can look like and how it affects the individual – this is something they had given little thought to previously.”\n\n\t“We’re hopeful that as more people talk openly and more accurate on‑screen representations appear, we’ll continue moving toward a more inclusive and understanding society for everyone living with Tourette’s.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tEJAE, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami, the singers behind Huntr/x from “KPop Demon Hunters,” got the BAFTA Film Awards crowd grooving with a performance of their megahit “Golden.” It was the first performance of the hit track outside the U.S., proving the film’s global domination — despite being ineligible for a BAFTA Award.\n\n\tChase Infiniti, who has made it clear she’s a big fan of Huntr/x, was seen singing along from the crowd as EJAE, Nuna and Ami — dressed for the occasion in shades of red, brown and gold — performed the track alongside a slew of dancers. The performance started out with EJAE crooning solo on stage before Nuna and Ami appeared from different locations around the venue, working the audience as they made their way to the BAFTA stage.\n\t\n\n\tThough the trio were invited to perform, BAFTA ruled that “KPop Demon Hunters” did not meet the eligibility criteria for the Film Awards — despite a formal appeal by Netflix — specifically because it did not have a qualifying theatrical release. Netflix tried to argue that the film’s later theatrical run, two months after it debuted on the streamer, should count under BAFTAs “exceptional circumstances” clause, which will sometimes make allowances for distribution models such as event cinema releases. However, BAFTA rejected this argument.\n\n\n\tStill, the organizers were clearly happy to sprinkle a little Huntr/x stardust into the ceremony — much to the attendees’ delight.\n\n\tDespite not being eligible for a BAFTA, the film is on track to storm the Academy Awards where it is nominated for original song and animated feature film. On Saturday it dominated the Annie Awards, taking home 10 gongs including for best feature.\n",

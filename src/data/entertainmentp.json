    "body": "\n\tMoroccan talent will step into the spotlight at this year’s EFM, crowning a generational growth spurt for the country’s film industry.\n\n\tLong prized for its stability, infrastructure and natural locations, Morocco’s production sector shifted into a new gear in 2018 with the introduction of a tax credit, now capped at 30%. That same year, the Marrakech Film Festival launched the Atlas Workshops, an industry platform designed to connect emerging regional filmmakers with sales agents and co-production partners on home turf.\n\t\n\n\tAtlas’ remit has expanded exponentially since, supporting more than 150 projects and helping launch filmmakers such as Asmae El Moudir, whose 2023 hybrid documentary “The Mother of All Lies” became one of the most internationally acclaimed Moroccan films to date. At the same time, foreign productions have surged, with titles like Oliver Laxe’s “Sirāt” and Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey” transforming Morocco’s landscapes into immersive big screen worlds. In 2025 alone, the Moroccan Cinematographic Center (CCM) backed 23 foreign features through the incentive scheme, generating more than $165 million in local investment.\n\n\n\tDomestic production has risen in parallel, with the industry delivering 54 films last year — a dramatic leap from the turn of the millennium, when output had dipped to just four features.\n\n\tNow firmly established as both a premier service destination and a rising industry hub, Morocco is looking outward, fielding major delegations at platforms such as Venice Production Bridge and this year’s EFM to connect a new generation of filmmakers directly to the global market.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFilms like “The Odyssey” and “Sirāt” have taken advantage of Moroccan locations — and a 30% tax rebate.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“We are a country of stories,” says CCM director Mohammed Reda Benjelloun. “But the challenge today is scale. It’s no longer enough for one, two, or three films a year to travel internationally; we need five or 10. Developing a project is one thing; pitching it on the international stage is another. A strong narrative and a solid dossier are essential, but convincing European producers and international funding bodies to invest is real work. That’s why it’s so important for our filmmakers to be here, confronting the market and understanding how it truly operates.”\n\n\tReflecting those ambitions, the CCM will bring 10 producers — chosen from more than 75 applicants and vetted for gender parity and international potential — to this year’s Berlin market. The EFM will also host a promo screening of Laila Marrakchi’s “Strawberries,” fresh off its top post-production prize at the Atlas Workshops and poised to become one of the year’s most high-profile Moroccan features.\n\n\tAt home, a parallel push is underway, with film schools and professional training programs expanding, alongside renewed efforts to engage the Moroccan diaspora. As Benjelloun puts it, the goal is to “internationalize the production process, but not the stories.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“K-1”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSelected for the Berlinale Series Market, the police procedural “K-1” offers one example. Showrunner Khadija Alami designed the project to meet international standards — introducing the showrunner model itself — while handing off episodic duties to acclaimed feature directors Yasmine Benkiran, Nour-Eddine Lakhmari and Hicham Ayouch to lend each episode genuine cinematic heft.\n\n\t“It’s a new way of working in Morocco, and I think it’s going to spark something,” says Alami, who runs production services outfit K-Films and has long served as a bridge to Hollywood.\n\n\tAfter a century of foreign shoots in the country, few ever stopped to ask what Moroccan directors might bring to the table. “K-1” was her answer. “We already have the skills, the crews, the vision. Now we’re proving it — on our own terms, and at the same level as British, French or American creators.” \n\t\n\n\t“We can’t just make small, insular projects for ourselves,” adds producer Lamia Chraibi. “We often talk about American soft power, but today every filmmaker in our region feels that if we don’t tell our own stories, Orientalist narratives will persist. We need to work carefully and with skill to challenge global audiences and get our stories out as widely as possible.” \n\n\tIndeed, Alami and Chraibi are part of a wave repositioning Morocco’s film industry as an international creative partner, not merely a service provider. Not coincidentally, both are among the 10 producers heading to Berlin for the Moroccan Producers Spotlight.\n\n\t“There’s a big difference between a producer who simply manages funds and a creative producer who shapes the story, the script, and the strategy for financing and distribution,” Chraibi explains. “Until recently, that role barely existed in Morocco, yet this global understanding is essential in a country where budgets are limited.”\n\n\tWhile developing co-productions through her Casablanca-based outfit LaProd — which helped launch Laxe with his 2016 Cannes Critics’ Week grand-prize-winning “Mimosas” — Chraibi has made an even broader impact as co-founder of the Tamayouz Foundation. Established in that pivotal year of 2018, the non-profit provides entry-level training for women in directing, screenwriting, production, and post-production, alongside financial support and mentorship.\n\n\tOver the past five years, roughly 100 filmmakers have passed through the foundation’s residencies, training programs, and professional workshops, supporting emerging talent looking to make the leap into features.\n\n\tAmong its alumni is producer Oumayma Zekri Ajarrai, who produced last year’s Cannes Critics’ Week short-film winner “L’mina,” and will also attend the Moroccan Producers Spotlight to help launch her Tamayouz-supported feature project “Road to Limbo,” directed by Ayoub Lahnoud.\n\n\t“We focus on nurturing careers,” Chraibi says. “We maintain a community-based approach, supporting alumni over the long term — whether they need legal advice or strategic guidance. With the active support of the CCM, our goal is to push the system forward: to renew it, open it up, and make room for an industry that is already transforming.”\n\t\n\n\tFilmmaker Alaa Eddine Aljem — another of the 10 producers selected for Berlin — embodies that generational shift. Two decades ago, Aljem was among the first graduates of Marrakech’s ESAV film school, co-founded by Martin Scorsese. Today, he runs that same institution, welcoming roughly 40 new students each year into bachelor’s and master’s programs offering specialized tracks in cinematography, sound, editing, directing and screenwriting.\n\n\tThe growth of Morocco’s film sector has not only created more opportunities locally but has also attracted an increasing number of international applicants — a trend reflected directly in Aljem’s own projects.\n\n\tAlongside his academic duties, he continues to work steadily as a producer and director, diligently integrating ESAV alumni into key technical roles on films such as “Out of School” — a feature documentary directed by Hot Docs winner Hind Bensari, which recently claimed two prizes at Final Cut in Venice — and his upcoming feature “El Dorado,” slated to shoot later this year.\n\n\tLooking ahead, Aljem wants to expand ESAV’s graphic design, VFX and animation facilities — echoing the CCM’s goal of turning Morocco into a full-service production and post-production hub. “Today, ESAV is operating at roughly half its potential,” he explains. “There’s still room to grow, both in scale and scope. Over the next five years, the goal is steady development, aligned with what festivals, the CCM, and other institutions are doing. We’re living through a pivotal period for Moroccan cinema; the sector is changing as the industry takes greater structure.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tNine years after winning the Silver Bear for “Félicité,” French director Alain Gomis is returning to the Berlin International Film Festival with “DA",
    "body": "\n\tNine years after winning the Silver Bear for “Félicité,” French director Alain Gomis is returning to the Berlin International Film Festival with “DAO,” his most personal work yet — a three-hour family saga set between France and West Africa.\n\n\tThe helmer, who has Bissau-Guinean and Senegalese origins, wrote and directed the film which stars a mix of actors and newcomers, leading with Katy Correa and D’Johé Kouadio as a mother-and-daughter duo. The story follows them across two ceremonies, a wedding in Paris and funeral in Guinea-Bissau.\n\t\n\n\tIn his very first interview discussing the film, Gomis tells Variety that “DAO” did not emerge from a single idea but from a life experience. \n\n\n\tThe initial spark dates back to 2018, after attending his father’s funeral ceremony in Guinea-Bissau, which was a powerful experience for him. “I remember thinking: I’d like to make a film out of this. I didn’t know how,” he says. “It’s a film made of small things you add together, that weave into a mosaic. It grew in size and volume through tiny details.”\n\n\tShot in just 20 days — 10 in France and 10 in Guinea-Bissau — the production was swift, unlike the process. True to Gomis’ method, almost none of the dialogue was scripted in advance, with scenes shaped in the present tense during the shooting which took place on location, between France and a village in Guinea-Bissau. “It’s the intentions that matter. What is happening inside the character at that moment? What’s at stake?” explains Gomis, who founded the Yennenga Centre, comprising cinema school, in Senegal back in 2018. Ultimately, Gomis ended up with 200 hours of footage. “We had a five-hour film,” he says with a laugh. The editing process became an exercise in preservation: keeping what he calls “the real function of participation” – meaning the collective energy — while sculpting it into a three-hour narrative.Improvisation proved central to his process and gave the film a sort of hybrid nature, blending fiction with bits of documentary. Non-professional Katy Correa, he says, possesses “an intelligence of performance,” instinctively grasping emotional stakes. Gomis also brought well-established actors, like Samir Guesmi and Thomas Ngijol, into the fold.\n\t\n\n\tAlthough “DAO” is more intimate than political, Gomis sublty addresses timely themes, such as the impact of colonization, displacement and inherited trauma. \n\n\t“Each family carries its secrets. Here, there’s something about people who were formed through an absence, whose image of themselves needs repairing,” he says. Referring to the generational gap between those who stayed in Africa, and those who emigrated, he explains that “some things weren’t explored, weren’t spoken. You grow up with the feeling that something is missing.”\n\n\tAs in “Felicité, which revolved around a bar singer in Kinshasa who embarks on a journey across the Congolese capital to raise money for her son’s surgery, the female perspective remains central in “DAO.”\n\n\tIn “DAO,” Corréa plays a single mother who is marrying her daughter and starts reconsidering her own future. Gomis says he was inspired to explore “DAO”‘s story from a female perspective and tackle once again motherhood. \n\n\tHe says the film “first came to me through a female character,” because that’s “something I’ve seen in our families — women who refused themselves another life before their child was grown — as if they didn’t have the right to think about themselves first.”\n\n\tLike these women he’s known, the character played by Corréa has “postponed another life for herself until her child was older,” says Gomis. \n\n\tAnother similarity with Gomis’ previous work, such as “Felicity” and “Rewind & Play,” music, and particularly jazz, provided the tonal backbone for “DAO.” The score alternates between traditional ceremonial sounds and some jazz pieces by saxophonist Keïta Janota and Gaspard Gomis which frame the narration.\n\n\t“It gave the film its flesh,” he says. “There’s something tender, nostalgic. A beautiful way of looking at the world.”\n\n\tSet to premiere in competition on Feb. 14, “DAO” is a France-Senegal-Guinea-Bissau co-production with celebrated producer Sylvie Pialat at Les Films du Worso (“Timbuktu”) and SRAB Films (“Les Miserables”), alongside Senegalese co-producers Yennenga Productions and Nafi Films, and Telecine Bissau Produções in Guinea-Bissau. The Party Film Sales is representing the film internationally. \n",

    "body": "\n\tA house in Nancy Guthrie‘s Arizona neighborhood is being investigated in connection to her disappearance, police said late Friday night. Nancy, the mother of “Today” co-anchor Savannah Guthrie, has been missing for nearly two weeks. \n\n\t“Law enforcement activity is underway at a residence near E Orange Grove Rd & N First Ave related to the Guthrie case,” the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement on X. “Because this is a joint investigation, at the request of the FBI — no additional information is currently available.”\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the New York Times, the house is in the Catalina Foothills neighborhood and just a short drive from Nancy’s residence and that of her older daughter, Annie, and her husband. A grey Range Rover is also being investigated at a nearby Culver’s, the Times reports, though it is unclear if it is in connection to Guthrie. Investigators photographed something inside of the car’s trunk and a tow truck has removed it from the scene.\n\n\n\tOn Thursday, the FBI revealed that it is raising the reward to $100,000 for information that helps locate Nancy Guthrie or leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for her disappearance.\n\n\tThe agency also shared additional identifying details about a potential kidnapper, describing the suspect as “a male standing approximately 5’9” to 5’10” tall with an average build. In the video, he is seen wearing a black 25-liter Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack,” according to a post on X from the Phoenix bureau of the FBI.\n\n\tEarlier that week, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department told ABC News that an individual had been taken into custody for questioning in connection with the case, and investigators were preparing to search a location tied to that individual. The person was later released. \n\t\n\n\tNancy Guthrie was reported missing on Feb. 1, and the Pima County Sheriff’s Department declared her disappearance a crime on Feb. 2. \n\n\t“We saw some things at the home that were concerning to us,” Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told reporters at the time. “We believe now, after we process that crime scene, that we do in fact have a crime scene, that we do in fact have a crime, and we’re asking for the community’s help.”\n\n\tSince her mother’s disappearance, Savannah Guthrie has posted several videos on social media addressing the kidnapper and asking the community to help with the search.\n\n\t“So I’m coming on just to ask you not just for your prayers, but no matter where you are — even if you’re far from Tuscon,” she said in a video message on Feb. 9. “If you see anything, if you hear anything, if there’s anything at all that seems strange to you — that you report to law enforcement. We are at an hour of desperation, and we need your help.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tChile’s much-lauded documentarian Maite Alberdi, after making her first fiction feature “In Her Place,” has returned to her roots with her latest opus, “A Child of My Own” (“Un hijo propio”).\n\n\tNot unlike her Oscar-nominated “The Mole Agent,” Alberdi toys with the docu-fiction hybrid format, but in “Child,” she also breaks the fourth wall in some key moments. \n\n\n\tWorld premiering at the Berlinale in a special presentation, “A Child of My Own” follows Alejandra who, pressured by her new husband and his family, decides to fake her pregnancy in order to please them. What starts as a simple lie grows into a complex charade, which she must sustain for months before her spouse and his kin. As the deception consumes her, Alejandra crosses an irreversible line. \n\t\n\n\tAlberdi recalls that she met Alejandra while working on another project in Mexico. “When I heard her story, I found it very striking that a woman would pretend and simulate a pregnancy for such a long time. Truly, an extraordinary story, impossible to believe as fiction.”\n\n\n\t“It makes you ponder what would lead a woman to fake a pregnancy—what that choice did to her and how she was living in such a chauvinistic environment at the time.”\n\n\tExplaining what led to a docu-fiction format, Alberdi says: “When I first heard her story, I felt the best way to revisit that past was through staged scenes with actors, built from her testimony and point of view. That allowed us to enter the more traditional documentary space – interviews, observation, archival material. The two approaches intersect to accompany her over time, tracing a process that spans roughly 16 years of her life.”\n\t\n\n\t“I think what the film ultimately offers is perspective – the distance of time. Over the years, she’s been able to recognize her mistakes and understand them differently, and to see more clearly where she stands today.”\n\n\tProduced by Gato Grande for Netflix, “Child” was shot in Mexico with a professional cast led by Ana Celeste Montalvo Peña, Luisa Guzmán, Armando Espitia, Mayra Sérbulo, Casio Figueroa, Alejandro Porter, Mayra Batalla and Ángeles Cruz. \n\n\t“We were fortunate to work with outstanding Mexican actors. It was a real challenge for them, because they weren’t creating characters from scratch – they had to spend a lot of time speaking with the real people and building from them, since midway through the film we transition to those real protagonists. It became a beautiful exercise in observation and interpretation,” she recalls. \n\n\t“At first, I wanted non-professional actors, but I realized that what was required was far more complex: they had to embody people who actually exist. For that, you need truly great actors.”\n\n\tAbout the honor of world premiering in the Berlin Film Festival, Alberdi remarks: “Berlin is a wonderful festival for dialogue. The exchange with audiences is always deeply enriching. This is a film that sparks strong debate and meaningful conversation—discussions I’m very eager to have with both viewers and the press. Berlin is the perfect space for that.”\n\n\tJulián Loyola and Esteban Student, co-writers of Pablo Trapero’s “The Clan,” penned the script while Sandra Godinez (“Roma”), Carla González Vargas (Gato Grande CEO) and Maximiliano Sanguine (“Libre de reir”) produced the film.\n\n\t“It has been quite a multicultural team, with Argentine screenwriters, an Argentine producer, a Chilean production designer and a Chilean cinematographer while the rest of the crew is Mexican.”\n\n\tAsked whether she leans towards the documentary format, she replies: “Ultimately, I prefer working with reality; it’s where my stories begin. The form—whether fiction or documentary—matters less to me. What I care about most is working with reality as a starting point.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Court of Arbitration for Sport has dismissed Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych’s appeal against his disqualification from the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics, upholding a ruling that barred him from competing over a helmet honoring victims of Russia’s invasion.\n\n\tCAS said Olympic neutrality rules “reasonably balance” athletes’ freedom of expression with the need to maintain political neutrality at the Games, effectively ending Heraskevych’s attempt to be reinstated to competition.\n\t\n\n\tThe 27-year-old athlete had planned to race wearing what he described as a “helmet of memory,” featuring images of Ukrainian athletes and children killed during the war. Olympic authorities determined the display violated rules prohibiting political messaging during competition.\n\n\n\tThe International Olympic Committee had offered a compromise that would have allowed Heraskevych to display the helmet before and after the race and to wear a black armband while competing. He declined the proposal, maintaining the tribute was an act of remembrance rather than a political statement.\n\n\tThe International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation subsequently disqualified him after he continued wearing the helmet during training runs ahead of the event.\n\n\tWhile CAS upheld the competition ban, Olympic officials later restored Heraskevych’s accreditation, allowing him to remain at the Games in a non-competing capacity.\n\n\tThe case has drawn strong reactions beyond sport. Ukraine’s luge team staged a solidarity gesture during competition, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly praised the athlete following the ruling.\n\t\n\n\tHeraskevych previously drew international attention at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics when he held a “No War” sign after a race.\n\n\tThe dispute has renewed debate over the International Olympic Committee’s strict neutrality rules, as global conflicts increasingly intersect with athletes’ efforts to use the Olympic stage to highlight humanitarian and political issues.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe breakout success of LGBTQ+ dating series “The Boyfriend” has turbocharged Netflix‘s Japanese unscripted slate, with Ota Dai, who oversees the streamer’s Japan unscripted division, crediting a deliberate rejection of conventional reality television formulas for its unexpected international resonance.\n\n\tThe expanded slate now includes renewed series “Badly In Love,” which hit No. 8 on Netflix’s Global Top 10 Non-English Series list, along with new launches “Final Draft,” Japan’s first physical survival series, and “Offline Love,” which removes phones entirely from the dating equation.\n\t\n\n\t“What I’m most conscious of is not building in big game-like elements or a strong overarching plot,” Ota tells Variety. “Instead, once I provide a basic setting, I try to simply watch over the participants so they can spend their time there as they are.”\n\n\n\tThat philosophy extends across titles as different as “Badly In Love,” which focuses on yankii (delinquent youth) culture, and “Love Village,” now in its second season with participants aged 35 to 60 — the first Japanese reality show centered on that demographic. Ota attributes the approach to avoiding what he calls the variety-show convention of turning people into consumable character symbols.\n\n\t“Once you stick labels like ‘the butt of the jokes,’ ‘the hopeless one,’ or ‘the love master’ onto someone, their story becomes fixed there,” Ota explains. “I deliberately chose people who are difficult to label — those with multilayered identities in terms of age, gender, background and romantic experience — and followed them over a long period.”\n\t\n\n\tThe strategy has proven particularly effective with international audiences. “Badly In Love” sparked major social media buzz within hours of its release and landed in top 10 rankings across Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan despite featuring extremely local subculture. “What surprised me was that overseas viewers who presumably aren’t familiar with Japan’s yankii subculture got excited about the characters’ emotions at almost exactly the same points as Japanese viewers did,” Ota says. “I was able to confirm that moments like an outlaw or someone on the margins of society sincerely facing their own past or clumsy ways of expressing affection are received as something quite universal.”\n\n\tThe breakthrough validates Netflix’s “Local for Local, then Global” philosophy. Rather than diluting specific cultural elements, Ota maintains that preserving local intensity while creating accessible entry points through subtitles and editing allows authentic engagement. “There’s no need to dilute or overemphasize a specific culture or character to make a global version,” he says. “Keeping the local intensity as it is and portraying things honestly – while carefully creating an accessible entry point – can give you confidence that viewers around the world will willingly dive in.”\n\n\t“The Boyfriend” Season 2, which doubled the cohabitation period from one to two months in a Hokkaido setting, demonstrated how extended timelines create space for relationship complexity that first seasons can’t capture. “We were able to see developments that did not occur in Season 1, such as someone whose one romance ends and then moves on to a new love, and couples who form and then graduate partway through,” Ota says.\n\n\tCast members reflected on how the extended format reshaped their understanding of relationships. Bomi, 23, who entered seeking his first boyfriend, found his idealized notions challenged. “I was only looking at the bright side of love,” he says. “In the process of nourishing love, you might fight or maybe have relationship issues – those are the parts that I have never even imagined. Love is not just about loving each other. That itself is not able to carry on the relationship.”\n\n\tFor Izaya, 32, confronting past relationship patterns proved transformative. His previous long-term relationship taught hard lessons about communication. “We tried to hide things. It became such a relationship that we hid some of the things we were not able to say,” he reflects. “Going forward, I want to be able to face and communicate with a partner and be able to say things that I really think.”\n\t\n\n\tStudio host Durian Lollobrigida, who returned alongside Megumi, Yoshimi Tokui, Chiaki Horan and Thelma Aoyama, describes the role as translator and viewer representative. “Basically, we are like one of the viewers, and we just follow and enjoy the drama of the boys,” Durian explains. The extended timeline created opportunities for more nuanced portrayal. “If the time is longer, there’s more time in facing each other, spending time with each other. There’s more intricate depiction or portrayal of people’s feelings compared to Season 1.”\n\n\tOta remains focused on balancing emotional authenticity with participant wellbeing. “We make it a rule not to introduce game-like elements or impose any forced overarching structure that would go against the participants’ genuine emotions,” he says. “The only way to create an authentic reality show is to have people participate just as they are, with their true selves, and simply keep filming them for as long as possible.”\n\n\tMental health support operates throughout production, with aftercare explained in advance. “I believe that delivering emotionally moving experiences to viewers and protecting the lives and wellbeing of the cast members are two things that must always be considered together,” Ota emphasizes.\n\n\tLooking ahead, Durian hopes for expanded representation in future seasons. “I want more feminine, ladylike type of person – we call it onē in Japanese – but also different body shapes or people with different backgrounds. I hope that there’s more breadth to that.”\n\n\tOta measures success across multiple dimensions beyond viewership data. “What I personally focus on is: How many people watched it all the way to the end and came to love it? And after it’s over, how many people does the work continue to impact, and how deeply?” he says. “Even if the numbers aren’t huge, if we receive reactions from viewers saying that the show nourished their life in some way, or that their heart was saved by it, I feel that is also a form of success.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tÚrsula Corberó, the breakout star of Netflix’s “Money Heist,” is set to topline Spanish horror maestro Jaume Balagueró’s next feature, “There’s Someone in the Garden” (“Hay alguien en el jardín”), produced by Kowalski Films, one of the Spanish companies pitching at the Spanish Producers Showcase at Berlin’s European Film Market on Saturday.\n\n\tA second key move from the showcase comes from Madrid-based Vértigo Films: its Spain-Portugal co-production “Broken Waters” (“Aguas rotas”), made with Portugal’s Caracol Protagonista, has been picked up for international sales by Paris-based Indie Sales.\n\t\n\n\tIn all, at the Feb. 14 Showcase, five Spanish independents will pitch projects in development to international co-producers and industry decision-makers. The session forms part of Spain’s wider EFM program, backed by the Ministry of Culture via its ICAA film institute and Spain’s export and investment body ICEX. \n\n\n\tFilm Factory, Movistar Plus+ and Disney+ on board\n\n\tBasque outfit Kowalski Films, represented at the showcase by producer Koldo Zuazua, is bringing “There’s Someone in the Garden,” a Spanish co-production with Minoria Absoluta and Feelgood Media.\n\n\tIn development and slated to shoot in November, the project already has key partners in place: Film Factory has boarded international sales, Buena Vista International is set for Spanish theatrical distribution and Spanish SVOD rights are taken by Movistar Plus+ and Disney+. ICAA support is also confirmed.\n\n\tBalagueró (“[REC]” franchise, “Sleep Tight”) directs from a screenplay by Guillem Clua (“Smiley,” “God’s Crooked Lines”), with Corberó starring. \n\t\n\n\tDescribed as a combination of ghost cinema and crime thriller, the film begins with a haunted-house setup — a 10-year-old becomes convinced her family’s new home is haunted as strange events mount — before the plot delivers a significant twist. \n\n\t“At the EFM, we are primarily seeking a strong European co-production partners to collaborate on our upcoming slate of feature films and series,” Kowalski’s Zuazua said. “We are interested in companies that share our vision of combining commercial potential with artistic quality, and that can bring international financing, creative input, and market access to our projects.”\n\n\tIndie Sales, Portugal’s Caracol team with Vértigo\n\n\tAmaya Izquierdo, head of production at Madrid-based Vértigo Films, will introduce “Broken Waters” (“Aguas rotas”), the first feature from director Patxi Isasti, co-written by Isasti alongside Vértigo founder Andrés Martín.\n\n\tVértigo leads as a main producer, with Spain’s Treboamedia and Portugal’s Caracol Protagonista as co-producers. Indie Sales has taken international rights as the project moves through advanced development toward a third quarter 2026 shoot.\n\n\tThe financing is already defined. In Spain, the film has won  ICAA selective funding, with public broadcaster RTVE and paybox Movistar Plus+ attached.\n\n\tSet in a northern Galicia coastal town, the story follows Marisa, who, after losing her granddaughter, becomes consumed by revenge — hunting for a gun and the man responsible — as grief, guilt and long-buried secrets pull her family into a tightening spiral of violence.\n\n\t“I am drawn to character-driven stories that explore social and personal complexity, featuring multi-layered protagonists navigating moral, social, or emotional conflicts,” Vértigo’s Izquierdo said.\n\n\t“I look for projects that, while rooted in local realities, resonate internationally by reflecting universal aspects of human experience,” she added.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Broken Waters’ – Vértigo Films \n\t\n\n\n\n\tHistorical figures in a Costa-Brava-set project\n\n\tBarcelona-based Link-Up Productions, founded by executive producer Teresa Enrich, is pitching “The Beach of Paris” (“La playa de París”), a development-stage feature co-produced with Andorra’s WAPO Films and written by Roger Danés, Alfred Pérez and Roger Menduiña. Producers are Jordi Cerqueda, Fernando Romero and Enrich.\n\t\n\n\tThe project uses Mas de Castell, a Costa Brava villa, as its anchor point, moving across four eras: 1930s nights tied to Sert and Dalí, Ava Gardner-era 1950s glamour, a 1999 party that revives old echoes, and a 2025 journalist digging for what the building still holds. \n\n\tThe film was selected for the Cinespaña Co-Production Forum in Toulouse in 2024.\n\n\t“One of the project’s main hooks is that it weaves real historical figures — such as Dalí, Ava Gardner, and Sinatra — into a fictional narrative (without being a biopic). This makes it highly engaging for audiences and gives it strong cultural value,” Enrich said.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Beach of Paris – Link-Up Productions\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA horror film project rooted in generational trauma\n\n\tBarcelona-based Japónica Films, led by producer Gerard Rodríguez and Laura Fernández-Hormigo, brings “La Madriguera,” directed by Frank Lucas and currently at late development/financing with a production target of 2027.\n\n\tA horror film with a strong body horror dimension, it follows Alex who returns to the town of his childhood after learning his estranged father has attempted suicide. He begins to feel stalked by presences connected to the same oppressive forces that pushed his father toward madness. \n\n\t“I am particularly drawn to films and series that play with genre while engaging with contemporary themes and the complexities of today’s world; projects that combine strong concepts, audience appeal and creative risk,” Rodríguez said.\n\n\tDevelopment credits take in the project’s passage through EAVE Producers Workshop, Atlántida Talents Lab Award, Abycine Lanza and Acció Producció.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Madriguera – Japónica Films\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAdult animation film co-produced with Colombia\n\n\tRounding out the Showcase is Alicante-based Jaibo Films with “Disposable” (“Desechable”), an adult animation feature directed by Colombia’s Carlos Gómez-Salamanca and produced by Jaibo with Bogotá’s Nocroma Estudio.\n\n\tAt production stage, scheduled from Sept. 1, 2024 through Feb. 28, 2026, “Disposable” is produced by Miguel Molina, Adán Aliaga and Juan Pablo Gómez.\n\n\tThe premise of the film is a social-pressure thriller rendered in animation: a powerful drug sparks a violent uprising of the homeless aimed at overturning established power, built around the loaded Bogotá slur “disposables” for people living on the streets.\n\t\n\n\tThe director frames the film as an immersion into the mind of one such figure — shaped by social discontent, inequality and state repression — who triggers revolt to avenge the death of his dog.\n\n\tOn financing, the project carries a multi-territory public-support footprint including Spain’s ICAA, Valencia’s IVC, Ibermedia, Colombia’s Proimágenes and FDC plus Madrid’s ECAM Incubator, and Cinespaña Lab Award at Toulouse in France. \n\n\tJaibo was created in 2006, following the success of Adán Aliaga’s “My Grandmother’s House.”  \n\n\t“We want to continue supporting national and international creative talent with a unique vision and create links through co-productions with Europe and Latin America that will help us grow within the international independent audiovisual network,” Jaibo’s Molina said.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDisposable – Jaibo Films\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCo-Production Opportunities, AI Challenges\n\n\tSpain’s agenda at Berlin’s EFM also includes sessions on co-production opportunities with Spain and on the broader challenges the industry faces as AI technologies accelerate across production and distribution.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA mousy teenager with curly hair and a face full of acne, Minnie is the farthest thing from cool — even if the actress who plays her, Katherine Mallen Kupferer, has charisma to spare. Minnie is practically invisible to most of the students at North Little Rock High School, which is what makes her friendship with Callie — the most popular girl in her class — so special. They’ve been close since before such things mattered, and Callie’s the sort of person who always made sure that Minnie was included.\n\t\n\n\tSo what does life without her best friend look like? And how does one balance that loss with what everyone else is feeling, from Callie’s shellshocked mother (Sophie Okonedo, giving the first Oscar-worthy performance of 2026) to those classmates who claim Callie as their own? The latest modestly scaled, sensitively crafted drama from directors Alex Thompson and Kelly O’Sullivan, “Mouse” is a movie without a clever marketing hook, but it’s intelligent, perceptive and true. As in their two previous heartfelt Middle American indies, “Saint Frances” and “Ghostlight,” the couple draw from their own lives and the world around them.  \n\n\n\tHere, they turn their attention south, to O’Sullivan’s home state of Arkansas, setting the film in 2002 — a time before cell phones and social media rewired how we engage with one another. Back then, the world was still skeptical of therapy, and teens consumed pop culture on shiny silver platters. (Minnie meets her first love behind the counter of the local CD/DVD store.) In Minnie’s class, Callie’s the born performer, destined for a life on stage or screen. Everyone else saves dancing for prom or the senior cabaret show — which Callie’s churchy friend Cara (Audrey Grace Marshall) suggests they dedicate to her memory.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s not enough to be sad — we have to do something,” Cara self-righteously announces, commandeering theater class from exasperated teacher Mr. Murdaugh (David Hyde Pierce). There’s a certain amount of entitlement that comes with kids of Cara’s age and class, which O’Sullivan’s script smartly treats as the subtext to a film that might otherwise be compared to “Ordinary People” or “Waves,” in which tragedy nudges an introverted adolescent out from under the shadow of their “most likely to succeed” sibling.  \n\n\t“Mouse” deals with similar themes, but a lot of other territory as well, including a “Lady Bird”-like exploration of how working-class teenagers like Minnie might feel ashamed having a mom like Barbara (Tara Mallen), who’s brash and oblivious, but doing her best. Without Callie around, the chasm between Minnie — who holds an after-school job and eats microwaved junk at home — and Callie’s other friends feels wider than ever.  \n\n\tMinnie takes it out on her mom, a veterinary assistant juggling a house full of rescue animals and a random toddler she’s all but adopted (the boy needs a home, and her heart is bigger than Minnie appreciates). When Callie was there, she spent as much time at possible at her upscale friend’s house, and now that she’s gone, Minnie gravitates to her mother, Helen (Okonedo), an elegant, once-radiant woman — now drained by grief — with a posh British accent.\n\n\tHelen’s grateful for the company, taking Minnie under her wing, and spoiling her with home-cooked meals and private singing lessons. Together, they decide that Minnie can sing a showtune from “A Chorus Line” during the senior cabaret, and though Minnie insists she has no talent, there’s comfort for both parties in Helen treating Minnie the way she would her own daughter. (The movie’s tender piano score is so comforting, we could be eavesdropping on Helen playing to herself late one night.)\n\n\tIn a more conventional film, Helen might unlock some hidden potential in the socially introverted teen, which would then be revealed at the big show. But “Mouse” is grounded not just in reality, but relatability. While not a comedy, it’s full of humor and subtle, wince-worthy moments that feel instantly familiar: the time you made a fool of yourself in front of the entire class, or the harshest thing you ever said to a parent and now wish you could take back.\n\t\n\n\tWhere Minnie grew up not knowing her father, Callie has the kind of dad who stocks the fridge with beers and pretends not to notice if any go missing — which might seem ideal to some, until you consider his daughter’s fate. But “Mouse” isn’t meant as a lecture on such things. Tragedies befall teens all the time, and in this case, the focus is on moving forward, as represented by Minnie’s tentative flirtation with a girl named Kat (Iman Vellani).  \n\n\tA mix of actors of wildly different experience levels, the ensemble meshes together beautifully, reflecting the idea that none of these characters knows quite how to navigate the situation. They’re all fumbling, convincingly so, from the adults to the kids. Pierce has two powerful scenes, including a key moment in which he asks his students to express how they feel in public and in private, silently observing how Minnie differs from her peers. And while Kupferer feels like a discovery — one the directors made on “Ghostlight,” though given a much larger role here — it’s Okonedo and Mallen as the film’s competing maternal forces who impress most.  While the film may seem like a love letter to a lost friend, it’s fitting that it’s actually dedicated to O’Sullivan’s late mother, Eileen, appreciation for whom illuminates every frame. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIndia’s Sippy Films is rolling out its legacy IPs including “Sholay” and “Shaan” across animation, microdramas, gaming and merchandising in a multi-format strategy backed by investor Kuberans Tech Ventures, custodian Shehzad Sippy and Kuberans director Jeet Wagh tell Variety.\n\n\tThe approach draws from Western character IP models and Japanese anime’s cross-platform playbook, targeting younger audiences while the studio prepares to announce a new feature film partnership by mid-2026.\n\t\n\n\tSippy outlines a strategy that positions films as the primary driver while supplementing with multiple revenue streams and audience touchpoints.\n\n\n\t“With specifically with character IP, how one approaches development and roll out of these things is it’s almost like a wheel of monetization that you and planning that you have to have,” Sippy says. “Films, live action content, really drive the character IP business more than anything else. So you need to have those things coming out, but then it should be supplemented with these other touch points and being able to constantly engage with your fan base. So whether that’s animation or gaming, or merchandise, or there’s new forms of fan interaction with Web3 platforms… all of this is being looked at [including] stage plays.”\n\n\tThe strategy draws from established Western models. “You can look at the classic Disney model, they have this huge portfolio of character IP, and this is how they strategically plan and develop and roll these things out,” Sippy says. “That’s the kind of approach we want to take, which we felt has been lacking from an Indian studio perspective.”\n\t\n\n\tSippy emphasizes the revenue diversification potential. “Character led IP lends itself well to other streams of revenue, also not just that one weekend at the box office,” he said. “They lend themselves to gaming, merchandising, various forms of licensing that can occur after the fact. And the fact is, we haven’t had a lot of homegrown IPs out of India. I think you could say Green Gold Animation [the company behind globally successful IP “Chhota Bheem’] is the main one that has been able to do it successfully.”\n\n\tWagh stresses that the evolving market requires flexible content strategies across theatrical, streaming and emerging formats including microdramas.\n\n\t“Everything might not be a film or full fledged series. It can be smaller content pieces also that can go throughout the world, throughout cross streams, cross platforms, microdramas,” Wagh says. “You never know where what fits what. It’s very content driven – whatever fits a piece, because we can’t have a plan for that. Wherever the content is, how the content is developed, and how, what is the go to market strategy for it, that’s where we have to sit on that platform.”\n\n\tWagh contrasts the approach with traditional theatrical planning. “That traditional thinking of ‘We are making an IP, I think this will do these many theater days, in these many territories,’ that is, I feel, personally, has gone out of the window where so many parallel streams of platforms are actually coming across now,” he says.\n\n\tSippy adds: “We’re in 2026. We have a new young audience in this country. We have to rethink the approach. We’re trying to create stuff that will resonate with young people and hopefully for generations to come.”\n\n\t“The goal is, having taken over the company now and taking it forward in a new direction, is to build that with all the legacy IPs we have, to build those worlds out in the form of new content, specifically film and animation,” Sippy says. “These IPs have a lot of appeal as they are, but we want to set them up for the future generations, and have them have that cross generational appeal across formats, whether it be film or animation.”\n\n\tDevelopment work spans origin stories, new character introductions and world expansion. “The goal is to try to set these up as franchises moving forward,” Sippy says.\n\t\n\n\tThe studio has been in active development for over a year. “We’ve been heavily involved in development of several of these IPs over the last year or so, and we’re getting close to now making formal announcements of some of the new content that will be rolling out,” Sippy says. “In terms of the new content, I think towards mid this year there’ll be an announcement that comes out regarding a partnership we’re working on at the moment for the new feature length film we’re planning to start shooting later this year.”\n\n\tSippy points to the Japanese anime industry as a blueprint for character IP exploitation, drawing on early career experience working with Gen Fukunaga, who brought “Dragon Ball Z” to U.S. audiences.\n\n\t“The reason anime resonates across the world with young people is that even though culturally, the storylines are steeped in Japanese culture, the themes are universal,” Sippy says. “If you look at some of the IP and the legacy IP we have, the underlying storylines are all universal.”\n\n\tSippy notes Fukunaga’s merchandising success. “The first year he made no money on ‘Dragon Ball Z’ from a broadcast perspective, but he made $50 million in merchandising, controlling the merchandising,” he says. “The quality of the animation, and the way they keep audiences interested in the craft they’ve been able to put together. That’s the secret sauce.”\n\n\tThe studio plans to incorporate manga-style content development. “A lot of Japanese anime, it’s manga that drives the content first, first the manga comes out, and then the content comes post that,” Sippy says. “In the same way, if you look at DC and Marvel comics, comics books led to their business moving forward and being able to tell those stories in different formats.”\n\n\tWagh emphasizes the importance of multiple consumer touchpoints beyond film releases, citing the Japanese anime industry’s approach to merchandising and brand integration.\n\n\t“Creating touch points, what Japanese anime actually does, is for younger [audiences],” Wagh said. “A lot of social media is also curated towards the anime. As a young generation, when you’re watching something on TV and you’re creating more touch points across your life, be it books, be it in schools, be it on social media, you tend to actually live them rather than just watch them. That’s where the craze and fandom starts in the character IP or anime business as well.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile the studio’s library consists of properties that are 50 years old or slightly less, Sippy emphasizes the focus on younger demographics while maintaining family-friendly content.\n\n\t“There is a disconnect between an older audience and the audience today. So that’s specifically what we’re trying to bridge with the way we’re approaching the rollout of our content,” Sippy says. “The main focus is the youth of today and the youth moving forward.”\n\n\tThe approach aims to create multi-generational appeal. “We hope to emulate that family friendly content that we’re creating so where a mother, father, grandparent can come watch the film along with their kids and grandkids, and there’s something there for everybody,” Sippy says. “Not only through how we develop the content, but the modes of consumption, whether it’s animation or Web3. We want to take a holistic approach to how we are planning all these things.”\n\n\tThe strategy follows the Film Heritage Foundation’s restoration of “Sholay” after discovering 500 cans of original material and 500 cans of “Shaan” material in Technicolor’s storage facility in London. The restored “Sholay” is in discussions for limited theatrical releases through Criterion in North America and BFI in the U.K., with a Criterion Blu-ray edition and streaming release also planned.\n",

    "body": "\n\tArtificial intelligence is increasingly being used by Indian screenwriters in their work even as long-standing concerns around pay, credit and professional recognition continue to dominate sentiment, according to “The Right Draft: 2026,” a new industry research report released by talent agency Tulsea and media insights firm Ormax Media.\n\n\tBased on a nationwide survey of 254 professional screenwriters, the second edition of the study finds that AI adoption is already widespread across age groups. Forty-one percent of respondents said they use AI tools at least sometimes in their writing process, while half said they do not view AI as a threat to their careers.\n\t\n\n\tAt the same time, the report highlights growing concern about the impact of AI on timelines and perceptions of creativity. Nearly seven in ten respondents said the presence of AI reduces the perceived value of human creativity in the eyes of producers, and 50% said producers now expect faster turnaround times because they assume writers will use AI.\n\n\n\tThree-quarters of surveyed screenwriters said AI can be helpful at certain stages of the writing process, particularly during early development such as pitches, references and first drafts. More than 70% said writers who use AI do not feel comfortable revealing it publicly.\n\n\t“With the second edition of ‘The Right Draft,’ we wanted to deepen the industry’s understanding of writers’ on-ground experiences – across pay, credit, feedback, nurturing structures, and now AI,” said Chaitanya Hegde, co-founder of Tulsea Media. “The data points to some meaningful shifts and some stubborn constants. Our hope is that the report helps move conversations from perception to process, and towards more consistent, fair, and creator-friendly systems.”\n\t\n\n\tThose “stubborn constants” are reflected most sharply in compensation trends, which have deteriorated compared with findings in 2023. Nearly 74% of respondents said they do not feel they are paid fairly for their work, up from 63% three years ago. More than half said payments are not made in a timely manner, and almost four in five reported having to constantly follow up to receive money that is contractually due.\n\n\tPerformance-linked compensation remains rare. Two-thirds of respondents said they have never been offered profit-sharing or bonuses tied to box office or viewership, and have never asked for such structures.\n\n\tCredit and visibility continue to be another major pain point. Over half of screenwriters disagreed with the statement that writers are given fair credit for their work, while nearly two-thirds said there is no defined industry standard for crediting that producers and platforms consistently follow. More than half said they do not receive equal credit when co-writing with directors, and over 60% reported similar experiences when collaborating with senior writers.\n\n\tTheatrical cinema remains the format where scripts are perceived to carry the least weight. Only 6% of respondents said producers value scripts over stars in theatrical films, compared with 83% who said stars dominate. While streaming and television fare better, the perceived value of scripts on streaming platforms has declined since 2023.\n\n\tThe report also points to a decline in access to mentorship and support structures. Just 19% of respondents said they have access to good mentors, down from 30% in 2023, while 76% believe the industry does not provide adequate infrastructure to help writers develop their craft. Fewer than four in ten said they have access to effective grievance-redressal mechanisms.\n\n\t“Writers sit at the core of the storytelling ecosystem, yet too many friction points remain structural rather than episodic,” said Shailesh Kapoor, founder-CEO of Ormax Media. “By measuring writer sentiment across key dimensions, ‘The Right Draft’ is intended to be a practical input into how the industry can build stronger alignment, accountability, and creative ownership.”\n\n\tOrganised across seven sections – The Right Pay, The Right Credit, The Right Feedback, The Right Value, The Right Nurturing, The Right Tools and The Right Environment – “The Right Draft: 2026” expands on the 2023 edition by incorporating emerging formats such as microdramas and examining the impact of AI on writing workflows alongside ongoing structural challenges around compensation, credit and support for screenwriters.\n",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tNew projects from Canadian filmmaker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/xavier-dolan/\">Xavier Dolan</a> (“Mommy,” “It’s Only the End of the World”), Marvel and Disney concept artist Andrew Leung (“Mulan,” “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”) and French animator and director Eléa Gobbe-Mévellec (“The Swallows of Kabul”) are among the projects taking center-stage at this year’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mia-market/\">MIA Market</a>, which runs Oct. 6 – 10 in Rome.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore than 100 international TV series and formats, animation, feature films and documentaries in various stages of the production cycle will be pitched to hundreds of top execs this week in the Eternal City, underscoring the growing influence of the pre-Mipcom boutique event.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking to <em>Variety</em> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/rome-mia-market-chief-titles-dont-disappear-1236534715/\">on the eve</a> of this year’s edition, MIA head Gaia Tridente stressed the “meticulous work” done by her curatorial team to identify market-ready projects and “bring together producers, distributors and content providers and help relevant projects get out there.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“We generate deals and therefore serve as a real industry cornerstone,” Tridente said. “Titles that participate at MIA don’t disappear into thin air, most of them eventually find their way [into the market]. This is also thanks to a team that clearly curates and develops projects and a program that is aligned with market needs and demands.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHeadlining the MIA Market’s influential drama strand, which features 15 projects from 12 countries, is the French series “Rage,” directed by Xavier Dolan, which charts the rise of the skinhead movement in 1980s Paris. Created by Anaïs Topla and Mathieu Gouny and produced by Manon Robillot and Laetitia Quentin de Gromard’s Paris-based Madelon Production, the show is being pitched as a “bold, stylish series that can be experienced on many levels” while blending “spectacular action with emotional depth.” The six-episode series, currently in early development, will be written by Topla, Gouny and Marc Herpoux.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOther drama standouts include “Writers Retreat,” produced by the U.K.’s BlackBox Multimedia (“The Ex-Wife,” “Home Education”) and written and created by Lindsay Shapero (“Winter Palace”), which follows the investigation into the mysterious disappearance of a guest at a luxurious retreat in Spain. From Dublin-based “Irish Blood” producers Deadpan Pictures and Canadian shingle Shaftesbury Films comes “The Roaring Banshees,” an adaptation of the hit play by John Morton and Peter McGann that follows an all-female band of Irish rebels who find themselves pursuing a life of crime in 1920s Chicago. </p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, “Red Light Empire,” from Dutch production group Lemming Film, tells the story of a Holocaust orphan determined to build an empire in Amsterdam’s red-light district. The series is directed by Tim Oliehoek and written by Michael Leendertse and Sarah Offringa. Greek production heavyweight Faliro House will also be in Rome to present “Aïnta!,” a rags-to-riches tale about a second-generation Greek Ghanaian immigrant chasing his dreams to become a rap star. The series is created by Kevin Zans Ansong — better known as the Greek Ghanaian rapper Negros Tou Moria — along with Stavros Pamballis and Andreas Zoupanos Kritikos.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmong the seven feature films and nine series selected to pitch in MIA’s animation strand is “Ancient China of Mars,” a sci-fi dramedy series from L.A.-based filmmaker and animator Andrew Leung, the concept artist behind Disney’s “Mulan” and Marvel’s “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.” Produced by Snarky Elephant Productions, the show is an offbeat yet timely exploration of the immigrant experience, told through the lens of a Chinese family running a failing restaurant on a space station orbiting Mars. The series offers a pointed metaphor for how “the American dream these days is feeling more and more like a fantasy,” according to Leung.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother anticipated title is “The Northern Star,” from French animator and director Eléa Gobbe-Mévellec, whose debut feature “The Swallows of Kabul” premiered in the Cannes Film Festival’s Un Certain Regard section in 2019. Created with Milada Tesitelova, the film follows a 17-year-old North Korean refugee who escapes to Seoul, offering a “political, artistic and deeply human story of a young woman caught between two Koreas,” according to Gobbe-Mévellec.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOther titles in a loaded animation lineup include “Argonauts,” an adult, sci-fi, action-adventure series created by Simon Duric, the co-creator, co-writer and executive producer of the Netflix series “The Innocents,” starring Guy Pearce. Produced by Echo Lake Entertainment and Northern Ireland outfit ALT Animation, the series offers a futuristic spin on the Greek myth of Jason and the Argonauts. Also being pitched this week is “The Rejects,” a 10-episode series created by John McEwan-Whyte and Julie Bower, which follows a team of history’s most overlooked sidekicks as they try to save the world. It’s produced by “Rick & Morty” producer Rick Mischel’s Emmy-winning Artists Animation Studio and McEwan-Whyte’s Scottish animation studio Bonnie and Braw.</p>\n<p>\n\tStandouts among the 12 feature films taking the stage in Rome include “Fugue,” from award-winning Irish filmmaker Ivan Kavanaugh (“Never Grow Old”) and Dublin-based genre production outfit Fantastic Films, which tells a haunting tale of possession, sacrifice and eternal return told through the lens of a piano tuner forced to take shelter in a remote house during a brutal storm. From Egyptian powerhouse Film Clinic comes “Draft Zero,” a feature debut by Ahmed El Zoghby, which follows a struggling filmmaker in Cairo who begins documenting a refugee family’s story to save his crumbling life. </p>\n<p>\n\tAnother first-time director, Norway’s Tatiana Delaunay, will present “Summer of Jesus,” which follows a guilt-ridden environmental activist’s return to her Italian roots, where she grapples with love, grief and cultural clashes. The film is produced by Norwegian heavyweight Thomas Robsahm, who’s credited for more than 50 films, including Joachim Trier’s double Oscar-nominated “The Worst Person in the World.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDocumentary highlights at the MIA Market include “The Lawyer,” from director Maciej Bochniak and Polish production powerhouse Madants (“High Life,” “The Silent Twins”), a feature film about a brilliant young Kenyan lawyer who finds the tables turned when he comes under investigation, and “Building Venice,” a documentary series about the hidden side of the iconic Italian city, from director Katia Bernardi and the team behind the Warner Bros. Discovery action-doc series “Extreme Mountain Carpenters.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAwards will be handed out at the MIA Market’s conclusion on Oct. 10, among them the Sony Pictures Television Award, which will be presented for the very first time this year. The award will honor the best drama project selected from the MIA Drama Co-production Market & Pitching Forum, as chosen by a jury from Sony Pictures Television.</p>\n<p>\n\tRome’s MIA Market runs Oct. 6 – 10.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tDublin-based “Irish Blood” producers <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/deadpan-pictures/\">Deadpan Pictures</a> and Canadian shingle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/shaftesbury-films/\">Shaftesbury Films</a> are teaming up again on “The Roaring Banshees,” an adaptation of the hit play by John Morton and Peter McGann that follows an all-female band of Irish rebels who find themselves pursuing a life of crime in 1920s Chicago. The series is among the projects selected to take part in Rome’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mia-market/\">MIA Market</a>, which runs Oct. 6 – 10.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Roaring Banshees” begins in Ireland, in the aftermath of a failed assassination attempt on a powerful political kingpin by the secret rebel unit known as the Banshees. Forced to escape on an American-bound ship, the members are separated, only to reunite in Chicago in the frigid winter of 1923. Here, they plan to lie low and stay out of trouble until their former wartime commander negotiates their safe passage home — a plan that soon goes awry, making their return to Ireland unlikely. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tStruggling to survive in Prohibition Chicago, with the police on their tail and an Irish assassin hot on their tracks, the women resort to crime, selling bootleg liquor to the Irish mob. But as their business grows, they attract trouble from brutal gangsters, corrupt cops and their own increasingly unpredictable natures, in what the series’ creators describe as “a classic rise-and-fall gangster story of immigrants staking their claim in the land of hope and glory.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking to <em>Variety</em> ahead of the MIA Market, Deadpan Pictures co-founder Paul Donovan referenced series such as “Peaky Blinders” and “Babylon Berlin” when describing the appeal of “The Roaring Banshees.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s a cinematic, visual, high-end, dramatic, classic gangster saga — but also entertaining and fun,” he said. “We don’t take ourselves too seriously here. We’re out to entertain.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDonovan recalled his first encounter with the play on which the series is based during a theater festival in Dublin. “It was a packed-out show, and it just had the audience laughing and crying and hooting and shouting and roaring on the characters,” he said. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe producer, who had previously collaborated with Morton on the Victorian-era Acorn TV period drama “Dead Still,” praised the writer’s work — “It always inherently had humor and entertainment in it,” he said — and immediately recognized the source material’s potential for adaptation.</p>\n<p>\n\t“So much of the action necessarily happened off-stage. It was explosions and shootouts and all sorts of great action sequences that they gave the impression of happening, but you didn’t actually see them,” he said. After the show, Donovan met with Morton and McGann to make his pitch, insisting those action set pieces would look “fantastic” on screen and telling the duo, “Let’s go make a big, brave, ambitious piece of fun, cinematic TV.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe series follows the rebel unit as they struggle to make a fresh start in America, “out of their comfort zone” and far from the cause they’d spent their lives committed to, according to Donovan. </p>\n<p>\n\t“They’re a crack squad who fought in the war of independence in Ireland, and then they ended up on the wrong side in the Civil War thereafter. So they’re quite fired up by a cause, and the justification for the kind of violence and mayhem that they engage in,” said the producer. “But things have changed, because they’re not fighting this just cause anymore. They’re no longer soldiers. They veer towards more of a gangster lifestyle, so it’s more of gray moral world that they engage in.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“That kind of muddy area,” he added, “is fertile ground for drama.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Roaring Banshees” is written by Morton and McGann and directed by Neasa Hardiman, whose credits include the Netflix series “Untamed” and “Jessica Jones,” and the Hulu drama “We Were the Lucky Ones.” The 8 x 60’ series will be shot in Ireland and Hamilton, Ontario, which Donovan described as a convincing stand-in for 1920s Chicago.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDeadpan Pictures and Toronto-based production outfit Shaftesbury Films previously teamed up on “Irish Blood,” Acorn TV’s mystery-drama series starring Alicia Silverstone that was recently renewed for a second season.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Between the two of us, we can bring up to 45% of the finance to the table,” said Donovan. “There’s an established relationship there, and the Irish-Canadian co-production does work really well between the different funding sources. For MIA, our challenge now is to get partners on board for the rest of the funding.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRome’s MIA Market runs Oct. 6 – 10.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/new-york-film-festival/\">New York Film Festival</a> audiences will get the first look at Timothée Chalamet in Josh Safdie’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/marty-supreme/\">Marty Supreme</a>.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/a24/\">A24</a> film is one of the year’s most anticipated, but it remained one of the few remaining awards contenders to be unveiled. That changed Monday evening, when the indie studio gave “Marty Supreme” a surprise world premiere at Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall. The setting makes sense given that Safdie is a quintessential Big Apple filmmaker, Chalamet is a native son and the film was shot in the five boroughs. Both the star and the director are in attendance.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe screening was confirmed after the audience had filled the seats for the festival’s secret screening and Safdie took the stage.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I hate surprises too,” Safdie said to the crowd. The secret screening was a tight deadline for the director, as he added, “I finished it at 2 a.m. yesterday. … You’re the first audience to see this film.”</p>\n<p>\n\tChalamet then joined his director onstage to introduce the film, disclosing a personal connection to the evening. The star shared that he went to high school down the street from Alice Tully, so “it’s fucking awesome” to premiere at NYFF.</p>\n<p>\n\tBased on the “Marty Supreme” trailer, Chalamet appears to be playing an aspiring ping-pong champion. Gwyneth Paltrow, who co-stars in the film, previously said she plays the wife of a rival professional who has an affair with Chalamet. “I mean, we have a lot of sex in this movie,” Paltrow teased. “There’s a lot — <em>a lot.</em>”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe cast also includes Odessa A’Zion, Kevin O’Leary, Tyler Okonma, Abel Ferrara and Fran Drescher. Safdie co-wrote the script with Ronald Bronstein.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film cost $70 million, making it A24’s most expensive movie ever. The premiere comes as the studio’s “The Smashing Machine,” which was directed by Josh Safdie’s brother Benny, is failing to connect at the box office despite good reviews. The Safdies previously collaborated as co-directors on “Good Times” and “Uncut Gems.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe New York Film Festival has held premieres for several awards contenders, including Noah Baumbach’s “Jay Kelly,” Luca Guadagnino’s “After the Hunt,” Kathryn Bigelow’s “A House of Dynamite,” and Scott Cooper’s “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.” </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/timothee-chalamet-2/\">Timothée Chalamet</a>‘s ping pong epic “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/marty-supreme/\">Marty Supreme</a>” has finally been unveiled following a surprise world premiere at the New York Film Festival, and members of the film press in attendance are calling  Josh Safdie’s latest an “awe-inspiring cinematic tour-de-force”  featuring a “performance of a lifetime” from Chalamet. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety<strong> </strong></em>co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh shared a glowing review of the film on X, citing many of its perceived inspirations.<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/RaminSetoodeh/status/1975399075961765953\"> He wrote</a>, “‘Marty Supreme’ is ‘Uncut Gems’ meets ‘The Catcher in the Rye’ meets ‘Jerry Maguire,’ carried by Timothée Chalamet’s best performance yet. I loved it so much.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDiscussing Film chairman Diego Andaluz echoed the praise. He called “Marty Supreme” Safdie’s “best film yet,” giving particular praise to Chalamet in the starring role. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“A kinetic odyssey that plays like a deranged cross between ‘Catch Me If You Can’ & ‘Uncut Gems,'” he <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/thediegoandaluz/status/1975398985973072030\">wrote on X</a>. “Timothée Chalamet delivers the performance of a lifetime in this unforgettable, awe-inspiring cinematic tour-de-force that fires on all cylinders.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSenior Hollywood Reporter writer David Canfield deemed Chalamet’s turn as ping-pong legend Marty Mauser a “career-best performance.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“‘Marty Supreme’: Major, exhilarating filmmaking from Josh Safdie,” <a href=\"https://x.com/davidcanfield97/status/1975400498330280226\" target=\"_blank\">he shared on X.</a> “Timothée Chalamet’s career-best performance—he was born to play this guy—with a tremendous Odessa A’Zion leading a superb supporting cast. It’s a wow.”</p>\n<p>\n\tEntertainment journalist David Crow was also full of praise for “Marty Supreme.” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/dcrowsnest/status/1975399994745139256?s=46&t=wVt7JHNDs9Z-Gz3aaij7kA\">He wrote on X</a>, “‘Marty Supreme’ is an absolute blast of adrenaline and the follow-up to ‘Uncut Gems’ we’ve been craving. Just as demented and tense, but drunk on the confidence of youth and the arrogance to believe that talent and charm is enough. As a piece of cinema it sure as hell is.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDirected by Josh Safdie, who previously co-directed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/a24/\">A24</a> darlings “Good Time” and “Uncut Gems” with his brother Benny Safdie, “Marty Supreme” stars Chalamet as a ping pong phenom whose life takes complicated turns as he pursues a championship overseas. The supporting cast includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Odessa A’zion, Kevin O’Leary, Tyler the Creator, Abel Ferrara and Fran Drescher.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe short but tantalizing synopsis for the movie from A24 reads: “Marty Mauser, a young man with a dream no one respects, goes to hell and back in pursuit of greatness.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Marty Supreme” is A24’s big Christmas release and is reportedly one of their priciest original movies to date. The film has been making headlines for quite some time as Chalamet and Paltrow were photographed passionately kissing while filming a scene for the movie last year. Paltrow went on to tell <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/gwyneth-paltrow-2025-interview\">Vanity Fair</a> that her character has “a lot of sex” with Chalamet’s character in the movie, and they told the film’s intimacy coordinator to “step back a little” during production.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We said, ‘I think we’re good. You can step a little bit back,’ ” Paltrow added. “I don’t know how it is for kids who are starting out, but…if someone is like, ‘Okay, and then he’s going to put his hand <em>here</em>,’  I would feel, as an artist, very stifled by that.”</p>\n<p>\n\tA24 will open “Marty Supreme” in theaters Dec. 25. Check out more reactions below. </p>\n<p>\n\t“‘MARTY SUPREME’ is a sprawling and electrifying sports epic bursting with vitality from the first frame to the last. Josh Safdie delivers a masterful slice of organized chaos on a larger scale he’s ever worked with before, propelling us through Marty’s relentless quest to prove to everyone he’s the best ping pong player in the world. Timothée Chalamet, speaking a mile a minute with a hyperactive mind and unshakable confidence, throws himself into the role with total commitment, emotionally and physically, crescendoing in a climatic moment that had the audience standing on their feet and cheering.” – <strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/NextBestPicture/status/1975403841433538922\">Matt Neglia (@NextBestPicture)</a></strong></p>\n<p>\n\t“#MartySupreme is the best film of the year. Like oh my God. All the signature Safdie manic energy perfectly infused with the GENERATIONAL CHARISMA of the prince who is promised. Chalamet’s Cody Rhodes WrestleMania 40 performance. iykyk. I LOVE MAJOR MOTION PICTURES.” – <strong><a href=\"https://x.com/LiamTCrowley/status/1975408152708313096\" target=\"_blank\">Liam T. Crowley (@LiamTCrowley)</a></strong>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“‘Marty Supreme’ is a pure delight. Josh Safdie takes us on a chaotic, sprawling globetrot to break down the swaggering hubris of a ping-pong prodigy who can’t being insufferable. It’s remarkable how well this works. Any doubts that Timothée Chalamet is a movie superstar are dead.” – <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/blewis1103/status/1975408839458758898\"><strong>Brandon Lewis (@blewis1103) </strong></a></p>\n<p>\n\t“A24’s Marty Supreme is the secret screening at the NYFF. Josh Safdie going solo delivers a wild rush of nonstop adrenaline much like Uncut Gems; Timothée Chalamet’s no-holds-barred performance could be his Wolf of Wall Street. He’ll be nominated for sure.” – <strong><a href=\"https://x.com/akstanwyck/status/1975410755869512131\" target=\"_blank\">Anne Thompson (@akstanwyck)</a></strong></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tNot gonna lie, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift/\">Taylor Swift</a>’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/taylor-swift-the-tonight-show-starring-jimmy-fallon-1236529286/\">interview with Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show” </a><em>broadcast</em> Monday evening was on the lite side — at one point they talked at length about bread. However, the expanded interview on the show’s website contains some actual news. </p>\n<p>\n\tDuring one of Fallon’s trademark games that he plays with guests, Swift was asked to say which of five rumors he’d found online were true, and the first was that she’d declined an offer to be the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/super-bowl/\">Super Bowl</a>‘s Halftime performer because she would not own rights to the performance footage. On the broadcast, she makes a face but is not seen saying anything about the issue.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, in the expanded version of the interview posted on the show’s social media and <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, she speaks at length about why she’s not performing at the big game, as had been rumored before <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/bad-bunny-to-perform-2026-super-bowl-halftime-show-1236533627/\">Bad Bunny was officially announced</a> as the 2026 halftime entertainer.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter denying with a flat “No” that footage rights were the reason she declined to perform, Swift explained that her management had only received unspecific questions about it from Roc Nation, which programs the Super Bowl’s entertainment, rather than a formal offer. She added that regardless of whether or not an offer was official, she’d be too concerned about her fiancé, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, to even think about performing in the middle of the Super Bowl (which does not necessarily mean she<em> presumes</em> that he or the Chiefs will be in the game: Halftime performers are announced too early in the season to know which two teams will be playing).\n\t</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking of Roc Nation, which is led by Jay-Z, she said, “Jay-Z has always been very good to me — our [business] teams are really close. They sometimes will call and say, ‘How does she feel about… <em>[she murmurs something vague meaning ‘whatever’].</em> And that’s not, like, an <em>official</em> offer or a conference-room conversation, more ‘How does she feel about it in general?’</p>\n<p>\n\t“And we’re always able to tell him the truth, which is that I am in love with a guy who does <em>that</em> sport on <em>that</em> actual field,” she explained. “Like, [professional football] is violent chess. That is gladiators without swords. That is <em>dangerous.</em> I am, [for] the whole season, <em>locked in</em> on what that man is doing on the field. Can you imagine if he’s out there every single week, putting his life on the line, doing this very dangerous, very high-pressure, high-intensity sport, and I’m like <em>[she puts on a ditzy voice and face],</em> ‘I wonder what my choreo should be? I think we should do two verses of “Shake It Up,” into “Blank Space,” into “Cruel Summer,” that would be great!’”</p>\n<p>\n\tShe laughed before adding, “This has nothing to do with Travis — he would love for me to do it. But I’m just too locked in.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSo — Swifties will have to wait for a Super Bowl Halftime performance… until further notice.</p>\n</div>",

He then introduced the film’s cast — including Chalamet, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/gwyneth-paltrow/\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>, Tyler Okonma and Odessa A’zion — along with his co-writer, Ronald Bronstein.</p>\n<p>\n\tOkonma — known professionally as Tyler, the Creator — praised Safdie following the introductions.

And this man is so good, that I trusted him and said, ‘Anything you need. I don’t want to read this script. I will show up and be there,’” Okonma said of Safdie. “Because I trust this man. And the way that he curated and handled every detail. And the team — working with y’all, it was so wonderful.”</p>\n<p>\n\tGesturing toward the balcony, Okonma turned to Safdie and said, “I got emotional up there because you gave me a chance, so I thank you.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Marty Supreme” opens in theaters on Dec. 25.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe four-part series “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/red-alert/\">Red Alert</a>,” a scripted account of the terror attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, gains its power from the absence of context. As conceived by writer, director and co-creator Lior Chefetz (“The Stronghold”), the story eschews a bird’s-eye view of Hamas militants’ incursion from the Gaza Strip, the IDF’s counteroffensive or the broader history of a conflict now well into its eighth decade. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is never mentioned; neither is Hamas commander Yahya Sinwar, the attacks’ mastermind. (Even the word “Palestinian” doesn’t appear in the scripts.) Instead, the main characters of “Red Alert” are ordinary people — kibbutzniks, cops and kindergarten teachers blindsided by a horrifying onslaught of violence. We experience the day as they do, almost in real time.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it’s precisely the context of “Red Alert” that makes the show noteworthy, especially to stateside viewers who can stream the show on Paramount+. Parent company Paramount Skydance announced the series’ acquisition <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/paramount-red-alert-series-hamas-attack-israel-1236525993/\">with a statement</a> from newly installed CEO David Ellison, who praised “Red Alert” as “critical” and lauded its “harrowing precision.” (Another high-profile figure in American entertainment, “Pulp Fiction” producer Lawrence Bender, offered “Red Alert” his imprimatur as an executive producer.) It’s highly unusual for an executive at Ellison’s level to weigh in on a title his company didn’t even produce, like if Ted Sarandos urged his subscribers to check out AMC’s “Interview With the Vampire” on Netflix. Yet, 10 days prior, Ellison’s Paramount had made another atypical move, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/paramount-condemns-israeli-film-boycott-1236516511/\">proactively condemning</a> a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/stars-sign-pledge-complicit-israeli-film-companies-1236511010/\">boycott pledge</a> targeting certain Israeli film institutions — indicating a vested interest in the setting and subject of “Red Alert” on Ellison’s part. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThat same boycott indicates the other kind of context that viewers will bring to “Red Alert,” which is timed to the second anniversary of the nightmarish events it depicts. The intervening two years have only brought more pain and bloodshed throughout the region. Some of these open wounds are alluded to in the postscript of “Red Alert,” like the continued captivity of four dozen Israeli hostages in Gaza; some are not, like alleged <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/06/1164496\" target=\"_blank\">war crimes</a> and <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165517\" target=\"_blank\">widespread starvation</a> in the Strip on top of a death count <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/palestinian-death-toll-in-gaza-passes-64000-officials-say-after-ceasefire-talks-break-down\" target=\"_blank\">now estimated at over 60,000</a>. One could theoretically make a show just as wrenching as “Red Alert” about infants dying from lack of food, doctors forced to treat amputees without anesthetic and kids <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/02/middleeast/israeli-precision-guided-munition-maghazi-deaths-intl\" target=\"_blank\">killed by drone fire</a> while playing foosball. Unlike “Red Alert,” such a show probably couldn’t shoot on location due to the Strip’s <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-17/ty-article-magazine/.premium/satellite-data-shows-at-least-70-percent-of-gaza-buildings-leveled/00000198-12de-d9c7-af98-7adffc8f0000\" target=\"_blank\">near-total leveling</a>, and Ellison’s Paramount almost certainly wouldn’t touch it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs much as “Red Alert” attempts to cleave away everything but the immediate and subjective, it joins projects like the touring <a href=\"https://novaexhibition.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nova Exhibition</a> and the IDF-produced documentary <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_Witness_to_the_October_7th_Massacre\" target=\"_blank\">“Bearing Witness”</a> that offer their versions of a narrative that remains hotly contested — that of the origins, goals and sympathetic parties of a still-ongoing war. Ellison clearly understands the power and significance of elevating certain stories over others. There’s a reason he chose to distribute “Red Alert” and not, say, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/no-other-land/\">“No Other Land,”</a> the documentary about settler violence in the West Bank that never found a U.S. backer despite winning an Oscar earlier this year. That film was recently name-checked in an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/paramount-israel-boycott-employee-letter-1236536692/\">anonymous petition</a> from 30 Paramount employees accusing the company of “silencing Palestinian voices” while “actively and exclusively platform[ing] Israeli perspectives.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s thus the very elements that make “Red Alert” such an affecting watch that also make the show an inherently impossible effort. In the moment, Chefetz, co-creator Ruth Efroni and their collaborators can situate us firmly in the early hours of that terrible day, when holiday preparations for Simchat Torah were overtaken by questions of basic survival. But “Red Alert” arrives in the messy, disputed aftermath of Oct. 7 — a present tense viewers will inevitably return to, however vivid the show’s staging of the recent past.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tEach protagonist of “Red Alert” is based on a specific survivor, some invoked by name and some given a pseudonym at their request. Batsheva Yahalomi (Rotem Sela) and her husband Ohad (Miki Leon) belong to the former group. The Yahalomis and their three children initially retreat to the bomb shelter that’s a feature of many Israeli homes, especially those within rocket range of the Strip; it’s there they hear scary-but-typical overhead explosions joined by gunfire, signaling a much more immediate threat. (“Red Alert” takes its name from the automated warning message that plays on an eerie loop throughout.) Such indirect exposition drives home how disorienting Oct. 7 was at its onset, and in the absence of a more prompt and centralized response.</p>\n<p>\n\tElsewhere, another married couple, law enforcement officers Kobi (Israel Atias) and Nofar (Chen Amsalem), get separated while working separate shifts at the Nova Music Festival, the site of some of the day’s worst mass casualties. Educator Tali (Sara Vino) leaves her own shelter in search of her son Itamar (Nevo Katan), while Palestinian-Israeli Ayoub (Hisham Sulliman) and his family are ambushed in their minivan without regard for their heritage. By focusing on these particular people, “Red Alert” communicates the scale and trauma of Oct. 7 while avoiding some of the attacks’ most graphic elements, like sexual violence or the murder of children. Instead, Chefetz works to elevate the heroism of parents and partners who put their lives on the line to protect their loved ones, a kind of silver-lining spin on an otherwise awful moment in time.</p>\n<p>\n\tAyoub’s inclusion is an indication “Red Alert” does have its own political lens, a decidedly liberal one within the Israeli domestic spectrum, despite sticking closely to firsthand accounts. The agricultural worker’s face is the first we see onscreen, cradling his now-motherless infant son as Hamas fighters stage a last stand outside his improvised shelter. “Red Alert” is careful to highlight Ayoub’s difficulty securing an Israeli ID despite his long-term residence, a detail that becomes nerve-wrackingly relevant when IDF soldiers finally arrive on the scene only to hold him at gunpoint and demand he prove his loyalty. In a neat resolution, the troops quickly accept Ayoub’s crumpled receipts and school report cards. The scene is nonetheless a nod to the nuance that lies beyond the urgent, all-consuming panic of the unfolding crisis, and a queasy echo of the many such encounters that <em>don’t </em>end so amicably. The dialogue also often alludes to the army’s confoundingly delayed arrival, a pointed rebuke of a government — led by Netanyahu, who has yet to apologize for his role in the operational shortcomings — that failed in its duty to protect its citizens. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Red Alert” otherwise excels at capturing the confusion and occasional absurdity of the chaos victims were left to navigate for themselves. Without uniforms, it’s almost impossible to distinguish friend from foe, leading a group of Israelis to identify themselves to soldiers via group chat selfie: “Smile so we don’t look like Hamas!” In a strange and chilling encounter, Batsheva and her daughters come across two unarmed, English-speaking men who urge her to come with them, supposedly for her safety. (Arabic-speaking Gazans and Hebrew-speaking Israelis default to English as a linguistic middle ground.) She refuses, and the men simply wander off. We never learn exactly who they are or what became of them, the lack of resolution creating a subtler sense of unease than the overt atrocities.</p>\n<p>\n\tA disclaimer before each episode clarifies that “Red Alert” has fictionalized certain scenes. Like many scripted works inspired by true events, however, the series invokes its proximity to real life to prove its bona fides and maximize emotional impact. In a now-common device, the finale’s closing credits juxtapose actors with the people they’re portraying, a few with their faces pixelated for anonymity. Some video clips show the survivors on set, even conferring with the crew; others, in a discomfiting choice, play actual footage from Oct. 7 that Chefetz then faithfully recreated. As fraught as the reused recordings are, their overlap with the final product is the point. “Red Alert” weds itself so tightly to its source material that there’s little space left for anything else — or at least, that’s the intent. But the world beyond the show’s limited scope still looms, whether it’s deliberately invoked or not.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>All four episodes of “Red Alert” are will stream on Paramount+ on Oct. 7.</em></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tA failing Chinese restaurant on a crusty space station orbiting Mars is an unlikely setting to chase one’s dreams, even in a dystopian future where Earth is no longer an option. But that’s the launching pad for the animated sci-fi dramedy series “Ancient China of Mars,” which is taking part in Rome’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mia-market/\">MIA Market</a> running Oct. 6 – 10.</p>\n<p>\n\tCreated by Andrew Leung — the concept artist behind Disney’s “Mulan” and Marvel’s “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” — the series follows an Earthling Chinese family, the Lees, who are forced to escape to Mars. Leaving behind a climate change-stricken planet and a socioeconomic caste system that will never let them flourish, they blast off with hopes of pursuing their dreams on the Red Planet — only to find themselves stuck in purgatory on a space station that serves as a holding pen for stateless immigrants who are neither Earthling nor Martian. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThere, the Lees open a Chinese restaurant, which they hope will be the first step toward planting roots and carving a path towards middle-class life for their children. But nothing comes easy for migrants in a foreign land — especially on what the show’s creator describes as the “terraformed fascist paradise of Mars.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs with most flights of sci-fi fantasy, “Ancient China of Mars” has its roots in our increasingly dystopian present reality, with Leung invoking the term “enshittification” — first coined by the tech critic and author Cory Doctorow to describe the gradual degradation of the technologies that dominate our lives — to highlight how “everything is starting to suck.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The American dream these days is feeling more and more like a fantasy. It’s really becoming unattainable. And I was really trying to figure out a way to tell that story,” Leung told <em>Variety</em>. “What better way to tell it, but from the point of view of people who aren’t necessary able to partake in the greatness of that world but participate in it…through the immigrant experience?”</p>\n<p>\n\tRaised in smalltown Oregon, Leung recalled brushing off the racist taunts of classmates telling him to “go back to China” and escaping into the sanctuary of his parents’ restaurant. A sci-fi junky from an early age, he spent much of his childhood holed up with his sketchbook and bingeing on “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” a series that taught him to believe in “a future we could all belong in.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile “Ancient China of Mars” draws on his experiences as a child of the only Chinese American family in town, Leung said the show is “not about just the Chinese American story.” </p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s really about what’s it like to be stuck in this world where everything is obviously not created for you,” he said. “What if the tech world got everything they wanted? All the tech bros are like, ‘Now, we get to create this paradise.’ But when you get to the paradise, you’re like, ‘Oh, we don’t actually get to participate in this paradise. We’re just the Uber drivers of this paradise.’” </p>\n<p>\n\tWhile legions of overworked, underpaid workers in the American gig economy would undoubtedly relate, Leung argues there’s a more important hook to lure audiences to “Ancient China of Mars.” “I think it’ll be an awesome show to watch,” he said. “I think it’s hilarious.”</p>\n<p>\n\tNeal Ludevig, who produces for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/snarky-elephant-productions/\">Snarky Elephant Productions</a>, said he was instantly drawn to Leung’s vision for a series that — while perhaps not quite blasting into the stratosphere — would translate easily across borders.</p>\n<p>\n\t“He could have made this an American story about immigration and coming into that American dream, but he has re-appropriated it to make it much more universal,” Ludevig said. “Every country has immigrants. Every country has social class systems and people that are being displaced.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLeung is a product of the Snarky Elephant Incubator, a multi-year development program for emerging film industry creators whose work embodies the company’s mission of bringing more diverse content to the screen. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We like to say that we’re creating content that addresses the elephant in the room in a snarky way. Things about race or identity or climate or immigration or sexuality,” said Ludevig. “Our mission as a company is highlighting stories that we don’t see often enough on screen.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Ancient China of Mars” is among the 15-20 projects Snarky Elephant currently has in development, including Craig T. Williams’ “Black Boys Don’t Sew,” executive produced by Viola Davis and Julius Tennon. While Ludevig said the program is “effectively a pipeline for IP,” its core strength is in identifying promising creators, rather than individual projects, and making a long-term investment in those creators’ artistic visions.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It creates excitement. It creates momentum. It creates this kind of larger vision that gets people excited and feeling like they can also tell their stories,” he said. “The more stories that are out there where people can see themselves reflected in those stories, from different diasporas and backgrounds, the more people are going to continue to create those stories.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRome’s MIA Market runs Oct. 6 – 10.</p>\n</div>",

Well-established copyright law safeguards the rights of creators and applies here.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Friday, OpenAI Sam Altman said that an update to Sora 2 will soon give copyright holders “more granular control over generation of characters.” But he did not guarantee that copyrighted material would be scrubbed from the platform.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“There may be some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn’t, and getting our stack to work well will take some iteration,” he said in a blog post.</p>\n<p>\n\tSora 2 was introduced with the idea that creators could opt out if they object to having their characters or copyrighted work used on the site. Under copyright law, rightsholders can sue and obtain statutory damages for individual acts of infringement — regardless of whether the infringer offers an opt-out or not.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe MPA has made clear that the entertainment industry is not on board with the idea that an opt-out system absolves OpenAI from liability.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn June, Disney and Universal sued Midjourney for allowing its users to create infringing videos and still images on its site. Warner Bros. filed its own suit against Midjourney in September. Midjourney has fought back, arguing that AI training is “fair use” under copyright law, and that if users are infringing on copyrights, they are doing so in violation of the platform’s terms of service.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>On the closing day of the Paris fashion week, Chanel hosted the hotly anticipated debut collection of its new artistic director, Matthieu Blazy, who wowed guests with his resolutely modern take on the signature styles invented by Gabrielle Chanel.</p>\n<p>Among the 2300 guests who gathered inside the Grand Palais, a Parisian landmark decorated for the occasion as a colorful galaxy, were a flurry of stars from the film world, including Sofia Coppola, Tilda Swinton, Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman (who attended with her two daughters), Pedro Pascal, Margot Robbie, Carrie Coon and Marion Cotillard.</p>\n<p>Cruz, who is about to start filming Florian Zeller’s “Bunker” alongside her husband Javier Bardem, said she felt “emotional” seeing the enthusiastic reaction to Blazy’s first collection, noting that seeing that level of excitement at a Paris show is a rarity.</p>\n<p>“He took such a big risk and it completely works. To see everyone standing and giving him that ovation, it’s really hard to get that reaction in Paris in a Fashion Week, you don’t see that very often and he really deserves it,” said Cruz with teary eyes. “It’s completely the essence of the brand. He has respected that and he has also created a new thing,” she continued.</p>\n<p>Coppola was also taken by Blazy’s innovation.”It was so exciting because it looked like Chanel, but it looked like a new voice here, and his version of Chanel. It something new that I’ve never seen before,” she said, adding that her favorite look was “some beautiful silk T-shirt dresses” and “a black suit with little chameleons.”</p>\n<p>Equally ecstatic, Swinton said Blazy’s Spring/Summer collection felt like “an absolute breath of fresh air. It feels like the future. I’m very happy and very admiring of Matthieu and his team. It’s not easy to pull off a new evolution of this house, but he’s done it,” Swinton said. The actor, who was already wearing a look for the collection, said she enamored with “a number of styles” from Blazy’s creations. “The skirts, I’m wearing one of them right now. The skirts are sublime. They’re so comfortable and so flexible and on the hip, they’re so slouchy. You just feel completely 21st century. But at the same time, incredibly 1920s. They’re very Gabrielle Chanel herself,” continued Swinton, who has been an ambassador for the French fashion house for over a decade.</p>\n<p>Coon, meanwhile, was struck by how Blazy “took the DNA of Chanel, and he deconstructed it, and he put it back together, and he made astonishing clothes that everyone will want to wear. He turned it inside out, and he made it really sexy, and he made it really edgy. And I just feel like people will be clamoring to wear this collection,” predicted “The Gilded Age” and “White Lotus” star.</p>\n<p>Cotillard, who was recently in Los Angeles for the premiere of “The Morning Show” season 4 in which she stars alongside Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, was also lured by the sex appeal of Blazy’s collection. “I thought he went all out with the codes of femininity and masculinity, fluidity, and body movement, and that he made it his own, making the tweeds completely transparent, this mix of very masculine and very feminine,” Cotillard said.</p>\n<p>In his note of intent, Blazy set the tone for the show, saying that “Chanel is about love. The birth of modernity in fashion comes from a love story.” As such, Blazy, who joined Chanel from Bottega Veneta, chose to have the models walk the runaway to the beats of iconic love songs, from Connie Francis’ “I Was Such a Fool (to Fall in Love With You)” to Mc Solaar’s “Caroline.”</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t<h2>Sunday Rose Kidman Urban, Nicole Kidman and Faith Margaret Kidman</h2>\n\t<figure>\n\t\t<img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2239615259.jpg?w=200\" alt=\"PARIS, FRANCE - OCTOBER 06: (EDITORIAL USE ONLY - For Non-Editorial use please seek approval from Fashion House) (L-R) Sunday Rose Kidman Urban, Nicole Kidman and Faith Margaret Kidman-Urban attend the Chanel Womenswear Spring/Summer 2026 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on October 06, 2025 in Paris, France.

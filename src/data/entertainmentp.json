    "body": "\n\tSeries Mania Forum has designated the Republic of Korea as its inaugural Country of Honor, bringing a high-profile delegation of Korean entertainment companies to the industry event running March 24-26, in Lille, France.\n\n\tThe country has had a robust presence at the event in recent years. The Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA), the government organization coordinating promotion of Korea’s content sector, will lead a delegation of eight companies to the forum: Channel A Corporation, CJ ENM, EO Content Group, KBS Media, MBC (Munhwa Broadcasting Corp.), SLL Joongang, Studio S and Whynot Media. \n\t\n\n\tSeries Mania founder and general director Laurence Herszberg announced the Country of Honour designation on Tuesday, recognizing Korea’s contributions to global content development. The forum takes place during the broader Series Mania Festival, which runs March 20-27.\n\n\n\tThe initiative received support from France’s National Centre for Cinema and the Moving Image (CNC) and its president Gaëtan Bruel. KOCCA and CNC previously signed a memorandum of understanding during Series Mania 2024 committing to promote France-Korea exchanges and strengthen bilateral content industry growth.\n\n\tProgramming for the Korean focus will include a Coming Next from Korea session, Korean speakers participating in conference panels, a networking reception and additional events.\n\n\tThe designation coincides with the 140th anniversary of France-Korea diplomatic relations, dating to the 1886 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation. The honor reciprocates last year’s recognition of France at BroadCast Worldwide, Asia’s largest broadcast content marketing event, during its 25th edition in Seoul.\n\t\n\n\tKorea’s content market reached $43.1 billion in 2024, up 5.7% from $40.8 billion in 2023, maintaining its position as the eighth-largest content market globally. Korean content viewership in France has surged more than 200% year-over-year on Netflix, while also expanding through traditional French broadcast channels.\n\n\t“This will be the first time we have highlighted a country at our event, and we are thrilled that it is Korea, whose excellence and creativity in film and audiovisual production are widely recognized,” Herszberg said. “This celebration is especially meaningful as it coincides with the 140th anniversary of diplomatic relations between France and Korea. Both countries have rich histories and cultures, united by mutual fascination and a shared commitment to strengthening ties in an increasingly globalized world.”\n\n\tMoonju Kim, general director of KOCCA France, said the agency has contributed to Korean storytelling’s global reach through series including “Squid Game” and “Bon Appétit, Your Majesty.” \n\n\t“We hope that Series Mania, as one of the world’s leading platforms for series content, will further deepen mutual understanding and foster sustainable cooperation, including co-production and investment, between Korea and France,” Kim said.\n\n\tBased in Lille since 2018, Series Mania has established itself as a premier television series event, attracting over 108,000 spectators to its festival and 5,000 professionals from more than 75 countries to its forum, with 84 exhibitors and 25 international delegations.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe BAFTAs will embrace the biggest animation phenomenon of the year after all. \n\n\tEJAE, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami — better known as the singing voices for Rumi, Mira and Zoey from the band HUNTR/X in Netflix’s megahit “Kpop Demon Hunters” — are set to perform the film’s record-breaking anthem “Golden” at the BAFTA Film Awards ceremony on Feb. 22.\n\n\t“Performing at the EE BAFTA Film Awards is a golden moment that our younger selves could never have imagined!,” said EJAE, Audrey Nuna, and Rei Ami. “We’re so proud to represent Netflix’s KPop Demon Hunters and spread the film’s positive message to fans around the globe.”\n\t\n\n\tNews of the performance, which will mark the trio’s first ever live show outside the U.S., comes after “KPop Demon Hunters” was ruled ineligible to compete for a BAFTA film award having failing the theatrical release requirement. \n\n\n\tRelease in June 2025, “Kpop Demon Hunters” has become Netflix’s most popular film of all time, amassing more than 500 million streams. Meanwhile, its headline track “Golden” remains the top streamed song of 2026 so far (4 billion total streams and counting) and had a run of eight consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. Of numerous records “Golden” has smashed it has became the first female K-Pop song to reach #1 on the chart and secured the longest #1 reign of the 21st century by a female group. Last weekend it became the first K-Pop song to win a Grammy when it took home the award for best song written for visual media. \n\n\t“’KPop Demon Hunters’ has had a phenomenal impact on the hearts and minds of audiences of all ages around the world since its release last summer and so we are thrilled the talented singers behind HUNTR/X will bring their K-Pop energy to the EE BAFTA Film Awards next month,” said Emma Baehr, BAFTA’s executive director of awards & content. “Not only are we here to celebrate exceptional films and the people who make them, we also want to create an unmissable night of entertainment, and we can’t wait to roll out the EE BAFTA Film Awards red carpet for such an iconic trio.”\n\t\n\n\tThe BAFTA ceremony will take place at London’s Royal Festival Hall, with Alan Cumming hosting. The awards will premiere on BBC as-live in the U.K, and on E! in the U.S.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndox, the non-fiction festival agency led by Luke Brawley, has taken on worldwide festival rights to “Bucks Harbor,” the debut feature documentary from filmmaker Pete Muller. The film will receive its world premiere at the 76th Berlin Film Festival in the Panorama section.\n\n\t“Bucks Harbor” is a “portrait of masculinity, labor and community in coastal Maine,” according to a statement. It “explores life in a town shaped by brutal winters, generational fishing traditions and rigid cultural expectations of masculinity. Through intimate observational footage, the film charts how men come of age against the unforgiving backdrop of Maine’s Downeast region where strength of body and ability to endure are intertwined with the very definition of worth.”\n\t\n\n\t“ ‘Bucks Harbor’ is a beautifully observed and deeply human film — the kind of documentary that stays with you long after the credits roll,” Brawley said. “Pete Muller brings extraordinary sensitivity to a community rarely seen with this level of intimacy, and we’re thrilled to be partnering on the film’s festival journey, beginning with such a meaningful world premiere at Berlinale.”\n\n\n\tThe editor is Noel Paul. The cinematographers are Nathan Golon and Muller. The original score is by Nikolaj Hess.\n\n\tThe producers are Muller, Golon and Paul. The executive producers are Kaitlin Yarnall and Greg Moga. The co-producers are Jake Patryn and Morgan Patryn.\n\n\tMuller is a U.S. visual artist and documentarian, who “uses photography, film and other media to examine issues related to masculinities, conflict and human ecology,” according to his biography.\n\t\n\n\tSince 2017, he has been a Storytelling Fellow at the National Geographic Society. From 2005-2020, he was based in the Middle East and Africa exploring conflict dynamics in post-colonial states.\n\n\tHe has won premier awards from World Press Photo, Pictures of the Year International, the Overseas Press Club, TIME Magazine and others.\n\n\tIn 2022, he won the Emmy Award for best documentary for his role as co-producer of “The First Wave.”\n\n\tHis photographic work has been exhibited in solo and group shows in London, New York City, Geneva, Cape Town and elsewhere. Muller served as the Cyrus Vance Visiting Professor of International Relations at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts.\n\n\tBrawley was previously festivals manager at non-fiction experts Dogwoof.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Paris offices of Elon Musk’s X were raided Tuesday morning as part of the investigation launched last year by the cybercrime division of the Paris public prosecutor’s office.\n\n\tMusk and Linda Yaccarino have been summoned by French authorities for a court appearance on April 20 as part of the investigation, while employees of platform X are also summoned for the following week in April to be heard as witnesses, as explained by French prosecutor Laure Beccuau in a press release.\n\t\n\n\tThe investigation stems from from reports made in January against X, including one from centrist French politician Eric Bothorel who expressed his “deep concerns about recent algorithm changes on the X platform, as well as apparent interference in its management since its acquisition by Elon Musk,” according to Le Monde newspaper. A second report, unveiled in Le Canard enchaîné, was made by a cybersecurity director who called out the overrepresentation of “nauseating political content” that’s “hateful, racist, anti-LGBT+, homophobic” on X since Musk took over the platform, and argued that it was meant to “skew democratic debate in France.”\n\n\n\tFrench law enforcement authorities previously announced last July that they would investigate whether X had been engaged in “altering the functioning of an automated data processing system” and “fraudulent extraction of data from an automated data processing system as part of an organized crime group.” Without naming Musk, the Paris Prosecutor’s Office said in a statement sent to Variety that the alleged “offenses are punishable by up to 10 years in prison.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Paris prosecutor is now stating that the investigation intends on “denouncing Grok‘s operation on platform X, which have led to the dissemination of Holocaust denial content and sexual deepfakes.” Today’s release also states that the probe into Musk’s platform has now been expanded to look for clues of “complicity in the possession of child pornography images, complicity in the distribution, offering, or making available, as part of an organized gang, of child pornography images, infringement of personal image rights, and denial of crimes against humanity, among other serious offenses.”\n\n\tBack in July, Musk slammed the French criminal investigation into X’s algorithm in a lengthy post accusing French authorities to be “politically motivated” and said it won’t comply with their demands in order to defend itself against “political censorship.”\n\n\tThe platform said that it has a “legal right” to refuse to cooperate with demands from French authorities who have “requested access to X’s recommendation algorithm and real-time data about all user posts.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, in the U.K. the U.K.’s Information Commissioner’s Office also announced on Tuesday it had opened an investigation into X centered around their processing of data in relation to Grok AI.U.K. media regulator Ofcom launched its own investigation into the AI chatbot on Jan. 12 after Grok began creating and sharing deepfake sexual images. The European Commission is also investigating.\n\n\tIn an update on Tuesday Ofcom warned its investigation could take months and that it has sent “legally-binding information requests” to X. However it indicated it was unlikely to apply for a court order to ban access to X in the U.K. because “it would be a significant regulatory intervention and is not one we are likely to make routinely, given the impact it could have on freedom of expression in the U.K.” However if Musk is found to have breached the law, he faces a fine of up to 10% of X’s worldwide revenue or £18 million ($24.5 million), whichever is greater.\n\n\t“Sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation,” said Henna Virkkunen, the European Commission’s executive VP of tech sovereignty, security and democracy. “With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the DSA, or whether it treated rights of European citizens — including those of women and children — as collateral damage of its service.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Melania” director Brett Ratner has denied having a “personal relationship” with Jeffrey Epstein after the latest cache of documents revealed a photo of the two men together alongside two anonymous blonde women.\n\n\t“About 20 years ago, I had a girlfriend, I was in love with her, we were engaged, she was my fiancé, we went to an event and we were sitting on the couch and the photo was taken at that event,” Ratner told Fox News.\n\n\n\t“I didn’t have a personal relationship with him, I didn’t know him. And that’s where the picture was taken. I didn’t even remember. Because I’d been asked in the past ‘Do you know him?’ and I’m like, ‘I don’t think so’ because I didn’t have a personal relationship with him.”\n\t\n\n\t“My fiancé invited me to that event,” he continued. “At the time, the girl in the picture is my fiancé. And that’s it. You get thrown into these things, it’s crazy, it’s horrible.”\n\n\tThere is no indication of wrongdoing from Ratner.\n\n\tThe photo, which was among millions of documents released by the U.S. Department of Justice last week, obscured the faces of the two women in the photo. There was no detail about where or when the photograph was taken.\n\n\tOther known faces who appeared in the documents include Jay-Z, Pusha T and Harvey Weinstein, although the trio’s names were not contained in Epstein’s personal records but rather from tips to the FBI archived as part of the investigation. There is no implication of guilt for the accusations contained in the files or even that the tips were investigated.\n\n\tRatner is currently enjoying a career comeback after his documentary on First Lady Melania Trump defied expectations to gross $7.04 million from 1,778 North American theaters over the weekend.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDuring his Monday night appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” Don Lemon recalled the moments leading up to his arrest.\n\n\tLemon said he was out in Los Angeles on Thursday night attending pre-Grammys parties before arriving back at his hotel, where he was arrested by federal agents.\n\n\t“I got back to the hotel. I had my swag bag from the [party], and I was walking up to the room,” Lemon recalled. “I pressed the elevator button and all of a sudden, I feel myself being jostled and people trying to grab me and put me in handcuffs. And I said, ‘What are you doing here?’ They said, ‘We came to arrest you.’ I said, ‘Who are you?’ Finally, they identified. I said, ‘If you are who you are, where’s the warrant?’ They didn’t have the warrant. So, they had to wait for someone outside, an FBI guy to come in, to show me a warrant on a cell phone.”\n\t\n\n\tEarlier in the interview, Lemon said he previously heard rumors that he might be taken into custody and offered to turn himself in. However, he claims his lawyer never heard back from Attorney General Pam Bondi or Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche about the offer.\n\n\n\tHost Kimmel called the ordeal a “waste of resources.” Lemon agreed and said he thought the arrest was designed to send a message.\n\n\t“They want to embarrass you,” he added. “They want to instill fear. That’s why they did it that way.”\n\n\tFederal agents took Lemon into custody in Los Angeles on Jan. 29. Lemon’s arrest came after the Department of Justice sought to charge him with a civil rights violation for disrupting a religious service during a Minnesota ICE Protest. The former CNN host turned independent journalist claimed he was not participating as a protester, but was there as a reporter covering the demonstration, which he broadcast on his live stream.\n\t\n\n\tOn Friday, a judge released Lemon on his own recognizance. Speaking outside the downtown Los Angeles courthouse, Lemon said his arrest would not hamper his work in the press.\n\n\t“I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,” he said. “I will not stop ever. Last night, the DOJ sent a team of federal agents to arrest me in the middle of the night for something that I have been doing for the last 30 years, and that is covering the news. The First Amendment of the Constitution protects me and countless other journalists who do what I do. I stand with all of them, and I will not be silenced. I look forward to my day in court.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPhilippines media giant ABS-CBN‘s premium streaming platform iWant is betting on supernatural workplace comedy with “Nurse the Dead,” a bilingual half-hour series currently in production in Los Angeles. First looks have been unveiled.\n\n\tThe dark comedy follows Noa Reyes, a driven Filipina nurse supervisor whose ability to see ghosts — referred to as her “third eye” — makes her the go-to handler for a hospital ward teeming with restless spirits. Juggling demanding apparitions alongside staff burnout, family pressures and a coworker who seems to know more about her than expected, the series grounds its supernatural premise in the cultural specificity of the Filipino healthcare experience.\n\t\n\n\tThe project represents a significant expansion for iWant, marking the streamer’s first bilingual English-Tagalog series produced on U.S. soil. Production is underway in Los Angeles and is slated to wrap during the second week of February.\n\n\n\tMark Labella serves as showrunner, creator, writer and director on the series, with Wesley Villarica and Drea Castro directing episodes in a collaborative approach across the season.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Nurse the Dead”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tABS-CBN\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“‘Nurse the Dead’ is a dark comedy rooted in something very real: the Filipino healthcare experience,” Labella said. “Filipino nurses make up about 4% of the U.S. nursing workforce, yet were disproportionately represented among COVID-era nurse deaths — and that reality stayed with me. We’re using the supernatural and workplace chaos to explore grief, resilience, and legacy with bite, humor, and heart.”\n\n\tThe series stars Jelynn Malone as Noa Reyes. Malone, a Filipina American actor, host and Mostra Coffee co-founder, leads an ensemble cast that bridges Filipino and American entertainment. Gigette Reyes, who appears in Disney’s “Freakier Friday,” plays Mami Tess, while Johari Johnson (“American Crime Story: Impeachment,” “9-1-1: Lone Star”) portrays Jane.\n\t\n\n\tAnthony Jennings, the ABS-CBN breakout recently seen in the record-breaking “Hello, Love, Again,” takes on the role of Grim. The cast also features iconic multi-platinum Filipino recording artist and actor Tootsie Guevarra as Zeny, longtime “Eat Bulaga!” fixture Ruby Rodriguez as Ros, and award-winning Filipino actress Princess Punzalan as Camille.\n\n\tRounding out the principal cast are Sydney Bollenbeck (DonDon), Kyle Rezzarday (George) and Natalie Orsi (Archangel Yolanda).\n\n\tJolly Estaris, head of iWant and ABS-CBN Integrated Digital Sales, positioned the series as part of the platform’s broader strategy to reach Filipino diaspora audiences. “At iWant, we’re focused on building boldly Filipino storytelling with global reach,” Estaris said. “‘Nurse the Dead’ reflects that ambition – and producing our first bilingual series in Los Angeles marks a major step in iWant’s quest to connect with generations of audiences across the diaspora.”\n\n\tiWant serves a global audience with strong penetration across Filipino communities in North America, offering original series, films, and select live programming alongside library content from ABS-CBN.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Nurse the Dead”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tABS CBN\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJon Stewart opened “The Daily Show” on Monday night with a shocking revelation: his name appears in the Epstein files. \n\n\t“Of course, to get ahead of the story, I am also in the files,” Stewart said with a nervous laugh. “We all searched our names, right?”\n\n\tBut, it’s not as bad as you might think — Stewart’s name was simply mentioned in a correspondence between Epstein and Barry Josephson, who produced “Enchanted” and “Kiss of the Spider Woman.” \n\t\n\n\t“I take you to the scene: It is midnight, Aug. 29, 2015,” Stewart said, displaying a screenshot of the email in question. “Jeffrey Epstein lies wide awake, his mind turning with ideas.” Stewart explains that Epstein and Josephson were discussing the next career move of someone named Woody, which Stewart surmises is director Woody Allen. \n\n\n\t“You all know which Woody, right?” Stewart said. “It’s the Epstein files — it ain’t Harrelson or the cowboy from ‘Toy Story.'” The email message from Epstein reads: “I suggested to Woody that he do a new stand-up routine for either Apple TV or Amazon.” \n\n\t“Jeffrey Epstein always had his finger on the pulse of what America was clamoring for in 2015!” Stewart joked. “But Barry Josephson, thinking like the out-of-the-box television professional that he was, pitched this idea. This is true, quote: ‘Make a true biographical experience with his stand-up being the capper. Somebody like Jon Stewart could host/narrate the biographical part.'”\n\n\tStewart then feigned shock, exclaiming: “Excuse me? I am offended! Somebody like Jon Stewart, or Jon Stewart?! My point is, do I have the offer or is this an audition?”\n\t\n\n\tLater in his monologue, Stewart turned to Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s mentions in the files. “Ever since those revelations, Elon has been, how do the kids say it? Crashing out,” Stewart said. “He’s posted about the Epstein files more than 85 times over the last two days.”\n\n\tOf Trump, Stewart said the Department of Justice releasing the files is actually protecting him from any accountability. “Look man, we always knew that the people at DOJ releasing these documents weren’t on a fact-finding mission, they were running interference,” he said. “And the guy they’re running interference for seems very satisfied with these results.”\n\n\tWatch Stewart’s full monologue below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tVariety is unveiling the first trailer for “Shanghai Daughter,” the debut feature from Chinese filmmaker Agnis Shen Zhongmin that will world premiere in the Panorama section of the 2026 Berlin International Film Festival.\n\n\tThe drama follows Ming, a Shanghai woman who travels alone to a rubber tree plantation in Xishuangbanna, along China’s southwestern border, searching for people who knew her late father during the Cultural Revolution’s Down to the Countryside Movement half a century earlier. As the old production team house faces demolition and mining companies and modern agricultural projects transform the land that once held rubber plantations, Ming encounters a farm officer, rural doctor, Dai elder, rubber tapper, young ecologist and a mysterious woman with a special connection to her.\n\t\n\n\tThe film draws from Shen Zhongmin’s personal experiences. “The seed of this film was sown 14 years ago, when my father had just passed away from illness,” the director explains in her statement. “His death and absence drove me to embark on a journey alone to the remote tropical land.”\n\n\n\tRepeated visits over the years fostered a deep bond with the region and its people. “Rooted in my family history, this film expands its thematic scope to an exploration of ecofeminism as well as the pivotal chapters of China’s social history,” Shen Zhongmin says. “And for me, it is also an experiment to explore a non-dual realm that blurs the lines between fiction and documentary, and between the private and the public, through a simple and meditative cinematic language.”\n\n\tThe production features non-actors and real-life individuals alongside lead actress Liang Cuishan, who previously appeared in “Cloud in Her Room,” which won the Golden Tiger Award at International Film Festival Rotterdam, and “Till Love Do Us Part,” which screened at Pingyao International Film Festival.\n\t\n\n\t“Beyond the non-actors/real-life individuals and the female lead, the landscapes, flora, and fauna of southwest China are also portrayed as silent characters in their own right,” Shen Zhongmin adds. “I hope this film can immerse the audience in a tangible geographical space, inviting them to walk, observe, listen, and feel alongside the characters.”\n\n\tShen Zhongmin is also a writer and author of short story collections including “Notes on Shanghai Geography,” “Deep Simulator” and “A Traveler’s Desire.” She graduated from Tongji University with a degree in film directing and screenwriting, and previously worked as a journalist and newspaper editor before moving into cross-disciplinary practice in contemporary art, literature and film.\n\n\tProducers are Xu Ruijing and Liao Yong for Twelve Oaks. Cinematographer is Pu Wei, with sound supervision by Dukar Tserang. The project was previously selected for the work-in-progress section of SIFF Project at the 2025 Shanghai International Film Festival.\n\n\tParallax Films is handling international sales. The film is shot in Mandarin Chinese and Dai dialect.\n\n\tWatch the trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

Savannah Guthrie's mother was taken from her bed.\n      \n    \n          Another bombshell in the case of Savannah Guthrie's missing mother ... police tell TMZ Nancy Guthrie was taken by force from her Arizona home in the middle of the night.\n      \n    \n          A rep for the Pima County Sheriff's Office says Guthrie is believed to have been abducted from her home in the ritzy neighborhood of Catalina Foothills. The rep said investigators are looking at registered sex offenders and others in the area while combing through videos from cameras at Guthrie's home, neighbors' residences, local businesses and traffic lights. Police have not identified a suspect.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          Police declined to say whether blood was found inside the home, if the home was in disarray from a struggle or if there was forced entry. But, the sheriff's department said they're talking with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has a long history of working with kidnapping and missing persons cases.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          The sheriff's spokesperson tells us ... Customs and Border Protection are also involved in the case ... the agency's specially trained K-9 dogs were used to help search for Guthrie, who is 84, lives alone and suffers from poor health. Police say she needs to take her daily medications to survive so time is of the essence to find her.\n      \n    \n          As we reported ... 84-year-old Nancy was reported missing Sunday afternoon, and was last seen Saturday night at her Tucson house. Authorities previously announced homicide detectives were investigating the case.\n      \n    \n          In a statement Sunday, Savannah said ... \"On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers and messages of support. Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom.\"\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Savannah Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Nancy Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Family\n              \n                          \n                Today Show\n              \n                          \n                Police\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

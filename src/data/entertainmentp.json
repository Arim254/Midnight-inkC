    "body": "\n\tReel Citrus has picked up U.S. theatrical rights to “Summer School, 2001,” a Vietnamese-Czech co-production directed by Dužan Duong, marking the indie distributor’s first fully managed theatrical release as it builds its 2026 slate.\n\n\tThe acquisition, announced during the Sundance Film Festival, sets a summer 2026 domestic release following the film’s Vietnam premiere. The film, which debuted at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, scored best film honors at Viet Film Fest 2025 and completed a theatrical run in the Czech Republic.\n\t\n\n\tThe drama centers on Kien, a red-haired teenager who rejoins his family’s Cheb market stall following a decade-long separation in Vietnam, only to encounter a withdrawn father, exhausted mother and antagonistic younger brother. The narrative tracks the siblings’ volatile relationship over one summer as their family navigates questions of identity and connection in their Czech border town. The early-2000s-set pic explores the experience of straddling multiple cultures.\n\n\n\tVietnamese-Czech actor and rapper Duong Bui The stars as Kien. He relocated to Czechia in 2015 and his artistic practice is focused on cross-cultural themes. To Tien Tai, who was born and raised in Czechia, plays the younger brother Tai in a performance that earned him best actor at Viet Film Fest 2025. Doan Hoang Anh rounds out the principal cast as the family patriarch Zung, a father attempting to bridge the distance created by years spent establishing their life abroad.\n\n\tReel Citrus is plotting a phased rollout targeting diaspora and cultural markets, with initial playdates in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Austin and New York. Additional markets will be added based on audience response.\n\t\n\n\tThe distributor has partnered with the Czech Embassy and Czech Film Center to mount special screenings in Washington, D.C. and New York as part of the release strategy.\n\n\tFounded in 2025 by Brittany Tran, who serves as executive director, Reel Citrus specializes in theatrical-first releases of Asian and diaspora titles with an emphasis on Gen Z and multicultural audiences. The company’s marketing model centers on community engagement, cultural partnerships and youth-driven outreach.\n\n\tPrior to “Summer School, 2001,” the company handled audience development campaigns for “The Ancestral Home,” “Mang Mẹ Đi Bỏ” (Leaving Mom) and Ham Tran’s “Hijacked.”\n\n\tTran is currently at Sundance meeting with filmmakers and financiers as the company expands its distribution slate.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Primitive War” is returning for another round of Vietnam War-meets-dinosaur action.\n\n\t“Primitive War 2” is in the works, Variety can confirm. Luke Sparke is returning to write, direct and produce the sequel through his Sparke Films. He also served as the editor, production designer and VFX supervisor on last year’s first film. The franchise is based on Ethan Pettus’ book series.\n\n\t“The first film was about discovery,” Sparke said in a statement. “This is about escalation — what happens when control is lost, when nature adapts faster than military doctrine and when the war itself becomes secondary to what’s been unleashed.”\n\t\n\n\t“Primitive War 2” is currently in late development, with plans to release it in 2027. Returning to the film are Sparke’s Queensland-based crew and producers Carmel Imrie, Carly Sparke, executive producer Geoff Imrie and co-producer Alex Becconsall. Carmel and Geoff Imrie are producing through their company, Let It Be Entertainment.\n\n\n\tPer the official description, “‘Primitive War 2’ expands the scope and mythology of the franchise, pushing deeper into the Vietnam conflict zone where 1960’s warfare collides with prehistoric predators. The sequel is positioned as a darker, more intense escalation — and more grounded war epic — continuing the series’ distinctive blend of military realism and survival horror. Set in the aftermath of the original film, ‘Primitive War 2’ follows a new U.S. platoon sent into an increasingly unstable valley, where competing kill zones, rival apex predators and secret Cold War agendas converge. As containment collapses, the mission becomes one of survival — and the cost of failure threatens to extend far beyond the battlefield.”\n\t\n\n\t“I had a blast watching the first ‘Primitive War’ film, and I’m excited to see how the sequel goes!” Pettus said in a statement.\n\n\tLuke Sparke is represented by Ben Levine at Link Entertainment and Vivek Kolli, with legal representation by Hirsch Wallerstein Hayum Matlof + Fishman.\n\n\tSee the teaser poster below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery fired back at the latest salvo from David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance, saying that more than 93% of its shareholders have rejected Paramount’s “inferior scheme” in favor of the $83 billion sale of WB to Netflix.\n\n\tWBD was responding to Paramount’s announcement Thursday that it was extending its hostile takeover offer of $30/share in cash to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders until Feb. 20. Paramount filed to solicit WBD stockholders to vote against the Netflix deal at a special meeting of Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders, expected to take place in April.\n\t\n\n\tIn a statement, Warner Bros. Discovery said: “Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. It’s also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount’s inferior scheme. We are confident in our ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Netflix merger and look forward to delivering the tremendous and certain value our agreement will provide to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.”\n\n\n\tWBD’s board has turned down Paramount’s M&A offers eight times.\n\n\tIf Paramount Skydance fails to persuade WBD stockholders who own more than 90% of outstanding shares to support its bid by Feb. 20 — and it seems unlikely Paramount will succeed here, given the WBD board’s firm backing of the Netflix deal — Ellison would be forced to again extend the tender offer deadline, assuming his company opts to continue pursuing the hostile takeover campaign.\n\t\n\n\tWhat would move the needle in Paramount’s favor: upping the price tag on its acquisition offer for Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety.\n\n\tParamount’s bid is backed by David Ellison’s father, Oracle co-founder and multibillionaire Larry Ellison (who has personally committed $40.4 billion toward the prospective deal), along with partners including RedBird Capital Partners and the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.\n\n\tBut according to sources familiar with the thinking of Paramount Skydance and its financial backers, the media company right now is not prepared to go higher than $30/share. In announcing the extension of its tender offer, Paramount Skydance said it was “reaffirming its commitment to a transaction with WBD at a $108.4 billion enterprise value that is significantly greater and far more certain than the purported $82.7 billion enterprise value of the Netflix transaction.”\n\n\tNetflix on Tuesday (Jan. 20) upgraded its deal to buy Warner Bros. Discovery’s TV and film studios and the HBO Max streaming business by switching to an all-cash offer valued at $27.75/share, replacing its previous cash-and-stock agreement. That was aimed at negating Paramount’s assertion that its offer was superior because it was all-cash.\n\n\tNetflix and WBD said their deal is on track to close 12-18 months following the signing of their original agreement on Dec. 4, 2025, pending regulatory clearances and WBD shareholder approval. Netflix’s deal for Warner Bros. would close following WBD’s planned Q3 spin-off of Discovery Global, which is set to include cable nets like CNN, TNT, TBS, HGTV and Food Network as well as TNT Sports and Discovery+.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Paramount sued WBD’s board members earlier this month, seeking to force it to disclose financial details including how it is valuating Discovery Global. According to Paramount’s analysis, shares in Discovery Global would be worthless (although it conceded that Discovery Global would have a theoretical M&A value of $0.50/share). In an SEC filing Tuesday in connection with the amended all-cash agreement with Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery disclosed details of the Discovery Global entity, including five-year financial projections for CNN and other properties — no court order needed. WBD said the board’s analysis of “selected public companies” on a sum-of-the-parts basis indicated an approximate implied equity value reference range for Discovery Global of $2.41 to $3.77 per share. Furthermore, it said, an analysis of Discovery Global in the context of a potential future acquisition (based on a selected transactions analysis) indicated Discovery Global is worth $4.63 to $6.86 per share.\n\t\n\n\tOn Thursday, Paramount claimed that WBD “still has omitted highly material information its shareholders need about Discovery Global” — namely, how much debt WBD will ultimately offload to Discovery Global. WBD said the target amount of net debt for Discovery Global is $17.0 billion as of June 30, 2026, with decreases over time to $16.1 billion as of Dec. 31, 2026. As part of its upgraded deal terms, Netflix agreed to reduce the specified amount of net debt to be borne by Discovery Global by $260 million.\n\n\tIf WBD allocates any portion of the $17 billion debt amount pegged for Discovery Global (as of June 30) back to the WBD streaming and studios business, “that will reduce the per-share consideration dollar-for-dollar that WBD shareholders will receive” under the Netflix offer, Paramount noted.\n\n\t“Despite the fact that the capital structure of Discovery Global will directly determine the actual amount WBD shareholders receive in the Netflix transaction, and WBD will be required to disclose such information as well as full financial information about Discovery Global at the time of the separation, WBD plans to solicit shareholder approval for the Netflix transaction without this information,” Paramount Skydance said.\n\n\tAccording to Netflix, under its latest agreement with WBD, it would assume $10.7 billion in Warner Bros. net debt. The WB acquisition would be funded by $20 billion in cash on hand and $52 billion in debt financing. For the all-cash $27.75/share deal, Netflix has secured $42.2 billion in debt financing from Wells Fargo, BNP and HSBC.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLeading Mexican production company Woo Films has acquired the rights to Nobel Prize laureate Annie Ernaux’s “The Use of Photography,” with “The Eternal Feminine” director Natalia Beristáin set to direct. \n\n\tThe 2005 novel, co-written by Ernaux and photographer Marc Marie, chronicles the duo’s love story throughout the author’s breast cancer treatment. Production details and casting for the film will be announced in the coming months.\n\t\n\n\tWoo Film producer Mario Savino said Ernaux’s work “presents a completely frank, fearless account of the human experience.” “Her ability to transform the ephemeral and intimate into something universal makes ‘The Use of Photography’ an extraordinarily cinematic work. It’s a profound meditation on what it means to hold onto fleeting moments. We are honored to bring this powerful story to the screen,” he added. \n\n\n\tA meditation on writing, love and desire, “The Use of Photography” is highly regarded as a defining work in the French writer’s greatly lauded career. The novel represents Ernaux’s first major work to incorporate visual imagery as a central narrative element, leading directly to what is considered by many to be her most significant novel, “The Years.” \n\n\tOther film adaptations of the French author’s work include Audrey Diwan’s “Happening” and Patrick Mario Bernard and Pierre Trividic’s “The Other One.” In 2022, Ernaux herself co-directed “The Super 8 Years” alongside her son David Ernaux-Briot, gathering family home videos between 1972 and 1981 to reflect on themes present in her six-decade-long body of work.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Super 8 Years,” courtesy of Kino Lorber.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Les Fillms Pelleas\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMexico City-born Beristáin established herself as a voice to watch in Latin America over the last decade, with films premiering at major festivals such as Venice, Cannes and San Sebastian, winning the Spanish Cooperation Award for “Noise” at the Basque festival. All three of her feature films to date have earned their leads an Ariel Award nomination for Best Actress, with Adriana Roel winning for “She Doesn’t Want to Sleep Alone,” Karina Gidi for “The Eternal Feminine” and Julieta Egurrola landing a nomination for “Noise.” \n\n\tThe 2022 drama “Noise,” chronicling a woman’s search for her missing daughter and the bond she forms with those whose lives have also been destroyed by violence, became Netflix’s most-watched non-English language film globally on its premiere. Beristáin has also directed acclaimed television series for Apple TV+, Netflix and Amazon Prime\n\n\t“In times as turbulent as those we are living through globally, few things feel as hopeful to me as the narrative of Ernaux and Marie,” said Beristáin. “Their story, and the way they tell it, embodies the timeless myth of love transcending death. She is navigating cancer, he has just severed all ties with his former life. They find each other in that particular moment of existence and fall in love. To translate this beautiful, quotidian, yet profoundly philosophical narrative into a cinematic work is no simple undertaking. But to speak of how love redeems us is, and will always be, necessary.”\n\n\tWoo Films has established itself over 20 years as one of the most successful independent production companies in Mexico and Latin America, with films premiering at Cannes, Toronto, Venice and San Sebastián, as well as achieving both critical acclaim and commercial success. Titles in their roster include Netflix’s popular series “The House of Flowers” and Rodrigo Prieto’s “Pedro Páramo.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA fun fact perhaps not known by many industry folk is that Netflix’s first Oscar win didn’t come from one of its big, noisy and high-profile projects backed by a vast marketing campaign. Instead, the streamer’s very first Oscar statuette came from “The White Helmets,” about the inspiring work of volunteer rescue workers in Syria during the Civil War. \n\n\tThe 2016 short was produced by Joanna Natasegara, one of a number of powerful projects from the filmmaker exploring global conflict and socio-politics. A decade on, however, and the Brit has a very different tale to tell on screen, this time in her first doc feature as director. \n\t\n\n\tPremiering at Sundance, “The Disciple” unravels the story of Dutch-Moroccan rapper and producer Tarik Azzougarh, better known by his stage-name Cilvaringz. An obsessive Wu-Tang Clan fanboy in his teens in the 90s, Cilvaringz managed to achieve the unthinkable and, through relentless hustle, hard work and determination, work his way into the group’s inner circle, touring the world with his then hero and mentor RZA. \n\n\n\tBut it was also Cilvaringz who produced the now mythical and hugely contentious Wu-Tang record “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.” As part of a comment on the value of art — and wanting to give music the same status as priceless paintings in museums — he devised the concept to make just one copy and put it up for auction. Unfortunately, the buyer — who paid $2 million, making it the most expensive musical work ever sold — was notorious (and later convicted) entrepreneur Martin Shkreli, adding further clouds of controversy over the project. \n\t\n\n\tBoasting an energetic style itself inspired by the Wu-Tang Clan and RZA in its use of diverse creative references (particular Hong Kong martial arts movies), “The Disciple” dives headfirst into Cilvaringz incredible trajectory within the group and the making — and subsequent fallout — of “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.” \n\n\tDespite the conflict and controversy surrounding the album, Natasegara — herself a Wu-Tang Clan fan since her teenage years in Manchester — says it was important to her that she not make a “beef movie.” Instead, the film seeks to underline the spirituality and strong ethics baked into the Clan and their art. “Each and every one of them believes in positivity,” she says. “And they believe in hard work and being nice to each other.”\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety ahead of its Sundance debut on Feb. 22, Natasegara — who was recently announced as the director of an HBO doc about Gisèle Pelicot — discusses the inspirational message of Cilvaringz’s achievements and bringing RZA on board as an exec producer. As she notes, he “really is that impressive and mystical in person.”\n\t\n\t\tYou’re obviously an Oscar-winner for ‘The White Helmets’ and have a number of other projects like that under your belt. But this is something very different. How did it come your way?\t\n\n\tYou’re right, I don’t think people are expecting this from me. But I happened to meet Cilva through a friend. I was on holiday with the family in Morocco and met him and he told me his story, which just this kind of wild, twisting and turning, magical story, full of its own serendipity, hard work and determination from him, but also with these kind of magical elements. And I realized that the full story hadn’t really been told. We continued talking and, quite quickly I understood that, he’s basically the same as me, so many of the themes, as I learned more and more. more resonated with me, with our age, with growing up in the 90s. And there’s so much that’s hopeful and optimistic about that and it just really, it really spoke to me. So it felt like the right project for to take the leap and director.\n\t\n\t\tWhy do you think this incredible story hadn’t been told before?\t\n\n\tMaybe that is a function of the work that I’ve done before — I’m particularly proud of being able to gain trust from contributors. I think it’s really important that you approach telling people’s stories with total transparency and ethics, and that you lay out what you’re interested in and why you’re going to do it. With Tarik, we did a lot of talking before we started making the film. And I wrote to RZA very early doors. I wanted him and the Clan to know that we were doing this and that we weren’t interested in making a beef movie. There is this mysticism to the Clan that people that love them know and delving into what that is and the positive aspects of it are really important. Of course, there was conflict and controversy about this album, but I think approaching all of that with the most amount of respect for everybody was important to the story.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAs you say, you happened to meet Tarik on holiday. But how did you manage to win over the RZA and the rest of the Clan?\t\n\n\tIt takes a long time. I have to be clear, not all of the Clan have seen the film, but RZA is an EP. As Tarik says in the film, they’re just people and people with beautiful manners. So each one of them we approached. Some of them replied and declined. Not all of them replied. But I hope all of them watch the film.\n\t\n\t\tYou proudly announce that RZA exec produced it at the end, but I wasn’t sure of his involvement as he’s not in all that much beyond archive footage. Was that an easy thing to figure out?\t\n\n\tThe approach is really from a fan, Tarik’s story and how he thrived under the mentorship of RZA. But also, RZA’s own accounts of the album he has given contemporaneously over the decades. So each piece that you hear, it’s really him and his thoughts at that time. And those thoughts evolve, so we could never really gain that same level of feeling if you interviewed him post facto, it’s not same. And I think he really liked that idea.\n\t\n\t\tYou must have met RZA several times. Even those who aren’t Wu-Tang fans appreciate he has this incredible aura around him and his work. What’s he like in person?\t\n\n\tYeah, he really is that impressive and mystical in person. The more I get to know him, because I was a Clan fan — not a fanboy like Tarik — but the more you delve into that world and their ethics and the way they treat people and the way they deal with things, the more you understand that that’s actually who they are. I think another aspect of this is that so much resonates in terms of morality and religion and spirituality that’s baked into their art.\n\t\n\t\tAs an outsider, much of the hip hop world feels very blingy and about excess and showing off, but with this film you really get the impression that the Wu-Tang have a different way of thinking spiritually. They seem very humble.\t\n\n\tThey are. They’re just absolutely lovely to be around. And with each one of them, we just had such a great connection, where they’re so open. And it really spoke to how we edited the doc. We really wanted everyone’s opinions, even when they were converging, to be represented fairly of what they thought about all of this. And the strongest impetus, I think, is that each and every one of them believes in positivity. And they believe in hard work and being nice to each other, and kind of aspirational dreams.We had one young viewer that watched the film, and she burst into tears because she said, ‘Actually, this is the thing we don’t really have in our generation, this is something we should fight for.’ Hard work, but also dream big. And I do think the more I reflect on it, that’s something we perhaps did have in the 90s and was something that was baked into us.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe first section of the film deals with Tarik and obsessive fandom. He was a fanboy, but a talented one and through sheer relentless perseverance managed to connect with the Clan, start touring and then making music with them. I’m not sure I’ve seen that trajectory from fanboy to member like that before. It’s quite inspirational.\t\n\n\tI agree. He gives a strong message of ‘What’s the worst that can happen, just go for it’.\n\t\n\t\tThe story of ‘Once Upon a Time in Shaolin’ — the first privatised album in the world — is absolutely wild. But it started with such a great moral thesis behind it. Was it just pure bad luck that Martin Shkreli came on board?\t\n\n\tI guess so. I don’t know how they could have ever known. Tarik expresses regrets about certain things, but I think on balance, what I’d like the audience to ask themselves at the end of the film is, ‘You’ve heard all the kind of differing opinions, do you think on balance was a good thing that happened or not’. And I hope we’re not prescriptive about that.\n\t\n\t\tHave you heard the album yourself?\t\n\n\tI have heard some pieces of it, yes. The reviews are right, it’s like a combination of 36 Chambers and Wu-Tang Forever. It is that good.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. scored a leading 30 Oscar nominations on Thursday morning, collecting a record 16 nods for Ryan Coogler’s vampire thriller “Sinners,” as well as 13 for Paul Thomas Anderson’s comedic adventure “One Battle After Another” and one for Amy Madigan’s supporting turn in “Weapons.”\n\n\tWarner Bros. tied its own record, established in 2005 when the studio racked up 30 nominations for films including Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank’s sports drama “Million Dollar Baby,” Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio’s “The Aviator,” and “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.” It’s worth noting the 2005 benchmark comes with a caveat; “The Aviator” was co-produced by Miramax, and the studio was operating a separate arthouse label, Warner Bros. Independent, which released Oscar nominees such as “Before Sunset” and “A Very Long Engagement.” That makes this year’s haul even more impressive because the Warner Bros. main production arms oversaw and released all of the contenders. “F1: The Movie” is not included in the studio’s 2026 tally despite earning four nominations. That’s because Warner Bros. was paid to distribute the Brad Pitt-led racing thriller, but the film was produced and financed by Apple. Prior to that, Warner Bros. amassed a then-record 28 nominations for films from 1943, including “Casablanca.”\n\t\n\n\tNeon followed on the scorecard with 18 nods for movies such as Joachim Trier’s family drama “Sentimental Value” and the Brazilian crime thriller “The Secret Agent.” This is, by far, Neon’s best showing on Oscar nominations morning, topping the indie studio’s high water-mark of eight in 2020 when “Parasite” ended up winning best picture.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix, which was the most-nominated studio in 2024 and 2025, ranked in third place with 16 nominations. The streamer was recognized for Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein,” the Joel Edgerton-led drama “Train Dreams” and the animated sensation “KPop Demon Hunters.” Netflix also collected two nominations for the shorts “The Singers” and “All the Empty Rooms,” but the Academy’s official scorecard only counts feature-length films.\n\n\tHere’s the full list of Academy Award nominations. Conan O’Brien will host the 98th annual ceremony, which will air on March 15 from the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. \n\n\tBelow is a quantified breakdown of which studios and films collected the most accolades:\n\n\tNOMINATIONS BY STUDIO\n\n\tWarner Bros. — 30Neon — 18Netflix — 16Focus Features — 13A24 — 11Apple — 6Walt Disney — 4GKids — 2Sony Pictures Classics — 2HBO Documentary Films — 1Independent Film Company/Shudder — 1MasterClass/Greenwich Entertainment — 1Pink — 1Universal — 1Viva Verdi — 1Willa — 1\n\n\tNOMINATIONS BY FEATURE FILM\n\n\t“Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — 16“One Battle after Another” (Warner Bros.) — 13“Frankenstein” (Netflix) — 9“Marty Supreme” (A24) — 9“Sentimental Value” (Neon) — 9“Hamnet” (Focus Features) — 8“Bugonia” (Focus Features) — 4“F1” (Apple) — 4“The Secret Agent” (Neon) — 4“Train Dreams” (Netflix) — 4“Avatar: Fire and Ash” (Walt Disney) — 2“Blue Moon” (Sony Pictures Classics) — 2“It Was Just an Accident” (Neon) — 2“KPop Demon Hunters” (Netflix) — 2“Sirāt” (Neon) — 2\n",

    "body": "\n\tBob Costas, who enjoyed nearly four decades as a sportscaster on NBC, found a way to extend his relationship with the Comcast-backed outlet.\n\n\tCostas will return to NBC as the host of the pre-game for the network’s new “Sunday Night Baseball,” which will air before the games run on both NBC and Peacock. Costas, who left NBC in 2019 two years after stepping away from NBC Sports‘ Olympics coverage. will debuts as host on Thursday, March 26, at Dodger Stadium, as the Los Angeles Dodgers host the Arizona Diamondbacks. The game is the only primetime window for Major League Baseball on the league’s Opening Day.\n\t\n\n\tNBCU is believed to be paying $200 million per year for the new rights contract.\n\n\n\tSince leaving NBC, Costas has worked for MLB Network and Warner Bros. Discovery’s TNT Sports. Costas previously served as a play-by-play voice and host for NBC Sports’ MLB coverage for 15 seasons, from 1982 to 1989 and from 1994 to 2000. He also hosted “Later,” a wee-hours program that came on after David Letterman’s “Late Night.”\n\n\t“As appreciative as I am of other aspects of my career, especially HBO and the MLB Network, for 40 years, my true broadcasting home was NBC,” Costas said in a statement. “So many great moments, memories, and friendships. Now, I am very grateful to Rick Cordella and Sam Flood for inviting me back in an emeritus role to conclude my career where so much of it played out,” he added, referring to the president of NBC Sports and its top programming executive.\n\n\t Costas has been working for NBC in less prominent fashion. He has narrated multiple opening teases, for the network’s Tuesday-night basketball coverage, and is expected to continue to contribute to NBA coverage as the season progresses.\n\t\n\n\tMore to come…\n\n\tMore to come…\n",

    "body": "\n\tFour-time Grammy-nominated pop artist and singer-songwriter Bebe Rexha has gone indie and entered a partnership with powerhouse Bay Area-based label and distributor Empire.\n\n\tShe joins after three albums on Warner Records and hits like “Meant to Be,” “I’m A Mess,” “Me, Myself, and I,” “I’m Good (Blue)” and “In the Name of Love,” and collaborations with David Guetta, Lil Wayne, J Balvin, Florida Georgia Line, Doja Cat, Snoop Dogg, Kylie Minogue, Louis Tomlinson and many others.\n\t\n\n\tRexha broke the news of the deal herself earlier this month when responding to a fan’s question on social media, where her next era is already underway. \n\n\n\n\tTerms of the deal were not disclosed but the announcement states that the partnership “signals a strategic move toward greater creative autonomy while continuing to scale her global impact,” and “further underscores Empire’s commitment to partnering with world-class artists and helping them build sustainable, long-term careers on their own terms.”\n\n\tRexha says, “It’s never been about putting out record after record. People may know me as a pop artist, but at my core I’ve always been a singer and songwriter first. Going independent and partnering with Empire isn’t just a business move for me. They believe in my vision and trust my instincts, which has refueled my creativity. This new era is about embracing every part of myself, even when I’m a mess. This version of me is unapologetically comfortable in my own lane. I’m excited to invite people deeper into my world, beyond the music. I do this for mom, fans and little Bebe”.\n\t\n\n\tEmpire founder and CEO Ghazi adds, “Bebe Rexha has built an undeniable legacy both as a songwriter and a pop icon with cross-genre hits. She has an ability to craft records that resonate globally and what excites us most is that she’s still evolving. This partnership marks a powerful next chapter where we can reach new creative heights together.”\n\n\tThe Brooklyn-born artist began her professional career as a songwriter, scoring hits with Eminem, Rihanna and Selena Gomez. She has been nominated for four Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist, and was a Variety Hitmakers honoree in 2018. She also sang the National Anthem at Game 2 of the 2025 World Series.\n\n\tMore information on Rexha’s next chapter will be posted at areudirty.com.\n",

    "body": "\n\tArctic Monkeys are back with the band’s first song since 2022 — and for a good cause.\n\n\tThe U.K. rockers have released “Opening Night,” the first single from War Child‘s upcoming charity album “Help (2),” which will feature new tracks from a slew of big names including Olivia Rodrigo, Cameron Winter and Depeche Mode.\n\n\tThe new collaborative album, inspired by the iconic 1995 charity release “Help,” will drop on March 6 with proceeds benefitting War Child, which delivers “immediate aid, education, specialist mental health support and protection to children affected by conflict around the world,” according to a press release. The money raised will support War Child’s work across 14 countries, including Sudan, Gaza, Ukraine and Syria. \n\t\n\n\tThe list of artists contributing also includes Anna Calvi, Arlo Parks, Arooj Aftab, Bat for Lashes, Beabadoobee, Beck, Beth Gibbons, Big Thief, Black Country New Road, Damon Albarn, Dove Ellis, Ellie Rowsell, English Teacher, Ezra Collective, Foals, Fontaines D.C., Graham Coxon, Greentea Peng, Grian Chatten, Kae Tempest, King Krule, Nilüfer Yanya, Pulp, Sampha, The Last Dinner Party, Wet Leg and Young Fathers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“Help(2)” was produced by Grammy winner James Ford and recorded across one week in November 2025 at London’s iconic Abbey Road Studios. Oscar-winning “The Zone of Interest” filmmaker Jonathan Glazer served as the project’s creative director, shooting the artwork and producing a trailer for the album (watch below). His concept was “By Children, for Children,” with “his team handing the cameras over to children in order to see the world through their eyes and serve as a constant reminder of the reason for the endeavor to the audience and all involved,” the release stated.\n\t\n\n\t“Each child operated their own small camera and was invited into the studios to film the artists recording without any restrictions. In addition, Glazer’s team worked with fixers and filmmakers in Ukraine, Gaza, Yemen and Sudan to gather footage filmed by children on the ground in these conflict zones. The results are a stunning piece of work that, ultimately, connects the album to the children the music seeks to help.”\n\n\n\n\n\t“When James Ford called and asked if we’d contribute to the ‘HELP(2)’ album we set to work on a song idea and assembled in Abbey Road to record it,” Arctic Monkeys said in a statement. “We are proud to support the invaluable work War Child do and hope the record will make a positive difference to the lives of children affected by war.” \n\n\tAccording to the press release, the recording process resulting in collaborations including: “Damon Albarn, Grian Chatten and Kae Tempest’s ‘super-group’ included all of Johnny Marr, Dave Okumu and Portishead’s Adrian Utley laying down guitar, Gorillaz’ Seye Adelekan on bass, Femi Koleoso from Ezra Collective on drums, as well as an all-star choir including Jarvis Cocker, Marr, Carl Barat, Declan McKenna, English Teacher, Black Country, New Road, Marika Hackman, Rosa Walton and Nadia Kadek; Graham Coxon ended up playing guitar for Olivia Rodrigo’s cover of The Magnetic Fields’ ‘The Book of Love’; Wolf Alice’s Ellie Rowsell joined Anna Calvi, Nilüfer Yanya and Dove Ellis for the new song ‘Sunday Light,’ having received an invite to perform on the day of recording itself; and Cameron Winter brought cello player Amy Langley into his intimate Abbey Road recording.”\n\n\tThe original “Help” album in 1995 raised over £1.2 million ($1.6 million), enabling War Child to provide vital support to children affected by the Bosnian conflict. It was led by Brian Eno and featured contributions from the biggest names in music at the time, including Oasis, Blur, Radiohead, Massive Attack, Portishead, Sinéad O’Connor, Paul McCartney and Paul Weller.\n\n\tSee the full “Help(2)” tracklist below.\n\n\nArctic Monkeys – “Opening Night”\nDamon Albarn, Grian Chatten & Kae Tempest – “Flags”\nBlack Country, New Road – “Strangers”\nThe Last Dinner Party – “Let’s Do It Again!”\nBeth Gibbons – “Sunday Morning”\nArooj Aftab & Beck – “Lilac Wine”\nKing Krule – “The 343 Loop”\nDepeche Mode – “Universal Soldier”\nEzra Collective & Greentea Peng – “Helicopters”\nArlo Parks – “Nothing I Could Hide”\nEnglish Teacher & Graham Coxon – “Parasite”\nBeabadoobee – “Say Yes”\nBig Thief – “Relive, Redie”\nFontaines D.C. – “Black Boys on Mopeds”\nCameron Winter – “Warning”\nYoung Fathers – “Don’t Fight the Young”\nPulp – “Begging for Change”\nSampha – “Naboo”\nWet Leg – “Obvious”\nFoals – “When the War Is Finally Done”\nBat for Lashes – “Carried My Girl”\nAnna Calvi, Ellie Rowsell, Nilüfer Yanya & Dove Ellis – “Sunday Light”\nOlivia Rodrigo – “The Book of Love”\n\n\n",

Eva Victor’s “Sorry Baby” was a Sundance darling turned Gotham, Spirit Award and Golden Globe nominee, but Academy voters ignored Victor’s original screenplay. Celine Song was an Oscars darling for “Past Lives,” but her buzzy follow-up “Materialists” is a zero-time nominee. Same goes for Steven Soderbergh’s brilliant “Black Bag,” Wes Anderson’s “The Phoenician Scheme” and Noah Baumbach’s “Jay Kelly.”\n\n\tCheck out a full rundown below of great movies with zero Oscar nominations in 2026.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t28 Years Later\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDanny Boyle and Alex Garland’s “28 Years Later” was named the fifth best movie of 2025 by Variety film critic Peter Debruge and should’ve at least been in awards consideration for best cinematography thanks to Anthony Dod Mantle’s audacious use of the iPhone 15 Pro Max. “The reason this movie rocked me — emotionally — is that Boyle et al clearly recognized they were telling a post-pandemic narrative for a society (ours) that had just endured a pandemic (COVID-19), building in an opportunity to grieve and process what we’ve collectively been through via the cathartic Bone Temple sequence,” writes Debruge. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBlack Bag\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSteven Soderbergh’s excellent thriller “Black Bag” deserved Oscar consideration for its whip-smart screenplay full of sly espionage thrills and dark marriage comedy. Michael Fassbender plays an insect-like spy bugging out as he carefully probes his peers, including his wife (Cate Blanchett, perfect as the femme fatale), to discover a traitor among the ranks. The film was named one of Variety’s best movies of 2025: “Soderbergh’s perfectly ingenious romantic thriller about two married British spies trying to outmaneuver each other is the year’s most captivating bauble.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Sony Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSony and Crunchyroll’s “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle” missed out on the best animated feature race in favor of movies like “Elio,” “Zootopia 2” and Netflix’s frontrunner “KPop Demon Hunters,” among others. But “Demon Slayer” was its own box office phenomenon with $779 million worldwide and also earned a Golden Globe nomination for animated film.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDie My Love\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Mubi/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJennifer Lawrence is an Oscars darling with four nominations under her belt and one win (best actress for “Silver Linings Playbook”), but not even some of the best reviews of her career for Lynne Ramsay’s psychodrama “Die My Love” could get her into this year’s best actress category. Lawrence gives an acclaimed performance as a new mother who spirals into madness while dealing with postpartum depression and a husband (Robert Pattinson) who can’t support her needs.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEddington\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAri Aster’s timelier-by-the-day “Eddington” is set in a small New Mexico town come undone by politics, COVID and more. Perhaps the movie hit too much of a nerve to get at least the original screenplay awards buzz it so deserved.

Robinson plays a socially awkward husband whose infatuation with a charismatic new neighbor (Rudd) leads to unexpected consequences. Kate Mara and Jack Dylan Grazer also star. From Variety’s review: “While we may think, at first, that we’re watching a comedy about a sad-sack geek who’s drawn out of his shell, the film always makes sure that Craig, as inhabited by Robinson, is a notch weirder and more off-putting than we expect.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHedda \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©MGM/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Candyman” and “The Marvels” director Nia DaCosta delivered a sizzling and seductive reimagining of Henrik Ibsen’s “Hedda Gabler” with a brilliant Tessa Thompson front and center as the eponymous woman who navigates a house she does not want, a marriage she feels trapped in and an ex-lover who has reappeared in her life. Thompson earned nominations from the Gotham Awards, Golden Globes and Indie Spirit Awards but was never able to break out of her dark horse status in the Oscar race for best actress. Nina Hoss would’ve also been an inspired contender for best supporting actress.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHighest 2 Lowest\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSpike Lee and Denzel Washington reunited for a fifth time with A24 and Apple’s thriller “Highest 2 Lowest,” a New York City spin on Akira Kurosawa’s kidnapping drama “High and Low.” The movie earned strong notices out of the Cannes Film Festival but never gained traction on the awards circuit.

Alas, the film gradually lost traction over the season and walked away with zero Oscar nominations. Bigelow’s “The Hurt Locker” won best picture and director honors, while “Zero Dark Thirty” earned five nominations, including best picture. Since then, the Oscars have avoided Bigelow’s follow-ups “Detroit” and “A House of Dynamite.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJay Kelly\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThere was a time after Noah Baumbach’s “Jay Kelly” world premiered at the Venice Film Festival that George Clooney and Adam Sandler seemed liked locks to land Oscar nominations for best actor and supporting actor, respectively.

Clooney riffs on his movie star persona in the film by playing a world-famous actor who has an existential crisis as he travels overseas to accept a lifetime achievement award.

Co-written and edited by “Anora” Oscar winner Sean Baker, the movie follows a single mother and her two daughters as they relocate to Taipei to open a night market stall. The cast includes Janel Tsai, Nina Ye, Teng-Hui Huang and Shih-Yuan Ma.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLurker\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAlex Russell’s Sundance sensation “Lurker” was named the seventh best movie of 2025 by Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman: “In this sleek and unnerving parable of the pathology of celebrity, Théodore Pellerin, as a hanger-on who will do anything to hang on, gives a performance that lays bare the reptilian underside of wide-eyed fan worship… ‘Lurker’ has been made with the craft of early vintage Polanski crossed with an up-to-the-minute awareness of what pop culture has come to mean when the famous and their fans are now chasing each other’s tails.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Mastermind\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Mubi/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“The Mastermind” follows in the footsteps of “First Cow,” “Certain Women” and “Showing Up” as the latest acclaimed Kelly Reichardt movie to be shut out of the Oscars. Her latest was named a Variety Critic’s Pick out of the Cannes Film Festival: “Josh O’Connor comes unstuck as a family man whose under-planned theft from a local art museum goes inexorably, amusingly awry… Reichardt has never met a genre she couldn’t meticulously deconstruct. But rarely has she done so with such offbeat wit and bluesy wisdom as with this anti-heist movie, a canny rejoinder to the glamorous high drama of the traditional robbery-gone-wrong plot.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMaterialists \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCeline Song’s directorial debut “Past Lives” was Oscar nominated for best picture and best original screenplay, but the Academy did not fall as hard for her latest “Materialists” despite its buzzy release last summer. The movie was also the rare indie to cross the $100 million mark at the worldwide box office in 2026. Headlined by Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal, the film centers on a New York City matchmaker caught in a love triangle between her deadbeat ex-flame and a millionaire new guy. Variety gave the film a positive review, writing: “It’s a sharp and serious social romantic drama full of telling observations about the way we live now, and about how connected that is (or not) to the way we’ve always lived. And there’s a dark side to it. It’s ‘Sex and the City’ filtered through a sobering reality check.” \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMickey 17\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tBong Joon Ho made history at the Oscars when “Parasite” became the first non-English language movie to take home the best picture prize. His follow-up, “Mickey 17,” couldn’t even find traction in the best visual effects race despite its sleek futuristic setting. Based on the 2022 novel “Mickey7” by Edward Ashton, “Mickey 17” stars Robert Pattinson as an “expendable,” a clone that is sent on fatal missions colonizing an ice planet and then “reprinted” with most of his memories intact every time he dies. The supporting cast includes Mark Ruffalo, Steven Yeun, Naomi Ackie and Toni Collette.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tPerhaps it’s not the best “Mission: Impossible” movie, but Tom Cruise still delivered a dazzling action spectacle with “The Final Reckoning” that deserved contention in the best original sound race at least.  Starring Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg and more, “The Final Reckoning” picks up in the wake of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning,” as Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his globetrotting team of agents continue their mission to destroy the Entity, a mysterious and all-powerful AI, before it falls into the wrong hands.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Naked Gun\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tComedies rarely get recognition from the Oscars, especially when they are as goofball as Liam Neeson’s delightfully silly “The Naked Gun” reboot.

Shot on 35mm film in black-and-white, the film stars Guillaume Marbeck as Jean-Luc Godard, Aubry Dullin as Jean-Paul Belmondo and Zoey Deutch as New Wave darling Jean Seberg. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOn Becoming a Guinea Fowl \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tRungano Nyoni earned rave reviews for “On Becoming a Guinea Fowl.” The official synopsis reads: “On an empty road in the middle of the night, Shula stumbles across the body of her uncle.

The duo star as lifelong buddies whose friendship is tested over the course of a zany day where they are forced to come up with rent money or face eviction. From Variety’s review:  “The movie is a likably bent portrait of a community whose residents revel in their energized dysfunction, which is never so cartoonish that it can’t inspire an honest laugh.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Phoenician Scheme\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe Oscars have mostly avoided Wes Anderson movies since the high of “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” which earned nine nominations, including best picture, and won four Oscars. Yes, Anderson’s “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar” won the Oscar for best live action short film, but his features such as “The French Dispatch” and “Asteroid City” were completely rejected by the Academy. Now added to that list is “The Phoenician Scheme,” which is headlined by “One Battle After Another” Oscar nominee Benicio del Toro.

Variety’s review of the threequel called it the sharpest “Knives Out’ movie yet, adding: “Its trickiness works on a human scale, as writer-director Rian Johnson immerses us in murder logistics — and, in a playful way, the question of rationality vs. faith.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWarfare\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAlex Garland’s real-time combat thriller “Warfare” could not reach the box office heights of his last A24 outing, “Civil War,” but it’s a white-knuckle war movie that deserved more awards buzz for its bombastic sound and sharp editing.

Last week, the Minneapolis Fire and Police departments found she had been shot four times.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          The results reveal the forearm and chest gunshots were not immediately life-threatening, while the third shot to her head is what ended her life. The autopsy reportedly says the fatal shot entered near her left temple and exited the right side of her head. A fourth graze wound that did not penetrate her body was also reported.\n      \n\n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    CNN\n          \n    \n          The lawyers at Romanucci & Blandin say the independent autopsy report was performed by a “highly respected\" and credentialed independent medical pathologist, but that person's name was not released. The Chicago-based law firm was previously hired by the family of George Floyd, winning them a $27-million civil settlement with the City of Minneapolis.\n      \n    \n          As you know, Good was fatally shot while driving her Honda Pilot during a chaotic incident when ICE agents surrounded her vehicle in traffic on a residential Minneapolis street on January 7. Ross, an ICE training officer, fired the fatal shots. He has not been accused of a crime, and the Trump administration has said he shot her in an act of self-defense. Unnamed administration officials claim he was treated for internal bleeding at a hospital.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Renee Nicole Good\n              \n                          \n                Jonathan Ross\n              \n                          \n                ICE\n              \n                          \n                Politics\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

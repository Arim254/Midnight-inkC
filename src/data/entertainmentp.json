    "body": "\n\tDuring a recent appearance on the “So True with Caleb Hearon” podcast, co-director Lilly Wachowski was asked about certain right-wing groups attaching their ideologies to her 1999 sci-fi masterpiece “The Matrix.” Wachowski said she’s unbothered by conservative misinterpretations and knows how to separate herself from her films once they’re released to the public.\n\n\t“You have to let go of your work. People are gonna interpret it however they interpret it,” Wachowski said. “I look at all of the crazy, mutant theories around ‘The Matrix’ films and the crazy ideologies that those films helped create and I just go, ‘What are you doing? No! That’s wrong!’ But I have to let it go to some extent … You’re never gonna be able to make absolutely every person believe what you initially intended.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Matrix,” specifically the iconic “blue pill or red pill” scene, is the most famous example of the film being appropriated by the right. In the scene, Keanu Reeves’ Neo must take the red pill in order to be freed from the Matrix. In the political context, “red pilled” is a term for someone who has “woken up” to the truth about society and often aligns with radical far-right ideology.\n\n\n\tWachowski has previously explained that the “original intention” of “The Matrix” was to be a transgender allegory. Even so, she said she’s unsurprised the right has latched on to the film since “right-wing ideology appropriates absolutely everything.”\n\n\tShe added, “They appropriate left-wing points of view and they mutate them for their own propaganda, for their own to obfuscate what the real message is. This is what fascism does. And so, of course, that’s going to happen.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKanya Iwana, an Indonesian multidisciplinary artist making her feature directorial debut, has “Ibu” selected for the JAFF Future Project, about three generations of women wrestling with inherited identity in 2011 Yogyakarta.\n\n\tThe Indonesia-U.S. co-production, directed by Iwana and produced by Zack Rice through production company Feed You Films, is among 10 titles selected for the JAFF Future Project at this year’s JAFF Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. \n\t\n\n\t“Ibu” follows Maya, a formidable Javanese woman who once dreamed of becoming a writer but subsumed her ambitions under obligation and tradition. Now a widow, she parents through manipulation disguised as protection, resenting her daughters for chasing freedoms she was taught she could never claim.\n\n\n\tHer eldest daughter Tash fled to Los Angeles years ago, juggling single motherhood with an uncertain creative career. When Maya’s husband Arief dies, Tash returns home to face not only her domineering mother but her commanding grandmother Dewi and half-sister Inez, a 16-year-old navigating the same emotional minefield Tash fled. Everything ruptures during Arief’s Seventh-Day Prayer Ceremony when Maya publicly unravels, confessing fears she has never voiced.\n\n\t“I’ve always been so interested in exploring the atlas of family dynamics, whether it is a traditional Indonesian family (often inspired by my own upbringing) or a tenuously liberal American family,” Iwana says. “As I become a parent myself and have to do a lot of inward thinking, I’ve become more inspired to explore narratives that surround the complications of parenting — to break generational curses while maintaining valuable customs.”\n\t\n\n\tThe director is inspired not just as a mother, but also as a daughter. “At 16, I moved away from home and has been away ever since,” she says. “This story mirrors so much of my feelings towards that part of my life and my experiences of homecoming: from grief to pride. Writing such strong and complex female characters as the core of ‘Ibu’ has become somewhat of a beautiful, nostalgic, and healing process.”\n\n\t“‘Ibu’ illustrates the nuances of how loss, traditions, and stigma can lead to generational trauma,” Iwana says. “It explores the consequences violent secrets can have as they are kept from each other in a family unit. ‘Ibu’ zeroes in on our protagonist, Tash, as she works towards escaping that trauma — although it catches up to her.”\n\n\tBreaking the cycle isn’t always smooth and perfect. “Her desperation to break that cycle actually puts her in the position she wants to avoid, which is a flawed but relatable human experience,” she says. “Breaking the cycle isn’t always smooth and perfect, but the journey to giving yourself grace is a beautiful one. At the end of the day, ‘Ibu’ showcases an array of different textures that spotlight the same thing: the desire to be loved.”\n\n\tProducer Rice adds, “I launched Feed You Films with my producing partner, Christine Woods, to champion debut features from experienced directors who have the craft and vision — but haven’t yet been given the support or resources to make their first feature. Kanya Iwana is exactly the filmmaker we built this company for.”\n\n\tRice was first introduced to Iwana through her work as a photographer and commercial director. “She demonstrated a singular aesthetic and a cinematic eye that touches your soul,” he says. “But it wasn’t until I read her screenplay for ‘Ibu’ that I truly understood the scope of her talent. The honesty and emotional precision in her writing floored me.”\n\n\tTo validate the vision, Feed You Films produced a proof-of-concept short titled “Home.” “Kanya once again exceeded every expectation,” Rice says. “She arrived prepared, intentional, and completely in command of her set — capturing every shot she needed without wasting time or resources on unneeded coverage. She led a mostly female crew with sensitivity, kindness, and total clarity, and everyone on set rallied behind her vision.”\n\t\n\n\tAt JAFF Market, the team’s top priority is securing remaining production equity to greenlight the film. “The JAFF Future Project program is uniquely positioned to connect filmmakers with investors who understand Southeast Asian stories and want to champion bold new voices,” the filmmakers say.\n\n\tThey’re also seeking distribution and sales partners who understand both the Indonesian market and international art-house space. “As the only U.S.-based filmmakers selected for the Future Project program this year, joining the Indonesian film community is essential to us,” they say. “This film can only succeed as a true cross-cultural collaboration.”\n\n\tJAFF Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution. The initiative runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta as part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPark Ki-yong, who stepped down as chair of the Korean Film Council (KOFIC) last year and directed “Motel Cactus,” which won the New Currents Award at the 1998 Busan International Film Festival, has a new project selected for the JAFF Future Project with “Ghost Island,” a supernatural thriller about parallel Cold War massacres in Korea and Indonesia.\n\n\tThe South Korea-Malaysia-Indonesia co-production, directed and produced by Park alongside Malaysian producer Ho Yuhang through production company Paperheart Sdn Bhd, is among 10 Asia-Pacific titles selected for the JAFF Future Project at this year’s JAFF Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n\t\n\n\t“Ghost Island” follows Ayu, an Indonesian woman who arrives on snow-covered Jeju Island to search for her missing husband Herman, who vanished during their honeymoon. She partners with Inho, a Korean ex-marine turned investigator, as their search leads them through motels, ferry terminals and labor agencies. Herman appears in CCTV footage, yet remains blurred and indistinct, as if the camera itself cannot capture him.\n\n\n\tWhen Inho’s grandmother relives the Jeju 4.3 massacre during a shaman ritual, Ayu feels a chilling connection between Herman’s disappearance and the island’s suppressed violence. Returning to Bali, she discovers Herman left no evidence of existence — no school records, no real family. A fortune-teller confirms her deepest fear: Herman died many years ago.\n\n\tThe devastating truth emerges: Ayu’s grandfather commanded a military garrison during the 1965-66 Bali mass killings and betrayed Herman’s village. Herman, a seven-year-old victim whose spirit has lingered for decades, seeks a descendant of the perpetrators who will finally witness the truth. Guided by shamans and fragmented memories, Ayu travels to a hidden cave where Herman’s village was slaughtered, kneeling before bones and children’s bracelets tangled in dust.\n\t\n\n\t“My interest in the Jeju April 3rd Massacre started many years ago, when discussing it was still discouraged,” Park says. “Later, I learned about the mass executions of civilians in Indonesia during 1965–66, especially in Bali. I was deeply moved by how two islands, now renowned as idyllic paradises, share nearly identical histories of violence — yet perceive and interpret it in vastly different ways.”\n\n\tWhat moved Park most was the contrast in how memories are honored. “Jeju’s wounds have finally begun to be recognized, studied, and mourned. Bali’s remain largely unspoken, hidden in fear, denial, and inherited silence,” he says. “‘Ghost Island’ emerged from that silence. I wanted to listen to what history tried to erase, and to craft a story where the unseen and the unspoken could finally surface — through love, through memory, and through the courage to witness what others felt compelled to forget.”\n\n\t“‘Ghost Island’ examines the persistence of memory and the unseen link between two haunted islands with parallel histories — Jeju in 1948 and Bali in 1965,” Park adds. “Both are idyllic landscapes scarred by state violence and silence. The film becomes a spiritual detective story where history itself is the ghost.”“The film is neither a traditional horror nor a historical drama,” he says. “It is a work of poetic realism, where landscapes evoke memories, technology uncovers remembrance, and the dead seek acknowledgment rather than revenge.”\n\n\tThe producers emphasized the project’s global significance. “The story explores two of Asia’s most silenced historical traumas — the Jeju 4.3 massacre and the 1965–66 Bali killings — without sensationalizing them,” Park and Ho say. “Instead, it turns hidden histories into a deeply human mystery about love, memory, and responsibility.”\n\n\tAt JAFF Market, the team hopes to establish the project’s identity and secure meaningful partnerships. “By debuting at JAFF, we emphasize that ‘Ghost Island’ is rooted in Asian history, culture, and cross-border storytelling,” the filmmakers say. “Our goal is to connect with partners who can enhance the project — creatively, culturally, and financially — and who share our vision of a film that honors these histories while resonating with global audiences.”\n\t\n\n\tPark served as chair of the Korean Film Council from January 2022 until stepping down last year. He previously directed “Motel Cactus,” co-scripted with Bong Joon Ho, which won the New Currents Award at the 1998 Busan International Film Festival, and “Camel(s),” which won the Regard d’Or at the 2002 Fribourg International Film Festival.\n\n\tJAFF Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution. The initiative runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta as part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJosh Brolin remembers Donald Trump before he was elected president of the United States.\n\n\tDuring a recent interview with The Independent, Brolin said he understands Trump in a different light, having “been a friend” of his before he was president. This understanding makes Brolin confident that Trump won’t try to serve a third term, a possibility that circulates in some political spheres and is occasionally elevated by Trump himself.\n\n\n\t“I’m not scared of Trump, because even though he says he’s staying forever, it’s just not going to happen,” Brolin said. “And if it does, then I’ll deal with that moment. But having been a friend of Trump before he was president, I know a different guy.”\n\t\n\n\tThe “No Country for Old Men” star met Trump around the production of “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,” Oliver Stone’s 2010 financial drama. Trump was set to appear in the film but was ultimately cut out.\n\n\tBrolin later said he found Trump’s past entrepreneurial interests “interesting,” noting his move to build major developments “in the middle of a cesspool city during the late ’70s.” However, watching him now as president, he sees his authority as “power unmitigated.”\n\n\tBrolin still had some praise for Trump, adding, “There is no greater genius than him in marketing – he takes the weakness of the general population and fills it. And that’s why I think a lot of people feel that they have a mascot in him. I think it’s much less about Trump than it is about the general population and their need for validation.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJakarta Vice Governor and veteran actor Rano Karno used a JAFF Market panel in Yogyakarta to outline a plan to position the capital as a global filmmaking hub ahead of its 500th anniversary in 2027, declaring, “It’s time,” as he called for a coordinated push to make Jakarta a film-friendly city.\n\n\t“Jakarta will be turning 500 years old in 2027. So what can we create in celebration of this?” Karno asked. Along with Andi Boediman, producer and CEO, Ideosource Entertainment, Indonesian producers’ association APROFI chair Edwin Nazir, and director Ernest Prakasa, the panel discussed the future of Indonesia’s film industry and filmmaking ecosystem – specifically in Jakarta.\n\t\n\n\tKarno proposed a thesis about ways in which Jakarta as a city can serve further purpose in filmmaking and expand its cultural experiences in its efforts of becoming a global city. “The celebration of Amsterdam’s 750th anniversary took three years to prepare, and yet we haven’t done a single thing to prepare for Jakarta’s 500th anniversary. I dream of seeing this city to be developed as a city of cinema; so there’s a political duty to establish Jakarta as this.” Karno presented the idea of developing Jakarta’s urban identity through its cinema experiences, naming the set of aspirations as “Jakarta: City of Cinema.”\n\n\n\tKarno explained that in efforts to fulfil such aspirations the city has to go through a series of collaborative processes. It began with the presence in Jakarta city of several film related events internationally such as Cannes Film Festival, Busan International Film Festival, and a strategic partnership with Motion Pictures Association Asia-Pacific. Jakarta also hosts various film screening events such as Jakarta Film Week and Jakarta World Cinema.\n\t\n\n\t“By definition of the law, Jakarta holds the position as the nation’s economic epicentrum and global city,” he said. Taking an understanding of what makes a global city, Karno defined Jakarta’s potential in becoming one through making the city film friendly. The program is intended to promote Jakarta as a city worth investing in for films through its various locations revitalized for shooting potentials, and to screen films and expand various film related events.\n\n\tBoediman presented his research findings regarding the Indonesian film industry. “I spoke to many filmmakers and people who work in film in order to understand how to better the policy of filmmaking in Indonesia,” Boediman said. “The Indonesian market is looking amazing right now. There’s 65% of market share in the local film industry as of last year, compared to just 45% back in 2019. Indonesia currently sits in the world’s top 10 list of local film market shares.”\n\n\t“In 2016, Indonesia received a Negative Investment List which provided a great impact in the policy of filmmaking here. It gave green light for foreign investment in film – expanding massively the viewership within a year. It continued to grow each year up until the pandemic, but also experienced post-crisis recovery,” he added.\n\n\tBoediman also mentioned the role of Indonesian film institutions across the industry as it reflected coordinated fragmentation. Due to overlapping mandates, informal coordinations, and politically driven restructuring, it in turn creates temporary programs and shifting priorities that hinder sustained implementation and long term policy continuity.\n\n\tHe believes the institutional model for sustainable industry coordination should be centered to a local film commission to operate as the coordinator of a regional film ecosystem. This idea runs similar to the program Jakarta’s government is proposing with a film committee, designated to support and facilitate film productions on ground regionally. Both programs presented aims to develop the creative industry, specifically in film to create a sustained interconnectivity of film and culture into the everyday lives of Indonesians.\n",

    "description": "\n\tIndonesian filmmaker Adriyanto Dewo has a new psychological horror project selected for the JAFF Future Project with “Evil Underground,” about estra",
    "body": "\n\tIndonesian filmmaker Adriyanto Dewo has a new psychological horror project selected for the JAFF Future Project with “Evil Underground,” about estranged sisters trapped in a mall basement.\n\n\tThe Indonesia production, directed by Dewo and produced by Perlita Desiani and Tina Arwin through production company Relate Films, is among 10 Asia-Pacific titles selected for the JAFF Future Project at this year’s JAFF Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n\t\n\n\t“Evil Underground” follows a group of teenagers who gather for a midnight horror screening at an old, decaying trade center. Among them are sisters Dian and Mirna, still estranged after their father’s death sent Dian into a mental-health retreat. After the film, a friend dares them to try a viral ritual in the mall’s lowest basement: five circles at midnight, headlights off, a simple mantra.\n\n\n\tNothing happens until the final loop ends with a violent jolt, and when they step out to check, Dian has vanished into the darkness. As they search for her, the basement warps into a looping, psychological trap where shadows whisper, corridors repeat and an entity mimics the dead, feeding on their buried guilt. To survive, the group must confront the secrets, tensions and betrayals they’ve long avoided, because the deeper the darkness grows, the more it hunts whatever they refuse to face.\n\n\tFor Dewo, the story comes from two personal experiences. “Years ago, my partner and I were briefly stuck in the basement level of a mall parking lot. She has claustrophobia, and I watched her fear escalate in a very real, visceral way,” the director says. “That moment made me realize how a familiar place can suddenly feel threatening and disorienting.”\n\t\n\n\tThe second inspiration came from something more emotional. “As we grow older, we start hearing more news about people around us passing, parents, relatives, friends,” Dewo says. “And recently, I saw two sisters close to me lose their father. They reacted to grief in very different ways. Not as extreme as in the film, of course, but the contrast was striking. It made me think deeply about how people process pain differently, even within the same family.”\n\n\tThese two elements — the unsettling feeling of being lost in an urban basement, and the emotional complexity of siblings dealing with grief — came together. “That mix of personal memory, real-life observation, and the desire to explore grief through genre storytelling is what inspired ‘Evil Underground,'” Dewo says.\n\n\tThe director wants to use horror as a lens to examine contemporary youth anxiety. “We’re living in a time where young people face more pressure, anxiety, and loss than ever, yet they often hide it behind humor, distraction, or social media,” he says. “‘Evil Underground’ uses horror as a way to explore that, on how unspoken pain can twist into jealousy, resentment, and destructive behavior when it’s never addressed.”\n\n\tThe producers added, “As producers, we were drawn to ‘Evil Underground’ because it frames urgent social issues within a compelling, elevated horror concept. The project reflects the emotional climate of today’s youth, silent pressures, fractured relationships, and the growing intensity of urban life but channels it through a genre approach that feels fresh and accessible.”\n\n\tAt JAFF Market, the filmmakers aim to build strategic partnerships that will help elevate the project from a strong local project into a film with global reach. “We would like to take this event as an opportunity to start a breakthrough of Indonesia’s new flavor of horror,” the producers say. “Where we want to emphasize social issues wrapped in a terrifying psychological thriller, a genre rarely explored and tested in fear of unreliability to the market.”\n\n\tThe team is looking to connect with potential co-producers, distributors and international sales agents who share their passion for genre films with social depth. “We also hope to gain early market feedback, explore festival positioning, and strengthen the visibility of the project within the Southeast Asian and international industry network,” they say. “JAFF Market is an important platform for us to introduce ‘Evil Underground’ to the right collaborators who can help maximize both its creative and commercial impact.”\n\t\n\n\tDewo’s debut feature “Tabula Rasa” won him the Citra Award for best director at the 2014 Indonesian Film Festival. He also directed “Homecoming,” which had its world premiere at the 2019 International Film Festival and Awards Macao, and won the Citra Award for original screenplay at the 2020 Indonesian Film Festival. He has also worked in horror, directing the segment “Ghost Market” in the 2012 horror anthology “Hi5teria.”\n\n\tDewo is also attached to write and direct a remake of 1988 Indonesian horror cult classic “Lukisan Berlumur Darah” for Mandela Pictures and Relate Films, with production scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2026.\n\n\tThe project is currently in development. JAFF Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution. The initiative runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta as part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe arid plains might soon give way to something far more verdant for “Sirat” director Oliver Laxe, who is looking to the rainforest for inspiration. \n\n\t“I’m very drawn to the Amazon,” he tells Variety, pointing to “the ceremonies, the soul of the place, its rituals and its medicines” as elements he hopes to explore next. But before he starts writing, Laxe will need to pack his bags. “I need to experience it,” he explains. “I don’t turn reality into film from a distance; it has to be lived. It has to be felt.” \n\t\n\n\tFor now, he’ll have to wait, as he’s currently deep into an awards campaign that has taken him all the way to the Marrakech Film Festival. Still, Laxe’s brief stay in Marrakech feels like something of a homecoming for a filmmaker who lived in Morocco for more than a decade, who launched his career out of Tangier, and who wrote his Cannes-winning “Sirat” — Spain’s submission for the international feature Oscar — with the Atlas Mountains, the Ziz Valley and the oasis of Erfoud in mind. \n\n\n\t“I’m very drawn to that landscape as well,” he says. “It’s a tectonic landscape from the formation of the planet, a landscape that puts you in your place. You feel small but serious at the same time.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Sirat’ \n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnd yet, as anyone familiar with the harrowing, existential “Sirat” might expect, Laxe prefers to stay rooted in the present — which, at the moment, means seeing his promotional-turned-awards campaign through to the end. \n\n\tThe journey has been long. Since Cannes, Laxe has spent all but two weeks on the road, and the strain is beginning to show. \n\t\n\n\t“The level of intense connection with the audience gives me peace,” he says. “It tells me, ‘Okay, you’re on the right path.’ But yes, I’m tired. And yes, I have no time for meditation. Yesterday, I was with [‘The Secret Agent’ director] Kleber Mendonça Filho [selected by Brazil as its Oscar candidate], and we were saying that we’re starting to lose objects. You leave the hotel thinking you checked everything, and suddenly you realize your computer is still on the table.\n\n\t“I’ve lost clothes, jackets,” Laxe adds. “We’re starting to lose things and it’s only December. I don’t know how far I’ll make it, but Kleber will certainly go until March.” \n\n\tDoes Laxe hope to join his newfound friend at the Oscar ceremony on March 15?\n\n\t“Inshallah,” he grins. \n",

    "body": "\n\tImani Smith, a former child actor who starred in “The Lion King” on Broadway, was found dead on Dec. 21, according to a press release from Middlesex County, N.J., Prosecutor Yolanda Ciccone and Chief Thomas Bryan of the Edison Police Department. She was 25.\n\n\tPolice responded to a 911 call reporting a stabbing at 9:18 a.m. on Dec. 21. Upon arrival, they found Smith with stab wounds and transported her to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. After an investigation, Edison police arrested Jordan D. Jackson-Small, 35, without incident and charged him with first-degree murder, second-degree endangering the welfare of a child, third-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, and fourth-degree unlawful possession of a weapon. \n\t\n\n\tAccording to the press release, Smith and Jackson-Small knew each other prior to the incident. Smith’s aunt, who started a GoFundMe to raise money for their family, wrote that Jackson-Small was Smith’s boyfriend. He is being held at the Middlesex County Adult Correctional Center.\n\n\n\t“Imani had her whole life ahead of her,” her aunt wrote. “She was a vivacious, loving and fiercely talented person. A true triple-threat performer, she most notably played the role of Young Nala on Broadway in Disney’s ‘Lion King’ — an experience that reflected the joy, creativity, and light she put into the world.”\n\n\tAccording to Playbill, Smith played young Nala in “The Lion King” from Sept. 27, 2011, to Sept. 23, 2012. Her mother, Monique Rance-Helper, is a hair stylist who has worked on the “In the Heights” film, FX’s “Pose” series and Broadway shows “Eclipsed” “Once on This Island,” “The Lightning Thief” and more.\n\t\n\n\tSmith is survived by a 3-year-old son, her parents and her her two siblings.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSean “Diddy” Combs has filed an appeal for his 50-month sentence, claiming that the court handed down an excessive punishment in his federal trial and asking for his “immediate release” from prison.\n\n\tIn the 84-page appeal, filed yesterday and reviewed by Variety, attorney Alexandra A.E. Shapiro argued that Combs’ 50-month sentence was greater than it should have been, laying the blame at the feet of Judge Aran Subramanian and stating that he “acted as the thirteenth juror.” The appeal stated that Subramanian defied the jury’s verdict and found that Combs “coerced,” “exploited” and “forced” his girlfriends to have sex and led a criminal conspiracy, which “trumped the verdict.”\n\t\n\n\t“Defendants typically get sentenced to less than 15 months for these offenses — even when coercion, which the jury didn’t find here, is involved,” reads the appeal.\n\n\n\tCombs was initially convicted in July on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, and was acquitted of the more serious racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that carried heftier sentences. At his sentencing in October, Subramanian made it clear that Combs’ violence would be a factor in his decision, citing the video of the 2016 incident where he attacked his former girlfriend, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura.\n\n\t“The same power you used to hurt women, you can use to help them,” he told Combs during the sentencing. “I’m counting on you to make the most of your second chance.”\n\n\tShapiro also argued in the appeal that the conviction should be reversed because Combs’ sexual interactions and filming of said acts were protected by the First Amendment, an argument Subramanian had previously rejected.\n\t\n\n\tCombs is currently serving out his sentence at New Jersey’s FCI Fort Dix with a projected release date set for May 2028.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrank Darabont was still new to retirement when Netlix released the first season of “Stranger Things” in 2016. He had wrapped his final directing gig — the 2013 “Mob City” episode “Red Light”— and moved with his wife to California’s Central Coast, where he could bask in the wake of an incredible filmography that included “The Shawshank Redemption,” “The Green Mile,” “The Mist,” episodes of “The Walking Dead,” “The Shield,” “Tales from the Crypt” and more.\n\t\n\n\tAbout a decade into retirement, however, Darabont received a call from his agent, informing him that Matt and Ross Duffer, the creators of “Stranger Things,” were fans of his work. The feeling was mutual, as Darabont and his wife had binged the Netflix series’ first four seasons several times over. The agents set up a friendly meeting between them when the Duffers were still developing the show’s fifth and final season.\n\n\tShortly thereafter, Dan Trachtenberg, who was attached to direct two episodes of “Stranger Things 5,” dropped out due to a scheduling conflict with his next film, “Predator: Badlands.” In a Hail Mary, the Duffers offered Darabont to take Trachtenberg’s place, and after a week’s consideration, he decided to come out of retirement to join the “Stranger Things” team on set.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWinona Ryder as Joyce Byers and Noah Schnapp as Will Byers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDarabont, 66, directed Episodes 3 and 5 of the final season. Episode 3 released in with Volume 1 on Nov. 26. Titled “The Turnbow Trap,” the episode is packed with action and emotion in the Upside Down and the Rightside Up, showcasing a triumphant return for the director. Episode 5, titled “Shock Jock,” will kick off the three-episode second volume on Dec. 25. (The “Stranger Things” series finale releases in theaters and on Netflix Dec. 31.)\n\t\n\n\tBetween the volumes, Variety spoke with the director to hear about his experience working on “Stranger Things” and his return to the filmmaking craft after twelve years since he last sat in the director’s chair.\n\t\n\t\tWe heard that you were a fan of “Stranger Things” before you met the Duffer brothers. How did you get into the show?\t\n\n\tMy wife and I were fans of the show from early on. We actually had watched all four seasons three or four or maybe even five times. It was so good. Then one day out of the blue, my agent called me and said, “The agent in the office next to me represents the Duffer brothers, and he just wanted me to tell you that they’re big fans of yours.” I said, “That’s fantastic. That’s very flattering. I’m big fans of theirs.” So I thought, “Well, next time I’m in L.A., I’ll get together with them for lunch and just compliment them.” I also was fascinated to know where the heck they came from, because I never heard of the Duffer brothers before they created this huge success on Netflix. So I had lunch with them when I was down in L.A. and I think about a week later, my agent called me again and said they’re inviting you to come direct an episode.\n\t\n\t\tAnd what was your initial reaction to that?\t\n\n\tI hadn’t done it in a while, but they said it’s like riding a bicycle: You don’t forget. And they were right. From the first moment on set, there was nothing unfamiliar about the process for me, though it had been about 13 years. The one episode offer wound up being two episodes and six months in Atlanta. It was a hell of a great experience.\n\t\n\t\tThe Duffer brothers told us that you took about a week to consider the offer. What was going through your mind during that week and what made you want to accept?\t\n\n\tWell, once you’re retired, it’s bliss. My wife and I live on the Central Coast in Monterey, where we don’t have the pressures of Hollywood on our back. I’m enjoying life, and for once I’m no longer the workaholic that I was for almost 30 years in Hollywood. So I had to wrestle with that question and, of course, talk to my wife about it, because I wasn’t going to go to Atlanta unless she came also. I love being married, and I’m not going to be in some place for months without her. We also have five chihuahuas that we would have to take. It was kind of a big move, especially once it became two episodes. We were looking at six months living in a different place. When you’re young and single, it’s not that big of a deal, but when you’re an old fart like me who has sunk roots in a community and is comfortable being an unemployed bum, you have to ask yourself “Do I really do this?” But ultimately, it was my love for the show and my wife’s love for the show that kind of overruled all those other concerns and we said, “What the heck? Let’s do it!” I’m glad we did.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNatalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhile you were considering, were you allowed to read the scripts for the episodes that you would direct?\t\n\n\tYeah, they had sent me the scripts and I thought they were terrific. I asked for all of the scripts that they had written thus far so I could track what was going on in the whole thing. They were very generous with sending me those, as long as it was kept under strict secrecy. They’re not quite the nuclear codes, but they’re pretty close. The fascinating thing about our culture is how much people want to dig into this stuff instead of wait to be surprised by what they see on screen. I am the ultimate no-spoilers guy. When I was in junior high, I went to go see “Soylent Green” and some asshole fellow students told me before I went in, “Oh, Soylent Green is people.” I’ve never forgiven them. It’s part of the reason why I’m not on social media and I’m also reluctant to watch trailers. Too much is given away. If I have an interest in something, I want to enjoy it fresh.\n\t\n\t\tDid you notice anything different in the process of filmmaking returning to the director’s chair after 12 or 13 years?\t\n\n\tOh gosh, yeah. Only on “Mob City” did I finally transition from film to digital, and I ended up loving it. It helps a director so much because you don’t ever have to call a cut. Whenever a director calls cut, the energy on a set dissipates. Now you can just say, “Everybody back to one” and the energy remains where it needs to be. The actors remain in the same headspace as you roll three or four takes before calling cut. I love that aspect of it. Filmmakers have so many new tools now. [On “Stranger Things”] our DP was shooting with a techno crane, which can sometimes be frustrating, but can do brilliant things. Also the camera operator is no longer where you’d think he is. He’s not by the camera anymore, but often in some tent off to the side. Same with whoever’s pulling focus. They’re longer next to the camera all the time. So much has been outsourced to these technological devices. But I have to praise this crew. They were absolutely wonderful across the board. A director’s relationship with their crew is very important to me, especially the DP and AD, and I had great on both. Brett Jutkiewicz was my DP and Lisa Rowe was my AD, and they were both fantastic. The Duffers know how to crew up a show, and some of these folks had been with them since Season 1. There were so many resources all around me that could help answer any question. It was a great, collaborative vibe.\n\t\n\t\tEpisode 3 has lots of emotional scenes, including heavy dialogues between Will (Noah Schnapp) and Joyce (Winona Ryder), Will and Robin (Maya Hawke) and Holly (Nell Fisher) and Henry (Jamie Campbell Bower). What was it like working with this ensemble to create those dramatic dynamics?\t\n\n\tI’ve always said that if you have the right actor, there’s not much that they need to hear from a director. I learned that on my very first theatrical feature, “The Shawshank Redemption.” Sometimes a director can get too much into an actor’s ear. Tim Robbins, for example, loves conversations with the director. Morgan Freeman does not. He’s a very intuitive, very instinctive actor, and does a brilliant work. Both of them do. I remember midway through the shoot, I was talking to Morgan about whatever scene we’re going to shoot next and I could see his eyes glazing over. He was just being very polite and listening to me, so I stopped myself and said, “Morgan, you really don’t need to hear this, do you?” and he goes “No, just tell me where to stand and how to turn. That kind of stuff.” From that moment on, I let him do his job. It was a great lesson for a first-time director. Every actor is different.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDid the cast of “Stranger Things” prefer more dialogue and direction, or did most of them take control of their own performances? Or was there a mix?\t\n\n\tThey’d been doing it for so long, especially the youngsters who were around 10 when they started and now they’re young adults. They’ve been with these characters for half of their lives, so they’re pretty dialed in. There were little, physical things that needed direction, like when Dustin [Gaten Matarazzo] comes out of the van and drops this big bag of tools right in front of the lens. To have it fall exactly where the camera is going to land took a lot of practice and blocking. I think there were five takes or something. There were also things like Caleb [McLaughlin] running down the stairs after he’s thrown acetone at the Demogorgon. I needed him to pause and look back at a certain moment because I knew something was going to be added in post that needed an extra beat of time. You’re sort of doing all this calculus on set to make sure it can be cut together right. That’s usually where I get more specific and precise with an actor, but aside from that, they know their characters. As a director, my job is to provide the raw materials for what you need in the editing room and also to be head cheerleader on set. You’re cheering everybody on and encouraging them. A small bit of encouragement or recognition from the director can fuel you for another 24 hours of exhausting work\n\t\n\t\tHas this experience made you want to direct more, or are you comfortable returning to retirement?\t\n\n\tI really do love being retired. However, I also love being on a set with creative people, as long as I’m not fighting battles with some evil empire, studio, or network. I bless Netflix for being so supportive. If you have a good situation like that and it can be about the creative process, then its a pleasure. So my longwinded answer winds up being, it depends. If there’s a friendly situation and I’m excited enough about the material, then it’s certainly a possibility. I’m not ruling anything out, but it would have to be something special. “Stranger Things” was a special opportunity for me to be a small part of a very large, wonderful thing that so many people love. I’m grateful to the Duffers for that opportunity. It will always be a great memory working with them and that cast and crew. I will love seeing where their careers take them. They all have such potential and they’re such good people.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI know you don’t like spoilers, but what can we look forward to in Episode 5?\t\n\n\tI think in Episode 5 you’re gonna get some really cool stuff with Henry. I don’t think I’m really spoiling anything by saying that you can you see in Episode 3 that we’re kind of heading into his story more. It was a great thrill to do. We have a lot of good acting and good scenes that you can look forward to.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPat Finn, a veteran character actor best known for his roles on the TV comedies “The Middle,” “Ed” and “Marvin Marvin,” died Dec. 22 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 60.\n\n\tFinn had been battling bladder cancer for several years. Finn’s family issued a statement that noted the actor’s love of college football and the Chicago Bears NFL team. “They also ask you to be kind, to try and make one person’s life a little easier every day and to Bear Down. It’s what Pat would want, too.”\n\t\n\n\tFinn worked steadily in film and TV from the mid-1990s on. Early in his career, he was a member of the Second City improv troupe, where he worked with Chris Farley.\n\n\n\tFinn’s most prominent role in recent years was a recurring character on “The Middle,” the domestic comedy that ran on ABC from 2009 to 2018. He played Bill Norwood, a friendly but quirky neighbor of the Heck family at the heart of the series. On the Nickelodeon live-action series “Marvin Marvin,” which aired from 2012 to 2013, Finn played the patriarch of a family who takes in an alien teenage boy from another planet.\n\n\tThe actor’s long list of credits included guest shots on a host of notable TV series, from “Seinfeld,” “Friends” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” to “The Goldbergs,” “Two Broke Girls,” “Yes, Dear” and “The Bernie Mac Show.” His film work included “Dude, Where’s My Car,” “Funky Monkey,” “I Love You, Beth Cooper,” “It’s Complicated” and “Selfie Dad.” He was also featured in commercial spots for H&R Block, DiGiorno Pizza and Toyota and the milk industry’s “Got Milk” campaign.\n\n\tBorn in 1965, Finn grew up in Wilmette, Ill. He graduated from Marquette University in 1987 with a degree in speech. Farley, who went on to fame in “Saturday Night Live” and movies but died of a drug overdose in 1997 at age 33, was a classmate and rugby teammate of Finn.\n\t\n\n\tAfter college, Finn worked in improv out of Chicago and joined the touring company of Second City. His big boost in TV came with a series regular role on “The George Wendt Show,” which lasted only eight episodes on CBS in 1995. Finn and “Cheers” alum Wendt played bachelor brothers who ran an auto repair shop in Madison, Wisconsin. From 1995 to 1997, Finn had a recurring role on CBS’ “Murphy Brown.”\n\n\tOther TV roles on Finn’s long resume include “Caroline in the City,” “That 70s Show,” “The King of Queens,” “Third Rock From the Sun,” “According to Jim,” “Less Than Perfect,” “The Drew Carey Show,” “My Boys,” “The Suite Life of Zack and Cody” and “Wizards of Waverly Place.”\n\n\tFinn also worked as an adjunct professor and taught Improv for Strategic Communication at University of Colorado, and he taught at his alma mater, Marquette. “He loved sharing the joys of improv and the gospel of ‘yes, and’ with anyone who was willing to learn,” the Finn family said.\n\n\tFinn is survived by his wife of 35 years, Donna Crowley Finn, and three children, Cassidy, Caitlin and Ryan.\n",

She opens the video by talk-singing the chorus of “All by Myself” before launching into a parody of the Grinch’s monologue about his schedule from the Jim Carrey-led 2000 film “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.”\n\n\n\t“The nerve of those Whos, inviting me down there on such short notice. Even if I wanted to go, my schedule wouldn’t allow it!” she says, holding in her lap a small dog wearing antlers like the Grinch’s dog, Max. “4:00 — exercise my voice. 4:30 — wake my children up. 5:00 — solve world hunger. Tell no one. 5:30 — jazzercize. 6:30 — dinner with me. I can’t cancel that again! 7:00 — wrestle with my creative ideas.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’m booked!” Dion continues. “Of course, if I bumped my creative ideas to 9:00, I’ll still have time to lay in bed and scroll TikTok videos endlessly. Or I can just simply wish everyone a merry Christmas and a happy new year… boring!” She closes the video by beginning to sing “All by Myself” again: “When I was young, I never needed anyone.”\n\n\t“All by Myself” was originally released by singer-songwriter Eric Carmen in in 1975 and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Dion released her famous cover of the ballad as a single ahead of her 1996 album “Falling into You.” It remains one of hre biggest hits in the U.S. to this day.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tA woman named Molly Watts has paid tribute to late actor James Ransone, who died on Sunday, and revealed that he had once saved her from being sexually assaulted while they were neighbors.\n\n\t“I found out yesterday that @jamesransone died,” Watts wrote on Instagram. “I’m usually private but I want to publicly say I am so grateful that this man existed and don’t know if the trajectory of my life would be the same if he hadn’t.”\n\n\n\tIn her Instagram post, Watts wrote that she had lived in the same building as Ransone in Chinatown and that he had once saved her from an assailant.\n\t\n\n\n\t“I was attacked at the threshold of our building. I screamed for help. No one came. My attacker put his hands around my throat so I would stop making noise. I couldn’t breathe. I remember the certainty that I was going to die or be raped as I was choked unconscious. PJ heard my screams and ran to help. He came running shirtless, carrying a bat or pipe — I’m not sure which, because I never saw him in action. He scared my attacker, who ran. PJ chased him to the building he fled to. Because of the chase, the police were able to identify him, a repeat sexual offender. PJ saved me. I’m not sure if I would have the same life if he hadn’t run down that night.”\n\n\tShe continued, “Even as an adult, I’m not sure how I would have handled the weight of what could have happened or how long it would take to heal — I was already emotionally fragile. What’s especially hard for me with PJ’s passing is that he lived with that kind of violence. What I was spared, he endured in a different form, at an age where there is no emotional defense, and the self is still forming. I get the sense that PJ’s life was haunted by what happened to him then. This world is rarely gentle to people who are hurt, vulnerable, acting out.”\n\t\n\n\tRansone died by suicide on Dec. 21 at age 46. He was known for playing Ziggy Sobotka on “The Wire” and adult Eddy Kaspbrak in “It: Chapter Two.” His other recent credits included “Black Phone 2,” “V/H/S/85,” “Small Engine Repair,” “What We Found,” Poker Face,” “Seal Team,” “50 States of Fright” and “The First.”\n\n\t“Over the years, I have thought of PJ from time to time,” Watts added. I wanted to reach out to him to let him know how grateful I was that he ran towards my screams. I didn’t. I regret that.” She also shared a GoFundMe link to help raise money for Ransone’s family\n",

    "description": "\n\tForeboding title aside, one could reasonably begin watching Charlie Polinger’s “The Plague” and assume that it is a Y.A. coming of age drama— a mode",
    "body": "\n\tForeboding title aside, one could reasonably begin watching Charlie Polinger’s “The Plague” and assume that it is a Y.A. coming of age drama— a modern-day “The 400 Blows” or a male “Welcome to the Dollhouse” about a group of teenaged boys spending their summer at a sleepaway water polo camp. However, as the film progresses, not only does its narrative get increasingly sinister, but the look and feel of the film subtly lull the audience away from a vivacious security and into the darkest psychological realms of early adolescence.\n\t\n\n\tBecause of the movie’s water polo camp setting, much of it takes place in and around an indoor pool. Anyone who has been to a YMCA in the early morning knows the harsh fluorescence of these environments. Accordingly, the film’s first two acts are brightly lit, appearing almost sterilized at times.\n\n\n\tIn the opening shot, the camera is fully submerged in the pool, introducing the first of many underwater shots as the boys jump into the water, their legs kicking around and disrupting the aquatic stillness. While the swimming pool’s chlorine-washed blue is unmistakable, cinematographer Steven Breckon says that he and Polinger were trying to avoid cliched underwater shots. “The classic underwater shot is a perfume commercial with a woman in flowy drapery clothing and there’s like a God light beam on it,” Breckon tells Variety. “That’s nowhere close to what we wanted this material to look like and we were actually kind of inspired by more of a deep focus, like a painting.”\n\n\tTo achieve the underwater shots, Breckon explains that the camera operator was beneath the surface, receiving instructions through speakers. “I could basically talk to him through a giant megaphone speaker that is placed underwater, so it was like garbled instructions and he would just nod the camera ‘yes’ or nod the camera ‘no’ to confirm that he heard me.”\n\t\n\n\tEven as the camera becomes less static, circling around the kids treading water, bobbing up and down with seeming serendipity, Breckon says that it was more carefully orchestrated than it appears. He says that the camera was “on a flotation rig that you can deflate to the perfect level where it’s sort of half in and half out. And by pushing it on the surface through those boys and having all the splashing going on, it has a very chaotic energy,” however, “it was very diagrammed out. There really wasn’t a lot of finding it in the moment because we just had to be so safe with the boys. You know, we had lifeguards on every corner of the frame.”\n\n\tThe sequence’s handheld look is complemented by its sound and score, which synchronously cuts in and out every time the camera submerges and resurfaces. “I’m pretty sure that the actual ducking of the sound of the music was done by Damien (Volpe) and Dave (Paterson) in the sound department. But I was there. I went for those sessions,” composer Johan Lenox tells Variety.\n\n\tWhile the cinematography slowly morphs from the deceptive brightness of a bildungsroman to a darkness of a horror movie over the course of the runtime, the music is consistently eerie from the beginning, cluing audiences that not all is well for this group of kids. “The music is scary, but it’s also like, insanely weird,” says Lenox. “We wanted to telegraph early that some goofy and insane shit is gonna happen.”\n\n\tThe foreboding energy is accented by music’s surreal, sometimes liminal qualities.  “You’re just hearing me wailing into this microphone,” Lenox continues, noting that while the music is strange throughout, there are subtle escalations as the movie progresses. “I don’t think there’s a string instrument in the first third or half of the movie. And then these gritty, noisy sounds from string instruments start to creep in on top of the vocals and eventually supplant them just as the fun sort of stops,” explains Lenox. “Then also there are these tense swelling drone sounds pushing into these hallways and stuff like that. I think there’s a shorter one early in the movie and then there’s like a fucking three or four minute long one by the end.”\n\n\t“The Plague”’s sight and sound does have conspicuous breaks from its sinister mold. Notably, when the kids sneak out at night partway through the film, a handheld long take captures them partying in an alley.\n\t\n\n\t“That’s probably the scene that’s the most extreme version of what I describe as ‘the sandbox,’” says Breckon. “There’re these broad strokes that were very set up and diagrammed out, but then within that, it’s just chaos, letting them go every which way. In terms of actually approaching it, I was trying my best to get us to commit to a 180 degree plus area, thinking we’ll flip around and get the other side, but the kids were going in circles and doing everything, so it very quickly became a 360 area and that posed some challenges. As a cinematographer, you want everybody to be in the back light, and you don’t want moments of too much front light. So I was trying to keep up with that scene as it was unfolding in front of us, but there was no version of me being like, ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up. This isn’t the way that I want it to look.’ Instead, it was like, ‘No, the kids are telling us what it needs to be.’”\n\n\tThe scene reaches a crescendo when one of the boys pops a CD into a boom box and an Italian pop song plays. While the song could easily be mistaken for an obscure, but fitting needle drop, it is still an original piece composed by Lenox for the film. “Let’s fucking write our own thing. Like, why not?” reflects Lenox, appreciating how that the film’s “sonic world is 90% of one thing and then this other thing that comes in. It’s intentional. It could not be more opposite to everything else. I really like it as a structure and shape.”\n\n\tThe song is titled “Corsa Notturna” and it features Italian vocals from a child. It is some of the only vocals in the soundtrack that do not belong to Lenox himself. The song returns once more at the end of the film, in a dance sequence that once again showcases innovative camera techniques.\n\n\tAs the main character dances freely, we spin with him until a unique effect takes hold and it seems as if the rotation is continuing while seamlessly cutting between the boy and his revolving prospective. Breckon, however, explains that the shot was not cut at all. The team created a rotating six-sided mirror that the actor was stationary inside of, allowing him to intermittently appear in the reverse shot while maintaining the outward-facing circular motion. \n\n\t“As he becomes part of the image, and it goes from the people looking at him to just him, he’s actually slowing down. He’s not himself spinning anymore, and he’s starting to take stock of the situation in the moment, but its contrasted by the fact that this mirror is spinning faster and faster,” says Breckon. It is a transfixing effect that closes the film, effectively encapsulating the story’s dizzying approach to self-acceptance.\n\t\n\n\tThe influences for “The Plague” are manifold. Between Breckon and Lenox, they mention taking inspiration from “Raw,” “Carrie” and “The Shining,” but also “Full Metal Jacket,” “8 ½” “The Dark Knight” and “Superbad” to shape the look and sound. The result is something wholly unique: a coming-of-age horror movie that explores the social, psychological and physical viscerality of growing up.\n\n\t“The Plague” debuted at the Cannes Film Festival in May. IFC acquired its distribution rights in August and will release the film in theaters on Dec. 24.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following piece contains plot details from “La Chica o El Mundo,” the Season 1 finale of “Pluribus,” now streaming on Apple TV.\n\n",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following piece contains plot details from “La Chica o El Mundo,” the Season 1 finale of “Pluribus,” now streaming on Apple TV.\n\n\tI have a confession to make: I love Carol Sturka.\n\n\tIn that way, I’m a lot like the hive mind that’s absorbed most of humanity in “Pluribus,” the Apple TV drama of which Carol is the star. I love Carol’s abrasiveness. I love how she responds to the end of the world not with high-minded heroism, but a self-centered defiance rooted in grief — a solipsism encouraged by how the hive mind caters to her every request. I love how Carol is tough enough to spend over a month on her own when the hive mind abandons Albuquerque rather than endure Carol’s efforts to undo their joining, but human enough to relent and give acquiescence a try in the season finale. (Humanity and its attendant flaws are in scarce supply in “Pluribus.”) I believe Carol is a truly great TV character, brought to life by a truly great TV actor in Rhea Seehorn. \n\t\n\n\tNot everyone seems to agree. “Pluribus” is the third series from Vince Gilligan, the showrunner who earned himself a permanent place in his chosen medium’s Mount Rushmore with the back-to-back triumphs of “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul.” Both those series focused on ascendant figures in New Mexico’s narcotics trade, an exciting hook that belied Gilligan’s evident fascination with the detailed gruntwork between violent confrontations. I always think of Jonathan Banks’s Mike Ehrmantraut silently disassembling his car, part by individual part, in search of a tracker over several minutes of screentime in an early season of “Saul.”\n\t\n\n\tApple’s largesse allows “Pluribus” to expand Gilligan’s purview to Las Vegas, South America and other far-flung locales, but also practice his preferred MO with a heightened focus. “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul” — particularly the latter — could be rigorous, but they also distributed that rigor across a wide-ranging ensemble. In her Gilligan-verse debut, Seehorn’s Kim Wexler was just one of many fastidious obsessives in and around the Albuquerque underworld, joining kindred spirits like Mike and chicken-slash-meth kingpin Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito). In “Pluribus,” Carol and the hive mind are pretty much all we have, give or take a few fellow survivors like gleeful hedonist Mr. Diabaté (Samba Schutte) and Manousos Oviedo (Carlos-Manuel Vesga), who spends much of Season 1 holed up in a Paraguayan storage facility.\n\n\tThat puts pressure on both Carol as audience surrogate and the viewer asked to train their attention on a single person’s response to a global cataclysm. Lengthy scenes show Carol doggedly investigating the hive’s source of nutrition (Human Derived Protein, which is exactly what it sounds like), or Manousos studying radio frequencies and noting his findings by hand. Especially in the hive’s absence, “Pluribus” is quiet, deliberate, patient — and for some, those qualities cross the line into “boring.” Writing for The New Republic, critic Philip Maciak pronounced the show “a bit of a snooze,” echoing many complaints on social media about the hive’s noisy, chaotic genesis giving way to the placidity of a status quo where almost everyone is quite literally of one mind.\n\n\tClearly, I disagree. I can point to certain objective factors in Gilligan’s defense: “Pluribus” balances out the indulgence of languid scene-to-scene pacing with sub-50 minute runtimes and a nine-episode season; the show’s visual panache works against a sense of monotony, like a dumpster-diving sequence directed by frequent Gilligan collaborator Gordon Smith that gives the grossest of tasks uncanny color and symmetry. (Cinematographers Marshall Adams and Paul Donachie seem to bask in the desert sun.) But mostly, I think how you feel about “Pluribus” comes down to how you feel about Carol, and your investment in the trajectory she takes from closeted, self-loathing romantasy author to airlifting an atom bomb onto Manousos’s doorstep.\n\t\n\n\tThe premise of “Pluribus” is abstract and allegorical by design, and Gilligan has said in interviews he prefers to leave interpretation to his audience. While the hive’s parallels to AI are uncanny — they even respond to prompts! — I’m partial to the most literal of readings. Millions of people don’t survive the process of assimilation into the hive, and Carol’s wife Helen (Miriam Shor) is one of the casualties. Carol is in mourning, and many of her most extreme, impulsive or just unsavory actions arise from that fact. So does our empathy for her.\n\n\tIn losing Helen, Carol has lost the one person on Earth who saw and accepted her for who she really was: her curmudgeonly qualities, but also the basic fact of her sexuality, which Carol hid from the public by making the romantic lead of her popular Wycaro series a man. Part of what makes the hive mind so eerie is how it’s able to provide a hollow facsimile of such intimacy. The hive absorbed Helen’s memories before she died, and deploys this knowledge in alternately earnest and manipulative ways. (Much of “Pluribus” operates from a place of ambiguity about The Joining and its consequences. That Human Derived Protein? It’s a last resort because the hive can’t kill what’s currently alive, so must make use of the dead for nutrition — no matter the species). Zosia (Karolina Wydra), the individual the hive deploys as its emissary to Carol, is chosen because she looks exactly like the romantic lead of Carol’s novels, before the character was genderbent into a man to reach a broader audience.\n\n\tThough “Pluribus” is a science fiction show, it eschews the mystery box structure deployed by so many of its genre peers. Questions remain about the hive, its motives and its mechanics, but they’re secondary to how Carol feels about the Joining and how she responds to it. For every new detail we learn about the hive, there’s a Carol-focused revelation like her painful history with anti-gay conversion therapy, which tells us all we need to know about her near-allergic reaction to the prospect of being forcibly assimilated into a dominant majority group. The hive’s unconscious natural instinct is to absorb whoever it can, and when Carol notes this fact on her whiteboard, she puts it in understandably personal terms: “Wants to CHANGE ME” — the last two words underlined. Carol’s precious safe harbor has been inverted into her worst fear, an abstract anxiety “Pluribus” renders concrete as only great horror, and horror-adjacent character studies, can.\n\t\n\n\tIn the last couple episodes of “Pluribus,” Carol’s resolve is tested, as any hero’s must be. She experiments with using the hive, as Diabaté has, to manifest her deepest desires. Carol sleeps with Zosia, asks her to use “I” pronouns instead of the hive’s preferred “we” and generally performs coupled domesticity. (Carol and Helen went to an ice hotel; Carol and Zosia go skiing.) This results in an amusing reversal wherein Manousos, who’s traveled thousands of miles in search of another skeptic, is just as appalled by Carol’s willing self-delusion as Carol once was by people like Laxmi (Menik Gooneratne), who refuses to acknowledge the obvious change in her own son. Carol is shocked out of her complacency only after learning that the hive has obtained her stem cells without her consent — from frozen eggs, so she could have a child with Helen — and could absorb her within the month.\n\n\tThe big shift in the “Pluribus” finale isn’t in our understanding of the hive, whose intentions were already shared. It’s within Carol, who chooses to ally herself with a fellow misanthrope in Manousos as unlikely saviors of mankind. I think there’s something beautiful in Gilligan employing such abundant resources, from tracking down and casting a Quechua speaker to shooting in the Canary Islands, in service of one person’s internal evolution. I also understand why it’s not for everyone — though, in my less generous moments, I’m frustrated that a story centered on a queer woman seems to get a shorter leash than Gilligan’s previous work about men doing crimes. To me, though, enjoying “Pluribus” isn’t about eating one’s cultural vegetables. It’s about enjoying a strange, absurd, uncategorizable show that’s also thoughtful and restrained. And it’s about Carol Sturka, a highly specific person whose unease with others is nonetheless broadly accessible. I’d never exchange her spiky, pushy personality for permanent affability, and I understand why she wouldn’t either.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat did CBS News management get staffers for Christmas? A memo doubling down on a controversial decision that has roiled the Paramount Skydance news unit and drawn torrents of criticism.\n\n\tIn a note to staff sent hours before the start of Christmas Eve, CBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss, president Tom Cibrowski and new senior editors Charles Forelle and Adam Rubenstein insisted a move to delay a “60 Minutes” report by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi was enacted “to make sure it is comprehensive and fair.” The signatures on the memo mark what is believed to be the first tacit appearance of a new CBS News editorial “masthead” that Weiss expects to get more entrenched in the newsgathering process at the company, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\t\n\n\t“Right now, the majority of Americans say they do not trust the press. It isn’t because they’re crazy,” the memo read. “To win back their trust, we have to work hard. Sometimes that means doing more legwork. Sometimes it means telling unexpected stories. Sometimes it means training our attention on topics that have been overlooked or misconstrued. And sometimes it means holding a piece about an important subject to make sure it is comprehensive and fair.”\n\n\n\tCBS News revealed over the weekend that a “60 Minutes” segment reported by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi and centered on the on-screen accounts of Venezuelan men deported by the U.S. to prison in El Salvador had been shelved just hours before Sunday’s broadcast. As disclosed by an email sent to colleagues by Alfonsi, the decision was made by Weiss, who insisted that Trump officials appear in the report to comment on camera, even though Alfonsi’s team had made good-faith efforts to secure response ahead of filing the report for legal review. “The public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship,” Alfonsi said in her memo.\n\t\n\n\tWeiss has, since her arrival in October, insisted without presenting evidence that mainstream media has lost Americans’ trust.  One poll, by Gallup, found just 28% of Americans have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of trust in newspapers, television and radio to report news accurately and fairly. The figure is down from 31% in 2025 and 40% five years ago.\n\n\tAnd yet, a September study from Pew Research Center showed that CBS News enjoyed the backing of 51% of U.S. adults who have at least some trust in the information they get from national news organizations. CBS was ranked on par with CNN and PBS, and just a few percentage points behind ABC News and NBC News.The recent decision “may seem radical,” the new memo said. “Such editorial decisions can cause a firestorm, particularly on a slow news week. And the standards for fairness we are holding ourselves to, particularly on contentious subjects, will surely feel controversial to those used to doing things one way. But to fulfill our mission, it’s necessary.”\n\n\tThe “60 Minutes” imbroglio grips CBS News and its parent at an extremely inopportune moment. The news unit is just days away from trying to launch Tony Dokoupil as the new anchor of “CBS Evening News,” and looks to be doing so without the weeks of pre-launch promotion such a move would normally warrant. Instead, Dokoupil will go on a barnstorming tour of the U.S. and visit many cities and towns during his first days on the air. What’s more, Paramount is engaged in a heated battle with Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, and a continuing series of gaffes under Weiss’ management casts a cloud over Paramount CEO David Ellison’s ability to manage the coropration.\n\n\tMany staffers are aghast over Weiss decision, noting that it came at the end of a long vetting process and after CBS News had already promoted the “60 Minutes” segment to the public. Indeed, many people have been able to watch the report on their own because a Canadian media outlet which airs “60 Minutes” accidentally made Alfonsi’s report available via its digital app. Should a new version of the story surface on the newsmagazine, viewers will be able to see how it was changed under Weiss’ supervision. According to people familiar with the report, Alfonsi had already made efforts to seek comment from Trump officials, and had included a video snippet from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt that offered the administration’s take on the topic.\n\n\tWeiss, a digital provocateur whose opinion site, The Free Press, was acquired by Paramount Skydance earlier this year, has cascaded through a series of unforced errors since her arrival at CBS News. The gaffes have put high scrutiny on a news operation that backs top series such as “60 Minutes” and “Sunday Morning,” but operates weekday evening and morning news programs that have long run behind rivals at NBC and ABC.\n\t\n\n\tSince her arrival, Weiss has faced pushback from the union representing CBS News staffers after asking them to lay out their job duties; nabbed conservative newsmakers and Trump administration officials for various segments for broadcast and online programming; tried to hire big-name anchors by enticing them to leave their current contracts at rival operations; and launched a new series of town halls and debates by moderating a session with conservative activist Erika Kirk that lacked support from mainstream advertisers. Bank of America has signed on as a sponsor for future editions of the series, now dubbed “Things That Matter.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tElizabeth Chan is in her 15th consecutive year of releasing a new Christmas album every year, and going through a divorce and becoming a single mom ",
    "body": "\n\tElizabeth Chan is in her 15th consecutive year of releasing a new Christmas album every year, and going through a divorce and becoming a single mom was not about to put a stop to that personal and professional tradition. She considers all 15 of those records to be reflective of where she was in the year leading up to the season, and the fact that home-and-hearth look a little different for her in 2025 is duly reflected in “Christmas Unhinged.”\n\t\n\n\tThe title of this year’s release is a reference to Hinge, which has been Chan’s post-divorce dating app of choice this past year. She could have gone with something a little cornier, because, as she jokes, “This chapter is called ‘Single Bells, Single All the Way.'”\n\n\n\tIn all seriousness, Chan says, “I felt like I could really speak to everyone that listens to my Christmas music and Christmas music lovers everywhere to understand what kind of Christmas I was having this year, and why it’s OK to live Christmas not just in, like, a snow globe of time, but as an actual living, lived experience.”\n\n\n\tPerhaps you’re familiar with Chan for the legend that has built up around her as the only artist of note to have devoted her recorded output exclusively to Christmas music, which was a hot take a decade ago, let alone 15 years into her unbroken streak. Or perhaps you became aware of her as the artist who put up a challenge to Mariah Carey, and prevailed; Carey attempted to trademark the term “Queen of Christmas,” and Chan went to court to block it, noting that she had also been using it for many years and the New Yorker had even called her that in a headline. (Carey eventually stopped further action in the trademark pursuit, leading the judge to dismiss it and leave the slogan in the public domain.) If you’re unfamiliar with any of those parts of Chan’s story, you can retrace the footprints through the snow via previous Variety articles, including this origin story.\n\t\n\n\tBut for 2025, we had a very-late-in-the-season catchup with Chan about whether “Christmas Unhinged” is officially a divorce album, and what it’s been like to return the dating field and eventually have to explain to all possible suitors just what it is that she’s known for.\n\n\tThe answer might be evident to anyone who knows you, but the question is: Why put out a Christmas album that reflects your divorce?\n\n\tThis is definitely new emotional territory for me. But if you step back and look at all 15 chapters of my life in Christmas music, what makes my Christmas music so distinctive is that at the end of the year where we’re all taking inventory of where we are in our milestones of living, I curate my albums to capture the snapshot of where I am. And if I’m getting divorced, there are millions of other people just like me, who are facing the holidays without their spouse or without their family members as they know it, or their traditions have been upended. I’m not the only one. So it’s a tremendous honor to be able to create the kind of Christmas songs that are lacking if we only hold onto “A Holly Jolly Christmas.” I can grow with my Christmas canon and share some songs that might inspire others to embrace all of the holiday season — the good, the bad and the unknown. \n\n\tWould you go so far as to call this your Christmas divorce record?\n\n\tI think that last year was more my Christmas divorce record, with the album I called “Shatterproof.” I actually filed for divorce last year and I was going through so much internal turmoil, but I wasn’t ready to share it all yet. I processed the impending end of my marriage in the last album as safely as I could process it. I only do Christmas music, but this is how I process my emotions as an artist; it’s very cathartic to me. “Christmas Unhinged” is what happens once I decided to be divorced and embark on rediscovering myself, not focusing so much on the pain of divorce, but the opportunity of becoming who I’m meant to be in the second act of my life. As a single mom, it’s a beautiful thing. You know, divorce starts very sad, but there’s so much opportunity, because once you’ve been so down, the only place you can go is up, and I’ve never felt more myself in many years than I do right now.\n\n\tYou have talked on your social media about what it’s like to date now as the Queen of Christmas and how men react to that.\n\t\n\n\tEspecially while I was dating people during the beginning of the Christmas season, which is around September, I started to get really nervous, because this is when I cannot hide this aspect of my life. First of all, I have not even dated in 20 years. So when I had to start even contemplating going out on dates again, and then downloading an app, going through hundreds and hundreds of random pictures and trying to decide, “Hey, do I wanna date you, Random Picture?,” it’s the weirdest thing in the whole world, right? And I got very, very frustrated in the process. So I ended up writing a non-Christmas song called “Love Me Right or Leave Me Alone,” which is sincerely my Hinge-dating mission-status song.\n\n\n\n\n\tAlso, I did a Beatles cover on this record, “Something,” because I feel like there wasn’t a proper female version of that song. And as I was meeting new guys and going on all these dates, I’d be like, “Oh yeah, there’s something about him.” And then I sang it for myself and I put it on Hinge as my mating call.\n\n\tYou got your Beatles on with this record, doubly, because you also covered John Lennon’s “Happy Xmas (War Is Over),” which you retitled “Happy Ex-mas.”\n\n\tI do covers only if they transform in the way that I relate to lyrics. When I got divorced, I started to really think about the lyrics to that song, and the one lyric that really helped me in the studio get through all of my pain of divorce was the lyric “War is over if you want it.” Right when you’re in the middle of a divorce, those words are so powerful. And so that is really a message to my ex-husband. Which is not the original intent of the song. But having sung it the way that I did and even retitling it “Happy Ex-Mas” — sorry, Yoko, if you’re not happy about that! — the way that it came out was super cathartic.\n\n\n\n\n\tGoing back to your dating experiences this year, what was it like to tell people what you are famous for?\n\n\tI’ve dated tons of different types of people from all ethnicities and creeds and cultures, and they get to know me as Elizabeth, and they’ll connect with me if they’re also going through divorce or if they’re single parents. But sometimes the minute that they find out I’m the queen of Christmas, it’s like a needle drops. It’s like, “What does this mean? Do you know I’m Jewish?” or something like that, and I’m like, yeah, it doesn’t matter. But it can become very challenging to people. It’s just been pure comedy.\n\t\n\n\tMaybe they imagine it’s like the Tim Allen movie, and they think they will date you and then they suddenly turn into Santa Claus and grow a big beard and belly.\n\n\tI feel like the only person who would’ve really tolerated that would’ve been the Mormon potato farmer that I dated. I don’t know how I found this guy in New York. He would’ve been OK with turning into Santa, I’m pretty sure. I went on a coffee date with a Hare Krishna…\n\n\tI was gonna ask if you had run into any Christmas fetishists who might be really turned on by that part of you.\n\n\tThere was a request from somebody who was really convinced that I should expand into Christmas OnlyFans. And I knew very quickly that this guy was not the guy for me. So yes, I encountered that guy. It was a very awkward conversation because I think he was quite serious about it.\n\n\n\n\n\tYou make it sound, though, like you’ve had fun this year, going through that process, as confounding as it is to someone coming back into the dating world in the age of apps.\n\n\tI have to step back and laugh because the whole ridiculousness of dating in this day and age is so unlike how I remember dating back in the day, where you would go to a bar and then maybe get someone’s number and start dating, and then it was just that person until it faded out. Now it doesn’t even feel like dating; it feels like a messed-up video game. The worst term we had back then was fading out on somebody. Now we’ve got rostering, we’ve got ghosting, we have submarining, we have breadcrumbing, we have all kinds of stuff. You know how in Alaska they have a thousand names for snow? In dating, there’s a thousand names for disinterest.\n\n\tWait, you are going to have to explain some of these terms, to someone who is not out in the field. “Ghosting” I get, but what were some of the others you mentioned?\n\n\t“Rosters” means when people have more than one person that they date casually… “Submarining” is not quite ghosting, which is where someone just completely goes like the Ghost of Christmas Past on you and they just disappear and there’s no explanation. Submarining is when they kind of go down into the depths of the ocean and you have no idea where they are, and then like maybe a week later or two weeks later, they come back up. It’s like, “Hey, what’s up? I was just down in the ocean. Sorry I couldn’t talk to you. I was in the abyss.”\n\t\n\n\tTimes have indeed changed…\n\n\tAnd a lot of these profiles are AI-generated. I might be falling in love with robots.\n\n\tBack on the music: Do you ever consider taking a year off between Christmas albums? Or would that ruin what you’ve got going?\n\n\tNever. What, you’re asking me now, 15 years in? You could have asked me this eight years in.\n\n\tJust wondering if it’s ever been a temptation to skip a year, or like in college, taking a gap year.\n\n\tI think the closest thing to a gap year that I had was when I broke my spine and I couldn’t sing. I had a meeting with my musicians and my co-producers and managers and I let them know that I physically could not stand because I was paralyzed from the left leg down. and I couldn’t even breathe. I had no stability of my diaphragm because I had broken my L1 to L5. I was crying and my daughter was sitting next to me and she was like, “No, mommy, I’m gonna help you sing.” And then my friend Dave Eggar, when I floated around that maybe that might be the year that I wouldn’t be able to do something, was like, “There’s no way.” We always figure it out. So my team around me reminds me, “No, Elizabeth, you have a greater purpose. You must tell your story every Christmas.” I really owe it to my friends in this business who remind me that at the end of the day, I’m an artist, and as an artist, my perspective informs my inspiration, and my inspiration is through my Christmas music. They constantly remind me that what I do is very different, and they’ll hold that space for me and remind me that you’re not allowed to not celebrate a Christmas.\n\n\tIt’s like me asking you: Are you gonna skip a Christmas this year? Have you ever skipped a Christmas?\n\n\tYou know, I have not.\n\n\tNo. Right? So why would I? I mean, I know I do a little extra than you do, but I’m not gonna not celebrate Christmas, and the way that I celebrate Christmas is just the way that I celebrate it, is like, you know, producing new songs and coming up with new albums and presenting them to the world and telling my story one Christmas at a time. Why would I not want to do that?\n\n\tI got behind in thinking about the season, and I did not put any lights up till the 22nd this year, but I feel like this conversation has helped me round a corner.\n\t\n\n\tSee, my magic powers prevail. I’m sure that you know if you need some Christmas backup, all you have to do is call and ask. I am the Queen of Christmas. Like, I know some people.\n\n\tWe know you record these in the summer, but have you started thinking about next year’s Christmas record yet?\n\n\tI have, actually…\n\n\tIt could be full of love songs about the perfect person you found on the app.\n\n\tIt could be. If the fates allow.\n\n\n\n",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          According to court documents, obtained by TMZ, payments are due to start on the first of January for Bam and Nikki's 8-year-old son, Phoenix.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The papers state Nikki has agreed to provide and maintain Phoenix's healthcare coverage.\n      \n    \n          This comes after Nikki initially requested Bam pay her $15,000 per month, claiming Bam's net worth was around $55 million. But now it looks like they came to an agreement for a much lower monthly amount.\n      \n\n          The aftermath of the couple's split has been super messy. Bam previously claimed their 2013 wedding wasn't even legitimate because they said \"I do\" in Iceland ... where they were not residents, and they never did any official paperwork in the U.S.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Bam's substance issues made matters even worse. Nikki and her legal team insisted Bam's alcohol use required his contact with Phoenix to be monitored.\n      \n    \n          Now, Bam says he's sober ... which is something he says his new wife, Dannii Marie, should get credit for.\n      \n    \n          Bam told us Dannii laid down the law with him, saying if he drank alcohol, it was basically the same as cheating. The two wed in 2024.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Bam Margera\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Money\n              \n                          \n                Family\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                Kids\n              \n                          \n                Couples\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Divorce\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

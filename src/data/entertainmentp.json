    "body": "\n\tThe 2025 Red Sea Film Festival, which kicks off in Jeddah on Thursday, has started to unveil its lineup of honorees. \n\n\tNever ones to shirk away from pulling star power, the Saudi Arabian festival’s “first wave” of names includes screen icons from the U.K., U.S. and France in Michael Caine, Sigourney Weaver and Juliette Binoche. Meanwhile, French-Algerian filmmaker Rachid Bouchareb and Hong Kong action cinema legend Stanley Tong are also being honored. \n\t\n\n\tBinoche is also set to appear as part of the Kering | Women in Motion program, which includes the initiative’s first panel discussion held at the Red Sea festival this year. Launched in 2015 in Cannes, Kering | Women in Motion aims to highlight the talent and diversity of women, both in front of and behind the camera. \n\n\n\tAlongside Binoche, the panel will also include Saudi filmmaker Shahad Ameen and Palestinian-American actor and filmmaker Cherien Dabis, and will be moderated by the Red Sea’s director of international programs, Finn Halligan. \n\n\t“Each of this year’s Red Sea Honourees represents the very best of global film – artists whose work has inspired audiences around the world and added to the fabric of cinematic culture,” said Faisal Baltyuor, CEO of the Red Sea Film Foundation. “We’re looking forward to celebrating their extraordinary contributions during our fifth edition of the festival this year and fostering conversations that will offer meaningful insight and inspiration to our filmmakers, our audiences, and the region’s rapidly evolving film community.”\n\n\tThe Red Sea yesterday revealed some of the names taking part in In Conversation sessions this year, with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Adrien Brody and Sean Baker currently confirmed. \n",

    "body": "\n\tNew Europe Film Sales has secured world rights for “Clout,” the Oscar- and BAFTA-qualifying short film from Jordan Murphy Doidge starring “Jojo Rabbit” breakout Archie Yates. \n\n\tWritten and directed by Doidge, “Clout” follows 13-year-old Oskar (Yates), whose “desperate pursuit of attention spirals into something sinister,” according to the short’s synopsis. Described as “Black Mirror” meets “Stand by Me,” the short examines issues of “identity, vulnerability and the dark side of coming of age online.”\n\t\n\n\tNew Europe’s shorts catalogue has included over 15 Oscar-shortlisted films, including the 2017 best live-action short winner “Sing” and 2019 nominee “Weekends.” They have also repped shorts by Ruben Östlund, Magnus von Horn, Niki Lindroth von Bahr, Laura Moss, Hlynur Pálmason, Reka Bucsi, Jonas Odell and more. \n\n\n\t“Clout” had an Oscar-qualifying premiere at HollyShorts in Los Angeles and has since launched a sold-out U.K. tour of the film in partnership with Everyman cinemas. Alongside Yates, the short stars Anna Wilson-Jones (“Black Mirror”), Nadine Marshall (“Tatami”) Samuel Leakey (“Gretel & Hansel”) and newcomers Obi Laughton Oleforo and Ashwin Chandrasekaran, as well as Kit Price, a model and actor with more than 1 million TikTok followers. \n\n\t“New Europe is proud to bring ‘Clout’ to the world stage,” said Nela Zielińska, head of shorts at New Europe Film Sales. “Doidge has crafted a film that captures the zeitgeist with emotional depth and cinematic precision. We believe it will resonate strongly with festival programmers, platforms and audiences worldwide.”\n\t\n\n\t“Clout” is produced by Francis Chapman (Sundance grand jury prize winner for “In the Summers”) and co-produced by Lindsay Cullen. The filmmakers have also partnered with the U.K. charities Family Lives, The Mix, Into Film and Arts Emergency to lead post-screening discussions surrounding youth mental health and digital harm.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix is gearing up for the Dec. 16 return of hit reality cooking competition “Culinary Class Wars” with the release of its main trailer, as anticipation builds for the sophomore season of the unscripted series.\n\n\tThe trailer launch comes as excitement mounts for the show’s return. The format made history last year as the first Korean reality series to top Netflix’s Global Top 10 (Non-English TV) list for three consecutive weeks. The show also earned recognition as “the most beloved series among Korean viewers” in Gallup Korea’s September 2024 survey.\n\t\n\n\tThe first season was widely credited with revitalizing Seoul’s dining scene, which saw increased restaurant bookings and renewed interest in the city’s culinary talent.\n\n\n\tSeason 2 introduces new rules and heightened competition, including the return of two masked contestants seeking redemption. The format retains the signature blind tastings that became the show’s calling card, with judges evaluating dishes purely on flavor to eliminate bias.\n\n\tThe White Spoon lineup features two-Michelin-star chef Lee Jun and Son Jong-won, who holds one Michelin star each in Korean and Western cuisine. Venerable Sunjae brings expertise as Korea’s first master of Buddhist temple cuisine, while Hou Deok-juk contributes 57 years of Chinese cuisine experience and Park Hyo-nam offers 47 years in French cuisine. The roster also includes popular chefs Jung Ho-young, Sam Kim, Raymon Kim, MasterChef Korea Season 4 judge Song Hoon, and Hansik Battle Season 3 winner Im Seong-keun.\n\n\tThe Black Spoons return with competitors bearing colorful monikers including “Three Star Killer,” “Seochon Prince,” “Culinary Monster,” and “Barbecue Lab Director.” Newcomers “Culinary Innovator” and “Wok Rider” promise to add fresh dynamics to the competition, with hints of unexpected alliances in store.\n\t\n\n\tThe announcement comes as Korean drama “Physical: Asia” continues to hold a spot in Netflix’s Global Non-English Top 10 list for its third consecutive week.\n\n\tWatch the “Culinary Class Wars” Season 2 trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNiv Sultan, the breakout star of “Tehran,” leads the cast of a new crime thriller, “Murder at the Dead Sea,” which is produced by Yoav Gross Productions, the banner behind “Nutuk,” “Red Skies” and “Manayek.” \n\n\tKeshet International has boarded worldwide sales on the seven-part show and will introduce it to buyers at the London TV Screenings on Feb. 24. Currently in post-production and set to premiere on Keshet 12 on Dec. 22, “Murder at the Dead Sea” is created by Raz Yuvan (“Kfula,” “Hezi and Sons”), directed by Tomer Shani (“Carthargo,” “Nehama”). \n\t\n\n\tSet against Israel’s Dead Sea, “Murder at the Dead Sea” opens with the mysterious death of Sarah Hacohen, a pop icon whose body plummets from the ninth floor of a quarantined hotel during the height of the pandemic. What begins as an apparent suicide quickly unravels into a dark web of deceit, betrayal, and murder. Trapped in isolation, young police investigator Revi Shem-Tov (Sultan) must uncover the truth among a group of quarantined strangers—each hiding secrets more dangerous than the virus itself.\n\n\n\t“‘Murder at the Dead Sea’ is a high-end thriller that reinvents the locked-room mystery for today’s global audience,” said Kelly Wright, Keshet International’s managing director of distribution. “It features a stunning and exotic location, twisty plot, and an outstanding performance from Niv Sultan.” \n\n\tKarni Ziv, Keshet 12’s head of drama and comedy, adds: “We think Keshet 12 viewers are going to love this contemporary reimagining of the classic Agatha Christie whodunnit set in a COVID hotel by the Dead Sea, because it combines the taut suspense of ‘And Then There Were None’ with the cinematic storytelling of ‘The White Lotus.'”\n\t\n\n\tRecent scripted commissions by Keshet 12 include the October 7 drama, “Red Alert” which ranks as Israel’s highest-rated drama of the last decade; “Nutuk,” a gripping suspense drama where a boy’s memories of another life lead two families into the heart of a buried murder mystery; and “Save the Date,” a romantic comedy starring Tomer Capone. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “Sean Combs: The Reckoning,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tThere are many voices in the new Netflix docuseries “Sean Combs: The Reckoning,” but some of the most intriguing are two of the jurors which delivered Sean “Diddy” Combs a split verdict in court this year.\n\n\tJurors 160 and 75 both spoke as part of director Alexandria Stapleton’s project, giving intriguing information on how they interpreted the accusations against Combs in court, and how they think his celebrity might have influenced their verdict.\n\t\n\n\tCombs was on trial on charges of sex trafficking by force, transportation for the purposes of prostitution and racketeering. His New York City trial began on May 5, 2025, and the jury delivered a verdict on July 2, after three days of deliberation. They ultimately found Combs guilty on the two counts of transportation for the purposes of prostitution, but acquitted him on the sex trafficking or racketeering charges. The mixed verdict landed Combs in prison for four years, including time served — a mild sentence, considering he faced life behind bars.\n\n\n\tJuror 160, a Millennial woman, identified herself as “of that generation who basically grew up listening to the music that he was involved in. From Biggie to 112 … I even like Day26. I wasn’t a personal fan of his, but in general, the music.”\n\n\tShe said a critical part of the verdict was the actual charges brought forward. The music mogul’s violence toward his longtime girlfriend Cassie Ventura — which Diddy showed plainly in an infamous video released by CNN — was not part of the discussion.\n\t\n\n\t“[It’s] unforgivable, honestly. You can’t beat that small girl like that the way he did… [but] domestic violence wasn’t one of the charges,” she said.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Juror 75, a middle-aged man who said that before the trial he had “zero knowledge about” Combs, said he was confused about how guilty Combs could be when his Ventura had stayed in their on-and-off relationship for 11 years.\n\n\t“That was a very, very interesting relationship versus two people in love,” he said. “They are overly loved. They cannot explain. She wanted to be with him. He took her for granted. He never thought that she would leave and go. So just like both hands clapping together, you cannot clap with one hand, they both end like this. Then you get the noise”\n\n\t“The very next day, the following day [following domestic violence incidents], if you see how they’re getting back together and exchanging text messages and like nothing ever happened,” he said later in “The Reckoning.” “So now we are confused … what’s going on here? He’s beating her, and the next minute they’re going on dinners and trips. It’s like going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. That’s my answer. I mean, if you don’t like something, you completely get out. You cannot have it both ways.”\n\n\tDespite being confident about their verdict, Juror 160 knew it would be controversial.\n\n\t“When we were in the deliberation room, and we’ve come to an agreement, and we’re only saying that he’s guilty for these two counts, my words exactly were, ‘Oh S-H-I-T,'” she said.\n\n\tCombs’ camp has been vocal about their disdain for “The Reckoning,” releasing a statement on Dec. 1 saying, “Netflix’s so-called ‘documentary’ is a shameful hit piece. Today’s GMA teaser confirms that Netflix relied on stolen footage that was never authorized for release. As Netflix and CEO Ted Sarandos know, Mr. Combs has been amassing footage since he was 19 to tell his own story, in his own way. It is fundamentally unfair, and illegal, for Netflix to misappropriate that work.” Read the whole response here.\n",

    "description": "\n\tAs São Paulo-based development and training hub BrLab gears up for its 15th anniversary edition in 2026, one of Latin America’s most influential pro",
    "body": "\n\tAs São Paulo-based development and training hub BrLab gears up for its 15th anniversary edition in 2026, one of Latin America’s most influential project labs has opened submissions and unveiled a raft of changes designed to expand its reach, deepen its support for emerging talent and push sustainability up the regional agenda.\n\n\tThe 15th BrLab will run April 7-14, primarily in São Paulo, with satellite activities in Brasilia and Recife. Producers, directors and writers from across Latin America, Spain and Portugal will convene for a week of labs, market encounters and open-industry programming.\n\t\n\n\tApplications for its four 2026 workshops – BrLab Features, BrLab Rough Cut, BrLab Audience Design and the new BrLab Kids – are free and open from Nov. 12 to Dec. 12, 2025 via the lab’s website.\n\n\n\t“For us, every edition is an opportunity to identify what’s being imagined across the region,” says BrLab founder, director and curator Rafael Sampaio. “The industry trusts us with new ideas year after year.”\n\n\tFounded in 2011 and organized by Klaxon Cultura Audiovisual, BrLab has grown from a small workshop for Latin American features into a compact but influential platform, more training hub than full-blown market, yet firmly embedded in the regional calendar for projects looking to sharpen their creative and financial strategies.\n\n\tSupported by institutions such as the Ibermedia program, Projeto Paradiso and Spcine – and now Petrobras as a multi-year sponsor – BrLab receives more than 400 submissions annually, curated by a professional selection committee. \n\t\n\n\tAs of 2025, 62 features that passed through its various sections have been produced and released, 17 more are in post-production and another 10 are financed for production through 2026. By next year the tally of completed films linked to the lab is expected to approach 90.\n\n\tMany have premiered at top-tier festivals, including Cannes, Venice, Berlin, San Sebastián, Locarno, Sundance and Toronto. Recent standouts include “The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo,” which won the top prize at Cannes’ Un Certain Regard; “Levante” (Cannes Critics’ Week 2023); “Légua,” which screened at Cannes’ Directors’ Fortnight; Sundance title “Los Tiburones”; Berlinale competition multi-prize winner “Las Heiresses”; and San Sebastián Golden Shell laureate “Los Reyes del Mundo.” “The Wolf Behind the Door,” selected in BrLab’s very first edition in 2011, later bowed at Toronto and San Sebastián, announcing a new talent to track in Fernando Coimbra.\n\n\tAvoiding the Crowded Fall Festival Corridor\n\n\tStarting with this 15th edition, BrLab has permanently shifted from its traditional October slot to early April. The move is designed to avoid the crowded fall festival corridor and give projects more time to polish scripts and cuts before premiering in the back half of the year.\n\n\t“This change creates a more useful rhythm for project development,” Sampaio says. “We want our selected teams to take full advantage of the international circuit, and April positions them well to do that – especially for the Rough Cut Lab.”\n\n\tIn 2021, BrLab launched BrLab CoPro, a curated boutique co-production forum aimed at galvanizing new partnerships with Brazil and other Latin American territories. The forum invites producers, funds, sales agents and broadcasters looking to structure cross-border packages at a time when co-production has become essential for financing and circulation.\n\n\tThis platform is deepening BrLab’s role as a connector not only of talent but of the institutional and industrial players that can actually get films made.\n\n\tFlagship Labs and Audience Design\n\n\tThe program’s backbone remains BrLab Features, focused on fiction features from Latin America plus Spain and Portugal. 12 projects will receive mentorship on script, direction, production and distribution from a roster of regional heavyweights. Longtime backer Programa Ibermedia, a partner since the first edition, will once again offer participation grants to selected teams.\n\t\n\n\tRunning in parallel, BrLab Rough Cut caters to fiction and documentary features in the editing stage from across the Ibero-American world, pairing each project with an editing tutor and a small group of peers to help fine-tune the cut and position the film for festivals, sales and distribution.\n\n\tAfter an initial phase centered on Brazil, BrLab’s Audience Design program returns with a broader remit, now open to the whole of Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula. Inspired by methodologies Sampaio first encountered at TorinoFilmLab, the workshop helps teams think strategically about audiences from development onwards, mapping core and secondary viewers and plotting release paths that can combine festivals, theaters, platforms and alternative circuits.\n\n\t“In Brazil everyone talks about ‘creating new audiences,’ but for years people have become disconnected from our own cinema — they’re simply not educated to see themselves on screen,” Sampaio explained. “That’s why we need spaces like BrLab, where Latin American narratives and histories can be developed and protected, even as we keep one eye on the market, because being represented on screen is a right.”\n\n\tKids Lab in Recife\n\n\tThe biggest new innovation now announced for 2026 is BrLab Kids, a new workshop dedicated to film and series projects for children and young audiences, which will unspool in Recife. The initiative responds to what Sampaio sees as a chronic lack of specific public policy and institutional support for kids content in Brazil and much of Latin America.\n\n\t“If children don’t grow up watching Latin American stories, they won’t feel connected to our history and our cinema when they become adults,” he argued.\n\n\tProjects selected for BrLab Kids will receive tutorship from writers specialized in young audiences, including Janaína Tokitaka and Gabriella Mancini, alongside pedagogical consultants. Recife-based producer Nara Aragão will oversee production mentoring.\n\n\tFor Sampaio, the kids strand is closely linked to the audience-design push, offering a space to tackle the challenges of family titles competing with U.S. studio fare while trying to build a loyal local audience for regional stories.\n\n\tGreen Initiative With Petrobras\n\n\tBacked for the first time by Petrobras as presenting partner and lead sponsor, BrLab’s 15th edition will also launch a sustainability push. Curated by pioneering green-production specialist Ariane Ferreira, the lab has assembled Think Tank BrLab Petrobras, together with Cinema Verde Festival, an initiative to adapt emerging international eco-standards to Latin American realities and to encourage local institutions to integrate environmental criteria into film funding.\n\t\n\n\tSampaio points to new European reports and incentive schemes around greener film and TV production as a reference, but stresses that Latin America is starting from a different baseline. The aim, he says, is to convene the industry around practical steps that can be progressively adopted in the region.\n\n\t“In many cases, the only real green practices in our region are happening on big international streamer shows that arrive with their own protocols,” he says. “If we can pilot ideas in the audiovisual sector, that can also inspire changes in other parts of society.”\n\n\tCo-Production Hub in a Rebounding Brazil\n\n\tBrLab’s 15th edition comes as Brazilian cinema experiences renewed momentum. After years of funding paralysis, minority co-production schemes have been revived and Brazil is once again fast consolidating as a sought-after partner on major Latin American projects, often in combination with European finance.\n\n\t“Today, foreign projects can come to BrLab to find Brazilian minority co-producers,” Sampaio notes. “When we launched, Ibermedia was practically the only co-production avenue. Now there are multiple funds, and the lab has become a natural meeting point.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAudience design session at BrLab 2019\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBella Tozini\n\t\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “Sean Combs: The Reckoning,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tAubrey O’Day, who was picked to be in Sean ",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “Sean Combs: The Reckoning,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tAubrey O’Day, who was picked to be in Sean “Diddy” Combs’ girl group Danity Kane during the third season of “Making the Band,” has joined the voices speaking about the rap mogul’s alleged pattern of abuse during his time in the music industry in the just-released Netflix docuseries “Sean Combs: The Reckoning.”\n\n\n\tO’Day began telling her story by saying how she was treated as a member of the Danity Kane. “Diddy made it clear that I was ‘the looker,'” O’Day said. “I remember that phrase a lot. He was separating me and there was a different set of expectations from me, and I just naturally float into the grooming.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen asked when she thought her collaboration with Combs “crossed the line of becoming sexual,” O’Day said, “There are emails with pictures of his penis.” She read one of his emails out loud, which included passages like, “‘I don’t wanna just fuck you. I wanna turn you out. I can see you being with some motherfucker that you tell what to do. I make my woman do what I tell her to do, and she loves it. I just want — and like — to do things different. I’mma finish watching this porn and finish masturbating. I’ll think of you, happy face. If you change your mind and get ready to do what I say, hit me. Happy face. God bless, Diddy. God is the greatest.’\n\n\t“This is your boss at your work sending you that e-mail,” she continued. “What happens in real life to anyone else? Your boss gets fired. Six months later, I was fired. I absolutely felt that I was fired for not participating sexually, but I also found out later that [fellow Danity Kane member] Dawn [Richard] and Puff were recording a different project. I was the star of the show, and Puff needed to move that entire audience over to a new project.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen asked about individual accusations in “Sean Combs: The Reckoning,” Combs’ legal counsel sent a statement to Variety, writing, “We’re not going to comment on individual claims being repeated in the documentary. Many of the people featured have longstanding personal grievances, financial motives, or credibility issues that have been documented for years. Several of these stories have already been addressed in court filings, and others were never raised in any legal forum because they’re simply not true. The project was built around a one-sided narrative led by a publicly admitted adversary, and it repeats allegations without context, evidence, or verification Sean Combs will continue to address legitimate matters through the legal process, not through a biased Netflix production.” When asked specifically about O’Day’s allegations in the docuseries, a representative for Combs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Combs’ team also released a longer statement about the project overall here.\n\n\tLater in the series, O’Day said she was informed of an affidavit that was received during the flood of civil lawsuits filed against Combs. In it, a woman alleges that she accidentally walked into a room where O’Day was “sprawled out on a leather couch, looking very inebriated. She was naked from the bottom half, and she had something over her top. Puff Daddy was penetrating in her vagina, and there was another stalky light-skinned man with his penis in her mouth.”\n\n\tAfter reading the affidavit on camera, O’Day said she is conflicted because, “I didn’t have a recollection of this.” She also stated that “I didn’t drink like that at all — I don’t drink at all, it’s never been an issue with me.”\n\n\t“Does this mean I was raped?” O’Day asked. “Is that what this means? I don’t even know if I was raped, and I don’t want to know. I don’t want to find out any more that that woman has to say. If she made it up, I would be compelled to take her the fuck down. You realize the burden that that puts on my soul for the past year, which is if I expose one victim who’s got a civil lawsuit, that gives Diddy and his legal team credit to take down everybody else as potential liars. Says Aubrey O’Day! It goes right back on my shoulders, just like that. The weight of that man and his bullshit … I will never get up from under it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNaomi Watanabe is coming to America and Canada.\n\n\tThe comedian has set dates for her “From Tokyo” North American tour. This will mark her first fully English-language tour.\n\n\t“The last few years have been full of big changes for both myself as a person and my comedy, and I can’t wait to share what I’ve been up to with audiences all around North America,” Watanabe said in a statement Tuesday. “This tour would not be possible without the love and support of my fans from the U.S., Canada, Japan and beyond. Thank you, and I can’t wait to meet friends – old and new – on the road this spring.”\n\t\n\n\tThe tour begins April 17 in Los Angeles at The Wiltern followed by 17 dates before concluding on June 13 in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\n\n\tWatanabe first garnered attention in Japan in 2007 for her sketch comedy and original characters. She eventually moved to New York City, launching her podcast “Naomi Takes America” in 2023 and a companion seven-city live tour. She made her English-language stand up debut, “Stand Up with Naomi Watanabe,” in 2024, selling out two shows at the Gramercy Theatre in New York City within an hour. She will also headline a solo sketch comedy show in Japan in 2026.\n\n\tEarlier this year, Watanabe voiced Ambassador Auva in the English and Japanese versions of the Disney-Pixar film “Elio.”\n\n\t“From Tokyo” tickets will be available starting with a Citi presale beginning Dec. 3. Additional presales will run throughout the week ahead of the general on sale at naomiwatanabe.com beginning Dec. 5 at 10 a.m. ET/1 p.m. PT.\n\t\n\n\tSee the complete list of tour dates and locations below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSonoya Mizuno, best known as an actress and star of “Ex Machina,” “Devs,” “House of the Dragon” and “Crazy Rich Asians,” has set her directorial debut. \n\n\t“Stages” is being produced by both A24 and Film4, with Mizuno’s regular collaborator Alex Garland set to produce alongside Peter Rice, Agile Films’ Myles Payne and Sam Ritzenberg.\n\n\tDetails of the project remain under wraps, but the film is said to be inspired by Mizuno’s own dance background. Alongside her acting, Mizuno trained at the Royal Ballet School. She then danced in ballet companies including English National Ballet, Dresden Semper Oper Ballet and Scottish Ballet. “Ex Machina” marked her on-screen acting debut, playing an android who performs a disco dance with Oscar Isaac. In “Devs,” also written and directed by Garland, she had the lead role as a software engineer at a quantum computer company who investigates the sudden apparent suicide of her boyfriend.\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety at the time of “Devs,” Mizuno said while she wasn’t particularly tech-savvy herself, the show confirmed and challenged her beliefs about the pervasiveness of big tech.\n\n\n\t“I remember reading the script, like, ‘I want to talk about these tech leaders who are controlling the way our society is run because our governments don’t have the structure to support how fast the industry is growing,’ and it felt like an amazing opportunity to do that,” she said.\n\n\tA24 and Film have previously collaborated on projects including last year’s Oscar winner “The Zone of Interest” and the drama “We Live in Time.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Strengthening the comedy quotient of this year’s Ventana Sur, already on the rise in the market’s centrepiece industry sections, Barcelona-based studio Filmax is bringing onto the market “Looking for Michael,” produced by Kiko Martinez, who backed Alex de la Iglesia’s “Perfect Strangers.”\n\n\tInternational buyers will be able to see the first images of the film at the Ventana Sur market in Buenos Aires. \n\t\n\n\tFilmax will be handling the international sales of “Looking For Michael.” It will introduce first images of the film at Buenos Aires’ Ventana Sur, Latin America’s biggest film-TV market. \n\n\n\tThe latest from Juana Macías, whose acerbic screwball family comedy “Just One Small Favor” was also picked up by Filmax, “Looking for Michael” sums up several market trends: It’s an uplifting take on a serious subject, and a eye-opening comedy of substance      \n\n\tPenned by Marta Libertad, a writer on Rafael Azcona adaptation “The Europeans,” “Looking for Michael” turns on  \n\n\tSonia, a young woman who’s been diagnosed with Parkinson’s. Determining to face her disease with energy and hope, rather than resignation, along with her music therapy group – whose members live with OCD, paraplegia, Parkinson’s, and autism – she embarks to find Michael J. Fox, a global icon in the fight against Parkinson’s. \n\n\t“Looking for Michael” stars Nuria Herrero, Vito Sanz (“The Other Way Around”), Paco Tous (“Money Heist”) Lorena López, Sara Robisco and Michel Noher (“La Unidad”).\n\t\n\n\tThe comedy, which also has a profoundly emotional side to it , is inspired by real events, Filmax notes. The film uses music as a vehicle of expression, autonomy and connection, exploring how art can transform lives and unite people, it added.\n\n\tThe comedy “tackles a serious subject (disability and Parkinson’s) from a wonderfully positive place and without being overly sentimental,” said Head of International Iván Díaz. “The music, sense of humour and authenticity of its characters make this a universal story, one which is able to connect with audiences of all cultures.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Looking for Michael,’ courtesy of Filmax\n\t\n\n\n",

Channing and Jenna finalized their divorce in September 2024, some six long years after the actress first filed to end their marriage.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Channing and Jenna previously decided who gets what of their assets, and even settled on a child support arrangement ... and now we get a peek into one part of how it all played out.\n      \n    \n          It took a while to get there, but Channing says he and Jenna are back on good terms finally.\n      \n    \n          US Weekly was first to report the docs.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jenna Dewan\n              \n                          \n                Channing Tatum\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Money\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Divorce\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

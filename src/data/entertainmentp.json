    "body": "\n\t“Hacks” stars Meg Stalter and Paul W. Downs had some fun on the Critics Choice Awards red carpet on Sunday afternoon as the pair donned bright orange vinyl outfits and other elements suggestive of Timothée Chalamet’s new film “Marty Supreme.”\n\n\tStalter and Downs had the crowd howling with their commitment to the bit. Downs wore a ping pong paddle on a strap, crossbag style. Stalter sported a gigantic cross necklace reminiscent of the jewelry worn by Chalamet in film. Set in the 1950s, “Marty Supreme” revolves around an everyday man’s quest to become the world champion of ping pong.\n\t\n\n\tDowns, who is also a co-creator and executive producer of “Hacks” with Lucia Aniello and Jen Statsky, said the goal was to “have fun” and enjoy themselves at the awards. “Hacks” is nominated for best comedy series and Downs is up for comedy supporting actor at Critics Choice, which recognize film and TV. Chalamet and “Marty Supreme” are also nommed.\n\n\n\t“We get to see people who make movies we love. We just thought, ‘Let’s have fun,'” Downs told Variety on the carpet as he headed into the kudos held at Santa Monica’s Barker Hangar. Downs noted that the vinyl material of his suit and Stalter’s long gown was perfect for the heavy rain that has deluged Southern California for days. \n\n\t“It’s waterproof,” he observed. “It’s really good in the rain — the water just slipped off the dress,” Stalter added.\n\n\tDowns gave “Marty Supreme” two thumbs up, saying that he “loved” the film from Josh Safdie and A24. Stalter admitted she hasn’t seen it yet even though she is friends with Chalamet’s girlfriend, Kyle Jenner. \n\t\n\n\tStalter and Jenner have a “sushi Fridays” tradition. “We go out for sushi at least once a month,” she said. Chalamet does not usually join them: “It’s girl time,” Stalter explained.\n\n\tDowns was pressed on whether Chalamet ever be invited to play a role on “Hacks.” \n\n\t“I’m not sure what he would play, but we would make room,” Downs assured. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMickey Rourke launched a GoFundMe on Sunday in hopes of avoiding eviction.\n\n\tIn December, the Oscar-nominated actor was served a notice to pay roughly $60,000 in back rent or vacate his Los Angeles home (via People). The GoFundMe, titled “Help Mickey Rourke Stay in His Home,” has raised $19,819 so far with a goal of $100,000.\n\n\t“Mickey Rourke entered American cinema like a force of nature—raw, fearless, and utterly original,” reads the donation page description. “In the late 1970s and 1980s, he wasn’t just a movie star; he was a symbol of something rare: danger paired with vulnerability, toughness paired with heart. From ‘Diner’ to ‘Rumble Fish’ to ‘9½ Weeks’, Mickey gave audiences performances that felt lived-in, not performed, and left a permanent mark on American film culture.”\n\t\n\n\tThe blurb goes on to say that after Rourke stepped away from acting for boxing, he was burdened with “lasting physical and emotional scars” and abandoned by “the industry that once celebrated him.”\n\n\t“Fame does not protect against hardship, and talent does not guarantee stability,” the description adds. “What remains is a person who deserves dignity, housing, and the chance to regain his footing.”\n\n\tRourke’s major breakout was Francis Ford Coppola’s 1983 drama “Rumble Fish.” His other notable credits include “The Pop of Greenwich Village,” “9½ Weeks,” “Angel Heart” and “Barfly,” as well as more recent films like “Man on Fire,” “Sin City” and “The Wrestler.”\n\n\tRourke was recently attached to a new independent thriller, “Mascots,” written and directed by Kerry Mondragon. However, Udo Kier, who died in November 2025, was supposed to co-star, so it is unclear how the production will proceed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile accepting the directing honor at Variety’s 10 Directors to Watch and Creative Impact Awards brunch during the Palm Springs International Film Festival, Guillermo del Toro told the up-and-coming filmmakers to never listen when “people tell you art is not important,” because that is “always a prelude to fascism.”\n\n\t“Be kind, be involved, believe in your art,” he said. “At a time when people tell you art is not important, that is always the prelude to fascism. When they tell you it doesn’t matter, when they tell you a fucking app can do art you say, if it’s that important, why the fuck do they want it so bad? The answer is because they think they can debase everything that makes us a little better, a little more human. And that, in my book, and in my life, includes monsters.”\n\t\n\n\tAlong with del Toro, who received the Directing Award for his work on “Frankenstein,” other honorees included Dwayne Johnson, who received the Creative Impact in Acting Award for “The Smashing Machine,” and Teyana Taylor, who received the Creative Impact in Breakthrough Performance Award for “One Battle After Another.”\n\n\n\tElsewhere in his speech, del Toro spoke about the “religious experience” of watching James Whale’s 1931 “Frankenstein” for the first time. Sara Karloff, the daughter of the original “Frankenstein” star Boris Karloff, was his guest at the event.\n\n\t“Sometimes the world gets so complicated, you can only explain it with the power of monsters,” he said. “We are in a time like that right now.”\n\n\tHe later added, “It’s not just the size of the screens, it’s the size of the idea. Ambition includes failure – it’s right next door to success. There are no numbers on the door. You’re going to knock on that door, and it’s going to open, and it’s either a supermodel of your dreams or your mom in curlers.”\n\t\n\n\t“Frankenstein” was released on Netflix on Oct. 17, 2025. The film stars Jacob Elordi, Oscar Isaac and Mia Goth.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChelsea Handler didn’t hold back at the 2026 Critics Choice Awards. During her opening monologue at Santa Monica’s Barker Hanger on Jan. 4, the comedian went through all the big nominees, starting early with Leonardo DiCaprio, who’s part of one of the biggest movies of the year, “One Battle After Another.”\n\n\t“Leo almost didn’t make it tonight because he was trapped on a boat in St. Barts,” Handler said, as DiCaprio laughed. “It was just like the ‘Titanic,’ but worse, because Jeff Bezos was there.”\n\t\n\n\tLast week, DiCaprio and his girlfriend, Vittoria Ceretti, were spotted with Bezos and Lauren Sánchez on a superyacht in St. Barts. While he did attend the Critics’ Choice Awards, he didn’t make the Palm Springs International Film Festival Awards Gala the night before, since he wasn’t able to fly due to FAA air traffic control issues following the attack on Venezuela.\n\n\n\tLater on, Handler brought up Paramount+’s “Landman,” first warning the crowd of a “spoiler alert” about a recent episode. “Billy Bob Thornton went full frontal,” she said. “Taylor Sheridan said it was nice to have a dick on set that wasn’t Kevin Costner.”\n\n\tShe also took a swing at Warner Bros CEO David Zaslav while discussing the blockbuster hit “Sinners.”\n\n\t“‘Sinners’ is the story of brothers who start this really fun place for entertainment, and then vampires show up, suck the life out of everybody and burn it all to the ground,” she began. “Fun fact, the original name of the main vampire was David Zaslav.”\n\n\tThe awards show marks the first of 2026 and will set the tone for awards season. On the film side, Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” leads with 17 nominations, including best picture; Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” follows closely behind with 14 nods. \n\t\n\n\tIn the TV categories, much like the Emmys, Netflix’s “Adolescence” tops the list with six nominations, with the streamer’s “Nobody Wants This” close behind with five. “The Pitt,” “All Her Fault,” “Severance,” “The Diplomat,” “Ghosts” and “Death by Lightning” all landed four noms each.\n\n\tSee the full winners list here.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere’s a scene in “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple,” Nia DaCosta’s quick-fire sequel to last year’s horror franchise returnee “28 Years Later,” that’ll likely raise more than a few laughs in cinemas. \n\n\tOn top of an English hill, surrounded by woods — and potential danger — Ralph Fiennes‘ blood-and-iodine-smeared skull collector Dr. Ian Kelson sings Duran Duran’s sun-drenched ’80s smash “Rio” while dancing hand-in-hand with Samson, the film’s hulking, mutated and entirely nude lead Alpha zombie.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s a peculiar, not to mention hilarious sight, not least for a gory genre film. But for anyone who saw Sony Pictures’ “28 Years Later,” the scene marks a remarkable development for Samson — played by 6’8″ actor and former MMA fighter Chi Lewis-Parry — best remembered as “King of the Infected” in the first outing and a ferocious monster with a penchant for ripping heads off with spines still attached (and then swinging them about like a flail). DaCosta’s movie — in cinemas Jan. 16 — is a wholly different beast to Danny Boyle’s, with wildly new characters and storylines, but it’s the personal growth of Samson — and his budding bromance with Dr. Kelson — that offers one of its main talking points.\n\n\n\t“I’m excited to see how people respond to that relationship, because it’s not something you would typically expect from these movies,” says Lewis-Parry, who notes that, having shot both films back-to-back, by the time they started on “The Bone Temple” he and Fiennes “were already mates.”\n\n\tFor the 42-year-old, who this year also appeared in “The Running Man,” “The Bone Temple” allowed him to flex his acting muscles much more than he had previously. Whereas in “28 Years Later” Samson was all Rage virus and excessive violence, this time he’s mostly seen sitting in near quiet, spaced-out contemplation (largely thanks to the oversized doses of morphine Dr. Kelson frequently injects him with).\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I’ve always been very physical, but I just never really had the chance to do something with such depth. I knew there was a huge responsibility, but it was also a massive opportunity,” he says. “I wanted to be able to turn on the Rage side, but then also immediately turn it off. So I’m glad that there’s a nice marriage of the two, but both energies exist. I knew I had to tap into something.”\n\n\tUnfortunately for Lewis-Parry, he had one of the U.K.’s most celebrated actors right next to him. \n\n\t“You’re sitting there and you don’t have much to say, and Ralph Fiennes is there Ralph Fiennes-ing,” he recalls. “And you kind of get lost in his performance. I did catch myself just watching him and thinking, ‘In fact, I’m supposed to be doing something — I need to step up!'”\n\n\tThe Duran Duran dancing scene was actually an improvisation on the part of Fiennes and not in the script.\n\n\t“There was a take where he just took my hand and was looking at me and was like, ‘Come on then,’ and I just went with it,” says Lewis-Parry. “The whole performance was Ralph’s and it was just one of those moments. We could have taken it or not, and we chose to take it and it got used. And I think that just shows the connection me and him had.”\n\n\tIt was, he acknowledges, “the most fun I’ve had naked.”\n\n\tWhich brings us to the nudity. Samson was undoubtedly one of the most talked about characters in “28 Years Later,” but it wasn’t just for his colossal build, monstrous roar or the gory manner in which he despatched any human in his path. There was also his manhood — a rather impressively-sized prosthetic that the cameras didn’t shy away from and caught the eye of many online commentators.\n\n\t“It was to be expected,” acknowledges Lewis-Parry. “I’m not mad about it — not even now. But I don’t want to take away an ounce of credibility from the immense work that everyone put into into these films. Everyone is incredible. And I don’t want Samson’s prosthetic to steal any of the shine.”\n\n\tWhile there’s plenty of new additions to be excited about in “The Bone Temple” — not least the performance of Jack O’Connell as a sadistic cult leader (particularly his scenes with Fiennes) — Samson’s prosthetic is very much on display again and quite prominently. But Lewis-Parry’s hoping whatever comedic titillation it sparked last time around will have died down — with the focus now on the filmmaking and craft.\n\t\n\n\tSamson’s full prosthetic body suit — appendage attached — took seven people around six to eight hours to fit on him each time, he claims. “So you’d start around 2 a.m., and then after 10-hour days with potential overtime, you might finish around 9 p.m.” While the prosthetic pieces were bigger in “28 Years Later,” in “The Bone Temple” — featuring more close-up shots of a (heavily sedated) Samson — he says it was “with a lot more veins, so more detail.”\n\n\tThe whole process of fitting Samson’s prosthetics and painting over them was a “tremendous workload,” he says, but it was one that had to be done more than 25 times for days requiring full-body shots (each suit, effectively glued onto him, was one-time use only). But there were also scenes where Samson was just seen from the waist up. Given the rather low temperatures where they were shooting in the North of England, Lewis-Parry says “those were great days.”\n\n\tA third “28 Years Later” film was recently given the go-ahead by Sony, with Alex Garland again writing the script and Cillian Murphy reportedly set to star. Lewis-Parry has little idea whether Samson will return — “as much as you want to know, I want to know!” — but says that, even if time’s up for one of the horror world’s most fearsome new arrivals, he’s just glad to have gotten to play a role that sparked such a reaction.\n\n\t“You do many characters and you never revisit them. But this is a character I have a relationship with — so I care about how he’s perceived,” he says. “That could be seen as silly, but I care about the characters so I care about what I’m putting into it. I really wanted him to be well received, so I’m elated that he is.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRob Reiner received an emotional tribute at the 2026 Critics Choice Awards, which took place less than a month after the director and his wife’s tragic deaths. Chelsea Handler was the host of the awards ceremony and finished her opening monologue by sharing heartfelt words about the late director.\n\n\t“Everyone in this room knows that the nicest guy in Hollywood was Rob Reiner,” Handler said. “Anyone who ever spent time with Rob Reiner knows that the minute you met him, he felt like an old friend when you were in a conversation with him. He was present, he was focused, and he was funny, and he would ask you tons of questions, whether you were discussing politics or film or the latest beauty trends. He was all in after I sent him a text thanking him for dinner a few months ago. He texted me back and said, ‘We had so much fun with you last night. Thanks for explaining so much about plastic surgery. It was very edifying.'”\n\t\n\n\tReiner and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead in their home on Dec. 14. The Oscar-nominated filmmaker of “The Princess Bride,” “This Is Spinal Tap,” “Misery” and more was 78 years old. Reiner’s son, Nick, was arrested in connection with his parents’ deaths.\n\n\n\t“Rob and Michele were tireless in their efforts to so many important causes, all stemming from one basic idea: Decency, and that we should all look out for each other,” Handler continued. “I think we can all agree that we definitely need more of that. So let’s use tonight as a reminder of that decency and as a reminder of everything Rob and Michele represented and fought so hard for.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the aftermath of Reiner’s death, many of his former collaborators issued statements honoring his legacy and friendship. A group of his closest Hollywood friends, including Billy Crystal, Larry David, Martin Short and Albert Brooks, released a joint statement in which Reiner was praised not only as “a great comic actor” but also a “master storyteller.”\n\n\t“There is no other director who has his range,” the statement read. “From comedy to drama to ‘mockumentary’ to documentary, he was always at the top of his game. He charmed audiences. They trusted him. They lined up to see his films. His comedic touch was beyond compare, his love of getting the music of the dialogue just right, and his sharpening of the edge of a drama was simply elegant.”\n\n\tReiner’s death continued to make national news when Donald Trump used Truth Social to attack the late director. The U.S. president alleged Reiner’s death was “due to the anger he caused others” from being outspokenly anti-Trump. Hollywood reacted by lambasting Trump for being cruel and insensitive. \n\n\tJimmy Kimmel, for instance, bashed Trump as “hateful and vile” for going after Reiner after such a tragic death. The late-night host added, “What we need at a time like this, besides common sense when it comes to guns and mental health care, is compassion and leadership. We did not get that from our president, because he has none of it to give. Instead, we got a fool rambling about nonsense.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs the sun started peeking through the clouds after a sudden desert deluge, the stars and filmmakers turned out for Variety‘s 10 Directors to Watch and Creative Impact Awards brunch at the Parker Hotel in Palm Springs on Sunday morning.\n\n\tThe annual event, held the day after the Palm Springs International Film Awards, honored Dwayne Johnson with the Creative Impact in Acting Award, Teyana Taylor with the Creative Impact in Breakthrough Performance Award and Guillermo del Toro with the Creative Impact in Directing Award. \n\t\n\n\tColman Domingo presented the award to Dwayne Johnson, saying, “Congratulations, my friend, you are a rock!”\n\n\n\tJohnson then told a story about his fellow honoree, del Toro, and when he attended his first Golden Globes ceremony as a presenter the year “The Shape of Water” was nominated.\n\n\tJohnson was surprised to be seated up front at “The Shape of Water” table, where he met del Toro, who was “so kind to me,” Johnson said. After del Toro won the Golden Globe for best director, he came straight to Johnson, hugged him and exclaimed, “We did it!”\n\n\t“And I went, ‘We did do it!’ and I’ll never forget that, and everyone after that was coming up to me and congratulating me,” Johnson laughed.\n\n\tJohnson was honored for playing MMA fighter Mark Kerr in “The Smashing Machine,” saying, “It changed my life in ways that I didn’t anticipate, discovering things about myself.” \n\n\tJohnson spoke about Kerr, who had overdosed twice, the toll of drug addiction and dealing with pressure. He counts 15 friends he has lost who died from drugs or suicide. He said. “This role gave me a greater level of empathy…and the realization that, you know who is really going through something right now? Everyone. We’re all going through it.”\n\t\n\n\t“This one goes out to everyone who’s going through it and who’s fighting,” Johnson concluded. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTeyana Taylor and Chase Infiniti at Variety‘s Creative Impact Awards and 10 Directors to Watch Brunch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTeyana Taylor was introduced by her “One Battle After Another” co-star Chase Infiniti, who said her role as Perfidia Beverly Hills “truly burned a hole through the screen.”\n\n\tTaylor said that 20 years into her career, being celebrated as a breakthrough “feels a little ironic.” She gave a shoutout to her two young daughters at her table, exclaiming, “Are you on your phone?”\n\n\tSpeaking about her decision to retire from music five years ago because she felt boxed in, she compared herself to a Glade plug-in scent. “Why only plug me in a bathroom, when I can make the whole room smell good?”\n\n\t“You’re going to plug me in every single outlet! I want to take up every square foot!,” she said. “There have been so many incredible directors I’ve been fortunate to work with, but none as impactful as Paul Thomas Anderson.” Taylor is preparing to direct her first feature film, she said. \n\n\tOscar Isaac introduced del Toro, saying in Guillermo’s cinema, “transformation is constant,” adding he has “redefined what genre cinema can be” and brings “poetry to horror.”\n\n\tDel Toro spoke about his “religious experience” as a child when he first saw James Whale’s “Frankenstein,” and then said he was very grateful to have Sara Karloff, daughter of the iconic “Frankenstein” star, as his guest at the brunch.\n\n\t“Sometimes the world gets so complicated, you can only explain it with the power of monsters,” he said. “We are in a time like that right now.”\n\n\t“A director has to have two skins — a thick one for the business and the world, and a thin one for their collaborators and their heart,” del Toro said, lobbing pithy quotes one after another. \n\n\t“It’s not just the size of the screens, it’s the size of the idea,” he continued. “Ambition includes failure – it’s right next door to success. There are no numbers on the door. You’re going to knock on that door, and it’s going to open, and it’s either a supermodel of your dreams or your mom in curlers.”\n\n\tHe directed his next remarks to the Variety 10 Directors to Watch table, saying, “Be kind, be involved, believe in your art. At a time when people tell you art is not important, that is always a prelude to fascism. They think they can debase everything that makes us a little better, a little more human. And that, in my book, and in my life, includes monsters.”\n\t\n\n\tVariety chief film critic Peter Debruge introduced this year’s 10 Directors to Watch, explaining that honoree Dave Green is stuck in Puerto Rico due to flight restrictions. All the filmmakers except Green and Harry Lighton were present at the brunch.\n\n\tThe directors to watch are Akinola Davies Jr. (“My Father’s Shadow”); Beth de Araujo (“Josephine”); Jan-Ole Gerster (“Islands”); Sarah Goher (“Happy Birthday”); Dave Green (“Coyote vs. Acme”); Chandler Levack (“Mile End Kicks”); Harry Lighton (“Pillion”); NB Mager (“Run Amok”); Kristen Stewart (“The Chronology of Water”) and Walter Thompson-Hernández (“If I Go Will They Miss Me”).\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPeter Debruge, left, Akinola Davies, Beth de Araujo, Chandler Levack, Walter Thompson-Hernandez, Kristen Stewart, NB Mager, Sarah Goher and Jan-Ole Gerster at the Variety‘s Creative Impact Awards and 10 Directors To Watch Brunch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner/Variety\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains light spoilers from Season 2, Episode 8 of “Landman,” “Handsome Touched Me,” which premiered Sunday, Jan. 4, on Paramount+.\n\n\tIn a series full of scene stealers, Ali Larter more than holds her own on “Landman.” Playing Angela, the larger-than-life ex-wife and current fiancée of titular landman Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton), she is often on her own sidequests alongside her mini-me daughter, Ainsley (Michelle Randolph). This season, those missions have included spending a ton of money, shopping for mansions, planning themed dinners and, in this latest episode, winning a fortune at the casino while teaching old folks from the retirement home how to win at roulette.\n\t\n\n\tIn an interview with Variety at the beginning of the season, Larter said she finds joy in playing Angela and details how show co-creator and writer Taylor Sheridan pens such a unique character — even if not all of the series’ fans embrace her.\n\n\n\t“I think it’s incredible that Taylor’s writing for a woman in her late ’40s who’s still very alive in her body, who still wants to be intimate with her husband,” Larter said. “Is that why it’s so confusing to some people? I think that Taylor is a provocateur, and we’d like to put a mirror up to certain things, so I think that’s part of it.”\n\n\tLarter also said that she meets many fans who, beyond enjoying Angela, find her to be an aspirational character.\n\n\t“I love playing a woman that’s this alive,” she said. “[Angela and Tommy] kind of feel like they’re in high school again. They’re rekindling this love story, and for me to play a woman who just doesn’t care about all the judgment of others is so freeing. I have so many women come up to me who always want to have that … they want to find that little bit of Angela in them, because we’re always asked to live within the societal norms. There’s something so delicious about playing a character who does it by her rules, who just lives her life as she wants to live it, who loves hard and free. I think it’s exciting at this point in my career and at my age to get to play someone who’s this emotionally complex and bold.”\n\t\n\n\tLarter also tracks the frustration of some fans with the early episodes of the first season, when they didn’t know that Tommy’s family would be as integral to the show as his business acumen.\n\n\t“I’ll explain it to you,” she said. “People only saw the first two episodes, and Taylor loves to throw you a hook. Nobody knew when they saw the first two episodes that our show was really about the family. So you see this beautiful arc in the first season. He knows what he’s doing and has a vision and an idea for seasons of this show. I think that when you only see one or two episodes, it’s really hard to understand the kind of work that we put in for the entire season.”\n\n\tWatch a supercut of Angela being Angela below.\n\n\n\n",

Bailey is done hiding his rare genetic disorder, which sometimes requires him to use a wheelchair ... and he hopes his bravery doesn't cost him his career.\n      \n    \n          The actor opened up in a lengthy X thread over the weekend, revealing he's been battling Congenital Myasthenia Syndrome for over five years.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He wrote, \"CMS is a genetic disease that disrupts the communication between the brain and the muscle at the 'nerve/muscle junction.' ... My muscles aren't clearly receiving all my brain's orders to do all the swell things muscles are meant to do. It's a drag.\"\n      \n\n          Bailey explained he kept the diagnosis a secret \"out of career caution\" but assured Hollywood he can still do most of the things he used to, as his wheelchair use is ambulatory.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He said, \"Much like walking my dog around the block, or helping at the store, I can still perform on my feet, limitedly. I can ambulate my way through simple 'walks and talks' with no problem. I can still rise to my feet to object to the judge, derail a town meeting, or yell at a cop for being a loose cannon. But, practically speaking, moving forward, it's time for my work, like in my life, to start skewing more wheelchair, if you will.\"\n      \n    \n          Bailey reassured he was the same guy ... just \"now with wheels.\"\n      \n    \n          In addition to playing Joe the bartender on 'Grey's,' Bailey has also appeared on \"Chicago Fire,\" \"You,\" \"Modern Family,\" \"Shameless,\" \"Scandal,\" \"All That,\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" among other hit TV shows.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Rebecca left her drug treatment facility after 37 days, including her time spent in jail. They say that's the longest Rebecca has been sober since they've known her -- but Cosmo said the last time she visited Rebecca, she knew they had lost the battle once again.\n      \n    \n          Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.\n      \n    \n          Cosmo tells TMZ ... \"She kept saying sorry, but she had made up her mind -- and she had plans to leave.\" And that Rebecca just isn't ready and willing to seek treatment for her drug addiction.\n      \n    \n          A video uploaded to TikTok January 1 showed Rebecca telling a fan she spent New Year's Eve wandering train tracks after being sold bad drugs.\n      \n\n          Cosmo thinks Rebecca will probably have to live on the street until she’s sick and tired of it, saying \"We did everything we could, so now it’s up to prayer and she’s basically got to hit a bottom. And since she got a taste of rehab, I know it affected her and will affect her getting high now.\"\n      \n    \n          Cosmo continues with ... \"Hopefully she’ll come back to my store ready to get sober. Until she admits to it, I’ll have to stand back.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Rebecca has to go to court in June -- possibly for the battery charge she was arrested on last year -- and Cosmo and their sponsor Ansley are emphasizing the importance for her to get back into treatment.\n      \n    \n          Rebecca's friends are pleading with fans to not enable her or give her money. Instead, they're asking to please bring her to Cosmo’s store -- Cosmo's Glamsquad -- so they can further Rebecca's treatment.\n      \n    \n          The duo tells us ... \"if any facilities think they’re a good fit that may want to scholarship her, please let us know\" and that Rebecca has expressed interest in the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation specifically.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Rehab\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

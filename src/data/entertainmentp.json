    "body": "\n\tIsabelle Huppert has boarded Natalie Musteata and Alexandre Singh’s acclaimed live-action short film “Two People Exchanging Saliva” as an executive producer, Variety has learned exclusively.\n\n\tThe absurdist dystopian short — written, produced and directed by Musteata and Singh — premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in September 2024. Produced by Paris-based Misia Films (Valentina Merli and Violeta Kreimer), the project is narrated by Vicky Krieps and stars Zar Amir (“Holy Spider”) and Luàna Bajrami (“Portrait of a Lady on Fire”).\n\t\n\n\tThe film has been a major presence on the festival circuit, earning multiple honors, including the grand jury prize at the 2024 AFI Fest, best in block at the SCAD Savannah Film Festival and both the Canal+ national and national audience awards at the Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“What Alexandre Singh and Natalie Musteata achieve in ‘Two People Exchanging Saliva’ is remarkable: a work that fuses artistic rigor with emotional sophistication,” Huppert said in a statement. “Their mutual background in the art world gives this striking and fascinating short film a rare sense of shape and purpose — every detail, every frame, every gesture carries intent. I am proud to support the emergence of such singular new voices, whose vision enriches the future of filmmaking.”\n\n\tMusteata and Singh, who are married, expressed their gratitude for Huppert’s involvement.\n\n\t“We are so honored and deeply humbled that Isabelle Huppert will be joining the team of ‘Two People Exchanging Saliva,’” the filmmakers said. “Isabelle is a true artist who has often inspired us as we conceive of characters and never more so than when we were writing our film. In films such as ‘The Piano Teacher’ and ‘Elle,’ she has explored the darker human impulses — desire, control and shame — without apology or moral judgment. These are the very themes that our film is steeped in.”\n\t\n\n\t“Two People Exchanging Saliva” is now available to stream and is distributed by The New Yorker.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRiot Games’ Maria Egan accepted Variety Hitmakers‘ first-ever Interactive Music in Media Award on Saturday afternoon, celebrating the company’s accomplishments in bridging the worlds of gaming and music.\n\n\tEgan, head of global music at Riot Games, has spent the past few years engaging the global gaming community by working with musicians, managers and record labels to bring bespoke songs to the worlds of “League of Legends” and “Valorant.” Counting collaborations with Stray Kids, Imagine Dragons and Lil Nas X, Riot has also found success with its soundtracks for “Arcane,” an animated Netflix series whose albums have earned billions of streams.\n\t\n\n\tJJ Italiano, head of global music curation and discovery at Spotify, introduced Egan by listing Riot’s accomplishments, including its recent work with G.E.M. and Anyma for the League of Legends World Championship in China.\n\n\t“At Riot Games, as you can see, music isn’t just background,” Egan told the Hitmakers crowd. “We say it’s the heartbeat of our communities. And gaming and music is at an exciting crossroads, and there are many, many innovative ways for artists to engage. But at Riot, I think we uniquely value the timeless magic of songs. They galvanize our communities across language, time, continents, they tell our stories, they expand our worlds.\n\n\t“And the amazing songwriters and artists who worked with us over the past 15 years and there are many of you in this room, you are essential collaborators in what we call the big G of our games,” she continued. “And that to us means there’s this unique ecosystem, esports, music, entertainment, fandom around our games, which makes them some of the largest and most vibrant gaming communities in the world. And as JJ said, we know our players love music deeply, and so our goal more than anything is to build partnerships that help your music reach our global audiences in new ways. We sometimes say where there’s music, there’s new memories. And so we want our players to become your fans and hold your songs in their hearts for the rest of their lives.”\n",

There’s a lot of regret, but it ends on a high note with a new family connection being forged AND one of our main characters getting laid! Read on to analyze all of this week’s big moments, from the cemetery to the bedroom.\n\t\n\n\nThe Georgia Satellites’ “Keep Your Hands to Yourself” is the perfect one-hit wonder. It makes me want to get in a bar brawl just hearing it start the episode.\nThe “Landman” team always films a convincing auto accident. What a mess!\nWhy didn’t Cooper (Jacob Lofland) sleep in his truck instead of on the ground?\n“I want you everywhere.” Ah, OK, Cooper, that’s kinda cute. You’re winning her back!\nI’m glad I’m an old married man and not on the dating scene. Ariana (Paulina Chávez) told Cooper to leave, so he left, but she wanted him to fight for her, but he didn’t because he was giving her space…I’m not saying anyone’s feelings are wrong, but just communicate directly here, people! It’s exhausting!\nOh no, now I’m worried that Dale (James Jordan) is accidentally going to OD on Adderall!\nOoh, who is this hunk sitting next to Rebecca (Kayla Wallace) on the private plane? \nNothing snarky to say about Cami talking to her husband’s grave — as usual, Demi Moore is fantastic on this show. Emmy, please!\nVery fun seeing the always-poised Rebecca lose her shit and make a scene on this turbulent flight. Plus, you gotta love some unintentional flirting!\nThe look Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton) gives when Angela (Ali Larter) suggests her “Sexy Salsa” playlist for the road trip is comedy gold.\nThornton’s knack for delivering profanity is top-tier. Please enjoy how he makes a meal out of the word “f-UCK-ing” in the phrase “We’re driving to a fucking funeral!” That’s acting!\nAngela and Ainsley (Michelle Randolph) always calling Nate “Neil” is a wonderful running gag.\nAsking, “Who are these fucking clowns?” is a great way to meet new people.\nDamn, I bet the food at a roadside place called “The Bucket” is so good. And those corn dogs would be calling my name as well…\nTommy’s story about his mother is so sad that I’d barely be able to finish my corn dogs!\nCrying while T.L. (Sam Elliott) tells the sprinkler rainbow story.\nWasted Rebecca seems like a fun hang!\nUh oh, Tommy is going to flip when he learns that Cami met with Gallino (Andy Garcia) and potentially put the company at further risk.\nObsessed with Gallino’s relationship with Bella (Stefania Spampinato). Is this the healthiest marriage that’s ever been on a Taylor Sheridan show?\nI don’t think I really understood Gallino’s snakes and hawks metaphor, but hey, they made a deal!\nWhat an awful turn for Jerrell (Elijah Collins) after that gas leak. I hope he gets better!\n“Save the Last Dance” as Ainsley’s comfort movie is a great choice.\nOh, no — this SIDS tragic backstory explains so much.\nAh, Rebecca — it’s OK that you had some fun! Embrace it!\nYay, grandpa’s moving in! Let’s shake things up!\n“I’m not sure I deserve this.” Oh, OK … one last cry before we wrap things up.\n\n\n\n\tUntil next time, comment below with your favorite thing about Rebecca’s sexy new oil guy, Charlie (Guy Burnet). It’s his array of bathroom products, right?\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis Former NHL Player Says ‘Heated Rivalry’s’ Hockey Romance Could Happen In Real Life\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrancis Ford Coppola’s F.P.

    "body": "\n\tIn 2021, Sharlto Copley (“District 9,” “The Witcher”) and Aiysha Hart (“Mogul Mowgli,” “Colette”) spent five months in a scenic desert area near the site of the futuristic city of NEOM to shoot Saudi Arabia’s first Hollywood-style tentpole movie, “Desert Warrior.”\n\n\tAlmost five years later it is now finally launching in the Middle East from the Red Sea Film Festival.\n\n\n\tThe big-budget epic, directed by British filmmaker Rupert Wyatt (“Rise of the Planet of the Apes”), is set in 7th-century Arabia and revolves around a princess (Hart) who refuses to serve as concubine to the ruthless emperor Kisra, played by Ben Kingsley, prompting an epic showdown called the Battle of Ze Qar. Copley plays the ruthless mercenary commander Jalabzeen tasked by the emperor with hunting down the proto-feminist princess and her father as they flee into the vast Arabian desert.\n\t\n\n\tThe reactions from the home crowd at the “Desert Warrior” premiere were warm and “really vocal” said Hart, speaking at the Variety Lounge presented by Red Sea Film Festival.\n\n\n\t“It’s nice to show it to an audience that understands the culture,” added Hart, who has dual British-Saudi heritage. She pointed out that the film’s story is very well-known “in this part of the world.”  “So I think there was a deeper understanding and an appreciation that was really lovely to be a part of.” \n\n\tFor Copley, being in “Desert Warrior” meant witnessing a real statement of intent from the Saudi industry. Though he did not really the feel the pressure of that, “you could definitely feel it on the production, on the director, on Rupert, on the producer and the studio trying to handle the beast of the first big film shot in the region,” he said.\n\t\n\n\t“They flew in what was a 550-something crew and 250 drove in from surrounding region, because there was no industry, so you could feel it making the movie. You could feel just the practical weight of trying to create an industry where they were, there isn’t one,” he added. \n\n\t“We had 38 nations represented on the crew, which was just wild,” Copley noted. “It was definitely the most languages that I’ve ever come across on a film [shoot].”\n\n\tShooting in the desert clearly had its drawbacks and rewards.\n\n\t“I think for me getting into the character was more a physical thing,” said Hart. “We actually started shooting around August or September, so it was still very, very hot.”\n\n\t“And, you know, we had quite heavy costumes on, with lots of layers. That’s when you realise the use of sweat. Why the body sweats. Because you sweat and then some wind comes along, and you’re like: “Oh,that’s pleasant!”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“I’ve been plugged into some sort of matrix,” Jonathan Bailey says to David Corenswet. “I feel like I’ve been slowly working on the hardware over the years, but the software has just been accidentally upgraded exponentially.”\n\n\tThe “Wicked: For Good” star is enjoying his newfound fame, but he’s struggling to make sense of it. He shares that feeling with Corenswet, who ushered in a new era of superhero movies earlier this year with “Superman,” the summer blockbuster directed by DC Studios co-chief James Gunn. Bailey, 37, and Corenswet, 32, both began acting as children of the theater and expected to have humble careers. Instead, they’ve become heartthrobs — with Corenswet’s dark hair and strong jaw earning him Clark Kent comparisons years before he booked the role and Bailey recently being crowned as People’s first openly gay Sexiest Man Alive — at the center of box office smashes. But as they marvel at their own successes and each other’s, their most profound similarity isn’t their career trajectories. It’s their earnestness.\n\t\n\n\tDavid Corenswet: I said to James Gunn, “If you wanted somebody cool, you should have hired somebody else.” And he was like, “Oh, believe me. I know.”\n\n\tJonathan Bailey: That’s a really good place to start. What is cool these days?\n\n\tCorenswet: Not caring. “It doesn’t matter what happens, because I’m cool.” That’s what cool is, and that’s why I reject it outright.\n\n\tBailey: But I think you’re cool. Because you care. “Superman” felt like a very honest version of integrity, and therefore values, and therefore cool. The hero was fallible and sees the world in a different way. The thought processes were very scientific.\n\t\n\n\tCorenswet: Scientific curiosity does take a willingness to look a little foolish by trying really hard. James is that way in life, and especially with his movies.\n\n\tBailey: When you get the call for “Superman” — presumably no one’s ever mentioned that to you before in your life, because that was a wild casting against type — must’ve been crazy.\n\n\tCorenswet: Well, when I got the audition, I was standing on a ladder changing a light fixture. My agent said, “We think you know what this is about.” I said, “Is it ‘Top Gun 3’? What am I waiting for?” I really was not expecting it, although I think other people thought that I should be expecting it. Just statistically speaking, it feels completely impossible.\n\n\tBailey: We’ve got things in common, haven’t we?\n\n\tCorenswet: Theater is one of them.\n\n\tBailey: And from a young age. How old were you when you started?\n\n\tCorenswet: I was 9 when I did my first professional play in Philadelphia. I played Bert in “All My Sons.” I had two scenes in the first act, and then I fuck off before intermission to go home to bed so I can wake up for school the next morning. One of the adult actresses, when the gunshot goes off at the end of the play, she would squeeze my shoulders. And I always thought, “I’m not sad.” I was so happy to be there. At some point my dad explained to me, “She’s not trying to comfort you. I think she’s trying to comfort herself.” I remember, as the lights came up, seeing the faces of the audience light up with relief at seeing this 9-year-old boy running out all carefree after this sad ending. That was when it struck me.\n\n\tBailey: The crackle of energy, and how it can change.\n\n\tCorenswet: That in-person, immediate impact was quite intoxicating for a 9-year-old kid. I liked school, but I didn’t understand why it all felt like “Because next year, and because next year, and then you want to get into a good school” — and it all sort of fades off in the distance. With the theater, you need to go to rehearsals, because in three weeks there’s going to be a paying audience, and if you don’t know your lines, you can imagine how that’s going to feel. It wasn’t for some other reason. It wasn’t to get the next part.\n\n\tBailey: No. It was to be there and maximize the experience with the people around you. With that in mind about theater, the performances in “Superman” are so brilliant. The long scenes with you and Rachel [Brosnahan], they play out like theater scenes.\n\t\n\n\tCorenswet: And we rehearsed them like theater. That was when I realized that I had not done a deal with the devil in taking this big role. I was actually sort of returning home. Let’s talk about “Wicked: For Good,” because I think there’s some interesting parallels here too.\n\n\tBailey: Jon M. Chu and James Gunn must’ve been in a room together. Jon was someone who, probably like James, could see it all in his head and would know how to invite the right people.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCorenswet: You would think those are antithetical. James storyboards every shot of the movie, and with a musical like that, you’ve got to have a very clear vision. But then to invite people in, not to fit your vision, but to contribute in a real way — that’s much harder. You also shot two films back to back.\n\n\tBailey: At the same time. On a Monday, you’d be shooting Dr. Dillamond’s classroom in the first film, and then on Wednesday, it would be “For Good,” the duet at the end of the second film. It’s testament to the two extraordinary women playing those two roles [Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande], because they were so locked in with Jon. It’s great when you’re playing a supporting role where you know your job is making your contribution, but mostly you don’t want to fuck up the process that’s already going on.\n\n\tCorenswet: What was your singing prep?\n\n\tBailey: Being in a film like this, you get these extraordinary experts who are there to gift you technique and time. We’ve actually trained with the same physical trainer, Paolo.\n\n\tCorenswet: I forgot we have Paolo in common. Love you, Paolo!\n\n\tBailey: If you think about your — forgive me. I assume your body wasn’t — I mean, maybe you were born Superman?\n\n\tCorenswet: No, no, no. I was what one of my high school crushes very unaffectionately described as a string bean.\n\n\tBailey: Some people are Popeye, and some people are Olive Oyl.\n\n\tCorenswet: And I was Olive Oyl. So yeah, I put on 40 pounds with Paolo.\n\n\tBailey: That’s incredible. But also, the process there, if you apply that to vocal training, you get the same [result]. For me, it’s about confidence. Those eight days of doing “Dancing Through Life” were some of the most extraordinary and toughest days I’ve had on a film set. Jon Chu had a baby, so we did one day without a director. You have to train that hard. There will be variables on the day. You might not sleep. You might have a cold. The director might have a baby. It’s so satisfying to really commit fully.\n\t\n\n\tCorenswet: And to have a good reason to put so much into it. I had always wanted to put on weight, and I would love to take singing lessons for six months, but when you’re not Cynthia Erivo or Ariana Grande, you feel like you might have a long way to go. The first couple months, maybe you don’t sound so good, or you’re not putting on so much weight.\n\n\tBailey: Trust the process. Something similar [between] “Superman” and “Wicked”: Like you said about Cynthia and Ari, it’s so easy with superhero films to go, “They’re just so talented. It’s a God-given gift.” Absolutely, yes, of course — but there’s years of honing craft.\n\n\tCorenswet: And they still have to warm up in the morning.\n\n\tBailey: Totally. Ari changed her whole tone and her voice, and Cynthia was training so that she could deliver that every single take. If it looks like it’s something that you were born to do, then you’ve done the work so well.\n\n\tCorenswet: Part of it is making it look easy.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBailey: There’s something about the values of Superman, and this version of Superman, that felt so alive and connected to the audience. Did you feel that?\n\n\tCorenswet: Yeah. It’s interesting, because there’s so many different measures of that. How do the cast and crew feel about the film? How does the director feel? The publicists, the agents and managers who get to watch it ahead of the release. The press. The screenings you do for diehard fans, people who really want to love it or have extremely high expectations and are easy to disappoint. And the people who are writing about it and who want to talk about the zeitgeist and how it fits in. And then you have the box office, which is just a measure of how many people buy tickets. You can tell a bunch of different stories depending on what you focus on.\n\n\tBailey: It’s a lot of noise, isn’t it? Because there’s only so much you have control over: the process and the making of it.\n\n\tCorenswet: When I leave set, I have done my work. To a certain extent, promoting the film is part of your work as well. But people can love the press tour and not love the film. My contribution happened a year ago when I was on set. It’s that thing of running out for my curtain call and seeing the audience’s face light up. That’s the feedback that tells you whether you’re on track or not. If my scene partner gets what they need from me, or if my director says “That was good. We’ve got it,” and even more importantly, if the crew is happy to see me — I like to put my energy there.\n\t\n\n\tBailey: It comes through on screen.\n\n\tCorenswet: Well, good. I don’t pretend to know how that happens, because so much happens between your performance and it showing up on screen. The edit. Color correction and sound design.\n\n\tBailey: I feel like you’ll probably, one day, write and direct.\n\n\tCorenswet: Probably. Do you have any interest in writing and directing?\n\n\tBailey: I’m in reverence to every person on set and every moment of the process, and actors come on set for 15% of the whole process. So it would be a great honor working with something all the way through.\n\n\tCorenswet: Is this your humble way of saying yes?\n\n\tBailey: I’m, like, wriggling nervously.\n\n\tCorenswet: I also think, as an actor, there is just a desire to be more involved. You are the last person to find anything out. And there’s a culture of protecting actors from too much information, which I think can hamstring us. I often get frustrated feeling like I want to contribute in this moment when we’re shooting the scene, but I don’t know why we’re shooting it in this room.\n\n\tBailey: There’s amazing footage of you and James having an extraordinary conversation. Obviously, this is coming with such privilege to be able to say this, but certain career paths are very restrictive. It feels entirely right to be curious all the time. And the conversation you had with James was so brilliant because — godGod, this is such a nerd thing to say, but — I always think there should be tension, but not friction. And that was such a good example. It was actually kind of vulnerable. You have to be able to make those mistakes.\n\n\tCorenswet: I love that. Tension without friction. Because friction creates unnecessary heat.\n\n\tBailey: And it’s not economic. You hemorrhage energy, whereas tension holds energy.\n\n\tCorenswet: I feel so lucky that that is on film, and it was interesting hearing from people what they thought of it — everything from, “Well, that’s what always happens,” all the way to, “What a terrible working environment.” For me, it does happen all the time. It was amazing how indefatigable James was. He very rarely got fed up with me, because I think he knew that the reason I’m having those conversations with him is, at my boldest, because I think I might see something that he doesn’t see and he might value. I never want any director to say, “Fine. If you need that, go do it.” I’m not doing it just for me. I might see something here that you actually like, and then you’ll feel like it’s yours.\n\t\n\n\tBut on the other end, I don’t know how to do a good job otherwise. I got this criticism in theater school quite a lot, and that was a good lesson to learn. As an actor you do need to let go. As a young actor, you’re sort of waiting to feel ready to make the action. There’s a practice of just, “Walk before you’re ready to walk. Just say the line before you’re ready to say the line.”\n\n\tBailey: That’s what we do as humans, isn’t it?\n\n\tCorenswet: I think we do it at our most interesting. And as actors, you don’t want to just be human. You want to be humans at their most interesting, dynamic, dramatic moments. Drama is life with all the boring bits cut out.\n\n\tLet me ask you this. Sexiest Man Alive. Where do you go from here?\n\n\tBailey: No. Okay. [Laughing nervously, he turns to the director and gestures to cut.] It was so lovely to chat. OK.\n\n\tCorenswet: “Wicked: For Good” is fucking fantastic. You fly in this movie.\n\n\tBailey: We both kiss levitating!\n\n\tCorenswet: Yes. But you have the bigger challenge. As the man, and as Sexy Man — and that’s not me saying that — which magazine does Sexiest Man Alive?\n\n\tBailey: All of them. Horse & Hound.\n\n\tCorenswet: Anyway, Sexiest Man Alive, you are carried by Cynthia. She’s levitating you. Every man out there would think there’s no way you can look masculine and powerful and in control when you’re being levitated by a woman. And you, in that moment when she’s lifting you by your fucking massive arms, maintained your masculinity. Well done, mate. Because it’s a lot easier when you’re carrying the girl.\n\n\tBailey: I mean, listen, I’d be carried by both Cynthia and Ari for the rest of my life if I could be. I was like, “Oh, shit” when I saw your kiss at the end [of “Superman”]. My favorite moment of chemistry is the chuckle.\n\n\tCorenswet: James, when I was doing that chuckle when she says, “I love you too,” he came up to me and said, “It’s not working. It needs to be solemn.” I was like, “No! The whole point is, ‘I fucking know that you love me.’” Credit to James. He was right on 90% of everything, but on that one, he saw that chuckle was a very truthful thing.\n\n\tBailey: That is what makes a leading man smash it out of the park.\n\n\tCorenswet: So how do you top Sexiest Man Alive?\n\t\n\n\tBailey: Ugliest.\n\n\t[They stand up to say goodbye.]\n\n\tCorenswet: Should we kiss or something?\n\n\tThis is a conversation from Variety and CNN’s Actors on Actors.

    "body": "\n\tThe Los Angeles Film Critics Association has convened for its 51st annual meeting to determine the year’s best achievements in filmmaking.\n\n\tLast year’s best picture winner, “Anora,” continued LAFCA’s tradition of elevating daring, artistically ambitious work that later resonates with the Academy. That lineage includes Oscar success stories such as “The Hurt Locker” (2009), “Spotlight” (2015), “Moonlight” (2016) and “Parasite” (2019) — all of which went on to capture the Academy Award for best picture.\n\t\n\n\tWhile the group is known for its adventurous taste, its instincts often align with Hollywood’s most coveted accolades. Since 2009, six LAFCA-winning filmmakers have gone on to win the Oscar for best director, including Kathryn Bigelow for “The Hurt Locker,” Alfonso Cuarón for “Gravity,” Guillermo del Toro for “The Shape of Water,” Bong Joon Ho for “Parasite,” Chloé Zhao for “Nomadland” and Jane Campion for “The Power of the Dog.”\n\n\n\tScreenplay winners have proved to be another reliable bellwether. Over the past decade, five LAFCA-honored scripts have translated those victories into Academy Award wins, among them Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” and Emerald Fennell’s “Promising Young Woman.” Only one LAFCA winner since 2009 has failed to earn an Oscar nomination: last year’s “All of Us Strangers.”\n\n\tThis year also marks LAFCA’s fourth iteration of gender-neutral acting categories.\n\n\tAs previously announced, LAFCA will honor Philip Kaufman with its Career Achievement Award. The Oscar-nominated filmmaker earned his sole Academy nod for adapted screenplay for “The Unbearable Lightness of Being,” co-written with Jean-Claude Carrière, and has left a lasting imprint through films such as “Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” “The Right Stuff” and “Quills.”\n\t\n\n\tAs the awards-season marathon accelerates, LAFCA’s selections are poised to shape the next phase of the Oscar race — spotlighting late-breaking contenders, validating festival favorites and elevating under-the-radar performers who might otherwise be overlooked. The annual banquet, scheduled for January, will celebrate all winners and mark another year of evolution for the organization.\n\n\tFounded in 1975, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association has long maintained a reputation for championing bold, uncompromising filmmaking and broadening the industry’s understanding of what constitutes excellence.\n\n\tThe list of winners will be updated below.\n\n\tBest Picture: Runner-up: \n\n\tDirector: Runner-up: \n\n\tLeading Performances: Runners-up: \n\n\tSupporting Performances: Runners-up: \n\n\tScreenplay: Runner-up: \n\n\tAnimation: “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” (GKids)Runner-up: “KPop Demon Hunters” (Netflix)\n\n\tCinematography: “Train Dreams” (Netflix) — Adolpho VelosoRunner-up: “Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — Autumn Durald Arkapaw\n\n\tEditing: “Marty Supreme” (A24) — Ronald Bronstein and Josh SafdieRunner-up: “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.) — Andy Jurgensen\n\n\tProduction Design: “Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — Hannah BeachlerRunner-up: “Frankenstein” (Netflix) — Tamara Deverell\n\n\tMusic Score: “Sirāt” (Neon) — Kangding RayRunner-up: “Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — Ludwig Göransson\n\n\tForeign Language: Runner-up: \n\n\tDocumentary/Non-Fiction Film: Runner-up: \n\n\tNew Generation Award: \n\n\tDouglas Edwards Experimental Film Prize: Albert Serra, “Afternoons of Solititude” (Grasshopper Films)\n\n\tDouglas Edwards Special Award: Thom Andersen for his body work\n\n\tCareer Achievement Award: Philip Kaufman\n\n\tSpecial Citation: \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Anora” director Sean Baker, who is at the Red Sea Film Festival as the head of the international jury, commented on the industry’s most burning current topic while speaking at the Jeddah-based event: Netflix agreeing to buy Warner Bros., including its film and TV studios, its gaming business, HBO Max and HBO.\n\n\tThe director said he “doesn’t think any of us should be commenting until we all know how [the deal] is going to play out,” but that “filmmakers have to put our foot down” when it comes to preserving three-month-minimum theatrical windows.\n\t\n\n\t“We should not be reducing theatrical windows, we should be expanding [them],” he added. “This is how the filmmaker wants you to see his film, and everybody else can wait for it. My next film, I don’t care what happens, I’m gonna get a hundred-day theatrical window. That’s a little bit over three months, and I think that’s a good place at this moment. When you’re going directly to streaming, it diminishes the importance of a film. The theatrical experience elevates the importance. The way you present it to the world is a very important thing.”\n\n\n\tBaker said he feels “hopeful” given that the biggest audience for “Anora” was Gen Z, despite a general perception that younger people don’t go for the theatrical experience these days. “That’s not true,” he said of that perception. “In L.A., when I go to movies, it’s usually Gen Z. I love that younger people are seeing the value in a communal experience and also one in which their focus is entirely on the film and not being distracted by everything else in the room.”\n\t\n\n\tThe American director, who made Oscars history earlier this year as the first person to win four Oscars in the same night for the same movie with “Anora,” said he will not “go for the next $150 million studio thing” as the next step in his illustrious career. Asked about what’s next following the Oscars prestige, he said: “The opportunities are there, whether [I’ll] take them or not, that’s the question.”\n\n\t“Honestly, I’ve been in this world for so long,” he added. We got to a place with ‘Anora’ where I was working with such an incredible team that gave it their all and believed in the guerrilla way of making a film. And the outcome was incredible, so why not try to repeat that? I’m not gonna go for the next $150 million studio thing.”\n\n\tBaker emphasized his next project will “probably be around the size” of “Anora” while also “staying in the [same] wheelhouse in terms of story and content.” \n\n\tAsked whether he had time to digest his four Oscar wins yet, the director said he only managed to properly look back at that eventful night in the last month. Within 36 hours of Oscar night, he and wife-slash-producing-partner Samantha Kwan were on a plane to Tokyo for the Japanese release of “Anora,” going straight into Cannes for the world premiere of Tsou Shih-Ching’s “Left-Handed Girl.” The film, which he produced, edited and co-wrote, premiered at Critics’ Week and went on to be picked up by Netflix. \n\n\t“There was no slowing down,” he said. “It’s a beautiful thing. We are really happy with what happened with ‘Anora’ because we never expected it. We went in thinking it was going to be the most divisive thing. When the Palme d’Or happened, that was my dream come true. I thought that was it, that was the win.” Then, while the director was on a plane back home, friends began texting telling him to “get ready for the next eight months of your life, it’s going to be crazy.”\n\n\t“I almost had a nervous breakdown on the plane because I thought it was over,” he said. “It‘s been an incredible journey with this film and an incredible outcome.”\n\n\tThe director also spoke about being the head of the international jury at this year’s Red Sea Film Festival, saying what he “loves” about festivals that have competitions is how awards have a “major impact” on films and filmmakers. “I know that from personal experience. My career wouldn’t exist without film festivals.” Baker also highlighted how “meaningful” it is that the Saudi festival hands cash prizes of up to $100,000 to its top films.\n\t\n\n\t“Independent film and film in general is a struggle, and I know my life was basically saved back in the day when I was winning cash awards when they still existed in the U.S. That’s a big thing for me,” added the filmmaker, going on to say that he “hopes” to “elevate new voices” while in the Arab region. “Whatever I can do to help. I needed help back in the day, and that’s what got me here.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLebanese director Nadine Labaki, whose “Capernaum” is the highest-grossing Arabic and Middle Eastern film of all time with over $68 million worldwide, spoke about “how difficult it is” to make cinema in the Arab region. The director also discussed working with non-actors and dealing with Arab funders during an in-depth career talk at the Red Sea Film Festival, where she is a jury member. \n\n\tAsked about dealing with Western partners and funds given the “Arab stereotypes” often perpetuated by Western media, the director said she never felt “pressured” by Western funds on how to portray her culture and stories on screen. “We are not at a stage where we can get funding from the countries where we live and work,” she said. “I received funding from the Western world because I couldn’t just have Lebanese funding. When I received this funding, including Western ones, I didn’t feel there was a specific pressure exercised on me […] I never felt I was faced with a specific agenda. I was pushed by my own obsessions even when I received Western funds.”\n\t\n\n\tThe “Back to Alexandria” actor also spoke about how she believes in the “important” role of cinema in “changing the way we look at specific issues.” “Cinema talks to us in an emotional frequency. When we embark on a new film, it can change the way we look at life. Every time I start writing a new film, I have this in the back of my mind.”\n\n\n\t“We know how difficult it is to make cinema in our region,” she added. “There is a lot of pent-up anger and a lot of injustice. This is why we feel cinema could be one of the most important tools to help us express this pent-up anger. Cinema can put issues in the spotlight, and this is a major responsibility we carry. In a number of areas, only art can make a change.” \n\t\n\n\tThe director spoke at length about her Cannes-winning, Oscar-nominated “Capernaum.” In the 2018 drama, Labaki worked strictly with non-professional actors, led by a then 12-year-old Zain al-Rafeea, to tell the story of a Lebanese boy who sues his parents for the “crime” of bringing him into the world. “In ‘Capernaum,’ something very important happened,” she said. “I was able to have people embodying these roles that come from the exact same background in real life, and knew what it felt like. They knew that pain.”\n\n\t“It was very difficult for me to ask a child to act out that pain, to experience and live it when they have not been living in that same situation,” she added. “This is why I chose to work with Zain. He was going through a very difficult time and started feeling like he was part of the movie, like his voice was the voice of all the children he had met in real life. When you’re trying to talk about such deep suffering, you can’t do the regular make-believe we do in cinema. The regular make-believe world can not be transposed into such stories when you’re talking about cruelty and pain.”\n\n\tWorking with an entire cast of non-professional actors meant adjusting the filmmaking process itself, with Labaki saying that “Capernaum” felt like the “complete opposite” of her previous experiences directing films. “When you are filming a movie, normally you have a sense of pausing life. You create an entire set with an entire decoration and artifacts, but in ‘Capernaum,’ it was the complete opposite. We were the ones who had to sneak into their world. We were the intruders coming from outside.” \n\n\t“We wanted the actors to feel our presence as little as possible because it’s very stressful,” she went on. “You can’t ask a child to memorize and regurgitate written scripts, to look at the lights and be real and authentic. It’s incumbent on you to adapt to their personality and deal with whatever the child is giving you.”\n\n\tAs for what is next, Labaki said it is “very probable” that her next directorial effort “won’t be focused on Lebanon. “I will be filming in many other countries, not only in Lebanon and not just in the Arab region,” she added.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAudiences returned to Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza in force, turbocharging a traditionally sleepy post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office. \n\n\t“Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” the second film inspired by Scott Cawthon’s popular horror game franchise, easily captured first place, opening to $63 million domestically. That topped projections that had the film debuting between $35 million and $40 million, though it does pale in comparison to the $80 million that “Five Nights at Freddy’s” launched to in 2023. What made that result all the more impressive was that the first film simultaneously debuted in theaters and on Peacock. It went on to gross nearly $300 million on a $20 million budget.\n\t\n\n\tStill, “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” is an undeniable win for Universal, which released the film, and for Blumhouse-Atomic Monster, which produced the picture and really needed it to work after slogging through an uncharacteristic rough patch. Blumhouse-Atomic Monster is one of Hollywood’s biggest hitmakers, producing everything from “The Purge” movies to “Get Out,” but the company’s had a bruising 2025, releasing duds like “M3GAN 2.0,” “Wolf Man” and “Drop.” With last October’s hit, “Black Phone 2,” and now “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” Blumhouse-Atomic Monster seems to be turning a corner. “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” is also the latest video game adaptation to connect with audiences, joining the likes of “A Minecraft Movie” and “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.”\n\n\n\t“These video game adaptations are slaying at the box office,” says Jeff Bock, an analyst with Exhibitor Relations.  “They have captured the attention of a younger generation of moviegoers like no other genre.”\n\t\n\n\t“Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” was made for a lean $36 million, so it will be very profitable for the studio. Josh Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail and Piper Rubio return for the sequel, which follows a former pizzeria night guard who must face off against an array of animatronic killers. Emma Tammi, who directed the first film, was behind the camera for the follow-up. Internationally, “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” earned an estimated $46 million from 76 markets, including Mexico, the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Spain, Germany, Italy and France. That brings its global total to $109 million.\n\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2,” which dominated the Thanksgiving box office, settled for second place, earning a sizable $43 million. The animated sequel is already one of the year’s biggest hits, having earned $220.5 million domestically and $915.8 million globally. It should easily top $1 billion in ticket sales.\n\n\tAnother hit sequel, “Wicked: For Good,” captured third place with $15.6 million in its third weekend of release. That pushes its domestic gross to $295.8 million through Sunday. \n\n\tGkids’ “Jujutsu Kaisen: Execution,” which cuts together portions of the “Jujutsu Kaisen” anime series, debuted to an estimated $10.2 million, securing fourth place on the charts. Lionsgate’s “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” rounded out the top five, earning $3.5 million to bring its domestic haul to $55.3 million. \n\n\tOn the indie front, Sony Pictures Classics released “Merrily We Roll Along,” a filmed version of the hit Broadway production of the Stephen Sondheim musical, which debuted to $1.2 million on 1,084 screens. The show starred Jonathan Groff, Daniel Radcliffe and Lindsay Mendez and won the Tony for best musical revival. Bleecker Street debuted “Fackham Hall,” a parody of stiff upper lip period films, in 1,112 locations, where it earned $620,909. And Focus Features’ “Hamnet” expanded from 119 theaters to 744, earning $2.3 million. The acclaimed drama about William Shakespeare has earned $4.2 million since opening over Thanksgiving. It is expected to be a major Oscar contender.\n\n\tAlso of note, Quentin Tarantino’s super-sized “Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair,” which combines “Kill Bill: Vol. 1” and “Vol. 2” into one, four-and-a-half-hour epic, grossed an estimated $3.2 million. Much of the attention around QT lately hasn’t been about reviving The Bride, but on the backlash his dismissal of Paul Dano as “the limpest dick in the world” has generated.\n\t\n\n\tTheater owners, who have struggled through a rough fall filled with flop films, are hoping that holiday hits like “Wicked: For Good” and “Zootopia 2”, along with upcoming blockbusters like “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” will help them end a roller-coaster year on a high note. Overall, revenues are running roughly 1% ahead of 2024, which is a disappointment as many analysts expected this year to be more in line with pre-pandemic periods that saw ticket sales routinely top $9 billion annually.\n\n\t“Every film this holiday season is going to have to punch above its weight if we’re going to get anywhere close to that benchmark,” says Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at ComScore.\n\n\tBeyond a sluggish box office, movie theater operators are also facing existential questions after news broke this week that Netflix, long viewed as an enemy of the cinematic experience, has a deal to buy Warner Bros. for $82.7 million. The prospect of the streaming giant swallowing up one of the movie business’s most legendary studios has left exhibitors staring into the void.\n\n\t“Netflix is taking over one of the crown jewels of Hollywood, so you have to wonder if they will keep movies in theaters in a meaningful way or will they stay true to their business model, which has nothing to do with that,” says Bock. “Netflix already killed Blockbuster. Will they kill movie theaters too?” \n",

Members of the Music Branch will vote to determine both the shortlist and the final nominees. Among the scores that were either not submitted or deemed ineligible: “After the Hunt” (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross), “Blue Moon” (Graham Reynolds), “Ella McCay” (Hans Zimmer), “KPop Demon Hunters” (Marcelo Zarvos), and “The Phoenician Scheme” (Alexandre Desplat).\n\n\tOscar nomination voting opens Monday, Jan. 12, and closes Friday, Jan. 16. Nominations will be announced Thursday, Jan. 22.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited artisans are subject to change.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Agata Grzybowska\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Eli Adé\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLate Shift\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Late Shift\" (Credit: Boo Productions)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best International Feature Commentary (Updated Dec. 16, 2025): The international feature film category offered few surprises on the shortlist, though distributor Neon secured a record five of the 15 available slots. Switzerland’s “Late Shift” edged out the United Kingdom’s “My Father’s Shadow,” despite the latter’s recent Gotham Award win for lead actor Ṣọpẹ Dìrísù.\n\n\tWomen directors also made their mark in this year’s selections: seven of the 15 international feature films are directed by women.\n\n\tThe roster of contenders aligned almost identically with predictions, though Switzerland’s “Late Shift” emerged as a notable surprise, securing a spot many expected would go to the United Kingdom’s “My Father’s Shadow” — particularly after its strong Gotham Award win for leading performer Sopé Dìrísù. Critical acclaim and festival momentum don’t always translate to Academy recognition, especially in a category known for its unpredictability.\n\n\tNeon’s impressive five-film presence (“The Secret Agent,” “Sirât,” “It Was Just an Accident,” “Sentimental Value,” and “No Other Choice”) shows the distributor’s is gearing up for a bloodbath of its own in the international space. Will they nab all five slots? Tunisia’s masterful “The Voice of Hind Rajab” is in the running for a spot after the Golden Globe nom.\n\n\tIn other news, streaming giants Netflix (“Left-Handed Girl”) and Amazon MGM Studios (“Belén”) maintain their competitive footing. Meanwhile, Watermelon Pictures’ dual representation with entries from Jordan (“All That’s Left of You”) and Palestine (“Palestine 36”) highlights the continued push for representation from Middle Eastern cinema on the global stage.\n\n\tThe international feature film category drew 86 eligible submissions from countries and regions around the world. The Academy defines an international feature film as a feature-length picture (more than 40 minutes) produced outside the U.S. with a predominantly non-English dialogue track.\n\n\tAcademy members from all branches were invited to participate in the preliminary round of voting, though eligibility required meeting a minimum viewing requirement. In the nominations round, members from all branches may opt in to participate but must view all 15 shortlisted films to vote. From this shortlist of 15 titles, five films will advance to the final nomination ballot.\n\n\tFinal nominations in the shortlisted categories will be determined in the coming weeks. Oscar voting opens Monday, Jan. 12, and closes Friday, Jan. 16. Nominations will be announced Thursday, Jan. 22.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Aniplex Inc.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: AMP Filmworks\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Credit: Cannes Film Festival\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tGil Gerard, the American actor who starred as the titular hero in the 1979 NBC sci-fi series “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century,” died Tuesday after a battle with cancer. He was 82. \n\n\tGerard’s death was confirmed by his wife, Janet, in a Facebook post Tuesday evening. \n\n\t“Early this morning Gil – my soulmate – lost his fight with a rare and viciously aggressive form of cancer,” read Janet’s post. “From the moment when we knew something was wrong to his death this morning was only days. No matter how many years I got to spend with him it would have ever been enough. Hold the ones you have tightly and love them fiercely.”\n\t\n\n\tGerard also released his own statement on Facebook Tuesday night, which he asked his wife to share after he died. \n\n\t“My life has been an amazing journey. The opportunities I’ve had, the people I’ve met and the love I have given and received have made my 82 years on the planet deeply satisfying,” read Gerard’s statement. “My journey has taken me from Arkansas to New York to Los Angeles, and finally, to my home in North Georgia with my amazing wife, Janet, of 18 years. It’s been a great ride, but inevitably one that comes to a close as mine has. Don’t waste your time on anything that doesn’t thrill you or bring you love. See you out somewhere in the cosmos.”\n\n\t“Buck Rogers in the 25th Century” ran for two seasons from 1979 to 1981. The show, based on the character created by Philip Francis Nowlan in 1928, was first adapted as a made-for-TV movie, which grossed $21 million in its 1979 theatrical debut. Universal and NBC quickly began work on a weekly sci-fi series later that same year. The film was split in half for a two-part series premiere. “Buck Rogers” followed Gerard as Captain William “Buck” Rogers, a 20th-century astronaut who is frozen in space for 504 years and wakes up in the year 2491.\n\t\n\n\tGerard’s other TV credits include “Sidekicks,” “Nightingales,” “E.A.R.T.H. Force” and “Days of Our Lives.”  His more recent film credits include “Space Captain and Callista,” “The Nice Guys” and “Blood Fare.”\n\n\tGerard was born in 1943 in Little Rock, Ark. He appeared in commercials and had small roles on several popular ’70s TV shows before getting his break with “Buck Rogers.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA group of Rob Reiner’s closest friends and collaborators, including Billy Crystal, Larry David, Martin Short and Albert Brooks, released a joint statement on Tuesday in remembrance of the prolific filmmaker and his wife, Michele Singer.\n\n\t“Absorbing all he had learned from his father Carl and his mentor Norman Lear, Rob Reiner not only was a great comic actor, he became a master story teller,” read the statement released to The Associated Press. “There is no other director who has his range. From comedy to drama to ‘mockumentary’ to documentary he was always at the top of his game. He charmed audiences. They trusted him. They lined up to see his films.”\n\t\n\n\tThe statement continued, “His comedic touch was beyond compare, his love of getting the music of the dialogue just right, and his sharpening of the edge of a drama was simply elegant.”\n\n\n\tAlong with Crystal, David, Short and Brooks, signatures from Barry Levinson, film writer Alan Zweibel, U.S Ambassador to Spain James Costos and composer Marc Shaiman also appeared on the statement.\n\n\tThe remembrance went on to praise Reiner as a “passionate, brave citizen,” and Singer as his “perfect partner.” Both Singer and Reiner were outspoken Democrats who frequently advocated for political reform.\n\n\t“Strong and determined, Michele and Rob Reiner devoted a great deal of their lives for the betterment of our fellow citizens,” the statement read. “They were a special force together — dynamic, unselfish and inspiring.”\n\n\t“We were their friends, and we will miss them forever,” added the statement before closing with a quote from “It’s a Wonderful Life,” one of Reiner’s favorite films: “’Each man’s life touches so many other lives, and when he isn’t around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn’t he?’ You have no idea.”\n\t\n\n\tReiner, who starred in the 1971 sitcom “All in the Family” before directing films like “This Is Spinal Tap,” “When Harry Met Sally…,” “A Few Good Men” and “Stand by Me,” was found dead on Sunday afternoon in his Brentwood home alongside Singer, his wife of over three decades. Reiner was 78, and Singer was 70.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe board of E.W. Scripps Co. unanimously rejected the unsolicited acquisition proposal submitted by Sinclair, the second-biggest U.S. TV station owner group, Scripps announced Tuesday.\n\n\tSinclair on Nov. 24 had offered $7 per share (in a mix of cash and stock) for stock in Scripps that it does not already own; it previously had acquired a 9.9% stake in Scripps. Sinclair’s takeover move came amid Nexstar Media Group’s $6.2 billion deal for Tegna, which would expand the reach of Nexstar, the No. 1 biggest TV station owner group in the U.S. \n\t\n\n\tScripps said in a Dec. 16 statement, “The Scripps board determined, following a careful review and evaluation in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that Sinclair’s offer is not in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.”\n\n\n\tReps for Sinclair did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\n\tKim Williams, the chair of Scripps’ board, said in a statement, “The board is committed to acting in the best interests of all Scripps shareholders as well as the company’s employees and the many communities and audiences it serves across the United States. After careful consideration, Scripps’ board determined that Sinclair’s unsolicited acquisition proposal is not in the best interests of Scripps and its shareholders. The board nonetheless remains open to evaluating opportunities to enhance shareholder value and will continue to consider any course of action, including any acquisition proposal, that is in the best interest of all shareholders.”\n\n\tSinclair operates and/or provides services to 185 TV stations in 85 markets, while Scripps has more than 60 stations in 40-plus markets. According to Sinclair, upon closing of the Scripps acquisition, Scripps shareholders would own approximately 12.7% of the combined entity.\n\t\n\n\tIn the SEC filing, Sinclair commented on the FCC’s current 39% ownership limit: “We are confident that under existing rules, including the national cap, the transaction [with Scripps] can be completed in a timely manner with limited select divestitures.” \n\n\tUnder Sinclair’s proposal, the combined Sinclair-Scripps company would have a market capitalization of $2.9 billion, based on a 7:1 ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), according to Sinclair. Sinclair estimated the unified company would have about $325 million in cost synergies.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix is aiming to bolster awareness of its new “Best Guess Live” mobile game, by giving away a total of $1 million over the course of next week. The daily jackpot, which normally stands at $15,000, will be bumped up to $50,000 on Monday, then escalate throughout the week until contestants will play for a chance at a $500,000 jackpot on Friday, Dec. 26.\n\n\tThe new mobile game show, which launched Dec. 8, runs weeknights at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on a special Netflix “Best Guess Live” app devoted to the competition. Howie Mandel (“America’s Got Talent”) and Hunter March (“Sugar Rush”) split hosting duties.\n\t\n\n\tThe daily pot is split between two puzzles featured each weekday. Players are asked to guess what one of the evening’s secret items are. It could be a person, a place or a thing, and players will have to figure it out through a series of five clues (shared, of course, as riddles). The first people to figure out the item correctly share the pot — but you only get one guess per puzzle.\n\n\n\tThe mobile game shoots live every weeknight from Apploff Entertainment’s offices in Los Angeles; executive producer Jeff Apploff (“Beat Shazam,” “Don’t Forget the Lyrics”) created the show with Noah Bonnett.\n\n\tDuring the holiday week of Monday, Dec. 22 to Friday, Dec. 26, the prize pool will add up to a total of $1 million. Here’s the breakdown of the holiday cash prizes below:\n\n\tMon, Dec. 22 – $50,000\n\n\tTue, Dec. 23 – $100,000\n\n\tWed, Dec. 24 – $150,000\n\n\tThu, Dec. 25 – $200,000\n\n\tFri, Dec. 26 – $500,000\n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Sound Commentary (Updated Dec. 16, 2025): The Oscars shortlist has been announced for best sound, and the category is a symphony of chaos (in all the best ways).\n\n\tWar film (sort of?) “One Battle After Another” earns its spot with gritty, ground-level realism, where every explosion and anguished scream is meticulously orchestrated for visceral emotional impact, pulling audiences directly into the fog of battle. Meanwhile, “Sinners” continues its awards momentum with a sound mix that’s equal parts operatic and ominous, creating an unsettling sonic atmosphere that lingers long after the credits roll.\n\n\tPerhaps the coolest inclusion of the decade is “Sirât,” a more meditative international entry that proves sound excellence isn’t exclusive to English-language blockbusters.\n\n\tIn the music-driven lane, “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” turns up the volume with soulful studio sessions and stadium-worthy acoustics that capture The Boss at his most intimate and anthemic. And it would have been foolish to count out “Wicked: For Good,” which enchants with a masterful blend of soaring vocals from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, lush orchestrations and magical effects that make Oz feel tactile and alive.\n\n\t“Superman” flies in with thunderous heroics. You can hear every punch, crash, and sonic boom in a mix that makes you feel like you’re soaring alongside the Man of Steel. Then there’s “F1,” a full-throttle contender where sound practically becomes a character, immersing viewers in the roar of engines and the split-second tension of race day. “Frankenstein” takes a starkly different route, combining gothic atmosphere and eerie silence.\n\n\tAction enthusiasts and Tom Cruise devotees can rest easy as “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” has landed on the list, a fitting recognition for what’s the franchise’s final chapter. And it’s no surprise to see “Avatar: Fire and Ash” here, with James Cameron once again demonstrating his unparalleled ability to make the soundscape of Pandora feel as immersive and alive as the world itself.\n\n\tAll eligible members of the Sound Branch vote to determine the shortlist and the nominees. Academy members will be invited to view excerpts from each of the shortlisted films beginning Saturday, Jan. 10, 2025, in the San Francisco Bay area, London and New York, followed by Los Angeles on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2026. \n\n\tOscar nomination voting opens Monday, Jan. 12, and closes Friday, Jan. 16. Nominations will be announced Thursday, Jan. 22.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited artisans are subject to change, and are ultimately determined by the Academy.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: 20th Century Studios\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tGar O’Rourke joins the likes of Frederick Wiseman with an immersive observational documentary that takes a sensitive look at a community attempting to relax under conditions of growing unease. Though O’Rourke is an Irish filmmaker, working with majority Irish funding, his chosen location is Ukraine, a country under attack. But this is no front-and-center war documentary. Rather, it’s about what happens outside the combat zones at a faded holiday destination.\n\t\n\n\tTo glance at it, the Kuyalnik Sanatorium, located near Odesa in southern Ukraine, could be a power station, military base or even a sewage treatment center. In fact, treatments of another kind draw everyday people to this imposing Soviet-era construction: Mud baths, massages and all sorts of other wellness procedures are the stock in trade of the striking but down-at-heel institution.\n\n\tDenys Melnyk film’s the facility’s guests with compassion but also honesty, preserving their dignity without airbrushing their reality. The variety of body types and shapes shown here, often covered in very little, is a reminder that despite the smoothness of the people held up as worthy of admiration on Instagram, most people’s bodies and faces have lumps and bumps and creases and crinkles. Showing this in such a contemplative fashion feels quietly radical in an attention economy that has normalized loudness. \n\n\n\tWith no narrator to impose an interpretation, “Sanatorium” is the opposite of a spoon-fed social issues doc: It observes, listens and trusts the audience likewise to observe, listen and to draw their own conclusions. That’s not to say it isn’t characterful or funny; it is. As guests dance to George Michael’s lush classic “Careless Whisper” at the spa disco, a viewer might recall the Austrian director Ulrich Seidl’s witty scene construction, but where Seidl’s warts-and-all work sometimes crosses a line into mercilessness, the humor here doesn’t erase anybody’s humanity. There’s always a warmth and dignity to the portrayal of the people involved.\n\t\n\n\tThere’s even a sense of religious ritual to some scenes: As clients are painted gently with healing mud and wrapped in cloth, it’s like witnessing the embalming of saints, an effect emphasized by Denis Kilty’s score. When the Renaissance painter Caravaggio first started to attract fame, a big part of his appeal was that although his subjects were notionally saints and Biblical figures, his models were everyday people from the streets of Rome, leading to Madonnas with the face of a popular local sex worker, disciples with the frame of the skinny old man selling fish in the market or a prosperous Archdeacon bearing a fleeting resemblance to the proprietor of a nearby dive bar. These are the kinds of faces O’Rourke foregrounds, similarly centering the quotidian to sanctifying effect. This contrasts beautifully with the modest effects of the treatments, as reported by the clients themselves: “Psoriasis is no longer getting worse.”\n\n\tThe location is an important character as well, with the crumbling building itself providing a striking arena for the low-key drama. The ambition and pride that would have been involved in its construction, during the height of the USSR’s power and influence, contrasted with its current state of managed decline, provides a piquant Ozymandias monument: “Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair” — a topical theme, as aging men in power across the world attempt to ensure they will be remembered, often with harmful consequences.\n\n\tWith values like wit and stoicism baked in, “Sanatorium” always felt like a long shot in the Oscar international feature race, where it is representing Ireland this year. But if the Academy were ever to introduce a category honoring most nuance, this kind of film would be a frontrunner.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner’s murders on Sunday were shocking for many reasons – their sheer brutality, the sad fact that it involved one of Hollywood’s gentlest souls, and that the couple’s son, Nick Reiner, is allegedly the killer. I had seen a brief glimpse into their father-son dynamic when I interviewed Rob and Nick when they were at the 2015 Toronto Film Festival with “Being Charlie,” a drama based on Nick’s struggle to get sober.\n\t\n\n\tWe talked for maybe 45 minutes, and the resulting piece was all-too brief, but I’ve been turning that interview, as well as the three or four others I conducted with Rob in my career, over in my head since the news broke. It’s impossible to comprehend what would make someone murder anyone, let alone their parents. But in sorting through these stray encounters, I’ve been reflecting on how human and hopeful Rob and Nick seemed at the festival.\n\n\n\tI remember finding “Being Charlie,” which is about the drug-addicted son of an actor turned congressional candidate (a clear stand-in for Rob), to be well-intentioned, but undercooked. However, talking with the Reiners it was impossible not to be moved by the personal story that inspired it. Nick had co-written the script for the film, and Rob had directed the picture, with the two evidently searching for some kind of reconciliation.  \n\n\t“Something would happen in the script, and that would trigger stuff that was going on with us,” Rob told me. “He had written things between the father and the son that had happened. I had said to him, ‘I’d rather you hate me than you be dead in the street.’” \n\t\n\n\tFor his part, Nick, who seemed shy, said he hoped that “Being Charlie” would highlight some of the “ridiculousness” he experienced during one failed rehab stint after another. Like Rob, he implied that their relationship had been strained, but that working together had been cathartic. That was never clearer than in the final conversation between an estranged father and son that Nick had conceived for the film, one that was intended to signal a kind of closure.  \n\n\t“Towards the end of shooting, we were doing a scene, and I said, ‘Why doesn’t Charlie go up and hug his dad,’” Nick told me. “That meant a lot to my dad, because it was sort of like I was accepting him back in.”\n\n\t Both Rob and Nick argued that the recovery programs that they’d turned to since Nick was 15 had failed them. They hadn’t come up with a way to keep Nick off drugs, and Rob felt he hadn’t appreciated his son’s objections to the doctors and experts who had tried to help him beat his addictions. It was clear that Rob felt very guilty. His celebrity and access to resources hadn’t been enough to prevent his son from getting into drugs – like so many other people around the world, addiction had torn their family apart.  \n\n\tI talked to Rob several times over the years – most recently when he was relaunching Castle Rock and looking for investors at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival. He was affable, funny and genuine, often interrupting our interviews to say something to Michele, who would flit in and out of the room, or asking her to jog his memory about some detail or another. In talking to people who knew the couple far better than I did, it was clear they were joined at the hip – artistically, spiritually, professionally – and believed in treating people with decency and grace.  \n\n\tThey took their responsibility to others seriously (my colleague Daniel D’Addario correctly labeled Rob Reiner “one of Hollywood’s great humanists”), getting involved in numerous social justice causes. And given the outpouring of affection that has sprung up from the many, many people who had worked with Rob and Michele over the years, working with them meant having a friend for life.  \n\t\n\n\tI kept thinking about one other encounter I had with Rob, when I wrote an oral history of one of my favorite movies, “Stand by Me.” I remember him talking in a haunted fashion about running into River Phoenix in the years after the film came out. He was clearly alarmed by the choices that the young, sweet, sensitive man had made since they worked together on the movie.  \n\n\t“He was already getting into drugs,” Reiner said. “I remember him coming to visit me in a hotel somewhere and he was like really high, and I thought, ‘Ay, ay, ay, what the hell is going on with this kid?’” He went on to share how sad he felt when he heard about River’s death of an overdose, the way his heart broke for the young man’s family, and his frustration at all the missed roles that Phoenix never got to play because his life ended too soon. And I sensed regret that nobody had been able to pull River out of the spiral of addiction.  \n\n\tI know many parents will do anything to help their children, and it sounds like Rob and Michele were no exceptions. But having seen Hollywood fail to rescue one young person he cared about must have only reinforced Rob Reiner’s commitment to save his own son. In the end, that wouldn’t be enough. \n",

The outlet reports Hader told Nick the conversation was private ... and Nick then slipped into a thousand-yard stare, before \"storming off.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As we reported ... Nick also got into a loud shouting match with his father at the same event. In recent months, Rob and Michele were struggling with how to deal with Nick as he continued to battle mental health issues and alleged substance abuse. Rob reportedly brought Nick to the party to keep an eye on him.\n      \n\n          Hours after the party, on Sunday afternoon, Rob and Michele's daughter Romy discovered their stabbed and bloodied bodies at their Brentwood house. Rigor mortis had already set in, meaning they had been dead for hours.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Romy is the one who called the police and told them her brother Nick -- who'd been living at the house -- was \"dangerous\" and should be considered a suspect.\n      \n    \n          About 6 hours later, Nick was located and arrested on suspicion of murder ... he's currently being held on suicide watch at Men's Central Jail in L.A. without bail.\n      \n    \n          We've reached out to Bill Hader ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Conan O'Brien\n              \n                          \n                Michele Reiner\n              \n                          \n                Nick Reiner\n              \n                          \n                Rob Reiner\n              \n                          \n                Bill Hader\n              \n                          \n                RIP\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Death\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Rob Reiner Death\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

He quickly cut a deal with the feds after a slew of arrests were made in connection with Perry's death. Chavez admitted to selling ketamine to Dr. Salvador Plasencia, which was then sold to Perry weeks before the actor's fatal overdose.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Prosecutors said Chavez obtained the ketamine fraudulently by submitting a prescription in the name of a patient without the patient's knowledge or consent.\n      \n    \n          Earlier this month, Plasencia was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to 4 counts of distributing ketamine.\n      \n\n          In a text discussion over how much to charge Perry for the drugs, Plasencia wrote to Chavez, \"I wonder how much this moron will pay.\"\n      \n    \n          The text was highlighted in a victim impact letter written to the judge by Perry's stepfather, Keith Morrison.\n      \n    \n          He wrote, \"This doctor conspired to break his most important vows, repeatedly, sneaked through the night to meet his victim in secret. For what, a few thousand dollars? So he could feed on the vulnerability of our son…and crow, as he did so, with that revealing question: 'I wonder how much this moron will pay. Let’s find out.'\"\n      \n    \n          As you know ... Perry overdosed on ketamine and drowned in his hot tub back in 2023.\n      \n    \n          Perry's live-in assistant Kenneth Iwamasa, drug dealer Erik Fleming, and the so-called \"Ketamine Queen\" Jasveen Sangha are expected to be sentenced in the coming weeks.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Matthew Perry\n              \n                          \n                RIP\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Death\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

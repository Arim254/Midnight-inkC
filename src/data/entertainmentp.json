    "body": "\n\tIndian actor Anupam Kher brought a mix of humor, grit and unvarnished honesty to his International Film Festival of India (IFFI) masterclass, “Giving Up Is Not a Choice,” holding a packed Kala Mandir audience with stories spanning his small-town beginnings, his breakout turn in “Saaransh,” more than 540 screen credits and a career-defining encounter with Robert De Niro. The session was motivational address, entertainment and a window into his unique life as a performer.\n\t\n\n\tKher was just 28 when he played a 65-year-old man in Mahesh Bhatt’s “Saaransh” in 1984. He later crossed over to Hollywood with films such as “Silver Linings Playbook” (2012) and the series “New Amsterdam,” and has performed in “almost all Indian languages.”\n\n\n\tA long-time admirer of Robert De Niro, Kher wrote papers on “Mean Streets” and “Taxi Driver” during his student years. Decades later, as he explored an international career, the actor was cast in David O. Russell’s “Silver Linings Playbook” – a project that already had De Niro attached. The opportunity to work with his idol seemed within reach, but to his surprise, De Niro initially resisted the presence of Kher’s character in a crucial scene, based on the former’s own reading of the script. Kher recounted how he eventually spoke up, offering his perspective on the scene, at the risk of losing both the role and the chance to act alongside De Niro.\n\n\tLater that night, while offering him a drink in his van, De Niro commended Kher for his performance. “Because I was truthful and not worried about being unpopular with the unit,” Kher said, “today I can claim that Mr. Robert De Niro is one of my best friends.”\n\t\n\n\tDuring the session, 70-year-old Kher shared multiple moments from his life, when giving up simply wasn’t an option. He urged the audience to believe in themselves and become the central character of their own biopic. “What happens in your life goes on to become the story of your life. Why should life be easy? Why should life be simple? Why should life not have problems? Because it’s your problems that will make your biopic a superstar biopic,” he said, reflecting on his journey from a small town to acting beside legends around the world. “Failure is an event,” he added, “not a person, and the film of your life deserves a blockbuster ending.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFX has ordered a series adaptation of Ubisoft’s “Far Cry” video games from Noah Hawley and Rob Mac, Variety has learned. \n\n\tIn addition to co-creating the series, Mac (formerly McElhenney) will also star. The series will stream on Hulu in the U.S. and Disney+ internationally. While exact plot details are being kept under wraps, the series will follow an anthology format like the games and feature a different cast and setting each season. \n\t\n\n\t“Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized,” said Mac. “Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe series deepens both Mac and Hawley’s relationship with FX. Mac famously created and stars in the hit FX comedy series “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” which aired its 17th season earlier this year. It is the longest-running live-action sitcom in American history. He also stars in and executive produces the FX docuseries “Welcome to Wrexham,” which has aired four seasons and won 10 Emmy Awards so far. \n\n\tHawley, meanwhile, is the creator of fellow FX anthology series “Fargo,” as well as the recently renewed sci-fi series “Alien: Earth.” Five seasons of “Fargo” have aired to date, with the show collectively winning seven Emmy Awards out of 70 nominations, as well as three Golden Globes out of 14 nominations. Hawley also created the FX-Marvel series “Legion,” which aired for three seasons. \n\n\tThe series also brings Mac back into business with Ubisoft. He co-created and starred in the Apple TV series “Mythic Quest” for four seasons, with Ubisoft Film & Television also producing that show.\n\t\n\n\t“What I love about the ‘Far Cry’ game franchise is it’s an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of ‘Fargo’ is a variation on a theme,” said Hawley. “To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I’m excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen.”\n\n\tMac will executive produce under his More Better Productions banner, while Hawley will executive produce under his overall deal with FX and Disney Entertainment Television via 26 Keys. Emilia Serrano for 26 Keys will also executive produce along with Nick Frenkel for 3 Arts, Jackie Cohn for More Better Productions, John Campisi, and Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin and Austin Dill for Ubisoft Film & Television. The series will be produced by FX Productions.\n\n\t“FX has had magnificent partnerships with Rob Mac and Noah Hawley for a combined six series and 32 seasons of television, and we couldn’t be more excited that they are teaming up for ‘Far Cry,’” said Nick Grad, president of FX Entertainment. “I have no doubt that they will tell this story in a way that is original, gripping and wildly entertaining. We also want to thank our partners at Ubisoft for entrusting us with this beloved property.”\n\n\tThis will be the first live-action “Far Cry” adaptation for TV. The games were previously adapted into a 2008 direct-to-video film starring Til Schweiger and directed by Uwe Boll. Netflix, meanwhile, released the animated series “Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix” in 2023, which was inspired by “Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon.” \n\n\tThe first “Far Cry” game was released in 2004. Since then, five other games in the main series have been released along with numerous spinoffs. The most recent game, “Far Cry 6,” was released in 2021. More than 100 million unique players have enjoyed the games since their debut. \n\n\tMac is repped by WME, 3 Arts, Narrative, and Sloane Offer. Hawley is repped by WME, Untitled, and McKuin Frankel Whitehead. Ubisoft is repped by WME and Greenberg Glusker.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers from Episodes 1-3 of “Bel-Air,” now streaming on Peacock.\n\n\tFor the past three years, Jabari Banks has played Will in Peacock’s reboot of the beloved ’90s sitcom, “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, ” a legendary role originated by Will Smith.\n\n\t​“He’s been a guiding force and light throughout this whole experience,” Banks says of working with Smith. “We rarely talk about the character, but we’ve talked about the industry and my career. That’s been the most impactful conversation that I’ve had with him.”​\n\t\n\n\tReflecting on his experience during his last day on set, Banks recalls: “There were a lot of tears and reminiscing. It’s like graduating high school. When it’s time to say goodbye, it sucks.”\n\n\n\tIn an industry where nostalgia sells, reboots often miss the mark by failing to offer a fresh, modern take on an original story. In a landscape dominated by remakes, Peacock’s “Bel-Air” is one of the few shows that got it right.\n\n\t​And it all started with a viral mock trailer from the “Bel-Air” creator, Morgan Cooper.\n\n\t​In 2019, Cooper created a nearly 4-minute trailer that reimagined “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” as a gritty drama that gained millions of views on YouTube. Less than 24 hours later, Cooper had a meeting with Smith and his production company, Westbrook, who were interested in bringing Cooper’s reimagination of the old sitcom into a more serious drama.\n\n\t​The series keeps the humor and family bonds between Will and the Banks family, but departs from the original comedy’s half-hour format, as an hour-long series that explores class disparity, sexuality, institutionalized racism, mental health and identity with greater depth than was possible in the ‘90s sitcom.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnne Marie Fox/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\t​Now in its fourth and final season, which premieres with its first three episodes on Nov. 24,  Will enters his senior year trying to figure out his future, while Carlton (Olly Sholotan) deals with the weight of tough decisions that put his future at risk.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Phil (Adrian Holmes) and Geoffrey’s (Jimmy Akingbola) brotherhood is fractured after an unexpected power shift tests their loyalties. Viv (Cassandra Freeman) struggles with reinventing herself as she welcomes a new child into the Banks family. Ashley (Akira Akbar) faces challenges in her freshman year of high school, while Hilary (Coco Jones) focuses on self-healing after her husband’s death.\n\n\t​The first few episodes pick up with Will’s trauma affecting his daily life since returning home after being kidnapped. Rather than seeking professional help to process his trauma, Will goes on a quest to track down his kidnappers and Geoffrey, his family’s butler, whose sketchy past led to Will’s abduction.\n\n\t​“Will is a very spontaneous, hot-headed guy, but also a protector of his family,” Banks says. “Knowing that Geoffrey has been gone doesn’t sit right with his spirit. He’s not going to wait on anybody to help him in this situation.”\n\n\t​His fixation on finding his kidnappers leads him to a destination where he discovers the same car used in his abduction. With the help of Carlton, Will retaliates by using a baseball bat, attempting to smash the vehicle beyond repair.\n\n\t“Smashing the car was a representation of him taking his power back and a release of pent-up emotions,” Banks says. “It seems like nobody cares that Geoffrey is gone. When he finds the car that he was thrown into, it’s the perfect thing to take his anger out on.”\n\n\t​Although Will’s rebellion isn’t surprising, Carlton’s help with vandalizing the car strays away from his character, since he typically follows the rules. Carlton often adheres to authority, a tendency that has clashed in earlier seasons with his cousin’s rebellious nature. But expanding their relationship from “enemies to brothers” has been one of Banks’ favorite storylines to bring to life with Sholotan.\n\n\t​“The biggest lesson of Will and Carlton is seeing someone else’s perspective and taking the time to get to know someone even if you don’t agree with their standpoint on certain things,” Banks says. “They’ve had the time to argue through certain points and know that sometimes they just may not understand. But, they love the person simply for being them.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnne Marie Fox/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThroughout the series, “Bel-Air” has featured celebrity cameos across Hollywood. For the final season, the show will introduce new characters played by “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” alum Janet Hubert, Tyra Banks and Snoop Dogg. Banks — who is also a musician, and recently released his debut EP “Ultra” — was particularly excited to act alongside Snoop Dogg.\n\n\t​“He was super cool, chill, friendly and personable,” Banks says. “He had a two-page monologue and didn’t skip a word. That was dope to see his level of professionalism. It’s the reason why his career has had the longevity, and that was inspiring to see. Whether that be music or acting, he shows up ready.”​\n\n\tAnother inspiration the actor has had the chance to act alongside has been Marlon Wayans, who first appeared in the Season 1 finale as Will’s long-lost father, Lou. In the series, Banks and Wayans have showcased the complexities of a father and son reconnecting. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnne Marie Fox/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThrough their ups and downs, Season 4 becomes a turning point in their relationship after Will calls Lou “dad” for the first time.\n\n\t​“He [Will] never had the opportunity to say that word,” Banks says. “As he and Lou are getting closer, it slips out. It signifies comfort and an openness that Will is starting to have with his father, which is a beautiful thing.”\n\n\tDespite playing his character’s father on screen, Banks describes Wayans as more of an “older brother” who has given him direction and guidance off camera. “He plays my father, but he definitely feels like an older brother. Whether we talk about the show or life, he has taken me under his wing.”\n\n\t​As Banks takes his final bow as Will, he says the most rewarding part of breathing new life into the beloved sitcom has been connecting with the fans, old and new.\n\n\t“​There are so many people of different ages and demographics that love it,” he says. “It’s beautiful to see that we can bring communities together with a shared love for television and culture. I’m super happy that fans love the show.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tShirley Henderson will forever be linked to the “Harry Potter” franchise thanks to her role as Moaning Myrtle in 2002’s “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.” It’s a role she landed only after being advised by the movie’s casting director not to mention her age to others. That’s because Henderson was 37 years old, auditioning to play a 14-year-old schoolgirl.\n\n\t“The casting director said, ‘Go for it — and don’t mention your age,'” Henderson recalled in an interview with The Independent. “When I was first asked for an audition, I didn’t know who Harry Potter was. But my sister, who was staying with me, had read the books. Still, I wasn’t convinced I could play a 14-year-old girl because I was in my 30s at the time.”\n\t\n\n\tAccording to Henderson, one of the film’s casting directors thought she was the right actor for the job and never revealed her age to the rest of the crew during the audition process. \n\n\n\t“I went to the audition dressed as a schoolgirl — white shirt, black skirt, ponytail — thinking, ‘This is ridiculous,'” Henderson said. “I did my wee bit for them and they thanked me. Months went by and I thought that was it, but then they phoned my agent, asked to see me again, and offered me the part… Myrtle is an old person in a young person’s body and because she’s ghosty, there’s a kind of mistiness. You’re not looking closely at my face, so we could get away with it.”\n\n\tHenderson added that she was able to maintain her privacy after the movie came out, unlike many of her fellow “Harry Potter” costars. She said, “I don’t think anybody recognized me at all.”\n\t\n\n\tHenderson was already an established actor by the time she landed the role of Moaning Myrtle, having starred in films like “Trainspotting” and “Topsy-Turvy.” She was nominated for the London Film Critics Circle Award for supporting actress of the year for the latter performance. Post-“Harry Potter,” Henderson went on to star in “Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,” “Marie Antionette,” “Meek’s Cutoff” and more.\n\n\tHead over to The Independent’s website to read Henderson’s latest profile in its entirety.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFae Pictures is ramping up its production activity with multiple projects spanning horror, television and documentary as president Shant Joshi participated in a producers’ development program.\n\n\tJoshi was selected as one of 12 producers for the WAVES Film Bazaar x ProducerLAND Producers’ Lab, a professional development initiative supporting mid-career South Asian producers. He participated in the Project Track with “The Devil’s Tears,” a Tamil-language elevated horror film that marks Maya Bastian’s second narrative feature.\n\t\n\n\tThe company’s Asian-Canadian anthology series “Streams Flow From a River” has been greenlit for a second season, set to begin production in February 2026 for Super Channel in Canada. Backed by the Canada Media Fund and the Bell Fund, the new season shifts focus from the Chinese-Canadian Chow family featured in season one to follow the Pakistani-Canadian Javed family. The six-episode season will be directed entirely by Bastian, with Abdul Malik serving as head writer. Series creator Christopher Yip returns as executive producer, while Keavy Lynch, Renuka Singh, Thomas Pepper and Manny Mahal comprise the writing team.\n\n\n\tThe anthology series exploring immigrant families in rural Canada is a Fae Pictures and Rellow Media production, with Joshi and Lindsay Blair Goeldner executive producing. Temilola Adebayo serves as producer, with Lisa Valencia-Svensson and Leonard Chan as co-executive producers and Melissa Affrunti as associate producer. EST Studios will handle international festivals and market for a standalone feature version of the season titled “Goose Point.”\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, production on “Granny Lee” has been pushed back a year to April-May 2026 following a series of setbacks. The project lost financing from Amazon Prime Video Africa and South Africa’s Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, while also facing delays in the ratification of the Canada-South African co-production treaty. Although the treaty was signed in September 2024, it did not return to the Canadian parliamentary docket until June 2025 due to Parliament’s prorogation following Justin Trudeau’s resignation and the subsequent federal election. The project has since secured new funding from Eurimages, Quebec’s SODEC and South Africa’s National Film and Video Foundation.\n\n\tFae Pictures has also joined as executive producer on “Le Silence de Mostafa,” a Moroccan-Canadian documentary following the return to filmmaking of Mostafa Derkaoui, often regarded as the godfather of Moroccan cinema. The film explores the decolonial filmmaker’s role as patriarch in a filmmaking family, with his granddaughter Kenza Derkaoui directing and producing alongside Stefan Supplice under Niya Production. Mostafa’s son Kamal Derkaoui serves as cinematographer, while Mostafa’s late wife Douja Nour and brother Krimou Derkaoui also appear in the film. Supported by Telefilm Canada and Canada Council for the Arts, the documentary is expected to be structured as a Canada-Morocco treaty co-production and will be versioned in both French and English.\n\n\tWAVES Film Bazaar is the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa. \n",

    "description": "\n\tThree-time Grammy winner Ne-Yo, Indian music legend Sonu Nigam and pioneering Chinese American rapper MC Jin have partnered with former Warner Music",
    "body": "\n\tThree-time Grammy winner Ne-Yo, Indian music legend Sonu Nigam and pioneering Chinese American rapper MC Jin have partnered with former Warner Music Asia co-president Jonathan Serbin to launch Pacific Music Group, a new entertainment company headquartered in Hong Kong focused on developing Pan-Asian talent for global audiences.\n\n\tThe venture marks a strategic bet on Asia’s growing influence in the music industry, with the company aiming to both elevate regional artists to international prominence and provide Western acts with an entry point into Asian markets.\n\t\n\n\tPacific Music Group will launch with multiple genre-spanning imprints covering pop, R&B, hip-hop, electronic and regional Asian styles. The label’s geographic reach extends from Japan to India and from China and Korea south to Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\t“Asia has emerged as one of the most dynamic forces in the global music industry. With half the world’s population and three of the top ten music markets, the region is primed to lead on the world stage. At the same time, rapidly growing markets like India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines offer immense potential. We believe the time is right for a music company born in Asia, but built with a global perspective from day one,” said Serbin, who previously helped drive Warner Music’s expansion across Asia and launched its first dedicated K-pop label. “Ne-Yo, Sonu and MC Jin have all achieved long-standing global success, and they know exactly what it takes to build international music careers. I’m honored to partner with these legends. Pacific Music Group artists will gain invaluable insight from their experience and vision.”\n\t\n\n\tNe-Yo added: “Launching Pacific Music Group isn’t just a business move, it’s a personal mission. As an individual of Chinese descent, I’m proud to use my resources to help discover and elevate the next generation of talented Pan-Asian superstars. I’ve toured across Asia several times and witnessed the evolution of the music scene, so I’m really excited to make history and bring the region’s rich culture to the forefront of the global stage.”\n\n\tMC Jin, who will head up Pacific Music Group’s hip-hop imprint, stated: “The influence of hip-hop on a global scale is undeniable. For me, it provided a way to find my voice as an artist, explore my identity as a Chinese American and share my truth as a storyteller. As a fan of the music and a student of the craft, I’m looking forward to connecting with artists who are also on that journey. Asia is full of talent with unique stories, fresh styles and authentic messages waiting to be shared with the world. With Pacific Music Group, these individuals will now have a chance to share their art rooted in creativity and culture in an impactful way.”\n\n\tSonu Nigam, one of India’s most celebrated performers, added: “India alone has 1.6 billion people, but Indian artists want to connect well beyond our borders. The same is true across Asia. There is a hunger to grow globally and the potential to bring the richness of our cultures to the world. With Pacific Music Group, we’re not just exporting talent, we’re helping artists thrive both at home and abroad.”\n\n\tHe added: “I have performed in more than 50 countries, and everywhere I go I see the same excitement for Asian music and culture. Working with Ne-Yo, MC Jin, and Jonathan gives us a rare mix of global experience and deep regional understanding. Together, we can mentor artists from across Asia and help them share their stories in a way that feels authentic and meaningful to listeners around the world.”\n\n\tThe three artist-founders will provide A&R guidance and mentorship to the label’s roster, drawing on decades of success as globally renowned performers and hitmakers. Serbin brings over 25 years of leadership experience in the music and media industries. During his tenure at Warner Music Asia, he oversaw 11 countries and territories and signed artists including Lay Zhang, Elva Hsiao, Coco Lee, G.E.M., Eric Chou, Vava, Jam Hsiao, Jolin Tsai and Fish Long.\n\t\n\n\t“Our approach is simple,” Serbin said. “We want to discover great artists in Asia and help them reach global audiences, and we want to provide international artists with an authentic and strategic entry point into the region. Pacific Music Group was designed from the beginning to operate at a global scale.”\n\n\tThe company’s name references a shift in the industry’s geographic center of gravity. Three of the world’s largest music markets — Japan, China and Korea — are located in Asia, alongside rapidly growing markets including India, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines.\n\n\t“Eighty years ago, when Atlantic Records was founded, the Atlantic Ocean symbolized the dominant music axis, linking the U.S. and U.K. Today, that axis has shifted,” the company stated in its announcement. “Asia is now the epicenter of creative energy, musical innovation, and fan engagement.”\n\n\tPacific Music Group’s debut artists will be unveiled in the coming months, with initial music releases scheduled for fall 2025. The company will operate with offices and talent hubs across Asia.\n\n\tNe-Yo has earned three Grammy Awards and penned hits for Rihanna, Beyoncé and Jennifer Hudson. MC Jin became the first Asian American solo hip-hop artist to sign with a major U.S. label after rising to prominence on BET’s “106 & Park Freestyle Fridays.” Nigam has written and performed songs for Indian films for nearly two decades and remains one of the most-streamed artists in India.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers for “Wicked: For Good,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” director Jon M. Chu revealed to Business Insider that he refused to show Universal Pictures executives the final shot of his two-part musical adaptation, fearing they would want to use the powerful last image in the movie’s marketing campaign. The film ends on a close-up shot of Glinda whispering into Elphaba’s ear. It’s a direct recreation of the poster for the original “Wicked” Broadway musical. \n\t\n\n\t“Yes. It was always the plan. I was always going to end on the whisper,” Chu said. “Do you know how hard it was to force Universal to never use it in any marketing material? They even had a poster of it for the first movie, and I was like, ‘Why are we releasing this poster? We should never acknowledge the whisper. Never. Never.’ I wanted it to feel like we didn’t care about it, then suddenly it’s the last shot in ‘For Good.’ So the studio never saw that final shot. I imposed a huge thing: ‘Do not show this shot!’ They wanted it so badly.”\n\n\n\tChu continued, “That poster is one of the most brilliant posters ever made. You don’t know what Glinda’s saying, because they never actually do that in the musical. But it’s sort of the key to friendship. That we have these secrets. And the girls got to choose what they are actually saying in the scene. I don’t even know what they said.”\n\n\tAs Chu noted, Universal did use a recreation of the original “Wicked” Broadway post for a poster during the marketing of the first “Wicked” movie. The poster was released in October 2024, about one month before the film opened in theaters. Given how iconic the image of Glinda whispering in Elphaba’s ear is for “Wicked” fans, many of them flooded social media to call out what Universal’s movie poster got wrong in recreating the image. Fans used photoshop to make corrections to the poster, with Elphaba’s hat being lowered and her lips getting a bold red lipstick. Erivo found such alterations hurtful.\n\t\n\n\t“This is the wildest, most offensive thing I have seen equal to that awful AI of us fighting, equal to people posing the the question ‘is your p—- green?” Erivo wrote on her Instagram story at the time while sharing one of the photoshopped “Wicked” posters with her face covered. “None of this is funny. None of it is cute. It degrades me. It degrades us.”\n\n\t“The original poster is an Illustration,” Erivo added. “I am a real life human being, who chose to to look right down the barrel of the camera to you, the viewer. … Because, without words we communicate with our eyes. Our poster is an homage not an imitation, to edit my face and hide my eyes is to erase me. And that is just deeply hurtful.”\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is now playing in theaters nationwide from Universal.

    "body": "\n\tThe 2025 International Emmy Awards winners were announced Monday at a gala event in New York. For the 53rd annual edition, winners came from 64 contenders across 16 categories representing a record 26 countries.\n\n\tAmong special honors: Disney Entertainment co-chairman Dana Walden received the International Emmy Founders Award — which was presented to her by megahit producer Ryan Murphy.\n\n\n\t“I know this award is typically given to the people who create the stories. And rightfully so. But I view this honor as recognition of a vital partnership,” Walden said in her acceptance speech. “One that exists between the creator who dreams the dream, and the team that believes in it enough to clear the path. My approach has never been complicated: Find singular voices… and help them do their best work. And most importantly — build a culture of creative risk-taking.”\n\t\n\n\tShe also discussed nurturing Murphy’s “Glee” early in its run: “It wasn’t the worst testing pilot in history – trust me — but it also didn’t get the reaction it deserved. I learned two lessons that changed the way I work with creators. First, through Ryan’s eyes, I got to understand how harsh criticism feels to a creator — particularly if the story is personal.  And, second, the feedback wasn’t really for him – it was for the executives. It was going to be our job to protect ‘Glee’ and teach an audience how to understand something different and original.”\n\n\n\tWalden, who received a standing ovation as she approached the stage, referenced some of the shows she oversaw early in her career at 20th Century Fox TV, including “The X-Files,” “Ally McBeal,” “24” and “The Simpsons” as examples. \n\t\n\n\t“Those shows all have two things in common – they were creatively ambitious and excellent,” she said. “And, though they were made in the US, they were also huge hits around the world. Because great storytelling is truly universal. And that belief – that great stories can come from anywhere and belong to everyone – is at the heart of The Walt Disney Company. It’s also a guiding principle of my mentor and friend, Bob Iger. Bob’s always championed the simple, yet powerful idea that if you get the storytelling right, everything else will follow. No matter how much the world changes, people will always want to feel connected, and they will always need to be entertained.”\n\n\tAs for this year’s awards, the U.K. came into the competition with the most nominations across all categories with 12. Other countries represented included Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong — China, India, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Norway, Qatar, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\t“Live With Kelly and Mark” hosts Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos fronted this year’s International Emmys, which featured sponsors including Variety. Besides Walden, honorees this year also included Grupo Globo chairman/president João Roberto Marinho, who received the directorate award.

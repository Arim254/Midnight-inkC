    "body": "\n\tTURIN, Italy  — When cinematographer Dan Laustsen described his collaboration with Guillermo del Toro, he reached first for feelings rather than lenses. “It’s like trust and love,” he told the audience at the View Conference in Turin via video interview with journalist Carolyn Giardina. “We have the same taste and the same way we want to tell stories.” \n\n\tThat shorthand, developed across “Crimson Peak, “The Shape of Water” and “Nightmare Alley” underpins their latest partnership on “Frankenstein,” one of Del Toro’s most personal projects yet for Netflix.\n\t\n\n\tFrom the outset, both filmmaker and cinematographer shared a visual ambition to make a film that feels classical but looks modern. \n\n\n\t“The movement of the camera, the light – everything should feel alive and contemporary, even in this period setting,” Laustsen said. \n\n\tTo achieve that balance, they turned to the Arri Alexa 65 camera paired with Leitz Thalia lenses, cropping 5% of the frame to give the visual-effects team freedom to stabilize and re-frame in post as required. The large-format setup, Laustsen explained, produced a big, classic feeling, like old 70mm, but with a modern sharpness.\n\n\tWorking on such a large sensor altered nearly every visual instinct. A 24 mm lens, normally a wide-angle in Super 35, reads as a mid-wide on the Alexa 65, changing both perspective and proximity. “Because the sensor is so big, the focal length behaves differently,” he said. “You can go from a wide shot to a close-up in one move without distortion, but you can’t hide anything.” \n\t\n\n\tThat intimacy demanded discipline in lighting, focus, and texture, the lens ability to capture such detail posed its own challenge. “They’re incredibly sharp—almost too sharp. Skin tones become very crisp,” Laustsen noted. To soften that hyper-real edge, he mounted a diffusion filter behind the lens, where it interacted with light already focused by the glass. “If you put diffusion in front, you just get a filter flare; behind the lens you get a lens flare. These lenses hardly flare at all, so it gives this beautiful softness in the highlights while keeping contrast clean.”\n\n\tLight, for Laustsen, drives emotion as much as it defines space. He favors single sources—window, fireplace, lantern—while keeping practical fixtures mostly out of frame. \n\n\tOn stage, 20-to 24-kilowatt tungsten lamps shaped the atmosphere; on location, HMIs pushed daylight through layers of smoke and haze. “We used shafts and depth, but never visible lamps. It keeps the world believable,” he said. Mixing color temperatures, firelight against the “steel” blue of a window – added what he calls “emotional contrast.” He admired “Barry Lyndon” during prep and tested the look, but found Kubrick’s even candle dominated color temperature not the right fit for the turbulence of “Frankenstein.”\n\n\tNowhere was that balance harder than in the creature’s creation sequence, an orchestration of lightning, steam and moonlight. “I was a little afraid of that scene,” Laustsen admitted. “It could easily become chaos. The trick was not to drift too far from the look of the rest of the movie.”\n\n\tColor palette and continuity anchored every department. Laustsen said every element from hair, makeup, wardrobe, and even wall paint  was tested under the same lighting setup to ensure consistency. “That’s the power of light,” he said.\n\n\tLaustsen fought to keep that realism even in large set piece moments. On the ship set, he insisted on real torches over digital flames. “When the wind changes, the light changes. And I think that’s so fantastic, because that makes everything organic.” For the castle’s burning, a full-scale Toronto set merged with miniature photography shot in London on a RED camera at 96 frames per second. They didn’t want to use CG fire. Del Toro wanted to shoot it for real. It looks photoreal because it is.\n\t\n\n\tUnderwater scenes used a “dry-for-wet” illusion: the stage filled with smoke and moving light projections to mimic the play of currents while actors stayed dry and free to perform and free of fear of drowning.\n\n\tYet Laustsen’s favourite moment is quiet – a dawn conversation between stars Oscar Isaac and Jacob Elordi, lit by sunrise bouncing off a cracked mirror. “It’s very simple,” he said. “A lot of anger and love at the same time. The performance is fantastic… and it’s just when everything comes together.”\n\n\tAsked what he hopes audiences carry away, Laustsen paused. “I think it’s about love and forgiveness,” he said, “and that is very important now.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBanijay Asia Taking Talpa Studio Formats to India and Thailand\n\n\tBanijay Asia has inked a two-year pact with Dutch production group Talpa Studios to represent its diverse portfolio of unscripted formats in India and Thailand.\n\n\tTalpa Studios’ portfolio includes hits such as “The Floor,” “The Quiz with Balls,” “The Alliance” and “Most Wanted.”\n\n\n\tBanijay Asia will offer Talpa Studios’ shows and creative concepts to broadcasters and streaming platforms across India and Thailand with the aim to localize, adapt and produce the IPs for regional audiences.\n\t\n\n\tDeepak Dhar, founder and CEO of Banijay Asia and Endemol Shine India, said the deal “allows us to introduce some truly exciting concepts to India and Thailand. We look forward to collaborating closely with Talpa Studios to bring these ideas alive for our audiences with our signature local flavour and scale.”\n\n\t“Asia is an exciting and fast-evolving market for unscripted entertainment, and working with Banijay Asia allows us to connect our creative ideas with local audiences,” added Talpa Studios CEO Maarten Meijs. “Their proven ability to translate global formats into distinctive local hits makes them a perfect partner to represent our catalogue in the region.”\n\n\tTalpa Studios’ New Quiz Show ‘Caught in the Middle’ Commissioned in Netherlands, Australia\n\n\tIn related news, Talpa Studios’ latest quiz show, “Caught in the Middle,” is making its debut in the Netherlands and Australia. Dutch broadcaster SBS6 and Australia’s Seven Network have ordered local versions, with the Australian edition produced by Eureka Productions (a Fremantle company) in partnership with Talpa Studios.\n\t\n\n\tBoth editions will be filmed in Talpa Studios’ international production hub. The Dutch version is set to premiere on SBS6 in January 2026, while Seven will announce its scheduling at a later date.\n\n\tCreated by John de Mol’s Talpa Studios, “Caught in the Middle” pits a duo against 100 opponents. The duo stands at the center of a giant LED arena surrounded by a hundred opponents. Over the course of 15 questions, they must outsmart the crowd by picking answers that match as many rivals as possible – knocking them out one by one before the opponents reach the middle and claim the €50,000 ($57,780) jackpot for themselves.\n\n\t“We’re thrilled to introduce this bold new format to Australian audiences,” said Angus Ross, Seven Group managing director for TV. “It’s fresh, unpredictable and brimming with suspense and drama – everything you want in a hit quiz show.”\n\n\tNippon TV‘s “Red Carpet Survival” Season 2 Unrolls in Italy via Prime Video\n\n\tNippon TV’s unscripted format “Red Carpet Survival” will return for a second season in Italy next year, adapted as “Red Carpet, Vip al tappeto” on Prime Video.\n\n\t“Red Carpet Survival” is a celebrity-driven game show that combines glamour, comedy and high-stakes challenges. In each episode, a VIP is escorted down a red carpet by three comedic bodyguards, facing a series of physical and mental challenges designed to test their wit, courage and improvisational skills. \n\n\tIf the celebrity steps off the red carpet even for a moment, one of the bodyguards is lost; whether the VIP can complete the long walk down the red carpet without losing the bodyguards is the challenge. The episode culminates in a sprint to the limousine, overcoming hazards such as moving obstacles, water attacks and even pigeon droppings. The team that first manages to escort its star to the final destination without a hitch wins.\n\n\tProduced by Blu Yazmine for Amazon MGM Studios and based on a Nippon TV format, the show was successfully adapted in Italy in 2025 as “Red Carpet, Vip al tappeto” on Prime Video.\n\n\tAccording to Nippon TV, Italy’s Season 2 will feature new celebrity guests, including the country’s top entertainers and social media personalities, “bringing fresh energy and star power to the show, along with exclusive challenges that are bigger, bolder and even more entertaining than before. The taping will take place in a surprising new location and the awaited premiere is scheduled for 2026.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Italian adaptation of ‘Red Carpet Survival’ highlights Nippon TV’s strategy to bring premium formats to global viewers,” added Sayako Aoki, Nippon TV’s head of international sales. “By partnering with Blu Yazmine, experienced in format adaptation and creating prime entertainment, we hope to offer Italian audiences even more exciting experiences than the first season in a brand-new location with visually fun missions.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Playmaker has come on board as the international sales agent for the upcoming family entertainment movie “Barry & Me,” which will have its pre-sales launch at the American Film Market in Los Angeles (Nov. 11 – 16).\n\n\tOn a snowy mountain pass, a boy befriends and raises a St. Bernard puppy, but when others threaten to take his beloved dog away, he risks everything to protect their bond.\n\n\n\tDirected by German filmmaker Markus Welter, the film is inspired by the Swiss legend of the famous barrel-wearing rescue dog who helped recover dozens of people swept up in avalanches in the 1800s. This version, however, focuses on his friendship with 12-year-old Georg, who discovers and secretly raises the puppy in a mountain hospice, leading to adventures in the Swiss alps.\n\t\n\n\t“Barry & Me” is a Swiss-German co-production from Atlantis Pictures and MMC Zodiac, supported by Zürcher Filmstiftung, Deutscher Filmförderungfonds, Film- und Medienstiftung NRW, Bundesamt für Kultur, Filmförderungsanstalt FFA, SUISSIMAGE, Kanton Luzern and Valais Film Commission.\n\n\n\tThe distributors in Germany and Switzerland are Wild Bunch and Ascot Elite, respectively. The film will start in Swiss cinemas in January and in Germany in March 2026.\n\n\t“As a little boy, I was captivated by the image of the legendary St. Bernard with the wooden barrel — a timeless Swiss icon. ‘Barry & Me’ is a heartwarming adventure that will enchant audiences of all ages and win hearts around the world,” Moritz Hemminger, head of sales and acquisitions at The Playmaker, said.\n\t\n\n\t“I want to tell Barry’s story with this film because it has deeply moved me. Barry represents courage, compassion, and that quiet greatness that lies in helping others. He saved countless human lives without ever asking for anything in return – and that is where his greatness lies. To me, Barry is a symbol of humanity and of the unbreakable bond between humans and animals, a bond that transcends both time and language,” producer Marcel Wolfisberg of Atlantis Pictures said.\n\n\t“After producing ‘Heidi,’ I knew how well stories about friendship and courage can move audiences. With ‘Barry & Me,’ we continue that tradition: a big family adventure inspired by the Swiss legend of Barry and the extraordinary friendship between a boy and his dog,” Lukas Hobi, a co-producer on the film for MMC Zodiac, said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMeta’s Instagram is borrowing a page from Hollywood’s content-ratings playbook.\n\n\tThe popular photo and video app said it is revamping Instagram’s Teen Accounts to be “guided” by the Motion Picture Association’s PG-13 movie rating. What that means: Users of teen accounts will be restricted to seeing content that contains the level of nudity, sexual expression, profanity, drug use, violence and other adult-oriented themes that they they would expect to see in a PG-13 movie.\n\t\n\n\tInstagram launched Teen Accounts in September 2024. They’re available to teens 13-17, who can set up an account that is supervised by a parent (who must be over 18 years old).\n\n\n\tThe MPA’s PG-13 rating, introduced in 1984, carries this advisory: “Parents Strongly Cautioned. Some Material May Be Inappropriate For Children Under 13.” Recent and upcoming movies that carry the PG-13 rating include “Tron: Ares,” “Superman,” “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” “F1: The Movie,” “Jurassic World: Rebirth” and “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.”\n\n\tInstagram explained the rationale behind the update in a blog post Tuesday. “While Teen Accounts already have built-in protections, we understand that inappropriate content remains a top concern for parents — and that our existing content settings can feel confusing. We wanted to more closely align with an external standard parents are more familiar with, to provide clarity and peace of mind that when their teen is on Instagram, they’re seeing content similar to what they’d see in a PG-13 movie by default.”\n\n\tAccording to Instagram, teens who have supervised accounts will be automatically placed in the updated “PG-13” experience and can’t opt-out without a parent’s permission. The change will apply across Instagram, including Feed, Stories, comments, recommendations and search results. It will also apply to entire accounts so teens won’t be able to follow or interact with accounts that regularly share content designated as for those 18 and older. Instagram is also introducing a new, stricter content setting for parents “who want a more restrictive experience for their teen.”\n\t\n\n\tInstagram’s Teen Accounts have built-in restrictions on who can contact teens, what content they see, and how long they can spend using the app. According to Instagram, since Teen Accounts launched just over a year ago, 97% of teens 13-15 have kept their default restrictions on and 94% of parents surveyed say Teen Accounts are helpful to them.\n\n\tFor context, here is the official description of MPA’s PG-13 rating: “A PG-13 rating is a sterner warning [than PG] by the Rating Board to parents to determine whether their children under age 13 should view the motion picture, as some material might not be suited for them. A PG-13 motion picture may go beyond the PG rating in theme, violence, nudity, sensuality, language, adult activities or other elements, but does not reach the restricted R category. The theme of the motion picture by itself will not result in a rating greater than PG-13, although depictions of activities related to a mature theme may result in a restricted rating for the motion picture.” \n\n\tThe description continues, “Any drug use will initially require at least a PG-13 rating. More than brief nudity will require at least a PG-13 rating, but such nudity in a PG-13 rated motion picture generally will not be sexually oriented. There may be depictions of violence in a PG-13 movie, but generally not both realistic and extreme or persistent violence. A motion picture’s single use of one of the harsher sexually-derived words, though only as an expletive, initially requires at least a PG-13 rating. More than one such expletive requires an R rating, as must even one of those words used in a sexual context.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmazon Prime Video has extended its U.K. film and TV industry training initiative with new programs aimed at the tackling the current crisis impacting freelancers.\n\n\tFirst launched in 2022 as a three-year scheme, Prime Video Pathway was designed to help open up jobs in the industry and supporting the development of talent, especially among underrepresented groups. Originally pegged at costing £10 million ($13.3 million), Prime Video now claims that some £12 million was spent over the \n\t\n\n\tBut with the three years having been completed, Prime Video is now extending Pathway with a £2.2 million ($2.9 million) additional grant to fund, among a variety of new and returning initiatives, programs for struggling freelancers to help them “develop portfolio careers in adjacent creative industries.”\n\n\n\tDeveloped in partnership with the National Film and Television School (NFTS), the TV Freelancers Reskill and Upskill Program is a free virtual training initiative that will offer over 60 one-day online courses reaching up to 1,000 freelancers nationwide. Meanwhile, an intensive three-month in-person program will provide dedicated support for 100 freelancers who have been out of work for more than four months across the U.K.\n\n\t“Amazon is proud to play its part with a comprehensive free training and development programme to support a freelance community we know is struggling,” said Siena Pakington, U.K. country manager, Prime Video. “We’re continuing to help upskill and reskill an industry facing unprecedented change while remaining trailblazers in apprenticeships that diversify our industry with proven opportunities for new entrants.”\n\t\n\n\tThe freelancer-focused programs were developed following research with the freelance community, with more than 800 freelancers competing a skills survey. The suite of online short courses is set to cover emerging areas such as digital production, podcasting, social media, AI, virtual production and project management, with applications now open via the NFTS website.\n\n\t“Freelancers across the creative industries are continuing to navigate significant challenges, and this expanded commitment from Prime Video will offer timely and much-needed support,” said Jon Wardle, director of the National Film and Television School. “By combining the free accessible online training delivered by the NFTS, with intensive in-person guidance, the freelance workforce will be able to expand their skills, regain momentum and lay the foundations for sustainable long-term careers.”\n\n\tAccording to Amazon, Prime Video Pathway has already delivered training for 452 individuals, primarily from underrepresented groups. It noted that 85% of those who came through the program in its its first three years were currently still employed in the TV industry. \n\n\tAlongside the freelancer programs, the extended Pathway scheme includes a number of new additions to its lineup of initiatives. Among them is a year-long set-up opportunity for six under-represented executive producers in the unscripted content space, sponsorship of the Wonder Women 2026 Mentoring Program for 31 women, a practical “Afro Hair — On Set” course in Scotland for 10 hair stylists with the Kevin Fortune Hair Styling Academy, support for Europe’s only 3-year vocational course for Deaf actors, also in Scotland, and support for the BIFA Springboard for 30 second-time feature filmmakers. Several of the original programs, including many with the NFTS, are continuing.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJeremy Renner is lending his voice to “Stardust Future: Stars and Scars,” an animated feature that its makers describe as the first feature-length film created entirely with artificial intelligence.\n\n\tSet for a November theatrical release, the project marks a reunion between Renner and filmmaker Yi Zhou, who previously collaborated on the documentary “Chronicles of Disney.” Renner plays the Oracle of Time, a narrator who leads audiences through a story spanning from the universe’s origins to 2080. The role marks a return to voice work for the actor, who suffered a near-fatal snowplow accident in 2023. \n\t\n\n\tZhou’s Into the Sun Entertainment plans to mount an awards campaign targeting multiple Oscar categories, including animated feature, original score, original song, sound, film editing and visual effects. Fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg appears in the film via a 3D digital rendering. The score combines Zhou’s compositions with music by the late Ennio Morricone, rearranged by the Into the Sun Collective.\n\n\n\tA portion of the film’s revenue will go to two charities: Renner’s Rennervation Foundation, which aids foster youth, and the Motion Picture and Television Fund, supporting entertainment workers impacted by this year’s California wildfires.\n\n\tZhou says the film blends 2D and 3D animation techniques in a way she’s trademarked as a distinct narrative approach. The visual shifts mirror thematic contrasts between past and present, imagination and reality. The production company claims no previous feature has used AI to create an entire film with this combined animation style.\n\t\n\n\tDrawing inspiration from Godfrey Reggio’s “Qatsi” films and composer Philip Glass, “Stardust Future” examines climate crisis, conflict, mortality and human awareness through a philosophical lens that questions whether advancing technology can coexist with natural balance.\n\n\t“This is a film born from the intersection of human resilience and machine imagination,” Zhou said. “I asked AI to tell me about our past and show me our future. My team and I used AI not as a replacement for creativity but as an extension of memory to heal what humanity has broken and to dream of what we will become.”\n\n\tZhou added: “AI is a tool for humanity, not to replace human creativity. It enhances our possibilities and builds what I call an immortalityscape, a vision where art, bodies, memory and technology converge to transcend time. I am inspired by its positive potential for the future, as long as we make a safe and respectful use of it.”\n\n\tThe Chinese multimedia artist’s work has appeared at major international venues including the Venice Biennale, Shanghai Biennale, Sundance and Cannes.\n\n\tOperating from Los Angeles, Rome and Hong Kong, Zhou built Into the Sun Entertainment as an integrated production company covering film, music and AI content. The female-led, Asian American and Pacific Islander-founded outfit focuses on elevating marginalized voices in front of and behind the camera.\n\n\tRenner has focused on philanthropy alongside his creative work in recent years.

    "body": "\n\tSelma Blair felt as if she was being gaslit from the time she was a pre-teen. Constance Zimmer was shocked at how much she didn’t know about what to expect about her health after she turned 50. The common thread for both actors after facing physical challenges was the realization that women need to demand more from the medical establishment.\n\n\tBlair and Zimmer spoke about their experiences as part of the Flow Space Women’s Health Summit, held in Los Angeles on Oct. 9. Blair discussed her lifelong struggle with pain, fatigue and neurological problems that were not diagnosed as multiple sclerosis until she was in her 40s in 2018. Zimmer appeared with writer and podcaster Heidi Clements in a session about the pair’s initiative to educate women about the physical and emotional changes that come with perimenopause and menopause. Both sessions were moderated by Samantha Skey, CEO of SHE Media. (SHE Media and Variety are owned by Penske Media Corp.)\n\t\n\n\t“There is a movement that is forming and happening, because for the first time in history, women have been allowed to share the shit, instead of constantly trying to pretend that everything’s great and fantastic and wonderful when it’s not,” Zimmer said. “And I think, you know, I entered into this midlife arena last year, when I was kind of catapulted into not even knowing I was in menopause or perimenopause. I didn’t even know what the word was.”\n\n\n\tZimmer gradually became incensed at lack of basic information available on what is a universal process for women at a key life stage. The mystery that still exists around menopause only contributes to the emotional struggles many women face with the transition and the end of their child-bearing years.\n\t\n\n\t“Menopause is actually the 366th day you don’t have a period. And I was like, I’m sorry, what? So what’s after and what’s before,” Zimmer said. “Right now it’s important is to use our platforms to share information, not only for ourselves going through it, but for the next generation, because we just have to show that when you get here, you should be prepared for this time, when I think a lot of us have not been, and that’s why there’s such an uprising of, why was this kept a secret?”\n\n\tBlair spoke at a separate session that was highly emotional as she described her teenage and young adult years dealing with symptoms of multiple sclerosis that were not diagnosed until she was in her 40s. Blair aims to inspire women to push harder for answers on medical issues given the traditional institutional biases.\n\n\t“I was diagnosed with relapsing limiting MS in 2018. It turned out I probably had juvenile MS as my first optical neuritis was when I was about seven, which left me with a lazy eye from nerve damage. But there were a lot of things missed my whole life,” Blair said.\n\n\tThe diagnosis was a relief after a lifetime of unexplained pains and fatigue that were often dismissed by doctors as “growing pains” or related to menstrual issues.\n\n\t“I had CAT scans as a kid, and I had doctor visits, and I stayed in hospitals for weeks at a time,” Blair recalled. “I’d have fevers, I have pain, endless, bone crushing fatigue that I still do have. And my mom would say, why can’t you give her an MRI? And they’re like, ‘Oh, she doesn’t need it. She’s probably getting her period.’ But then a boy would come in from my class who had a headache and they gave him an MRI the first thing. Now, they’re not wrong for doing that for him, but it’s like, What? Because I appeared okay, even though I had headaches all the time.”\n\n\tBlair has been vocal about her medical situation in recent years. She had no idea the power of the response that her candor would elicit.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSHE Media’s Samantha Skey, actor Constance Zimmer and writer Heidi Clements at the Flow Space Women’s Health Summit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I just put it on my Instagram to thank people on a set that were helping me stay at my job, because I couldn’t use my hands well, I couldn’t take my clothes off. I still sometimes struggle with dystonia and speech and movement, even though I’m relapse free right now,” Blair said. “But when I did post I saw that there was a whole world that was that felt seen or a part of being seen or could relate to someone having chronic health issues. I realized that was a comfort to a lot of people. And there weren’t a lot of resources out about MS at the time. There was so much I needed to learn. I’m still learning as I live with it, but I did see that it was much bigger than me. And then then it had a point to me to sharing. It felt good. It felt good knowing people were feeling some comfort.”\n\t\n\n\tZimmer and Clements, who is a well-known voice on issues around women and aging, recently launched a podcast dubbed “Talk Fifty to Me.” Zimmer said her experience of seguing into her 50s has been contrary to the stereotype that women of a certain age tend to become invisible in a world that revolves around men and youth.\n\n\t“I would say that I haven’t felt invisible. I’ve actually felt more empowered than ever before, and those are the stories that people are missing talking about because we can all choose to become invisible because we don’t have the information or the tools to use for our benefit,” Zimmer said. “But when you get those tools, everybody’s talking about menopause, HRT, or whatever you have to do to get yourself to a place where you feel full, whether it’s hormones or not, then you’re leading with your best foot forward, right? But women, even five years ago, were not given that permission to talk about this. It’s why the 50s became invisible, because there was nobody knew what the fuck was going on, and everybody thought they were crazy, and nobody would listen to them. But now people are listening.” \n\n\t(Pictured top: Selma Blair and Samantha Skey)\n",

    "body": "\n\tStudio 100 Film will present animated family adventure “Halloween vs Day of the Dead” at the American Film Market in Los Angeles (Nov. 11-16).\n\n\tWhen the candies of the rival towns, Halloween Ville and Day of the Dead Town, mysteriously vanish before their most important festivities, the celebrations are suddenly in danger. The fate of both villages rests in the hands of Pumpkid and Bony Lu, who join forces with a quirky group of friends to save the holidays and reunite their communities.\n\t\n\n\tThe film, written and directed by Celso García (“The Thin Yellow Line,” “The Great Seduction”), is a co-production between Studio 100 Intl. and Mexico’s Lunch Films. The executive producers are Martin Krieger of Studio 100 Intl., and Axel Vielma and Fernando Estrada of Lunch Films. Thorsten Wegener, García and Gerry Cardoso are the producers.\n\n\n\t“Working with Studio 100 Intl. to bring ‘Halloween vs Day of the Dead’ to life is an exciting opportunity to share a story we hold close to our hearts. Together, we’re creating a vibrant, heartfelt film that honors both traditions while telling a timeless tale of friendship, unity and hope. We believe audiences everywhere will connect with the journey of these two children from rival villages,” said García, founder of Lunch Films.\n\n\tCardoso added: “We wanted to create a film that’s not only fun and full of adventure but also celebrates the heart of Mexican culture. It’s a playful clash of two iconic traditions, told through a story that’s emotional and deeply rooted in family and identity. We hope audiences around the world will laugh, be moved and walk away with a greater appreciation for the beauty, spirit and meaning behind Día de los Muertos.”\n\t\n\n\t“Growing up Mexican in New York, I looked forward to twice as many sweets and double the ghosts. Halloween and Día de los Muertos were both part of my life, so when this project came along, it ultimately felt like home for me. After two years of spirited – and occasionally spooky – talks, I’m thrilled we’re kicking off development and sharing it at the film market!,” said Lorena Booth, senior manager sales and acquisition of Studio 100 Film.\n\n\tThe film is slated for a 2028 theatrical release.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAustralian actress Abbie Cornish, whose credits include “Limitless” and “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” and Scottish actor Dougray Scott, who appeared in “Crime” and “Enigma,” are set to star in Southern African action thriller series “The Invisible.”\n\n\tThe cast also features South Africa’s Kim Engelbrecht (“Reyka,” “Eye in the Sky”), Tim Theron (“Trackers,” “Heart of the Hunter”) and Tumisho Masha (“Mandela’s Gun,” “Invasion”).\n\t\n\n\tM-Net, ITV Studios, Scene23 and Berkeley Media Group will produce “The Invisible,” an eight-part adaptation of Deon Meyer’s novel “Blood Safari.” It is distributed internationally by ITV Studios.\n\n\n\tIn the area surrounding South Africa’s Kruger National Park, a mysterious killer begins executing local poachers. As the body count rises, local Inspector Jack Phatudi is drawn into a dangerous manhunt to unmask the vigilante.\n\n\tAt the same time, Dekker — a former bodyguard with a haunted past — is hired to protect Emma, a South African expat, who returns home to search for her brother who she believes is still alive, despite his disappearance 20 years ago.\n\n\tWhen Phatudi’s investigation collides with Emma and Dekker’s quest, they uncover a buried conspiracy reaching back to the political assassination of a pivotal African leader. As powerful forces close in, all three are forced to confront the explosive truth — one that could rewrite history, and that others will kill to keep hidden.\n\n\t“The Invisible” is directed by Jozua Malherbe, who helmed previous Meyer adaptations “Devil’s Peak” and “Trackers,” and Amy Jephta, known for “Barakat” and “Catch Ae a Killer.” The series is created by Meyer, who is an exec producer alongside Cornish and Scott, and William Josef Schneider, with the latter taking the lead in writing the adaptation. Tina Kruger serves as creative EP.\n\t\n\n\t“To say I’m proud, grateful and excited about ‘The Invisible’ as a TV series is a vast understatement,” Meyer says. “We’ve worked so hard for two years to put the series together, and now, it’s finally going into production with an excellent broadcast partner and executive production team, great writers, a stellar, international cast, a brilliant director and the best film crew in the world. How cool is that?”“’The Invisible’ is a contemporary South African retelling inspired by true events – including the mysterious plane crash that claimed former Mozambican President Samora Machel,” Nomsa Philiso, director of content: general entertainment, English and Portuguese-speaking Africa at MultiChoice, said.\n\n\t“Premiering on M-Net, this gripping tale is crafted by Deon Meyer, brought to life in Hoedspruit and Cape Town by top local talent, and supported by our co-production partners, ITV Studios, Scene23 and BMG. We’re proud of this collaboration and the platform the series will enjoy on M-Net, where Meyer’s work continues to captivate South African – and global – audiences.”\n\n\tJulie Meldal-Johnsen, executive vice president of global content at ITV Studios, said, “We’re delighted to be partnering with M-Net, Scene23, BMG and the IDC to bring this thrilling and action-packed drama to global audiences. ‘The Invisible’ marks our first scripted project from a South African producer – hopefully the first of many.”\n\n\t“We are proud and excited to be working with Abbie Cornish, Dougray Scott and a hugely talented group of creatives in South Africa on Berkeley Media’s latest international production. With our partners Scene23 and ITV Studios, we aim to bring alive this amazing African story to an appreciative global audience,” Yu-Fai Suen of Berkeley Media Group said.\n\n\t“With the success of ‘Trackers’ and ‘Heart of the Hunter’ proving the global appetite for South African stories, ‘The Invisible’ is the perfect next chapter,” Cobus van den Berg, executive producer at Scene23, said. “Based on the work of acclaimed author Deon Meyer, it’s about more than just a television series – it’s a chance to showcase our talent, our landscapes, and our storytelling on an international stage.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBAFTA nominee John Hannah (“The Last of Us,” “Four Weddings and a Funeral”) is set to lead “Death in Benidorm,” a new detective drama series launching on the Paramount Skydance-owned U.K. network Channel 5. \n\n\tThe show — which is currently a working title — comes from Blackbox Multimedia and Clapperboard and centers around Dennis, a former detective trying to escape his past who swaps the chaos of the U.K. for a quieter life running a bar in Benidorm. But when tourists start turning up dead, he’s reluctantly drawn back into detective work — egged on by his barmaid Rosa, a crime drama superfan. \n\t\n\n\tAs per the synopsis, with Dennis’ real-world experience and Rosa’s encyclopaedic TV knowledge, “each episode sees the duo tackling a new murder in paradise, whilst trying to remain on the right side of the local Spanish cops.”\n\n\n\tPlaying Rose is Carolina Bécquer as Rosa, while additional cast includes Ariadna Cabrol as Maria and Damian Schedler Cruz as Jesùs. \n\n\t“Death in Benidorm” — which sounds more-than-a-little inspired by the BBC’s long-running series “Death in Paradise” — was commissioned by Greg Barnett, commissioning editor at 5 and is co-produced by Blackbox Multimedia (“The Ex-Wife,” “The Serial Killer’s Wife,” “This Time Next Year”) and Clapperboard (“The Teacher,” “The Game,” “The Madame Blanc Mysteries”) with ZDF Studios onboard as international distributor.\n\n\t“I am thrilled to have John Hannah on board,” said Barnett. “He’s absolutely perfect for the role of Dennis — a character with sharp intellect, dry wit, and life experience — and from what I’ve seen already, viewers will fall in love with him.”\n\t\n\n\tChiara Cardoso and Camilla Hammer are executive producers for Blackbox Multimedia, Mike Benson and Andy Morgan for Clapperboard, Robert Franke, VP drama for ZDF Studios with Viviane Richard, executive drama in Franke’s team, acting as associate producer. Ian Jarvis (“The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin”) created the series, with Simon Delaney (“Death in Paradise,” “The Young Offenders”) on board as Director. Yasmine Akram (“Flack”), Claire Downes (“The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin,” “The Outlaws”) and Tom Parry (“Your Christmas or Mine,” “Your Christmas or Mine 2”) are writers.\n\n\t“Death in Benidorm is such a witty and charming addition to the cosy crime genre, and John Hannah truly encapsulates this,” added Richard. “We’re thrilled to be working with Blackbox to bring these sharply written scripts to life and, we can’t wait to share it with audiences around the world.”\n\n\t“Death in Benidorm” is now filming on location in Spain and is set to air on 5 in 2026.\n",

'cause TMZ has learned her team is actively exploring bigger venues and even a possible tour after overwhelming demand left thousands of fans in a frenzy.\n      \n    \n          Demi announced the L.A. show on her social media Monday morning, and sources with direct knowledge tell us over 200,000 people flooded the online queue for the October 25 concert at the Hollywood Palladium, which holds just 4,000 fans. Within 20 minutes, we're told the show was sold out.\n      \n    \n          Our sources say Demi's team immediately began discussing an expansion ... looking at larger venues and mapping out logistics for a potential multi-city tour tied to her upcoming album, \"It's Not That Deep,\" which drops October 24.\n      \n    \n          We're told the show was meant to be a small, celebratory performance ... a chance for Demi to reconnect with fans and debut songs from the new album, including her fan-demanded single \"Kiss,\" which dropped last Friday. But when ticket queues crashed and fans took to social media begging for more shows, the conversation quickly shifted from special event to possible tour strategy.\n      \n    \n          Our sources say the team is already reviewing options, however, nothing's locked in yet. As one source put it bluntly ... \"When 200,000 people try to buy tickets to a 4,000 capacity show, you don't ignore that kind of demand.\"\n      \n    \n          Demi's new era may have started as \"It's Not That Deep\" ... but judging by this response, it's getting a whole lot bigger.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to Demi's reps for comment ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Demi Lovato\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

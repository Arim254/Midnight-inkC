    "body": "\n\tA third “28 Years Later” movie is moving forward at Sony. Sony Pictures has decided to proceed with the film following positive fan reactions to early screenings of the trilogy’s second installment, “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple,” according to sources familiar with the development. Series screenwriter Alex Garland is writing the script for the film and Cillian Murphy is in talks to reprise his role as protagonist Jim from “28 Days Later” and “The Bone Temple.”\n\t\n\n\tThe zombie horror franchise began in 2001 with Fox Searchlight’s release of “28 Days Later,” directed by Danny Boyle. The influential and intense film grossed over $72 million at the worldwide box office on a reported $8 million budget. Fox Atomic— a short-lived Fox subsidiary— released an initial sequel, “28 Weeks Later” in 2007. The sequel had an entirely new cast and neither Boyle nor Garland were involved. \n\n\tEarlier this summer, “28 Years Later” returned to form with Garland and Boyle returning to write and direct the film. The duo envisioned “28 Years” as a trilogy, Sony made the first two films, “28 Years Later” and “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” back to back before greenlighting the third. \n\n\n\t“28 Years Later” performed well at the box office, opening to $30 million on June 20 and cumulatively grossing $151 million worldwide. “The Bone Temple” is directed by Nia DaCosta and releases in theaters on Jan. 16, but early screenings have evidently given Sony the confidence to complete the trilogy.\n\n\tAlfie Williams, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer, Jack O’Connell and Ralph Fiennes all starred in the first “28 Years Later.” All but Comer will return in “The Bone Temple,” alongside franchise newcomers Erin Kellyman and Chi Lewis-Parry and Murphy, reprising his role from “28 Days Later” for the first time since the initial film’s release.\n\t\n\n\tThough Murphy is in talks to come back again in the the third installment, no official announcement has been made regarding the cast. Boyle has expressed interest in directing the third installment in previous statements, but there has been no confirmation.\n\n\tThe news was first reported by Deadline.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNew Europe Film Sales has acquired “How to Divorce During the War,” the third feature by Lithuanian director Andrius Blaževičius, ahead of its world premiere in the Sundance Film Festival’s World Cinema Dramatic Competition.\n\n\tNew Europe described the film as “a sharp, emotionally resonant drama laced with irony.” It is “a portrait of a Europe caught between fear and denial, solidarity and fatigue, ideals and comfort.”\n\t\n\n\tSet in Vilnius in 2022, it’s a story of a high-flying executive Marija, who chooses the worst possible moment for an honest conversation with her husband Vytas about divorcing – just one day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine goes into full scale. Now the couple must navigate the process of separation as it collides with a refugee and mid-life crisis.\n\n\n\tThe film works both as a relationship drama and a war film and shows an ironic duality of the couple’s mid-life crisis and the life of the Ukrainian refugees in Vilnius. Everyday domestic situations carry an undercurrent of frustration and hidden violence, moments of chaos and absurdity coexist with heartbreak. The tension between Marija, Vytas, and their daughter Dovilė quietly reveals the aftershocks of both divorce and war.\n\n\tThe film’s creative team includes DP Narvydas Naujalis, editor Anna Johnson Ryndová, production designer Greta Vileikytė and composer Jakub Rataj. It is produced by Marija Razgute of M-Films (Lithuania), with co-producers Red Lion (Luxembourg), Feline Films (Ireland), and Bionaut (Czech Rep.).\n\n\tThe project participated in the New Nordic Films Co-Production Market and the Berlinale Co-Production Market.\n\t\n\n\tBlaževičius previously gained international recognition with “The Saint” (Warsaw and Busan film festivals) and “Runner” (Karlovy Vary Film Festival).\n\n\tNew Europe’s head of acquisitions, Marcin Luczaj, said in a statement: “We’ve been struck and impressed with Andrius’ vision and the universe, which resonated with us closely. The film is blending an intimate relationship drama with the tension of a society under pressure, and strikes a rare tonal balance: emotionally raw yet sharply observant, contemporary yet universally relatable, tragic yet often darkly comedic.”\n\n\tNew Europe’s slate includes Dara van Dusen’s upcoming “A Prayer for the Dying,” starring Johnny Flynn and John C. Reilly, Jeremiah Zagar’s “The Painted Bride,” starring Jeremy Allen White, as well as two competitors for the international feature film Oscar – Hlynur Pálmason’s “The Love That Remains” (Iceland) and Laszlo Nemes’ “Orphan” (Hungary).\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Swift revealed two of her favorite songs from her own catalog during a Wednesday night appearance on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”\n\n\tColbert initially asked Swift for her top five, a question he previously asked Dolly Parton, Elton John, Paul Simon and Bruce Springsteen. However, the 14-time Grammy winner told the late-night host that her rankings are “constantly changing,” and that she would need “a little time” to get back to him on all five.\n\t\n\n\t“I think number one is ‘All Too Well,’ the 10-minute version,” Swift said. “I’m really obsessed with ‘The Life of a Showgirl,’ the whole album.”\n\n\n\tShe continued, “I can’t really do any of the others, except I will say somewhere in the list, I think, is going to be a song called ‘Mirrorball,’ from the ‘Folklore’ album. You know, it came on the other day. A friend sent it to me, and she was talking about it, and I put it on, and then you asked me this question, so I said it.”\n\n\tSwift assured that at some point, she would give Colbert an “update” after she had sat down and deeply considered her definitive top five favorites.\n\n\tAt the beginning of November, Swift’s latest album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” logged its fourth week in a row at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. One of Swift’s most popular songs from the record, “The Fate of Ophelia,” also logged four weeks on the Hot 100 last month, making Swift the only artist to debut at No. 1 on both charts simultaneously and hold the spots for a month straight.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe “South Park” Season 28 finale brought Christmas cheer to the small Rocky Mountain town and saw Donald Trump and Satan’s baby meet an untimely demise.\n\n\tAt the episode’s climax, Trump, JD Vance, Peter Thiel and Pete Hegseth prepared for a showdown in the hospital against Stan, the Christmas Critters and Jesus over the fate of Satan’s unborn child. However, just as the battle was about to commence, a doctor rushed in with some bad news.\n\t\n\n\t“We looked at the ultrasound, and it appears that at some point when nobody was watching, the baby hung itself and took its own life,” the doctor said. Pulling out his phone, he added, “I’m afraid you can see it all in the video. The baby got hold of some bedsheets. There are a couple of minutes missing from the ultrasound, but it’s definitely a suicide.”\n\n\n\tThe anticlimactic punchline is most likely a reference to the death of convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. In 2019, while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges, Epstein hung himself in his cell at New York’s Metropolitan Correctional Center. However, the surveillance recording is missing the part when he actually committed the act of suicide, leading some to speculate about the circumstances of his death.\n\n\tAt the end of the episode, Trump throws a lavish party in celebration of his baby’s death, while Satan, completely dejected, packs up his things and leaves the White House.\n\n\t“South Park” Seasons 27 and 28 have been some of the most exposive in recent memory, revolving mostly around the Trump administration and the president’s tumultuous relationship with Satan. Highlights from Season 27 and 28 include Trump running through the desert naked, Kristi Noem’s ICE raiding a production of “Dora the Explorer Live” and Cartman vomiting all over Palantir co-founder Thiel. From start to finish, “South Park” received backlash from the White House and from members of the Trump administration, but never from the president himself.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFilms Boutique has picked up international sales rights to “Hot Water,” which has been selected for Sundance’s U.S. Dramatic Competition. Cinetic Media is handling North American sales.\n\n\t“Hot Water” is Syrian-American filmmaker Ramzi Bashour’s feature debut. Bashour, who wrote the script, was a Sundance Fellow in 2022, 2023 and 2024 with the project.\n\n\tThe film follows an American kid and his Lebanese mom, who – after he’s kicked out of his Indiana high school – hit the road west.\n\t\n\n\tThe cast includes Lubna Azabal, known for two Oscar nominated films, Hany Abu-Assad’s “Paradise Now” and Denis Villeneuve’s “Incendies,” and “The Blue Caftan” by Maryam Touzani.\n\n\n\tAlso in the cast is Daniel Zolghadri, seen recently in Mary Bronstein’s “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” and Alex Russell’s “Lurker,” as well as “Funny Pages,” directed by Owen Kline.\n\n\tAlso in the cast is Dale Dickey, who starred in Max Walker-Silverman’s “A Love Song” and Debra Granik’s Oscar-nominated “Winter’s Bone,” and in series like “Breaking Bad” and “True Blood.”\n\n\tFilms Boutique’s CEO, Jean-Christophe Simon, said: “We are glad to head back to Park City, for one last time, with such a gem as Ramzi’s first feature. His take on the traditional North American road story will rejoice American and international audiences alike. Ramzi is a talent, and the film will clearly be one of the beautiful discoveries of the festival for international festivals and buyers.”\n\n\tThe producers are Jesse Hope, Walker-Silverman and Josh Peters.

An alumnus of the NYU graduate film program, his thesis short “The Trees” won the International Special Jury Prize at Clermont-Ferrand Film Festival and the main jury prize at Prague Shorts. Bashour was featured in Filmmaker Magazine’s “25 New Faces in Independent Film.”\n\n\tHe was an associate producer on Walker-Silverman’s feature debut, “A Love Song,” which premiered in Sundance in 2022.\n",

I’m very private.”\n\n\n\tLouis-Dreyfus played Selina Meyer on “Veep” from 2012 to 2019, earning six consecutive Emmys for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series.\n\n\tAccording to Louis-Dreyfus, who also served as an executive producer, production on the final season of the HBO series had to shut down “for a year” so she could undergo chemotherapy. “Two hundred fifty people weren’t going to be working,” she added, “so I had to make a public thing about it.”\n\n\tEven though she had reservations, Louis-Dreyfus said she’s ultimately glad she shared her diagnosis because it allowed her to connect with others who were also battling cancer.\n\n\t“The good thing about doing that was that I did have this incredible experience of people reaching out to me asking me for, you know, asking me about my experience going through breast cancer, for advice,” she said. “And I was able to help and there was something unbelievably comforting about being able to do that on the other side of this trauma.”\n\t\n\n\tLouis-Dreyfus was diagnosed with breast cancer in September 2017. She announced the news on Twitter (now X), writing, “1 in 8 women get breast cancer. Today, I’m the one.”\n\n\t“The good news is that I have the most glorious group of supportive and caring family and friends,” she added. “The bad news is that not all women are so lucky, so let’s fight all cancers and make universal health care a reality.”\n\n\tWatch Louis-Dreyfus’ full interview on the “Good Hang” podcast below. \n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tKan Muftić’s “With Blessings on Your Way,” Rioghnach Ni Ghrioghair’s “Touch Me” and “Oriental Snatch,” from “Hundreds of Beavers’” co-creator Ryland",
    "body": "\n\tKan Muftić’s “With Blessings on Your Way,” Rioghnach Ni Ghrioghair’s “Touch Me” and “Oriental Snatch,” from “Hundreds of Beavers’” co-creator Ryland Brickson Cole Tews have been selected for the Berlin Film Festival’s inaugural, EFM Frontiéres Focus, a five-movie genre showcase which lifts off as horror and fantasy pics drive an ever larger part of the international sales business.         \n\t\n\n\tUnveiled Thursday, the section also features Vanessa Magic’s “Nadine Pick up the Phone” and “Split Rock,” from Ryan Glover, also from Canada. \n\n\n\tThe five projects were selected from “close to” 100 submissions, a heartwarming response, said Frontières Executive Director Annick Mahnert. \n\n\n\tAnnounced in August, the EFM Frontières Focus sets out to highlight “the depth, range and artistry of genre cinema,” the Berlin Festival and Frontières said at the launch.\n\n\tCertainly, the Focus underscores the range of current genre output. Folk horror, but unspooling in Bosnia, “With Blessings on Your Way,” for instance, delivers what looks like a potentially powerful, moving  and grounded metaphor for haunting post-War collective trauma in Bosnia. \n\n\t“Touch Me” marks the awaited feature debut of Ireland’s Rioghnach Ni Ghrioghair, who sparked large praise for the direction of her 20-minute “Don’t Go Where I Can’t Find You,” a grief-driven sensorial ghost story which played SXSW in 2022.\n\n\tAn U.S.-Brazil production, the fun-outrageous “Oriental Snatch” marks the latest from the irrepressible Ryland Brickson Cole Tews, co-creator and star of 2023’s “Hundreds of Beavers.” It will give “all the answers” to the 1971 real-life case of “D.B. Cooper”, the only documented unsolved case of plane hijacking. “Oriental Snatch” may offer more, however. A concept art poster features an armor-plated alligator sporting a Nazi armband.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Oriental Snatch’ Courtesy of Frontières\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Each title has a very different identity and offer different stories,” said Mahnert, calling “Nadine Pick Up the Phone” as a “dreamy, lighter comedy drama about trauma and a woman who meets someone in shared dreams who can help her, which I hadn’t seen before,” and “Split Rock” as “perhaps more straightforward – science fiction horror.”\n\n\t“With the tools of today, someone can shoot a film with their iPhone and have AI and are able to produce special effects. There’s no limitation anymore to imagination,” Mahnert added. \n\n\t“Genre filmmaking is enjoying a remarkable surge in creativity and visibility, attracting leading creative voices, top talent and bigger budgets and EFM Frontières Focus will place it firmly in the spotlight,” Tanja Meissner, director of Berlinale Pro, said in August, announcing the new market focus.\n\n\tCertainly, the directors of all five titles have credentials. “With Blessings On Your Way” marks the live action feature debut of Muftic, a renowned concept artist  (“Bioshock 2”) and animation director (“Kiss Me First”). A silent, black-and-white movie, the LOL “Hundreds of Beavers” grossed $1.4 million worldwide. \n\n\t“Split Rock” is Glover’s second feature after the Shudder-acquired “The Strings.” “Nadine Pick up the Phone” was selected for the Telefilm Canada’s Talent To Watch Program and won the Canadian Film Festival’s You-CAN-Pitch Competition. After “Don’t Go Where I Can’t Find You,” Rioghnach Ni Ghrioghair is reckoned one of the young directors to track from Ireland. \n\n\tThe directors can be touchingly original. “In a world saturated with technology, tactile, handmade approaches to filmmaking have become a guiding force for me, inviting the audience into the strange, emotional, and often absurd terrain of our existence,” says Magic, writer-director of “Nadine Pick Up the Phone.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Nadine Pick Up the Phone’ Courtesy of Frontières\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIf there is one trend, many of the titles are genre blenders, “Split Rock,” an eco/supernatural/body horror thriller, for example. \n\n\t“Split Rock” is in post-production. The other four titles are advancing with financing. In this sense, the EFM Frontières Focus is designed to complement Frontières Platform at Cannes’ Marché du Film and Fantasia’s Frontières Market in Montreal in July, said Mahnert. \n\t\n\n\t“Cannes focuses on proof of concept or post, and Montreal on titles in really early development or very, very early production. We get so many films in post-production that there’s enough for two events,” she added. \n\n\tA closer look at the five EFM Frontières Focus titles:    \n\n\t“Nadine Pick up the Phone,” (Vanessa Magic, Canada)\n\n\tNadine, grief-stricken, listless, 40, answers a strange help-wanted ad to share her lucid dreams. She meets a mysterious young man whose connection to her dream world unlocks long-buried family secrets. “A film about the power of dreams and the necessity of human connection when processing grief,” blurring the boundary between fantasy and reality, “ says writer-director Magic. A potentially touching entry, produced by Bonnie Do’s Toronto-based House Panther Films.  \n\n\t“Oriental Snatch,” (Chris Tex, Ryland Brickson Cole Tews)\n\n\t“The outrageous true story of the enigmatic air pirate, “D.B. Cooper” and his infamous 1971 plane heist. Where did he come from? Where did he go? What really happened on that fateful day? All questions will be answered and several more raised in this sexy, action, adventure, mystery, horror, romance! The only surefire way to learn the real story of D.B. Cooper is by watching ‘Oriental Snatch,’ where truth is spookier than fiction. Also D.B. Cooper is directing the film,” Brickson Cole Tews teased to Variety. Chris Tex (“Wind Princess”) directs.\n\n\t“Split Rock,” (Ryan Glover, Canada)\n\n\tIn the Saskatchewan badlands, unearthing an unusual boulder of highly magnetic stone, geologist Lauren’s body suffers terrifying transformations as her mind is eroded by an ancient force of destruction. Melding ecological and possession sub-genres, shot on location with widescreen, anamorphic lenses “with the tactile 16mm cinematography and practical special effects that were crafted for the film, something unique and truly disturbing,” said Glover. Produced by Toronto’s Low-End, Observer Effect and U.S., Mexico and Canada-based Prowler Pictures.   \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Split Rock,’ Courtesy of Frontières\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Touch Me,” (Rioghnach Ni Ghrioghair, Ireland)\n\n\tMarianne, an exquisite florist, suffers a fear of skin-to-skin contact, until a serial killer’s murders ignites her darkest desires. “I want to examine women’s own relationships with their bodies and with the violent male-dominated world we live in,” says Ni Ghrioghair, whose “Don’t Go Where I Can’t Find You” at SXSW in 2022. Produced by Claire Mc Cabe (“Blue Road – The Edna O’Brien Story”) at Pipedream Productions and Fantastic Films (“You Are Not My Mother”). \n\t\n\n\t“With Blessings on Your Way,”(Kan Muftić, U.K., Bosnia Herzegovina)\n\n\tDeep in the Bosnian mountains, a reclusive war survivor named Tarik is believed to have awakened malignant supernatural forces and is cast out into the forest. Embraced by hornets, he returns transformed, an otherworldly presence that haunts his wife and blurs the line between reality and buried trauma. London’s Snafu Pictures (“Bad Dinosaurs”) lead produces. The story is “born from personal experience in Bosnia Herzegovina. Many of us in the cast and crew quietly live with PTSD while pretending everything is fine,” Kan Muftić told Variety.  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘With Blessings on Your Way’ Courtesy of Frontiéres\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJacob Fortune-Lloyd, known for his roles in “The Queen’s Gambit” and “Steal,” leads the cast of “Cloud 99,” a dystopian short from the National Film and Television School written and directed by Leila Murton Poole.\n\n\tThe film also stars Olivia Popica (“The Wheel of Time,” “Liaison”) and Jayda Eyles (“Breeders”) as Fortune-Lloyd’s on-screen family, with Tim Berrington (“The Diplomat,” “Succession”) playing their eccentric neighbor.\n\n\n\tThe story takes place in a community where residents pay for access to sunlight. A father goes to extreme lengths to support his daughter’s entry in a school competition to grow sunflowers. The narrative combines intimate character drama with satirical social commentary on inequality, environmental disaster, and survival within exclusionary systems.\n\t\n\n\tMilly Pope produces the project, her second collaboration with Murton Poole after their dystopian short “Earth,” which received a best student short nomination at the BAFTA-qualifying Norwich Film Festival and was selected for Manchester Film Festival.\n\n\t“I’m drawn to exploring real-world issues in worlds that feel slightly askew – places that are recognisable yet unsettling,” said Murton Poole.\n\n\tSimon Higgins handled casting. “The stories I tell live in stylized worlds that need to feel believable,” Murton Poole said. “Simon has an instinct for finding actors who can hold emotion and authenticity within heightened spaces.”\n\n\tMurton Poole called the cast “an absolute joy” to work with, commending their ability to “bring grounded performances to a world that could so easily feel abstract.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production shot on 35mm at The Modern Appletree in Henley, where the crew converted a garden into two adjacent properties to create an outdoor set.\n\n\t“Shooting on film was a top priority for me,” Murton Poole said. “In a world where sunlight is a character, film has an inimitable way of capturing it.”\n\n\tCarolina Lobo Nunes served as cinematographer. “The shoot relied heavily on the Great British weather,” said Murton Poole, “and on our incredible cinematographer, Carolina Lobo Nunes, who somehow managed to control it.”\n\n\tThe film is completing post-production and will premiere at the NFTS 2026 graduation showcase at the British Film Institute in March before beginning its festival run.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFresh off her Oscar nomination for “Sentimental Value,” Renate Reinsve transforms in “Butterfly” – visually, too. \n\n\t“Itonje wanted me to move away from how I’ve looked before. Lily went against normal beauty norms,” she says.\n\n\t“It made a lot of sense for this character, who had grown up being exploited because of her beauty. She’s trying to remove herself from the male gaze. At the same time, she enjoys provoking reactions, but without attracting anyone’s sexual attention.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the film, shown at Göteborg and IFFR, she plays Lily, a performance artist who reunites with her sister Diana (Helene Bjørneby) in the Canary Islands after their absent mother’s mysterious death.\n\n\n\t“It’s one of the hardest things we do, and it requires constant effort: trying to get over the hurt and pain caused by somebody’s actions. See a more nuanced picture or innocence of where that came from and be free,” she says. \n\n\t“You can tell how much strain these sisters have because of how they grew up, in such an unusual way. The only way to reconcile it is through each other.”\n\n\tNorwegian actor enjoyed being on set that felt like “a mix between a fictional movie and a documentary.” Mostly because of the non-professional actors who had a real connection to the places where they filmed.  \n\n\t“I love filmmakers who try to challenge the established,” she notes. \n\n\t“Itonje’s ideas come from somewhere else. It’s so unconventional and I really admire that. Hopefully, I’ll keep on working and learning from directors with different tastes and different ways of making movies.” \n\t\n\n\tItonje Søimer Guttormsen received arthouse recognition thanks to her previous feature “Gritt” about a polarizing character who actually makes a cameo in “Butterfly.” \n\n\t“She’s such an atypical female character. You love her on some level because she’s so hard to like. There’s something sympathetic about that,” admits Reinsve. \n\n\t“I definitely knew we were moving into the same landscape with Lily. She has many traits that make it difficult for her to blend in or function as expected, and she has no intention of changing. She’s in a constant fight with the world.” \n\n\tItonje Søimer Guttormsen jokes that she’s drawn to “difficult women.”  “Women who are fighting and finding strategies, perhaps because they were wounded, neglected or abused. But Lily and Gritt are quite different. Grit has projects and ideals, while Lily is quite selfish.” \n\n\t“Butterfly,” with its focus on strained family relationships, might be her most accessible work yet. It’s sold by Protagonist Pictures.\n\n\t“It’s quite relatable, and then it shifts gears and goes off-piste. Maybe it will encourage more audience members to join in, and then I’ll take them on a journey into the wild anyway.”\n\n\tShe adds: “I don’t want to compromise. I want to be bold in my art and dig deep. Still, I would love to reach out to a wider audience. ‘Commercial’ is not the right word, but this is my most inviting film.”\n\n\tHaving Reinsve as the lead certainly helped. “In Norway, it’s all very democratic. Everyone knows each other. When we started, she wasn’t yet on that level yet, but she’s a huge star now, so people will notice the film because of her. It’s a gift, but I just knew she was right for the role.”\n\n\tWith her outrageous looks, Lily certainly stands out. But there’s a method to the madness, assures the director. \n\n\t“Lily uses clothes to armor herself; that’s how she sets herself apart, also from her sister. She’s telling everyone: ‘I don’t belong here.’ But she’s also a chameleon. She adopts traits from the people she meets. I always saw her as worn-out and definitely not healthy, and of course Renate is amazingly beautiful. She was bold, embracing that and really curious about how to enhance her looks.”\n\t\n\n\tAs Guttormsen’s characters reluctantly decide to follow in their mother’s footsteps, they get to know her through the people who transformed her.\n\n\t“She’s made an incredible journey, which a lot of Norwegians have also made in Gran Canaria. It’s our most visited island and everyone has a relationship with it. She felt trapped and neglected her own children in order to escape, but then she built a healing retreat center for women. Now, after her death, she’s healing them too.”\n\n\tWith Norway on everyone’s lips because of the Oscar frenzy, Guttormsen hopes it will bring about concrete changes. \n\n\t“What’s happening with ‘Sentimental Value’ is just amazing. It has never really happened in Norway before. The whole industry is excited and a bit dizzy from it, and I hope it results in more funding. So many people are leaving their jobs as filmmakers,” she says.  \n\n\t“Sometimes, I see institutes focusing on just one tendency. It can be ‘we need more viewers’ or ‘we need more awards.’ Personally, I want to see a variety of filmmakers. For me, an Oscar is neither within my reach nor on my radar. So here’s to hoping there will be more space for other things as well.” \n\n\tAnd for more Gritt, who might still show up in the future.\n\n\t“I know I will meet her again. I would like to see how she ages and maybe make a whole film about that. She might not appear in my next, but maybe someone from ‘Butterfly’ will? With my films, I’m creating a whole universe. It’s my world.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn the face of it, for a comfortable middle-class couple in Lithuania, getting divorced has absolutely nothing to do with the war in Ukraine. Why would it? But when their separation happens to coincide with the Russian invasion two countries away, these two very differently scaled crises wind up jointly defining a disorienting phase of family life for high-flying media exec Marija (Žygimantė Elena Jakštaitė) and slacking screenwriter Vytas (Marius Repšys). And while a whole country’s anguish may put their problems in perspective, that doesn’t necessarily make those problems easier to solve. A drily witty, subtly searing comedy from writer-director Andrius Blaževičius, “How to Divorce During the War” is both empathetic and surgical as it examines both partners’ attempts to sublimate selfish angst into social activism.\n\t\n\n\tLithuanian writer-director Blaževičius’ third feature reunites him with the two superb leads of his terrific 2021 sophomore effort “Runner,” a time-compressed relationship thriller that never broke out of the festival circuit in the way it deserved to. (Jakštaitė and Repšys also played characters called Marija and Vytas in that film, while Repšys played a Vytas in the director’s 2016 debut “The Saint”: a nod to local archetypes, perhaps, akin to Michael Haneke’s recurring incarnations of “Anne” and “Georges.”) Following a Sundance competition premiere and a directing prize for Blaževičius, the timely, accessible “How to Divorce During the War” should secure wider global distribution. \n\n\n\tThere’s been a quiet surge in Lithuanian cinema in recent years, particularly in the area of intimate, fine-grained domestic drama. Though Blaževičius’ film is tonally distinctive in its its arch realism, there’s a thread connecting it with recent festival successes like “Drowning Dry” and “Slow,” in its combination of tender everyday observation and measured formal control. \n\t\n\n\tBoth those virtues are on display in an early, crucial long take, shot with a static camera through the windshield of a parked car, as an exasperated Marija blindsides Vytas with the announcement that she wants a divorce. The ensuing conversation cycles through several stages of denial, pleading, assertion and violent anger, all as they wait for their pre-teen daughter Dovile (Amelija Adomaityte) to emerge from her violin lesson. The actors’ expressions aren’t wholly legible through the glass and the falling dusk, but the air around them is thick with curdling resentment and sudden grief. \n\n\tFor several years now, Marija’s career at a content creation company has soared while the dawdling, creatively blocked Vytas has settled into a homemaker role — an arrangement that he’s happy enough with, but she finds increasingly stifling. (She lays out these grievances in bruising detail, though is less candid about a third party’s role in her decision.) Dovile, for her part, is solemn but composed when her parents break the news: “Now you’re going to tell me you love me very much and my life isn’t going to change,” she says, having learned the script from friends with divorced parents. Like pretty much everyone else, her mind isn’t entirely on the matter: War has just broken out in Ukraine, and for most people, casual conversation revolves around nothing else.\n\n\tAt work, Marija instructs her colleagues to press on, advising they turn their phones off in office hours to reduce stress levels — though when her company refuses to close its Russian branch, she resigns in protest. But it’s a somewhat obligatory, half-hearted gesture, as is her decision to take in a family of Ukrainian refugees once Vytas moves out: She regrets her charity before long, complaining about the new arrivals’ disruption of her household order. Vytas, now staying with his growingly reactionary parents, makes a more concerted effort to join the resistance movement, staging public performance-art protests, volunteering at a food bank, and attempting to cut off his folks’ access to Russian propaganda on satellite TV. But is this, too, a temporary distraction from the internal collapse of his own life?\n\n\tThe deadpan anti-rhetoric of Blaževičius’ script is well-served by the steadily poised, standoffish gaze of DP Narvydas Naujalis’ camera, largely eschewing closeups for fixed, wide tableaux, washed in the drear of late winter. Jakub Rataj’s sparse, chilly score of ill-tuned piano and jittery percussion matches the general mood of uneasy drollery — a difficult balance also maintained in Jakštaitė and Repšys’ finely tuned, delicately ironic performances, pivoting between protective detachment and raw emotional release. It’s left to viewers to decide if these are good people reacting in human, erratic ways to bad times, or if there’s something more insidious in the compromises and hypocrisies that Marija and Vytas decide they can live with — whether in determining their political position or their living arrangements.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Department of Justice on Friday released 3 million documents from the Jeffrey Epstein files, along with 2,000 videos and roughly 180,000 images. The latest batch included mention of celebrities like Jay-Z, Pusha T and Harvey Weinstein.\n\n\tMentions of the trio did not come from Epstein’s personal records nor reports corroborated by law enforcement. The two rappers and the disgraced Hollywood mogul were named in a tip to the FBI, which was archived as part of the Epstein investigation. The tip itself does not imply these individuals were investigated, nor does it in any way imply guilt for the accusations posed.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to an FBI crisis intake report included in the latest Epstein release, an anonymous victim, who claimed she had been drugged and sexually abused in several instances throughout the years, said Pusha T (Terrence LeVarr Thornton) was one of her “handlers.” Also in the report, the victim said she once woke up in a room with Weinstein and Jay-Z (Shawn Carter) with her. The report also stated that because the victim was drugged in both scenarios, her memory was clouded.\n\n\n\tReps for Jay-Z and Pusha T did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment. \n\n\tDirector Mira Nair, the mother of New York mayor Zohran Mamdani, was also found in the new release. She was mentioned by name in an email from publicist Peggy Siegal to Epstein. Siegal wrote that she saw Nair at an after-party for the 2009 film “Amelia,” which Nair directed. The email implies no wrongdoing or investigation.\n\n\tA rep for Nair did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment. \n\t\n\n\tMessages between Casey Wasserman, chairman of the LA28 Olympics committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of child sex trafficking in connection with Epstein, were also included in the files. In one correspondence, Maxwell offers Wasserman a massage that could “drive a man wild.”\n\n\tIn a statement obtained by Variety, Wasserman said his interactions with Maxwell occurred “over two decades ago” and were “long before her horrific crimes came to light.” He also denied any connection to Epstein.\n\n\tWasserman wrote, “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.”\n\n\tAfter a rare, bipartisan push from Congress, President Donald Trump in November signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act into law, which has since brought a surge of previously sealed material on the Epstein investigation into the public eye. Trump has his own complicated past with the late New York financier, but has adamantly denied any knowledge of his criminal behavior. Throughout Trump’s second term, the Epstein files have remained a cultural hot point as well as a political one, referenced on everything from “Saturday Night Live” to “South Park.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Studio” has canceled its panel at Apple TV’s upcoming press day after star Catherine O’Hara died on Friday.\n\n\t“The Studio” was just one of the many scheduled panelists at the Apple TV press day, set for Tuesday at the Barker Hangar in Los Angeles. The streamer announced the cancellation on Friday shortly after O’Hara’s death. According to the program, O’Hara was not slated to attend the panel alongside her scheduled co-stars Seth Rogen, Ike Barinholtz, Kathryn Hahn and Chase Sui Wonders\n\t\n\n\t“We are all heartbroken by the loss of Catherine O’Hara,” Apple and Lionsgate said Friday in a joint statement. “An undeniable legend, icon, and incomparable talent, Catherine elevated every project she was a part of, including the singular genius she brought to her role on ‘The Studio,’ and every transcendent performance she gifted to us. Her artistic accomplishments will forever bring humor, light, and love for generations to come, and her brilliance and generosity of spirit touched everyone around her. We will hold her in our hearts always, and extend our thoughts and deepest sympathies to her husband Bo, and children, Matthew and Luke.”\n\n\n\tO’Hara’s manager announced Friday that the “Home Alone” star had died in her Los Angeles home after a brief illness. She was 71.\n\n\tO’Hara’s prolific comedy career started with the Canadian sketch comedy show “Second City Television” and ended with a late-career renaissance that included “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,” “Schitt’s Creek” and “The Studio.” After her death, there was an outpour of remembrances and tributes from the Hollywood community.\n\t\n\n\t“Really don’t know what to say… I told O’Hara when I first met her I thought she was the funniest person I’d ever had the pleasure of watching on screen. ‘Home Alone’ was the movie that made me want to make movies,” Rogen, co-creator and star of “The Studio,” wrote on Instagram. “Getting to work with her was a true honour. She was hysterical, kind, intuitive, generous… she made me want to make our show good enough to be worthy of her presence in it. This is just devastating. We’re all lucky we got to live in a world with her in it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJane Fonda on Friday spoke out in support of Don Lemon at a rally in Los Angeles after the former CNN anchor was arrested and indicted on charges of interfering with a religious service during a Minnesota ICE protest.\n\n\t“We are not ready to sit and be quiet. We have to speak up,” Fonda said (via TMZ). “Every American who believes in our Constitution has to speak up. Don Lemon is a professional journalist. He and his producer were doing their job, nothing more, nothing less. And he’s been arrested. And they’ll make up all kinds of defamatory things to say about him; that’s what they’re doing. That’s how autocrats act. We can’t fall for it. We have to speak up. When a red line is crossed like this, we cannot be silent.”\n\t\n\n\tShe added, “I know Don Lemon. My husband created CNN, and I will fight for their right to speak, which is guaranteed in our Constitution. They arrested the wrong Don.”\n\n\n\tA judge on Friday afternoon ordered Lemon to be released on his own recognizance. Outside the downtown L.A. courthouse, Lemon declared that his arrest would not hamper his work as an independent journalist.\n\n\t“I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,” he said. “I will not stop ever. Last night, the DOJ sent a team of federal agents to arrest me in the middle of the night for something that I have been doing for the last 30 years, and that is covering the news. The First Amendment of the Constitution protects me and countless other journalists who do what I do. I stand with all of them, and I will not be silenced. I look forward to my day in court.”\n\t\n\n\tFonda has long been an advocate for Hollywood’s most politically outspoken. In October of 2025, she relaunched the Committee for the First Amendment. Started by her father, Henry Fonda, the McCarthy-era initiative was designed to protect against attacks on free speech.\n\n\t“The McCarthy Era ended when Americans from across the political spectrum finally came together and stood up for the principles in the Constitution against the forces of repression,” Fonda said at the time. “Those forces have returned.

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” has announced its next host and musical guest, with Connor Storrie set to take over Studio 8H on Feb. 28, joined by Mumford & Sons.\n\n\tThe booking continues a high-profile season for NBC’s long-running sketch series, which has leaned heavily into budding first-time hosts, pop-forward musical guests and a newly reconfigured cast following a major shakeup earlier this year.\n\n\n\tStorrie will make his first appearance on the show, arriving amid “Heated Rivalry” fever. Meanwhile, Mumford & Sons is promoting their upcoming album, “Prizefighter,” set to be released on Feb. 20.\n\t\n\n\tThe upcoming episode follows a January run that featured first-time hosts Finn Wolfhard, Teyana Taylor and Alexander Skarsgård, with musical guests A$AP Rocky, Geese and Cardi B. That stretch marked the show’s return after the holidays, helping set the tone for the back half of the season.\n\n\tThis season has also had notable changes behind the scenes and on camera. Bowen Yang departed the series after seven seasons following Ariana Grande’s hosting stint earlier this year — an exit that marked the end of an era for one of the show’s most prominent breakout stars.\n\n\tHis departure came alongside a larger cast reset that saw longtime players Heidi Gardner and Ego Nwodim exit, while several new faces joined the ensemble, including Jeremy Culhane, Veronika Slowikowska and Ben Marshall, of previously contributing “SNL” comedy trio Please Don’t Destroy.\n\n\tNow in its 51st season, “Saturday Night Live” continues to balance legacy appeal with new voices as it navigates a post-transition period under creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels.\n\t\n\n\t“SNL” airs Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET on NBC. See the announcement below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tPete Davidson returned to “Saturday Night Live” for the cold open of the Jan. 31 episode, portraying border czar Tom Homan while he’s working with some woefully underprepared ICE agents in Minneapolis.\n\n\tDavidson opened the segment by saying, “I’m sure a lot of you are wondering why Greg Bovino, the last guy, was dismissed. I want to stress that it wasn’t because he did a bad job, or publicly lied about the shooting of an American citizen, or even, uh oh, dressed like a Nazi. It was that he was filmed doing these things, and the President no likey that. So I’m here now, and we need to tighten up. That starts with remembering the mission objective. Now, who could tell me why we’re here in Minneapolis?”\n\t\n\n\tOf course, the recruits had no clear answers.\n\n\n\tAs he continued, Davidson as Homan said, “Let’s talk about use of force. When do we want to use force? … It’s kind of a trick question, because we actually don’t want to use force. Remember, the job ultimately is about keeping America safe from … what?”\n\n\tA recruit, played by James Austin Johnson, answered, “This could be wrong, but Don Lemon?”\n\n\tUltimately, Homan agreed that the key was to avoid getting videotaped doing anything illegal: “Maybe just try not to get filmed!”\n\n\tThe episode was hosted by Alexander Skarsgård, with musical guest Cardi B. Pete Davidson launched his new Netflix video podcast “The Pete Davidson Show” on Friday, with MGK as his first guest.\n\n\tWatch the sketch below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlexander Skarsgård was joined, on his “Saturday Night Live” hosting debut, by his father.\n\n\tSkarsgård had been stoic about what’s going on in his career: He didn’t mention his new films “Pillion” or “The Moment” in his monologue, during which he mimed playing the sax along with the “SNL” band.\n\n\tLater, in a sketch seeming to play off Stellan Skarsgård‘s success this year in “Sentimental Value,” Alexander and Chloe Fineman played cast members in a Scandinavian drama (titled “Stench of a Family”) who couldn’t help but cut up between takes, laughing at the absurdity of the story and their situation. Their characters’ father, who wants to die, is lying in a bathtub waiting to say goodbye. Once the two walk into the bathroom set, they find Stellan, concealed beneath the water with a fake Incredible Hulk prop on his hand. He provides the scene’s final joke, breaking the tension once and for all by raising his Hulk fist into the air.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the sketch below.\n\n\n\n\tStellan proved himself to play against his image there, and in a sketch lampooning the practices of immigrant parents, in which Alexander played a stoic Finn, whose only memory of affection from his father was accidentally touching knees in a sauna. He was joined, at the end of the sketch, by his real-life father, screaming, “The shame is yours! Live with it!”\n\n\tThe episode’s musical guest, Cardi B, showed up in this sketch as well, playing the wife of the character played by Marcello Hernández. In a wig with rollers in, Cardi grabbed the cigarette out of Hernández’s hand and made her own case as a potential future host.\n",

There are ways that it can now feel diminished, as the streaming world absorbs some of its energy — in ways both positive (certain movies enjoy a more popular platform at home than they ever could have in theaters) and negative (the buzz/conversation/sheer presence factor of a theatrical release still transcends your living room). Yet looking over our list of the best films at Sundance this year, we couldn’t help but notice all the golden-oldie trends that remain in place. One movie, “The Invite,” provoked a ’90s-style bidding war and got sold for a headline-making $12 million, and guess what? It lives up to the hype. The documentaries, like “Give Me the Ball!” and “The Oldest Person in the World,” still ruled. And the sheer range of movies on our list has, frankly, left us a little astonished. Do you still think there’s such a thing as a “Sundance movie”? The beauty of Sundance is that the real answer to that has always been no. And it still is.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tChasing Summer\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tComedian Iliza Shlesinger escaped the state of Texas right after high school, but her hilarious, perceptive, deeply relatable comedy (directed with Judd Apatow-level skills by Josephine Decker) is all about looking back, as her overachieving character Jaime returns “home” after nearly 20 years away. Something embarrassing happened between Jaime and her teenage crush, Chase (“Smallville” star Tom Welling). She’s been out saving the world — that’s literally her job as a disaster relief worker — to prove herself to the bullies who’ve long since moved on. “Nobody’s thinking about high school anymore,” Chase says when they run into each other. He sure has changed, but has Jaime, who reverts back to her teenage self, flirting with a gallant, decades-younger kid (Garrett Wareing) at a kegger? Jaime has a lot of sorting out to do while in Texas, and Shlesigner’s insightful “you can’t go home again” story graciously lets her character fumble through it.

A two-hander set entirely within the steel-blue confines of an American men’s prison, Petra Volpe‘s drama charts with grace and sensitivity the initially reluctant but increasingly dependent connection between two inmates: a 60-year-old lifer (Rob Morgan) slipping into the fog of Alzheimer’s disease and a younger parole applicant (Kingsley Ben-Adir) enlisted to be the older man’s daily caretaker. Volpe has scant time for melodrama or farfetched buddy antics. But her film is all the more moving for that steady, solemn sense of mortal inevitability: As one man’s life gradually escapes his grasp, the other seeks to reclaim his while he still has time.

In other hands, this might have been a plausible rom-com. But Wain turns it into a fish-out-of-water comedy laced with flaky surreal dunked-in-media lunacy. It’s a smartened up homage to dumbing down, rooted in an ironic nostalgia for a Hollyweird that barely exists anymore.

At 82, King talks in rich percussive sound bites, and the film, looking back over her extraordinary life and career, showcases her feral power as an athlete, her movie-star charisma (in that thick shag haircut, she was like Diane Keaton’s jock sister), her revolutionary war for equal pay, and the trauma and triumph that surrounded her sexual identity. It all comes to a head in the 1973 “Battle of the Sexes” match between King and Bobby Riggs, which becomes one of the most thrilling documentary sequences in years.

But in Walter Thompson-Hernández’s one-of-a-kind Sundance discovery, the filmmaker — and his largely untrained ensemble — spend most of their time looking up to the skies, where passing airplanes represent the world beyond Los Angeles’ working-class Watts neighborhood. Talent-to-watch Thompson-Hernández gives them wings. Aiming to establish a new idiom to represent the community and conditions in which he was raised, the journalist-turned-director channels elements of surrealism, modern dance and Greek mythology that have never been combined in quite this way before.

Joe (Seth Rogen), a former indie-rock musician, and Angela (Wilde), a high-strung bundle of nerve endings, will fight about anything under the sun, because that’s now their way of connecting. Their upstairs neighbors, Pína (Penélope Cruz) and Hawk (Edward Norton), are everything Joe and Angela are not: mellow, glamorous, harmonious. They also turn out to be “enlightened” New Age addicts of group sex. For all the controlled rancor on display, what draws us in is the remarkable flow of the dialogue, and the quartet of actors are amazing. “The Invite” is so full of surprise, so fresh and up-to-the-minute in its perception of how relationships work (or don’t), that you watch it in a state of rapt immersion and delight. A lot of people are going to see themselves mirrored in this movie, which is humane enough to play a truth game that rings true.

Early one Sunday morning, while running through Golden Gate Park with her father (Channing Tatum), Josephine comes upon a shocking scene. Her parents’ instinct is to avoid the subject. “Josephine” eventually builds to a big courtroom moment where its title character courageously agrees to testify, but de Araújo seems less concerned with the verdict than she is with recognizing how the experience impacts Josephine, reshaping how she views the world going forward. While some might find it triggering, “Josephine” dares to confront the life-shattering intersection of sex and violence in our culture, facing the toughest of “adult situations” with clear eyes.

The statement implies that if their fate is to be haunted by an entity that takes the form of the person they are most attracted to, they would choose for that malevolent force to personify one other.

Is it by amassing the most assets? The most wisdom? Some might argue that success comes in living the longest — in outliving all your peers, to put it in slightly more macabre terms — although Sam Green’s delightfully insightful “The Oldest Person in the World” suggests there’s an age at which the gift of life starts to feel … excessive. With his sneakily profound and unexpectedly personal new nonfiction project, Green takes a deep look at the subject of mortality. In the tradition of Agnès Varda, he’s determined to glean whatever advice he can from the last few people born way back in the 19th century, but also with his own uncertain future, as the director was diagnosed with multiple myeloma during the making of this film.

The guests comprised a who’s who of that legendary period in the 1920s and ’30s when writers, actors, intellectuals and activists made Harlem a cultural hub of Black creativity and cultural ambition. Ten years after his father’s death, his son David completes this vivid and layered time capsule in which oral history is just one element of a historical excursion.

Writer-director Noah Segan’s nostalgia-powered character study quietly mourns a bygone era, when life was analog and so were its criminals. Longtime actor Segan’s sophomore feature feels like a warm embrace in defiance of an increasingly cold world that has lost its manners, along with the tactile elements worth holding onto. It’s the kind of unapologetically local love letter to the Big Apple and its less-illustrious denizens that New York deserves.

There is markedly less humor in the studied, achingly sober “Shame and Money,” which again examines social outsider status, but this time with wealth and class — whether inherited or suddenly acquired — as the dividing barriers. Though his latest is a slow burn offering little in the way of hope or levity, Morina doesn’t trade in one-note miserablism either: Intricately observed domestic dynamics keep the drama textured and humane, as does Astrit Kabashi’s layered performance as a man softly beaten down but screaming on the inside.

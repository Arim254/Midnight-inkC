    "body": "\n\tTaiwanese actor Chang Chen has been elected chair of the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival Executive Committee, taking over from cinematographer Mark Lee Ping-bing, who completes his four-year tenure. The position carries a two-year term with the possibility of one re-election.\n\n\tLee, who assumed the role in 2021 from filmmaker Ang Lee, highlighted his focus during his tenure on maintaining the Golden Horse’s independence and impartiality while supporting emerging filmmakers on the international stage.\n\t\n\n\t“After years of reflection and observation, I believe that the Golden Horse must stay innovative and energetic, and so must its chair,” Lee said in a statement. “The candidate who came to my mind was Chang Chen, whose cinematic achievements speak for themselves and whose ability to evolve with the times is especially rare.”\n\n\n\tLee noted that Ang Lee strongly supported the selection, and thanked Motion Picture and Film Promotion Recreation Organization Republic of China president Kevin Chu and the board of directors for their approval.\n\n\tChang made his acting debut in Edward Yang’s “A Brighter Summer Day” in 1991. He has earned six Golden Horse nominations for best leading actor, winning twice — for “The Soul” in 2021 and “Lucky Lu” in 2025. His performance in “Lucky Lu” also received a nomination for best lead performance at this year’s Film Independent Spirit Awards.\n\n\tThe actor has collaborated with some of Asia’s most acclaimed directors, including Hou Hsiao-hsien, Edward Yang, Ang Lee, Wong Kar Wai, Tian Zhuang-zhuang, John Woo and Chung Mong-hong. His international credits include Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part One,” Sabu’s “Mr. Long” and Kim Ki-duk’s “Breath.”\n\t\n\n\t“Through Mark’s explanations and those of CEO Wen Tien-hsiang, I began to reflect: beyond acting, what more could I contribute to cinema?” Chang said. “With the professional Golden Horse team in place, I felt reassured in accepting this entirely new challenge.”\n\n\tChang referenced a summer theater production directed by Sylvia Chang for the Gosh Foundation as inspiration for accepting the role, citing her decades-long dedication to performance and visual arts. He also invoked “Forrest Gump,” saying: “Perhaps, like ‘Forrest Gump,’ I should simply keep running. I hope the next Golden Horse will remain true to its spirit, as it has always been, and together we will keep running toward an even brighter day.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKriv Stenders has signed on to helm “Little Miracles,” a country music feature that will mark a collaboration between Australia’s Bronte Studios and First Option Pictures, with production scheduled to commence in 2026.\n\n\tThe project stems from an original concept by Mark Morrissey and features a screenplay penned by Steve Worland and Jeremy Sims. Morrissey is producing through his First Option Pictures banner alongside Bronte Studios’ Blake Northfield and Michelle Krumm.\n\t\n\n\tStenders’ previous directing work includes “Danger Close,” “Red Dog” and “The Correspondent,” which scored 14 nominations at this year’s Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts awards. Worland wrote “Paper Planes,” while Sims penned “Last Cab to Darwin.”\n\n\n\t“Country music is the backbone of Australian storytelling. Australia is the world’s third-largest country music market, yet it’s rarely seen on our screens,” the producers noted. “We believe Kriv is the perfect director to bring this beautiful story to life and have wanted to collaborate with him for a long time. With films like ‘Slim & I,’ ‘Boy from the Bush’ and ‘Red Dog,’ it feels like a natural fit for him to bring those worlds together in ‘Little Miracles.'”\n\n\tStenders added: “For me, there is nothing more magical in cinema than the fusion of music, story and emotion — an alchemy that transforms personal experience into a collective one. ‘Little Miracles’ is a celebration of that power — a story about how songs can unite us, connect us and deepen our understanding of one another.”\n\n\tDavid Hirschfelder has joined the production as music director and composer. The veteran composer’s credits span “Strictly Ballroom,” “Australia” and “The Dressmaker.”\n\t\n\n\tRialto Distribution has secured theatrical distribution rights in Australia, committing to a wide release for the film.\n\n\tAdditional casting announcements and production details will be revealed as the 2026 shoot date approaches.\n\n\tBronte Studios’ recent slate includes “Beast of War” and has action thriller “Train” and feature “Dogs of War” in pre-production for first quarter starts. First Option Pictures was established by producer and talent manager Morrissey to develop commercially viable film and television projects.\n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Sound Commentary (Updated Dec. 16, 2025): The Oscars shortlist has been announced for best sound, and the category is a symphony of chaos (in all the best ways).\n\n\tWar film (sort of?) “One Battle After Another” earns its spot with gritty, ground-level realism, where every explosion and anguished scream is meticulously orchestrated for visceral emotional impact, pulling audiences directly into the fog of battle. Meanwhile, “Sinners” continues its awards momentum with a sound mix that’s equal parts operatic and ominous, creating an unsettling sonic atmosphere that lingers long after the credits roll.\n\n\tPerhaps the coolest inclusion of the decade is “Sirât,” a more meditative international entry that proves sound excellence isn’t exclusive to English-language blockbusters.\n\n\tIn the music-driven lane, “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” turns up the volume with soulful studio sessions and stadium-worthy acoustics that capture The Boss at his most intimate and anthemic. And it would have been foolish to count out “Wicked: For Good,” which enchants with a masterful blend of soaring vocals from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, lush orchestrations and magical effects that make Oz feel tactile and alive.\n\n\t“Superman” flies in with thunderous heroics. You can hear every punch, crash, and sonic boom in a mix that makes you feel like you’re soaring alongside the Man of Steel. Then there’s “F1,” a full-throttle contender where sound practically becomes a character, immersing viewers in the roar of engines and the split-second tension of race day. “Frankenstein” takes a starkly different route, combining gothic atmosphere and eerie silence.\n\n\tAction enthusiasts and Tom Cruise devotees can rest easy as “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” has landed on the list, a fitting recognition for what’s the franchise’s final chapter. And it’s no surprise to see “Avatar: Fire and Ash” here, with James Cameron once again demonstrating his unparalleled ability to make the soundscape of Pandora feel as immersive and alive as the world itself.\n\n\tAll eligible members of the Sound Branch vote to determine the shortlist and the nominees. Academy members will be invited to view excerpts from each of the shortlisted films beginning Saturday, Jan. 10, 2025, in the San Francisco Bay area, London and New York, followed by Los Angeles on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2026. \n\n\tOscar nomination voting opens Monday, Jan. 12, and closes Friday, Jan. 16. Nominations will be announced Thursday, Jan. 22.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited artisans are subject to change, and are ultimately determined by the Academy.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: 20th Century Studios\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

Members of the Music Branch will vote to determine both the shortlist and the final nominees. Among the scores that were either not submitted or deemed ineligible: “After the Hunt” (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross), “Blue Moon” (Graham Reynolds), “Ella McCay” (Hans Zimmer), “KPop Demon Hunters” (Marcelo Zarvos), and “The Phoenician Scheme” (Alexandre Desplat).\n\n\tOscar nomination voting opens Monday, Jan. 12, and closes Friday, Jan. 16.

Switzerland’s “Late Shift” edged out the United Kingdom’s “My Father’s Shadow,” despite the latter’s recent Gotham Award win for lead actor Ṣọpẹ Dìrísù.\n\n\tWomen directors also made their mark in this year’s selections: seven of the 15 international feature films are directed by women.\n\n\tThe roster of contenders aligned almost identically with predictions, though Switzerland’s “Late Shift” emerged as a notable surprise, securing a spot many expected would go to the United Kingdom’s “My Father’s Shadow” — particularly after its strong Gotham Award win for leading performer Sopé Dìrísù. Critical acclaim and festival momentum don’t always translate to Academy recognition, especially in a category known for its unpredictability.\n\n\tNeon’s impressive five-film presence (“The Secret Agent,” “Sirât,” “It Was Just an Accident,” “Sentimental Value,” and “No Other Choice”) shows the distributor’s is gearing up for a bloodbath of its own in the international space. Will they nab all five slots? Tunisia’s masterful “The Voice of Hind Rajab” is in the running for a spot after the Golden Globe nom.\n\n\tIn other news, streaming giants Netflix (“Left-Handed Girl”) and Amazon MGM Studios (“Belén”) maintain their competitive footing. Meanwhile, Watermelon Pictures’ dual representation with entries from Jordan (“All That’s Left of You”) and Palestine (“Palestine 36”) highlights the continued push for representation from Middle Eastern cinema on the global stage.\n\n\tThe international feature film category drew 86 eligible submissions from countries and regions around the world. The Academy defines an international feature film as a feature-length picture (more than 40 minutes) produced outside the U.S. with a predominantly non-English dialogue track.\n\n\tAcademy members from all branches were invited to participate in the preliminary round of voting, though eligibility required meeting a minimum viewing requirement. In the nominations round, members from all branches may opt in to participate but must view all 15 shortlisted films to vote.

    "body": "\n\tGil Gerard, the American actor who starred as the titular hero in the 1979 NBC sci-fi series “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century,” died Tuesday after a battle with cancer. He was 82. \n\n\tGerard’s death was confirmed by his wife, Janet, in a Facebook post Tuesday evening. \n\n\t“Early this morning Gil – my soulmate – lost his fight with a rare and viciously aggressive form of cancer,” read Janet’s post. “From the moment when we knew something was wrong to his death this morning was only days. No matter how many years I got to spend with him it would have ever been enough. Hold the ones you have tightly and love them fiercely.”\n\t\n\n\tGerard also released his own statement on Facebook Tuesday night, which he asked his wife to share after he died. \n\n\t“My life has been an amazing journey. The opportunities I’ve had, the people I’ve met and the love I have given and received have made my 82 years on the planet deeply satisfying,” read Gerard’s statement. “My journey has taken me from Arkansas to New York to Los Angeles, and finally, to my home in North Georgia with my amazing wife, Janet, of 18 years. It’s been a great ride, but inevitably one that comes to a close as mine has. Don’t waste your time on anything that doesn’t thrill you or bring you love. See you out somewhere in the cosmos.”\n\n\t“Buck Rogers in the 25th Century” ran for two seasons from 1979 to 1981. The show, based on the character created by Philip Francis Nowlan in 1928, was first adapted as a made-for-TV movie, which grossed $21 million in its 1979 theatrical debut. Universal and NBC quickly began work on a weekly sci-fi series later that same year. The film was split in half for a two-part series premiere. “Buck Rogers” followed Gerard as Captain William “Buck” Rogers, a 20th-century astronaut who is frozen in space for 504 years and wakes up in the year 2491.\n\t\n\n\tGerard’s other TV credits include “Sidekicks,” “Nightingales,” “E.A.R.T.H. Force” and “Days of Our Lives.”  His more recent film credits include “Space Captain and Callista,” “The Nice Guys” and “Blood Fare.”\n\n\tGerard was born in 1943 in Little Rock, Ark. He appeared in commercials and had small roles on several popular ’70s TV shows before getting his break with “Buck Rogers.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA group of Rob Reiner’s closest friends and collaborators, including Billy Crystal, Larry David, Martin Short and Albert Brooks, released a joint statement on Tuesday in remembrance of the prolific filmmaker and his wife, Michele Singer.\n\n\t“Absorbing all he had learned from his father Carl and his mentor Norman Lear, Rob Reiner not only was a great comic actor, he became a master story teller,” read the statement released to The Associated Press. “There is no other director who has his range. From comedy to drama to ‘mockumentary’ to documentary he was always at the top of his game. He charmed audiences. They trusted him. They lined up to see his films.”\n\t\n\n\tThe statement continued, “His comedic touch was beyond compare, his love of getting the music of the dialogue just right, and his sharpening of the edge of a drama was simply elegant.”\n\n\n\tAlong with Crystal, David, Short and Brooks, signatures from Barry Levinson, film writer Alan Zweibel, U.S Ambassador to Spain James Costos and composer Marc Shaiman also appeared on the statement.\n\n\tThe remembrance went on to praise Reiner as a “passionate, brave citizen,” and Singer as his “perfect partner.” Both Singer and Reiner were outspoken Democrats who frequently advocated for political reform.\n\n\t“Strong and determined, Michele and Rob Reiner devoted a great deal of their lives for the betterment of our fellow citizens,” the statement read. “They were a special force together — dynamic, unselfish and inspiring.”\n\n\t“We were their friends, and we will miss them forever,” added the statement before closing with a quote from “It’s a Wonderful Life,” one of Reiner’s favorite films: “’Each man’s life touches so many other lives, and when he isn’t around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn’t he?’ You have no idea.”\n\t\n\n\tReiner, who starred in the 1971 sitcom “All in the Family” before directing films like “This Is Spinal Tap,” “When Harry Met Sally…,” “A Few Good Men” and “Stand by Me,” was found dead on Sunday afternoon in his Brentwood home alongside Singer, his wife of over three decades. Reiner was 78, and Singer was 70.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGar O’Rourke joins the likes of Frederick Wiseman with an immersive observational documentary that takes a sensitive look at a community attempting to relax under conditions of growing unease. Though O’Rourke is an Irish filmmaker, working with majority Irish funding, his chosen location is Ukraine, a country under attack. But this is no front-and-center war documentary. Rather, it’s about what happens outside the combat zones at a faded holiday destination.\n\t\n\n\tTo glance at it, the Kuyalnik Sanatorium, located near Odesa in southern Ukraine, could be a power station, military base or even a sewage treatment center. In fact, treatments of another kind draw everyday people to this imposing Soviet-era construction: Mud baths, massages and all sorts of other wellness procedures are the stock in trade of the striking but down-at-heel institution.\n\n\tDenys Melnyk film’s the facility’s guests with compassion but also honesty, preserving their dignity without airbrushing their reality. The variety of body types and shapes shown here, often covered in very little, is a reminder that despite the smoothness of the people held up as worthy of admiration on Instagram, most people’s bodies and faces have lumps and bumps and creases and crinkles. Showing this in such a contemplative fashion feels quietly radical in an attention economy that has normalized loudness. \n\n\n\tWith no narrator to impose an interpretation, “Sanatorium” is the opposite of a spoon-fed social issues doc: It observes, listens and trusts the audience likewise to observe, listen and to draw their own conclusions. That’s not to say it isn’t characterful or funny; it is. As guests dance to George Michael’s lush classic “Careless Whisper” at the spa disco, a viewer might recall the Austrian director Ulrich Seidl’s witty scene construction, but where Seidl’s warts-and-all work sometimes crosses a line into mercilessness, the humor here doesn’t erase anybody’s humanity. There’s always a warmth and dignity to the portrayal of the people involved.\n\t\n\n\tThere’s even a sense of religious ritual to some scenes: As clients are painted gently with healing mud and wrapped in cloth, it’s like witnessing the embalming of saints, an effect emphasized by Denis Kilty’s score. When the Renaissance painter Caravaggio first started to attract fame, a big part of his appeal was that although his subjects were notionally saints and Biblical figures, his models were everyday people from the streets of Rome, leading to Madonnas with the face of a popular local sex worker, disciples with the frame of the skinny old man selling fish in the market or a prosperous Archdeacon bearing a fleeting resemblance to the proprietor of a nearby dive bar. These are the kinds of faces O’Rourke foregrounds, similarly centering the quotidian to sanctifying effect. This contrasts beautifully with the modest effects of the treatments, as reported by the clients themselves: “Psoriasis is no longer getting worse.”\n\n\tThe location is an important character as well, with the crumbling building itself providing a striking arena for the low-key drama. The ambition and pride that would have been involved in its construction, during the height of the USSR’s power and influence, contrasted with its current state of managed decline, provides a piquant Ozymandias monument: “Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair” — a topical theme, as aging men in power across the world attempt to ensure they will be remembered, often with harmful consequences.\n\n\tWith values like wit and stoicism baked in, “Sanatorium” always felt like a long shot in the Oscar international feature race, where it is representing Ireland this year. But if the Academy were ever to introduce a category honoring most nuance, this kind of film would be a frontrunner.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a year when the Göteborg Film Festival will highlight the importance of truth, it will give its international Honorary Dragon Award to a director who has been doing that all her long, storied and multi-prized career: Poland’s Agnieszka Holland. \n\n\tOne of European cinema’s greats, Holland will present “Franz,” her non-bio, non-hagiographic but playful takes on the Czech writer, his life, inspirations and impact down to this day, where he is now part of Prague’s tourist industry. \n\t\n\n\tPrague made her, Holland maintains. Arriving in the mid-’60s from her native Poland, it gave her a film education at its famed FAMU film school, an inspiration in the Czech New Wave and a grounding in activism – she supported the 1968 Prague Spring – repression and life. This she channelled to the good in her work, a creative process observed in the final part of “Screen Tests,” (1979) one of her earliest films when she returned to Poland, which will play at a Göteborg retrospective. \n\n\n\tHolland was respected from almost the get-go. Made back in Poland, “Screen Tests” opened the very first Göteborg Film Festival in 1979. Her “Provincial Actors,” also part of  the Göteborg showcase, won a 1980 Cannes’ Fipresci Award. \n\n\tThe retrospective will also take in Holland’s most famous film, the Oscar-nominated and Golden Globe winning “Europa, Europa” (1993) where she tells the true-facts based story of Jew Solomon Perel, who survives WWII by admission to a Soviet orphanage and then Germany’s Nazi Youth. \n\n\tAsking unpalatable questions about here the frailty of European identity or about Belarus and Polish immigration policy in “Green Border,” another Göteborg title,  has turned Holland into an ethical example for many, while abominated by others. Göteborg audiences, after seeing “Green Border,” can reflect on what is happening in a Europe where Poland’s Minister of Justice, after “Green Border,” came to compare her to Goebbels and Stalin. \n\t\n\n\t“But I am not a politician,” she has told Variety’s Chief Film Critic Peter Debruge. “I think that my duty — or maybe ‘duty’ is too heavy a word, by like my aim — is to speak about the things that people don’t want to hear, maybe, and the politicians made them hostile against the voices which are rising in defense of some values which had been widely accepted 10 years ago and now are not anymore.”    \n\n\t“Agnieszka Holland is one of the most distinctive voices in European cinema and one of the most vital filmmakers of our time. With films such as ‘Europa Europa’ and ‘In Darkness,’ she has explored historical and contemporary crises through an uncompromising humanist lens. Moving effortlessly between intimate character studies and politically charged narratives, her work is marked by precision, empathy, and fearless artistic integrity,’ the Göteborg Festival observed Wednesday.\n\n\t“Throughout her career, Holland has combined artistic power with an unwavering political commitment. Several of her films have been banned, she herself has been arrested, and most recently Green Border sparked political outrage in her home country. These reactions are a direct result of her persistent determination to confront Europe’s darker realities, past and present,” it added.\n\n\tHolland’s career is, however, far broader than the works she directed in her native country. Back in Poland, Andrzej Wajda, who took her under his wing, paid her the ultimate compliment of asking her to serve as first assistant director on “Man of Marble” and help rework the screenplay of Cannes Palme d’Or winner “Man of Iron,” to make reference to events unfolding at that very same time at Gdansk shipyard. \n\n\tKrzysztof Kieślowski asked her to collaborate on the screenplays of his “Three Colors” trilogy, David Simon employed her to direct episodes of “The Wire.” and “Treme.” She directed “The Secret Garden,” a home run and also at Göteborg, for Francis Ford Coppola. \n\n\t“Agnieszka Holland has repeatedly demonstrated how cinema can be both artistically groundbreaking and deeply rooted in the moral questions of our time,” said Göteborg Artistic Director Pia Lundberg. “To welcome a filmmaker who for decades has explored the many layers of truth – the uncomfortable, the contradictory, and the profoundly human – is particularly meaningful this year, when the festival’s focus is precisely on truth.”\n\t\n\n\tHolland will receive the Honorary Dragon Award at Stora Teatern on Jan. 30. Her acceptance and an onstage interview with her will no doubt mark highlights of 2026’s Göteborg Festival.\n\n\tThe 2026 Göteborg Film Festival runs Jan. 23–Feb. 1. The full program will be announced on Jan. 7.\n",

They lined up to see his films,” the group said in their statement.\n      \n    \n          They went on to highlight his work as a filmmaker, noting the unique fingerprint he brought to projects ranging from “A Few Good Men” to “When Harry Met Sally” to “The Princess Bride.”\n      \n    \n          “His comedic touch was beyond compare, his love of getting the music of the dialogue just right, and his sharpening of the edge of a drama was simply elegant,” the statement said.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          We broke the story … Rob and Michele were found dead in their Brentwood home Sunday.

As everyone knows, Patel announced in a Sunday post on X that a person of interest was detained in a hotel room in Coventry, RL, based off a lead from Providence PD.\n      \n    \n          Other officials also announced they had someone in custody in connection with the shooting.

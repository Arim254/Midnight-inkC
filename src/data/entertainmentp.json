    "body": "\n\tThe Los Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to explore creating a $5 million subsidy for microdramas, the short-form vertical videos enjoying a surge in popularity.\n\n\tThe council voted 14-0 to direct city staff to come up with public or private funding sources to support microdrama production.\n\n\t“Many of these productions do not fit the needed requirements to qualify for state tax credits,” said Councilman Bob Blumenfield, who authored the motion. “This is a problem that we need to fix.”\n\t\n\n\tBlumenfield got the idea from his brother Jay, a TV veteran who recently produced the microdramas “Her Heart, Held Hostage” and “Hired to Obey” for the MyDrama platform. In an interview, Jay Blumenfield said that the genre has offered a ray of hope.\n\n\n\t“I do believe it’s one way that we can bring back the creative middle class in this town,” he said. “I think that’s been completely hollowed out by mergers and moguls and stupidity.”\n\n\tBut he said that tiny microdrama budgets — about $200,000 apiece — make it difficult to shoot in Los Angeles.\n\n\t“If we can get $20,000, $30,000 extra, that’s the difference between being able to do it here or not,” he said.\n\n\tCalifornia expanded its tax incentive from $330 million to $750 million last year. But projects must have a budget of at least $1 million to qualify. In Georgia, the minimum spend is $500,000 and producers can use multiple projects to meet that threshold.\n\n\tMicrodramas are generally non-union. They started in China, and many of the companies that make them are based there. Bob Blumenfield argued that Los Angeles should establish itself as a global hub for such productions.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s pretty new here, but there’s a lot of American players getting in,” Jay Blumenfield said. “I still think a lot of the Chinese companies and foreign companies want to shoot here. They like the American creatives and actors and all that.”\n\n\tBob Blumenfield’s proposal calls on the city to explore reducing permit fees and to look into creating a “micro-budget concierge” that would provide a three-day permit approval process.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKid Rock gave an impassioned testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee earlier today, addressing the ongoing issues plaguing the ticketing industry and the unfair practices employed at the expense of both artists and fans.\n\n\tIn his five-minute speech at the hearing, titled “Fees Rolled on All Summer Long: Examining the Live Entertainment Industry,” the musician outlined how the ticketing industry has evolved on the promise of lowering costs and benefitting all areas of live entertainment, but has in turn become an industry plagued with “fraud and abuse.”\n\t\n\n\tRock, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, explained earlier today that he was in a “unique position” to testify before Congress because “unlike most of my peers, I am beholden to no one — no record companies, no managers, no corporate endorsements or deals. To put it plainly, I ain’t scared to speak out on these issues like many artists, managers and agents are for fear of biting the hand that feeds them.”\n\n\n\tHe referred to Pearl Jam’s testimony in 1994 against Ticketmaster having a monopoly over the ticketing business, and turned his attention to Live Nation and Ticketmaster’s merger that led to the formation of Live Nation Entertainment in 2010.\n\n\t“In 2009, Congress was told under oath that merging Live Nation and Ticketmaster would benefit artists and fans,” said Rock. “The CEO of Live Nation called the merger an experiment, and promised it would increase competition and lower costs.” He continued, “Needless to say, that experiment has failed miserably. Independent venues have been crushed. Artists have lost leverage. Fans are paying more than ever, and getting blamed for it. Should Ticketmaster and Live Nation be broken up? Probably. Would that alone fix things? Not sure it would. But I am sure of this: no artist should be forced to sell their tickets without a say in who sells them and how they are sold.”\n\t\n\n\t“It’s no secret,” he said, “that this industry is full of greedy snakes and scoundrels. Too many suits lining their pockets over talent they never had and fans they mislead. The truth is, much of this could have been or still could be solved through technology, especially proof of humanity tools. It hasn’t happened yet because there’s just too much money in the secondary ticket market. Ticketing companies didn’t fail to stop this; seems they chose not to.”\n\n\tRock implored Congress to subpoena the contracts throughout the industry and said that they would find “mountains of fraud and abuse.” He concluded by offering various solutions to the issues, including artists controlling who sells their tickets and how; resale ticket price caps; and outlawing speculative ticketing. “This wasn’t an experiment,” he said. “It was a monopoly dressed up as innovation. So I’ll close now with the words of one of my favorite rock bands, the Who, and say it is my sincere hope we won’t get fooled again.”\n\n\tRock has made fixing the ticketing industry a priority in his career, meeting with Donald Trump in March 2025 as the President signed an executive order intended to protect fans by cracking down on exploitative ticket scalping.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatthew Lillard told Entertainment Weekly that it was “beautiful” to see fans and industry names come to his support last year after Quentin Tarantino publicly dissed him along with fellow actors Paul Dano and Owen Wilson. During a viral interview on “The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast” last fall, Tarantino slammed Dano as “the weakest fucking actor in SAG” and added that “I don’t care for” Lillard or Wilson. \n\n\t“It was like living through your own wake,” Lillard said about the resulting tributes to his career on social media that were posted to combat Tarantino’s comments. “All those R.I.P. emails or tweets and Instagram posts and TikToks, all of the things we see after somebody passes are so sweet. And the reality is I just got to live through all of it firsthand — alive and kicking! I can’t imagine a more lovely reaction to what happened.”\n\t\n\n\t“It was crazy. I keep showing it to my wife to convince her that I am worthy, that people still like me,” Lillard added. “Nobody has to like me. Nobody has to like any actor out there, obviously. It’s personal preference. I am not everyone’s first choice, that is obvious, but to then have that kind of reaction was beautiful.”\n\n\tMany of Lillard’s former Hollywood collaborators used social media to champion him after Tarantino’s comments went viral. Mike Flanagan, who directed the actor in “The Life of Chuck” and cast him in the upcoming “Carrie” series reboot, called Lillard the “the goddamn greatest.” James Gunn worked with Lillard on the “Scooby Doo” movies and called him “one of my favorite guys (and actors).” George Clooney even accepted a prize from AARP earlier this year and said that he “would be honored to work with” any of the actors Tarantino dissed.\n\t\n\n\tDano similarly received widespread support from fans and industry colleagues. Speaking to Variety, Dano said “it was really nice” to see such a reaction and “I was also incredibly grateful that the world spoke up for me so I didn’t have to.”\n\n\tLillard originally weighed in on Tarantino’s comment while speaking at GalaxyCon in Columbus, Ohio. He said “who gives a shit” while also acknowledging that “it hurts your feelings. It fucking sucks. And you wouldn’t say that to Tom Cruise. You wouldn’t say that to somebody who’s a top-line actor in Hollywood.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Will Poulter’s agents sent him the script for “Union County” and writer-director Adam Meeks’ accompanying 2020 short film, he was struck by the filmmaker’s approach to telling a recovery story.\n\n\tThe thing that set it apart from other takes on the opioid crisis, Poulter told Variety, was “the fact that it didn’t really start with a story and then a search for a place, but rather the story that was being told was a reflection of the real work that was being done.”\n\t\n\n\t“Union County” follows Poulter as Cody Parsons, a young man entering a court-ordered drug rehabilitation program in rural Ohio alongside his brother Jack (Noah Centineo). Meeks’ extended family lives in the area, and six years ago, he began developing the story after his uncle introduced him to the drug court judge, who invited him to sit in on a meeting. But what makes the filmmaker’s approach particularly unique is that the majority of his cast are nonprofessional actors; they’re real-life participants in the program, bearing their truths on camera.\n\n\t“With Adam being from the area, and them having spent so much time within the community, making it in collaboration with folks who are part of the recovery community, it just meant that it was coming from such a respectful and responsible place,” Poulter explained, sitting beside the filmmaker for Variety’s “Anatomy of a Film: Union County” conversation at Sundance. “I felt very lucky to be the outsider coming in and being trusted with a part in it.”\n\n\tThe ultimate insider of this story is Annette Deao, who has worked as a therapist in the adult recovery court for more than 20 years.\n\t\n\n\t“Annette is the heart and soul of this program and of recovery efforts in Ohio, and so the whole short film that became the feature was really born of our friendship,” Meeks said.\n\n\tIn the short, Deao played a counselor named “Debbie.” She had two scenes. “After we shot the second scene, I went up to you, and I was like, ‘I knew you’d be good, but I didn’t know you’d be this good,’” Meeks recalled. “And you said, ‘Oh, I didn’t tell you? I studied acting for four years before I ran this drug court program.’”\n\n\tThe crowd assembled at the Adobe House on Main Street laughed as Deao chimed in: “It was really the standing joke. My undergraduate [degree] was in theater and music, and then I went back to school to become a therapist, thinking I would become a music therapist at some point. But, you know, it led somewhere else.”\n\n\tThrough his own laughter, Meeks added: “Needless to say, I wrote a much larger role for her in the feature.”\n\n\tAs for how he developed “Union County’s” hybrid narrative, Meeks said that he’d always been interested in “ways that we can break down these dividing lines between fiction and nonfiction.”\n\n\tHe explained: “It was also important to fictionalize the core narrative, both as a way to get to a certain kind of intimacy of storytelling and a character portrait, but also to allow us as filmmakers to observe the difficult moments and the kind of treacherous nature and do it without imposing that on somebody who’s going through recovery. It’s an extremely difficult, long process that doesn’t need a camera crew alongside it.”\n\n\tAs the project evolved from the short film to the feature, the crew focused on building relationships with the people of Bellefontaine, Ohio (pronounced Bell Fountain).\n\n\t“Between the short, and scout trips and research trips, we’ve been hanging around your world for so long that by the time it came to making the film, there was just a lot of comfort and a lot of trust there,” cinematographer Stefan Weinberger said. “We felt like we could blend in a bit with the scenery in the drug court, and people were just incredibly open and honest with their stories. That was such a beautiful privilege for us to be able to witness and to film.”\n\n\tTo play the role, Poulter had to drop his British accent and master a Midwest drawl. To do so, he worked with dialect coach Sonja Field and studied documentary footage the team had shot of the locals. Most helpful, though, was the time Poulter spent in Ohio getting to know the community at large.\n\t\n\n\t“The year prior [to filming], we went out and spent some time, and that I was important to fortify the trust and the relationships that you see on screen, and in terms of getting a sense of how folks speak,” Poulter said. “It’s one of the friendliest places you could possibly imagine. That was quite shocking as a Londoner, people being nice to you in the street.”\n\n\tPoulter would stick to the Midwest accent between takes, and he got so good, Meeks said, that he’d often forget the actor was British.\n\n\t“There were so many moments — and I, hopefully, only expressed them out loud a few times — where, at the end of a week or at the end of a day, I’d be like, ‘Why is Will talking in a British accent?’” Meeks said, laughing.\n\n\tEditor and producer Sean Weiner added: “I remember on Fridays at the end of the shoot, we would hear, ‘Wrap for the day,’ and the crew would yell out like, ‘Will’s British again!’”\n\n\tPoulter and Centineo also shed a considerable amount of weight to portray young men coming out of the throes of addiction. But fasting grows tiresome and lonely, and they’d grown close to Deao. So, one day, the actors reached out to ask if they could come hang out.\n\n\t“We live in an about 200-year-old bank barn that’s renovated into a house, so we have about 18 acres and some gardening and some animals,” Deao said, recounting the conversation. “My husband said, ‘Well, we have some mulch to lay…’ And they’re like, ‘We’re in!’ So, they come out to the farm, and they’re throwing mulch for us; we’re grilling on the barbecue, having a great time. But we invited the whole crew out — we have a lot of space — and we did a tie-dye party.”\n\n\tBehind the scenes, the indie film production was a well-oiled machine, but it also felt like a family. \n\n\t“We broke bread together; we laughed together; we threw mulch together,” Deao said, as her fellow panelists doubled over laughing at the memories. “It was beautiful. And I don’t think that Noah had ever seen a cow.”\n\n\tWatch the full interview above to learn more about the cast and crew’s special bond, commemorated by a flock of chickens living on Deao’s farm.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Housemaid” has sliced through $300 million at the global box office, a major milestone for the mid-budget movie.\n\n\tSo far, the R-rated psychological thriller, starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, has earned $116 million domestically and a particularly impressive $189.1 million internationally, bringing its global tally to $305 million.\n\n\tLionsgate spent just $35 million to produce “The Housemaid,” which means it’ll be wildly profitable for the studio. The film opened ahead of Christmas with a modest $19 million in North America and then remained a draw well into the new year, thanks to positive reviews and word-of-mouth. Last weekend, “The Housemaid” was No. 1 in several overseas territories including the United Kingdom, France, Mexico, Brazil and Spain — a feat considering the film debuted nearly a month ago in those markets. Top-earning territories include the United Kingdom ($36.4 million), France ($33.4 million), Latin America ($26.2 million), Australia and New Zealand ($15.3 million) and Spain ($12.5 million).\n\t\n\n\tDirected by Paul Feig and based on Freida McFadden’s best-selling novel, the twisted story follows a young woman (Sweeney) with a mysterious past who is hired as the live-in maid for a very wealthy family. Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar play the husband and wife whose perfect life is far from what it seems. Given the film’s outsized success — and that McFadden wrote two sequels — a second installment, “The Housemaid’s Secret,” is already in the works, with Sweeney, Feig and actor Michele Morrone (who plays the groundskeeper) expected to return.\n\t\n\n\tWith this benchmark, “The Housemaid” ranks as Sweeney’s highest-grossing film as a starring vehicle, surpassing 2023’s sleeper hit “Anyone but You” ($220.2 million). Sweeney’s credits also include Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” which earned $392 million globally, but she only has a brief appearance in that movie. “The Housemaid” was released shortly after the theatrical collapse of last November’s “Christy,” a biographical drama in which Sweeney portrayed the trailblazing boxer Christy Martin. The R-rated film was rejected with $1.3 million to start and left theaters with a tragic $1.9 million.\n\n\t“The Housemaid” is also Feig’s biggest movie, overtaking 2011’s smash comedy “Bridesmaids” ($289.3 million). This is producer Todd Lieberman’s fourth film to gross above $300 million following 2017’s “Beauty and the Beast” remake, 2009’s rom-com “The Proposal” and 2017’s coming-of-age drama “Wonder.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Boys” baddie Antony Starr will next star in a scripted Netflix series titled “Breakers,” from the creator of “Somewhere Boy” and production company behind “Baby Reindeer.”\n\n\t“Breakers” follows two best friends from America who go on a backpacking trip in Australia. There, they encounter a seemingly perfect community of surfers and are drawn in by its leader, a charismatic and mysterious figure named Brando (Starr).\n\n\n\tProduction on the series has already begun in Western Australia, and filming will wrap in June. “Breakers” marks the first Netflix series to shoot in Western Australia and is supported by local tax incentives.\n\t\n\n\tPete Jackson (“The Death of Bunny Munro,” “Somewhere Boy”) is the writer on the series, which will be directed by Mary Nighy (“Say Nothing,” “Industry”) and Ng Choon Ping (“What It Feels Like For A Girl,” “Femme”).\n\n\tThe show is produced by the BBC Studios-owned Clerkenwell Films, which was behind “Baby Reindeer” and “The End Of The F***ing World.” The show is produced in partnership with BBC Studios Productions Australia. Executive producers are Gavin O’Grady, Petra Fried, Wim De Greef and Jackson.\n\n\tStarr is coming off a five season run on Amazon Prime Video’s “The Boys,” which will air its final season in April. He recently wrapped production on Neon’s “Samo Lives,” in which he will play Andy Warhol. His other credits include Netflix’s “Banshee,” Amazon’s “G20,” “Cobweb” and “American Gothic.” He also recently cameoed on Apple TV’s Seth Rogen comedy “The Studio,” playing a fictionalized version of himself.\n\n\tDeadline broke the news.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLegendary Oscar-nominated producer James Schamus, who oversaw films like “Brokeback Mountain,” “Lost in Translation” and “The Pianist” during his tenure as CEO of Focus Features, spoke at length about issues such as AI, Netflix’s Warner Bros. deal and the pitfalls of algorithm-based distribution during a keynote talk at Sweden’s Göteborg Film Festival.\n\n\tSchamus, now the head of the New York-based company Symbolic Exchange, has recently been behind acclaimed indie titles such as Kitty Green’s “The Assistant.” He is in Göteborg as the head of the festival’s Ingmar Bergman competition, platforming first-time directors, and kicked off activities at the event’s prestigious Nordic Film Market by providing a broad take on the current state of the audiovisual industry. Speaking about the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal, the screenwriter said, “consolidation is the name of the game right now.”\n\t\n\n\t“Ted Sarandos is a brilliant businessman and leader,” he added. “He’s very clear that he considers his competition to be anything that would take your attention away from a screen that he would be controlling, so that’s where we are. The attention economy is a distraction economy. It requires the production of human viewers who are in such a state of distraction that they will be stuck within whatever data environment a media conglomerate is trying to control. Our job is to try to resist the content death and the third law of content thermodynamics that would make every single thing we do completely predictable.”\n\n\n\tThe producer categorically concluded the thought by saying, “It’s going to be bad news for a while at least. It’s going to get worse before it gets better.”\n\t\n\n\tStill on the subject of the impact of Netflix and other major global streamers, Schamus spoke in depth about the issue with “taste communities.” Netflix divides its huge subscriber base into thousands of these smaller communities, based on viewers’ past viewing behavior. These groups help inform what is shown on the streamer’s landing page, as well as refining each user’s algorithm. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Assistant”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto courtesy of Bleecker Street\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It used to be that, if you made a movie, you would want to sell your movie or show to the distributor platform that you knew wanted to share your show or film with the largest possible number of people in the universe,” said Schamus after enquiring if anyone in the audience was aware of the logistics of taste communities. “They would be proud to let as many people in the world know about the thing you made, right? That is literally the opposite of the business model of every downstream distributor that is now the economic engine of our entire collective industry. I’m not making this up. The people to whom you are selling your show, their number one job, believe it or not, is to make sure as few people as humanly possible know about your show.”\n\n\tThe veteran explained how the top-left corner of Netflix’s landing page is the “real estate.” If users continuously scroll past those first few offerings, frustration ramps up, and a sense of “there is nothing here for me to watch” grows. If this experience repeats itself a few times, the chance of a streamer losing that subscriber goes up substantially. “It’s the opportunity that makes or breaks these platforms. If they get it wrong too many times, you start scrolling and then they’re dead.”\n\n\t“You must be in a state of distraction to be their ultimate client,” he added. They don’t want you to choose. If you’re choosing, they’ve already lost you. Netflix spent $18 billion on content last year. That means that, every week, between $200 million and half a billion dollars is like sperm swimming up to the left, trying to get there.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJames Schamus at the Göteborg Film Festival, courtesy of Rafa Sales Ross\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTaking a sharp turn, Schamus said he finds “inspiration” in “the capacity for humans to show up.” The seasoned producer brought up the current situation in Minnesota, currently the epicentre of large sociopolitical unrest following the second fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in the state in less than a month. Earlier in January, Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE officer, followed by Alex Pretti being killed by another officer on Saturday. \n\t\n\n\t“The greatest part of the terrible news from the United States right now is that Minnesota had a general strike last week,” he said. “Every teacher, every postman, everybody showed up. People are showing up for each other on a day-to-day basis. When you’re producing and you go scouting to different towns and places, you have a reason to go into people’s houses, which is so interesting. That kind of ability to break through barriers, we have that privilege, and it’s wonderful to use it to tell stories.”\n\n\tFinally, the producer briefly commented on his duty as the head of Göteborg’s Ingmar Bergman competition, saying he loves such experiences because it means watching early-career films. “In general, these are not going to be the most accomplished films at a festival,” he pointed out. “You’re literally watching people actively struggle with a medium that they haven’t yet totally taken control of. The excitement of that is watching people do things that, because they don’t have that control, are often far more interesting than things that are done by pros like me.”\n\n\tAs for the near future, Schamus just wrapped a mainstream comedy shot in Mexico, which he briefly called “a huge commercial proposition for Latin America.” The “Indignation” director is also slated to serve as consulting producer and writer on “The Boroughs,” the next series from the creative team behind “Stranger Things.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tActor Paul Dano has finally spoken out after Quentin Tarantino dissed his performance in Paul Thomas Anderson’s seminal 2007 film “There Will Be Blood.” Tarantino also called  Dano — himself an Emmy, Golden Globe and Indie Spirit Award nominee — the “weakest fucking actor in SAG.”\n\n\tAhead of a 20th anniversary screening of “Little Miss Sunshine” at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, Dano was asked about Tarantino’s comment but was beat to the punch by co-star Toni Collette, who said: “Are we really going there? Fuck that guy! He must’ve been high… it was just confusing. Who does that?”\n\t\n\n\tDano never commented publicly on Tarantino’s diss and said all of the tributes to his work that poured in across social media spoke for themselves. \n\n\n\t“That was really nice,” Dano told Variety. “I was also incredibly grateful that the world spoke up for me so I didn’t have to.”\n\n\t“Little Miss Sunshine” directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris also weighed in the Tarantino controversy. Dayton called Tarantino’s remarks an “embarrassment,” adding: “I can only think that his rawness of his performance made Tarantino uncomfortable. He couldn’t be easily filed.”\n\n\tFaris noted, “You know what was interesting was the people coming out to defend Paul. There was immediately… he is loved by so many. He is so smart.”\n\n\tTarantino ignited a firestorm almost two months ago, appearing on Brett Easton Ellis’ podcast to discuss his ranking of the best movies of the 21st century. The director revealed he would have chosen “There Will Be Blood” as his first or second pick but Dano’s performance, in his opinion, pushed it to fifth on his list.\n\t\n\n\t“Obviously, it’s supposed to be a two-hander. But it’s also drastically obvious that it’s not a two-hander,” Tarantino told Ellis, referencing Dano and the film’s lead Daniel Day Lewis. “[Dano] is weak sauce, man. He is the weak sister. [Daniel] is eating him [alive]. Austin Butler would have been wonderful in that role. He’s just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy. Daniel Day-Lewis shows that he doesn’t need a strong foil. The movie needs it. He doesn’t need anything. It’s supposed to be a two-hander and it’s not! … you put him with the the weakest fucking actor in SAG? The limpest dick in the world?”\n\n\tTarantino then threw shade and two other performers, saying “I don’t care” for Owen Wilson or Matthew Lillard either as actors. Lillard reacted to the diss at December’s GalaxyCon saying “it hurts your feelings. It fucking sucks. And you wouldn’t say that to Tom Cruise. You wouldn’t say that to somebody who’s a top-line actor in Hollywood.”\n\n\tTarantino’s candidness instantly backfired, resulting in an outpouring of industry and fan support for Dano and his talents — including a knock from George Clooney, who accepted a prize from AARP earlier this year and said that he “would be honored to work with” Dano and the other actors Tarantino dissed.\n\n\t“Little Miss Sunshine” will host a 20th anniversary screening here in Park City on Wednesday night, a remarkable run as a box office hit and Oscar winner that redefined what indie film success could look like. Stay tuned to Variety for more coverage from the event. \n",

    "body": "\n\tGrammy Week is always full of star-studded events, but the courtyard at the Chaplin Lot before the second annual Resonator Awards was the kind of scene that makes you feel like you’re in a documentary.\n\n\t Olivia Rodrigo and St. Vincent are laughing together over there while Dave Grohl greets Thundercat with a bear hug nearby and there’s Nancy Wilson from Heart in an awesome vivid magenta outfit. There’s Fred Armisen and Bon Iver and Maggie Rogers and Anderson .Paak and “Excuse me we’ve got Joni coming through” as a security man parts the crowd for the divine Ms. Mitchell, who recorded some of the greatest albums of her near-peerless catalog in this legendary place more than a half century ago.\n\t\n\n\tThere are few more storied Hollywood locations than the 109-year-old Chaplin Studios, founded in 1917 by actor Charlie Chaplin, which became the home base of A&M Records during the 1960s — with a legendary studio where countless classic albums were recorded — and later the Jim Henson Company, until the lot was purchased by singer-songwriter John Mayer and film/TV producer McG last November and restored to its original name earlier this year (although the men’s and women’s rooms are still marked with Kermit and Miss Piggy signs).\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChaka Khan (Photo by Christopher Polk/Billboard via Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBillboard via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe recording studio’s iconic history makes it a perfect site for the Resonator Awards, a female-forward event helmed by Grammy-winning mastering engineer Emily Lazar and her foundation We Are Moving the Needle. The evening primarily honors female, trans and non-binary producers, engineers and others behind the scenes, and features a jaw-dropping list of top-shelf talent as well. \n\t\n\n\tHonorees and presenters included Joni Mitchell, Chaka Khan, Olivia Rodrigo, Doechii, St. Vincent, Haim, Laufey, Nancy Wilson, Addison Rae and collaborators Elvira Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser, 2025 Grammy songwriter of the year Amy Allen and many more, with performances from Lalah Hathaway, Maggie Rogers, Sia, Flo, and Margo Price with Jim James, who covered the Christine McVie composition “Everywhere.” (Haley Williams and Lucius were scheduled to appear but did not, presumably due to travel complications in Nashville.) Chappell Roan’s touring musicians comprised the core of the all-female house band, which crushed it throughout the evening and earned multiple compliments from the honorees. (A full list of honorees and presenters appears below.) \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJoni Mitchell (Photo by Christopher Polk/Billboard via Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBillboard via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere was an all-star auction in the middle where, among multiple other winners, Doechii won a trip to Mykonos as part of a raffle where a couple dozen $100 donors dropped their auction paddles into a basket collected by a staffer; St. Vincent had written her acceptance speech on hers and ended up freestyling a rambling, “Grey Gardens”-esque speech with several “I wish I had that fucking paddle!” interjections.\n\n\tAll of the above made for a very long night that, between the cocktail hour and ceremony, stretched from 5 p.m. until nearly 11. Anderson .Paak and Taylor Swift/ Gracie Abrams collaborator Aaron Dessner paid tribute to their beloved collaborators, respectively Grammy-nominated producer Alissia and engineer Bella Blasko.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDoechii (with her winning auction card) presenting to Jayda Love (Photo: Chris Willman)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAllana Haim, flanked by sisters Danielle and Este, recalled being “Valley Girls making the big drive over the hill” and riding past the lot, wondering “what amazing music was being made here, where the great Joni Mitchelll and Chaka Khan and Karen Carpenter and so many others recorded.”\n\n\tShe spoke of the sisters’ resilience in their early years. “Standing here, it’s quite surreal to be receiving this award because honestly we just feel like three sisters following our gut,” she continued. “But let it be known there were plenty of times people, especially in our early days, tried to drive us off of our path.\n\t\n\n\t“We were told everything under the sun, such as, ‘No one wants to see girls play instruments.’ ‘Maybe you should dress as schoolgirls as a cute little fun gimmick’ — it’s true, it happened. Or ‘Why so many guitar solos? You should sound less rock.’ But because of our extreme tunnelvision, it was easy to stick to our path. And after being a band for almost 20 years, we get to stand here and say we are the first all-female rock band to be nominated for the best rock album Grammy.” She concluded by encouraging young women to pick up instruments, get in the studio and “always trust your gut.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHaim (Photo: Chris Willman)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRodrigo spoke of the vast influence that St. Vincent (aka Annie Clarke) had on her as a young artist — which was also demonstrated when Vincent presented Rodrigo with the Storyteller award at Variety’s Hitmakers event in 2023.\n\n\t“There are moments in which the road you set out upon is forever changed,” in her case “that moment when 14-year-old you clicks on the video for the St. Vincent song ‘Cruel’ on YouTube.\n\n\t“I’m not being hyperbolic when I say that video changed me,” she continued, “and in that moment needed to know everything about this artist.” She listed off several albums that featured “Some of the cleverest lyricism and most dangerous guitar riffs my young ears had ever encountered.\n\n\t“I became particularly fixated on the song ‘Surgeon,’ which is inspired by a letter Marilyn Monroe wrote to her acting teacher Lee Strassberg. I know this story not because Annie told me, but because I chose the song as a literary text to analyze in my 11th grade English class, which is a very nerdy way to say I love you, Annie, but I mean it.”\n\n\tSt. Vincent thanked Rodrigo, saying “Olivia, you give me all hope for the future, and you are one of the best motherfuckers I have ever met” at the beginning of her five-minute, free-form acceptance speech, which was broken up with frequent digressions about the paddle, her wife and child, the lighting in the room, the award’s resemblance to a vase, and more.\n\n\tAfter being introduced by Nancy Wilson, Chappell Roan walked onstage to accept the Harmonizer Award — honoring a creator who uses music to leverage social change — as her band played the crushing riff to Rage Against the Machine’s “Bulls on Parade,” which made the singer burst into peals of laughter.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNancy Wilson and Chappell Roan (Photo by Christopher Polk/Billboard via Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBillboard via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I told them to pick a walk-on song to surprise me that would make me laugh,” she said, “and it did! That was awesome.”\n\n\tShe grew more serious as she continued. “It’s late and I cut my own speech to a fourth of the length, so… thank you Nancy Wilson, thank you We Are Moving the Needle for having me here tonight and recognizing me with the Harmonizer award.”\n\n\tShe put down her notes. “I feel very uncomfortable being told that I’m a good person — this isn’t in the teleprompter, whoever’s working that, just give up! — I think because of some type of Christian guilt or something. But it’s cool when people you really look up to think you’re a good person or think you’re doing good things. But I only know what to do because I see other people in my life doing good things, like listening to trans people who need representation, and money for health care and rent, and I think it’s an artist’s and anyone who has money’s duty to give it away.”\n\n\n\tReferring back to the award’s name and the current climate in the country, she concluded, “I don’t really know what else there is to harmony other than giving, so thank you for recognizing me. I don’t really know what’s going to happen to women or gay people or people of color, or really anyone. But I think the only thing that matters is community and kindness and giving away what you have.”\n\n\tThe evening wound to its conclusion with Joni Mitchell, who spoke of her long friendship and collaboration with top honoree Chaka Khan and recalled an incident at what she said was an inebriated dinner.\n\n\t“There was a night that we met in an Italian restaurant, there was a waiter there and Chaka was speaking German to him. I ordered some food but mostly we just drank. And suddenly Chaka said to me ‘Stand up!’ So I stood up and she dashed for the door so it was like dine and dash — that’s not my way, really,” she added with a chuckle. “So we stood across the street and the German waiter ran out after us and I said, ‘Chaka, I’m gonna go back and pay the bill!’ I’ve always enjoyed her company, every time we meet something spectacular happens.”\n\t\n\n\t“Thank you Joni, you can sit down now, child,” Chaka said. “I started listening to her when I was in my middle teens, and she was one of my biggest inspirations… in fact, she sent me to the dictionary several times!\n\n\t“I do love what I do,” she continued. “I do it because I have to, this is my calling, this is how I love the best, and I get to love en masse.” Holding up her award, she said, “This represents something deeply important to me. I’ve been blessed with a long life in music, and what I’ve learned is this: Longevity isn’t about staying the same, it’s about staying open, differently, every time that you can. Open to collaborations, new voices, change and the people behind the scenes, whose creativity helps everything you hear. Some of the most powerful moments happen in studios late at night, with the producers and engineers and songwriters who believed in the music before the world ever heard it.”\n\n\tShe concluded, “I’ve always believed that empowered women empower women. So thank you for this award, and keep moving the needle.”\n\n\tThe evening concluded with an all-star tribute to Khan with Sia singing “Tell Me Something Good” (with Danielle Haim expertly playing the song’s deeply complicated rhythm on drums), Maggie Rogers singing “Ain’t Nobody” and finally, “Through the Fire” by Lalah Hathaway, who was joined by Khan herself for some freestyling around the chorus.\n\n\tDespite the length of the evening, the audience slowly trickled out, and as midnight approached, nearly as many luminaries were seen lingering in the courtyard as when the evening began seven hours earlier.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tElvira Anderfjärd, Addison Rae and Luka Kloser  (Photo by Christopher Polk/Billboard via Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBillboard via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLuminary Award – Chaka Khan presented by Joni Mitchell\n\n\tThis award is presented to a creator whose profound impact has transcended the confines of the music realm to significantly change culture. A true luminary, their artistry is a beacon of inspiration not only to those within the industry but also to the world.\n\n\tHarmonizer Award – Chappell Roan Presented by Heart’s Nancy Wilson\n\n\tThis award honors a creator who uses music to leverage social change. They are a voice of our collective conscience who pushes boundaries to powerfully articulate their message and challenge issues of our time.\n\t\n\n\tGolden Trifecta Award – St. Vincent presented by Olivia Rodrigo\n\n\tThis award honors a top creator who is reinventing the rules: an innovator who breaks down traditional barriers to make magic happen on both sides of the glass. This creator is a triple threat, exerting prowess across multiple disciplines as a producer, engineer, and artist.\n\n\tDisruptors Award – Haim presented by Rostam\n\n\t This award celebrates visionary creators who are redefining what’s possible in music.

Pretti's wearing a remarkably similar outfit to the one he wore 11 days later when he was shot.\n      \n    \n        Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n      \n    \n          The clip starts with Pretti yelling and appearing to spit on the vehicle as federal officers are driving away from the area ... before he brings his foot up and kicks and shatters the rear right tail light, leaving it hanging by cords.\n      \n\n          Agents jump out of the SUV and chase Pretti down ... slamming him to the ground while a crowd gathers around them and screams at the agents.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Inexplicably, after the tense altercation ends and Pretti's able to get back to his feet, agents just let him go ... leaving him on the street corner despite the damage he's done to the vehicle.\n      \n    \n          A rep for the Pretti family tells TMZ ... they knew about the incident on January 13. The rep says Alex sustained injuries but did not get medical care.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As Pretti pulls away from the agents, you can see the butt of a handgun in the rear waistband of his pants -- just as it was during his fatal encounter with the feds.\n      \n    \n          Steve Schleicher, the attorney for the Pretti family tells TMZ ... \"A week before Alex was gunned down in the street -- despite posing no threat to anyone -- he was violently assaulted by a group of ICE agents. Nothing that happened a full week before could possibly have justified Alex’s killing at the hands of ICE on Jan 24.\"\n      \n    \n          As we've reported ... 11 days after that initial clash, feds again wrestled Pretti to the ground on a city street ... and a Border Patrol agent and a Customs and Border Protection officer fired a series of shots at Pretti. He died at the scene.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Protests have exploded all over Minnesota and the rest of the country in the days after the killing. Trump administration officials have already publicly labeled Pretti a \"domestic terrorist.\"\n      \n    \n          The Department of Homeland Security tells TMZ ...

In the essay, she says the next morning she woke up in a pool of blood.\n      \n    \n          \"It hurt to walk. It hurt to sit. It hurt to remember,\" she writes.\n      \n    \n          But later, Brooke says she actually initiated a subsequent sexual encounter, thinking it would help her take back control.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Tragically, Brooke writes, her plan completely backfired ... \"I just implicated myself in my own abuse.\"\n      \n    \n          According to Brooke, it was her \"preexisting relationship\" with Matt that made it difficult for her to frame it as abuse at first.\n      \n    \n          She writes, \"Even now, I hear 'rape' and think of masked strangers in dark alleys. Back then, I had no idea what to call what happened other than weird and humiliating.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          As you know ... Brooke's complaint led to Matt's firing from NBC. He denied the accusation, saying all their encounters were consensual. In the aftermath, several other women came out with their own allegations against Matt. His wife of 19 years, Annette Roque, later filed for divorce.\n      \n    \n          When TMZ reached out to Matt by phone for comment, he said he was at dinner and hung up.\n      \n      ",

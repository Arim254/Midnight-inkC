    "body": "\n\tElliot Grainge’s 10K Projects has been sued by Taz Taylor’s Internet Money, which claims that the company breached fiduciary and contractual obligations by withholding millions of dollars.\n\n\tThe suit, filed in Los Angeles Federal Court on Tuesday and reviewed by Variety, outlines a pattern of contract violations and misconduct regarding profit sharing, among other claims. It alleges that 10K knowingly cross-collateralized accounts and evaded paying Internet Money’s earned share of profits as part of its joint venture.\n\t\n\n\tInternet Money initially entered into the JV with 10K in Aug. 2019 to sign and develop artists with a 50/50 split of net profits. Following the contract execution, Taylor began releasing music outside of the scope of the deal that grew in popularity, leading to a 2020 negotiation for an amendment that extended the JV through June 2024.\n\n\n\tAccording to the suit, first reported by Billboard, 10K engaged in a “consistent and repeated pattern of violations and breaches of its obligations under the Agreement in numerous ways.” Per the agreement, 10K was required to get approval from Internet Money regarding all creative and business decisions, as well as any reallocations of A&R costs and marketing. Internet Money claims that 10K did not comply with the agreement, and “unilaterally incurred and charged tens of millions of dollars in deductions” without approval.\n\n\tMore specifically, Internet Money accuses 10K of “diluting” and “effectively giving away” profits from the 2020 hit “Lemonade,” a global smash that peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The suit claims that 10K gave a $500,000 advance to an unnamed artist, then renegotiated the agreement without Internet Money’s approval. It also alleges that 10K failed to execute a profit participation agreement with Taylor in respect to Iann Dior, and has impeded requests for an audit.\n\t\n\n\tGrainge, who became CEO of Atlantic Music Group in Oct. 2024, has spent years building his 10K business, which is now housed under Warner and counts Trippie Redd and Ice Spice as signees. A representative for 10K responded to Variety with no comment.\n\n\tInternet Money is seeking millions in damages on causes including breach of contract, accounting, fraudulent inducement, unjust enrichment and more.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tJames Bond has always traveled in style, but a new coffee table tome from Assouline argues the franchise’s fleet of tricked-out vehicles deserves star billing right alongside 007 himself. “James Bond Cars,”  released this week, is the publisher’s third fully authorized Bond title and its most ambitious yet: a film-by-film chronicle of every notable car featured in over six decades of the franchise — from the Sunbeam Alpine in “Dr. No” to the bullet-pocked Aston Martin DB5 that roars through “No Time to Die.”\n\n\n\tThe 340-page volume is curated and introduced by Chris Corbould, the Oscar-winning special-effects supervisor credited with designing and detonating Bond’s biggest stunts across 15 films. Corbould not only narrates how the DB5 sprouted an ejector seat or how a Lotus Esprit became an actual working submarine, but also reveals the on-set engineering hacks, one-take miracles and near-disasters that turned these vehicles into instant cinematic icons. More than 300 photos — including behind-the-scenes stills, technical drawings and rarely seen production ephemera — trace the evolution of Bond’s garage as the franchise’s unofficial co-lead.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tThe book doesn’t just spotlight 007’s personal wheels. Other characters get equal mileage across a lineup that includes Bentleys, BMWs, Land Rovers, Sunseeker speedboats, Boeing 747s, snowmobiles, blimps and the one-of-a-kind contraptions cooked up by Q Branch (“Little Nellie,” the tiny autogyro from “You Only Live Twice,” makes a return appearance). Unsurprisingly, Aston Martin remains the franchise’s most enduring marque: more than a dozen models — DB5, DBS, V8, Vanquish and more — recur throughout the book.\n\n\tAssouline is also marking the occasion with a limited-edition “007 Trilogy” slipcase pairing “James Bond Cars” with the publisher’s previous titles “James Bond Destinations” and “James Bond Style.” The set is housed in a brushed-aluminum case inspired by Q-grade gadgetry, complete with a raised 007 insignia.\n\n\n\tShop “James Bond Destinations” below, and stream the all the James Bond films here. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tMeghan Markle is returning to the screen with a small cameo role in the feature “Close Personal Friends,” Variety has confirmed. Lily Collins, Jack Quaid, Brie Larson and Henry Golding are starring in the comedy that is currently shooting around Los Angeles.\n\n\tAlso appearing in the comedy are “SNL” alum Melissa Villaseñor, as well as Natasia Demetriou, Anna Konkle, Patti Harrison, Jack Shalloo and Dustin Demri-Burns.\n\n\n\tThe story reportedly revolves around a “regular” couple that meets a celebrity couple while on a trip to Santa Barbara. When the two couples become friends, lines are crossed and things get awkward.\n\t\n\n\tJason Orley is directing from a screenplay by Isaac Aptaker, from a story on which they collaborated. Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger are producing. Orley, Aptaker and Berger previously worked together on Amazon MGM’s rom-com “I Want You Back.”\n\n\tMarkle starred in “Suits” for seven seasons and appeared in films like “Horrible Bosses” and “Remember Me” before marrying Prince Harry in 2018. She has not acted in over seven years, though her and Prince Harry’s banner Archewell Productions re-upped its first-look deal at Netflix back in August. Through the partnership, Markle has executive produced doc series like “Polo” and “Live to Lead,” plus Markle’s own lifestyle series “With Love, Meghan,” which bowed it second season over the summer.\n\n\t“It’s a new chapter, right?” Markle, 36, told Page Six when she gave up her gig on the USA network’s “Suits” to focus being the Duchess of Sussex. “I’ve ticked this box, and I feel very proud of the work I’ve done there, and now it’s time to work with [Harry] as a team.”\n\t\n\n\tIn 2020, the couple announced they were stepping back from royal duties and would split their time between Santa Barbara and the U.K.\n\n\tAmazon MGM had no comment. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Momsen was the latest guest on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast and reminisced on the painstaking effort it took to quit The CW’s “Gossip Girl” during Season 4. Momsen, a child actor who had already appeared in major films such as “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” and “Spy Kids 2” before signing on to “Gossip Girl,” originated the role of Jenny Humphrey on the series. Jenny was one of the more divisive characters. Momsen wanted to quit the show in Season 4 to pursue her dreams of touring with her band, The Pretty Reckless. \n\t\n\n\t“I kind of just Irish-dipped. I just wasn’t on the script the next week,” Momsen said (via E! News). “They all knew I was making music. They all knew I had a band. I would play them stuff because I was working on the first record while I was on the show. I would come in and play songs… but I don’t think anyone knew how serious I was at that stage.”\n\n\n\t“It was an easy decision for me,” she continued. “To actually get [out of] a contract was not easy… it was a very long battle of me arguing [with] everyone and going, ‘Get me outta this. I can’t do this anymore. This is killing me. I have something else I want to do with my life, and it has nothing to do with this, and I can’t be stuck here anymore.'”\n\n\tDespite her pleas, Momsen said studio executives at Warner Bros. Television deemed her “ungrateful” for trying to get off a popular television series, adding: “You’re called all the things that come along with, ‘How dare you turn your back on something that’s been so successful for you.'”\n\n\t“I just went, ‘Fuck you. You don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re not in my shoes, so how dare you judge this?'” Momsen said. “I was very defensive, but it came down to they wouldn’t let me out of the contract. The head of Warner Bros. said, ‘Fuck Taylor Momsen. No fucking way.’”\n\t\n\n\tFortunately for Momsen, she had “Gossip Girl” showrunners Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz on her side. They agreed to write Jenny out of the show in Season 4, even though Momsen was still contracted for more time. This meant that Momsen could not act in other projects until her “Gossip Girl” contract was up, even if she was no longer being written into scripts. Luckily, Momsen had no intention of acting anyway as she pivoted full-time to her music career.\n\n\t“I really have to credit them for doing that for me because they did not have to, and they wrote me out of the show so I could go on tour and be in a band,” Momsen said, noting that she has no resentment towards “Gossip Girl” all these years later. She even reprised Jenny in the show’s 2012 series finale.\n\n\t“As a fan of television and a fan of the shows, I love when you have the full cast together again,” Momsen said. “You want to full-circle that and round it out.”\n\n\tWatch Momsen’s full interview on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tGrX Studio, the production company behind crime thrillers “Copycat Killer” and “The Victims’ Game,” is showcasing its latest project at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF). “The Ones I Killed and The Ones Who Killed Me” is a psychological crime drama with plans for a U.S.-Taiwan co-production.\n\n\tThe series, adapted from Akira Higashiyama’s novel of the same name, follows a Taiwanese psychiatrist who becomes entangled in U.S. serial killings spanning three decades. Each body serves as a brutal message, forcing him to confront a past he desperately tried to forget.\n\t\n\n\t“The inspiration comes from the novel’s capture of the fragile beauty of childhood friendship and the painful contrast that comes with adulthood,” producer Lee Wen-yi and executive producer Tseng Han-hsien tell Variety. “That became the starting point for our adaptation.”\n\n\n\tThe narrative centers on two childhood friends, Jason and Morris, who grew up in dysfunctional families and vowed to become each other’s family. “They are twin flames — light and shadow, yin and yang — illuminating each other’s tragic lives,” the producers explain. “But one incident tears them apart, and their fates are reversed.”\n\n\tWhen the pair reunite as adults, they find themselves on opposite sides of morality: Jason works as a psychiatrist assisting police, while Morris has become a serial killer challenging society’s definition of sanity. “The mystery of the crime is no longer about who the killer is, but how evil comes into being,” the producers note. “Have we, in order to survive, ever killed the kindness in another’s soul? Perhaps the real culprit is society itself.”\n\t\n\n\tThe project represents GrX Studio’s continued exploration of the crime-thriller genre. “From ‘Copycat Killer’ to ‘The Victims’ Game,’ the GrX team has continued to explore and expand the possibilities of the crime-thriller genre,” the producers say. “With ‘The Ones I Killed and The Ones Who Killed Me,’ we aim to take that vision even further — deepening our psychological and moral inquiry while pushing creative boundaries.”\n\n\tThe series will begin with a murder in Los Angeles, unfolding through the perspective of a Taiwanese psychiatrist who has lived in the U.S. for years as he reflects on his childhood in Taiwan. Filming is planned for both the U.S. and Taiwan, with the team actively seeking international co-production partners at TCCF.\n\n\tThe project’s timing is deliberate. “The world has been changing rapidly in recent years,” the producers observe. “Across many countries, anti-immigration sentiments are rising, and people have begun to engage in deeper discussions about identity and immigration policies.” They note that original author Akira Higashiyama, who was born in Taiwan and later moved to Japan, brings a unique perspective on how different cultures shape identity.\n\n\t“At its creative core, the series explores the interdependent relationship between good and evil — like yin and yang — as a way to examine belonging and otherness,” the producers say. “The title itself suggests a mirror-like connection, just as the relationship between an investigator and a suspect in a crime thriller often reflects two sides of the same coin.”\n\n\tThe script is currently 80% complete, with the writing team aiming to finalize it by year’s end. Pre-production is slated for Q3 2026, with filming scheduled to commence in Q1 2027.\n\n\tThe creative team includes executive producer Hank Tseng, known for his global perspective and keen market insight in developing culturally rich, cross-border content. Producer Lee Wen-yi brings expertise in crafting narratives that explore human complexity and social structures. The writing team comprises John Cheng, who specializes in social realism and crime genres rooted in Taiwanese culture; Chen Cheng-yu, a senior screenwriter based in the U.S. with experience in American TV structure and writers’ room dynamics; Peng Huai-de, whose versatile storytelling balances emotional depth with entertainment value; and Cheng Wen-ting, who holds a master’s degree from NTUA’s Department of Radio and Television.\n\t\n\n\tGrX Studio encompasses film and television production, talent management, IP development, and business strategy, with a presence across the Asian market. \n",

    "body": "\n\tHenry Tsai, the Golden Horse Award-winning screenwriter of “Winds of September,” is set to direct “Spent Bullets,” an adaptation of Terao Tetsuya’s acclaimed literary work, with the project selected for presentation at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF).\n\n\tThe film follows Silicon Valley engineers Wu Yi-Hsiang and Hsiao-Hua as they journey to Las Vegas to mourn their genius classmate Jie-Heng. During the highway trip, they must confront the intimacy, shame, and desire they once shared — a premise that explores the intersection of success, love, and human connection.\n\t\n\n\t“I was captivated by the plight of being a genius, and the subtle and hard-to-define erotic relationships in the stories,” Tsai said. “I was inspired to tell a story on screen that explores the correlation between success and love.”\n\n\n\tThe director emphasized the film’s emotional core: “Someone will love you for who you are, no matter if you’re successful or wealthy. You deserve that love, and you know how to give it as well as to receive it.”\n\n\tProduced by Jacqueline W. Liu through Taipei-based Each Other Films, which she co-founded with Tiffany Yu-Chia Chen, the project is eyeing a May 2026 start for principal photography in the U.S., with Taiwan shoots scheduled to follow in June. The team is actively seeking financing and co-producing partners at TCCF.\n\n\tEach Other Films’ recent slate includes the family drama “Little Big Women” (2020), comedy series “The Accidental Influencer” (2024), and romantic comedy “Penguin Girl” (2024).\n\n\tTsai has built a strong festival pedigree with his short films. “Love After Time” earned nominations at both the Golden Horse Awards and Sitges Film Festival, while “Live Stream from Yuki <3” was selected for Sundance, Sitges, and Munich Film Festival. His short “My Grandma” also received a Golden Horse nomination.\n\t\n\n\tThe source material comes from Terao Tetsuya, a Taiwanese former Google software engineer operating under a pseudonym who spent eight years at the tech giant before turning to writing. His works “Spent Bullets” and “Overfitting” have won several literature awards. “Spent Bullets” has already been translated into English and Korean. \n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile occasionally languorous, the 2026 Czech Oscar entry “I’m Not Everything I Want to Be” is one of the rare documentaries about an artist that goes above and beyond to embody its subject’s creative spirit, often to a fault. Whereas chronicles of its ilk tend to simply perceive their subjects’ work at a distance, Klára Tasovská’s feature, about queer Czech photographer Libuše Jarcovjáková, conscripts her as a co-author by having her read from her journals throughout the 1970s and ‘80s. It also uses her photographs, not just as a source, but as a primary medium. The film is composed entirely of her decades-old snapshots, and credits her as cinematographer.  \n\t\n\n\tThe resultant photoroman (à la Chris Marker’s “La Jetée”) mimics movement through successive shots, and through the placement of each image on screen, while employing subtle foleys to create a soundscape of time and place. As Jarcovjáková travels from the former Czechoslovakia to Japan and West Berlin, navigating rejection and the lives of various lovers, the murmurs of voices, quiet footsteps and hums of crowded rooms accompany her striking black-and-white photography. Some images even expand and unfold, their hidden halves fading-in to reveal new layers and dimensions to the places and people she captured decades prior.\n\n\n\tWhile the movie’s English language title speaks to a constant state of confusion and contrition, its original name, “Ještě nejsem, kým chci být,” translates to the intriguing “I’m Not Yet Who I Want to Be” — note the “yet” — hinting at the film being a diary of not just self-image, but of personal and artistic process. Jarcovjáková, who has been dubbed the Nan Goldin of Czechoslovakia, captures stark and intimate images, revealing people through overexposed skin just as much as hiding them in shadow. Tasovská’s documentary is similar in this regard; it lines up just enough photographs and recollections to grant us access and insight, but not so much that we’re satiated all at once.\n\t\n\n\tJarcovjáková makes for a fascinating subject, especially as someone capturing her own emotional dissatisfaction through the contours of her body and face. However, owing to the nature of her photographs — slivers of time cemented in place, and never intended for motion — there’s only so long “I’m Not Everything I Want to Be” can go without feeling outstretched. While each of the images, individually, features the suggestion of motion (in some cases, ethereal strokes of light exposed at length), Jarcovjáková’s collection as a whole isn’t a narrative in nature, at least not in the way we might think of narratives in cinema. \n\n\tA gallery of Jarcovjáková’s work might gesture towards her larger story, meant to be pondered over at a leisurely pace. But Tasovská’s film charges forward breathlessly at breakneck speed. This isn’t a cardinal sin, but the approach presents a challenge for the movie to overcome, which it only manages to in moments of denouement. Its connective tissue, however, might lose the viewer along the way, as it coheres only into a distant political analysis of the world around its subject, seldom offering us enough time to get fully absorbed in the meaning of her imagery.\n\n\tState homophobia is a key concern in Jarcovjáková’s work, and she finds comfort through observation, highlighting life in all its hues, albeit behind closed doors. Tasovská mirrors this creative instinct in energetic ways, between using strobing effects to match the intoxicating chaos of Prague’s queer nightlife (accompanied by a modern, techno-infused tracks by DJ GÄP) and by introducing color in fleeting moments of liberation. Beyond a point, Jarcovjáková considers herself a perpetual outsider, more comfortable at the margins — whether as an outcast in her own country (and among its Romani populace), or as a guest in someone else’s.\n\n\tThe movie builds admirably to these moments, where the euphoria of fragile belonging is front and center. However, in the interim, one might become impatient for Tasovská to turn the next corner of Jarcovjáková’s story, leaving little room to ruminate, as a good photography exhibition would. The handshake of different artistic forms that the film attempts is commendable in spirit, and it often yields remarkable results, even if the whole is seldom satisfying.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Therapuss” podcaster and comedian Jake Shane has signed on to executive produce and star in a Hulu half-hour comedy based on his life. The series, in development from 20th TV, stars Shane — playing a version of himself — and “his best friends as they navigate the chaotic new world of online fame, the strain it puts on their friendships, and the tension their presence causes in their suburban neighborhood.”\n\n\t“Hacks” writer and “High Potential” consulting producer Genevieve Aniello is set to executive produce and write the untitled Jake Shane pilot, while Paul Briganti (“Saturday Night Live”) will direct and executive produce. The pilot is based on an original story by Shane, Aniello and Briganti.\n\t\n\n\tAlso attached to executive produce is Alec Berg (“Barry,” “Silicon Valley”) and his producing partner, Amy Solomon, via their overall deal with 20th.\n\n\n\tShane launched “Therapuss with Jake Shane” in January 2024, and the podcast quickly became one of the top shows on Spotify and among Apple Podcasts’ 20th anniversary list. Most recently, Shane landed the 2025 Webby Award for best comedy creator and was named among Forbes’ 2025 top creators.\n\n\tThe show, now in its second season, has recently included guests such as Tate McRae, Renee Rapp, Glen Powell, Charli XCX, Ben Platt, Ed Sheeran, Joe Jonas, Saweetie, Rosé, FKA Twigs, Katy Perry, Coco Jones, Lisa Rinna, Lea Michele, Lorde and Addison Rae, among others.\n\n\t“Therapuss” has also led to this year’s North American tour “Live With Jake Shane,” hitting 36 cities — including a Radio City Music Hall stop featuring Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers of the “Las Culturistas” podcast. Shane has also welcomed guests such as The Chainsmokers and Alix Earle at other stops. (Shane also toured in 2024 with “Therapuss Live,” hitting 21 cities.)\n\t\n\n\tAfter his tour last year, Shane released the 2024 debut comedy album “Puss & Poems,” featuring 13 tracks that he wrote and produced with his pal, record producer Alexander 23. Featuring guests Tate McRae, Jack Schlossberg, Snooki and Joe Jonas, the album hit the top 5 on Billboard’s comedy chart.\n\n\tMost recently, Shane guest starred this past season on “Hacks” in a recurring role as a social media manager.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGriffin Lipson, Sela Shiloni, Robert Trachtenberg, Alexandra Ford\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, Aniello’s credits include serving as a writer on “Hacks” (which has earned her three WGA awards), consulting producer on “High Potential” and writer/supervising producer on HBO’s upcoming Steve Carell series from Bill Lawrence. She also was a staff writer on “The Other Two” and is working on an hour-long series for Disney+ with Drew Goddard and on a workplace comedy for Fifth Season.\n\n\tBriganti’s credits include a long-time gig as segment director for “SNL,” working on various shorts. He also directed and exec produced the feature “Please Don’t Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain.”\n\n\tBerg and Solomon produced “Barry” (which Berg co-created with star Bill Hader) and “Silicon Valley,” which Berg was showrunner. Berg also served as a writer/director/EP on “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and as writer/EP on “Seinfeld.”\n\n\tShane is repped by UTA, Homemade Projects and Brecheen Feldman Breimer Silver Thompson; Aniello by CAA, Mosaic and Ziffren Brittenham; Briganti by Mosaic, WME and Ginsburg & Kallis; and Berg by UTA and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren, Richman, Rush, Kaller, Gellman, Meigs & Fox.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaipei-Los Angeles-based production house Organic Media Group has set a Chinese-language remake of hit French comedy series “Call My Agent!,” the company revealed at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF).\n\n\tThe remake will center on a top Asian talent agency, where a team of savvy and stressed-out agents juggle superstar clients, personal chaos, and industry politics. The original series has spawned international adaptations in some 12 countries.\n\t\n\n\tOMG is targeting the global Chinese-speaking diaspora while rooting the production in Taiwan’s entertainment ecosystem. Despite a local Taiwanese series that covered similar territory, OMG co-founder and CEO Steve Chicorel sees opportunity rather than obstacle.\n\n\n\t“Yes, our version will be a remake of the hit series, yet we’re adding organic nuances — making it local for Taiwanese, yet international, inviting superstars from Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Asian-Americans, and yes, even China to join the cast — for worldwide distribution, not just Taiwan,” Chicorel said.\n\n\tAward-winning French producer Natacha Devillers, whose credits include “Moon the Panda” for Gaumont and Disney, has been attached for several years developing the adaptation in collaboration with Taiwanese director Wu Zhongtian and writer Yang Jingxiang. The production is currently seeking financing and is prepared to move into pre-production pending co-financing commitments.\n\n\tOMG also unveiled three other series in development, all to be shot in Taiwan. “Detective Daji” is a supernatural detective series featuring Taiwanese actress Puff Kuo about a murdered detective resurrected by an ancient Fox Demon. It won best series pitch from Mediacorp at the Asian Television Forum last year.\n\t\n\n\t“Undertaker” follows a down-on-his-luck misfit who finds meaning working at a Taiwanese funeral home. The series is near completion and produced by Sarso Chou, who previously won best miniseries or television film at the Golden Bell Awards for “On Children.”\n\n\t“Expats: Taiwan — A Day in the Life” is an unscripted series built for both Western and Asian audiences exploring why expatriates love Taiwan and their contributions beyond teaching English. Future seasons will shift to Thailand, Japan, and Korea.\n\n\tOMG has arranged U.S. distribution for all four projects with Golden TV, a new all-Asian channel serving 20 million cable homes through its 24/7 cable network ChimeTV via Charter Spectrum, as well as streaming and FAST channels.\n\n\tCo-founded by “Bling Empire” star Kelly Mi Li and Chicorel in 2019, Organic Media Group specializes in cross-market IP, talent, and distribution strategies connecting Asian and U.S. platforms, with offices in Taipei and Los Angeles.\n",

He reportedly played video games and watched porn inside, according to the Arizona Daily Star.\n      \n\n          The temperature that day, July 9, reached 109 degrees, and the little girl had been left in the car for about 3 hours, according to the Pima County Attorney's Office. Paramedics responded and took the child to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead ... her body temperature had reportedly reached 108.9 degrees.\n      \n    \n          Scholtes pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and child abuse two weeks ago in a plea deal that would have him serve no more than 30 years for both counts. He was set to surrender to authorities today ahead of his sentencing on November 21.\n      \n    \n          Another of his daughters, who will turn 18 this month, sued him for emotional distress last month, according to Tucson's KVOA-TV.\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

    "body": "\n\n\tPioneering female rap group Salt-N-Pepa, who are in the middle of a dispute over ownership of their masters, used their induction speeches at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony on Saturday to call out “the industry” for a situation that has seen their music removed from major streaming platforms.\n\t\n\n\tAs Cheryl “Salt” James, Sandra “Pepa” Denton and Deidra Roper (DJ Spinderella) accepted the Musical Influence award, James said, “As we celebrate this moment, fans can’t even stream our music. It’s been taken down from all streaming platforms because the industry still doesn’t want to play fair.\n\n\n\t“Salt-N-Pepa have never been afraid of a fight,” she continued. “This is the Influence Award. We have to keep using our influence until the industry honors creativity the way the audience does — with love, respect and fairness — and that includes streaming platforms too.”\n\n\n\tSalt-N-Pepa filed a federal lawsuit against Universal Music Group — which owns their masters — in May, accusing the label of violating the Copyright Act for not allowing them to reclaim control of their music, despite a law allowing some musicians to do so after 35 years.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the lawsuit, the pair filed notices of termination in 2022 to reclaim the rights to those songs, which were released by its subsidiaries Next Plateau London Records. However, UMG followed with a filing that claimed the group could not exercise those “termination rights” because they didn’t sign the contract themselves. A UMG spokesperson said that the company had made “repeated attempts” to “resolve this matter amicably,” adding “Clearly, the artists’ legal counsel thinks they can use the threat of negative media coverage from the lawsuit to achieve their unreasonable demands. Despite this, and consistent with our longstanding practice, we remain committed to working towards an amicable resolution.”\n\n\tHowever, the induction was mostly celebratory, reflecting on the group’s influences, influencees — including Miessy Elliott, who inducted the group and herself was the first female rapper to be inducted into the Hall of Fame two years ago — and families. “This is for every woman who picked up a mic when they told her she couldn’t,” James said. DJ Spinderella made note of the overdue nature of her induction, saying, “I’ve been DJ-ing for 40 years, and I’m the first female DJ in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.”\n\n\tThe group also performed a medley of their hits, “My Mic Sounds Nice,” “Shoop” and “Let’s Talk About Sex,” before being joined by En Vogue for their 1993 hit together, “Whatta Man.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen the Disney nets were first pulled from YouTube TV, the internet company said that if ESPN, ABC local stations and Disney’s other channels were unavailable for “an extended period of time,” it would offer subscribers a $20 credit — and now those credits are about to arrive.\n\n\tIn a bid to appease disgruntled customers, YouTube will begin issuing eligible YouTube TV customers a $20 credit starting on Sunday, Nov. 9, if there is still no deal with Disney to restore the channels. YouTube will send YouTube TV subscribers an email with instructions on how to apply the one-time $20 credit to their next billing statement. All credits will be issued by Wednesday, Nov. 12. \n\t\n\n\tYouTube TV subscribers have been unable to watch ESPN, ABC local stations and other Disney networks, since they were removed from the lineup shortly before midnight ET on Oct. 30. \n\n\n\tIf Disney agrees to a deal, channels will be restored “in a matter of hours,” according to YouTube, well ahead of the NFL “Monday Night Football” Eagles-Packers game on Nov. 10, set to air on both ABC and ESPN.\n\n\t“We know that subscribers are frustrated with the disruption and we continue to urge Disney to work with us constructively to reach a fair agreement that restores their networks to YouTube TV as soon as possible,” YouTube said on Saturday. Regarding the negotiations, YouTube said, “Instead of negotiating in good faith with us to reach a deal, Disney continues to resort to their playbook.”\n\n\tYouTube TV, which is available only in the U.S., costs $82.99 per month for the base subscription plan.\n\t\n\n\tThe disagreement centers on price: Google claims Disney has demanded an unprecedented fee increase  while Disney says the tech giant has been “refusing to pay fair rates for our channels.”\n\n\tSEE ALSO: YouTube TV Subscribers Increasingly Irate Over Disney Blackout: 24% Say They Have Already Canceled or Plan to Soon\n\n\tOn Friday, three top Disney execs — Disney Entertainment co-chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, and ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro — sent a memo to staffers indicating that the two sides were still not close to reaching a deal renewal. “When will ESPN and ABC be back on the service? We wish we could give you that answer today, but unfortunately, we are headed into another sports-packed weekend without a deal in place,” the execs wrote.\n\n\tThe Disney brass claimed the company has “offered fair terms that are in-line with the more than 500 other distributors that have renewed their agreements since last summer, including the top distributors, who are far larger than YouTube TV.” (In October, Disney quietly reached a deal renewal with Comcast.) “Despite all this, YouTube TV continues to insist on receiving preferential terms that are below market and has made few concessions,” Walden, Bergman and Pitaro said in the memo.\n\n\tDisney execs claimed the company has offered Google “innovative, bespoke programming packages — tailored to sports fans, entertainment fans, kids and families — that would provide tremendous flexibility for YouTube TV and greater choice and value for its customers.” But YouTube says it was their side that proposed to Disney the intro of new genre-based tiers and packaging flexibility to give YouTube TV customers more choices.\n\n\tYouTube, in a statement Friday, claimed Disney “is resorting to their old tactics like leaking documents to the press, negotiating in public through their paid talent and misrepresenting the facts including from the deals they’ve offered and taking credit for our product proposals. Our team stands ready to make a fair agreement in line with their deals with other distributors and we encourage Disney to come to the table and do what’s best for our mutual customers.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlthough it has been a few years since actor-comedian Pete Davidson was last seen on “Saturday Night Live,” he recently said that if series creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels asked him to come back, he would take the opportunity. “I owe that guy my life. He jump-started everything,” Davidson told People on Nov. 8. “I’d do anything for Lorne, and he knows that.”\n\n\tOne of the youngest cast members to be part of the “SNL” ensemble, Davidson joined the show during its 40th season when he was just 20 years old. He stands alongside Eddie Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and Anthony Michael Hall as one of the few “SNL” stars who joined before their twenty-first birthdays.\n\t\n\n\tDavidson starred on the show for eight seasons between 2014 and 2022, and returned to host an episode in October of 2023. “I had a great time hosting last time, and anytime you get that call, it’s an honor and a privilege,” he said of the experience. \n\n\tDuring his tenure at SNL, Davidson co-wrote and starred in the Judd Apatow-directed dramedy, “The King of Staten Island,” and has since appeared in “Fast X,” “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” and “The Pick-Up” as well as the Peacock series “Bupkis.” He also starred in an ad campaign for Taco Bell and is currently partnering with Amazon for Alexa+.\n\n\tThe actor-comedian still holds his “SNL” origins in warm regards, though. “It’s always relevant,” he said of the show, “It’s a hot show. People look forward to it, and the cast is great.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf Tom Hanks is known as the “everyman” of movies — you know, the ordinary guys, so approachable and unpretentious that just about everybody can relate to him in one way or another — then Jim Gaffigan is the “everyman” of comedy. He focuses his humor on everyday observations about universal experiences. And although most outsiders see the divisive political climate at this time in history as putting humor on trial, Gaffigan looks at it differently.\n\t\n\n\t“I think this will go down in history — and it may be ending as we speak — but like, this is the best time that standup comedy has ever had,” he says. “When I started — versus even in the time of Lenny Bruce or George Carlin — comedy was a much more middle-class/lower middle-class occupation, meaning, there was not an expectation of an upper middle-class existence. Now, if you’re a functional comedian, you can make a great living. So, from a monetary standpoint, like having a kind of financial security, it would never exist. But it exists now.”\n\n\tThese days political humor gets comedians in hot water no matter which side of the issues they fall. But Gaffigan chooses to not go there, siting the pandemic as an example. “Take politics out of it,” he says. “There were expectations that you can address it. But, people, we’ve gone through the pandemic; we don’t want to hear too much about it. … There are comedians that will have very strong views, you know, and have a formula of bringing up this hot button issue. Their audience will stay with them. They’ll have some brilliant insights surrounding it. But I’m kind of of the opinion that, you know, people don’t wanna live in denial, but they also want a break from it.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Illinois native has accomplished a whole lot since moving to New York in 1990 to pursue a career in comedy. It all began when a friend in an acting class dared him to attend a stand-up seminar that required the students to do a live comedy set at the end of the course. He loved it, but it began a cycle of attempting to determine — and nailing down — his style. The guy now known as the “clean comic” with the laid-back delivery tried everything from impressions to “angry comedy.” Seven years later, he found his voice, and his comedy has been evolving ever since.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGaffigan performs onstage during the 2025 Night of Too Many Stars benefiting Next for Autism.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSome might call the quiet confidence he projects on stage courageous, but Gaffigan sees it differently. “I think it’s just mental illness, honestly,” he jokes. But on a more serious note, he compares the mental psyching up a comedian must do on stage to what parents face every day. “I see this as a parent, that we develop these kind of metaphorical calluses or scabs that make us much more resistant.”\n\n\tParenting five children, ages 13-21, has been the inspiration for much of his act and a catalyst for the evolution of his humor, because, as he says, if you have that many kids, you have to have a sense of humor. “I’ve said this for years — if your kids aren’t annoying you or you aren’t frustrated by the task of parenting, that means you’re not participating in the task of parenting,” he says. “I think the love I have for my children and the absolute fear that I’m failing colossally is shared by every parent. So the impact of parenting is so enormous on my stand-up.”\n\n\tParenting teenagers in this day and age of social media has not been easy, one that Gaffigan calls “a disaster” and “impossible” — but it certainly has resulted in both his personal growth and his growth as a comedian. “The fact that I have this approach of the ‘drowning continues’ is something that is a nice reprieve for parents. Do you know what I mean? Where they’re not alone. The struggles of being a parent and the struggles of your child are so understandably private. I have this joke right now where I talk about parents of teenagers always sound like they’re hiding something, and it really resonates.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s that experience of parenting that has evolved. So people that enjoy my standup, they might be at a different point in their parental journey, but they can identify with what I’m talking about.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGaffigan with his wife Jeannie, left, and their children attending a ‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them’ world premiere in 2016. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaul Bruinooge/Patrick McMullan\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCaroline Hirsch, founder and former owner of the New York comedy club Carolines on Broadway, is known for an innate knack for identifying the next big thing in comedy… and Gaffigan was one of those comedians. “I first met Jim when he was performing and honing his craft very early in his career at my club [Carolines on Broadway] on Broadway,” she recalls. “Even then, he had such a distinct voice, literally and comedically. There was this sharp observational humor and a quiet confidence about him that stood out. He could make the everyday and the mundane feel hilarious and relatable without ever being mean-spirited.”\n\n\tHirsch also reflected on his professional evolution. “It’s been incredible to watch Jim’s growth over the years,” she adds. “His material has deepened. He’s still just as funny, but there’s a warmth and perspective that have come with his experiences as a father, husband and seasoned performer. Jim has managed to stay true to his comedic voice while continuing to evolve creatively, which is why he remains one of the most respected and beloved comedians in the industry today.”\n\n\tRespected, indeed. Gaffigan is a seven-time Grammy nominated comedian, actor, writer, producer, two-time New York Times best-selling author, three-time Emmy winning top touring performer, and multi-platinum-selling recording artist. Yet, he still has an air about him that is humble, sincere and, as Hirsch put it, warm.\n\n\t“I feel like if I’m humble and sincere, it’s out of necessity, you know what I mean?” he jokes, proving the point. “Like, I think, if something could go wrong or will get complicated, it will happen to me. It’s kind of an ongoing joke with my manager. But that being said, I’m also grateful and appreciative of the things I’ve gotten to do.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers for all eight episodes of “All Her Fault,” now streaming on Peacock.\n\n\tIn the final moments of Peacock’s twisty limited series “All Her Fault,” Peter Irvine died as he lived: misguidedly believing he was still the hero of his family.\n\n\tAcross eight episodes — the series from creator Megan Gallagher, based on the 2021 novel by Andrea Mara — slowly but intentionally contradicted its own title by absolving the women at its center for the perceived failings of their families, which they often bear no matter who is actually at fault. Marissa (Sarah Snook) is accused of negligent parenting when her son Milo is kidnapped during a playdate she’d casually scheduled over text. Jenny (Dakota Fanning) is charged with letting her job cloud her judgment by failing to properly screen Carrie (Sophia Lillis), the nanny who used her family to get close to Milo. Carrie, meanwhile, is villainized for her admittedly deluded quest to reunite with her biological son in a world that has dismissed them. But in the end, their stories were deeper than the aspersions cast upon them. Instead, the blame for the botched kidnapping plot, the shocking revelation of a long-held family secret and a soapy baby swap all landed on the shoulders of Marissa’s husband Peter (Jake Lacy), who was the lynchpin in it all.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBy the season’s end, in fact, more than a few travesties are laid at Peter’s feet. First, it’s revealed that the whole kidnapping was rooted in a car crash five years earlier on the night he and Marissa brought their newborn son home. Peter was driving when their car collided with the one carrying Carrie and her own newborn. The Irvines’ son died in the crash, and Peter used the cover of the most inexplicably desolate street in Chicago to switch his body for Carrie’s healthy son while the two women lay unconscious. Years later, Carrie figured out what had happened and kidnapped Milo in the hopes that forcing Peter and Marissa to reveal the truth might get her son back. But through a series of (further) unfortunate events, Carrie’s plan unraveled thanks to her own unpredictable father, whom Peter killed during a failed ransom drop and then staged the miraculous return of Milo. This all happens while Peter has been at home playing the role of concerned but aloof husband. Further complicating matters are the tidal wave of family secrets exposed by the strain Milo’s disappearance put on Peter and his siblings, Brian (Daniel Monks) and Lia (Abby Elliott). Just as Peter is trying desperately to conceal his shared history with Carrie, Brian and Lia come to realize that the original sin of their family –– the time when Brian was injured and permanently disabled as a child –– was not actually Lia’s fault, as Peter had always led them believe. Rather, he was the one who accidentally hurt his brother, setting up a lifelong lie that led to Lia’s drug addiction, Brian’s struggle to live independently — and Peter’s demonstratively needy and controlling behavior, which has turned murderous.\n\t\n\n\tWhen the gunsmoke finally clears, Peter had killed Carrie in front of Marissa to silence her; their family friend Colin (Jay Ellis), who was secretly sleeping with Lia, has also been shot and killed (by Carrie) in the struggle; and Peter is left to continue (unsuccessfully) gaslighting his family into thinking he is the good guy for spilling blood in the name of protecting them. It is a massive amount of guilt to lay on one character, but Gallagher liked muddying up a man with needy emotional baggage for once.\n\n\t“I see it so often with scary or bad female characters that are scary or bad because they, as women, are obsessed with relationships or need love in some way,” Gallagher tells Variety. “We don’t see male characters, who are our bad guys, operating from a place of needing love. So I was enormously excited to develop a male character who is the root cause of our problems in this series, and all of his decisions and poor decisions at that come from needing to be loved and needing people to need him. He just can’t function without that.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFor his part, Lacy found the fatty layers of lies that Peter has added over time to be a fascinating character study in not only narcissism, but also the struggle of a compulsive liar trying to keep the charade of his life going after one self-induced tragedy after another.\n\n\t“He fully believes in his own existential innocence in each of these situations, and that lack of willingness to accept responsibility or accountability is really the most damning thing in the end,” Lacy says. “He can’t see or hear another person’s perspective outside of his own. I think it is what drives Marissa to kill him. There is no path forward with this person in their lives, and his reality and her reality are getting further and further apart from one another.”\n\n\tMarissa does, in fact, kill her husband in the final episode, not because she is just as cruel as he is but because she has no other choice. She knows telling the truth about why Carrie kidnapped Milo might get him taken away. But by not turning Peter in, she also becomes somewhat complicit in his opportunistic murder of poor Carrie, which he can dangle over Marissa should she try to leave him. With no other options, Marissa uses Peter’s vulnerabilities against him as he did so many others, specifically his soy allergy. With just a touch of it on her lips from the hors d’oeuvres at Colin’s funeral, she induces an allergic reaction and, wouldn’t you know, she happens only to have an expired EpiPen. In Mara’s book, Peter’s death is revealed in a newspaper-clipping coda at the end of the story. But Gallagher couldn’t bear robbing the audience — and Marissa — of the satisfaction of his downfall.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It’s too big of a moment to be off screen,” she says. “Marissa is the heart and soul of the series, and it’s such a great way to end a book, with the newspaper clipping, which I absolutely love. But in a series, we want to see it, and we want to be with her during the decision making. We know what’s going to happen, really before it happens, we just don’t know how. That’s the fun of it. You love this character so much after eight episodes, and you know she’s not an irrational person, or an evil or bad person. But she’s still gonna do this thing, because her back is truly up against the wall. What is Option B? There isn’t one, really. So it’s about wanting to be with her, this relatable woman, doing this thing that feels bananas to us, but we think we might also do in her position. I couldn’t bear to have it off screen.”\n\n\tRight to the end, Peter fights not only the soy that is tightening his throat with each passing second, but also the loss of control that he so desperately clung to since he was a child cleaning up his horrible mistakes. Even up to the moment he has to untie his tie and face the reality of the situation, Lacy notes that Peter is still playing the diplomatic husband role, telling Marissa it’s OK she might have touched soy or forgotten his epipen. It’s only in her quiet, unspoken glare directed at him as he suffocates that he realizes the trap he’s fallen into.\n\n\t“Peter knows it’s the end of the road,” Lacy says. “I mean, obviously, he’s dying. But to the last breath, I think he is sure that he will find a way back. That the medics will show up and they’ll put the paddles on and then he’ll be back. I don’t think that ego, or that belief in his own infallibility, ceases in the end or that he succumbs to any of it. He fights right to the end, and there is a fury in him at the person, who he believes he’s done all of this for, who is now killing him.”\n\n\tThose who read Mara’s book prior to watching the series might feel like Lacy’s Peter is even more unforgivably cruel, in part because of the additions Gallagher and her writers made to the story. The biggest change is the deepening of the Irvine siblings’ story, specifically with the inclusion of Brian’s disability. From a character perspective, Brian’s need for support puts him in a place where he doesn’t feel like he can reject Peter’s constant, selfish supervision. Peter has trapped his sibling in a vicious cycle of need, one meant to foster some form of absolution for his secrets.\n\t\n\n\t“Peter’s goal is to keep Brian on his feet,” Lacy says. “Whether that’s an experimental surgery or pain meds or whatever it takes to keep him up and mobile, that’s Peter’s goal because that represents a kind of quote-unquote normalcy that somehow undoes the damage he’s done to his brother.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sarah Enticknap/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrom a storytelling standpoint, Gallagher saw the necessary expansion of Mara’s book as a unique and personal opportunity to represent the spectrum of disabilities. In addition to Brian’s story, Michael Peña’s Detective Alcaras is working to place his son, who has severe learning disabilities, into a specialized school.\n\n\t“I had the space to develop the Irvine siblings a lot more, so putting that storyline there really tells us a lot about Peter and who he is and what he’s capable of,” Gallagher says. “But the deeper, emotional thing behind it all, especially when it comes to Michael Peña’s storyline, is that I have a disabled child. It just seemed like this was the kind of story that allowed me to put two different kinds of disability on the screen. One being cognitive, which his son is grappling with, and, as a parent, dealing with how to navigate work and how to protect a child that is going to have needs for the rest of his life. And there’s the disability of Brian, and just being to be really truthful about all of that in some meaningful way, and try to capture it correctly. In other words, it came from my heart.”\n\n\tBeyond representation, the deeply rendered stories of living with a disability provide just one more means of indicting Peter’s character in the end. It’s a different kind of villainy not only to blame his family for his actions, but then to use the prison of that guilt and shame to reap love from them at his discretion. It’s all Peter knows, and that’s why he’s so desperate to hold onto it when Carrie finally confronts the family in the house in Episode 8. For Lacy, Carrie’s death (which unfolds “off screen” in the book) is the moment that sealed Peter’s fate.\n\n\n\t“That scene — and maintaining the reality of the Peter that we’ve built to that point — hinges on grabbing this gun and saying, ‘Let go!, as though Carrie is holding this weapon,” Lacy says. “Even though she’s saying, ‘Take it, take it, take it!’ She is trying to get her hands free of it. But instead, we see him both overpowering her and then simultaneously building the narrative of self-defense as he moves in to kill her. It all hinges on that, because then you move right into some severe gaslighting, or an attempt at gaslighting, in which he’s telling Marissa that the thing you saw is not the thing you saw. \n\n\t“That’s not a sane person. There’s no living with that person.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMike Smith, who starred as Bubbles on the cult classic comedy series “Trailer Park Boys,” has been charged with sexual assault, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n\tAccording to documents filed in Nova Scotia provincial court obtained by the outlet, Smith was charged on Oct. 2 in connection with an alleged assault that took place in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, on Dec. 30, 2017.\n\n\n\tSmith’s rep and lawyer did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.\n\t\n\n\tProduction banner Trailer Park Boys Inc. told CBC in a statement that it was “aware of the allegation concerning Mike Smith,” and confirmed he has “stepped away” from his post as the company’s managing director.\n\n\t“We recognize how difficult an allegation of this nature is for all involved,” read the statement. “Out of respect for the legal process, we will not comment further on the case.”\n\n\tSmith made up one-third of the leading trio behind “Trailer Park Boys,” alongside John Paul Tremblay and Robb Wells. The mockumentary comedy first debuted in 2001 on the Canadian TV network Showcase, and was picked up by Netflix in 2014. “Trailer Park Boys” has run for 116 episodes and spawned a number of films and spin-off series. The show follows three trouble-making trailer park residents, Julian (Tremblay), Bubbles (Smith) and Ricky (Wells), who are inexplicably the subject of a documentary about their lives.\n\n\t“Trailer Park Boys” Season 13 recently wrapped production in August. Set to stream on their recently launched TPB+ streaming service, the 13th season is expected to debut in April 2026, coinciding with the show’s 25th anniversary.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWe’re now in the thick of the fall movie season, but you wouldn’t know it from how skimpy the box office is, or how muted the chatter. Simply put: Where have all the indie hits gone?\n\n\tNot so long ago, the slate of buzzy, critically acclaimed prestige movies that opened during the fall added up to something like the indie version of blockbuster season. There’s a reason the movie calendar was arranged that way. Critically acclaimed films tended to open in the last part of the year because that’s when they did well. And the trend crystallized in the ’90s, when Harvey Weinstein transformed the old awards season into the awards-industrial complex (welcome to your life, actors and directors who now have to spend five months on the road-to-the-Oscars campaign trail).\n\t\n\n\tBut the days when a buzzy fall movie could be a box-office bonanza are starting to look like a weirdly distant memory. The flameout has been creeping up for a while, ever since the pandemic produced its unhappy paradigm shift in moviegoing (i.e., more and more folks don’t like going). You could see it in the disconnect between praise and popularity that greeted such films as “Tár,” “Anatomy of a Fall,” and, last year, “Anora” — which crawled its way to $20 million, though that was a sobering reminder that in the indie-film world, $20 million is the new $50 million.\n\n\n\tThis fall, however, it has seriously begun to look like the bottom is falling out. One high-profile, high-prestige film after another has opened to a deafening thud at the box office, and the failures are so varied that each movie tends to come with its own elaborately tailored excuse.\n\t\n\n\t“After the Hunt“? People didn’t want to see an anti-“woke” academic thriller starring Julia Roberts as a pill of a professor. “The Smashing Machine“? People didn’t want to see Dwayne Johnson in a serious role, looking like the Hulk’s damaged cousin, in a movie that felt like a staged documentary. “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere”? People didn’t want to see an “art-house” music biopic about the making of the Boss’s most austere record. And “Christy,” which is opening to the usual so-so grosses this weekend? People were more interested in scrutinizing Sydney Sweeney’s jeans commercial than they are in seeing her acclaimed performance in a gritty empowering boxing biopic.\n\n\tAnd then there’s “Bugonia,” the most exciting movie of the bunch. It will have earned $12.5 million at the end of its second wide-release weekend — in other words, it’s no “Poor Things” (the previous, highly successful collaboration between Emma Stone and director Yorgos Lanthimos), but just maybe it will wind up joining the $20-is-the-new-$50-million club.   \n\n\tWhat, exactly, is going on? Is indie film dying on the vine? I think that’s an overstatement, but before we get to the larger meaning of it all (and yes, there are signs of hope at the end of the rainbow), let’s run through the reasons this is happening.\n\n\tThe rise of streaming. Speaks for itself, at this point. People no longer need to go out to the movies because the movies are coming to them.\n\n\tThe closing of windows. If it took longer for films to move from theaters to home viewing, there would be more incentive to see them. The collapse of the window has been a Hollywood catastrophe. But can the industry collectively reverse course?\n\n\tTheaters suck. An overhyped factor, in my book. But we all know the litany of gripes (the floors are scuzzy, people are on their phones, the trailers last 35 minutes, and there’s now less of an avid populated hum to the whole experience).\n\n\tTV is the new indie film. Quality television, and even not-so-quality television, now fills the space that indie films used to.\n\n\tIt’s part of Netflix’s business plan to rob us of hits. I think “Frankenstein,” like “Nosferatu,” would have been a major hit in movie theaters. And “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery”? A no-brainer — it’s the best “Knives Out” movie yet. “A House of Dynamite”? I’m not a fan, but everyone’s talking about it. It should have been in theaters.\n\t\n\n\tDoes the film-festival “blast-off” still matter? This year’s slate of buzzy Sundance movies, when released, has been barely visible. (Sorry, “Sorry, Baby,” but the world hardly knew you existed.) From “Eleanor the Great” to “Eddington,” the 2025 Cannes films have been met with a meh response (though “Sentimental Value” may prove a different story). Same for the Venice titles. Yet the one major prestige hit of the fall, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” didn’t even play at a festival. Is there a message here?\n\n\tI think there’s a major message nestled in all of this, but it’s not about festivals, or streaming, or any of the other factors listed above. It’s about the kinds of movies that people are making. It’s a message that should echo through the indie-film world: If you build it, they will not come — unless you build it the right way.\n\n\tThere have been a small handful of daring and original movies that are hits this year, and what that adds up to is a story. A story about storytelling. Those hits are Celine Song’s “Materialists,” which had the audacity to be a romantic comedy about the real live current dating world; “One Battle After Another,” which is such an up-to-the-minute X-ray of what’s happening in America that it hits you like a thunderbolt; and, I predict, “Marty Supreme” (opening Dec. 25), Josh Safdie’s existential ping-pong thriller, starring a ferociously committed Timothée Chalamet — a movie that’s like “Uncut Gems” remade as a crowd-pleaser.\n\n\tHere’s the message of those films. In a world of faltering attention spans and blockbuster numbness, indie filmmakers need to start thinking more about the audience. Not in a cautious, lame, pandering way but in a bold and adventurous way. They need to meet what the marketplace is telling them. They need to start thinking like entertainers again.\n\n\tIt may sound like I’m making a reactionary argument, or doing one of those anti-art-film polemics. But I’m not. This is what Hollywood, at its greatest, has always stood for. This is what the New Hollywood of the ’70s stood for. This is what the ’90s indie-film revolution, incarnated by Quentin Tarantino, stood for. This is what “Materialists” and “One Battle After Another” and (mark my words) “Marty Supreme” stand for. \n\t\n\n\tThere needs to be a place for small and highly idiosyncratic movies. No question. But if indie film is going to save itself, it’s going to have to get busy remembering that movies, before they do anything else, need to lift us out of ourselves. They need to reach for danger, for beauty, for the third rail of reality, for a higher love. And they need to start doing it now.\n\n\tThe stakes are too high.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGuillermo del Toro reunited with “Crimson Peak” costume designer Kate Hawley to help bring the look of “Frankenstein” to life.\n\n\tWhen Hawley got the call, as a lover of the romantics and former art history student, the first thing she did was leap back into the pages of the book.\n\n\tBut Hawley admits, “Knowing that we were going on the journey with Guillermo meant a whole lot of wonderful things: trepidation as well as excitement.”\n\t\n\n\t“Frankenstein” stars Oscar Isaac as a brilliant but egotistical scientist who brings a Creature (Jacob Elordi) to life in an experiment as he tries to conquer death. It’s an experiment that leads to his undoing, and begs the question, who is the monster?\n\n\tMia Goth also stars as Elizabeth. Ralph Ineson is Professor Krempe and Chrstoph Watlz plays Harlander. The cast also includes Felix Kammerer, Lars Mikkelsen, David Bradley, Christian Covery and Charles Dance, who plays Victor’s father.\n\n\tThe film is set firmly during the Crimean War in the 1850s. Hawley says del Toro was “very clear that he wanted this world to be bigger and larger than normal.”\n\n\tHere, Hawley breaks down the character looks she created.\n\n\tVictor Frankenstein\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen it came to crafting his looks, del Toro had no shortage of references for Hawley. “There were a lot that we discussed. There were the more contemporary references of David Bowie, and Oscar, who mentioned Prince.”\n\n\tThe initial childhood of Victor Frankenstein lends itself more to that age of enlightenment. Hawley says, “It’s definitely a nod more to the world and time period of Mary Shelley herself.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen the film hits the 1850s, Hawley says there was a broader sweep of the period. del Toro was clear he didn’t want a historical film with “lots of black top hats. I want a modern sensibility which is very much what was happening during the war in terms of technology and the time.”\n\n\tAdditionally, Hawley looked at Lord Bryon, “He’s an artist finding his muse. He’s not a scientist in the way that we traditionally know it, this is art that he’s building. We looked at all those references with bohemian irreverence and the way he wears his clothes.”\n\n\tVictor comes from the aristocracy. When audiences first see him, he’s presenting his invention in a theater. Hawley wanted to tell a story about the thick velvet he wears, but also show that a period of time had passed.\n\n\t“The velvets are old and worn. There’s a story being told of someone who’s sort of run out of money at this point, but he still has these lovely garments left over.”\n\n\tAs he gives his presentation, he meets Harlander, and the two begin a courtship. Frankenstein enjoys the money. “His clothes become more flamboyant,” says Hawley.\n\n\tElizabeth’s Wedding Dress\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHawley knew the importance of Elizabeth’s wedding dress. She links the entire story together. In crafting the character’s arc, Hawley says it was one of the first things she created.\n\n\t“It had its own pressures,” Hawley admits, knowing there would be the history of Frankenstein’s bride, but also having to make the dress work within the confines of the Victorian world. Elizabeth’s wedding to Victor’s brother, William, comes towards the final act of the film. By this point, she has formed a bond with the Creature. To reflect that, Hawley notes, “Elizabeth’s clothes in this stage in particular start echoing the world of the Creature more than the other world.”\n\n\tThe bodice was the Swiss style of the time, with boning and a pointed bottom, while the ribbons on the arms and corsetry “suggest the skeletal components of the Creature itself.” Hawley adds, “We’re going back to the anatomical language.”\n\n\tAll of Elizabeth’s gowns are tied to botany and the natural world.\n\n\tHer blue dress was based on the form of an X-ray. “We developed (an x-ray) as a print that also suggests a bit of the Victorian damask but feels part of the world and anatomy that we use a lot within patterns, textures and motifs.”\n\t\n\n\tIt took a few months for Hawley and her team to put together because it was going to be used for a nighttime scene. “We had to do a huge amount of work within the layers to keep the saturation of blue that Guillermo wanted.” For Hawley, the dress evokes the ephemeral, ethereal nature of Elizabeth. As for the fabric, she confirms “there were at least 60 meters in the skirt.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMia Goth as Elizabeth in “Frankenstein.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKen Woroner/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tParternship with Tiffany’s\n\n\tHawley calls it her personal fairy tale. In crafting Elizabeth’s jewelry, the company invited her to go behind the doors of the Tiffany archive.\n\n\tHawley worked with the company to pull pieces from the company’s 200 year old history.\n\n\tAmong the items were the Wade Necklace, worn by Elizabeth, with over 40 carats of diamonds, and the Louis Comfort Tiffany Scarab necklace.\n\n\t“This huge, wonderful resource became available to us, and all the language of these elements started fitting our storyline.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNic Serpell-Rand\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Creature\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJacob Elordi as The Creature in “Frankenstein.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKen Woroner/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Creature goes through an evolution. When he wakes up after the lab explosion, one of the first items he retrieves is a coat from the the burial ground of a Crimean War soldier. Hawley says, “As he goes through his travels and as he experiences warmth and love, he’s a constant, evolving metamorphosis in clothing alone.”\n\n\tWhen audiences first sees him, Hawley describes him as a “naked child underneath.” And so she started from the inside out, echoing what prosthetics artist Mike Hill was doing in his sculpting. “My job was to echo it and to keep the value of the Creature coming through the clothes. So when he picks the coat up off the skeleton, the imprint of the other man is still there.” She adds, “I thought that was such a beautiful image, having the imprint or the memory of another body, given that the Creature is made up of other bodies, it was a motif.”\n\n\tWatch the video above.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter working as a lawyer trying to save Saul Goodman in Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould’s “Better Call Saul,” it’s now Rhea Seehorn’s turn to save the world in Apple TV’s “Pluribus.” \n\n\tIn the new sci-fi drama, Seehorn plays Carol Sturka, an author who must save the world from happiness after an unexplained virus is unleashed. After previously working with Gilligan on “Better Call Saul” for seven years, Seehorn was approached with the opportunity to be the lead in “Pluribus,” which originally was written for a male lead character, but was quickly changed.\n\t\n\n\t“Vince [Gilligan] is always trying to write without preaching an answer. He does not tell the audience what to think, and he trusts the intelligence of fans,” Seehorn told Variety at the “Pluribus” premiere in Los Angeles. “I feel like for me as a woman specifically playing this role, one thing that I got really interested in was that a woman’s anger is seen as a detriment and having dire consequences. But then, it’s this special quality that makes her different. That was very interesting to me as somebody that suppresses my anger, and I really loved exploring somebody that is impulsive and reactive, and then dealing with the obstacle of being told there are dire consequences.”\n\n\n\t“I created ‘Pluribus’ for Rhea Seehorn and because I wanted to work with her again,” revealed Gilligan on the red carpet. “I was very selfish. I knew that she is such a wonderful actor that people would snap her right up and put her in a movie or a TV show, and I wouldn’t get to work with her for a while.”\n\t\n\n\tDuring the production, Gilligan teamed up with previous writers, directors, cinematographers and more that previously worked on “Breaking Bad” to help create the world of “Pluribus.” “I like working with people I worked with before, and I like working with my crew behind the camera too,” Gilligan said. “I’ve worked with some of these people for almost 20 years, going back to the beginning of ‘Breaking Bad,’ and they’re just a great bunch of people. To me, it’s like working with a family that you really get along well with.”\n\n\tActress Karolina Wydra hopes that audience members will identify and relate to her character, Zosia, and Carol as they navigate a new world based in optimism. “With Carol, she’s such a strong female character that is a reluctant hero, but she’s a hero who fights for something that she truly believes in. There’s an empowerment in that. For Zosia, her kindness and her sereneness has something inside that is so stunning and beautiful.” \n\n\tThe first two episodes of “Pluribus” are available on Apple TV.\n",

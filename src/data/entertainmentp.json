    "description": "\n\tLawyers for President Donald Trump refiled a defamation lawsuit Thursday against the New York Times, with a complaint that is less than half as long",
    "body": "\n\tLawyers for President Donald Trump refiled a defamation lawsuit Thursday against the New York Times, with a complaint that is less than half as long as the previous one — after a judge spiked the president’s initial lawsuit for being “tedious and burdensome.” As before, Trump’s refiled complaint seeks an astronomical $15 billion in damages.\n\n\tThe New York Times, in a statement Thursday, reiterated its position that Trump’s lawsuit was meritless and said that “nothing has changed” with the new filing.\n\t\n\n\t“As we said when this was first filed and again after the judge’s ruling to strike it: this lawsuit has no merit,” a Times spokesperson said in a statement. “Nothing has changed today. This is merely an attempt to stifle independent reporting and generate PR attention, but the New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics.”\n\n\n\tTrump last month sued the Times, several of its reporters and Penguin Random House (publisher of the book “Lucky Loser” by two Times reporters), alleging that their reporting about the president’s finances and business career defamed him. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. A few days later, a federal judge threw out Trump’s suit, calling it “tedious and burdensome” and saying that a complaint is not “a protected platform to rage against an adversary.” In the ruling, Judge Steven D. Merryday gave Trump’s lawyers 28 days to refile the suit, ordering that the amended complaint be no more than 40 pages long and that it “accord with the rules of procedure.”\n\t\n\n\tTrump’s refiled complaint is 40 pages (available at this link), less than half the original 85-page complaint. The new filing is shorter, but the main arguments are the same.\n\n\t“As set forth below, Defendants originated and distributed these publications, and the defamatory statements about President Trump therein, with actual malice,” the revised complaint says. “The statements in question wrongly defame and disparage President Trump’s hard-earned professional reputation, which he painstakingly built for decades as a private citizen before becoming President of the United States, including as a successful businessman and as star of the most successful reality television show of all-time — The Apprentice.”\n\n\tIn his previous ruling finding Trump’s lawsuit “decidedly improper and inadmissible,” Merryday said that several statements in Trump’s initial complaint were unnecessary to make the president’s case. For example, he wrote, “in one of many, often repetitive, and laudatory (toward President Trump) but superfluous allegations, the pleader states, ‘The Apprentice’ represented the cultural magnitude of President Trump’s singular brilliance, which captured the [Z]eitgeist of our time.”\n\n\tTrump’s suit seeks compensatory damages of at least $15 billion as well as punitive damages, as well as a “retraction of the defamatory publications and statements” from the New York Times and Penguin Random House.\n\n\tSeparately, Trump this summer sued the Wall Street Journal, its parent companies Dow Jones and News Corp, Rupert Murdoch and two Journal reporters, alleging defamation over a WSJ story with details about a birthday letter Trump sent in 2003 to Jeffrey Epstein. According to the lawsuit, Trump is demanding “not less than $10 billion” on two counts of defamation, for at least $20 billion total. Last month, lawyers for the Wall Street Journal filed a motion to dismiss the suit, saying that Trump’s suit should be thrown out because the WSJ article in question “is true,” noting that in response to a congressional subpoena, “Epstein’s estate produced the Birthday Book, which contains the letter bearing the bawdy drawing and [Trump’s] signature, exactly as The Wall Street Journal reported.”\n\n\tAmong other litigation, Trump also sued ABC News and CBS News’ “60 Minutes” and reached separate $16 million settlements in each of those cases.\n",

    "description": "\n\tWhether “Ragtime” is presented in productions mammoth (as in its 1998 premiere) or modest (the 2009 revival), the musical, adapted from E.L. Doctoro",
    "body": "\n\tWhether “Ragtime” is presented in productions mammoth (as in its 1998 premiere) or modest (the 2009 revival), the musical, adapted from E.L. Doctorow’s kaleidoscopic 1975 novel, reverberates with the directness, passion and allegorical heft of an American folk epic.\n\n\tLear deBessonet opens her tenure as artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater with an expanded and exceptional version of the concert-plus production she staged at New York City Center during the weeks surrounding the presidential election last fall. It’s a savvy choice given the positive reception it received, the show’s panoramic scope and the ever-vital themes of the work.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s a thrilling experience, though on the Vivian Beaumont Theater’s vast stage this pageant of a musical feels a bit skimpy. Not that the musical needs opulent sets, but it does call for stunning stagecraft to match the awe of its aspirations. It’s achieved here only intermittently.\n\n\n\tBook writer Terrence McNally artfully adapted Doctorow’s densely packed, historical novel which, from the start, seemed destined to be a musical. (Its title alone would get the theatrical rights rolling.) But because of the multitude of characters and stories of the book, that was no easy task. (The 1981 film version was less than a commercial triumph.)\n\n\tTapping into Doctorow’s cooly elegant narration and rambunctious conceit, McNally streamlined the event-filled book into a clear, cohesive and dynamic creation for the stage.\n\n\tMusic unites the interconnecting stories in this saga and expands its passions, with a sumptuous score by composer Stephen Flaherty and lyricist Lynn Ahrens that taps into a wide range of American styles, idioms and amalgams, even as the second act turns more dissonant. Special mention, too, goes to William David B John’s lush orchestrations and the show’s gorgeous choral work.\n\t\n\n\tDirector deBessonet’s fluid staging follows three disparate groups  — a white, upper-middle-class family, an African-American couple and a newly emigrated Jewish widower and his young daughter.  They all face seismic shifts in their lives at the turn of the last century.  Dramatic shifts in America, too, as “Ragtime” takes on weighty issues of racism, immigration, class, industrialization, the rise of unions, and the changing worlds for women and popular culture.\n\n\tThat’s a heavy load to balance — on top of a slew of symbols and metaphors. But the leading actors manage to fill in the broad outlines of their archetypical characters (most with generic monikers) with finesse as they adapt, embrace, rebel or are defeated by the chaos of fast-moving times.\n\n\tFrom his suburban perch, the imperious Father (Colin Donnell) fails to hear or understand the music of change, especially the new syncopated sounds of ragtime which trips up the inevitability of the beat, creating a new tempo for the times.\n\n\tHowever, Mother (Cassie Levy, splendid) appreciates this new music which accompanies her transformative story arc. She changes from dutiful 19th century wife and mother (singing the quaint “Goodbye, My Love”) to a 20th century woman who finally finds the power of her own agency (a resounding “Back to Before”).\n\n\tHer Younger Brother (Ben Levi Ross, funny, sad and riveting) also yearns for something more than privileged comfort and finds his purpose and inspiration in activist Emma Goldman (Shaina Taub, bringing warmth to the rabble-rousing). Mother’s Little Boy (Nick Barrington, humorously self-possessed) is a curious observer of the changes taking place around him. He’s clairvoyant, too — he foresees the trigger event for a world war— giving the work a touch of prophecy that is better integrated in the novel.\n\n\tThe second story follows the journey of Tateh (Brandon Uranowitz), the Latvian immigrant and his Little Girl (Tabitha Lawing), from New York’s tenements to factory exploitation in a mill town to his re-invention as a populist filmmaker in a nascent industry. Uranowitz’ is both tender and tough in both his struggles and in his triumph, capped with a chronicle of his character’s rise in a dazzling “Buffalo Nickel Photoplay Inc.”\n\t\n\n\tThe main propellant of these interwoven stories is the narrative of Coalhouse Walker Jr. (Joshua Henry, simply superb), a successful and charismatic musician, and Sarah (Nichelle Lewis), whom he loved, lost and is reunited with, only to have tragedy fall upon them both. Lewis delicately dials the character’s challenging emotional swings from madness, through recovery, hope and despair. But it’s Henry’s commanding presence, richly felt emotions and powerful vocals that anchors the show while making the production soar.\n\n\tThough the score is anthem-heavy and earnestness is always hovering, there are moments in the show that are transcendent. The opening number remains a stunner as choreographer Ellenore Scott finding fresh ways of delineating all the major and minor characters and introducing the tensions that will further tighten throughout the show.\n\n\tIncluded in these special moments are Coalhouse wooing Sarah out of her room with his enchanting “New Music”; their love duet, “Wheels of a Dream”; the contrasting quests of Father and Tateh in “Journey On;” Younger Brother’s passion in “The Night That Goldman Spoke at Union Square” and, with Goldman singing what the young man can’t articulate, “He Wanted to Say”; and Allison Blackwell as Sarah’s Friend, tearing through the Act One closer “Til We Reach That Day” with artful measure.\n\n\tThe show’s creators also know that lightness is needed, too, and give the audience the occasional breather — while remarkably keeping the themes in play — by tapping into the appeal of secondary characters such as escape artist Houdini (Rodd Cyrus), Evelyn Nesbitt  (Anna Grace Barlow, a delight as perhaps America’s first meaningless celeb); and a rude bunch of baseball-loving bros.\n\n\tIn productions large or small — or, here, imperfectly in-between, though still glorious — everything is the service of the show that creates with words, music and movement a grand American tapestry — tears and all.\n",

    "description": "\n\tI’m all for a documentary that celebrates its subject, but “Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost” is a movie that takes what it’s about and holds it up ",
    "body": "\n\tI’m all for a documentary that celebrates its subject, but “Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost” is a movie that takes what it’s about and holds it up to the light with such unbashed reverence that after half an hour or so, I thought it was all going to be a bit much. Actually, it turns out to be a very good film — canny and honest and unexpectedly moving. But it’s layered with a thick sugary frosting of adoration.\n\n\tThe movie is a portrait of Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, the husband-and-wife comedy team who first came to prominence on “The Ed Sullivan Show” (they made their debut appearance there in 1963) and then became a popular nightclub and TV-variety-show act in the ’60s and ’70s. Stiller and Meara were quite successful, but I wouldn’t call them superstars. I used to see them on TV when I was growing up, and it doesn’t take long for the film to capture the sweet-and-sour novelty of their stand-up sketch-comedy repartee — the way their affectionate but spiky interchanges, rooted in the stark contrast of their personalities (he was a Jewish crank who was like the missing link between Alan Arkin and Al Goldstein; she was a sunny Irish lass with a tart tongue), looked ahead to the age of “Annie Hall.”\n\t\n\n\tWe see a telling clip of Johnny Carson, sometime in the late ’60s, saying, “They’re married in real life! He’s Jewish and she’s Irish — for real,” and his eyes light up with amazement. That’s how unusual it was, at the time, to see a showbiz couple drawn from such  different wells. That said, Stiller and Meara, while they had a fresh and even trend-setting image, always came off, at least to me, as a likable but rather lightweight comedy team.\n\t\n\n\tAs the documentary captures, there was an edge of conviction to their act, because they drew it from their own lives, and their love and (at times) acrimony would spill right onto the stage. Yet Stiller and Meara were launched in the pre-counterculture era of Nichols and May and Mel Brooks’ 2,000 Year Old Man, and by the time they became a TV staple, there was something a tad corny and dated about them. In the documentary, we see their two greatest routines, a satire of computer dating that they first performed in 1966, and their “Hate” sketch, which was way ahead of its time. But once you’ve chuckled at those, there isn’t much left to discover about them as comedians.\n\n\tIt’s hardly a surprise, though, that “Stiller & Meara” treats the two of them like gods on the comedy Olympus. The film was directed by Ben Stiller, who is their son, so yes, he’s a bit close to the subject. What he’s put together has to be reckoned a definitive look at the career of Stiller and Meara. At the same time, the documentary is a tender but clear-eyed family portrait. It was shot starting after Jerry’s death, in 2020 (Anne Meara died in 2015), and much of it consists of the lean, warm, now silver-haired Ben Stiller and his curly-haired acerbic older sister, Amy, hanging out in the vast Upper West Side apartment on the corner of Riverside Drive and W. 84th St. in which the two of them grew up, and where their parents spent most of their lives together.\n\n\tThe apartment is jammed with memorabilia and bric-a-brac, because Jerry Stiller was a pack rat when it came to recording his life — he was into taping conversations, he always had a camera out (that’s how Ben first started to make films as a kid), and “Stiller & Meara” shows us a lot of this stuff: the home movies, the diaries, the personal notes, the recordings of the everyday. (It’s this that the film’s rather bland subtitle, “Nothing Is Lost,” refers to.)\n\n\tThe family comes off, relatively speaking, as quite a happy foursome. It’s clear throughout the documentary that Jerry and Anne genuinely loved each other, and that they provided a nurturing and creative environment for their children. Ben and Amy recall their parents with a richly amused understanding of the couples’ foibles (especially Jerry’s, since he practically wore them on his lapel), and while it’s nice to see a high-powered showbiz family that seems so well-adjusted, a part of us is going: Okay, fine, where’s the drama? Even when we learn that Anne relied on alcohol to cope with the stresses of their performance life (they would go to Patsy’s Italian Restaurant on W. 56th St. and she’d have her vodka), the film makes a point of not overstating the dark side of her addiction. (On a tape of Anne talking to Jerry after a night of this: “I drank too much. I drink. It’s not the end of the world!”) Anne liked her vodka but held herself together and appears, in hindsight, to have been a woman of joy and well-being.\n\t\n\n\tMidway through the movie, having absorbed all this (and sensing that there’s not going to be any dark bombshell), I thought: What is there left to tell? But that’s just when “Stiller & Meara” begins to morph from a likable entertainment-world profile into something more resonant — a nearly novelistic portrait of Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara’s life-and-art marriage. In the grand scheme of things, it was a happy one, but it was complicated. They had tons of fights and temperamental clashes. One reason they were two peas in a pod is that their backgrounds were more alike than we imagine: Jerry was born and raised in New York City, whereas Anne was a self-described “Irish princess” from Long Island. She retained a dollop of that Lawn Guyland accent, which is one reason words like “meshuggenah” rolled off her tongue. They may have been from different tribes, but they were both tribal.\n\n\tHere’s something I picked up on: As successful as Stiller and Meara were, had they been more successful — more famous, more coveted, a bigger act rather than a variety-show fixture — they would likely have gotten divorced. Celebrity and money would have been poured onto their simmering tensions like gasoline, and they would have detonated. In their act, Jerry was arguably the less gifted of the two, but he was the perfectionist (mostly because he was so insecure about his talent), and that took its toll. It drove Anne nuts, because she was actually less invested in their success.\n\n\tAnd maybe that was her way of keeping them sane. Since Stiller and Meara were stars who weren’t overly famous, they were able to keep their professional lives in a kind of compartment. And this allowed them to put family first. That they did so was rather heroic, as well as charming and touching. They would parade their kids onto talk shows (there’s a hilarious clip of Benjy and Amy on “The Mike Douglas Show” playing “Chopsticks” on violins), but it’s also fascinating to behold how when the two did on-camera interviews, they would discuss their lives, and it would suddenly get very serious, and their disagreements would rise to the surface, only to be channeled into a laugh (though not always), which became a form of therapy. Later on, we learn that they underwent plenty of couples’ therapy.\n\t\n\n\tTo complete the family meditation, Ben Stiller puts his own children, Eva (23) and Quinlan (20), on camera, as well as his wife, Christine Taylor, from whom he was separated for several years (the two reconciled during the pandemic). He talks about how much his own flaws echo those of his father, but the truth is that Ben Stiller comes off here as such a benign and accommodating person that the family-demons-through-the-generations theme doesn’t register with very much impact. It just gets filed under “Nobody’s perfect.”\n\n\tIn the ’70s, Stiller and Meara began to pursue separate careers as straight actors (that’s how Anne had begun), and they had some real success, with Jerry appearing in movies like “The Taking of Pelham One Two Three” and “Airport 1975” (which inspired young Benjy, with a home-movie camera, to make “Airport ’76”), and Anne in “Lovers and Other Strangers.” In 1975, each of them was tapped to star in a TV series (Jerry in the sitcom “Joe and Sons,” Anne in the law drama “Kate McShane”), and it was probably part of the karma of their long-term harmony that both shows failed. They were married for 62 years.\n\n\tJerry Stiller finally found a kind of mega-fame when he was cast as George Costanza’s disgruntled father on “Seinfeld” — the most perfect casting in the world, since even back in the 1970s he sounds like George Costanza’s father. In the documentary, Ben and Amy say that Jerry seemed to bring all his hidden sides, the anger and the craziness, to that role. Yet Ben describes his father as a “spiritual” man, in a way that remained hidden from the camera. Anne Meara, on the other hand, was all soul — the kind of person who was visibly generous, though when we hear her on the tapes Jerry made of their conversations, you saw that she gave as good as she got. Neither one was a doormat; neither one was a saint. Yet they remained devoted to each other, and “Stiller & Meara” shows you, quite movingly, that what the two had in common was how ardently they both believed in something bigger than themselves.\n\n\t“Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost” streams on Apple TV+ starting Oct. 24. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIf ever a play seemed tailor-made — tailor-braided? — for the Mark Taper Forum stage, at least in the 2020s, it’s “Jaja’s African Hair Braiding.” The most intimate of the three Music Center theaters in downtown L.A. is clearly upholding its mandate to do programming that represents a broader range of cultures, but at 739 seats, the Taper is hardly so small that it can afford to skip out on the mandate to entertain the traditional theater audience. How sweet it is, then, to witness how delightfully “Jaja” fills that sweet spot where cultural specificity and undeniable mainstream appeal collide. It feels good to hear the laughter of Black women during some of the earliest scenes, at references that only someone who’s been to a braiding salon is likely to get. It feels even better when the entire audience has joined in, as they quickly and loudly do, since no foreknowledge of cornrows or passion twists is really required. It’s the kind of show that nearly anyone who walks in is going to find captivating, with or without an appointment.\n\t\n\n\tPlaywright Jocelyn Bioh’s dramatic comedy opens with two of its characters, Marie (Jordan Rice), the 18-year-old daughter of the shop’s proprietor, and Miriam (Bisserat Tseggai), an only slightly older employee from Sierra Leone, bringing the gate up at their Harlem salon. Even before the shop’s other daily habitues join them to fill out the ensemble, you may immediately be thinking: Why is there not a Tony Award for best hair? Oh wait — there is, or at least was, for once, as the Broadway version of this play won a “special” Tony in 2024 for hair and wig design. Fortunately, “Jaja” has even more going for it than follicular eye candy, as seen in the several other categories in which the New York production got Tony nominations, including best play and best direction (and a win for costume design). What it had going for it in the Broadway production is fully in evidence in this stop at the Taper, which comes at the end of a national tour, also directed flawlessly by Whitney White. The whole cast is as on fire as if they were just opening that gate for the first time; they’re doing their own wonderful weave every night.\n\t\n\n\tThese two introductory characters are joined by three more braid-makers who are always a tight unit after all, despite all they have in common as immigrants. The most contentious is Bea (Claudia Logan), a Ghanaian émigré who has a big chip on her shoulder over how the yet-to-be-seen Jaja ( started this shop without her coming in as a co-owner, with their differing financial situations. Bea also has a big beef with her fellow employee Ndidi (Abigail C. Onwunali), a Nigerian immigrant whose pleasant attitude and possibly superior braiding skills have caused some customers to shift loyalties and head for her chair. Then, somewhere in the middle of the mild-mannered-to-aggressive scale, there’s the sexy Aminata (Tiffany Renee Johnson), the only one fiery enough to be friends with Bea and meet her at her level — although Bea’s stream of grievances will become obnoxious enough to eventually test even Aminata’s loyalty. As for the seemingly shy Miriam, it takes a while for her flame to become evident, but the tale she tells a customer about the circumstances of her leaving Sierra Leone suggest that she might be the toughest of all these cookies.\n\n\tAnd Marie, who is sort of the young maitre ‘d of the shop? She will never be anything other than the voice of calm and reason, as the most innately Americanized of this bunch, and someone who had to learn not to stand out, attending a private school far away from all this immigrants’ loose talk. As for Marie’s mother, the Senegalese shop owner, we have to wait almost as long for Jaja (Victoire Charles) to show up in the play named for her as we have to wait for Godot in his. But turn up she does, in the final third, in a wedding dress — did we mention she’s getting married today? — that feels like an eighth wonder of the world when you first catch sight of it. (No one need guess why the show won that costuming Tony.) When Jaja finally appears for one long scene late in this one-acter, Jaja does almost as much talking as any of them, coming off as rude but also giddily excited for her impending matrimony, which she may not be heading into for strictly romantic reasons.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Jaja’s African Hair Braiding’ at the Mark Taper Forum\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJavier Vasquez\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere’s a good reason the “Barbershop” movie turned into a whole film and television franchise in the 2000s and 2010s: A hair care setting is ideal for a workplace comedy — or comedy-drama — because of the possibilities for friends or strangers to drop in and act as audience surrogates or conversational foils. It’s surprising that a salon of this sort haven’t been much used as a milieu before now, because one thing that’s different from a dudes’ place, especially, is that when someone settles into those chairs for as intricate a process as this, they’re gonna be there pretty much all day. So Bioh doesn’t have to come up with contrived excuses to keep the supporting characters hanging around for a long spell in this day-in-the-life play.\n\t\n\n\tWell, the female supporting characters tend to be in it for the duration, anyway. Not so much the men — or the man. The male characters who pop into the shop have such short turns at bat in the action that you wonder if the production can really afford to keep on so many guys with so little to do… until it dawns on you that, ohhhh… maybe it’s the same guy. The Playbill and of course the curtain call confirm your suspicion: It’s Michael Oloyede playing all these specimens of manhood, in chameleonic fashion. (He is the one holdover here from the original Broadway production.)\n\n\tThe comedy in the show is fairly relentless, up to a point. To say that it feels like the stuff of a sitcom for a good while is not an insult; it feels like a situation comedy you’d want to watch play out every week. This is a world in which we can laugh not just with the characters’ interpersonal foils but at some of their clients’ delusions, like the woman who is sure that her golden rows are turning her into a dead ringer for Beyonce, even if it takes a hilariously herculean effort to flip that half-ton of hair from one shoulder to the other.\n\n\tBut, of course, it’s not a total surprise that Bioh has something more serious on her mind than just letting basic female bonds and rivalries play out. You can more or less guess that Bea, however rough and unfairly domineering she is, will get some redemption, or at least not go down as the villain of the piece. The real adversary, off-stage, of course, is a society that is not as welcoming of immigrants as these women assume or hope, even with the womblike enclave of Harlem as a seeming buffer. So, yes, it’s going to go darker toward the end, though not so much so that it feels like all the laughs you’ve already expended are being pulled back from you.\n\n\tInterestingly, “Jaja” is the second major production in L.A. this fall that is set as a period piece in the late 2010s. Naturally, that’s not an arbitrary choice, and in the case of the other such show, “Eureka Day” at the Playhouse, it’s because the vaccination themes would only make sense pre-COVID, not -post. In the instance of “Jaja’s African Hair Braiding,” it’s because the women’s lack of complete panic, as immigrants, would not make sense during the second Trump term. It’s set during the first, before this administration made the administration of terror a proud hallmark. It’s sad to think that any playwright who wants to do a contemporary play in which urban characters are not deeply weary or living in abject fear will forever be setting their narratives in a time a little bit before the present one, but there we have it, for now.\n\t\n\n\tThe bittersweetness that ultimately characterizes “Jaja” doesn’t mean that is isn’t still fizzy. There’s not just effervescence but serious joy in this show — an exuberance you’re maybe not meant to think can or will last forever, but this blisteringly hot day in Harlem sure makes for a cool breeze of a night at the theater, while it lasts. And that’s a lovely relief from feeling cold as ICE. I’d like to say that its appeal is so universal, it’s a show even a newly hired immigration agent could love, but all theater has some limits to its appeal. “Jaja” really doesn’t feel like it has many.\n\n\t“Jaja’s African Hair Braiding” runs through Nov. 9 at the Mark Taper Forum.

    "body": "\n\tSpanish-language act Los Bukis have announced the final pair of dates for their reunion tour, which debuted internationally in 2021. \n\n\tAfter nearly 40 sold-out stadium concerts since 2021, and becoming the first Spanish-language artists with a residency in Las Vegas, the group announces “¡Tuyos por Siempre! El Gran Cierre de un Ciclo” (“Yours Forever! The Grand Closing of a Cycle”). The special events will take place on Feb. 14 in Houston, Texas at Daikin Park, and on Feb. 20, in Inglewood, California at the SoFi Stadium. \n\t\n\n\tLos Bukis scored the biggest Latin tour of 2021, earning $49.6 million, according to Billboard Boxscore. Earlier this year, the group was also recognized with a Hollywood Walk of Fame Star for their 51 years in music. \n\n\n\tLos Bukis promise to take their fans on an emotional journey through decades of hits, performing classics such as “Quiéreme,” “Yo Te Necesito,” “Mi Najayita,” “Falso Amor,” “Ladron de Buena Suerte,” “Morenita,” and the anthemic “Tu Cárcel,” among others. \n\n\tThe concert at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles will be a homecoming for the group after they became the first Latin artists to perform at the stadium. “These two concerts are intended to be a celebration, a gesture of gratitude, and the culmination of a dream that they revived alongside the Bukimanía that has made them unforgettable,” reads a press release. “It’s the perfect moment to close this journey on a high note. Los Bukis, led by Marco Antonio Solís, have invited their fans to join these two historic nights to cherish the memory of this reunion.”\n\t\n\n\tWith the announcement of these two dates, the group confirms that the Houston and Los Angeles concerts will be the only two and final opportunities to experience the original lineup in concert.\n\n\tTickets will be available starting with a Citi presale beginning Oct. 21 at 10 a.m. ET. Additional presales, including artist presale on Oct. 22 at 10 a.m. local time, will run ahead of the general on sale beginning Oct. 24 at 10 a.m. local time at LiveNation.com.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPaul Daniel “Ace” Frehley, co-founder and lead guitarist of the legendary rock band Kiss and a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, has died following injuries suffered during a fall last month, according to a statement from his family. He was 74.\n\n\tFrehley’s family wrote in the statement: “We are completely devastated and heartbroken. In his last moments, we were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth. We cherish all of his finest memories, his laughter, and celebrate his strengths and kindness that he bestowed upon others. The magnitude of his passing is of epic proportions, and beyond comprehension. Reflecting on all of his incredible life achievements, Ace’s memory will continue to live on forever!”\n\t\n\n\tHis longtime bandmates, Kiss‘ Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, wrote in a statement: “We are devastated by the passing of Ace Frehley. He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history. He is and will always be a part of Kiss’ legacy. Our thoughts are with Jeanette, Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.” \n\n\n\tWhile Kiss, who performed in theatrical makeup and costumes, received little respect from music critics and the rock intelligentsia, their impact and influence on a generation of musicians and fans has been immense and enduring. The band’s songs were in many ways a gateway for their concerts and larger-than-life mystique: In an era that preceded MTV, their performances were almost overwhelmingly visual and experiential, with explosions, fire-breathing, smoke-spewing guitars and fireworks. Yet the mystique of Kiss was key: the bandmembers’ faces were not revealed for more than a decade, by which point Frehley and drummer Peter Criss had left the band. Frehley was known as “Space Ace” and cultivated an otherworldly image.\n\t\n\n\tFrehley joined cofounders Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons and Peter Criss late in 1972 and remained with the band for their most significant eras: He left in 1982 for a solo career, but rejoined when the original band reunited in 1996 for a highly lucrative reunion tour and remained until 2002. He worked a solo artist during the intervening years, with his band Frehley’s Comet and under his own name; in 1978, when all four members of Kiss released solo albums simultaneously, many fans felt that Frehley’s, which featured his hit cover of the song “New York Groove,” was the best.\n\n\tPaul Daniel Frehley was born to a musical family in the Bronx borough of New York City and received an electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964. He never took lessons, and never looked back: With Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Guy, Jeff Beck, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and the Who as his stated primary influences, he began playing in bands as a teenager and purportedly acquired his nickname from friends based on his ability to score dates with girls.\n\n\tHe dropped out of high school after one of his bands, Cathedral, began earning money, but later returned and got his diploma. He continued playing and by 1971 was a member of Molimo, a group that signed with RCA Records and recorded several unreleased songs for the label.\n\n\tBut late the following year, a friend spotted an advertisement in the Village Voice that turned out to be for the lead guitar slot in the embryonic Kiss. Famously, Frehley went to the audition in Manhattan wearing one red sneaker and one orange one. Stanley, Simmons and Criss were dismayed by his appearance but sufficiently impressed with his fiery lead guitar work, and he was invited to join a few weeks later. The band, which was preceded by Stanley and Simmons’ previous group Wicked Lester, dubbed themselves Kiss in January 1973 and soon, inspired by the New York Dolls and Alice Cooper, began painting their faces and donning outrageous costumes for their concerts.\n\n\tKiss weathered cynicism and disinterest from the snobby New York music scene in their early months — Frehley worked as a taxi driver to pay the bills — but, crucially, united with manager Bill Aucoin in September 1973, who began plotting the band’s path to stardom with the bandmembers.\n\t\n\n\tThe band released its self-titled debut album in February of the following year, which featured some future favorites like “Firehouse,” “Black Diamond” and Frehley’s composition “Cold Gin,” but that album and the follow-ups “Hotter Than Hell” and “Dressed to Kill,” were only minor successes.\n\n\tHowever, the 1975 live set, “Kiss Alive!,” driven by a supercharged version of the song “Rock and Roll All Night,” combined with memorable television appearances and Aucoin’s business savvy to vault the band to superstardom. Their core audience was teenaged boys, who were delighted by their parents’ mortified reactions to this loud and heavily made-up group of “freaks.” The band’s painted faces soon began appearing on jean jackets across the United States, and their iconic logo — with a pair of lightning-bolt “S”s purloined from David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust era — on untold thousands of high school notebooks.\n\n\tThe band united with Alice Cooper/Lou Reed producer Bob Ezrin for the vitally important follow-up studio album, “Destroyer,” which became their biggest release to date. Ezrin’s elaborate production (and strategic use of session musicians) powered such classics as “Detroit Rock City” and “Shout It Out Loud,” and the band followed Cooper’s example by including a sensitive (and image-defying) ballad, “Beth,” which was co-written and sung by Criss. The song quickly became the band’s biggest-ever hit single.\n\n\t“Destroyer” and the band’s increasingly elaborate concert productions (not to mention its ample and well-marketed merchandise, which grew to include everything from comic books and Halloween costumes to transistor radios and trading cards) quickly made them one of the biggest rock bands in the world.\n\n\tTwo more studio albums followed in rapid succession, “Rock and Roll Over” and “Love Gun,” the latter featuring Frehley’s first lead vocal on “Shock Me” (which was inspired by a near-electrocution during a concert in Florida). Another live album, “Alive II,” was released in the fall of 1977 and included a side of studio recordings, including Frehley’s second lead vocal, “Rocket Ride.”\n\n\tThe band’s anonymity was a big part of its allure. “Onstage I’m Ace Frehley, and offstage I’m a kid from the Bronx,” Frehley told Rolling Stone in 1977. “I consider myself lucky in a way. Mick Jagger will always be Mick Jagger, but I can take off my makeup and know who I am.”\n\t\n\n\tHowever, hubris began to set in, not least in the form of the four solo albums the band released simultaneously in September of 1978. Surprisingly — considering Stanley’s role as Kiss’ lead singer and the all-star cast Simmons assembled for his album — Frehley’s was widely considered by fans to be the best of the batch. He played a number of instruments on the album, wrote or co-wrote most of its songs, and was accompanied by some top New York session musicians — including drummer Anton Fig and bassist Will Lee, both of whom would later join the house band for David Letterman’s late-night television show — and production from Hendrix/ Led Zeppelin/ Kiss veteran Eddie Kramer. The album also featured a surprise hit single in his cover of Russ Ballard’s composition “New York Groove.”\n\n\tKiss returned in 1979 with the “Dynasty” album and the disco-influenced hit single “I Was Made for Loving You,” but the backlash had long since begun — and any embrace of disco by a rock band was regarded as sacrilege by most of the band’s fans. Criss and Frehley also had challenges with the band’s musical direction and, not least, substance abuse, which led to both of their departures, in 1980 and 1982, respectively, although Stanley and Simmons continued the band with other musicians.\n\n\tFrehley’s abuse of drugs and alcohol grew worse, and in May of 1983, he was arrested following a high-speed chase on the Bronx River Parkway in his 1981 DeLorean. He was charged with DUI, reckless driving and leaving the scene of an accident after hitting four cars during the incident (luckily with no injuries). He spent two weeks in a hospital detox unit and was required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.\n\n\tHe formed the solo outfit Frehley’s Comet and eventually signed with the heavy metal powerhouse label Megaforce Records, releasing a strong album (co-produced by Kramer) in the summer of 1987. The album included songwriting collaborations with Kiss drummer Eric Carr and “Wild Thing” writer Chip Taylor, as well as a song about his arrest called “Rock Soldiers” that included the lyric, “I cried, ‘I am invincible’ / Said I was high above the law / But my only high was just a lie / And now I’m glad I saw.”\n\n\tReleased during the commercial heyday of heavy metal, the album was certified gold and relaunched Frehley’s career, although tours with Iron Maiden and Alice Cooper ended early, reportedly over money issues; also, his sobriety did not last. The band continued for another couple of years before Frehley dropped the name and worked as a solo artist.  \n\t\n\n\tIn 1996, he and Criss rejoined Kiss for a major reunion tour, and the group recorded the studio album, “Psycho Circus,” although Frehley contributed just one song and minimal instrumental work. THe reunited Kiss continued touring in the following years, staging what was ultimately its first “Farewell Tour” in 2001 (Stanley and Simmons completed what is apparently the last Kiss farewell tour in December 2023), and Frehley left in 2002.\n\n\tHe continued solo work, touring and guest appearances over the following years, releasing five albums between 2009 and 2024, working with such admirers as Guns N’ Roses guitarist Slash, Pearl Jam’s Mike McCready and Motley Crue guitarist John 5, along with Robin Zander of Cheap Trick (who spent the entire summer of 1977 opening for Kiss) and even Stanley and Simmons. His most recent album, “10,000 Volts,” was released in 2024.\n\n\tFrehley released an autobiography, “No Regrets – A Rock ‘N’ Roll Memoir,” in 2011, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Kiss in 2014. According to Stanley and Simmons, he was invited to join Kiss for encores during the final tour but declined, although Frehley disputed those accounts.\n\n\t“I never set my sights low,” he wrote in his autobiography. “I’ve always believed most people are ruined by the limitations they put on themselves.”\n\n\tFrehley is survived by his wife Jeanette, daughter Monique, brother Charles, sister Nancy Salvner, nieces Suncere Frehley and Julie Salvner, nephews Sky Frehley and Andrew Salvner, sister-in-law Michelanne and brother-in-law Ron Salvner.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“How do you have sex onstage?” That’s the central question of “Good Sex,” an unconventional play that spotlights intimacy coordinators. Here’s the unorthodox part: The show pairs together two unacquainted actors who have never rehearsed — or read — the material before performing live for the first time. \n\n\t“Good Sex” features a new couple each night of the four-performance engagement, which runs from Nov. 5 through Nov. 8 at Brooklyn’s Powerhouse Arts. John Cameron Mitchell (“Hedwig and the Angry Inch”) and Elliot Page (“Juno,” “The Umbrella Academy”) are the first announced pair for the limited run on Nov. 6; Morgan Spector (“The Gilded Age”) and Constance Wu (“Crazy Rich Asians”) on Nov. 7; and Brandon Flynn (“13 Reasons Why”) and Chris Perfetti (“Abbott Elementary”) on Nov. 8.  A yet-to-be announced pairing will lead the Nov. 5 performance.\n\t\n\n\tThe cast of rotating actors won’t be flying totally blind on stage, however. They will be joined by an intimacy coordinator: a growing role in Hollywood that’s designed to ensure the safety and comfort of actors during sex scenes. In attempting to answer that aforementioned question — about how to have sex on stage — “each night, two brand new performers tell a story of desire, betrayal and loneliness. They are strangers. But they are not alone — to help and guide them, they are joined on stage by an intimacy director, trained in the art of teaching people how to touch. So, you can rest assured that the sex will be safe. It will be consensual. And it will be good,” according to the official press release.\n\t\n\n\t“Good Sex” hails from Irish theater company Dead Centre through a collaboration with novelist and essayist Emilie Pine. Born out of the COVID pandemic, when touching was a “transgressive act and our bodies were sites of sickness,” as a press release explains, “Good Sex” is described as a “love story for a loveless age.” It premiered in 2022 as part of Dublin Theatre Festival and was funded by the Arts Council of Ireland. \n\n\t“Good Sex” is programmed as part of Powerhouse: International, a new arts festival produced by producer and Brooklyn Academy of Music’s former artistic director David Binder.\n\n\t“Powerhouse: International aims to bring international and local artists into dialogue. The collaboration of Ireland’s Dead Centre Theatre company with some of New York’s greatest actors is sure to make for a for a remarkable, unpredictable and thrilling night of theater,” Binder said. “I am thrilled to welcome all of these artists to Brooklyn.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKevin Costner lost his bid on Thursday to throw out a lawsuit accusing him of sexual harassment for setting up an unscripted rape scene during filming of “Horizon 2.”\n\n\tDevyn LaBella sued Costner and the production in May, alleging she was forced to perform in the scene without advance warning and without an intimacy coordinator present, in violation of SAG-AFTRA rules.\n\n\tCostner’s lawyer, Marty Singer, sought to throw out the suit under California’s anti-SLAPP law, which is designed to protect free speech from frivolous litigation. Judge Jon Takasugi denied the motion, finding that the facts alleged in the lawsuit are sufficient to proceed.\n\t\n\n\tKate McFarlane, one of LaBella’s attorneys, applauded the judge’s decision.\n\n\t“The creative process cannot and does not give men in power complete impunity to abuse women like Ms. LaBella,” McFarlane said in a statement. “We were confident we would prevail against Defendants on this frivolous motion, and we did. We anticipate Defendants will continue to employ similar tactics in an attempt to prevent their despicable conduct from ever reaching the eyes and ears of a jury. We won’t back down.”\n\n\tLaBella was working as a stunt double for Ella Hunt, who played the role of Juliette in the “Horizon” films. According to her lawsuit, during filming in May 2023, LaBella was asked to stand in for Hunt after Hunt refused to participate in the scene. She alleges that an actor was directed to pin her down, straddle her and violently rake up her skirt.\n\n\tLaBella alleges that she was traumatized and humiliated by the experience. The film’s intimacy coordinator later wrote up a report documenting violations of union protocols.\n\t\n\n\tIn response, Costner has argued that the allegations are “patently false” and were designed to damage and embarrass him in order to garner a “massive and unjustified payday.”\n\n\tCostner’s attorney submitted statements from several actors and crew members who said the scene was not a “simulated rape,” and that LaBella did not appear to object at the time.\n\n\tTo prevail on an anti-SLAPP motion, the defendant must show that they were engaged in First Amendment-protected expression on a matter of public concern. Costner’s lawyers argued that the “Horizon” films deal with “the horrific struggles endured by women” in the American West, “including their extreme vulnerability to rape and other forms of violence.”\n\n\tTakasugi was “somewhat skeptical” that the scene was intended to portray that, but acknowledged that the film is an expressive work protected under the First Amendment. However, the anti-SLAPP motion failed on the second prong, which requires the defendant to show that the claim lacks minimal merit. \n\n\tThe judge found that LaBella’s claims, taken as true, are not frivolous, and thus the motion was denied. The judge did throw out one of the 10 causes of action, an alleged violation of the Bane Act, which is intended to combat hate crimes. The judge found that there was no allegation of a threat of physical violence, which would be required to establish that claim.\n",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          Sources familiar with Ace's situation tell us ... he suffered a brain bleed when he took a fall in his studio a couple weeks ago -- forcing him to cancel his upcoming tour dates -- but his health has not improved.\n      \n    \n          We're told he's been on a ventilator for some time, and hasn't gotten better -- so, his family is considering turning off support ... perhaps as soon as Thursday evening.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          While there are several social media posts indicating he's already passed ... we're told the 74-year-old guitar icon was still on the ventilator as of Thursday afternoon.\n      \n\n          Following Frehley's fall and subsequent cancelations ... a September 25 statement on his official IG page claimed, \"He is fine, but against his wishes, his doctor insists that he refrain from travel at this time.\"\n      \n    \n          A week later, a second statement was released, stating simply ... \"Due to some ongoing medical issues, Ace has made the difficult decision to cancel the remainder of his 2025 dates.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The musician was a founding member of KISS ... linking up with Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley and Peter Criss.

He rejoined the group for their 1996 reunion tour and remained with them until 2002.\n      \n    \n          Among the many hit KISS songs Ace Frehley helped make are ... \"Rock and Roll All Nite,\" \"I Was Made for Lovin’ You,\" \"Detroit Rock City.\" Frehley's solo career might best be remembered for his cover of the song \"Back in the New York Groove\" and \"Into the Night.\"\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Ace Frehley\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

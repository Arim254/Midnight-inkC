    "body": "\n\tRicky Gervais appeared to laugh at this year’s crop of Grammy winners for their politically-charged speeches, taking to X after the 2026 ceremony to share an excerpt from his 2020 Golden Globes monologue in which he told the actors in the room not to turn their acceptance speeches into political calls to action. Gervias used a crying emoji after the Grammys and wrote: “They’re still not listening.” \n\n\t“If you do win an award tonight, don’t use it as a political platform to make a political speech,” Gervais advised in 2020. “You’re in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.”\n\t\n\n\tGervais posted and then took down the same exact message last September after the 2025 Emmys. At that ceremony, “Hacks” star Hannah Einbender notably won for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series and used her acceptance speech to say “fuck ICE” and “free Palestine.” \n\n\n\tThe 2026 Grammys were largely defined by politically-charged speeches. Billie Eilish, Justin and Hailey Bieber, Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon, Jack Antonoff and more musicians wore “ICE Out” pins to the ceremony. Eilish won song of the year for “Wildflower” and said “fuck ICE” during her speech, adding: “No one is illegal on stolen land. And, yeah, it’s just really hard to know what to say and what to do right now, and I feel really hopeful in this room, and I feel like we just need to keep fighting and speaking up and protesting, and our voices really do matter, and the people matter.”\n\n\tBad Bunny, who won album of the year and best música urbana album during the live Grammys telecast, said “ICE out!” during his speech and added: “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans…. hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love. So please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love.”\n\t\n\n\tEven some winners who did not necessarily call out ICE directly still championed immigrants during their politically-minded acceptance speeches. Olivia Dean won best new artist and said: “I want to say I’m up here as a granddaughter of an immigrant. I wouldn’t be here… I’m a product of bravery, and I think those people deserve to be celebrated. We are nothing without each other.”\n\n\tShaboozey won his first Grammy award by taking home the prize for best country duo/group performance (“Amen” with Jelly Roll) and said in his speech: “Immigrants built this country, literally. So this is for them, for all children of immigrants. This is also for those who came to this country in search of a better opportunity to be part of a nation that promised freedom for all and equal opportunity to everyone willing to work for it. Thank you for bringing your culture, your music, your stories and your traditions here. You give America color. I love y’all so much.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Housekeeper,” the evocative romance that fictionalises the inspiration behind Daphne du Maurier’s “Rebecca” and was first announced by Variety in 2024, is gearing up to start production. \n\n\tBAFTA winner and Oscar nominee Helena Bonham Carter (“The Crown,” “One Life”), BAFTA and Golden Globe nominee Caitríona Balfe (“Belfast,” “Ford v Ferrari”), and fast-rising star Emma Laird (“The Brutalist,” “28 Years Later”) have joined show alongside the already announced two-time Oscar winner Anthony Hopkin (“The Father,” “The Silence of the Lambs”). Previously attached stars Uma Thurman and Phoebe Dynevor are no longer appearing.\n\t\n\n\tDirected by multi-award-winning filmmaker Sir Richard Eyre (“The Children Act,” “Notes on a Scandal,” “Iris”) and written by acclaimed bestselling author Dame Rose Tremain, “The Housekeeper” is based on her own short story and forthcoming novel scheduled to be published by Penguin Random House UK and Harper Collins US in the fall of 2026.\n\n\tSet against the wild, brooding landscape of Cornwall, the story centers on Danni (Balfe), the housekeeper at Manderville Hall, a grand historic house owned by the wealthy and widowed Lord Grenville-Whithers (Hopkins). When the young writer Daphne du Maurier (Laird) arrives, Danni is drawn into a clandestine and intoxicating affair. For one, it is an all-consuming love; for the other, an awakening of long-suppressed desires. Their fragile secret threatens to unravel under the watchful gaze of Adelaide (Bonham Carter), Lord Grenville-Whithers’ calculating niece.\n\n\t“Rose Tremain has written a brilliant screenplay which is dark and surprising and mysterious, and we look forward to making a film which lives up to its promise,” said Eyre.\n\t\n\n\tProducers on the film are Julia Taylor-Stanley for Artemis Films, Kevin Loader for Embankment, and Herbert L. Kloiber for Night Train Media. Night Train Media has boarded the project as producer and principal financier. The Munich and London-based company will oversee global exploitation working with Embankment Films, who handle global sales. Additional finance was provided by Head Gear Films, M2 Mediapost, FireFrame Studios and Screen Cornwall. Executive producers are Phil Hunt and Compton Ross for Head Gear Films, and James Copp for Night Train Media.\n\n\t“Assembling a cast of such calibre speaks to the power of Rose’s storytelling, and to Richard’s standing amongst the great British directors,” said Taylor-Stanley. “We are excited to be working with our talent on bringing this compelling story to the screen.”\n\n\tAdded Kloiber: “The Housekeeper promises audiences an intoxicating blend of passion, elegance, and emotional truth, brought to life through Rose Tremain’s exquisite writing and Richard Eyre’s masterful direction.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFilipino-Australian director James J. Robinson is bringing his debut feature “First Light” to the International Film Festival Rotterdam, where the drama explores the intersection of faith, colonialism and institutional corruption through the story of an elderly nun confronting moral questions in the Philippines. Variety is exclusively unveiling a clip from the film.\n\n\tThe film, which had its world premiere at the 2025 Melbourne International Film Festival, stars Ruby Ruiz as Sister Yolanda, a nurse and nun whose quiet life of service is upended when a young construction worker dies under suspicious circumstances. The incident forces her to reckon with the church and community she has served for decades.\n\t\n\n\tRobinson explains that his approach to the material came from personal experience. “I was raised Catholic, and from a young age, already realizing that I was queer, it kind of set me off on this different path where my introduction to Catholicism was doubt,” he says. \n\n\n\tThat early experience of questioning set Robinson on a different spiritual trajectory than many Catholics. “I was very anti-Catholic for a period, and quite angry at the church for instilling a lot of these beliefs around sin for me,” he says. “And then I’ve graduated to this point where I can realize that there is a difference between the actual beautiful religion at the heart of something and the institution and politicians that can co-opt that beauty.”\n\n\tThe film arrived at an unexpectedly prescient moment. Written and produced before widespread anti-corruption protests erupted in the Philippines in 2025, “First Light” deals specifically with government funds ending up in the pockets of wealthy construction families – precisely the issue that sparked national demonstrations over mismanaged flood infrastructure projects.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s this thing where, cool, as we’re making this film, the world is progressing, the things I was commenting on are changing,” Robinson says. “But then when the corruption protests started, it was this feeling of, oh, this film has only become more relevant. It was sad that it got to the point where protests had to happen, but there was so much beauty in resistance and in standing up.”\n\n\tThe director notes that the film was also in production around the time the International Criminal Court arrested former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for his war on drugs. “It goes to say that the things we were writing about have always been relevant in Filipino history,” Robinson says. “They were relevant back in the days of colonization, and they’re relevant today.”\n\n\tThe director was careful to avoid didacticism in tackling such politically charged material, choosing instead to focus on personal story over political polemic. “There’s a way you could do this film which would have been very essayistic,” he says. “The reason that I want to make films is that through the tangible stories and experiences, you can come to understand grand topics.”\n\n\tThe director sees Sister Yolanda’s arc as a metaphor for Philippine history itself. “I track her journey from the farmland when she’s young into the institutions, and then wherever she ends up at the end is very much the story of the Philippines,” he says. \n\n\tRobinson worked extensively with Ruiz, a veteran Filipino actor known for films including “Iska,” “Ma’Rosa” and the Prime Video series “Expats,” to develop Yolanda’s largely interior performance. Ruiz, who also works as an acting coach training young Filipino performers, brought significant expertise to the collaboration.\n\n\tThe director describes Yolanda’s composure as “quiet strength,” with only one scene where the character truly breaks down emotionally – when she returns to her childhood farm and encounters what may be a spirit from the land. “That’s the one time in the film where she actually emotes, like really, really emotes, and she cries and she lets it out,” Robinson says. “I wanted that experience and that scene to be as strong as possible and to surround it in moments of her always being strong.”\n\n\tThe production itself reflected the film’s themes of decolonization, with Robinson and his team making deliberate choices about how Australian funding would be used in the Philippines. “We’re making this film about the history of colonization and how that continues to echo today,” Robinson explains. “We can’t be bringing Australian funding into the Philippines and paying people poorly and taking advantage of lax labor laws. We’re only going to make this film if we can pay people properly and give people proper hours and take every step we can to use the money in a positive way.”\n\t\n\n\tRobinson sees the legacy of colonization as pervasive in contemporary Philippine society. His own family history illustrates the point — his great-great-grandfather fought in the Filipino-American War at the turn of the 20th century as a revolutionary against colonization. Yet Robinson observes how American cultural influence persists in his mother’s generation.\n\n\t“To this day, my mom always believes that American products are the best in the world, like Coke is the best, American food is the best,” he says. “This way that colonization has continued to bleed into everyday society in the Philippines, and the fact that we are the most Catholic country in all of Asia to this day is just this example of how colonization has sadly cut our relationship with more pre-colonial ways of thinking about the Earth and the planet and having these old indigenous knowledge systems.”\n\n\tShot on location in the Ilocos and Calabarzon regions of the Philippines, the film’s visual language was shaped by Robinson’s extensive research into indigenous Filipino knowledge systems and his time spent in ancestral territories. The director wrote the first draft before visiting some locations, then spent significant time in the regions during development.\n\n\tThat immersion led to one of the film’s pivotal lines, spoken by Yolanda about death. “She says that death is just rain returning back into the ocean,” Robinson says. “That was an image that I had while I was out there. So much of indigenous knowledge systems that were destroyed when the Spanish had come and tried to enforce this hegemony over everything – a lot of it is just knowledge and wisdom that comes from the earth.”\n\n\tRobinson’s previous work includes the 35mm short documentary “Inang Maynila,” which detailed a personal investigation into his mother’s youth under martial law in the Philippines and was acquired by Nowness. \n\n\t“First Light” is produced by Gabrielle Pearson of Majella Productions and Jane Pe Aguirre, with Christelle Lou Dychangco serving as co-producer. Executive producers are Nick Batzias and Virginia Whitwell. The cast also includes Carissa “Kare” Adea, Maricel Soriano, Soliman Cruz, Emmanuel Santos, Rez Cortez and Kidlat Tahimik.\n\n\tIndependent Entertainment handles international sales.\n\n\tWatch the clip here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAwedacious Originals has boarded Bangladeshi filmmaker Mejbaur Rahman Sumon’s “Roid” as executive producer. The film is in the Tiger competition at the International Film Festival Rotterdam.\n\n\tInternational Emmy Award-winning producer Apoorva Bakshi of Awedacious is executive producing the feature, which marks Sumon’s sophomore effort following his 2022 breakout “Hawa,” Bangladesh’s Academy Award submission that became the first Bangladeshi film to chart on U.S. box office rankings.\n\t\n\n\tThe film examines desire and attachment through the story of a couple living in near isolation in rural Bangladesh. A shy man repeatedly attempts to abandon his volatile wife in unfamiliar places, only to have her return each time a fruit falls from the palmyra palm near their home. The narrative draws parallels to the Garden of Eden story while exploring primal human bonds.\n\n\n\t“Mejbaur’s ‘Roid’ is powerful, mythic, and deeply human, with an uncompromising lyrical force,” Bakshi said. “The film confronts desire, attachment, and compulsion as natural forces rather than emotional constructs. Beneath its repetition and silences lies a fundamental truth: life’s longing for itself. That kind of philosophical boldness in narrative is rare, and it resonated deeply with us at Awedacious.”\n\n\t“Roid” is inspired by a true story Sumon heard from his mother about a couple who worked in his grandfather’s house. “The husband repeatedly abandoned his wife. She returned to him again and again,” the director said. “What moved me was the woman’s constant return. In it, I felt a search for something primordial, perhaps a bond older than reason.”\n\t\n\n\tThe project is co-produced by Mushfiqur Rahman and Tanvir Ahmed Shovon for Bongo, Shimul Chandra Biswas for Facecard, and Tanveer Hossain, alongside Sumon.\n\n\t“Sumon is a visionary. From ‘Hawa’ to ‘Roid,’ his ambition is undeniable,” said Mushfiqur Rahman. “We’re proud to produce a film poised to captivate audiences everywhere.”\n\n\tShimul Chandra Biswas added: “I produced ‘Roid’ because it reflects questions I couldn’t ignore – a journey I chose to live before it reached the screen. It changed how I understand closeness.”\n\n\t“I was struck by how Sumon could look at ordinary lives and find within them an extraordinary absurdity and profound philosophical richness,” said Hossain, a Berlinale Talents alumnus whose recent credits include “Ali,” which earned a special mention at Cannes 2025. “’Roid’ does not shout its ideas. It listens. It allows silence, contradiction, and fragility to coexist.”\n\n\tThe film was selected for the co-production market at India’s Film Bazaar in 2024. It stars Mostafizur Noor Imran, Nazifa Tushi, Gazi Rakayet, and Ahsabul Y Riad, with cinematography by Joaher Musavvir Jyoti.\n\n\tBakshi’s Awedacious Originals, co-founded with Monisha Thyagarajan in 2020, launched with the Emmy-winning Netflix series “Delhi Crime” and has since produced “The Hunt for Veerappan” for Netflix, documentary “WOMB (Women of My Billion)” for Prime Video, and the Oscar-shortlisted animated feature “The Glassworker.“​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

    "body": "\n\tBerlin-based international sales agency Pluto Film has added Marina Andree Škop’s and Vanda Raýmanová’s “warm, funny and imaginative” detective tale “Extraordinary” to its European Film Market slate.\n\n\tThe company expects to announce which festival will host the film’s world premiere soon.\n\n\tIn “Extraordinary,” 10-year-old Alice sets out on a search when both her parents vanish. She gets help from a gang of boy detectives and her unusual brother, who experiences the world differently. His unique perspective becomes the unexpected key to unravelling the mystery.\n\t\n\n\tWith their film, Škop and Raýmanová hope to “encourage children to accept the differences between them, whether big or small, health-related, social or any other, as well as making young audiences laugh, worry and dream. While planting small seeds of empathy that will stay with them long after the screening,” they said.\n\n\n\t“ ‘Extraordinary’ is a detective adventure with a heart,” said Pluto managing director Daniela Cölle. “It’s a rare gem in children’s cinema that explores neurodiversity and sibling relationships while celebrating acceptance. This is more than entertainment; it’s representation that truly matters.\n\n\t“By centering a character who sees and experiences the world differently, the film teaches young audiences – and their families – that uniqueness is not a limitation but a superpower. It shows why neurodivergent representation in children’s storytelling is so crucial. Through a narrative that’s both entertaining and deeply meaningful, this film offers something precious: a story that resonates across generations and changes how we understand each other.”\n\t\n\n\tThe directors opted for an autistic character, they said, “because it enabled us to create a wholly distinctive film character with a specific perception of the surrounding world. The fact that every person with autism is unique made it possible for us to convey this fragile and difficult topic to children’s audiences through animation, which is close to them, and which can help them see into the internal world of our character. We believe that this playful approach, along with the strongly artistically stylized film language, will strengthen the important themes of compassion, solidarity and co-operation.”\n\n\tŠkop’s first feature-length documentary “Sevdah” won the Audience Award at the Sarajevo Film Festival in 2009. In 2019, she completed the children’s sci-fi feature :My Grandpa Is an Alien,” co-directed with Dražen Žarković. The film was released in 26 countries and won 16 festival awards.\n\n\tRaýmanová established a production company Objectif Ltd. in 2013. The company’s goal is to introduce new forms of stories with creative originality for kids. Alongside a number of shorts, Raýmanová directed the animated TV series “The Tots” (Drobci, 2016-2025).\n\n\tThe two directors jointly produced “Extraordinary”: Škop for PomPom Film and Raýmanová for Objectif.\n\n\tCo-producers are Senca Studio, Air Productions, Slovak Television and Radio, This and That Productions, 247HUB, Spotlight Production and Radio-Television Slovenia. “Extraordinary” is a co-production between Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Latvia and Serbia.\n\n\tThe film is set for a release in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina on Feb. 19.\n",

    "body": "\n\tL.A.-based sales firm Concourse Media has snagged worldwide sales rights to Costa Rican family drama “April” (“Abril”) ahead of its Feb. 7 world premiere at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\n\n\tThe company aims to kick off sales at the festival before continuing at the European Film Market (EFM) in Berlin.\n\n\tA deeply personal story for writer-director Hernán Jiménez, “April” follows the titular character, a divorcée played by Maricarmen Merino, who struggles to connect with her resentful daughter. When the daughter decides to live with her father, April is at a loss until she meets hunky bartender Gabriel, played by “Heated Rivalry” star François Arnaud in his first Spanish-speaking role. This unexpected bond with Gabriel offers her a glimpse of life beyond marriage and motherhood – until buried truths about her past push her toward collapse.\n\t\n\n\t“’April’ is a deeply human story that feels both intimate and universal,” said Kristin Harris, head of acquisitions at Concourse Media. “Hernán Jiménez brings extraordinary empathy and precision to the film and Maricarmen Merino delivers a performance that is quietly devastating.”\n\n\n\tJiménez, who plays the ex-husband, based the story on his own frayed relationship with his mother. He also left home early, breaking her heart in the process. His movie has a more upbeat ending unlike that of his mother’s whose mental and physical health declined.\n\n\t“I see it more as a bittersweet ending than a fully happy one. But yes, I think Abril as a character tries not only to portray my mother, but to reclaim her in some way. Notice that something very curious – and again, bittersweet – has happened with the decline in my mother’s mental and physical health: I’ve been able to say things to her, touch her, hug her in ways I never could before. Something like the daughter Valentina’s message at the end. So today my mom is “far away” in a sense, but closer than she ever was before,” he told Variety.\n\t\n\n\t“My history with my mother is very complicated. I don’t think the film manages to capture it completely, but it’s an attempt,” he noted.\n\n\tThe film was produced by Jiménez and Esteban Quesada under their production company Witch Rock. \n\n\tHe added: “From our first conversations, Concourse Media understood what makes this film special and how to position it internationally. I’m excited to have them leading worldwide sales, and grateful to be working with a team that’s both ambitious for the film and deeply respectful of the work.”\n\n\tJiménez’ multiple credits include romcom “Entonces nosotros” (“About Us”) which nabbed the second-best opening weekend for a local film in the history of Costa Rican cinema and represented the country at the 89th Academy Awards.\n\n\tHe later made his English-language feature debut with “Elsewhere,” which debuted in 2020 and stars Parker Posey, Aden Young, Ken Jeong and Beau Bridges.\n\n\tHe also co-wrote Amazon Studios’ biopic “A Million Miles Away,” based on the life of NASA astronaut José Hernández, played by Michael Peña and directed by Mexico’s Alejandra Márquez Abella.\n\n\tHis Netflix romantic comedy “Love Hard” debuted in 2021 where it became the platform’s top-ranked film internationally.\n\n\tJimenez had been struggling for years to make “April” in Los Angeles where he resides. “After years of development limbo, I got tired of waiting: I flew back to Costa Rica and poured my heart (and the entirety of my savings) into ‘Abril.’ This film is the result of one of the most loving and healing collaborations I’ve ever experienced, and it has changed the trajectory of how I write, direct, act and create.” Shooting in Costa Rica was also an eye-opening experience. The country now boasts more competitive film incentives, skilled bilingual crews and a proven track record from a diversity of international shoots.\n\n\t“April” lead Merino is also a director. Her short film “Bella” screened in official selections at the Guadalajara Film Festival and EnergaCameraimage and garnered the best director award at the International Short Film Festival in Mexico. Her documentary feature debut,“¿Dónde estás?” premiered at the 2018 Guadalajara Film Festival.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrançois Arnaud and Maricarmen Merino in ‘April’  Courtesy of Witch Rock\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs ways to spend an indecent amount of money go, James “Fergie” Cox Chambers Jr. hit on a pretty decent-sounding one. A former heir to the multibillion Cox Enterprises fortune, since gone rogue with ample millions of his own, the now 40-year-old political activist decided to found and fund a communist collective in rural Massachusetts, offering free accommodation to less fortunate residents aligned with his Marxist-Leminist principles. It’s the kind of idealistic vision that can only be more complicated in practice, and so it proves in “All About the Money,” Irish docmaker Sinéad O’Shea’s timely, pointed examination of how capitalist privilege can corrupt even an expressly anti-capitalist project.\n\t\n\n\tBeginning with its introductory title cards reminding us that the combined wealth of America’s richest 1% equals that of its poorest 90%, the economic lessons of “All About the Money” aren’t news to anyone who has been trying to carve out a living in the 21st century. But Chambers is a compellingly eccentric figure to build such a study around, at once slippery and transparent in his values and vanity: a self-styled rebel whose often heedless attempts to repudiate his elite heritage only wind up reinforcing the lofty protection that his background still affords him. \n\n\n\tIn a film markedly different in subject and scope from her recent, reverent writer study “Blue Road: The Edna O’Brien Story,” O’Shea probes Chambers with a cool head and an open mind, yielding many surprising confessions, though never quite pinning him down. Premiered in Sundance’s world cinema documentary section, this stylistically straightforward doc could find limited theatrical distribution, but seems best suited to find a receptive audience on streaming platforms.\n\t\n\n\tBeyond his professed left-wing ideals, it takes a while for O’Shea to uncover the full reasons behind Chambers’ alienation from his excessively moneyed family — a dynasty that includes his father, renewable energy business James Cox Chambers; his great-grandfather, former Democratic presidential nominee James M. Cox; and his grandmother, former NASA software engineer Margaret Hamilton, whom Chambers claims is the only relative he’s still in touch with. A history of childhood mental illness, drug use and sexual abuse emerges in fits and starts, but you’d be forgiven for ascribing a certain air of edgelord agitation to his image as a communist firebrand — which, if the varied slogans and symbols tattooed on his body and face are any indication, skips quite restlessly between sociopolitical causes and inspirations.\n\n\tThe residents of his Alford, MA commune, which comprises six homes and a multipurpose community center for a handful of left-wingers hired to work the land, aren’t inclined to look too deeply into his motivations: “If I didn’t live here, I wouldn’t believe it,” says one, happy simply to be a beneficiary of this generous experiment. Yet the fact that O’Shea’s interviews with Chambers begin with him holed up, some years later, in a luxurious apartment in Ireland suggests something has gone awry in the interim. \n\n\tMuch of it comes down to Chambers and his fellow revolutionaries’ response to the events of October 7, 2023, which includes his funding of Palestine Action US and an attack on a New Hampshire office of Israel-based military technology company Elbit Systems — the legal consequences of which see Chambers flee to Tunisia. The members of the Alford collective — in particular, ardent activist Paige Belanger — don’t have the luxury of that escape route, and feeling increasingly hung out to dry by their leader and benefactor. And so the communist dream crumbles.\n\n\tThough O’Shea devotes some screen time to the stories and perspectives of these variously disillusioned acolytes, “All About the Money” is understandably most fixated on Chambers, a mercurial, unlovably charismatic figure who alternates wildly between animated supposed truth-telling and more evasive conversational tactics. But it’s often his most ordinary statements and word choices that give him away — as when he says that he felt Alford, as an investment, was “interesting as well as useful,” suggesting that this rather high-stakes human project was a curiosity-sating experiment more than anything else. \n\t\n\n\tBut then he warns us, too, that everyone should fear “an extremely wealthy member of the white American bourgeoisie” — ultimately characterizing himself as that which he insists, at least spiritually, he’s not. Who is Chambers really, behind all this provocation and prevarication? “All About the Money” never quite finds out, but it excavates enough to hint that he might not know either.\n",

    "body": "\n\tYouTuber Markiplier got emotional about the remarkable turnout for “Iron Lung,” a very independent filmmaking adventure that debuted at No. 2 in North America with $17.8 million from 3,015 theaters.\n\n\t“Iron Lung” also earned $3 million internationally for a global tally of $21.7 million. This opening weekend is notable because “Iron Lung” wasn’t far behind a major release from Disney — Sam Raimi’s thriller “Send Help,” which launched to $30 million — but without mainstream resources. Markiplier (whose real name is Mark Fischback) self-financed and distributed “Iron Lung,” which reportedly cost $3 million to produce. He also wrote, directed and stars in the film, a post-apocalyptic video game adaptation about a fugitive who has to scavenge natural resources in an ocean of blood after a rapture. \n\t\n\n\t“I’m tearing up at the beginning of this,” Markiplier said during a YouTube livestream on Sunday night. “It’s been a bit of an emotional day in the best way possible. So I’ll first say, ‘Thank you guys so much.'”\n\n\t“Iron Lung” won’t be playing in many theaters next weekend, Markiplier shared during the video that he titled “ACTUAL EMERGENCY MEETING!!” Even with a theatrical run that’s much shorter than most movies, “Iron Lung” will be hugely profitable for Markiplier and cinema owners, who share the revenue from ticket sales. \n\n\t“I personally don’t care about the numbers, other than, ‘Woohoo, success.’ I’m going to be able to give the crew a big bonus. That’s awesome. I’m not a big studio. So the split with the theaters is basically 50-50. It’s really cool because everybody wins.”\n\t\n\n\tMarkiplier shared that “Iron Lung” was originally scheduled to play in just 50 theaters before exhibitors got on board and booked the movie in venues all around the country. He fielded calls about a major studio helping with theatrical rollout before moving forward with the decision to self-distribute. \n\n\t“It’s kind of a hero moment to showcase indie filmmaking is possible,” he said.\n\n\tSince “Iron Lung” is only slightly behind “Send Help” on domestic box office charts, Markiplier urged any curious fans to check out the film before the weekend ends in hopes of toppling Raimi’s release from the No. 1 spot.\n\n\t“If you didn’t have any plans tonight, or — just because movies are so confusing, you have to watch it twice — maybe you could see it,” he said. “I’m almost hesitant to ask this, but I think it might be a big win for independent filmmaking. It’s not to shut out Sam Raimi. It’s kind of to shut out Disney for winning [the box office], like, 10 weeks in a row. Maybe they could only win nine weeks in a row, the one weekend that ‘Iron Lung’ is here. If that could inspire someone to keep making films, that’d be pretty cool. And maybe it could open up a door for other people that do their projects independently and know that there could be success in it.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, Markiplier shared his own plans for Monday. “I’m going to watch ‘Send Help.’ I want to watch it so bad.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe seismic scandal involving former Huw Edwards — one of U.K. TV’s highest profile figures and a BBC news anchor who in 2024 pleaded guilty to making indecent images of children and was placed on the U.K.’s sex offender register — is being turned into a TV drama. \n\n\t“Power: The Downfall of Huw Edwards” (working title) has been ordered by 5, the U.K. network owned by Paramount and will be produced by Wonderhood Studios. \n\n\n\tA year in the making, the two-part factual drama is set to examine how a “vulnerable 17-year-old was groomed by one of the most powerful figures in television,” according to the producers, with Martin Clunes (“Doc Martin,” “Out There”) portraying Edwards. The series will explore the “newsreader’s double life as it spirals out of control, leading him to make the greatest announcement of his career — his total exit from public life following his conviction for serious child sexual offences.”\n\t\n\n\tIt was in July 2023 when Edward’s secrets started to unravel rapidly after a national newspaper reported that “a top BBC star” had paid a “teenager for sexual pictures.” As it transpired, that star was Edwards — one of the best known faces on U.K. TV and the man who made the historic declaration that Queen Elizabeth II had died. Online, he was he was soliciting explicit sexual photos from young men, and struck up a friendship with a man who sent him messages containing child abuse imagery. Following a police investigation, he pled guilty to making indecent images of children at Westminster Magistrates Court.\n\n\t“Power: The Downfall of Huw Edwards” builds on factual research over the past 12 months, including first hand interviews and co-operation from those at the heart of the scandal and exclusive access to The Sun newspaper’s award-winning investigation into Edwards.\n\t\n\n\t“This is an important and shocking story – of how a man in a position of power and trust betrayed that status,” said Ben Frow, chief content officer at 5. “By gaining exclusive access to the key individuals involved and those who investigated the story, we explore the human cost behind the headlines. As a close collaboration between 5’s factual and scripted teams this is a first for the channel.”\n\n\tAdded David Abraham, founder and group CEO, at Wonderhood Studios: “This project marks Wonderhood’s first step into drama and builds on our record in producing premium documentaries about challenging subjects that matter.”\n\n\t“Power: The Downfall of Huw Edwards” is a Wonderhood Studios production commissioned by Guy Davies (consultant editor for commissioning, 5) and Paul Testar (commissioning editor, scripted, 5) and co-produced with programme financiers Krempelwood. The series is directed by BAFTA and EMMY winning Michael Samuels (“The Windermere Children,” “Any Human Heart”) and written by Mark Burt (“The Trial”). The producer is Angie Daniell (“A Cruel Love: The Ruth Ellis Story,” “Vigil”), the casting director is Jenny Duffy, the factual producer is Louise Kentleton and director of production is Lianne Hickey. The executive producers are BAFTA-winner Samantha Anstiss and Tom Garton.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn a recent morning in midtown Manhattan, Spike Lee blows on an imaginary pair of dice before hurling them to the ground. It’s a gesture of respect for Ryan Coogler, the risk-taking director of “Sinners,” who put his “Black Panther” clout on the line to get Warner Bros. to back a $90 million vampire film set in the segregated South. Oh, and he convinced the studio to sign a deal giving him back the copyright to the film after 25 years.  \n\t\n\n\t“I believe in cinema,” the soft-spoken Coogler says in response.  \n\n\n\tThat belief paid off — “Sinners” became one of the year’s biggest hits, as well as a major Oscar contender. But Coogler’s not the only one taking risks. This year, Lee reteamed with Denzel Washington on “Highest 2 Lowest,” putting a new spin on Akira Kurosawa’s crime masterpiece “High and Low” by moving the action from postwar Japan to modern-day New York. It’s a pretty bold move to try to outdo one of cinema’s greatest directors, but Lee insists that the chance to transport the classic morality tale to his favorite city and set it in the world of hip-hop convinced him it was a story worth telling.  \n\n\tIn a spirited conversation, the two filmmakers compare notes on their latest work and discuss their partnerships with their favorite leading men — Washington, who has anchored five Spike Lee joints, and Michael B. Jordan, who has appeared  in all five of Coogler’s movies.  \n\n\tSpike Lee: Let’s talk about the phone call.  \n\n\tRyan Coogler: So we were at Imax headquarters in L.A., seeing the print. It’s the final check, making sure that everything is looking good. \n\t\n\n\tLee: That it’s hunky-dory! \n\n\tCoogler: It’s one of my favorite places to watch a movie. And I was thinking, “It’s a waste to screen it like that, without other people to appreciate it” — because we’re sick of looking at the movie at this point. \n\n\tLee: They made a big mistake! Tell ‘em! [Lee throws his head back, erupting in laughter.]  \n\n\tCoogler: I wanted to show you the movie. It’s got so many inspirations, but many of them are from your movies. I was just thinking, “Man, I should just check and see on the offhand chance that Spike is in L.A.” I called you, and you were like, “Yo, I’m here.”  \n\n\tLee: That’s the spiritual thing right there. Because usually I’m in and out of L.A. I’m at the JetBlue terminal at 6 a.m. at JFK, land, do what I got to do, run around. Then I’m on the red-eye that night. \n\n\tCoogler: First thing you said was “You don’t want to sit next to me.”  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBenedict Evans for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLee: I was giving you a warning. And I watched my brother’s film, and it’s like me sitting courtside at Madison Square Garden and we’re kicking the Celtics’ ass. I’m jumping up and down. I was buggin’. When that surreal music montage came up, I lost it, man. \n\n\tCoogler: It’s a dream come true, man, to be able to play the movie for somebody who you look up to. So many of your movies affected me. I felt the same way when I watched “Highest 2 Lowest.” Can I ask: Why Kurosawa?  \n\n\tLee: One of the great things about film school is that I was introduced to world cinemas. That’s when I saw “Rashomon,” and that was the basis for “She’s Gotta Have It.” In that film, there’s a rape and a murder, and various people share their idea of what happened. I just hijacked that idea and made a film about this woman, Nola Darling, who has three boyfriends with different perspectives. Jump many decades later: The phone rings, and it’s Denzel. And he says, “What’s up, Spike? I’m going to send you a script.” So when the FedEx truck pulled up the next day, I was waiting.  \n\n\tCoogler: You ran up on it before he got out of the car. \n\n\tLee: “Give me that thing.” [He pretends to grab a package.] So I read it. But here’s the thing: Even before I hung up the phone, I knew I was doing it, because Denzel was calling me. He knows what my wheelhouse is. But it wasn’t until we were doing press that journalists alerted us that our last film, “Inside Man,” was 20 years ago.  \n\t\n\n\tCoogler: Felt like yesterday? But you guys are in each other’s orbits. \n\n\tLee: Here’s the thing: We don’t really hang out. You can have a great relationship without being in each other’s mug every single minute. When you have the foundation of love and trust, the sky’s the limit. Boom shakalaka. After I read it, I said, “Number one: You’ve got to change the title so it’s ‘Highest 2 Lowest.’ Number two: We have to do a reinterpretation, not a remake.”  \n\n\tCoogler: What’s the difference between a reinterpretation and a remake? \n\n\tLee: Kurosawa’s film was set in postwar Japan. This is the current day. The Toshirô Mifune character was a factory owner. In this one, Denzel’s a music mogul; he’s like Berry Gordy. That’s my thing, music. And we’re shooting in New York.  \n\n\tCoogler Those magic details — the setting, the cultural shift. \n\n\tLee: What we kept from Kurosawa’s film is this idea of morality. What will you do for money? What will you do for your friend? Denzel’s character says, “All money ain’t good money.”   \n\n\tLet me ask a question: There were several studios that turned “Sinners” down. What was the issue? What were you asking for that a lot of studios said, “Nah.” \n\n\tCoogler: Man, it’d be hard to get into all the details. I mean, to be honest, man — \n\n\tLee: Final cut? Ownership? Let’s hear it! Ownership. \n\n\tCoogler: That was a part of it, man. But truthfully, we were fortunate that a lot of people wanted the project. \n\n\tLee: On certain conditions. In other words, it’s fucked up. \n\n\tCoogler: I’m not going to say that. \n\n\tLee: I can say it.  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBenedict Evans for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCoogler: I’m happy we were able to find a home with Warner Bros. And just that people came out, which is something that you can never control, right? It’s a risk. I’m willing to bet on a good story. I truly believe that there isn’t any experience like a movie in a theater, you know what I’m saying? Especially at this time, when we’re disconnected from each other. I can get groceries delivered to my house. I can order food from my favorite restaurant to my house. I can buy clothes from my house. All of these experiences are things that we used to go out and do in public. \n\t\n\n\tLee: Pros and cons.  \n\n\tCoogler: But for me going to sit in a movie theater, the best thing for me is not being able to press pause or stop it. Because the first thing I do, especially when I’m watching something scary, or I’m watching something that’s too funny or too shocking, if I’m at home, I press pause and give myself a chance to catch up. \n\n\tLee: Talk about your brother, Michael B. \n\n\tCoogler: I had decided I was going to do “Fruitvale Station,” about this young man, Oscar Grant, who had been murdered by a transit cop. We needed an actor that looked like him, because I was thinking the movie was only going to play in the Bay Area. But I figured if the actor didn’t look like Oscar, people would write the movie off as being BS out of the gate. So I literally was like, “Man, who could play this guy?” And I started thinking about Mike B. I met with him, and just we really got along, bro. And then when we got to work, that’s when it really lined up. He’s a great actor in that you don’t see the work. He just is the thing that’s in front of you. \n\n\tLee: He ain’t lyin’. \n\n\tCoogler: And while we were making “Fruitvale,” I was meeting with Stallone to see about getting “Creed” done. And then Stallone and Mike met, and they got along. So it was two movies back-to-back like that. And so vastly different from each other.  \n\n\tThere was some spiritual connection. On “Creed,” he had a whole month that was just fights. We didn’t have one stunt double. It was phenomenal, man. And for “Sinners,” it just started to make a lot of sense for him to be these twins and to stretch himself. For me, it was also a test of how far we could get the audience to go, because Mike’s so endearing and charismatic. And these guys are … these are bad dudes. One is a coldhearted killer, and the other is a manipulator. Seeing these guys unapologetically portrayed by an actor whose superpower is the audience is always with him was interesting.  \n\n\tLee: You flipped the script. \n\n\tCoogler: Each time we get together, I’m trying to challenge him, and he’s trying to challenge me. \n\n\tLee: How does he challenge you? \n\n\tCoogler: When he’s trying to get to the truth of a moment, when he’s trying to find it. He’ll also demand a lot of me. For instance, in “Sinners,” he’s basically got to hold himself as one brother dies in the other brother’s arms. So he’s got to give a dying performance with a huge blood prosthetic coming out of his neck, and then he’s got to turn around and hold himself. \n\t\n\n\tLee: That was done the same day? \n\n\tCoogler: Yeah. And with a lot of technical specifications. He’s on the ground, and he’s saying [to me], “Hey, man, I need you. I need you right here. Keep talking to me. Keep reminding me of where I am.” I pride myself on being there for actors. And because he can handle it, I want to make sure that I’m providing him with great roles. \n\n\tI feel like you do the same thing with Denzel. I don’t know if he gets a “Mo’ Better Blues,” a “Malcolm X,” a “Highest 2 Lowest,” if it’s not for you existing as a filmmaker.\n\n\tLee: Here’s the thing: We’re both very blessed to have our leading men. That’s what our job is; we’ve got to do what we can to get the best out of our actors. What we do is based upon love and trust. That’s the foundation. You don’t have that, then you’re up the creek. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAs comedian Nikki Glaser prepares to take the stage for the 83rd Golden Globes, the usual late-breaking anxiety has set in. With voting having closed Jan. 3, the industry’s final temperature check is underway, and the winners forecast reflects a Globes lineup that balances prestige and populism — with just enough unpredictability to keep pundits hedging their bets.\n\n\tIn best motion picture (drama), Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet” looks difficult to beat. There’s a theoretical late-surge scenario in which Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” muscles past it, but with the vampire drama positioned to dominate the cinematic and box office achievement category (and original score for Ludwig Göransson), the Globes may opt to spread the wealth.\n\t\n\n\tThat thinking extends to actress (drama), where “Hamnet”’s Jessie Buckley appears ready to convert critical admiration into a televised victory. A Globes win would formally kick off her march toward Oscar night, assuming she can hold off Renate Reinsve of “Sentimental Value.”\n\n\n\tThe comedy or musical race is comparatively straightforward. Warner Bros.’ “One Battle After Another” is widely expected to take home the top prize, with Paul Thomas Anderson poised to add a director win to the film’s tally. The Globes have historically been friendlier to auteurist studio plays in this category, and “One Battle” fits that mold neatly. Should it ultimately prevail at both the Globes and the Oscars, it would join a rare club of comedy or musical champions — including “Green Book,” “The Artist” and “Shakespeare in Love” — that went on to claim the best picture Oscar.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARTY SUPREME, Timothee Chalamet, 2025. © A24 / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe acting races offer a mix of expected outcomes and potential surprises. In comedy or musical, Ethan Hawke’s work as Lorenz Hart in Richard Linklater’s “Blue Moon” has been underestimated in some corners, and the film’s surprise best picture nomination suggests deeper support than assumed. Hawke could plausibly leapfrog over Timothée Chalamet of “Marty Supreme” and Leonardo DiCaprio of “One Battle After Another.”\n\n\tIn actress (comedy or musical), Rose Byrne is the safest bet for “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” likely edging out Cynthia Erivo’s turn in “Wicked: For Good” and Chase Infiniti’s breakout in “One Battle After Another.”\n\n\tErivo’s co-star Ariana Grande, meanwhile, appears to have a real possibility to collect her first major awards-season prize with a supporting actress win for “Wicked: For Good,” if Teyana Taylor (“One Battle After Another”) or Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas (“Sentimental Value”) doesn’t upset. Stellan Skarsgård is likely to triumph in the supporting actor field for “Sentimental Value.”\n\n\tThe lead actor (drama) race promises to make history, with Wagner Moura favored to win for “The Secret Agent” slightly pushing past Michael B. Jordan from “Sinners.” Moura, the first Brazilian man nominated in the category, looks to be following the path of Fernanda Torres, who earned a Globe for “I’m Still Here” last year.\n\n\tElsewhere, “It Was Just an Accident” is favored in non-English language film (but conversations with voters hint at another win coming through for “The Secret Agent”), while Netflix’s “KPop Demon Hunters” rounds out the film categories with projected wins in animated feature and original song for the chart-topping “Golden.”\n\n\tThere is potential to make history in the screenplay category, depending on which direction voters go. Paul Thomas Anderson could complete a rare hat trick to accompany projected directing and best picture wins for “One Battle After Another.” Only one writer-director-producer has ever pulled off that feat at the Golden Globes: Oliver Stone for the war drama “Born on the Fourth of July” (1989). Notably, the film went on to lose best picture.\n\t\n\n\tThere is also a credible scenario in which two non-English language films — “It Was Just an Accident” and “Sentimental Value” — emerge with victories. Still, there appears to be sufficient support among voters to push Ryan Coogler across the finish line for “Sinners,” which would make him the first Black winner of the screenplay category at the Globes. He would become just the fifth Black nominee overall, following Charles Fuller (“A Soldier’s Story,” 1984), Spike Lee (“Do the Right Thing,” 1989), John Ridley (“12 Years a Slave,” 2013) and Barry Jenkins (“Moonlight,” 2016, and “If Beale Street Could Talk,” 2018). \n\n\tAnd if Chloé Zhao were to triumph alongside her co-writer, Maggie O’Farrell, for “Hamnet,” she would become the first East Asian winner in the category.\n\n\tThe real question is whether the Globes will validate the consensus — or remind everyone that surprises remain part of their enduring brand.\n\n\tThe final Golden Globes winner predictions are below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJessie Buckley stars as Agnes and Paul Mescal as William Shakespeare in director Chloé Zhao’s HAMNET\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAgata Grzybowska\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tFilm\t\n\n\tBest Motion Picture (Drama)\n\n\tWill Win: “Hamnet” (Focus Features)Could Win: “Sinners” and “Sentimental Value”\n\n\tBest Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy)\n\n\tWill Win: “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)Could Win: “Marty Supreme” and “Bugonia”\n\n\tBest Actor (Drama)\n\n\tWill Win: Wagner Moura, “The Secret Agent” (Neon)Could Win: Michael B.

    "body": "\n\tThe nominations for the 2026 Actor Awards (previously the SAG Awards) have been announced, and Cynthia Erivo  (“Wicked: For Good”) and Wagner Moura (“The Secret Agent”) are among the biggest snubs as the Oscar race continues to take shape. Other surprising snubs include Dwayne Johnson in “The Smashing Machine,” Adam Sandler in “Jay Kelly,” and the entire cast of “Sentimental Value” (Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsgard, Elle Fanning and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas). All foreign-language movies and performances were shut out of the 2026 races in perhaps the most shocking snub of all.\n\t\n\n\tAlthough Erivo is nominated at Sunday’s Golden Globes (but won’t be in attendance), this is her second big miss for “Wicked: For Good” after being shut out of the Critics Choice Awards. Erivo’s acclaimed performance as Elphaba earned Oscar and SAG nods last year, but she no longer appears to be a sure thing ahead this month’s Oscar nominations after missing out on SAG approval for the sequel. Erivo’s co-star, Ariana Grande, did make the cut in the Actor Awards’ supporting actress race for “Wicked: For Good.”\n\n\n\tWagner Moura, who won best actor honors at Cannes and is widely seen as a frontrunner for an Oscar nomination for “The Secret Agent,” was also snubbed by the Actor Awards. The SAG-AFTRA voting body is far more domestic than the international make-up of the Academy’s actors branch. With nominations from the Globes and Critics Choice Awards, plus a win from the New York Film Critics Circle, Moura appears to remain a major contender going into the Oscar nominations.\n\n\tAlso snubbed was Adam Sandler for “Jay Kelly,” the actor’s first big miss of the season after landing in the best supporting actor categories at the Globes and Critics Choice Awards. The film’s leading man, George Clooney, was also snubbed, as was the movie’s star-studded cast in the main ensemble category.\n\t\n\n\tOn the television side, “The Last of Us” landed a stunt ensemble nom, but neither the actors nor the cast were nominated. Sterling K. Brown landed an acting nom for “Paradise” but the ensemble was not nominated. “Nobody Wants This” star Adam Brody earned a nod, but Kristen Bell and the cast were snubbed. “The Bear” landed a comedy ensemble nomination, but Jeremy Allen White did not.\n\n\tThe Actor Awards are voted on by a committee of 2,000 members (one for TV noms and one for film noms). The total voting body for the awards include 22,000 SAG-AFTRA members, the largest voting organization in Hollywood. For comparison, the entire Academy that votes on the Oscars is only made up of 11,000 members.\n\n\tSee the full list of 2026 nominees here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVeteran TV exec and Emmy-nominated producer Andy Friendly died Sunday, Jan. 4, at his home in Bel-Air, according to his family. Friendly was 74.\n\n\tFriendly, the son of legendary journalist Fred Friendly and brother of producer David Friendly, began his career as a writer and producer at NBC News in New York, later becoming a producer of Tom Synder’s “Tomorrow” late night talk show on the network. \n\n\n\tFrom there, Friendly helped create long-running entertainment news magazine “Entertainment Tonight” as the first producer of the strip series in 1981. Later, Friendly was VP of primetime programs at CNBC, overseeing talk shows hosted by Snyder, Tim Russert, Geraldo Rivera, Tom Snyder and other prominent journalists and talk-show hosts.\n\t\n\n\tHis boss at the time was David Zaslav, now CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\n\n\t“Andy was a brilliant producer and an exceptional leader who helped define CNBC during a pivotal period of growth and creativity,” Zaslav said. “He had an extraordinary ability to spot talent, nurture ideas, and bring out the very best in the people around him. But beyond his professional accomplishments, Andy was a special person and a dear and loyal friend. He led with generosity, humor and heart, and he cared very deeply about people. Andy made everyone feel valued, and his unique kindness and integrity will be remembered, just as powerfully as his creative legacy.”\n\n\tAfter CNBC, Friendly was president of programming and production at King World Productions. At King World, Friendly handled programming strategy, development and production for first-run syndication at the company, which distributed “Oprah Winfrey,” “Wheel of Fortune” and other series.\n\t\n\n\tFriendly was also a busy member of the TV community as president of the Hollywood Radio & Television Society. He was also an adjunct professor at his alma mater, the USC School of Cinematic Arts.\n\n\tFriendly served on the Board of Councilors of the USC Shoah Foundation, and on the Board of the Friends of the Saban Community Clinic.\n\n\tFriendly is survived by his immediate family, sister Lisa Friendly and brothers David Friendly, Richard Mark, Michael Mark, Jon Mark and Ruth Friendly along with many grandchildren, nieces and nephews. He is proceded in death by his late wife, Pat Crowley, who died in September. They wed in 1986.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Real Time With Bill Maher” has been renewed for two additional seasons, extending the political talk series through 2028 on HBO.\n\n\tAs previously announced, Maher will return on air on Jan. 23 for the Season 24 premiere, which will be available on cable and HBO Max. The show has also aired on CNN the next day.\n\n\tAiring on Friday nights, “Real Time” is a topical and often unfiltered series that brings together figures in politics, tech, media and entertainment in lively and sometimes tense panel discussions. Each episode also features a monologue from Maher, a one-on-one interview and the signature editorial segment “New Rules.” The show’s “Overtime” segment has become a draw on YouTube.\n\t\n\n\tMaher has hosted “Real Time” since 2003, after the fallout of his previous series “Politically Incorrect,” which aired on Comedy Central and then ABC. The show boasts more than 700 episodes and has featured guests including Elon Musk, Bernie Sanders, Ben Shapiro, Joe Biden, Robin Williams, Nancy Pelosi, Charlie Sheen, Marjorie Taylor Green, Mark Cuban and Ben Affleck.\n\n\n\tMaher has become a hallmark of HBO’s programming, having headlined his first comedy special on the network in 1989 and racking up 13 solo specials to date on the cabler. His latest hour, “Bill Maher: Is Anyone Else Seeing This?,” is nominated for a Golden Globe.\n\n\t“Real Time” is executive produced by Maher, Sheila Griffiths, Dean Johnsen, Billy Martin and Marc Gurvitz. Chris Kelly is a co-executive producer, Matt Wood is a producer and Paul Casey is the director.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tRose Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wagner Moura, Amy Madigan and Josh Safdie were among the winners who gathered Tuesday night at Tao Downtown in New York City for the 91st annual New York Film Critics Circle Awards.\n\n\tByrne was awarded the NYFCC best actress award for her performance in “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.” During her acceptance speech, she addressed the challenges of centering complex female characters in film.\n\t\n\n\t“It is still a risk to put a compromising and challenging female character front and center of a movie,” she said on stage. “And I ask you, the audience, to reckon with her. ‘Legs’ forces you to not ignore this woman, this mother, wife and therapist who is making some questionable choices to avoid some truly horrible ones.” \n\n\n\tShe went on to thank director Mary Bronstein and the film’s producers for, as she put it, “agreeing to cast the girl from ‘Bridesmaids.'” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRose Byrne at the 91st annual NYFCC awards                                \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDave Allocca / Starpix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEarlier on the red carpet, Byrne spoke to Variety about Paul Feig, who directed her in “Bridesmaids” and has had recent success with the thriller “The Housemaid,” starring Amanda Seyfried and Sydney Sweeney. The film has grossed an impressive $75.7 million in North America and $133 million worldwide to date — and was recently greenlit for a sequel.\n\n\t“I can’t wait to see it. I am, of course, behind,” Byrne said of “The Housemaid.” “I’m trying to see everything, but Paul is the biggest, sweetest, most darling man in the world, and he knows how to direct women. He just does. He loves women so much.” \n\t\n\n\tWhen asked about reuniting with Feig for the “Housemaid” sequel, Byrne replied, “I’ll wait for the call! I’ll let [Paul] know you reached out.” \n\n\tAnother notable film of 2025, “KPop Demon Hunters,” is also generating anticipation for a sequel. Directors Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans, along with producer Michelle Wong, attended the NYFCC ceremony to accept the best animated film award.\n\n\tAlthough outlets reported that Netflix and Sony have finalized a deal for a follow-up, with plans to release the sequel in 2029, producer Wong said, “I don’t know if that’s really confirmed yet.” \n\n\tShe added, “We are deep into the award season and just trying to focus on that. So once that’s over and we have some time, possibly? But there has to be a reason to make No. 2, and we haven’t figured that out yet.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChris Appelhans, left, Maggie Kang, Ken Jeong and Michelle Wong at the NYFCC Awards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDave Allocca / Starpix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn the horizon, the industry may see significant changes, particularly if Netflix moves forward with its acquisition of Warner Bros. \n\n\tKleber Mendonca Filho, director of “The Secret Agent” and winner of best foreign language film, told Variety he believes such a merger would be “a very bad idea” and that “we should respect theatrical.” \n\n\t“It’s too much power concentrated in one place,” Filho said. “I have nothing against streaming. I actually think it’s an amazing technology. I’m actually looking forward to the day ‘The Secret Agent’ will hit screening, but I’m only looking forward to that because I know that it will do everything it can theatrically in Brazil, in the U.S., in France — and I will make films for theatrical. I can only think in terms of making a film for theatrical. And once the film is done after three, four, five months, I will be very happy to promote the second life of that film on streaming.” \n\n\tMadigan, who had a breakout year as Aunt Gladys in Zach Cregger’s “Weapons,” expressed similar concerns about the potential sale of Warner Bros. to Netflix. \n\n\t“I get worried about Netflix — and I know they have lots of money — but I know that we’re always referred to not as film or cinema, but as content. And they’re very concerned about just having everybody look like that at things,” she told Variety. “Whether that comes to fruition or not, I don’t know, but that makes me nervous.” \n\t\n\n\tShe continued, “Whatever happens, a lot of people are going to lose their jobs, and our industry is in a difficult situation right now. So that makes me nervous also.” \n\n\t“The Secret Agent” star Moura, who won the NYFCC best actor award, said he hopes the deal doesn’t affect theatrical releases, noting that watching a film in a theater versus at home are “two completely different experiences.”\n\n\t“Both experiences are good, but one cannot erase the other, right?” Moura said. “Going to the theater with other people is an experience that we have to keep doing. It’s a very magical one and a very important one.”\n\n\tSee the full 2025 NYFCC Award winners here.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPaul Thomas Anderson and Benicio del Toro at the 91st annual NYFCC Awards                                       \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarion Curtis / StarPix for NYFCCA\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJosh Safdie, Isaac Mizrahi and Ronald Bronstein at the 91st annual NYFCC Awards\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDave Allocca / Starpix\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChase Infiniti and Amy Madigan                                 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDave Allocca / Starpix\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBen Stiller presents at the 91st Annual New York Film Critics Circle Awards \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarion Curtis / StarPix for NYFCCA\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLupita Nyong’o and Wagner Moura                                  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDave Allocca / Starpix\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEthan Hawke, Wagner Moura, Rose Bryne and Bobby Cannavale attend the 91st Annual New York Film Critics Circle Awards\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarion Curtis / StarPix for NYFCCA\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPaul Thomas Anderson and Chase Infiniti at the 91st NYFCC Awards.                              \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDave Allocca / Starpix\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDirecting a film can feel like an all-consuming job, a true labor of love. But for some directors, that passion compels them to take on more and more responsibilities on their features — not just because they can’t relinquish control, but because they revel in all of the storytelling process.\n\n\tSome, like Josh Safdie (“Marty Supreme”) Chloé Zhao (“Hamnet”) and Kelly Reichardt (“The Mastermind”) edit their movies — earlier this year, Sean Baker (“Anora”) became just the second director to win an Oscar for editing, following Alfonso Cuarón for “Gravity.”  Some directors even wear two hats on the set, either as actors, like Bradley Cooper (“Is This Thing On?”) or as cinematographers, like Steven Soderbergh and Zack Snyder. The smallest Venn diagram overlap is probably directors who write their own scores, with Charlie Chaplin, Clint Eastwood and John Carpenter leading the way.\n\t\n\n\tDirectors doubling as editors is the most natural move because it’s a crucial extension of the storytelling.\n\n\n\t“Editing is where the film’s meaning is truly born, so I can’t physically stay far from the material,” says Kaouther Ben Hania (“The Voice of Hind Rajab”).\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHelmer Kaouther Ben Hania had a hand in cutting “The Voice of Hind Rajab.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“The Voice Of Hind Rajab” (Courtesy of the Venice Film Festival)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tStill, becoming an editor often starts more organically. “In film school, if you didn’t edit your film, nobody would do it for you, and on your first film, you also end up editing out of need,” Cuarón says.\n\n\tReichardt recounted in an email interview that she barely had enough money to shoot “Old Joy”: “With no funds to hire an editor, I cut the movie myself.”\n\t\n\n\tNow Reichardt edits her films by choice, wanting to be there as new ideas evolve in the editing suite. “I don’t like to miss out on any part of the process,” she says. “Editing is a place of discovery. I’m still amazed at how a few frames this way or that way can change the vibe of a conversation or the tension in a scene. I just don’t want to miss out on any of that.”\n\n\tIf Reichardt had an editor, she’d be frustrated. “I would just be sitting on a couch watching someone else cut and that would be really boring,” she says. \n\n\tBen Hania works with other editors and trusts their ideas but particularly early on, she says, “I need to experiment alone to try things.”\n\n\tReichardt and Cuarón, however, say that while they often share their work with collaborators, they’ve learned to be ruthless with their own footage.\n\n\t“I’m not precious about footage because it looks good or because it was the hardest day of the shoot or the most expensive,” Reichardt says. “I’ve cut out whole sections of a film with actors I love. If I’m on the fence about something, I try living without it. If its absence doesn’t haunt me, I leave it out.”\n\n\tCuarón says that when he assembles his first cut, he keeps his director’s hat on to shape the larger story. “Then I kick the director out, and I become merciless,” he says. “I don’t care about how difficult it was to get to that shot or how beautiful the light is or that it took two days to achieve it.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t Director Chloé Zhao co-edited “Hamnet.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFocus Features\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSometimes even directors who hand their films off to editors can’t say away. Carpenter says he’d sometimes have a “compulsion” to edit certain scenes. “In ‘Big Trouble in Little China,’ I edited the big alley fight because I just had to get my hands on it,” he remembers.\n\n\tCarpenter is better known for doubling as his own composer, which, like Reichardt’s editing, was born from necessity. “In the beginning I didn’t have money for good composers and my dad had taught me violin and piano and such — I only had medium chops but once I got hold of a synthesizer I could sound like an orchestra,” he says, adding that it was his father who had taught him the 5/4 time he used to write his iconic “Halloween” theme after an initial screening was deemed not scary enough. He continued writing scores because, while directing is his first love, “it’s fucking hard and has so much pressure attached, but writing music is so much fun.”\n\t\n\n\tThe bigger challenge for multi-hyphenate directors is juggling roles on the set. Ben Jacobson co-wrote and co-starred in his debut film “Bunny” with his best friend Mo Stark, but Jacobson had to constantly switch gears. He did it partly because they’d written his character, Dino, as “a version of myself — a movie-obsessed friendly person who’s a bit of a hothead,” and he couldn’t see anyone else in the role, and partly because he “wanted to play dress-up with my best friend.”\n\n\tStill, once the cameras started rolling, he says, “I often wished I wasn’t acting” so he could focus on his directing. He’d have to lean on their third writer, Stefan Marolachakis, to look in the monitor and assess his acting performance in each scene. As he and Stark prepare their next film, Jacobson is planning to take on a much smaller acting role. But if a producer said they liked his chemistry with Stark and wanted another buddy comedy, he’d consider it. “It depends on whether they’re giving us money, pay for the movie,” Jacobson says with a laugh.\n\n\tSnyder says that when he switched from commercial work where he operated the camera to directing movies, he was told being director of photography would be too much work. “I didn’t know anything about the movie business, so I said OK,” he recalls. But on “Dawn of the Dead” and then “300,” he’d often take the B camera or run a small second unit while his cinematographers were lighting a big setup. “We were dying to get everything shot on time so I’d just say, ‘Let me go shoot to move us along.’”\n\n\tAs his budgets grew those opportunities receded. “With giant movies like ‘Justice League,’ it gets so huge and you get pushed further away from the actual production,” he says. “I really got frustrated by that because I really am at my happiest when I have a camera in my hand.”\n\n\tHe always trusted his DPs and encouraged them to “flex their artistic muscles,” but in the last five years, starting with “Army of the Dead,” he has made smaller movies and insisted on being his own cinematographer. “It’s been the most liberating, happy experience — this is the why of making movies for me,” he says.\n\n\tStill, he acknowledges that it is exhausting. “You never stop,” he says. “From the moment you walk on the set to the moment you finally call wrap — if you’re the director and the DP, nothing can happen without you, so you’re on 24/7.” \n\t\n\n\tThat may be why so few directors do double duty and only one, Cuarón, has ever won an Oscar for cinematography. That was for “Roma,” and that happened by accident. Cuarón has always shot some days on his own films to keep things moving and done it for friends as well. But with “Roma,” he was again counting on Emmanuel “Chivo” Lubezki, with whom he’d worked on five features. (Lubezki won an Oscar for “Gravity.”) But mere weeks before shooting started, Lubezki realized there was a scheduling conflict.\n\n\tCuarón asked him to recommend another cinematographer. “He said, ‘I have the perfect person. You.’” Daunted, Cuarón talked to other DPs he admired but he realized that “all the conversations were going to be in English and for this film I wanted to completely immerse myself in my language and my memories.”\n\n\tWithout Lubezki around, there was some tension on the set. “The director thought that the DP was very slow and the DP thought the director was an asshole,” Cuarón reports wryly. But he adds that while he doesn’t envision tackling two jobs at once again, “I loved it. I probably enjoyed ‘Roma’ more as a DP than as a director.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSeveral animated features of 2025 tackled very thorny issues of inclusion and identity. \n\n\t“Zootopia 2,” “Elio,” “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” and “Arco” all delve into deep musings on self-identity, inclusion and even racism — so how does an artist express that through animation?\n\n\tJared Bush, co-writer and co-director of “Zootopia 2” with Byron Howard, notes that 14 years ago, he and Howard were hired for “Zootopia” and that from Day 1, “Byron and I spoke about the ability of animation to reach people. And specifically, there’s something about a world of animals that allows us to hold up this mirror to human nature and the patterns that we fall into. And it was something that allowed us to touch on some deep themes and things that are sometimes hard to talk about. But it made it accessible.”\n\t\n\n\tIn “Zootopia 2,” Gary De’Snake (voiced by Ke Huy Quan) works to restore the snakes’ ancestral homes. These habitats were destroyed, and the snakes were cast out, by wealthy lynxes who greedily expanded into the cold lands that suited their own species. Anti-snake propaganda and habitat destruction ensured the rest of the Zootopia population didn’t question the status quo.\n\n\n\tBush says that while they had to stick with the central theme of the differences that arose between Nick and Judy, now full-fledged police personnel, their research into animals showed that snakes were the opposite of mammals in almost every way — plus, most mammals have an inherent fear of and bias against snakes.\n\n\t“What’s fascinating, though, is our production designer, Cory Loftis, found a very specific species of pit viper — the Thai tree viper — it’s that brilliant blue color,” Bush says, a hue of blue that doesn’t show up in mammal colors. “So we wanted this character to immediately be an outlier, even among reptiles, an outlier. That was really important to us.”\n\t\n\n\tBush says that on the flip side, “pit vipers do have these incredible superpowers: the ability to sense heat, which gives them sort of a different way to maneuver in the world.” That became important later on, when Gary becomes the hero, “because of that difference, because of that otherness.”\n\n\tBush adds: “These were all really carefully constructed and thought-out ideas that all went back into this notion of what we are trying to say with the story.”\n\n\tBut Gary is still a snake, so …\n\n\tBush says that the character designers and Loftis really stepped up when it came to the reptiles and the less fuzzy wuzzy animals in the film, like the fact that snakes don’t have eyelids, so how do you create emotion through the all-important windows to the soul? Bush again credits the animators, citing Adam Green, who “spent a lot of time figuring out how to find emotion with Gary. We spent a lot of time making sure that he would be vulnerable and that he was this incredibly sympathetic and empathetic character.”\n\n\tThe research also turned up the fact that the scales of pit vipers are also feathery, “so when he smiles or emotes, you actually can see some of that breakup. It gives him specificity. And I would say not a cuddliness, but probably cuddlier than another snake might be because of that extra texture on his face,” says Bush.\n\n\tHe also credits Quan’s voice acting. “There was no one else we even considered for the role. He has this immense range of emotion; the second he talks, you lean in, and you want him to succeed, and you want him to be happy. And that’s such a critical part of, I think, why that Gary character works is because he matters to you,” says Bush.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” follows a young Belgian girl growing up in post-war Japan.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Little Amélie” animators and co-directors Maïlys Vallade and Liane-Cho Han adapted from the memoir of Amélie Nothomb chronicling the early childhood of the Belgian diplomat’s daughter in Japan. The film starts with her birth and follows her until about the age of three, exploring  themes of identity (Amélie thinks she’s Japanese), class and scars left from WWII.\n\n\t“It’s the end of the ‘60s, so it’s a specific point in her life,” says Han. Nishio-san, a young Japanese woman, is brought in to help around the house and cook, and she becomes Amélie’s companion. “And this little girl actually chooses to be Japanese. She feels that she’s Japanese. And we thought this was a very powerful and symbolic story, and we wanted to appeal to both an adult audience and a children’s audience, so we felt it was a very deep message about death, about grief, about accepting,” says Han.\n\t\n\n\tOne important scene that illustrates the versatility of animation is one in which Nishio-san explains to toddler Amélie what happened to her family in the war. In the book, it’s quite graphic, says Vallade. “We didn’t want to make something too violent. So that’s why our solution involved her cooking.” Nishio-san uses a pot of boiling water and rice to explain the bombing of her home and the deaths of her family. “So you could feel a bit more inside of her mind, of her emotional state. It was a big job to find this balance between the adult [themes] and make it for kids as well,” she says.\n\n\tThe book is about early childhood, so the character design reflects a more warm, round style. Han notes that the pair had worked with animator Rémi Chayé (director of “Calamity” and “Long Way North” who did backgrounds on “Amélie”), whose style using bold outlines matched what they were doing for their film. “Texture with a bit of pastel, you know, to feel like the character is even more blended into the background,” Han says.\n\n\tVallade adds that the connection between French Impressionist painters in the late 19th century and Japanese artists that spawned a movement called Japonais also influenced the look of the film. “It’s the Impressionist connection, trying to make some simple forms that can give a lot of emotion with the choice of very particular colors and mood.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Arco” is set in the future but the environments are familiar to 2025 audiences.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tUgo Bienvenu’s hand-drawn “Arco” tells the story of a boy called Arco who accidentally travels from the future Earth to 2075, which is adapting to a hostile climate. “Animation, to me, gives a lot more sensitivity and also depth; I have much more emotions in 2D than in 3D. I think it’s also because us humans recognize each other more in our errors, more in what we fail than what we achieve,” he says.\n\n\tAs for “Arco’s” style, which incorporates bright backgrounds and accessible characters, including humanoid robots, Bienvenu says, “I’m a drawer, and I have worked in comic books and illustrations for 15 years, and I didn’t try to find any new look.”\n\n\tHis near-future world is still familiar to audiences in 2025 as is Arco’s world, where they live in pod-like dwellings with gardens in the sky. He wanted to incorporate elements that were familiar to everyone, despite it being sci-fi. But that’s the point — our future looks similar to today, just with advancements in technology.\n\t\n\n\tBienvenu says, “And if I’m honest, tomorrow isn’t going to be better. And so I thought, if we want the best to happen, we have to imagine it first. So ‘Arco’ was a way for me to say, ‘Spread better ideas into the future so they can happen.’ The whole aim of ‘Arco’ is to say to people, imagine good things. And let’s bring better things to reality.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPhilippines media giant ABS-CBN‘s premium streaming platform iWant is betting on supernatural workplace comedy with “Nurse the Dead,” a bilingual half-hour series currently in production in Los Angeles. First looks have been unveiled.\n\n\tThe dark comedy follows Noa Reyes, a driven Filipina nurse supervisor whose ability to see ghosts — referred to as her “third eye” — makes her the go-to handler for a hospital ward teeming with restless spirits. Juggling demanding apparitions alongside staff burnout, family pressures and a coworker who seems to know more about her than expected, the series grounds its supernatural premise in the cultural specificity of the Filipino healthcare experience.\n\t\n\n\tThe project represents a significant expansion for iWant, marking the streamer’s first bilingual English-Tagalog series produced on U.S. soil. Production is underway in Los Angeles and is slated to wrap during the second week of February.\n\n\n\tMark Labella serves as showrunner, creator, writer and director on the series, with Wesley Villarica and Drea Castro directing episodes in a collaborative approach across the season.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Nurse the Dead”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tABS-CBN\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“‘Nurse the Dead’ is a dark comedy rooted in something very real: the Filipino healthcare experience,” Labella said. “Filipino nurses make up about 4% of the U.S. nursing workforce, yet were disproportionately represented among COVID-era nurse deaths — and that reality stayed with me. We’re using the supernatural and workplace chaos to explore grief, resilience, and legacy with bite, humor, and heart.”\n\n\tThe series stars Jelynn Malone as Noa Reyes. Malone, a Filipina American actor, host and Mostra Coffee co-founder, leads an ensemble cast that bridges Filipino and American entertainment. Gigette Reyes, who appears in Disney’s “Freakier Friday,” plays Mami Tess, while Johari Johnson (“American Crime Story: Impeachment,” “9-1-1: Lone Star”) portrays Jane.\n\t\n\n\tAnthony Jennings, the ABS-CBN breakout recently seen in the record-breaking “Hello, Love, Again,” takes on the role of Grim. The cast also features iconic multi-platinum Filipino recording artist and actor Tootsie Guevarra as Zeny, longtime “Eat Bulaga!” fixture Ruby Rodriguez as Ros, and award-winning Filipino actress Princess Punzalan as Camille.\n\n\tRounding out the principal cast are Sydney Bollenbeck (DonDon), Kyle Rezzarday (George) and Natalie Orsi (Archangel Yolanda).\n\n\tJolly Estaris, head of iWant and ABS-CBN Integrated Digital Sales, positioned the series as part of the platform’s broader strategy to reach Filipino diaspora audiences. “At iWant, we’re focused on building boldly Filipino storytelling with global reach,” Estaris said. “‘Nurse the Dead’ reflects that ambition – and producing our first bilingual series in Los Angeles marks a major step in iWant’s quest to connect with generations of audiences across the diaspora.”\n\n\tiWant serves a global audience with strong penetration across Filipino communities in North America, offering original series, films, and select live programming alongside library content from ABS-CBN.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Nurse the Dead”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tABS CBN\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tVariety is unveiling the first trailer for “Shanghai Daughter,” the debut feature from Chinese filmmaker Agnis Shen Zhongmin that will world premiere in the Panorama section of the 2026 Berlin International Film Festival.\n\n\tThe drama follows Ming, a Shanghai woman who travels alone to a rubber tree plantation in Xishuangbanna, along China’s southwestern border, searching for people who knew her late father during the Cultural Revolution’s Down to the Countryside Movement half a century earlier. As the old production team house faces demolition and mining companies and modern agricultural projects transform the land that once held rubber plantations, Ming encounters a farm officer, rural doctor, Dai elder, rubber tapper, young ecologist and a mysterious woman with a special connection to her.\n\t\n\n\tThe film draws from Shen Zhongmin’s personal experiences. “The seed of this film was sown 14 years ago, when my father had just passed away from illness,” the director explains in her statement. “His death and absence drove me to embark on a journey alone to the remote tropical land.”\n\n\n\tRepeated visits over the years fostered a deep bond with the region and its people. “Rooted in my family history, this film expands its thematic scope to an exploration of ecofeminism as well as the pivotal chapters of China’s social history,” Shen Zhongmin says. “And for me, it is also an experiment to explore a non-dual realm that blurs the lines between fiction and documentary, and between the private and the public, through a simple and meditative cinematic language.”\n\n\tThe production features non-actors and real-life individuals alongside lead actress Liang Cuishan, who previously appeared in “Cloud in Her Room,” which won the Golden Tiger Award at International Film Festival Rotterdam, and “Till Love Do Us Part,” which screened at Pingyao International Film Festival.\n\t\n\n\t“Beyond the non-actors/real-life individuals and the female lead, the landscapes, flora, and fauna of southwest China are also portrayed as silent characters in their own right,” Shen Zhongmin adds. “I hope this film can immerse the audience in a tangible geographical space, inviting them to walk, observe, listen, and feel alongside the characters.”\n\n\tShen Zhongmin is also a writer and author of short story collections including “Notes on Shanghai Geography,” “Deep Simulator” and “A Traveler’s Desire.” She graduated from Tongji University with a degree in film directing and screenwriting, and previously worked as a journalist and newspaper editor before moving into cross-disciplinary practice in contemporary art, literature and film.\n\n\tProducers are Xu Ruijing and Liao Yong for Twelve Oaks. Cinematographer is Pu Wei, with sound supervision by Dukar Tserang. The project was previously selected for the work-in-progress section of SIFF Project at the 2025 Shanghai International Film Festival.\n\n\tParallax Films is handling international sales. The film is shot in Mandarin Chinese and Dai dialect.\n\n\tWatch the trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDr. Peter Attia, who was recently named as a contributor to CBS News, put out a lengthy statement on X Monday morning saying he is “ashamed” of his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Attia and Epstein’s apparent friendship was revealed through emails included in the Department of Justice’s latest Epstein files release.\n\n\t“The purpose of the DOJ releasing these documents is clear: to identify individuals who participated in criminal activity, enabled it, or witnessed it. I am not in any of those categories, and there is no evidence to the contrary,” he wrote. “1. I was not involved in any criminal activity. 2. My interactions with Epstein had nothing to do with his sexual abuse or exploitation of anyone. 3. I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties.”\n\t\n\n\tAttia went on to apologize for his correspondence with Epstein. He called the emails “embarrassing, tasteless and indefensible.”\n\n\n\tAttia, a high-profile author, health influencer and celebrity doctor, was mentioned more than 1,700 times in the latest batch of files, which revealed a back-and-forth with Epstein that lasted long after the disgraced New York financier was hit with sex trafficking and prostitution charges. In a 2016 email to Lesley Groff, a former assistant to Epstein, Attia wrote, “I go into JE withdrawal when I don’t see him.”\n\n\tCBS News named Attia as one of 19 new contributors on Jan. 27. The move is part of editor-in-chief Bari Weiss’ mission to reshape the program for the modern era of media and newsmaking. Attia’s relationship with Epstein has ignited significant online blowback for CBS News. CBS has not yet confirmed whether Attia will remain a contributor.\n",

    "body": "\n\tReliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited has acquired a 50.1% stake in Sikhya Entertainment, the Indian production house behind Academy Award-winning documentaries “Period. End of Sentence.” and “The Elephant Whisperers.”\n\n\tThe deal unites Jio Studios, India’s largest film studio and the media arm of billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Limited, with the company co-founded by producers Guneet Monga Kapoor and Achin Jain. The partnership aims to develop films and series for loval and international audiences, combining Jio Studios’ distribution reach with Sikhya’s track record in globally resonant storytelling. Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited.\n\t\n\n\tSikhya Entertainment stands as the only Indian production house to have won both an Academy Award and multiple Indian National Film Awards. Beyond its Oscar victories for documentary shorts, the company’s Indian National Film Award-winning slate includes “Masaan,” “Soorarai Pottru” and “Kathal.” Its multilingual portfolio also features “The Lunchbox,” “Pagglait” and “Kill.”\n\n\n\tJio Studios has produced more than 150 films and series across Hindi and other Indian languages. The studio’s recent slate includes the “Stree” franchise and “Laapataa Ladies,” India’s official submission for the international feature Oscar.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ The studio’s “Dhurandhar,” starring Ranveer Singh, has become the highest-grossing Hindi-language film of all time in India.\n\t\n\n\t“Sikhya Entertainment has consistently delivered stories that are deeply Indian yet resonate globally. This association reflects our long-term belief in partnering with creators who combine creative excellence with cultural authenticity,” said Jyoti Deshpande, president of Jio Studios. “Over the last seven years, Jio Studios has built a strong track record of producing and championing some of the most successful box office winners and critically acclaimed films alike, from the most recent phenomenon ‘Dhurandhar’ to ‘Stree 2’ and ‘Laapataa Ladies’ which went all the way to the Oscars. I have known Guneet for a very long time and really admire her fire and tenacity. We are delighted to partner with Guneet, Achin and the Sikhya Entertainment team and by combining their distinctive storytelling legacy with Jio Studios’ scale, distribution, creative prowess and global ambition, we aim to give Indian stories the platform and pathways to reach audiences around the world.”\n\n\tMonga Kapoor and Jain said they have “always believed that stories have the power to connect people across cultures, geographies, and languages.” \n\n\t“At the heart of Sikhya’s work is a deep belief in storytelling and in the people who bring these stories to life,” they said in a joint statement. “Over the past decade, we have collaborated with bold new directors, writers, actors, and exceptional creative teams who continue to push the boundaries of independent cinema with honesty and ambition. For independent producers like us, driven by dreams and the audacity to turn those ideas into reality, this journey has been deeply rewarding.”\n\n\tThe producers said partnering with Jio Studios “allows us to take these stories to audiences around the world, while empowering us to champion emerging talent from across the country, where stories exist in every fabric and every thread.”\n\n\t“Jyoti Deshpande’s commitment to innovation and her instinct for bold ideas and creative risk make this partnership especially exciting,” they added. “Together, we celebrate a rising India, confident in its voice, unapologetic in its stories, and ready to shape the next chapter of cinema.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDuring his Monday night appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” Don Lemon recalled the moments leading up to his arrest.\n\n\tLemon said he was out in Los Angeles on Thursday night attending pre-Grammys parties before arriving back at his hotel, where he was arrested by federal agents.\n\n\t“I got back to the hotel. I had my swag bag from the [party], and I was walking up to the room,” Lemon recalled. “I pressed the elevator button and all of a sudden, I feel myself being jostled and people trying to grab me and put me in handcuffs. And I said, ‘What are you doing here?’ They said, ‘We came to arrest you.’ I said, ‘Who are you?’ Finally, they identified. I said, ‘If you are who you are, where’s the warrant?’ They didn’t have the warrant. So, they had to wait for someone outside, an FBI guy to come in, to show me a warrant on a cell phone.”\n\t\n\n\tEarlier in the interview, Lemon said he previously heard rumors that he might be taken into custody and offered to turn himself in. However, he claims his lawyer never heard back from Attorney General Pam Bondi or Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche about the offer.\n\n\n\tHost Jimmy Kimmel called the ordeal a “waste of resources.” Lemon agreed and said he thought the arrest was designed to send a message. \n\n\t“They want to embarrass you,” he added. “They want to instill fear. That’s why they did it that way.”\n\n\tFederal agents took Lemon into custody in Los Angeles on Jan. 29. Lemon’s arrest came after the Department of Justice sought to charge him with a civil rights violation for disrupting a religious service during a Minnesota ICE Protest. The former CNN host turned independent journalist claimed he was not participating as a protester, but was there as a reporter covering the demonstration, which he broadcast on his live stream.\n\t\n\n\tOn Friday, a judge released Lemon on his own recognizance. Speaking outside the downtown Los Angeles courthouse, Lemon said his arrest would not hamper his work in the press.\n\n\t“I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,” he said. “I will not stop ever. Last night, the DOJ sent a team of federal agents to arrest me in the middle of the night for something that I have been doing for the last 30 years, and that is covering the news. The First Amendment of the Constitution protects me and countless other journalists who do what I do. I stand with all of them, and I will not be silenced. I look forward to my day in court.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tChuck Negron, one of the three founding members of the rock group Three Dog Night and lead singer on some of their biggest hits, died Monday at age ",
    "body": "\n\tChuck Negron, one of the three founding members of the rock group Three Dog Night and lead singer on some of their biggest hits, died Monday at age 83. A statement from his publicist said Negron died peacefully at his home in Studio City, Calif., surrounded by family. \n\n\tNegron’s voice was heard as the lead vocalist on such hits as “Joy To The World (Jeremiah Was a Bullfrog),” “One (Is the Loneliest Number),” “Old Fashioned Love Song,” “The Show Must Go On” and “Easy To Be Hard.” \n\t\n\n\tAlthough no exact cause of death was given, a statement said that Negron struggled with heart failure in his final months, in addition to the chronic COPD he had dealt with for three decades.\n\n\n\tThree Dog Night was founded in 1967 by Negron, Danny Hutton and Cory Wells. The group struggled to find credibility with some rock audiences, who resisted the band for not writing its own songs as the singer/songwriter age took over. Yet they had 21 top 40 hits, many of them offering early shots to some of the top writers of the day. They recorded material by Nilsson, Randy Newman, Laura Nyro, Paul Williams, Neil Young, Robbie Robertson, Tim Hardin, Hoyt Axton and Leo Sayer, among others.\n\n\t“I like different songs for different reasons,” he told Rock Cellar. “I like ‘One’ because it was our first million-selling record, that one really put us in the game. It has a special place in my heart for other reasons too, it was done in one take, and at the time I was in awe of what came out of me, I couldn’t believe I’d done that. … I loved ‘Joy to the World’ because it became a signature song for us, and it’s still a hit to this day.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tThe group’s self-titled debut album came out on Dunhill in 1968 and went platinum. Wells sang most of the lead vocals on the first album, but, fatefully, the very first song on the very first LP, “One,” written by Nilsson, was sung by Negron. It went to No. 5 on the Hot 100.\n\n\tTheir following seven album releases, through 1974, all reached gold status. The group’s first No. 1 was “Mama Told Me Not to Come,” sung by Wells, in 1970, and the second was the Negron-sung “Joy to the World” in 1971.\n\n\tThe partnership fell apart in the mid-1970s, due in part to Negron’s well-documented and admitted struggles with drugs, including a heroin addiction that he finally kicked. The group disbanded between 1976-1981, then reunited from 1981-1985 before there was another fallout, this one more permanent. Hutton and Wells carried on under the Three Dog Night banner, and Hutton continues to tour behind it today, as the sole original member. Negron eked out a successful career as a solo artist on the oldies circuit for decades to come, until the pandemic put a halt to his touring.\n\n\tNegron estimated that at one point, he was spending $2,000-3,000 a day on drugs and spent millions of dollars on his habit over time. In 1991, Negron checked into rehab, later telling Rock Cellar of his time at CRI: “I wanted to cry help, and they took a spiritually and physically broken man, and they changed me with many tools and an unbelievable support group.” Later he did benefits for the rehab center, and would speak at hepatitis conventions to share his experiences with the condition.\n\n\tAn obituary provided by Negron’s representative said that although he and Hutton had been estranged for decades, they met up last year ” in a timely effort to exchange apologies and bury the hatchet.”\n\n\tIn a December interview Hutton did with Catalyst’s Bill DeYoung, he spoke of that meeting with Negron. “They’re making a documentary on us now, and the producer asked me… ‘Would you and Chuck ever get back together again?’ I just looked at her and said, ‘Absolutely not. No way.’ She said, ‘He would love to talk to you,’ and I said ‘Look, I don’t want to talk to him.’ A lot of hurt, all of that stuff. And then I finally said, all right, you know what? I’ll talk to him. So we went to his place – she had a whole crew there – and we hugged. And made up. It was wonderful. It was a great relief to get that burden … it’s not healthy to keep that anger. Anger always comes from hurt, I think.”\n\t\n\n\tThe third founding membrer, Wells, died in 2015 at age 74.\n\n\tNegron told Rock Cellar about the secrets of performing with COPD. “I reached a point where the COPD was going to prevent me from performing live; I could have literally died on stage,” he said. “But people aren’t going to pay to see someone singing with an oxygen mask on, so I had to do something or it was all going to be over. Luckily my girlfriend Amy stumbled across this pair of glasses that feed the oxygen from the tank, through the glasses, to the wearer. The cord has been modified to look like a guitar cable, so it’s more ‘rock ‘n’ roll.’ The audience can’t even tell. It changed my entire career.”\n\n\tNegron is survived by his wife, Ami Albea Negron; his children Shaunti Negron Levick, Berry Oakley, Charles Negron III, Charlotte Negron, and Annabelle Negron; his brother Rene (Jody) Negron, sister Denise (Janey) Negron; nine grandchildren, five nieces and two nephews, as well as his children’s mothers, Paula Servetti, Julia Negron, Robin Silna and Kate Vernon. \n",

    "body": "\n\tComedian Sherri Shepherd’s talk show “Sherri” is ending its run after four seasons, Variety has learned. News comes just as another daytime yakker, “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” also announced that it would wrap up at the end of 2026 after seven seasons. \n\n\tLionsgate’s producer/distributor shingle Debmar-Mercury confirmed the news Monday. “Sherri” had most recently been cleared through the 2025-2026 TV season on station groups like the Fox TV Stations, Nexstar, Hearst, Sinclair, Gray, Tegna and Sunbeam. Season 4 production will continue as planned, with the series airing its final episodes in the fall.\n\t\n\n\t“This decision is driven by the evolving daytime television landscape and does not reflect on the strength of the show, its production – which has found strong creative momentum this season – or the incredibly talented Sherri Shepherd,” Debmar-Mercury co-presidents Ira Bernstein and Mort Marcus said in a joint statement. “We believe in this show and in Sherri and intend to explore alternatives for it on other platforms.”\n\n\n\tLast season upon its pickup, Fox TV Stations exec vice president of programming Frank Cicha called the show “a linchpin of our daytime lineup.” \n\n\t“Sherri” tapes at New York’s Chelsea Studios and is both produced and distributed by Debmar-Mercury. \n\n\t“I don’t take it for granted that people welcome me into their homes daily,” Shepherd said last year when the show was renewed for a Season 4. “I work so hard to bring escapism to viewers’ lives through joy, laughter and inspiration, and I’m grateful that the audience has embraced what we do. I look forward to raising the bar and turning up the volume as we plan for our season four return.”\n\t\n\n\tThe former cohost of “The View,” actress, comedian and Emmy winner Shepherd first launched her own talk show in fall 2022. “Sherri” originally took over the time slots on the Fox stations that were previously occupied by “The Wendy Williams Show,” which Debmar-Mercury produced and distributed for 13 seasons.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Today” show host Savannah Guthrie released a statement to her Instagram on Monday night after her 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie, went missing in a suspected kidnapping.\n\n\t“We believe in prayer. We believe in voices raised in unison, in love, in hope. We believe in goodness. We believe in humanity. Above all, we believe in Him,” she wrote in the caption of her post. “Thank you for lifting your prayers with ours for our beloved mom, our dearest Nancy, a woman of deep conviction, a good and faithful servant. Raise your prayers with us and believe with us that she will be lifted by them in this very moment. We need you.”\n\t\n\n\tShe added, “’He will keep in perfect peace those whose hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord.’ A verse of Isaiah for all time for all of us. Bring her home.”\n\n\n\n\tNancy went missing in Arizona over the weekend and was last seen on the evening of Jan. 31 at her house in Catalina Foothills. She was classified by police as a “missing vulnerable adult” because of her age. She is 84 years old, 5 feet and 5 inches tall and approximately 150 pounds.\n\n\tOn Monday, local police in Arizona declared that Nancy’s disappearance was being treated as a crime. “We saw some things at the home that were concerning to us,” Sheriff Chris Nanos told reporters on Monday morning. “We believe now, after we process that crime scene, that we do in fact have a crime scene, that we do in fact have a crime, and we’re asking for the community’s help.”\n\n\tNanos added, “She is very limited in her mobility. We know she didn’t just walk out of there. That we know. There are other things at the site … that indicate … she did not leave on her own. We know that.”\n\t\n\n\tNanos said on Sunday night that Nancy had “no signs of cognitive issues” and is “very alert” and of “very sound mind.”\n\n\tSavannah was not behind the “Today” desk on Monday, but she gave the following statement for her co-hosts to read live on air: “On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers and messages of support. Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom. We thank law enforcement for their hard work on this case and encourage anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff’s office at 520-351-4900.”\n\n\tSavannah has brought Nancy onto “Today” several times throughout the years. In a Mother’s Day segment in 2023, the anchor honored her mom by saying, “When I was in my 30s, I really wished to be married and to be a mom, and things just did not happen that fast for me. And my mom’s confidence that I would be a mom — even as the years ticked by and ticked by and ticked by — meant so much to me. She said, ‘Of course you’ll be a mom, and you’re going to be a wonderful mom.’ And for her to have that confidence and faith was so meaningful to me. It got me through some really hard times.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBTS is mounting a big comeback with the announcement of both a livestreamed performance and a feature-length documentary, both airing on Netflix in partnership with Hybe.\n\n\tThe live performance, titled “BTS the Comeback Live | Arirang,” will stream on Netflix on March 21 at 4 a.m. PT / 7 a.m. ET. The concert will take place in Gwanghwamun in Seoul, just after the release of their new album “Arirang” on March 20. Hamish Hamilton, known for directing the majority of Super Bowl Halftime shows since 2010, is slated to direct the performance, which will be the first-ever live event broadcast from Korea to be livestreamed globally.\n\t\n\n\tThen, just a week later, the documentary “BTS: The Return” will debut on Netflix on March 27. The film, directed by Bao Nguyen (“The Greatest Night in Pop”), will chronicle the return of the group — consisting of RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, V, Jimin and Jung Kook — as they reunite in Los Angeles to make music following their hiatus. According to a press release, the film will portray them as they “create new music that reflects who they are now — culminating in what will become a landmark album of its time.”\n\n\n\t“Arirang” marks BTS’ first new album since 2022’s “Proof,” which was followed by the hiatus. The gap saw the individual members fulfilling mandatory military service in South Korea and recording a multitude of solo projects.\n\n\tJust last month, BTS announced its global tour for 2026 and 2027, with 79 performances slated for 34 markets. The tour will launch with three hometown concerts in Goyang, South Korea on April 9 and April 11-12, followed by extensive dates in Tokyo before heading over to North America.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNFL commissioner Roger Goodell reaffirmed his support for Super Bowl halftime performer Bad Bunny, telling reporters at a press conference on Monday that the Puerto Rican superstar proved he is “one of the great artists in the world” after his commanding presence at Sunday night’s Grammy Awards.\n\n\t“Listen, Bad Bunny is, and I think that was demonstrated last night, one of the great artists in the world. That’s one of the reasons we chose him,” Goodell said (via Yahoo Sports). “But the other reason is he understood the platform he was on, and that this platform is used to unite people and to be able to bring people together with their creativity, with their talent, and to be able to use this moment to do that. I think artists in the past have done that, I think Bad Bunny understands that, and I think he’ll have a great performance.”\n\t\n\n\tEver since Bad Bunny, an outspoken immigrants’ rights activist, was named the 2026 Super Bowl halftime performer, he has been the target of much conservative ridicule. After winning the Grammy for best música urbana album with “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS” on Sunday, he used his acceptance speech to uplift immigrant voices and condemn the actions of ICE.\n\n\n\t“Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ICE out,” he said. “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans. Also, I will say to people, I know it’s tough to know not to hate on these days and I was thinking sometimes, we get contaminados [contaminated], I don’t know how to say that in English. The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love.”\n\t\n\n\tBack in October of 2025, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said during an episode of Benny Johnson’s podcast that federal agents will be “all over” the Super Bowl with every intention to “enforce the law.” When asked about ICE presence at Sunday’s Super Bowl, Goodell said the NFL is working with “assets at the federal level, the state level and the local level” as standard practice dictates, but did not directly address whether ICE would be at the game.\n",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          A source familiar with the situation tells TMZ the global superstar is not engaged ... despite fans going into full detective mode after spotting a ring on that finger during the awards show.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The ring sparked speculation almost immediately online, with fans questioning whether BB had quietly proposed to a mystery lover after flashing the jewelry throughout the night. But according to our source, there’s no romantic milestone behind it.\n      \n\n          We’re told the ring was actually a gift from Cartier -- not an engagement ring, not a family heirloom, and not tied to any secret relationship. Bad Bunny simply chose to wear it to the Grammys -- where he won Album of the Year -- because ... well, it’s Bad Bunny, and statement jewelry is kind of his thing.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    CBS\n          \n    \n          And as for who he would be engaged to if it were true ... there isn’t anyone currently on the singer's roster. Our source says Bad Bunny isn’t dating anyone at the moment, making the engagement speculation completely out of nowhere.\n      \n    \n          Bottom line ... no wedding bells are currently ringing for BB as he heads to the headlines for the Super Bowl LX Halftime Show this weekend.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Bad Bunny\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Grammy Awards\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tSumerian Pictures has acquired North American rights to the Czech drama “Broken Voices,” setting plans for a theatrical release this year. Salaud Morisset is handling world sales. \n\n\tThe film won the Europa Cinemas Label for best European film at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, as well as the best film award at the Oldenburg Film Festival.\n\n\tIt is among the most nominated films at the upcoming Czech Lion Awards, to be awarded by the Czech Film and Television Academy. The film received 13 nominations including best feature, directing, screenplay, and several acting and craft categories, including a leading actress nomination for Kateřina Falbrová.\n\t\n\n\tThe film was a box office hit during its local release in Czech Republic and Slovakia, grossing over €1 million ($1.18 million) at the box office through distributor CinemArt.\n\n\n\tThe film is written and directed by Ondřej Provazník.\n\n\t“Broken Voices” takes place in a famous girls’ choir in the 1990s Czech Republic. Thirteen-year-old Karolína’s extraordinary voice brings the attention of an enigmatic and charismatic choirmaster. Being singled out feels like a triumph, until she begins to understand the price of that privilege. Inspired by the Bambini di Praga case, the film explores the line where innocence collides with abusive power.\n\n\tIsaac Feldberg of RogerEbert.com wrote “Of that first wave of competition films at Karlovy Vary, none have been so emotionally resonant or quietly lacerating as ‘Broken Voices,’ Ondřej Provazník’s exceptional, restrained account of power and silence in the elite concert section of a Czech girls’ choir. Sustaining a tense note of agony and despair so long it left me breathless, it skilfully depicts the blurred lines and queasy imbalances where abuse can fester within academic environments.”\n\t\n\n\tIn Variety‘s review, Peter Debruge said, “One might pick up on echoes of Sofia Coppola’s impressionistic style throughout — especially that of ‘The Beguiled,’ in which a lone man is surrounded by young women — as ‘Broken Voices’ emphasizes childhood memories that can last a lifetime: collecting exotic crystals, riding the subway, studying adult behavior from across the room.”\n\n\t“Broken Voices” has screened at over 50 international festivals, including Palm Springs, Vancouver, Rio, Warsaw and Marrakech, and will screen next at Tromsø, Trieste and Göteborg.\n\n\tRob Williams, president, content strategy for Sumerian Pictures negotiated the acquisition on behalf of Sumerian Pictures with Salaud Morisset Film Sales.\n\n\t“Broken Voices” joins a slate of upcoming theatrical releases from Sumerian Pictures that includes the romantic comedy “Mile End Kicks,” directed by Chandler Levack; “The Wolf, the Fox and the Leopard,” directed by David Verbeek; and “Horsegirls,” directed by Lauren Meyering. Sumerian Pictures recent releases include “Queen of the Ring,” directed by Ash Avildsen, and “Turnstile: Never Enough,” directed by Brendan Yates & Pat McCrory.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSippy Films, the Indian production house behind cultural touchstone “Sholay,” is restructuring as a character IP-led studio with backing from Kuberans Tech Ventures Private Limited. \n\n\tThe strategic investment, which closed at an undisclosed valuation, positions the studio to expand its library of legacy intellectual properties while developing new original projects. Kuberans is co-founded by Jeet Wagh.\n\n\n\tUnder the custodianship of Shehzad Sippy, the company is transforming its approach to managing properties including “Sholay,” “Seeta Aur Geeta,” and “Shaan” – titles that have maintained cultural relevance across generations and platforms. The restructuring aims to evolve these IPs thoughtfully across formats.\n\t\n\n\t“We are currently focused on developing new as well as select legacy IP in film and animation formats,” said Shehzad Sippy. “Kuberans’ commitment allows us to take a long-term and competitive approach in building Sippy Films into a leading character IP studio. Our goal is to build a sustainable studio model where our stories, characters, and worlds can evolve thoughtfully across formats and generations.”\n\n\tThe deal marks a significant institutional investment in a legacy Indian studio as the entertainment market shifts across platforms and formats. Kuberans Tech Ventures operates as a sector-agnostic investment firm with interests in media, technology and education. The firm also founded Ideabaaz, a national entrepreneurship platform backed by Z Network.\n\n\t“Coming from a media background, we deeply understand the long-term value and untapped potential of iconic intellectual property,” said Jeet Wagh, director at Kuberans Tech Ventures. “At a time when the entertainment market is evolving rapidly across platforms and formats, legacy IP, when approached with the right intent and structure, becomes even more powerful. At the same time, building new IPs alongside these legacies allows for a balanced and future-ready creative pipeline.”\n\t\n\n\tWagh added: “We are genuinely optimistic about what lies ahead for Sippy Films and believe this is the right moment to build with patience, purpose, and long-term conviction.”\n\n\tSippy Films represents one of India’s most storied production houses, with a catalog that includes multiple landmarks in Indian cinema history. The studio’s current transformation aims to establish a modern operational structure centered on character-driven intellectual properties.\n",

She has been classified as a “missing vulnerable adult” because of her age.\n\n\tNancy was last seen on the evening of Jan. 31 at her house near East Skyline Drive and North Campbell Avenue in Catalina Foothills, Arizona. Deputies say they aren’t sure what clothes she is wearing, but she is 5 feet 5 inches tall, weighs about 150 pounds and has brown hair and blue eyes.\n\t\n\n\tSavannah currently co-hosts “Today” alongside Craig Melvin, Al Roker, Carson Daly and Jenna Bush Hager. She has been on NBC News desk since 2007 as a legal analyst, and moved up to co-host “Today” in 2012.\n\n\tSavannah has spoken out on “Today” about how her mother has impacted her life.\n\n\t“When I was in my 30s, I really wished to be married and to be a mom, and things just did not happen that fast for me,” she said on the show. “And my mom’s confidence that I would be a mom — even as the years ticked by and ticked by and ticked by — meant so much to me. She said, ‘Of course you’ll be a mom, and you’re going to be a wonderful mom.’ And for her to have that confidence and faith was so meaningful to me. It got me through some really hard times.”\n\n\tWatch a video of Savannah and Nancy Guthrie together below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Trump took to Truth Social soon after the conclusion of the 2026 Grammys telecast to bash the awards show as “virtually unwatchable” and to slam host Trevor Noah as “a total loser” after he mocked Trump live on air for his friendship to Jeffrey Epstein. Noah made a joke that suggested Trump was a guest on Epstein’s island.\n\n\t“The Grammy Awards are the WORST, virtually unwatchable! CBS is lucky not to have this garbage litter their airwaves any longer,” Trump wrote. “The host, Trevor Noah, whoever he may be, is almost as bad as Jimmy Kimmel at the Low Ratings Academy Awards. Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island. WRONG!!! I can’t speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight’s false and defamatory, statement, have never been accused being there, not even by the Fake News Media.”\n\t\n\n\tTrump continued, “Noah, a total loser, better get his facts straight, and get them straight fast. It looks like I’ll be sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of an M.C., and suing him for plenty. Ask Little George Slopadopolus, and others, how that all worked out. Also ask CBS! Get ready Noah, I’m going to have some fun with you!”\n\n\n\tNoah brought up Trump and Epstein after Billie Eilish won Grammy for song of the year Grammy with her track “Wildflower.” Noah made a joke at Trump’s expense by saying: “There you have it, song of the year! Congratulations, Billie Eilish. Wow. That’s a Grammy that every artist wants — almost as much as Trump wants Greenland. Which makes sense because, since Epstein’s gone, he needs a new island to hang out with Bill Clinton.”\n\t\n\n\tTrump directed the majority of his Grammys takedown at Noah, seemingly staying quiet for now on Bad Bunny’s historic victory. The singer’s hit album “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” is the first Spanish-language LP to win the album of the year Grammy. Bad Bunny took home the top Grammy just one week ahead of his Super Bowl Halftime Show, which Trump has already been critical of in interviews.\n\n\t“I’ve never heard of him,” Trump said on NewsMax’s “Greg Kelly Reports” last October after Bad Bunny was confirmed as the Super Bowl performer. “I don’t know who he is… I don’t know why they’re doing it. It’s crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment — I think it’s absolutely ridiculous.”\n\n\tRead Trump’s Grammys reaction in the Truth Social post below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” moved back to the top of the China box office for the Jan. 30–Feb. 1 frame, generating RMB 29.1 million ($4.1 million) and lifting its cumulative total to RMB4.45 billion ($627.3 million), according to consultancy Artisan Gateway.\n\n\tThe market remained muted in the run-up to the Lunar New Year holiday period, with the top five once again dominated by holdovers rather than fresh releases.\n\n\n\tTaopiaopiao’s “Busted Water Pipes” rose to second place with $3.1 million in its second weekend, bringing its cumulative gross to $9.5 million. Directed by Zhou Difei, the film follows veteran cop Yu Dahai (Eddie Peng) and his squad, whose spotless, crime-free record has left them so underutilized that they begin fabricating cases to look busy. When the police station’s main water pipe bursts, however, the team stumbles into a real operation: a crew of tomb raiders posing as plumbers.\n\t\n\n\tWarner Bros.’ release of Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 masterpiece “The Shining” debuted in third place, earning $2.5 million. $726,000 of the earnings came from Imax screens.\n\n\t“Return to Silent Hill” moved to fourth, adding $2.1 million for a $14.3 million cume.\n\n\tRounding out the top five, “The Fire Raven” added $2.1 million, pushing its total to $61.5 million. Directed and written by Sam Quah, the film stars Peng Yuchang, Alan Aruna and Chang Ning and follows the reopening of a long-dormant murder case that exposes a wider network of corruption and revenge.\n\n\tOverall, China’s box office totaled $23.6 million for the weekend. Year-to-date takings stand at $284.8 million, down 73.6% compared with the same period in 2025.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBad Bunny has made Grammys history as the first Spanish-language artist to win album of the year with his hit album “Debí Tirar Más Fotos.”\n\n\tHe beat Justin Bieber (“Swag”), Sabrina Carpenter (“Man’s Best Friend”), Clipse, Pusha T and Malice (“Let God Sort Em Out”), Kendrick Lamar (“GNX”), Leon Thomas (“Mutt”) and Tyler, the Creator (“Chromakopia”) in the category.\n\n\tBad Bunny was wiping away tears as he approached the stage to accept his award. After composing himself, he spoke in Spanish to thank God, the Recording Academy, his mother and everyone who worked on the album. \n\t\n\n\t“I want to dedicate this award to all the people that had to leave their homeland, their country, to follow their dreams,” he said in English.\n\n\n\tWhen the 2026 nominations were first announced late last year, Bad Bunny became the first Spanish-language artist to earn nods for best album, record and song in one year. He also won best música urbana album and best global music performance for “EoO” Sunday night, plus he was nominated for the new category of best album cover.\n\n\tThis is the latest milestone in Bad Bunny’s already impressive career. Three years ago, his album “Un Verano Sin Ti” became the first Spanish-language release to earn a Grammy nomination for album of the year, though he lost to Harry Styles’ “Harry’s House.” \n\n\tBad Bunny previously won three Grammys, two for best música úrban album (“Un Verano Sin Ti” in 2023 and “El Último Tour Del Mundo” in 2022) and one for best latin pop or urban album (“YHLQMDLG” in 2021). He’s received 16 nominations in his career so far.\n\t\n\n\tNext week, he’ll perform at the Super Bowl halftime show in his highly anticipated debut as headliner. He had previously appeared as a guest during Jennifer Lopez and Shakira’s 2020 performance. However, President Donald Trump and many of his conservative supporters criticized the NFL’s selection of Bad Bunny. Trump has said that he will not be in attendance of the game and threatened that ICE officials will be there. Last month, Bad Bunny released a teaser for his performance featuring dancers of various ethnicities, ages and styles and vowing that “the world will dance.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s not quite John Travolta’s “Adele Dazeem,” but Cher caused a bit of confusion at the Grammys when she announced “Luther Vandross” as the winner of record of the year, which went to Kendrick Lamar and SZA’s “Luther,” itself a tribute to the R&B singer who died in 2005.\n\n\tCher took a long pause before opening the envelope that contained the category’s winner, then laughed: “Oh! They told me it was going to be on the prompter.” When she revealed the victor, she saw the song title “Luther” and announced, “Oh, the Grammy goes to Luther Vandross” (although she pronounced it “Grandoss”). She then realized the error and corrected herself, saying, “No, Kendrick Lamar! The Grammy goes to Kendrick Lamar.”\n\t\n\n\tLamar was seen laughing as SZA hugged people on her way up to the stage. Accepting the award, the performers and producers made light of the gaffe by acknowledging the connection between their song and the famed singer it’s named after. “Luther,” the third single off of Lamar’s “GNX” album, samples Vandross and Cheryl Lynn’s cover of “If This World Were Mine,” written by Marvin Gaye.\n\n\n\t“First and foremost, let’s give a shout-out to the late, great Luther Vandross,” said Sounwave, one of the producers behind “Luther.”\n\n\t“To echo what he said, this is what music is about: Luther Vandross,” Lamar added. “This is special for me. I’ve got to take my time, because he’s one of my favorite artists of all time. They granted us the privilege to do our version of [‘If This World Were Mine’]. When we got that clearance, I promise you, we damn near all dropped a tear, because we know how much him and Cheryl Lynn poured into that record. Being able to put our vocals of it proves that we are somewhat worthy of being just as great as them individuals. They granted us that.”\n\t\n\n\tLamar added that Lynn and the Vandross estate had one contingency on clearing the sample: “They said ‘no cursing’ though. ‘You can’t curse on it.’ That was the only thing, right? And we said, you know what? We are going to do just that. No cursing, and we are going to make sure the song represents love.”\n\n\tHe capped off his speech with two words: “Luther forever.”\n\n\tSegueing into the next performance, Grammys host Trevor Noah acknowledged Cher’s funny moment, saying, “I love live television.” \n\n\tBefore Cher handed out the award, she gave an acceptance speech for her own lifetime achievement award. At first, she appeared to forget that she was also handing out the record of the year statuette. Cher left the stage after her remarks about her long career, only to be gently called back by host Noah.\n\n\t“Before you go, Cher, could I get you to announce the nominees? I could do it but it’s not the same. I don’t have the track record,” Noah said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt was a “spread the love” kind of Grammys, with hardly any sweeps to speak of, the closest obviously being Kendrick Lamar winning in five out of nine categories. His strength at the 2026 Grammys, primarily in the rap categories, plus a key score for record of the year, hardly counted as a surprise. Elsewhere, nearly every major star with multiple nominations had to settle for just one or two, so there weren’t too many truly harsh shutouts. It felt like an “a trophy for everyone!” kind of year…\n\t\n\n\tWell, almost everyone. Somewhat shockingly, Sabrina Carpenter, who came in with six nods, left empty-handed. Meanwhile, Lola Young, who is much admired but wasn’t expected to win anything, provided one of the big shocks of the night by beating four of today’s top superstars in a key pop category, which helped jolt awake everyone watching the nearly four-hour pre-telecast “premiere ceremony.”\n\n\n\tHere are a few of this year’s perceived snubs and surprises:\n\n\tSURPRISE: Bad Bunny goes where no Latin music has gone before at the Grammys. It doesn’t feel quite right calling Bad Bunny’s win in the climactic album of the year category a “surprise”… because we at Variety successfully predicted it. So, huzzah for us, but as we said at the time, we were going out on a big limb with that one. There were plenty of reasons to think it wouldn’t happen: The strength of the competition, including Kendrick Lamar and Lady Gaga, either of whom was predicted by plenty of soothsayers to take this category. More significantly to doubters, perhaps, a Spanish-language recording has never previously won in any of the top four categories. And Bad Bunny’s previous album wasn’t even nominated in the category, so it would’ve been easy to assume his support in the Academy was to shallow to push him to the top this time.\n\t\n\n\tBut one factor that made us believe “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” was in line for a historic win here was the fact that all of the Latin Grammy voters had recently been invited to vote for the standard Grammys — quite a quick fix for the genre’s perceived underrepresentation. Plus: the album was a very well-reviewed monster, just the way the Academy likes it. And if there was any slight inclination to stick it to Super Bowl halftime haters by giving the superstar an additional vote of confidence here, that just could have been the irresistible icing on the cake for some voters on the bubble about this one.\n\n\tSNUB: Sabrina Carpenter goes home with nothing but a lot of love for that “Manchild” production number. Some may say Carpenter came back too soon with a followup album after her breakout successes of the previous year. Yet it’s hard to see anything about her strategy there as a mistake, since “Manchild” was a legitimate monster, and so was her “Man’s Best Friend” album, by just about every measure other than 2026 Grammy wins. When it comes down to it, there was just too competition for all of this year’s multiply nominated pop superstars to win something, and Carpenter was left without a seat in the ceremony’s game of musical chairs. \n\n\tThere’s no shame in coming up short there when what viewers will remember most is the performance Carpenter gave near the top of the show, with a seeming cast of thousands joining her on an airport baggage claim set that looked big enough to extend halfway to LAX. Carpenter seldom fails in delivering a high-concept production number, and producers were surely pleased she got the show off to such an infectiously giddy start, even if she wasn’t compensated for it in gold.\n\n\tSURPRISE: Lola Young beats all the pop masters of the universe in a key category. Is there anyone whose predictions list or bingo card had Young winning best pop solo performance on it? When she was up against Carpenter, Gaga, Chappell Roan and Justin Bieber, any of whom tower over the British singer in stateside awareness? Yes, she is an artist to beat when it comes to her native U.K., and if critics voted, we would have made a case for her to have a fighting chance here. But it also seemed like the winds might have been prevailing against her when she dropped out of a recent tour — wisely deciding that her health was more pressing than keeping up her public momentum, let alone campaigning for a Grammy.\n\t\n\n\tHer album (“I’m Only F**king Myself”) is wonderful, and “Messy” was a significant streaming hit, but Young is not for everyone. So count this left-field choice as a happy one, even if she wasn’t your rooting interest here — she’s the kind of wild card that makes Grammy-watching fun. And in lieu of best new artist, for which she was nominated (but always destined to fall to Olivia Dean), this provides a platform for discovery of a singer who has the potential to be around for decades, the sort of thing the Academy loves to have on its track record.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLola Young at the 68th GRAMMY Awards held at the Crypto.com Arena on February 01, 2026 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristopher Polk/Billboard\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSNUB: Justin Bieber’s track record of being underloved at the Grammys continues. Bieber has more cred than ever at this point, with a lot of critical and tastemaker support for his two “Swag” albums, which lean toward a more interesting lo-fi sound than the big productions he’s been known for. That was enough to get him four nominations for this year’s awards, but not a win. That’s in keeping with his overall Grammys history: 27 nominations and only two wins. \n\n\tIn truth, Bieber was not particularly favored in any of the major categories this year, despite those four marquee nods. There were just too many solid favorites up against him to imagine his comeback narrative after four years out of the limelight would be enough to let him overcome someone with as much currency at the moment as Kendrick or Bad Bunny. (The loss to Lola Young may sting a little more, as it did for all the other stars in that category.) Folks did enjoy his unexpected solo performance on the telecast — even if it was hard to tell from his off-stage demeanor whether he was unhappy to be there or just had a case of resting-Justin-face —  and the classic words suffice: He’ll be fine.\n\n\tSURPRISE: Billie Eilish is a force to be reckoned with, even commercially off-cycle. The Grammys love Eilish so much, we always have to consider her a possible winner any time she’s up at bat for anything… as we noted in calling her a dark horse in the song and record of the year categories. With that said, it seemed like it might not be Eilish’s year just because “Wildflower” is a late-looming remnant of an album that came out in 2024 and was in contention last year. But apparently voters don’t think “old news” is bad news when they love someone as much as they do Billie and Finneas. She’s one of those rare return nominees who has appeal to twentysomething and seventysomething voters alike — a pop classicist at heart who also has a winningly brash surface. \n\t\n\n\tPlus, a hit is a hit, and “Wildflower” was a huge one, even if it bloomed in the shadow of the even bigger “Birds of a Feather.” Speaking of which… why did “Birds” not pick up anything last year? Maybe that “snub” for one of the great songs of the past few years put a little wind in the sails of her supporters to enact justice this time.\n\n\tSNUB: K-pop (mostly). “Golden” had to settle for the silver. The smash hit from “KPop Demon Hunters” did not get ignored altogether: It won, inevitably, for best song written for visual media, and with that, it became the first K-pop recording ever to win a Grammy. It fell short for song of the year (losing to Eilish) and pop duo/group performance (to Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande’s big “Wicked” song), the other spots where it had a chance. But the real snub was felt back at the nominations level, when it didn’t pick up a nomination for record of the year. \n\n\t“APT.”  by Rosé and Bruno Mars also came up empty, despite multiple nods. It was a huge song, obviously, but not one that was favored in the prognosticating. Rosé was a first-timer, but Mars has a huge history with the Grammys — who may have just felt the need to let the fields lay a little bit fallow between the gigantic-ness of “Die With a Smile” and his forthcoming album probably being a big force at next year’s Grammys. But do Recording Academy voters just still have a thing about honoring K-pop artists, even in collaboration with their A-list favorites? Can’t rule it out.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSZA did not mince her words when addressing attacks on immigrants in the United States, while urging unity in the face of despair.\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety after winning record of the year for “Luther” at the Grammys, SZA said it felt “bizarre” to celebrate awards while the world feels increasingly unmoored.\n\n\t“It’s incredibly dystopian that we’re dressed up and able to celebrate accolades when people are getting snatched up and shot in the face on the street,” SZA told Variety backstage at the Grammys. “It just feels bizarre, and I find so many of us don’t really know how to feel right now, besides rage and hopelessness — and I don’t feel like that’s the emotional card I want to subscribe to.”\n\t\n\n\tSZA went on to say she believes “entropy can bring change,” and emphasized the “great possibility” that can emerge from moments of chaos. Her comments came after an evening filled with statements opposing Immigration and Customs Enforcement and defending immigrant communities. Bad Bunny and Billie Eilish were among the artists who directly called out the government agency’s actions while accepting awards.\n\n\t“This is a time when we can dig deep as a community and really learn that, OK, it’s not time to count on anyone else but us and our neighbors,” SZA said. “To protect ourselves, to rally for each other, to be that morale booster, to disseminate mutual aid, to take care of each other. And I just feel like — yay, that’s an amazing opportunity. Boo that this is even happening.”\n\n\tShe continued: “It’s always ‘Fuck ICE,’ but I just don’t want everyone to fall into despair. Because when you lose morale, change becomes impossible. And that’s just not true. I will not be going quietly into the dying of the light. I encourage everyone to do the same.”\n\t\n\n\tBack in December, SZA criticized the White House after a song she wrote for “Saturday Night Live” was used in an ICE deportation ad.\n\n\t“White House rage-baiting artists for free promo is PEAK DARK — inhumanity plus shock-and-awe tactics,” she wrote at the time. “Evil and boring.”\n\n\tSZA entered Sunday night with five nominations, most tied to her collaborations with Kendrick Lamar, including “30 for 30.” In addition to record of the year, Lamar and SZA also won best melodic rap performance for “Luther.” She was further nominated for best traditional R&B performance for “Crybaby,” from “Lana: SOS Deluxe.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrankie Muniz is getting candid about returning to the small screen for the four-episode “Malcolm in the Middle” reboot “Life’s Still Unfair,” describing the experience as the first in his entire life that he was “happy to call myself an actor.” \n\n\t“I’ve always been like, ‘Oh yeah, I act but I also do these other things too,’” the “Agent Cody Banks” star said in an interview with People. “It was just really fun and a really cool experience, so I’m hoping that everyone loves it for sure.” \n\t\n\n\tMuniz starred in the original 2000 sitcom as the titular boy-genius Malcolm Wilkerson alongside Bryan Cranston (Hal Wilkerson) and Jane Kaczmarek (Lois Wilkerson). The show ran for 151 episodes across seven seasons until 2006.\n\n\n\tWhile Muniz reflected fondly on the experience, he admitted he was unsure of what the dynamic would be on set 20 years later. \n\n\t“I was a kid,” Muniz said. “I was like 13 to 20 when I was on the show and I just kind of showed up and was excited to be there and said the words that were on the paper and it worked. As an adult, you tend to overthink things … and you put more pressure on yourself as well. So I didn’t know what it was gonna be like — if it was going to be easy to be Malcolm, if it was gonna be awkward back with the cast.”  \n\n\tQuickly, though, Muniz’s fears were dissuaded. “Not to sound like cliché, but it was as if not a single day went by,” he continued. “All of us — every single person — like instantly fell back into their characters with, I’m talking the first table read.” \n\t\n\n\tThe “Big Fat Liar” star added that filming for the upcoming reboot was “probably one of the best times I’ve ever had on a set,” largely because of the alleviated pressure that came with working on a project he knew fans would appreciate. \n\n\t“Twenty years ago, you film the first season, no one’s ever seen it, you don’t know if they’re gonna like it, you don’t know how people are gonna react to it,” Muniz said. “And then to have your seven years of success with it and now 20 years later, I can go anywhere in the world and people know Malcolm, right? They know the show, they love the show. They tell me how much it affected their lives and how much it meant to their families, how it brought them closer together.”\n\n\tAudiences can expect to stream “Malcolm in the Middle: Life’s Still Unfair” on Hulu and Hulu on Disney+ in 2026.

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains details about Episode 4 of “Heated Rivalry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tWhen Connor Storrie was filming his self-tape for “Heated Rivalry,” he decided he had to show off his body.\n\n\t“I was like, ‘If we’re doing a show that heavily involves sex,’” he tells me via Zoom video from his Los Angeles-area home. “So I took off my shirt, even though it didn’t say that. I had my shirt off the entire time because I was like, ‘If we’re doing that, you all have to see what these people look like naked.’”\n\t\n\n\tIt worked.\n\n\tStorrie landed the part of Ilya Rozanov, a Russian hockey star having a hot and steamy years-long off-rink affair with his Canadian counterpart, Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams). When the first two episodes dropped over Thanksgiving weekend on HBO Max — the streamer acquired the series from Canadian streamer Crave — the show became an instant hit with word of the soapy queer drama exploding on social media. Memes and GIFS zeroed in on the romance, the sports and, more often than not, the sex. “I didn’t even know that my butt was a topic of conversation until I had so many random people sending me screenshots of my ass on Twitter,” the 25-year-old actor says.\n\n\tStorrie, who grew up in Odessa, Texas, was just another actor living paycheck to paycheck when he booked “Heated Rivalry.” In fact, he was on the verge of losing his waitering job at Laurel Grill in Los Angeles’ Culver City neighborhood when the offer to play Ilya came in. “I did a fucking bad job. I dropped the ball, so I got another bad review,” Storrie recalls. “My boss sat me down, being like, ‘This is not acceptable. This is a final warning. If anything like this ever happens again, you’re out.’”\n\t\n\n\tMinutes later, with the written warning in his hand, Storrie looked at his phone. His agent had called to tell him that he got “Heated Rivalry.” “I worked a few more shifts and then was like, ‘See you!’” Storrie says.\n\n\tCan you wrap your mind around what’s happening?\n\n\tIt doesn’t feel real. Also, I’m coming off my directorial debut. I just wrapped production on my first feature that I directed. I did that for two months, right before going into press for this, so I’m like, “I feel so out of the loop.” I literally wasn’t online for two months.\n\n\tTell me about this feature.\n\n\tIt’s an iPhone feature. We did it super, super-duper indie, very reminiscent of my favorite filmmaker’s first films, like a Darren Aronofsky or an old school John Waters thing, where it’s pretty much just me, 10 close actors that I know just running around being crazy. Shot on the new iPhone, so it is in 4K. iPhones have come a long way.\n\n\tWhat’s it about?\n\n\tIt’s super bleak, but funny and brutal. It’s about this alien spirit that incarnates into a human body, wakes up as a full-blown adult and just gets fucked over for an hour and a half [by] the brutality of life, violence, being robbed, being stolen, being abused, being all of it, and then finding companionship through that.\n\n\tAre you the alien?\n\n\tI am not. Well, actually, I play the alien before he incarnates into a human body, but you can’t even tell it’s me.\n\n\tWas “Heated Rivalry” shot chronologically? Was your first sex scene when Ilya and Shane first hooked up?\n\n\tThe first sex scene that we did was in Episode 2, the Vegas hotel room. I dragged the chair, I watch him, he puts on a show for me, and then it gets more aggressive.\n\n\tYou worked a lot with an intimacy coordinator, but what was going through your mind before shooting that first scene?\n\n\tI was less exposed than Hudson was, right? I’m fully clothed. I’m bossing him around. He takes his underwear off. What was I thinking? Let me actually think about that. I just remember, for 90% of that scene, the camera is on my face. I, as a person, move a lot, and so it takes me some energy sometimes to chill out and not move. In my mind, I’m like, “Don’t move, feed into the sexy tension of it all.” Then once we get to the actual sex, to be honest with you, I know it’s not very glamorous, but a lot of those sexual scenes, it’s about making sure that you move in a way that we don’t see our cock socks. It’s literally like, “My hand is going to be here. Your leg is going to be here. I’m going to hide myself with this.” And then it’s a constant game of like, “Oh, right. Yep, that’s great.” “No, no. OK, now, we see it.” “Oh, yep, no, no, that’s great. OK, keep going.” It’s a lot of that.\n\t\n\n\tIn Episode 4, we see Ilya actually has feelings for Shane. He’s getting jealous of Shane’s girlfriend.\n\n\tOh, just you wait. Episodes 5 and 6, baby! It’s really good.\n\n\tDid you have to drink a lot of water before Ilya had to spit into Shane’s hand in Episode 4?\n\n\tEveryone was drinking City Seltzers. I don’t know if they sponsored our show, but we were all addicted to those things. So, when I say we were hydrated, we were hydrated on that set. I forgot that I spit in his hand until I saw it two days ago, and I was like, “Damn, we went there, huh?” We need to bring that back for Season 2. Bring the spit back.\n\n\tEarlier today, it was announced that “Heated Rivalry” is getting a second season. The show is based on Rachel Reid’s book series, but things can change in adaptations. Do you have any idea where they’re going to go in Season 2?\n\n\tI have no idea. With how true we stayed to the book for this one, I can assume it’s going to be equally as true. Rachel Reid is now a New York Times bestselling author. Those books are literally sold out everywhere. They’re number one on some of the book charts, which is crazy. I think that proves that these are obviously really well-constructed stories that a lot of people are really into. The only way to make this make sense is to stick to the books and also honor the fandom of the people who are really spearheading this whole thing.\n\n\tWhat did you tell friends and family about the show back in Odessa?\n\n\tMy mom has watched it. I was like, “There’s a lot of sex. We got picked up by HBO.” You know how sexy something is if it’s on HBO. She was like, “Oh, OK. How do you feel about that?” And I was like, “I feel good. How do you feel about that?” She’s like, “If you feel good, I feel good.” Obviously, she can’t watch the sex scenes. She was like, “I can’t watch the sex scenes yet,” and I was like, “You don’t ever have to watch the sex scenes, mom. I don’t need you to watch that.” Hudson’s mom, too. We were at the premiere, and I was like, “So, what did you think seeing it on the big screen?” And she was like, “Oh, I had to cover my eyes for most of it,” and I’m like, “Yeah, that makes sense.” That must be weird, huh?\n\n\tYou tell me.\n\n\tThe sex, specifically it doesn’t feel very spicy to me because I was there in-person doing it. I have to watch the episodes two times in order to really get into the story, because my brain the entire time is like, “Wait, I remember the day that we shot that. Right before this, we did that. Wait, what episode is that? Oh, that’s next episode. Oh.” I’m just remembering the plot more so than anything. I’m not a good judge of this show.\n\t\n\n\tIs all this attention overwhelming? Do you even know how to navigate all of this?\n\n\tMy MO is to just stay focused on my creativity…It’s so easy nowadays to get lost in the internet sauce. I obviously want to and need to engage and be a part of the cultural zeitgeist and take what people are saying, review everything, but I can’t get lost in the comments, the tweets. I didn’t even know that my butt was a topic of conversation until I had so many random people send screenshots of my ass on Twitter. I’m like, “Oh, wow, I didn’t realize it got that specific.” I knew that the sex would be a moment of intrigue for people, but I’m like, “Damn, I didn’t realize it was going to be GIFs, and screenshots, and wallpapers, and stickers, and 30,000 tweets.”\n\n\tWhat’s the pressure now to keep in shape?\n\n\tI know, right? Luckily, I have put in a lot of work over the years. I also love working out. Working out is just time. We hear about these celebrity transformations where it’s like, “This guy gained 20 pounds of hard muscle in six weeks for this thing.” Real fitness is four or five times a week, getting to the gym every single week for years, and slowly building up a solid body position. So, luckily, now, I can coast. I’ve only worked out twice in the past two months, and my physique is OK.\n\n\tHow many pushups do you do before each shirtless scene?\n\n\tI don’t do pushups. I do curls because my chest is — here we go, I sound so narcissistic — is naturally rounded, so I don’t have to try that hard. I’m more so arm-focused because my arms are my weak point. So I’ll take a chair and just do [bicep curls] 40 times, or shoulders. Shoulders are big. Shoulders are a big deal.\n\n\tHow much adlibbing and improv are going on during the sex scenes, or is it very by the book?\n\n\tEverything is scripted. Yeah, there are some oohs and ohs that we put in there. The things that aren’t fully scripted are some of our touches, some of our body kisses and stuff, and that just came down to establishing a bunch of boundaries beforehand. There are levels to everything, right? Where are you allowed to be touched? What type of kisses are you allowed to do? And what do you wear to give you proper protection in any moment, depending on the act? There’s a closed-mouth kiss. There’s an open-mouth kiss. There’s an open-mouth kiss with tongue. There’s a hardcore open-mouth, prolonged kiss with tongue. You can wear pants. You can wear shorts. You can wear a G-string. You can wear layers. You can wear bike shorts that have padding. You can wear neoprene. There are levels to it. Hudson and I, separately, we’re just like, “I’m not weird about that. I’m not squeamish.” I trust him. I also feel confident enough in the production to voice anything if I ever feel uncomfortable, so I’m like, “So, let’s go all the way. I’ll wear the least amount of clothes. I’ll do the most amount of kisses.” It literally just made me and Hudson be like, “Is it cool if I touch you here?” And I’m like, “Yeah, touch me anywhere. I don’t care.” So all those little intricate kisses, touches in between moments, a lot of that is just us organically feeding into that moment.\n\t\n\n\tYou guys have really become best friends.\n\n\tHe was just here for a week and stayed at my place. It’s really enlightening about the culture of how men and man-on-man affection is received because you don’t see that a lot. It’s taboo for men to be friends and grab each other a certain way or hold hands. And me and Hudson being in such a sexual circumstance with one another, it’s really interesting to watch people sexualize our very amicable signs of affection. That just shows where the culture is still at in a way like, “Oh, these two men…” Just because we’re really comfortable with each other and we love each other, we’ve been through the craziest experience together, we’re on this crazy rollercoaster together, if I have my hand on his leg as we’re sitting down doing a press thing because he’s my best buddy and I love him, and we have that level of comfort. It’s just interesting that that instantly gets turned into, “They’re more than friends.”\n\n\tI did not see anything like this on TV when I was growing up. I know there’s the sex and obviously, the show isn’t for all ages, but I think about that young man or woman out there who is coming to terms with their sexuality, battling with their sexuality. To see the two of you, whether it’s on-screen or off-screen, I’m just going to say it, that kind of stuff saves lives. It really does. Do you feel that? Have you been feeling that from young people?\n\n\tIt’s so easy to have these conversations about, “It is important for gay people to see this.” That’s such a big concept that we can logically be like, “Yeah, that’s important for this, this, this, and this reason.” But when you get really cellular like that, and I look someone in the eyes and someone says that, or there were meet and greets when we were in Toronto, where a lot of people are just excited about the show because they love these characters and stuff, but then every 1 out of 100 people would come up and were shaking with, “This is important to me. I see myself in this person” — it’s making me emotional [Storrie tears up] – “and being able to read this or see this makes my existence a little less painful.” It’s cool because I’ve gotten that opinion from multiple people, not just gay men, but transgender men, bisexual women. There are so many different people that identify with that sense of otherness. It’s really inspiring. I didn’t really get the magnitude of what that meant until looking someone face-to-face and them being like, “This is important to me. Thank you for bringing something to light.”\n\t\n\n\tI can’t wait for next Halloween in West Hollywood.\n\n\tOh God, I didn’t even think of that.\n\n\tNo one’s mentioned that to you?\n\n\tBro, people are going to dress up as us?\n\n\tIt’s going to be sexy hockey players everywhere.\n\n\tThat’s crazy. I never thought of that. One of my close friends, Sean, said, “That’s how you know something is of cultural significance is if people Halloween-ized.” This year’s “Weapons” was everywhere with Aunt Gladys. People are going to put my fucking mole on their face? Whoa, you just blew my mind. I did not think about that.\n\n\tHudson recently put it out there that he would love to play Nightwing in the DC universe. Which superhero are you going after?\n\n\tI want to be a supervillain, a new supervillain. I was already a part of the Joker. [Storrie played the unnamed asylum patient who fatally stabs Arthur Fleck in Joker: Folie à Deux]. I want to be bald. Remember that Christian Bale character [Gorr the God Butcher] in that “Thor” movie where he was completely painted gray, and he had black teeth, and he was bald? Give me something weird like that.\n\n\tYou want the weird stuff?\n\n\tAs an actor, playing dress-up is my favorite thing in the entire planet, and that’s what this is to me. This is just an exaggerated, prolonged playing dress-up. Putting on the accent, getting the haircut, wearing the necklace, having the hockey gear, it’s all play pretend and dress-up. So yeah, I want to play the devil or something.\n\n\tThis Q&A was edited for length and clarity.\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tSelected by Tajikistan but ultimately not accepted by the Academy to compete in the Oscar international feature category, “Black Rabbit, White Rabbi",
    "body": "\n\tSelected by Tajikistan but ultimately not accepted by the Academy to compete in the Oscar international feature category, “Black Rabbit, White Rabbit” begins ambitiously, with a famous quote from playwright Anton Chekhov about setups and payoffs — about how if a gun is established in a story, it must go off. Moments later, an inviting long take involving a young man selling an antique rifle ends in farcical tragedy, signaling an equally farcical series of events that grow stranger and stranger. The film, by Iranian director Shahram Mokri, folds in on itself in intriguing (albeit protracted) ways, warping its meta-fictional boundaries until they supersede its characters, or any underlying meaning.\n\t\n\n\tStill, it’s a not-altogether-uninteresting exercise in exploring the contours of storytelling, told through numerous thematically interconnected vignettes. The opening Chekhov quote, though it might draw one’s attention to minor details that end up insignificant, ensures a heightened awareness of the movie’s artifice, until the film eventually pulls back and becomes a tale of its own making. But en route to this semi-successful postmodern flourish, its character drama is enticing enough on its own, with hints of magical realism. It begins with the tale of a badly injured upper-class woman, Sara (Hasti Mohammai), discovering that her car accident has left her with the ability to communicate with household objects.\n\n\n\tSara’s bandages need changing, and the stench of her ointment becomes a quick window into her relationships. Her distant husband rejects her; her boisterous stepdaughter is more frank, but ultimately accepting; her gardener and handyman stays as diplomatic as he can. However, the film soon turns the gunfire payoff in its prologue into a broader setup of its own, as a delivery man shows up at Sara’s gate, insisting that she accept delivery for an object “the deceased man” has paid for.\n\t\n\n\tMokri eventually returns to this story (through a slightly tilt-shifted lens), but not before swerving headfirst into a seemingly unrelated saga of extras on a film set and a superstitious prop master, Babak (Babak Karimi), working on a shot-for-shot remake of an Iranian classic. A mix of rapid-fire Tajik, Persian and Russian dialogue creates dilemma upon dilemma when Babak’s ID goes missing, preventing him from being able to thoroughly check the prop ammunition for an assassination scene. \n\n\tDanger begins to loom — a recent Alec Baldwin case even warrants a mention on-screen — as the notion of faulty firearms yanks Chekhov’s wisdom front and center once more, transforming it from a writing tip into a phantasmagorical inevitability. In keeping with the previous story, the props even communicate with each other (through subtitles) and begin gossiping about what might come to pass.\n\n\tAfter establishing these narrative parameters through unbroken, fluid shots filmed at a sardonic distance, Mokri soon begins playing mischievous temporal games. He finds worthwhile excuses to revisit scenes from either different angles or with a slightly altered aesthetic approach — with more proximity and intimacy — in order to highlight new elements of his mise-en-scène. What’s “real” and “fictional,” even within the movie’s visual parlance, begins to blur in surreal ways, largely pivoting around Babak simply trying to do his job. However, the more this tale engorges through melodic, snaking takes, the more it circles around a central point, rather than approaching it.\n\n\tThe film’s own expanse becomes philosophically limiting, even though it remains an object of curiosity. When it’s all said and done, the playfulness on display in “Black Rabbit, White Rabbit” is quite remarkable, even if the story’s contorting framework seldom amounts to much, beyond drawing attention to itself. It’s cinema about cinema in a manner that, on one hand, lives on the surface, but on the other hand, invites you to explore its texture in ways few other movies do.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPeter Greene, a New York character actor who often played villains and criminals including Zed in Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction,” was found dead in his New York apartment on Friday. He was 60.\n\n\tHis manager Gregg Edwards told NBC News he was found in his apartment on the Lower East Side. \n\n\tIn the Jim Carrey movie “The Mask” the same year, Greene played the villain Dorian Tyrell. \n\n\n\tHis role as the sadistic security guard Zed in “Pulp Fiction” became one of his most memorable. Zed was one of the three “psycho hillbillies” that rape Marsellus in Maynard’s shop’s basement, and their characters were an homage to the film “Deliverance,” the Daily Beast explained.\n\t\n\n\t“Nobody played a bad guy better than Peter,” Edwards told NBC. “But he also had, you know, a gentle side that most people never saw, and a heart as big as gold.”\n\n\tBorn in Montclair, N.J., Greene trained at Lee Strasberg’s studio and had his first major role in the indie “Laws of Gravity” in 1992. The next year, Lodge Kerrigan cast his as the lead in “Clean Shaven,” which brought him to Tarantino’s attention.\n\n\tHe went on to appear in nearly 100 films and TV shows, including a recurring role on the series “For Life,” and appearances in “Chicago P.D.,” “Hawaii Five-O,” “Justified” and “Life on Mars.”\n\n\tOn “The Black Donnellys,” he had a recurring role as Derek “Dokey” Farrell.\n\n\tHis film roles included parts in “Tesla,” “City of Lies,” “Once Fallen” and “Permanent Midnight.”\n\n\tHe also worked as a producer on the films “Cross” and “Lowball.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile “Zootopia 2” and “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” claw for the No. 1 spot at the North American box office this weekend, James L. Brooks’ political dramedy “Ella McCay” must settle for scraps.\n\n\t“Zootopia 2” took the top spot, grossing $6.2 million in its third Friday at the domestic box office, about a 40% decline from the same time last week. The animated sequel is expected to gross $26 million by Sunday. “Zootopia 2” crossed $1 billion globally on Friday after just 17 days in theaters. It is the fastest PG film to ever reach the milestone and the third movie in 2025 to hit $1 billion (“Lilo & Stitch” grossed $1.03 billion and China’s “Ne Zha 2” earned a staggering $1.9 billion).\n\t\n\n\tSecond place went to “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” which earned $5.6 million in its second Friday in North American cinemas, marking a sharp 81% decline from last week’s debut. The film is expected to gross $20 million domestically during its sophomore outing, following a stellar $64 million opening last weekend.\n\n\n\tNewcomer “Ella McCay” grossed just $850,000 on its opening day in 2,500 North American Theaters, which puts the film well below projections of $4 million by Sunday. James L. Brooks, “The Simpsons” co-creator and Oscar-winning director of “Terms of Endearment” and “As Good as It Gets,” helmed the film and wrote the script. “Ella McCay” follows an up-and-coming politician (Emma Mackey) who struggles to find a work-life balance after being elected governor. The film carries a $35 million price tag.\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” took third place on Friday with $2.2 million domestic. The film looks to gross $8.3 million by Sunday for a North American tally of $311 million.\n\t\n\n\tFourth place this week went to “Dhurandhar,” an Indian Hindi-language spy thriller from B62 Studios. This film grossed an estimated $930,000 on Friday and is expected to gross $3.2 million by Sunday.  Fifth place went to “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” the third chapter in Lionsgate’s magical heist saga. The film pulled in $720,000 on Friday and looks to gross $2.4 million by Sunday for a domestic tally of $59.4 million.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWWE star Gunther will have the honor of facing John Cena in the final match of the latter’s career on Saturday, but the hard hitting Austrian is letting fans know now not to get their hopes for Cena up too high. \n\n\t“It’s going to be a great day where everybody’s going to tune in and show up and bring all the love for John Cena,” Gunther told Variety ahead of the match. “But at the end, they’re going to get their hearts broken. So I’m looking forward to that.”\n\t\n\n\tCena has been on his retirement tour since the start of 2025, with his final match set to take place during this week’s “Saturday Night’s Main Event” on Peacock originating from the Capitol One Arena in Washington, DC. \n\n\n\tGunther emerged as the victor of the Last Time Is Now Tournament to determine who would be Cena’s final opponent. In his quest to become that opponent, he had to fight his way through WWE stars like Je’Von Evans, Carmelo Hayes, Solo Sikoa, and LA Knight. When asked which of those matches he enjoyed the most, Gunther settles on Sikoa.\n\n\t“I like a good heavyweight match,” he said. “I’m not sure if Solo was in a situation like that many times, like a really long singles match. And he performed very good as well.”\n\n\tInterestingly, this will not be the first major retirement match on a “Saturday Night’s Main Event” Gunther has taken part in this year. He previously faced WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg in his retirement match back in July. But Gunther said the pressure of taking part in such high-profile moments does not phase him in the least.\n\n\t“I know what I can do, and I know I can rely on that,” he said. “It’s never negative pressure. It’s always very positive pressure.” \n\t\n\n\tDuring an appearance on “Monday Night Raw” earlier in the week, Gunther also promised that he would not only beat Cena, but that he would beat him by submission. “He has been beaten before many times,” Gunther said. “He had a long career, it’s normal. But he hasn’t been submitted in what, over 20 years? So I think that spices the whole thing up a little bit.” \n\n\t“Saturday Night’s Main Event” airs live on Peacock at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on Dec. 13. \n",

    "body": "\n\tZaur Gasimli’s “Taghiyev: Oil” is the first film in a potential tetralogy, so it should come as no surprise that it plays like an extended first act. Azerbaijan’s 2026 Oscar entry, about philanthropist, oil magnate and “father of the nation” Zeynalabdin Taghiyev, is resplendent in its conception as a period biopic with the scale of mid-century Hollywood epic. However, its reverence for its subject overshadows most hints of human drama, yielding a work that skirts around critical examination and seldom manages to present Taghiyev with feet of clay.\n\t\n\n\tThe film is framed between two distinct moments of societal and economic transformation. It begins in 1922, after the formation of the USSR, and introduces Taghiyev (Qurban Ismayilov) as a “former millionaire” — and a forgotten recluse turned bitter — through the eyes of fictitious American journalist Jerry Thompson (Vadim Stepanov). Thompson is merely passing through and collecting anecdotes, but he’s heard tell of Taghiyev’s legend, which the elderly tycoon soon narrates at length, beginning in the 1870s, before the country’s economic boom.\n\n\n\tTaghiyev is played, as a younger man, by Parviz Mamedrzaev, who crafts the role with prophetic kindness and occasional ferocity. Starving villagers reassemble in orderly fashion at his mere suggestion, as he offers a young girl extra helpings of grain. He’s admired by his peers and practically worshipped by the workers he conscripts into his burgeoning oil drilling business, though he’s also scorned by a local religious cleric who appears to warp the word of the Quran for murky reasons. Taghiyev is a holy man in the body of a modern capitalist, to the point that much of the movie’s drama surrounds his exploited workers bickering over whether they should demand to be paid fairly or simply trust that he’ll eventually strike liquid gold.\n\t\n\n\tAnd yet, the film approaches these dilemmas is nearly noncommittal fashion, refusing to take a stance on Taghiyev too soon (or at all) beyond his spiritual aura. In framing this figure of flesh and blood through such a mythological lens, it transforms his tale into one of faith — that of his children and his employees in him, and his own, in himself — as the question of his responsibility toward each person is approached with a feather-light touch. That this story is narrated by an older Taghiyev perhaps lends credence to a self-mythologizing, but the movie’s journalistic framework is seldom literal (the movie often features flashbacks scenes Taghiyev is not a part of, and could not have seen). Besides, even if “Taghiyev: Oil” were about a man creating his own legend, the only takeaway here might be that he wasn’t a particularly noteworthy storyteller.\n\n\tThese in-world mechanics are perhaps too narrow a way to examine a film such as this. Rather, Gasimli’s story is one of national self-identification; its version of Taghiyev is far more symbolic than human, practically urging its Azerbaijani audience to place their faith in the idea of national unity at any and all personal cost. The real Taghiyev remains revered for what one might call righteous reasons, but this fictitious version of him — who we largely meet before he made his fortune — is too abstract to deserve the same treatment, despite Mamedrzaev’s careful, clinical performance that attempts to find humanity where the film at large does not.\n\n\tThe period-appropriate details — and occasional bird’s eye view of infrastructure on the verge of blossoming — are a treat for the eye, as are the process-oriented scenes of oil drilling, which recall the muck and violence of “There Will Be Blood.” Gasimli’s camera is tightly controlled, and he finds just the right moments to rush towards the unexpected. However, the beauty of his frame is counterbalanced by the dullness of the tale at hand: that of a figure etched in stone, unmoving, carved as a tablet for other people’s thoughts, opinions and beliefs, rather than as a person with many of his own.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s not every day you get the chance to fly in a blimp — and definitely not the Insta-famous electric orange “Marty Supreme” aircraft.\n\n\tFull disclosure: Most of our colleagues thought we were crazy. “You’re going up in what?” or “You’re braver than I am” was a common refrain. “You wouldn’t catch me in a blimp,” another said more bluntly. The invitation was an immediate no-go for anyone claustrophobic or afraid of heights. Our thought: “But it must be safe, right? A24 can’t let a bunch of journalists become the story because they died in a blimp crash!” (We’re writing this, so obviously we survived to tell the tale.)\n\t\n\n\tWhen the time comes to board the airship, we’re the sixth ride out of seven scheduled for the day. (The film’s stars Tyler the Creator and Odessa A’Zion flew this route the day before.) We stand off to the side of the runway as the blimp descends from the sky, and the ground crew races forward to grab ropes that hang off the sides. It’s their job to hold the gargantuan object steady for the previous riders (another pair of journalists) to disembark and for us to climb in.\n\n\n\tThe cabin is roomier than you’d imagine, with two passenger seats behind the pilot’s chairs. We quickly buckle ourselves in, put on our headphones and before we know it — though we bet the crew’s biceps feel every passing second — it’s time for liftoff.\n\n\t“Welcome to the ‘Marty Supreme’ Experience!” our pilot, Caesar Mendez, exclaims as the crew lets go of the ropes and we begin our ascent.\n\n\tSoon, we’re floating 1,000 feet above the ground, listening in as Mendez gets updates from the air traffic control tower. Because we’re the slowest aircraft in the skies (the blimp’s cruising speed is around 25-30 mph), we have the right of way. This means that helicopters and airplanes taking off and landing at the Long Beach International Airport, as well as the Goodyear blimp that’s flying off to our right, have to keep an eye out for us. The “Marty Supreme” blimp is about half the size of the Goodyear balloon, which is moving about twice our speed. We all wave as it circles across our windshield a few minutes later.\n\t\n\n\tWhile we bob in the air, Mendez explains how the aircraft operates. He’s got wheels on the side of his seat that moderate the pitch of the blimp’s nose while his feet pedal against the rudders that control its movement left and right. “It feels like riding a bike for six hours,” the pilot says.\n\n\tMendez and his co-pilot made the 13-day journey from Nashville (where the company is headquartered) to California, flying over Memphis, Dallas, El Paso, Tucson, Phoenix, Palm Springs and a handful of smaller cities along the way. (The pilots swapped shifts as they flew about eight hours a day.)\n\n\tThe route we’re flying today is just a 30-minute loop from the Long Beach airfield to the coastline, where, down below, the docked Queen Mary cruise liner looks about the size of a large yacht. But the view is spectacular: perfectly blue skies with the sun shimmering over the water. It’s already time to turn back, though, so we head for the airfield.\n\n\tAs we begin our descent, there are no tray tables to put away or a reminder to fasten your seatbelt. It’s only then that Angelique realizes that there wasn’t really a safety demonstration; the emergency exit is the only exit — a door bolted next to Clayton’s left leg. Landing is a totally different experience from sitting on a passenger jet. Instead of the jolt of the landing gear crashing onto the runway, it’s jarring to watch a group of men run at you to catch the ropes and keep you from floating away again.\n\n\tOverall, the blimp ride was totally smooth sailing, if slightly uneventful. If you’re looking for an adrenaline rush, there’s plenty of frenetic energy on display in “Marty Supreme” itself, as star Timothée Chalamet and director Josh Safdie find a way to make ping pong feel like it’s life or death.\n\n\tBut why are they doing all this?\n\n\tThe Nickelodeon orange blimp emblazoned with the film’s title and tagline, “Dream Big,” has become an inescapable fixture in the Los Angeles skyline this awards season, a bold aerial gambit in what’s shaping up to be a very competitive Oscar race. A24’s unconventional marketing strategy — floating the advertisement for the Chalamet-led ping pong drama above the city for weeks and other offbeat stunts — has sparked conversations before most voters have even seen it (spoiler alert: There’s no blimp in the movie). The blimp has been spotted hovering over key industry events, from guild screenings to holiday parties, ensuring that “Marty Supreme” remains top of mind as ballots begin circulating.\n\t\n\n\tBut as the race tightens and contenders multiply, the blimp strategy reveals both its cleverness and its risks. With heavyweight films like “One Battle After Another,” “Sinners” and “Hamnet” dominating nominations and critical awards, mere visibility can’t be enough. The orange blimp has succeeded in making “Marty Supreme” the most talked-about FYC campaign of the season, yet the film still faces an uphill battle in securing nominations, especially as the last release of the year. But can it get there? It’s a question on which A24 is betting millions of dollars — and one very conspicuous airship — in the hopes it will pay off come nominations morning.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAbraham Quintanilla Jr., the patriarch who helped shape the career of his daughter, Tejano superstar Selena, and remained the steward of her legacy for three decades after her death, has died. He was 86.\n\n\tThe news was announced Saturday morning by his son, A.B. Quintanilla III, who shared a photo of his father on Instagram and wrote, “It’s with a heavy heart to let you guys know that my Dad passed away today.” A cause of death was not immediately disclosed.\n\t\n\n\tBorn Feb. 22, 1939, in Corpus Christi, Texas, Quintanilla was raised in a Mexican American family and began his own music career as a teenager. In 1956, he joined the vocal group the Dinos, gaining early experience as a singer and songwriter before leaving the band in the late 1960s to focus on raising a family.\n\n\n\tThat decision would ultimately redirect the course of Latin music history. After recognizing the vocal talent of his youngest child, Selena Quintanilla-Pérez, Abraham formed Selena y Los Dinos, a family band that also included siblings A.B. and Suzette Quintanilla. Serving as manager and guiding force, Quintanilla navigated the challenges of the male-dominated Tejano circuit, booking shows, shaping the group’s image and overseeing every aspect of their development.\n\n\tBy the late 1980s, Selena y Los Dinos had become a dominant force in Tejano music, paving the way for Selena’s crossover success and her emergence as one of the most celebrated Latin music artists of all time.\n\n\tQuintanilla’s life — and the music world — would be shattered on March 31, 1995, when Selena was murdered at age 23 by Yolanda Saldívar, the former president of Selena’s fan club and manager of her boutiques, “Selena Etc.” In the aftermath of the tragedy, Quintanilla became the chief guardian of Selena’s artistic and cultural legacy.\n\t\n\n\tHe served as an executive producer on the 1997 biographical film “Selena,” in which he was portrayed by Edward James Olmos,  and his daughter was played by Jennifer Lopez. Abraham remained closely involved in virtually every album release, documentary and tribute project connected to his daughter’s life and work. In the 2020 Netflix miniseries “Selena: The Series,” Quintanilla was portrayed by Ricardo Chavira.\n\n\tIn November of this year, Netflix released a new documentary about Selena Quintanilla called “Selena y Los Dinos: A Family’s Legacy,” an intimate look into her rise with her family band, using never-before-seen home videos and family archives.\n\n\tSoon after Selena’s death, Quintanilla and his family founded the Selena Foundation, a charitable organization dedicated to helping children in crisis. Through his record company, Q-Productions, he continued to produce and mentor new talent in music and film.\n\n\tIn 2021, Quintanilla released his memoir, “A Father’s Dream: My Family’s Journey in Music.”\n\n\tThough frequently a polarizing figure, Abraham Quintanilla remained a central architect of Selena’s rise and an unyielding advocate for her legacy.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Little Disasters,” now streaming on Paramount+.\n\n\tOver the past year, a cinematic trend has emerged that powerfully underscores the intense difficulties of motherhood. From “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” and “Sinners” to “One Battle After Another” and “Song Sung Blue,” the challenges of being a joy-filled parent can rapidly intensify to an unbearable — and even a maddening — need to be a “perfect” mother. That plight is now being tackled on television in the limited series “Little Disasters” starring Diane Kruger. The six-episode series on Paramount+ illustrates the profound lengths a woman will go to protect her child while simultaneously enduring a significant emotional toll on herself, her marriage and her other children. Kruger has a theory as to why this trend in subject matter is happening — and why now.\n\t\n\n\t“I’d like to believe it’s because more women are in decision-making positions and are greenlighting and validating different concerns or female storylines,” Kruger says. “I certainly think it’s a good thing, and it’s time that we take a look at that as well.”\n\n\n\tThe series follows the complex lives of four new mothers who become fast, longtime friends while all attending a birthing class. Based on Sarah Vaughan’s gripping 2020 novel, the series shows the raw realities of postnatal anxiety, parenting struggles, marriage dynamics and maternal OCD, while also stepping into the culture wars with the lead character’s skepticism about publicly funded healthcare and vaccinations. These illustrated challenges to mothers are authentic and deeply real: an exhausting, backbreaking relentless exercise of patience, selflessness and unconditional love.\n\t\n\n\tIn “Little Disasters,” a fragile bond shatters when one friend, Jess (Kruger), brings her baby daughter to an emergency room in the middle of the night when her persistent crying has her and her husband concerned their infant is sick. But there, Liz (Jo Joyner), an A&E doctor and close friend of 10-plus years, spots a head injury on the child. Liz faces an excruciating dilemma: report her longtime friend to social services or risk the child’s safety. She chooses the former. This single moment ignites a devastating chain of events, revealing how quickly a life-altering decision can fracture and destroy entire families and friendships.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrom the get-go, Kruger’s Jess is an emotional wreck. Her explanation of the injury to the doctors and social services is not only sketchy, it’s unlikely, making her look like an unstable mother — and worse, a possibly abusive one. Her anxiety snowballs as the story rolls out over the weeks that follow.\n\n\tKruger says the role was exhausting, not only because of the subject matter but also because they didn’t shoot in episode order, “So we could go in a day from doing a scene where I think my child died, to 20 minutes later doing a lovely picnic.”\n\n\tAnd it was also taking a personal toll on her, Kruger says: “The emotional extremes that were required almost broke me. Honestly, I said to my partner, ‘I feel like I’m having a burnout, like I’m overstimulated and overspent.’ But you know, on the other hand, I really felt the character was exploring very truthfully those very deep emotions. And especially when you are a mother, I think they rang really true. I was just able to lean into that. It didn’t require much for me to go there.”\n\n\tThankfully, she was able to shake those feelings when she returned to her real life as mom to a daughter with actor Norman Reedus. “Coming home, I have to say, I felt like it was easy — my home and my daughter was with me. We were filming over the summer, and so coming home to her happy little face every night felt like stepping into heaven.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJess’ struggle with the confusion of what really happened to her baby and the fear of the woman she had become overwhelms her. The writers kick it up a notch by allowing viewers into Jess’ head to hear her inner dialogue, and where her imagination takes her.\n\t\n\n\t“I understand women who struggle with postpartum to that extent — or intrusive thoughts — it doesn’t get better without help. In fact, it just reinforces everything you’re worried about to begin with,” Kruger says. “It was such an opportunity to look into that. I don’t pretend to be an expert on that, obviously, but from my circle of girlfriends that have struggled with mental health issues after giving birth, it was so incomprehensive for me at that time to watch them go through what I didn’t know they were going through. They were people I’ve known all my life, all of a sudden were isolating themselves from me. It almost felt like they were gone. Like the person that I thought I knew so well was gone. And I couldn’t understand what was happening.”\n\n\tMost of them eventually came out of that, and were able to somewhat explain what they were going through. But witnessing that extreme was quite scary — and one of the reasons why Kruger signed on to do “Little Disasters.” “I guess I wanted to explore that,” she says. “And Sarah Vaughn, the writer, she experienced this. I mean, not to this extent, but she struggled with very severe, intrusive thoughts, and she was great help of guiding me through this.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJess’ story isn’t cut and dry. There’s a mystery that unfolds, and takes unexpected turns as the series progresses. Her marriage begins to show strain, her two young sons start to exhibit disturbing behavior and although her friends try to be supportive, their concern for her mental state grows. Kruger says the show is just as much about the strengths, weaknesses and evolution of those relationships. And, above all, it explores the difference between how one sees themselves versus how the world around them does. And the moral of the story?\n\n\n\t“I think what unites us is that all mothers or all parents have that thing in common, which in a way is also the theme of the show,” Kruger says. “Because you see those friends coming from different walks of life, and what connects them is the fact that they all had a baby around the same time and they’re raising kids in very different points of views. \n\n\t“But it’s hard. We really shouldn’t judge someone, because we don’t know what’s going on behind closed doors and what they’re going through.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“South Park” returned to its regularly scheduled programming on Wednesday night after detouring for a Halloween Special on Oct. 31. The third episode of Season 28 saw Butters experimenting with OpenAI’s generative AI video platform Sora 2, much to the chagrin of fellow South Park Elementary student Red. Meanwhile, JD Vance manages to seduce Donald Trump and dodge punishment for trying to kill his unborn baby with Satan. \n\n\tThe episode opens with Butters showing off his latest AI video, which features Santa Claus peeing in the mouth of his classmate Red. In an act of swift vengeance, Red creates her own AI video of Butters having sex with Studio Ghibli icon Totoro and plays it during a schoolwide assembly. Once Detective Harris of the Park County Police Department catches wind of the videos, he launches an investigation under the suspicion that popular fictional icons are really committing unspeakable acts against the children of South Park. \n\t\n\n\tBack at the White House, Trump is deciding how to punish Vance for his treason. However, Vance manages to smooth-talk his way out of it. Having mended their relationship, Trump and Vance have a quick soak in the hot tub together, and afterward, they make passionate love in the Lincoln Bedroom.\n\n\tOpenAI has come under fire in recent weeks for allowing Sora 2 users to generate videos with copyrighted IP. Sora 2 currently operates on an opt-out system, meaning any creator can contact the platform developers and have their IP made inaccessible. However, according to copyright law, rights holders can still sue and obtain statutory damages for individual acts of infringement, regardless of the opt-out policy. \n\t\n\n\t“South Park” in 2025 has been all about Trump, and this week’s episode brought more of the same. Seasons 27 and 28 have practically revolved around the president, focusing mostly on his relationship with Satan, while many series mainstays have been allocated to supporting roles.\n\n\t“South Park” co-creator Trey Parker recently told the New York Times that the focus on Trump is not because he and longtime collaborator Matt Stone have “got all political.” It’s instead because “politics became pop culture.”\n\n\t“It’s like the government is just in your face everywhere you look,” Parker explained. “Whether it’s the actual government or whether it is all the podcasters and the TikToks and the YouTubes and all of that, and it’s just all political and political because it’s more than political. It’s pop culture.”\n",

The event also featured new concept art by Ilya Kuvshinov, who previously worked as character designer on “Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045.”\n\t\n\n\tKojima will serve as executive producer on the series, which will tell an entirely new story set within the “Death Stranding” universe, separate from the video games’ narrative. The animated project will follow a young man and woman on an adventure, rendered in traditional hand-drawn 2D animation. Japan’s E&H production is handling the animation.\n\n\n\tThe original “Death Stranding” PlayStation game launched in 2019 and has attracted more than 20 million players worldwide. The franchise recently expanded with “Death Stranding 2: On the Beach,” which launched exclusively on PlayStation 5.\n\n\tKojima, who established Kojima Productions in December 2015, is widely credited as the father of the stealth game genre. In 2020, he received the BAFTA Fellowship in recognition of his contributions to gaming. The original “Death Stranding” starred Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen and Léa Seydoux.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n\tThe Disney+ series represents the latest expansion of gaming intellectual property into streaming animation, following successful adaptations of franchises including Netflix’s “Castlevania,” “Arcane” and “Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.“​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following recap contains spoilers for the finale of “The Golden Bachelor” Season 2.\n\n\tMel Owens’ journey on “The Golden Bachelor”",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following recap contains spoilers for the finale of “The Golden Bachelor” Season 2.\n\n\tMel Owens’ journey on “The Golden Bachelor” has been full of drama since before his season even started. (As his contestants’ chose not to let him forget, he said on a podcast before entering the Bachelor Mansion that he would eliminate any women over 60.) That remained true until the end, when the 66-year-old former NFL linebacker had to make a decision about whether to choose 60-year-old Cindy Cullers, 62-year-old Peg Munson or neither of them.\n\t\n\n\tThat third possibility began to look more and more likely after last week’s “Fantasy Suites” episode, which ended on a cliffhanger.\n\n\n\tBoth women expressed frustration throughout the episode that Mel wasn’t clearer about his feelings for them. On Peg’s date with him, she tried to ask how things are going between them, and he answered two of her questions by simply saying “good” before changing the topic to the dune buggies they’d just driven together. “He deflects, you know? And I don’t know if it’s because of all of the outside stuff. I have a little bit of concern: Is it something [where] he’s not emotionally available, or he’s just being guarded?” But later that night, over dinner, they connected with slightly more depth and decided to take advantage of the Fantasy Suite, an overnight date away from the cameras. The next morning, they both expressed that they felt closer to each other, with Peg calling Mel “emotionally intelligent.”\n\n\tThings didn’t go as smoothly with Cindy, but it was unclear if that was about her connection with Mel or about her marriage-focused questions. The two went on an awkward date, with Mel full of fear as they swam with stingrays. At dinner, after Cindy tried asking how he felt about both her and Peg, he said, “It just takes time. I’m gonna make educated choices. I’m not going to take the leap of faith, so to speak.” Cindy responded by saying that the whole show is about a leap of faith, but Mel disagreed: “I’m smart enough to know that’s not how my life operates.” As their tense conversation continued, Mel repeatedly evaded the topic of whether he’s actually ready to get married again. Cindy aptly pointed out that “The Golden Bachelor” is meant to end in a proposal, but Mel emphasized that it’s about “finding a partner,” and didn’t seem to appreciate when Cindy suggested that, being divorced, maybe he should be open to getting engaged sooner than he did in his first marriage. Cindy thanked him for the “very insightful” admissions, but was clearly displeased by his inability to clarify his feelings about her and marriage as a whole. “If there’s a will, there’s a way,” he tried to assure her, so she asked if there was a will. The episode ends before he answers — and without showing whether Mel and Cindy went to the Fantasy Suite.\n\t\n\n\tDuring Wednesday night’s finale, it was revealed that Cindy decided to leave after realizing she and Mel weren’t on the same page about their relationship.\n\n\t“He’s not interested in making any type of commitments for several years,” Cindy said in a confessional. “I’m in my golden years — I’m 60 years old — and I’m not interested in being put on hold. He is just not my person.”\n\n\tAfter walking Cindy out, a stunned Mel returned to the dinner table alone. “I’m shocked. The date with Cindy, it was perfect,” he said. “I came in tonight thinking there was a future. But she quit… I don’t know what I’m gonna do.”  \n\n\tNot long after, though, Mel regrouped and introduced Peg to his two sons, Andre and Lucas, as well as his college friend, Diane. During her one-on-one time with the sons, Peg asked what kind of partner they thought would be ideal for their father.\n\n\t“Just an easygoing, not-too-much-drama, mellow person who really enjoys life,” Lucas said.\n\n\tAs they got to know each other, Lucas added, “I think you’re, like, the perfect gal for my dad, because the energy — you help bring him up, the uplifting.” He and Andre also shared with their father that they were fond of Peg and believed she was a perfect match for him. \n\n\t“Peg and my boys got along swimmingly, and getting that resounding thumbs up is wonderful,” Mel said. \n\n\tFollowing the family’s approval, Mel ultimately chose Peg. And even though he didn’t get down on one knee and propose, he gave her a ring, explaining that it “represents our commitment to love, to give time to figure out together what our future holds.” He also presented her with the final golden rose.\n\n\t“I got the perfect gal right here,” Mel said, to which Peg added, “I got the perfect guy.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tABKCO Records, which owns the rights to the master recordings of the Rolling Stones up to 1970, has sued Behr Paint, alleging copyright infringement over the use of the group’s 1966 song “Paint It, Black” in one of its online commercials.\n\n\tThe complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, Southern Division, and obtained by Variety, alleges that “Behr, without ABKCO’s authorization, without compensating ABKCO, and for its sole commercial benefit, reproduced, distributed, publicly performed, transmitted, prepared a derivative work embodying, and otherwise exploited the ABKCO Recording in a commercial advertisement to promote BEHR’s products and business.”\n\t\n\n\tIt adds, “Behr is a sophisticated, multi-billion-dollar corporation that, upon information and belief, routinely licenses recorded music for its commercials, yet it inexplicably chose in this case not to seek a license for ‘Paint It, Black.’”\n\n\n\tABKCO is seeking unspecified damages as a result. The ad appears to have been removed from Behr’s robust Instagram archive, although unofficial versions can be found online.\n\n\tVariety has contacted Behr representatives for comment. \n\n\tWilliam Pittenger, General Counsel for ABKCO noted, “The type of commercial use exploited by Behr undergoes some of the highest level of scrutiny in the world of music licensing and carries some of the most substantial licensing fees. Because of Behr’s decision not to request and obtain the necessary license, this commercial brand association has been forced upon ABKCO and the artists without any consideration or compensation.”\n\t\n\n\tThe online ad, posted to Behr’s official Instagram account, shows a house being painted not black but a greyish-green color while the song plays. In one version of the clip found on Instagram, a brief snippet of dialogue from the Martin Scorsese 1989 film “Goodfellas,” which features the song, is heard, suggesting that the recording was taken from the film, potentially resulting in further copyright issues.\n\n\t“Paint It, Black,” written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1966 and is one of the Rolling Stones‘ biggest hits, although its lyrics — written from the perspective of a person whose outlook is so dark that he wants to paint everything black — are unusual for an ad with an otherwise upbeat tone.  \n\n\tABKCO, which was founded by the late former Stones and Beatles business manager Allen Klein, has a long history of aggressively protecting the copyrights it owns and oversees. Perhaps the most famous was over the Verve’s 1997 hit “Bittersweet Symphony,” which samples a five-second portion of a cover of the Stones’ song “The Last Time” by the Andrew Loog Oldham Orchestra. The Stones had agreed to license the segment in exchange for 50 percent of the royalties, but ABKCO claimed the clip was longer and violated the agreement. It filed a successful plagiarism case that resulted in the Verve relinquishing all royalties and publishing rights to ABKCO, and the song credit reverted to Jagger and Richards. However, this decision was reversed in 2019 when the two Stones signed over the publishing on “Bittersweet Symphony” to Verve frontman Richard Ashcroft, allowing all future royalties to go to him.\n\n\tABKCO is represented by Benjamin S. Akley and Shamar Toms-Anthony of the law firm Pryor Cashman LLP.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Van Der Beek is seeking additional finances to help cover costs for his cancer treatment. The 48-year-old “Dawson’s Creek” star has elected to team with Propstore to sell memorabilia he’s obtained through his career.\n\n\tThe catalog includes wardrobe, props and set pieces, with listings such as the prom necklace that Van Der Beek’s Dawson gifted Joey (Katie Holmes) for prom in “Dawson’s Creek” and the cleats and West Canaan Coyotes Hat worn by Van Der Beek in the 1999 feature “Varsity Blues.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve been storing these treasures for years, waiting for the right time to do something with them, and with all of the recent unexpected twists and turns life has presented recently, it’s clear that the time is now,” Van Der Beek told People. “While I have some nostalgia tugging at me as I part with these items, it feels good to be able to offer them through Propstore’s auction to share with those who have supported my work over the years.”\n\n\n\tThe items will go on sale through Propstore’s annual Winter Entertainment Memorabilia Live Auction, which runs from Dec. 5 to Dec. 7. All proceeds go to Van Der Beek’s medical costs.\n\n\tVan Der Beek was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer last year. Colorectal cancer, which begins in the colon or rectum, is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society. In the U.S., about 1 in 23 men and 1 in 25 women will be diagnosed with this form of cancer in their lifetime.\n\n\t“I’ve been privately dealing with this diagnosis and have been taking steps to resolve it, with the support of my incredible family,” Van Der Beek told People when revealing his diagnosis to the public. “There’s reason for optimism, and I’m feeling good.”\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, colorectal cancer has the second-highest treatment cost of any form of cancer. More than $24.3 billion was spent on treatment in the U.S. in 2020, accounting for 11.3% of cancer treatment costs in the country.\n",

The cast also included Stephanie Koenig, Sean Patton, Carmen Christopher, Enrico Colantoni and Jordan Firstman.\n\n\tFX had no comment.\n\n\n\t“English Teacher” premiered in September 2024, with Season 2 following in September of this year. While Season 1 followed a week-to-week model for new episodes, FX opted for a binge release on Season 2, debuting all 10 episodes at once.\n\t\n\n\tDays before the release of Season 1, Alvarez was accused of sexual assault by Jon Ebeling, his former friend and co-star on “The Gay and Wondrous Life of Caleb Gallo,” a 2015 webseries that Alvarez created and starred in. Ebeling first made the allegations on Instagram, then expanded on the issue in a December 2024 New York Magazine article. Ebeling also accused Koenig — his ex-girlfriend and Alvarez’s close friend, who wrote on “English Teacher” in addition to starring — of helping to uphold the harmful dynamic between him and Alvarez.\n\n\tNews of the allegations did not initially impact the fate of “English Teacher” at FX, which renewed the series for Season 2 less than two months after the New York Magazine story broke. About the story, a spokesperson for FX said, “We reviewed the allegations presented to us by another media outlet prior to the show’s launch. Mr. Ebeling never reached out to us with any concerns. We will have no further comment at this time.” \n\t\n\n\tThe network did not mention of the allegations in its press release about the renewal, instead providing a celebratory statement from president Nick Grad: “’English Teacher’ was one of the most critically acclaimed new shows of 2024 and we are grateful to the producers, writers, cast, directors and crew for the show’s creative excellence. We look forward to the new season.”\n\n\t“English Teacher” was executive produced by Alvarez, Paul Simms, Jonathan Krisel, Dave King, Kathryn Dean, Jake Bender and Zach Dunn and produced by FX Productions.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEmily Blunt sat down with Elle magazine for its Women in Hollywood cover series and looked back at her first movie audition, which was for Paweł Pawlikowski’s 2004 romance drama “My Summer of Love.” Blunt was 19 years old at the time. The movie encouraged improvisations, so there was no script to read from during the audition. \n\n\t“Paweł sat by the window and he had this mad hair,” Blunt said. “He’s filming me on his camcorder and in his Polish accent he goes, ‘Okay, so we’re going to do a little reading. You look out the window and you see your dad and he’s fucking his secretary, and I want you to be horrified. You get very, very mad. Then get very upset and cry about it. And then at some point, pretend the whole thing’s a joke. Okay, go.’”\n\t\n\n\t“He gave me no opportunity, but to put my feet to the fire,” Blunt added, noting that she immediately called her agent afterward and recounted how awful and embarrassing she thought she did in the audition. Blunt ultimately got the role, starring opposite Natalie Press in the film.\n\n\t“It was about living in the moment, and really becoming somebody else,” Blunt said about acting in the film, which centers on the romance between two young women. “Paweł taught me a lot about ambiguity and spontaneity, which was completely terrifying to me at first. To work without any conformity was super scary. But I learned swiftly afterward from watching the movie how compelling ambiguity can be.”\n\n\tBlunt continued, “It just really created this foundation for me of, you can do really scary things, you can create, you can change the lines, you can stretch a scene around—you can do that. So I’d say that movie was a big turning point, a big lesson for me. Like being chucked in the deep end with a weight around my ankles.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile not an enormous box office success, “My Summer of Love” was strongly embraced by film critics and won the best British film prize at the BAFTAs. The movie was Pawlikowski’s second feature directorial effort and he would go on to helm the likes of “Ida” and “Cold War,” the former of which won the Oscar for best international feature and the latter of which earned Pawlikowski a best director nomination.\n\n\tBlunt’s performance in “My Summer of Love” was widely praised, with Variety’s review calling her “terrific” and praising her for adding a “sense of menace” to the film with her “mysterious, mixed-up” character.\n\n\tHead over to Elle magazine’s website to read Blunt’s latest profile in its entirety.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Magazine Dreams,” the violent bodybuilding drama from director Elijah Bynum that earned critical acclaim at Sundance in 2023 only to get caught up assault allegations against its lead star Jonathan Majors, is now set to hit cinemas in the U.K.\n\n\tThe release comes through a unique distribution partnership between BUFF Studios, the distribution arm of the British Urban Film Festival, alongside Celsius Entertainment and Aaryan K. Trivedi. Celsius is continuing to sell the film at the American Film Market.\n\t\n\n\tThe deal marks BUFF Studios’ ongoing expansion into distribution following its releases of “No Shade” and “Ireke: Rise of the Maroons.” The U.K. release is set for Dec. 5 2025, with Vue Cinemas confirmed to roll out the film across multiple sites in London, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and Nottingham.\n\n\n\t“A film festival like BUFF’s move into distribution with a film of this quality represents an important innovation for the market,” said Trivedi, who released “Magazine Dreams” in Africa through his company WTHW films (“Kneecap,” “Mapantsula”). “We’re thrilled to have made this deal and are eager to see how collaborations like this can evolve the international distribution landscape.”\n\n\tEmmanuel Anyiam-Osigwe, head of global theatrical distribution at BUFF Studios, described the film as a “statement release” for the company.\n\n\t“This partnership with Celsius Entertainment and Aaryan K. Trivedi reflects BUFF’s commitment to bringing bold, artistically fearless stories to UK audiences,” he said. “Our slate represents the next chapter in BUFF’s evolution – from festival platform to full-service distribution brand.”\n\t\n\n\tProduced by Los Angeles Media Fund and distributed in the U.S. earlier this year by Briarcliff Entertainment, “Magazine Dreams “follows Killian Maddox, a driven but troubled bodybuilder struggling with identity, fame, and obsession. The film premiered to strong buzz following its debut at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival, sparking a bidding war won by Searchlight Pictures for a reported mid-seven figure sum. But the distributor dropped the film in January 2024 after Majors was accused of domestic violence against his ex-girlfriend. \n\n\tThe “Magazine Dreams” U.K. deal was brokered between Trivedi, Anyiam-Osigwe for BUFF Studios and Celsius Entertainment .\n",

Rajamouli’s Globe-Trotting Action Film Unveiled Ahead of Title Reveal\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDurga Arts\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“RRR” director S.S. Rajamouli has unveiled the first look of Priyanka Chopra Jonas as Mandakini in his upcoming globe-trotting adventure film. \n\n\tThe film is described as “an original action-adventure epic following heroes on a series of perilous missions around the world.”\n\n\tEver since the global smash hit “RRR” claimed the Oscar for best original song and recalibrated Indian cinema’s global ambition, Rajamouli has set his sights higher. The film unites the director with Telugu cinema superstar Mahesh Babu and welcomes international star Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Malayalam powerhouse Prithviraj Sukumaran. \n\t\n\n\tThe title of the film will be revealed at a fan event in Hyderabad this weekend. \n\n\n\tRajamouli’s earlier two-part “Baahubali” saga, re-edited as “Baahubali: The Epic,” landed this year as a single film. \n\n\tJonas returns to Indian cinema with a splash with Rajamouli’s film, portraying the enigmatic Mandakini’ in a first look that sees her in a mustard saree, pistol in hand, balanced on a cliff edge.  Her recent credits include her Prime Video film “Heads of State” (2025), alongside Idris Elba and John Cena, and her short-film contribution to the Oscar-nominated “Anuja.”\n\n\tTelugu cinema superstar Mahesh Babu is working with Rajamouli for what is billed as his 29th film (hence the working title SSMB 29).  His recent release, “Guntur Kaaram” (2024) was a box office success and now he’s stepping into a much larger, globe-spanning canvas.  \n\n\tOriginating from Malayalam cinema, Prithviraj Sukumaran is now a pan-India star with film like “Salaar” and the “Lucifer” franchise. Already known for intense roles across systems, his participation signals the project’s ambition to blend South Indian star power into a unified global offering. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

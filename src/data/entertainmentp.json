    "body": "\n\tHong Kong sales company Moebius Entertainment has boarded Taiwanese film “Double Happiness” for international sales across Asia-Pacific territories, following the film’s world premiere at the Tokyo International Film Festival.\n\n\tJoseph Chen-Chieh Hsu, who previously directed “Little Big Women,” helmed the comedy-drama. The cast features Kuan-Ting Liu, known for his work in “A Sun” and “Old Fox,” alongside Jennifer Yu (“In Broad Daylight,” “Sisterhood”) and veteran actress Kuei-mei Yang, whose credits include “Vive L’Amour” and “Eat Drink Man Woman.”\n\t\n\n\tClifford Miu produces the project, which centers on a wedding that descends into chaos when a soon-to-be-married man discovers both of his long-separated parents have independently organized his wedding reception for the same day at the same venue — without either knowing about the other’s plans.\n\n\n\tMoebius Entertainment CEO Fred Tsui expressed enthusiasm about reuniting with Miu after they previously worked together on “American Girl.”\n\n\t“Clifford’s films have a rare blend of humor, empathy, and cross-cultural resonance,” said Tsui. “‘Double Happiness’ captures the chaos and warmth of modern Asian family life in a way that feels both universal and deeply personal. We’re excited to introduce it to distributors across the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] region.”\n\n\tThe sales agreement was finalized at the Tokyo festival, marking another step in Moebius’s expansion at international markets as the company continues emphasizing quality filmmaking from Asian directors.\n\n\tThe company is currently handling worldwide sales for Chinese title “Wild Nights, Tamed Beasts,” which secured a direction award for Wang Tong at the Rome film festival after previously winning the jury grand prize and best actress for Regina Wang at the Shanghai International Film Festival, plus best script and best actor at the First Film Festival.\n\t\n\n\tMoebius’s roster includes Peter Chan’s “She Has No Name” and “She Has a Name,” Philip Yung’s “Papa,” Jame Hung’s “My First of May” and Nick Cheung’s “Peg O’ My Heart.”\n\n\tThe Hong Kong-based operation focuses on bringing auteur-driven and commercially viable Asian films to international buyers, building bridges between regional filmmakers and worldwide audiences through strategic festival programming and market positioning.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBarunson E&A, the production and distribution studio behind “Parasite,” reaffirmed that sharply rising production costs and slowing film revenue in Korea are driving local producers to pivot towards global co-production.\n\n\tYoonhee Choi, CEO of Barunson E&A, noted the challenge facing the industry at a seminar on international co-production at TIFFCOM, the market arm of the Tokyo International Film Festival. \n\n\n\t“In Korea, the film industry has been struggling, and at the same time, the production costs have risen significantly,” said Choi. “As labor costs and general prices have gone up, average production costs have increased across the board. Since the profit from films has decreased, these investments are becoming more difficult.”\n\t\n\n\tThe studio has expanded its business into international markets, with a slate of completed films from Taiwan (“Miss Shampoo”), Vietnam (“Don’t Cry Butterfly”) and Indonesia (“Rangga & Cinta”).\n\n\tOf particular interest to Barunson E&A is the Indonesian market.\n\n\t“The country we have been working with the most recently is Indonesia. The reason is that Indonesia is currently the fastest-growing country in the world, and it still has a lot of room for further growth,” said Choi.\n\n\t“Many talented new directors are emerging in Indonesia. In the past, the genres of successful films were limited to horror, religious dramas, and so on, but recently there is a demand for diverse films, and new talented directors who bring us such projects,” she added.\n\n\tTo solidify its commitment, the company recently signed a two-year slate deal with acclaimed Indonesian director Joko Anwar. Barunson E&A is handling overseas sales for the director’s upcoming “Ghost in the Cell.”\n\t\n\n\tTogether with fellow panellist, Japanese producer Kawai Shinya (“Ring,” “Yi Yi”), Choi also offered insights into the sophisticated campaign strategy that propelled “Parasite” to become the first non-English-language film to win Best Picture.\n\n\t“From the start, we chose overseas distributors that could participate in the Oscar campaign, companies with the experience, the passion and the will to somehow elevate this film,” said Choi. “After winning the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival, we immediately started the Oscar campaign in collaboration with the U.S. distributor Neon.\n\n\t“The Academy campaign is almost like an election campaign. We constantly had to create a justification and basis for Academy to vote for this film. At the time, there was a great drive towards diverse films in the U.S., and director Bong Joon Ho ran a very compelling campaign targeted at Academy members, which I believe contributed to the success.”\n\n\tKawai offered a stark counterpoint, reflecting on the inexperienced mistakes that led to the failure of the Academy Awards campaign in 2000, for Edward Yang’s “Yi Yi: A One and a Two,” which had won best director at Cannes.\n\n\tDespite the film’s critical acclaim, Kawai realized too late that the film was ineligible for the Academy Awards.\n\n\t“After we won best foreign film from the LA Film Critics Association, I looked at the Academy Award requirements and found a stipulation that a film must be screened for at least two weeks in its home country by the end of December,” said Kawai. “It was already late when I found out, but we decided to try anyway. We hastily screened Edward Yang’s film for one run in Shibuya in December.”\n\n\tDespite the effort, the film failed to be nominated for the Academy Award because of another technicality.\n\n\t“We had considered it a co-production, and since the producer was Japanese and most of the financing was Japanese, we thought it would be defined as a Japanese film,” continued Kawai. “However, ultimately, because the director was Taiwanese and most of the locations were in Taiwan, it was judged to be a Taiwanese film. Since it had not been screened in Taiwan, it was deemed ineligible.”\n\n\tKawai also had choice words for Japan’s unique Production Committee (seisaku Iinkai) financing system, where committees of companies with gather to invest and share risks.\n\t\n\n\tKawai was a lead producer for the 2004 film “Rikidozan”, which was planned as a JPY700 million ($4.5 million) co-production evenly split between Japan and Korean investors.\n\n\t“As the script was being developed, one of the five companies in the Japanese Production Committee said the story was bad. The biggest investor said they absolutely couldn’t do it and pulled out. When one member of the Production Committee pulls out, everyone else pulls out. I felt terrible for the Korean side at that time, but all of Japan’s half of the money ended up being covered entirely by the Korean side, CJ.” said Kawai.\n\n\tHe lamented the inability for quick decision making under the Production Committee system.\n\n\t“You need the ability to immediately answer, a producer who can make a judgment. The Production Committee system, on the other hand, requires unanimous agreement to move forward. It has its advantages, like risk hedging and using your own media companies for promotion, but when working with overseas partners, issues like speed always arise.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“South Park” got meta on its Oct. 31 Halloween episode, as Stan voiced the dissent of some fans by saying “‘South Park’ sucks now because of all of this political shit,” referring to recent White House storylines. Of course, being that this is “South Park,” his solution was to create South Park Sucks crypto and send Kyle’s cousin Kyle Schwartz to ask Trump for protection for this memecoin scheme.\n\n\tThis led to an intersecting plot in which Trump holds a seance, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, to help rid himself of a behatted entity that’s haunting him in the White House — also known as his wife, Melania. Also spotted haunting the halls of the White House is FCC chairman Brendan Carr, wcho appeared as a Mummy after “losing his freedom of speech,” according to Stephen Miller, referring to an intentional injury Carr suffered in an earlier episode.\n\t\n\n\t“South Park” came two days late this week to deliver a Halloween special edition. The Friday night episode was titled “The Woman in the Hat.”\n\n\n\t2025’s round of “South Park” episodes has experienced several delays, date changes and even a sudden Season 28 premiere. However, future episodes are expected to resume the biweekly release schedule, with dates set for Nov. 12, Nov. 26 and Dec. 10.\n\n\tLast week’s episode continued the saga of Trump’s failing relationship with his pregnant partner, Satan. It also tackled the viral “6-7” TikTok trend, which enveloped South Park Elementary and sent Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel on a search for the Antichrist.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSchuyler Weiss opened his masterclass at an MPA event during the Tokyo International Film Festival‘s TIFFCOM market by tackling the most frequently ",
    "body": "\n\tSchuyler Weiss opened his masterclass at an MPA event during the Tokyo International Film Festival‘s TIFFCOM market by tackling the most frequently asked question in his career: What does a producer actually do?\n\n\tComparing himself to “a sort of cartoon sheepdog, endlessly moving the flock forward together, unrelentingly driven, but always relentlessly positive,” Weiss emphasized the protective nature of producing. “Above all, protective of the group, and most importantly, protective of the entire creative endeavor,” he said during the session.\n\t\n\n\tThe producer, who has worked with Baz Luhrmann for approximately 20 years, described filmmaking as an exercise in balance and tension. “The most quintessential tension of all in show business is probably between art and commerce,” Weiss said. “You can’t have one without the other. You can’t tell stories for no one, and yet to try and convene people together to watch a movie that has no art and has no soul, has no story at the center of it is a hollow exercise.”\n\n\n\tWeiss began his film career as a production assistant at the Australian Film Television and Radio School, landing his first job by signing up on a clipboard. His assignment: defending 20 parking spaces during peak hour on a Sydney street corner at 4 a.m., armed with parking cones, an orange vest and a clipboard. “From that moment on, I was hooked,” he said, watching the film crew assemble around him piece by piece.\n\n\tWorking on “Australia” with Luhrmann provided his comprehensive education in filmmaking, from script development through global marketing. The experience included memorable moments like karaoke with Hugh Jackman and the local Fox distribution team at 2 a.m. after the Tokyo premiere. “Unfortunately, I don’t have a photo of that,” Weiss said.\n\t\n\n\tThe journey convinced him he “never wanted to just go back to one part, one slice” of the filmmaking process. To achieve this goal as a producer, Weiss moved to New York City and started making low-budget independent films. “When you have no money, you have to just work it out,” he said of making ultra-low-budget movies in the U.S. independent system.\n\n\tHe produced approximately half a dozen indie films, several premiering at Sundance, including “Piercing,” based on a Japanese novel by Murakami Ryu. Weiss described his career philosophy of alternating between different types of challenges: “Pushing yourself to keep up with a fast moving herd with great experience and great power” versus having “no one with whom to keep up, no one even noticing whether you’re going to succeed or fail, except yourself.”\n\n\tAbout capturing musical performances on film, Weiss detailed the extensive preparation required for “Elvis.” The team began recording with Austin Butler in Nashville’s RCA studio — where Elvis himself recorded — approximately a year before shooting began in Australia. “We’re not big believers in capturing music performances live on set,” Weiss explained. “Preparation is everything. You really have to take some big leaps, because you’re committing to creative decisions about the music well before you film anything.”\n\n\tThe production created a hybrid musical language blending Elvis’s original vocals with Butler’s voice. For 1950s material, recorded in mono and unsuitable for modern Atmos theater sound, the production used exclusively Butler’s vocals. For later concert footage with multi-track Elvis recordings, they often blended both voices. “Focus 100% of your energy on set to capturing the visual side of that performance, and then you can continue to build on it in the post production process, musically,” Weiss advised.\n\n\tThe approach proved so successful that Weiss applied similar techniques to his subsequent film “How to Make Gravy,” a sub-$10 million independent Australian production starring Daniel Henshall. For a prison choir sequence, the team pre-recorded complex arrangements that would have been impossible to capture live on set.\n\n\t“Elvis” faced unique challenges filming during the pandemic, particularly recreating a performer whose “signature move is to get down from the stage in the audience and kiss just about every member of the audience you can find.” The production invented solutions including an “extras antibacterial mouthwash station.” Weiss credited closed borders with creating unexpected benefits: “There was something about making a film in this kind of perfect isolation and perfect focus that I think produced an extraordinary result.”\n\t\n\n\tThe marketing challenges extended beyond production. As the then-head of Warner Brothers marketing told Weiss, “he was going to be damned if he was going to make Austin a star with this movie and then have the next guy reap the benefits when Austin became a star.” The strategy succeeded, placing Butler on the cover of every major magazine worldwide before release. “He was a household name by the time we rolled out the movie,” Weiss said. The film earned a standing ovation at Cannes and grossed over $300 million globally.\n\n\tWeiss previewed “EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert,” a documentary culled from approximately 60 boxes of never-before-seen footage from Elvis concerts between 1970 and 1972. Luhrmann traveled to Wellington to work with Peter Jackson on restoration, syncing lost audio from work prints. The documentary features approximately 40 minutes of previously unheard Elvis dialogue. “Baz committed himself to having Elvis narrate the film. So it really is Elvis singing and telling his own stories,” Weiss said. The Imax-finished film releases worldwide through Universal Pictures and Neon in late February.\n\n\tOn artificial intelligence, Weiss revealed the “Elvis” team used machine learning techniques approximately a decade ago, before the term AI became common. To insert Butler into classic Elvis films, they partnered with the University of Adelaide’s technology lab rather than major VFX companies, who “weren’t really thinking along those lines.” “We weren’t calling it AI, and we had to look outside our own business to do it,” he noted.\n\n\tToday, Weiss and Luhrmann use AI as a creative tool for concept imagery and iteration, though never in finished film products. “Baz knows the difference between creative and generative, and AI is just a derivative tool that can collage a seemingly infinite, but actually finite bunch of stuff. That’s not creativity.”\n\n\tLooking ahead to Luhrmann’s “Joan of Arc” biopic starring 18-year-old English actress Isla Johnson, Weiss positioned the project as a response to uncertain times in Hollywood. “The only way to continue to do that is to come back to where we began: to believe in original storytelling and believe that, that will win the day,” he said.\n\n\tThe story of a 17-year-old girl in a “fractured and devastated world, her country on its knees, and the future for young people completely uncertain,” with her fate “held tightly in the knobbly fingered grip of a bunch of the entrenched powers,” feels timely. “Her ability as a 17-year-old girl to break that world wide open and recapture the future for France at a time of change and peril, feels like a story that people might see something in today.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production aims to begin pre-production next year, with shooting by mid-2026. Weiss acknowledged budget negotiations with Warner Brothers are ongoing, joking that if they don’t reach agreement, “we’re going to be making the 1928 ‘Trial of Joan of Arc.'” The 1928 silent film by Carl Theodor Dreyer remains “one of the most poignant and poetic tellings of the story,” Weiss said, adding “we carry the spirit of that in our hearts as we try and make our own” version.\n\n\tOn IP dominance in contemporary cinema, Weiss drew historical parallels. “There was a time, if you can believe it, when the most sure fire commercial kind of movie that you could make was a Western,” he noted. “Taste is a funny thing that way. The IP boom in the Marvel comic book sense definitely seems to be waning.”\n\n\tWeiss sees opportunity in the current transitional moment between commercial trends: “If we are truly finding ourselves in that slightly liminal state between big commercial trends, that’s a great opportunity in which I think original storytelling can really flourish.”\n\n\tAfter “Elvis,” Weiss recommitted to working in Australia and collaborating throughout the Asia Pacific region. Bazmark is developing projects with an animation company in Tokyo and a record label in Seoul. “The more that we can connect the dots between what we do in the Gold Coast, Australia, all throughout this region, we feel like we are so excited to play even a small part in the enormous global cultural potential of the APAC region,” he said.\n\n\tOn distribution challenges for smaller films like “How to Make Gravy” — based on a popular Australian song but difficult to sell internationally despite featuring Hugo Weaving — Weiss acknowledged the landscape has changed. “We’ve broken down a lot of the old systems for disseminating and distributing independent cinema around the world,” he said. “We’re in a challenging spot right now.”\n\n\tHowever, Weiss encouraged emerging filmmakers to embrace democratized tools. “The barrier to entry for so many different things is sort of reduced almost to the floor,” he said, noting that Hollywood studios spend millions trying to optimize what individuals can accomplish through Instagram and TikTok. “You have all the same tools that Warner Brothers has in terms of communicating their movie through digital marketing.”\n\t\n\n\tOn cultural authenticity versus internationalization, Weiss advocated for leaning into specificity. “The stories that lean into greater authenticity and are less concerned as to whether a broad international audience is going to pick up every single reference” succeed globally, he argued, citing Korean cinema and the Australian animated series “Bluey.” “People readily consume content that wasn’t necessarily made with an international audience in mind, and people like it all the more for it,” Weiss concluded.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Swift fans are putting their mobilizing skills to work to support those in need. The Swiftie coalition known as Swifties for Hope on X tweeted out on Friday that fans are encouraged to donate $13 or whatever they can afford to support those affected by the potential cuts of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). \n\n\tAlongside an image with text referencing Swift’s “The Life of a Showgirl” song, “Father Figure,” the account wrote in a caption, “Swifties, we’re fundraising for @FeedingAmerica to help support food banks nationwide. Tomorrow, SNAP benefits will halt and the 42 million Americans who rely on them will need help.”\n\t\n\n\tAlthough the group is not affiliated with Swift’s camp, the Swiftie coalition states in its bio that its mission is to “mobilize fans to protect democracy.” \n\n\t The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, aids roughly 42 million people and was set to run out of funds on Saturday without intervention. On Friday, a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to continue paying for food stamps during the federal shutdown “as soon as possible.” However, if the department finds the funds are insufficient, other sources must be found and used. \n\n\tThis isn’t the first time the Swifites have joined forces in political circles. In 2024, during the presidential campaign for Kamala Harris, Swifties for Kamala raised over $100,000 in donations with a virtual rally that saw a lineup of guest speakers — including Carole King and senator Elizabeth Warren, among others. \n",

    "description": "\n\tChoreographer Parris Goebel was “born with a passion and love for dance.”\n\n\tIt was a passion that led to her collaborate with the duo of Jennifer Lo",
    "body": "\n\tChoreographer Parris Goebel was “born with a passion and love for dance.”\n\n\tIt was a passion that led to her collaborate with the duo of Jennifer Lopez and Shakira, as well as Rihanna on their respective Super Bowl halftime shows in 2020 and 2023. “It doesn’t matter the scale, I give it my all,” she says.\n\n\tAs creative directors and executive producers Lady Gaga and Michael Polansky were conceiving the singer’s Coachella set and subsequent Mayhem Ball tour, the duo brought Goebel on as choreographer.\n\t\n\n\tThe theme of the tour is a grand opera house with stone columns and grand archways, which allow Gaga and her dancers to seamlessly switch from the opening moments of Gaga emerging in a caged dress, housing mayhem dancers to two queens facing off during “Poker Face.”\n\n\n\tGoebel says “Paparazzi’s” rainbow cape, worn when Gaga emerged from a sandbox, representing a grave, was the most challenging element, and also deeply meaningful one. “Being an artist that can survive the test of time, which she is, is such a testimony to her resilience, and how fearless and unapologetic she is,” she says.\n\n\tHere, Goebel, who was recognized on Variety’s Women’s Impact report, spoke about her work as a choreographer and working with Gaga.\n\t\n\t\tI went to the L.A shows in July, and saw you in the audience that night, watching the show. How often do you go in to see the show and make sure everything is on track?\t\n\n\tI usually watch the first couple of shows and make sure it’s all good. I have other stuff that I’m working on so I can’t be on the road like that. So, when I went to watch it in L.A., I genuinely went to go and enjoy it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSince we’re honoring you for the women’s impact report, let’s go back. Where did your love for dance begin?\t\n\n\tI was born with a passion and a love for dance. I don’t distinctively remember a moment where I discovered dance. I just have memories of dancing at home in my bedroom and in the lounge. Most of us are just born with something that we really love, and we’re called to do, you know, everyone has a purpose. Some of us find it when we’re kids, and some of us find it later in life. I was blessed to find it when I was a little girl.\n\t\n\t\tWell, here you are working with some of the biggest music stars in the world. What makes you say yes to a collaboration?\t\n\n\tJust genuinely being a fan of their work. It’s obviously changed over the years. Before, I definitely was just saying yes to everything because I couldn’t believe I was in L.A. and people wanted to work with me. Now, being in the industry for 10-plus years, I’m way pickier. I understand my value a lot more. Does this artist or person excite me, and am I genuinely a fan of their work? Those are probably the two things.\n\t\n\t\tOver the course of your career, you’ve done two Super Bowl halftime shows. What is that pressure like when you’re doing something for an audience of that size, and does the approach change at all?\t\n\n\tMy approach is always pretty much the same. It doesn’t matter the scale. I give it my all. I don’t stop until it’s done, and I just want it to be great; it doesn’t matter what the stage is like. I approached everything with the same amount of hard work and execution. I grew up in New Zealand, so I didn’t really understand the magnitude of the Super Bowl to be completely honest. I knew it was big, but I don’t know if I understood how big it was.\n\t\n\t\tGoing back to the Mayhem Ball tour, what was the collaborative process behind the opening of the show and Gaga coming out in this caged dress?\t\n\n\tWe landed on the idea of doing an opera. Once I had that, my brain went crazy. When you think of a female opera singer, you think of these big, gorgeous gowns and the drama of it. With Stefani, you take an idea and think, “How can this be bigger and more epic and louder and bolder?” I became quite literal about it in my head, like, what if it’s massive and larger than life? And then, how do you bring choreography into it? OK, you put dancers in the skirt. It would be sick if there were levels under her dress and it was a cage. We had created these mayhem characters that were extensions of Queen Mayhem. It’s always cool when an artist is elevated, but there was something quite cool about her being elevated, but because of what she was wearing, because of the dress, which was really innovative. That idea has been done in different ways. But when Gaga does it, it’s different; it’s a mic drop.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI’m fascinated by the choreography of “Poker Face” and the idea of the two queens. What’s the story behind the choreography there?\t\n\n\tI kept thinking, “What are visuals that people can resonate with and relate to?” With the chessboard idea, we ran through that being on different types of songs, and then I was like, “Wait for ‘Poker Face, it’s brilliant.’ It made sense, so we started to develop the story of this push and pull with her and a different version of herself. I thought a battle on a chessboard to “Poker Face” was sick, and being able to tape the squares in the studio was really fun, easy and effortless. Everyone knows how to play chess and putting that in her emotional storyline was really cool and powerful. It landed really strongly.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was the most challenging number to put together?\t\n\n\tProbably “Paparazzi” with the cape and crutches, because of the logistics of the cape. I love that song. When you listen to the lyrics, it can also be taken vulnerably. Stef and I thought it would be great to hear a ballad version, this slow, emotional rendition of ‘Paparazzi.'” She was coming out of the sandbox, representing a grave. Being an artist that can survive the test of time, which she has, has been such a testimony to her resilience, and how fearless and unapologetic she is. She came out from the grave, and “Paparazzi” was a journey of her soaring and finding her wings again. The cape represented that and showed how strong she is.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKevin Mazur/Getty Images for Live Nation\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of the grave, what is in that?\t\n\n\tIt’s kitty litter.\n\t\n\t\tWhat’s next for you?\t\n\n\tI’m releasing my own music. I’m signed to Diplo’s label. And I’ve just handed in a complete dance project that I’ve been working on all year, in my spare time. That’s coming out next month.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Trump will sit down for an interview on CBS’ “60 Minutes,” his first since suing the network last year in a case that ended with its parent company Paramount Global agreeing to pay a $16 million settlement. It will also mark Trump’s first appearance on the network since Paramount was acquired by David Ellison’s Skydance Media, and since the company acquired The Free Press and named its founder, Bari Weiss, editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n\t\n\n\tTrump is being interviewed by network correspondent Norah O’Donnell in Florida on Friday afternoon, a network spokesperson confirmed to Variety.\n\n\n\tThe booking represents a mending of a rift between Trump and CBS News. A month prior to the 2024 election, the Trump campaign turned down an offer to be interviewed by “60 Minutes” under the argument that it would not accept interruptions due to fact-checking. \n\n\n\tHis opponent, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, accepted a “60 Minutes” interview, in turn spurring a lawsuit against CBS News filed by Trump just days before the 2024 election. The filing alleged that “60 Minutes” tried to mislead voters by airing two different edits of remarks made in the interview with Harris.\n\n\tThough CBS and legal experts initially characterized the case as “meritless” and the company sought to have it thrown out, Paramount Global opted to pay $16 million towards Trump’s “presidential library” in July. The settlement came as Skydance Global sought to seek approval from the Trump-appointed leadership of the Federal Communications Commission for its acquisition of Paramount — a deal that has since closed.\n\t\n\n\tSince Ellison’s takeover of Paramount, the company has raised eyebrows for seeming to appease conservative audiences, particularly with CBS News anointing Weiss, who forged her brand as a columnist arguing against progressive politics.\n\n\tFor his part, Trump has voiced his approval of Paramount’s new direction.\n\n\t“[Oracle chairman] Larry Ellison is great, and his son David is great. They’re friends of mine. They’re big supporters of mine,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One in October. “They will make the right decisions. They’re going to revitalize CBS — hopefully, they’ll bring it back to its former glory. … It’s got great potential. CBS has great potential.” Following the Weiss hiring at CBS News, Trump told CNN, “I don’t expect them to become like Fox [News]. Just fair.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIs there such a thing as… an intimate arena? That may seem like the type of oxymoron that could only belong to the show-biz hype lexicon. But plenty of southern Californians would swear that it’s true, once they’ve been to the Acrisure Arena in Palm Desert, which in its three years open has turned into a sort of destination venue for music fans who like to see a superstar tour in a venue that’s just a little less than super-sized. That holds true not just for the local population of Coachella Valley residents but concertgoers from Los Angeles and even farther afield who, for now, consider it an almost well-kept secret of an alternative venue for certain tours. It’s worth a couple of hours on the freeway, for some, to see a Paul McCartney in a place where no seat counts as a nosebleed.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s kinda like the three little bears,” says John Page, senior VP of Acrisure Arena and the Coachella Valley Firebirds, the hockey team that plays there when Blink 182 isn’t. At a concert capacity of about 10,000 — about a third bigger than the Greek, but smaller by at least a third than the Forum, Crypto, Intuit Dome or Hollywood Bowl — “it’s not too big and it’s not too small.”\n\n\n\tBut what’s in it for the artists who deign to perform a show there, in addition to the larger SoCal markets? For starters, there’s just the ability to squeeze in one that’s just far enough from L.A. to not fall afoul of radius clauses for those other arenas. But more significantly, for some artists, there’s the ability to start a tour there and have rehearsals for days ahead of time in a place that — to borrow the three bears language, again — is not too far away from but also not too close to the watchful eyes of Los Angeles.\n\t\n\n\tSome of that was coming into play in September when the Acrisure Arena had a busier-than-usual period of what it called its “magnificent seven.” Over a two-week period, the venue put on what was the official tour opening for McCartney and the official tour closing for the Who (the latter’s final U.S. show ever, supposedly) in a matter of three days, providing strong evidence that the Palm Springs area offers the kind of creature comforts that make it appealing to hang around either right before or right after a major tour. In that same two-week time span, the arena also was the home for two Blink 182 concerts, a Maroon 5 show, a pre-season game for the Los Angeles Lakers, and the home season opener for the Firebirds, who are effectively the house band for the venue.\n\n\tIn attracting top-name talent for a venue just a little off the beaten track, it has not hurt that one of the principals in this Oak View Group development is veteran manager-mogul Irving Azoff, whose early bookings of a couple of his own clients there  — the Eagles and Harry Styles — surely acted as bait for other A-listers to know that they could do potential sellouts there, too.\n\n\tOn the night of McCartney’s show at the Acrisure, Azoff is holding court with a reporter alongside the backstage mini-mini golf course that is part of the Silvercrest Artist Compound lounge, which basically is this arena’s equivalent of the Forum Club. He’s explaining the origins of the place.\n\n\t“I’ve had a house here for many, many, many years and own a golf course with my partner here, and it’s been my winter place,” Azoff is saying. “So I know it well, and it just felt like the Coachella Valley was underserved. There became an opportunity to do something with the American Hockey League team, the B-team for the Kraken, who have been wildly successful. I think we’ve been pretty much the highest-grossing and attended American Hockey League team for three straight years. So the market supports it. The Lakers love to come down here for preseason and it sells right out. We do college football in November — Michigan State, Arizona, that rivalry. And then for concerts, you don’t make as much money here as you might at a stadium in L.A., but it’s a great stop for people. The building looks great, it sounds great…\n\t\n\n\tHe is interrupted by a visitor — his client, John Mayer. The rock star, suddenly aware that it’s an interview situation he’s stepped into, just takes over as formal interlocutor for a minute.\n\n\t“To what do you attribute this success right now you’re having at the arena?” Mayer asks, playing reporter. “It’s not in L.A. Do you think that Coachella has had something to do with sort of priming people’s minds? Has the Coachella trip sort of embedded that in the culture, coming out to Palm Springs to see a show?”\n\n\tAzoff is too amused to answer until Mayer takes his leave, but yes, he agrees, the answer was embedded in the musician’s question, or at least part of it was. “We get people from L.A., and San Diego’s just as close, as you know, and we get some Phoenix…” And beyond. “People like to travel, as the phenomenon people traveling for a Taylor Swift show proved, that the fans will come to you. And first of all, it’s the best winter weather in the country here, so people who come for a concert aren’t all coming just to go to a concert. There’s a lot to do down here.”\n\n\tPage, interviewed separately, says the geotargeting can be wildly different from show to show (or sporting event to sporting event). “It varies. The first show that we really dug into on this was Harry Styles. When we pulled our purchase metrics, I think it was between 3-5% of the purchasers for the two shows were from the Coachella Valley. And then the balance were from all over the place. We had 3-5% international buyers, as well.” On the opposite end of that scale, “certain events like our Latin/Hispanic shows are, I would say, 90% local.” \n\n\tWhat’s the attraction for out-of-towners, besides the chance to budget time to stay over one or two nights at a place with a nice pool (and maybe  a date shake at Hadley’s on the way)? Even for those who plan to make the trip from the greater L.A. area or back without a hotel stay — maybe most of all for those who don’t have a mini-vacation as part of the plan — there’s just the mere fact that a tour that may be sold out or only have terrible or pricy seats left “in town” may have better and more affordable tickets in Palm Desert. \n\n\t…And, that once inside, first-timers are inevitably surprised by how un-vast the auditorium feels, compared to Crypto, Intuit, et al. Describing it as living-room-like might be a stretch, but there’s no doubt that everyone who enters who’s used to the size and scope of major tours in L.A. knows they are benefitting from being in a secondary market that’s thisclose to a metropolis.\n\t\n\n\tThe difference in scale is part-real, part illusory. The Acrisure Arena has the same basic footprint as those bigger arenas. It just basically has what you’d consider the loge level as the only level, above the floor. (There’s a row of suites on top that has its own concourse and dining and seats 800 high-rollers, but it’s almost easy to miss.)\n\n\tAzoff explains how this size and shape came to be, partly out of practicality for this being a smaller market, and partly for other reasons.\n\n\t“There’s not a bad seat in this house,” Azoff explains, “because, ostensibly, it’s two-thirds of an arena. It’s just that we didn’t put the third deck on, because we didn’t think the demand was there. Well, we couldn’t have gotten permission to, anyway,” he adds, slightly correcting himself, “because it’s in a flight lane. Unless we wanted to dig the building down, that’s as high as we could build.” One man’s zoning restriction is another man’s intimacy-maker.\n\n\tIt would stand to reason that, with attendance necessarily cut down by a third or more from the biggest venues in L.A., tickets might need to cost more for everyone to meet their nut. But looking at ticket prices doesn’t necessarily bear that out. At least, there can be a lower-get-in-the-door cost than at L.A. shows, even if things tend to even out up top. One factor cited by some sources is a lack of union costs that affect ticket prices in major markets. There’s also a desire to look at the wide range of working-class to upper-upper-class residents in the Coachella Valley and have a price point for everyone, to fill the seats.\n\n\t“Even though we’re smaller,” says Page, “sometimes we have more price levels than some venues of our size just because they want to make sure that there’s enough pricing disparity to cover the people from Indio or Coachella as well as the people that are living in some of these country club communities in Indian Wells, La Quinta and Rancho Mirage. Everybody has really gathered enough information, now that we are going into our fourth year, so that they can create the right pricing dynamic so that everybody wins and, at the end of the day, everybody has an opportunity to get a fair-price ticket to see a first-rate artist. … You’ve got tremendous wealth in many cases (in the area). And then you’ve got an incredible blue-collar workforce that just loves to have an arena in their marketplace where they don’t have to drive two hours to see first-rate entertainment or sporting events. So, we punch above our weight in ability to take a gross to make sure that we can take care of a Harry Styles guarantee or a Paul McCartney date or the Who or having two Blink 182 shows.”\n\t\n\n\tLatin-focused entertainment, which, as noted above, draws more significantly from the Valley than most other types of shows, is a significant draw.\n\n\t“We just had Ana Gabrielle last month, second time through the marketplace, and she sold more tickets this time than the first time,” says Page. “We’ve had Peso Pluma two times. We just put Ricardo Arjona on sale. We’ve had a wide variety of Latin artists, some that of that new genre of music coming up, and then some of the older artists that have got such a tremendous following, like Los Tigres Del Norte.” Palomazo Norteño just performed, and the schedule for upcoming shows includes Jorge Medina and Josi Cuén.\n\n\tIt also includes Duran Duran, Cardi B, Tate McRae and “Gabby’s Dollhouse Live.” And hockey. Lots and lots of hockey.\n\n\t“Hockey in the desert” was considered a folly by some prior to opening, but as it turns out, there are a lot of “snowbirds” from Canada as well as the northern U.S. who are happy to buy season tickets and get cold for just a couple of hours a night and that’s it. (Beyond all the aforementioned demographics, the arena’s operators also count on drawing patrons from Riverside and the Inland Empire, who, faced with the choice of driving an equal distance to L.A. to the west or Palm Springs to the east, might favor the show or game with the least traffic at the point of destination.)\n\n\tProof-of-concept came when the arena did $36 million in gross ticket sales in its first six months after opening in December 2022.\n\n\tSays Page, “Our first three seasons, we’ve been the leader for the most part in most of the metrics that the American Hockey League recognizes — season ticket revenue, paid attendance. We’ve been number one or two in total attendance from the start and the inception of this team. But we’re constantly changing and evolving as well. For most (locals), we were starting to really understand that their threshold was coming to 36 games. So we made some really nice changes for our fans, like having intentional game plans. We’ve made some adjustments on our parking prices. We’re actually going to a 6:30 p.m. start for our weekday games, to really kind of give the families an opportunity to get here early and get home so they get their kids to bed, or, if you’re from an older demographic, you can get home before 10 now.”\n\t\n\n\t“Our analysis from a hockey perspective” was valuable for overall planning, says Page. “If you look at just the static population here between the nine communities, it’s approximately 500,000. And when you compare us to the rest of the American Hockey League, we’re the third-smallest market. But from 500,00 permanent residents, this market doubles to north of a million people once you get into the end of October through the 1st of May. So summertime’s slow, but even then there’s still this great core people that are desiring entertainment, and we’re providing that. But when it swells, it’s a completely different animal. It truly morphs for that five- to six-month period. So it’s a real interesting market that we’re constantly learning more about all the time.”\n\n\tThe off-season is when it’s best for someone like a McCartney to come in and build in time for set-up and rehearsals for an entire tour. He’s not the first to do so; Olivia Rodrigo did the same, rehearsing and starting her first arena tour here at the beginning of 2024. The building isn’t so busy, if hockey isn’t around, that they can’t turn the venue over to a superstar for a bit for whatever they need to do, in a lot of cases. \n\n\t“When we began discussions a couple years ago about the potential to have Sir Paul here at the building, we went through all the amenities and providing enough time for them to come in and do technical rehearsals, band rehearsals, whatever it may be,” Page says. “We carved out a full week, and even a couple days after the date, just so that they could have enough time to do what they needed on the front end and take their time on the back end, whether that was loading trucks or going through some of the technical aspects of the tour so they could have everything buttoned up before they went onto their next stop. So, we want to accommodate as much as we can.”\n\n\tAzoff also emphasizes what a nice landing spot it makes for artists about to go visit an intinerary’s worth of places with fewer creature comforts to come. “As a manager,” he says, “I just give everybody the building to rehearse. If the days are dark, just take it. Costs here are way lower, and the ambience is great. Even though it’s a smaller building, you can hang your full production. Like, Paul’s production is the same production he’ll hang in Vegas at Allegiant Stadium a few nights later. So it’s a great, great place to start.” \n\t\n\n\tAs for the Coachella connection… there isn’t one, apart from, as Mayer said, getting all of Los Angeles and its surroundings used to the driveability of the area. They’d like to change that, down the road.\n\n\t“Our biggest issue with respect to radius clauses is the two Coachellas and Stagecoach,” says Page. “We get into that time period now that they’ve announced the Coachella and Stagecoach participants. We try to kind of counterprogram around that. We’d love to do more with Paul Tollette and AEG on that. But, you know, it is what it is. We understand what they’ve created, and we want to be here if they want to look at putting something in here as well during that timeframe.”\n\n\tAlthough the venues aren’t on the same scale, there is casino competition, particularly from the Yaamava’ midway between L.A. and Palm Springs in Highland, which offers a really intimate experience for fans of some of the acts who play arenas, with limited enough seating that the get-in-the-door price can be more daunting. Says Page, “We firmly believe that you can play a Yaamava’ Theater and then play the Acrisure Arena as well. It’s one plus one is three in my mind, for the artists that can do two (extra) play dates and not skip a market. Those are things that, going into our fourth year, we will continue to push and explain to people and hopefully get them on board with their routing and touring programming.”\n\n\tAzoff wishes the area around the Acrisure had more of the development they foresaw, but there have been snags in that. “There’s been a couple false starts on people building sound stages down here, and recording studios. It’s really hard to develop stuff down here. There’s real problems getting power and infrastructure, because it’s exploded. There’s been an inability to develop around the arena because you can’t get entitlements here because there’s flood plane issues, there’s power issues. You know, we would’ve built more. There should have been a hotel here already, and we would’ve built out rehearsal spaces.\n\n\t“But,” he says, not to complain, “this thing’s here to stay. It’s great.” And if there’s a lack of development immediately surrounding the arena, still? It only makes it seem more oasis-like, which is the feeling a lot of desert travelers will have once they step inside from the heat to see a Beatle in a very sub-Shea Stadium situation.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers for “The Witcher” Season 4, now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tThere’s a new witcher on the hunt in the Continent.\n\n\tLiam Hemsworth steps into the monster-killing shoes of Geralt in Netflix’s “The Witcher” Season 4, taking over after original star Henry Cavill departed after Season 3. The story picks up in the aftermath of last season, with Geralt, Ciri (Freya Allan) and Yennefer (Anya Chalotra) all separated and searching for each other.\n\t\n\n\tThey’ve each assembled a new group of allies in their hunt: Geralt has his bard buddy Jaskier (Joey Batey), vampire Regis (Laurence Fishburne) and others on his search; Yennefer leads the sorceresses to find her adopted daughter, Ciri, and lover, Geralt; and Ciri has assumed a new identity as Falka, banded together with the Rats, a group of outlaws, and starts a relationship with a criminal named Mistle (Juliette Alexandra). \n\n\n\tGeralt and Yennefer are determined to stop Emperor Emhyr var Emreis (Bart Edwards) from fulfilling an ancient prophecy — which involves marrying his own daughter, Ciri — and gaining enough power to rule the entire Continent. Luckily, they soon realize that the marriage is a sham and Emhyr is holding a fake Ciri hostage to wed. But there are many other threats out there, like the evil wizard Vilgefortz (Mahesh Jadu) who attacks Yennefer’s forces in the climactic Battle of Montecalvo. With the help of the other witchers, they defeat Vilgefortz, but Geralt’s mentor Vesemir (Peter Mullan) and sorcerer Istredd (Royce Pierreson) both die. \n\n\tOn Ciri’s side, the deranged bounty hunter Leo Bonhart (Sharlto Copely) is hot on her and the Rats’ trail. In the finale, he corners them and brutally beheads each of the Rats, taking Ciri as his prisoner. Also in the final moments of the show, Geralt is finally knighted after the Battle of the Bridge, and Emhyr sends out a mysterious monster to follow his scent and kill him.\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety, showrunner Lauren Schmidt-Hissrich discusses all those deaths, where Geralt and Ciri will find themselves in the upcoming fifth and final season and much more.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLet’s start with Ciri. She’s starts the season off with the Rats and grows close to Mistle, which is portrayed very differently in the books. Why did you want to introduce a love interest for her?\t\n\n\tWe definitely wanted to take a page from the books, and we played around with several darker and lighter versions. Where we wanted to land is something that felt like Ciri was actually turning over some of herself to this person, that there was a vulnerability that we’d never been able to see before. That’s why we started with it. For the past three seasons, Ciri has been a princess, the most powerful person on the Continent, someone’s daughter, someone’s granddaughter. What starts to happen when she lives life for herself? And the truth is, is it’s not really a storybook romance. It’s no “happy ever after” for her. But we did want to give her these moments of questioning. Is this love? Is this what it feels like to be in love? Because these are things that Ciri has never experienced. She’s never had the ability to have these normal human experiences, and it doesn’t end on a nice note. When she leaves Mistle, everything is thrown into question. She thought that she was able to build up this mask of this person that she wanted to be. The truth is that Mistle always saw through it. Is it love? Is it not love? I don’t know that I could answer that.\n\t\n\t\tAll of the Rats get gruesomely beheaded by Leo Bonhart. How is that going to stick with Ciri going into the final season?\t\n\n\tWe made a really conscious decision to not end this season on the characters’ higher moments. When we’re doing Seasons 4 and 5 back to back, in some ways it feels like one big season that we split. It really is one long journey back toward each other. We thought it would be interesting, as we’re chugging toward the end, to put all of our characters in the darkest places imaginable because we know that some redemption is going to come. This is going to be Ciri letting go and touching those deepest, darkest places within herself that she’s always pushed away. She’s said several times across the series that she worries that there’s something wrong with her. She worries that death follows her, that she is a monster inside. Once she deals with the heartbreak and loss of the Rats, we get to see her start to access that for a while. It’s her baptism of fire that needs to happen before she can be redeemed.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of sad deaths, we also get Vesemir back this season, but he goes down swinging in a fight against Vilgefortz. Why was this the right time to say goodbye to him?\t\n\n\tPeople who are fans of the books know that the witchers do appear again in the books. We haven’t seen them since Season 2. So we wanted to make sure that we were reintroducing our audience to who these witchers were, their relationship with Geralt, the world, where they see themselves in that hierarchy and the fact that they have always tried to stay neutral in the past. That’s something we’ve seen Geralt go through, his desire to stay neutral and his realization at the end of Season 3 that he can’t. So we want his brothers-in-arms to go through a similar experience. \n\n\tThat was the first reason of bringing them in this season. Obviously, they’re not in this portion of the books. The bigger thing we needed in terms of deaths, audiences sometimes worry that we kill people just for shock value — and yes, I think Vesemir’s death is very shocking — but the more important thing is what it does to the people around him. When Geralt learns about it from Yennefer, we see him taken to a new place. He has lost his father now, and he is pushing to be a father to Ciri, a role that he never expected to step into. When you lose someone important in your world, it makes you reconsider your own priorities. This was the right engine for Geralt at the end of the season, as he’s actually experiencing some of his dreams coming true at the end of Season 4. The thing that he’s dreamt of the most, becoming a white knight, he’s able to get. Yet partially through the death of Vesemir, he knows that time is not on his side. If he is going to reunite his family, he has to give up that dream in order to pursue the dream of family. So it felt like the right time, not just for story and shock, but for Geralt and what he needed.\n\t\n\t\tThe death count seems this season seems pretty high. Will next season have around the same number of deaths?\t\n\n\tYes, the death count this season was huge, also think the death count of people who were really important to us. Anyone who’s familiar with this source material knows that it’s not a happy ending, and I do think that the body count just keeps on growing from here. It feels fitting. Obviously it’s going to be a goodbye to the series. We have to start to say some real goodbyes to these characters.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSusie Allnutt/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGeralt is finally knighted at the end of this season, officially becoming Geralt of Rivia. How will that help him or hinder him next season?\t\n\n\tSince Season 1, Geralt has wanted to be a knight. We see him as a little boy and he’s slaying dragons with a wooden sword. We know that this is a deep-seated dream within him. Even when he became a witcher, we start to hear these lessons that Vesemir is trying to impart on him, which is that you don’t kill for revenge. You don’t kill to be a hero. You kill because you have to. One of the most meaningful things that we were able to express for Geralt this season is the flashback when he explains to Ciri that “Geralt of Rivia” isn’t an honorific. It’s not his real name. It’s one he gave himself to improve his contracts. That is one of the first things that he and Ciri bonded over, where she started to open up to him. For Geralt, it should feel like a moment of celebration and achieving what he always wanted. But for us, it’s more proof to show how the character has changed and how his goals have changed over the season. This man who wanted nothing and no one, who wanted to be a part of nothing larger than himself, suddenly gives up his greatest dream in order to pursue his daughter and the woman that he loves. That is the most poignant shift for him that we’ve seen.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve spoken a lot already about Liam Hemsworth stepping into Geralt’s shoes this season. Was there anything that surprised you about his performance once you began shooting?\t\n\n\tOn day one, we were all nervous. We all had no idea what to expect. Liam has spoken extensively about putting on the black leathers, contacts and the wig and that process of not becoming yourself. What was most surprising to me when he stepped on set was how comfortable he was and how at ease he was. It was amazing. I know the physical work that he put in, but the mental work that he must have put in to step onto set, not be fidgeting or worried that he was mimicking something — it was incredible. That ease and comfort seeps across both seasons. You really see him comfortable in this character. Honestly, it’s the right time for Geralt, who’s experiencing these emotions he’s never experienced before. Liam got to bring an emotional side to Geralt that we had not seen. In some ways, it’s just perfect timing where the new actor came in to a place where this character was in a state of flux.\n\t\n\n\tWhat I was surprised with is how easily he slipped into the rhythm that we had started to build in Season 1, which is saying things when things needed to be said, knowing when it was the perfect time to just sigh or grunt or say “fuck” and move on. It came so naturally to him. Despite the stories being super heavy, Geralt has a sense of humor and wit about him that feels very authentic, because that’s how people move through trauma. You get to see these beautiful moments of bonding, friendship and family amidst the darkness. It was a lovely surprise. It’s exactly what we wanted and hoped for.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSusie Allnutt/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI loved Regis’ animated backstory and Jaskier’s musical in the middle of the season. How did you decide to change up the format and present their origin stories like that?\t\n\n\tWe love to play with structure and form on the show. This was a different chance to do something. It started out of production needs. We had this backstory for Regis that we knew we wanted to tell. We also knew that we did not have the time and resources to tell it the way that it needed to be told. Our episodes are shot across, in general, about 18 days. This was unlike anything we’d done before. We needed to be here for Regis, there for Jaskier, here for Zoltan. We knew we couldn’t accomplish it, but what if we actually played with form and the genre of these moments? Regis was the first one that came to be. We could accomplish the breadth and depth of that flashback with animation. That took so much planning. Animation is a much, much slower, more methodical process. We actually started that animation long before we started shooting Season 4. Laurence got to come in for approvals on his character design. It’s actually modeled after one of his sons, so it is meant to look like Laurence would look as a young man. Jaskier’s came next. I have to say, pitching a musical to Netflix wasn’t a swinging yes out of the gate. It took some movement and pushing, but we’re so happy with it. There’s no better way to tell Jaskier’s story.\n\t\n\t\tWe meet Nimue (Sha Dessi) this season, who seems like she may cross paths with our main characters. Will we see more of her next season?\t\n\n\tWe loved setting up Nimue and Stribog the storyteller like a device. It’s a way of helping our audience adjust to seeing Liam’s face, to seeing this new Geralt. It’s a way to revisit moments from the past, to really get our characters together. It’s one of the huge reasons that we open the season like that. Otherwise, Ciri, Geralt and Yen are on three different paths. We never see them together. We knew that if we went back into the past, we could have these moments of the family united and remind our audience what they’re fighting for. It should feel a little bit like a device at the beginning. By the end of the season, Stribog says to her, “Maybe you have a bigger role in the story. Maybe you are the one who can change the story.” Absolutely in Season 5, we’re going to be stepping back in Nimue’s world a little bit more. We’re going to have an understanding of how stories are changed by the storyteller. But if you think about it, Nimue we say is 100 years in the future, so if she’s going to intersect in the story, it’s a little bit of a hint as to what some of Ciri’s powers might be as well.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCan you tease what kind of monster Emhyr is sending after Geralt in the final moments of this season?\t\n\n\tOne of the things that we had to cope with in Seasons 4 and 5 is that by this point in the books, Geralt really isn’t a monster hunter anymore. He’s not fighting monsters very often. He has reformulated his goal to solely get to his family. But, of course, we love the monsters, and we know Ciri is the titular witcher of the series and of the books. We know that monster hunting has to stay important to her and her world. So we invented a ton of monsters to putting out there. What we really love is this idea that a monster is specifically coming from Emhyr. Just as Geralt is trying to move forward in Season 5, there’s this piece of his past that keeps coming for him.\n\t\n\t\tThere was a two and a half year break between Season 3 and 4. Will there be as long of a wait to get to Season 5?\t\n\n\tHopefully shorter. Two and a half years is never ideal. Obviously, we had a writers strike in the middle of that, which really pushed Season 4 back. So fingers crossed. We are working so hard in post, we wrapped almost a month ago. We’re we’re pushing ahead and hope to be able to deliver it audiences a little bit sooner.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

Justin's in a shark suit and his son Hadrien is a bloodied surfer whose board is missing a chunk from a shark bite.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          It's a pretty cool father-son costume ... even before considering the reference to KP.\n      \n\n          Remember, when Katy performed the Super Bowl halftime show back in 2015, a couple backup dancers behind her went viral ... they were wearing similar shark costumes to what Justin's got here.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Justin doesn't mention Katy in his post about the costume, simply saying ... \"Ready for Halloween with Hadrien: he’s the surfer, I’m the shark (to his left). We built the costume together — a little father-son Halloween teamwork.\"\n      \n    \n          But it's pretty clear Justin is giving a nod to Katy ... he mentioned he's \"to his left\" and the left shark was the one most folks remember from her Super Bowl performance.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Bonus points for the homemade costume and the throwback pop culture reference!!!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Katy Perry\n              \n                          \n                Justin Trudeau\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Super Bowl\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Halloween\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tIn Yorgos Lanthimos’ latest film “Bugonia,” Emma Stone plays a powerful CEO who’s abducted by two conspiracy-obsessed men, portrayed by Jesse Plemons and newcomer Aidan Delbis.But when it comes to conspiracy theories off-screen, one in particular has captured Plemons’ imagination.\n\n\t“Well, Jesse has one that he’s really been harping on,” Stone told Variety on Tuesday night at the New York premiere inside the MoMa. “Did he tell you already?”When asked to share his favorite conspiracy theory, Plemons didn’t hesitate: “Birds aren’t real. Which is true. It’s not real.”\n\n\n\t“Yeah, the birds,” Stone laughed. “The birds aren’t real. I mean, I believe birds are real. But it is interesting walking around New York now with so many pigeons and thinking, ‘What if all of these — right here, right now — were little drones?’”\n\t\n\n\tComedian Stavros Halkias, who delivers a scene-stealing turn as a small-town police officer, said he’s drawn to another enduring internet myth.\n\n\t“I don’t think they’re actually lizard people, but effectively, the people that are ruling the world aren’t human,” Halkias explained, referring to the reptilian conspiracy theory. “They’re more worried about getting rich than anything else. It’s an interesting metaphor trying to explain the evil that’s ruining everybody’s life by saying, ‘Oh, there must be a different species.’ It’s like, ‘Nah, they’re just kind of shitty people.’”\n\n\tOne warm-blooded creative who continues to rise above the chaos is Lanthimos himself, who’s built a reputation as a true actors’ director. His creative partnership with Stone, in particular, has become one of the most formidable collaborations in Hollywood. \n\n\t“Yorgos is someone I’m so inspired by,” said Alicia Silverstone, who reunites with Lanthimos on “Bugonia” for the first time since 2017’s “The Killing of a Sacred Deer.” “He’s so prolific and talented. I love being able to freefall with him. I’ll do anything — maybe not anything, but when he calls, I don’t even need to read [the script].”\n\n\tSome of Lanthimos’ past heavy-hitters include “The Lobster,” “The Favourite” and “Poor Things,” which earned Stone her second Oscar. All of his films share a quirky, R-rated sensibility — but will Lanthimos ever expand his horizons and make something more family-friendly?“I have done one, it’s called ‘Dogtooth,’” Lanthimos laughed. “It’s a family-friendly movie.” “Dogtooth,” the Greek filmmaker’s breakout 2009 feature, is a psychological drama about a father who keeps his adult children locked inside an isolated compound, manipulating their reality through control, deprivation and deceit.\n\t\n\n\t“I don’t really think about it in those terms,” Lanthimos explained. “I just make the films I want to make, and you know, they come out the way they come out. So, who knows?”\n\n\t“Bugonia” opens in select theaters on Oct. 24 before expanding nationwide Oct. 31.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBased on the iconic 1986 novel by Stephen King and serving as a prequel to the 2017 and 2019 “It” films, HBO’s “It: Welcome to Derry,” created by Andy Muschietti, Barbara Muschietti and Jason Fuchs, is an intricate psychological horror that blends history, the supernatural, race relations and intense fear. The series is a masterfully woven and terrifying tale about the origins of the monstrous Pennywise the Clown (portrayed by Bill Skarsgård, as in the movies). The show may be set in the past, but its themes have never echoed louder today.\n\t\n\n\t“It: Welcome to Derry” opens on a snowy January day in 1962 in Derry, Maine. Having been run out of the movie theater for entry without payment and refusing to go back to his abusive home, a 12-year-old boy (Miles Ekhardt) sucks fiercely on his emotional support pacifier while trying to hitchhike his way out of town. Before long, an unassuming couple stops to pick him up. Almost immediately, the boy realizes something gravely sinister is amiss. Yet, stricken with terror, he has no recourse to escape the vehicle. \n\n\n\tFour months later, U.S. Air Force Major Leroy Hanlon (Jovan Adepo) lands in Derry, where he is slated to be stationed for his latest assignment. He’s eagerly anticipating the arrival of his wife, Charlotte (Taylour Paige), and 12-year-old son, Will (Blake James), so they can move into their new home in town. For now, the flyboy will be resting in the barracks. Unfortunately, some of his comrades don’t receive him warmly. Racism certainly isn’t a foreign experience for Leroy, but what does stick out to him are the oddities of this particular Air Force base. Leroy and his friend Pauly Russo (Rudy Mancuso) immediately notice the numerous restricted areas, which appear to interfere with sacred Indigenous grounds. Additionally, a fellow Black airman, Dick Hallorann (Chris Chalk), has unexplained privileges and unparalled access to the highly ranked General Shaw (James Remar). \n\t\n\n\tElsewhere at Derry High School, Lilly (Clara Stack) has returned from a stint in Juniper Hill asylum. She’s almost as ostracized as her Black classmate Ronnie (Amanda Christine), whose father Hank (Stephen Rider), the movie theater’s projectionist, is being blamed for the disappearance of the boy from four months earlier. Desperate for some semblance of normalcy and a return to the life she knew before Juniper Hill, Lilly teams up with Ronnie, who is determined to clear her father’s name, as well as their classmates, Phil (Jack Molloy) and Teddy (Mikkal Karim-Fidler), in an attempt to find out what really happened on that snowy January evening. The motley crew, which later includes Will and Rich (Arian S. Cartaya), embark on a journey of otherworldly fear and horrors. \n\n\tIt cannot be overstated how outstanding the younger cast is. The foundation of “It,” from the novel to the films, and now with this series, examines how evil seeps, morphs and changes the lives of children forever. The cast’s emotional depth and depictions of fright and panic really elevate “It: Welcome to Derry.” Stack’s Lilly particularly stands out as a young girl still terrorized by the traumatic loss of her father, but desperate to save her friends from experiencing similar kinds of anguish. \n\n\tAmid the paranoia of the Cold War, the eight-episode season (critics received five for review) has many eerie elements, including its parallels to the present day. Black and Indigenous Derry residents are barely tolerated, but the horrors of the Jim Crow South, where the National Guard is beating down protesters, play on television screens in the background. Moreover, the show takes the trope of the Magical Negro, bending and twisting it on itself to prove Black people aren’t required to fix the broken systems they didn’t create. The series also illustrates the narrow-mindedness of adults, unable to understand and reconcile the plight of children until they are forced to face the things they have previously refused to see.  \n\n\tThough the theme of childhood innocence remains at the core of “It: Welcome to Derry,” the show expands even further to address the issues that continually haunt the essence of the American experience. Abuse, racism, psychological trauma, infringement on Indigenous land and militarization are all significant elements here. When it’s all said and done, “It: Welcome to Derry” is a worthy prequel series that not only details the emergence of Pennywise, but also turns a lens on society to showcase how truly horrifying we can be as human beings.\n\t\n\n\t“It: Welcome to Derry” premieres Oct. 26 on HBO and HBO Max at 9 p.m. ET with new episodes dropping weekly on Sundays.\n",

    "description": "\n\tJeff Daniels tapped into his musical side during an interview with Nicole Wallace on MSNBC’s “Deadline: White House,” delivering a live performance ",
    "body": "\n\tJeff Daniels tapped into his musical side during an interview with Nicole Wallace on MSNBC’s “Deadline: White House,” delivering a live performance of an acoustic protest song he wrote titled “Crazy World.” The song, which was inspired by the No Kings protest against the Trump administration, is “how I cope,” the actor explained.\n\n\t“Crazy World” finds Daniels choosing to focus on the sweeter things in life despite all of America’s political chaos. As Daniels sings in the chorus: “It’s nice to know in a world full of hate, there’s someone out there still making love.” The actor sings lovingly in the verses about seeing a “young girl smiling” and watching an elderly couple walking together, fleeting moments that hold so much more meaning since “this crazy world’s gone crazy.”\n\t\n\n\tDaniels has long been an outspoken critic of Trump. He made headlines over the summer for slamming Trump voters by saying: “I hope you’re losing tons of money, those of you who thought this would be OK. My question is, what are you guys going to do about it?” \n\n\n\tIn his latest interview with Wallace, Daniels remained hopeful that Trump voters are starting to see how the president is not delivering on his 2024 election promises such as lowering the cost of groceries. Does this mean Trump supporters might have a change of heart come the midterms? Daniels is optimistic. \n\n\t“I think those who voted for him because they didn’t like Kamala or don’t like Democrats are paying attention to if things cost more,” Daniels said. “That was one of the things he promised, like any president promises. ‘I’m going to lower prices.’ If he does, he’s a hero come the midterms. If he doesn’t, they are going to notice that.”\n\t\n\n\tDaniels also addressed Trump’s controversial response to the No King protests via an AI video of Trump flying over protesters and dropping feces on them (or “spewing excrement,” as Daniels described it).\n\n\t“Nixon wouldn’t have done it, Reagan wouldn’t have done it… neither Bush would’ve done it,” Daniels said about Trump’s immature response. “I think people in the midwest, where I am from, we value our decency and civility… I think it matters. If he doesn’t deliver on the economy like he promised he would, that stuff will start to add up and we’ll get tired of it and we will vote for change. \n\n\tDaniels often slams Trump for using social media to bully the people he does not like, explaining over the summer: “We’ve lost decency, we’ve lost civility, we’ve lost respect for the rule of law — lost it. We have normalized verbal abuse on the internet. We’ve normalized bullying; much as the woke generation tried to, you know, change that, it’s back.”\n\n\t“I mean, nobody has great things to say about politicians. They never have,” Daniels added at the time. “Go back to Mark Twain. But ideally, we’re supposed to elect the best of us. Not the worst of us. He’s everything that’s wrong with not just America but with being a human being.”\n\n\tWatch Daniels’ latest interview on MSNBC in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Round Top Film Festival announced today that it will honor Chris O’Hara with its second annual Maverick Stunt Award, presented by Variety, on Nov. 9.  \n\n\tA 25-year industry veteran, O’Hara earned a Taurus World Stunt Award for best 2nd unit director/stunt coordinator for his work on 2024’s “The Fall Guy,” starring Ryan Gosling. His other credits include doubling Matt Damon in “The Bourne Supremacy” and Bradley Cooper in “The Hangover” franchise and such films as “Baby Driver,” “Jurassic World,” “Venom,” “Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,” “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” and “Fight Club.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’m thrilled and deeply honored to receive the Maverick Stunt Award at the 2025 Round Top Film Festival,” said O’Hara in a statement. “I love how this festival embraces independent filmmakers from all walks of life, celebrating diverse voices and bold storytelling. Their recognition of stunt design as a vital part of cinematic artistry is truly significant, and it underscores their commitment to championing innovation and creativity. I’m beyond excited to attend the Round Top Film Festival and be part of this vibrant celebration of cinema.”\n\n\n\tFounded by mother-daughter duo Shanna Schanen and Skylar Schanen, the Round Top Film Festival held its inaugural event in November 2024 in Round Top, Texas, located roughly halfway between Austin and Houston. It will return to the tiny town (population: 95) – best known for its triannual antique show that attracts more than 100,000 visitors each year – for its second edition, which will run from Nov. 6-9.\n\t\n\n\tThe presentation of the Maverick Stunt Award, honoring “an outstanding professional in the stunt industry whose innovative contributions redefine the craft of action storytelling,” will be followed by a conversation with Variety associate editor Todd Longwell. The program will also feature a pair of panel discussions, “From Combat to Camera,” moderated by last year’s Maverick Stunt Award honoree, R.J. Casey (“Inception,” “Dunkirk,” “Extraction 2”), and “From the Jump: Film and TV Stunt Designers in Conversation,” moderated by second unit director and stunt coordinator Tom Struthers (“The Dark Knight” trilogy, “Dune”). The latter panel will feature Vic Armstrong (“Raiders of the Lost Ark,” “Die Another Day”), who’ll also be receiving Round Top’s Lifetime Achievement Award in Stunts.\n\n\tFilms screening at Round Top include Richard Linklater’s “Nouvelle Vague” and the closing night selection, Noah Baumbach’s “Jay Kelly,” starring George Clooney. The festival’s jurors are director Leslie Zemeckis (“Behind the Burly Q”), screenwriter Marc Klein (“Serendipity”), actors Marié Botha (“The Penguin”) and Mariel Hemingway (“Personal Best”), and producer Meryl Poster (“Chicago”).\n",

    "body": "\n\tStacey Gross, a perky meteorologist who uses a thermos of Prosecco and a stream of peppy banalities as crutches, has been taking audiences on an emotional roller coaster ever since “Weather Girl” debuted in 2024 at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The show deftly veers between comedy and tragedy, using a local news staple’s breakdown to issue dire warnings about consumerism and global warming. \n\n\t“Those subjects can feel like proselytizing or editorializing unless they’re funny and enjoyable,” says Brian Watkins, the play’s author. “That’s really what I went for. How can you sort of smile through the dark here? I’m really fond of this quote from Harold Clurman, who ran the Group Theater, ‘Make them laugh, and while their mouths are open, pour truth in.’ That was a great compass for me.”\n\t\n\n\tThe solo show, written for and performed by Watkins’ partner, Julia McDermott, doled out a lot of painful truths with its recent sold-out run at Brooklyn’s St. Ann’s Warehouse and during an acclaimed stint in London, but audiences on both sides of the Atlantic also embraced the play’s manic absurdity. The production has been likened to “Network,” and it does feel like what Paddy Chayefsky might have written had he stumbled across TikTok. \n\n\n\tHollywood, unsurprisingly, has come calling. After an intense bidding war, Netflix snapped up the rights to the play and has enlisted Watkins to turn the briskly paced production into a limited series (the streamer pulled off something similar with “Baby Reindeer, which began life at Edinburgh as a one-man show). The Netflix version of “Weather Girl” will expand the scope of the action beyond Stacey and will include people she dates, members of her family and colleagues at the Fresno, Calif. TV station where she works.\n\t\n\n\t“We’re building the world of this weather girl’s life and what she’s going through,” says Watkins, who has written the pilot and is working on other episodes. “It’s really fun to write these new characters that are only briefly mentioned in the play, or don’t even exist in the play. It’s scratched the itch for me to make this a love letter to California. That’s one thing that the TV form has really opened up for me — exploring how California is truly a character in this.”\n\n\tMcDermott will reprise her role as Stacey and serve as a producer on the project alongside A24, Ginger’s Amanda Burrell and Team Downey’s Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey, who will act as executive producers. Watkins is set to direct the first episode of the series. The Downeys, who previously worked with A24 on HBO’s adaptation of “The Sympathizer,”  got involved after watching the show in London. \n\n\t“It starts and I go, ‘OK, McDermott’s really, really good.’ But then I go, ‘Watkins has created this whole world,'” Robert Downey Jr. says. “And I think, this is a best case scenario. Like this is that trifecta where you have a great writer, a great director and you have a great performer. This is all about putting a performance and a character dead front and center in your face to say that theater is alive and vital.”\n\n\tSusan Downey says Watkins’ early drafts have been impressive. “He knows exactly how to expand the world and to give Julia even more to do. He’s offering a deeper exploration of themes and characters that there wasn’t time to explore on stage. I’ve seen him break things open in a way that’s really promising.” \n\n\tOn a recent Friday morning in Brooklyn, Watkins seems amazed that “Weather Girl” has been so widely embraced and that the show may soon be in front of millions of Netflix subscribers. He and McDermott have collaborated previously and “Weather Girl” was initially just his attempt to make her laugh. \n\n\t“I was writing for Julia,” he says. “I wanted to do something that showed her range from the artificial ingenue all the way to the primal sort of truth-telling Cassandra figure. And, of course, I hoped she’d be amused by the whole thing. But the piece has just taken on a life of its own.” \n\n\tThe show has also evolved, clocking in at just under an hour in Edinburgh and now topping 70 minutes in the U.S. as Watkins has added material. “Weather Girl” is set during a series of devastating fires in Fresno. It was written before last January’s forest fires in Southern California killed dozens of people, prompting mass evacuations and causing billions of dollars in property damage. \n\t\n\n\t“When the fires happened, the play took on this much different shadow and made this feel more urgent to do,” says Watkins. \n\n\t“Weather Girl” may not have had its final curtain call. Watkins hopes to mount at least one more production in New York and he’s fielding offers in places like Australia and the U.K. \n\n\t“We want to offer it to as many audiences as possible,” he says. “We’d love to bring it to Los Angeles at some point.” \n\n\tFor now, Watkins is spending a lot of his time and energy figuring out a way to transfer the play’s energy and immediacy to a different medium. \n\n\t“If you just try to copy it, you lose the essence of what made it work,” says Watkins. “We’re trying to take ‘Weather Girl’ in a different direction and lean into creating something original.” \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Big Break” is out of the bunker.\n\n\tThe Golf Channel is reviving the sports competition series after it was canceled in 2015. Taking place at Horseshoe Bay Resort in Texas, Season 24 will debut in August 2026 in partnership with Good Good Golf, ending the show’s 11-year hiatus.\n\n\t“Big Break” pits highly skilled golfers, including amateurs and professionals, against each other in a variety of skills challenges, including the show’s signature “Glass Break” and “Flop Wall” segments, which will return in Season 24. The winner is typically awarded exemptions into professional golf tournaments, including the PGA Tour, LPGA Tour, DP World Tour and more. The winner of Season 24 will earn automatic entry into the PGA Tour’s Good Good Championship, taking place in November 2026.\n\t\n\n\tBlair O’Neal, who won the 2010 Dominican Republic edition of “Big Break,” will host the season. Members of Good Good Golf will be featured throughout, including Brad Dalke and Sean Walsh as two of the 12 contestants, Matt Scharff as co-host and Garrett Clark and Bubbie Broders as non-playing team captains.\n\n\n\t“Bringing back ‘Big Break’ in partnership with Good Good Golf is as good as it gets. ‘Big Break’ is a Golf Channel institution which defined golf reality entertainment for 23 seasons. Good Good Golf is creating today’s version of golf entertainment and has redefined what ‘reality’ content really is. These two golf contents brands will be a very powerful combination,” said Tom Knapp, EVP and general manager of Golf Channel.\n\n\tMatt Kendrick, CEO and founder of Good Good Golf, added: “‘Big Break’ has always held a special place in the world of golf entertainment, and being part of its return alongside Golf Channel is an incredible milestone for us. This collaboration reflects the evolution of golf culture and highlights just how much the game — and Good Good — have progressed.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“High Potential” has cast Aiden Turner in a Season 2 guest star role. \n\n\tTurner will appear in the midseason finale as Rhys, who is described as “a quick-witted, well-tailored art recovery specialist with the tenacity of a prosecutor and the instincts of a seasoned detective. Equal parts cultured and street savvy, Rhys navigates the murky world of stolen masterpieces.”\n\n\tA first-look clip of Turner in the midseason finale can be seen below. The episode will air Oct. 28 at 10 p.m. ET/PT and stream the next day on Hulu. \n\t\n\n\tTurner is best known for his long stint on the popular soap opera “All My Children.” He famously played Aidan Devane in over 500 episodes of the series between 2002 and 2009. Turner also starred in the soap opera “If Loving You Is Wrong” from creator Tyler Perry. His other credits include shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D” and “NCIS: Los Angeles,” as well as films like “Mindcage” and “Hunting Souls.”\n\n\tHe is repped by NTA Talent Agency and Brave Artists Management.\n\n\t“High Potential” debuted its second season in September. Kaitlin Olson returns as Morgan, “a single mom with an exceptional mind, whose unconventional knack for solving crimes leads to an unusual and unstoppable partnership with a by-the-book seasoned detective (Daniel Sunjata).”\n\n\tThe cast also includes Javicia Leslie as Daphne, Deniz Akdeniz as Lev “Oz” Ozdil, Amirah J as Ava, Matthew Lamb as Elliot, Steve Howey as Nick Wagner and Judy Reyes as Selena. \n\n\tThe series is based on the French drama “Haut Potentiel Intellectuel (HPI).” Drew Goddard developed the American version and executive produces via Goddard Textiles along with Sarah Esberg. Todd Harthan serves as executive producer and showrunner. Olson also executive produces, as does Marc Halsey. 20th Television is the studio. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Materialists” will be available to stream on HBO Max starting Nov. 7 after earning an impressive $104 million at the worldwide box office over the summer.\n\n\tCeline Song’s sophomore feature follows Dakota Johnson as a New York City matchmaker named Lucy, who finds herself at a romantic crossroads. On one hand, there’s the affluent bachelor Harry (Pedro Pascal), who offers material security. On the other, there’s her ex-boyfriend John (Chris Evans), who remains as financially unstable as he was when they first dated. Lucy must figure out what kind of romantic partner she wants as she also navigates existential questions around her line of work.\n\t\n\n\tThe supporting cast includes Zoë Winters, Marin Ireland, Louisa Jacobson and Eddie Cahill. In its opening weekend, “Materialists” surpassed box office projections by earning $12 million.\n\n\n\tVariety gave the A24 film a positive review. “It’s a sharp and serious social romantic drama full of telling observations about the way we live now, and about how connected that is (or not) to the way we’ve always lived. And there’s a dark side to it. It’s ‘Sex and the City’ filtered through a sobering reality check,” film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote.  \n\n\tSong, a former playwright, made her directorial debut with “Past Lives,” starring Greta Lee, John Magaro and Teo Yoo. “Past Lives” made its way to the Oscars, where it was nominated for best picture and best original screenplay. \n\n\tIn an interview with Variety, Song discussed what “Materialists” has in common with Jane Austen. “’Materialists’ is a kind of Victorian romance, because it’s about the marriage market, the way that they always are,” she said. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSales agency Beta Cinema has boarded “Operation Napoleon – Tears of the Wolf,” a sequel to hit Nordic adventure “Operation Napoleon,” which sold to more than 40 countries, including the U.S., where Magnolia released it. Beta will launch sales at the American Film Market in Los Angeles.\n\n\t“Operation Napoleon – Tears of the Wolf” sends Kristin and her team on a hunt for the “Tears of the Wolf” — a legendary stash of Nazi diamonds hidden during World War II. After witnessing a murder, Kristin uncovers the first clues and, together with Steve and Einar, deciphers fragmented wartime artifacts, lost musical notes, and encrypted codes.\n\t\n\n\tTheir journey spans Iceland, Finland and Germany, culminating in a high-stakes chase through Helsinki’s underground bunker system and a dramatic showdown in the Finland Archipelago. Pursued by brutal mercenaries and a deadly assassin, the trio must navigate twists, betrayals and historical secrets buried deep in Europe’s past.\n\n\n\tFinnish director Jyri Kähönen (“Trackers,” “Bordertown,” “Ihon Alla”) is helming the English-language thriller, working from a script written again by Marteinn Thorisson (“Operation Napoleon,” “Jack Taylor,” “Niko”).\n\n\tThe cast features returning leads Vivian Ólafsdóttir (“It Hatched,” “Reykjavík 112”), Jack Fox (“Riviera,” “Sanditon,” “Cheaters”), and Icelandic acting icon Ólafur Darri Ólafsson (“Severance,” “Trapped,” “True Detective,” “Fantastic Beasts”). They are joined by Tom Weston-Jones (“True Things,” “Warrior,” “Copper”) and Laura Birn (“Void,” “The Crow,” “A Walk Among the Tombstones,” “Foundation”).\n\t\n\n\tThe film is shooting in Turku, the archipelago area in Finland, Iceland and Hamburg until Nov. 21.\n\n\tIt is produced by Anita Elsani and Alexander Klein for Germany’s Splendid Entertainment, and Kjartan Thor Thordarson of Iceland’s Sagafilm, alongside co-producing partners Take Two Studios and Elsani Film. The production is supported by Moin Filmfund, Business Finnland and the Iclandic Ministry of Industry and Innovation.\n\n\tSam Film will release theatrically in Iceland, Splendid Film in Germany.\n\n\tElsani stated, “The response to the first ‘Operation Napoleon’ has been truly overwhelming. The film became a genuine box office success in Iceland, and Beta Cinema sold the title to more than 40 countries worldwide, including the U.S. (Magnolia). On top of that, it performed exceptionally well for ZDF and across SVOD platforms. This strong national and international resonance fills us with confidence and enthusiasm for the sequel.”\n\n\tKlein added, “For Splendid, ‘Operation Napoleon’ was one of last year’s most successful titles, outplaying major U.S. releases in the German VOD market. We are very much looking forward to the second part, which we have developed as an original story from the ground up.”\n",

Wolff argues in his suit that he's done nothing to defame Melania because he did not write the Daily Beast article or headline -- and some of his statements were taken out of context by the reporter.\n      \n    \n          We've reached out to Melania's reps ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jeffrey Epstein\n              \n                          \n                Donald Trump\n              \n                          \n                Melania Trump\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

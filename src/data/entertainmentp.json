    "body": "\n\tThe psychological competition format “The Traitors” is making the leap from television to theater, with a stage production planned for London next year.\n\n\tStudio Lambert and Neal Street Productions revealed Monday they are collaborating on the live adaptation, which will feature a script by John Finnemore and staging by Robert Hastie. Finnemore’s credits include radio comedy “Cabin Pressure” and contributions to “Good Omens,” while Hastie won an Olivier Award for his work on musicals including “Operation Mincemeat” and “Standing at the Sky’s Edge.”\n\t\n\n\tThe theatrical version arrives as the BBC series, presented by Claudia Winkleman, wrapped its fourth season. The celebrity edition’s finale attracted 15 million viewers last year, ranking as Britain’s top-rated program of 2025.\n\n\n\t“Taking ‘The Traitors’ from screen to stage is a hugely exciting next step for this much-loved brand,” said Stephen Lambert, CEO of Studio Lambert. “Partnering with Neal Street Productions, a true theatrical powerhouse, allows us to reimagine the show as a bold and surprising theatrical performance. Faithful fans should expect an intense, joyful night out as we reveal a thrilling new hunting ground for our Traitors.”\n\n\tCaro Newling, co-founder of Neal Street Productions, added: “In developing ‘The Traitors’ for the stage, Neal Street and Studio Lambert have curated a team of brilliant faithful theater-makers led by director Rob Hastie and writer John Finnemore to bring a bold, structural twist to the format that only the live medium can provide.”\n\n\tCasting, venue selection and performance dates remain under wraps. Licensing arrangements were handled by All3Media International.\n\t\n\n\tThe original format launched from Dutch broadcasters IDTV and Posvideo working with RTL Creative Unit. Local versions now air in more than 30 markets globally, while broadcasters in over 50 countries have acquired completed episodes. The franchise extends beyond television into board games, card games and a London-based immersive attraction that opened last summer.\n\n\tIndustry recognition includes Emmy, BAFTA and RTS honors. The format has also collected prizes from the Asian Academy Creative Awards, Rose d’Or and Producers Guild of America.\n\n\tHastie recently joined the National Theatre as deputy artistic director. His “Operation Mincemeat” currently plays London’s West End and Broadway. Finnemore earned the Writers’ Guild of Great Britain’s lifetime achievement honor in 2020.\n",

The company will start promoting the film at the European Film Market in Berlin next month.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe U.S. release will be handled by Studio Dom.\n\n\tThijs Meuwese’s film centers on Max, a young woman, who – enabled by a mysterious futuristic machine – dives inside the mind of her dying girlfriend, trying to find the essential memory that could save her life, all the while being hunted by a man they presumed to be dead.\n\t\n\n\tMeuwese said, “‘Psychonaut’ is a trippy microbudget drama with elements of science fiction and horror in the same vein as movies like ‘Pi,’ ‘Following,’ ‘Primer’ and ‘The Lighthouse.’\n\n\n\t“Designed from the ground up to blur the boundaries between reality, dream and memory, ‘Psychonaut’ is a gritty dive into human subconsciousness and the formative moments of our lives.”\n\n\tThe film also stars Julia Batelaan, Yasmin Blake and Lloydd Hamwijk.

    "body": "\n\tThe local romance “Once We Were Us” secured its third consecutive weekend at the top of the South Korean box office, according to data from KOBIS, the tracking service operated by the Korean Film Council. While the film remained steady at the summit, the weekend saw a notable rise for a local musical drama. \n\n\t“Once We Were Us” earned $1.7 million from 254,298 admissions over the weekend. Directed by Kim Do-young and starring Koo Kyo-hwan and Moon Ga-young, the film is a local remake of the 2018 Chinese hit “Us and Them.” The story follows two people who first met as students and fell in love, only to be separated by the harsh realities of city life. They unexpectedly reunite a decade later, forcing them to confront their shared past and the dreams they once held. Since its New Year’s Eve debut, the film has amassed a cumulative gross of $13.6 million from 2,001,032 admissions.\n\t\n\n\tIn a significant surge, the local musical drama “Choir of God” climbed to second place, earning $1.05 million from 155,271 admissions. Starring Park Si-hoo and Jeong Jin-woon, the film follows a North Korean security officer who forms a deceptive choir to interact with an international NGO to secure foreign funds. The film has now earned a total of $4.5 million and managed to edge out “Avatar: Fire and Ash” for the runner-up spot.\n\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” dropped to third place, bringing in $1.03 million over the weekend. The threequel has been a massive earner in South Korea, currently sitting at a total cumulative gross of $53.2 million from 6,564,851 admissions since its mid-December release.\n\t\n\n\tThe highest-ranking new entry for the weekend was the local crime noir “Project Y,” which debuted in fourth place with $433,281 from 60,896 admissions. Directed by Lee Hwan, the film stars Han So-hee and Jeon Jong-seo as two friends who orchestrate a high-stakes heist to steal gold bars in Seoul’s Gangnam district. Before reaching local theaters, “Project Y” completed a successful festival circuit tour that included its world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival and a screening at the Busan International Film Festival. Since its Jan. 21 release, it has earned a total of $699,196.\n\n\tThe local animated feature “Shinbi’s Haunted House: One More Summon” fell to fifth place, adding $373,548 for a total gross of $1.5 million. Based on the popular “Shinbi Apartment” television franchise, the film follows siblings Hari and Doori and their goblin friend Shinbi as they investigate a new supernatural threat involving mysterious hypnotizing water.\n\n\tIn sixth place, “Zootopia 2” added $341,227 for a cumulative total of $56.9 million. It was followed by the local romantic comedy “Heartman: Rock and Love,” which earned $230,297 for a total of $1.4 million. Directed by Choi Won-sub, “Heartman: Rock and Love” stars Kwon Sang-woo as a former musician living a quiet life whose world is turned upside down when he reunites with his first love, played by Moon Chae-won.\n\n\tThe eighth spot was held by the classic Japanese animation “Laputa: Castle in the Sky,” which earned $177,958 from 24,171 admissions. The re-release of the 1986 Miyazaki Hayao masterpiece follows a young boy and a girl with a magic crystal who search for a legendary floating castle while being pursued by sky pirates and government agents.\n\n\tRounding out the top ten were two international releases. Oscar nominee “Sirat,” directed by Oliver Laxe, debuted in ninth place with $94,459 and has a cume of $158,265. In 10th place was the Chinese historical drama “731” (also known as “Evil Unbound”) directed by Zhao Linshan and starring Jiang Wu. The film explores the atrocities of the Imperial Japanese Army’s biological warfare unit during World War II. It earned $83,283 over the weekend and has a cumulative total of $147,287. \n\n\tThe overall market collective gross for the weekend was $6.3 million, down from last week’s $7.2 million.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChina’s box office was led by Davis Films’ new horror release “Return to Silent Hill,” which debuted at No. 1 with RMB66.1 million ($9.3 million) over the Jan. 23–25 weekend, according to Artisan Gateway. \n\n\tWith a worldwide cume of $19.3 million, “Return to Silent Hill” is the No. 5 film globally, according to Comscore.\n\n\tTaopiaopiao’s action comedy “Busted Water Pipes” opened with $3.9 million. Directed by Zhou Difei, the film follows veteran cop Yu Dahai (Eddie Peng) and his squad, whose spotless, crime-free record has left them so underutilized that they begin fabricating cases to look busy. When the police station’s main water pipe bursts, however, the team stumbles into a real operation: a crew of tomb raiders posing as plumbers.\n\t\n\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” moved to third in its ninth weekend, earning $3.7 million. The animated sequel has now amassed $621 million in China, remaining one of the market’s top-grossing imports of the season.\n\n\n\tMaoyan Movie’s crime thriller “The Fire Raven” placed fourth, adding $2.9 million to lift its cumulative total to $57.2 million. Directed and written by Sam Quah, the film stars Peng Yuchang, Alan Aruna and Chang Ning and follows the reopening of a long-dormant murder case that exposes a wider network of corruption and revenge.\n\n\tDisney and 20th Century Studios’ “Avatar: Fire and Ash” rounded out the top five with $2.6 million, pushing its China cume to $157.9 million.\n\n\tThe weekend’s combined box office reached $29.5 million. China’s 2026 year-to-date total stands at $244.8 million, running 1% behind the same point in 2025. While the box office remains soft ahead of next month’s anticipated Lunar New Year holiday releases, next week sees Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 masterpiece “The Shining” release across China’s 750+ Imax screens for the first time. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains plot details for “Habseligkeiten,” Season 4, Episode 3 of HBO’s “Industry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tAnyone who last saw Kiernan Shipka as little Sally Draper in “Mad Men,” or even as wand-waving adolescent Sabrina Spellman in “Sabrina the Teenage Witch,” may well blink twice upon seeing her latest role as Hayley Clay in “Industry.”\n\n\n\tIn the first scenes of the Season 4 opener alone, she’s popping pills in a nightclub, getting frisky on the dance floor (with Charlie Heaton’s Jim, also a new character) and giving colorful descriptions of her vagina to her new acquaintance back at her — quite impressive — apartment. And this all before Hayley is eventually introduced as an executive assistant at shady financial startup Tender.\n\t\n\n\tBut it’s Episode 3 that truly kicks whatever remaining child-star status Shipka has left firmly into the annals of TV history in a scene in which she’s playfully encouraged to have sex with trouble aristocrat Henry Muck (Kit Harington) by his deviously manipulative wife Yasmin (Marisa Abela). Hayley obliges, perhaps too enthusiastically, prompting Yasmin to get involved in the action herself so as not to be outdone in the endless game of power play. Naturally, with this being “Industry,” and a season in which creators Konrad Kay and Mickey Down have all but blown the doors off the show’s financial roots, this threesome takes place in a medieval Austrian castle run by a family of fascists, where paintings by an “A. Hitler” hang on the walls.\n\n\tAs Shipka notes, “Industry” is a show that is not only “brave and it’s rule-breaking and it’s pushing limits” — but it’s a show that manages to “get away” with it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAt first, Hayley seems to be the doting assistant, albeit one who also likes to go out and hook up and take drugs. But we see more of her identity as show moves on. How would you describe her?\t\n\n\tWhen I taped for the show, it was pretty much the opening sequence, and then it was a scene from a later episode. And I was kind of going, “Who is she, who is this girl?” I could sense that she was playing some sort of game, and was also wild and living her life, and had a much grittier, more raw quality to her, given how much she explodes within the first five minutes of meeting her. But I really didn’t know what she was all about.\n\t\n\t\tAnd then what did you later find out at her?\t\n\n\tOnce I came on, I read the first four scripts, and I talked to Mickey and Konrad about what her later arc was going to be, and got to really map out this real long game that she plays. I find Hayley to be an incredibly smart and calculated and oftentimes deceptive character. I think that she is playing a game of chess and is sort of figuring out what kind of chess piece each moment is after she lives out the moment. She’s very emotionally linked to all these people as the show goes on — I think her business is interpersonal relationships, these complicated power dynamics with other people. And that was so fun to play. She’s got a real “dive in, nothing to lose” quality to her that I really liked. As calculated and fine-tuned as I found her, I also found that she didn’t have this “Am I doing the right thing?” thing, and had a forward movement to her game that was intoxicating.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKiernan Shipka in “Industry”\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWe have to talk about the threesome scene in Episode 3 with Yasmin and Henry. There’s a lot of power play going on in there. At first it seems like Yasmin is being manipulative over Henry, and merely using Hayley, but this seems to quickly turn. How did you see it?\t\n\n\tIt’s such an important scene for all three characters. But what I think is so interesting about that scene is that everybody’s got this wildly different emotional arc: You’re doing something together, but everyone is on kind of their own journey. The actual physical nature of the scene came last for me. It was much more about what this meant for Hayley — why she was doing it, and what she kind of knew she was getting herself into. And obviously, for Marisa and for Kit, it was equally about where their characters were and why they had found themselves in the situation, and what it meant for them. And for those three worlds to come and collide and feel all those different energies, it was a really interesting moment. And a really fun thing to do.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t“Industry” has been daring throughout the last three seasons, but I think there are some lines in that scene that will still raise eyebrows. When you read the script, was there a part of you that was like “Oh, ok, this is what we’re doing then?”\t\n\n\tThe amount of stuff that I that I read and went, “Oh, I guess I’m saying that!” I’ve never been on a show where I’ve read the scene, and then in real time gone, “Oh, wait, no, no, I’m actually doing that.” But also, at the same time, I feel like we’re in such good hands. And that’s why the show, for lack of a better term, gets away with this stuff as it’s done, in such a careful, tasteful manner. But it’s brave and it’s rule-breaking and it’s pushing limits. And I think that’s why everyone’s excited about it.\n\t\n\t\tI hope it wasn’t your first day on set…\t\n\n\tNo, that would be a different story! But we’d shot some stuff, so I knew everyone by then!\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a bit of editing from the sex scene straight into Yasmin eating oysters for breakfast that is quite wonderful.\t\n\n\tIt is! And that was in the script. So it’s really testament to Mickey and Konrad knowing exactly what kind of show they wanted to make.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCasting director Julie Harkin said she really wanted to give you a role that was something completely against what audiences have seen you in before. As someone who last saw you in “Mad Men,” this is obviously very different. Was that a consideration of yours as well going into this?\t\n\n\tYeah, it was really exciting. I and I’m very grateful to Julie and to Mickey and to Konrad for seeing me in this part, because she is different and she’s more grown up. I mean, I’m 26 now, but people have known me since I was 6. And I’m very aware of what kind of weight that holds. So for them to say, “Hey, I think she’s the girl for Hayley,” is very exciting for me. It’s a part I love. So I was definitely aware that I was doing something more mature. But I wasn’t really thinking, “I’ve really got to do this sort of thing next.” It’s about the people and the material. But when it can also be something that challenges someone’s perspectives of me as a performer and when it goes up against stuff I’ve done previously, that’s so exciting and so fun.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLife behind bars means death behind bars, and all the pain and frailty that often precedes it — a fate that awaits a good number of America’s incarcerated millions, though one we rarely see discussed or depicted on screen. A two-hander set entirely within the steel-blue confines of an American men’s prison, Petra Volpe‘s “Frank & Louis” charts with grace and sensitivity the initially reluctant but increasingly dependent connection between two inmates: a 60-year-old lifer slipping into the fog of Alzheimer’s disease, and a younger parole applicant enlisted to be the older man’s daily carer. \n\t\n\n\tThe ensuing story of trust and purpose regained in a spirit-sinking environment only really has one place to go — Volpe has scant time for melodrama or far-fetched buddy antics. But it’s all the more moving for that steady, solemn sense of mortal inevitability: As one man’s life gradually escapes his grasp, the other seeks to reclaim his while he still has time. \n\n\n\tFor Volpe, the Swiss writer-director behind last year’s effective, Oscar-shortlisted hospital procedural “Late Shift,” the film marks an equally assured, audience-friendly entry into English-language filmmaking. For stars Rob Morgan and Kingsley Ben-Adir, meanwhile, it’s a pleasingly patient and generous showcase: Both give performances of exquisite composure, with roiling anguish beneath the stillness. \n\n\t“Frank & Louis” keeps its location non-specific, and after decades spent between the walls and fences of this unforgiving institution, our two principals might themselves feel stuck in a placeless limbo. But Volpe and co-writer Esther Bernstorff have modeled their tale on the innovative real-life Gold Coats program at the California Men’s Colony in San Luis Obispo — whereby long-term prisoners are trained to act as carers for elder inmates stricken with dementia. \n\t\n\n\tRenamed the Yellow Coats initiative for the purposes of this fiction, it’s a project that taciturn convict Frank (Ben-Adir), who has already spent nearly 20 years inside for armed robbery and murder, initially joins purely out of self-interest. His parole hearing is coming up, and he reckons his participation will prove to the review board that he’s a better, gentler and altogether changed man these days. Following the release of a more seasoned carer, he’s assigned to Louis (Morgan), a similarly closed-off personality, now exasperated at losing his self-sufficiency in addition to his freedom. \n\n\tPerhaps sensing Frank’s less-than-wholehearted investment in all this, Louis at first resists the younger man’s help. But he’s deteriorating fast, losing control of his bodily functions and mental faculties, and in an environment that is already hostile to the vulnerable, he needs what support and protection he can get. Frank, meanwhile, is unprepared for the physical and psychological demands of the job — but also for its emotional rewards, and for the sense of community he finds with the other Yellow Coats, managed with plainspoken but kindly pragmatism by prison counselor Dr. Watts (Indira Varma).\n\n\tGradually, the two men gain each other’s trust, and a largely unspoken kinship emerges between them. In one lovely scene, a quiet, shared meal of cup noodles and Louisiana hot sauce says much about the fleeting sense of home they find in each other’s company, in stark single cells decorated with scrappy mementos of ever more distant family; in their absence, Louis and Frank become surrogate family to each other, with all the imminent heartbreak that entails. The words “I love you, son,” spoken with both sincerity and glazed confusion, are as close as this intelligently restrained film gets to sentimentality. The resulting swell of feeling is earned.\n\n\tIt’s a script and a production tightly built around its performers, both superb individually, but most importantly, warmly attentive to each other on screen, and capable of sharing a silence. Filmmakers too rarely gaze this intently at Morgan’s extraordinary face, which often stares back out at us in terror or defiance or sudden, ephemeral remembrance of where and why he is. In body language, too, he conveys Louis’ volatile swings between presence and internal absence. \n\t\n\n\tBen-Adir, the British star who made a strong impression as Malcolm X in “One Night in Miami…” but was hemmed in by the Wiki-drama conventions of “Bob Marley: One Love,” finally gets to show leading-man gifts beyond a knack for inhabiting icons. As Frank, he carries himself with a sadness that has become its own kind of armor, sometimes tapping into latent rage: He’s learnt impulse control, he tells Dr. Watts, though we feel the aching effort of that discipline.\n\n\tOccasionally, Volpe and Bernstorff’s script wants for a more precise, flavorful local vernacular. “Frank & Louis” never quite shakes the air of a story researched and respectfully observed from the outside in, though its humane reserve is a rare virtue in the prison-movie genre, often given to more lurid displays of grit and misery. Assisted by the low, somber strings of Oliver Coates’ score and the clean, crisp brightness of Judith Kaufmann’s lensing, Volpe directs with much the same simplicity and moderation, toward a pitch-perfect ending of wholly disarming terseness and economy. No redemptive speechifying or cathartic waterworks here, just life carrying on with a slightly heavier tread.\n",

    "description": "\n\tIn Ursula Wills-Jones’ 2008 short story “The Wicker Husband” (not to be confused with the “The Wicker Man”), an unpleasant fisherwoman in an unenlig",
    "body": "\n\tIn Ursula Wills-Jones’ 2008 short story “The Wicker Husband” (not to be confused with the “The Wicker Man”), an unpleasant fisherwoman in an unenlightened medieval town asks the local basketmaker to weave her a partner. From there, the supernatural fable could be “Pinocchio” for adults, only it’s not the wooden creation’s nose that grows, and this ideal husband cannot tell a lie, whispering things like “I was made to be with you” and “You are the only reason that I live and breathe” — which are not only true, but just about the most romantic thing one can say to a woman so unfortunate of feature and unfragrant of aroma.\n\t\n\n\tIn writer-directors Eleanor Wilson and Alex Huston Fischer’s bawdy big-screen adaptation, the “ugly woman” of Wills-Jones’ imagination (played by Olivia Colman) is no grimier than the other townsfolk — except perhaps the tailor’s wife (Elizabeth Debicki) — and seemingly content to have no part in the local marriage customs. In a significant step up from 2020 Sundance darling “Save Yourselves!,” the filmmaking pair don’t stray far from Wills-Jones’ intention, using the story’s unspecified time and place to poke fun at superstition, the pressures to conform and the institution of marriage.\n\n\n\tAt the same time, they take feisty delight in embellishing just how uncouth these townspeople are (except for Peter Dinklage’s master basketmaker, who’s as couth as an openly gay artisan can be in a town where people piss and fart in public). One could say the filmmakers have been strategically reverent toward the source material, but slyly disrespectful in all other respects — like the marriage custom of locking a heavy copper collar around the bride’s neck and a strap-on carrot over the groom’s nibbly bits.\n\t\n\n\tSuch touches give the film a distinctively irreverent tone, not dissimilar from the ignorant peasant folk in “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” to the degree that it might have been fun to see a man in drag playing Colman’s “ugly woman” role — not that there’s anything wrong with the Oscar winner’s interpretation. The adventurous actress dirties up her frock and face to play the village pariah, who reeks of fish and would be no man’s idea of a suitable wife, except perhaps the one-eyed bum who sleeps in the town square.\n\n\tNo matter. Solitude suits her fine. And then one day, after accidentally “winning” a silly game to predict who will be the next to wed, she changes her mind and orders up a mate from the master basketmaker — the way one might request a mail-order bride or life-size love doll. He’s a wordy chap (the basketmaker, not his creaking creation), waxing Shakespearean as he considers his commission. Dinklage’s multiple monologues stick out, assuming you can hear them over Anna Meredith’s jauntily invasive score — one of the few embellishments that doesn’t improve the experience.\n\n\tWhere Wilson and Fischer really deepen Wills-Jones’ tale is in the private moments between the fisherwoman and her wicker husband, who awaits her at the altar in a handsome new suit and shoes borrowed from her neighbors — the tailor (Nabhaan Rizwan), shoemaker (Scott Alexander Yougng) and so on. Back at her run-down shack, the long-neglected lass enthusiastically experiences a lover’s attention for the first time, unperturbed by his wooden … everything. And who can blame her, considering he’s embodied by Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård, clearly recognizable beneath a veneer of elegantly woven willow?\n\n\tOne can only imagine the endless hours of debate that went into deciding how this wicker husband should look. He couldn’t be too sexy, or else the other women in town would be instantly jealous. They should be initially skeptical, the way one might be to learn that a friend was marrying her AI chatbot, only to come around once they see the fisherwoman’s husband doing chores and doting on his wife. But he can’t be too offputting either, lest he alienate the audience. (Per the directors’ Sundance Film Festival intro, there were practical considerations, too, like whether to give him nipples.)\n\t\n\n\tAfter all those considerations, the filmmakers landed somewhere between “Bicentennial Man” (whose boxy robot shell was kind of a deal-breaker) and the fish man in “The Shape of Water” (far from human, but blessed with nice abs and a limited vocabulary). The wicker husband isn’t exactly hot, but he’s handsome, and where the other men in town love to hear themselves talk, the newcomer proves reserved in both speech and gesture. The early scenes between this unlikely couple are tender, almost loving — a dynamic that’s not lost on the village women, all of whom have trouble with their own husbands.\n\n\tFor a time, it doesn’t feel like Wilson and Fischer know what to do with the story, which stalls a bit in the second act — the part where they ought to have embellished upon what Wills-Jones had written. The plot requires the tailor’s wife to introduce doubts in the fisherwoman’s mind about her affectionate man’s fidelity. It could be a consequence of the movie’s insolent sense of humor, but there’s something unconvincing (or else too convenient) about how often the fisherwoman’s attitude changes, from caring nothing about marriage to cautiously inviting a man into her life to completely distrusting him when rumors swirl.\n\n\tIs she really so weak of will? The script needs her to be to prove its point, which makes a few of her choices (to say nothing of her peers’ behavior) tough to accept. A fable is only as strong as its moral lesson, and while so many are rock solid, this one’s made of wicker.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNFL fans got a first look at Travis Scott in Christopher Nolan’s Greek epic “The Odyssey” during a new TV spot, which aired during Fox’s Sunday broadcast of the NFL AFC Championship matchup between the New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos.\n\n\tIn the teaser, Scott stands on top of a table and demands the attention of a group of soldiers, which includes Tom Holland’s Telemachus and Jon Bernthal’s Menelaus. Clips of the 10-time Grammy nominee’s debut quickly went viral on social media.\n\t\n\n\tUniversal declined Variety’s request for comment.\n\n\n\tThis is not the first collaboration between Scott and Nolan. Scott recorded the track “The Plan” for Nolan’s 2020 sci-fi thriller “Tenet.”\n\n\t“His voice became the final piece of a yearlong puzzle,” Nolan told GQ as part of a 2020 profile of Scott. “His insights into the musical and narrative mechanism [composer] Ludwig Göransson and I were building were immediate, insightful and profound.” \n\n\t“The Odyssey” is shaping up to be one of the most highly anticipated films in recent memory. Starring Matt Damon as the Greek Hero Odysseus, the film flaunts and all star cast of Holland, Anne Hathaway, Robert Pattinson, Lupita Nyong’o, Zendaya, Charlize Theron, Bernthal, Benny Safdie and Elliot Page.\n\n\t“The Odyssey” is the first narrative feature shot entirely on Imax cameras. The feat was previously impossible because the Imax cameras are so loud that intimate dialogue scenes are a no-go. But thanks to a new film casing called a “blimp,” the noise can be significantly reduced. \n\t\n\n\t“The blimp system is a game-changer,” Nolan told Empire Magazine. “You can be shooting a foot from [an actor’s] face while they’re whispering and get usable sound. What that opens up are intimate moments of performance on the world’s most beautiful format.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPark City had another crowd-pleasing premiere on Sunday with Adam Meeks’ “Union County,” which earned a lengthy standing ovation following its screening at the Eccles Theater.\n\n\tThe drama, which stars Will Poulter and Noah Centineo as brothers who are in drug recovery together, was shot in a real-life drug court in Ohio. Many of their co-stars were non-actors who were working the program itself.\n\n\n\tThe biggest cheers from the Sundance Film Festival crowd came for Annette Deao, who works as a therapist helping people navigate addiction recovery in real life. Deao has several emotional moments opposite Poulter.\n\t\n\n\tAt the Q&A following the screening, Meeks described how he became interested in the project.\n\n\n\t“I’m from central Ohio, in the area where this film is set, but my immediate family and I left when I was 6,” he said. “It wasn’t until 2016 that I started spending a lot of time there as an adult. My grandmother was sick, and I came back to spend time there. And I think it was because I had been away for so long, but I was falling in love with Ohio and seeing the place differently and seeing people differently. Around the same time, my, extended family was telling me about the way that the opioid epidemic at that time was impacting friends and loved ones,” Meeks said. “It was intense, and my uncle actually introduced me to the drug court judge at the time, the previous judge, and he invited me to sit in on a meeting. I had been hearing about what I think most of us were hearing about, in terms of the bleakness and tragedy of the overdose statistics. I was immediately seeing people getting better and getting back on their feet, and I was also seeing the incredible work that Annette and her team and everybody were doing.”\n\t\n\n\tPrior to the screening, Meeks spoke to Variety on the red carpet about how Poulter got involved with the project.\n\n\t“He actually read the script through his agent and reached out to us,” Meeks said. “I got on a Zoom with him and fell in love immediately. We did the kind of coy thing at the end of a call where you’re like, ‘Alright, I’ll talk to my people, and you talk to your people.’ And then five minutes later, we had offered him the role, and he had accepted it. It was just a really organic, beautiful, mutual connection.”\n\n\tDeao also spoke to Variety on the carpet about how abuse of opioids is evolving in the Midwest.\n\n\t“I believe the opioid epidemic is changing,” Deao said. “Part of that is education. People are understanding — even our medical professionals understand much better — you cannot keep prescribing that and expect people not to get addicted. We are seeing improvement. Also, medication-assisted treatment has been an amazing part of how people are recovering from substance use disorder.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNHL commissioner Gary Bettman, 73, recently told Hockey News that he watched the entire first season of HBO Max’s queer hockey drama “Heated Rivalry” in one sitting and thought it was “a wonderful story.”\n\n\t“The content — particularly for young people — may be a little spicy, so you have to balance that out with how you embrace it,” he said. \n\n\tBettman added, “I thought the storyline was very compelling. And a lot of fun, because I could see where they were picking at things we [as a league] had done in the past, whether or not it was being in Sochi or the All-Star Game in Tampa. It was very well done.”\n\t\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” has exploded in popularity ever since it debuted on HBO Max in late November of 2025. Based on Rachel Reid’s “Game Changer” book series, the show follows Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie), two up-and-coming hockey stars who engage in a secret, years long romanace off the ice. The show has been renewed for a second season.\n\n\tAs proof of the show’s universal appeal, stars Williams and Storrie carried the Olympic torch on Sunday as part of the Milano Cortina 2026 relay in Feltre, Italy. They also presented at the Golden Globes, escorted to the stage by two UFC fighters. In the days following the Globes, Williams went to Milan for Men’s Fashion Week, where he walked in the Dsquared2 show and attended the Giorgio Armani runway presentation.\n\n\tDuring a recent appearance on the “Shut Up Evan” podcast, Williams said that the sudden fame has been tricky to navigate. He said, “I was just talking with one of my agents yesterday, and she said Connor and I have had to learn what a lot of actors get in five years, in like 30 days.”\n",

So hard that Cassy from Boston lied about vabbing 50 times a day, thinking it would attract more dates ... and it did!\n      \n    \n          To be fair ... the type of guy interested in you because of your addiction to applying your own vaginal fluids to your neck probably isn't going to be marriage material, but they're coming out the woodwork for your girl.\n      \n    \n          ICYMI ... Cassy went on \"My Strange Addiction\" claiming she uses two fingers to collect her vaginal discharge and then rub it onto her neck as a natural perfume.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TLC\n          \n    \n          But now, she admits it was a lie. She says what she was actually addicted to was alcohol.\n      \n    \n          In a video uploaded to YouTube, which she has since set to Private, she explains, \"I was drinking a lot. I was eating a lot of processed food and I was just genuinely unhappy and lonely.\"\n      \n\n          Cassy says she applied to be on dating shows but got rejected. She believes she didn't make the cut because she wasn't deemed attractive enough.\n      \n    \n          But then she learned about a new trend called \"vabbing\" and thought it could be the perfect thing to get her on TV.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          \"At that time, I was really desperate to find a boyfriend,\" she says. \"And I thought, if I expose myself, if I put myself on TV, that will increase my chances of finding a relationship.\"\n      \n    \n          And now, Cassy says she's been going on \"a lot of dates,\" is on a dozen dating apps and has received a thousand messages.\n      \n    \n          She says, \"Since the episode aired, I've been going on breakfast, lunch, dinner dates.

But get this ... Cassy says she's actually not embarrassed because she suffers from alexithymia.\n      \n    \n          Now, it's hard to trust anything Cassy says because while alexithymia makes it difficult to communicate emotions, it can actually make you feel more shame, but what seems to be true is ... homegirl is still on the prowl and still looking for attention.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                TLC\n              \n                          \n                Weird News\n              \n                          \n                YouTube\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

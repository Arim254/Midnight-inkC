    "body": "\n\tAmazon MGM Studios is developing a scripted series based on Vivian Tu’s non-fiction book “Rich AF: The Money Mindset That Will Change Your Life.” \n\n\tMallory Rosenthal (“Panic”) will serve as writer and executive producer, with both Tu and “The Summer I Turned Pretty” co-showrunner Sarah Kucserka also executive producing. PKM Productions’ Patrick Moran and Lynley Bird will executive produce under the company’s first-look deal with Amazon MGM Studios. PKM originally brought the project to Amazon. \n\t\n\n\tThe logline for the project states that it is a “a riches to rags story that follows 23-year-old Lia, a billionaire’s daughter and Wall Street rising star who has to start from scratch after exposing her father’s white collar crimes and losing everything she once held dear. She’ll be pinned between her former glittering life and a new scrappier one as she painstakingly builds a freelance career and learns that wealth isn’t only measured in dollars.” \n\n\n\t“’Rich AF’ is a love letter to anyone who has ever felt broke, lost, and like they wanted to hit the redo button on life!” Tu said in a statement. “I’m so grateful to be working with PKM, Sarah, Mallory and the phenomenal Amazon Studios team to bring the energy & empowerment of ‘Rich AF’ to life on screen.”\n\n\tTu is currently the chief financial empowerment officer at SoFi and a New York Times bestselling author. Her second book, “Well Endowed: The Secrets to Strategic Spending, Building a Financial Foundation for You and Your Family, and Creating Lasting Generational Wealth,” was published earlier this month. \n\t\n\n\tMoran, formerly president of ABC Studios, is also currently an executive producer on the USA Network series adaptation of John Grisham’s “The Rainmaker,” which was renewed for a second season in October 2025.  He signed his deal with Amazon in 2019. \n\n\tTu is repped by WME, Hansen Jacobson and 42West. Kucserka is repped by WME and 3Arts Entertainment. Rosenthal is repped by WME and Amplified Management. Moran is repped by Myman Greenspan. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAMC Theatres has opted out of screening the AI-generated short “Thanksgiving Day,” which won a film festival contest whose prize included showcasing the winner at cinemas across the U.S.\n\n\tEarlier this week, the inaugural Frame Forward AI Animated Film Festival announced the victorious project would be granted a two-week run in nationwide theaters. The festival was organized by Screenvision Media, an advertising company that supplies the 20-minute pre-show engagement that runs before the feature presentation at major theater chains, including some AMC locations as well as Classic Cinemas and TCL Chinese Theatres. Exhibitors, however, don’t seem to have been involved in the terms of the Frame Forward contest.\n\t\n\n\t“This content is an initiative from Screenvision Media, which manages pre-show advertising for several movie theatre chains in the United States and runs in fewer than 30 percent of AMC’s U.S. locations,” a spokesperson for AMC said in a statement. “AMC was not involved in the creation of the content or the initiative and has informed Screenvision that AMC locations will not participate.”\n\n\n\tCreated by Igor Alferov, “Thanksgiving Day” used AI software, including Gemini 3.1 and Nano Banana Pro, to craft an intergalactic story about a bear and his platypus assistant who encounter all kinds of characters as they travel through the galaxy.\n\n\tAI has been a widely dissected topic as Hollywood grapples with the opportunities and consequences of using such tools for making movies and television. In Variety and CNN’s recent town hall conversation with Matthew McConaughey and Timothée Chalamet, the two A-listers talked about the entertainment industry’s need to brace itself for the rise of AI.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s coming. It’s already here. Don’t deny it,” McConaughey said. “It’s not going to be enough to sit on the sidelines and make the moral plea that, ‘No, this is wrong.’ It’s not gonna last. There’s too much money to be made, and it’s too productive. So I say: Own yourself. Voice, likeness, et cetera. Trademark it. Whatever you gotta do, so when it comes, no one can steal you.”\n\n\tChalamet said although he’s preparing for potential harms, he believes the business will find a healthy way to embrace the rapidly developing technology.\n\n\t“I’m fiercely protective of actors and artists in this industry,” Chalamet said. “And equally, whatever tide is coming, it’s coming.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGordon Ramsay is showing his vulnerable side.\n\n\tIn his new Netflix docu series, “Being Gordon Ramsay,” the celebrity gets emotional, even tearing up several times while talking about his wife Tana and their six kids, as well as his strained relationship with his abusive father, Gordon Sr., an alcoholic who died of a heart attack in 1997. He was 53. \n\n\t“I think it’s healthy to cry,” Ramsay tells me over Zoom just days ahead of the series’ premiere, adding, “I think it’s healthy to cry.”\n\t\n\n\t“Being Gordon Ramsay” chronicles his most ambitious project in his almost 30-year career, a five-restaurant and culinary school complex at the top of London’s 22 Bishopsgate skyscraper.\n\n\n\tIn no uncertain terms, Ramsay makes it clear that his father never appreciated his culinary pursuits. His dad died just as Ramsay was on the verge of launching what would become his sprawling restaurant, hospitality and media empire.\n\n\tThe elder Ramsay was an aspiring musician. “I grew up watching my father follow a career in music that didn’t happen — that didn’t work for him,” Ramsay says. “My mates in the music business asked me, ‘How the fuck do you know so much about Gibson and Fender Strats and Telecasters? How do you know about synthesizers?'”\n\n\tThose unfulfilled dreams led to an unstable childhood. “I was lugging that gear up in and out of bars, in and out of Glasgow where he’d play for 60, 70 bucks a night,” Ramsay recalls. “Then he’d disappear to Nashville. They would have all the collectors at the door and my mum in tears answering the door because people were chasing her for money that my dad owed them.”\n\t\n\n\tHe previously opened up about his father’s emotional and physical abuse towards him, his mom and his siblings in his 2006 memoir, “Humble Pie.”\n\n\t“I don’t know if he was interested in what I did, I think,” Ramsay says. “I remember seeing him with a glass of red wine and he filled it up with Sprite because he tried to tell me it tasted better. I was like, oh, Jesus Christ. If my sommeliers saw this or any of my chefs heard my father talk like this, they’d think I was a fucking idiot. ‘OK, Dad, why?’ ’Well, it brings out the grape.’ I just sat there like that thinking, ‘Oh my God.’ My head was in my hands.”\n\n\tHe continues, “I never got to cook for him, and I think in many ways I got to live with that. Maybe that’s a good thing. I think things happened for a reason, and him not being sat at the table getting looked after and spoiled in my restaurant, I don’t know if he could handle that, if I’m honest.”\n\n\tHis mom Helen, on the other hand, “is one of the most important women in my life,” Ramsay notes. \n\n\t“I’ve always been a mother’s boy,” he says, smiling. “I won my first Michelin Star years ago and I said to Tana, ‘Look, I’m embarrassed. Mom’s in a high-rise, in a tenement block, and she can barely afford to pay the rent. I’m going to take out this loan.’ Mom must have been 19 when she had me. She was in her late 40s and never ever owned a property.”\n\n\tHe bought her a three-bedroom bungalow. “That, for me, was more important than winning my first Michelin Star because mom always spoke about owning her own house, having her own bedroom, bathroom, back garden, having all the plants, the ornaments and everything,” Ramsay says.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAdam Peaty, Holly Ramsay, Tana Ramsay, Oscar James Ramsay, Tilly Ramsay and Henry Farrow attend the launch of “Being Gordon Ramsay” on Feb. 16 in London.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Netflix UK\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRamsay, who turns 60 in November, admits he feels guilt for putting career before spending time with his and Tana’s eldest kids, Megan, fraternal twins Holly and Jack, and Tilly. The series shows him doting on their young sons, Oscar, 7, and Jesse, 2.\n\n\t“I want to be the father to my family that I never grew up with,” he says. “I’m the opposite. Everything I grew up with and witnessed, I’m the opposite. I’ve never to this day been wandering around the dining room with a glass of champagne, messing around, drinking with customers. I don’t do that.” (In one of the docu series’ most heartbreaking moments, Ramsay details his brother’s battle with heroin addiction.)\n\t\n\n\tAnd just when viewers of the series think Bishopsgate could be his swan song, he tells Tana in the final episode – SPOILER ALERT! — that he’s thinking about opening a new place in New York City. “What the fuck would I do?” he says when I ask if he ever thinks of slowing down. “What am I going to do? Go and have matcha lattes and go to fucking yoga classes every day, and turn into a fat, lazy chef that wants to sit there and wallow on his boat? No. No. I have a responsibility to talent and I’ve made my bed, but I want to sleep in it comfortably and I do not want to retire.”\n\n\t“Being Gordon Ramsay” is available now on Netflix.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tLast year’s Oscar acting winners — Adrien Brody, Kieran Culkin, Mikey Madison and Zoe Saldaña — will return to the 98th Academy Awards to present trophies to the next wave of victors.\n\n\tRaj Kapoor, the show’s executive producer and showrunner, and Katy Mullan, an executive producer, announced the quartet as the first official presenters to join the anticipated ceremony.\n\n\tBrody won his second best actor statuette (after “The Pianist,” 2002) for portraying an architect and Holocaust survivor in “The Brutalist,” while Madison claimed best actress for playing the titular stripper in the dramedy “Anora.” Culkin and Saldaña swept last season’s televised precursors en route to their supporting wins — Culkin for his snarky cousin on a Jewish heritage tour in “A Real Pain,” and Saldaña for playing a struggling attorney in the Spanish-language musical “Emilia Pérez.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Academy has long leaned on tradition by bringing back the previous year’s acting winners to hand off the honors. In some years, the show has “gender-swapped” presenters, with the prior male acting winners presenting the current year’s actress prizes and vice versa. Other ceremonies have revived variations of the “fab five” format, in which five past winners from a category take the stage to salute the nominees. The Academy and the producing team have not yet confirmed which categories Brody, Culkin, Madison and Saldaña will present.\n\n\n\tAdditional presenters will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n\tThis year’s nominations are led by record-breaker “Sinners,” Ryan Coogler’s bold, bloody vampire saga, which landed an all-time high of 16 nominations. Close behind is Paul Thomas Anderson’s political action epic “One Battle After Another,” a searing examination of radical politics that earned 13 nods. Both films are nominated for best picture alongside “Bugonia,” “F1,” “Frankenstein,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme,” “The Secret Agent,” “Sentimental Value” and “Train Dreams.”\n\t\n\n\tAs the season nears its finish line, the next major clues about Academy momentum arrive with Sunday’s 79th BAFTA Awards, followed by the Producers Guild of America Awards on Feb. 28 and The Actor Awards (formerly SAG Awards) on March 1.\n\n\tFinal Oscar voting runs from Feb. 26 through March 5. Conan O’Brien returns to host the telecast, set to air live March 15 at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT from the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood. The ceremony will broadcast on ABC and stream live on Hulu, with the ceremony airing in more than 200 territories worldwide.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSteven Spielberg is heading to Austin, Texas, for this year’s South by Southwest as a keynote speaker for the festival’s landmark 40th anniversary.\n\n\tAt SXSW, the storied filmmaker will discuss his legendary body of work — from “Jaws” and “E.T.” to the Indiana Jones and “Jurassic Park” movies to “Schindler’s List” and “Saving Private Ryan,” plus his upcoming event thriller, “Disclosure Day” — as well as the future of moviegoing, in a live episode of “The Big Picture” podcast with Sean Fennessey. The conversation will be held on Friday, March 13.\n\t\n\n\t“Childhood dreams do come true!” said Claudette Godfrey, VP film & TV at SXSW, in a statement announcing the director’s attendance at the festival, which runs March 12-18.\n\n\n\t“Steven Spielberg is a true pioneer and legend whose seminal work has inspired generations of filmmakers and audiences alike,” Godfrey continued. “He’s given us some of cinema’s most formative, unforgettable, and magical experiences, always pushing the boundaries of what’s possible on screen. He embodies the spirit of cinematic innovation and bold storytelling that defines SXSW, and bringing him to Austin for this special keynote is going to be an extraordinary moment for our community. Making dreams come true is exactly why we do what we do. We’ll all be phoning home about this one!”\n\n\tIndeed, the three-time Academy Award-winning filmmaker and founder of Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks is hailed as one of the most influential creative forces in cinema history. His latest film, “Disclosure Day,” starring Emily Blunt, Josh O’Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson and Colman Domingo, debuts in theaters on June 12 from Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment. Spielberg is also among the producers of this year’s best picture nominee, “Hamnet,” by filmmaker Chloé Zhao.\n\t\n\n\tFor the first time ever, SXSW will feature all of its programming running simultaneously across innovation, film & TV and music for seven days, including an extra night of music. Spielberg joins an impressive lineup of speakers at the film & TV conference, including Jamie Lee Curtis; Vince Gilligan and Rhea Seehorn on the legacy of “Breaking Bad”; Larry David and Jeff Schaffer on their upcoming HBO historical comedy series; and the team behind HBO’s “Rooster”: Bill Lawrence, Matt Tarses, Steve Carell and Danielle Deadwyler.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Zootopia 2” producer Yvett Merino had an unconventional start at the Walt Disney Company. She wasn’t in storyboard rooms or art school corridors, but rather in the back halls of the studio, temping and learning the company from the inside out, one unglamorous job at a time.\n\n\tIn a business that loves a great origin story, Merino’s is refreshing as an outsider who has taken a very deserved seat at the Hollywood table. She was a sociology major who planned to go into social work, took a detour for “emotional survival,” and then slowly — and almost accidentally — built the resume that makes a modern producer invaluable.\n\t\n\n\tNow, Merino is shepherding “Zootopia 2,” the sequel that has been both a critical and commercial success and landed her back in the Oscar conversation for best animated feature once again.\n\n\n\tBut if you’re looking for swagger, you won’t find it with Merino. The Mexican American filmmaker’s first instinct was to give credit where credit was due on Oscar nomination morning. “In that moment, I was thinking of all of the artists and the production management team that put everything into this film,” she tells Variety. “For it to be recognized and in the conversation for the year is super exciting.”\n\n\tThat impulse — to make the “I” an “us” — feels natural for her. She knows she didn’t do this on her own, which is a surprising quality in an industry where taking credit for success is common.\n\n\tHowever, sequels come with added pressure, and the audience’s expectations are the heaviest weight of all. Merino frames the creative mandate in simple terms: if you’re going back, it has to be worth it. When she began conversations with directors Jared Bush and Byron Howard — who won the Academy Award for best animated feature for “Encanto” — she knew the bar was sky-high. “The film was very successful,” she says. “To do a sequel and to continue the story needed to be something just as good, if not better.”\n\t\n\n\tHer anchor was character — specifically, Judy Hopps, voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin, and her evolving bond with Nick Wilde, voiced by Emmy winner Jason Bateman. “I love, love, love Judy Hopps,” Merino says. “As long as we hooked it on her and her relationship with Nick, and how their relationship evolved, I think I was in. It took a little bit to find that, but once we found that, we were kind of in for the ride.”\n\n\tOne reason the first “Zootopia” lasted is that it trusted kids with complexity, without alienating adults. Merino sees that trust as a responsibility. “Kids these days are super smart. We never want to, quote unquote, dumb it down for kids,” she says. “We just want to make sure it’s understandable and digestible.”\n\n\tThe studio’s internal calculus, she admits, can get anxious: Is this too complicated? Too referential? But Merino is comfortable with layered storytelling, even the kind that flies over a 5-year-old’s head and lands with the parents. “We have references to ‘The Shining’ and ‘The Silence of the Lambs,’” she says with a chuckle. “And I can guarantee you, the 5-year-olds in the audience have no idea what it is.”\n\n\tIn an era where artistic metrics are splintered between box office, streaming and the long tail of cultural chatter, Merino still believes in the old ritual. “I am a huge theater person, and I truly believe in having this communal experience with people that you don’t know, and laughing together, or having emotion and crying together, or having that jump scare together,” she says.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Zootopia 2”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney Animation\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn January, “Zootopia 2” became the ninth-biggest global release of all time, ranking behind two superhero juggernauts, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” ($1.9 billion) and “Avengers: Infinity War” ($2 billion).\n\n\tAnd she’s pragmatic about what “success” even means now. “A hit is measured in so many different ways,” she says. “Finishing the film is its own success, because they’re difficult to make.”\n\n\tMerino began at Disney in 1996, not as a rising creative, but as an assistant in the technology department — and she’s quick to correct the internet mythology. “I was a temp. I was an assistant,” she quips. “It says somewhere out there that I’m a software engineer — I’m not.”\n\t\n\n\tHer path into production wasn’t a master plan so much as a slow awakening to the idea of loving what you do. She spent roughly a decade in administrative and studio infrastructure roles before a producer approached her about running an editing department. “Within six months, I knew — oh, this is what it’s like to love your job and to feel as if you belong here,” she says.\n\n\tMerino’s personal milestones are also industry ones. During our time together, she reflects on being the first Latina nominated as a producer in the animated feature category for “Encanto,” and the ripple effect that followed. The messages she got were about the possibility. “My favorite thing is that people, after we won for ‘Encanto,’ I got so many texts from my girlfriends saying, ‘My daughter saw you and said, hey, I want to do that,’” she recalls.\n\n\tHer answer to that visibility is accepting the responsibility. “The door has been kicked open a bit, so I feel like it’s my job to keep it open and continue to welcome people into the world of storytelling however they want to be a part of it.”\n\n\tThat ethos shows up not only in the films but inside the company. Merino describes helping create Voices at Disney and fostering internal spaces like the Encanto familia group — work she calls among her proudest achievements. “It truly solidified for me how important community is because I never felt so at home until I kind of built that community around me.”\n\n\tIn other words, and more importantly, representation isn’t only what’s on the big screen. It’s also about who’s in the room when choices are made.\n\n\tShe also speaks to leadership transitions at the company, with the newly minted CEO, Josh D’Amaro, and points to what she wants protected: creative nurturing at the highest level.\n\n\t“Josh mentioned the importance of nurturing and understanding — the creative is really at the heart of what we do,” she says, referring to a company town hall. “I’m excited for everything that’s coming.”\n\n\tAnd if “Zootopia 2” is, indeed, the kind of critical-and-commercial lightning strikes twice that sequels rarely become, it’s because Merino has this stubborn belief that craft, community and story always, ultimately win.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVeteran actor Joe Pantoliano is set to join the fifth and final season of “Power Book III: Raising Kanan” in a recurring guest role.\n\n\tPantoliano will portray Pino Bernardi, the head of the Manhattan Mafia. The character is described as “supremely self-assured and the epitome of the old adage, ‘speak softly and carry a big stick.’ He doesn’t need to tell you he’s a boss, because you know it already.” \n\n\n\tThe casting news arrives as the series heads into its final stretch following its Season 4 finale. The season ended with Kanan Stark (Mekai Curtis) standing with a gun trained on his mother, Raq Thomas (Patina Miller). \n\t\n\n\tAll four previous seasons of “Power Book III: Raising Kanan” are currently available to stream on the Starz app and across Starz streaming and on-demand platforms.\n\n\tPantoliano brings more than five decades of film and television experience to the role. He is widely known for his work in films including “The Matrix,” “Bound” and “The Fugitive,” as well as his Emmy-winning performance on “The Sopranos.” His recent credits include “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” “Dexter: Original Sin,” Marvel’s “Wonder Man” and his Emmy-nominated role in “The Last of Us.”\n\n\t“Power Book III: Raising Kanan” is the second installment in the expanding “Power” Universe. Season 5 is showrun and executive-produced by Sascha Penn. The series is executive-produced by Courtney A.

    "body": "\n\tSTAMFORD, Conn. — Chloe Kim, Jordan Stolz and Elizabeth Lemley trained hard to get to the 2026 Winter Olympics. So too have Andrew Siciliano and Scott Hanson — even though much of their work does not take place anywhere near ice or snow.\n\n\tOn one recent Sunday afternoon, Siciliano was tucked away in a corner of a production studio housed here at NBC Sports sprawling headquarters,  helping Olympics viewers on the Peacock streaming service navigate between men’s hockey, women’s ski jumping, men’s curling and the high-speed sledding sport known as skeleton. Each sport had its own display, in a single video square, and at any moment, Siciliano might tell viewers to give more focus to one or the other. If something particularly interesting or pivotal took place one of the squares might take up the entire screen. In other moments, NBC Sports producers  put up a “toast,” or an on-screen element viewers can click to go watch the specific sport without other distraction.\n\t\n\n\t“We didn’t invent America’s short attention span,” says Siciliano. “We just kind of came around at the right time.”\n\n\n\tWelcome to Gold Zone. The NBC Sports “whip-around” show takes its cues from the NFL’s Red Zone, an hours-long Sunday format that directs fans from one professional football game to another, checking in on crucial plays and riveting scenes. There are many who believe Gold Zone is just the first of a long line of new applications for the concept, in an era when more big media companies are scrambling to connect  with younger, digitally savvy viewers eager to see something of interest, and then quickly move on to something else of note.\n\t\n\n\t“Viewers may not want to see, say, the entirety of a curling match, but if it gets good, down to the wire, and/or features a nation or competitor they’re interested in, the format makes it super easy to focus on pivotal moments,” says Max Fuller, an assistant professor of sports media and journalism at Ithaca College. And while sports is a natural fit for the quick-hit structure, he adds, “this sort of format may be useful” in other areas, such as election coverage, or any event that has multiple elements all happening at the same time.\n\n\tHosts like Siciliano have already considered it. The sportscaster conjures up the idea of a debate with a more than a dozen candidates eager to speak to the public. “I’ve often joked that all 15 should be talking simultaneously into a single camera and then I’d be happy to host,” he quips. “I could go, ‘You know, the Senator from California just made a great point — let’s go there.’ Something like, ‘Let’s go to the former governor of Texas.’”\n\n\tBefore we’re distracted by the future, let’s take a trip into the past. While Gold Zone first won significant notice during the 2024 Paris Olympics, NBC has in fact been offering it for years. The concept was available during NBC’s 2012 Summer Olympics coverage from London, but via a digital site that didn’t have huge traction among viewers.\n\n\tThe streaming era changed everything. NBC put Gold Zone on Peacock for the Paris Olympics in 2024 and, suddenly, people found it. “My sister texted me and said, ‘You’re trending on Twitter. Gold Zone is trending on Twitter,’” recalls Amy Rosenfeld,. the NBC Sports veteran producer who oversees Gold Zone production. “As a TV producer, those are never words you want to hear, ever. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, my career is over. This is a dog. It’s going to be a mess.’ And it had some buzz. And it just sort of became a freight train.”\n\n\tIn the production studio, she says, “there are times where there’s eight or nine things happening simultaneously. But Paris was even more, and L.A. will be, like, mad.”\n\n\tOthers have already gotten on board. CBS News in 2024 unveiled a new “whip-around” format for its streaming properties. Viewers get taken to breaking news stories or moments taking place across areas covered by the company’s local stations. The Red Zone format was an inspiration for the concept. FanDuel Sports Network, the group of 15 regional sports outlets previously operated by Sinclair and Fox, last year introduced “FanDuel Sports Network Countdown Live,” as part of its early-evening lineup. The new hour-long program, hosted by former ESPN stalwart Stan Verrett, offers viewers a look at the run-up to key games taking place across the company’s entire portfolio.\n\t\n\n\tThe appeal is easy to understand, says Scott Hanson, who has been hosting NFL Red Zone since it launched in 2009. “It’s not that people have a short attention span,” he says. “No, it’s just that they want to shorten the time between those dopamine hits they get” between moments of interest. More media consumers are demanding such things, he says, particularly as people spend more time on Tik Tok or other short-from video display platforms. “Whoever I’m paying attention to, show me that you have eyes everywhere so that I don’t need to waste my time with anything. Trim the fat off it for me.”\n\n\tWorking for Gold Zone is tough, however, both on camera and off. On Red Zone, the announcers say, fans know what’s going on. They’re football diehards and don’t need the basics of curling spoon fed to them. “When I cut to a game on Red Zone, I’m saying why we’re watching this. It’s first and goal. It’s 14-14. There’s a minute left with no timeouts,” Hanson explains. “When I cut to an event on Gold Zone, I’m saying why we’re going there. But I also have to explain what we’re watching. What we’re looking for. Who we’re looking for. I don’t need to identify Dak Prescott to the Red Zone audience. I do need to identify Chloe Kim as one of the racers or competitors.”\n\n\tThe announcers need to study intensely, learning details not only about an athlete, but what a particular sport means to the populace of a country halfway around the world. They need to memorize factoids about specific competitors and explain to viewers why the coming moment is one they need to watch. Is there a medal at stake?  Is time slipping away? Is this something for the record books? “Prepping is extreme” says Hanson. “It’s like learning a different language,”  says Siciliano.\n\n\tSometimes, “it’s as if it’s as if you were in a blimp over the top of northern Italy with the most powerful telescope in the world,” says Hanson. “And from the blimp, you could see everything that was going on from a distance, and we’ll tell you when to zoom in telescopically to watch figure skating, to watch luge, to watch curling.”\n\n\tSports viewers — and perhaps general TV watchers? — may get a lot more of the format in the future. Under a deal recently struck between ESPN and the NFL, the Disney sports-media giant will be able to launch new kinds of Red Zone formats. Hanson believes it would work well for college football, maybe baseball, potentially golf. But how to isolate a pivotal moment in basketball or hockey when the action is more fluid? That, says Hanson, might be tough.\n\t\n\n\tThere may be surprising applications down the road, especially in an era when viewers want constant stimuli and distraction even as they watch an hour or two of TV. “I’ve had people suggest every type of Red Zone to me. Political Red Zone on an election night. Weather Red Zone, when a big snowstorm is sweeping across the northeast.  Reality TV Red Zone. Just show me when they’re pulling each other’s hair and throwing wine at each other’s faces.” says Hanson, who adds: “If anyone’s reading, if any network executives or power brokers are reading this, I’m open for business.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFifth Season has acquired the rights to the erotic novel “Beautiful Bastard” with plans to develop it as a TV series, Variety has learned exclusively. \n\n\tThe novel, which was published by Simon & Schuster in 2013, is written by Christina Lauren, the pen name of co-authors Christina Hobbs and Lauren Billings. Both Hobbs and Billings will co-write the TV version, with Bill Dubuque supervising. Dubuque will also produce with Kristen Campo, with the two having recently worked together on the Fifth Season-Netflix series “His & Hers.” \n\t\n\n\tPer the official description, “Beautiful Bastard” follows Chloe Mills, who is said to be “smart, ambitious, and on a fast track in her career—until her boss becomes the one complication she can’t ignore. Bennett Ryan is brilliant, demanding, and newly returned to Chicago to help run his family’s global media empire, and he expects nothing less than total control—of his business and himself. What he doesn’t expect is Chloe: a sharp, fearless junior executive who challenges him at every turn and refuses to be intimidated by his power. Their chemistry is instant and combustible, blurring the line between rivalry and desire as every argument crackles with temptation. As ambition collides with attraction, Chloe and Bennett must decide how much they’re willing to risk for a connection that refuses to stay professional.” \n\n\n\tThe novel was the first of what became known as the “Beautiful” series. Nine more novels and novellas have been published since, with the books having been translated into more than 30 languages. “Beautiful Bastard” has become an international bestseller, ranking on the New York Times and USA Today bestseller list and being named a finalist for Goodreads Readers’ Choice Romance of the Year. \n\t\n\n\tHobbs and Billings have written 21 New York Times bestselling novels. They have received numerous accolades for their work, and their novel “In a Holidaze” is being adapted for Netflix with Rob Lowe and Maddie Ziegler starring. Christina Lauren is repped by WME, Root Literary, and Weintraub Tobin. Dubuque is repped by WME and Goodman Genow. Campo is repped by WME and The Nord Group LLP.. \n",

However, authorities say the driver -- 32-year-old Jacob Novak -- was relatively uninjured and no children were riding in the bus at the time. The bus driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries.\n      \n\n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          Novak was cited for following too closely and headed home on foot -- the trouble seemingly in his rearview -- until cops received a call about a domestic battery incident later in the day.\n      \n    \n          According to a police report, a sheriff's deputy arrived at a house and made contact with Novak and an unidentified woman. Jackson claimed their altercation had been purely verbal, not physical.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Cops say two eyewitnesses told a different story ... one told police they'd seen Jacob push the woman several times up against a garage door.\n      \n    \n          According to the police, Jacob had several injuries from a crash sustained earlier in the day ... and deputies say they were not able to determine if the injuries were caused by the female, as they didn't seem to line up with what he alleged about their altercation.\n      \n    \n          Novak was eventually arrested for one count of battery, touch or strike (DV) and taken to jail.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Insane Videos\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive Details\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tMark your calendars: “The Boys” is back for one more round next April and we’ve got your first look  at the bloody battle ahead.\n\n\tThe fifth and final season of Amazon Prime Video’s satirical superhero series will premiere with its first two episodes on April 8. New episodes will be rolling out each week through the series finale launch May 20.\n\n\tPer the description for “The Boys” Season 5, “In the fifth and final season, it’s Homelander’s world, completely subject to his erratic, egomaniacal whims. Hughie, Mother’s Milk, and Frenchie are imprisoned in a ‘Freedom Camp.’ Annie struggles to mount a resistance against the overwhelming Supe force. Kimiko is nowhere to be found. But when Butcher reappears, ready and willing to use a virus that will wipe all Supes off the map, he sets in motion a chain of events that will forever change the world and everyone in it. It’s the climax, people. Big stuff’s gonna happen.”\n\t\n\n\tThe final-season premiere date announcement came out of “The Boys” panel at CCXP Brazil Saturday, where series creator Eric Kripke and some of the cast also showed off the first teaser trailer. In the video, which fans can view below, you’ll get a sneak peek of the on-screen reunion between “Supernatural” alums Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles. \n\n\n\tWhile Ackles is reprising his role as Soldier Boy, Padalecki’s part in “The Boys” has been kept under wraps. The teaser shows Padalecki’s unnamed character entering a room followed by Soldier Boy and Homelander (Antony Starr), hinting at a storyline between Padalecki and Ackles, who played brothers Dean and Sam Winchester for 15 seasons on the Kripke-created series “Supernatural.”\n\t\n\n\tAlso in the trailer, we see Butcher (Karl Urban) reunite with Hughie (Jack Quaid), Annie (Erin Moriarty) and The Boys after abandoning them at the end of Season 4. It appears they’re all going to go down swinging together to try to prevent the end of the world. \n\n\tIn addition to Urban, Quaid, Starr, Moriarty, Padalecki and Ackles, “The Boys” stars Jessie T. Usher, Laz Alonso, Chace Crawford, Tomer Capone, Karen Fukuhara, Colby Minifie, Cameron Crovetti, Susan Heyward, Valorie Curry.\n\n\tBased on Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson’s best-selling comic book series of the same name, “The Boys” TV series is created by showrunner Eric Kripke. Executive producers include Kripke, Ennis, Robertson, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, James Weaver, Neal H. Moritz, Pavun Shetty, Phil Sgriccia, Michaela Starr, Paul Grellong, David Reed, Judalina Neira, Jessica Chou, Gabriel Garcia, Ori Marmur, Ken F. Levin and Jason Netter. \n\n\t“The Boys” hails from Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios in collaboration with Kripke Enterprises, Original Film and Point Grey Pictures.\n\n\tThe series is the flagship show in a growing “The Boys” universe at Amazon, which also includes spinoffs “Gen V,” animated anthology “The Boys Presents: Diabolical” and the upcoming Ackles-led prequel “Vought Rising,” as well as a Mexico-set series still in the development stage.\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “The Boys” Season 5 here and via the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tPolen Ly’s “Becoming Human” has claimed the Golden Hanoman, the top prize at the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival (JAFF), which closed its milestone 20th anniversary edition in Yogyakarta on Dec. 6.\n\n\t“Captivating us with lyrical visual poetry and a tender meditation on memory, loss, and the fragile spaces that hold our shared stories, this film becomes a love letter to cinema itself,” the jury said in awarding the Golden Hanoman to “Becoming Human,” which debuted at Venice. The main competition jury comprised Eric Khoo, Suryana Paramita and Tumpal Tampubolon.\n\t\n\n\tRatchapoom Boonbunchachoke’s Cannes winner “A Useful Ghost” won the Silver Hanoman, with the jury praising its “audacious blend of absurd humor, emotional depth, and sharp social insight.” Antoinette Jadaone’s “Sunshine” received a special jury mention for its “poignant and unflinching commitment to standing beside women whose lives are circumscribed by state controls and societal judgment.”\n\n\n\tIn the Indonesian Screen Awards, Kristo Immanuel’s “Better Off Dead/Tinggal Meninggal” dominated with five wins including best film, best director and best screenplay (co-written with Jessica Tjiu). Omara Esteghlal won best performance for his work in the film, while Afiqa Kirana also received best performance honors for “The Period of Her.”\n\n\tThe festival drew more than 30,000 visitors over eight days, marking its largest and most significant edition to date. The event presented 227 films from 43 countries, including 27 world premieres and 87 Indonesian premieres, alongside 47 discussions, forums and public lectures.\n\t\n\n\tFestival director Ifa Isfansyah emphasized the ongoing challenges facing the film ecosystem. “Moving forward, the challenges will only grow — particularly in how we think about the sustainability of the film ecosystem amid rapid changes in media and digital landscapes,” he said, highlighting the urgency of film archiving initiatives.\n\n\t“Two decades of JAFF are about togetherness, celebration, and mutual trust,” Isfansyah added, noting that colleagues from international festivals have reached out to collaborate on concrete archiving steps.\n\n\tThe festival showcased works by 34 debut directors and 63 female directors, reinforcing its commitment to emerging talent and women filmmakers. The event was supported by 78 partners and collaborators.\n\n\tProgram director Alexander Matius highlighted the enthusiastic audience engagement throughout the festival. “Many discussions took place, including Q&A sessions with filmmakers that lasted well into the early hours of the morning and were attended enthusiastically by almost the entire audience,” he said.\n\n\tExecutive director Ajish Dibyo noted the festival’s environmental initiatives, including waste management efforts that processed more than 1,500 kilograms of waste this year. He also emphasized the growing involvement of younger generations within the organizing team as a positive sign for JAFF’s future sustainability.\n\n\tOther winners included Whammy Alcazaren’s “Water Sports,” which won both the Blencong Award and the Students Award for its innovative approach to climate change themes. “Becoming Human” also received the Netpac Award, while “Sunshine” claimed the Geber Award.\n\n\tThe festival’s industry component JAFF Market concluded earlier in the week. \n\t\n\t\tJAFF 2025 Winners\t\n\n\tMAIN COMPETITIONGolden Hanoman: “Becoming Human” (Polen Ly)Silver Hanoman: “A Useful Ghost” (Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke)Jury Special Mention: “Sunshine” (Antoinette Jadaone)\n\n\tBLENCONG AWARDWinner: “Water Sports” (Whammy Alcazaren)Jury Special Mention for Light of Asia: “Hyena” (Altay Ulan Yang)\n\n\tINDONESIAN SCREEN AWARDSBest Film: “Better Off Dead/Tinggal Meninggal” (Kristo Immanuel)Best Director: Kristo Immanuel (“Better Off Dead/Tinggal Meninggal”)Best Screenplay: Kristo Immanuel and Jessica Tjiu (“Better Off Dead/Tinggal Meninggal”)Best Cinematography: Vera Lestafa (“Dopamine”)Best Performance: Omara Esteghlal (“Better Off Dead/Tinggal Meninggal”), Afiqa Kirana (“The Period of Her”)Best Editing: Ryan Purwoko (“Better Off Dead/Tinggal Meninggal”)Best Production Design: Ahmad Zulkarnaen and Wahyu Efata (“Ikatan Darah”)Best Music: Anto Hoed, Melly Goeslaw (“Rangga & Cinta”)Best Sound Design: Pramudya Adhy Wardhana, Ridho Fachri, Renaldy Lomo, Alexandrie Dolly (“The Period of Her”)Best Poster Evan Wijaya and Jozz Felix (“Sore: A Wife From the Future/Sore: Istri Dari Masa Depan”)\n\t\n\n\tNETPAC AWARD“Becoming Human” (Polen Ly)\n\n\tGEBER AWARD“Sunshine” (Antoinette Jadaone)\n\n\tSTUDENTS AWARD“Water Sports” (Whammy Alcazaren)\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatthew Lillard had his feelings hurt by Quentin Tarantino.\n\n\tWhile speaking at GalaxyCon in Columbus, Ohio (via Entertainment Weekly), Lillard gave his reaction to the “Pulp Fiction” director saying, “I don’t care for Matthew Lillard” during a recent appearance on “The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast.”\n\n\t“Quentin Tarantino this week said he didn’t like me as an actor,” Lillard said to fans, provoking boos from the crowd. “Eh, whatever. Who gives a shit.”\n\t\n\n\tAlthough Lillard was quick to dismiss the comments, he added that it did actually make him sad that Tarantino wasn’t a fan of his work.\n\n\t“It hurts your feelings. It fucking sucks,” he said. “And you wouldn’t say that to Tom Cruise. You wouldn’t say that to somebody who’s a top-line actor in Hollywood.”\n\n\tLillard explained it reminded him that the love he receives while speaking to fans isn’t necessarily the affection he gets from the industry at large.\n\n\t“I’m very popular in this room. I’m not very popular in Hollywood,” Lillard said. “Two totally different microcosms, right? And so, you know, it’s humbling, and it hurts.”\n\n\tLillard isn’t the only actor to be targeted by Tarantino. During the same podcast appearance, the two-time Oscar winner called out Paul Dano, taking particular offense to his performance opposite Daniel Day-Lewis in “There Will Be Blood.”\n\n\t“Obviously, it’s supposed to be a two-hander. But it’s also drastically obvious that it’s not a two-hander,” Tarantino said. “[Dano] is weak sauce, man. He is the weak sister. [Daniel] is eating him [alive]. Austin Butler would have been wonderful in that role. He’s just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy. Daniel Day-Lewis shows that he doesn’t need a strong foil. The movie needs it. He doesn’t need anything. It’s supposed to be a two-hander and it’s not! … you put him with the weakest fucking actor in SAG? The limpest dick in the world?”\n",

    "body": "\n\tReceiving the Innovator of the Decade honor at Variety’s Hitmakers event on Saturday gave Tyler, the Creator a welcome opportunity to reflect on his accomplishments over the past 15 years, the artist told the crowd in Hollywood as he accepted his kudos.\n\n\tWhen Tyler was first informed that he’d been chosen for the award, he admitted to having been surprised. He reeled off a long list of legendary artists that he considers innovators, from Stevie Wonder to Kanye West to Pharrell to Missy Elliott.\n\t\n\n\t“It made me think like, ‘Yo, I don’t take the time out to look back at what I’ve done, for me, the folks around me, the last 15 years. For me, always looking forward — that’s where I sit comfortable at,” he said. “But damn, it does feel good to hear the last 15 years you’ve been doing super-duper, awesome shit. I’m so grateful y’all have noticed things I’ve done.”\n\n\n\tTyler’s award was presented by André 3000, who hailed his work to help mentor other artists and nurture those who also worked their way up the ranks. He also noted Tyler’s versatility as a musician, entrepreneur and actor, who stars in the upcoming “Marty Supreme” opposite Timothée Chalamet.\n\n\t“If you can inspire others to want to purely make something, you have done a great deed,” André 3000 said. When working with Tyler, “you can see his excitement, momentum and passion — it’s infectious. He cares about what he’s doing and innovating himself.”\n\n\tIn tandem with the award’s initial announcement, Josh Safdie, writer and director of “Marty Supreme,” said of the honor, “Tyler is a rare artist and creator in that everything he does is completely vertically integrated: There is little to no difference between a song and the larger picture, which is the album, or a bottle of cologne, or a T-shirt, or a music video he’s directing, or in this case, with me, a character that he’s developed.”\n\t\n\n\tTyler has been an unstoppable force in hip-hop over the past decade, since debuting with his Odd Future crew and releasing his debut studio album, “Bastard,” in 2009. He’s consistently reshaped and remolded rap music in his image, pushing the boundaries of what forms his artistry can take with forays into acting, fashion and beyond.\n\n\tLast year, he released his eighth studio album, “Chromakopia,” and shortly after embarked on a world tour. While traversing the globe, he began work on his ninth album, “Don’t Tap the Glass,” which was released with little warning in July. Both projects were nominated for the 2026 Grammy Awards, with “Chromakopia” up for album of the year and “Don’t Tap the Glass” contending in best alternative music album.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSabrina Carpenter showed up with gusto on Saturday at Variety‘s annual Hitmakers event, accepting her Hitmaker of the Year honor in front of a star- and executive-studded audience and quipping about the very action-packed year that brought her to this summit.\n\n\tThe pop superstar, who has seen her career explode in recent years, gave the Hollywood crowd some words of wisdom from an artist who started writing songs at the age of 10.\n\n\n\t“The easiest way to write a bad song is to try to write a hit,” Carpenter said. “Write the opposite of what you think a hit is. Write what speaks to you, write something that only you can write. Write the music you want to listen to yourself. Add the weird chord progression and key change, and call men stupid in as many ways as you can.”\n\t\n\n\tCarpenter’s kudo was presented by her longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff. The mega-producer and Bleachers member saluted Carpenter’s versatility as a performer, songwriter and artist who has handled the burdens of success well.\n\n\t“The really crazy thing is that she can write like that,” Antonoff said, praising Carpenter’s instincts as a tunesmith. \n\n\tCarpenter also has the utmost respect for her fans, he said. She starts out with “the assumption that people are smart,” he said. “If you really believe people are smart, you can get away with things. That key change in ‘Please Please Please’ that is so thrilling — that is the kind of stuff that matters and is interesting.”\n\n\tCarpenter, who read her remarks from a diary, praised songwriter Amy Allen, who was in the room, and others for being a support network that encourages her most “crazy ideas.” \n\t\n\n\tCarpenter expressed her gratitude and awe at the artistry that happens “every time we get the privilege to be in a room with things that make noise,” she said. \n\n\tThe artist who is riding high on the success of her latest single, “Manchild,” thanked her label home, Island Records, for their faith in her decisions, or what she described as “not trying to tell me what a hit is. That’s rare,” she said.\n\n\tCarpenter concluded with a shout-out to her audience. She echoed the comments of numerous Hitmaker award recipients in observing that songs are only hits after they are embraced by listeners.\n\n\t“Thank you to the fans that makes these hits,” Carpenter said.  “Thank you to the fans that learn the lyrics and sing the songs and make them hits — whatever that means.”\n\n\tCarpenter is currently nominated for six Grammy Awards, including the top three all-genre categories: album of the year, record of the year and song of the year. She’s also nominated for best pop vocal album, best pop solo performance and best music video.\n\n\tIn February, Carpenter won her first two Grammys, taking home prizes for best pop solo performance for “Espresso” and pop vocal album for “Short n’ Sweet.” Her first arena tour launched in September 2024, and in March, she set off on the European leg, before returning to the States this fall as it morphed into a “Man’s Best Friend” tour. “Manchild,” the single that preceded the latest album, became a blockbuster immediately upon release in June, followed by the full collection, which debuted to strong reviews in August. \n\n\tVariety‘s Hitmakers event had plenty of other star power. Fellow honorees at the luncheon included Rosé, Tyler, the Creator, Megan Moroney, BigXThaPlug, Role Model, Addison Rae, Tate McRae, Buddy Guy, Alex Warren, the Marías, the singing voices of HUNTR/X (EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI), Fuerza Regida, Sounwave, Mustard and Jack Antonoff.\n\n\tPresenters for the Hitmakers program included Laufey, Miles Caton, Benny Blanco, Jimmy Jam, Jake Shane and others.\n",

    "description": "\n\tThe title of Luigi Celeste’s memoir, “Non sarà sempre così”— which serves as the source material for Francesco Costabile’s more bluntly-titled Itali",
    "body": "\n\tThe title of Luigi Celeste’s memoir, “Non sarà sempre così”— which serves as the source material for Francesco Costabile’s more bluntly-titled Italian melodrama, “Familia” — translates to: “It won’t always be like this.” It’s an elegiac promise that has the whiff of a wistful warning. And considering what we learn about Celeste’s family in book and film alike, it’s a rather apt précis for the seemingly inescapable threat that looms over this young man’s life. Told with wounding simplicity and a candid sense of assurance (much of it due to the strength of the film’s tightly wound performances), “Familia” is a portrait of a family trying to escape the violent trappings of a father intent on reshaping it in his own image.\n\t\n\n\tWhen we first meet the Celeste family, they look like any other unit: Franco (Francesco Di Leva) and Licia (Barbara Ronchi) live in a homey apartment together with their two young boys, Luigi (Francesco De Lucia) and Alessandro (Stefano Valentini). It’s only in between their honed and familiar gestures that you begin to see what’s simmering underneath their placid smiles: Franco is a bully of a father and a husband. \n\n\n\tHis wife has learned to navigate his temper, while his boys have begun to see him with a mix of horror and awe. Franco is the kind of father who slaps his kid for not greeting him with a kiss, and then immediately embraces him against his will. Violence and tenderness are one and the same in that household: “When there are noises, we have to wait,” the brothers know — code for staying in their room while Franco hits Licia with impunity.\n\t\n\n\tBut that’s only preamble to the real story behind “Familia,” which quickly shatters the unnerving picture of the Celeste family when Licia finally stands up to Franco and gets the authorities involved. Costabile pierces through the staid formalism of his compositions (with a spare use of music that insists, instead, we linger in tense silence with this family) with an explosive scene where the husband and the young boys are taken from Licia — he to jail, they to social services. \n\n\tWhen we catch up with them all again years later, the grown-up boys and Licia have moved and made a different life for themselves away from Franco. But the scars from that incident, not to mention the damage from the time mother and sons spent apart while navigating a bureaucracy designed to keep kids safe from abusive households, lingers still in the apartment they all share. And so when Franco reappears in their lives, Luigi (Francesco Gheghi), in particular, will have to assess how much of his current life has been shaped by his father — and, most obviously, by his absence.\n\n\tCostabile’s film rightly focuses on Luigi, the sensitive boy who has grown to become an angered young man whose friends are neo-Nazis intent on nurturing his aggrieved sense of entitlement. As his father resurfaces in his life, slowly worming himself into family dinners and turning Licia once more into a defensive and defenseless pliable wife eager to keep her boys safe, Luigi is constantly trying to find place for his anger, for his melancholy, for his own sense of alienation. It makes sense that bearing witness to domestic violence at home would push him to contain and destroy the gentleness that had once shielded him; he both wants and loathes wanting to be his father. \n\n\tAt times, Costabile, Vittorio Moroni and Adriano Chiarelli’s adapted script plays like a character portrait of a fascist that’s all too simple and simplistic: Hurt people hurt people, yes, but also, violence begets violence. Yet Gheghi finds layers and textures within those bland platitudes, with Costabile’s camera lingering in the actor’s balled up fist of a performance enough to see the moments when it cracks open. \n\n\tFor instance, there’s a dinner party scene where DP Giuseppe Maio unnervingly steady camera begins in a medium shot that lets us see the entire family at the table, the tension slowly ratcheting up between father and son as we move in, ever so slowly, so we can see only the two of them in the shot, only to move closer in to offer an uncomfortable close-up of Luigi. Such steady, discomfiting formalism is felt throughout, and allows “Familia” to really settle into a naturalism that makes the heightened, violent tragedy to which it builds (the film feels almost Oedipal), all the more affecting.\n\t\n\n\tGiven how such a premise lends itself to overly familiar contemporary conversations around toxic masculinity and male loneliness — not to mention generational trauma — it’s quite revealing that it is Rochi’s wildly restrained take on Licia that most shines through. Di Leva (who won best supporting actor at the David di Donatello awards) and Gheghi (who won the Orizzonti Award for Best Actor at Venice in 2024) may have the showier roles, but it is Rochi’s quiet dignity as a woman who cannot imagine a way out from living with the man she thought she had outrun that is most devastating. Licia is a woman seemingly trapped in a life of her own making, whose agency has been ground to dust by the sheer presence of a man she once loved and now can only fear. And Rochi captures it all with her eyes, which feel like they’re constantly roaming around for an exit out of a story she can’t believe she’s forced to endure.\n\n\tItaly’s submission the Oscar international feature category is a rather modest affair, most successful when it zeroes in on its titular family unit. Less so, perhaps, when it twists itself into more of a stoic thriller whenever Luigi’s fascist friends come into the picture. Such genre-hopping makes it quite faithful, one imagines, to Celeste’s memoir; the young boy’s life felt like it could swing from maudlin melodrama to violent action film with the blink of an eye (or the punch of a fist). On screen, though, such disparate sensibilities all but cleave “Familia” in half. \n\n\tEven so, the vulnerable performances Costabile elicits from their actors (which thrive in the long, studied takes that echo the filmmaker’s previous work in documentary filmmaking) are what make the film sing. And they are what make the film’s final moments (part Hitchcock, part Almodóvar) more hopeful than they deserve to be, as if the Italian filmmaker had waited until their final shot to truly capture the promise of the title of Celeste’s memoir amid a bleakness that thankfully doesn’t feel overwhelming. It won’t always be like this; perhaps it can be different, but at what cost?\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe “Five Nights at Freddy’s” diehard fanbase has already made the sequel, which was released Friday via Universal Pictures, a box office champ. That seems largely due to a creative team that knows the IP and caters to the fans first.\n\n\t“Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” was scripted by Scott Cawthon, who created the video game series the films are based on. Emma Tammi returns to direct the second installment, and she revealed to Variety not only how she collaborated with Cawthon to bring his world to the big screen, but also how fan feedback helps to shape the films.\n\t\n\n\t“It was definitely something we took into consideration and listened to a lot,” she said. “Scott, for sure, in terms of incorporating certain things in the script, and me as well, in tonally making sure we were sticking the landing in terms of what it sounded like audiences really wanted out of a sequel. So it was something we internalized. I think this is kind of a uniquely collaborative exercise, making these ‘Five Nights at Freddy’s’ films with the fan base. We’re really listening to them hard. And even in the first film, I think Scott spent years and years thinking about it, and also listening to fans in terms of what their favorite parts of the lore were.”\n\n\n\tThat feedback included amping up the horror elements, which Tammi and Cawthon focused on directly with the sequel.\n\n\t“We were always toeing the line between trying to make it a satisfying horror experience and also make it a PG-13 accessible experience for a younger audience,” Tammi said. “I think we were able to push things even further this time tonally and in terms of the scares, both the amount of them and just the overall impact. I also think one of the cool things about the sequel is that Scott’s vision was always that each film, should we be able to make more than one, would correlate with the games. So the first film correlated with the first game, and the second one now with ‘FNAF 2.’ Just knowing how many more animatronics we were going to be incorporating into this film, because of how many more animatronics are in the second game, was a great jumping-off point that set the tone for the scale in an organic way. You can’t add a bunch more animatronics without adding a bunch more scares.”\n\t\n\n\tTammi also discussed how she collaborates with Cawthon to make sure their shared vision successfully makes it onto the big screen.\n\n\t“We’re definitely talking about the story all the way through the script writing process, but throughout prep and production, things are still changing,” she said. “Working with the actors on their character arcs also has been a really collaborative process, and I think it has helped flesh out some of the human characters that we’re tracking — not just from a lore perspective, but from our own canon within the films. So we’re in super close discussion about all of those things. In terms of the way things are shot, there are certain sequences where our communication gets super meticulous, and then other things where Scott’s watching, and if he has any thoughts, I’ll hear from him, but we’re on our road to making the movie as best we can, and he appreciates that. It’s a very collaborative process throughout, including post-production, marketing and all the things. He’s very involved.”\n\n\tBy having the game’s mastermind so involved, the team is able to fill the films with easter eggs while also keeping it accessible enough for audiences unfamiliar with the dense backstory to understand.\n\n\t“Some of the feedback from the first one — obviously this is coming from the fan base and less so from a general audience — was that they did want a little bit more service to the gameplay, which we definitely have in this movie,” Tammi said. “The whole film is loaded with easter eggs and moments that I think are super exciting for the fans to see, especially together. We just had a premiere screening on Tuesday, and getting to hear people clapping at certain moments and respond to easter eggs that we’ve not yet heard reactions of was so satisfying and exciting. Even the people in the audience who didn’t know anything about the lore or the game got such a kick out of those moments because they knew they were special for some reason, and they didn’t know exactly why. But it was still a fun ride to be on with them.”\n\n\tWatch the “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” trailer below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tRealtor and star of Netflix’s “Owning Manhattan,” Ryan Serhant, has a motto that drives him to success: “Expansion, always in all the ways.”\n\n\tBut that expansion comes at a price.\n\n\tThe company is now four years old, and Season 2 of the series follows the CEO and his team of top agents as they sell some of the city’s hottest properties, including a showstopping penthouse at 200 Amsterdam Avenue with an asking price of $31 million.\n\t\n\n\tAudiences have seen Serhant go from Bravo’s “Million Dollar Listing” to the CEO of his over company. The pressures of managing the company and being a parent take their toll.\n\n\n\tThroughout the season, audiences see as Serhant struggles, and the stress gets too much to the point that he has an emotional breakdown on screen. It’s his most revealing moment yet.\n\n\t“No one cries for the person at the top,” says Serhant when asked about showing this vulnerable side.\n\n\tWorld of Wonder co-founders and the show’s executive producers, Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, who also produced Bravo’s “Million Dollar Listing,” cast the rising realtor in the New York edition of the franchise. Bailey said, “Ryan does always present as a selling machine, but there is this other side to him that I think he keeps closely guarded, because he is such a sales force.” Bailey continued, “To see it was really great, because I think perhaps some people don’t believe he’s got that.” He added, “He’s a big softie.\n\n\tBarbato concurred, “This is just the first time he’s truly revealed the depth of his vulnerability, and that’s what makes this season so compelling, and that is also why Ryan has been so successful for so long, because he isn’t just a selling machine, there’s a real depth there to connect with.”\n\t\n\n\tThat vulnerability adds to the emotional stakes of the new season. In addition to exposing this emotional side, familiar faces return. Chloe Tucker Caine is back to work after maternity leave, and she has plenty of work to do.\n\n\tFormer Corcoran broker Peter Zaitzeff joins the company and goes head-to-head with the agents and competes to get his name on the sales board.\n\n\tHere, Serhant talks about showing this side to him, company growth and how the mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has impacted Manhattan real estate.\n\t\n\t\tI’m going to start with the final episode because all season we’re seeing your struggle to be this great dad to your daughter, but you also have to focus on work and you’re shown to be at your most vulnerable as you sacrifice family. What was that like, allowing that to be filmed on camera?\t\n\n\tI haven’t talked about that yet, because I’ve only seen it once. Season 1 was a startup story. I was on the defensive the entire time. As a startup, l was like, “We’re not going to make it. This is insane. Why am I doing this? People are leaving. I’m firing people on camera live. I’m going to put all this out there to the world.” It was incredibly stressful. The people that I was letting go of were not good for my enterprise. So they were the villain.\n\n\tEvery show has a hero, and every show has a villain, whether you like it or not. You’ve got Romeo, and you’ve got Mercutio. And I personally was struggling while we were filming the show, because we film in real time. We film September through May, whatever happens happens, which I think is the magic to making a great show like this. Nothing is forced. Everything is authentic, whether you like it or not, and you’ve got to show up and be vulnerable every day. Otherwise, no one cares anymore. I was struggling the whole time because I was like, “I don’t think there’s a villain. Who’s my villain?” And then I watched the show, and I have a text message to Randy and Fenton and one of our other executive producers, Kelly, saying, “Oh my God, is my villain me?” I’m the villain of my own story. What just happened? I sat there at the end of the finale. I felt incredibly terrified, scared and nervous. I remember the deal I made with myself, my family, the people around me, that if I’m going to do a TV show, there’s no point in making something average, it’s got to be something no one has ever seen before, and you have to go big, or you gotta go home, and that means putting everything out there, whether you like it or not. It’s uncomfortable for me. If that story helps anyone else, then I guess it was worth putting it out there.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBut it’s this theme that runs through the show, and it is so relatable. Everyone struggles with that balance. I guess I should ask you, how are you doing?\t\n\n\tI’m going to get texts asking if I’m ok. But I’m so excited. We’ve been working on this for such a long time. I think you have good days and you have bad days. I built a real estate business on the back of Bravo, and I’m building a real estate company in real time, on the back of Netflix. I have never seen anyone do that before, and that’s something I find very exciting. I built a real estate team and an entire business season by season, and took it to the next level. And I am better now. At the time, it was a lot. No one cries for the person at the top, but heavy is the head that wears the crown. It is not all it’s cracked up to be, and what you end up dealing with all day long are the things that no one else can handle. That’s what I do.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s talk about growth, and Chloe mentions it in Episode 3. How much has Serhant grown since the end of Season 1? I remember last time we spoke, after the show aired, you said the Serhant website crashed.\t\n\n\tWe’re so ready now. It did. It was insane.\n\n\t“Owning Manhattan” came out in June 2024. We gained a million followers and subscribers across accounts just from the global awareness. We were in a couple of markets, but we were predominantly in Manhattan. It’s what we do, and it’s the majority of our revenue today. So 18 months later, I just opened in my 14th state. We went from a couple of hundred people to 1500 people. Now I have a staff of 200 to help manage. I raised money. You see that in the episode, too. You also see a venture fundraise. I’ve never seen a venture fundraise, and I give Netflix a lot of credit too, for looking at everything we shot and not just saying, “Nah, that’s not the format, or nah, that’s not what people want to see.” This show is a window that no one’s opened before, and what’s inside that window.\n\n\tWe raised the largest prop tech seed round in history. I’m on my way to opening in 12 more states and doubling the size of the company. My hope was in Season 1 that we were going to do, $3 billion that year. We do a billion dollars a month, and moving fast.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve talked about the power of social media. You’ve been using it to promote the season. How has that changed the business?\t\n\n\tA couple of ways. Most real estate brokerages and tech companies buy revenue. You incentivize customers to come to you instead of going elsewhere, especially when you’re building and growing, you go buy agents, and you buy teams. That’s what banks do, all companies, until you get to a point of equilibrium, when everybody wants an income too. Because of Netflix and social, I’ve never bought a single dollar of revenue at this company.\n\t\n\n\tWe’re going into great markets because the demand for what we do, compared to our competition, is so strong. As you can imagine, a lot of people who watch the show are in the real estate business, and we have people ready to set up Serhant offices all over the world because of Netflix and then because of social.\n\t\n\t\tThe season finale was interesting with the possible partnership with Harley and Jeffrey. I thought, “That’s quite a cliffhanger to end on.”\t\n\n\tThe music plays, and my eyes look up, and I break the fourth wall.\n\n\tThe show opens with me turning to the camera, which I think just sets the audience up to think, “I don’t understand what I’m watching now. This is not normal.” I don’t do it again until the final scene of the season. I love that book end, and I fought to have more, because the audience is watching the growth and fall through my eyes, so let’s talk to the camera more. We shot a lot more of me, but credit to our producing team and Randy and Fenton, who said, “Ryan, you don’t know everything. The book end is what works the best.” And I agree now.\n\t\n\t\tI have to ask, after Zohran Mamdani was elected, people were like, “I’m going to leave New York. I’m moving to Florida.” Are people from New York really taking an interest in Florida real estate?\t\n\n\tSome people have taken an interest in Florida real estate for a long time. It goes from warm to hot back to warm, and it is a tax advantageous state, not just to live in, but to build. It incentivizes companies as much as it incentivizes individuals to be there.\n\n\tMaybe 36 hours of the Mamdani discount, we sold a townhouse in Gramercy, the next day, for half off, because the seller thought the world was over. They took a deal. It was $14 million. Our client got it for $7.5 million and signed a contract nearly immediately. Politicians come and go. New York City is forever. Manhattan has gone through terrorist attacks, hurricanes, financial collapse, and global pandemics. It can go through one politician. We made it through David Dinkins. We can do anything.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

She appears to be getting ready for the NYC premiere of \"The Housemaid.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          She spent the last few days in the Big Apple promoting the psychological thriller with her costar Amanda Seyfried, who joined her in several snaps and clips Sydney included in her Saturday post. The pair look like they've created a fun friendship as they painted self-portraits and clowned around during press interviews. They also both appeared on \"The Today\" show, which Sydney gave a BTS glimpse at as well.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The dynamic duo looked incredible as they walked the red carpet for the NYC premiere of \"The Housemaid\" Tuesday night, with Sydney flaunting her physique in a tight, sequined dress that put her bust front and center. Amanda, meanwhile, looked pretty in pink in her ruched gown.\n      \n    \n          The \"Euphoria\" star didn't just talk about \"The Housemaid\" this week -- she also cleared the air surrounding the American Eagle ad controversy that erupted over the summer. If you recall, people thought the ad's \"Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\" slogan had underlying tones of white supremacism.\n      \n    \n                    \n                          \n                                  \n      \n        \n    \n          Sydney candidly spoke about it during an interview with People, saying she's \"against hate and divisiveness.\" She also defended her morals, noting ... \"Many have assigned motives and labels to me that just aren’t true.\"\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Sydney Sweeney\n              \n                          \n                Amanda Seyfried\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Hot Bodies\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

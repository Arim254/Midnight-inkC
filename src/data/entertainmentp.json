    "body": "\n\tKevin Spacey announced in an interview with The Telegraph that he is officially homeless after his Hollywood film career came crashing down amid various sexual assault allegations.\n\n\t“I’m living in hotels, I’m living in Airbnbs,” the two-time Oscar winner said. “I’m going where the work is. I literally have no home, that’s what I’m attempting to explain… The costs over these last seven years have been astronomical. I’ve had very little coming in and everything going out.”\n\t\n\n\tSpacey fought back tears during an interview on “Piers Morgan Uncensored” in June 2024 when he first disclosed that his home in Baltimore, Maryland was going into foreclosure because he “owed millions” in legal fees due to various sexual assault claims against him. Spacey had been living in the city since “House of Cards” started production in 2012. He was fired from the show by Netflix in 2017 due to alleged sexually inappropriate behavior on set.\n\n\n\t“I’m not sure where I am going to live now… I can’t pay the bills that I owe,” Spacey told Morgan at the time.\n\n\tSince claims of Spacey’s alleged sexual assaults and inappropriate behavior first arose in the wake of the #MeToo movement in 2017, several legal cases have been brought against him. A jury in New York concluded in 2022 that Spacey did not molest actor Anthony Rapp, who had accused him of sexual assault in the early 1980s when Rapp was 14. The next year, a U.K. court found Spacey not guilty of nine charges of sexual assault from four complainants. Several other charges and lawsuits have been dropped. Spacey has denied all the allegations.\n\t\n\n\t“We are in touch with some extremely powerful people who want to put me back to work,” Spacey told The Telegraph about returning to high-profile acting gigs. “And that will happen in its right time. But I will also say what I think the industry seems to be waiting for is to be given permission — by someone who is in some position of enormous respect and authority.” \n\n\t“So, my feeling is if Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino call [my manager, Evan Lowenstein] tomorrow, it will be over,” he added. “I will be incredibly honored and delighted when that level of talent picks up the phone.”\n\n\tVarious actors spoke to The Telegraph last year and championed Spacey’s return to Hollywood. Sharon Stone called Spacey a “genius” and said: “I can’t wait to see Kevin back at work.” Liam Neeson said that “our industry needs him and misses him greatly.”\n",

Variety‘s Emmy-winning series, which pairs the best performers of the year in unscripted interviews, will air on CNN for the first time.\n\n\tUnder a new partnership, the upcoming 23rd season of Actors on Actors will be co-produced by Variety and CNN.

    "body": "\n\tTwo nonprofit organizations devoted to supporting emerging filmmakers and creatives have teamed with Adobe to launch career development programs.\n\n\tRideback RISE, the creative incubator established by producer Dan Lin in 2022, and Highways Lab have joined forces to execute the Highways Lab Directors Program and the Gloria Schoemann Program. \n\n\tThe director program will offer a $50,000 grant and other support to help emerging filmmakers complete a short film.\n\t\n\n\tThe Schoemann initiative targets mid-career editors who are bilingual in English and Spanish to receive mentorship and exposure in the industry. It’s named for the prolific Mexican editor who cut many of Mexico’s Golden Age movies in the 1940s, ’50s and ’60s.\n\n\n\tHighways Lab is an initiative created by actress and producer Olga Segura.\n\n\t“As an independent filmmaker, I am uniquely aware of the lack of resources and opportunities that exist. With this program we wanted to offer advanced filmmakers a new avenue for funding to develop a short film based on their next feature film,” Segura said. “With Adobe’s invaluable partnership we aim to support filmmakers in bringing their visions to life and expanding the possibilities for independent cinema. It was also important to me to honor one of the most extraordinary editors in cinema, Gloria Schoemann, by spotlighting her remarkable contributions to film while also creating space for today’s bilingual editors.”\n\n\tRideback RISE operates a filmmaker incubator program out of its creative work space, a refurbished post office facility in the Historic Filipinotown neighborhood of Los Angeles. \n\t\n\n\tThe inaugural group of Highways Lab fellows and their projects include:\n\n\t** Aitch Alberto (“Aristotle & Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe,” “Duster”) \n\n\t“The Long Con”: A con-artist runaway bride and her grifter lover face off at a desert motel in a romantic noir standoff about trust, betrayal, and love\n\n\t** Ana María Hermida (“La Luciérnaga,” “Alix”)\n\n\t“Madrecita”: A reluctant pregnant biologist’s psychedelic journey forces her to confront the fear of motherhood.\n\n\t** Omar Kamara (“African Giants,” “Mass Ave”)\n\n\t“Calabash”: A culture-clash comedy in which a son of West African immigrants and his African American bride battle familial hijinks threatening to derail their wedding day.\n\n\t** Aristotle Torres (“Story Ave”)\n\n\t“The Co-Op”: After winning a coveted NYC housing lottery, Dre discovers his dream building conceals a dark ritual led by the co-op board.\n\n\tThe participants were selected by Highways Lab and Rideback RISE with consultation from filmmakers Jay Van Hoy (“American Honey,” “The Witch”), Helen Estabrook (“Whiplash,” “Tully”) , and Kimberly Peirce (“Boys Don’t Cry,” “Carrie”). In addition, filmmakers Isabel Castro (“Selena and Los Dinos,” “Mija”) and Yolanda Cruz (“La Raya”) who took part in a proof of concept program last year, will become part of the Highways Lab Directors Program and receive a development grant. \n\n\tThe Highways Lab filmmakers will attend the Sundance Film Festival in January to showcase their short films.\n\n\t“At a time when visionary filmmakers are navigating unprecedented challenges, our exciting collaboration with Highways Lab and Adobe reflects Rideback RISE’s mission to empower creators with the resources, expertise, and community they need to thrive,” said Diana Mogollon, CEO of Rideback RISE. “Through this important partnership, storytellers can accelerate the path from idea to impact and open doors that have too often remained closed.”\n\n\tFor the Schoemann program, the fellows were chosen by invitation to take part in a wo-week masterclass series from Oct. 27-Nov. 7. Each participant received a $15,000 grant October 27 to November 7, led by experienced editors, directors, and Adobe experts. The initial class of Schoemann fellows includes:\n\n\t** Daniel Chavez-Ontiveros (“Unseen,” “Sansón and Me”)** Alma Herrera-Pazmiño (“All Up In the Biz,” “Selena y Los Dinos”)** Salvador Pérez García (“Jagged Mind,” “Icebox”)** Daniela Quiroz (“Going Varsity in Mariachi,” “The Strike”)** Mónica Salazar (“Honey Boy,” “Bardo: False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths”)\n\t\n\n\tBoth programs are supported by the Adobe Film + TV fund that was established in 2024 to work with   nonprofits help support the career development of creators and filmmakers from all backgrounds.\n\n\t(Pictured: Aitch Alberto, Ana María Hermida, Aristotle Torres and Omar Kamara)\n",

    "body": "\n\t“House of the Dragon” has been renewed for Season 4, which is set to debut on HBO sometime in 2028.\n\n\tThe third season of the Targaryen-filled “Game of Thrones” prequel is due in summer 2026. The renewal announcement came during an HBO press presentation in New York, where CEO Casey Bloys also announced that the other “Game of Thrones” prequel series, the upcoming “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,” was also renewed for second season before its first season debut on Jan. 18. The second season is slated for 2027, meaning “Thrones” fans will have new dispatches out of Westeros every year through 2028.\n\t\n\n\tBased on George R. R. Martin’s “Fire & Blood,” “House of the Dragon” follows the Targaryen family 200 years before the events of “Game of Thrones.” (In other words, a handful of generations before the birth of Daenerys.) It stars Matt Smith, Emma D’Arcy, Olivia Cooke, Steve Toussaint, Rhys Ifans, Fabien Frankel, Ewan Mitchell, Tom Glynn-Carney, Sonoya Mizuno, Harry Collett, Bethany Antonia, Phoebe Campbell, Phia Saban, Jefferson Hall, Matthew Needham, James Norton, Tom Bennett, Kieran Bew, Kurt Egyiawan, Freddie Fox, Clinton Liberty, Gayle Rankin and Abubakar Salim.\n\n\n\tRyan Condal is the creator and showrunner, executive producing alongside co-creator Martin, Sara Hess, Melissa Bernstein, Kevin de la Noy, Vince Gerardis, David Hancock and Philippa Goslett.\n\n\t“We are thrilled to be able to deliver new seasons of these two series for the next three years, for the legion of fans of the ‘Game of Thrones’ universe,” said Francesca Orsi, the EVP of HBO programming and head of the cabler’s drama series and films. “Together, ‘House of the Dragon’ and ‘A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms’ reveal just how expansive and richly imagined George R. R. Martin’s universe continues to be. In January, I think audiences will be delighted by the inspiring underdog tale of Dunk and Egg that George and Ira Parker have captured so beautifully. And this summer, ‘House of the Dragon’ is set to ignite once again with some of its most epic battles yet.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Red Sea Intl. Film Festival has announced the first creative talents who will be speaking at the In Conversation series at this year’s festival.\n\n\tThese include British Egyptian actor Amir El Masry, the star of the festival’s opening film “Giant,” and the Tunisian director of Academy Award-nominated “Four Daughters,” Kaouther Ben Hania, whose film “The Voice of Hind Rajab” will be presented as a special screening this year.\n\t\n\n\tThey are joined by Saudi actor Yaqoub Alfarhan, known for “Norah” and “Algaid,” who will present his film “A Matter of Life and Death”; and Egyptian star Lebleba, who will present her most recent film, “Wedding Rehearsal.”\n\n\n\tThe In Conversation series sees “global filmmakers and actors sharing their stories and revealing the successes and challenges they’ve had during their careers,” the festival said.\n\n\tEl-Masry was born in Cairo and raised in London. He gained early recognition in Egypt before attending the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and achieving breakout success in the 2016 mini-series “The Night Manager.” He is known for his roles in projects such as “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” and “Limbo,” for which he won a BAFTA Award. He will also be at Red Sea to present his other recent film “The Stories,” which is in competition at the festival.\n\n\tHania Kaouther studied cinema in Tunisia and Paris (FEMIS and La Sorbonne). She has directed several short films, feature films and documentaries, including “The Man Who Sold His Skin,” “Beauty and the Dogs,” “Zaineb Hates the Snow” and “The Challat of Tunis.” Her films have been featured at prestigious international festivals such as Cannes, Venice, Locarno, and the Academy Awards, including her acclaimed work “Four Daughters” – which was supported by the Red Sea Foundation.\n\t\n\n\tAlfarhan began his artistic career in theater. He is known for several notable stage productions, including “Quick Meal,” “Secret of Life,” “The Lucky One” and “Second Symphony.” His television work features appearances in popular series such as “Between You and Me,” “Women’s Play Is a Man” and “Girls’ Extension.”\n\n\tLebleba began her career as a child prodigy in Egyptian cinema in the mid-1950s.

    "body": "\n\tTim Robinson‘s HBO comedy “The Chair Company” has been renewed for a Season 2. News of the show’s pickup came during a New York press presentation by HBO and HBO Max Content chairman Casey Bloys — who also revealed several more series renewals as part of the programmer’s slate.\n\n\tRobinson and Zach Kanin are behind “The Chair Company,” which the pay cabler called “HBO’s top freshman comedy in platform history,” averaging 3.3 million viewers in the U.S. via live+3 cross-platform averages. The show was picked up simultaneously with another freshman HBO comedy, Rachel Sennott’s “I Love LA.”\n\t\n\n\tAmy Gravitt, EVP, HBO Programming, Head of HBO & HBO Max Comedy Series, quote: “We’re thrilled by the incredible response to ‘The Chair Company’ and ‘I Love LA,'” HBO & HBO Max comedy head and HBO programming exec VP Amy Gravitt said in a statement. “Both shows confidently carry on the HBO comedy tradition, in their own singular way. We couldn’t be happier to continue collaborating with Tim, Zach, Rachel, and their exceptional teams.”\n\n\n\tHBO noted that “The Chair Company” currently boasts a perfect 100 score from critics on “Rotten Tomatoes.” The series stars Robinson as a man “who, after an embarrassing incident at work, finds himself investigating a far-reaching conspiracy.”\n\n\tThe eight-episode first season of “The Chair Company,” which bowed last month, will wrap with a season finale on Nov. 30.\n\n\tRobinson stars as William Ronald Trosper, while Lake Bell plays Barb Trosper, Sophia Lillis is Natalie Trosper, Will Price plays Seth Trosper, and Joseph Tudisco is Mike Santini. The show also features Lou Diamond Phillips in a recurring role as Jeff Levjman. Robinson and Zach Kanin exec produce, along withAdam McKay and Todd Schulman for HyperObject Industries, Andrew DeYoung, and Igor Srubshchik. Andrew DeYoung and Aaron Schimberg are the series directors. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIn 1985, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer decided to make it official.\n\n\tThe creative partners were riding high off a pair of unlikely box office hits — “Night Shift,” a raunchy Michael Keaton comedy about morgue employees who launch an escort service, and “Splash,” a surprisingly sweet mermaid love story with a young Tom Hanks — and they wanted to launch a production company. But they couldn’t find the right name for their business. \n\t\n\n\t“We came up with the idea to call it ‘If?’” Grazer says via Zoom from his Los Angeles office. “As in ‘What if?’ What if I met a mermaid? What if I had the worst job in the world and had to work the night shift? And what would I do? I would probably open a prostitution ring.” \n\n\n\tBut the company’s investors balked. “This was the go-go ’80s,” Howard says. “And we were going to be a public company, and our bankers said, ‘You don’t want to go to the Street with a question mark; you go to the Street with an exclamation mark!’” \n\n\tSo the pair embraced a more declarative moniker, but one that conveyed the wonder and curiosity that would fuel many of the company’s biggest hits — Imagine. From space adventures (1995’s “Apollo 13”) to fantasy epics (1988’s “Willow”) to inspirational dramas (2001’s “A Beautiful Mind”) to crime thrillers (2007’s “American Gangster”) to family-friendly comedies (2000’s “How the Grinch Stole Christmas”), Imagine Entertainment has taken audiences on far-flung journeys to worlds that may seem very distant from their own, but are populated with relatable characters.  \n\t\n\n\t“Brian often says filmmaking is emotional, not intellectual,” Howard, still boyish at 71, says from the Budapest production office of his next film, “Alone at Dawn.” “Whatever we’re working on, we want to get to that place where the audience understands what it is we love about the idea, so they can find their own personal connection with the story.” \n\n\tThe two men could not be more different. Howard is folksy and wholesome, whereas Grazer, an unabashed disruptor at 74, radiates manic intensity (and that’s not just because of his spiky hair). Still, Howard and Grazer’s 40-year partnership is one of the most successful and long-lasting in Hollywood history. And it has endured tectonic shifts in the entertainment business. In an effort to evolve with the times, Imagine has expanded its portfolio beyond feature films and television shows by launching divisions specializing in documentaries and branded content.  \n\n\t“They rarely look back; they’re always looking forward,” says Justin Wilkes, Imagine Entertainment’s president. “The other day, we had an internal staff meeting, and Brian got up and said, ‘Look, there’s all this crazy stuff happening in the industry. I guess you’re all wondering, Why do I still want to do this?’ And he said, ‘I do it because I love it. I do it because when we get it right, the power of a story can bring people together.’” \n\n\tImagine hasn’t been immune to failure — “After the Hunt,” a #MeToo drama it produced, fizzled at the box office and failed to connect with critics when it opened in October. But the company has remained relevant by forging partnerships with many of the new players in the industry, signing an overall deal with Amazon MGM Studios and working with streamers like Apple and Netflix. Howard and Grazer maintain Imagine is busier than ever, noting it has five movies in production, including the adventure film “Whalefall”; the heist thriller “How to Rob a Bank”; and “Spaceballs 2.” On the television front, Imagine will reboot two beloved shows, “Friday Night Lights” and “24,” and is producing “Wild Things,” a limited series with Jude Law and Andrew Garfield playing Siegfried & Roy. And Howard, who became famous as a young actor on “The Andy Griffith Show” and “Happy Days,” recently returned to his comedy roots, earning an Emmy nomination for sending up his nice-guy image with his volcanic guest role on “The Studio.”  \n\t\n\n\tTo mark the company’s anniversary, Howard and Grazer sat down with Variety to discuss Imagine’s legacy and the future of an art form they want to continue to shape.  \n\n\tMost marriages can’t last 40 years. What’s your secret?  \n\n\tBrian Grazer: Our taste is the same. What Ron thinks is high quality, I think is high quality. Then our work ethic is similar. If he only wanted to work eight hours a day and I wanted to work 12, there’d be a problem. But we’re aligned. And we trust each other.   \n\n\tRon Howard:In this field, you want support but also honesty. We ask direct questions; we get direct answers. We share our opinions openly, but we also trust each other’s passion and beliefs. So if one of us disagrees with an idea or a project but the other one is really committed, we don’t undermine it or stand in the way.  \n\n\tWhen you have disagreements, how do they play out?  \n\n\tGrazer:We operate with a level of respect. We never really raise our voices or yell. In fact, I talk to Ron exactly the way Seth Rogen spoke to him on “The Studio” — very gently. There was one time I absolutely hated the score of one of his movies. And he asks, “What do you think?” And I go, “Well … I’m not sure.” [He pauses for dramatic effect.] “It’s just not for me.” \n\n\tHoward: I’ve learned to read those hesitations as meaningful. And I don’t throw my hat or erupt the way I did with Seth Rogen on that show.  \n\n\tWhat’s a film that one of you was passionate about and the other just didn’t get?   \n\n\tHoward: For me, it was “8 Mile.” Brian kept saying, “I want to do a hip-hop movie. It’s a fascinating world.” I didn’t get it.  \n\n\tGrazer: Well, it was a time when not a lot of people were doing rap movies. But I always believed it wasn’t a subculture movie — it was a cultural event. I had gotten into that world. I met with the Wu-Tang Clan, Ol’ Dirty Bastard and Chuck D from Public Enemy. And Ron wasn’t on that journey with me. And there’s a few movies that Ron has made that I didn’t see initially.  \n\n\tHoward: Brian originally didn’t understand “Rush” and the Formula 1 world. He started to get it when the cuts came together. That’s the beauty of the company and why we’re prolific — I don’t have to love “8 Mile”; he doesn’t have to love “Rush.” Because we’re both capable individuals, we can get a lot of shit done. But when we are aligned, that’s when our batting average is highest and we’ve had our biggest successes. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRussell Crowe on the set of Imagine’s “A Beautiful Mind,” directed by Howard in 2001\n\t\n\n\n\n\tYou tend to make movies for adults, but those are the type of films that are struggling at the box office. Do you worry about the theatrical business?   \n\n\tGrazer: Optimally, I want to make movies that are released theatrically. I don’t do DC movies. So in order for that to happen, they need a really exciting, explosive subject. They may be effects driven or about something sexy and combustible. They should have a star, and if they don’t, they need a hugely unpredictable story.   \n\n\tHoward: You’ve got to meet audiences where they are. It takes a long time to make a film, so it’s hard to know how it’s going to fit into the marketplace by the time it’s released. But we’re not wasting time being nostalgic about what used to play in theaters. We’re just trying to find stories that we love. \n\n\tIt does seem like some of your greatest movies would have debuted on streaming if they were made today.  \n\n\tGrazer: We made a movie called “Frost/Nixon” that was well received and got Oscar nominations, but that probably would be a streaming movie. But then “Apollo 13” would probably be a theatrical movie. Many of the comedies that we did with Eddie Murphy and Arnold Schwarzenegger — or Jim Carrey in “Liar Liar” and “The Grinch” — would be theatrical because they’re driven by stars. \n\n\tHoward: It’s interesting to think about where something like “A Beautiful Mind” would land, but it would land somewhere, because with the kind of performance that Russell Crowe gives, it would find its audience. \n\n\tYou lived through enormous upheavals in the entertainment industry — from the birth of cable to the rise of streaming to the collapse of Peak TV. People say the amount of change taking place today is unprecedented, and that it’s never been harder to work in Hollywood. Do you agree?   \n\n\tHoward: It’s paradoxical. There used to be more absolute roadblocks, like you’re not going to get a movie made in Hollywood in 1983 if you couldn’t get a studio interested. That’s not the case now. If you have the drive and the passion to tell a story, you can find a way to get it produced. That’s liberating. It can still be hard to get a company to invest in or distribute it, but the barriers aren’t there in the same way, and you can get it out there in some capacity.  \n\t\n\n\tWhen did you first meet?   \n\n\tGrazer: We both went to USC. We didn’t really know each other, but we have a strong memory of encountering each other. \n\n\tHoward: We crossed paths again at NBC. We were like 24. The first really powerful female executive was a woman named Deanne Barkley, and she liked both of us. One day, Brian was leaving a pitch meeting with her, and she said, “Oh, you guys should know each other; you’re gonna wind up running the business someday.” A couple of years later, we really met on the Paramount lot, where we were the youngest guys to have offices. \n\n\tWhat made you want to work together?  \n\n\tHoward: Brian had this idea and set up meetings for us to pitch a movie together. We had seven meetings at every major studio. And they were quality meetings. My agent had never been able to do that, but Brian did. He opened a lot of doors. \n\n\tGrazer: We never made that movie, but it was about the Peppermint Lounge. It was a groovy club that was very vibey.  \n\n\tRon, you’ve worked in many different genres — dramas, comedies, fantasy films. Was that a conscious choice?  \n\n\tHoward: I intentionally wanted to prove myself to the creative community, to the studios and ultimately audiences that I could make all kinds of films. As an actor, I’d been very much typecast. My first directing successes were comedies, which made sense because I came out of acting in comedies, and I had command over those rhythms. Once I recognized that I was going to have a directing career, I inched my way in other directions. “Cocoon” was kind of a comedy-drama — it had some serious moments. And “Parenthood” was bittersweet in places. It was “Backdraft” where I made my first full-on adventure movie. And then “Apollo 13” was a massive breakthrough for me, not only because it was a drama, but also because it was the first time that I took on a true story. Up to that point, I’d been terrified it would squelch my creativity, when, in fact, I found that it ignited it. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBefore producer Brian Grazer and director Ron Howard founded Imagine Entertainment, they made 1984’s “Splash.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Buena Vista Pictures/Courtesy\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRon, you’re making “Alone at Dawn,” the story of the effort to get Navy SEAL John Chapman a posthumous Medal of Honor, with Adam Driver and Anne Hathaway. What drew you to the film?  \n\t\n\n\tHoward: It’s new territory for me. It’s a combat movie, but there’s also an investigation component. I’ve never done a procedural story, and it was interesting to explore themes of courage and commitment. \n\n\tBrian, it came out that you voted for Donald Trump. Given that Hollywood is a liberal town, what was the reaction?  \n\n\tGrazer: There was blowback.  \n\n\tDo people not want to work with you?  \n\n\tGrazer: No. I am what I am. I haven’t changed. I don’t know if I should say anything more than that. \n\n\tAI has become a polarizing topic in the entertainment industry. Are you optimistic about the technology or fearful?  \n\n\tGrazer: It’s a great collaborator in building stories. It’s never going to provide a soul into your movie. AI doesn’t have a point of view; it doesn’t feel pain or love or understand what it’s like to recover from injury or humiliation. It has no conception of life-or-death stakes, and you need those to build a great story.  \n\n\tHoward: It’s going to help filmmakers get more of what’s in their mind’s eye onto screens in very efficient ways. It’ll be helpful in terms of visual effects and be its own kind of revolution, just as digital effects were for cinema. The important thing for us as a society is to preserve creative populations’ ability to make a living. That’s going to require thought and care, and the copyright issues are going to have to be legislated. \n\n\tDo you use AI?  \n\n\tGrazer: I use ChatGPT all the time. It’s so fun.  \n\n\tHoward: Questions pop into my mind, and I know the answers AI gives aren’t 100% reliable, but it’s like you’ve got a couple of bright people wandering around with you. \n\n\tRon, does it kill you to think about someone watching one of your films on their phone?  \n\n\tHoward: No, I watch films on my phone. Maybe don’t say that — the ghost of David Lynch will come back to haunt me. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Baywatch” is back.\n\n\tThe syndicated series defined Los Angeles in the 1990s, but filmed its final two seasons in Hawaii thanks to $3 million in state incentives. The “Baywatch” movie filmed in Georgia, which provides a 30% rebate. Now, the show is coming home.\n\n\tThe California Film Commission announced Thursday that it will give $21 million to support the “Baywatch” reboot on Fox, which is expected to air in the 2026-27 season.\n\n\n\t“I’m proud to see the return of ‘Baywatch’ where it belongs — on sunny California shores, creating jobs and fueling the very entertainment economy that sets this state apart,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement.\n\t\n\n\tThe state awarded $313 million in incentives to 17 TV shows in the latest round of allocations on Wednesday, just a month after giving out $342 million to 52 films.\n\n\tThe big winner this time around is Amazon, which will collect $74 million for “Fallout” and “Mr. and Mrs. Smith.” The streamer previously got $25 million for relocating “Fallout” from New York for Season 2, and will see that subsidy increase to $42 million for Season 3.\n\n\t“Mr. and Mrs. Smith” was awarded $22 million to relocate to L.A. for its second season back in March. But thanks to the dramatic expansion of the state’s film incentive in July, the show will now get $32 million — a $10 million windfall.\n\n\t“Baywatch” will get a credit equal to 40% of its qualified expenses — the maximum allowed under the law — because it is considered a “relocating” show, even though it has not filmed in Hawaii since a reunion TV movie in 2002. \n\n\tThe film commission has categorized the reboot as the 12th season of the original series. If the show were considered a “new” series, it would get 35% — or $2.6 million less.\n\t\n\n\tSony will also get $31.6 million to relocate “The Night Agent” from Vancouver. Universal is also getting nearly $28 million to shoot “The Paper” and “Dig” on its own soundstage as part of a separate incentive program geared at encouraging soundstage construction.\n",

She was later taken to a hospital ... and that's when investigators say the plan started to fall apart.\n      \n    \n          Prosecutors say Greene and her friend/accomplice gave different accounts of the alleged events that didn't add up. Then, black zip-ties and duct tape were reportedly found in Greene's Maserati.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Authorities say the unidentified friend's phone showed a Google search for \"zip ties near me\" just days before the alleged attack.\n      \n    \n          Greene was arrested Wednesday and charged with conspiracy to convey false statements and hoaxes and making false statements to federal law enforcement.\n      \n    \n          She was arraigned the same day and released on a $200K unsecured bond.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

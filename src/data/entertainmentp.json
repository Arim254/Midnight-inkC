    "body": "\n\tMalcolm D. Lee is attached to direct and executive produce a pair of projects at NBC and Peacock under his Blackmaled Productions banner, Variety has learned. Universal Television, where Lee and Blackmaled are under a first-look deal will produce both shows. \n\n\tThe NBC project is titled “Need to Know” and has Taye Diggs (“All American,” “The Best Man”) attached to star and executive produce. The logline for the project states, “Inspired by true events, a spy procedural about a battle-scarred CIA veteran who must team up with a cocky young officer as they run the CIA’s most daring operations from a secret base in South Florida.”\n\t\n\n\tAlexander Maggio (“FBI,” “Madam Secretary”) wrote the pilot and will executive produce. Should the project go to series, Terence Paul Winter (“Boston Blue,” “The Equalizer”) would serve as writer and executive producer. Dominique Telson, Jerry O’Shea, and John Sipher of Spycraft Entertainment also executive produce with Michael Scott Allen and Rachel Harner co-executive producing. \n\n\n\tThe Peacock project is titled “Becoming Marlow Fin,” based on the book of the same name Ellen Won Steil. The logline states, “Over the course of an explosive primetime interview, global superstar Marlow Fin’s mysterious life is revealed as she recounts the events leading up to the disappearance of her sister and publicly makes the case for her innocence as the prime suspect in her presumed murder.”\n\n\tDes Moran (“A Different World” sequel at Netflix, “Tiny Beautiful Things”) is the writer and executive producer. Won also executive produces along with Dominque Telson and Michael Scott Allen. \n\t\n\n\t(Pictured, left to right: Malcolm D. Lee, Taye Diggs, Terence Paul Winter, Alexander Maggio, Des Moran)\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Kristen Stewart’s acclaimed feature directorial debut, “The Chronology of Water,” was acquired for domestic distribution by the Forge a few months after its Cannes premiere in May, one question crossed the minds of many people in the industry: What the hell is the Forge?\n\n\t“After COVID started, it gave me an opportunity to think, as a film producer, about what sales entity I would want to work with, to have a vehicle to release films that we were intending to produce,” says founder Mark Mathias Sayre. “We had some early success, and a couple of contemporaries asked if we would handle their sales or distribution. Fast forward a couple years, and now it’s all we’re doing.”\n\t\n\n\tAs a flood of content has crowded the marketplace, so has an avalanche of new boutique distributors looking to release it, often prioritizing what their filmmakers want or targeting specific audiences. In the past year or two, companies like 1-2 Special, Cartuna x Dweck, the Future of Film Is Female, Joint Venture, Muscle Distribution, Suncatcher Prods., Watermelon Pictures, Willa and more have begun placing low-budget indies in theaters. It’s been happening on a larger scale as well: since launching in 2023, AMC Theatres Distribution has turned to domestic distribution experts Variance Films to get the lay of the land. Its operation has had big successes with concert docs like “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé” and other event presentations.\n\n\n\tBut having more options doesn’t necessarily make a producer’s path easier. “The biggest thing you need is patience, and you have to find your niche,” says Mabel Tam, senior VP of film and head programmer at Landmark Theatres. “There isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach anymore.” She cites the Jewish/Catholic interfaith comedy “Bad Shabbos” as one example. “They released it in Florida first, before they even hit New York or L.A., and then targeted where they wanted to go. You have to be nimble and patient and watch your release calendar, making sure you’re not competing with anything too big.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Urchin’\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhat might beat finding a niche audience for your film? A distributor that has a niche audience for its entire slate. Watermelon Pictures, a branch of Chicago-based MPI Media Group, focuses on Palestinian cinema and related subjects. Since it was founded in 2024 by brothers Badie and Hamza Ali with creative director Alana Hadid (sister of models Gigi and Bella Hadid), it’s distributed around a dozen films and launched the Watermelon+ streaming service. Its potential to reach underserved audiences is similar to the way Angel Studios has found success with viewers seeking family-friendly and faith-based content.\n\n\tSuncatcher Prods., which recently handled theatrical distribution for the Armenian documentary “There Was, There Was Not,” with Watermelon handling ancillary, is a label focusing on the theatrical release of films about women, people with disabilities and the environment. Amazon and Focus Features vet Annalisa Shoemaker founded the company in 2023 as a for-hire theatrical distribution outfit. It got off to an auspicious start with Oscar nominee “To Kill a Tiger,” taking the film from its awards-qualifying run to more than 40 arthouse cinemas. Shoemaker recently departed from her doc-heavy lineup, working with AMC Theatres to book the rom-com “Good Bad Things” and setting it up for a Hulu streaming deal. “One of our goals at Suncatcher is building community, working backwards from the audience to learn what they want and how to bring them together,” she says.\n\n\tOn its surface, the Future of Film Is Female’s agenda seems pretty direct: create gender parity in the film industry by supporting the productions, exhibition and promotion of women who are first-time filmmakers. “What I’ve seen, leading out of the festivals, is that there’s not a lot of [gender] parity in what kind of films get picked up afterwards,” says programmer and FOFIF founder Caryn Coleman, who launched her nearly eight-year-old org’s distribution arm a year ago. “One of the reasons I wanted to do this is because there are more of these films than I could possibly handle.” But her model is something that could have far more widespread applications: using a nonprofit org to fund it all. “That’s not to say that we don’t try to recoup the money we put into it, but as a nonprofit, we try and do that via different means.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production/distribution outfit Willa “focuses on socially and culturally important films,” says founder Elizabeth Woodward. Willa’s impressive lineup of films includes Claire Denis’ “The Fence” and Spirit Awards nominee “La Cocina.” “Sundance Institute is really engaged in the future of distribution, so they invited me to be part of their fellowship,” she says. “That’s where I really formalized Willa’s business model, with some great mentors.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Good Bad Things’\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhile most of these new distribs lean towards more serious fare, there are a few notable exceptions. Cartuna x Dweck, a partnership of Hannah Dweck and Ted Schaefer’s Dweck Prods. with James Belfer’s Cartuna animation studio, is launching its operations with “Dead Lover,” a horror-comedy they plan to screen with scratch-and-sniff “Stink-O-Vision” cards. “We’ve been looking at some of the cooler, weirder types of films we’d like to get involved with, and we don’t see the market being very favorable to them,” Belfer says. “And we’d work with certain companies and things didn’t make sense to us. So we [thought], ‘Why don’t we put our energy towards distribution?” Their equal in camp might just be Muscle Distribution, recently founded by film historian Elizabeth Purchell, which focuses on classic queer underground and art films.\n\n\tWhile each of these new companies may not earn a lot, together they can make an impact. “The new smaller distributors are welcomed by movie theaters, particularly independent movie theaters and smaller theater chains,” says comScore head of marketplace trends Paul Dergarabedian. “Many of them fill a void by offering up films that, on their own, may not generate a ton of box office, but collectively can add to the bottom line, while simultaneously providing distribution and marketing to fledgling or overlooked films.”\n\n\tIt’s never been easy for independent filmmakers, but the emergence of so many boutique distribs offers a stark reflection of how expectations have changed. “There are literally dozens of incredible films that premiere at Sundance, Tribeca, SXSW and all of these other regional film festivals,” says Lela Meadow-Conner, a board member at the independent exhibitor group Art House Convergence. “Yet traditional theatrical distributors’ marketing budgets have dwindled, or they’re not seeing the box office returns they had in the past. But [boutique distributors’] windows and terms are often more favorable for theaters. Some of them will even do a 50/50 split.” And several distribs acknowledge that theatrical is often just a loss leader. “They see theatrical as marketing, in hopes of recouping some of that money with streaming.”\n\t\n\n\tOne buzzword you’ll hear a lot in the indie distribution space is “bespoke,” a fancy way of saying that each film’s release is tailored specifically to that feature and its unique audience. Joint Venture, a new company co-founded by Participant vet Chris Lane, promises to “build coalitions with filmmakers, audiences and partners to unlock the potential of each film.” It gives filmmakers a chance to have greater involvement in their film’s rollout, target communities with specific ties to their characters or subject matter, and offer others a chance to partner with them on a marketing campaign or screenings. For its recent release, “If You See Something,” a romantic thriller centering on an Iraqi doctor seeking political asylum in the U.S., the film’s website encourages viewers to join or donate to an org that welcomes refugee families.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘La Cocina’\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn February, former Sideshow exec Jason Hellerstein launched 1-2 Special, assembling a team of indie film vets to release up to 10 theatrical releases a year. While many distribs claim to be filmmaker- friendly, 1-2 Special aims to involve them as little or as much as they’d like, and to be as transparent as possible about the process. The label got off to a solid start on Oct. 10 with actor Harris Dickinson’s feature directorial debut, “Urchin.”\n\n\tThere are also new boutique outfits that claim to be “filmmaker first” operations, where producers get their share of box office before, or at the same time as, the distributors. “That is a premise that a lot of startup distributors have subscribed to, or have branded themselves as,” says entertainment attorney Elsa Ramo of Ramo Law. “And then the devil’s in the details: Is that truly how the deal is structured? Are there hidden costs and fees? Do they have a business plan that’s going to generate any revenue at all? With so much volatility in the marketplace, the best version of a deal provides some sort of advance or minimum guarantee. When you’re just dealing with revenue share, it becomes a much riskier proposition for the producer. Nothing is better than [getting] the most money upfront.”\n\n\tEven though the influx of new players is exciting, Ramo says producers shouldn’t let their guard down. “In terms of evaluating distribution, you want to make sure that it’s not just about the offer on the table,” she says. “Are these companies going to have cash a year from now? Because in these cycles of emerging distributors, the one thing that hasn’t gone away is that you really need to do your due diligence.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Pitt” will not be sanitized for your protection. As Season 1 of the critically acclaimed, Emmy-winning HBO Max medical drama gets a basic cable run via TNT next month, no edits will be made to the intense, sometimes raw streaming version.\n\n\tThat means all of the show’s “graphic medical imagery,” including nudity, will remain intact and be seen on TNT as the show makes its linear premiere on Monday, Dec. 1, at 9 p.m. ET.\n\n\n\tIn a press release, TNT noted that the decision not to edit “The Pitt” for linear TV was in line with the show’s “core mission to accurately depict the realities of an emergency department.” Those “graphic medical imagery” scenes, including the depiction of a birth in Episode 11, “are integral to the show’s portrayal of the raw emotional toll that such work has on those who commit their lives to the medical profession,” the cabler said. \n\t\n\n\tAcknowledging that such imagery is normally edited out from acquired fare on linear commercial TV, TNT said it would “include advisories at the top of each episode and coming out of commercial breaks.” There are no rules preventing TNT from airing the episodes uncut; as a cable network, TNT is not subject to the same content standards that the FCC requires of over-the-air broadcast TV outlets. \n\n\tThe full 15-episode Season 1 of “The Pitt,” which comes from John Wells Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television, will air three back-to-back episodes a week on TNT from Dec. 1 to Dec. 29.\n\n\tChanning Dungey, chairman and CEO of the Warner Bros. Television Group and US Networks, announced at the Warner Bros. Discovery upfront presentation in May that “The Pitt” would get a linear run on TNT this fall. The idea is to expose the show to new viewers who perhaps haven’t caught it yet on streaming, and also use the linear run as a bit of a marketing lead-up to the January premiere of Season 2 on HBO Max. \n\t\n\n\t“All of us at ‘The Pitt’ are very excited that the TNT audience will have the opportunity to see our Emmy award-winning show beginning on December 1st,” exec producer John Wells said in a statement. “We’re also very grateful to TNT for allowing the series to be shown as it was initially shot and aired on HBO Max.”\n\n\tNoah Wyle, Tracey Ifeachor, Patrick Ball, Katherine LaNasa, Supriya Ganesh, Fiona Dourif, Taylor Dearden, Isa Briones, Gerran Howell and Shabana Azeez star in “The Pitt” Season 1. Each episode follows Wyle’s character, Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch, for a full hour during his 15-hour shift as the chief attendant in the hospital emergency room at Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center.\n\n\tR. Scott Gemmill created the series and serves as an executive producer. Wyle is also an executive producer along with Wells and Erin Jontow of John Wells Productions, Simran Baidwan and Michael Hissrich.\n\n\t“The Pitt” Season 2 is currently in production for its January return on HBO Max. Per the streamer, “The Pitt” reached 20 million global viewers per episode. The show also made a splash at this year’s Primetime Emmys Awards, winning five — including including outstanding drama series, as well as first-time Emmy wins for Noah Wyle (drama lead actor), Katherine LaNasa (drama supporting actress) and Shawn Hatosy (drama guest actor). The show also won for outstanding drama series casting. “The Pitt” also won a Humanitas Prize this year for drama teleplay.\n\n\tMeanwhile, the show is also having an impact on real-world medicine and healthcare conversations. According to a recent study by the USC Norman Lear Center, “The Pitt” has shifted the conversation on issues such as organ donation and end-of-life planning.\n\n\tIn Monday’s press release, TNT shared a quote from L. Anthony Cirillo, MD, FACEP, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), regarding the impact the show has had among first responders and medical professionals: “’The Pitt’ gives everyone a rare and authentic view of what it’s like to practice emergency medicine. This show offers a unique glimpse of the humanity of emergency care and what it takes to heal people within a broken system. The nation’s emergency physicians are incredibly proud of the show and grateful for the chance to be seen for who we are, the challenges we face, and the work we do every day. We deeply appreciate the commitment of the cast and crew that makes this show a huge success, especially the ACEP members involved in writing and production, and we are thrilled that ‘The Pitt’ will soon resonate with even more people, bringing new urgency to critical conversations about real health system fixes that emergency physicians and the millions of patients who rely on us need and deserve.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Pitt” reps the latest HBO Max show to get a run on the Turner nets, following shows like HBO’s “True Detective: North Country,” “Hacks” and “Peacemaker.” \n\n\t“Those were really good experiments for us,” Dungey said in May. “We’re learning a little bit about how to platform the shows, how to make them feel more like an event. These have been some very good learnings for us as we go towards The Pitt launch in Q4 this year. Doing things like that, it’s great for us, and it also is helping Max as well. If it drives viewers to Max for the new season, that’s a win/win.”\n\n\tAs for keeping the content intact, basic cable — which once mostly followed broadcast standards and practices, mostly because of advertiser concerns — has loosened its content restrictions in recent years, particularly when it comes to language. And those advertisers that once chaffed at TV-MA content have been more willing to embrace racy fare in order to appeal to younger viewers who aren’t concerned with a few F-bombs or raw images.\n\n\tHere is a look at TNT’s marketing campaign for “The Pitt”:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSydney Sweeney is shrugging off the dismal box office start of “Christy,” a biographical drama in which she portrays the trailblazing boxer Christy Martin. The R-rated film was rejected with $1.3 million, ranking as one of the worst starts ever for a movie that was released in more than 2,000 North American theaters.\n\n\t“We don’t always just make art for numbers, we make it for impact,” Sweeney captioned a lengthy Instagram post. “And Christy has been the most impactful project of my life.”\n\t\n\n\tDirected by David Michôd and co-starring Ben Foster, Merritt Weaver and Katy O’Brian, “Christy” chronicles Martin’s rise to fame in the ring, as well as her coach-turned-husband’s attempted murder of her. In Variety’s review, chief film critic Owen Gleiberman praised Sweeney’s transformative performance and described “Christy” as a “wrenching portrait of abuse, enabling, gaslighting, and just how far domestic violence can go.”\n\n\n\t“This film stands for survival, courage, and hope. Through our campaigns, we’ve helped raise awareness for so many affected by domestic violence. We all signed on to this film with the belief that Christy’s story could save lives,” Sweeney said in her Instagram post. “Thank you to everyone who saw, felt, and believed and will believe in this story for years to come. If Christy gave even one woman the courage to take her first step toward safety, then we will have succeeded.”\n\n\t“Christy” was the first theatrical release from Black Bear Pictures, which also produced the film for $15 million. The indie company has sold rights to the movie in several overseas territories, which will mitigate theatrical losses. “Christy” joins the ignominious group of several recent film festival darlings — Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson’s psychodrama “Die My Love,” “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” and “The Smashing Machine” were others — that failed to connect at the box office.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel and his wife Molly McNearney opened up about the moment they told their children “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” had been suspended.\n\n\tIn September, ABC temporarily pulled Kimmel off the air following comments he made in his monologue regarding the death of Charlie Kirk. The suspension followed threats from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who called Kimmel’s remarks “truly sick,” and said, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.” ABC pulled the show entirely after Nexstar and Sinclair preempted it on their affiliate channels. Kimmel has since maintained that his comments were “grossly mischaracterized.”\n\t\n\n\tOn the “We Can Do Hard Things” podcast, McNearney, who is the co-head writer and executive producer of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” recalled coming home to their kids the day of the suspension. She said when they got home, they had to “put on a mask” for their children Jane and Billy, asking them about school and soccer practice before sitting them down to break the news. “Meanwhile, our phones are [going] buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz the whole time in our pockets, and there’s helicopters over our house,” she said.\n\n\n\tKimmel told the kids, “My show has been suspended,” and, according to McNearney, “Our daughter immediately burst into tears. And she said, ‘I’ll sell my Labubus.'” McNearney said their son Billy asked if “the president had done this,” and both she and Kimmel replied, “Yes.”\n\n\t“Jimmy and I both believed that night that the show was never coming back,” McNearney said. Kimmel then quipped: “So we were lying.”\n\n\tElsewhere on the podcast, McNearney and Kimmel opened up about their “challenging” relationships with Trump-supporting family members as the president’s feud with the late-night host escalated. She said she has “sympathy” for her relatives who are “deliberately being misinformed every day,” but “it hurts me so much because of the personal relationship I now have where my husband is out there fighting this man.”\n\t\n\n\t“To me, them voting for Trump is them not voting for my husband and me and our family,” she added, saying “unfortunately” she has “lost relationships with people in my family because of it.”\n\n\tThe day Kimmel’s show was pulled from ABC, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible.”\n\n\n\tMcNearney said she is in “constant conflict” and is “angry all the time” about politics, “which isn’t healthy at all.” \n\n\t“I personalize everything now. When I see these terrible stories every day, I’m immediately mad at certain aunts, uncles, cousins who put him in power. And it’s really hard,” she said. McNearney said she has tried to convince her family members to not vote for Trump, which has “definitely caused a strain.”\n\n\t“I’ve definitely pulled in closer with the family that I feel more aligned with. And I hate that this has happened,” she said. “Part of me goes, ‘Don’t let politics get in the way.’ But to me, this isn’t politics. It’s truly values. And we’re not aligned anymore.”\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tAcademy Award winner Brendan Fraser has joined the Oscar-qualifying short documentary “Saving Superman” as an executive producer, revealed to Variet",
    "body": "\n\tAcademy Award winner Brendan Fraser has joined the Oscar-qualifying short documentary “Saving Superman” as an executive producer, revealed to Variety exclusively. \n\n\t“Saving Superman” chronicles the remarkable true story of Jonathan, a 57-year-old man with autism spectrum disorder and longtime resident of Glen Ellyn, a small suburb outside Chicago. Known for his larger-than-life spirit and signature Superman persona, Jonathan has been a fixture in the town’s Fourth of July Parade for nearly three decades. When his home was threatened by a new property owner, the community — led by his best friend Julie — banded together to launch a grassroots campaign to save it.\n\t\n\n\tDirected by Adam Oppenheim and Samuel-Ali Mirpoorian, the Critics Choice Documentary Award-winning short was released today by Switchboard Magazine and is now available to stream free of charge on the outlet’s website.\n\n\n\t“Jonathan is the hero to ask for. And he is the one we need,” Fraser said in a statement. “It has been said that not all of them wear capes. But this one does. And with dignity as he stands his ground, a vision of determination in crimson and azure blue. Not only does he save his home from apathy but he rescues us all in the name of truth and justice. Not with brute strength but with the only real super power there is, empathy. That is the clarion call for The American Way. I stand shoulder to shoulder with Jonathan.”\n\n\tFraser’s involvement with the project comes as he is in the Oscar race himself as a best actor contender for his moving turn in Hikari’s acclaimed dramedy “Rental Family.” Distributed by Searchlight Pictures, the film has earned several audience awards on the festival circuit thus far, and has become another celebrated turn for the actor who won his first Oscar for his performance in “The Whale” (2022). \n\t\n\n\tThe documentary has been one of the most celebrated shorts on the festival circuit, screening at more than 60 festivals — including 18 Oscar-qualifying events — and winning over 10 awards, the most of any documentary short in its year. Notable stops include the Chicago International Film Festival, Indy Shorts (where it earned jury honors), Mountainfilm, Cleveland International, and DOC NYC.\n\n\tProduced by Oppenheim, Mirpoorian and Julie Spiller, “Saving Superman” also counts Celia Aniskovich and Duncan Lindsay (for Switchboard Magazine), John Hoffman (“The Barber of Little Rock”), Ryan Mazie, Marjon Javadi, Mike Tudeen, Marcella Tudeen, Stephen Shaya, and Gary Burkart among its executive producers.\n\n\tEarlier this year, Mirpoorian received a Television Academy Honors Award for his feature-length debut “Greener Pastures,” which aired as part of PBS’ Oscar-nominated and Emmy-winning “Independent Lens” series.\n",

    "body": "\n\tActors and multi-hyphenates Wilmer Valderrama and Cara Santana Leto have joined the filmmaking team behind the acclaimed short documentary “Rat Rod” as executive producers. The film, directed by Jared Jakins and Carly Jakins, offers an intimate portrait of a Mexican immigrant mechanic transforming salvaged cars in rural Utah while navigating questions of identity, memory and home.\n\n\tBeginning today, “Rat Rod” is available to stream on the Switchboard Magazine website and YouTube channel. The film, which follows mechanic Jorge Ramirez, recently secured a spot for consideration in the Oscar race after claiming top honors at both the Seattle International and Nashville Film Festivals, qualifying it for consideration at the 98th Academy Awards. It has also earned accolades from the San Francisco International, Palm Springs, Flickers and Indy Shorts film festivals.\n\t\n\n\tValderrama, producing through his WV Entertainment’s WV Alternative arm, said the film resonated deeply with him. “‘Rat Rod’ is more than a documentary, it’s a testament to the strength and creativity of the migrant community,” he said. “Jorge’s journey is one of perseverance, artistry and identity, and I am honored to help share his story with the world.”\n\n\n\tSantana Leto added that her upbringing inspired her connection to the project. “Growing up on the border of Mexico, it was impressed upon me the importance and value of sharing diverse stories to allow us to connect to one another through our shared humanity,” she said. “‘Rat Rod’ is an undeniable expression of the power of storytelling. Jorge’s story captured my heart and it’s been a privilege to champion this film and bring to light the experiences of people who may be traditionally under-recognized in cinema.”\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to directing, Carly and Jared Jakins produced the film alongside H.B. Phillips, Kelyn Ikegami, and Celia Aniskovich and Harlin Lawal for Switchboard Magazine.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe “A Different World” sequel series has officially been greenlit at Netflix, Variety has learned. \n\n\tThe show was first reported to be in development at the streamer in 2024, while a rare Netflix pilot order for the show was announced in March 2025. As with the original show, it will take place at the fictional HBCU Hillman College. \n\n\tMaleah Joi Moon (“Hell’s Kitchen”) will star in the series as Deborah Wayne, the daughter of original series characters Dwayne Wayne (Kadeem Hardison) and Whitney Gilbert (Jasmine Guy). The official logline states the show “follows Deborah as she enters her freshman year at her parents’ HBCU alma mater and finds the shadow of her parents difficult to escape. She sets out to build her own legacy – while having the time of her life – alongside a whole new generation of Hillman’s best and brightest.”\n\t\n\n\tThe cast also includes Alijah Kai (“Everybody Hates Chris”) as Rashida, Chibuikem Uche (“One Of Us Is Lying”) as Kojo, Cornell Young IV (“Doing Life”) as Shaquille, Jordan Aaron Hall (“The Idea of You”) as Amir, and newcomer Kennedi Reece as Hazel.\n\n\tFelicia Pride serves as writer, executive producer, and showrunner on the series. Debbie Allen, Mandy Summers, Tom Werner, Gina Prince-Bythewood and Reggie Rock Bythewood also serve as executive producers, with Allen also set to direct three episodes, including the first.  \n\n\t“It is such an honor to be a part of bringing back this iconic show, one that I grew up on and which had a profound impact on my life” said Pride “I am so proud of the work we’re doing to reimagine ‘A Different World’ for beloved fans and new generations alike.”\n\t\n\n\tWerner produced the original show via The Carsey-Werner Company, while Allen also produced and directed the bulk of the original’s 144 episodes. Both Bythewood and Prince-Bythewood were writers on the original as well. \n\n\t“’A Different World’ changed everything for us,” said the Bythewoods, who have been married since 1998. “It was where we got our start as writers and where we found each other. This show has always been a part of our love story. To return to Hillman now and help reimagine this world for a new generation feels like a continuation of that legacy – one rooted in love, purpose, and possibility.”\n\n\t“A Different World” began as a spinoff of “The Cosby Show” and followed Denise Huxtable (Lisa Bonet) as she attends Hillman. But after Bonet departed the series following its first season, the focus shifted to characters played by Guy, Hardison, Dawnn Lewis, Glynn Turman, Cory Tyler, Lou Myers, Darryl M. Bell, Cree Summer, and Charnele Brown. It aired for six seasons on NBC. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t(Pictured, left to right: Maleah Joi Moon, Alijah Kai, Chibuikem Uche, Cornell Young IV, Jordan Aaron Hall, Kennedi Reece)\n",

    "body": "\n\t“South Park” creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker recently spoke to The New York Times about their decision to turn the latest episodes of their Comedy Central series into full blown Donald Trump takedowns. The show has been criticizing MAGA nonstop in Seasons 27 and 28, which started airing in late July. In various episodes, “South Park” has depicted Donald Trump having sex with Satan and getting him pregnant, a plastic-surgery ravaged Kristi Noem shooting puppies and FCC chairman Brendan Carr haunting the White House as the East Wing gets demolished, among many other MAGA critiques.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s not that we got all political. It’s that politics became pop culture,” Parker told The Times, noting that regular conversations took place about returning “South Park” to its usual hijinks but “there’s no getting away from [MAGA].” \n\n\n\t“It’s like the government is just in your face everywhere you look,” Parker explained. “Whether it’s the actual government or whether it is all the podcasters and the TikToks and the YouTubes and all of that, and it’s just all political and political because it’s more than political. It’s pop culture.”\n\n\tStone said the show has always sought out “new taboos” when deciding what to parody in its episodes, adding: “Trey and I are attracted to that like flies to honey. Oh, that’s where the taboo is? Over there? Ok, then we’re over there.”\n\n\tThe creators always knew their first episode of Season 27 in July would target Donald Trump because “we just had to show our independence somehow,” Parker said. But nearly every episode since has followed suit. The duo are adamant this has always been the spirit of “South Park.”\n\t\n\n\t“We’re just very down-the-middle guys,” Parker said. “Any extremists of any kind we make fun of. We did it for years with the woke thing. That was hilarious to us. And this is hilarious to us.”\n\n\tA spokesperson for the White House has slammed the latest episodes for mocking Trump, saying in a statement after the Season 27 premiere in July that “South Park” has “no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows.”\n\n\t“This show hasn’t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention,” the statement continued. “President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country’s history – and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump’s hot streak.”\n\n\tPerhaps what’s been most shocking about “South Park” this season is that it’s been taking aim at MAGA amid David Ellison’s takeover of Comedy Central’s parent company Paramount. The studio’s new owner has been forging ties with Trump while “South Park” mocks him. Stone told The Times that Ellison and the new Paramount owners remain hands-off when it comes to “South Park” — at least for now.\n\n\t“I know with the Colbert thing and all the Trump stuff, people think certain things, but they’re letting us do whatever we want, to their credit,” Stone said.\n\n\tPlus, both “South Park” creators are well aware that the show will not always have episodes that are anti-MAGA. Wherever the culture goes, “South Park” will go.\n\n\t“You know, next year will be different,” Parker said. “If there’s one thing we know, it is that our show will be a lot longer than [Trump’s administration]. So, we just got to do this for now.”\n\n\t“South Park” continues airing its 28th season through Dec. 10.\n",

As depicted in 2003's Charlize Theron-led biopic \"Monster,\" and the new Netflix documentary \"Aileen: Queen of the Serial Killers\" ... Aileen was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders. She was executed by lethal injection in October 2002 in Florida.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Other items include the county prison robe she was issued shortly after her arrest, the flip-flops she wore while on death watch and on her last walk to the death chamber, and her personal Bible, featuring hundreds of handwritten notes and highlights.\n      \n    \n          The items were previously held by Aileen's best friend, Dawn Botkins, and you can get an intimate look into their relationship rifling through the 40 to 60 handwritten letters Aileen sent Dawn.

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tOn what would’ve been his 80th birthday, the Criterion Collection launched a flash sale on all of David Lynch‘s titles from the home video company. Born on Jan. 20, 1946, Lynch — who passed away in 2025 — influenced the landscape of cinema and television (namely Twin Peaks) with his style of bizarre and surreal storytelling rooted in American sincerity and nostalgia.\n\n\tFrom “Eraserhead” to “Inland Empire,” you can shop Lynch’s films in the Criterion Collection (and Janus Contemporaries) with savings up to 35% off list prices. In fact, prices start at $20.49 (reg. $29.95). Additionally, there are even titles about the director’s life, including “David Lynch: The Art Life” and “Lynch/Oz” on sale.\n\n\n\tWith a career in film spanning nearly 30 years from 1977 to 2006, Lynch has made some of the most important films of the 20th and 21st centuries — such as “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,” “Mulholland Dr.,” “Lost Highway” and others.\n\n\tHowever, act fast and shop now since these deals expire at the end of the day on Friday, Jan. 23. In the meantime, scroll down to shop deals on Lynch films in the Criterion Collection on Amazon: \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCriterion Collection\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Criterion Collection\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Eraserhead’\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tBlu-ray\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCriterion Collection\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Criterion Collection\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Blue Velvet’\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t4K Ultra HD\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCriterion Collection\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Criterion Collection\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me’\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t4K Ultra HD\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCriterion Collection\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Criterion Collection\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Lost Highway’\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t4K Ultra HD\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCriterion Collection\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Criterion Collection\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Mulholland Dr.’\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t4K Ultra HD\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCriterion Collection\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Criterion Collection\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Inland Empire’\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tBlu-ray\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCriterion Collection\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Criterion Collection\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘David Lynch: The Art Life’\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tBlu-ray\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJanus Contemporaries\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanus Contemporaries\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Lynch/Oz’\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tBlu-ray\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tAnd since these Criterion Collection releases are from Amazon, you can get them shipped to your home for free, if you’re an Amazon Prime member.\n\n\tIf you’re not a member, you can sign up for a 30-day free trial to take advantage of all that Amazon Prime has to offer, including access to Prime Video for streaming movies and TV, as well as NFL and NBA games, Prime Gaming, Prime Reading and Amazon Photos; fast free shipping in less than two days with Prime Delivery; in-store discounts at Whole Foods Market; access to exclusive shopping events — such as Prime Day and Black Friday — and much more.

    "body": "\n\tChris Pratt told Variety Tuesday night at the New York premiere of “Mercy” that he doesn’t “feel like someone’s gonna replace me” with AI. He added that the panic surrounding synthetic AI performers like Tilly Norwood is “all bullshit.”\n\n\t“I don’t feel like someone’s gonna replace me that’s AI,” Pratt said. “I heard this Tilly Norwood thing, I think that’s all bullshit. I’ve never seen her in a movie. I don’t know who this bitch is. It’s all fake until it’s something.”\n\t\n\n\n\tPratt went on to say there are wider applications of AI that don’t threaten human jobs, and that the emerging tech can be “an amazing tool in the right hands.” Although he thinks it will “inevitably disrupt the industry,” he had no doubts that “great filmmakers” will continue to make “great films.”\n\n\n\tHe added, “I don’t think you’re going to replace the human soul of a director or a writer or an actor or a singer or any of this stuff that requires human yearning and suffering and vision in art.”\n\n\tTilly Norwood is a synthetic AI performer created by Dutch comedian Eline Van der Velden. After Van der Velden unveiled her creation at the Zurich Film Festival last summer, claiming Tilly would soon sign for representation, there was immediate backlash from the entertainment industry at large. SAG-AFTRA said Tilly and other AI performers like it create “the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.”\n\t\n\n\tIn response, Van der Velden defended Tilly as “not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work – a piece of art.”\n\n\tPratt is hardly the first Hollywood mainstay to give his thoughts on AI in film. In December, Leonardo DiCaprio said AI lacks humanity and therefore could never be “authentically” considered art.\n\n\t“It could be an enhancement tool for a young filmmaker to do something we’ve never seen before,” DiCaprio said. “I think anything that is going to be authentically thought of as art has to come from the human being.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has unveiled an extensive 2026 Korean content slate headlined by Blackpink’s Jisoo, Gong Yoo and Song Hye-kyo, as the streamer celebrates 10 years of operations in Asia Pacific.\n\n\tThe lineup features series, films and unscripted titles organized around five emotional experiences: romance, depth and desire, edge-of-seat thrills, comedy, and genre-defying wonder.\n\n\tJisoo stars in romantic comedy series “Boyfriend on Demand,” playing Seo Mi-rae, an exhausted webtoon producer who subscribes to a virtual dating simulation service. Seo In-guk co-stars as her colleague and rival producer. The series is directed by Kim Jung-sik, known for “Work Later, Drink Now” and “No Gain No Love.”\n\t\n\n\tGong Yoo and Song Hye-kyo reunite for “Tantara,” a period drama set in Korea’s entertainment industry during the 1960s and ’80s. The series chronicles those who risked everything for success and is penned by Noh Hee-gyoung (“Our Blues,” “Dear My Friends”) and directed by Lee Yoon-jung (“Coffee Prince,” “Cheese in the Trap”).\n\n\n\tAcclaimed filmmaker Lee Chang-dong (“Burning”) returns to directing after eight years with “Possible Love” (working title), marking his first Netflix collaboration. The film follows two married couples leading different lives whose worlds collide, starring Jeon Do-yeon, Sul Kyung-gu, Zo In-sung and Cho Yeo-jeong.\n\n\tThe romance category continues with “Can This Love Be Translated?” which premiered Jan. 16 starring Kim Seon-ho and Go Youn-jung, alongside “No Tail to Tell” featuring Kim Hye-yoon and Lomon.\n\t\n\n\tAdditional romantic series include “Our Sticky Love” with Jung Hae-in and Ha Young, “Take Charge of My Heart” starring Kim Young-kwang and Chae Soo-bin, and “Sold Out On You” with Ahn Hyo-seop and Chae Won-bin.\n\n\tReality dating franchise “Single’s Inferno” returns for its fifth season, becoming the first Korean reality show to reach that milestone. “Better Late Than Single” also comes back for Season 2.\n\n\tThe thriller slate includes “The Art of Sarah” starring Shin Hye-sun and Lee Jun-hyuk, directed by Kim Jin-min (“Extracurricular,” “My Name”). “Notes from the Last Row” features Choi Min-sik as a literature professor obsessed with a student prodigy, while “Mousetrap” stars Ryu Jun-yeol and Sul Kyung-gu in a suspense thriller based on Kakao Entertainment’s webtoon “Field Mouse.”\n\n\tSon Ye-jin, Ji Chang-wook and Nana lead “The Scandal,” based on the 2003 film “Untold Scandal,” depicting forbidden love in the Joseon dynasty. “The East Palace” features Nam Joo-hyuk, Roh Yoon-seo and Cho Seung-woo in a supernatural thriller about palace mysteries.\n\n\tAction returns with “Bloodhounds” Season 2, reuniting Woo Do-hwan and Lee Sang-yi with new cast member Jung Ji-hoon. Han Jun-hee, creator of “D.P.” and “Weak Hero,” helms “Road” (working title), a cross-border murder thriller starring Son Suk-ku and Eita Nagayama.\n\n\tThe comedy lineup features “Husbands in Action,” an action-comedy where a woman’s ex-husband and current husband team up to rescue her, starring Jin Sun-kyu and Gong Myoung. “Mission: Cross 2” brings back Hwang Jung-min and Yum Jung-ah, while “Undercover Miss Hong” stars Park Shin-hye in a 1990s-set office comedy.\n\n\tUnscripted offerings include “Culinary Class Wars” Season 3, returning with a team-based format after the show topped Netflix’s Global Top 10 Non-English rankings. “The Devil’s Plan” comes back for Season 3, while “Agents of Mystery” returns for Season 2 with new team member Gabee joining Lee Yong-jin, John Park, Lee Hyeri, Kim Do-hoon and Karina.\n\n\tProducer Nah Yung-suk delivers two new reality series: “Ready or Not: Texas,” following Lee Seo-jin on a spontaneous U.S. journey, and “Take a Hike!,” tracking non-experienced hikers through Korea’s snowy mountains. Yu Jae-seok leads “Jae-seok’s B&B Rules!” alongside Lee Kwang-soo, Byeon Woo-seok and Ji Ye-eun, while “Kian’s Bizarre B&B” returns for Season 2.\n\t\n\n\tGenre-bending titles include “The Wonderfools,” a 1999-set comedy action-adventure starring Park Eun-bin and Cha Eun-woo about townspeople who gain superpowers. “If Wishes Could Kill” marks Netflix’s first Korean young-adult horror series, while “Dead-End Job” is a mystery-horror fantasy from Kim Da-min and executive producer Han Jun-hee, starring Lee Jae-wook, Ko Min-si, Kim Min-ha and Lee Hee-jun.\n\n\t“Teach You a Lesson” stars Kim Moo-yul and Lee Sung-min in a series about a fictional government task force restoring teachers’ authority. “We Are All Trying Here” features Koo Kyo-hwan, Go Youn-jung and Oh Jung-se.\n\n\tFilm releases include “Pavane,” director Lee Jong-pil’s latest work starring Ko A-sung, Byun Yo-han and Moon Sang-min.\n\n\tDon Kang, VP of content for Korea at Netflix, said: “Content made in Korean, a language spoken by only 50 million of the world’s 8 billion people, has become the most viewed content in the world only after English content. Over the past five years, more than 210 Korean titles have been ranked in the global top 10.”\n\n\tThe slate announcement coincides with Netflix’s 10th anniversary operating in Asia Pacific. Minyoung Kim, VP of content for APAC (excluding India), highlighted the streamer’s regional investments over the decade, from anime expansion in Japan to breakthrough series across Southeast Asia and Australia.\n\n\t“Each of these slates reflects what Netflix stands for in this region: our commitment to celebrating and partnering with Asia Pacific’s vibrant creative community and its incredible storytelling voices,” Kim said. “And as each country continues to expand their variety of stories and take bigger, bolder creative risks, APAC will continue to grow its place on the global entertainment stage.”\n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRose Byrne\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Actress Commentary (Updated Jan. 20, 2026): Best actress is chaos, and what worries me is that many don’t expect it to be. \n\n\tJessie Buckley (“Hamnet”) is safest of the group. \n\n\tEmma Stone is riding her “Cate Blanchett era” credibility wave. I’m wondering if newcomer Chase Infiniti will be able to crash the party ahead of bigger, more well-known names. \n\n\tAdd Rose Byrne, Renate Reinsve, Kate Hudson, and possibly Amanda Seyfried to the mix, and we’ve got a potential meltdown on our hands.\n\n\n\tThe Actor Award nominations displayed that split, citing Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”), Rose Byrne (“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”), Kate Hudson (“Song Sung Blue”), Chase Infiniti (“One Battle After Another”) and Emma Stone (“Bugonia”).\n\n\tBAFTA’s longlist widened the field, naming Buckley (“Hamnet”), Byrne (“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”), Cynthia Erivo (“Wicked: For Good”), Hudson (“Song Sung Blue”), Infiniti (“One Battle After Another”), Jennifer Lawrence (“Die My Love”), Renate Reinsve (“Sentimental Value”), Andrea Riseborough (“Dragonfly”), Stone (“Bugonia”) and Tessa Thompson (“Hedda”).\n\n\tAt the Critics Choice Awards, Buckley emerged with the best actress win, prevailing over fellow nominees Byrne, Infiniti, Reinsve, Amanda Seyfried and Stone — a result that solidified her momentum.\n\n\tThe Golden Globes, which announce winners on Sunday, further reflect the fluidity. In lead actress (drama), nominees include Buckley, Lawrence, Reinsve, Julia Roberts (“After the Hunt”), Thompson and Eva Victor (“Sorry, Baby”). In lead actress (comedy), the lineup features Byrne, Erivo, Hudson, Infiniti, Seyfried and Stone.\n\n\tOfficial nominations for the 98th Academy Awards will be revealed Thursday, Jan. 22. The 98th Academy Awards will take place Sunday, March 15, at the Dolby Theatre and will be televised live on ABC in more than 200 territories worldwide.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©MGM/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Sony Pictures Classics\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Performers (Best Actress)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: \"Familiar Touch\" (Courtesy of Armchair Poetics)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tVeteran entertainment journalist Zuri Hall is leaving the field.\n\n\tThe playing field, that is.\n\n\tHall has launched “Zuri Hall’s Not About Sports,” a YouTube talk show centered around sports stars and personalities. But instead of focusing on the games, Hall is interviewing her guests about what goes on off the field. “The human interest angle is what’s exciting me the most about it,” she says. “We’re casting a wide net with who our guests could be and seeing what viewers resonate with most. We’ve got people like Loreal Sarkisian, the wife of the head coach of the Texas Longhorns, coming on pretty soon.”\n\t\n\n\t“We’re talking about marriage and motherhood,” Hall added. “She’s opening up like she never has before, about that journey, about giving birth three months early, about her high-risk pregnancy, about what it’s like to support a powerhouse coach at the highest level, and the stresses that come with that, while maintaining her own identity.”\n\n\n\tThe lineup for “Not About Sports” also includes two-time Super Bowl champion Malcolm Jenkins of Philadelphia Eagles fame and Akbar Gbajabiamila, an 8-year NFL veteran turned Emmy-nominated TV host and commentator.\n\n\tHall is best known for her work on celebrity magazine shows like “E! News” and “Access Hollywood.” She is currently the lead host of the “Live From E!” red carpet specials as well as co-host of NBC’s primetime competition series, “American Ninja Warrior.” She is producing “Not About Sports” under her Good News First Studios production company.\n\n\tWho are some of your dream guests?\n\t\n\n\tIt’s hard to pick, but Michael Jordan, because he is notoriously private and he is the GOAT, and because he doesn’t do interviews very often, let alone ones in the style that I’m doing. I would love for him to come on and tell his story in a different way, particularly because I won’t be talking anything basketball-related. I would love to be able to give fans a different side of Michael Jordan. Also, Tom Brady, because I think he’s in a really interesting point of his life right now. I got a lot of questions. I got a lot of questions about what life looks like for him now, what he hopes life will look like for him in the near future, and also maybe more context around some of the decisions that he’s made. I also have to get Jordan Chiles. She’s just so fun, so bubbly.\n\n\tYou’re focusing on guests from the world of sports, but are you also thinking of trying for people like Bradley Cooper, who could talk about his beloved Philadelphia Eagles?\n\n\tI love that you brought that up. I think about that. I don’t want to get too ahead of myself, but Hollywood is definitely my wheelhouse. I’ve been talking to the stars for the better part of 12 years. I’m trusted in this space. My rapport with them is great. I love talking to the stars. I’d love to get Bradley Cooper talking about sports, but this is a show not about sports. We’d have to figure that out.\n\n\tWe can’t talk about sports without talking about hockey and “Heated Rivalry.”\n\n\tThe show is so sexy and so fun, and we’re all loving it right now. It’s the biggest sports romance series that’s out right now. If I could get Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams to lock in on an episode, hands down, we’re making it happen. We’ll have to workshop how exactly it fits. Maybe we’ll bring them on with an actual hockey player.\n\n\tWhat was the first red carpet that you covered?\n\n\tI remember the first one that I was nervous about, like I was nauseous, was Oprah. I’d been in the game a little bit, but I was still super green, and my producers wanted me to give her a loaf of bread [after Winfrey said she was eating bread every day, even while on Weight Watchers]. I was nervous that Oprah was going to be like, “Never again with you.” But in those moments, you see why Oprah is who she is. She has this unique ability to make everyone feel like they’re exactly who she wants to be talking to at that very moment.\n\t\n\n\tWho was your most challenging interview?\n\n\tThe most challenging ones were earlier on in my career when I was still trying to strengthen the muscle of how to navigate some of those trickier questions. I will say it was kind of challenging interviewing Leonardo DiCaprio at the premiere of “The Revenant.” There were those ridiculous rumors — saying it out loud just feels so ridiculous – but there was a scene with him and a bear. [A bizarre claim that a bear sexually assaulted DiCaprio’s character had gone viral at the time]. That was a nice little moment of earning my stripes because I also had food poisoning that day. I had been throwing up literally all morning and all night before. My boss was going to take me off the assignment, and I was like, “Hell no, it’s DiCaprio.” I asked the question, and I got the bite, and the headline got picked up globally. So thank you, Leonardo DiCaprio – it’s been a pleasure interviewing you all these years. [For the record, Variety’s Marc Malkin was with E! Online at the time and wrote the story about Hall’s DiCaprio interview.]\n\n\tThis Q&A was edited for length and clarity.\n\n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBLUE MOON, from left: Andrew Scott as Richard Rodgers, Margaret Qualley, 2025. ph: Sabrina Lantos / © Sony Pictures Classics / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Sony Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Supporting Actor Commentary (Updated Jan. 20, 2026): This looks like a tight five (unless it isn’t).\n\n\tBenicio Del Toro, Sean Penn, Jacob Elordi, Paul Mescal and Stellan Skarsgård seem to be the immovable occupiers. However, this category (and the Oscars) is never that simple. \n\n\tAndrew Scott (“Blue Moon”) has a shot, and if “Sinners” overperforms, expect Miles Caton and/or even Delroy Lindo to swoop in. Think Judd Hirsch-style switch-aroo/sneak attack. This is a category where one scene can change everything.\n\n\n\tThe Actor Awards (formerly SAG Awards) narrowed the field to five, naming surprise inclusion Miles Caton (“Sinners”), Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn (both for “One Battle After Another”), Jacob Elordi (“Frankenstein”) and Paul Mescal (“Hamnet”). That group shows where the Actors Branch might currently lie, despite the Stellan Skarsgård snub.\n\n\tBAFTA’s longlist shows the internationally-leaning strong contenders citing Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn for “One Battle After Another,” alongside Jacob Elordi (“Frankenstein”), Delroy Lindo (“Sinners”), Paul Mescal (“Hamnet”), Peter Mullan (“I Swear”), Adam Sandler (“Jay Kelly”), Andrew Scott (“Blue Moon”), Alexander Skarsgård (“Pillion”) and Stellan Skarsgård (“Sentimental Value”). \n\n\tAt the Critics Choice Awards, Elordi scored the win for his transformative turn as the Creature in “Frankenstein,” prevailing over Del Toro, Mescal, Penn, Adam Sandler and Stellan Skarsgård. The victory positions Elordi as a serious threat, particularly as his performance continues to resonate across multiple voting bodies.\n\n\tThe Golden Globes, which announce winners on Sunday, could further complicate the matter, depending on who wins. Nominees include Del Toro (“One Battle After Another”), Elordi (“Frankenstein”), Mescal (“Hamnet”), Penn (“One Battle After Another”), Sandler (“Jay Kelly”) and Stellan Skarsgård (“Sentimental Value”). With no single performance sweeping the precursors, the race remains fluid (although Del Toro leads overall). This will likely hinge on how Academy voters respond to the balance between transformation, screen time and the gravitational pull of best picture strength.\n\n\tNominations voting will begin Monday, Jan. 12 and conclude Friday, Jan. 16. Official nominations for the 98th Academy Awards will be revealed Thursday, Jan. 22. The 98th Academy Awards will take place Sunday, March 15, at the Dolby Theatre and will be televised live on ABC in more than 200 territories worldwide.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett C\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Sony Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Actors\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: A24\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tHudson Williams and Connor Storrie‘s meteoric rise to fame shows no signs of slowing down. Since “Heated Rivalry” premiered, the co-stars have gone from relative unknowns to Golden Globes presenters and Milan Fashion Week attendees, experiencing a level of celebrity that few actors encounter in their entire careers — let alone in a matter of weeks.\n\n\tBefore the Golden Globes, Williams sat down with Evan Ross Katz for part one of a revealing interview on the “Shut Up Evan” podcast (Storrie appeared on the podcast earlier this month). The conversation, which will conclude Jan. 27, offered a glimpse into the whirlwind experience of sudden stardom.\n\t\n\n\tWhen asked about the overwhelming public reaction to his newfound fame, Williams admitted the experience has been disorienting. “I was just talking with one of my agents yesterday, and she said Connor and I have had to learn what a lot of actors get in five years, in like 30 days,” he explained. The rapid ascent has meant navigating complex career decisions: choosing between prestigious projects, learning to manage an overflowing inbox of scripts and determining which opportunities to pursue — all while maintaining a grueling press schedule.\n\n\n\tDescribing the challenge of sifting through opportunities, Williams said, “Do I read 10 pages? Do I just read the log line? What do we say no to before really giving it the full time of day? Because I simply do not have the time if I just sat and read everything to finish all these scripts in time to give an answer to these people.”\n\n\tThe actor also opened up about the darker side of fame, particularly the loss of privacy and constant scrutiny. Reflecting on unsolicited paparazzi photos, Williams said, “That person didn’t necessarily want that photo taken. It is maybe not nefarious, but it’s not sweet and it’s not fully welcomed. It doesn’t make us feel safe or really like we can disarm.” He described experiencing social anxiety for the first time since ninth grade while simply trying to buy lighter fluid at his Vancouver SkyTrain station, admitting he found himself “planning my exit” to avoid crowds while dressed casually.\n\t\n\n\tComparing his experience to that of BTS, Williams noted how he couldn’t fully empathize with their situation until experiencing it himself. “There’s an element of that’s not another human, that’s a celebrity,” he reflected, discussing how the distinction has altered his daily life. “We feel very always on defense.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell are teaming up once again for a horror comedy film that will pit the pair against an iconic monster. \n\n\tThompson and Mitchell will star in and produce the film “Kenan & Kel Meet Frankenstein.” The announcement was made during the Amazon sports talk show “Good Sports,” which Thompson typically co-hosts with Kevin Hart, though Mitchell was filling in as guest host. The full clip can be seen below.\n\n\n\tThe film will begin production this summer. Per the official logline, the story follows “two delivery drivers whose routine drop-off takes a terrifying turn when they arrive at a creepy, out-of-place castle and accidentally awaken Frankenstein’s monster — turning an ordinary night into a fight for survival.” \n\t\n\n\tHowever, this will not be Thompson and Mitchell’s first horror comedy together. They also starred in the Nickelodeon made-for-TV movie “Two Heads Are Better Than None,” which aired as a finale movie for their beloved sitcom, “Kenan & Kel.” \n\n\t“Kel and I have always loved finding new ways to work together, and this project felt like the perfect mix of nostalgia, comedy, and something completely unexpected,” said Thompson. “We’re excited to bring a fresh take on a classic monster story and have some fun doing it.”\n\n\t“Coming back together always feels natural, and this lets us tap into everything people love about our dynamic while trying something totally new,” Mitchell added. “It’s funny, it’s scary, and it’s a great ride.”\n\n\tThis marks the comedy duo’s first announced joint project since they reunited for “Good Burger 2” in 2023. At that time, they teased that they were planning to keep collaborating moving forward. Thompson and Mitchell first met when they were both cast members on the Nickelodeon sketch comedy series “All That,” from which “Good Burger” originated. Along with the success of the first film, the duo worked together for four seasons on “Kenan & Kel.” \n\t\n\n\tJonah Feingold (“At Midnight,” “31 Candles”) will write the screenplay for the new film. Thompson and John Ryan Jr.’s Artists for Artists will co-produce with Range Media Partners. Ryan Jr.,, Brian Kavanaugh-Jones, and Carter Swan will produce alongside Thompson and Mitchell, with Will Hariton, Azim Spicer, and Monica Weber executive producing.  \n\n\t“First it was Abbott and Costello, then Pryor and Wilder. Kenan and Kel,” said Ryan Jr. “Think ‘Shaun of the Dead’ meets ‘Scooby-Doo.’”\n\n\tRange Media will handle sales, led by Brian Kavanaugh-Jones and Pete Micelli. Thompson and Ryan Jr. are repped by Range Media Partners. Thompson is repped by Innovative Artists Entertainment, Untitled Entertainment, and attorney Mark Temple. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Swift called “It Ends with Us” director Justin Baldoni a “bitch” in a 2024 text exchange with Blake Lively, according to court documents obtained by Variety.\n\n\tWhile discussing the pending New York Times bombshell exposé about Baldoni and Lively’s feud, Swift wrote to Lively, “I think this bitch knows something is coming because he’s gotten out his tiny violin.”\n\n\n\tA year prior, Lively referred to Baldoni as the “doofus director of my movie” in a message to Swift, adding that he is a “clown” who “thinks he’s a writer now.”\n\t\n\n\tTuesday brought a flood of court documents containing allegations against Baldoni of inappropriate on-set behavior from Lively and her “It Ends with Us” co-stars. As exhibited by the texts between Lively and Swift, the documents spelled out deep creative rifts between Lively and Baldoni while developing “It Ends with Us.” Lively created her own cut of the film as a result, and in a court declaration, she said that Baldoni’s version “marginalized the female characters” and “glorified the abuser.”\n\n\tLively also refused to appear alongside Baldoni and producer Jamey Heath while promoting the film, accusing them of vilifying her as punishment for her complaints.\n\n\t“They painted themselves as the victims and me as a bully,” she stated. “I was not willing to endorse Baldoni or Heath personally by appearing alongside or promoting the Film with them.”\n\n\tLively sued Baldoni, his publicist and the “It Ends with Us” producers for harassment and retaliation. The case will go to trial on May 18. Baldoni’s team filed a motion to dismiss the case, claiming that Lively’s complaints are “minor grievances.” A hearing on that motion will take place on Thursday.\n",

Prosecutors claim Busfield touched them inappropriately.\n      \n\n          Busfield's lawyer, Amber Fayerberg, went line by line, addressing each accusation in the criminal complaint.

Fayerberg addressed what the prosecutor actually put in the criminal complaint ... that an actress on set said the mother of the boys told her if her kids were fired, she vowed revenge against Busfield. Both children were not brought back for the final season.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    KRQE\n          \n    \n          Busfield's defense team pointed out the father of the two boys -- identified in the state's motion for pretrial detention as Ronald Rodis -- is a disbarred attorney … he was convicted of federal conspiracy and wire fraud, pleading guilty in 2016.\n      \n    \n          Busfield's wife, Melissa Gilbert, who was in attendance in court Tuesday, had tears streaming down her face as she heard the ruling.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Busfield was released without bail.

Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio holding a U.S. flag on a land marked Greenland.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to the White House about Vistisen's comments -- spokesperson Anna Kelly tells us ... “President Trump was not elected to preserve the status quo – he is a visionary leader who is always generating creative ideas to bolster U.S. national security. Many of this President’s predecessors recognized the strategic logic of acquiring Greenland, but only President Trump has had the courage to pursue this seriously.\"\n      \n    \n          Kelly added, \"As the President said, NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the United States, and Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States from modern threats in the Arctic region.”\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Donald Trump\n              \n                          \n                President Trump\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Fights\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

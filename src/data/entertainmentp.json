    "body": "\n\t“Mortal Kombat II” hasn’t yet made it to theaters, but fans can expect that “Mortal Kombat III” is also in the works, it was announced at New York Comic Con on Saturday.\n\n\tJoined on stage by “Mortal Kombat” cast and crew Adeline Rudolph, Karl Urban, Martyn Ford, Simon McQuoid and Tati Gabrielle, Jeremy Slater announced the third installment and his return to the martial arts fantasy film as its screenwriter.\n\n\n\t“Our friends at New Line and Warner Bros. are so happy and excited with this movie,” Slater said. “They are so convinced that there is a giant fanbase waiting for it that they already hired me to start writing the next installment of ‘Mortal Kombat.’”\n\t\n\n\tThe announcement comes months in advance of the sequel’s release, which is set for May 15. No additional details about the plot of the third film have been shared.\n\n\tBased on the popular video game series, the “Mortal Kombat” films center on a series of tournaments between champions of the Earthrealm and the chaotic Outworld. The tournaments pit heroes such as Cole Young, Sonya Blade, Kano, Jax, Liu Kang and Kung Lao to fight against villains like Mileena, Nitara, Reiko, Kabal, Reptile, Goro and the sorcerer Shang Tsung.\n\n\tThe sequel, which expands on the first film’s tournaments, will feature many returning characters like Lewis Tan as Cole Young, Hiroyuki Sanada as Scorpion, Jessica McNamee as Sonya Blade, Mehcad Brooks as Jax, Ludi Lin as Liu Kang, Josh Lawson as Kano, Tadanobu Asano as Raiden, Chin Han as Shang Tsung, Joe Taslim as Bi-Han and Max Huang as Kung Lao.\n\t\n\n\tNew cast members for the sequel are Urban as Johnny Cage, Rudolph as Kitana, Gabrielle as Jade, Damon Herriman as Quan Chi, Ford as Shao Kahn, Desmond Chiam as Jerrod, Ana Thu Nguyen as Sindel and CJ Bloomfield as Baraka. \n\n\tMcQuoid’s 2021 film adaptation of “Mortal Kombat” was a major success, given that it premiered in theaters during the COVID-19 pandemic with a simultaneous release on HBO Max. It opened at number one at the box office and grossed $84 million worldwide against a $55 million budget. It also became HBO Max’s most successful film launch at the time.\n\n\t“Mortal Kombat” was produced by James Wan, Todd Garner, McQuoid and E. Bennett Walsh. The screenplay was penned by Greg Russo and Dave Callaham, from a story by Russo and Oren Uziel. Richard Brener, Dave Neustadter, Victoria Palmeri, Michael Clear, Jeremy Stein and Larry Kasanoff served as executive producers for New Line Cinema.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn a brisk February evening in 2006, around a hundred people gathered in the venerable Koreatown watering hole HMS Bounty to pay their last respects to Los Angeles’ historic Ambassador Hotel. Despite the best efforts of the Los Angeles Conservancy, the Ambassador had been torn down — and among the speakers decrying the fate of the legendary institution that evening was Diane Keaton.\n\n\tKeaton, who died Saturday at 79, is of course known the world over for her on-screen credits, from “Annie Hall” to “The Godfather,” “Father of the Bride” and so much more. But in Los Angeles, she was also known for her passionate work in trying to preserve the city’s history. Keaton spent nearly two decades on the board of the L.A. Conservancy, and lent her voice to the org in countless campaigns to save some of the city’s historic and culturally significant homes and buildings.\n\t\n\n\t“The more I got to know her, the more I understood where that passion came from,” said former L.A. Conservancy president Linda Dishman, who retired after 31 years with the org in 2023. “A lot of that came from her family and growing up in Los Angeles. Really having a connection to the stories and places that make L.A. the city that it is. She had a very genuine passion for historic preservation, not only for the buildings or the cultural landscapes, but for what they mean to people and what they would mean in the future. She definitely got the relationship with how we’re doing this for future generations.”\n\n\n\tKeaton first became involved through her interest in historic homes — one of which, built by famed architect Lloyd Wright, she called her own. Her association with the group started when she was curious about the Spanish house owned by one of the Conservancy board members — but soon she got deeply involved with the org, speaking at one of its benefits and then joining its board.\n\t\n\n\t“She was just charming, and it was great being with her, because we shared a passion for historic places,” Dishman said. “Houses were her first interest, and she bought historic houses and restored them, like the Lloyd Wright. But she very much cared about the whole architectural landscaoem and so the fight that she probably was most engaged with, because it took so long, was the Ambassador Hotel.”\n\n\tDesigned by architect Myron Hunt, the Ambassador Hotel opened in 1921 — back when that portion of mid-Wilshire was the outskirts of town — and soon became the glamorous playground of the rich and famous. Later, architect Paul Williams added his own touch, including a famous coffee shop, and then the Cocoanut Grove nightclub really put it on the map. The hotel saw every president visit from Hoover to Nixon — but then was the scene of Robert F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1968. The hotel declined from there, and finally shut down in 1989. After that, it became a regular location for film and TV shoots; the LA Unified School District bought the site in 2001, and after a lengthy fight with the Conservancy, which hoped to see the existing structure be adapted into the school, LAUSD was allowed to tear it down in 2005. (The Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools now sit on the property.)\n\n\t“The Ambassador told so many stories about the history of Hollywood in Los Angeles that she she just was extremely passionate about,” Dishman said. “Not only about its history, but about what it could become — because that was a large part of the Conservancy’s work. Trying to show the school district that the building could become a really great learning facility. She really thought this would be a great solution.”\n\n\tAt the 2006 wake, Keaton expressed her disappointment (watch it here): “I wanted to join in with everyone from the Conservancy and express my heartfelt regret that our effort to save the Ambassador Hotel was lost on a confused public who could do nothing more than shrug their shoulders in apathy,” she said. “Looking at the shadow of our once glorious Ambassador Hotel, like losing a lover, I felt that familiar pounding heartbeat racing through my body, and I felt the loneliness of her last stand.  I heard an echo, an echo, and maybe it was the echo of the ambassador calling me. It was almost as if she was saying to me, she was saying, ‘goodbye, Diane, Keep me in your heart, and next time, try harder.'”\n\t\n\n\tAt the Conservancy, Keaton did continue to work hard: Dishman noted that the star was forever allowing the org to use her name to get its foot in the door. “This is LA and sometimes it can be hard to get a meeting with an elected official, but I say I’m calling instead of a meeting, ‘Diane Keaton would like to meet with your boss’ or whatever, and people would always say yes. Even if they didn’t agree with us. Everybody wanted to meet with Diane, and even at the end of the meeting, they might not have changed their position. I think she opened the door, and it might not have saved the Ambassador, but hopefully it changed how they view preservation on another issue. She was very open with me about ‘use my name. If you want a meeting, you call and get it, and I’ll be there.’ She was willing to go the extra mile and not just do the easy stuff.\n\n\t“She had a way of speaking to people about preservation,” Dishman added. “She wasn’t pompous. She just was very direct, and had so much passion that everybody wanted to come along with her.”\n\n\tAmong other projects, Keaton also celebrated the preservation and restoration of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Ennis House, which she loved had some similarities to her Lloyd Wright house. \n\n\t‘She always came to our benefits,” Dishman said. “She loved success stories, like this building was threatened and it gets saved. She loved the Preservation Awards. She also got involved with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. She was on their board for three years. Just seeing, like at an airport in New Orleans, how people responded to her, was really a testament to who she was and how people loved her.”\n\n\tA few years after the Ambassador wake, a fired-up Keaton wrote more about it — and the lessons she learned from that disappointment — in a Los Angeles Times editorial: “We’ve treated old buildings like we once treated plastic shopping bags — we haven’t reused them, and when we’ve finished with them, we’ve tossed them out. This has to stop. Preservation must stand alongside conservation as an equal force in the sustainability game. More older and historic buildings have to be protected from demolition, not only because it affects our pocketbooks but more important because it threatens our environment. Let’s face it, our free ride at the expense of the planet is over… When we tear down a building, we are wiping out lessons for the future. If we think of it that way, we will begin to understand the emotional impact of wasting the energy and resources used to build it in the first place.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Can you believe it? We’re in Los Angeles!” exulted Chappell Roan, about halfway through the first of two appearances at Brookside at the Rose Bowl. It was understood, what she was saying. L.A. was starting to get a complex, when it came to Roan not having done a proper headlining gig in her adopted hometown since before her ascent began. Was she no longer having crazy visions here? Was Santa Monica no longer too good to her? Had she found a better place to dance than West Hollywood? Probably nobody really took it that personally, but all the victory laps she’s been taking over the last two years felt incomplete — like a lap-ette — without a proper major SoCal show to celebrate her ascendance into the pop firmament. \n\t\n\n\tNow she had two, Friday and Saturday night at Pasadena’s Rose Bowl-adjacent Brookside (or, as some of us know it, “the golf course”). “The last show I played here was the Wiltern, which I think is a 2500-cap,” she said, referring to the pre-queen days of November 2023. “So it’s really crazy that we’re playing two nights. There’s like 40,000 people here tonight.” (At last, someone in the know tries to solve the mystery of how many bodies are allowed into Pasadena’s frequently used festival grounds, wholly accurate or not.) When it comes down to it, Roan could have easily performed next door, at the Rose Bowl itself, instead, and sold it out … which is crazy to think about for someone still touring behind a debut album. But whether that prospect was ever proffered or not, it felt right that Roan is choosing to close out this cycle doing outdoor shows in the three areas that ostensibly mean the most to her — New York, Kansas City (in her real home state) and now L.A. — with all-day doings that make them feel more like the Chappell Roan Festival than a traditional gig. Because some of her fans may have come to feel that Roan is as much a lifestyle as she is a musician, or as much an almost definable aesthetic as mere diva.\n\t\n\n\tFriday’s opening show was a master class in pop showwoman-ship, with just about the only possible complaint being that she did not talk to the audience nearly enough in the first two-thirds. Then she made up for that, giving a heartfelt royal speech from a (yes) throne, constantly apologizing for rambling as she assured L.A. that there was nothing personal keeping her away all this while. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChappell Roan performs on stage at Chappell Roan’s “Visions of Damsels & Other Dangerous Things” U.S. Pop-Up Tour held at Brookside at the Rose Bowl on October 10, 2025 in Pasadena, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristopher Polk/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“L.A.’s my favorite city in the world, to be honest,” she said. “I’ve been living here nine years. I’m originally from Missouri and I had a really, really tough time the first five years. and I know there’s a lot of transplants out there,… I just appreciate the city I lived in, Altadena, which is close, and seeing the fires — I’m not gonna be eloquent about this — I loved L.A. more than ever than. When I saw how the community came together in Altadena to help, same with the Palisades, I just realized that I’m so lucky to be able to live here and to play here, and the city has taken care of me, and it’s my duty to take care of it back.\n\n\t“Oh,” she added, as if suddenly remembering a vital item on her to-do list as she was checking out: “Fuck ICE.” She repeated the phrase, and then the crowd began chanting it, but she moved on rather than encourage it.\n\n\t“I’m at a loss for words because I’m just so fucking nervous that this crowd is so big ” — she said it was her biggest headline show ever (the four shows she just did in New York were at Queens’ 15,000-capacity Forest Hills Stadium) — “and I feel always self-conscious at L.A. shows because, I don’t know, I just feel like there’s a weird professionalism out here, and I don’t wanna feel that. I want you to not feel that. I know there’s a lot of people in the music and film industry here, and I don’t want you to think about that. Don’t fucking talk about it! Don’t talk about work here!” The audience laughed, but she was serious, issuing a royal decree, and for a moment you could see a flash of the earnest righteousness that caused some of her Instagram Stories to go viral.\n\n\t“I just want you to feel like you did when you were a kid, when you were 13 and free,” she concluded. “And I’m so grateful that I get to do that with my job and feel free to wear this on stage. And I needed this to just feel like myself. And I know if you move here how it can feel so… I’m just gonna shut up. We’re gonna do ‘Coffee.’ I’m done. There’s nothing else to say. I love you. I love the queer community.”\n\t\n\n\tLinear? No. An artist having a deeply real moment — or three minutes’ worth of moments — in a show otherwise characterized by an hour and a half of abject professionalism and fail-safe show-biz prowess? Yes. That time-out was just what was needed to establish that her show isn’t too masterfully polished. She’s a mere 27, and it’s nice to have an element that feels a little rough and friendly around the edges, even as she already seems a lot more years into her queendom than she is. We want to feel her evolution, even if, as a show like this makes abundantly clear, she was born ready.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChappell Roan performs on stage at Chappell Roan’s “Visions of Damsels & Other Dangerous Things” U.S. Pop-Up Tour held at Brookside at the Rose Bowl on October 10, 2025 in Pasadena, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristopher Polk/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhat is the Chappell aesthetic? There’s drag, and then there’s the drag-on-drag of girls playing boys playing girls playing… well, however that flow chat pans out. (Trixie Mattel was her first opener, while the sun was still out.) And then there’s getting medieval on your ass. It’s not often that the young ladies of Los Angeles get a chance to celebrate middle age — sorry, the Middle Ages — by wearing their conical herrin hats out in public, and there were almost as many of those in Pasadena Friday night as the requisite pink cowboy hats. \n\n\tRoan wasn’t wearing one of those herself at the show, although she did have a headdress that looked like something broken off from an ancient cathedral, atop a gown that made her look a little like Stevie Nicks dipped into a giant vat of golden jewels. “Gothic” was very much the motif for the on-screen fonts, the castle-like set design (which might have felt slightly familiar to recent Gaga tour-goers), and the occasional rear-screen animation of dragons, goblins and sea serpents. Were we caught up in the middle of some vast fantasy novel, or just a night at the Abbey? Why not split the difference? Roan had announced on her social media ahead of time that the theme for the L.A. shows would be “mermaids.” When she appeared on the Brookside stage, there were definitely no flappy tails in sight; at least, this mermaid had a lot of leg, and showed a lot more of it as she shed layers over the coming 90 minutes. But you had to laugh as her look was topped off by a merman’s trident as her ultimate glam accessory.\n\t\n\n\tBut none of this quite speaks to the music itself, which outside of any fashion accoutrements or queer cultural iconography boils down to the universality of pop ‘n’ roll at its most gloriously melodic, emotional, cheeky and tenderly bombastic. “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess” has absolutely no competition as the best debut album of the 2020s so far… and a strong candidate to just be named the best pop album of the 2020s, period. As has often been noted, it’s that rare album at the beginning of someone’s career that already feels like a greatest-hits. So maybe instead of the question “When will Chappell Roan make a second album?” (it’s only been two years, folks, but that is a contemporary-pop lifetime), maybe the question should be: Does she need to ever made another album? She would be within her full rights to tour off this one great album forever… all right, maybe not as forever as Lauryn Hill, but you get the picture. If she’s smart enough to not rush into the full-length next thing, we should feel lucky if she just wanted to tour this set of songs for another few years — they’re that satisfying.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChappell Roan performs on stage at Chappell Roan’s “Visions of Damsels & Other Dangerous Things” U.S. Pop-Up Tour held at Brookside at the Rose Bowl on October 10, 2025 in Pasadena, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristopher Polk/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFor Friday’s show, Roan performed almost every song she’s ever released… with the early non-album single “Love Me Anyway,” performed as an enthusiastically earnest ballad out on the catwalk, taking the place of an album track that she has performed at some other recent shows but not this one, “Kaleidoscope.” But for the most part, it was the whole of the “Princess” album + “Good Luck, Babe!” + “The Giver” + “The Subway” adding up to the early career setlist that just about anyone else would die for after a 30-year career. Plus the one real outlier, an extremely faithful cover of Heart’s “Barracuda” (without the star cameo that Nancy Wilson made the other week in Queens). The guitar breaks in this one, played by Roan’s own all-female band, gave her a chance to do one of her favorite classic-rock moves, bowing and headbanging at the feet of a shredder, except, in the instance of “Barracuda,” the two guitarists and bassist all gathered closely around the kneeling singer. It might have been the first time the Heart classic has ever been played that it looked like as well as sounded like a shark feeding frenzy.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tFor anyone who might have taken a break from “Midwest Princess” for a while, it was a chance to reconsider which songs off the album are A+ songs (most of them) and A- cuts (a few) or, God forbid, a B+ (I would relegate only the sorta-generic “Guilty Pleasure” that low). The more electronic-leaning hyperpop of “Super Graphic Ultra Modern World” is as exciting a way to open a show as could be — and maybe as topical, with its prophetically hedonistic description of “making out while the world collapses.” (That and the next selection, “Femininomenon,” served as nostalgic reminders of the bygone songwriting time when Roan, not yet fully embracing her lesbian identity, had boys figuring intoher songs, if only as letdowns.) The overtly bisexual “After Midnight” pumped up the disco as Roan danced across a castle balcony and made us wonder why in the world this remained an album track and not the dance hit of the decade. \n\n\tBut Roan is never stronger than when she’s in ballad mode. “Casual,” in concert, was just a killer, as Roan wrenched every ounce of anxious emotion out of a lyric about the boyfriend or girlfriend who wants everyone to know that it’s not a truly serious thing, just a fling — and it remains amazing that she could throw in an outrageously funny line like the “eating me out” aside and actually have it reinforce the essential seriousness of the tune, not undercut it. (Looking at all the parents with little girls in the crowd, you had to wonder how they handled youthful queries about that chorus. Maybe they say it’s about spilling In-N-Out in the car?) The even more lovelorn “Picture You” was sung by Roan to a blonde wig that she placed on her microphone stand as a romantic foil. “Coffee” was another number in which the otherwise high energy was decaffeinated, beautifully.\n\n\n\n\n\tOn the upbeat side, “Hot to Go!” had Roan almost reluctantly admitting that she no longer has to teach the spelled-out hand gestures to her audience. (By the way, it’s the second time this year that the song has been performed at Brookside; in a sign of its cultural uibiquity, the Go-Go’s interpolated it — hand movements and all — into “We Got the Beat” while playing the Cruel World festival in the summer.) How good was Roan feeling? Good enough not to chew anyone out for non-participation, as she admitted is her wont. “There’s a dad that’s not doing it… usually I would stop and call you out and make you do it, but you look really nice, so I’m not gonna do anything about it.” \n\t\n\n\t“Pink Pony Club” was the inevitable closer to the no-encores set. While everyone was looking for the Song of the Summer that never quite arrived, few have really kept track of the Song of the Decade sweepstakes, in which “Pony Club” is probably out in the lead as the frontrunner. Melodically impeccable and unforgettable, it also in a setting like this gave the audience a chance to explode with every feeling they’d either pent up or already let loose about queer people and queer-friendly people in America at a time when many would like to see all that pinkness relegated to wherever they’re trying to bury the rainbow flags. The pink folding fans being sold at the merch booths came out in force by the thousands, a commercialized way to participate in the catharsis.\n\n\tBut just prior to “Pink Pony” was a song arguably just as galvanizing — or at least it feels that way if you value the rock ‘n’ roll side of Roan as much as the toppermost-of-the-queer-poppermost side. “My Kink Is Karma” is the headbanging anthem that metal has failed to come up with for a long time — bitterness, vengeance and retaliatory joy all wrapped up in one ball that felt even more thrilling to experience with 40,000 or so people. It was a slamming song that not only crystallizes so many many of Roan’s genre-crossing gifts but makes you feel glad to be alive, and to be defying agoraphobia to be celebrating what we haven’t yet lost in popular culture, even if we’re losing it in our politics. For this and all the other slightly less fist-pumping songs that preceded or followed it, we should all tip our herrins.\n",

    "description": "\n\tShe’ll always be Annie Hall. The first time you see Diane Keaton, who died on Saturday at 79, in Woody Allen’s great touchstone of a romantic comedy",
    "body": "\n\tShe’ll always be Annie Hall. The first time you see Diane Keaton, who died on Saturday at 79, in Woody Allen’s great touchstone of a romantic comedy, she’s walking into a tennis club, her eyes peering around as cautiously as a cat’s. Within seconds, of course, Annie is apologizing for herself, but the faltering, abashed quality of it all is pure unapologetic movie-star charisma — her grin like a sunbeam, her words tumbling out in an infectious clutter, until she finally coughs up that phrase (“La-di-da!”) almost as if it were a surrender. At that moment, Annie has given up trying to make a sensible sentence speak for her. That’s probably the moment when a great many people in the audience, men and women alike, fell in love with her.\n\t\n\n\tYet part of why the blushing, halting charm of it was so funny is that Annie, as Keaton portrayed her, didn’t look like someone who needed to apologize for who she was. In “Annie Hall,” that skewed radiance of hers made her flustered shyness seem a whisper away from grace. The character’s famous surreal thrift-shop-boutique wardrobe, which was really Keaton’s — the vests worn like jackets, the tops worn like dresses, the scarves and billowy khakis and too-stately hats, the men’s ties — fit Annie to a T, because she was a little scattered. Yet those outfits were a bit like a Cubist painting: They drew elements from everywhere to create a new kind of beauty. And they were the signposts of Annie’s — and Diane Keaton’s — majesty. To dress like that, to make it work, you had to believe in the fractured image those outfits created.\n\t\n\n\tWhat the wardrobe expressed, like Keaton’s indelible performance, was the hidden power of Annie Hall’s dither. She came along at a moment when women had begun to root themselves in a newly forceful role in the culture. Yet that evolution had been preceded by too many years of women feeling like they needed to apologize, maybe in a dither, for being who they were. Annie, in her way, is one of Hollywood’s magical transformational characters: She expressed the collective abashment that women, at last, felt they were ready to leave behind, yet at the same time she paid a kind of romantic tribute to it, acting out the hidden resolve of it. When Annie finally got up and sang “Seems Like Old Times,” it was an homage to the world that was, but now those eyes of hers, no longer cautious, held the room. They held the whole world.\n\n\tIn addition, Diane Keaton will always not be Annie Hall. She began acting on Broadway in the chorus of “Hair,” and she first came to prominence in some earlier Woody Allen comedies, like “Play It Again, Sam” and “Sleeper” and “Love and Death,” where her agreeably flaked-out performances can feel like charcoal-sketch studies for “Annie Hall.” But well before she charmed the universe and won an Oscar for that 1977 classic, Diane Keaton had already established herself as a major artist with her performances in “The Godfather” and its sequel, where her acting etched an arc of its own.\n\n\tIn the first “Godfather,” she stands by her boyfriend-and-then-husband, Michael Corleone, with a devotion that’s very pure and old school. You see, for the first time, the gravitas Keaton could bring — her lilting voice and rosy stare summoning a quiet moral authority. She’s the one, in the film’s fateful final scene, who will look at Michael with a question (did he order the killing of his brother-in-law?) that then resolves itself into a silent gaze of hopeful judgment.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDiane Keaton in “The Godfather”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut in the second film, the wool is off her eyes. Kay has come to see the man — the monster — Michael has come to be, and she sees her own participation in that story. The scene in which she tells him that she has aborted their child is one of the most lacerating moments in all of American cinema. For Keaton is playing the one character who can stand up to Michael, and she does it with a tremble of brave fury that seems to emanate from Keaton’s very being.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s no wonder that after “Annie Hall” elevated her to a nearly legendary presence, she used her new clout in the industry to portray a series of characters who were all, in different ways, embodiments of complicated feminine power. “Looking for Mr. Goodbar,” which came out just six months after “Annie Hall,” is far from a great movie, yet Keaton’s raw performance as a bed-hopping schoolteacher made it a study of the sexual revolution — not the facile one celebrated by the counterculture, but the one that allowed people to act out their “liberation” as an escape from their own damage; Keaton showed you all those layers.\n\n\tAnd going forward, what she let out, and explored, in movie after movie was an underlying quality of anger (very un-Annie Hall) that lent her characters an animating force. You first saw it in Allen’s “Manhattan,” which is one of her greatest performances — she invests Mary, the high-strung, above-it-all New York journalist, with an acid quickness that bespeaks a new kind of information-age mindset, and she has a laser-like gaze that makes her, in the end, too much to handle.\n\n\tAfter that impeccable tour de force (a kind of darker bookend to “Annie Hall”), Keaton marched out into the ’80s as a very different kind of steel-sheathed-in-velvet leading lady. In “Reds,” opposite Warren Beatty, she acts out an epic tug-of-war of love and politics, and in “Shoot the Moon,” perhaps the most scalding drama ever made about divorce, she and Albert Finney go at each other with an intertwined rage and regret that leaves you shaken. In “Mrs. Soffel,” as a prison warden’s wife who falls for a convict, Keaton showed you how deeply she could enact not just the wistfulness of love but the danger of it.  \n\n\tBut lest one thought that her incandescent comic charm had gone away, Keaton never let go of it. It was there in her most casual moments — the way that she could instantly light up the screen with that blissed-out grin. And it’s there in what became one of my all-time favorite guilty-pleasure movies: “Baby Boom” (1987), an early Nancy Meyers project (she’s the co-writer) in which Keaton plays a yuppie executive who inherits a 14-month-old baby and somehow transforms this into a triumph of maternal energy…and marketing. It’s pure ’80s kitsch, but behold the daffy conviction with which Keaton plays it.\n\t\n\n\tShe became a director (of music videos, like the one for Belinda Carlisle’s “Heaven,” and of episodic television like “Twin Peaks”), as well as a producer (of films like Gus Van Sant’s “Elephant”). And as she moved into middle-aged roles, Keaton put her stamp on them in a special way, retaining every effervescent bubble of her charm, but investing the giddy farce mechanics of comedies like “The First Wives Club” with a kind of devotion that helped elevate them into enduring entertainments. As someone whose most famous role had her dithering to find the right words, she became an actor who could use words in the most cutting of ways. Yet it must be said: The fact that audiences never stopped seeing Annie Hall in her was not a mark of patronization — it was a measure of how much she could transport us with her glow, which remained, to the end, as irresistible as it was undimmed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDirector Bill Condon‘s vision for adapting “Kiss of the Spider Woman” for the big screen was to draw inspiration from the old MGM musicals. Specifically, Vincente Minnelli’s productions from the golden age of Hollywood.\n\n\tManuel Puig’s 1976 novel “Kiss of the Spider Woman” was first turned into a movie by director Héctor Babenco in 1985. Condon’s version, now in theaters, is based on the stage musical by Terrence McNally, John Kander and Fred Ebb. It stars Jennifer Lopez in the dual roles of screen goddess Ingrid and the sultry and seductive Aurora.\n\t\n\n\tProduction designer Scott Chambliss was instructed by Condon to “mimic as closely as we possibly could the style of those movies and not filter it through contemporary tastes.” Those films included “An American in Paris,” “Gigi” and “Ziegfeld Follies.“\n\n\n\tHowever, the film’s plot meant that Chambliss felt like he was making two movies in one. Set in Argentina in 1983, as a military dictatorship rules the country, Luis (Tonatiuh), a gay window dresser, is imprisoned with Valentin (Diego Luna), a political prisoner. Luis hangs a poster of his favorite movie star, Ingrid, and spends his time fantasizing about Ingrid as Aurora.\n\n\tFor the showstopping musical numbers, which play as a fantasy in Luis’ mind, Chambliss says, “We were always referring back to Vincente and his work.” He adds, “Sometimes, it was his less successful movies that we were looking at for inspiration, like ‘Yolanda and the Thief.’”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFor designing the prison cell, Chambliss explains, “In looking at that tiny cell and the drama of those two men and the horror of the prison they were in, it felt like this prison had to be operatic in its drama and in its visual style. That’s what led us directly to the location we chose to be our prison in Montevideo, which is this grand, scary-as-hell ruin of what used to be a prison.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe two stories are intimately tied together through the characters. For Aurora’s lair, Chambliss was inspired by the musicals of Hollywood’s golden age, specifically the 1953 film “Sombrero.” “Cyd Charisse is dancing on a soundstage on a fake-ass mountaintop with the two-dimensional painted backdrop right behind her head, and these ridiculous-looking sculptures and rocks. It’s the most fabulous thing ever,” he says. The sheer artificiality of that scene was something he and Condon wanted to capture. “The Spider Woman’s lair itself was the perfect moment to do that.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tChambliss confirmed there were no visual effects tricks used in the movie, “except to plug in a few deep backgrounds when we needed to.” Aurora’s spider web was made out of string and glue, very much in line with how the old musicals were created. Says Chambliss, “It is as old school as it gets, and that was such fabulous fun.”\n",

Zoë Steiner, Tig Notaro, Robert Picardo also star along with guest stars Oded Fehr, Mary Wiseman, with recurring guest stars Gina Yashere and Paul Giamatti.\n\t\n\n\tThe logline for the series states that it “introduces viewers to a young group of cadets who come together to pursue a common dream of hope and optimism. Under the watchful and demanding eyes of their instructors, they discover what it takes to become Starfleet officers as they navigate blossoming friendships, explosive rivalries, first loves and a new enemy that threatens both the Academy and the Federation itself.” \n\n\tAlex Kurtzman and Noga Landau serve as co-showrunners and executive produce the series alongside executive producers Gaia Violo, Aaron Baiers, Olatunde Osunsanmi, Jenny Lumet, Rod Roddenberry, Trevor Roth, Frank Siracusa and John Weber. The series’ premiere episode is written by Gaia Violo and directed by Alex Kurtzman. It is produced by CBS Studios in association with Secret Hideout and Roddenberry Entertainment.

    "body": "\n\tBette Midler, Ben Stiller, Kerry Washington, Nancy Sinatra and more are paying to Academy Award-winning actress Diane Keaton, who died at 79 on Saturday.\n\n\tKeaton’s “The First Wives Club” co-star Bette Midler posted on Threads a carousel of photos of them together and wrote, “The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. \n\n\n\tMidler continued, “She was hilarious, and completely without guile or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. What you saw was who she was…oh, la, lala!”\n\t\n\n\tHer other “The First Wives Club” co-star Goldie Hawn paid tribute to the actress with an Instagram post that she captioned, “I was blessed to make ‘First Wives Club’ with you. Our days starting with coffee in the makeup trailer, laughing and joking, right through to the very last day of filming. It was a roller coaster of love.”\n\n\tShe continued, “We agreed to grow old together, and one day, maybe live together with all our girlfriends. Well, we never got to live together, but we did grow older together. Who knows –maybe in the next life. Shine your fairy dust up there, girlfriend. I’m going to miss the hell out of you.”\n\n\n\tSarah Jessica Parker told Variety in a statement how much Keaton was an inspiration to her: “Diane Keaton has been a point of inspiration for countless actresses. I include myself among those who loved and admired her. I was very privileged to witness her singular skill and talent on both ‘The First Wives Club’ and ‘The Family Stone.’ I will cherish those memories on set as well her touching, delightful and perfectly own cinematic career, which is a gorgeous legacy of an exquisite person. She will be terribly missed. RIP.”\n\t\n\n\tBen Stiller reacted to the news on X by acknowledging her longstanding career: “One of the greatest film actors ever. An icon of style, humor and comedy. Brilliant. What a person.”\n\nDiane Keaton. One of the greatest film actors ever. An icon of style, humor and comedy. Brilliant. What a person.— Ben Stiller (@BenStiller) October 11, 2025\n\n\n\tKerry Washington also shared her condolences on Threads, sharing a portrait image of the Oscar winner and wrote “Rest in peace, Diane Keaton. Your talent, courage, and authenticity were a true inspiration.”\n\n\tJane Fonda said on Instagram, “It’s hard to believe or accept that Diane has passed. She was always a spark of life and light, constantly giggling at her own foibles, being limitlessly creative in her acting, her wardrobe, her books, her friends, her homes, her library, her world view. Unique is what she was. And, though she didn’t know it or wouldn’t admit it, man she was a fine actress!”\n\n\n\tBelinda Carlisle reflected on working with Keaton, who directed two of the singer’s music videos, “”Heaven Is A Place on Earth” and “I Get Weak.”\n\n\t“I can’t,” Carlisle wrote on X followed by a heartbroken emoji. “Diane Keaton was such a talent and a big part of my career.

She directed two videos of mine – \"Heaven Is A Place on Earth\" and the video for \"I Get Weak.\"She was kind and eccentric and I was blessed to know her. RIP Diane, you will be missed. 💔 pic.twitter.com/PbDVNQsJh8— Belinda Carlisle 💙 (@belindacarlisle) October 11, 2025\n\n\n\tOctavia Spencer said, “Today we lost a true original. @diane_keaton wasn’t just an actress: she was a force. a woman who showed us that being yourself is the most powerful thing you can be.”\n\n\n\tKate Hudson, whose mother Goldie Hawn co-starred with Keaton in “The First Wives Club,” wrote, “We love you so much Diane.”\n\n\n\tSinger Nancy Sinatra spoke about how she “idolized” the beloved actress: “Diane Keaton has left us and I can’t tell you how profoundly sad that makes me,” she wrote. “I adored her — idolized her. She was a very special person and an incredibly gifted actor, who made each of her roles unforgettable. Her light will continue to shine through the art she leaves behind. Godspeed, Diane. My heart goes out to her family and to each of us grieving this heartbreaking loss.”\n\t\n\nDiane Keaton has left us and I can’t tell you how profoundly sad that makes me.

God, not yet, NO!!! Man… you defined womanhood. The pathos, humor, levity, your ever-present youthfulness and vulnerability — you tattooed your SOUL into every role, making it impossible to imagine anyone else inhabiting them. You were undeniably, unapologetically YOU!!! Loved you. Man… rest well. God bless your family, and I know angels are flying you home.”\n\n\n\tJeremy O. Harris said in a tweet, “RIP to one of America’s most graceful, elegant and fiercely talented muses Diane Keaton who maintained a sense of self throughout her many roles that was a reminder to me as a young performer that the most interesting person you can mine are the many aspects of yourself.”\n\nRIP to one of America’s most graceful, elegant, and fiercely talented muses Diane Keaton who maintained a sense of self throughout her many roles that was a reminder to me as a young performer that the most interesting person you can mine are the many aspects of yourself. pic.twitter.com/qXJ7iRS1zY— Jeremy O. Harris (@jeremyoharris) October 11, 2025\n\n\n\tFilmmaker and producer Joe Russo shared his admiration for Keaton with the tweet: “Whether it’s ANNIE HALL or SOMETHING’S GOTTA GIVE, we’ll always remember when we fell in love with Diane Keaton. RIP to an icon.”\n\n\n\tMatthew Modine reflected on his time spent with Keaton while on set of the 1984 film”Mrs. Soffel” with a throwback photo.\n\n\t“Every so often a person comes along that defies all definition,” he wrote on Threads. “They’re a mystery. Sometimes it’s when they go digging within themselves attempting to discover something hidden deep inside. All that behind a gorgeous smile, razor sharp wit and infectious laugh. God speed sister.”\n\n\tMelissa Rivers also remembered Keaton, writing “Diane Keaton could do anything! From dramatic roles like Kay Corleone in ‘The Godfather’ trilogy, to her hilariously offbeat portrayal of Annie Hall, which won her an Oscar, her talent seemed limitless. I also remember her lovely cold call to my mom after the release of her documentary, ‘A Piece of Work,’ just to share her admiration. She will be greatly missed.”\n\n",

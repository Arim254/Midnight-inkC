    "body": "\n\tBillie Eilish delivered a pointed critique of the Trump administration’s approach to civil rights and immigration enforcement while accepting the Martin Luther King Jr. Beloved Community Award for Environmental Justice this past weekend in Atlanta.\n\n\tEilish devoted her King Center acceptance speech to highlighting what she described as deteriorating conditions under current federal leadership, according to Rolling Stone.\n\n\n\t“It’s very strange to be celebrated for working toward environmental justice at a time where it feels less achievable than ever given the state of our country and the world right now,” Eilish said. “We’re seeing our neighbors being kidnapped, peaceful protesters being assaulted and murdered, our civil rights being stripped, resources to fight the climate crisis being cut for fossil fuels and animal agriculture destroying our planet, and people’s access to food and healthcare becoming a privilege for the wealthy instead of a new basic human right for all Americans.”\n\t\n\n\tThe artist has previously leveraged awards ceremonies to address broader social issues. At the WSJ Innovator Awards in October, she challenged wealthy individuals to redistribute their resources, with her own tour generating $11.5 million in charitable donations announced that same evening.\n\n\tEilish’s criticism of federal immigration enforcement intensified following the January death of Renee Nicole Good, 37, who was killed by an ICE agent. The musician posted multiple Instagram Stories denouncing the agency, including one that characterized ICE as “a federally funded and supported terrorist group under the Department of Homeland Security that has done nothing to make our streets safer.” She also shared a memorial listing 32 individuals who perished in ICE detention throughout 2025, marking one of the agency’s most fatal years since its 2003 establishment.\n\t\n\n\t“It is very clear that protecting our planet and our communities is not a priority for this administration. And it’s really hard to celebrate that when we no longer feel safe in our own homes or in our streets,” Eilish said while accepting the award. “I have this platform and I think it’s my responsibility to use it, so I feel like I’m just doing what anyone in my position should be doing.”\n\n\tThe musician expressed ambivalence about receiving the honor, stating she doesn’t “feel deserving” of the recognition, though she concluded her remarks by acknowledging other recipients and expressing gratitude to her parents.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe trailer has debuted for İlker Çatak’s “Yellow Letters,” which has just been selected to play in competition at the Berlinale, where his last film, the Oscar-nominated “The Teachers’ Lounge,” also launched.\n\n\n\n\n\tInternational sales are handled by Brussels-based sales company Be For Films, while German distribution is handled by A La Mode, which will release the film theatrically in Germany on March 5.\n\t\n\n\t“Yellow Letters,” starring Turkish actors Özgü Namal and Tansu Biçer, is a political drama that explores how authoritarian pressure infiltrates private lives and fractures families from within.\n\n\n\tThe film is set in the artistic and academic milieu and portrays the silent mechanisms of exclusion and the emotional toll of waiting, fear and uncertainty, while examining how political systems shape the most intimate decisions of everyday life.\n\n\tIt is produced by Ingo Fliess of If… Productions, in co-production with Haut et Court in France and Limanfilm in Turkey.\n\n\tThe film reunites Çatak with key collaborators from “The Teachers’ Lounge,” including cinematographer Judith Kaufmann, editor Gesa Jäger, production designer Zazie Knepper and composer Marvin Miller.\n\n\t“Yellow Letters” follows an artist couple Derya and Aziz who experience the arbitrariness of the Turkish state and lose their jobs and livelihood overnight. The trade-off between their ideals and the necessities of life proves to be a challenge for their marriage.\n\n\t“This story is about people who have lost their employment, their social status and their right to exist in Turkish society due to state arbitrariness,” said Çatak, who wrote the screenplay with Ayda Çatak.\n\t\n\n\t“There are a number of artists who are no longer allowed to be in Turkey and I want to give these people a chance and cast our film with actors who are now or soon living in exile,” Çatak continued.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Playmaker will launch international sales for the animated feature “The Unicorn That Said No” at the European Film Market in Berlin, which runs Feb. 12-18. The company will present a first-look teaser at the event. Warner Bros. will release the film in Germany in the fourth quarter of this year. \n\n\tThe film is based on the bestselling children’s book written by Marc-Uwe Kling, with illustrations by Astrid Henn. The book has been translated into 27 languages.\n\t\n\n\tThe Playmaker released the following description of the film: “In the Forest of Hearts, a little, sweepity, swoopity, swappity, sweet unicorn is born. But even though everyone is very lilacly-loving to it and constantly feeds it with sweet lucky clover, the little critter does not behave unicorn-like at all. It just keeps saying no, so soon its family just calls it uNOcorn. \n\n\n\t“One day, the uNOcorn breaks out of its cotton candy world and sets off to NOWHERE. On the way, he unexpectedly meets a raccoon that refuses to listen (HUHcoon), a watchdog that doesn‘t seem to care about anything (SOWHATchdog), and princess that always talks back (PrinceYES). The four of them make a pretty good team. Because even being stubborn is much more fun together.”\n\n\tThe film will be directed by Studio Soi and Kling. It is produced by Uwe Schott and Nicole Kellerhals at X-Filme Creative Pool with Studio Soi and Steffen Schier, Margret Mackuth and Julia Hayungs at Warner Bros. Film Productions Germany. \n\n\tIt is supported by BKM, FFA, Medien- und Filmförderung Baden-Württemberg, and Mitteldeutsche Medienförderung. \n\t\n\n\tGamze Celik, sales and acquisitions manager at The Playmaker, said, “We are very excited to have ‘The Unicorn That Said No’ in our lineup. The book is a worldwide hit and has already brought joy to so many children and their families. We cannot wait to see the movie adaptation on the big screen. I know it’s going to be a very cute and very fun adventure for all ages.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndonesian filmmaker Joko Anwar has unveiled the international teaser for his horror-comedy “Ghost in the Cell” as the film prepares for its world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival‘s Forum section.\n\n\tSet within an Indonesian correctional facility, the narrative follows inmates whose survival instincts are tested when a mysterious new prisoner arrives accompanied by a supernatural entity that targets those with the darkest aura. As deaths mount, the incarcerated population discovers that collective action may be their only path to survival.\n\t\n\n\t“Beneath its supernatural surface lies something very real: the massive deforestation in Indonesia and the way this destruction is too often met with silence or neglect,” Anwar said in his director’s statement. “The ghost in this film is not only a presence haunting the cells, but also a reminder of consequences we choose not to face.”\n\n\n\tThe production represents another collaboration between Anwar and producer Tia Hasibuan through their Jakarta-based Come and See Pictures, alongside Rapi Films, South Korea’s Barunson E&A – the studio behind Bong Joon Ho’s Oscar-winning “Parasite” – and Legacy Pictures. The ensemble cast features Abimana Aryasatya, Lukman Sardi, Bront Palarae, Aming, Rio Dewanto, Morgan Oey and Tora Sudiro.\n\n\tBarunson E&A is handling worldwide sales on the project as part of a two-year agreement with Come and See Pictures.\n\n\tThe Indonesia-South Korea co-production is scheduled for Indonesian theatrical release in the second quarter of 2026. The project represents the latest output from Come and See Pictures, which recently delivered Netflix’s “Joko Anwar’s Nightmares and Daydreams” and Amazon MGM Studios’ “The Siege at Thorn High.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the international teaser here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Match Factory is launching sales on “Queen at Sea” by Lance Hammer, starring Academy Award winner Juliette Binoche, and “Home Stories,” the third feature film by Eva Trobisch, ahead of their world premieres at Berlinale in the competition section next month. \n\n\tThe company is bringing four films to this year’s festival, all playing in competition. The lineup includes “Rosebush Pruning” by Karim Aïnouz, produced by The Match Factory, and “Rose,” the latest film by Markus Schleinzer, starring Sandra Hüller.\n\t\n\n\t“Queen at Sea,” which also stars two time Academy Award nominee Tom Courtenay, marks the return to Berlin of the U.S. filmmaker Lance Hammer with his second feature, following the acclaimed debut “Ballast,” which earned him a best director prize at Sundance and six Independent Spirit Award nominations. \n\n\n\tHammer’s latest work explores how dementia erodes a woman’s ability to communicate her inner life. As her husband and daughter struggle to act in her best interest, they must navigate love and the fragile boundaries between care, protection, and autonomy. \n\n\tAlongside Binoche and Courtenay are Anna Calder-Marshall (“Wuthering Heights”) and Florence Hunt (“Bridgerton”). The feature is a production from The Bureau and is produced by Tristan Goligher. This is the second collaboration between The Bureau and The Match Factory, which also represents “45 Years” by Andrew Haigh. The Match Factory is also handling worldwide sales for Haigh’s upcoming film “A Long Winter.”\n\n\tTrobisch is a rising voice in German cinema. After her striking debut “All Good” (best debut film at Locarno, 2018) and “Ivo” (Berlinale Encounters, 2024), the director is bringing “Home Stories” to Berlinale competition, exploring family, belonging, and the search for identity. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Max Riemelt, Eva Löbau and, making her screen debut, Frida Hornemann, and is produced by Trimafilm in co-production with Komplizen Film, if…Productions, and ZDF/ARTE in collaboration with The Post Republic.\n\t\n\n\tAfter the acclaimed “Motel Destino” (Cannes competition, 2024) and “Firebrand” (Cannes competition, 2023), Aïnouz is back in Berlin with his highly anticipated “Rosebush Pruning.” Aїnouz’s collaboration with MUBI, The Match Factory, Kavac Film, The Apartment, SUR FILM, Crybaby and Gold Rush Pictures, stars Callum Turner (“Masters of the Air,” “The Boys in the Boat”), Riley Keough (“Daisy Jones & the Six,” “Zola”), Jamie Bell (“All of Us Strangers,” “Rocketman”), Lukas Gage (“The White Lotus,” “Euphoria”), Elena Anaya (“The Skin I Live In,” “MotherFatherSon”) with Tracy Letts (“Lady Bird,” “Ford vs Ferrari”), and Elle Fanning (“Sentimental Value,” “A Complete Unknown”) and Pamela Anderson (“The Last Showgirl,” “The Naked Gun”). \n\n\t“Rosebush Pruning” is written by Efthimis Filippou (“Kinds of Kindness,” “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” “The Lobster”) and producers for The Match Factory are Viola Fügen and Michael Weber. The Match Factory represents several Aïnouz titles including “Motel Destino” (2024), “Mariner of the Mountains” (2021), “The Invisible Life of Euridice Gusmão” (2019) and “Praia do Futuro” (2014).\n\n\t“Rose” is the third feature by Austrian director and actor Markus Schleinzer after “Michael” (Cannes competition, 2011) and “Angelo” (TIFF, 2018). “Rose” is a historical drama, starring Academy Award-nominated Sandra Hüller (“Zone of Interest,” “Anatomy of a Fall”), one of Germany’s most celebrated actors. The film tells the true and twisted tale of a deceiver of land and folk, who, defying her birth as a woman, comported herself as a man and committed many a wicked deed. The Austrian-German production is a Schubert, Row Pictures and Walker + Worm Film production. The Match Factory has previously collaborated with Row Pictures on “Someday We’ll Tell Each Other Everything” by Emily Atef and with Walker + Worm on “Sisi & I” by Frauke Finsterwalder.\n",

    "description": "\n\tNetflix has officially agreed to pay all cash for Warner Bros. Discovery‘s studios and HBO Max business — a move aimed at thwarting Paramount Skydan",
    "body": "\n\tNetflix has officially agreed to pay all cash for Warner Bros. Discovery‘s studios and HBO Max business — a move aimed at thwarting Paramount Skydance’s rival takeover campaign.\n\n\tNetflix and WBD announced Tuesday that they amended their definitive agreement for Netflix’s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. assets to an all-cash transaction of $27.75 per share. The deal continues to carry an $82.7 billion enterprise value. The companies said the revised agreement “simplifies the transaction structure, provides greater certainty of value for WBD stockholders, and accelerates the path to a WBD stockholder vote.”\n\t\n\n\tNetflix’s original agreement with WBD, announced Dec. 5, was about 84% cash, while Paramount Skydance has been offering 100% in cash. One relative weakness with the Netflix pact as originally constructed: If Netflix’s stock declined below a certain threshold, the payout to WBD shareholders would be lower.\n\n\n\tNetflix’s all-cash deal “provides enhanced certainty around the value WBD stockholders will receive at closing, eliminating market-based variability,” Netflix and WBD said. In addition, the revised deal terms will facilitate a “faster path” to a WBD stockholder vote on the Netflix deal: Shareholders will be able to to vote on the proposed transaction by April 2026. On Tuesday WBD filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC “to support this accelerated timeline.”\n\n\tNetflix and WBD said their deal is still on track to close 12-18 months following the signing of their original agreement on Dec. 4, 2025.\n\n\tNetflix’s original bid included $59 billion in debt financing from three banks: Wells Fargo, BNP and HSBC. The amended, all-cash transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of both Netflix and WBD. The M&A transaction remains subject regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Europe, as well as approval by WBD stockholders. \n\t\n\n\tNetflix’s revised deal comes as David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance has continued to press its case to shareholders for why its $30/share all-cash hostile bid is superior to the Netflix pact, despite the WBD board rejecting eight different offers from Paramount. The Paramount camp has also asserted that its takeover of WBD would face less regulatory pushback than a Netflix-WB combination.\n\n\tEarlier this month, Paramount filed a lawsuit seeking to compel WBD to disclose financial details of the Netflix deal including how WBD is valuing the proposed Discovery Global cable TV networks spin-off. Paramount also officially declared that it would launch a proxy fight, with plans nominate its own WBD board candidates for election at Warner Bros. Discovery’s annual shareholder meeting who would back the Paramount bid.\n\n\tIn its Jan. 20 proxy filing, WBD said the board’s analysis of “selected public companies” on a sum-of-the-parts basis indicated an approximate implied equity value reference range for Discovery Global of$2.41 to $3.77 per share. Furthermore, it said, an analysis of Discovery Global in the context of a potential future acquisition (based on a selected transactions analysis) indicated Discovery Global is valued at $4.63 to $6.86 per share.\n\n\tParamount, in asserting that its $30/share offer beats the Netflix deal, claimed its analysis shows that shares in Discovery Global would have zero value (although it allowed that Discovery Global had a theoretical M&A value of $0.50/share).\n\n\tIn their announcement Tuesday, Netflix and WBD said they have each submitted their Hart-Scott-Rodino filings with the FTC and the Justice Department’s antitrust division and that they are “engaging with competition authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and European Commission.” As previously disclosed, the transaction is expected to close 12-18 months from Dec. 5, when Netflix and WBD originally entered into their merger agreement.\n\n\tDavid Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, said: “Today’s revised merger agreement brings us even closer to combining two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world and with it even more people enjoying the entertainment they love to watch the most.“\n\n\tNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a statement, “Our revised all-cash agreement will enable an expedited timeline to a stockholder vote and provide greater financial certainty at $27.75 per share in cash, plus the value from the planned separation of Discovery Global. Together, Netflix and Warner Bros. will deliver broader choice and greater value to audiences worldwide, enhancing access to world-class television and film both at home and in theaters. The acquisition will also significantly expand U.S. production capacity and investment in original programming, driving job creation and long-term industry growth.”\n\t\n\n\tGreg Peters, Netflix’s other co-CEO, added, “Over the last decade, when much of the entertainment industry has contracted, Netflix has grown and invested tremendously in the business of film and television in the U.S. and abroad. This transaction will further fuel that growth and investment. By amending our agreement today, we are underscoring what we have believed all along: not only does our transaction provide superior stockholder value, it is also fundamentally pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-creator and pro-growth.”\n\n\tUnder Netflix’s deal with WBD, the streaming giant would acquire the Warner Bros. film and television studios, HBO and HBO Max, and its games division. That would happen after WBD separates Warner Bros. and Discovery Global into two separate publicly traded companies, which is is expected to be completed in six to nine months.\n\n\tSince the Warner Bros. deal was announced Dec. 5, Netflix shares have dropped below the “collar” of $97.91/share in the original WBD agreement; in that case WBD shareholders would have received 0.0460 Netflix shares for each WBD share, instead of $4.50 worth of Netflix stock per WBD share. Now that concern is off the table.\n\n\tParamount Skydance is offering to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety (including the TV networks like CNN, TNT, TBS, HGTV and Food Network). Paramount’s takeover offers are backed by David Ellison’s father, Oracle co-founder and multibillionaire Larry Ellison, along with partners including RedBird Capital Partners and the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.\n\n\tNetflix and WBD said the financing structure of Netflix’s all-cash deal is not subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the U.S. government entity that oversees foreign investment in American companies. Paramount has claimed that its offer won’t require CFIUS review because the Arab wealth funds “have agreed to forgo any governance rights” including board representation.\n\n\tThe breakup fees in the Netflix-WBD deal remain unchanged. If WBD backs out of the deal, it must pay a termination fee of $2.8 billion to Netflix. If the deal is blocked by regulators, Netflix is on the hook to pay $5.8 billion to WBD.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTwo years after he won best actor at the 2024 Irish Film & TV Academy (IFTA) awards, the final stop on what proved to be complete awards season domination for “Oppenheimer,” Cillian Murphy is back in the mix on home soil for “Steve.”\n\n\tThe Irish actor is among a number of major names with 2026 IFTA nominations, including the Oscar-tipped Jessie Buckley for “Hamnet” alongside her co-star “Paul Mescal,” plus Daniel Day-Lewis for “Anemone” and Colin Farrell for “Ballad of a Small Player.” \n\t\n\n\t“Christy,” the Irish film about a young man seeking independence after leaving the foster system (and not the Sydney Sweeney-fronted boxing biopic of the same name), emerged with the most nominations, with 14, followed by the football comedy biopic “Saipan” with 12. Meanwhile, there’s a record number of women nominated in directing categories, with seven across film and TV.\n\n\n\tThis year, Ciarán Hinds is set to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n\tThe 23rd IFTA Awards Ceremony will take place on February 20th at the Dublin Royal Convention Centre. \n\n\tSee the full list of nominees below\n\n\tBEST FILMAontasBlue Moon ChristyFour Mothers SaipanSteve\n\n\tDIRECTOR – FILMLisa Barros D’Sa, Glenn Leyburn – Saipan Brendan Canty – ChristyMyrid Carten – A Want in HerLorcan Finnegan – The SurferRuán Magan – BáiteEdwin Mullane, Adam O’Keeffe – Horseshoe\n\n\tSCRIPT – FILMSarah Gordon, Damian McCann – Aontas Maggie O’Farrell, Chloé Zhao – Hamnet Alan O’Gorman – ChristySheena Lambert – BáiteDarren Thornton, Colin Thornton – Four MothersEnda Walsh – Die My Love\n\n\tLEAD ACTOR – FILMSteve Coogan – SaipanDaniel Day-Lewis – AnemoneColin Farrell – Ballad of a Small Player Éanna Hardwicke – SaipanCillian Murphy – SteveDaniel Power – Christy\n\t\n\n\tLEAD ACTRESS – FILMJessie Buckley – HamnetCarolyn Bracken – Horseshoe Carrie Crowley – AontasFionnula Flanagan – Four Mothers Eleanor O’Brien – BáiteFiona Shaw – Hot Milk\n\n\tSUPPORTING ACTOR – FILMLiam Cunningham – Palestine 36Jamie Forde – ChristyPaul Mescal – Hamnet Diarmuid Noyes – Christy Seán T.

    "description": "\n\tThe Berlin Film Festival has unveiled the competition lineup of its 76th edition, including Karim Aïnouz’s starry “Rosebush Pruning” with Riley Keou",
    "body": "\n\tThe Berlin Film Festival has unveiled the competition lineup of its 76th edition, including Karim Aïnouz’s starry “Rosebush Pruning” with Riley Keough, Callum Turner and Elle Fanning, as well as Channing Tatum’s latest feature “Josephine.”\n\n\tThis edition is the second year under artistic director Tricia Tuttle, and its lineup looks to blend international prestige auteurs, politically charged cinema and intimate character studies with a healthy dose of A-list firepower, underscoring the growing convergence of Hollywood talent and awards-friendly European helmers.\n\t\n\n\t“Rosebush Pruning,” which also features Jamie Bell, Lukas Gage, Elena Anaya, Tracy Letts and Pamela Anderson, is among the buzziest of the titles in competition. The contemporary satire, from “Motel Destino” and “Firebrand” helmer Aïnouz, follows the fractured relationships between siblings forced to confront the truth about their mother’s death. Tuttle said “Rosebush Pruning” is a “twisted thriller about a privileged family unraveling when dark secrets emerge.”\n\n\n\tAnother hotly anticipated film making its premiere in competition is “Josephine,” directed by Beth de Araújo and starring Channing Tatum and Gemma Chan as parents searching for justice after their young daughter witnesses a crime. The psychological thriller, which marks Araújo’s sophomore outing, will bow at Sundance and is one of the two films premiering internationally in competition at the Berlinale. Tuttle said the film is a “really personal story” for de Araújo who “captures the trauma and the powerlessness of a family whose sense of safety has been shattered.”\n\t\n\n\tTuttle unpacked the lineup on Tuesday morning alongside co-directors of film programming Jacqueline Lyanga and Michael Stütz. The first competition title announced was Kornél Mundruczó’s “At the Sea,” which she described as an “expansive drama” with an “absolutely enthralling” performance from Amy Adams, who plays a former dancer confronting identity and trauma after rehab. The Hungarian filmmaker is best known for his 2020 drama “Pieces of a Woman,” which earned its star Vanessa Kirby a best actress nomination at the Oscars.\n\n\t“We fell in love with so many films this year and I think what was exciting for us as a selection committee is just how diverse these films are,” Tuttle said during the streamed presentation, pointing that “lots of really interesting films for the market that haven’t sold yet. “We really believe that there is something exciting for all kinds of audiences, whatever your tastes are, whatever cinema you like. You will find filmmakers working at the top of their game in this competition, but doing their own thing as well, too,” she continued. \n\n\tEuropean royalty will also be on hand at the Berlinale with former jury president Juliette Binoche, starring alongside Tom Courtenay in Lance Hammer’s “Queen at Sea,” a tender examination of dementia, autonomy and marital devotion; and German superstar Sandra Hüller (“A Zone of Interest,” “Anatomy of a Fall” who will lead Markus Schleinzer’s stark period piece “Rose,” set in a suspicious Protestant village in the early 17th century. The lineup brings back several Berlinale alumni, including Mexican director Fernando Eimbcke’s intimate black-and-white tale “Moscas (“Flies”), his follow up to “Olmo,” an award-winning family drama produced by Plan B and Michel France which played at last year’s Berlin; two-time Silver Bear winner Angela Schanelec (“Music,” “I Was at Home, But”) who will present “Meine Frau weint” (“My Wife Cries”); Turkish-German director İlker Çatak, whose previous film “The Teachers Lounge” won a prize at the Berlinale Panorama in 2023 and went on to earn an Oscar nomination. Çatak comes back to Potsdamer Platz with “Gelbe Briefe” (“Yellow Letters”),” which “explores the effects of escalating state oppression on a married couple from Ankara,” said Stütz. \n\n\tSenegalese helmer Alain Gomis, who won the Silver Bear in 2017 with “Felicité,” returns with “Dao,” which is set between France and Guinea Bissau, weaving themes of family and heritage. German director Eva Trobisch, whose 2024 movie “Ivo” played in the Encounters section in 2024, will present “Etwas ganz Besonderes” (“Home Stories”), which boasts a “multi-layered script and an excellent ensemble of actors who embody this tale of a fractured German family torn between East and West,” Tuttle said.\n\t\n\n\tOther anticipated films set to compete include “We Are All Strangers,” Singaporean filmmaker Anthony Chen‘s third and final film in his acclaimed “Growing Up” trilogy, which includes “Ilo Ilo,” Cannes’ Camera d’Or winner and “Wet Season,” which opened at Toronto; and Chad’s Mahamat-Saleh Haroun’s mystical coming-of-age tale “Soumsoum, la nuit des astres.” Mahamat-Saleh Haroun is best known for his Cannes’ jury prize-winning “A Screaming Man.” \n\n\tAnimation is also in the competition mix with “A New Dawn,” the first solo feature by Yoshitoshi Shinomiya, an artist on major anime works who is notably behind “Your Name.,” a massive 2016 box office hit. \n\n\tTuttle has peppered the lineup with a few surprises, such as the jazz-inflected “Everybody Digs Bill Evans” from photographer and documentary filmmaker Grant Gee, who portrays the inner life of  legendary jazz pianist Bill Evans grieving the loss of his bassist and musical soulmate in a tragic car crash. The British film stars Anders Danielsen Lie, Bill Pullman and Laurie Metcalf.\n\n\tAs previously announced, Afghan director Shahrbanoo Sadat’s romantic comedy “No Good Men” is kicking off the festival and celebrated German director Wim Wenders set to succeed Todd Haynes as jury president. A German co-production, “No Good Men” is a romantic comedy set inside a Kabul newsroom during the democratic era before the Taliban returned to power in 2021.\n\n\tAfter last year’s edition saw the likes of Timothée Chalamet and Robert Pattinson presenting films at the Palast, this edition’s big star power will be spread across the entire lineup, from the competition to the Perspectives, Panorama and Special Gala sections, including the international debut of Charli xcx’s anticipated “Brat” mockumentary “The Moment,” the world premiere of Isabelle Huppert vampire film “The Blood Countess” and historical drama “The Weight” starring Ethan Hawke and Russell Crowe.\n\n\tTuttle, an American curator and former head of the London Film Festival who took over from Carlo Chatrian in 2025, has said before that she strives to bring the Berlinale closer to Cannes.\n\t\n\n\tThe 76th edition of the Berlin Film Festival is set to take place Feb. 12-22.\n\n\tSee the full lineup below.\n\n\tCOMPETITION\n\n\t“At the Sea” by Kornél Mundruczó | with Amy Adams, Murray Bartlett, Chloe East, Brett Goldstein, Dan LevyUSA / Hungary 2026Competition | World premiereAfter a stint in rehab, a woman returns to her family’s Cape Cod home where sobriety forces her to confront buried trauma and the terrifying question of who she is without her career as a dancer.\n\n\t“Dao” by Alain Gomis | with Katy Correa, D’Johé Kouadio, Samir Guesmi, Mike Etienne, Nicolas GomisFrance / Senegal / Guinea-Bissau 2026Competition | World premiereA film in which two celebrations of life, a wedding in France and a commemoration in Guinea Bissau, are organically intertwined with the threads of a family and heritage that live and travel between these two worlds.

    "body": "\n\t“Sinatra The Musical” will make its West End premiere this summer, with performances beginning June 3 at the Aldwych Theatre in London.\n\n\tThe production, which played a sold-out run at Birmingham Rep in 2023, showcases more than 20 signature songs from the legendary crooner’s catalog, including “That’s Life,” “One For My Baby,” “The Best Is Yet to Come” and “Come Fly With Me.” \n\n\tThe musical opens on New Year’s Eve 1942, as a 27-year-old Sinatra prepares to take the stage at New York’s Paramount Theatre for a career-defining performance. The narrative follows his rapid ascent to stardom, his marriage to Nancy Sinatra, and his tumultuous affair with Ava Gardner, which coincides with a dramatic downturn in his career. The story culminates with Sinatra’s historic comeback, driven by his dedication to family and relentless artistic determination.\n\t\n\n\t“My dad used to always say, ‘If I can’t feel it, I can’t sing it,'” says Tina Sinatra. “As a result, he wasn’t just singing songs, he was recording an emotional diary of his life. And it’s these classic songs that form the heart of ‘Sinatra The Musical.'”\n\n\n\tTwo-time Tony winner Joe DiPietro (“Memphis the Musical,” “What’s New Pussycat?”) penned the book, while three-time Tony winner Kathleen Marshall (“Top Hat,” “Anything Goes”) directs and choreographs. Olivier Award winner Peter McKintosh (“Top Hat,” “When We Are Married”) designed the set, with a 17-piece orchestra supervised by Gareth Valentine (“My Fair Lady,” “42nd Street”).\n\n\t“When Tina Sinatra approached me about writing a show detailing the origins of her father’s genius, she gave me unprecedented access to her dad’s personal story,” says DiPietro. “Tina’s willingness to share the trials and triumphs of her father’s life has enabled Kathleen, myself and this remarkable team of theatre artists to create the most revealing portrait ever told about the legend that is Frank Sinatra.”\n\t\n\n\tMarshall, who recently joined the Theater Hall of Fame, says she is “beyond thrilled that we are bringing to the stage the extraordinary story of how Frank Sinatra’s incredible persistence in the face of adversity led to his becoming the astonishing artist that we all adore and admire.”\n\n\tThe creative team also includes Jon Morrell (costumes), Bruno Poet (lighting), Jonathan Deans (sound), Akhila Krishnan (video), Campbell Young Associates (wigs, hair and make-up), Larry Blank and John Clayton (orchestrations), Ian Eisendrath (arrangements), David Chase (dance arrangements), David Grindrod for Grindrod Burton Casting, Jim Carnahan (U.S. casting), and Carol Lee Meadows (associate choreographer).\n\n\tMichele Anthony and Bruce Resnikoff for Universal Music Group Theatrical present the production alongside Tina Sinatra and Charles Pignone for Frank Sinatra Enterprises, with executive producers Scott Landis and Chris Harper. Short Street Productions Ltd. serves as U.K. general management. Co-producers include Stephen Byrd, Richard Batchelder, Julie Boardman, Wendy Federman and Lisa Wolofsky, Simon Hunt, Willette and Manny Klausner, Victoria Lang, Larry Magid, Carl Moellenberg, Tom Perakos, Mark Rubinstein, and Ken and Janet Schur.\n\n\tThe production marks the first in a series of projects developed by Frank Sinatra Enterprises in partnership with Universal Music Group to introduce new audiences to Sinatra’s musical legacy.\n\n\tBooking is currently open through April 10, 2027.\n",

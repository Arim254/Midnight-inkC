    "body": "\n\tCANNES, France — “The future began 100 years ago,” proclaimed a three-minute clip shown at a Globo Showcase Cocktail on Sunday evening at Mipcom, chronicling the Brazilian communications giant’s evolution from newspaper, launched in 1925, to radio and Rede Globo TV network.\n\n\tThe welter of Globo international partnerships and deals confirmed on stage on Sunday at Cannes Carlton Hotel by Angela Colla, Globo Head of International Business and Co-productions, did much to suggest that for Globo the future is beginning again. \n\t\n\n\tA country the size of a continent, Brazil’s battle this century has been to reach out to the rest of the world and Globo’s challenge to consolidate the broadening of its portfolio from telenovelas –  while ensuring that they continue to travel – to other forms of entertainment and business models, joining the global mainstream. \n\n\n\tOne way to achieve that is format deals. “This year was key in marking our consolidation in the format sales business,” Colla said in Cannes. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Others\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: Paulo Belote\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn one unannounced pact, Globoplay has pacted with Anonymous Content for a U.S. version of “The Others,” Colla announced. Created by Lucas Paraizo (“Under Pressure”) and charting the current build of intolerance, he has told Variety, “The Others” is set in a gated community in Rio’s suburbs where a scuffle between two teens escalates into a bloody confrontation between their parents. The format has already sold to Germany (ndF) and Greece (produced by Primavisione, broadcast by Alpha).\n\n\tIn further deals unveiled by Colla, partnering with Turkey’s Ay Yapim, Globo has seen revenge saga “Leyla,” the Turkish adaptation of telenovela phenomenon “Brazil Avenue,” go global, selling to date to more than 20 countries. \n\t\n\n\tGlobo has sold the format for “All the Flowers,” about a visually impaired perfumer’s battle for freedom and love, to Greece’s  Primavisione and Alpha. It has also clinched a format deal with Portugal’s SIC broadcast network on “Pages of Life,” a 2006 modern classic telenovela from Manoel Carlos. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the Flowers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Globo\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGlobo’s Ron Leshem, Fox, BBC Studios Co-Productions\n\n\tAnother way to join the global conversation: international co-production with key “A” List creatives and companies. Announced just before the Showcase, via his prodco label Crossing Oceans, Ron Leshem, creator of the original “Euphoria,” will be joining forces with Koby Gal Raday and Ilda Santiago’s Janeiro Studios and Globoplay, the leading Brazilian streaming platform, to produce “Paranoia.” \n\n\tTo be co-developed by Leshem and Claudia Jouvin, who broke out this summer as head writer of Globoplay smash hit “Perfect Days,” “Paranoia” was described to Variety by its producers as “‘Black Swan’ and ‘Whiplash’ mixed with the feel-good vibes and payoffs of the ‘Queen’s Gambit’ and the generation-defining impact of ‘Euphoria.’”\n\n\tUnveiled on Saturday, Globo and Fox Entertainment Studios – the world’s leading producer of Christmas movies – announced they were partnering to develop and produce an original English-language Christmas movie set and filmed in Brazil. Aiming to ensure cultural authenticity, Globo will provide creative guidance to accurately reflect Brazilian culture and traditions, including the country’s unique celebration of Christmas, which takes place during Brazil’s summer.\n\n\tLate last week, BBC Studios and Brazilian Globo signed a landmark first co-production deal for a doc series that will “transport audiences to the heart” of Brazil’s sprawling Amazon rainforest.” The series, whose details are still being kept under wraps, will be produced by BBC Studios Specialist Factual Productions and Globo, with a story that innately comes from Brazil,” Janet Brown, president of Global Content Sales at BBC Studios, told Variety.\n\n\tAlex Medeiros, Globoplay Director of Drama, Documentaries and Films drilled down at the Showcase on other co-production arrangements: with Telemundo Studios, a first title to be announced shortly; with Beta Film, announced last year at Mipcom; with Fremantle on the series “Crime Inc,” and with Gaumont USA on “Deluxe,” about the rise and fall of Brazil’s high-fashion icon Eliana Tranchesi, which goes into production this week.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnything Goes\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNew Globo Shows Catch Fire\n\n\tIn straight sales, Globo has licensed to top Argentine network Telefe both “All the Flowers” and “Xuxa, the Documentary,” on Brazil’s biggest pop star.\n\n\tIts trailer shown at the Showcase, Globoplay’s latest release, series “Perfect Days” – a stylish but rapidly unsettling abduction thriller chosen by Variety among its Must-See TV titles for Mipcom – has become the most-watched original series on Globoplay of any nationality since its premiere in the Summer, Colla announced, calling the Anonymous Content Brazil production “a thrilling series which still has an impact on me” and which “shows a different side of our audiovisual work.”\n\n\tA second Mipcom title, “Anything Goes,” a plush, fast-paced remake of one of Brazil’s biggest telenovela 1980s hits, hit a 56% audience share at the moment of the murder of the arch villainess, while the production is Globo’s top-grossing primetime telenovela in Brazil, with 16 brands, including BYD, Corona, Uber, Amazon, Paramount, and L’Oréal, participating in 76 branded content actions. \n\n\t“We are storytellers, and our greatest triumph is our commitment to quality and to representing the best of our people — happiness, hard work, creativity, strength, and optimism, among other core values,” Colla said at the Mipcom Showcase. \n\n\t“We always tell stories in a responsible way, stories that move and connect with all kinds of audiences,” she added. “And diversity is not only within the content or genres, such as telenovelas, series, or documentaries, but also in the business models, including finished content, scripted formats, unscripted formats, and co-productions.”\n\n\tMore to come.\n",

    "body": "\n\t15 years after working on Christopher Nolan’s “Inception,” actor Elliot Page spoke about reuniting with the Oscar-winning director for his historical epic “The Odyssey,” set to release in theaters in July 2026.\n\n\t“I was so excited to be thought of for [‘The Odyssey’] and to be asked to come back to work with him,” said Page during the “X-Men: Days of Future Past” panel at this year’s New York City Comic Con. “I loved working with him on ‘Inception’ and loved being a part of that movie. I was just completely jazzed and excited, and [I] basically went and met with Chris and talked about the part, then sat in a room and read the script. It was such a joy to come back.”\n\t\n\n\t“To come back now, as you can imagine, being more comfortable in yourself makes these sorts of projects more enjoyable,” Page added. “To get to have a Chris Nolan experience again now meant so much to me selfishly.”\n\n\n\tThe “X-Men: Days of Future Past” panel was moderated by “Happy Sad Confused” podcast host Josh Horowitz. It also featured James McAvoy, who previously played the role of Charles Xavier from 2011 to 2019. When asked about the potential reboot of the franchise with fancasted actors such as Colman Domingo and Bella Ramsey, McAvoy spoke about his excitement for a return to the world of Charles Xavier with a new ensemble cast.\n\n\t“Look, I’m [just] excited to see what happens next,” said McAvoy. “I was a fan before I was an employee. and I’ll be a fan again. Colman Domingo sounds amazing.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a recent interview with Decider, Keira Knightley said that prior to joining the voice cast of Audible’s “Harry Potter: The Full Cast Audio Editions” as Professor Umbridge, she was “not aware” of the fan boycott of all things “Harry Potter” over J.K. Rowling‘s statements about the transgender community.\n\n\t“You know, I think we’re all living in a period of time right now where we’re all going to have to figure out how to live together, aren’t we?” Knightley said. “And we’ve all got very different opinions. I hope that we can all find respect.”\n\t\n\n\tBacklash toward Rowling started in 2020 after the author posted several tweets and a 3,600-word essay that many interpreted as transphobic. In the weeks following, “Harry Potter” stars Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint all posted statements on social media in defense of the trans community.\n\n\n\tWatson further elaborated on her relationship with Rowling during a recent episode of “On Purpose With Jay Shetty.” The host asked Watson for her thoughts on Rowling’s comments that she would “never forgive” Watson for her views and that the “Harry Potter” movies are now ruined because of Watson and her co-stars.\n\n\t“I really don’t believe that by having had that experience and holding the love and support and views that I have, mean that I can’t and don’t treasure Jo and the person that I had personal experiences with,” Watson said. “I will never believe that one negates the other and that my experience of that person, I don’t get to keep and cherish. To come back to our earlier thing — I just don’t think these things are either or. I think it’s my deepest wish that I hope people who don’t agree with my opinion will love me, and I hope I can keep loving people who I don’t necessarily share the same opinion with.”\n\t\n\n\tShortly after, Rowling took to X to slam Watson as “ignorant” and having “little experience of real life.” She wrote, “I’m not owed eternal agreement from any actor who once played a character I created. The idea is as ludicrous as me checking with the boss I had when I was 21 for what opinions I should hold these days. Emma Watson and her co-stars have every right to embrace gender identity ideology. Such beliefs are legally protected, and I wouldn’t want to see any of them threatened with loss of work, or violence, or death, because of them.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBanijay Kids & Family – behind hit shows “Totally Spies!” and “Mr Bean: The Animated Series” – has announced new distribution agreements for the latest installment of “Once Upon a Time…,” produced by Procidis.\n\n\tSeason 8, “Once Upon a Time… The Objects,” has been picked up by Puls 2’s Puls Kids in Poland, Turkuvaz Media Group’s children’s channel Minika GO in Turkey, TFO in Canada and Radio Television Hong Kong. \n\t\n\n\tThere’s more good news, however, as earlier seasons “continue to thrive” with AMC Networks International CNE acquiring Seasons 3 and 7 (“Life,” “Planet Earth”) for multiple Eastern European territories, and SF Studios picking up Season 3 (“Life”) for Norway and Sweden.\n\n\n\tDescribed as an “iconic edutainment franchise,” the “Once Upon a Time…” saga was originally created by Albert Barillé in 1978 and has broadcast continuously in France for nearly 50 years.\n\n\t“Its continued journey across borders, and into new territories, demonstrates its sustained relevance and appeal on a global scale,” noted Cécile Cau, SVP Sales, Co-productions and Acquisitions at Banijay Kids & Family. \n\n\t“The franchise has an enduring legacy and educational value which stays with viewers for life, sparking curiosity in childhood and continuing to resonate with fans well into adulthood.”\n\n\tBenoît Di Sabatino, CEO of Banijay Kids & Family and President of Procidis, told Variety: “At the time it was created, ‘Once Upon a Time…’ was revolutionary. Albert Barillé created a unique visual and narrative language that spoke to children and parents alike.”\n\t\n\n\tIts longevity is rooted in its ability to “blend storytelling with education in a way that’s both engaging and timeless,” he argued, “making knowledge accessible, playful and universal.” \n\n\t“The franchise has always sparked curiosity in children that leaves a lasting impression into adulthood. What’s kept it alive is its adaptability, with each new season tackling fresh themes that resonate with contemporary audiences. Every episode is driven by curiosity, pedagogy, and a genuine kindness toward the audience.”\n\n\tIt’s not the end of the decades-spanning story, however. \n\n\t“The continued success of ‘Once Upon a Time…’ across new territories and platforms shows there’s still a strong appetite for thoughtful, educational content. With Helene Barillé, we have bold plans to grow and evolve the brand for a new generation. We’re continuing to keep building on its legacy and introduce it to new generations around the world, both through content and beyond with a growing portfolio of experiences and products.”\n\n\tWhile every season has a different focus, “The Objects” takes a fresh look at the everyday items that shape our world. \n\n\t“It’s a clever way to teach children about science, history and culture through objects they encounter daily. Buyers have responded enthusiastically because the show is accessible and universal, and they value content that smartly combines education and entertainment,” assured Di Sabatino. Arguing that the magic of the franchise likes in its storytelling. \n\n\t“It doesn’t preach. It entertains. It invites understanding rather than memorization. Humor, poetry and iconic characters make knowledge come alive.”\n\n\tHe added: “It has always respected its audience’s intelligence and is a trusted source of knowledge, which captures children’s imaginations. That balance of emotion, narrative and scientific accuracy is what makes it such a timeless model of ‘edutainment,’ long before the term even existed.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Once Upon a Time…’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Banijay Kids & Family\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tCANNES, France  — In what looks like one of the banner early deals unveiled at this year’s Mipcom convention in Cannes, via his prodco label Crossing Oceans, Ron Leshem, creator of the original “Euphoria,” will be joining forces with Koby Gal Raday and Ilda Santiago’s Janeiro Studios and Globoplay, the leading Brazilian streaming platform, to produce “Paranoia.\n\n\t“Paranoia” is a 8×45 minutes returning series, a production of Janeiro Studios and Crossing Oceans, Leshem’s joint drama label with his long-time partner Amit Cohen, and under the stewardship of producer-writer Daniel Amsel, who was also behind the original Israeli “Euphoria,” created by Leshem. It is co-produced with Globoplay and additional partners, to be announced in coming months.\n\t\n\n\tJaneiro Studios’ launch was announced in June 2024, as well as its focus on premium scripted series and feature films from Brazil and Latin America and international high-end projects from A-list talents.\n\n\n\tTo shoot in Portuguese and entirely in Rio de Janeiro, “Paranoia” is also created by Leshem, who has carved out a preeminent position on the international TV scene over the last 20 years, making series which combine the market-friendly tensions of thriller and a multi-layered thoughtfulness. \n\n\tThis ranges from drawing a defining portrait of contemporary youth in the original Israeli “Euphoria” (2012) or depicting a man’s search for his sister and own self-worth in a war-torn Syria (“No Man’s Land,” 2020) or exposing the tragedy of the Israel-Palestine conflict (“Red Skies,” 2023). The compelling results have streamed on HBO Max (Valley of Tears”), Hulu (“No Man’s Land) and Netflix (“Bad Boy,” 2025).\n\t\n\n\tIn a unique move for Leshem, however – which embodies Janeiro Studios’ vision of connecting Brazilian talent with global A-list creatives – Leshem will now travel to Brazil to develop “Paranoia” with scribe Claudia Jouvin. Writing 13 episodes of “Under Pressure,” one of the most acclaimed of modern-day Brazilian series, Jouvin has really drawn heat, however, as head writer on “Perfect Days,” a stylish and rapidly unsettling sexual abuse drama, plumbing pathological male narcissism, which bowed this summer to large critical plaudits – “an achievement, Brazilian impact psychological suspense,” said newspaper Folha de Pernambuco – and ratings which made “Perfect Days” Globoplay’s most-watched original series since the service’s launch.\n\n\t“‘Paranoia’s’ unique story concept is described by its producers as “‘Black Swan’ and ‘Whiplash’ mixed with the feel-good vibes and payoffs of the ‘Queen’s Gambit’ and the generation-defining impact of ‘Euphoria,’ bringing to screen unsung characters from all around Brazil, taking place in a contemporary and vibrant Rio de Janeiro, exposed as never seen before.”\n\n\tLeshem and Jouvin, now series head writers, will collaborate with new emerging Brazilian talent to deliver a new portrayal of Gen-Z, a generation confronted with unique and unprecedented challenges such as deep fake and AI’s stronghold of virtual realities, loss of privacy, mental health in a post pandemic world, lack of financial education, and much more, they added. \n\n\t“Paranoia” is produced by Koby Gal Raday, Ilda Santiago, Ron Leshem, Amit Cohen and Mayra Faour Auad.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKoby Gal Raday, Ron Leshem, Claudia Jouvin, Alex Medeiros\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredits: Philipp Lavra, Lena Nugent, Jorge Bispo, Globo / Beatriz Damy\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLeshem, Gal Raday, Globoplay’s Alex Medeiros on ‘Paranoia’ \n\n\t“Brazil and Brazilian cinema have influenced me throughout my professional career and always felt like a real cultural home,”said Leshem. “This collaboration with Globoplay, inspired creative dialogue and partnerships we’ve created in the past few months and plan for the near future, feels like an exciting journey I’m thrilled to take. I share Janeiro Studios’ vision and happy to embark on this exciting path with the talented Claudia Jouvin. Together we plan to immerse audiences in Brazil and around the world to explore the complex world of current Gen-Z.”\n\t\n\n\t“We are delighted to announce our first collaboration with Ron Leshem and Claudia Jouvin to produce ‘Paranoia,’ our inaugural premium production. This series embodies the DNA of Janeiro Studios, seamlessly bridging the gap between renowned international talent and Brazilian A-list filmmakers,” added Gal Raday, Janeiro Studios CEO. “‘Paranoia’ will push the envelope of high-end drama through innovative storytelling and an ambitious scale. Globoplay is the ideal home for this unique series, celebrating Rio de Janeiro and connecting audiences from diverse backgrounds. In collaboration with Globoplay’s esteemed executives Manuel Belmar, Tatiana Costa and Alex Medeiros, we are proud to deliver this series to Brazilian audiences and the global market.”   \n\n\t“The partnership with Janeiro Studios and the creative collaboration between Ron Leshem and Claudia Jouvin reflect our commitment to telling innovative stories that resonate with new generations,” added Alex Medeiros, Head of Drama & Film of digital products at Globoplay. “As the largest producer of Portuguese-language audiovisual content in the world, Globoplay actively seeks strategic partnerships with key players to expand the reach of our narratives. Co-production is a model that strengthens our portfolio in Brazil while connecting us with new global audiences. We are excited to co-produce this project and share our Brazilianess with the world,” he added.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney’s sci-fi sequel “Tron: Ares” failed to connect in its box office debut, collecting a disappointing $33.5 million from 4,000 North American theaters over the weekend.\n\n\tIt’s a weak start, even for a five-decade-old franchise that’s never been a commercial juggernaut. The trouble is that “Tron: Are” carries a massive $180 million price tag, not including the many millions the studio spent on marketing. Overseas, “Tron: Ares” didn’t make up much ground, adding another $27 million and putting the final global number at $60 million through Sunday.\n\t\n\n\tHeading into the weekend, “Tron: Ares” was targeting a decent domestic debut of $45 million to $50 million. A visual spectacle with neon-hued action, the PG-13 film was popular on premium large formats, with Imax, Dolby and 3D screens accounting for 67% of ticket sales.\n\n\n\tDespite a “B+” grade on CinemaScore exit polls, suggesting audiences mostly liked the film, the futuristic adventure couldn’t expand its audience beyond its target demographic of boys and men. (Nearly 70% of opening weekend crowds were male.) As a result, the final weekend tally didn’t come close to matching the prior installment, 2010’s “Tron: Legacy,” which opened to $44 million, not adjusted for inflation. Ticket sales were, at least, way above the original 1982 “Tron,” which launched with $4.7 million on its way to cult status. Jared Leto, Greta Lee and Evan Peters star in the newest installment, which was directed by “Pirates of the Caribbean” alum Joachim Rønning and topically follows humanity’s first contact with artificial intelligence as an advanced program enters the physical world.\n\t\n\n\t“The movie was tracking well, but interest stalled during the last 10 days and the opening dropped,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. However, he adds, “the science fiction genre has always done well overseas. This is effects-driven, good-guys-versus-bad-guys storytelling that’s understood and well-liked across all cultures.” \n\n\tIt was a dispiriting weekend at the box office as two fellow newcomers — Channing Tatum’s dramedy “Roofman” and Jennifer Lopez’s musical “Kiss of the Spider Woman” — also struggled to pack in crowds. Without a major blockbuster in October to boost grosses, overall domestic ticket sales are just 4% ahead of 2024, according to Comscore.\n\n\tIn second place, “Roofman” arrived on the lower end of expectations with $8 million from 3,340 locations in its opening weekend. “Kiss of the Spider Woman” bowed far below projections at No. 13 with a paltry $840,000 from 1,300 screens. “Roofman” was aiming for $8 million to $12 million, while “Kiss of the Spider Woman” was targeting $1.5 million to $3 million.\n\n\tIn the case of “Roofman,” a start below $8 million is hardly electrifying for something starring Tatum. However the film cost just $19 million to produce, so not much of a financial risk. Paramount distributed “Roofman,” which was developed, financed and produced by Miramax. Derek Cianfrance directed the true story of a former soldier and professional thief who escapes from prison and finds a hideout in a Toys “R” Us. Reviews and word-of-mouth (the film earned a “B+” grade on CinemaScore exit polls and holds an 85% on Rotten Tomatoes) could help “Roofman” stick around beyond its opening weekend.\n\n\t“Kiss of the Spider Woman” was independently financed for $34 million before it was acquired by Roadside Attractions and Lionsgate for an unspecified sum after its Sundance debut, making it unclear who will shoulder the theatrical losses. Bill Condon directed the remake, which takes place mostly in an Argentinian prison and follows a queer window dresser who dreams up vivid stories of his favorite screen diva (portrayed by Lopez) to escape the horrors of his imprisonment. This is the second film version of “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” following the acclaimed 1985 feature from director Héctor Babenco, which grossed $17 million globally. Even without adjusting for inflation over the past 40 years, the new take on “Spider Woman” might struggle to match those sales.\n\t\n\n\tAt No. 6, Sony’s faith-based “Soul on Fire” debuted to $3 million from 1,720 theaters. The inspirational story, about a man who survived fire burns that covered his body, has resonated with moviegoers, evidenced by the “A” grade on CinemaScore.\n\n\tHoldover titles otherwise rounded out the top of the box office charts. Third place went to Leonardo DiCaprio’s comedic action epic “One Battle After Another” with $6.7 million from 3,127 theaters, declining 38% from the prior weekend. So far, the film has earned $54.5 million in North America and $138 million globally. Since “One Battle” cost above $130 million to produce, the film needs substantial staying power to justify its outsized budget. Ticket sales are typically split 50-50 between studios and theater operators, so “One Battle After Another” requires roughly $300 million to break even theatrically.\n\n\tIn eighth place, Dwayne Johnson’s R-rated sports drama “The Smashing Machine” cratered by 70% in its second weekend with $1.7 million from 3,321 venues. The film, which cost $50 million, has grossed $10.1 million to date and is shaping up to be a major money loser for A24. \n\n\tIn limited release, director Luca Guadagnino’s #MeToo thriller “After the Hunt” earned $154,467 from six screens, translating to $25,745 per location. Julia Roberts, Ayo Edebiri and Andrew Garfield star in the film about a college professor (Roberts) who finds herself at a personal and professional crossroads when her mentee (Edebiri) accuses a friend and colleague (Garfield) of crossing a line. The true test of the film’s commercial viability will come when Amazon MGM expands “After the Hunt” nationwide next weekend.\n\n\tAnother specialty title, A24’s psychological drama “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” earned $89,164 on four locations in New York and Los Angeles over the weekend, averaging $22,291 per screen. Rose Byrne stars in the well-reviewed film as a new mother whose life starts to fall apart.\n\n\t“After a good September, the last few weeks have under-performed,” Gross says. “Momentum changes quickly at the box office, and it has.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tYouTube stars “The McCartys” are expanding their universe. \n\n\tApart from the Spooky Special, their first live interactive show – “which illustrated their ability to do a half-hour episode,” said Catherine Winder (Wind Sun Sky) – an animated series and unscripted competition series with Kevin Healey as host are already being developed, they revealed at industry event Mipcom in France.\n\n\n\t“We are looking for really innovative ways to expand the brand,” said Viral Nation’s Paul Telner.\n\t\n\n\t“There’s really nothing like them on YouTube. They really cornered this sort of scary, Halloween content.” An e-commerce site has also been set up, all within the same “cohesive” universe of Camp McCarthy, said Stephanie McCarthy. \n\n\tThe family also looked back on their beginnings. \n\n\t“Before all this started, I was a high school history teacher. I had no ambitions or desire to do what I’m doing today. I didn’t know it existed!,” admitted Kevin McCarthy. COVID pandemic changed everything. \n\n\t“Stephanie was working in the healthcare industry, she was out of the house and I was stuck with a four-year-old and a six-month-old. Just to keep our sanity, we started making goofy videos and those videos started to become popular. We grew and grew on TikTok, but we knew that YouTube was the place to be.” \n\n\tUltimately, he decided to focus on their channel full time. \n\n\t“I had 8,000 subscribers on YouTube. That was back in 2022. Today, we’re at 16.1 million subscribers and over 22 billion views,” he said, with Telner calling “The McCartys” “one of the fastest rises in social media history.”\n\t\n\n\t“I started watching [them] and went: This is some of the quirkiest, funniest, weirdest stuff I’ve seen on YouTube and socials in years. They run the channel with their kids and it has storytelling at the center of it. It’s not an influencer channel. It’s got a narrative and the characters, which is so much closer to traditional production considerations.”\n\n\tWinder also appreciated their creativity and “amazing storytelling foundation.” \n\n\t“It’s kooky. It’s spooky. I thought: This is like ‘The Addams Family’ meets ‘Beetlejuice’. We were looking forward to something new and fresh for the animation space. It was a no-brainer to get into business with them,” she admitted. Also because they were willing to work in “out-of-the-box ways.” \n\n\t“It used to be very difficult to bring a property like this and say: ‘Okay, let’s start producing animated series.’ We needed to find ways to test and learn, and create an undeniable package so that when we bring in our partners and financiers, we’re in a position where you can remain in control of what you’re doing.” \n\n\tAs pointed out by Stephanie McCarthy, their established fanbase came in handy. \n\n\t“One of the great things about social media is you get all of that data in real time. We don’t have to sit around and wait – it’s immediate. We can base what we’re doing on that feedback. Animated characters also won’t be no strangers to fans.\n\n\t“They are in my live-action videos. You get to see them on a daily basis and they already have their own established fanbase,” said Kevin McCarthy. That includes Jingle Jangle the clown.  \n\n\t“I was lucky to go out to Vancouver to Catherine’s studio, get into the mo-cap suit and animate Jingle Jangle. We really wanted to prove that this works. Last year, we posted videos with animated Jingle Jangle and animated Audrey within our live-action feed. They’ve gotten just under 200 million views and we’ve gained over 3.3 million subscribers just from these videos alone.”\n\n\tAs argued by Stephanie McCarthy – also known as Demon Mom – while their content is “popular in the kids’ space,” it’s really “all-ages.”\n\n\t“Kevin is not necessarily writing for kids. He’s writing what he finds funny. Kids tend to gravitate towards it, but it’s complete co-viewing. It’s relatable,” she pointed out, with her husband adding some trivia.\n\t\n\n\t“The reason [for Demon Mom] was that it was mostly a daddy-daughter thing, occasionally with my son, and then the audience kept asking: ‘Where’s the mom?’ They even thought she was dead! We’re twisted, we’re weird, we’re funny. I said: ‘Why not make her a demon?’ It exploded and she got millions of views.”\n\n\tAs the family was already a “human cartoon,” he argued, extending the universe felt natural. \n\n\t“It’s such a seamless fit for our type of content. At a certain point, you reach a point where you’ve cornered that market. That’s exactly what Stephanie and I have done on YouTube and other platforms. We want an animated series because I can only throw my son so far in the sky in the videos – why not throw him into outer space as a cartoon?” \n\n\t“These days, we are in the business of long-term careers. The McCarthys are in this forever, and we are helping them build their business,” said Telner, with Winder adding: “That’s where animation comes in – it’s timeless and crosses global borders. It’s an incredible way for these guys to stay in it for the long haul.”\n\n\t“We’re building a massive brand.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe world of “Avatar: The Last Airbender” is expanding with a new fighting video game and animated YouTube series, it was announced at New York Comic Con on Sunday.\n\n\tThe beloved Nickelodeon animated series celebrated its 20th anniversary at New York Comic Con with a panel that featured original cast members Zach Tyler Eisen (Aang), Jack De Sena (Sokka), Michaela Jill Murphy (Toph), Dante Basco (Zuko), Mae Whitman (Katara), co-creator Bryan Konietzko and moderator Janet Varney (Korra).\n\t\n\n\tA one-on-one fighting video game was revealed at the panel, under the working title of “Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game.” The lineup of characters includes Aang, Katara, Sokka, Zuko, Azula, Toph and Korra hand drawn in 2D animation. The fighting shows Aang using his airbending, while also entering the Avatar State for some powerful moves; Zuko firebending and donning his Blue Spirit mask and swords; Korra using all four elements and also using the Avatar State; and much more elemental fighting. It will release on consoles in the summer of 2026.\n\n\n\tA chibi-style, 2D animated series of short videos also debuted, which will be available to watch on YouTube. The shorts will reimagine classic scenes from the original “Avatar” series, the comics and offer original stories. One of the videos adorably parodies the premiere episode with Katar and Sokka discovering Aang and battling Zuko and the Fire Nation.\n\n\tNext up from the “Avatar” universe is a sequel series, titled “Avatar: Seven Havens,” that follows the Avatar after Korra. There’s also the feature film, “The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender,” set for theatrical release on Oct. 9, 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKen Aymong, one of a handful of key lieutenants to executive producer Lorne Michaels at NBC‘s “Saturday Night Live,” made surprise cameos on the program’s latest two episodes — in the credits.\n\n\tAymong, who retired from “SNL” in 2021 after joining the venerable program in the mid-1980’s, has returned to the show as a supervising producer for the show’s current 51st season, according to a person familiar with the matter. His name scrolled by during the show’s credits early Sunday morning as it closed out its second episode, and last week as well. Details on what spurred him to return to the fold could not immediately be learned, but Aymong had been brought back to help out with some of the landmark events in “SNL“‘s 50th season, which included a massive concert at Radio City Music Hall.\n\t\n\n\tAymong has long been known not for booking guest hosts or writing celebrated sketches, but for something perhaps more important: maintaining the business of the TV institution. ““I always look at the financial perspective of the show,” Aymong said in “Live From New York,” an oral history of the program by Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller. “I want it to go on forever.”\n\n\n\tNBC declined to make producers available for comment. LateNighter previously reported on Aymong’s return to “SNL.”\n\n\tAymong’s return comes as “SNL” has been giving new duties to some of Michaels’ top deputies. Erin Doyle, a longtime producer, was elevated at the start of the season to the top echelon of senior staff. Erik Kenward, another member of that circle, has taken on head-writer duties this season with a band of other “SNL” veterans. Michaels, who turned 80 in November of last year, has given no signal that he wants to step back from the show he has managed and influenced for nearly half a century, but has given some indications that others will take up day-to-day duties he might once have done himself.\n\t\n\n\tMichaels has developed a coterie of key aides over the years. In addition to Aymong, Doyle and Kenward, they also include Steve Higgins, another top producer who also works on NBC’s “Tonight Show” and Mike Shoemaker, a former “SNL” producer who currently runs “Late Night with Seth Meyers” behind the scenes. Others in the past have included Lindsay Shookus and Marci Klein, both of whom are no longer with the show. Aymong’s duties aren’t the glitziest, but are quite crucial as “SNL” manages its production budget for special effects, set design, and many other elements that help the show stand up under intense linear, streaming and social-media scrutiny week after week.\n",

    "body": "\n\tScience Saru will return with a third season of “Dan Da Dan” airing in 2027, the studio revealed during Jump Festa 2026 on Dec. 21, revealing a new key visual for the supernatural comedy series.\n\n\tThe anime’s debut season aired from October to December 2024, and its second season from July to September 2025. The series adapts Yukinobu Tatsu’s manga, which has sold over 12 million copies and continues serialization every Tuesday on Shueisha’s manga magazine app Shonen Jump+.\n\t\n\n\t“Dan Da Dan” centers on Momo (voiced by Shion Wakayama), a high school girl from a family of spiritual mediums, and her classmate Okarun (voiced by Natsuki Hanae), an occult enthusiast. After Momo saves Okarun from bullies, an argument erupts between the ghost-believing Momo and the alien-believing Okarun. To settle their debate, Momo visits an abandoned hospital UFO hotspot while Okarun explores a haunted tunnel, where both encounter unexpected creatures. Momo awakens hidden spiritual powers while Okarun gains curse abilities, launching them into paranormal battles and a potential romance.\n\n\n\tMainichi Broadcasting System (MBS) co-produces the series. The Osaka-based broadcaster has been involved in anime production for over 50 years, including franchises such as “Attack on Titan,” “Full Metal Alchemist,” “Jujutsu Kaisen” and the influential film “Akira.”\n\n\tScience Saru has produced television, film and streaming projects including “Lu Over the Wall,” “Devilman crybaby,” “Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!,” “Inu-Oh” and “The Colors Within.” The studio’s upcoming releases include TV anime series “The Ghost in the Shell” and “Jaadugar: A Witch in Mongolia,” both planned for broadcast in 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBowen Yang said goodbye to “Saturday Night Live” with the final sketch of the night, which was also his last.\n\n\tNews broke on Friday that Saturday’s episode would be Yang’s final appearance as part of the “SNL” cast after being on the show for eight seasons. He first joined “Saturday Night Live” as a writer in 2018 in Season 44 and later was added to the cast as a featured player in Season 45. He was upped to be a main cast member in Season 47. \n\t\n\n\tIn the sketch, Yang played a flight attendant with a broken eggnog machine at the Delta One lounge who was leaving for his final shift.\n\n\n\t“This is my last shift. It’s sad. I’m gonna miss everything about this place. The way it smells. The celebrities who come through. Just last week, Josh O’Connor came through,” Yang said, referring to last week’s “SNL” host.\n\n\tTonight’s host Ariana Grande, who co-starred with Yang in the “Wicked” movies, also appeared and said goodbye to her friend. Playing a family member of Yang’s character, Grande said, “I wish you were home but I’m so proud of you and all the eggnog you’ve made over the years. Some of it was great, some of it was rotten.”\n\n\t“And a lot of it got cut,” Yang added. “But you know, I also think eggnog’s kinda like me. It’s not for everyone, but the people who like it are my kinda people.” The two sang a song together and were joined by musical guest Cher (who played the eggnog maker’s boss) on stage, and Yang teared up saying goodbye.\n\n\t“Oh, Rhonda, I should have come home earlier,” he said while choking up. “I just feel so lucky that I ever got to work here. And I just wanted to enjoy it for a little bit longer. Especially the people. I’ve loved every single person who works here. Because they’ve done so much for me, especially my boss.”\n\t\n\n\tDuring the final goodnights to close out the show, Grande gave a special shoutout to Yang: “And Bowen yang, we love you so much! Goodnight!”\n\n\tYang’s mid-season departure comes after several cast members left before Season 51 began, including Ego Nwodim, Heidi Gardner, Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker, Emil Wakim and John Higgins. Leaving in the middle of a season is rare but not unheard of — Cecily Strong, Molly Shannon and Dana Carvey did it in the past.\n\n\tOutside of “Saturday Night Live,” Yang hosts the pop culture podcast “Las Culturistas” with fellow comedian Matt Rogers. For the first time, the two hosted their yearly Las Culturistas Awards as a full awards show broadcast on Bravo and Peacock. Yang also reprised his “Wicked” role as Pfannee in this fall’s hit “Wicked: For Good” musical. He and Rogers are also writing and starring in an upcoming comedy for Searchlight Pictures.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” stars Colin Jost and Michael Che continued their yearly Christmas tradition of writing horribly offensive jokes for the other person to tell on Weekend Update. Except this year, Che lied to Jost that they weren’t doing their annual swap but still prepared his own — so Jost was the only one reading out jokes, much to Che and the audience’s delight.\n\n\tChe did not hold back for Jost once again, one year after he made his co-host tell some harsh jokes about Jost’s wife Scarlett Johansson, who was backstage watching.\n\t\n\n\t“Critics say a new series of coins from the U.S. Mint celebrating great moments in the country’s history ignore civil rights. But what about the coin that celebrates where Black people actually come from — ships,” Jost began reading reluctantly as Che laughed at his joke.\n\n\n\tJost continued: “The archdiocese of New York will set up a fund for victims of church sexual abuse. Yet I get nothing for keeping my mouth shut and taking it like a champ?” The audience gasped and laughed as Jost read his final prepared joke, while Che said Jost should’ve written some for him.\n\n\t“New research shows that millions of women leave the work force due to menopause. Which means there’s only a couple years left on my gravy train,” a photo of Johansson flashed on the screen as Jost grimaced. “My girl already be like, ‘Colin, I’m warm. Colin, I’m sweating.’ Bitch, you having a hot flash.”\n\n\t“But don’t worry about me, I got a backup. They don’t call Wednesday hump day for nothing,” Jost finished, as a photo of Jenna Ortega’s Netflix character Wednesday Addams popped on screen.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKate Winslet is opening up about the challenges she faced while making her directorial debut, “Goodbye June.”\n\n\tWritten by her son, Joe Anders, the actress revealed that she only planned to star and produce the film. When she was also offered the opportunity to direct the feature, Winslet said that her initial thought was that she “cannot do three jobs.”\n\n\t“I know I’m good at multitasking, but this is too many things,” Winslet told Digi Spy. “I desperately tried to recast myself [and] had a really good list of a handful of people who would have been absolutely brilliant in that role.”\n\t\n\n\tShe continued, “But at that point… well, first of all, Netflix was like, ‘Uh-uh,’ and secondly, I’d cast all these incredible actors. How could I not go and play with them? Because that’s what we do. We play, we pretend, and it’s an amazing thing.”\n\n\n\tNow playing in select theaters, “Goodbye June” follows four adult siblings and their father as they navigate their family dynamic as their sick mother’s health takes a turn for the worse. Winslet stars as Julia, one of June’s children, with Helen Mirren playing June, the matriarch of the family.\n\n\t“I know it sounds a bit sickly, but we had to really become a family in order to make it feel as real as possible and as relatable as possible,” Winslet added. “You can’t just show up and do the job and go home again; it becomes something else. We were lucky on this film that that really happened.”\n\n\tIn addition to Winslet and Mirren, “Goodbye June” stars Toni Collette, Johnny Flynn, Andrea Riseborough and Timothy Spall. Additional cast members include Stephen Merchant, Fisayo Akinade, Jeremy Swift and Raza Jaffrey.\n\t\n\n\tAfter its theatrical run, the film will arrive on Netflix on Dec. 24.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe filmmakers behind Yash‘s highly anticipated “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” have revealed the first look at Kiara Advani‘s character Nadia, offering a glimpse into what promises to be a transformative role for the actor.\n\n\tThe poster presents Advani set against a circus backdrop, balancing glamorous aesthetics with underlying emotional depth that suggests grief and melancholy beneath the surface spectacle. The character appears poised to showcase a different dimension of Advani’s range as she enters the distinctive cinematic world.\n\t\n\n\tAdvani has established herself as one of Hindi cinema’s most bankable stars following breakthrough performances in the romantic drama “Kabir Singh” and the biographical war film “Shershaah.” Her recent slate includes “Game Changer” and “War 2.”\n\n\n\tYash, the Kannada-language film industry actor who rose to pan-Indian stardom with the “K.G.F” franchise, has become one of the most sought-after stars in Indian cinema. Known for his portrayal of Rocky Bhai in “K.G.F: Chapter 1” (2018) and “K.G.F: Chapter 2” (2022) Yash’s transformation into a larger-than-life action hero propelled the films to unprecedented box-office success, breaking language barriers. The second instalment in the franchise is the fifth highest Indian grosser of all time. While the “K.G.F” series cemented his star power, Yash’s early career in Kannada-language films showcased his versatility, with notable performances in projects such as “Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari” (2014) and “Googly” (2013).\n\n\t“Toxic” is helmed by festival circuit darling Geetu Mohandas (“Moothon”). The ambitious project represents a watershed moment for Kannada cinema, which has been steadily gaining international traction following the “K.G.F” phenomenon. Written by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic” is breaking new ground as the first major Indian film conceptualized, written and shot simultaneously in both the Kannada and English languages – with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\t\n\n\t“Some performances don’t just belong to a film they redefine an artist,” said Mohandas. “What Kiara created on screen in this film is nothing short of transformative. From our very first conversation, she placed an unwavering trust in a character that demanded everything from her – be it emotionally, mentally, and artistically. She didn’t just play the role, she lived it. As a director, I am deeply proud of her and for the performance she has delivered, and for the faith and heart she brought into our shared journey.”\n\n\tThe reveal arrives as Yash prepares for his first screen appearance since “K.G.F: Chapter 2” redefined box office benchmarks four years ago. The announcement coincides with the seventh anniversary of the original “K.G.F,” which launched the phenomenon that would culminate in the sequel’s historic performance.\n\n\tThe production has assembled a notable technical crew including Indian National Film Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer T.P. Abid. Action sequences have been choreographed by Hollywood’s J.J. Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside Indian National Film Award-winning duo Anbariv.\n\n\tProduced by Venkat K. Narayana and Yash through KVN Productions and Monster Mind Creations, “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” is scheduled for theatrical release March 19, 2026, capitalizing on the extended holiday weekend that encompasses Eid, Ugadi and Gudi Padwa celebrations.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAriana Grande belted out her own rendition of Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” during her “Saturday Night Live” monologue about the difficulties of of buying presents for acquaintances and friends of friends, titled “What Do I Get for Christmas for This Dude?”\n\n\tSaturday marked the Christmas episode of this “Saturday Night Live” Season 51, with Grande as host and Cher as her musical guest. It also was cast member Bowen Yang’s final episode, as news broke Friday that he would be exiting the show. Yang, who appeared with Grande in “Wicked” and this year’s “Wicked: For Good,” joined her on stage for her spoof of Carey’s song.\n\t\n\n\t“December is my favorite time of year in New York,” Grande began. “I love the decorations, the snow on the ground. I love shopping for all my loved ones. But I have to admit, I get a little stressed shopping for certain other people in my life.”\n\n\n\tThe “Saturday Night Live” audience cheered when they realized Grande was doing her own take on “All I Want for Christmas Is You”\n\n\n\t“I don’t know what to get for Christmas for my cousin’s boyfriend Steve,” she sang to Carey’s tune. “I don’t know a thing about him, only see him on Christmas Eve.”\n\n\tShe also poked fun at her seemingly non-stop press tour for “Wicked: For Good,” joking that her director Jon M. Chu wouldn’t give her any bathroom breaks.\n\n\t“Haven’t shopped a lot for Christmas, ‘cuz my schedule’s never free,” she sang. “Had so much press for ‘Wicked,’ Jon Chu will not let me pee.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen Yang joined her on stage, Grande teased that he had very few lines in “Wicked”: “Can I just say how much I loved your line in ‘Wicked’?”\n\n\t“Thank you,” he said, to which Grande replied “you’re welcome!”\n\n\t“No,” Yang clarified. “That was my line.”\n\n\tSaturday’s episode marked Grande’s third time hosting “SNL,” one of which she doubled as the musical guest. She’s also performed solely as the musical guest twice.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe first “Saturday Night Live” episode of 2026 will be hosted by Finn Wolfhard, with musical guest A$AP Rocky.\n\n\tThe episode, which premieres on Jan. 17, comes weeks after the series finale of Wolfhard’s series “Stranger Things.” Meanwhile, Rocky will be performing music from his upcoming album “Don’t Be Dumb,” which is set to drop on Jan. 16.\n\n\tAlthough the final episode of Netflix’s blockbuster “Stranger Things” is set to debut on Dec. 31, Wolfhard told Variety that he’s never really going to leave the show behind. \n\t\n\n\t“The way for me to sort of advance in my life and my career is not to try to replace the show. It’s to try to really embrace it,” he said in the interview. “Because to fight it would be the wrong thing to do, because then you’re forgetting where everything started.”\n\n\n\tRocky spoke with Variety about the early “Don’t Be Dumb” single “Highjack,” which features singer-songwriter Jessica Pratt.\n\n\t“I like to do things that don’t make sense,” he said in the interview. “Nobody would have thought to put [folk musician] Jessica Pratt on that, but I think her voice is so angelic. She literally let me write the whole thing, and she just sang it beautifully. She makes me want to be like a secret songwriter; I should probably get into writing folk songs. She’s sick.”\n\n\tThe announcement was made during the Dec. 20 episode of “Saturday Night Live,” which was hosted by Ariana Grande with musical guest Cher. The episode was also the final show for Bowen Yang, who confirmed his departure earlier that day.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSydney Sweeney was familiar with “The Housemaid” novel when she landed a starring role in Paul Feig’s movie adaptation.\n\n\t“I was juicy, it was delicious,” she told me at the film’s Los Angeles premiere on Monday. “I could not put the book down. I remember I opened it, and you know when you’re like, ‘I’m going to open this, read a couple of chapters and then go do something else,’ I did not move from my seat the moment I opened it until I finished. It was just so good. The characters, the twists, the turns, all of it, so I knew I really wanted to be a part of.”\n\t\n\n\tSweeney stars in the erotic thriller as a woman with a dark past who is hired as the live-in maid for a wealthy couple, played by Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar.\n\n\n\tThere’s already talk of a sequel. “We want to be able to give the people what they want,” Sweeney said. “This is such an amazing community of book lovers, and we would love to do another film.”\n\n\tFeig said, “Let’s just hope this one does well because we’re ready to do another one.”\n\n\tSweeney was attached to the project when Feig signed on to direct.\n\n\t “It was amazing,” Feig said of working with the “Euphoria” star. “She’s so lovely and so easy to work with, and the most professional person I have ever met. She shows up on set and is ready to go, and is prepared, and brings such an extra level to everything she does. She’s one of my heroes, I’ll tell ya.”\n\n\n\tSeyfried talked about her first day working with Sweeney. “We were doing one of those light camera tests, and we realized right away that we’re the same shoe size and the exact same height, and we thought that was really interesting. And I think it was just the fact that we were so in love with the book, and we couldn’t believe we were actually making this movie, that we related right away. Also, we have the same process. She doesn’t take herself too seriously, and neither do I. I think that’s where the fun comes in.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Housemaid” is in theaters now.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDave Chappelle went after Bill Maher in his new Netflix special, “The Unstoppable,” for criticizing his appearance at Saudi Arabia’s Riyadh Comedy Festival.\n\n\t“Recently in the news, I’ve been getting a lot of grief, again, because I did a comedy festival in Saudi Arabia,” Chappelle said to applause. “And you hear those cheers? That’s Black people. America’s whites, they’re furious. Boy, I gotta tell you something. I’ve never not felt guilty about something. I don’t feel guilty at all. And Bill Maher, the famous comedian, I’ve known Bill since I was like, 18, 19 years old, and I’ve never said this publicly, but fuck that guy. I’m so fucking tired of his little smug, cracker-ass commentary.”\n\t\n\n\tMaher was largely positive about the Riyadh Festival, calling the participating comedians “brave” for breaking ground in a nation that hasn’t always been welcoming for stand-up. However, Maher did take issue with Chappelle saying it’s “easier to talk” in Saudi Arabia than in America.\n\n\n\t“It’s not true,” Maher said of Chappelle’s comment during an episode of “Real Time.” “Do your hunk on Mohammed, Dave.”\n\n\tIn the special, which premiered Dec. 19, Chappelle addressed the controversial claim.\n\n\t“I didn’t tell them to put this in the paper. I just said it on stage. I said, ‘It’s easier to talk in Saudi Arabia for me than it is in America,’” he said. “Oh, I stand ten toes on that. Don’t forget what I just went through. Two years ago, I almost got canceled right here in the United States for transgender jokes. But I gotta tell you something. Transgender jokes went over very well in Saudi Arabia.”\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to Chappelle, Riyadh’s lineup included Kevin Hart, Pete Davidson, Bill Burr, Louis C.K., Whitney Cummings, Aziz Ansari and more.\n\n\tMaher was not the only comedian to come after Riyadh. Jimmy Kimmel, David Cross, Marc Maron and Shane Gillis all spoke out against the festival. Participants like Burr and C.K. spoke very favorably about Riyadh in the wake of the backlash. Burr called the event one of the “top three experiences I’ve had.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDuring the Dec. 20 episode of “Saturday Night Live,” James Austin Johnson’s President Trump used his holiday address to parody his stranger-than-fiction administration.\n\n\tTaking aim at Trump’s primetime address this week, as well as the release of more Epstein files and the president’s announcement that he’s launching “Patriot Games” for elite high school athletes, Johnson went to town in the episode’s cold open.\n\n\n\t“I almost forgot: I’m getting my own Hunger Games,” Johnson-as-Trump said. “That’s right, the White House will be hosting the Patriot Games for high school athletes, because I thought, ‘What’s the best way to distract from the Epstein files?’ I know, invite a bunch of teenagers to my house!”\n\t\n\n\tTrump also disputed the nation’s economic unease, saying, “The economy is fine, all right? The economy’s fine. It’s getting closer to fine. Indigo Girls. They were one of my favorite lesbian folk rock duos. I believe that was Melissa Etheridge and, I want to say, Elton John.”\n\n\tTrump also spoke about adding his name to the Kennedy Center, saying, “We are renaming the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which will now be called the Trump Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. I’m actually going to be renaming a number of our other monuments as well … People are saying, ‘Why are you putting your name on so many buildings?’ And I say it’s because we had to take it off of so many files, Epstein redacted. We had so many Trumps in there!”\n\n\tWatch the cold open sketch below.\n\n",

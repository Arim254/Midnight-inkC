I cannot tell you how surprising and overwhelmed we are and the way you guys have welcomed Anika Nilles. It’s been very heartwarming, and I know that she’s very appreciative of that. We’re even more excited to get back on stage and play with her and to go through the plethora of songs that we’re planning.”\n\n\tThese shows mark the first time Lee and Lifeson have toured together in eleven years since the finale of Rush’s “R40” Tour on August 1, 2015.\n\n\tTOUR DATES (New Dates in Bold)\n\n\tSun Jun 07                  Los Angeles, CA                     Kia Forum SOLD OUT\n\n\tTue Jun 09                  Los Angeles, CA                     Kia Forum SOLD OUT\n\n\tThu Jun 11                  Los Angeles, CA                     Kia Forum SOLD OUT\n\n\tSat Jun 13                   Los Angeles, CA                     Kia Forum SOLD OUT\n\n\tThu Jun 18                  Mexico City, MX                      Palacio de los Deportes\n\n\tWed Jun 24                 Fort Worth, TX            Dickies Arena SOLD OUT\n\t\n\n\tFri Jun 26                    Fort Worth, TX            Dickies Arena SOLD OUT\n\n\tSun Jun 28                  Fort Worth, TX            Dickies Arena SOLD OUT\n\n\tTue Jun 30                  Fort Worth, TX            Dickies Arena SOLD OUT\n\n\tThu Jul 16                   Chicago, IL                              United Center SOLD OUT\n\n\tSat Jul 18                    Chicago, IL                              United Center SOLD OUT\n\n\tMon Jul 20                  Chicago, IL                              United Center SOLD OUT\n\n\tWed Jul 22                  Chicago, IL                              United Center SOLD OUT\n\n\tTue Jul 28                   New York, NY                          Madison Square Garden SOLD OUT\n\t\n\n\tThu Jul 30                   New York, NY                          Madison Square Garden SOLD OUT\n\n\tSat Aug 01                  New York, NY                          Madison Square Garden  SOLD OUT\n\n\tMon Aug 03                 New York, NY                          Madison Square Garden SOLD OUT\n\n\tFri Aug 07                   Toronto, ON                            Scotiabank Arena SOLD OUT\n\n\tSun Aug 09                 Toronto, ON                            Scotiabank Arena SOLD OUT\n\n\tTue Aug 11                  Toronto, ON                            Scotiabank Arena SOLD OUT\n\n\tThu Aug 13                 Toronto, ON                            Scotiabank Arena SOLD OUT\n\n\tFri Aug 21                  Philadelphia, PA                    Xfinity Mobile Arena\n\t\n\n\tWed Aug 26               Detroit, MI                              Little Caesars Arena\n\n\tWed Sept 2                Montreal, QC                         Bell Centre\n\n\tSat Sept 12                Boston, MA                            TD Garden\n\n\tThu Sep 17                 Cleveland, OH                        Rocket Arena SOLD OUT\n\n\tSat Sep 19                  Cleveland, OH                        Rocket Arena SOLD OUT\n\n\tWed Sept 23              San Antonio, TX                    Frost Bank Center\n\n\tMon Oct 5                  Denver, CO                            Ball Arena\n\n\tSat Oct 10                  Seattle, WA                            Climate Pledge Arena\n\n\tThu Oct 15                 San Jose, CA                         SAP Center\n\t\n\n\tSun Oct 25                 Washington D.C.                   Capital One Arena\n\n\tFri Oct 30                   Uncasville, CT                       Mohegan Sun Arena\n\n\tThu Nov 5                  Hollywood, FL                       Hard Rock Live\n\n\tMon Nov 9                  Tampa, FL                              Benchmark International Arena\n\n\tFri Nov 20                  Charlotte, NC                         Spectrum Center\n\n\tWed Nov 25               Atlanta, GA                            State Farm Arena\n\n\tTue Dec 1                   Glendale, AZ                          Desert Diamond Arena\n\n\tThu Dec 10                 Edmonton, AB                       Rogers Place\n\n\tTue Dec 15                 Vancouver, BC                      Rogers Arena\n",

    "body": "\n\tJennifer Lawrence recently said on “The Graham Norton Show” that she “was at peace” with not returning to Hollywood during her two-year acting break a few years ago. After scoring her fourth Oscar nomination with 2015’s “Joy,” Lawrence went on to star in a string of consecutive box office failures like “Passengers” (2016), “mother!” (2017), “Red Sparrow” (2018) and the “X-Men” spinoff “Dark Phoenix” (2019). She then stopped acting for two years, only returning in late 2021 with Adam McKay’s ensemble comedy “Don’t Look Up.”\n\t\n\n\t“I took a little time,” Lawrence told Norton. “I was working all of my twenties, and then I was like… what’s out here? What’s going on?”\n\n\n\tWhen asked if she was worried that she wouldn’t be able to get back into Hollywood, the Oscar winner responded: “I was at peace with that possibility of that happening. [Hollywood] is a lot… I think I would have been [okay], but also I would’ve been really upset. I don’t know.”\n\n\tSpeaking to Vanity Fair in 2021 ahead of the release of “Don’t Look Up,” Lawrence said that her two-year Hollywood break was needed as she “was not pumping out the quality that I should have.” She added at the time: “I just think everybody had gotten sick of me. I’d gotten sick of me. It had just gotten to a point where I couldn’t do anything right. If I walked a red carpet, it was, ‘Why didn’t she run?’”\n\n\tLawrence continued, “I think that I was people-pleasing for the majority of my life. Working made me feel like nobody could be mad at me: ‘Okay, I said yes, we’re doing it. Nobody’s mad.’ And then I felt like I reached a point where people were not pleased just by my existence. So that kind of shook me out of thinking that work or your career can bring any kind of peace to your soul.”\n\t\n\n\tThe actor’s longtime best friend and producing partner Justine Polsky summarized Lawrence’s need for an acting break by telling Vanity Fair at the time: “The protocol of stardom began to kill her creative spirit, to fuck with her compass. So, she vanished, which was probably the most responsible way to protect her gifts. And sanity.”\n\n\tLawrence is now back in the spotlight as she promotes “Die My Love,” her upcoming psychodrama with co-star Robert Pattinson and director Lynne Ramsay. The film, which casts Lawrence as a woman whose life spirals as she balances marriage and motherhood, world premiered at Cannes earlier this year. Mubi is releasing “Die My Love” in theaters Nov. 7.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles has tapped producer Anjay Nagpal as its new executive director. \n\n\tNagpal’s producing credits include Dev Patel’s directorial debut “Monkey Man,” Todd Phillips’ “Joker” and Jay Roach’s “Bombshell.” As a studio executive, he worked on films including “Greyhound,” “The Green Knight” and “The Survivor.” He has been a dedicated advocate for South Asian storytelling, producing “Monkey Man” and developing a series on the Mughal Empire and adaptations of Abraham Verghese’s “Cutting for Stone” and Aravind Adiga’s “Last Man in Tower.”\n\t\n\n\tWith expertise in financing, production and global distribution, Nagpal has been a buyer and seller of films at major international festivals. His track record for identifying talent includes backing first features from Jon Watts (“Cop Car”), Julia Ducournau (“Raw”) and Justin Tipping (“Kicks”).\n\n\n\t“We are honored to be welcoming Anjay to the IFFLA family and cannot wait to work with him in shaping the future of IFFLA,” said festival founder and board chair Christina Marouda. “Anjay’s hands-on experience and understanding of how the film world functions, his respect of IFFLA’s legacy, along with his thoughtful approach in all his endeavors makes him a thrilling leader for our organization.”\n\n\tNagpal’s relationship with the festival predates his appointment, having first attended as an audience member before participating in IFFLA’s Industry Days program.\n\n\t“Christina Marouda has labored for years to create a timeless festival, and I am honored to work with her and the rest of the IFFLA staff and supporters to take IFFLA to new heights,” Nagpal said. “It’s an incredible time for South Asian and diaspora filmmakers, and I’m eager to nurture and champion their work.”\n\t\n\n\tThe festival’s 24th edition is scheduled for April 23-26, 2026. The call for entries for the IFFLA 2026 Shorts Competition opens Oct. 22, 2025.\n\n\tFounded in 2002 as a nonprofit, IFFLA has evolved into one of the premier U.S. platforms for South Asian cinema, fostering dialogue among independent storytellers from South Asia, the diaspora and the international film industry.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRyan Coogler made his first “Creed” film because his father Ira loved the “Rocky” franchise.\n\n\tNow it’s his mom Joselyn’s turn. Coogler tells me he signed on to reboot “The X-Files” because his mother was a big fan of the Fox sci-fi drama series. \n\n\t“Like my relationship with ‘Rocky’ with my dad, ‘The X-Files’ is one of those things with my mom,” Coogler told me Friday at the Cinespia “Sinners” screening at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. “My mom means the world to me — she’s actually here tonight — so this is a big one for me. I want to do right by her and the fans. My mom has read some of the stuff I wrote for it. She’s fired up.”\n\t\n\n\tAs for rumors that Danielle Deadwyler is being eyed to star in the reboot, Coogler laughed, “I can neither confirm or deny.” The same goes for possible appearances by original “X-Files” stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny.\n\n\n\t“Sinners” is the first movie to be shown at Cinespia during the same year it was released. “I’m so excited,” Coogler said. “This is a dream come true. This is my favorite event in Los Angeles. I’m from the Bay Area and L.A. is like our first cousin. There’s a lot of differences between Southern California and Northern California, but we have a lot more in common than we do different. But Cinespia is such an L.A.-specific event and so unique. It was always a dream of mine to make a movie that could play here.”\n\n\tMichael B. Jordan stars in the vampire horror film in the dual roles of twin brothers Smoke and Stack, who return to their Mississippi hometown after WWI to open a juke joint. The cast also includes Hailee Steinfeld, Miles Caton, Jack O’Connell, Wunmi Mosaku, Jayme Lawson, Omar Miller, Li Jun Li and Delroy Lindo.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichael B. Jordan in “Sinners.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWarner Bros. Pictures\n\t\n\n\n\n\tReleased theatrically in April by Warner Bros. Pictures, “Sinners” has grossed $367 million worldwide.\n\n\tJordan has consistently attracted Oscar buzz for his Coogler projects, including “Fruitvale Station” and the “Creed” and “Black Panther” franchises. “I do think he stepped it up to another level on this,” Coogler said of the actor’s work in “Sinners.” “We asked him to do this difficult thing technically, playing two different characters, but it also was a performance that we needed to have the backstory that we had before to pull this off. To see him recognized by his peers and other folks in the industry, I know that would mean a lot of him.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOmar Benson Miller, Sev Ohanian, Zinzi Coogler and Ryan Coogler at the Cinespia screening of “Sinners” at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery on Oct. 17.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCoogler also spoke about Machine Gun Kelly revealing over the summer that he was going to audition for the movie but backed out because he wasn’t comfortable saying the n-word. “That’s understandable,” the filmmaker said. “I get it. I know he has a Black daughter and acting is acting, but you have to be comfortable with whatever it is.”\n\n\t“Sinners” is being re-released for Halloween Oct. 30-Nov. 5 in select IMAX theaters. An official line of “Sinners” costumes are also available at Spirit Halloween stores.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tColman Domingo is off the see the Wizard. The Oscar-nominated actor has been cast as the voice of the Cowardly Lion in “Wicked: For Good.”\n\n\tThe announcement was made on the “Wicked” Instagram account on Monday, with Domingo hiding behind a lion stuffed animal before revealing himself and saying: “See you in Oz!”\n\n\n\tFilmmaker Jon M. Chu recently teased that the fans would be excited when they found out who it was. “Man, wait until the red carpet when the actor who gave us the Cowardly Lion’s voice steps foot on it. It’ll be wild,” he said.\n\t\n\n\tThe Cowardly Lion was a main character in the classic 1939 film “The Wizard of Oz.” In “Wicked,” he is the young cub Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) and Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) rescue after Dr. Dillamond has been taken away and a new professor brings a caged lion to class. The teacher explains how by being imprisoned, the cub will never learn to speak. As Elphaba gets angry, her powers create a moment for her and Fiyero to grab the cub and run into the forest to set it free.\n\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” sees the cub fully grown into the Cowardly Lion who blames Elphaba for his situation. With the sequel overlapping timelines with “The Wizard of Oz,” the lion is seen with Dorothy, The Tin Man and Scarecrow heading down the Yellow Brick Road to see the Wizard (Jeff Goldblum). He’s also seen during the musical number “March of the Witchhunters.” However, as in the Broadway musical, the character doesn’t have a large part.\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” will see the return of Erivo and Ariana Grande as Elphaba Throp and Glinda Upland, respectively, as well as Bailey as Prince Fiyero, Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible, Marissa Bode as Nessarose Thropp, Ethan Slater as Boq Woodsman, Bowen Yang as Pfannee and Bronwyn James as ShenShen.\n\t\n\n\tThe sequel covers the events of the musical’s second act, following Elphaba and Glinda’s friendship being put to the test as they embrace their new respective identities as the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good Witch of the North, and how the consequences of their actions will change all of Oz forever.\n\n\tUniversal will release the film in theaters on Nov. 21.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere aren’t many rules when it comes to selling commercials, but among traditional media companies, one has long been honored: Before the new head of a sales division comes to work, the predecessor usually leaves.\n\n\tParamount Skydance is taking a different tack.\n\n\tThe company, led by entrepreneur David Ellison, last week unveiled an unorthodox new structure for its ad sales operations. Jay Askinasi (above, pictured, left), formerly a senior sales executive at Roku, will arrive November 3 as Paramount’s new chief revenue officer, taking responsibility for ad sales. In a counter-intuitive twist, John Halley (above, pictured, right), the current leader of the company’s ad sales, is expected to stay — though whether it’s for a short-term stint or a longer-term role could not be learned. Despite his new title, Askinasi was not given any authority over other areas of monetization, according to a person familiar with the company, including cash flows coming from syndication of content or distribution via cable and satellite partners or TV affiliates. Indeed, Paramount already has an executive who oversees distribution deals, a veteran named Ray Hopkins who has been with the conglomerate and its predecessors for years.\n\t\n\n\t“Many folks are surprised” by the decision to have Halley and Askinasi work together, says one media buying executive. “The biggest question is what Halley’s role is,” and if he stays for a longer period. Halley could not be reached for direct comment, and Paramount declined to comment on the terms of his current contract.\n\n\tAskinasi has only a limited tenure on the sales side of Madison Avenue’s negotiating table, but his ascension at the new Paramount puts a spotlight on massive shifts taking place in the world of TV advertising, which is increasingly reliant on digital sales rather than those tied to the traditional video screen. Spanish-language media giant TelevisaUnivison in June parted ways with ad-sales chief Donna Speciale — a TV-sales veteran who logged stints at Time Warner and Publicis Groupe — and recruited a new executive, Tim Natividad, who has worked for Roku, Amazon and TikTok. NBCUniversal has given increasing responsibility for its ad-sales efforts to Allison Levin, another former senior Roku sales executive.\n\t\n\n\tSimply put, executives from digital outlets like Roku have more familiarity with new systems of advertising that more big marketers are tapping with greater regularity. People who watch traditional TV see the same national commercials in a “break,” no matter whether they view their favorite show in Des Moines or Gainesville. But streaming subscribers often see an array of commercials that make use of geography, demographics and consumer preferences to dovetail with the needs of the person watching.\n\n\tWith that in mind, even companies that own large TV networks need more people skilled at setting up deals for what is known as “programmatic” advertising, or commercial inventory often scooped up in seconds via algorithms that seek out specific types of consumers, such as first-time mothers or people poised to buy a new car.\n\n\tHalley has many of these skills. Recognized in the ad industry for his deep expertise in managing ad-tech operations, Halley has over years worked set up offerings that allowed advertisers to buy specific kinds of viewer impressions at Viacom, one of Paramount’s predecessor companies. He has experimented with technology that puts commercials aimed at specific consumers over CBS, which typically runs the type of ads everyone sees at once. In recent years, Halley fought for better tabulation of viewers of CBS and Paramount’s cable networks via their digital platforms, refusing for a time to sign a new deal with Nielsen and instead setting up a ratings contract with VideoAmp, a rival audience measurement service. And he has played an instrumental role in the development of a TV-industry council helping to vet new measurement offerings in hopes of setting up a wider array of vendors beyond Nielsen, whose fees are no small part of the media sector’s fixed costs.\n\n\tExecutives at Paramount, however, feel they need more. There is a belief inside Paramount that the bulk of the company’s ad sales will, over time, be sold from streaming platforms, which requires new ad-tech “built from the ground up,” according to the person familiar with the company. The old Paramount never had the resources to build such infrastructure, this person says, and will need to ramp up to battle players such as Amazon and Google if it is to have a viable business. At present, this person says Paramount’s most sizable streaming ad products are found on its free Pluto streaming service, which works on a different platform than Paramount+. In the company’s view, such piecemeal offerings can no longer stand.\n\t\n\n\tAskinasi, who will report to both Paramount’s Ellison, the CEO, and to Jeff Shell, the president, is expected to work closely with both Cindy Holland, the former Netflix executive who now oversees all of Paramount’ streaming properties, and Dane Glasgow, a former Facebook executive tasked with developing innovative products across the company. Meanwhile, Halley remains a valuable navigator of the overall sales market and how to devise enticing offers to potential advertisers.\n\n\tStill, five people familiar with TV ad sales and the Paramount sales team suggest the current arrangement is messy at best. Askanasi, who has worked as a senior executive for Publicis Groupe’s media buying operations, enjoys a reputation as a gregarious executive who is well-liked by clients and negotiating partners. Halley is viewed as having more academic disposition and is more enmeshed with operations and technology and is respected for his industry smarts.  Which executive should clients approach? Which should various sales teams keep more in mind? What’s more, Askinasi takes over just as hundreds of Paramount employees are being laid off — including some, no doubt, in ad sales. He will run a department consisting of a staff he had no say in shaping.\n\n\tParamount must grapple with other challenges. Its cable properties are increasingly irrelevant in the market, and networks like Logo, MTV and TV Land have been starved of new content for years. Many of the networks have just one or two original programs and focus heavily on shows from Paramount’s library. Such stuff makes the task of selling CBS’ ad time — some of the most desirable in the business — more difficult, because ad-sales executives often must press clients to buy up cable volume to gain access to top tier stuff.\n\n\tParamount’s ad revenue has eroded gradually. Ad sales tied to streaming and those tied to traditional TV were both off 6% for the first half of the year, according to the company’s second-quarter earnings report. The company may see Askinasi as a new ambassador to parties ranging from Coca-Cola to Nielsen.\n\n\tAt least one of Halley’s policies is likely to stay in place. He raised eyebrows in 2022 when he decided to cancel Paramount’s annual May upfront showcase to advertisers. The event, long held at New York’s Carnegie Hall when it was backed by CBS, was viewed as a bellwether for the event, which kicks off an annual scrum to sell billions in TV ad time ahead of the networks’ next cycle of programming. In recent years, Paramount has held a series of bespoke meetings with different advertisers and agencies, changing elements of its presentation to suit the attendee.,  People familiar with the market say the meetings have been successful, and help Paramount strike longer-term deals with advertisers that are often more complex and worth more money than those they might have gained form traditional upfront outreach\n\t\n\n\tOld-school upfront showcases have become  “bombastic,” Halley told Variety earlier this year, and don’t allow for an exchange of ideas between media outlets and advertisers. “Being able to hear from our customers, what they need from us, is critical,” Halley said at the time. “It’s critical, and it can’t be replicated in the big show.”\n\n\tExecutives at Paramount agree, and the person familiar with the company suggests Halley’s strategy is likely to continue in 2026. At least one other outlet has begun to use a similar idea. In 2025, Roku, with ad sales headed by Askinasi, launched its own series of private meetings with advertisers.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tEveryone has theories about why Sony Pictures Animation’s “KPop Demon Hunters” turned out to be such a massive phenomenon on Netflix, surpassing everything else to become the streamer’s most-watched original movie.\n\n\tDuring a sold-out panel at the Animation Is Film Festival in Los Angeles, the creative team let a few trade secrets slip as they unpacked an iconic scene from the movie: the one where South Korea’s hottest singing trio Huntrix initially cross paths with the Saja Boys, a rival band comprised of five ridiculously handsome hunks (who also happen to be demons).\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve been waiting to talk about this scene for so long,” said director Maggie Kang, who came up with the idea of combining well-rounded female characters with Korean demons in a movie where her three leads could be talented and attractive, but also silly and stupid. “When this movie was first pitched, Kristine Belson, the president of Sony Animation, said, ‘Let’s objectify the crap out of these guys.’ Finally! So that was kind of our goal: to make really thirsty girls.”\n\n\tIn the scene, when Zoey and Mira catch sight of the guys, their eyes turn into bulging red hearts, then change shape several more times as the attraction escalates. As Zoey catches a glimpse of lead dancer Abby Saja’s abs, the hearts morph into a six-pack which turns into a corn cob, before the rising heat in Zoey’s flushed face makes them “pop.”\n\n\tAccording to Kang, this was the first major scene the team animated (not counting the 11-second “let’s get battle ready” montage where the trio suit up). Why start there? “We thought that all the jokes were landing really well. And we also just really desperately wanted it in the movie,” Kang said.\n\t\n\n\tAnimation director Josh Beveridge described it as “a proof of concept” for the characters they’d designed: “Like, how are we gonna get these glamorous faces to also do these ridiculous things? It’s conceptually challenging, but equally technically challenging.”\n\n\tIf you break it down, the look of “KPop Demon Hunters” reflects the intersection of three key influences: K-pop music (which tends to be slick and synchronized), K-dramas (melodramatic TV series with soft lighting, shallow focus and slo-mo that ramps down to the desired speed mid-shot) and Japanese anime (a traditionally hand-drawn style with a wide range of exaggerated facial expressions).\n\n\t“We had to figure out a whole bunch of fancy little animation illusions to pull this off,” Beveridge said, describing everything from highly targeted motion blur to interchangeable faces. “All that stuff breaks all the rules of everything we’ve ever done before” — and that’s saying something, considering Beveridge’s previous job at Sony Animation: “For ‘Spider-Verse,’ we had to be really graphic and flat, and this would be gentle,” he said. “If you frame through that, it’s riddled with little secrets of how we could let soft edges just creep in artistically, only where you want it, and protect those graphic lines for the jokes to read.”\n\n\tFor example, when Zoey’s jaw drops and she starts to drool, your typical CG character rig isn’t flexible enough to accommodate the desired expression. “To get those big mouths, that’s basically a fake room floating a foot in front of the face, but it has to [look right] under the same light,” Beveridge said, “so we’re doing a lot of tricky math to make that work.”\n\n\tIf you were to reposition the virtual camera and view the scene from a different angle, it would look absolutely horrifying, he said: “That’s why they don’t move.”\n\n\tAccording to production designer Helen Chen, to figure out how to pull off some of those more extreme expressions (inspired by the exaggerated “chibi” style used for comic effect in manga), character designer Omar Smith would sculpt to camera. “We coined this term, ‘demi-chibi,’” Chen said. “We had the version where it would go full-on, like what you see in anime,” though making it work with 3D characters required interchangeable parts and maximum flexibility — rigs Kang compared to a Mr. Potato Head.\n\t\n\n\tChris Appelhans, who shared directing duties with Kang, credited character designer Ami Thompson with designing the female leads (whom he and Kang wanted to look distinctly Korean) and Scott Watanabe with making all those expressions work in 3D animation.\n\n\t“We had to study a lot of Korean cinematography for lighting,” Appelhans said. “It’s a different thing to light a Korean face: There are different plane changes, different things that flatter, different tricks you do to make people look their best, which was tied into our love of fashion photography, K-drama lighting, music videos. It’s all very beautiful and heightened, so that naturally gave the lighting a bit of an identity.”\n\n\tIn the scene, after Rumi reprimands her friends for swooning to the Saja Boys, Jinu appears and an elaborate K-drama in-joke begins: The scene shifts to slo-mo, as MeloMance’s “Love, Maybe” plays on the soundtrack (a cue that directly references the show “Business Proposal,” on which Jinu voice actor Ahn Hyo-seop starred).\n\n\t“We’re trying to pay homage to a very K-drama moment, which uses slow motion, and we realized it’s not just slow motion. There’s like a ramp into it,” Kang said, referring to a shot like the one where Rumi’s purple braid appears, slowing down as it bursts from beneath her hoodie. “We called it fireworks … because if we just did slow-mo, it didn’t feel right.”\n\n\tAdded Appelhans, “In a lot of the K-drama stuff that we loved, they shoot a lot of coverage. If the guy’s getting hit by a car — which is going to happen in every K-drama, even if they’re set like a thousand years ago — they would just shoot the scene from a million angles.” He and Kang used a similar technique when Jinu bumps Rumi’s shoulder in the scene, and the editing breaks continuity to show the moment from multiple angles. “We don’t get any coverage in animation unless these poor souls [the animators] make it for us, so we had to figure out the little pieces that we actually wanted, and then only animate those, and it was the same with the concerts and the music videos.” \n\n\tWhen it came to action scenes, they wanted audiences to feel the K-pop and anime influences in the choreography. Kang also lifted tricks from a super-intense Korean action film called “The Villainess.” \n\t\n\n\t”You can get pretty violent if you put a lot of glitter on,” Beveridge joked. Generous helpings of “sparkle dust” helped make those sequences (the bathhouse and subway battles) feel more like “dance fighting” than full-blown carnage. ”Some of those fight choreographers had done some idol training, and in between the moves, they’d make these cute little adjustments. That is where the personality is.” \n\n\tBack when Kang was initially brainstorming the project, she knew she wanted to come up with an idea that was specific to Korean culture, while also featuring a heroic female protagonist. “We just went down the list of Korean things and landed on K-pop. And when we added that together, it just felt fun and exciting,” said Kang, who agreed to co-directing with Appelhans, who is married to Korean American YA author Maureen Goo.\n\n\t“I knew that his wife is Korean, and like all Korean wives, we try to make our non-Korean husbands as Korean as possible, so it was like he was Korean,” Kang joked. “On this weird Europe trip, we realized we have exactly the same taste. So our collaboration was pretty seamless, because we both knew exactly what kind of movie we wanted.”\n\n\tAppelhans had shown a strong commitment to cultural authenticity on his previous feature. “I really respected the fact that Chris moved to China when he was making ‘Wish Dragon,’ and he felt the importance of a Chinese crew producing that.”\n\n\tOn “KPop Demon Hunters,” the whole crew flew to South Korea on a research trip, though Appelhans had 20 years of invaluable experience at home. Referring to his wife, Appelhans said, “She is exactly the type of woman that Maggie is and wanted to depict, which is very smart, very funny, but also angry and silly and weird, who loves pajama pants, but also loves fashion and loves to eat.”\n\n\tWhen the two directors met, it was clear to Appelhans that Kang had a very clear vision of the type of women she wanted to portray in the movie. “And I was like, ‘This might seem weird, talking to the whitest person you’ve ever met, but I know exactly what you mean when you say that,’” he recalled. “Maggie often says she’s making the movie she wanted to see, and also the movie that 12-year-old Maggie wanted to see. I think I was making the movie I wanted to see, but also that 12-year-old Maureen would have wanted to see.”\n\t\n\n\tKang was coy about a potential sequel — which seems inevitable — but did reveal a spot where an additional song had been cut from the film: “There was a moment that was kind of like Rumi’s dark night of the soul,” Kang said. “It came after her meeting with Celine, and we had it for a little bit, but it felt redundant. And we had a little demo that accompanied it, which was really beautiful and sorrowful, but it just felt emotionally not correct to have that moment and then go right into a climax, so we took it out.”\n\n\tDon’t expect that track to appear in any future Huntrix adventures. The team insisted that the film’s songs were written to serve the narrative and emotional needs of the scenes in which they appear — even if they take on fresh meaning when played outside the movie — and the same would surely be true going forward.\n\n\t“If we do another music video that’s fully animated, it will go back into the world of how Rumi and Mira and Zoey would live in those places,” Appelhans explained. “That was actually the very first epiphany: We don’t want people to think of these as animated K-pop characters or a virtual band. We just want them to think about Mira, Zoey, Rumi. That first day or two on TikTok [after the film opened], you saw everybody go straight past all of those things we worried about. They just went for character and the music. That was the goal the whole time.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tABC’s decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show last month drove a surge in cancellations of Disney+ and Hulu streaming services by consumers outraged over the move. However, both services also saw a healthy increase in the number of sign-ups during the month of September, which helped offset those nixing their subscriptions, according to data released Monday.\n\n\tOn Sept. 17, ABC said “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” would be suspended “indefinitely.” That came following remarks the host made on his show two days prior about “the MAGA gang” trying to score political points over the suspect charged with the murder of conservative activist Kirk, resulting in outrage on the right that led two big ABC affiliate groups — Nexstar and Sinclair — to announce they were pre-empting Kimmel. Disney brought Kimmel back on Tuesday, Sept. 23, with the show delivering TV ratings to rank as its highest-rated episode ever even with the Sinclair and Nexstar boycotts.\n\t\n\n\tA wave of consumers canceled (or threaten to cancel) Hulu and/or Disney+ to protest ABC’s suspension Kimmel. And according to research firm Antenna, for the month of September 2025, the U.S. cancellation rate for Disney+ averaged 8% — double the 4% estimate for the prior two months. Similarly, Hulu’s cancellation rate for the month was 10%, twice the 5% for the preceding two months. For September, the industry weighted average cancellation rate across nine premium services (Apple TV+, Discovery+, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, Paramount+, Peacock, Starz) was 7%, according to Antenna.\n\n\tThat said, both Disney+ and Hulu had higher-than-average sign-ups during September, per Antenna. Disney+ had 2.18 million new subscribers (vs. 1.99 million in August and 1.65 million in July) and Hulu had 2.11 million (vs. 1.97 million and 1.73 million), according to Antenna’s estimates. In addition, the number of gross adds for September of both Disney+ and Hulu saw a market share of 14% each (down compared with August but up vs. July).\n\t\n\n\tOne important caveat: Antenna’s methodology does not incorporate Disney’s wholesale business, including its distribution deal with Charter. In addition, the Antenna data as released does not shed light on whether consumers who “canceled” did so as part of switching, upgrading or downgrading their streaming plans. \n\n\tAnother note of context about the Antenna data: Disney on Sept. 23 announced price increases across most Disney+, Hulu streaming plans and bundles, and that naturally would have contributed to higher-than-usual cancellations.\n\n\tIn announcing its June quarter results, Disney said it expected total Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions to increase by more than 10 million, primarily driven by the company’s expanded Charter deal — however, that was before the Kimmel brouhaha.\n\n\tIt’s not clear what the ultimate result on net additions for Disney+ and Hulu were for the month of September, as that is not a category that is tracked by Antenna. But the increase in sign-ups would obviously have served to mitigate the cancellations the Disney-owned streamers saw for the month.\n\n\tAs of the end of June, core Disney+ subscribers stood at 128 million, up 1.8 million sequentially. Hulu subscribers reached 55.5 million, a net gain of 800,000.\n\n\tDisney, following in the footsteps of Netflix and others, will stop reporting the number of subscribers for its Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ streaming services, saying the metric has become “less meaningful to evaluating the performance of our businesses.” The company will discontinue reporting subs and ARPU for Disney+ and Hulu with the first quarter of its fiscal 2026 (the last three months of calendar year 2025), and will no longer report the metrics for ESPN+ as of the September 2025 quarter. The company is scheduled to release September 2025 results on Nov. 13 after the market close.\n\n\tAccording to New York-based Antenna, its estimates are based on millions of permission-based, consumer opt-in, raw transaction records, which are sourced from a variety of partners. The data includes digital purchase and cancellation receipts, consumer subscription signals, and credit, debit and banking data. Antenna says it cleans and models the raw data, and then subsequently weighs the panel to correct for demographic and behavioral skews.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSeafarers’ worst nightmare is back for more bloodshed.\n\n\t”Screamboat,” the comedy-horror film which stars a murderous take on Steamboat Willie, is set to have a sequel, the director of the first film announced. “Screamboat,” which was released earlier this year, was announced when the Disney precursor to Mickey Mouse entered the public domain in 2024.\n\n\t“I’m thrilled to announce the sequel to our bloody horror comedy,” director Steven LaMorte said in a statement. “We had so much fun bringing these iconic characters to life with a bloody twist, and I look forward to returning to the world of ‘Screamboat’ to create even more miniature murder and mayhem.”\n\t\n\n\tLaMorte first teased the new chapter during his acceptance speech when “Screamboat” was named Best Public Domain Resurrection at the Oct. 19 Fangoria Chainsaw Awards.\n\n\n\tThe sequel is set to begin development in 2026. While most of the cast is expected to return, no formal announcement has been made.\n\n\tOne notable addition? A love interest for Steamboat Willie is set to join the chaos, as was teased at the end of the first film. The sequel “will continue the story and expand on the shocking cliffhanger ending of the first film — which teased the arrival of another murderous public-domain icon: Minnie,” the filmmakers teased in the press release. “Fans can expect the sequel to build on that legacy with even more outrageous set pieces and gruesome comedy.”\n\n\tThe original film was produced by Amy Schumacher, Martine Melloul, Steven Della Salla and Michael Leavy. The creature effects were from Christian Beckman’s Quantum Creation FX, Inc. and designed by Christian Cordella.\n",

And the text could be triggering for victims.”\n      \n    \n          “How can any self respecting woman stay with a man who ‘jokes’ like that? I’m not even a very serious person, but that would have me leaving so fast your head would spin,” wrote another.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          One just called the sentiment, \"weird.\"\n      \n    \n          Kristen and Dax said \"I do\" in October 2013.

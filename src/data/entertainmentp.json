    "body": "\n\tWhat if a movie trailer had filters and huge neon text, and was set to, say, a Dua Lipa song? What if it was made by a teenager in the Philippines, or Brazil, using pirated material? What if the plot of the film was entirely irrelevant?\n\n\tIf you’ve spent time on TikTok, odds are you’ve seen your fair share of fan edits — intricately crafted montages of film, TV or other clips that are set to popular music. Some are like highlight reels, others are like memes and still others are fantasy-based interpretations of popular media that stray far from the tone or text of the source material. Take #SydCarmy, a hashtag that offers hundreds of edits that project a romantic relationship between the two platonic main characters of “The Bear.”\n\t\n\n\tThese edits rack up millions of views, activating fan communities around titles from “The Summer I Turned Pretty” to “Barry Lyndon.” Briana McElroy, the head of worldwide digital marketing for Lionsgate Films, calls them “love letters from fans.” Put cynically, they’re also free advertising.\n\n\n\tHollywood studios like Hulu and Paramount+, noticing the immense viral impact of these TikTok videos, have started to adopt fan edits in official marketing campaigns. Lionsgate has gone all in on the format, posting edits every few days of new titles like “The Long Walk” and old ones like “Divergent.”\n\n\t“Within our digital marketing team, we operate like fans,” McElroy says. “If we’re trying to have a conversation with fans online, we need to be able to speak their language.” Lionsgate works with “legacy agencies” to craft a more “polished” voice on Facebook and Instagram, McElroy says, while for TikTok it creates content that feels “native to the platform.”\n\t\n\n\tOf course, any corporation attempting to engage in internet culture runs the risk of being the desperate “cool mom” who spoils the fun. So instead of trying to emulate viral fan editors, Lionsgate decided to hire them. Felipe Mendez, who manages the Lionsgate account, reached out to around 250 editors on TikTok and built a roster of about 15. “We’re going to the artists that fans are already obsessed with and saying: ‘We want you to create what you’re already doing; we just want to work together,’” says Mendez, who is 26.\n\n\tMendez, a member of UTA’s Next Gen team, has helped brands like Axe and PBS reach younger demographics. He says he pushes company leadership to lean into what they don’t understand about Gen Z. “To do well on TikTok, your videos have to be so divorced from what your brand is,” he says. In other words, the brand has to be OK making fun of itself. (A “Hunger Games” edit posted by Lionsgate pairs Katniss Everdeen’s bird call with Flo Rida’s unsubtle ode to oral sex, “Whistle.”)\n\n\tMendez says he realized the potential of fan edits a couple years ago, when “Suits” videos were garnering hundreds of millions of views on TikTok. He credits those clips with catapulting the 2010s legal drama to the most-streamed show of 2023 and spawning a spinoff.\n\n\tWhile it’s difficult to measure the conversion rate of people who see a fan edit and then watch the movie or show it’s based on, Mendez says the proof is in the comments section. He points to a “Creed” edit by user Areq, which has amassed 195 million views and 19 million likes since July. A sampling of the 300,000 comments: “Guess I’m watching ‘Creed’ today”; “OK, I’ll watch ‘Creed 1,’ ‘2’ and ‘3’ today”; “Just let the editors make the trailers for the movies at this point.” The week Areq’s edit was posted, viewership of the 2015 boxing drama increased 29% on Amazon Prime, according to Luminate data.\n\n\tCan fan edits drive engagement offline? For Lionsgate, the first major test is the upcoming rerelease of “Twilight,” itself prompted in part by the response to a fan edit campaign. The studio has posted nearly 40 edits since last summer and believes there is a whole community of TikTokers born after “Twilight” came out who will show up in theaters for the vampire romance.\n\t\n\n\tIn fact, McElroy says the marketing aim is much bigger than just one theatrical event. “When we started posting ‘Twilight’ content on TikTok, it wasn’t with the goal of driving revenue or bringing the film back to theaters,” she says. “Our goal was just to make sure we’re creating a community and sustaining it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLas Vegas Aces coach and six-time WNBA All-Star Becky Hammon is getting the well-deserved documentary treatment.\n\n\tNamed a “dynasty architect” by sports and mainstream media, Hammon’s rise through basketball to the international stage as a three-time WNBA title earner will be the subject of a nonfiction film from production companies SMAC and 2463, Variety can report exclusively.\n\n\n\tFormer pro turned host Michael Strahan co-founded SMAC with Constance Schwartz-Morini. 2463 Entertainment was founded by football star Odell Beckham Jr.\n\t\n\n\t“For decades, women on the hardwood have been underestimated and told to stay in their lane,” said Schwartz-Morini, CEO of SMAC. “Becky defied every expectation and broke through barriers that once seemed unshakable. Her journey inspires us all, and we’re honored to tell her story.”\n\n\n\tThrough never-before-heard audio diaries, the documentary will offer an inside look at Hammon in her most intense moments — from the adversity she faced while interviewing for NBA head coaching positions, to when she became the first female acting head coach in the NBA with the San Antonio Spurs in 2020. Layered with moments of frustration, vulnerability and determination, these recordings tell the story of not just the successful athlete-turned-coach the world sees, but also Hammon’s personal pursuit to lead on her own terms.\n\n\tFred Anthony Smith, Ajay Sangha and Sean Clifford will serve as executive producers alongside Beckham Jr., Strahan and Schwartz-Morini.\n\n\tLess than a week ago, the New York Times studied Hammon’s performance record, saying she is the “standard of excellence in the WNBA, the owner of the greatest coaching record in finals history” and that the league’s newest dynasty was “a product of her creation.”\n\t\n\n\tSMAC Entertainment’s upcoming slate includes the three-part docuseries “Prime Time” at Netflix; the untitled Michael Vick/Norfolk State series at BET; and Amazon MGM’s highly anticipated “Madden” starring Nicolas Cage, Christian Bale, Will Ferrell and Shane Gillis.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile at the Lumiere Festival in Lyon where he’s being honored with a career tribute, Michael Mann reflected on his time in Paris documenting the student uprisings of 1968 for NBC. That year, he said, left an indelible mark on him and his body of work.\n\n\t“That experience was so formative to me personally, because ’68 was this pivotal year,” Mann told Thierry Fremaux, the Cannes boss who heads Lumiere Festival, at a packed masterclass that ran for nearly two hours. “It culminated in the Democratic Convention in Chicago and a police riot, in 500 students being killed the Mexico City, in the death of Martin Luther King, of Bobby Kennedy. It was the pivotal year in wakening consciousness of people.”\n\t\n\n\tMann, who also talked about his early career in an interview with Variety ahead of the festival, revealed that many of his films are filled with references from that tumultuous era, including 1974’s Rumble in the Jungle in “Ali.”\n\n\n\tMann then drew a parallel with the current political divide in the U.S., saying: “What’s going now is like the ’60s in America in a sense. Except that the vanguard and the resistance today is in ‘South Park,'” he joked, sparking laughter from the crowd.\n\n\tAt the Lumière Festival, Mann has been celebrated throughout the week with a retrospective spanning 12 of his theatrical features, as well his pilot for the Max series “Tokyo Vice” and “The Jericho Mile,” a sports movie shot inside Folsom Prison featuring real inmates as extras. He will receive a Lumière Award tribute on Friday evening from Oscar-nominated French actor Isabelle Huppert.\n\t\n\n\tRegarding the long-anticipated “Heat 2,” Mann said: “We’re in the middle of negotiations and it looks like it will go forward sometimes in the summer of 2026.” As Variety reported last week, the Amazon MGM-owned United Artists and producer Scott Stuber are in final negotiations to secure the rights to the sequel from Warner Bros.\n\n\tAsked about what different genre he’d be interested in exploring, Mann said he could see himself directing a science fiction movie and mentioned he was “a fan” of “Metal Hurlant,” the French sci-fi and fantasy comics anthology published in the U.S. as “Heavy Metal.”\n\n\tMann also said he “wanted to do a Western” and had already written two screenplays, one of which is for a film called “Comanche” which he’ll produce rather than direct.\n\n\t“Scott Cooper is going to do it,” Mann said, without giving further details about the plot. Cooper was at the Lumiere Festival earlier this week for the premiere of his latest film, “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,” starring Jeremy Allen White and Jeremy Strong.\n\n\tThroughout the masterclass, Mann also spoke about other filmmakers, including Christopher Nolan, whom he described as a “good friend” and applauded for being “very active in the Directors’ Guild of America.” When one of the audience members asked Mann if he was potentially inspired by comics and Marvel movies, he suggested it was the other way around.\n\n\t“Chris Nolan maintains that ‘Heat’ influenced Batman,” Mann said. “I don’t exactly know how and why, except that I think it had to do with the idea of a large-scale narrative that’s about a number of things.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Weapons” is coming to HBO Max. The Zach Cregger’s summer horror hit from Warner Brothers’ New Line Cinema will land on the streamer on Oct. 24, just in time for Halloween.\n\n\tCregger’s sophomore feature after his 2022 sleeper-hit “Barbarian,” “Weapons” released on Aug. 8 with earliest preview screenings taking place at 2:17 p.m. the day before in a nod to a pivotal time in the film. The story focuses on a class of third graders who inexplicably go missing one night, with cameras capturing that all of the kids woke up and left their homes at 2:17 in the morning, run into the woods, never to return. What ensues is a community-wide frenzy involving the kids’ teacher, their parents, the local police, and the one kid in class who conspicuously remained. It’s an original urban legend with unexpected twists, enthralling scares and a deeply satisfying climax.\n\t\n\n\tThe film opened to over $43 million at the domestic box office and passed the $100 million threshold by its third weekend in theaters. It far outperformed “Barbarian’s” $45 million lifetime global box office and became one of the sneakiest (and creepiest) hits of the summer. It’s made more than $260 million globally.\n\n\n\tThe movie stars Julia Garner, Josh Brolin, Alden Ehrenreich, Amy Madigan, Benedict Wong, Austin Abrams, June Diane Raphael, and Cary Christopher in the latter’s theatrical feature film debut. It was produced by Cregger alongside Roy Lee, Miri Yoon, J.D. Lifshitz and Raphael Margules at New Line Cinema and production companies Subconscious, Vertigo Entertainment and BoulderLight Pictures. Next up, Cregger is taking on a beloved horror franchise: “Resident Evil.” He reteams with Abrams for the video game adaptation for Sony.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhere can I find my favorite NBA team’s next game as more media outlets pick up professional basketball? The league wants to help.\n\n\tWith just days to go before the start of its next season, the NBA is launching a new effort that will help fans find the game they want to watch, including local games as well as national games available on Disney’s ESPN and ABC; NBCUniversal’s NBC and Peacock; and Amazon’s Prime Video.\n\n\n\t“We are really focused on making sure fans know where to find our games,” says Sara Zuckert, an NBA senior vice president who oversees the league’s mobile app. “We recognize this season for them has two great new media partners, but that may leave fans not necessarily knowing where our games are.”\n\t\n\n\tThe NBA launches new “Tap to Watch” technology as its games move to streaming platforms in bulk, thanks to new deals struck with NBCU and Amazon, which will showcase a wide range of games previously allocated to Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney. Fans using the NBA App, NBA.com and team apps and websites will be shown how to access game telecasts not only through local and national rightsholders, but digital platforms including Google, Meta, X, Snap, Reddit, Roku and Dapper Labs.\n\n\t“The live game is the core of the NBA fan experience,” says Zuckert, who describes making access easier to digital audiences as “essential.” The technology will take fans to the platform showing a game, and if t they are not subscribers, help them through that process.\n\n\tThe NBA isn’t the only sports entity interested in such stuff. ESPN in August of last year tried to prove its utility to all fans by unveiling a “Where to Watch” search feature in its mobile app and website that would do something every sports aficionado has craved since Amazon nabbed rights to stream portions of the NFL’s “Thursday Night Football” in 2017: help die-hards increasingly frustrated in their efforts to find their favorite teams as sports began to stream across new broadband giants, league-owned outlets and regional venues.\n\t\n\n\tI think that’s going to be a real priority for all of us is just making sure that people know where to go. You’re going to have — there’s 40 percent more national games than last year, but people have to know where to get them,” said Tim Corrigan, senior vice president of sports production at Disney’s ESPN, in a conference with journalists earlier this week. “That’s going to be a big responsibility on all three of the partners, as well as the league to beat that drum and make sure people know people know where to go to get this because the additional over the air on ABC and NBC is a big deal, and is going to be more available and some of the streaming are going to be things that really need to be — we need to drive folks and let them know where to go.”\n\n\tSuch efforts highlight the growing importance of tracking sports as rights deals become increasingly spread out among different venues. With sports standing as the only TV format that seems able to attract the large, simultaneous audiences that advertisers and distributors crave, the fees to keep them on air have gone from eye-popping to exorbitant. With prices so high, media companies are narrowing their packages, leaving some big leagues like the NBA spread across more networks and streamers.

    "description": "\n\tFor the fifth and final season of “Stranger Things,” creators Matt and Ross Duffer (as they explained in interviews for Variety’s Oct. 15 cover stor",
    "body": "\n\tFor the fifth and final season of “Stranger Things,” creators Matt and Ross Duffer (as they explained in interviews for Variety’s Oct. 15 cover story) did not want to leave any major plot threads or character arcs unfinished. “We do every last remaining thing we wanted to do with the Demogorgons and Mind Flayer and Vecna and the Upside Down and Hawkins and these characters,” Matt Duffer said. “This is a complete story. It’s done.”\n\t\n\n\tThat kind of definitive statement only makes the Duffers’ plans for a “Stranger Things” spinoff show — first announced in summer 2022 after the release of “Stranger Things 4″ — more intriguing, because whatever the spinoff is, it won’t continue the story of any of the show’s characters. Nor do the brothers expect it to explore a larger narrative within the world of the first show, like the “Star Wars” TV series have been doing on Disney+.\n\n\n\t“It’s so different than something like ‘Star Wars,'” Matt said. “It doesn’t really work like that.” Instead, the spinoff will be part of the show’s “brand” and “style of storytelling” — “kids, adventures, sci-fi/fantasy, rather than increasingly expand what could become an insanely convoluted mythology.”\n\n\tWith the main spinoff idea, as well as any future ones, Ross said: “They’re going to live in a bit of a different world. There’s going to be connective tissue, but you’re almost anthologizing in a way. Because we’re not ‘Star Wars.’ We can’t be like, ‘Oh, now we’re on this planet.’”\n\n\t“You’re just too boxed in,” Matt added. “It starts to get frustrating from a storytelling perspective.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Duffers have developed the spinoff while working on “Stranger Things 5,” and the process “has been so fun,” Matt said. “You’re starting with new characters — it’s like clean slate. You’re not tied up into any knots. There’s something refreshing about it.\n\n\t“The hope is you’re not just doing something to just do it,” he continued. “And Netflix has been surprisingly patient, although I think now, I feel that patience wearing thin a little bit with the show coming to an end. But they’re understanding.”\n\n\tThe Duffers will create the spinoff series, and will be “heavily creatively involved,” Ross said, and  “helping shepherd it along” — but they won’t be its showrunners, as they launch their next era as filmmakers with their new Paramount deal. “We’ll, hopefully, be writing and directing something new in the meantime.”\n\n\tWhen asked about the spinoff in an interview, Netflix’s chief creative officer Bela Bajaria jumped in to ask, “Ooh, what did they say?” She said she knows the Duffers want to do “the show and title justice,” and “it’s not just the idea of doing another one.”\n\n\tThe Duffers have been keeping the concept for the new series a secret. “They’ve been thinking about this for a long time,” Bajaria said. “So I’m excited about what it’s going to be, but I don’t know what that is yet!”\n\n\tWhile there doesn’t appear to be a timeline for the spinoff, Bajaria said with a laugh, “I’d always love more ‘Stranger Things.’ When they’re ready, we’ll be ready.”\n\n\tIn truth, Netflix and the Duffers are already well underway with more “Stranger Things”: The animated offshoot “Stranger Things: Tales From ’85,” developed by showrunner Eric Robles (who created the Nickelodeon series “Fanboy & Chum Chum”), was presented at the Annecy Animation Festival in June. That series was the Duffers’ idea, Matt said, “because we grew up loving some of the cartoons that were based on movies that we love, like ‘Beetlejuice’ and ‘Ghostbusters.’” They envisioned capturing the “throwback” spirit of those shows “in a more modern way” — similar to the live-action series’ embrace of Steven Spielberg and Stephen King films from the 1980s. \n\n\tThe show has no release date yet; when they spoke with Variety, the Duffers had seen one complete episode. Robles “knocked it out of the park,” Matt said. “It really feels like the show.” The animation style is similar to Netflix’s Emmy-winning series “Arcane,” but “not as expensive as ‘Arcane,’ added Ross.\n\t\n\n\t“And it’s nice, because the kids can stay young forever,” Matt said. “We set it when they’re that perfect Season 2 age.”\n\n\tShould “Tales from ’85” or the spinoff series prove successful, then “Stranger Things” could live on for quite some time on Netflix. \n\n\tShawn Levy, an executive producer and director of the mothership show, will also be involved in whatever comes next. “I’m excited to extend the storytelling life of ‘Stranger Things’ — I’m not going to call it a ‘universe,’ because that would be obnoxious,” he said. He then paused. “The ‘STU’? Too soon? Shit, I know you’re going to use that!”\n\n\tWhat the extended universe of “Stranger Things” will be known as does seem to be a matter of debate. “What do you call it that’s not lame — a universe? A franchise?” Matt asked rhetorically. “We need something else.”\n\n\t“The ‘Strangerverse’?” Ross suggested. “I don’t know.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSince 2012, super-producer Dick Wolf has built an empire atop the foundation established by “Chicago Fire,” expanding the series into an entire universe of procedurals with their own dedicated night on NBC. Now that rival network CBS has a firefighting hit of its own in “Fire Country” (now entering its fourth season), the broadcast institution appears to be following the same first-responder procedural playbook. A spinoff, “Sheriff Country,” premieres this week; if the show succeeds, one imagines “Med Country” and “Justice Country” can’t be too far behind.\n\t\n\n\tBut any success “Sheriff Country,” created by Matt Lopez (the “Father of the Bride” remake) and executive produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, might enjoy won’t be due to its standalone quality. Starting with the nonsensical name — “Fire Country” is a place where wildfires happen; is “Sheriff Country” a place where…sherriff-ing happens? — and flatlining from there, the show is a generically conceived, limply executed take on small-town law enforcement. That premise is already belied by “Sheriff Country” taking place in the same rural California-but-shot-in-Canada outpost as “Fire Country,” the fictional and supposedly tiny Edgewater, even though most of its characters are brand new. (“Fire Country” stars Max Thieriot and Diane Farr make cameos, and some protagonists were previously introduced in the flagship show via backdoor pilot.) The setup only degrades further over the four episodes screened for critics.\n\n\n\tMorena Baccarin, a seasoned actor who’s been far better served elsewhere, plays the titular Mickey Fox, the acting head of the county police force related to the Leones of “Fire Country” via a since-dissolved marriage. Mickey is introduced amiably as we see her talking two brothers off the ledge of mutual homicide with her gun trained on them and theirs on each other. It’s a strange mix of action and attempted folksiness that doesn’t get any smoother as the season goes on. One of the brothers sports a suit and ponytail á la John Travolta in “Pulp Fiction,” the first of many Mickey adversaries to come off like goofy caricatures, like a gang of pot growers who drug and enslave unsuspecting college students to work their crop. (Seems unnecessary now that weed is a multibillion-dollar, semi-legal industry!) If the point of the show is to create an intimate portrait of a tight-knit community, the antagonists of the week work at cross-purposes to that goal.\n\t\n\n\tMickey is only acting sheriff for now, having yet to be officially elected after inheriting the role from her old boss. Complicating her campaign are Mickey’s struggles with her daughter Skye (Amanda Arcuri), a recovering addict with a bad influence of a boyfriend, and father Wes (W. Earl Brown), an ex-con clunkily described as “the patron saint of Edgewater outlaws.” When Skye stumbles on said boyfriend’s dead body, it kicks off the larger storyline of “Sheriff Country” to fill the space between armed robberies, abuse cases and other local crimes — though confusingly, it wraps up rather quickly, leaving the rest of the season a wide-open slate. Skye herself has almost no distinguishing characteristics besides her fragile state and propensity for terrible decisions, especially as the investigation around her boyfriend’s death kicks into gear. Meanwhile, the contrast between rule-breaking, government-despising Wes and his daughter’s chosen profession is too clumsily drawn — Mickey laments his “bad ass reputation” and, at one point, abruptly throws something at Wes in frustration — to carry much weight. \n\n\tIn her quest to prove herself to the Edgewater electorate, Mickey is constantly professing her love for “this town” and its people. (To wit: “It’s not about me or you. It’s about this town!”; “I thought this town knew me”; “That’s your problem, Mickey — you’re too close to this town.”) But “Sheriff Country” struggles to instill that same affection in the audience. A subplot about the opioid crisis feels more like a prerequisite for any 2020s show about working-class America than a specific interest, and neither Mickey nor her deputies Cassidy (Michele Weaver) and Boone (Matt Lauria) distinguish themselves from so many TV cops past. If “Fire Country” really does have the makings of a full-blown franchise, they’re not on display here.\n\n\t“Sheriff Country” will premiere on CBS and Paramount+ at 9 p.m. ET, with subsequent episodes airing on Fridays at 8 p.m. ET.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLondoners are getting the chance to step into the world of Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein.”\n\n\tIn a fully immersive experience, the “Frankenstein: Crafting a Tale Eternal” exhibit is free to the public and now open through Nov. 9 at The Old Selfridges.\n\n\tIt’s no secret that del Toro has always wanted to bring Mary Shelley’s classic novel to life, and as audiences get to see his vision in theaters this weekend ahead of its Netflix release on Nov. 7, the director and his artisans gave Variety a tour of the exhibit.\n\t\n\n\t“Frankenstein: Crafting a Tale Eternal” showcases Kate Hawley’s costumes, production designer Tamara Deverell and prosthetics artist Mike Hill’s craftsmanship, as well as rare books.\n\n\tAmong the books on display were two editions of Shelley’s novel, including an 1818 copy and an 1853 illustrated version. Recalling reading Shelley’s book, del Toro told Variety, “She asked all the questions philosophical, economic and social that she felt troubled by.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNic Serpell-Rand\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDel Toro set his story against the backdrop of the Crimean War, but also wanted it to have a modern sensibility. Within that, he wanted the film to feel operatic. So, he turned to his most trusted collaborators, including Hawley, with whom he last worked on “Crimson Peak,” Deverell and composer Alexandre Desplat to inject life into “Frankenstein.”\n\n\tDiscussing the costumes, del Toro explained, “Elizabeth’s (Mia Goth) wardrobe represents nature. That’s why she connects with The Creature (Jacob Elordi) She represents the Holy and the natural world. So she’s either dressed in white, which is purity.”\n\t\n\n\tHe pointed out that Elizabeth’s blue dress ties her to science, and the embroidery design represents an X-ray. “This is storytelling. It’s not eye candy, it’s eye protein,” he said. “Everything in this movie is full-scale, handmade for humans by humans.” Even the lab explosion was pulled off using practical effects.\n\n\tHawley says she and Deverell collaborated closely, and her costumes echoed elements of the architecture and the environment. Red, blue and green were her main color palettes.\n\n\tWith the blue dress inspired by X-rays, Hawley explains the dress was going to be worn during an evening candlelight scene. Within that, she collaborated closely with the film’s cinematographer Dan Lausten to “keep the saturation of blue that Guillermo wanted.” She adds that candlelight often pulls colors out. “So, it took a huge amount of work to play with and how these prints and elements were going to work on different fabrics. \n\n\tHawley adds, “At least 60 meters [of fabric were used] in the skirt. That was all evoking the more ethereal nature of Elizabeth. When you first see her, she almost echoes an angel. She’s the angel of all things as well as death.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNic Serpell-Rand\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn display are some outfits worn by Oscar Isaac’s Victor Frankenstein. He wears rich velvets, which Hawley says are “old and worn.” Among the references del Toro and Hawley discussed was David Bowie. “Oscar mentioned Prince,” adds Hawley. Sculptors and painters, including Damien Hirst, Picasso and Francis Bacon, were influential to Hawley’s designs. She adds that Victor’s looks change to reflect the passage of time as he creates The Creature. “The clothes became more and more broken down, so you know this has been going on for days.”\n\n\tWhile the film’s ship, The Horisont, isn’t on display, photos and concept art capture the craftsmanship that went into building the vessel, showing the mighty task ahead.\n\n\tDeverell consulted with model ship builder Matthew Betts to ensure the historical accuracy of the build. In the end, the ship took six months to build, right down to the skylights, causeways, the steering wheel of the ship, the bell of the ship and its bow which measured over 130 feet long.\n\n\tDeverell explains, “We did build it on a giant gimbal that actually did the movement when The Creature pushes it.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNSR\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHer centerpiece is Frankenstein’s lab where the final stages of The Creature come to effect. Aside from the specially acquired wood that was sanded down to build the science lab tables, Deverell also talked about the motif and circles in the architecture. “One of the first things Guillermo presented was the Medusa in the circle,” she explained. “This circle theme that we have, which we’ll see throughout, you see it in the ship.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNic Serpell-Rand\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAdds del Toro, “The movie is a circle, and we use a lot of mirrors that are circles. And the circles work as a halo for Victor, because he starts telling the tale like a saint. You think you’re listening to Jesus, and then you realize you are listening to Charlie Manson.”\n\n\tComposer Desplat knew del Toro wanted to tell the story of Frankenstein and his creature. It was a matter of when. The duo who have collaborated on “The Shape of Water” and “Pinocchio,” began discussing the sound of the film over two years ago. Visitors to the exhibit can sit in a section and watch as Desplat and del Toro discuss the scoring process.  The heart of Desplat’s score lies in the sound of The Creature. Says Desplat, “We wanted the soul of the creature to be very delicate and fragile and it would move the audience. So we chose the smallest and more fragile and most beautiful instrument of a violin. This huge creature has a sound which is the pure and beautiful sound of classical instruments.” \n\n\tDesigning The Creature was an intricate process with various stages of its design incarnation on display. The key, Hill says, was to make the creature feel like he had stepped out of the “1800s and not a modern-day creature.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNic Serpell-Rand\n\t\n\n\n\n\tElordi spent 10 hours in the makeup chair to fully transform. Notably, The Creature is not made from a standard corpse color. “What we were trying to do was almost put the inside of a human body up on the outside for all to see. That’s why the veins are shown as clear as they are,” Hill says.\n\n\tThe final creature intricately shows how Victor has come together. “You see the patterns where Victor’s taken this apart and put it back on and decided that’s wrong. So he’s making a man for the first time, so he’s not getting entirely correct on the first go. There are a few patchworks, a few mistakes, and this is what this body’s showing. We created this body. So you can literally see him bolting the leg together and extending this man to make him taller than an average human,” says Hill. “What we decided is, if you were going to create a man, you wouldn’t go and get 10 bodies and someone together, what’s the point? You’d get the very best body you can get. And then say, ‘Okay, his hand is damaged in the war, so we have to replace the hand, his foot’s damaged. We have to replace it.”\n\t\n\n\tIn all, Elordi’s full body prosthetics used 42 pieces, with 14 pieces on his head and neck. Explaining the design concept and how Victor Frankenstein pieced The Creature together, Hill says, “On the whole, you choose the best body you could find. It just happened to be Jacob Elordi’s body.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNic Serpell-Rand\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Frankenstein” by the numbers:\n\n\t3 days shooting in ice fields of Northern Ontario23 locations in Canada32 UK set locations23 Ontario Set Locations9 long time del Toro collaborators119 sets24 Studio Sets3178 labour days to build the ship2830 labour days to build the lab1200 labour days to build the Tower exterior6 months to build the ship15 model sets created120 construction crew in Canada24 Set Decorating crew in Canada1252 Background costumes53 Stunt costumes68 unique costumes for main cast54 prosthetic silicon pieces to create creature8 people to apply the prostheticsProsthetics applied 50 times10 hours of application for the full body prosthetics \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNic Serpell-Rand\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNic Serpell-Rand\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNic Serpell-Rand\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNic Serpell-Rand\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNic Serpell-Rand\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTickets are free and can be booked via the Selfridges website.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 2025 BFI London Film Festival draws to a close this weekend with the U.K. premiere of feminist fantasy “100 Nights of Hero. Among the cast expected to bring some star-wattage to the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday night are Emma Corrin, Maika Monroe, Felicity Jones and Richard E. Grant.\n\n\tFor the many who have been charging around the British capital from premiere to screen talk to industry soiree for what now feels like months, “100 Nights of Hero” may well feel like a suitably apt title to conclude with. Indeed, while it has only been 12 days since Ryan Johnson, Daniel Craig, Andrew Scott, Cailee Spaeny, Kerry Washington and Mila Kunis helped open the festival with “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery,” the LFF schedule has felt more crowded with events than ever before. Debates have raged in the busy industry program, standby ticket queues have snaked outside venues for the hottest premieres and the stars — in their droves — have been out in force and on major charm offensives, with distributors using the fest to launch both awards and release campaigns.\n\t\n\n\tFrom the plethora of activity that’s been going on, Variety picks out its key takeaways from this year’s London Film Festival.\n\n\t\n\t\tWho needs world premieres?\t\n\n\tWhen the LFF lineup was first announced, the absence of high-profile world premieres was noticeable. The fest has never had the same draw as the likes of Cannes, Venice, Telluride or Toronto for landing the top-tier launches, but would occasionally punch above its weight with debuts of films such as Steve McQueen’s “Blitz,” “Matilda the Musical,” and “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio.” But this year it became very quickly apparent that it didn’t matter thanks to a program absolutely crammed with almost every major feature that’s been at every other festival. “Hamnet,” “Sentimental Value,” “Jay Kelly,” “Bugonia,” “Is This Thing On,” “Frankenstein,” “Blue Moon,” “Christy,” “It Was Just an Accident,” “No Other Choice,” “The Testament of Ann Lee,” “Train Dreams,” “After the Hunt,” “Hedda,” “Rental Family” and “The Voice of Hind Rajab” offered just a small taste of LFF’s 2025 menu, which showed that, while London may not get them first, it gets them all together — and with talent in tow. There’s good reason why LFF is now considered awards season’s international starter gun.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tStarry screen talks\t\n\n\tLFF more than delivered with a slew of star-studded Screen Talks this year, including with Yorgos Lanthimos, Richard Linklater and Chloé Zhao. But the programmers truly outdid themselves by booking none other than Daniel Day-Lewis, the elusive and hugely celebrated actor who returned to the screen after eight years in retirement to lead his son’s debut film, “Anemone.” And Day-Lewis’ conversation did not disappoint: the three-time best actor Oscar winner offered charming, sometimes rambling anecdotes from his most beloved films like “My Left Foot” and “The Boxer,” and even sounded off on criticism of his Method process. Audience members undoubtedly walked out of NFT1 feeling inspired, enchanted and eager to rewatch “Phantom Thread.”\n\t\n\t\tIt’s all been happening off-fest\t\n\n\tLFF is very much an event for the public, but away from the screenings, talks and red carpets, there’s been a whole world of festival-adjacent activity going on across the British capital’s luxury hotels, private clubs and bars — more so this year than ever before. Alongside countless tastemakers sessions, special screenings and Q&As put on for voters, AMPAS held its reception for new members, while the Golden Globes – a first-timer in 2024 – held a starry cocktail party at the Dorchester Hotel. Elsewhere, UTA and Vogue had a special soiree at legendary Italian restaurant Carbone’s new London outpost and Netflix didn’t just throw its annual brunch, but opened an entire exhibition for “Frankenstein” (and got Jacob Elordi and co to visit for its launch). But 2025 also sees a Cote D’Azur favorite mark its LFF debut. Better known for its sunnier festival galas at Cannes and Venice, amfAR lands in London for the first time on Friday night with a dinner and auction at the Chancery Rosewood hotel and local girl Joely Richardson on hosting duties. With U.K. temperatures having dropped noticeably over the last few weeks, guests will no doubt be overjoyed to hear it’s being held indoors. \n\t\n\t\tAI with a stiff upper lip\t\n\n\tAI quietly threaded through this year’s BFI London Film Festival, surfacing in both programming and debate. Damien Hauser’s “Memory of Princess Mumbi” used AI-generated landscapes to imagine a futuristic Africa, while “Future Botanica” invited audiences to co-create speculative ecosystems with generative visuals. The new LFF Expanded Industry Day spotlighted 11 projects spanning AI, XR and gaming, alongside a panel tracing depictions of artificial intelligence from “Metropolis” to “Ex Machina.” In her Variety interview, artistic director Kristy Matheson was asked whether she’d ever program a film starring an AI performer like Tilly Norwood — a fitting question, given that “London” is the AI actress’s supposed hometown. Yet compared with Bucheon, Busan, Shanghai and Tokyo — where AI is increasingly front and centre  — London’s approach remains measured, testing the waters rather than declaring a full-blown embrace.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tMoviegoing Etiquette in the Spotlight\t\n\n\tSocial media was abuzz this edition with grievances about some audience members’ cinema etiquette — a matter that escalated when the festival clarified in its Oct. 13 bulletin that “the use of phones and laptops” during press and industry screenings was “permitted for notetaking.” “FFS! Film festivals are typically one of the few places where I don’t have to tell people to put away their phones during screenings,” one X user lamented, while another said they’d noticed more “tension in the air” in general, reporting “exasperated and/or rude audiences, arguments about to break out, lots of shushing.” Indeed, everyone may need to calm down.\n",

They’re just suggestions. Suggestions that get our sons and daughters killed.\"\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          BTW, we've heard all this \"warrior ethos\" BS before ... our own Harvey Levin called Hegseth's invocation of it when the Pentagon renamed the United States Naval Ship Harvey Milk back in June homophobic -- and, he postulated there may be a ban on gays in the military next.\n      \n    \n          Also worth noting, \"Boots\" is adapted from the memoir \"The Pink Marine\" by Greg Cope White -- who clearly had more than enough \"warrior ethos\" to serve six years in the military.\n      \n    \n          Clearly, the Department of (Culture) War is back up to its old tricks.\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

'cause it's obviously taken on a lot more meaning since we broke the story he and Nicole decided to call it quits.\n      \n    \n          As you know ... Keith and Nicole separated during the summer -- our sources say it was Keith's decision while Nicole still wanted to make it work -- and, NK filed for divorce a day or so after the news broke.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Keith's back on tour now ... though he's changed lyrics in at least one of his songs related to Kidman. Social media sleuths blamed Maggie Baugh -- a fill-in guitarist on Urban's tour earlier this year -- for the split, claiming there might be something romantic between them ... though neither of them have come out publicly and admitted they're togeher.\n      \n    \n          Anyhoo ... a musician's life is clearly tough on everyone in their orbit -- even true love doesn't always survive it.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Nicole Kidman\n              \n                          \n                Keith Urban\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Interview\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Divorce\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Nicole Kidman Keith Urban Divorce\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

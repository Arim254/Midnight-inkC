    "body": "\n\tPeter Greene, who often played villains and criminals including Zed in Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction,” was found dead in his New York apartment on Friday. He was 60.\n\n\tHis manager Gregg Edwards told NBC News he was found in his apartment on the Lower East Side. \n\n\tIn the Jim Carrey movie “The Mask” the same year, Greene played the villain Dorian Tyrell. \n\n\n\tHis role as the sadistic security guard Zed in “Pulp Fiction” became one of his most memorable.\n\t\n\n\t“Nobody played a bad guy better than Peter,” Edwards told NBC. “But he also had, you know, a gentle side that most people never saw, and a heart as big as gold.”\n\n\tBorn in Montclair, N.J., Greene trained at Lee Strasberg’s studio and had his first major role in the indie “Laws of Gravity” in 1992. The next year, Lodge Kerrigan cast his as the lead in “Clean Shaven,” which brought him to Tarantino’s attention.\n\n\tHe went on to appear in nearly 100 films and TV shows, including a recurring role on the series “For Life,” and appearances in “Chicago P.D.,” “Hawaii Five-O,” “Justified” and “Life on Mars.”\n\n\tOn “The Black Donnellys,” he had a recurring role as Derek “Dokey” Farrell.\n",

    "body": "\n\tClear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose.\n\n\tThe “Friday Night Lights” rallying cry has certainly proven true for Michael B. Jordan and Jesse Plemons. After the beloved high school football TV series concluded in 2011, Jordan starred in Ryan Coogler’s 2013 debut feature, “Fruitvale Station.” The pair stuck together, making two “Black Panther” movies and three “Creed” movies before 2025’s “Sinners.” The film, in which Jordan plays identical twins in a vampire-infested Jim Crow South, was a massive critical and commercial success.\n\t\n\n\tPlemons went on to do more TV — notably “Breaking Bad,” “Fargo” and “Black Mirror” — and films like “Game Night,” “The Power of the Dog” and “Killers of the Flower Moon.” This year, he stars in his second Yorgos Lanthimos film, “Bugonia,” as Teddy, a conspiracy theorist who kidnaps a Big Pharma CEO (Emma Stone) in an attempt to stop aliens from taking over the world. It’s a bizarre role, but a perfect one for Plemons, who has played several outcasts and weirdos in his career as an indie film mainstay.\n\n\n\tJordan and Plemons haven’t crossed paths much since “Friday Night Lights,” but they’ve been rooting for each other from afar. As they reunite, they discuss working with one director multiple times, how music influences their performances and their awe at each other’s success.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMichael B. Jordan: Decades later, the universe brought us together once again, man.\n\n\tJesse Plemons: The last time I saw you was probably for about two minutes at one of these industry parties. But man.\n\t\n\n\tJordan: In my mind, I’m going back to Austin, Texas as the last time that we had a real convo. Without all the bells and whistles.\n\n\tPlemons: These last few days, so many memories have been flooding back. We were kids. We did not know that. We thought we were grown — speaking for myself.\n\n\tJordan: No, no, very accurate. “Friday Night Lights” days. You’re like the original. The OG cast. I’m the new edition that popped in.\n\n\tPlemons: Yeah, but we needed it. After Season 2, we needed some new blood. These last few days, knowing I was going to see you, I’ve just been thinking about all the good times. Been thinking about 24 Hour Fitness basketball games.\n\n\tJordan: You’re a sleeper. People don’t understand that. You’re very athletic, and you got a shot, bro. You hoop. You can definitely play ball.\n\n\tPlemons: I don’t know about that. But I’m the guy that you suspect you don’t need to worry about, and then if I have a very open shot with no one in front of me —\n\n\tJordan: Come on, man. I can’t let you do that. It’s more like “White Men Can’t Jump.”\n\n\tPlemons: I definitely cannot. Or run.\n\n\t“Friday Night Lights” changed my relationship to acting. Peter Berg really put all the responsibility on us to make these characters our own. What aspects of working on that show do you feel like you’ve taken with you?\n\n\tJordan: First of all, I was so anxious joining the show, because you guys were already established. Everybody had such a great relationship, and like the new kid going into a new school, you felt like the outsider. But at that first cast dinner where everybody introduced themselves and welcomed us into the team, all that washed away. You got somebody like Kyle Chandler standing up and talking through the experience of what it’s like to work on the show, and you don’t quite get it until you show up and you got somebody like Peter Berg yelling at the camera— “All right, turn left!” — tofind certain shots while we’re in the middle of a take. The idea of always being on and prepared to adapt and improv, I definitely take that with me.\n\n\tPlemons: That show felt like anarchy, especially for a network television show. I remember the trepidation: “Do we really have this space and this freedom?” And slowly it just becomes a game. That show taught me that really good work can come out of that sense of play and exploration. So many times, I was just trying to break the other actor. It’s just a game.\n\t\n\n\tNext: What the hell, Mike? What happened?\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJordan: We grew up! Look at you, man. You’re a whole father of two, and a husband and a phenomenal actor, bro. I’m so proud of you, man. You take on these characters, and a lot of them feel like outsiders. How do you find the relatability to some of these characters?\n\n\tPlemons: It’s hard to say if I’m seeking them out, or if it’s just that’s how directors see me fitting in. I don’t think too often about throughlines between characters, but I suppose there have been a string of characters that are difficult to classify in terms of good and bad. I’ve been drawn to characters that take some time to figure out, and are not easily pegged and understood. Because that’s my experience with most people. A lot of people could be going through a whole world inside that you have no idea about.\n\n\tJordan: The connection between Yorgos Lanthimos and yourself, how did that manifest?\n\n\tPlemons: I received a call from my agent and friend, Brandy, who’s just right over there.\n\n\tJordan: What’s up, Brandy?\n\n\tPlemons: She told me, “Yorgos Lanthimos has a script that he wants you to read.” I was very shocked that he had any idea who I was. I read the script for “Kinds of Kindness,” and was highly perplexed, but also felt like I had been through kind of an emotional roller coaster. Then, there I am. In his rehearsal process, he makes up games for actors. It’s all very silly. It helps to build trust. The first few days just left me feeling extremely lost.\n\n\tJordan: A little vulnerable?\n\n\tPlemons: Yeah. But it takes some of the reverence off of the material, and immediately tunes you into the other actors. Then, starting “Bugonia” — as you know, working with Ryan Coogler — you feel like you have a headstart when you’ve worked with someone. You don’t have to overexplain anything. There’s trust that allows you to take the leap, which is where the good stuff usually comes from.\n\n\tI watched “Sinners” on the plane ride from Venice to Telluride. Was blown away. That movie, on a box office level and on an artistic level, truly gave the entire industry a sense of hope. You’d probably follow Ryan Coogler almost anywhere, but where do you start when you’re preparing to play two characters?\n\n\tJordan: Playing two characters — identical twins at that — there was a lot of nerves. Wiping all that away, it was like, “Lemme just focus on building out from their childhood trauma forward. How did that kind of manifest in each brother differently?” One’s a bit more internal with his pain. He doesn’t say a lot. The other one masks his pain in his charisma and charm. He smiles through it. Understanding that those are two sides of me also helped.\n\t\n\n\tAnd diving into things that are tangible. I wore shoes that were too small for Stack because I liked him antsy, and not really being able to sit still. Smoke, a size too big. He didn’t move as much. It all started to take shape, with Ryan being the perfect North Star for where the story’s going.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPlemons: It makes me nervous just thinking about stepping on set like, “Here we go. Acting with myself. Hope I don’t suck two times!” They both felt so lived in. You managed to differentiate them just enough without it turning into some actor show. It was a true, internal difference in both of them.\n\n\tJordan: With Teddy — you mind if I call him Teddy?\n\n\tPlemons: You can call him Teddy. Teddy Bear.\n\n\tJordan: Teddy Bear. Bro, my jaw dropped, because you think you know where it’s going, but you don’t. The first time you’re watching it, you’re like, “This guy really believes something that’s not real, but to him it’s clearly real.” Did you ever feel especially challenged to believe what Teddy believed?\n\n\tPlemons: Yeah. There’s a lot of very specific dialogue based on all of Teddy’s research and obsession. I knew nothing works in the movie if I don’t believe these words as they’re coming out of my mouth. There’s a period of time when you get a job — the best feeling in the world. Then when it’s time to start, for me, it’s always this sinking feeling like, “Now I have to do this.”\n\n\tBut for some reason, I felt like I understood his core. As twisted as his methods are, there’s this feeling in modern times where the world seems to be a scary place, and there are a lot of amazing people out there that want to help. It’s like, “Where do you direct this energy?” Teddy had that to an overwhelming degree. In his mind, in the story that he was telling himself, he’s the hero. We all have how we see ourselves, and then there’s objective reality, but as an actor, that objective reality didn’t matter.\n\n\tJordan: That was the slimmest and cuttest [I’ve seen you]. He rode a bike. He got his miles in. Was there anything to that physique that made Teddy feel very specific for you?\n\n\tPlemons: I imagined him as this wiry creature of the forest that was just hungry and scraping by. You talked about your boots being too small, and that being a choice. Mine were too. It’s funny how those little things can really lock you in. Playing Smoke and Stack, aside from wardrobe, was there any other technique that helped you differentiate them? I struggle multitasking, so that seems like chaos in my head.\n\t\n\n\tJordan: It’s organized chaos. You have a limited amount of time. We’re shooting on film. So being as prepared as much as possible was super important. I would do a few [takes] as one brother, and then a few as the other. The time that I would go to my trailer and change would be my time to unravel one and build the other one up. Music was really helpful to listen to as I took off a piece of clothing and put another one on. And I took off my gold caps, which naturally hold my mouth differently and [affect] how I speak. You’re listening to the music and going through key phrases, running myself through that brother’s perspective of what got them to that day.\n\n\tPlemons: You must’ve been working with an actor that was standing in for whatever brother you weren’t playing.\n\n\tJordan: A twin double. Unsung hero. In a typical scene, I would show up and run it as the other brother first to let him know exactly where I would be. I had to predetermine my choices as the other brother, and then I would do a second rehearsal as the brother I would start out with. The constant direction that I would have to give my twin double — where I needed my other brother to be for continuity, eyelines — that was the most chaotic part of it. Then I would flip to the other side. Whatever brother went first set the rules. We couldn’t occupy the same space.\n\n\tDo you listen to a lot of music preparing for roles?\n\n\tPlemons: I make playlists that are way, way too long for every project. And now Kirsten [Dunst] asks me to make playlists for her. I like to make very long playlists, put it on shuffle and just see where it takes me. Anything that can get you out of [your head], because it’s a fine line between preparation, making sure no stone is left unturned, and then, “That’s enough thinking. It’s just time to jump in and see what happens.”\n\n\tWe were fortunate as well that Jerskin Fendrix, our composer, had written the entire score before we started. Yorgos decided with this movie that he didn’t want the composer to read the script, and he didn’t want him to visit set. He decided to give him five words and to see what he came up with: “bees,” “basement,” “spaceship,” “Emma bald.” He said, “All right, go on your way. Come back with a score.” And it was brilliant.\n\t\n\n\tWe’ve known each other for a long time. I wonder, “Friday Night Lights” days or even before then, who were your heroes?\n\n\tJordan: I always feel bad, because I didn’t look up to a lot of people as a kid. My parents was my bar of how to do things. And I think having the name Michael Jordan as a kid affected things in a way that, in hindsight, I can talk about. But in the moment, I didn’t really understand. Your name is important. It’s how you introduce yourself and how the world responds to you. But when there’s another guy out there who’s the guy, I think it created a healthy chip [on my shoulder]. Wanting to be competitive. Wanting your own identity in a way. I wanted to be great at something, and I didn’t know what it was going to be. I just wanted to be great at it.\n\n\tPlemons: Did you ever ask your parents why?\n\n\tJordan: My dad’s name is Michael Jordan.\n\n\tPlemons: He was probably around the same age?\n\n\tJordan: My dad’s older than Mike. So I had no shot.\n\n\tPlemons: So it was not their fault. It’s just the way the stars aligned.\n\n\tJordan: It was all meant to be, real talk.\n\n\tPlemons: It’s funny that you’re talking about this chip. The other Michael Jordan is notorious for using that chip as well. It’s working for both of y’all.\n\n\tJordan: He’s Michael A. I’m Michael B. Look, man. We can’t wait another two decades to do this again.\n\n\tPlemons: I know. Congratulations on everything. It feels like someone from my high school is out there doing amazing things. When good people do great things, it feels like a win for everyone. So happy for you. So proud of you. Keep at it. Can’t wait to see what’s next.\n\n\tJordan: Likewise, bro. Come here, bro. [They hug.] Big time, bro. Great talking with you. I got to get your number, man. We got to stay in touch, bro.This is a conversation from Variety and CNN’s Actors on Actors.

    "body": "\n\tLast year, the Last Word hospitality team was all set to open Chez Renée in the Malibu spot that formerly housed La La Cabana and Giorgio’s. But fate had other ideas, and the historic former sheriff’s station on Pacific Coast Highway burned in the Palisades-Malibu fire in January. \n\n\tNow co-founders Holly Fox and Adam Weisblatt are paying tribute to that concept at their new restaurant Hermon’s, with the Ode to Chez cheeseburger, a decadent patty topped with soubise fondue and bordelaise onions on a sesame milk bun. It’s just one of the elevated but approachable dishes on the menu of the first serious restaurant ever to open in the tiny neighborhood of Hermon in Northeast Los Angeles. Where is Hermon? Tucked along the Arroyo Parkway between South Pasadena, Highland Park and Montecito Heights, it’s a mostly residential area that was crying out for a place to get a well-made cocktail and a plate of steak frites. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLoaded potato fritter with bacon, chives and parmesan at Hermon’s \n\t\n\n\n\n\tLast Word operates several of the area’s hottest restaurants, including Portuguese wine bar Barra Santos  in Glassell Park, Queen St. Raw Bar & Grill in Eagle Rock and Found Oyster in East Hollywood. Weisblatt lives in nearby South Pasadena, and had his eye on the former church banquet hall along Monterey Road for several years. While the fire was a harsh setback, it paved the way for Hermon’s, which locals are already welcoming as an addition to the sometimes overly-trendy NELA dining scene.\n\n\n\tHermon’s is almost resolutely anti-trendy: It stakes its claim as a grown-up restaurant, with large half-circle booths, an appealing u-shaped bar and a selection of eclectic art lining the walls. The mission-style dark wood furnishings and tiled bar almost look like they’ve been since Musso & Frank set the city’s dining style and ostriches and lions roamed the nearby movie studios and tourist attractions. \n\t\n\n\tDespite its vintage feel, chef David Kolender’s American bistro-style menu is full of creative touches that situate the restaurant firmly in the modern era. Even the marinated olives zing with orange, fennel and chili flakes, while scallop crudo and panzanella salad also showcase citrus flavors. Steak frites is a classic rendition with perfectly-done fries and a horseradish mayo. While the menu is still growing, mains also include a nightly pasta dish, whole grilled branzino and mushroom bourguignon. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tScallop crudo at Hermon’s\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHowever you order, you will want to start with the garlic bread for the table — a whole round spelt loaf is doused in garlic butter and sure to be instantly devoured. Pair it with a Tiny Tini – the perfect petite cocktail for light drinkers, at just $9; a walnut old-fashioned or the fruit daiquiri of the day. Welcome to Hermon!\n\n\tHermon’s, 5800 Monterey Road, Los Angeles\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story discusses major plot developments, including the ending, in “Wake Up Dead Man,” currently streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tAbout mi",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story discusses major plot developments, including the ending, in “Wake Up Dead Man,” currently streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tAbout midway through “Wake Up Dead Man,” the buzz of activity and intrigue around the murder of a small-town priest slows down — way down.\n\n\tAt first, it seems like an inconvenience. Rev. Jud Duplenticy (Josh O’Connor), the prime suspect in the murder of his former colleague Msgr. Jefferson Wicks (Josh Brolin), is trying to suss out information from a small-town construction company clerk. Someone had ordered construction be done on the mausoleum in which Wicks would eventually be interred; finding out who’d made the call might move the investigation forward, and bring Jud closer to clearing his own name. The clerk (Bridget Everett), over the phone, pauses and asks Jud to pray for her. \n\t\n\n\tHer name is Louise, and she’s concerned that she will have ended her relationship with her mother on bad terms. Mom has a brain tumor which is affecting her personality, and Louise said unkind things the last time that they spoke — out of pain and misplaced grief and, we suspect even as Louise does not say, fear. Jud seems, suddenly, at ease. He’s hardly pleased to be ministering to a woman in crisis, but he knows the words to say. He knows the things to do. He accepts that he will not be getting the information he needs in the moment, and instead tells Louise that, however she may feel, she is not alone. He leads her in prayer. It’s a small relief for Louise, and for Jud: And, for the first time in this surprisingly profound meditation on faith and alienation, he is able to actually do his job.\n\t\n\n\tEach film in the “Knives Out” franchise, of which this is the third installment, has spotlit one character as a sort of exemplar. In “Knives Out” proper, Ana de Armas’ Marta is so unremittingly honest that she literally cannot stomach a lie; in “Glass Onion,” Janelle Monáe plays a double role, one twin sister, Andi, a thwarted and cheated genius and the other, Helen, a low-key but determined avenging angel. Here, though, O’Connor’s Jud is fully at the center of the frame, intriguingly pushing detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) to the story’s margins. And his small-scale moment of grace illuminates the contours of writer-director Rian Johnson’s most complicated and enigmatic mystery yet.\n\n\tJud emerges as a character gradually. We first meet him as he’s exiled to the small-town parish of Chimney Rock, N.Y., a punishment after he assaults a fellow man of the cloth. That flash of impulse, that capacity for quick-flaring violence, makes for a deceptive introduction, though: We’re told, later, that as a young boxer, Jud killed a man in the ring, and we’re shown, through O’Connor’s glimmeringly alive performance, that he works every day to earn redemption. This is the work he thought he’d be doing every day as a priest. But assigned to assist Wicks, a demagogue whose politically-charged sermons are designed to alienate all but the loyalists he soaks for money and for attention, Jud feels further from his purpose. One might say he feels further, too, from God’s light. Wicks’ death is a crisis for Jud. He knows he didn’t do it. But because he felt some measure of gratitude that it happened… Well, isn’t that just as bad?\n\n\tJohnson has, throughout his career, been deeply engaged by the question of what it means to be good and do good; the venal amorality of a wealthy family of ne’er-do-wells, in the first “Knives Out,” and a friend group of archcapitalist socialites, in “Glass Onion,” place Marta and Helen’s rectitude into sharper relief. Setting a “Knives Out” story in a literal church community might seem to push the point farther than it need go: We get it, Rian. \n\n\tThe mastery of this movie, if not the best of the franchise (it feels that way right now, but time shall tell), then certainly the one that most effectively shifts between tones, is in what the Catholics refer to as “the mystery of faith.” Unlike the squabbling family members or avaricious frenemies of the first two films, Jud’s fellow-suspects in this go-around aren’t, per se, bad people. They have, though, been badly misled. And that means there is a chance for them to be brought back to the path. Unfortunately, Jud scarcely has time to do it, what with needing to help solve a crime and all. But shining through this installment of what can be a caustically cynical franchise is a belief not in inherent human goodness but in the potential to overcome our lesser impulses. Jud wakes up most days — one bad day, at the start of the film, aside — and manages to keep his fists down. \n\t\n\n\tO’Connor illuminates this for us in a performance that builds greatness out of endless small moments: Tamped-down frustration at his treatment by Wicks, an overeagerness to connect with parishioners who don’t care about his message of love and unity. And, crucially, a willingness to stop his investigation — and the movie that investigation centers around — dead in its tracks, in order to try and help someone. Later in the film, when Everett’s character calls Jud on the phone to share who it was who ordered the construction, a major plot development feels surprisingly inconsequential as the tone of her voice comes through. She sounds lighter, at ease, as if some small measure of trouble had been taken off of her mind. (Credit to Everett, who, in a movie of consistently though not universally strong performances, stands out for giving a performance of only a few minutes’ duration.) The Louise phone call scene starts to feel like the photo negative of the eerie and off-putting Mike Yanagita scene in “Fargo”: An off-topic aside that opens up the movie’s themes and its story. \n\n\tAt the film’s conclusion, as Glenn Close’s barnburning final confession makes clear what many attentive viewers will have kind of suspected — that she masterminded the whole thing. But a certain fundamental open-heartedness leavens the proceedings. You hire Glenn Close to play a church lady who plots a murder so that she can Glenn Close it up, and there is true pleasure in watching this latest in her late-career chances to cut loose, to let fly her motives and her resentments. (Her tainted saintliness here would make “Wake Up Dead Man” an ideal double-feature with her Satanic turn in 2024’s “The Deliverance.”)\n\n\tBut something keeps the moment from becoming so big that it subsumes the movie. And that’s Jud’s patience and care. He wants her confession not merely — maybe not at all — so that he’s cleared of the crime. He wants it because he wants her soul to be easy, because she is a human being struggling with guilt and because, after months at this parish, he sees the ways in which the parish’s history of pitting the faithful against one another set her up to fail from her earliest days. There’s always a chance for redemption, even at the end. We know he believes this, because we saw him try to redeem Louise’s relationship with her mother in its final days — and because he felt that good deed would redeem Jud himself, as he presumed his life as a free man was ending. That the case is cracked seems to Jud simply not to matter. He has bigger things on his mind. \n\t\n\n\tAnd as a character study and as a story of what it might take — not necessarily religious faith, but a belief in a project bigger than one’s own immediate interests — so does “Wake Up Dead Man.” That eye on something larger takes it from earthbound sleuth story to something that, in its best moments, edges up to the divine.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tAbraham Quintanilla Jr., the patriarch who helped shape the career of his daughter, Tejano superstar Selena, and remained the steward of her legacy for three decades after her death, has died. He was 86.\n\n\tThe news was announced Saturday morning by his son, A.B. Quintanilla III, who shared a photo of his father on Instagram and wrote, “It’s with a heavy heart to let you guys know that my Dad passed away today.” A cause of death was not immediately disclosed.\n\t\n\n\tBorn Feb. 22, 1939, in Corpus Christi, Texas, Quintanilla was raised in a Mexican American family and began his own music career as a teenager. In 1956, he joined the vocal group the Dinos, gaining early experience as a singer and songwriter before leaving the band in the late 1960s to focus on raising a family.\n\n\n\tThat decision would ultimately redirect the course of Latin music history. After recognizing the vocal talent of his youngest child, Selena Quintanilla-Pérez, Abraham formed Selena y Los Dinos, a family band that also included siblings A.B. and Suzette Quintanilla. Serving as manager and guiding force, Quintanilla navigated the challenges of the male-dominated Tejano circuit, booking shows, shaping the group’s image and overseeing every aspect of their development.\n\n\tBy the late 1980s, Selena y Los Dinos had become a dominant force in Tejano music, paving the way for Selena’s crossover success and her emergence as one of the most celebrated Latin music artists of all time.\n\n\tQuintanilla’s life — and the music world — would be shattered on March 31, 1995, when Selena was murdered at age 23 by Yolanda Saldívar, the former president of Selena’s fan club and manager of her boutiques, “Selena Etc.” In the aftermath of the tragedy, Quintanilla became the chief guardian of Selena’s artistic and cultural legacy.\n\t\n\n\tHe served as an executive producer on the 1997 biographical film “Selena,” in which he was portrayed by Edward James Olmos,  and his daughter was played by Jennifer Lopez. Abraham remained closely involved in virtually every album release, documentary and tribute project connected to his daughter’s life and work. In the 2020 Netflix miniseries “Selena: The Series,” Quintanilla was portrayed by Ricardo Chavira.\n\n\tIn November of this year, Netflix released a new documentary about Selena Quintanilla called “Selena y Los Dinos: A Family’s Legacy,” an intimate look into her rise with her family band, using never-before-seen home videos and family archives.\n\n\tSoon after Selena’s death, Quintanilla and his family founded the Selena Foundation, a charitable organization dedicated to helping children in crisis. Through his record company, Q-Productions, he continued to produce and mentor new talent in music and film.\n\n\tIn 2021, Quintanilla released his memoir, “A Father’s Dream: My Family’s Journey in Music.”\n\n\tThough frequently a polarizing figure, Abraham Quintanilla remained a central architect of Selena’s rise and an unyielding advocate for her legacy.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLaKeith Stanfield is set to play NBA legend Dennis Rodman in Lionsgate’s “48 Hours in Vegas,” taking over the role after Jonathan Majors was dropped from the film following his 2023 assault conviction.\n\n\tThe upcoming comedy is “inspired by the untold story of Dennis Rodman’s legendary trip to Las Vegas during the 1998 NBA Finals — just as the Rodman’s Chicago Bulls are on the verge of completing their second consecutive threepeat championship in eight years,” according to a release. \n\t\n\n\tRick Famuyiwa (“The Mandalorian,” “Ahsoka”) will direct “48 Hours in Vegas” and write the next draft of the screenplay, following an earlier draft by Jordan VanDina.\n\n\n\tThe film will be produced by Lord Miller’s Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and Aditya Sood. Executive producers include Ari Lubet, Rodman and Lucy Kitada, with Nikki Baida serving as co-producer. Meredith Wieck and Pavan Kalidindi will oversee the project for Lionsgate, while Robert Melnik negotiated the deals on behalf of the studio.\n\n\t“I’m genuinely excited to help create an exhilarating, joyful work that both honors and thoughtfully examines the legacy of Rodman and fellow trailblazers,” Stanfield said in a statement. “Those who moved to the beat of their own drum, undeterred by the obstacles placed before them, then and now.” \n\n\tStanfield received an Oscar nomination for his performance in 2021’s “Judas and the Black Messiah.” He is known for roles in films including “The Book of Clarence,” “Sorry to Bother You” and “Get Out,” as well as the FX dramedy series “Atlanta.” He most recently appeared in “Roofman” and “Die My Love,” and will next be seen in “I Love Boosters.” Stanfield is represented by CAA, Stark Management and Ginsburg Daniels Kallis.\n\t\n\n\t“Dennis Rodman is more than a basketball player, more than a personality—he’s an entire cultural phenomenon. His bold style and physical presence, combined with an iconic persona, created a larger-than-life impact on and off the court,” said Erin Westerman, president of Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. “There’ll never be another like him. LaKeith and the incredibly talented team on this film will bring the legend to life in this most extraordinarily unbelievable story.”\n\n\tMajors was previously attached to the Rodman film until he was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of harassment and assault stemming from a domestic dispute with his former partner. He was sentenced in April 2024 to one year of domestic violence counseling.\n\n\tInsneider was first to report the casting news. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAs Dick Van Dyke turns 100 and celebrates six Emmys over more than seven decades in the TV trenches, it’s hard to imagine there was a time before he was a national treasure. The fledgling funny man was no overnight success — before his first big break, Van Dyke shlepped his growing family across the country several times while touring comedy clubs and working in local TV.\n\n\tAfter gigs in Hollywood and Atlanta, Van Dyke landed in New Orleans to emcee an early comedy program. Television was becoming big business in the mid-1950s, and CBS was searching far and wide for new comic talent to fill its growing schedule on both coasts. But network reps reported to Variety that “searching parties have turned up little of long range promise.” Except in the Big Easy — where the network discovered “a comic named Dick Van Dyke” who will “get the full grooming treatment,” reported a 1955 column in Daily Variety.\n\t\n\n\tVan Dyke left New Orleans and ended up with a seven-year CBS contract, becoming the joke-cracking host of “The Morning Show” with Walter Cronkite as his co-anchor. The talented comic was also a song and dance man, who then moved seamlessly from the news desk to Broadway, where he won a Tony for his role in “Bye Bye Birdie,” then reprised it on film. “Van Dyke displays a showbiz knowhow far more extensive than his television outings communicate,” Variety wrote in its 1962 review.\n\n\n\tThat assessment might have undersold Van Dyke’s starring role in “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” which became an all-time top sitcom over its five seasons on CBS. After the 1960 pilot, starring creator Carl Reiner as Rob Petrie, didn’t quite land, producer Sheldon Leonard wanted to try a different comic actor, and Van Dyke won the title role over Johnny Carson. \n\t\n\n\t“The Dick Van Dyke Show” took a while to fully find its footing. CBS canceled the sitcom after one season when it had trouble competing with “The Perry Como Show,” but summer re-runs brought in new fans, and the network changed its mind and ordered a second season. \n\n\t“A funny thing happened that second season when Mary and I went back to work,” Van Dyke recounts in “My Lucky Life In and Out of Showbiz,” his first memoir. “We couldn’t stop giggling when we were around each other.” Van Dyke consulted a psychiatrist friend who broke the news to him that Rob had a crush on Laura Petrie. “Who didn’t adore Mary?” he wrote, “If we had been different people, maybe something would have happened.”\n\n\tDespite the show nabbing Emmy noms for writing and directing in season one, Van Dyke and co-star Mary Tyler Moore weren’t nominated until the second season. Each finally won acting trophies for the third.\n\n\tThose 1964 Emmys unfolded under strange circumstances. CBS (and ABC) had threatened to boycott the proceedings, as the networks were unhappy with certain Emmys rules and practices. But the Eye network’s “Dick Van Dyke Show” show swept anyway with five awards, and Van Dyke tearfully accepted his first trophy, saying “I’m crying, I don’t believe this.”\n\n\tDuring the 1960s, the Emmys lumped together comedy and drama performances, so Van Dyke competed against the likes of serious actors like George C. Scott in “East Side/West Side” and David Janssen in “The Fugitive.”\n\n\tAfter the ceremony, Van Dyke told Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd that he felt “out of place” competing with dramatic actors, and that for his next film, he’d like to be offered a “heavy” role.\n\n\tBut that didn’t happen. \n\n\tInstead, Van Dyke decided he preferred family movies and was cast in dual parts alongside Julie Andrews in Walt Disney’s massive hit “Mary Poppins.” Making the children’s book adaptation, packed with memorable Sherman Brothers tunes, seems like a no-brainer now, but at the time it was considered a gamble. Variety reported in a 1963 article headlined “‘Mary Poppins’ Disney Coin Risk” that it was Disney’s biggest-budget production to date at $6 million, and that the studio was keeping a tight lid on publicity until the time was right. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews in “Mary Poppins”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe risk paid off: It became the year’s most profitable film and Van Dyke’s rendition of “Chim Chim Cher-ee” won the Oscar for best song. “Mary Poppins” remains a beloved classic 60 years later, but Van Dyke’s Cockney chimney sweep dialogue went down in history as one of the worst movie accents ever. It may have even cost him the role of James Bond, which Van Dyke reportedly turned down because he was too embarrassed to play an Englishman again (for “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,” from Bond producer Cubby Broccoli, he sounded like the American he was).\n\t\n\n\tHe finally got the chance to play a “heavy” part as an alcoholic businessman in the Emmy-nominated 1974 TV movie “The Morning After.” After it aired, Van Dyke revealed that he had recently become sober after 25 years of struggling with alcohol. \n\n\tVan Dyke’s career continued to prosper for many more decades, notably with eight seasons of 1990s detective show “Diagnosis: Murder,” an appearance in “Mary Poppins Returns” at the age of 93 and a new record as the oldest competitor on “The Masked Singer” at 97. \n\n\tBut that wasn’t his final act. In 2024, Coldplay released a music video directed by Spike Jonze, “All My Love,” that was a combination Van Dyke family reunion, career retrospective and duet with Chris Martin. And the personal appearances have continued to this day, featuring his always-sunny outlook.\n\n\t“Hope is life’s essential nutrient, and love is what gives life meaning. As corny as it sounds, I think my decision to stick with entertainment the whole family could see was made with that in mind,” Van Dyke wrote in his memoir. “I’m proud that I kept it clean, that I stood for something, and upheld values.”\n\n\t***\n\n\tHere’s a vintage Variety advertisement from the June 29, 1965, edition of Daily Variety highlighting Dick Van Dyke signing to star in the comedy film released in 1967 as “Fitzwilly.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA vintage Variety advertisement from the June 29, 1965, edition of Daily Variety\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 30th International Film Festival of Kerala opened Friday in Thiruvananthapuram, India, with a politically charged and internationally focused ceremony led by Chilean filmmaker Pablo Larraín, the ambassadors of Palestine and Germany, and Canadian director Kelly Fyffe-Marshall, who received this year’s Spirit of Cinema Award. \n\n\tKerala’s Minister for Culture Saji Cherian formally inaugurated the edition, which marked the festival’s three-decade legacy with film launches, book releases and tributes.\n\t\n\n\tFestival executive director C. Ajoy welcomed the guests by tracing IFFK’s journey from its beginnings to what he called “the strongest cultural edifice of Kerala.” He acknowledged the many “unknown names” who had shaped the festival and reaffirmed Kerala’s solidarity with global struggles, including Palestine.\n\n\n\tDelivering the inaugural address, Minister Saji Cherian emphasized the festival’s scale and its social purpose, noting the participation of 82 countries and more than 200 films. He underscored cinema’s role in resisting oppressive tendencies and referenced a much-loved Malayalam actor – a sexual assault survivor – as a symbol of that spirit, and positioning her as an emblem of courage. Cherian framed IFFK’s identity as one rooted in solidarity and artistic freedom, calling it “the most important promotion for the film” ecosystem of Kerala.\n\n\tFestival chief guest Larraín, attending IFFK for the first time, praised the selection and the audience. “I’ve never been to India before. I’m very pleased. I’m very impressed seeing all of you beautiful people here,” he said. After reviewing the festival catalog, he singled out the region’s defining openness: “the curiosity that you have for different cultures around the world.” He urged the festival to “stay curious… because cinema is probably the only way to look at the past and the present and eventually, the future.”\n\t\n\n\tGerman Ambassador Philipp Ackerman commended the festival’s stature and Kerala’s film culture. Calling IFFK “one of the great festivals now,” he highlighted the presence of 25 German productions or co-productions in the program this year, including Fatih Akin’s new World War II-era film “Amrum” and the German-Czech-Polish biographical drama “Franz,” Germany’s Oscar submission. He recalled Kerala’s previous honors for Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders and traced the state’s moniker “God’s own country” to German missionary Hermann Gundert, who developed the first Malayalam-language dictionary.\n\n\tThe evening’s most charged address came from Palestinian Ambassador Abdullah M. Abu Shawesh, who spoke about the significance of opening IFFK with the Palestinian feature “Palestine 36.” “Tonight, through cinema, a small window open into the soul of my people,” he said, thanking Kerala for its “unequivocal support to the cause of Palestine.” He described a long history in which Palestinians were “never given a platform,” arguing that the film represents an essential correction of historical record. “It is not a fiction and not a memory alone. It is a reflection of reality my people endured,” he said, calling the audience’s attention and empathy “an act of solidarity.”\n\n\tKelly Fyffe-Marshall received the Spirit of Cinema Award and delivered one of the night’s most impassioned speeches. “Standing here at the International Film Festival of Kerala is an honor that I will carry for the rest of my life,” she said. She described her work as rooted in “standing up against the injustices faced by the Black community across the world,” adding that “an injustice for one community is an injustice for all communities.” She emphasized that “our struggle is interconnected and our liberation is intertwined,” and urged audiences to “make ripples” by creating safety and dignity within their own communities. Calling solidarity “a daily choice,” she said the honor was “one of the greatest” of her life and thanked IFFK “for giving me the space for stories like mine.”\n\n\tThe ceremony also featured the felicitation of filmmaker, writer and IFFK international competition juror Bùi Thạc Chuyên, representing Vietnam as the festival’s Country Focus, and multiple official releases: “Karunayude Camera,” a book on the late filmmaker Shaji N. Karun, one of the pillars of the festival who died earlier this year; the Festival Handbook, released by jury member, Spanish actor Ángela Molina; the Daily Bulletin, released by Indian auteur Adoor Gopalakrishnan; and the festival special issue of “Chalachitra Sameeksha.” Veteran filmmaker Rajeev Nath was honored for completing 50 years in cinema, followed by the release of “Thanal,” a book on his career.\n\t\n\n\tAlso present at the opening were international competition jurors, Malaysian filmmaker Edmund Yeo, and British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri. Jury chair, exiled Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof, did not attend due to a delayed flight. \n\n\tThe night concluded with the screening of “Palestine 36,” setting a political and humanistic tone for the week ahead.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrançois Ozon has emerged as the early frontrunner in France’s awards season, with “The Stranger” leading the nominations for the 31st Lumières Awards. \n\n\tConsidered France’s equivalent to the Golden Globes, the Lumières Awards are voted on by international journalists from 36 countries and are handed out during a ceremony that takes place roughly a month before the Cesar Awards and kicks off France’s awards season. The Lumières ceremony will be hosted on Jan. 18 at Paris’ Institut du monde arabe.“The Stranger,” an adaptation of Albert Camus’ literary masterpiece which was backed by Gaumont and world premiered at Venice, scored six nominations; ahead of Richard Linklater’s “Nouvelle Vague,” a black-and-white love letter to the French cinematic movement known as the New Wave, which opened at Cannes and landed five Lumières nods. \n\t\n\n\tDominik Moll’s “Case 137,” which is set during France’s yellow vests protests; and Stéphane Demoustier’s “The Great Arch,” a historical drama starring Claes Bang, followed closely with four nominations each. All four titles will compete for best film; alongside Abdellatif Kechiche’s “Mektoub My Love: Canto Due,” which is the last chapter of the controversial French-Tunisian filmmaker’s coming-of-age trilogy and picked up three nominations.\n\n\n\tAside from best film, “The Stranger” is nominated for best director, actor for Benjamin Voisin, screenplay, cinematography and original score. Set in the early 1940s, the film depicts life in Algeria, then under French colonial rule and stars Voisin as the novel’s antihero, Meursault, who is sentenced to death after shooting a young Arab man five times. Voisin stars opposite rising French talent Rebecca Marder. \n\n\t“Nouvelle Vague,” meanwhile, is competing for best director, screenplay, best male newcomer for Guillaume Marbeck and best cinematography.\n\t\n\n\tOther notable nominees include Jodie Foster, who delivers a bold French-language performance as a tormented psychiatrist alongside Daniel Auteuil in Rebecca Zlotowski’s humor-laced thriller “A Private Life;” “Arco,” Ugo Bienvenu’s animated feature voiced and produced by Natalie Portman; Hafsia Herzi’s queer coming-of-age drama “The Little Sister” which won Cannes’ best actress prize for Nadia Melliti and just picked up the Louis Delluc Award from French Critics earlier this week; and Cannes boss Thierry Fremaux’s documentary feature “Lumière ! L’Aventure Continue,” an exploration of the invention of cinema showcasing more than 100 immaculately restored short films shot by Louis and Auguste Lumière.\n\n\tFoster will be facing off Isabelle Huppert for her colorful – and lauded — performance in “The Richest Woman in the World,” a film loosely based on the 2010 Bettencourt Affair involving the heiress to the L’Oreal empire. Lea Drucker in “Case 137,” Vicky Krieps  in “Love Me Tender” and Melanie Thierry in “La Chambre de Mariana” round up the best actress category.  \n\n\tJafar Panahi‘s “It Was Just an Accident,” a morally charged thriller that the Iranian filmmaker shot clandestinely, is vying for best international co-production, alongside Kleber Mendonça Filho’s Brazilian period thriller “The Secret Agent,” Albert Serra’s “Tardes de Soledad,” Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” and Kaouther Ben Hania’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab.” Nominations for the 31st Lumières Awards:\n\n\tBest Film\n\n\t“Case 137,” Dominik Moll“The Stranger,” François Ozon“The Great Arch,” Stéphane Demoustier“Mektoub My Love: Canto Due,” Abdellatif Kechiche“Nouvelle Vague,” Richard LinklaterBest Director\n\n\t“The Great Arch,” Stéphane Demoustier“Mektoub My Love: Canto Due,” Abdellatif Kechiche“Nouvelle Vague,” Richard Linklater“Case 137,” Dominik Moll“The Stranger,” François OzonBest Screenplay\n\n\t“The Great Arch,” Stéphane Demoustier“Nouvelle Vague,” Holly Gent, Vince Palmo and Michèle Halberstadt“Nino,” Pauline Loquès“Case 137,” Dominik Moll and Gilles Marchand“The Stranger,” François OzonBest Documentary“Le Chant des Forêts,” Vincent Munier“Dites-lui que je l’aime,” Romane Bohringer“Lumière !

    "body": "\n\tGoogle has removed dozens of AI-generated videos that depicted Disney-owned characters after receiving a cease and desist letter from the studio on Wednesday.\n\n\tDisney flagged the YouTube links to the videos in its letter, and demanded that Google remove them immediately. The AI videos included Mickey Mouse, Deadpool and characters from “Star Wars” and “The Simpsons,” many of which were made using Google’s AI video tool, Veo.\n\n\n\tThe links were still working on Thursday, but now reroute to a message that reads, “This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Disney.”\n\t\n\n\tDisney launched the broadside shortly before announcing a deal to license 200 characters to OpenAI, which will allow Sora users to create short AI clips.\n\n\tThe company has sought to draw a line in the sand to protect its characters from unlicensed AI use. In the cease and desist letter, Disney also provided a long list of characters it wants removed from YouTube and YouTube Shorts, including those from “Frozen,” “Moana,” “Toy Story,” “Deadpool,” “Iron Man,” “Lilo & Stitch,” and “Winnie the Pooh.”\n\n\tIn a statement on Thursday, Google said it would work with Disney on the issue.\n\n\t“We have a longstanding and mutually beneficial relationship with Disney, and will continue to engage with them,” the company said. “More generally, we use public data from the open web to build our AI and have built additional innovative copyright controls like Google-extended and Content ID for YouTube, which give sites and copyright holders control over their content.”\n\n\tDisney also demanded that Google implement safeguards to prevent its AI tools from generating Disney-owned characters. It also demanded that Google cease using Disney’s characters to train its AI models.\n",

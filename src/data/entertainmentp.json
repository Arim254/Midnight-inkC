    "body": "\n\tThe Central Hollywood Neighborhood Council offered a unanimous vote of support Monday evening for the Arclight Hollywood and Cinerama Dome‘s Conditional Use Permit for serving alcoholic beverages. \n\n\tLand use consultant Elizabeth Petersen-Gower, who is working with the theater complex owners, known as Dome Center for LLC Robinson Property Group, told the neighborhood council, “We’re very excited to be here at this point. The approval of the conditional use permit will be the next big step in the Arclight Theater and the Cinerama Dome reopening,” Petersen-Gower said.\n\t\n\n\t“The family’s committed to redeveloping the property and getting it up and running again. I think you can see a real commitment and direction that they used in bringing Blue Note to the property as well,” she continued, referring to the Forman family of theater owners.\n\n\n\tWhen Variety asked if she could share the timetable for reopening, she said, “I will be able to soon. The entitlements are a big part of that and that is moving very smoothly.” \n\n\tWork has been ongoing on the complex since the Blue Note jazz club opened in the same Sunset Boulevard development.\n\n\tThe vote of support follows a June zoning hearing in advance of the Blue Note opening. The neighborhood councils’ role is to advise officials such as city council members, though the council cannot pass laws or approve conditional use permits. \n\n\tThe Central Hollywood Neighborhood Council agenda item was to consider a possible action to write a letter of support or opposition for a Conditional Use Permit for “the continued sale and dispensing of a full line of alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption in conjunction with the existing theater and restaurant at 6360 W. Sunset Blvd.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Malfoys had a family reunion.\n\n\tJason Isaacs, who played Lucius Malfoy in the “Harry Potter” film series, took to Instagram on Sunday and shared a photo of himself posing with “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” stars Tom Felton and Aidan Close. Felton also starred in the “Harry Potter” films as Isaacs’ on-screen son, Draco Malfoy, and is now reprising the role on Broadway. Close plays Draco’s son, Scorpius Malfoy, in the stage show.\n\t\n\n\t“I came. I saw. He conquered,” Isaacs wrote in the caption of his post. “You had your own giant boots to fill, son, and you burst them at the seams. Balls like ostrich eggs. So brave. So proud. So glad to be there.”\n\n\n\tIn his own post Monday night, Felton wrote, “No one does it quite like the Malfoys – three generations meet for the first time on stage – Needless to say, it was magical… Love you dad [Jason Isaacs] Love you son [Aidan Close].”\n\n\tBack in July, Felton revealed his plans to reprise the role of Draco Malfoy in “The Cursed Child.” After the news broke, Isaacs was quick to support his former co-star on social media.\n\n\t“Can’t wait, son. That’ll be me in the front row with something in my eye,” Isaacs wrote on Instagram. He later added on X: “Tickets booked for November.”\n\n\tFelton began his Broadway run on Nov. 11 and is set to perform for 19 weeks. He told Variety on the Tony Awards red carpet, “The most exciting part is to do it live. It took nine months, more or less, to shoot a film, and this is all compact. This is all reimagined into a very loving, new type of story. And I get to be a dad, which is really fun.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBowen Yang thinks the “Wicked” series has reached the end of its yellow brick road. When the “Wicked” actor and “Saturday Night Live” star was asked about the possibility of a third “Wicked” film being greenlit, Yang offered an answer that seemed satisfied with how “Wicked: For Good” leaves things off. \n\n\t“I think we leave it here,” Yang told Variety’s Marc Malkin during Variety On the Carpet presented by Lexus, before playing along with the prospect of a spinoff. “I’m going to pitch a ‘Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead’ story with my and Bronwyn James’ characters, [Pfannee and ShenShen].”\n\t\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good,” the follow-up to last year’s “Wicked,” adapts the second (and final) act of the Broadway musical. As of now, there are no expectations for a third film in the “Wicked” universe, with the duology’s story ending where the stage show’s does. Series director Jon M. Chu gave his own tentative response when asked about the potential for a third “Wicked” film.\n\n\n\t“What’s it about?” Chu said. “You know, there’s a lot of ideas flying around right now. … We’ll see. Let’s enjoy this ride first.”\n\n\tYang also expressed excitement that his “Wicked” co-star, Ariana Grande, is returning to “Saturday Night Live” to host in December — with Cher on board as musical guest.\n\n\t“I cannot wait. I’m so glad that we have her presence there,” Yang said about Cher, calling her his “dream host.” “Ariana definitely has a good Cher impression. We’ve had ‘Christopher Walken Reunion’ [sketch] where everyone has a Cher impression. I’m going to pitch a ‘Cher Family Reunion’ for Christmas time. Everyone has a Cher impression.”\n\t\n\n\tThough Cynthia Erivo and Grande were both on the carpet for the New York City premiere, neither was available for interviews. Universal reps reached out to media Monday morning to inform them that Erivo wasn’t “feeling well and has lost her voice.” Grande skipped interviews in solidarity with her co-star.\n\n\tAlong with Erivo and Grande, “Wicked” co-stars Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Marissa Bode, Colman Domingo, Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum were all in attendance for the New York premiere.\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” releases to theaters on Friday.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBill Maher told guest Patton Oswalt on the latest episode of the “Club Random” podcast that he is no longer interested in hitting the road for stand-up comedy shows given the country’s intense political divide. The often-outspoken Maher regularly stirs up backlash from both sides of the political aisle on his HBO talk show “Real Time.” \n\n\t“I don’t want to be out there in this country, in this political atmosphere. I could get shot by the left or the right,” Maher said (via The Daily Beast). “It’s a good time to not be out there.”\n\t\n\n\tMaher also acknowledged that he is “tired of the travel” and “tired of being twice as funny as people who were selling twice as many tickets as me.” He noted that “because I’m on TV every week” it gives fans less incentive to buy tickets to his stand-up shows. \n\n\n\t“Not that I didn’t sell a lot of tickets and do great theaters—but I didn’t sell arenas,” Maher added. “And some people did, who, frankly, are not that great. But, you know, when the audience is 35 to 45, they don’t wanna see somebody 70… I just did my 13th HBO special. I feel like that’s a good body of work… I felt they all, they basically got better as it went along. I feel like the last one was the best one, which is a good way to get off.”\n\n\tMaher has upset the left in recent months by attacking “crazies” in the democratic party who have gone too “woke,” while he drew backlash from the right for speaking out against ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel last month. Maher made headlines in March when he said he was partial to “some of the things” Donald Trump is doing in his second administration as U.S. president, which drew scorn from fellow comedians like Marc Maron.\n\t\n\n\tAfter the shooting death of Charlie Kirk in September, Maher told viewers that it’s pointless to debate whether or not Democrats or Republicans are worse because “both sides” are guilty of rampant toxicity.\n\n\t“It’s a very ugly week in America with violence of all kinds: political violence, regular violence, a lot of people talking about a civil war. And then today in Congress, because Charlie Kirk got assassinated, [Colorado Representative] Lauren Boebert stood up and said, ‘We need to have a prayer.’ So they started to have a silent prayer. And then she started screaming, ‘No! Silent prayers get silent results.’ As if praying out loud gets big results,” Maher added.. “Then the Democrats started screaming at her that there was a school shooting in her state. I tell you, so far, the civil war is not very civil.”\n\n\tWatch Maher’s full conversation with Oswalt on the “Club Random” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tCynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande won’t be doing interviews at Monday night’s New York City premiere of “Wicked: For Good.”\n\n\tUniversal reps informed members of the media just hours before the carpet is set to open at Lincoln Center that “Cynthia is not feeling well and has lost her voice, therefore she and Ariana will not be doing interviews this evening.”\n\n\tVariety has learned that Grande decided to skip interviews in solidarity with Erivo. The pair is still set to pose for photos on the carpet.\n\t\n\n\tCo-stars Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Bowen Yang, Marissa Bode, Colman Domingo, Michelle Yeoh, Jeff Goldblum and director Jon M. Chu are expected to attend the premiere.\n\n\n\tSadly, this is another unexpected hiccup in the “Wicked: For Good” world promo tour. Grande was unable to make it to the first premiere in São Paulo, Brazil, on Nov. 4 because of airplane mechanical issues. Last week, Grande was grabbed by a man in Singapore who jumped over the barricades onto the carpet — with Erivo springing into action to push the man off her co-star.\n\n\tOn Saturday, Erivo talked about their “Wicked” journey during a conversation moderated by Variety’s Clayton Davis. “We have come through some shit,” she said. “I mean, fuck even this last week, let’s be honest.”\n\n\tErivo and Grande attended the Governors Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday night. Erivo presented Debbie Allen’s honorary Oscar. Grande walked the red carpet and spoke to some members of the press, including Variety.\n\n\t“For Good” comes a year after the first “Wicked” movie was released. “Wicked” went on to earn more than $746 million in worldwide ticket sales and 10 Oscar nominations, including acting nods for Grande and Erivo as well as one for best picture.\n\t\n\n\tThe second and final movie sees Elphaba (Erivo) continuing her Wicked Witch of the West crusade to bring down the Wizard (Goldblum). Meanwhile, Glinda’s (Grande) popularity rises as she gets ready to marry Fiyero (Bailey).\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is in theaters Nov. 21.\n",

    "description": "\n\tChristopher Nolan‘s “The Odyssey” is making film history as the first narrative feature shot entirely with Imax cameras, and it’s all thanks in part",
    "body": "\n\tChristopher Nolan‘s “The Odyssey” is making film history as the first narrative feature shot entirely with Imax cameras, and it’s all thanks in part to a child and a David Bowie song. The film’s cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, revealed to Empire magazine that he shot Imax test footage of a kid reading Bowie’s “Sound And Vision” lyrics to prove whether or not Imax film cameras were advanced enough to record dialogue.\n\n\t“I presented Chris with a very big close-up of a child on the IMAX screen, reciting David Bowie’s ‘Sound And Vision’ from a piece of paper,” van Hoytema said. “It was very touching: that level of intimacy in both image and sound, fused together, projected in the theatre.”\n\t\n\n\tNolan said the results were “electrifying,” adding: “We never would have been able to get those shots before.” The footage proved once and for all that Nolan could finally make an entire movie shot entirely with Imax cameras, whereas he was limited to mostly action scenes in the past since Imax cameras were too noisy to film dialogue scenes up close to the actor. A new Imax film casing called a “blimp” was created to significantly reduce the noise Imax cameras produce.\n\n\t“The blimp system is a game-changer,” Nolan said. “You can be shooting a foot from [an actor’s] face while they’re whispering and get usable sound. What that opens up are intimate moments of performance on the world’s most beautiful format.”\n\n\tNolan has been building toward making a movie entirely with Imax cameras since 2008, when “The Dark Knight” became the first Hollywood movie to utilize Imax cameras to shoot select action scenes. Since then, Nolan has used Imax cameras for more scenes with every new release. His 2023 Oscar-winning “Oppenheimer” was the first movie to use Imax black-and-white 65mm film.\n\t\n\n\t“The Odyssey” is being shot by van Hoytema, who has collaborated with Nolan on “Interstellar,” “Dunkirk,” “Tenet” and “Oppenheimer.” He won the best cinematography Oscar for the latter film and spoke to Variety at the time about working with Nolan and Kodak to create the first stock of Imax 65mm black-and-white film.\n\n\t“Black and white film doesn’t exist for 65 millimeters, so our first challenge was starting to talk to Kodak about if they could provide us with the necessary film stock that we needed for this film,” van Hoytema said. “We needed to re-engineer the cameras as well because those cameras have these pressure plates behind the film gates that are made out of metal and the backing is much thinner than color stock. The light would bleed back into the films creating all these artifacts.”\n\n\tNolan previously revealed to Empire magazine that he “shot over 2 million feet of film” during the making of “The Odyssey,” which filmed for 91 days earlier this year. Per Kodak, a foot of 65mm film costs $1.50. This means Nolan’s film used around $3 million worth of film.\n\n\tMatt Damon reunites with Nolan after “Interstellar” and “Oppenheimer” to headline “The Odyssey” in the lead role of Odysseus. Tom Holland plays his son, Telemachus. The sprawling ensemble also includes Anne Hathaway, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong’o, Robert Pattinson, Charlize Theron and Jon Bernthal.\n\n\t“As a filmmaker, you’re looking for gaps in cinematic culture, things that haven’t been done before,” Nolan told Empire about why he chose to adapt Homer’s Greek epic. “And what I saw is that all of this great mythological cinematic work that I had grown up with – Ray Harryhausen movies and other things – I’d never seen that done with the sort of weight and credibility that an A-budget and a big Hollywood, IMAX production could do.”\n\n\t“The Odyssey” opens in theaters July 17, 2026, from Universal.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrom the first question, Variety’s A Night in the Writers’ Room gathering of five drama showrunners was a lively affair as the scribes compared notes and reflected on how much television has changed in a short time.\n\n\tBut nothing sparked up the session, moderated by Emily Longeretta, Variety’s senior TV features editor, like the discussion of how each showrunner prefers to work — and what it takes for them to actually get work done.\n\t\n\n\tFor Jennie Snyder Urman, showrunner and executive producer of CBS’ “Matlock,” she has to free herself from the desk to get creative juices flowing. The lengths to which she goes to get her work done surprised her fellow panelists.\n\n\t“My writing process is tied to my walking,” Urman said during the panel held at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood. “I do that every day. I take my scripts for walks. My husband’s gotten calls that’s like, ‘We saw your wife in Tarzana and she’s in sweats and she’s got papers and she’s talking and he’s like, ‘she’s working.’ I just think better when I’m moving.”\n\n\tR. Scott Gemmill, showrunner and executive producer of HBO Max’s “The Pitt,” said he completely rejects the idea that writers’ rooms have to work all night.\n\n\t“I’m pretty slack about the writer’s room. I only work with the writers from like, 11 to 2. I feel like a small, quick meeting is something much more effective,” Gemmill said. “I encourage them to be off living life so that they can bring stories to the room. I don’t believe in being in the room for eight hours. I would be sound asleep. They would have to wake me up like four times.”\n\t\n\n\tSterlin Harjo, creator and showrunner of FX’s “The Lowdown,” chimed in with his preferred schedule: “I do 10 to 4.”\n\n\tGemmill added that there’s another key consideration for shows that are based in Los Angeles. “We come into work and it’s like, get your work done and get the hell outta here and beat traffic, and let’s do it again tomorrow.”\n\n\tBrad Ingelsby, creator and showrunner of HBO’s “Task,” brought an entirely different perspective. He’s a one-man-band on his series that stars Mark Ruffalo.\n\n\t“It’s just me in my office at home. I sit in the chair every day. I get up every day early in the morning and write until the kids get home. That’s my trick,” Ingelsby said. To which Gemmill injected: “You wanna come and sit with us for a while, just have some friends?”\n\n\tIngelsby took the joke in stride and added, “When people ask me for any advice about writing, I say that the only valuable piece of information I can give you is to sit in the chair every day. And I do it every day — I just sit in the chair.”\n\n\tHarjo then took up the thread.\n\n\t“I admire that because it’s what I want to do. What I want to do is be a disciplined writer,” Harjo said. “And I try. I’ll do certain things, but I usually end up like driving to a coffee shop, to office, to home, to a coffee shop, on a walk to a thing, and then like, never write.”\n\n\tHarjo’s candor likely encouraged Ingelsby to confess that he never writes scripts based on outlines. That also brought out multiple perspectives.\n\n\t“I don’t even know how to outline stories. That’s probably why I sit in my office so long every day. My brain doesn’t work like that,” Ingelsby said.\n\n\t“Do you just free write?” Urman asked.\n\n\t“What I like about writing is discovery. And when I do an outline that’s so strict and I’m so married to an outline that I lose that discovery,” Ingelsby explained.\n\n\t“Part of what I love about writing is the more time I spend with the characters, the better I can write them and the more complex and layered they become. So if I’m so married to a beat sheet, then I feel like there’s no discovery left. I’m just inputting these beats along the way. So I have some ideas. I kind of know where it goes emotionally. I think I know where the characters go, but I don’t really outline that well, which I know some of the executives don’t like, but it’s the only way I know how to do it.”\n\t\n\n\tJenny Han, creator and showrunner of Amazon’s “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” offered the perspective of being an author who is adapting her own trio of YA novels. When asked by Longeretta about the process of pacing out episodes over multiple seasons, Han admitted that her roadmap for the TV series changed over time.\n\n\t“My vision was always to do just the three seasons, for the three books,” Han said. “And then I think it was during Season 2 when I was realizing — or maybe it was the beginning of Season 3 — we asked for another episode and they were like, ‘Great.’ And so we moved from 10 to, it was seven first season. Second season, we had eight, then we had 10 on the third. And then I was like, ‘I think I need one more.’ And then I’m like, you know, actually I think I need a movie.’ And luckily, Prime Video was happy to accommodate that wish.”\n\n\t(Pictured: R.

    "body": "\n\tRoc Nation Distribution has launched a new dashboard designed to empower its independent artists. \n\n\tRoc Nation’s in-house distribution arm describes the platform as its effort to maximize artists’ “global audience reach” towards fan bases, “unlocking new business opportunities by offering all-encompassing tools, services and resources in a centralized hub,” according to a press release. \n\n\n\tAs part of the announcement, independent artists will now be able to sign up and begin distributing their music directly through Roc Nation Distribution’s new dashboard. Whether artists are releasing their own music or having their representatives upload on their behalf, the platform is open to musicians seeking to leverage its distribution and analytics tools.\n\t\n\n\t“The introduction of this new dashboard will be a game-changer for independent artists releasing music with Roc Nation Distribution,” Roc Nation Distribution President Krystian Santini said. “It’s a one-stop shop that will enable artists to receive a holistic understanding of their followers, so they can build impactful strategies and broaden their music’s reach without financial barriers. This dashboard is democratizing access to tools and information historically reserved for the very few established label superstars. Our technology is uniquely ours and sets a new standard with no equivalent in today’s music industry.”\n\n\tThe dashboard will be accessible to Roc Nation Distribution artists such as Clipse, Rapsody, Flau’jae, Yailin La Mas Viral, The LOX, SAINt JHN, Westside Gunn, Conway The Machine, Jay Electronica, Bootsy Collins, and many more who distribute with Roc Nation Distribution.\n\t\n\n\tThe announcement comes after Clipse just earned five Grammy nominations, marking a major milestone for Roc Nation Distribution. The group scored nominations for album of the year and best rap album for “Let God Sort Em Out” as well as best rap performance for “Chains & Whips,” best rap song for “The Birds Don’t Sing,” and best music video for “So Be It.”\n\n\t+ Sony Music Publishing has promoted Dee Hale to senior vice president of film, television and TV administration. Hale will be based in the company’s Nashville office and continue to report to executive vice president, worldwide administration, Dale Esworthy.\n\n\tIn the new role, Hale will be the primary administrative contact for Sony Music Publishing’s studio clients and provide ongoing support to the company’s UK studio clients. She will also continue her role as co-chair of the Society and Publisher Forum A/V Committee.\n\n\tHale has been with Sony Music Publishing for over 30 years, first joining in 1993 as director of film and television music administration. During her time at the company, she has worked with a variety of production studios such as Sony Pictures, Tyler Perry Studios, A&E, Discovery, Twentieth Century Studios and Apple. \n\n\t“I love working for a great company, with great people, doing something I love! It’s been an honor to work with our amazing studio clients and so many others throughout the world to take this part of the business to a higher level, and I am excited for what’s ahead,” shared Hale.\n\n\t“Dee’s dedication to songwriters and composers is unsurpassed and unwavering,” added Esworthy. “Her leadership as co-chair of the Society Publisher Forum’s AV Data Exchange working group has been instrumental in strengthening the global administration practices for composers at SMP and beyond. I look forward to seeing Dee step into this new role and am excited to see what she’ll achieve next.”\n\n\t+ Warner Music Group today announced that Leho Nigul is being promoted to chief technology officer, WMG, from his current role as senior vice president, engineering. Effective Dec. 1, Nigul will lead WMG’s technology strategy, team, and product roadmap, reporting to CEO Robert Kyncl. \n\n\tAt the same time, it was announced that Ariel Bardin has decided to leave the company after a three-year tenure as president of technology. He will remain with the company through the end of 2025 to ensure the continuity of key initiatives and a smooth leadership transition.\n\t\n\n\tHaving joined WMG in 2023, Nigul has overseen engineering teams responsible for wide-ranging initiatives covering distribution, global licensing, royalty management, fan engagement, and AI projects, among others. \n\n\tDuring his time at WMG, Bardin has meaningfully upgraded the company’s tech infrastructure and processes. Under his leadership, the company has launched cutting edge tools for artists, songwriters, and employees, simplified and strengthened its global supply chain, and delivered a whole suite of improvements to its data systems.\n\n\tNigul said, “WMG’s dynamic approach to pioneering the future of music is creating powerful, new opportunities for our artists, songwriters, and teams. I’m delighted to be passed the baton by Ariel, my long-time friend and colleague. With strong foundations in place, we’ll continue to help drive growth, efficiency, and an expanded suite of services for the creative community.”\n\n\tBardin said, “It has been an honor to collaborate with the incredible teams at WMG and serve our extraordinary artists and songwriters. Together, we’ve achieved so much, and I’m pleased to be planning my next opportunity knowing the company is well positioned to win over the long term.”\n\n\t+ Jeremy Vuernick has been named executive vice president, Atlantic Music Group, joining AMG’s global leadership team. In this new post, reporting jointly to AMG CEO Elliot Grainge and Atlantic UK Co-Presidents Ed Howard and Briony Turner, Vuernick will be based in London and work closely with the company’s UK and U.S. teams to sign and develop artists with global potential.\n\n\tIn 2024, Vuernick founded the Los Angeles-based independent company Queens Road Music in partnership with Atlantic. Prior to launching Queens Road Music, he spent over a decade as an executive at Capitol Music Group, most recently serving as president of A&R. While at CMG, Vuernick oversaw the company’s portfolio of labels, developing global superstar talent across genres.\n\n\tEd Howard and Briony Turner noted, “This is the next exciting step to further link our UK and US teams to super-serve our artists and their visions. With Jeremy’s impressive A&R track record and stellar relationships, he’ll be a fantastic addition to our team, as we work together to discover and elevate the next generation of global superstars.”\n\t\n\n\tGrainge said: “I have worked with Jeremy for a number of years and I’m excited to officially welcome him into the AMG family. He comes to us with outstanding experience, instincts, and passion for artists, so he’ll be an ace addition to our newly aligned teams. Under the expert leadership of Ed and Briony, Atlantic UK has been a formidable source of chart-topping, game-changing artistry. With Jeremy now based in London, we are continuing to build our bridge across the ocean, ramping up our collective A&R and cultural firepower.”\n\n\t+ Merlin has appointed Charlie Lexton as its CEO, effective Jan. 1 2026.\n\n\tLexton, who succeeds Jeremy Sirota, has worked for Merlin since its inception, initially alongside founding CEO, Charles Caldas. Most recently, Lexton has served as Merlin’s COO since April 2020.\n\n\tHe has been at the centre of key milestones throughout Merlin’s history, from the negotiation of its suite of DSP and social media deals to the recent announcement of its groundbreaking partnership with the pioneering AI audio company, ElevenLabs. \n\n\tCommenting on his appointment, Lexton said: “I am delighted at the opportunity to lead this organisation. My focus is on our members—the most significant grouping of independent music companies in the world—and on the Merlin team, our incredibly hard working and dedicated staff. I can do nothing without the support of our team. And without our members, there is no Merlin.”\n\n\tOutgoing Merlin CEO Jeremy Sirota remarked: “Charlie has been a great partner in evolving Merlin into what it is today. He consistently delivers – from his unwavering commitment to the Merlin team to pioneering the first significant AI deal with ElevenLabs to empowering our members via Merlin Insights. Next year, I’m proud he will champion Merlin Engage to empower the next generation of female leaders for independent music. I’m excited for Charlie and the team to write Merlin’s next chapter.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Shogun” Season 2 expands its cast once again with the addition of Japanese pop star and actor Ren Meguro.\n\n\tMeguro joins the series as Kazutada. After debuting as part of the idol group Snow Man in 2020, the 28-year-old broke into film and television acting. His TV credits include overseas productions like “Silent,” “Trillion Game” and “The Beginning of the Sea.”\n\n\t“I am incredibly honored to join the cast of ‘Shogun’ season two,” Meguro said in a statement. “When I streamed ‘Shogun’ on Disney+ last year, I was profoundly moved by the series’ unique and grand portrayal of Japan, which felt different from past portrayals. As a Japanese person, I felt a compelling urge to be part of this groundbreaking production.” \n\t\n\n\tHe added, “I am committed to honoring the legacy that so many have built before me and to carefully shaping the role entrusted to me in this remarkable series. I can’t wait for everyone to see the release of ‘Shogun’ Season 2 and to share in this incredible journey with us.”\n\n\n\tHe joins fellow newcomers Asami Mizukawa (Aya), Masataka Kubota (Hyūga), Sho Kaneta (Hidenobu), Takaaki Enoki (Lord Ito) and Jun Kunimura (Gōda).\n\n\tOriginal cast members returning for Season 2 include stars Hiroyuki Sanada and Cosmo Jarvis, as well as Fumi Nikaidô, Shinnosuke Abe, Hiroto Kanai, Yoriko Dôguchi, Tommy Bastow, Yuko Miyamoto, Eita Okuno and Yuka Kouri.\n\n\tAccording to an official logline, “Shogun” Season 2 “is set ten years after the events of the first season and continues the historically-inspired saga of these two men from different worlds whose fates are inextricably entwined.”\n\t\n\n\tDirectors Hiromi Kamata and Takeshi Fukunaga, who both helmed episodes in Season 1, return to direct for the second season. Anthony Byrne, Kate Herron and series co-creator Justin Marks are also set to direct episodes in Season 2.\n\n\tSeason 2 writers include co-creator Rachel Kondo, Marks, Shannon Goss, Matt Lambert, Maegan Houang, Emily Yoshida, Caillin Puente and Sofie Somoroff.\n\n\t“Shogun,” based on the 1975 James Clavell novel, was created for television by Kondo and Marks and is produced by FX Productions. The duo also serves as executive producers alongside Michaela Clavell, Edward L. McDonnell and Michael De Luca and Sanada. Jarvis is co-executive producer alongside Eriko Miyagawa.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChristian Bale is being eyed for a role in Michael Mann‘s “Heat 2,” the long-awaited sequel to the filmmaker’s 1995 crime drama starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, according to a source with knowledge of the production.\n\n\tBale previously starred in Mann’s “Public Enemies,” and, if deals close, the reunion could see the Oscar winner starring alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, who has also been eyed for a leading role.\n\n\n\tAmazon MGM Studios and United Artists are expected to start production on the film in 2026. (The project received a sizable $37.2 million in tax credits from the California Film Commission to shoot in the state.) Plot details for “Heat 2” haven’t been revealed, though Mann adapted the screenplay from the 2022 New York Times-bestselling novel that he co-wrote with Meg Gardiner. Producers will include Mann, Jerry Bruckheimer, and UA’s Scott Stuber and Nick Nesbitt. Eric Roth and Shane Salerno will serve as executive producers.\n\t\n\n\t“Heat,” which celebrates its 30th anniversary in December, follows an explosive face-off between a Los Angeles Police Department detective (Pacino) and a career thief (De Niro). The film was a box office hit, earning $187 million globally (not adjusted for inflation) against a $60 million budget.\n\n\tBale’s chameleon-like filmography spans from his mainstream breakout in “American Psycho” and the dual role of Bruce Wayne and Batman in “The Dark Knight” trilogy to portraying the likes of Vice President Dick Cheney in “Vice” as well as race car driver Ken Miles in “Ford v. Ferrari,” which Mann executive produced. Bale will next be seen as Frankenstein’s monster opposite Jessie Buckley in Maggie Gyllenhaal’s “The Bride!”. He’ll also portray Raiders owner Al Davis in “Madden” from David O. Russell. He is repped by WME.\n\t\n\n\tDeadline first reported news of Bale’s potential involvement. Amazon had no comment.\n",

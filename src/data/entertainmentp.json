    "body": "\n\tKevin Spacey is set to mark his return to the small screen for the first time since he was fired from Netflix’s “House of Cards” in 2017 amid allegations of sexual misconduct. \n\n\tThe actor — who has been trying to resuscitate his career in recent years — is set to star in Italian comedy series “Minimarket” for Italy‘s state broadcaster RAI.\n\n\tIn the low-budget show, the two-time Oscar winner plays himself as the imaginary mentor of a young man who works in a Rome convenience store and dreams of becoming a TV star. As seen in a promo, Spacey sings Randy Newman’s “You’ve Got a Friend in Me” and Frank Sinatra classic “I’ve Got You Under My Skin” in tandem with Italian actor Filippo Laganà (pictured above), who plays aspiring Italian star Manlio Viganò.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the synopsis, Spacey plays Viganò’s “artistic conscience and unpredictable mentor,” with their rapport mostly grounded in “bickering, misunderstandings and mutual teasing.” It adds that the show captures both “the experience of a man who has been on the world’s most important [movie and TV] sets” and “the recklessness of someone who does not realise that they have an Oscar-winner by their side.” \n\n\n\tThe ten-episode “Minimarket” show will launch on RAI’s RaiPlay streaming service starting on Dec. 26.\n\n\tSpacey, who was acquitted of sexual assault charges brought by four men in a U.K. criminal trial in 2023, has more recently been hit with three more claims of sexual assault that he will face in a London civil court next year. BBC News last month reported that Spacey has formally denied two of the three civil claims in court, but has not yet filed a defense for the third.\n\t\n\n\tLast month Spacey announced in an interview with British newspaper The Telegraph that he was officially homeless after his Hollywood film career came crashing down amid various sexual assault allegations.\n\n\t“I’m living in hotels, I’m living in Airbnbs,” he said. “I’m going where the work is. I literally have no home, that’s what I’m attempting to explain… The costs over these last seven years have been astronomical. I’ve had very little coming in and everything going out.”\n\n\tItaly has been welcoming Spacey for years. The U.S. actor in 2021 made his return to acting, starring as a police detective in Italian actor/director Franco Nero’s low budget indie drama “L’uomo Che Disegnò Dio” (“The Man Who Drew God”). He has also appeared as a character named “The Devil” in Italian director Massimo Paolucci’s psychological thriller “The Contract.”\n\n\tIn March of last year Spacey was back on U.S. movie screens with indie thriller “Peter Five Eight,” also starring Rebecca de Mornay, which got mostly ignored by critics and marked Spacey’s first leading role since being cleared in the 2023 London trial. Since then he has appeared in yet-to-be-released British indie action-thriller “The Awakening” in which he appears as the head of sinister global cabal, a film that he was promoting earlier this year in Cannes, and directed the supernatural action-thriller “Holiguards.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy RAI\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tFilmmaker Judy Lei has assembled an ensemble cast for her comedy-driven drama “Biz of Viz.”\n\n\tYao (“Sinners“) and Emmy winner Jodi Long (“Dash & Lily,” “Sullivan & Son”) lead the cast alongside Lei, who wrote, directed and stars in the feature. The ensemble also includes Leonard Wu (“Low Life,” “American Born Chinese”), Ivan Leung (“Extremely Unique Dynamic”), Kelly Ng (“FBI”), Carrie Vu (“Partner Track”) and Murielle Hsieh (“Blue Sun Palace”).\n\t\n\n\tThe film’s title serves as shorthand for Business of Visibility. It centers on Jules (Lei), a Chinese American festival director experiencing burnout while trying to support her community through cinema. She learns that concepts like visibility, representation and doing good work carry their own costs. Working under her clueless nepo-baby boss Eric, and dealing with demands from Cathy, a diva actress from the 1980s attempting a comeback, Jules depends on the “Core 4,” volunteer-interns who argue constantly yet somehow prevent the festival from falling apart. With the Asian American Independent Film Institute Film Festival’s Opening Night approaching, everyone involved faces the challenge of keeping the event on track while avoiding interpersonal conflicts.\n\n\n\tLei produced the film with support from 190 Seed&Spark supporters. Executive producers are Ronny Chieng, Yao King, Long and Yao. Co-producers are Aude Yosa Vallo, Christine Rivera, Kayla Wong, Joseph Carranza, Jenny Ye and Tiffany Bai.\n\n\tA Chinatown and Brooklyn native, Lei works across multiple disciplines as an actor, writer, producer, filmmaker and community organizer. Her training includes the Barrow Group Theatre Company and Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. She has written, performed and produced two one-woman shows that sold out in New York and Los Angeles: “The World’s Greatest” (directed by MC Jin) and “28: Still Fcked Up*.” The former was developed into a feature that played at the 2022 Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival and Asian American International Film Festival. Her latest short “Forever Maybe” represents her ongoing focus on NYC Asian American stories across comedy, television and film.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m absolutely thrilled and honored to be working with this amazing cast,” Lei said. “Their authenticity, unapologetic comedic timing and their passion for this story is what will make this film shine. It’s been a thrill to work with yao and Jodi and the rest of the cast to bring this story to life.”\n\n\t“Biz of Viz” has wrapped principal photography in New York City.\n\n\tLei is repped by Metropolis Artists Agency; Yao by Luber Roklin Entertainment, Stewart Talent and Peikhoff Mahan; Long by Vanguard Management and Innovative Artists; Wu by Venture Entertainment Partners and Stewart Talent; Leung by Link Entertainment and Hopscotch Pictures; Ng by Inclusive Management, Bonafide and Emerging Artists; and Vu by MZMGMTNY.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBeta Film, one of Europe’s biggest independent production-distribution players, has clinched a wide-ranging multi-territory sale to Canal+ across a selection of Beta titles, led by the sexually-souped thriller “The Couple Next Door,” starring “Outlanders” lead Sam Hueughan, and Berlinale 2025 hit thriller “Other People’s Money.”\n\n\tUnder the terms of the deal, Canal+ will roll out the higher-end Beta Film series across Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Belgium and the Netherlands, among other territories. The deal spans multiple windows and platforms across Canal+’s regional services, Beta Film announced Thursday. \n\t\n\n\tTitles announced in the deal are heavy on crime – the common currency of Europe’s TV trading these days – from a subplot in “The Couple Next Door” to the extraordinary tax fraud in “Other People’s Money” to crime drama “Cold Summer” and the detective procedural “Makari – Sicilian Mysteries” and true-events based criminal underworld thriller “El Inmortal: Gangs of Madrid.” It also takes it, however, coming of age series “Prisma” and “Last to Break,” a bio of Finnish motorcycling racer Jarno Saarinen.\n\n\n\tWorld premiering its first four episodes at this year’s Berlinale,” “Other People’s Money” is produced by Germany’s X-Filme Creative Pool, behind European premium TV milestone “Babylon Berlin,” and Denmark’s True Content Entertainment’s, whose producer Ole Søndberg was behind “The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo” and “Wallander.” They are backed by German and Danish public broadcasters ZDF and DR. \n\t\n\n\t“Other People’s Money” chronicles the biggest tax scam in European history, accounting for €146 billion ($170.8 billion), engineered by banks and ultra-rich investors, where the key issue is whether the fraud is even illegal and can its perpetrators be prosecuted. Created and showrunner by Jan Schomburg (“I’m Your Man,” “Above Us Only Sky”), the series was hailed by Der Spiegel as a “perfectly formed, eight-part masterpiece.”\n\n\tFrom Eagle Eye (“Bookish”), executive produced by Walter Iuzzolino and Jo McGrath and is made in association with Beta Film, and backed by Channel 4 and Starz. \n\n\t“The Couple Next Door” features a top-notch cast –  Heughan, Alfred Enoch (“How to Get Away With Murder”), Eleanor Tomlinson (“Poldark”) and Jessica De Gouw (“The Huntress”), with Tomlinson playing the deeply traumatised Evie who moves with her straight-laced husband Pete (Enoch) into a seemingly perfect well-healed suburb of Leeds in Northern England – until she develops an increasingly deranged sexual obsession for neighbor Danny (a hunky Heughan.   \n\n\tWritten by David Allison (“Marcella,” “Bedlam”) and directed by the awarded Dries Vos (“Suspect,” “Professor T”), “The Couple Next Door” was one of Channel 4’s biggest drama streaming launches, also punching a robust linear debut. It sold to over 55 territories in early dealing,  including to NBC Universal for Latin America, RTL in Germany, RAI in Italy and a first-window deal with Amazon in the Netherlands.\n\n\tBowing in Canneseries’ main competition in 2022,” “El Inmortal – Gangs of Madrid,”produced by Movistar Plus+ and Telemundo Int. Studios in collaboration with Banijay’s DLO Producciones, tracks the rise of the founding leader of Los Miami, a gang which controlled Madrid’s insatiable ‘90s drug business, tensed by sudden explosive violence, and the drug-lord’s multiple near-death experiences. It scored best action series at the Produ Awards 2023 and best actor in a Drama Series (Alejandro García) at the Almería Film Festival 2023. \n\n\tProduced by Clemart, Italian mafia series “Cold Summer” sold to SBS Australia and Walter Presents in the U.S. and Canada ahead of its linear U.K. premiere on Channel 4. It broke records on its home turf on RAI Italy, premiering with peak viewership at 4.6 million and a hitting a standout 23% market share.\n\t\n\n\tRenewed for a second season, Amazon Italian original “Prisma,” about adolescent twin teens challenging gender norms, won the Premio Kinéo 2024 best actor award for Mattia Carrano, who plays both twins. Beta-owned Cross Productions produces.\n\n\tUnspooling in Sicily, “Makari – Sicilian Mysteries” is produced by Mediawan-owned Palomar (“Inspector Montalbano,” “The Name of the Rose”). Lauded as “the other ‘Montalbano’” by newspaper Corriere della Sera, it proved a RAI primetime winner. \n\n\t“Last to Break” is produced by Helsinki-based Funfar (“Bad Company”), co-produced by Fireframe and Finnish pubcaster YLE, written by Sami Keski-Vähälä (“Gracious Night,” “Brothers”) and directed by Simon Kaijser (“Spinning Man,” “Before We Die”).\n\n\tIt captures the shocking mortal danger of early ‘70s motorcycle racing as Finn Saarinen – dashing, charismatic, an extraordinary and meticulous racer but still the underdog –  takes on three time and reigning world champion Giacomo Agostini in the 1972 350cc World Championship. Agostini seemed unbeatable, having not lost a head-to-head race since 1967.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tGower Street Analytics has projected that the global box office will reach $35 billion in 2026, marking a second consecutive year of growth with a 5% increase over current estimates for 2025.\n\n\tThe forecast would make 2026 the highest-grossing year worldwide since 2019’s $42.3 billion haul, surpassing 2023’s $33.9 billion, according to the theatrical analytics firm’s annual year-ahead projection.\n\n\n\t“We predict 2026 will be the highest grossing global year since 2019 ($42.3 billion), topping the current high of 2023 ($33.9 billion),” said Gower Street chief analyst Thomas Beranek, who led the 2026 projection work. “Especially in the markets driven by Hollywood product we expect the most significant growth.”\n\t\n\n\tAt current exchange rates, the 2026 estimate would still trail the average of the last three pre-pandemic years (2017-2019) by 12%.\n\n\n\tGower Street CEO Dimitrios Mitsinikos noted the firm’s track record with such forecasts. “For 2024, our early forecast landed within 5% of the actual global year-end result, a year ahead of time,” he said. “For 2025, we’re tracking toward a final global total within 2% of our original $33 billion forecast from 12 months ago.”\n\n\tThe projection, which Gower Street releases each December, utilizes data from the company’s Forecast service based on current release calendars alongside additional analyst assessment.\n\n\tFor North America, the firm projects the domestic market will finish 11% up on 2025 at approximately $9.9 billion, though that remains 14% behind the 2017-2019 average.\n\n\tThe international market excluding China is predicted to finish 5% ahead of 2025 at approximately $18 billion, representing an 11% gap versus the 2017-2019 average at current exchange rates. Breaking down the key regions, Gower Street estimates Europe, Middle East, and Africa at $10.05 billion (up 7% versus 2025), Asia Pacific excluding China at $5.3 billion (flat versus 2025), and Latin America at $2.65 billion (up 9% versus 2025).\n\t\n\n\t“There is an incredibly strong franchise-led release calendar for 2026 with new instalments in massively popular film series including ‘Avengers,’ ‘Spider-Man,’ ‘Toy Story,’ ‘Dune,’ ‘Star Wars,’ ‘Super Mario Bros,’ ‘Minions,’ ‘Jumanji,’ ‘Scream,’ ‘The Fockers,’ and ‘Hunger Games,'” said Rob Mitchell, Gower Street’s director of theatrical insights. “But there are also many potentially huge hits among non-sequels, including musical biopic ‘Michael’; the live action version of ‘Moana’; and new titles from legendary blockbuster directors Christopher Nolan (‘The Odyssey‘) and Steven Spielberg (‘Disclosure Day’); among many others. Audiences will be spoilt for choice.”\n\n\tChina is conservatively estimated at $7.1 billion, down 4% versus 2025 estimates. The market remains the hardest to predict due to a limited release calendar at this stage, according to Gower Street, despite generating both the biggest local title of all-time with “Ne Zha 2” and the No. 2 import title ever with “Zootopia 2” this year.\n\n\tGower Street cautioned that the early prediction could see fluctuation as the release calendar evolves, particularly with several untitled studio releases currently dated. The projection also cannot account for unexpected global events.\n\n\tGower Street Analytics, founded in 2015 and partnered with Comscore, provides theatrical predictive analytics covering over 85 markets through its proprietary Forecast box office simulation platform.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tFandango Sales has boarded French-Lebanese director Danielle Arbid’s “Only Rebels Win,” starring “Succession” actress Hiam Abbass, for international sales. The film will world premiere in the Berlin Film Festival’s Panorama section.\n\n\tThe film, which also stars French-South Sudanese-Chadian actor Amine Benrachid, is set in Beirut, where Suzanne (Abbass) meets Osmane (Benrachid) after saving him from a racist attack. Osmane is Sudanese, young, undocumented and searching for a better future. Suzanne is a middle-class widow with Palestinian roots, a mother of two adult children and well over twice his age.\n\t\n\n\tUnexpectedly, the two lonely souls open up to each other and connect. Shy at first, they grow closer, until they admit they are in love. As a fractured Lebanon teeters on the brink of collapse, their relationship provokes a wave of anger and indignation all around them, forcing them to face the hostility, and to resist.\n\n\n\tArbid is a French filmmaker and video artist of Lebanese origin. Her fiction films – “In the Battlefields,” “A Lost Man,” “Parisienne” and “Simple Passion” – were selected and received awards at Cannes (Official Selection and Directors’ Fortnight), as well as at San Sebastián, Toronto, Busan and Locarno among other international festivals.\n\n\tHer documentaries and film essays have won Locarno’s Golden and Silver Leopard as well as the Prix Albert Londres. She also directed the Canal+ series “Singapoura” and “66.5.” Arbid’s video works have been exhibited in museums such as the Centre Pompidou. Her most recent feature film “Simple Passion,” adapted from the autobiographical novella by Nobel Prize winner Annie Ernaux, was an official selection of the Cannes Film Festival in 2020 and went on to play the Toronto, San Sebastián, Busan, Zurich and Sydney film festivals.\n\t\n\n\tAbbass, a Palestinian actress and filmmaker, was born in Nazareth and grew up in the small village of Deir Hanna in Galilee. She started acting in the Palestinian El-Hakawati Theater in East Jerusalem in the 80s. After a detour in London, Abbass settled in Paris.\n\n\tShe is known for her roles in “Satin Rouge,” “Paradise Now,” “Free Zone,” “Munich,” “The Visitor,” “Lemon Tree,” “In Syria,” “Blade Runner 2049” and “Gaza Mon Amour.” She has worked with directors such as Yousry Nasrallah, Hani Abu Assad, Steven Spielberg, Jim Jarmusch, Denis Villeneuve, Tom McCarthy, Terrence Malick, Eran Riklis, Radu Mihaileanu, Amos Gitai and Ridley Scott.\n\n\tShe was nominated and won awards for her performances in several films. In the last years, she gained prominence for her role as Maysa in the comedy “Ramy on Huly,” and as Marcia Roy in HBO drama series “Succession.”\n\n\tBenrachid, a French actor with South Sudanese and Chadian roots, trained at the free, alternative nonprofit film school École Kourtrajmé, founded by Ladj Ly, director of “Les Misérables,” which aims to democratize cinema by training diverse, underrepresented talent in filmmaking and visual arts. “Only Rebels Win” is his first lead role in a feature film.\n\n\tRaffaella Di Giulio, managing director, international sales and acquisitions for Fandango Sales commented: “ ‘Only Rebels Win’ is a powerful and emotionally charged love story, brought to life with remarkable cinematic force. We are extremely proud to represent the film and to collaborate with Danielle Arbid, a filmmaker we have long admired, as well as with the outstanding team at Easy Riders Films and Abbout Productions, whose commitment to bold and meaningful cinema we greatly value. We believe this work will resonate strongly with buyers and, even more importantly, with audiences, reaffirming Arbid’s unique and courageous voice.”\n\n\t“Only Rebels Win” is produced by Easy Riders Films and Abbout Productions in co-production with Rise Studios and Arab Radio and Television network in association with Les Films Pelléas, Reborn Studio, and Arte Kino Productions 22, with the support of Red Sea Souk Project Market, Hubert Bals Fund + Europe, Fonds Image de la Francophonie, Doha Film Institute and Aide aux cinémas du monde – Centre national du cinéma et de l’image animée – Institut français.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe trailer for “Supporting Role,” the second feature from Georgian writer-director Ana Urushadze, has debuted ahead of the film’s world premiere in the Tiger Competition of International Film Festival Rotterdam next month.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe film follows on from the success of Urushadze’s 2017 debut “Scary Mother,” which premiered and won best first feature at Locarno Film Festival before going on to pick up the top prize in Sarajevo. It was nominated for the European Film Academy’s Discovery Award and was Georgia’s entry for the 90th Academy Awards.\n\t\n\n\tThe story of “Supporting Role” follows a once-famous star of Georgian cinema, who – triggered by a casting session with a young female director – embarks on a bizarre and fatalistic odyssey of self-transformation. Accustomed to playing charming heroic protagonists, he is insulted by the offer of a supporting role. But gradually, without realizing it himself, he starts getting into character and seemingly unconsciously accepts the role he has been offered to play.\n\n\n\tThe film stars Dato Bakhtadze, alongside Nata Murvanidze, who led “Scary Mother,” winning best performance at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards.\n\n\tThe film is produced by Davit Tsintsadze of Georgia’s Zazafilms, Ivo Felt of Allfilm in Estonia, Zeynep Atakan of Zeyno Film in Turkey, Andrey Epifanov of Cinetrain in Switzerland, Eleonora Granata Jenkinson of Melograno Films in U.S., and Sophio Bedenashvili and Bacho Meburishvili of Enkeny Films and Bakhtadze in Georgia. \n\n\tThe film was shot on location in Georgia by Estonian cinematographer Rein Kotov. Funding came from the Georgian National Film Center, Estonian Film Institute, Estonian Cultural Endowment, MEDIA Programme of Creative Europe, Eurimages and Cinetrain.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Shorta” director Frederik Louis Hviid and leading Scandinavian filmmaker-screenwriter Tobias Lindholm (“The Investigation”) are teaming on “Torpedo,” a thriller set in the Danish organized crime underworld where kids and youngsters are weaponized. \n\n\t“Torpedo” is inspired by real events and developed from interviews with police, lawyers, researchers, reporters and young torpedoes in sheltered institutions. It’s produced by Marcella Dichmann at SF Studios and is expected to be theatrically released in 2027.\n\t\n\n\tHviid, whose feature debut “Shorta” broke through internationally after premiering at Venice in 2020, will direct “Torpedo.” He penned the film with Lindholm, best known for ”A Hijacking” and “The Investigation,” as well as the Oscar-winning “Another Round” which he co-wrote with Thomas Vinterberg.\n\n\n\t“Torpedo” tells the story of 16-year-old Kian, who realizes that he has sold drugs to the wrong people. “The responsibility for the failed deal rests squarely on his shoulders. But there is an easy fix to his problem: he just needs to get on the train from Aarhus to Copenhagen and do a small job that will make everything all right. He does not yet know how, but in the course of the next 24 hours, it dawns on him. Kian must commit the brutal murder of a man targeted by his support base. If he refuses, not only himself but also his family will be in danger,” reads the synopsis.\n\n\tHviid, who most recently helmed the award-winning TV series “Prisoner,” says, “Torpedoes are a relatively new phenomenon which spreads fast – also here in Denmark.”\n\n\t“To me it has been important to understand what happens when violence is perpetrated by young people who have not chosen to do so and who cannot yet comprehend the consequences of their actions,” Hviid continued. He pointed out the rise of child soldiers embroiled in Danish organized crime “is a matter we have rarely seen in Danish film, and hence the work on ‘Torpedo’ has required extensive research before we could achieve any measure of truth.”\n\t\n\n\tHe said, “The collaboration with Tobias, whom I believe is one of the most trend-setting voices in Danish film, has been both inspiring and essential in giving the story the heart and unrelenting realism it demands.”\n\n\tLindholm, whose latest film ”The Quiet Ones” premiered at Toronto, said, “With his focus on the scary reality in Denmark, Frederik Louis Hviid’s idea for ‘Torpedo’ moved me greatly.”\n\n\t“As evidence from the dark side of the Danish dream – and a rare opportunity to focus on the kids who disappear in the promises and lies of the world of crime,” said Lindholm, who is also developing the limited series “The Best of Us,” with “Succession” star Jeremy Strong attached to star.\n\n\tDichmann said “Torpedo” is a “film which has evolved from a deep concern for our children and youngsters. It is a painful story, but a necessary one.”\n\n\t“As a producer – and as a mother –,” she said, “I feel a strong need to create a space for reflection and understanding. It is fiction, but fiction which is frighteningly close to the reality of our daily lives.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlan Cumming is to host the 2026 EE BAFTA Film Awards, a move that’ll likely see the star bring some of his flamboyant tartan outfits from “The Traitors” to London’s Royal Festival Hall on Feb. 22. \n\n\tCumming — an actor, writer and producer whose career has spanned stage, film and television on both sides of the Atlantic, earning him Emmy, Golden Globe, Olivier and Tony awards (plus a BAFTA Scotland honor for outstanding contribution) — takes over from fellow Scot David Tennant, who was on hosting duties in both 2024 and 2025. \n\t\n\n\tEarlier this year, Cumming hosted the BAFTA TV Awards and he has overseen numerous awards shows in the U.S.. But this marks his first time hosting the U.K.’s biggest night in film.\n\n\n\t“How exciting to be back in the BAFTA fold, this time hosting the EE BAFTA Film Awards, a night like no other when we celebrate and honour creativity and craftsmanship — and also hopefully have a laugh and create some mischief as we do so!,” said Cumming in a statement. \n\n\tCumming’s selection continues BAFTA’s recent tradition of choosing hosts who can balance irreverence with reverence, as the ceremony seeks to maintain its prestige while remaining accessible to a global audience. Last year’s broadcast of the awads on BBC One attracted an average of 3 million viewers alongside more than 64 million video views across BAFTA’s social platforms.\n\n\t“With his sharp wit, warmth and vibrant energy, we are beyond excited that Alan Cumming will be hosting this year’s EE BAFTA Film Awards,” said BAFTA’s executive director of awards and content, Emma Baehr. “As we honour the outstanding talent in film that brings stories to life on screen, we know that Alan will give us an unforgettable night full of laughter, magic and plenty of surprises, and maybe some extraordinary outfits!”\n\t\n\n\tAcross a career spanning 40 years, Cumming’s own film credits include the likes of “GoldenEye,” “X2: X-Men United,” “Eyes Wide Shut” and “Emma,” while he’ll soon appear in “Avengers Doomsday.” On TV, he won a Golden Globe and an Emmy for “The Good Wife,” while he’s recently been enjoying a renewed moment of pop-culture prominence following the success of the U.S. edition of “The Traitors.” As host and executive producer of the hit reality show, he’s won four Emmys and two Critics’ Choice awards.\n\n\tRound one of voting for the BAFTA film awards opened on Dec. 5, with the longlists due to be unveiled Jan 9. and nominations to follow on Jan. 27. \n",

    "body": "\n\tNepal‘s inaugural science fiction feature film is headed to theaters, with “Eklo I” securing distribution in both its home country and North America.\n\n\tApple Entertainment has acquired the film for release in Nepal on Jan. 1, with a limited theatrical rollout in the U.S. and U.K. following on Jan. 9. The film will world premiere Dec. 28 at New York’s Museum of the Moving Image.\n\n\tJamie Bacon, whose recent credits include “Mr. Loverman” and “Dreamers,” stars opposite Nepali actor Pradeep Khadka, known for local hits “Kabaddi 4,” “Prem Geet 3” and “Prakash.” Bacon is next set to appear in Dan Fogelman’s upcoming NFL drama series for Hulu.\n\t\n\n\tDirected by Pradeep Shahi, “Eklo I” represents a significant milestone for Nepali cinema as the country’s first science fiction feature. The production filmed at elevations reaching 5,400 meters in the Himalayas – approximately 500 meters below Everest Base Camp – capturing previously unfilmed regions of the mountain range.\n\n\n\tSet in 2090 in the aftermath of a 2030 global pandemic, the story follows astronauts returning to Earth who discover a lone survivor and mysterious guardians concealed in Himalayan caves. The Nepali word ‘eklo’ translates as ‘alone’ in English.\n\n\t“This film pushed us to the limit,” Bacon said. “The locations, the altitude – nothing compares. What the Nepali crew achieved was extraordinary.”\n\n\tThe cast also features Kabita Nepali and Vijay Lama, known for “Everest.”\n\n\tDirector Shahi described the project as blending Western and Nepali storytelling influences, marking new territory for the country’s film industry.\n\t\n\n\tApple Entertainment has been expanding its international distribution slate, recently handling releases including “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” \n\n\tBacon is represented by Link Entertainment and United Agents.\n",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          According to court documents, obtained by TMZ, John had his first felony appearance before the judge in Utah on Wednesday after he allegedly harassed Britani.\n      \n    \n          Prosecutors say he's been harassing his ex ever since the protective order was put in place in 2023 -- staring at her from the distance allowed under the order, re-routing her mail, and even going as far as tampering with her electrical box at her home to interrupt her power.\n      \n\n          Fans will know Britani as the quirky housewife who is currently in an on-again-off-again relationship with Donny Osmond's nephew, Jared Osmond. John is Britani's second ex-husband, but she divorced him in 2023. Her first husband was J. Michael Bateman. It's not clear when Britani and J. Michael split.\n      \n    \n          The new legal documents also state John essentially doxed Britani earlier this month by posting her cell phone number on TikTok with the comment, \"There ya go. Give her a call.\"\n      \n    \n          According to the papers, Britani received \"unpleasant\" text messages from strangers as a result and even had \"unknown people coming to her house.\"\n      \n    \n          The docs explain that part of the protective order restricts John from all direct or indirect contact or communication with Britani, which prosecutors say he violated by posting comments on her social media posts.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to Britani's reps for comment ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Real Housewives\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

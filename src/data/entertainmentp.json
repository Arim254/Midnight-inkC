    "body": "\n\tThe Singapore International Film Festival launched its 36th edition with international star Shu Qi‘s first feature as director, marking the event’s most successful opening in its history.\n\n\tThe festival opened on Nov. 26 at Sands Theatre, Marina Bay Sands, with Shu Qi’s “Girl,” a semi-autobiographical drama set in 1980s Taipei. The director attended alongside lead actor Bai Xiao-Ying and actor-singer 9m88, joining festival ambassador Rebecca Lim and guest of honor Josephine Teo, Singapore’s Minister for Digital Development and Information.\n\t\n\n\tTicket sales surged 52% compared to the same period last year, with 33 sold-out screenings to date — four times the number from 2024. The festival is on track to achieve the highest box office sales in its 36-year history.\n\n\n\tMuch of the buzz centered on Hong Kong cinema icon Tony Leung’s appearance at a special presentation of “Silent Friend.” Both that screening and his “In Conversation With Tony Leung” session sold out within 10 minutes of tickets going on sale, ranking among the hottest tickets in SGIFF history.\n\n\tLocal productions also drew strong interest. Singaporean films “The Old Man and His Car” and “Sandbox” sold out within a day. Japanese titles including “Kokuho,” “Two Seasons Two Strangers” and “Bring Me Down to Portable Size” were among the fastest-selling international films. All titles connected to Shu Qi, including “Girl” and “Resurrection,” have sold out.\n\n\t“This year’s response has been truly overwhelming,” said Jeremy Chua, general manager of SGIFF. “The energy we’ve seen from audiences emphasizes the value of the collective experience of film. It has been a challenging year for the cinema landscape in Singapore, but what we are witnessing through SGIFF is proof that there is demand for cinema.”\n\t\n\n\tThe festival runs through Dec. 7, showcasing over 120 films from more than 45 countries, including over 30 made-in-Singapore productions and co-productions. The lineup focuses on stories of identity, resilience and rediscovery.\n\n\tThis year’s “In Conversation With” series features filmmaker Deepa Mehta, recipient of the Cinema Honorary Award; Oscar-winning actor Youn Yuh-jung, who receives the Screen Icon Award; and Hollywood-based Singaporean actor Chin Han.\n\n\tMarina Bay Sands continues its partnership with the festival, hosting the opening film and two “In Conversation With” sessions. Paul Town, chief operating officer of Marina Bay Sands, said the integrated resort’s venues provide an ideal setting for celebrating art and film.\n\n\tA frequent collaborator with Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, Shu Qi embarked on filmmaking at his suggestion. “Girl” premiered at Venice and won her the best director award at Busan International Film Festival. The film follows 10-year-old Hsiao-lee in 1980s Taipei as she navigates domestic dysfunction and forms a friendship with a precocious transfer student.\n\n\tAs an actor, Shu Qi has appeared in over 90 films, including three collaborations with Hou: “The Assassin,” “Millennium Mambo” and “Three Times.” She has won two Golden Horse Awards and three Hong Kong Film Awards.\n\n\tThe opening night red carpet drew prominent figures from Singapore’s entertainment industry, including Chin Han, Tan Kheng Hua, Lim Kay Tong, Hong Hui Fang, Jack Neo, Qi Yuwu, Yvonne Lim, Tay Ping Hui, Jeanette Aw, Lim Yu Beng, Irene Ang, Nathan Hartono and Benjamin Kheng.\n\n\tThe Singapore International Film Festival is part of the Singapore Media Festival 2025, hosted by the Infocomm Media Development Authority.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere’s less Christmas cheer than anti-Scrooge snark in “Jingle Bell Heist,” a lightweight crime caper doubling as yuletide romantic comedy. Cinematographer-turned-director Michael Fimognari, assuming both roles here, lends a pleasing look and pace to this London-set tale of two strangers uniting to rob a retail magnate during the busy holiday season. There’s a bearable level of contrivance in Abby McDonald and Amy Reed’s screenplay, as well as sufficiently appealing leads in Olivia Holt and Connor Swindells. Arriving the day before Thanksgiving, this Netflix joint isn’t likely to become anyone’s long-term seasonal fave. But it’s a pleasant diversion that springs some decent twists en route to its happy ending.\n\t\n\n\tAfter a brief prologue that sees the protagonists about to commence their inside job on Christmas Eve, we jump two weeks, before they’d met. Philly-raised Sophie (Holt) has moved to the U.K. for the free healthcare — her mother (Natasha Joseph), a native Brit, is gravely ill. When not visiting the hospital, she’s a sales clerk at Sterling’s Department Store, then moonlights at a pub. She has a bit of a Robin Hood attitude, as glimpsed early on when she pickpockets an ill-tempered man to give his money to the sidewalk buskers he’d chased away. That impulse extends to dealing with occasional rude customers at her day gig, where the coworkers are nice but the boss, family-business heir Maxwell Sterling (Peter Serafinowicz), is one nasty cold fish.\n\n\n\tNor is that man beloved by Nick (Swindells), who’s staying in a mate’s (Michael Salami) flat and working at an electronics repair shop while he “gets back on his feet” following a prison stint. What got him handed that sentence (and cost him his marriage) was a conviction for robbing Sterling’s store, after he’d been hired to install its surveillance system. But eventually we glean that was a frame-up. In any case, Nick retains access to that system, such that he catches Sophie pulling a larcenous fast one on-camera. He uses that knowledge to try coercing her into a dual theft effort. She flatly refuses, until a doctor suggests that her mum will now require advanced treatment that can only be accessed in a timely fashion through the pricey, private medical sector. So Sophie decides she’s in, after all.\n\t\n\n\tTheir initially squabbling partnership benefits from different forms of expertise, including the talent for trickery she learned from a grandfather who happened to be both a magician and locksmith. But neither are exactly criminal masterminds, leading to some clumsy intel-seeking cosplay at a Santa-themed party for grownups, then a high-end charity gala. At the latter, socially inept Nick manages to make a conquest of Maxwell’s wife Cynthia (Lucy Punch), who’s disgruntled enough to appoint herself a third plotter against her own husband.\n\n\tNone of this intrigue is terribly inspired, let alone credible, but it’s handled with a certain panache. Fimognari, who’s shot most of Mike Flanagan’s considerably darker-toned projects, eschews the usual overbright Christmas comedy aesthetic for a burnished veneer. He and his design collaborators flatter both London exteriors and luxe interiors without making the production look too much like a consumerist wish-list. Humor is underlined via some zoom-lensing and other visual punctuations, as well as Steve Hackman’s busy, antic score — in addition to the expected mixtape of Christmassy various-artists tracks, here running a less familiar gamut from Run-DMC to indie rockers Low. \n\n\tIf chemistry between Disney child star turned scream queen Holt (“Heart Eyes,” “Totally Killer”) and Swindells (of Netflix series “Sex Education”) never quite heats up, they are individually likable, and supported by a strong cast that brings personality to roles of no great written distinction. The script’s mechanizations do pay off in its last lap, when a decent climactic setpiece gives way to a comeuppance that wisely delivers what we really want: not a romantic clinch, but a villain exposed and undone. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Stranger Things” briefly pulled Netflix into the Upside Down.\n\n\tThe streamer crashed at 5 p.m. PT on Wednesday, just as the highly anticipated fifth season of the sci-fi series premiered.\n\n\tThe service was down for about three minutes and continues to have bugs for some users. Tens of thousands of people who logged on to watch the sci-fi series were met with an image from “Nailed It!” with the caption: “Something went wrong. Sorry, we’re having trouble with your request. You’ll find lots to explore on the home page.”\n\t\n\n\tBy 5:05 p.m., the site seemed to be up and running for most users. Variety reached out to the streamer for comment; according to a Netflix spokesperson, “Some members briefly experienced an issue streaming on TV devices, but service recovered for all accounts within five minutes.”\n\n\n\tThis isn’t the first time Netflix has been overloaded by “Stranger Things” traffic. In July 2022, Variety reported that the streamer was unavailable for a brief period as the final two episodes of Season 4 dropped. Users also experienced Netflix outages during the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul fight, which was one of the first live-streamed events on the platform.\n\n\t“Stranger Things” returns with the first batch of episodes from its final season, more than three years after the finale of Season 4. The new episodes will find the Hawkins kids as they seek to find and kill the monstrous Vecna. The town is under military quarantine as Eleven hides from the authorities.\n\n\tCreated by Matt and Ross Duffer, “Stranger Things” stars Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, Maya Hawke, Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Cara Buono, Priah Ferguson, Eduardo Franco, Brett Gelman, Dacre Montgomery, Matthew Modine, Paul Reiser, Jamie Campbell Bower, Grace Van Dien, Robert Englund, Tyner Rushing and Raphael Luce.\n\t\n\n\tThe series remains one of Netflix’s most-watched series of all time.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAhead of the release of “Stranger Things 5,” which dropped on Netflix at 8 p.m. EST on Wednesday, series creator Ross Duffer posted a PSA on Instagram, walking viewers through their television settings to ensure that everything is set up for a proper viewing experience.\n\n\tWith the camera facing his TV, Duffer narrates, “A little PSA before you watch tonight. I want to make sure that your TVs are set up properly.” While acknowledging that different TVs will have different displays, he navigates viewers to settings, then picture mode settings and then expert controls before encouraging people to turn all of the expert controls off. On Duffer’s TV, this included dynamic contrast, super resolution, edge enhancer and color filter, all of which he deemed “garbage.”\n\t\n\n\n\tDuffer then goes back to picture options, where he shows that noise reduction should be turned off, as well as, “the worst offender of all, truemotion or smoothmotion,” which creates “the dreaded soap opera effect.”\n\n\n\tDuffer continues that on most TVs, enabling the expert vision— in his case, Dolby Vision-Movie Dark mode— will resolve most of the issues, but not all of them. He thus encourages viewers to double check, and warns that “whatever you do, do not switch anything on ‘vivid’ because it’s gonna turn on all the worst offenders. It’s gonna destroy the color and it’s not the filmmaker’s intent.”\n\n\tDuffer would understand that intent, as he and his brother Matt directed three of “Stranger Things 5: Volume 1’s” four episodes. The one outlier, Episode 3, was directed by Frank Darabont. Volume 2 will release the next three episodes of “Stranger Things 5” on Christmas Day and then the finale will release in theaters and on Netflix on New Year’s Eve.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWomen in Film India is addressing the emotional toll of working in the entertainment industry with a new mental wellness program designed specifically for women filmmakers.\n\n\tThe organization has launched “The Resilience Playbook,” a six-week workshop series focused on mental well-being and emotional sustainability for women working in Indian cinema. The immersive program aims to provide participants with tools to manage the pressures of an industry characterized by constant reinvention, rejection, and demanding work conditions.\n\t\n\n\tLed by wellness practitioner and life coach Chetna Chakravarthy, the workshops go beyond traditional self-care approaches to focus on building confidence, clarity, and self-worth as professional skills essential to creative longevity. The peer-driven format allows women filmmakers to rebuild balance and reconnect with their creative practice in a supportive environment.\n\n\n\tThe initiative comes as global conversations around burnout and mental health increasingly reshape creative industries, with WIF India positioning emotional well-being as a professional necessity rather than a personal luxury.\n\n\t“We are an industry built on freelancers, a creative ecosystem that thrives on independent talent. But with that comes a great deal of uncertainty,” said Guneet Monga Kapoor, Academy Award-winning producer (“The Elephant Whisperers”) and founder of WIF India. “For creativity to truly flow, what one needs most is resilience. It is the core skill that allows us to endure, to adapt, and to carve out our place in this ever-changing industry.”\n\t\n\n\tThe program addresses challenges particularly acute for women in film, who often face systemic inequities and heightened scrutiny alongside the long hours, erratic schedules, and relentless pace common to filmmaking. WIF India notes that while conversations around opportunity and representation have expanded, the emotional cost of sustaining careers in the industry remains largely unexamined.\n\n\t“This programme is our safe harbor, a place to drop the armor, soften, and still feel powerful,” said Rabia Chopra, head of programs and development at WIF India. “Vulnerability is our sharpest intelligence, and resilience is what we build when we hold each other up.”\n\n\tWIF India is subsidizing the workshop to make it accessible to participants. Monga Kapoor emphasized the organization’s commitment to providing these resources, noting Chakravarthy’s impact on her personally and professionally.\n\n\tThe initiative represents WIF India’s broader mission to redefine empowerment in cinema beyond visibility and access to include balance, belonging, and the emotional foundation necessary for sustained creative work.\n\n\tThe initiative was unveiled on the sidelines of the WAVES Film Bazaar, the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tAndy and Barbara Muschietti are best known as the brother-sister director-producer duo behind the “It” films and the HBO prequel series, “It: Welcome to Derry.” But this year, they executive produced an entirely new project about real-world horrors and disappearances that took place in their home country of Argentina.\n\n\t“Norita” is a documentary directed by Jayson McNamara and Andrea Carbonatto Tortonese. It tells the story of Nora “Norita” Cortinas, the mother of an Argentinian activist who disappeared during the country’s 1970s junta dictatorship. Cortinas’ efforts for the government to reveal the truth about her son’s whereabouts sparked the Madres de Plaza de Mayo movement, where the mothers of revolutionaries protested and pressured the despotic government for information about their missing children.\n\t\n\n\tThe Muschiettis joined the project after watching McNamara’s prior documentary, “Messenger on a White Horse,” which explored English-Argentinian journalist Robert Cox’s bold efforts to cover the Madres de Plaza de Mayo during the dictatorship. \n\n\n\tAndy and Barbara grew up during Argentina’s dictatorial regime, so the topic struck a personal nerve with them. “We are Argentinian. We spent our childhoods in Argentina during the dictatorship. I was five years old when the military took hold of the country, and I was 13 when democracy came back,” Barbara told Variety.\n\n\tIn addition to the Muschiettis, Jane Fonda also joined “Norita” as an executive producer. “Jane Fonda got involved at the same time I did, and my God, I thought I knew everything, but then I met this woman. I’ve never met anybody like her. She is such a powerhouse and relentless,” continued Barbara. “We did a screening at the Museum of Tolerance a month ago, and she came and presented it and her speech moved me to tears. She understands that this movie is about Norita, but it’s also about what the U.S. is living with right now. She understands that there’s a comfort in being American that allows people to think that things like what happened in the film will never happen here, but that’s not reality. The reality is that it can happen and people have to start paying attention.”\n\t\n\n\tThe documentary’s timeliness for America and for any place enduring a tumultuous political climate is self-evident. What is more nuanced, however, is how the doc fits in with the Muschiettis’ larger filmography. While the filmmakers are Argentinian, their most well-known works are Stephen King adaptations about kids fighting off a killer clown demon in Maine. On the surface, it’s a long way off from Buenos Aires.\n\n\tHowever, there are overlapping themes between the projects. “Norita,” in many ways, explores the real-world manifestations of the horrors “It” alludes to. In “It”‘s setting of Derry, Maine, people go missing at troubling rates, yet people remain complicit out of fear. While the culprit in the fictional town may be a paranormal entity embodied by Pennywise the Clown, he is but a symbol of American colonization, racism, trauma and exclusion, as brought to the surface in the many power struggles depicted in “It: Welcome to Derry.”\n\n\t“Andy and I read the book when we were, I believe, 14 and 15. It was two years after the end of the junta and the return of Democracy,” recalled Barbara. “And we fell into that book like we’d never fell into anything before. It was just crazy and a big part of it was that it was about the weaponization of fear, which is what Pennywise does so well. Of course, that felt very familiar to us.”\n\n\t“Norita” had its world premiere at the Dances With Films Film Festival in Los Angeles in June and has since played at over a dozen festivals around the world. It is currently campaigning for awards consideration. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s been three and a half years since the most recent season of “Stranger Things” kicked off in May 2022. The first episode of the hit series’ fifth and final installment — delayed by dual Hollywood strikes and the mounting production value of a show that’s ballooned from surprise breakout to blockbuster franchise — opens in the fall of 1987. That’s 18 months after the events of Season 4, which concluded with archvillain Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) rupturing the metaphysical border between our reality and the alternate dimension known as the Upside Down, and four years from Season 1, which kicked off in November 1983. Which means that the real-life gap between two individual seasons of “Stranger Things” is dangerously close to that of the entire canonical span of “Stranger Things.” That factoid is absurd enough on its face, illustrating the escalating tax on viewers’ patience from a medium once defined by consistent, predictable output. (“Stranger Things” is far from the sole culprit: “Severance,” another streaming-native genre sensation, is a prime example.) But it also sums up the challenge facing the brainchild of twins Matt and Ross Duffer as their show steers into its home stretch, an eight-episode season broken up into three chunks, with the first dropping on Thanksgiving eve. “Stranger Things” is a story about children — and, more than that, the innocence of childhood, pitting a scrappy gang of bike-riding Dungeons & Dragons nerds against misguided adults who mess around with forces they don’t understand — that’s gone on long enough to see its cast grow up, with all the tensions that come with that glaring contrast. The list of data points is long. Millie Bobby Brown, who broke out as the telekinetic, “E.T.”-esque Eleven, is now the married mother of an adopted baby girl. Voices have dropped; IMDb pages have lengthened. For some of the series leads, the time between their casting and the finale’s premiere will encompass more than half their lives. But what matters to this reviewer is how these changes manifest in the show — or rather, don’t. The truth is that “Stranger Things” itself has not reflected its stars’ obvious maturation with an accompanying complexity. All of “Stranger Things” is an exercise in nostalgia. In Season 5, the show now seems to pine not just for the neon hues and synth-driven pop of the 1980s it conjures so evocatively, but for a simpler time in its own run that can’t be brought back, no matter how high the budget. Though if anything, “Stranger Things” has only gotten less rough-edged over time. Remember when Hopper (David Harbour) was an alcoholic who smoked? The four episodes that comprise Volume 1 unsurprisingly walk back the Season 4 cliffhanger. Hawkins, Indiana, has not turned into a hellscape of Demogorgons and slimy vines. Instead, the town has been put under military quarantine, occupied by the same foolhardy industrial complex that started this whole mess in the first place. With Matthew Modine’s Dr. Brenner now dead, the deep state’s latest ambassador is Dr. Kay (Linda Hamilton), a scientist and officer who commands an entire base constructed within the Upside Down. Uncle Sam has stapled over most of Vecna’s rifts with crude metal plates, but left just enough open to use for his own ends. This human-made bubble makes Season 5 more geographically focused than its predecessor, which put thousands of miles between groups of the protagonists. That pays off in more concise run times than the bloat of Season 4, yet the return to Hawkins underlines the familiarity of the setups. In lieu of a mall, this year’s throwback locale is a radio station staffed by lovable burnouts Robin (Maya Hawke) and Steve (Joe Keery), who use the airwaves to send coded messages to their compatriots. The team once again splits up in the name of completing a sequence of self-assigned side quests before inevitably reuniting later in the season. Steve, his ex-girlfriend Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and her current boyfriend Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) continue to litigate their series-long love triangle. The same pieces are on the board, in only slightly different configurations. Season 5 shows us more of the Upside Down, and at a greater scale, than “Stranger Things” ever has before. Hopper embarks on his regular patrol of its terrain to search for Vecna, who’s disappeared since he was injured in the Season 4 finale, and his adopted daughter Eleven joins soon after; the pair remain there for the duration of Volume 1. These scenes showcase the production’s increasing technical abilities, realizing this other world more immersively than ever. But after last season’s revelation that Vecna governs the Upside Down and controls its inhabitants via hive mind, Season 5 hasn’t yet added to our understanding of the realm, either in mechanics or as metaphor. Only the scope changes, not the approach. The “Stranger Things” version of evolution is that our heroes now use radio waves, not D&D creatures, as their analogy of choice for sussing out how the Upside Down functions where science could not. Once, these frameworks were endearing instances of middle-schoolers making sense of the nonsensical. Coming from actors mostly old enough to be college graduates, the relative haziness of the world-building starts to peek through. To the extent “Stranger Things” conveys its main characters’ expanding emotional lives as they plunge ever further into adolescence, it’s through Vecna’s original prey Will Byers (Noah Schnapp), who comes to terms with his homosexuality in tandem with his enduring connection to the Upside Down. Will bonds with Robin, the only other queer person he knows, over his fear and uncertainty. Robin’s advice mostly boils down to “be yourself” platitudes, yet Hawke — who quite literally has stardom in her blood — sells them. But in lieu of giving a similar treatment to the rest of the Hellfire Club, “Stranger Things” shows its hand by effectively swapping them for a new generation of kids who have the cuteness factor they used to. Holly Wheeler (Nell Fisher), the baby sister of Nancy and Mike (Finn Wolfhard), gains new prominence as the latest Hawkins resident caught in the clutches of the paranormal. Her classmate Derek Turnbow (Jake Connelly), derided by his peers as “Dipshit Derek,” provides some of the comic relief Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) once did. It’s no coincidence Fisher and Connelly are basically the same age their older castmates were back in 2016, when “Stranger Things” first set the world on fire. Holly’s interpretive lens of choice is “A Wrinkle in Time,” not a fantasy role-playing game, but she’s another kid confronting the unknown using the tools at her disposal, with grown-ups more a hindrance than a help. As it hurtles toward a final showdown with Vecna, “Stranger Things” is resetting the clock rather than riding its forward momentum. The Duffers have always worn their influences with pride, and the specters of Steven Spielberg and Stephen King helped jump-start the series into a phenomenon. But in its last hours, “Stranger Things” remains primarily pastiche, so indebted to inherited archetypes (mad scientist, reformed bully) and references (The Clash, Peanut Butter Boppers) that its main cultural impact comes from extratextual elements like casting and the ascendance of Netflix. By declining to enrich its characters as they age, “Stranger Things” traps itself in arrested development. When you get bigger without going deeper, you end up stretched thin.\n",

Season 5 will take place 18 months after the events of Season 4, where the small town of Hawkins, Indiana, is under military control and quarantined as both the Upside Down and the real world collide. As the Hawkins group gets closer to finding and killing the evil monster Vecna, they are faced with the threat of saving humanity before it’s too late.\n\n\tThe main cast is back, including Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Sadie Sink, Joe Keery and more. New cast members for Season 5 include Nell Fisher, Linda Hamilton, Alex Breaux and Jake Connelly.\n\n\tEven though this is the final season, “Stranger Things” will be back for more spooky adventures. An animated spinoff, titled “Stranger Things: Tales From ’85,” will release next year and take place between Seasons 2 and 3. There’s also the hit Broadway show, “Stranger Things: The First Shadow,” that takes place before the events of the show and uncovers Vecna’s origins in 1959 with younger versions of the adult cast members.\n\n\tHere’s a guide to who is back for Season 5 of “Stranger Things” and what they’ve done in the nine years since the show began.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEleven (Millie Bobby Brown)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tA young girl with telepathic and psychokinetic powers, Eleven is a test experiment from Hawkins National Laboratory who escapes and finds safety in the town. Eleven eventually becomes adopted by Hopper and changes her name to Jane and begins getting adjusted to her normal life with the other kids of Hawkins. Outside of “Stranger Things,” Millie Bobby Brown has starred in the “Enola James” franchise, two “Godzilla” movies, the “Electric State” and more. In 2024, she married Jake Bongiovi, son of musician Jon Bon Jovi, and the couple adopted a daughter in 2025.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe middle child of the Wheeler Family, Mike is one of Will Byers’ best friends and one of the leaders of the Hawkins group. In Season 1, Mike and Eleven get closer to one another and throughout the series, begin a romantic relationship with each other. Wolfhard has co-directed and co-written Neon’s “Hell of a Summer” with Billy Byrk and has starred in projects such as Guillermo del Toro’s “Pinocchio,” “Saturday Night,” and “The Legend of Ochi.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDustin Henderson (Gaten Matarazzo)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tOne of Will’s best friends, Dustin is one of the members of the Party and often teams up with Steve and the rest of the Hawkins team to solve what’s going on in the Upside Down. As a self-proclaimed player of Dungeons and Dragons along with Lucas, Mike and Will, Dustin is always planning ahead strategically. Matarazzo has voiced characters in projects such as “Lego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy” and “Angry Birds 2” and starred in the 2023 revival of “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street” as Tobias Ragg. He also hosted a prank show called “Prank Encounters” for two seasons.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCaleb McLaughlin returns as Lucas Sinclair, an original member of the show’s young ensemble and the on-and-off love-interest of Max Mayfield. Though Lucas briefly separated from the group when he joined the Hawkins High School basketball team in Season 4, by the end of that season, he was back with his friends and at Max’s side when she fought off Vecna. Outside of “Stranger Things,” McLaughlin has starred in “High Flying Bird,” “Concrete Cowboy,” “The Book of Clarence,” “The Deliverance” and more.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWill Byers (Noah Schnapp)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Stranger Things” all began with the disappearance of Will Byers in the first episode of Season 1. Though he is rescued at the end of the first season, Will never quite shakes his unique connection to the Upside Down, often enduring telekinetic and foreboding visions throughout the series. Noah Schnapp has grown up with the character, having been cast as the youngest member of the main ensemble in Season 1. He’s also appeared in “Hubie Halloween,” “Abe,” “Waiting for Anya” and more.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMax Mayfield (Sadie Sink)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSadie Sink made her debut as the clever and fearless Max Mayfield in Season 2. By Season 3, Max was dating Lucas, and by Season 4, they had broken up. Nevertheless, they reunited as she became the target of Vecna. With the help of her friends and a Kate Bush cassette tape, Max played a pivotal role in defeating Vecna at the end of Season 4, but ended the finale comatose and possibly still unsafe as her mind is splintered between the real world and the Upside Down. Sink will appear in next year’s “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” and previously starred in “The Whale,” two “Fear Street” movies, Taylor Swift’s “All Too Well” short film and Broadway’s “John Proctor Is the Villain.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSteve Harrington (Joe Keery)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJoe Keery stars as the high school heartthrob Steve Harrington, a popular student who also happens to be Nancy Wheeler’s boyfriend when the show starts. By Season 2, he and Nancy break up but manage to remain friends. Steve establishes himself as the “unofficial” babysitter for the younger kids, as he is often left to look after them.\n\n\tKeery has since starred in several other shows like “Fargo” and “No Activity” as well as films “Molly’s Game,” “Slice,” “Spree,” “Free Guy” and “Marmalade.” The actor also embarked on a solo music career and has released albums “Twenty Twenty” and “Decide” under the stage name Djo. His recent album, “The Crux,” was released in April 2025.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRobin Buckley (Maya Hawke) \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tMaya Hawke portrays Robin Buckley, a witty, multilingual co-worker and close friend of Steve after working together at the Scoops Ahoy ice cream shop and later the video store. Their friendship grows after Buckley comes out as a lesbian in the third season.\n\n\tHawke, the daughter of Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman, has appeared in various projects since joining the series in Season 3. She has starred in films like “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” “Do Revenge,” “Asteroid City,” “Maestro” and voiced Anxiety in “Inside Out 2.” Her upcoming projects include roles in “The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping,” the Billy Wilder biopic “Wilder & Me” and romantic comedy “Wishful Thinking.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJoyce Byers (Winona Ryder)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe mother of Will and Jonathan Byers, Joyce is a single mother who is dedicated to protecting her children and protecting the town of Hawkins from the danger that lurks in the Upside Down. Throughout the show, Joyce teams up with the kids of Hawkins and Hopper as she protects Will after he returns from the Upside Down in Season 2. Since starring in “Stranger Things,” Ryder has reprised her role as Lydia Deetz in “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJim Hopper (David Harbour)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJim Hopper is the chief of Hawkins Police Department, where he oversees the town from criminal activity. After the death of his daughter Sara from cancer, Hopper takes in Eleven as her father figure and guides her throughout her adolescence as her powers grow stronger. Throughout the series, Hopper and Joyce also develop feelings for one another. Harbour has also starred in “Thunderbolts*,” “Black Widow,” “Violent Night,” “Hellboy,” “Gran Turismo” and “Creature Commandos.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tMike’s older sister, Nancy Wheeler is an inquisitive and ambitious hero, determined to get to the bottom of all of Hawkins’ secrets, be them paranormal or otherwise. Though she has been dating Jonathan Byers since Season 2, their relationship has been rocky and she remains the pivotal vertex in the love-triangle with Jonathan and Steve Harrington. Natalia Dyer has played the character since Season 1 and also appeared in “Velvet Buzzsaw,” “Based on a True Story” and more.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWill Byers’ older brother and Nancy Wheeler’s boyfriend, Jonathan is a reserved young man who has run the gamut of emotions since his debut as a wallflowery teenage shutterbug in Season 1.

Larrana told cops she was terrified because she isn't familiar with all the laws, even though she's in the country legally on a visa.\n      \n\n          As a result, Larrana did an internet search for how to contact law enforcement, which she believes Garrick found out about because he deactivated the Wi-Fi on her devices.\n      \n    \n          Even though she didn't want Garrick arrested, the police busted him anyway on charges of domestic violence, according to the affidavit.\n      \n    \n          Garrick and Larrana wed in October 2024 and welcomed a daughter this past July.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He is in a plural marriage with his first wife, Dannielle.

So, cut to September 27, when Bri indeed touched down in Dubai for work. She says everything was fine until she tried to leave on October 12.\n      \n\n          According to docs, obtained by TMZ, officials at the airport told Bri she was under investigation and she'd been slapped with a travel ban. She says police showed her the tweets she'd allegedly posted, bashing Tate ... but Bri says they're all fabricated BS.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Bottom line, police took her phone and for the next 6 weeks Bri was interrogated multiple times and unable to return to the United States. She says she even went to the U.S. Embassy, but was told they couldn't help her. Meanwhile, she started getting threatening DMs on social media saying, among other things, \"Tate's gonna get you.\" According to the docs, she believes Tate's \"minions\" were doing the online harassing.\n      \n    \n          She says her fears were amped up when she saw reports Tate and his brother Tristan had arrived in Dubai. As we reported, Bri got a restraining order against Tate in September ... banning him from being near her, or contacting her in any way, for 3 years. If he were responsible for the harassing messages, that would be a violation of the order.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Bri's amended lawsuit, filed Wednesday by attorney Tony Buzbee, accuses Tate of false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress ... which is on top of the sexual assault allegation in the original lawsuit she filed earlier this year.\n      \n    \n          In the docs, Bri doesn't explain how she eventually got out of U.A.E. ... but says she returned home to Los Angeles around November 21.\n      \n    \n          We've reached out to Tate for comment ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      ",

    "body": "\n\tActor Zachary Levi will host “David: King of Israel,” a four part docudrama slated to debut on the Fox Nation streaming service in the first quarter of 2026, extending a growing library of content that tilts toward aficionados of faith and spirituality.\n\n\tThe series will, in weekly installments, tell the story of David, who rose to become King of Israel, and who Christians regard as the ancestor of Jesus Christ. \n\n\n\t“Zachary Levi was a natural fit for this series. His sincerity and connection to the material allow King David’s story to come alive in a way that feels relevant to today’s viewers,” said Lauren Petterson, president of Fox Nation, in a statement. “Highlighting faith, redemption, and extraordinary purpose, we’re honored to bring this story to Fox Nation with Zachary at the helm.”  \n\t\n\n\tThe series will chronicle David’s life from young shepherd to ruler through reenactments, expert commentary and Levi’s narration. \n\n\n\n\n\t“Aside from the account of Christ, the story of David is the most powerful in all of scripture. In fact, one might argue that it’s even more powerful in some ways, given that David was fully human, and therefore flawed, like us, making his journey more relatable to our own,” Levi said in a statement. “It’s a story I’ve wanted to be a part of telling ever since I was a child, so it was such a blessing being a part of this production.”\n\n\tFox Nation has in recent months worked to broaden its offering in faith-based content. The service also features two seasons of “The Saints,” a documentary series backed by Martin Scorsese. Fox News Media recently said it had licensed a 52-episode “Life of Jesus” podcast, a previously-created audio program that utilizes the voices of Kristen Bell, Sean Astin and Malcom McDowell, among others.\n\t\n\n\tLev has appeared in the play “She Loves Me” and the Amazon streaming series “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” He is also known for starring in films based on the DC Comics character Shazam as well as the NBC series “Chuck,” among other projects.   \n",

    "body": "\n\tRaul Malo, whose rich voice was the defining train of the Mavericks, the fittingly named group who brought Latin flavor and lively rock vibe to country music in the 1990s, died on Monday, the band announced on social media. No cause of death was cited, but he announced back in June that he was battling Stage 4 colon cancer; he was 60.\n\n\tMalo co-wrote many of the band’s most popular songs, along with Rick Trevino’s 2003 hit “In My Dreams,” and also worked as a solo performer and a member of the Los Super Seven supergroup. The Mavericks split in 1999 but reformed in 2015 and toured regularly. He released nine solo albums and a dozen studio efforts with the Mavericks, the most recent being 2024’s “Moon & Stars.”\n\t\n\n\t“Anyone with the pleasure of being in Raul’s orbit knew that he was a force of human nature, with an infectious energy,” the band wrote on Instagram. “Over a career of more than three decades entertaining millions around the globe, his towering creative contributions and unrivaled, generational talent created the kind of multicultural American music reaching far beyond America itself.”\n\n\n\n\tWhile the entire band was a powerhouse, as lead singer Malo brought not only strong, soulful vocals that could veer between a Roy Orbison-esque baritone croon and country twang, but a genial humor that often manifested itself during the group’s concerts. The Mavericks earned their chops playing South Florida bars and frequently worked covers into their set; this writer can remember seeing them perform an impromptu version of “Moon River” that was sung unforgettably by Malo.\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Miami in 1965 to Cuban parents, Malo first united with the future Mavericks in 1989 as a rock band called the Basics. Malo initially was on bass and backing vocals, along with lead singer-guitarist Robert Reynolds, drummer Paul Deaking and lead guitarist Ben Peeler. Yet the band’s formula gelled when Malo and Reynolds switched places, with the former eventually becoming the primary songwriter and producer.\n\n\tThe group released their self-titled debut album in 1990 and followed with “From Hell to Paradise” two years later. But they broke through with 1994’s “What a Crying Shame,” scoring hits with the title track and “There Goes My Heart.” The band’s popularity rose through the ‘90s, scoring a major country hit with “All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down,” featuring Tex-Mex star Flaco Jiménez, and winning several CMA awards.\n\n\tYet the band split in 1999 and Malo embarked on a solo career, releasing albums through 2023 that found him exploring multiple different genres, often backed by orchestration or singing in Spanish. The Maverick’s reunited in 2011, signed with Big Machine Records and enjoyed a second successful run, touring regularly and releasing several albums for the label before going independent.\n\n\tMalo announced his illness in 2024 and, as noted by Rolling Stone, the group played the latest of their annual concerts at Nashville’s Ryman Auditorium just a few days ago. “The shows were celebratory, deeply emotional homages to Malo and his impact on music, featuring special guests like Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle, and Maggie Rose,” the publication wrote. “Malo, who received the American Eagle Award from the National Music Council of the United States, couldn’t attend but sent an acceptance letter to be read.”\n\n\t“Music has been the guiding force of my entire life. It carried me from my Cuban American childhood in Miami to stages across the world. It introduced me to my brothers, the Mavericks. It gave me a home in Nashville, Tennessee. It allowed me to raise my three incredible sons, Dino, Vincent, and Max, who are my greatest pride and joy. And it connected me to you fans whose love has sustained me through every chapter of this journey,” it read.\n\n\t“In these past months, I’ve had to fight battles I’ve never imagined,” his note concluded. “But on the hardest of days, music remained my companion. Your letters, your stories of how a song helped you through loss, heartbreak, joy, those became our songs. You all carried me more than you know… Thank you for giving my voice a place to live, even when my body cannot be the one delivering it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Jurassic World: Chaos Theory,” “Firebuds,” and “Let’s Go Bananas” are among the winners of this year’s Velma Awards.\n\n\tThe second annual awards honor LGBTQ representation in kids and family programming.\n\n\t“Jurassic World: Chaos Theory” takes home The Best Queer Break Up That’s Just a Break Up Award; “Firebuds” wins the The One Mom is Good But Two Moms Are Great Award; and “Let’s Go Bananas” wins The Show So Great and Inclusive We Wish It Would Adopt Us Award.\n\t\n\n\tOther winners are “The Bravest Knight,” “Jane,” “Fionna & Cake,” “The Fabulous Show with Fay and Fluffy,” and “Bearbrick.” Longtime PBS executive Linda Simensky receives the Legacy Award for her work on “Arthur.”\n\n\n\tThe Velmas are presented by The Rainbow Project, an organization founded in 2024 by Chris Nee, Kristi Reed and Jeremy Blacklow to further LGBTQ+ representation in children’s media. The organization champions queer narratives in children’s and family programming as well as behind-the-scenes artists, producers, writers and executives that advocate for LGBTQ+ inclusion in children’s storytelling.\n\n\tThe awards arrive at a time when queer media is in jeopardy, with the number of eligible honorees dropping nearly 40 percent from last year, Blacklow said: “This year, celebrating these victories is not just important — it’s urgent. These creators aren’t simply making content. They are holding ground on behalf of a generation of queer youth.”\n\n\tNee added, “It was always hard to get LGBTQ+ narratives approved, but now it’s nearly impossible. None of these wins happened by accident — they are the result of someone advocating fiercely behind the scenes.” Meanwhile, Reed summed up the awards’ value by stating, “Queer visibility in children’s media is not optional — it’s essential. When young viewers see themselves and their families reflected authentically on screen, it affirms that they belong.”\n\t\n\n\tSee the full list of award categories and winners below.\n\n\tBest Queer Break Up, That’s Just a Break Up“Jurassic World: Chaos Theory”S2 E5 “Boiling Over”Netflix\n\n\tThe One Mom Is Good But Two Moms Are Great“Firebuds” S2 E24 “A Family Tradition”Disney Junior / Disney+\n\n\tThe Show So Great and Inclusive We Wish It Would Adopt Us Award “Let’s Go Bananas”S1 E26 “Reunion at the Orchard”CBC Kids / CBC Gem\n\n\tRespecting Pronouns & Gender Identity Is So Simple Even a Preschooler Can Understand It Award“The Bravest Knight”S2B E 208 “The Dragon’s Tower”Hulu\n\n\tMost Adorkable Dads Who Say “I Love You” Award“Jane”S3 E3 “Say It Out Loud”Apple TV\n\n\tMost Fabulous Celebration of All the Shades of Queerness“Fionna & Cake”The Entire ShowHBO Max\n\n\tThe Preschool Teachers We All Wish We Had Award“The Fabulous Show with Fay and Fluffy”The Entire ShowYouTube\n\n\tThe “Let’s Be Clear, I Have Two Moms” Award“Bearbrick”S1, Ep. 6Apple TV\n\n\tLegacy AwardLinda Simensky (“Arthur”)PBS\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDavid Ellison fought hard to win Warner Bros. Discovery. But despite his strenuous efforts, he lost out to Netflix — and now Ellison is switching from carrots to sticks: Paramount Skydance is taking its case directly to shareholders in a hostile takeover bid for WBD.\n\n\tNew details disclosed in a Paramount SEC filing reveal the lengths Ellison went to try to clinch a pact with David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery. Ellison courted Zaslav as hard as he could: He hosted Zaslav at a dinner with his father, Larry Ellison. David Ellison met with Zaslav at the latter’s home in Beverly Hills to discuss a potential deal. And Larry Ellison met over a videoconference with Zaslav and John Malone, chairman emeritus of Warner Bros. and a major shareholder, to “discuss Paramount’s interest in a combination with Warner Bros.,” per the filing. \n\t\n\n\tDavid Ellison and his teams at Paramount Skydance, together with their outside legal and financial advisory firms, worked over Thanksgiving to put together a more compelling offer to buy all of WBD — ultimately extending an all-cash offer of $30/share, with an equity value of $77.9 billion. Ellison even offered offered Zaslav a co-CEO and co-chairman role in a combined Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\n\tBut the board of WBD rejected every proposal Ellison put forward, and on Friday, Dec. 5, the company announced a deal with Netflix to sell Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max in a deal with an equity value of $72 billion.\n\n\t“Paramount made six proposals over 12 weeks to the Warner Bros. Board,” culminating in the all-cash offer of $30 per share on Dec. 4, according to the Paramount Skydance filing outlining the parameters of its WBD takeover efforts and the background to the negotiations. “The final proposal stated Paramount was ready to immediately sign the transaction, accompanied by fully executable agreements with fully committed debt financing and fully committed equity financing from the Ellison family. Despite these facts, the Warner Bros. Board and its advisors chose on that pivotal December 4th to make no effort to even speak with Paramount or its representatives about anything. Instead, the Warner Bros. Board, in possession of a $30 per share cash offer with a clearer and faster path to regulatory approval, committed Warner Bros. and its stockholders to an obviously financially inferior transaction” — the Netflix agreement — “with extraordinary regulatory risk and a longer timeline to a possible closing.”\n\t\n\n\tEllison, who felt the WBD board hadn’t treated him fairly, wasn’t done fighting to get his hands on the prize. On Monday, Paramount Skydance announced its intention to stage a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. “We’re taking our offer directly to shareholders because they deserve transparency and the ability to make an informed decision,” Ellison told investors on a call. “Our proposal is superior to Netflix’s in every dimension, higher headline value, increased certainty in that value, greater regulatory certainty and a pro-Hollywood, pro-consumer and pro competition future. We’re confident that once shareholders have the opportunity to choose for themselves, they’ll choose Paramount.”\n\n\tOn Dec. 4, following Paramount’s submission of a $30/share offer to the WBD board, Ellison sent the following text to Zaslav: “Just tried calling you about new bid we have submitted. I heard you on all your concerns and believe we have addressed them in our new proposal. Please give me a call back when you can to discuss in detail.” \n\n\tAt approximately 4 p.m. ET on Dec. 4 — “having heard nothing all day,” per the Paramount filing — Ellison sent the following text to Zaslav: “Daivd [sic], I appreciate you’re underwater today so I wanted to send you a quick text. Please note when you next meet as a board we wanted to offer you a package that addressed all of the issues you discussed we [sic] me. Those were 1 we wanted to offer complete certainty 2 strong cash value 3 speed to close. Please note importantly we did not include ‘best and final’ in our bid. Also please know despite the noise of the last 24 hours I have nothing but respect and admiration for you and the company. It would be the honor of a lifetime to be your partner and to be the owner of these iconic assets. If we have the privilege to work together you will see that my father and I are the people you had dinner with. We are always loyal and honorable to our partners and hope we have the opportunity to prove that to you. Best, David.”\n\n\tNeither Zaslav nor any representative of WBD responded, according to Paramount.\n\n\tAt approximately 11 p.m. ET on Dec. 4, news outlets (including Variety) began reporting that Warner Bros. had entered into an exclusivity agreement with Netflix.\n\t\n\n\tAs revealed in Paramount’s SEC filing, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount spent a lot of time fighting over the terms of a confidentiality agreement that would require “no contact with the Warner Bros. Board or any other person at Warner Bros. other than Mr. Zaslav, a requirement to seek permission before Paramount could engage with any debt or equity financing sources and a broad waiver of claims and challenges against Warner Bros. and its representatives relating to Warner Bros.’ sale process.”\n\n\tWBD and Paramount also tussled over foreign financing, reflecting Warner Bros. Discovery’s desire to steer the deal away from review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the U.S. government’s interagency body that reviews foreign investments in U.S. businesses potential national security risks.\n\n\tAccording to Paramount’s deal terms to acquire WBD, the three Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds (Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi) and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners are backing the $30/share offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, along with Larry Ellison, RedBird Capital Partners. But the Arab wealth funds and Kushner’s Affinity “have agreed to forgo any governance rights — including board representation — associated with their non-voting equity investments.” As such, the deal would not require CFIUS review, according to Paramount. In addition, Chinese internet company Tencent, which had previously committed $1 billion toward the WBD takeover deal, is no longer a financing partner.\n\n\tMeanwhile, before the Skydance-Paramount deal, Warner Bros. Discovery and Shari Redstone’s Paramount Global talked about combinations in 2023 and 2024. As Variety has previously reported, Zaslav had met with Paramount’s then-CEO Bob Bakish in December 2023 to explore a possible WBD-Paramount merger. WBD and Paramount execs continued discussions through April of 2024 and the companies engaged in “mutual due diligence” — but Warner Bros. Discovery never submitted a formal bid for Paramount Global. “None of those discussions led to entry into any definitive agreement for a business combination,” the Paramount filing says.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSophia Bush is starring in and executive producing “Broad Trip,” a road trip comedy for The Roku Channel. Bush leads the film, which co-stars Lauren Holly and Steve Guttenberg, set to debut in May 2026.\n\n\tPer the official logline, “When buttoned-up daughter Alice (Bush) plans a “bachelorette” road trip with her wild and impulsive mother, Jeanie (Holly), to talk her out of marrying a guy she just met (Guttenberg), they rediscover their unbreakable bond, confronting old wounds and old flames, while learning the lesson that sometimes life doesn’t follow a plan — and maybe that’s okay.”\n\t\n\n\t“As a kid who grew up watching classic 90s comedies and yearns for more, the moment I read this script, I said yes,” Bush says. “Being able to play alongside Lauren and Steve made a hilarious story a dream come true. And doing something new with a streamer that’s both innovative and growing so quickly is thrilling to me as a producer, too. I can’t wait for audiences to take a BROAD TRIP with us!”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSteve Wilkie\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMorgan Pichinson of Roku Originals adds, “At Roku, our goal is to tell stories that reflect the humor, heart, and everyday moments our viewers connect with the most. Led by the amazing Sophia Bush and Lauren Holly, ‘Broad Trip’ captures that spirit perfectly with its hilarious and heartfelt take on family relationships.”\n\n\t“Broad Trip” will debut in May 2026. Chelsea Davison writes and executive produces with Yan-Kay Crystal directing. Joel S. Rice and Michael Barbuto produce for Muse Entertainment. Jonas Prupas, Aren Prupas and Meghan Mathes Jacobs also executive produce. Lisa Soper and Motion Content are consulting producers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNBCUniversal is almost cleared out of advertising inventory tied to coming telecasts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup on Telemundo — which remains more than half a year away from starting.\n\n\tTelemundo inventory tied to the tournament is 90%, the company revealed Tuesday. The Spanish-language network holds exclusive rights to telecast Spanish-language broadcasts of the event in the U.S. The company says it is seeing double the spend from advertisers when compared to the sales process behind the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Among the companies buying commercials are Anheuser-Busch, AT&T, Bank of America, The Coca Cola Company, Diageo, McDonald’s, Toyota, Volkswagen of America and Xfinity, a subsidiary of Comcast, NBCU’s corporate parent.\n\t\n\n\t“The growth of soccer in the United States coupled with the domestic nature of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and rising demand for both live sports and Spanish language content has proved to be the winning formula for our company, as NBCUniversal sits in its strongest position ever this far out from a FIFA World Cup tournament,” says Peter Lazarus, executive vice president of NBC Sports & Olympics, Advertising and Partnerships. “The upcoming competition in Spanish-language on Telemundo and Peacock will captivate a highly engaged and passionate audience that our partners are eager to connect with, and we are excited to deliver both brands and fans a world-class experience this summer.”\n\n\n\tTelemundo will broadcast all 104 matches live between June 11 and July 19, 2026. Of the games, 92 will air on Telemundo and 12 on Universo. Every match will also stream live on Peacock and the Telemundo app.\n\t\n\n\t“The unprecedented demand for the World Cup 2026 underscores the undeniable power of Latino fans as an economic engine shaping the future of sports and culture in America,” said Monica Gil, chief administrative and marketing officer of NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises, in a statement. “Advertisers recognize the opportunity this moment presents —  a once-in-a-lifetime tournament taking place across North America — to drive engagement, loyalty, and cultural relevance at scale. Telemundo is uniquely positioned to deliver on that opportunity, and the response from the marketplace reaffirms our ability to connect brands with fans through the power and excitement of live sports.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tIndian streaming giant JioHotstar has committed INR4,000 crore ($445 million) to South India’s creative economy over the next five years, the platform revealed at a star-studded event in Chennai attended by Tamil Nadu Deputy Chief Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin and South cinema luminaries including Kamal Haasan, Mohanlal and Nagarjuna.\n\n\tThe investment announcement accompanied the unveiling of 25 new titles spanning originals, franchises and films, headlined by premium series “Kaattaan” starring Vijay Sethupathi and “Pharma” featuring Nivin Pauly. The showcase also marked the signing of a letter of intent with the Government of Tamil Nadu to strengthen the state’s creative and production ecosystem.\n\t\n\n\tThe commitment represents one of the largest streaming investments focused on regional Indian content, with 1,500 hours of fresh South programming slated to roll out over the next 12 months. The platform currently boasts 400 million users and serves audiences across 100% of India’s post codes, according to executives speaking at the event.\n\n\n\t“The South has always been a creative powerhouse, and it is a privilege to serve a region that is defining the next era of Indian storytelling,” said Krishnan Kutty, head of entertainment (South) at JioStar. “In just the last ten months, over 500 creators, directors and showrunners have joined us each bringing a voice that deserves to be heard across India and beyond.”\n\n\tAddressing the cultural and economic impact of the partnership, Deputy Chief Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin emphasized the transformative potential for Tamil Nadu’s creative sector, noting the initiative will create 1,000 direct jobs and 15,000 indirect jobs. “The contribution of South India has created a new benchmark for Indian cinema,” he stated. “Today, everyone has a voice — a filmmaker in Madurai or Salem can upload a story and reach an audience across the world.”\n\t\n\n\tMember of Parliament and revered thespian Kamal Haasan, addressing the platform’s reach, observed that the streaming landscape has fundamentally altered content distribution. “Today, stories are truly screen-agnostic. They travel with the viewer,” he said. “Today, regional is becoming the new national, and ethnic the new international. Stories born in Madurai, Malappuram, Mandya or Machilipatnam are no longer ‘regional cinema’ — they are national cultural events.”\n\n\tThe announced slate includes returning franchises “Kerala Crime Files” Season 3, “Save The Tigers” Season 3, “Heartbeat” Season 3 and “Good Wife” season 2, alongside new originals including “Cousins And Kalyanams,” “Moodu Lantharlu,” “LBW – Love Beyond Wicket,” “Resort,” “Secret Stories: Roslin,” “Lingam” and “Vikram On Duty.”\n\n\tThe platform is also producing “Vishakha,” a regional adaptation of its acclaimed Hindi-language series “Aarya,” and new films including “Lucky The Superstar” and “Kenatha Kaanom.”\n\n\tIn unscripted programming, JioHotstar is expanding beyond its successful “Bigg Boss” – the Indian adaptation of “Big Brother” – franchise across the Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada languages with new formats including “Comedy Cooks,” “Mad for Each Other” and “Second Love.” Notably, “Roadies” will debut in Telugu, marking the first time the adventure format will be produced for South Indian audiences.\n\n\tAccording to platform metrics shared at the event, South entertainment has achieved 99.96% post code presence across India, with close to 45% of viewing occurring on connected TVs. Malayalam content particularly demonstrates cross-regional appeal, with over 80% of watch time driven by viewers outside Kerala.\n\n\tThe platform reported that “Heartbeat” generated over 100 million hours of watch time this year, while films “Lokah Chapter 1: Chandra” and “Mirai” became its most-watched movies. Southern consumers spend nearly 70% more time on JioHotstar compared to the rest of India, executives noted.\n\n\t“JioHotstar started as a dream,” said Sushant Sreeram, head of SVOD business and chief marketing officer at JioStar. “The resplendent story-telling heritage of South India and its sheer impact on India’s storytelling culture motivates us to keep championing rich, authentic and rooted narratives while delivering greater variety, accessibility and viewing experiences tailored to every viewer’s tastes and dreams.”\n\t\n\n\tThe new slate features established stars including Aishwarya Rajesh, Kajal Aggarwal, Meena, Priyamani, Nayanthara, Samantha, Nithya Menen, Nandamuri Balakrishna, Aju Varghese and Lal, alongside emerging talent such as Deepa Balu, Anumol, Charukesh, Kavin, Arjun Radhakrishnan, Guru Lakshman and Smeha Manimegalai. The platform’s broader content library also includes superstars Dhanush and Sivakarthikeyan among its talent roster.\n\n\tThe ecosystem spans production houses including Banijay Group, Vikatan, DQ Productions, Aashirvad Cinemas, ARKA Media and Naavi Productions, with directors including Jeethu Joseph and Ahammed Khabeer.\n\n\tAs part of its partnership with the Government of Tamil Nadu, JioHotstar will introduce creator-focused initiatives including writing labs, mentorship programs and skill-building workshops aimed at nurturing filmmakers, writers, editors and digital storytellers.\n\n\tJioHotstar was formed through the merger of JioCinema and Disney+ Hotstar, and currently maintains more than 300,000 hours of entertainment content across its library, serving audiences on 85 million connected TV devices nationwide.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe EU’s European Commission has launched an antitrust investigation into Google‘s use of online content to train its AI models and produce overviews. \n\n\tThe prove will determine whether Google has breached EU competition rules by using content from web publishers, including YouTube videos, for AI purposes; and will also examine whether Google is violating competition rules “by imposing unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators”, or “by granting itself privileged access to such content,” the European Commission said in its release. \n\t\n\n\tIn 2024., Europe passed a landmark AI Act which became the world’s first law aimed at regulating artificial intelligence technology. It has fueled existing tensions between tech giants and EU regulators who have been clashing over a number of issues, such as antitrust and transparency, as well as the EU’s security and privacy law, known as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). \n\n\n\t“A free and democratic society depends on diverse media, open access to information, and a vibrant creative landscape,” said Teresa Ribera, exec VP for clean, just and competitive transition. “These values are central to who we are as Europeans. AI is bringing remarkable innovation and many benefits for people and businesses across Europe, but this progress cannot come at the expense of the principles at the heart of our societies,” Ribera continued.\n\n\tThe European Commission suggests Google may be harvesting content from web publishers to provide AI summaries or overviews and may be uploading video and other content on YouTube to train generative models. In both cases, the EU says Google may be breaching antitrust regulations by failing to  compensate publishers and give them the possibility to decline the use of their content. Google makes it mandatory for content creators uploading videos on YouTube to grant them permission to use their data. \n\t\n\n\tLess than three months ago, Google was also fined nearly €3 billion for abusing its dominance in online advertising, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to react. “The European Union must stop this practice against American Companies,” Trump wrote on social media. The EU has already fined Google with €9.5 billion, while Apple was ordered to pay Ireland back taxes of €13 billion.  \n",

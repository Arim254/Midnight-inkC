    "body": "\n\t“Stranger Things” actress Jennifer Marshall, who played Max’s mother Susan Hargrove in Seasons 2 and 4 of the hit Netflix series, has posted via social media about not appearing in the show’s final season — and how the decision came as she was diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\tSeason 4 ended with Max (Sadie Sink) in a coma at the hospital, where that character also spent much of Season 5. But while Max’s boyfriend Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) kept a vigil by her side, Susan — despite being Max’s mother — was nowhere to be seen.\n\t\n\n\tIn her post, Marshall noted her disappointment that she wasn’t in Season 5, especially since it would have helped her with health insurance. \n\n\n\t“I had cancer, I get it,” Marshall wrote on social media. “But I was in remission during the shooting of Season 5. Shooting would have helped me obtain my health insurance through the union. Maybe they had too many characters, idk but obv Susan Hargrove is THE WORST MOTHER EVER LMAO. #strangerthings #strangerthings5 #cancer #cancersucks #butwhy.”\n\n\tMarshall told Variety that the post was not meant to be mean-spirited, but rather in jest, noting that with Susan missing, it’s clear the character is just not that great of a mom.\n\n\t“I just made the reel as a funny thing and it blew up,” Marshall wrote in an email to Variety. “I hold no ill will toward anyone and just wish things would have gone a different way. I was surprised to not be called back but cannot confirm why that decision was made. Regardless, I am grateful for the opportunity to be in the previous seasons.”\n\n\tEarlier, as the “Stranger Things” finale dropped on New Year’s Eve, Marshall wrote another post on Instagram: “Okay folks! It’s over…but where was she? What kind of mother isn’t there for her child while she’s in the hospital? Give me all your theories…”\n\t\n\n\tMarshall revealed her cancer diagnosis in a personal Facebook post in 2022. She noted at the time that she was being treated for cancer while filming Season 4 of “Stranger Things,” and that by the fourth episode, she required a wig due to her hair coming out.\n\n\t“I confided in certain people on set, including Sadie, who plays my daughter, Max. Her kindness and compassion overwhelmed me and I’m forever thankful for those moments we shared behind the scenes,” she wrote then. “She’s an incredible talent, but more importantly, a caring and kind human being. At the end of the shoot, I asked if I could speak to Matt and Ross [Duffer, the show creators] alone and explained to them what was going on. They looked alarmed and asked how I was. I confessed I had shot those episodes while undergoing treatment but that they were some of the brightest days I had had given all that was going on. I told them that eventually, I would be public about my diagnosis. That I wanted to influence others to get checked so that no one ever had to go through what I did. I asked them to please not write me out due to kindness or concern about my health because the days spent on set were such a bright light in an otherwise dark and depressing time. They expressed their concern, offered their well wishes and urged me to contact them if I needed anything. Such lovely people I’m thrilled to know and have worked under.”\n\n\tMarshall’s other credits include “The Terminal List: Dark Wolf,” “Sugar,” “For All Mankind,” “NCIS: Los Angeles” and “Reacher,” as well as host of The CW’s “Mysteries Decoded.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: Details follow for Season 14, Episode 1 of “The Masked Singer,” “Premiere,” which aired Jan. 7 on Fox.\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” returned on Wednesday with a big swing: Big Papi, aka Boston Red Sox legend David Ortiz, was the first to be eliminated as Season 14 of the hit Fox celebrity singing competition got underway.\n\n\tDisguised in the “Googly Eyes,” costume, Ortiz performed “Turn Down for What,” by DJ Snake and Lil Jon. Panelist Ken Jeong guessed it right with Ortiz. Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg went with Derek Jeter. Robin Thicke thought it was Pedro Martinez. Rita Ora named Manny Ramirez.\n\t\n\n\tAs for the identity of the second elimination — a duo under two Croissant costumes — Thicke said he believed it was Snooki and the Situation from “Jersey Shore,” while Jeong guessed Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. McCarthy-Wahlberg named Todd and Julie Chrisley. Ora went with Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag. The Croissant will be revealed at the start of next week’s episode.\n\n\n\tThe two-hour premiere — which repped the first episode since May 2025, as “The Masked Singer” took the fall off — opened with Ora singing “Golden,” from “KPop Demon Hunters” (which features the voice of her fellow panelist Jeong). Later, Jeong and Thicke also joined in the vocals.\n\n\tIn a series of head-to-head competitions, Galaxy Girl faced off with Handyman; Pugcasso with Queen Corgi, Scarab with Croissants, Snow Cone with Stingray and Googly Eyes with Cat Witch. Winning those faceoffs: Galaxy Girl, Pugcasso, Scarab, Stingray and Cat Witch.\n\n\tThat meant Handyman, Queen Corgi, Croissants, Snow Cone and Googly Eyes were the bottom five. After one more vote, the bottom two were poised for elimination: Googly Eyes and Croissant.\n\t\n\n\tDavid “Big Papi” Ortiz as Googly Eyes is the first celebrity unmasked on “The Masked Singer” Season 14.\n\n\tBack for Season 14 are host Nick Cannon, alongside panelists McCarthy Wahlberg, Jeong, Ora and Thicke.\n\n\tNew this season is “America’s Insider,” in which singer, dancer and social media personality Kylie Cantrall will share behind-the-scenes hints and clues for viewers. The twist: Cantrall is in costume, but will unmask for viewers — so the audience knows who she is, but the panelists don’t.\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” Season 14 themed episodes include a tribute to “Star Trek,” the ‘90s comedy “Clueless,” the comic franchise “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and the blockbuster “Twilight Saga” films. Also Fox’s new “Fear Factor” reboot will feature host Johnny Knoxville in a “Fear Factor: House of Fear Night,” and an “Ozzfest Night” honors late rocker Ozzy Osbourne, including a special tribute by “Masked Singer” alum Kelly Osbourne (Season 2’s Ladybug) saluting her father’s musical influence.\n\n\tThe 18 Masked contestants in Season 14 include Eggplant, Pugcasso, Queen Corgi, the Croissants, Owl, 14 Karat Carrot, Snow Cone, Galaxy Girl, High Voltage, Googly Eyes, Scarab, Handyman, Crane, Le Who Who, Pangolin, Stingray, Cat Witch and Calla Lily.\n\n\tPer the show, the Season 14 contestants have sold a combined 94 million records, received 47 Teen Choice Award nominations, 12 Emmy nominations, two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one Tony Award win and one Academy Award nomination.\n\n\tHere were the performances on Wednesday’s two-hour premiere episode.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGalaxy Girl, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGalaxy Girl\t\n\n\tSong: “Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl,” by Chappell Roan\n\n\tPanel guesses: Lindsay Lohan, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Emma Stone\n\n\tGalaxy Girl voiceover: “Star light, star bright. Heard you’re looking for stars tonight. Well, this girl’s the whole galaxy. From a young age I was on top of the world. Accepted in the best schools on scholarship. The youngest on stage, even before I could drive. But y’all, I’m human. And perfection was never my thing. So, I walked away. For years, I was lost in the background. But I knew there was something bigger in the world for me. So I worked my butt off. And boom, my rise was meteoric. Now I’m feeling another gravitational pull. Toward this stage. I’ll admit, I’ve been curious about doing ‘The Masked Singer’ for a while. And I’m ready for takeoff. But I don’t plan to take off this mask until I secure that trophy.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHandyman, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHandyman\t\n\n\tSong: “Shake Your Groove Thing,” by Peaches & Herb\n\n\tPanel guesses: Idris Elba, Tone Loc, Vin Diesel\n\n\tHandyman voiceover: “I’m your host, Handyman. And today I’m going to teach you how to flip your life upside down. I grew up on the west coast. And as a kid, I was scrappy. I was a tough guy. And I rode around with an interesting crew. It was fun. You want to see my wild guy face? I was never looking for trouble. So I used my image to shift gears. Suddenly, the crowd I was rolling with included everyone from DeNiro to Courtney Cox. Turns out, I could still be scrappy. But use that attitude for something good. My street cred has never been higher.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNick Cannon and Pugasso, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPugcasso\t\n\n\tSong: “Ordinary,” by Alex Warren\n\n\tPanel guesses: Dan Reynolds, Darren Criss, Ryan Tedder\n\n\tPugcasso voiceover: “Well hello there my furry friends. I’m Pugcasso. And welcome to the Joy of Panting. Today, we’re going to paint a happy little career change. See, I was supposed to take over the family business. But sometimes you’ve got to color outside the lines. Like the time I threw my name in the hat on something big. My life changed overnight. I joined an ensemble of dreamers just like me, and before you knew it I went from nobody to top dog. Something only a handful of artists have achieved. Just like that, we painted success. But as for me, I’m still that ordinary pup living in an extraordinary world.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQueen Corgi, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tQueen Corgi\t\n\n\tSong: “Don’t Rain on My Parade,” by Barbra Streisand\n\n\tPanel guesses: Nikki Blonsky, Maya Rudolph, Aidy Bryant\n\n\tQueen Corgi voiceover: “OK lemme tell you something. College was not for me. So I’m hanging out at my dorm, just being myself. You know, doing what I love. And people started paying attention. A few at first. And then, like an actual audience. And it hit me, hey, maybe I can make a living off this. But everyone thought I was crazy. Friends, family, professors, they all said no. But I didn’t wait for permission, I didn’t follow the rules. And now they literally call me a trailblazer. Like, what? So don’t even think about raining on my parade. Because I’m hoping to be best in show.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tScarab, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tScarab\t\n\n\tSong: “Set Fire to the Rain,” by Adele\n\n\tPanel guesses: Whoopi Goldberg, Viola Davis, Sheryl Lee Ralph\n\n\tScarab voiceover: “’This golden goddess, perhaps the most decorated we’ve ever seen, has risen as any star in the heavens.’ Yeah, everyone knows my story. I have done it all. Met presidents, dined with Brad. Even Prince knew my name. Just look at my trophy shelf. That’s a lot of gold, baby. I’m proud of what I’ve achieved. But I’ve been at this a long time now. While most people would be thinking about retirement, I’m looking for something new to inspire me. The Scarab is a symbol of rebirth. And this is the beginning of mine. Time to win a new kind of gold.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCroissants, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCroissants\t\n\n\tSong: “Jailhouse Rock,” by Elvis Presley\n\n\tPanel guesses: The Situation and Snooki, Todd and Julie Chrisley, Spencer and Heidi Pratt\n\n\tCroissants voiceover: “’They were upper crust socialites. Living at the top. And it all came crumbling down.’ So it’s true, life was good. And we were inseparable. Until we were torn apart. That’s right. We were canceled, separated. And we didn’t know when we’d see each other again. It was the darkest moments of our lives. And just when I thought all hope was lost, a miracle. Out of nowhere, we’re back. Back. And best of all, reunited. We feel everyone just had the wrong idea about us. So we’re here to change it. And rise again. Together.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNick Cannon and Snow Cone, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSnow Cone\t\n\n\tSong: “When I Grow Up,” by the Pussycat Dolls\n\n\tPanel guesses: Mischa Barton, Nicole Richie, Taylor Momsen\n\n\tSnow Cone voiceover: “Hello everyone. My name is Snow Cone. And I’m here to clear the air. I’ve been misunderstood. Look, from day one I knew I was destined for stardom. Sure, I was just modeling snow boots for a kids catalog. But I was the whole package. And then wham, I finally got my big break. I landed a role on one of TV’s hottest shows. Until one moment spoiled everything. I was kicked to the curb. You should have seen what the headlines said about me. All lies. Hollywood completely iced me out. And ever since then, I’ve been trying to shake that image. Tonight, the nerves are real. But this song feels personal to me. I’m not what you think. And I’m going to prove those people wrong.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNick Cannon and Stingray, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tStingray\t\n\n\tSong: “Stayin’ Alive,” by Bee Gees\n\n\tPanel guesses: Lenny Kravitz, Jaden Smith, Lil Romeo\n\n\tStingray voiceover: “You know what? This Stingray is everywhere. From Michelin to Met Gala. I say yes to it all. And in my early days I might have been known to mix it up on Sunset Boulevard. I mean, who else parties on the roof of the Chateau Marmont? It all started when I was a kid and my mom hosted these amazing parties with legends like Michael, Luther, Stevie. Some of my earliest memories are sneaking out of bed to sit at the top of the stairs, desperate to catch a glimpse of the gold and the glamour. To this day, I don’t like to miss out on a good time. That’s why I’m here. I’ve had so many friends do this show and love it, so I wanted to see if the hype is real. Does that sound like a party?”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGoogly Eyes, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSong: “Turn Down for What,” by DJ Snake and Lil Jon\n\n\tPanel guesses: David “Big Papi” Ortiz, Daddy Yankee, Wesley Snipes\n\n\tGoogly Eyes voiceover: “Heard you are hiring a new ‘Masked Singer’ winner. The name is Googly Eyes. Here’s my resume. Qualifications? I have tons. I am a massive star, a born leader who is known for getting businesses out of the red and into the black. And I am mostly housebroken. Need references? Bacon, Krasinski, Tucker, those guys have got my back. So I am perfect for the gig and will be clutch for making this season a smash. Reach out with any questions, and let’s get to work.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCat Witch, “The Masked Singer” (Trae Patton / Fox)\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCat Witch\t\n\n\tSong: “Abracadabra,” by Lady Gaga\n\n\tPanel guesses: Charli D’Amelio, Addison Rae, Lisa from Blackpink\n\n\tCat Witch voiceover: “The best things are worth the wait. And don’t I know that’s true. I’m not used to being anonymous. But I’m thrilled to toy with you. Ever since I was a kitten, I longed for the stage. So I brewed myself a future. A dash of time, a little sage, grandiose merch, tours, albums. All that and more came from my cauldrons. And I’m living for it. This little kitten’s got her claws in every single pot. Because to live nine lives, you’ve got to grow and stretch a lot. I’m ready to shed my image. A more mature side you should find. And what I’m manifesting next, that gold mask is mine.”\n\t\n\n\tPast “The Masked Singer” winners include T-Pain as Monster (Season 1), Wayne Brady as Fox (Season 2), Kandi Burruss as Night Angel (Season 3), LeAnn Rimes as Sun (Season 4), Nick Lachey as Piglet (Season 5), Jewel as Queen of Hearts (Season 6), Teyana Taylor as Firefly (Season 7), Amber Riley as Harp (Season 8), Bishop Briggs as Medusa (Season 9), Ne-Yo as Cow (Season 10), Vanessa Hudgens as Goldfish (Season 11), Boyz II Men as Buffalos (Season 12) and Gretchen Wilson as Pearl (Season 13).\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” comes from Fox Alternative Entertainment.

    "body": "\n\tAfter testing the interest of sports fans in short-form content, Disney aims to bring brief bursts to a broader audience.\n\n\tThe company aims to bring so-called “microcontent” to Disney+ in 2026, it announced Wednesday at CES, and in doing so joins a parade of traditional media purveyors working harder to court younger consumers who have grown more accustomed to swiping through Tik Toks, Reels and other attenuated attempts to entertain. \n\t\n\n\tDisney first put a stake in short-attention-span theater with “verts,” or  short video vignettes placed on its new ESPN streaming app that might include important game moments or pieces of commentary or analysis from various sports personalities. Fans are able to exert more control over a feed through whichi they can scroll or swipe, and the videos are tailored to the individual interests of users.\n\n\n\tDisney indicated it intends to expand the use of short-form video across both news and entertainment, betting that such features will make Disney+ a daily destination for users who want to get updates on their favorite content areas. There have already been some intriguing experiments. In 2025, ABC News launched a daily short-form show for Disney+ called “What You Need to Know” that is hosted each weekday by Rachel Scott or James Longman. \n\n\tOthers are courting similar engagement. Procter & Gamble, one of the nation’s largest advertisers, this month is launching “The Golden Pear Affair,” a 50-episode “microsoap” that will be made available initially via social media and, later, a bespoke mobile app. The idea, say backers of the new program, is to reach people who are used to giving content a swipe on a mobile phone, rather than those who sit back and passively swoon in front of a more traditional screen. Spanish-language giant TelevisaUnivision has been wooing advertisers to a growing series of sudsy “microdramas” that emulate many of the elements of the company’s popular telenovelas. The company recently worked with the Dentsu ad agency to create a bespoke Spanish-language microdrama for retailer JCPenney. \n\t\n\n\tDisney also made outreach to Madison Avenue Wednesday, unveiling a “brand portal” that will allow clients to measure the impact of ad campaigns on Disney properties using data from Affinity Solutions, CINT, EDO, Innovid and VideoAmp.  “We’re empowering advertisers to move smarter and faster to reach their goals, with data and measurement guiding their strategy,” said Dana McGraw, Disney’s senior vice president of data and measurement science, in a statement. The company also unveiled a new “impact metric” that it said would offer insight into goals such as consumer attention, reach, brand health, search and actions taken by consumers following exposure to commercials.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNow that Miley Cyrus has said she would love to do music for the second season of “Heated Rivalry,” one of the show’s stars, Connor Storrie, has a confession to make.\n\n\tStorrie, who plays Russian hockey player Ilya in the queer romance series, tells me he was only 13 when he dressed as Cyrus for Halloween.\n\n\tAs Hannah Montana?\n\n\n\tNope, it was Cyrus from her very controversial MTV VMAs performance with Robin Thicke in 2013. “Not to expose myself a little bit, but…it was a big cultural moment at the time,” Storrie told me Wednesday morning after he and “Abbott Elementary” star Janelle James announced this year’s SAG/Actor Awards nominations in Los Angeles. “Me and my best friend — I was Miley Cyrus for Halloween and he was Robin Thicke.”\n\t\n\n\t“I was in middle school,” he continued. “I think those photos don’t exist anymore. I want to plant the seed for people to try to find them, but I don’t think they will.” (Turns out they do. Fans were quick to find one after Variety posted a video of my interview on social media.)\n\n\tCyrus was blasted for her appearance at the VMAs for not only twerking on Thicke during their set, but she was also accused of cultural appropriation.\n\n\tUnlike Storrie’s YouTube videos from around that time that have become quite popular these days, Storrie doesn’t believe there’s any footage of him as Cyrus. As James said, “That’s probably a good thing.”\n\n\tLooking into the camera, Storrie said, “So, Miley Cyrus, know that I was you at the MTV Movie Awards.”\n\n\n\tIt’s been a meteoric rise for Storrie and his “Heated Rivalry” co-star Hudson Williams ever since HBO Max debuted the first two episodes of the show over Thanksgiving weekend. HBO Max acquired the series from Canadian streamer Crave.\n\t\n\n\tMemes and gifs of the show’s most explicit sex scenes and other moments from the episodes quickly went viral.\n\n\tIn mid-December, Storrie told me he decided to do his self-tape audition shirtless. “I was like, ‘If we’re doing a show that heavily involves sex,’” he said. “So I took off my shirt, even though it didn’t say that. I had my shirt off the entire time because I was like, ‘If we’re doing that, you all have to see what these people look like naked.’”\n\n\tStorrie has signed with mega talent agency CAA. He and Hudson will present at the Golden Globes on Sunday. Storrie will make his late-night talk show debut on “Late Night with Seth Meyers on Jan. 12.\n\n\tSadly, because “Heated Rivalry” is a fully Canadian-financed production, it’s ineligible for Emmys and Actor Awards.\n\n\t“Do I think it would be cool to get that recognition for the show?” Storrie asked. “Yeah, 100%. Do I think the show has a level of quality that I think will get recognized? 100%. But also, awards are a cherry on top of the cake, which is just being able to do what you want. We all make things to be seen, so when you get reinforcement that things are being watched, that’s kind of all you need, especially with something like this that had little promise going into it.”\n\n\tJames said she watched “Heated Rivalry” about three weeks ago when her assistant recommended it. “What I’m thinking about his excellent Russian accent that he does,” she said when I alluded to his risqué sex scenes. “I’m thinking about his characterization. I’m thinking that he is adorable, and he looks like a leading man, and I’m excited to see where he goes next.\n\n\tAdditional reporting by Kennedy French.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tHBO‘s “The Pitt” has been renewed for a third season. HBO CEO Casey Bloys made the announcement Wednesday, Jan. 7, during “The Pitt” Season 2 premiere at the DGA Theater in Los Angeles.\n\n\tThe news comes one day before the premiere of the Emmy-winning second season of the Noah Wyle medical drama from John Wells. The series, created by R. Scott Gemmill, premiered in 2025 and tells the story of healthcare workers inside a Pittsburgh emergency room over the course of 15 episodes. Each season has taken course over one shift, with each episode covering an hour of the shift.\n\t\n\n\tThe first season earned 13 Emmy nominations and won five — best drama; drama casting; and acting trophies for Wyle, Katherine LaNasa and Shawn Hatosy. On Wednesday, the show was nominated for two Actor Awards and two DGA Awards.\n\n\n\t“It’s hard to make any good show, regardless of whether it’s comedy, drama or documentary. But what John and Noah and Scott wanted to do going in was to do a high-quality show, but also one that was set up in a way that you could do 15 episodes. So, the concept of the show being on essentially one set made the budget manageable,” Bloys told Variety after the Emmy wins. “And you have a group of people who understand how to make 15 episodes, but also how to bring it back on an annual basis. That is the one thing I think that we’ve gotten away from in television, that ability to bring shows back on an annual basis.”\n\n\tWyle leads the cast alongside LaNasa, Hatosy, Patrick Ball, Supriya Ganesh, Fiona Dourif, Taylor Dearden, Isa Briones, Gerran Howell and Shabana Azeez. Sepideh Moafi joined the cast in Season 2 as Dr. Al-Hashimi.\n\t\n\n\tWells, Gemmill and Wyle serve as executive producers along with Erin Jontow, Joe Sachs, Simran Baidwan and Michael Hissrich.\n",

    "body": "\n\tClassic anime outside of Hayao Miyazaki’s work has never really made serious inroads with the Academy voters during Oscar season, but Crunchyroll is looking to change that with “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle.” The feature shattered box office records, becoming the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time, earning $682 million worldwide. It also landed a Golden Globe nomination for motion picture — animated. \n\n\t“Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” follows Tanjiro Kamado and the Demon Slayer Corps in a battle against Muzan Kibutsuji and the Upper Moons inside his hideout, known as the Infinity Castle.\n\t\n\n\tThe animated feature, produced by Ufotable, blends both 2D and CG styles. \n\n\tDirector Haruo Sotozaki explains that the characters were animated by hand, and one of the main challenges was “marrying the 2D frames within the CG background and environments.” Speaking via a translator, he adds, “It was one of the hardest marriages we’ve had to take on.”\n\n\tMatching the 2D animation to 3D back grounds required an additional step in the production pipeline.“We would send the key frames to the 3D team,” Sotozaki says. “They would try to match those key frame animations to the surrounding 3D environments.”\n\n\tOnce the match was achieved, the frames were sent back to the animators to polish each one.\n\n\tAs far as the story is concerned, Ufotable president and chief director Hikaru Kondo reveals that the film was originally over three hours long after storyboarding. However, even at that length, there was no clear “overall groove of what the journey was.”\n\t\n\n\tFor the animators and the studio, it was crucial to ensure emotional investment for the audience, given how beloved the franchise, story and characters are.\n\n\tThe key was not to rush the process — the film took over three and a half years to make. “We’ve been building up to this moment from the ‘Unwavering Resolve’ arc, laying it down for the fandom and theaudience to really buy into what is happening in the ‘Infinity Castle,’” Kondo says.\n\n\tIt was a massive undertaking, but the team had a blueprint.\n\n\tThey had faced a similar challenge when creating “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba — The Movie: Mugen Train.” “There were a lot of questions about how you can take all of this information and put it into a single film. I think that learning has been applied to ‘Infinity Castle,’” Kondo says.\n\n\tCinematographer Yuichi Terao played a key role in balancing the visual spectacle of action sequences and battles with an engaging story.\n\n\tOnce the emotional backbone was established, it was also about creating an “epic space.” Everything had to take place within the Infinity Castle itself. The Infinity Castle first appeared in the “Unwavering Resolve” arc of the TV series, but now the studio had to create something even bigger.\n\n\tAmid the action and drama, there’s also destruction, which Terao says gives fans something new to experience. “We were getting all of the destructive effects and the physics to work this hybrid effect that we’ve designed. As a member of the audience, it’s a fun experience, but we all collectively as the studio had to work together to put it onto the screen,” he says.\n\n\tCrunchyroll remains hopeful that “Demon Slayer” will connect with Oscar voters and bring greater anime representation to the Academy Awards. Mitchel Berger, Crunchyroll exec VP of global commerce. has been on the FYC trail. He notes that being part of the awards conversation is a way to elevate the art form. “It’s a beautiful piece of artwork,” he says of ‘Demon Slayer.” “The craftsmanship, the care, and the love that goes into this — just being able to expose people to that is a wonderful thing.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatt Damon appeared on the latest episode of the “New Heights” podcast and revealed that he cut his weight down so much for Christopher Nolan‘s “The Odyssey” that at one point during filming he weighed as much as he did in high school. Damon reunites with Nolan after “Interstellar” and “Oppenheimer” to lead the epic adventure film as Odysseus.\n\n\t“I had a beard like yours for like a year,” Damon told podcast co-host Jason Kelce (via Entertainment Weekly). “I was in really good shape. I lost a lot of weight. [Nolan] wanted me lean but strong. Just because of this other thing that I did with my doctor, I stopped eating gluten. I used to walk around at between 185 and 200, and I did that whole movie at 167. And I haven’t been that light since high school. So it was a lot of training and a really strict diet.”\n\t\n\n\tIt’s a far cry from when Damon has had to pack on the pounds for his characters. The Oscar nominee gained 30 pounds for 2009’s “The Informant” by “eating like crazy and drinking dark beer,” he told EW at the time. “Between meals on set, I’d eat a No. 1 Value Meal at McDonald’s and then Doritos on top of it. It was absolute heaven.”\n\n\n\tExpanding on “The Odyssey,” Damon marveled over how Nolan achieved the feat of making the first Hollywood feature film to be entirely shot with Imax cameras.\n\n\t“Imax cameras are really loud. It sounds like a blender, like a Cuisinart in your face when the camera’s close to you. So there’s never been these dialogue [scenes in Imax],” Damon said. “We couldn’t have this conversation with a normal Imax camera because you wouldn’t be able to hear us. They built this giant thing around the Imax for those dialogue scenes and a system of mirrors so your eye line would be close to the camera and you could talk to the other actor. The amount of work that went into figuring out how to do [that], because he wanted to do 100 percent Imax and he did it!”\n\t\n\n\t“The Odyssey” cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema previously revealed to Empire magazine that he shot Imax test footage of a kid reading David Bowie’s “Sound And Vision” lyrics to prove whether or not Imax film cameras were advanced enough to record dialogue. A new Imax film casing called a “blimp” was created to significantly reduce the noise Imax cameras produce.\n\n\t“The blimp system is a game-changer,” Nolan told Empire. “You can be shooting a foot from [an actor’s] face while they’re whispering and get usable sound. What that opens up are intimate moments of performance on the world’s most beautiful format.”\n\n\tDamon shot “The Odyssey” around the world in locations such as Greece, Iceland and Morocco and said he was stunned by the scope of Nolan’s on-location ambitions. \n\n\t“We would get there and I’d just start laughing,” Damon said. “I’d be like, ‘Nobody has any business shooting here! Of course he wants to shoot here. That tracks.’ He has such a great crew. His crew is so badass. And everybody just maxed out on that movie, and we made all of our days. We actually finished ahead of schedule. It was an awesome experience.”\n\n\t“The Odyssey” opens in theaters July 17.

    "body": "\n\tLawyers for Live Nation and Ticketmaster are calling for the dismissal of a lawsuit brought against them last September by the Federal Trade Commission and seven states in a motion filed Jan. 6.\n\n\tThe companies claim that the suit is an “egregious instance of agency overreach” and that much of the FTC’s case against them, which cites the Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act of 2016, is a misapplication of that law.\n\n\n\tThe lawsuit claims the companies enabled scalpers to purchase beyond their advertised ticket purchasing limits, allowing for the resale of tickets at steep markups far above face value. \n\t\n\n\t“This statute is designed to help ticket issuers like Ticketmaster combat ticket harvesting and scalping, ensuring that tickets are accessible to genuine fans,” their lawyers wrote. “Plaintiffs now ask this Court to take the unprecedented step of applying this law against a ticket issuer for its operation of a resale platform.”\n\n\tThe companies later admit that despite “Ticketmaster’s efforts, scalpers persist in using technology to step in front of fans to obtain an outsized share of tickets and resell them at marked up prices in a multibillion-dollar resale market. For instance, brokers create hundreds or thousands of Ticketmaster accounts to buy more tickets without exceeding the per-account ticket limit. Scalpers also use software that allows them to log into multiple accounts at the same time to bypass screening and verification measures,” they wrote. The motion asserts that Ticketmaster is the intermediary of person-to-person resales, not a reseller itself.\n\t\n\n\tLive Nation is already facing another federal case, with arguably bigger stakes, after being sued by the Biden administration’s Department of Justice for having a supposed monopoly on the live events business. “We allege that Live Nation relies on unlawful, anticompetitive conduct to exercise its monopolistic control over the live events industry in the United States at the cost of fans, artists, smaller promoters, and venue operators,” then-Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement announcing that suit.\n\n\tAs Variety previously reported, Live Nation’s stock price increased dramatically in the wake of Trump’s re-election in Nov. 2024. “We believe at least some parts of the case reflect a much more interventionist philosophy than you’d expect from a Republican administration,” said Live Nation CFO Joe Berchtold at the time. Live Nation’s stock price was $144 at market close Wednesday.\n\n\tNotably, in May of last year Live Nation voted to add Trump appointee and veteran Republican Richard Grenell, who currently oversees the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, to its board. Trump’s recent rebranding of the Center has resulted in several canceled performances.\n\n\tGrenell’s joining of Live Nation’s board followed Trump’s Executive Order in March that directed the FTC to “rigorously enforce” the BOTS Act in collaboration with State Attorneys General.\n\n\tA hearing on yesterday’s Live Nation/Ticketmaster recent motion is scheduled for Feb. 19.\n",

    "body": "\n\tInspiration can come from the most unlikely of places. For husband and wife filmmakers Shane Brady and Emily Zercher, it happened while they were on hold with the FBI.\n\n\tWhile buying a house during the pandemic, the pair was scammed into sending a down payment to a hacker. Once notified, they immediately took action — although as Zercher tells it, they wanted to go much further.\n\n\t“We were on hold with the FBI fraud department, which is something that they tell you to do,” she says. “They have hold music that will drive you insane. Shane’s on hold with the bank, and we had the actual hacker’s address and full name on the receipt of our wire. So I knew who it was. I knew their address. Because I was on hold for way too long with this terrible music, I announced that I have the hacker’s address: I will just go there myself, and I will hack him up with a machete. I realized in hindsight it may not be the smartest thing, but it created the seed of vengeance that was planted.”\n\t\n\n\tThe duo put their creativity to work, and the result is “Hacked: A Double Entendre of Rage Fueled Karma,” which recently wrapped a festival run that included screenings at FilmQuest, Celluloid Screams and Soho Horror Fest. The film, which follows the plight of the fictional Rumble family in a based-on-reality setup, is kinetic, cathartic and filled with snappy in-jokes and an infectious “let’s put on a show” energy that sprung from the project’s development.\n\n\n\t“We found out how many other people had been victims where their money had been stolen,” Brady says. “I’m sure you get those texts daily that say, ‘If you don’t pay this toll right now, we got you.'”\n\t\n\n\t“We also learned that when people hack into other people’s stuff, they will never be prosecuted for it because it’s a fingerprintless crime,” Zercher adds. “So not only does it happen all the time and everyone is upset about it, everybody’s hands truly are tied.”\n\n\tIn addition to a script filled with flights of fancy and dreams of delivering ultraviolet justice, the filmmaking evokes the loss of control the couple faced after the incident. Brady, who edited the film, says he carefully considered the feature’s flow.\n\n\t“The rough cut that I showed a lot of my friends was an hour and 55 minutes,” he says. “Across the board, they all had a version of the note: ‘This feels like a 90-minute movie.’ So I literally set a timeline marker to 90 and started hacking away. I felt like the movie started getting richer and becoming more … I don’t take offense when there’s a Letterboxd review calling it ‘The TikTok movie.’ It’s fast-paced, it’s insane, but I take it as a compliment for two reasons. Number one is that the goal audience is the younger generation and those dealing with technology. Furthermore, by leaning into this frenetic-paced world, that’s what Emily and I were dealing with. We felt crazy. We felt insane. And everywhere we looked for help or closure, it was a joke. Then you make a movie that’s a joke.”\n\n\t“Hacked” has recently been acquired for distribution by S&R Films, and the pair is excited for larger audiences to get the same jolt as at festival screenings. Ultimately, Brady says that the film has helped him to process and move past the robbery.\n\n\t“I’ve been working diligently in my life to embrace suffering as a gift,” he says. “‘Right now, this is very bad, and what is happening is very bad, but maybe there’s a reason for it.’ Not to say that our future is preordained or our destiny is written in the stars, but perhaps the suffering that we went through is meant to allow us to bond with other people who have gone through similar things. Perhaps by us killing ourselves with work to make this movie a reality, it will help somebody else who got their money stolen, and they’re never going to get it back. It’ll help somebody through a really crappy day, and they want to put on a movie where they get to have that release and have fun and not take themselves so seriously.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “Hacked” below.\n\n\n\n",

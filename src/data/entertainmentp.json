    "body": "\n\tIndependent music publisher Kobalt has formed a worldwide partnership with Madverse Music Group, an India-based company serving the South Asian independent music sector with distribution, publishing and marketing services.\n\n\tUnder the agreement, Madverse’s community of independent songwriters, composers and producers will gain access to Kobalt’s publishing administration network. Services include royalty collection in more than 180 markets, improved metadata tracking and expanded synchronization licensing opportunities. Madverse currently works with a client base exceeding 150,000 artists and labels throughout India and South Asia.\n\t\n\n\tThe partnership targets a gap in international royalty collection that has historically prevented South Asian creators from capturing overseas earnings. \n\n\n\tMadverse CEO Rohan Nesho Jain said: “This partnership with Kobalt represents a pivotal moment in our mission to empower India’s independent music community. For too long, Indian creators have left money on the table simply because the infrastructure to collect global royalties was broken and almost nonexistent. \n\n\t“Publishing royalties are essentially a musician’s pension fund – they generate income long after the initial release, sometimes for generations. Through this collaboration, we’re ensuring that Indian independent artists can finally access and protect these earnings seamlessly, no matter where in the world their music is played,” Jain added. “This is about more than just collecting royalties; it’s about building sustainable careers and giving our artists the financial foundation they deserve. When independent voices are properly compensated and protected, the entire music ecosystem becomes richer and more diverse.”\n\t\n\n\tThe deal supports Madverse’s “Independent, Not Alone” philosophy, which emphasizes creator ownership and control. The partnership will offer improved transparency and operational efficiency while allowing artists to retain their rights.\n\n\tSimon Moor, Kobalt’s managing director for the Asia-Pacific region, said: “Madverse has built an impressive ecosystem that supports one of the most dynamic independent music communities in the world. By combining their creator-first approach with Kobalt’s global publishing infrastructure, we’re committed to ensuring Madverse songwriters and producers have the resources, accuracy, and reach they need to succeed on an international scale.”\n\n\tKobalt administers publishing for more than 1 million compositions through 10 international offices. The company’s songwriter and publisher clients include Roddy Ricch, Max Martin, Karol G, Phoebe Bridgers and Paul McCartney. Kobalt’s catalog accounts for roughly 35% of top 100 songs and albums in the U.S. and U.K.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSony Pictures Networks India has restructured its leadership team to support its evolution into a content-driven, multi-lingual entertainment company that treats all distribution platforms equally.\n\n\tThe Mumbai-based broadcaster unveiled the changes Friday, explaining that the reorganization will give individual teams complete control over their content portfolios while breaking down operational barriers between its television networks and SonyLIV streaming platform. The goal is to create a more cohesive business approach that treats linear and digital distribution as equally important revenue channels.\n\t\n\n\tThe new structure places four executives in charge of distinct content portfolios, with each responsible for all aspects of their channels’ operations including creative development, scheduling, audience engagement initiatives, and promotional activities across both broadcast and streaming. Nachiket Pantvaidya now runs Sony Entertainment Television, Sony Marathi, and the company’s film production unit. Ajay Bhalwankar oversees Sony SAB, the film channels portfolio, free-to-air offerings, and factual programming. Rajaraman Sundaram has been tasked with building the broadcaster’s presence in southern India, while Ambesh Tiwari manages Sony AATH and children’s programming.\n\n\n\tSPNI will recruit an external candidate to run its streaming operations, though the company has not yet finalized its choice. Until that appointment is made, Banerjee will personally manage the digital division. Danish Khan, business head of SonyLIV and production unit Studio NXT, is exiting SPNI next month.\n\t\n\n\tOn the commercial side, the broadcaster is bringing together its various income sources – including advertising, carriage fees, sports rights, and overseas licensing – under a single executive. Rajesh Kaul will serve as chief revenue officer, managing a team that includes four newly promoted lieutenants. Akshay Agrawal now runs television advertising sales, while Makarand Palekar handles distribution agreements with cable and satellite operators. Ranjana Mangla, who previously focused solely on streaming advertising, will now also develop the company’s YouTube channel strategy. Manish Aggarwal oversees business-to-business deals and content licensing for SonyLIV. All four report directly to Kaul.\n\n\tIn corporate functions, Gaurav Laghate takes responsibility for external communications, brand management, and public relations. Meanwhile, office management and facility operations have been moved under the purview of chief human resources officer Manu Wadhwa.\n\n\tGaurav Banerjee, MD & CEO of Sony Pictures Networks India, stated: “As we look ahead to our next phase of growth, we have reviewed our operating model and organizational structure to ensure they best support our goals. We are redefining our content strategy from a largely linear-first to a linear and digital approach that delivers seamless consumer experience across platforms. By empowering our teams with greater ownership and driving deeper collaboration, we will improve focus, agility, and execution across the organization, while strengthening our customer-centric approach across brand and content.”\n\n\tSony Pictures Networks India operates a portfolio of 28 television channels available in standard and high definition, attracting more than 700 million viewers locally while distributing content to over 150 countries. The company functions as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation, Japan.\n",

The structural pivot transforms the competition into a collective challenge where entire kitchens compete for pride and reputation, rather than individual culinary prowess.\n\t\n\n\tChef applications for Season 3 are via Netflix Korea’s social channels. Eligibility is restricted to four-person teams currently employed at the same restaurant. Individual submissions and cross-restaurant lineups will not be accepted, though restaurants operating under the same brand across multiple locations may enter as a unified team.\n\n\n\t“Culinary Class Wars” has maintained a presence in Netflix’s Global Top 10 Non-English TV rankings for two consecutive years. Season 2 drew particular notice for its intensified competitive dynamics, inventive rule structures and escalating stakes while retaining the franchise’s core appeal.\n\n\tStudio Slam returns to produce Season 3, reuniting the original creative team including producer Kim Eun-ji and writer Mo Eun-seol, who have been instrumental in shaping the series’ trajectory.\n\n\t“Thanks to the incredible support from viewers around the world through Season 2, we’re grateful to move forward with Season 3,” Kim said. “We’ll do our best to deliver an even more exciting format and entertainment that lives up to expectations.”\n\t\n\n\tThe first season was widely credited with revitalizing Seoul’s dining scene, which saw increased restaurant bookings and renewed interest in the city’s culinary talent.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tPamela Anderson told Andy Cohen during an SiriusXM radio interview (via TMZ) that it was “yucky” being in such close proximity to Seth Rogen at the Golden Globes earlier this month. Rogen won two prizes at the ceremony for his Apple TV comedy “The Studio,” including best actor in a comedy series and best comedy series. Anderson has continued beef with Rogen after he executive produced and starred in Hulu’s “Pam & Tommy,” a 2022 limited series about Anderson’s tumultuous romance with Tommy Lee and how their unauthorized sex tape went public.\n\t\n\n\t“Seth Rogen… he did ‘Pam & Tommy’ without talking to me,” Anderson told Cohen. “I just felt like ugh. How can someone make a TV series out of difficult times in your life? And I am living, breathing human being over here.\n\n\n\t“He was in the pit at the Golden Globes. We were close. I felt like I’m not chopped liver over here. I felt weird about it,” Anderson continued about Rogen. “I’ve been so busy working. I’ve done 5 movies in the last year. Sometimes it hits you and you feel kind of down. It felt a little yucky. Eventually, hopefully, he will reach out to me to apologize, not that it matters. When you are a public person, they say you have no right to privacy. But your darkest, deepest secrets or tragedies should not be fair game for a TV series. That pissed me off a little bit.”\n\n\tAnderson concluded by saying that while she did not “make a beeline” for Rogen to address him directly, she did thinking about doing so “in my mind” where “I really told him what I thought.”\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety in 2023, Anderson said “assholes” were behind “Pam & Tommy” and added: “Salt on the wound. … You still owe me a public apology.” The show starred Lily James as Anderson, Sebastian Stan as Tommy Lee and Rogen as Rand Gauthier, the man responsible for steeling the couple’s sex tape. The series earned 10 Emmy nominations, including outstanding limited series, while Rogen, James and Rogen were all nominated for their performances.\n",

    "description": "\n\tKathleen Kennedy will end her 14-year run at Lucasfilm. She will be replaced by not one, but two executives when she leaves the Walt Disney Company ",
    "body": "\n\tKathleen Kennedy will end her 14-year run at Lucasfilm. She will be replaced by not one, but two executives when she leaves the Walt Disney Company this year. Chief Creative Officer Dave Filoni and President and General Manager Lynwen Brennan will both lead the company behind “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones” as it looks to recapture its stride. Filoni’s elevation had been widely expected, but Brennan’s promotion is something of a surprise. It suggests that Disney felt the need to pair a strong filmmaking force with someone with a firm sense of budgets and balance sheets. \n\t\n\n\tFiloni has been named president and chief creative officer, Lucasfilm, and Brennan has been named co-president. Their task will be to find ways to keep “Star Wars” fresh and relevant, as well as to deal with a fanbase that can be very vocal when it feels that a film or series is departing too drastically from the canon. Filoni and Brennan will report to Alan Bergman, co-chairman of Disney Entertainment.\n\n\n\tKennedy will continue to have a relationship with the company and will serve as producer of the studio’s next two theatrical films, “The Mandalorian and Grogu,” and “Star Wars: Starfighter,” which will hit theaters in 2026 and 2027. She will pursue other producing projects independently. \n\n\tIn a statement, Disney CEO Bob Iger, who is also expected to leave his role this year, praised Kennedy’s leadership.  “When we acquired Lucasfilm more than a decade ago, we knew we were bringing into the Disney family not only one of the most beloved and enduring storytelling universes ever created, but also a team of extraordinary talent led by a visionary filmmaker – someone who had been handpicked by George Lucas himself, no less,” Iger said. “We’re deeply grateful for Kathleen Kennedy’s leadership, her vision, and her stewardship of such an iconic studio and brand.”\n\t\n\n\tKennedy is a widely respected producer who worked closely with Steven Spielberg for many years, but her tenure at Lucasfilm has had both highs and lows. She helped select J.J. Abrams to direct 2015’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” which went on to earn more than $2 billion, successfully bringing the franchise back to the big screens. Its two sequels also were box office hits, as was “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” a spinoff adventure. \n\n\tHowever, 2018’s “Solo,” an attempt to look at the early years of Han Solo, failed at the box office and suffered from a chaotic production during which original directors, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, were fired and replaced with Ron Howard. Keeping filmmakers employed has been a consistent struggle for Kennedy, who has seen the likes of Patty Jenkins, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, and Taika Waititi announce “Star Wars” movies of their own that never materialized or were cancelled because of creative differences. That’s left Disney with a seven-year gap in “Star Wars” films, one that will be filled when “The Mandalorian and Grogu” opens in theaters this summer. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” a 2023 sequel to the long-running action action franchise, also failed at the box office.\n\n\tKennedy has helped “Star Wars” enter the world of streaming, producing hit shows such as “The Mandalorian” and critically acclaimed series such as “Andor.” A few of these faltered, however. “The Acolyte,” for instance, was canceled after one season.\n\n\tFiloni is a longtime veteran of Lucasfilm. He was selected by George Lucas in 2005 to build Lucasfilm’s animation studio and created its first series, “Star Wars: The Clone Wars,” and “Star Wars Rebels.” Filoni is the executive producer, episodic director and writer on some of the company’s live-action series, including “The Mandalorian” and “Ahsoka” and producer and writer of “The Mandalorian and Grogu.”\n\n\tBrennan joined Industrial Light & Magic in 1999, eventually becoming its president in 2009. She later became Lucasfilm’s president and general manager in 2024. She led the company’s business strategy and franchise and production operations and has overseen ILM’s expansion.\n\n\tPuck first reported Filoni and Brennan’s promotions. \n",

We look forward to working with TBS to broaden our relationships in Japan and to help expand the global reach of its rich IP to the rest of the world in a manner that respects and honors the talented creators,” said Grode.\n\n\n\tIncluded in the TBS portfolio is production shop The Seven (which has both Japanese and domestic offices), behind series including Netflix’s “Alice in Borderland” and “Yu Yu Hakusho.” Legendary’s slate is steeped in Japanese IP across both theatrical films and shows, including “Godzilla x Kong: Supernova,” “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters,” “Street Fighter,” which recently wrapped production and the previously produced “Pokémon: Detective Pikachu.” \n\t\n\n\tYayoi Nakatani, board director and chief growth officer of TBS Holdings, said he was “thrilled to partner with Legendary, a world-class studio with a remarkable track record of history-making global hits. Legendary’s exceptional creativity and their proven ability to build and expand IPs into worldwide franchises will be an indispensable driving force to our global strategy.”\n",

He will continue to be repped by Bond Artists and by B-Side in the UK. \n\n\tAlthough Cumming has enjoyed a highly-successful career that spans over four decades, he has found remarkable success in the past few years as the host of the US version of the hit reality competition show “The Traitors.”  The show has already been renewed through Season 5 at Peacock, while an all-civilian season hosted by Cumming is set to air on NBC. \n\t\n\n\tCumming has twice won the Emmy Award for outstanding host for a reality or reality competition program, while the show has won two Emmys for outstanding reality competition program to date out of eight total Emmy wins. \n\n\n\tAs an actor, Cumming is known for starring in films like “Spy Kids,” “X2: X-Men United,” “Goldeneye,” “Romy and Michelle’s High School Reunion,” and “Glenrothan.” In television, he is known for roles in shows like “The High Life,” “The Good Wife,” “Sex and the City,” “Broad City,” “Doctor Who,” and “Schmigadoon.” \n\n\tOn the stage, Cumming has performed roles in “Hamlet,” “Cabaret,” and “Macbeth” as well as hosted the Tony Awards.

    "body": "\n\tTaye Diggs is entering the vertical drama space, a growing industry around content made to be watched on smartphones. CandyJar, which bills itself as the first microdrama streaming platform out of the U.S., has set Diggs as the star and executive producer of a series titled “Off Limits & All Mine.” \n\n\tDiggs may be the first A-lister to appear in a project like this. Part of the success of vertical dramas — which have already generated billions of dollars of revenue in other countries, particularly in Asia — has to do with low production costs. As such, the burgeoning American microdrama industry has thus far been populated with working actors who make around $500 a day. But CandyJar hopes that involvement from someone like Diggs — beloved for roles in “The Best Man,” “How Stella Got Her Groove Back,” “Rent” and more — will add sheen to the format as a whole.\n\t\n\n\t“Off Limits & All Mine” (working title) is a romance starring Diggs as “a widower who takes in his best friend’s rebellious daughter and realizes that a dangerous and transformative connection is about to unfold,” per the official logline. The series will feature a Black ensemble; CandyJar says in a press release that it aims to “prove that Black-led romantic dramas belong at the center of the microdrama boom, not at its margins.” As such, CandyJar parent Inkitt is producing the series in partnership with Atlanta-based Freeli Films, which has made films for BET, Starz, Peacock and Amazon Prime Video.\n\n\n\tProduction on “Off Limits & All Mine” begins in Atlanta in February. Diggs’ frequent collaborator J. Carter serves as lead producer, with Troy Brookins executive producing and Alexandria Collins directing. \n\t\n\n\tFounded in 2013, Inkitt is a digital platform that uses AI to identify user-submitted stories that have potential for franchising. Selected stories are then moved to Galatea, the company’s pay-to-read app, or adapted into microdramas on CandyJar. Inkitt says that it has become “a hit-making engine now delivering a million-dollar success every seven days” and that CandyJar averages 70 million episodes streamed per month, more than 5.5 million users and an audience that spends an average of 40 minutes per day watching.\n\n\t“Microdramas are no longer experimental,” Inkitt’s director of production Lily Darragh Harty said in a statement. “Projects like this show that the format can support serious creative ambition, high production standards and top-tier talent, which is exactly the future CandyJar is building toward.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNBC has picked up its third drama pilot of the week, greenlighting an untitled crime investigation drama from writers/executive producers Dean Georgaris (“Quantum Leap”) and John Fox (“The Equalizer”).\n\n\tUniversal Studio Group’s Universal TV is the studio on the show, which also comes from exec producer John Davis, via his Davis Entertainment shingle. Per the logline, the show revolves around professor Georgia Ryan, described as “a trailblazing psychologist who challenges the field of criminology by shifting the investigative focus to the victim rather than just the perpetrator in order to uncover the crucial clues that more traditional methods leave behind. Alongside her team, this pioneering expert consults with the FBI to solve the most baffling and elusive cases.”\n\t\n\n\tThe character of Ryan is inspired by the real-life work of expert profiler and author Dr. Ann Burgess. A forensic nurse, Burgess pioneered the assessment and treatment of trauma in rape victims; later, she collaborated with the FBI’s Behavioral Science Unit thanks to her work with victims of sexual abuse. \n\n\n\tBurgess is on board the NBC pilot as a consulting producer, as is Steven Constantine. Burgess and Constantine co-wrote the book “A Killer by Design: Murderers, Mindhunters, and My Quest to Decipher the Criminal Mind,” which chronicled Burgess’ work assisting the FBI in profiling serial killers. The duo also wrote last year’s “Expert Witness: The Weight of Our Testimony When Justice Hangs in the Balance.”\n\n\tBurgess has consulted on cases involving Bill Cosby, the Menendez Brothers and other high profile names. For her work, she has received honors including being named a Living Legend by the American Academy of Nursing.\n\t\n\n\tBesides the “Quantum Leap” revival, Georgaris’ credits include “The Meg” and “The Meg 2,” as well as “The Baker and the Beauty” and “Bluff City Law.” Fox’s credits include “The Blacklist” and the updated “Magnum P.I.”\n\n\tWith this week of pilot orders, NBC is aiming to bring back some semblance of a pilot season like the old days. Earlier this week, NBC gave a pilot order to “Protection,” written by Josh Safran, about a family of law enforcement agents who become the target of a mysterious assassin. Safran exec produces that one with Jenna Bush Hager and Ben Spector. NBC also picked up the pilot to a reboot of “The Rockford Files,” from writer and executive producer Mike Daniels and exec producers Carl Beverly and Sarah Timberman. Those two pilots also come from Universal TV.\n",

I just kept hitting and my teammates kept giving me the ball and the greenlight to go.\"\n      \n    \n          Stubbs started cooking early and never let up.

Stubbs' previous career high was 56 points -- one shy of the 6A state record of 57. The previous overall state record was 75.\n      \n    \n          Now Stubbs stands alone, becoming the 21st high school boy nationally to ever reach the century mark.\n      \n    \n          \"Once he pressed down on the gas, he just kept going and it was really fun to watch,\" Maryvale coach Jeremy Smith said.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          Stubbs had three fouls in the first quarter, nearly costing him his big night … but he kept putting the ball through the hoop even when he was being triple-teamed.\n      \n    \n          He's not a guy who just chucks up shots, either -- Smith averages nearly seven assists and had a triple-double earlier this season at the Phoenix-area high school.\n      \n    \n          Stubbs hopes the big night bolsters his college recruitment after entering legendary territory with his full-blown takeover.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Basketball\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

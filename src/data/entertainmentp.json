    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for “Wuthering Heights,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\t“Wuthering Heights” director Emerald Fennell gave her hair and makeup department head, Sian Miller, a mood board of imagery featuring architecture, landscape, fashion, film, photography, food and kids with grass-stained knees. The vision board gave Miller a good idea of the vibe the filmmaker was going for as she brought her longtime obsession with Emily Brontë’s classic 1847 novel, “Wuthering Heights,” to life.\n\t\n\n\tFennell cast Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff and Margot Robbie plays Cathy in this tale of childhood friends turned tortured lovers, kept apart by heartbreaking misunderstandings and their own destructive decisions. When Cathy breaks her ankle while spying on their new neighbor, Edgar Linton (Shazad Latif), and his ward, Isabella (Alison Oliver), she ends up staying at Thrushcross Grange, and Edgar becomes besotted with her. Cathy, who’s gotten a taste of the luxurious life, decides to marry Edgar, although her heart really belongs to Heathcliff. When Heathcliff overhears Cathy telling her maid Nelly (Hong Chau) “it would degrade me to marry Heathcliff,” he  He doesn’t hear the rest of the conversation about how much she loves him, so he leaves town, and Cathy finds herself in a loveless marriage. That is, until Heathcliff returns to stir things up.\n\n\n\tFennell’s script was detail-laden, which helped Miller create the looks that would tell a story of jealousy, vengeance and lust. Robbie had more than 35 hairstyles for Cathy alone — and, in true Fennell style, “Vagina braids” and “Jesus Elordi” were some nicknames for some of those creations. Miller breaks down how the film’s hair and makeup told its own story, and why Robbie didn’t wash her hair for one key scene.\n\t\n\n\t“Jesus Elordi”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJaap Buitendijk\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen Heathcliff (Owen Cooper) is brought to Wuthering Heights as a boy, he’s a scruffy and dirty orphan. As he grows older, and Elordi’s version of the character is introduced, Miller rubbed the actor in dirt and even added fake blood to make him look bedraggled. “He’s grown up in the stables, and he should be unkempt. He’s going to hide slightly behind his hair,” Miller explains.\n\n\tOver the course of the movie, she had two looks for the actor: “It was ‘Jesus Elordi’ and ‘Darcy Elordi’ as Emerald and I mockingly called it,” she says about Heathcliff’s eventual transformation into a clean-shaven gentleman. “Reading the script, [the long-haired look] really rang out. I had the pleasure of knowing Jacob before [from ‘Saltburn’]; I asked him, ‘Can you just grow everything?” \n\n\tAnd he did. “He comes back a couple of months later and he’s grown this amazing beard,” Miller recalls. “We went, ‘Wow! This is phenomenal! We’ve got to try and keep the beard.'”\n\n\tBut it wasn’t going to be so simple as letting Elordi rock his natural scruff. Why? As is typical of moviemaking, Heathcliff’s arc wouldn’t be shot in order. Nevertheless, Miller persisted. “I was really, really keen to make that work. So I had to convince Emerald that I could recreate the beard in the Moors.”\n\n\tFortunately, she had recently trained with makeup and prosthetics artist Roberto Pastore to learn how to recreate Elordi’s real beard by laying on every individual hair by hand. But, the fake facial hair had to be strong enough to withstand the strong wind and rain planned for the production, so Fennell tested Miller’s handiwork before filming began.\n\n\t“It was a very kind of nail-biting [experience], and Emerald, outside the studio at Elstree, got the effects guys to hose him with, I likened it to a water cannon with a Rolls-Royce engine,” Miller says. “I said, ‘Please stay on. Please stay on. Please stay on.'”\n\n\t“Darcy Elordi”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs mentioned, when Heathcliff finally returns after a five-year absence, he is no longer scruffy and unkempt. He has suddenly come into money and has a new suave look, nicknamed “Darcy Elordi.”\n\n\t“I thought I can just create that style for the Darcy look with him,” Miller says, referencing the iconic character from Jane Austin’s “Pride and Prejudice.” “[Jacob] has great hair to work with and the sideburns. We just knew it was going to suit him, and he would look amazing.”\n\t\n\n\tYoung Heathcliff is missing a tooth, so when Heathcliff returns, Miller worked with prosthetic dental appliance creator Chris Lyons from Fangs Effects in the UK to fill the gap. “He made an overlay, an 18-karat gold tooth, and just slotted it over Jacob’s tooth. When he sat around the table in the dining room, and he’s smoking the pipe and smiles, you just see that little sparkle.”\n\n\tThe Vagina Braid\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs detailed as Fennell’s script was, the “Vagina hair” was not written in. But having worked with Fennell on “Saltburn,” Miller says, “There were talks of vagina early on,” so she wasn’t shocked when the conversation came up.\n\n\tMiller worked closely with production designer Suzie Davies, who said, “‘When we get back to Wuthering Heights, there’s going to be this big fissure in the wall where the house is falling apart, and it’s a vagina.'” In another scene, Isabella is given a gift for Christmas, and it’s a pop-up book; metaphorically, it resembles a vagina. \n\n\tMiller followed suit: “I’d seen something reminiscent of this style in my search — this plait at the back of the head. I thought, ‘If I make it smaller and we dress the hair around it.’ We just called it a ‘Vagina plait.’ That’s what’s great about working with Emerald, you show her things, ‘Oh, vagina plait. Yes, I love that.’ And we gave the hairstyles names. We really spur each other on.”\n\n\tDoll Braids\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen Cathy moves into Thrushcross Grange after her injury, Miller needed to demonstrate a passage of time so that when she returns to Wuthering Heights, there’s a visible transformation.\n\n\t“It’s the softest, and it’s the most subtle,” Miller says of Cathy’s new look. “There are ribbons in there, and they match the ribbons on the rose dress.”\n\n\tWhen she returns to the Grange after marrying Edgar, Isabella’s ribbon room has become Cathy’s dressing room, where she’s told all the dresses are made to her measurement. Then, she’s shown her bedroom where the wallpaper matches her skin — freckles, moles and veins all included.” Isabella also tells her, “There’s hair that I’ve taken from your hair brush that actually is around the top of the bed, and underneath the pedestal tables.”\n\n\tIsabella, who has led a sheltered, almost naïve life, shows Cathy to her dollhouse to present her with a doll, with braids from Cathy’s hair. “It’s a corset braid,” Miller says of the hairstyle, because of the way the ribbons tie at the bottom together like a corset. “The look on Cathy’s face is disturbing, and so begins this endless round of dress up.”\n\t\n\n\tIsabella has a doll version of herself, too, of course, which captured the way her style compared and contrasted with Cathy’s. “The brief there was that she’s childlike, she’s naive, and Emerald wanted her to have this long, fabulous hair, but it had to be kind of frizzy. It had to be kind of wild,” Miller says. “It had to be adorned with these wonderful headdresses, but sort of in contrast to Cathy, who has the silky, straighter, long hair. she wanted to show [Isbaella] as this very doll-like kind of innocent girl, and quite kooky with the little glasses.”\n\n\tAt this point, Cathy and Isabella are both bored. “We can see that when [Cathy’s] sticking the finger in the fish in aspic. It’s all very wonderful, but it’s not where she wants to be. And so it was the hairstyles had to show that,” Miller says. “It’s really about trying to show as many emotions and as many stages of the story arc as possible, and hair really sings out, and says so much about people and where they’re at and what’s going on.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAlison Oliver’s wild, frizzy locks contrast Cathy’s sleek braids.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFreckles and Horns\n\n\tThe Yorkshire Moors are Cathy and Heathcliff’s playground as young children, and, as adults, a place where they can be alone, so Miller added a subtle detail: freckles. \n\n\t“They’re exposed to the elements, so they’ve got flushed cheeks,” Miller explains. “Little Cathy (Charlotte Mellington) has freckles, which we then see on the older Cathy.”Miller worked with prosthetic designer Waldo Mason, who scanned both Mellington and Robbie to produce a vacuum-form mask. “I mapped out freckles onto both Charlotte and Margot, and I was able to translate those,” Miller says, noting that she used a bespoke mixture of durable makeup by Skin Illustrator so she could recreate the freckles in the same way every day and do it quickly.\n\n\tMiller says, “No matter what I was doing in this, apart from the freedom to come up with a lot of looks, I knew that what I had to do was also do it quickly, because it was a 51-day shoot, it’s not an infinite amount of time. It was a hell of a lot to do. So the pressure was to come up with as much as possible.”\n\n\tHowever, as Cathy finds herself indoors more often at Thrushcross Grange, the freckles become less prominent.\n\n\tWhat does change is her hair. Heathcliff’s return prompts Cathy to have a more severe look, so Miller put the character in victory rolls, which she nicknamed “horns. The horns allude to the cat-and-mouse game she and Heathcliff play, almost as if she’s taunting him. Miller was inspired by Vivien Leigh’s “Gone with the Wind” look, as that character, like Cathy takes a twisted turn.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJaap Buitendijk\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCathy’s Death Look\n\t\n\n\tIn Fennell’s adaptation, Cathy dies of sepsis poisoning. She’d been pregnant with Edgar’s child amid her affair with Heathcliff, but after breaking things off with her lover, Cathy one day declares the baby has died inside her, and her health begins to deteriorate.\n\n\t“Emerald said that she wanted the skin to look like wet concrete and to have that tone about it,” Miller says of Cathy’s bedridden look.\n\n\tWhen audiences first see the sepsis on her legs, Miller says, “Emerald was keen that we should try and portray that as accurately as possible.” She adds, “Emerald and I had a meeting with medical advisor, and I’ve done a lot of research into how that can look, and so that was taken from real reference.”\n\n\tMason, who had made the freckles, also made a decal for that look. “I punched it up a bit, and then it was a case of a couple of us just placing them together, sort of bit like a jigsaw down the legs, and then free-handing in between to kind of match it all up,” Miller says. “Margot wouldn’t wash her hair for us, just letting it go in great contrast to everything that we’ve had before.”\n\n\tIn an effort to save Cathy, doctors place leeches over her body in hopes of removing the bad blood. Those were created by the art department. “There was an army of us spticking them in place,” Miller says.\n\n\tIt’s an impactful shot when Heathcliff arrives at Thrushcross Grange and learns she has died. When he gets into the bedroom, Cathy is lying on the bed, covered by a sheet.\n\n\t“Heathcliff comes in and pulls the sheet back, and the contrast between his very livid face — because you can see the exasperation and the flush on his face, cheeks and the sheer desperation that upset everybody,” Miller says. “He’s so alive. He’s never been more alive, and there she is, and it’s the polar opposite.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDua Lipa made a surprise appearance at Berlin Film Festival on Saturday night to accompany her fiancé, Callum Turner, at the world premiere of his new film “Rosebush Pruning.” \n\n\tThe couple celebrated Valentine’s Day on the red carpet, looking so in love as they posed for photographers. Lipa wore a romantic see-through lace gown, while Turner sported a chic brown suit. There were plenty of smiles, laughs and cheek-kisses exchanged before Lipa squeezed Turner’s hands and stepped away, letting him take the spotlight. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCallum Turner and Dua Lipa attend the “Rosebush Pruning” premiere during the 76th Berlinale International Film Festival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTurner stars in “Rosebush Pruning,” a biting satire from “Motel Destino” director Karim Aïnouz, alongside Riley Keough, Jamie Bell, Elle Fanning, Lukas Gage, Tracy Letts and Pamela Anderson. All were on hand at the premiere besides Keough and Fanning. \n\n\n\t“Rosebush Pruning” follows four American siblings as they “wallow in isolation and their inherited fortune, eschewing the demands of their blind father and seeking love and validation through each other and their latest designer clothes,” according to the film’s synopsis. “When Jack, the eldest brother and linchpin of this family, announces that he is moving in with his girlfriend Martha, blood ties are severed and Ed is forced to uncover the truth surrounding their mother’s death. Generational lies begin to unravel, and the fabric of this family slowly begins to disintegrate.”\n\n\tEarlier on Saturday at the film’s press conference, Turner was immediately asked about rumors that he may be the next James Bond. “It’s very early for that question,” he said with a slight smirk. “I’m not going to comment on it.”\n\t\n\n\tLetts then took the heat off him by joking, “I’m sorry, I’m the next James Bond!” A relieved Turner replied: “Tracy, I thought you weren’t going to say anything.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCallum Turner and Dua Lipa attend the “Rosebush Pruning” premiere during the 76th Berlinale International Film Festival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Animation is no longer the very interesting but a bit eccentric cousin you don’t want to invite at a filmmaker’s wedding. Not only are we now invited to the wedding, we’re setting the guest list.” \n\n\tWith this opening punchline, Kaboom Artistic Director and Berlin EFM Animation Days opening speaker Aneta Ozorek earned cheers from the international crowd of animation professionals gathered under the Mirror Tent before giving the floor to scriptwriter, animation expert and MIFA Pitching sessions’ host Dennis Alme de Visscher for the first Canadian Animation Spotlight at EFM, co-hosted by Telefilm Canada.  \n\t\n\n\tCanada has a long lasting relationship with the animated medium, on both commercial and independent levels. According to numbers shared by Telefilm Canada, Canadian animated films have appeared 10 times in the annual Top 15 Canadian box office performers over the past seven years.\n\n\n\t“We’re seeing explosive growth in animation with funding requests doubling in the last seven years,” added Joyce Richards, advisor & strategic communications. “Since 2017, animation projects generated over $270 million in production volume, and more than 60% of that investment came from Canadian sources.”\n\n\tAnimation is also one of Canada’s most export-driven screen sectors, with 83% of gross sales coming from international markets. “A number far higher than live action films”, underlines Richards.  \n\n\tGoing beyond these numbers, Dennis Alme de Visscher added that co-production agreements and audiovisual treaties were key in developing the Canadian animation landscape. “As of now, Telefilm Canada has collaborations with over 60 countries. And 35 of those treaties grant a special certification, which makes your project eligible as national production in both countries, not just one.” A powerful incentive, especially for animation which often boasts higher production costs. \n\t\n\n\tOn Thursday, Canadian animation was represented by three projects in various development stages, ranging from family-friendly adventure and adult animation to Medieval fantasy with a vintage twist. Producers pitched their projects in front of a supportive and captivated audience, as is always the case with animation crowds. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFifteen Dogs\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFifteen Dogs\n\n\tFrom producers Steven Hoban and Mark Smith (Copperheart Entertainment) comes an adaptation of André Alexis’s Giller Prize–winning novel “Fifteen Dogs,” helmed by Hoban’s long-term collaborator and Academy-Award winning director Chris Landreth (“Ryan”, “Jeu de l’inconscient”). A story that begins with a wager between Greek gods, experimenting on human nature by granting a group of Toronto dogs human intelligence. Shortly after they realise their newfound consciousness, the dogs escape into the city where they navigate shifting loyalties, new language, and emerging identities. Their evolving relationships (especially the bond between Majnoun and Nira) explore sentience, companionship and whether self awareness ultimately brings joy or suffering.\n\n\tAfter several attempts, Hoban managed to put André Alexis’ novel into Landreth’s hands back in 2018. From then on, the two have been building this project as a fully animated cinematic experience. One that, according to the duo, could only be accomplished through animation. “It’s not a family film”, underlined Landreth. “‘Fifteen Dogs’ is a deep, darkly funny story, emotionally powerful and sometimes tragic. We want to turn this absurd premise of gods wagering on dogs, into something that is intensely real.” Throughout his career, Landreth has played with real world physics and proportions to bring forth a form of psychological realism and truth. An artistic shift from CG animation that earned him the Academy Award in 2005 for “Ryan,” a homage to Ryan Larkin, a gifted Canadian animator of the late 1960s and the early 1970s. \n\n\t“‘Fifteen Dogs,’ even though its told through the eyes of canine protagonists, will tackle what human life is really all about,” added Hoban. “We’re working with studio L’Atelier to craft compelling settings and relatable characters, and from what we’ve seen so far, they’ve done an amazing job. Chris is crafting a visually spectacular, devastating film.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEliak\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEliak and the End of the World\n\n\tPresented by Galilé Marion-Gauvin, producer at L’Unité Centrale (which worked on both Jean-François Laguinoie’s “Louise en Hiver” and Pierre Földes’ “Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman”), “Eliak and the End of the World” follows young Eliak in a post-apocalyptic world ruled by the spirits of nature, as she learns to survive this harsh environment. When Tata, her adoptive mother and guardian of the seeds, dies, she becomes the last human on Earth. Consumed by grief, she plunges into the ocean to retrieve her soul. She must choose: stay with her mother or become the oasis they sought. \n\n\tWith “Eliak”, Melanie S. Dubois is set to make her feature directorial debut. “Mélanie is a young and promising director from Montréal,” added Marion-Gauvin, “and I’m happy to share that we’ve secured development funding, and that we are working on a second draft script right now, taking our time to refine and develop the project as best as we can. We’re also looking for different creative partners to collaborate with Mélanie, such as artistic director or co-director.” \n\n\tFor this animation family-friendly project, L’Unité Centrale is also looking for distributors, investors and potential partners. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBeshader\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBeshader\n\n\tFrom director-screenwriter Seth Smith and Nancy Urich comes “Beshader,” a dark medieval fantasy aimed at young adults and teenagers not afraid of a little scare. In a valley lost to permanent night, in a land overtaken by vampiric overlords, an orphaned boy joins a band of rebels to reclaim their homeland and restore the light. \n\n\t“Seth and I have been working on feature film projects for 15 years”, added Urich. “At CUT/OFF/TAIL Pictures, we normally produce live-action, but we’ve also been looking for the thrills from 1980s classics such as ‘Labyrinth,’ ‘Return to Oz’ or even ‘Dark Crystal.’ imaginative projects with a dark edge that aren’t that common nowadays.” \n\n\tThis was the starting point for “Beshader,” a project that Urich and Smith want to build with rotoscope animation. “We are now consulting leaders in the field such as Minnow Mountain, who worked recently with Netflix on ‘Apollo 10 ½’ and with Amazon Prime on ‘Undone’. We’re now at a second draft of the script, and we will soon ask Telefilm Canada for 33% of our budget, and apply to other digital animation tax credits in our province to complete our budget, which is around $5 million. Overall, Canada will provide for 60% of the total budget, and we are looking for sales agents and equity investors to complete the remaining 40%.”\n\t\n\n\tUrich and Smith are also looking for co-producers with expertise in animation.\n\n\tFrom Berlin to Bordeaux\n\n\tBeyond EFM, Québec-Canada have already been announced as the guest countries for Cartoon Movie, the biggest European co-production for animated features. Six projects will be presented to buyers, sales agents, investors and producers alike at this top-tier event, starting March 3 in Bordeaux. \n\n\tFinally, Dennis Alme de Visscher underlined the perks of investing in Canada. “There are some serious tax incentives for international co-producers. From Canada, you can get up to 16% tax incentive. But, as you know, Canada has a lot of different provinces, so you could stack those incentives. British Columbia offers 16%, Ontario 18%, and Québec offers 40%, which is why Montréal has become one of the largest animation hubs in North America.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tJust 24 hours after Sean Baker arrived in Penang, Malaysia, to shoot “Sandiwara” — the Oscar-winning director’s new short film starring Michelle Yeoh — he threw his initial script out the window.\n\n\t“It was ridiculous,” Baker tells Variety in a quiet corner of the Ritz Carlton in Berlin, where the short premiered on Friday. “It was like exactly what someone from the outside would be writing from their couch in West Hollywood.”\n\n\n\tBaker’s original idea for the short, which is in collaboration with fashion house Self-Portrait’s Residency program — an initiative aimed at bringing together artists from all disciplines to create without boundaries — was a “caper” that saw Yeoh “running from some gangsters,” he says. But once he spent some time in Penang, the director found new inspiration. “It was immediately apparent that this is one of the major foodie destinations in the world,” he says, adding that the city is also “very physically different than what I imagined.”\n\t\n\n\tSelf-Portrait founder Han Chong, who grew up in Penang, wanted to make a film celebrating his roots. “It’s much deeper than just fashion,” he says. “Especially when we have Michelle and Sean, I didn’t want to restrict them with a fashion film. The whole idea is tell a story of my hometown — the culture, the emotion.” \n\n\tShot on an iPhone, “Sandiwara” follows Yeoh as she embodies five different characters — an influencer, food critic, chef, restaurant server and singer (all wearing Self-Portrait clothes) — as their stories intertwine at a Penang food court. For Chong, it was a dream come true to get Yeoh on board, who he sees as “Miss Malaysia.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHan Chong, Michelle Yeoh and Sean Baker at Berlin Film Festival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“In Asia, she represents possibility, so everyone looks up to her,” he says. “And I didn’t just want to do a campaign. I wanted her to represent something for our Asian culture on a global stage and also her talents.” \n\n\tEnticed by the lack of creative constraints and the chance to get to work with Yeoh, Baker signed on to the project not long after. “Their energy together was so incredible,” Chong adds. “Both of them just wanted to make this work really well. The amount of time they put in, how generous they were, I was like, ‘No way.'” \n\n\tBelow, Baker tells Variety more about “Sandiwara,” working with Yeoh, life post-Oscars glory — and reveals the premise of his next film.\n\t\n\t\tHow did the idea for “Sandiwara” come to be and what drew you to the project? \t\n\n\tIt was just before I started getting very busy with “Left-Handed Girl,” which takes place in night markets in Taiwan and it was shot on the iPhone as well. So I was like, I can do that, I just came from that. But I quickly learned that I was being a little naive — [Chong] was mentioning night markets and food courts, so I just naturally assumed, ‘Oh, it will be very similar.’ But it’s not, it’s its own thing. And so that discovery was wonderful too, because I was able to spend nine days over there prepping for two days of shooting.\n\t\n\t\tYou met Michelle Yeoh for the first time on set. What was it like working with her? Obviously, you two got along since you presented her with an honorary Golden Bear this week at the festival.\t\n\n\tYou know, it was an instantaneous connection. I did not feel intimidated — I normally do with big stars, so it has to be her personality. She’s just very open. Ever since the shoot, which was late September, we’re text buddies. It quickly became a friendship and I think it’s just because she’s really down to earth. There’s no diva quality whatsoever. So much so that we went two hours over on both nights, and she didn’t even blink. She’s like, “I don’t care, let’s just make this happen. We only have this time, let’s do it.” She was very dedicated to it — she wasn’t phoning it in in any way, shape or form.\n\t\n\t\tThis film sees you return to your roots of shooting on an iPhone, and part of it has you shooting on a bike through the streets of Penang. What was that like?\t\n\n\tWe knew she was on a bike, so I was on a bike too. That’s how we shot a lot of “Tangerine,” going up and down Santa Monica. And we crashed on the first take, and I was like, “Oh, this is not going to go well.” But then we got it. \n\t\n\n\tWe did some of this in “Anora,” but this was almost fully not controlled. We of course had permission to shoot in that big food court, but 95% of the people in the background are real people, those are not hired extras. So to throw Michelle Yeoh, who is an A-lister, in the middle of that was really exciting for me. Because in the past, yeah my actors were known, but they were blending in to a certain degree. Now, the challenge was to be able to get stuff in the same conditions with an A-lister. And I think it’s a testament to just how much she took on these characters, that of course there would be some double takes — like, “Wait a minute, is that Michelle Yeoh there?” — but it wasn’t like, “That’s Michelle Yeoh!” It was questionable. \n\t\n\t\tWhat interests you about the intersection of film and fashion?\t\n\n\t[Fashion] always inspires me because in all of my films, my characters’ wardrobe choices are very intentional and important. But also, I like to be experimenting with style and so this is my way of doing it. Television is such a machine and commercial spots are obviously not yours whatsoever as the director — this fashion world is the only place where it feels like I’m making one of my films. And Han gave me full creative control. The only thing I was questioning the entire time was, “Is this the most G-rated thing I’ve ever done? Are people going to expect her to suddenly strip?” That was the only thing that I was kind of asking myself, like where is the edge? But I feel that because we’re shooting with the iPhone under florescent lights and stuff like that, there’s still a grunge and a grit.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichelle Yeoh in “Sandiwara.”\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDo you feel like things have finally calmed down for you since the craziness of “Anora’s” awards run?\t\n\n\tI went right from “Anora” into “Left-Handed Girl” into this, and so there really hasn’t been a lot of breathing room. But it did take a while to process, I have to tell you. And it didn’t help that I was having to suddenly campaign with “Left-Handed Girl.” I was very happy and proud of that movie, but I also don’t know if I could have gone through all of that again. It’s a lot. So to answer your question, Samantha [Quan, his producer and wife] and I can finally take a deep breath and we don’t have the pressure anymore. A lot of the weight of expectations and stuff has been kind of lifted because winning the Palme d’Or was like my dream come true. And that’s not embellishment — that was my one goal in life. So it happened, and then everything else, including the Oscars and the BAFTAs, it was all gravy. And then it was just like, OK cool, so now there’s no reason to fret anymore. We have to stay grounded and we are — I’m not jumping into an $150 million movie, I’m just simply not doing that.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHave there been offers from studios?\t\n\n\tI was offered development deals, but I very much want to make my films independently. I mean, it would be amazing if Neon in the States would distribute my film again. I’d love to work with them again so much. But we are making our film independently so that I can retain full control in terms of everything from casting to content, and not even have to take one note. Because that drives me up the wall. It’s like, why?  \n\t\n\t\tSo what is your next film? I’ve heard rumors of it being set in Italy and starring Vera Gemma…\t\n\n\tOh, yeah. It’s my love letter to the Italian sex comedies of the ’60s and ’70s, so I’m leaning into that. We want to shoot this year. \n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen the time came for Karim Aïnouz to direct his first English-language feature a few years ago, few would have bet on it being “Firebrand.” A historical drama based on the life of Henry VIII survivor Catherine Parr, it was handsome, well-acted and directed with complete proficiency by the Brazilian arthouse sensualist, but so far from his usual taste for saturated melodrama and eroticism, you’d think he’d been assigned the gig by lottery. After a brief trip home for the hyper-carnal thriller “Motel Destino,” Aïnouz returns to Europe with “Rosebush Pruning,” which on the face of it looks a snugger fit for his sensibilities: a sweating, absurdist family saga of outsize gestures and out-of-bounds desires, rendered in hues so hot and drenched, you half-expect a “wet paint” sign on the screen.\n\t\n\n\tThe more — and more outrageously — it unfolds, however, the less “Rosebush Pruning” feels like it’s in Aïnouz’s wheelhouse. Or, indeed, anyone else’s, given its alluring but thoroughly peculiar jumble of comic, dramatic and generally antic tones, or the increasingly indeterminate target of its hollow social satire. Even the film’s creative DNA is all over the shop: Screenwriter Efthimis Filippou, a regular collaborator of Yorgos Lanthimos, was loosely inspired by Marco Bellocchio’s 1965 debut feature “Fists in the Pocket,” but where you can see that stark, startling anti-bourgeois fable playing out in the deadpan language of the Greek weird wave, Aïnouz’s ripe maximalist touch makes for a different animal entirely, even before you factor in the high-low contrasts of its all-star cast.\n\t\n\n\tAll these clashing elements and impulses, not to mention some droolworthy design contributions, land the film somewhere in the region of a Europudding “Saltburn” — not an unenjoyable proposition, but not a substantial one, and likely to be every bit as divisive with audiences as that sounds. For leading man Callum Turner, it’s a commendably strange, kinky vehicle to drive directly into a storm of James Bond casting rumors. Not that “Rosebush Pruning” turns out to be business as usual for any of his collaborators — including his gifted director, drifting ever farther from the warm romanticism of “Futuro Beach” or “Invisible Life.” \n\n\tThe odd, misleadingly prim title stems from a clumsy proverb made up by Edward (Turner), the neglected, semi-literate middle son of an exceedingly wealthy American family that relocated some years ago to the verdant northeastern coast of Spain. “People are roses, families are rosebushes,” he says in his surly running voiceover. “Rosebushes need pruning.” \n\n\tAs for who he thinks his family could shed, take your pick from its variously louche, dysfunctional fashion-plate members, headed by Tracy Letts’ blind, unfiltered patriarch, usually clad in a scarlet satin bathrobe. Edward’s younger brother Robert (Lukas Gage) spends his days doing little but pining most inappropriately for the attentions of eldest sibling Jack (Jamie Bell), while the stunted, oversexed energy of lone sister Anna (Riley Keough) spits in all directions.\n\n\tWhen we’re told that the children’s mother (Pamela Anderson, surprisingly cast in a small role that more obviously calls for Christine Baranski-style hauteur) died two years ago, we’re inclined to think she’s better off out of it — though perhaps less so on hearing that she was torn apart by wolves in the local Catalonian woods. There’s an air of perverse adult fairytale to this setup, underlined by the lack of explanation as to why four adult siblings in their thirties haven’t managed to break out of the modernist family palace: Extreme wealth, it seems, makes comfortably numb prisoners of those born into it. \n\n\tBut Jack, the most sensible and straitlaced of the lot, may finally be making his escape, thanks to the normalizing influence of his merely quite privileged girlfriend Martha (Elle Fanning). As Jack and Martha look into finding a home of their own, the terse, stolidly watchful Edward — an oddly opaque character to carry the film’s point of view, played with aloof melancholy by Turner — is tacitly envious, having recently made his own fleeting connection with a citizen of the real world. Anna and Robert, however, despair over the imminent disruption of the family unit, and drastic, escalatingly calamitous steps are taken toward maintaining the status quo. \n\t\n\n\tThe fallout brings nasty surprises and broken taboos aplenty, though Filippou’s script actually shocks most effectively when dramatizing more everyday acts of cruelty and elitism. In the film’s most effectively discomfiting scene, when Martha meets the family for a strained lunch, she is ruthlessly sized up and dressed down by Anna for the visible price gap between her self-bought Zara dress and her gifted Bottega handbag. (And that’s before Dad, with calm entitlement, asks Anna to describe their guest’s cleavage.) \n\n\tThat Martha emerges as the most sympathetic figure here is saying something, considering her own spoilt retort to Jack’s hesitancy when they view a multimillion-dollar oceanside mansion: “I refuse to keep begging for the simple things.” “Rosebush Pruning” makes its anti-capitalist points tartly enough in such moments, but the twistier things get, the sillier they get too — while any social commentary begins to feel like a thin cover for so much luridly gross, glossy spectacle. \n\n\tStill, there’s pleasure in the film’s excesses, mainly because Aïnouz and his team present them with such febrile, iridescent beauty. DP Hélène Louvart drowns frame after frame in sticky candy-apple reds, angelica greens and eye-searing ultramarines, the brightness turned way, way up — not that the rolling Spanish landscapes and Rodrigo Martirena’s magazine-dream production design demand the extra help. There’s nary a crease to be seen in Bina Daigeler’s costumes, all covetable, unapproachable and tailored to the gods; Matthew Herbert’s score may be among the lushest ever slathered over such horrible goings-on. Does it all need to be this lustrous? Does “Rosebush Pruning” lose some perspective in all this dazzle? Perhaps. But if you’re going to eat the rich, the film reasons, they may as well be delicious.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Josephine,” a psychological thriller starring Channing Tatum, Gemma Chan and newcomer Mason Reeves, has been acquired for the U.S. by Sumerian Pictures in a competitive seven-figure deal.\n\n\tSumerian, which was founded by Ash Avildsen as an artist-led independent creative studio and recently expanded into film distribution, has committed to a major theatrical release and awards campaign for the film.\n\n\n\t“Josephine” made its world premiere at this year’s Sundance, moving audience members to tears and becoming the festival’s first sensation. It’s set to debut internationally at the Berlin Film Festival next week. The heart-wrenching drama is a work of autobiographical fiction from writer-director Beth de Araújo about an 8-year-old who witnesses a rape in Golden State Park. De Araújo’s on-screen proxy is Reeves, whom she discovered by canvassing a farmer’s market in their native San Francisco. Tatum and Chan play Josephine’s parents, who must navigate the little girl’s trauma amid the quest for justice for the survivor. The A-listers also served as producers on the project.\n\t\n\n\t“It was magic when her audition tape came in,” the filmmaker, named one of Variety’s 10 Directors to Watch for 2026, told Variety about Reeves. “She’s never acted before, but she’s an incredibly smart and emotionally intelligent person.”\n\n\t“I’m pleased to see that Sumerian has emerged as a new distribution company, made up of people who love films and are committed to inviting audiences into the theaters,” de Araújo said in a statement.\n\n\tAvildsen and Sumerian Pictures president Rob Williams, who negotiated the deal with WME Independent and CAA Media Finance, added that “Josepihne” is “an enthralling, deeply emotional and powerful film that deserves all the acclaim and accolades it has already received from Sundance. We are so thrilled to be working with Beth de Araújo and the whole team to bring this to audiences with Sumerian Pictures.” \n\t\n\n\tSumerian Pictures’ upcoming theatrical slate includes the rom-com “Mile End Kicks,” David Verbeek’s “The Wolf, the Fox and the Leopard,” “Broken Voices” from Ondřej Provazník and “Horsegirls” directed by Lauren Meyering. \n\n\t“Josephine’s” emotional Park City premiere on Jan. 23 marked a full-circle experience for De Araújo, since she developed the material through the Sundance Institute’s directors’ lab. The director wiped away tears as she was welcomed to the stage at the Eccles with a standing ovation; the crowd continued to clap and cheer as the cast joined her with Tatum picking up his pint-sized co-star to swing her around with glee. \n\n\t“It may sound strange to use the word ‘subtle’ to describe a film that opens with a brutal assault, and yet, de Araújo excels in constructing a universal human experience out of incredibly specific details (whether drawn from memory, research or her imagination),” Variety’s Peter Debruge wrote in his review of the film, where he also praised the actors for their powerful and nuanced performances.\n\n\t“Josephine” is de Araújo’s second feature after the single-shot thriller, 2022’s “Soft & Quiet,” which debuted at SXSW and was subsequently acquired by Blumhouse. The film was released that fall by Momentum Pictures.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Trump posted a lengthy message to Truth Social on Saturday morning in which he recalled his White House dinner with “Real Time” host Bill Maher. The president called the evening a “total waste of time” and said Maher is “no different” than his more liberal leaning late-night nemeses like Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert.\n\n\t“Sometimes in life you waste time,” Trump wrote. “T.V. Host Bill Maher asked to have dinner with me through one of his friends, also a friend of mine, and I agreed. He came into the famed Oval Office much different than I thought he would be. He was extremely nervous, had ZERO confidence in himself and, to soothe his nerves, immediately, within seconds, asked for a ‘Vodka Tonic.’ He said to me, ‘I’ve never felt like this before, I’m actually scared.’ In one respect, it was somewhat endearing! Anyway, we had a great dinner, it was quick, easy, and he seemed to be a nice guy and, for his first show after our dinner, he was very respectful about our meeting — But with everything I have done in bringing our Country back from ‘OBLIVION,’ why wouldn’t he be?”\n\t\n\n\tTrump’s post seemed to be, in part, motivated by Maher, on Friday, making fun of the president’s claims that China will “terminate ALL Ice Hockey” in Canada if the two nations make a trade deal.\n\n\n\tTrump added, “In any event, it was a total waste of time for me to have this jerk at the White House and last night, after explaining what a DISASTER Canadian ‘Leaders’ are to deal with, how Canada has ‘ripped off’ the United States for years on TRADE (But not anymore!), I jokingly stated in a TRUTH that, ‘The first thing China will do is terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada, and permanently eliminate The Stanley Cup.’ Well, he went on and on about the Hockey statement, like ‘What kind of a person would say such a foolish thing as this,’ as though I were being serious when I said it.”\n\t\n\n\tTrump then attacked Maher’s ratings and called him a “highly overrated LIGHTWEIGHT.”\n\n\tHe concluded, “Fortunately, his Television Ratings are so low that nobody will learn about his various Fake News statements about me. He is no different than Kimmel, Fallon, or Colbert but, I must admit, slightly more talented! Anyway, Bill Maher is a highly overrated LIGHTWEIGHT, and Republicans should stop using him to show how the Left is coming over our way — Our Base, the Greatest of All Time, laughs at your weakness when you do it! Maher asked me if he could come back to the White House again and, with his friend, also asked to come to the wonderful White House Christmas Party, but he didn’t. Regardless, I’d much rather spend my time MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN than wasting it on him.”\n\n\tIn April of 2025, Maher gave a much gentler account of his dinner with Trump. He said during an episode of “Real Time” that Trump was “gracious” and “much more self-aware than he lets on in public.”\n\n\t“The guy I met is not the guy who the night before the dinner shit-Tweeted a bunch of nasty crap about how this dinner was a bad idea and what a deranged asshole I was,” Maher said. “Just for starters: he laughs. I’ve never seen him laugh in public. But he does, including at himself. He’s not fake.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIntense and intently observed, Teodora Ana Mihai’s “Heysel 85” chronicles the eruption of violence before a major soccer match in Brussels. Its setting is the real Heysel Stadium disaster of 1985, but it presents its drama through fictionalized reporters and local leaders, and thus creates an engrossing political microcosm. Using a combination of staged footage and archival tape, Mihai conjures the era with deft aesthetic control, all while creating a work of commentary that feels distinctly of the now. Even though it comes awfully close to tipping its hand, it remains an anxiety-inducing work of cinéma vérité.\n\t\n\n\tBeginning with a montage of news footage from the day — the notorious May 1985 European Cup final between Italian club Juventus and English rivals Liverpool — the film’s open text informs viewers, or rather warns them, that disturbing historical images may follow. The official record seamlessly gives way to Mihai’s documentary-style 16mm footage, as a Belgium-based Italian reporter, Luca (Matteo Simoni), interviews an enthusiastic young Juventus fan for the radio, a boy who turns out to be Luca’s younger brother. The chaotic sounds of fans streaming into Heysel Stadium cross-pollinates between the real and unreal footage, creating an enveloping atmosphere. The artifice is given away only by the wider aspect ratio of the dramatized elements (compared to the televised 4:3 tape).\n\n\n\tWith equal panache, and without cutting away, the narrative focus is handed like a baton in a relay race to the arriving Mayor Dumont (Josse De Pauw) and his daughter and press attaché Marie (Violet Braeckman). Their presence draws both the news cameras and the film’s frame inside the stadium’s offices and VIP lounges, trading the real game-day footage of fans for a dramatized tour of otherwise unseen backrooms beneath the stands, all as the roar from the crowd increases outside and up above. Through both press conferences and private discussions, a number of topics are broached including public safety, but Dumont casts them aside. His focus is on the optics of the game, and on entertaining the arriving Italian dignitaries who’ve come to watch. However, even before the characters realize it, they’re in a disaster movie, as news and whispers start to leak out about bloody confrontations between fans. The conscientious Marie and Luca begin to gather information, while helping people translate between English, Italian, Dutch and French.\n\t\n\n\tLike a blazing inferno, the riot spreads swiftly and suddenly. But as concerned as the reactions may be, politicians and policemen alike seem to knowingly (and preemptively) pass the blame around. Before long, it becomes clear to our good-natured heroes — the attaché and the reporter — that this could have been avoided had egos not got in the way. As the film increasingly ropes in real clips of the day’s events, it expertly cross-cuts them with snaking shots through stadium hallways that grow more crowded with bloodied figures — some injured, some dead — as Marie tries to assess the situation while helping people, and Luca tries to track down his missing family, further personalizing the stakes.\n\n\tMihai’s films, including the Cannes Un Certain Regard prizewinner “La Civil” and last year’s Romanian Oscar submission “Traffic,” have long captured women navigating oppressive systems. Her use of Marie — a woman whose ideas are often dismissed in this space — as a point-of-view character speaks to a similar approach. It also reflects Mihai’s own entry point into making a film about a major event in soccer’s history, a topic for which she calls herself an “unusual suspect.” \n\n\tHowever, the film’s brief 91-minute runtime does sometimes over-pronounce this thematic focus by drawing attention to specific interactions and reactions laced with misogyny. While this is by all means ethically commendable — the worlds of sport, politics, and sporting politics are known to be hostile to women — it’s also aesthetically awkward in the way it pulls focus and energy from the sweep of the erupting brutality, and the bustle of the ensemble at large. As much as Marie is a key protagonist trying get out from under her father’s thumb, the most important character is arguably the event itself, the way it morphs and mutates, and eventually, spits out bodies.\n\n\tDespite this, “Heysel 85” proves riveting at every turn. This is due not only to how Mihai and cinematographer Marius Panduru control the frame’s chaotic movement, but to the realism with which the entire production is rendered, from the designs of its costumes and spaces, to the performances that sit effortlessly between naturalistic and symbolic. \n\t\n\n\tFor a film such a this to arrive in a FIFA World Cup year is a stark reminder of the entwinement between soccer and corruption, and De Pauw’s performance as Mayor Dumont — a man inclined to compartmentalize and pass the buck — is wonderfully pathetic. However, the human soul here is in Braeckman and Simoni’s utterly committed work as well-meaning people thrust into morally difficult circumstances that leave them torn, each in their own way, between family and social duty.\n\n\tEven as the mayhem seems temporarily under control, looming questions remain about how to defuse the ticking time bomb that is 60,000 rowdy spectators in an enclosed stadium, a dilemma that especially fans outward into a metaphor for confronting an incendiary, agonized world. There isn’t a moment in “Heysel 85” that doesn’t feel drenched in gasoline, and although its events are over 40 years old, watching them unfold becomes a stark reflection of what it feels like to live in a world teetering on the edge of a knife.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIan de la Rosa’s “Iván & Hadoum,” world premiering in Panorama at this year’s Berlinale, is the most visible evidence of a wave of Catalan first features that has been nurtured by development labs, shorts programs and an institutional infrastructure now bearing fruit.\n\n\tDe la Rosa’s trajectory is instructive. His short “Farrucas” won the Gaudí Award, making him the first trans filmmaker to claim the prize in Spain. He also co-wrote episodes of HBO Max’s hit series “Veneno.” \n\t\n\n\tNow, with a Spain-Germany-Belgium co-production exploring love, identity and labor in the greenhouses of southern Spain, he joins a generation of Catalan debuts that blend personal vision with international ambition.\n\n\n\tSomething is shifting in Catalan cinema. The region’s new generation of filmmakers is no longer bound by the intimate, place-specific arthouse mode that often defined the late 2010s New Catalan Cinema —with Carla Simón’s “Summer 1993” as its perhaps its emblematic title. They are pushing into genre, into international co-production, into areas their predecessors rarely touched.\n\n\tThe pipeline runs through initiatives like RECLab, the industry arm of Tarragona’s REC Festival, which has supported breakthrough debuts, seen in rough cut, including Estibaliz Urresola’s “20,000 Species of Bees” (Berlin competition 2023) and Mikel Gurrea’s “Cork” (San Sebastián New Directors 2022).\n\n\t“In early years, we made space for films which were much more indie, fiction-documentary hybrids. We were part of the Catalan new wave,” Javier García Puerto, director of Tarragona’s REC Festival and RECLab, has told Variety. “Little by little, we’ve diversified in themes and styles, drilling down on Spain’s deep creative diversity — from the most indie arthouse to creative docs and genre pics.”\n\t\n\n\tWhat distinguishes this generation is a willingness to blend registers. Arthouse sensibility meets genre beats. Social commentary delivers uplift rather than despair. The intimate becomes universal.\n\n\tJaume Claret Muxart’s “Strange River,” which world premiered in Venice’s Horizons last year, exemplifies the approach. A coming-of-age story following a teenager on a cycling holiday along the Danube, the film won the Golden Puffin at Reykjavík, where the jury praised Claret Muxart for revealing “a precocious and accomplished talent that never indulges in mannerisms or formalism.” Shot in Catalan, “It felt right to hear my own language in my first feature,” the director said previously. It sold internationally via Films Boutique.\n\n\tGemma Blasco’s “Fury,” meanwhile, channels personal trauma into theatrical form. After being sexually assaulted at 18, Blasco spent years preparing to tell the story. “It didn’t take me long to realize that, one day, I would end up making this film, because I couldn’t find any references that I felt represented me and the way I was feeling inside,” she said previously. The result won three major prizes at Málaga and opened D’A Film Festival in Barcelona. Filmax released it theatrically across Spain.\n\n\tOther debuts to track include Lucía Aleñar Iglesias’ genre-tinted grief drama “Forastera,” which won the Fipresci Prize for Emerging Filmmakers in Toronto, and Júlia de Paz Solvas’ drama “The Good Daughter, which  swept the Tallinn Black Nights Festival in November, scooping its Grand Prix, actress and Audience Awards. She spoke to Variety at the time of wanting to explore “new languages, more associated with a masculine register, such as a thriller or an action film.”\n\n\tOther ones to watch include Claudia Estrada’s “Wolf Grrrls,” part trap musical, part aspirational drama, but packing a social-issue undertow, and David Gutiérrez’s Pyrenees-set “The Convulsions,” a Tallinn Works in Progress winner. \n\n\tThis marks a generational shift. Where their predecessors often worked with budgets under €1 million ($1.2 million) and pan-Iberian co-production partners, this cohort is building international packages from the outset and finding audiences both at festivals and, increasingly, at the box office.\n\t\n\n\tOther Catalan Titles Selected for Berlin\n\n\t“Porto Alegre” \n\n\tDirector: Álvaro Gago\n\n\tThe second feature from Gago, whose “Matria” was selected for Berlin’s Panorama 2023. “Porto Alegre” has been selected for Berlin’s Co-production market. While “Matria” is bittersweet, “Porto Alegre” looks more uplifting, described as “a vibrant drama,” about young Tomé who, after his mother’s death, discovers strength to sustain himself in his roots and community. Mireia Graell at Barcelona’s Ringo Media once more co-produces. \n\n\t“Robbery, Beating and Death” \n\n\tDirectors: Marcel Borras and Nao Albet\n\n\tSelected to pitch at the  Berlinale’s Series Market Co-Pro Series, “Robbery, Beating and Death” stars Borras and Albet, distinguished Catalan playwrights and inseparable writer-director friends commissioned to write a series about a bank robbery. Their ambition for recognition drives them to unforeseen consequences. “‘Robbery, Beating and Death’ uses comedy to explore universal themes: friendship, family, loyalty, work, art, capitalism and the contradictions of our industry,” saysMarta Baldó at Funicular Films, which is behind Canneseries winner “This Is Not Sweden.”\n\n\t“Stallion and a Crystal Ball”\n\n\tDirector: Christian Avilés\n\n\tAvilés’ “La herida luminosa” scored a Berlinale Shorts selection and an EFA nomination, and here his hallmark magic realism is mixed with queer desire as a teen casts a spell to be united with his fantasy hero. A Shortcut title marking the fourth year running in which the film school/production house Escac/Escándalo makes the Berlinale Shorts cut.\n\n\tJohn Hopewell contributed to this report\n",

    "body": "\n\tCatalonia arrives at this year’s Berlinale with its broadest spread of selections in years — including a Panorama feature debut, “Iván & Hadoum,” a buzzy Max series about Barcelona’s gentrification crisis, a returning shorts director and a Latin American minority co-production — all backed by full value chain support by the Catalan government’s cultural agency ICEC.\n\n\tThe Berlin showing marks a new chapter for a region that has spent the past decade building one of Europe’s most dynamic audiovisual ecosystems. Previous Berlin editions showcased Catalan cinema’s arthouse credentials — such as Carla Simón’s 2022 Golden Bear winner “Alcarràs” and Estibaliz Urresola’s best leading performance laureate “20,000 Species of Bees” in 2023 — but this year’s selections demonstrate a deliberate pivot toward larger diversity of format and international reach.\n\t\n\n\t“One of its driving forces is the diversity of projects, which reflects the fact that most production companies now operate with a varied slate,” ICEC director Edgar Garcia told Variety. “This has resulted in an extraordinary richness not only in the productions’ genres but also in their narratives and formats, ranging from series, feature films, short films … to international co-productions.\n\n\n\tThe flagship selection is Ian de la Rosa’s “Iván & Hadoum,” world premiering in Panorama, an across-the-tracks love story set in southern Spain. A co-production between Spain, Germany and Belgium, the film won the Eurimages Award at the 2023 Berlinale Co-Production Market — a vindication of the networking infrastructure Catalonia has built over many years.\n\t\n\n\tDe la Rosa’s trajectory exemplifies ICEC’s shorts pipeline. His previous short, “Farrucas,” a Gaudí Award winner and Goya nominee, caught the attention of producers who shepherded the feature into production. \n\n\tFor De la Rosa, winning the Eurimages Award at Berlin’s 2023 Co-Production Market was “the definitive push we needed to connect the project with the international market, gain visibility and continue writing the script.”\n\n\tThat pipeline runs through ICEC’s Shortcat program, now in its 19th year. Each year, six shorts are selected for international distribution support, with filmmakers gaining access to festival strategy and market connections. \n\n\tThis year, director Christian Avilés returns to Berlin with “Stallion and a Crystal Ball,” having previously premiered “Daydreaming About Our Spanish Holidays” in the shorts competition.\n\n\tThe Catalan government has been treating audiovisual as “both a creative and strategic industry,” Garcia noted. “As a result of this approach, the audiovisual sector has built a strong alliance with the private stakeholders operating in it, becoming a true game-changer for the industry.”\n\n\tThe Shortcat program’s alumni include Lucía Romero, whose”Cura Sana” won a Berlin 2024 Crystal Bear. The film delves into young sisters’ lives shaped by ancestral violence and the lasting impact of abuse. Filmax is now developing a feature, selected for this year’s Berlin Co-Production Market.\n\n\tThe most ambitious Catalan project at Berlin in many ways, however, is “Ravalear: Not For Sale,” the six-episode Max series from Oscar-nominated “Robot Dreams” producer Arcadia Motion Pictures and the first Catalan series selected for Berlinale Special Series. Created by Pol Rodríguez and co-directed with Isaki Lacuesta, who previously teamed on Malaga top winner “Saturn Return,” the series is inspired by Rodríguez’s family’s century-old bar in Barcelona’s Raval neighborhood and plunges viewers into a city caught in the grip of gentrification, identity crisis and survival.\n\n\t“It’s about memory versus progress,” Rodríguez has said about the series. “What happens when the identity of a neighborhood is erased for profit?”\n\n\tStarring Enric Auquer, “Sirāt’s” Sergi López and Francesc Orella, “Ravalear” was backed by ICEC’s High-End TV Production Fund, which provides up to €1.5 million ($1.8 million) for Catalan-language series with budgets exceeding €4 million ($4.7 million). The fund, launched in 2022, has already proven its worth: Leticia Dolera’s “Pubertad,” another recipient, recently sold to Arte via Beta Film.\n\t\n\n\tThe model is working. If French and German series travel internationally on Netflix and other platforms, the logic goes, why not Catalan?\n\n\tRounding out Catalonia’s Berlin presence is “Narciso” from Berlin winner Marcelo Martinessi (“The Heiresses”), a Panorama selection co-produced between Paraguay, Germany, Uruguay, Brazil, Portugal, Spain and France. Barcelona-based B Team boarded the project through ICEC’s minority co-production fund, which offers up to €300,000 ($354,000) to position Catalan producers as international partners. Set in 1958 Paraguay, the film follows a charismatic musician who becomes both a sensation and a symbol of freedom under military dictatorship. Luxbox handles world sales. \n\n\tCatalan-language movies are also gaining traction at Spain’s national box office. “El 47,” the Mediapro Studio’s Catalan-language drama about a bus driver who hijacked his own bus to serve an underserved Barcelona neighborhood, became the highest-grossing Catalan film in 40 years, taking €3.4 million ($3.7 million) at Spanish theaters. Dani de la Orden’s “A House on Fire” added another €3.1 million ($3.4 million). It marked the first time that a Catalan film, in Catalan langauge and shot in the region, hit No. 1 at the Spanish box office.\n\n\tFor Catalonia, the remaining frontier is scale. The soft-money structures that enable €1.5 million to €4 million productions struggle to support the larger-budget mainstream productions that could compete with international studio fare. \n\n\tBut at Berlin, with the ICEC-backed projects spanning features, series, shorts and international co-productions, the ecosystem is making its broadest case yet that almost all cylinders are firing. \n",

I told him where to stick it.\"\n      \n    \n          Kennedy has won two Olympic medals, including gold in 2010. Eriksson is no rookie ... he has four medals and won gold in 2022.\n      \n    \n          BTW ... officials didn't call a foul on Kennedy -- but many online feel he may have double-touched the stone.

    "body": "\n\tFamily adventure film “Kangaroo Kids” has a new home.\n\n\tScatena & Rosner Films announced the acquisition of North American rights to “Kangaroo Kids,” which is now set for VOD and digital release on Feb. 17. Branscombe Richmond (“The Wrecking Crew”) headlines the cast of the family-friendly action adventure film, along with co-stars Kathleen Kinmont (“Halloween 4”) and Emily Ashby (“Zombie Strain”).\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEmily Ashby, Kathleen Kinmont and Branscombe Richmond.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaul Smith/Marisa Leigh/John Rodart\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRichmond’s son Fairai Richmond directed “Kangaroo Kids,” which is his second feature film.\n\t\n\n\tPer the press release, “Kangaroo Kids” is the story of “Johnny (Josefina Baeza), a young girl working at her mother’s struggling zoo, who forms an immediate, headline-making bond with the famous kangaroo brought in to save it. The attention attracts con artist Jacob (Robbie Allen), who sends three clumsy thieves led by Kodiak (Richmond) to steal the kangaroo and appease the wealthy Kathryn (Kinmont) and her ailing son. As the thieves bumble through their attempts to capture it, Jacob has to call in his lethal weapon, Maria (Ashby), to get the job done while Johnny rallies her friends to save the kangaroo and the zoo while thwarting Jacob’s plans.”\n\n\t“’Kangaroo Kids’ is a joyful adventure that captures the magic of friendship, courage and teamwork,” Gato Scatena, managing director at S&R Films, said in a statement. “We’re thrilled to bring this heartwarming story to families this February and share a film that will leave kids and adults smiling from start to finish.”\n\n\tThe film was originally set to be released in 2023 on the now-defunct Sunn Stream OTT platform. In addition to the North American rights, Scatena & Rosner Films helped to complete post-production and will also handle Latin American distribution, as well as international sales \n\t\n\n\t“Kangaroo Kids” is now available for pre-order via iTunes, Amazon and Google Play.

    "body": "\n\tAnimator Matt Braly says that Sony Pictures Animation scrapped his Thai-inspired animated movie after two years of development because the studio deemed it “not commercial enough to produce.”\n\n\tBraly, a writer on Cartoon Network’s “Steven Universe” and storyboard artist on “The Mitchells vs the Machines,” doesn’t specify the studio in his lengthy Instagram post detailing the situation. However, Sony Pictures Animation announced in 2023 the development of a feature from Braly and writer Rebecca Sugar.\n\t\n\n\t“At the very start of 2025 I received the unfortunate news that the movie I had been working on for 2+ years at a major animation studio would not be moving forward,” Braly wrote on Instagram. “I’m super proud of the lovely script that Rebecca Sugar and I wrote together and am disappointed that you will all likely never get to see the film. I had a really supportive development team, but the film was ultimately judged as not commercial enough to produce. I understand these decisions are not made lightly and have nothing but respect for the studio, which continues to put out amazing films.”\n\n\n\n\tSony Pictures Animation didn’t respond to Variety’s request for comment.\n\n\tBraly described the film as an adventure about a “a teen boy traveling to the world of Thai spirits in order to cure himself just before undergoing a very scary & life altering operation necessary to live.” He added that this was “not a story about finding a cure so much as it was about learning to accept one’s unchangeable circumstances with grace, and realizing that a different life than expected can still be a wonderful one.”\n\t\n\n\t“It was a deeply personal story for me as I was diagnosed with an incurable chronic illness at a very young age that brought permanent changes to my lifestyle,” Braly continued. “Not only that but it would have been an honor to bring more Thai culture to the big screen, a torch I hope someone else picks up.\n\n\tBraly also shared some of the artwork that was created during the development process. “Hopefully you can close your eyes and imagine how cool the film would have been if completed. I won’t lie – this decision really knocked the wind out of me for a few months and I struggled to find enthusiasm to be creative again,” he concluded. “With some space though I think the experience has strengthened my resolve about what I’d like to pursue next and how I’d like to go about doing it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAcademy Award winners Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are officially returning for a fourth installment of the blockbuster franchise, “The Mummy.”\n\n\tUniversal Pictures has dated the movie for a wide theatrical release on May 19, 2028.\n\n\tFraser and Weisz, whose involvement was first reported last fall, have closed deals to reprise their roles as adventurer Rick O’Connell and Egyptologist Evelyn O’Connell in the movie, plot details for which are being kept — not unironically — under wraps.\n\t\n\n\tThe actors’ legend begins with the 1999 reboot of “The Mummy,” which follows a treasure hunter who accidentally awakens a cursed Egyptian priest with supernatural powers. The movie and its 2001 sequel “The Mummy Returns” were major box office hits, reviving the classic monster movie IP and establishing Fraser as a bankable action star. Weisz, however, did not appear in the 2008 threequel “The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,” so her return to the franchise is particularly thrilling for fans. \n\n\n\tThe new “Mummy” movie is directed by Radio Silence’s Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett (“Ready or Not” and sequel “Ready or Not 2: Here I Come”) from a screenplay by David Coggeshall (“The Family Plan,” “Orphan: First Kill”). \n\n\tSean Daniel — who has produced each installment of the $1.8 billion-grossing franchise at the studio since 1999’s “The Mummy,” including “The Mummy Returns,” “The Scorpion King,” “The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor” and the 2017 Dark Universe project “The Mummy” — also returns for the film. \n\n\tWilliam Sherak, James Vanderbilt and Paul Neinstein also produce through Project X Entertainment.

    "body": "\n\tKid Rock posted a video on X in which he tried to explain what happened during his performance of “Bawitdaba” during Turning Point USA’s All-American Halftime Show, which aired on Super Bowl Sunday as an act of protest against the NFL’s decision to have Bad Bunny perform during the big game. Kid Rock was widely accused of lip synching “Bawitdaba,” as at various times during the performance he was blatantly out of sync with the actual music. Kid Rock denies such accusations on X, writing: “No lip-syncing like the haters and fake news are trying to report.”\n\t\n\n\t“That song is chaos,” Kid Rock explained in a video post. “The first thing is, if I was ever going to lip sync — which I wouldn’t — that would be the last song I would ever do it to. We performed this song every night on tour since 1998 since the day it was released. Turning Point USA sent me a first cut [after] we taped it and my comment was, ‘the sync is off.’ They were trying to line it up … It was very difficult for them, because somebody clearly wasn’t super familiar with the song. It could have been done had we had more time.”\n\n\n\t“So I have nothing but good things to say — not only about Turning Point, but the production team that they work with,” Kid Rock continued. “Nobody’s perfect every time. But for the haters and the trolls out there, that’s exactly what happened. And by the way, most of you know this. Some of you in the entertainment world can look at that and be like, ‘the sync is off.’ But they had to lie and say, ‘Oh, he was lip syncing.’ Then people amplify this all over the internet. And I know most people don’t even care, but the certain people just keep repeating it, so people think it’s a fact. And this goes on on both sides. They did it to Bad Bunny, in his defense, when … he was on ‘Saturday Night Live’… they [claim lip syncing] far too often, especially in the fake news media, the left-wingers, the crazy libtards.”\n\t\n\n\tKid Rock was widely mocked on social media for allegedly lip-synching during Turning Point USA’s Halftime Show while Bad Bunny delivered a spectacular live performance at the Super Bowl. Jimmy Kimmel quipped that Kid Rock was in a “lip sync battle with himself,” adding that MAGA often “complains about how bad everything is, and then they do it worse.” \n\n\tIn an interview on Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle” the night after both halftime shows, Kid Rock shaded Bad Bunny by saying of his performance: “Like most people, I didn’t understand any of it. I saw there’s a lot of dancers and a lot of big to-do stuff. And, you know, he said he wanted to have a dance party; it looked like he had one.”\n\n\tKid Rock continued, “Not my cup of tea, but I don’t fault that kid for doing the Super Bowl, getting in front of a global audience. I fault the NFL for putting him in that position and Turning Point for having to come out and have an alternative for people to watch. You know, it’s just — poor kid.”\n\nMy halftime performance was pre recorded but performed live. No lipsycing like the haters and fake news are trying to report. When they synced the cameras to my performance on Bawitdaba, it did not line up as I explain in this video. pic.twitter.com/k1x1RfI9RY— KidRock (@KidRock) February 10, 2026\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlarm bells are sounding again over the fate of Argentina’s beleaguered film-TV body, INCAA. A draft proposal from Argentina’s administration includes a repeal of key articles that will impact the institute. These articles currently guarantee dedicated funding for INCAA, mostly drawn from box office receipts.\n\n\tWhile the bill does not formally dissolve INCAA, industry reps warn that eliminating its specific funding sources would effectively weaken the institution by forcing it to depend on general allocations from the National Treasury. This could threaten Argentina’s already declining audiovisual sector.\n\t\n\n\tFIPCA, the Ibero-American Federation of Cinematographic and Audiovisual Production, has lodged a petition urging members of Argentina’s congress to prevent what it describes as an “audiovisual blackout” in the country. Its senate is slated to debate the new bill on Feb. 11.\n\n\n\tThe petition has been signed by a wide swathe of industry leaders across Ibero-America. Among the more than 800 signatories are Pedro Almodovar, Spanish producer Juan Gordon of Morena Films, Argentine star Adrian Suar, Chile’s Andrés Wood (“The House of the Spirits,” premiering at the Berlin Film Festival) and Argentine director Marcos Carnevale (“Heart of Lion”).\n\n\t“The future of Argentina’s audiovisual production is going through a critical moment. The potential loss of its historic sources of financing places the industry at a crossroads that demands rigor: audiovisual production is not a decorative activity, but an industry that competes in global markets and in every country with significant output, operates under specific public policies,” FIPCA president Ignacio Rey told Variety.\n\t\n\n\t“Within that same bill there is an article that repeals three articles of the Film Law – specifically the ones that provide INCAA with its earmarked funds. That is, it eliminates the 10% tax on movie tickets that has existed for 60 years, as well as two other revenue sources that were established in the 1994 reform of the law. This leaves INCAA at the mercy of the Ministry of Economy to grant whatever amounts it chooses, whenever it chooses,” explained Gabriela Sandoval, FIPCA vice president.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChile’s Gabriela Sandoval, Fipca VP, Co-Founder Storyboard Media. Courtesy of Fipca\n\t\n\n\n\n\t “This change could significantly limit the institute’s operational capacity and jeopardize the continuity of an industry that generates employment, exports services and contributes high value-added economic activity across the country,” FIPCA stated in its petition.\n\n\tRey cited the case of Brazil: “Before 2019, with [Brazil’s film-TV body] ANCINE active, the sector was growing and internationalizing. Between 2019 and 2022, when the agency was defunded, production contracted and dozens of companies closed. Since 2023, with the reactivation of incentives, the industry has recovered. The result is measurable: in 2025 Brazil won the Oscar for International Feature Film with ‘I’m Still Here,’ and this year received five nominations, including best International Feature Film and Picture for ‘The Secret Agent.’”\n\n\t“The public financing of the audiovisual sector is not an Argentine exception; it is the global standard for film industries worldwide. The countries that lead global production combine support funds and tax incentives to attract investment, develop talent and compete in the global content economy,” said FIPCA VP Diego F. Ramírez of 64-A Films (“Dog Eat Dog”).\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDiego Ramírez of Colombia’s 64-A Films, Fipca Vice President. Courtesy of Fipca\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSince rising to power in December 2023, Argentina’s current administration has moved forward with a sweeping economic adjustment agenda, delivering on campaign promises of deep cuts to public spending. Its omnibus bill proposed in January 2024, which would have scrapped INCAA, failed to pass, after massive protests and a petition signed by the world’s most celebrated filmmakers made an impact. This new petition hopes to achieve the same result.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNovi Brown has signed with Innovative Artists Entertainment for representation in all areas, Variety has learned exclusively. She continues to be repped by Alta Global Media and Crawford Talents, Germany. \n\n\tBrown is best known for her starring role in the hit BET series “Sistas,” which hails from celebrated and prolific creator Tyler Perry. Brown starred as Sabrina Hollins in the first nine seasons of the show, exiting ahead of the 10th, which is began airing in January 2026. The show has proven to be strong part of BET’s scripted lineup, inspiring two spinoffs already — “Zatima” and “Divorced Sistas.” \n\t\n\n\tBrown also starred in and was a consulting producer on the holiday film “A Wesley South African Christmas” directed by Patricia Cuffie-Jones, working opposite Jasmine Guy, Dorian Wilson, T.C. Carson and Terrayle Hill. She has appeared in numerous other leading roles, including films like “Alone in the Dark,” “The First Noelle,” and “Holiday Hideaway.” Aside from “Sistas,” she previously appeared on the hit CBS procedural “NCIS.” \n\n\n\tIn theater, Brown appeared in stage productions of “The Vagina Monologues,” “Dutchman,” and “Boston Marriage.” She was also an investor in the recent Broadway production of “Othello” starring Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal. The production sold out all performances and quickly became one of the most talked about shows in all of Broadway. \n\n\tAs a producer, Brown executive produced the short film “Drugs Are Fun,” which recently secured a spot at the Pan African Film Festival. There are plans to develop the film into a series. \n",

We are at an hour of desperation, and we need your help.”\n",

The adult content creator reportedly had unprotected sex with around 400 men, setting a world record.\n      \n    \n          That's right ... While the Winter Olympics wage on in Italy, the bedroom Olympics raged in the UK over the weekend. Us Weekly reports Bonnie -- real name Tia Billinger -- had men waiting in line for up to 7 hours at Lord Davenport's mansion on February 7 for the chance to \"breed\" her.\n      \n    \n          According to Us Weekly, the previous record was 65 men. That achievement was reached by Ariana Jollee in 2004.\n      \n\n          Bonnie, 26, told the publication, “I was concerned I’d drown with the amount of fluids I had planned to consume, and did consume by the end of the day. I wanted the men who wanted to be a dad the most, with the strongest swimmers, to get a fast pass to the front of the queue.”\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          We don't know if those \"swimmers\" swam breaststroke, backstroke or freestyle ... but it looks like they all, uh, swam the race to completion.\n      \n    \n          But it's unlikely any of this would result in a new life being brought into the world. Bonnie has previously gone public about her fertility struggles.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          “I tried to get pregnant for years with my ex-partner and really, really struggled and I’d have to go down the IVF route,” she told Us Weekly in June 2025. “So I wish I could say I might get pregnant, however, I’m not in that position where I can fall pregnant naturally.”\n      \n    \n          This marks Bonnie's second record-setting feat. She claimed to have slept with 1,057 men in 12 hours back in January 2025. Sadly, OnlyFans star Lily Phillips beat the brakes off that record when she allegedly slept with 1,113 men within the same time constraint.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Bonnie Blue\n              \n                          \n                Lily Phillips\n              \n                          \n                Sex\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                          \n                OnlyFans\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Demi Lovato just pulled the plug on a whopping five dates from her \"It’s Not That Deep\" tour.\n      \n    \n          In a lengthy IG Stories post Tuesday, Demi revealed she’s also pushing back the tour kickoff -- moving it from April 8 in Charlotte, NC to April 13 in Orlando, FL -- saying the call is all about protecting her health.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Demi explained once rehearsals got underway, it became clear she’d overextended herself. Bottom line: she needs more time to \"rest and rehearse\" so she can actually make it through the entire run.\n      \n\n          The cities on Demi's chopping board include Charlotte, Nashville, Atlanta, Las Vegas, and Denver. The Disney alum apologized to her fans and laid out exactly how and where they can get refunds.\n      \n    \n          Those fans will be understandably bummed ... especially since Demi hasn’t toured since 2022 and this new tour was meant to follow the release of her ninth album last October. Now, they'll just have to regroup, grab refunds, and start booking flights to the cities that survived the cut!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Demi Lovato\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                          \n                Disney\n              \n                          \n                Concerts and Tours\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

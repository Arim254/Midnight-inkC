    "body": "\n\tThe Mediapro Studio Distribution has pounced on the international rights to period series “The Marquise” (“Leonor, Marquesa de Alorna”), capping a flurry of activities at the Berlin Film Festival where it showcased films and TV series to which it has worldwide distribution rights.\n\n\tThis ambitious adaptation of the bestselling novel by Portugal’s Maria João Lopo de Carvalho was created by Pandora da Cunha Telles. It centers on Leonor de Almeida Portugal, Marquise of Alorna– a poet, diplomat and revolutionary thinker, who was considered one of the most captivating women of the 18th century.\n\t\n\n\tThrough six episodes, the series traces the Marquise’s life, from her early childhood in a Lisbon convent to her years at Vienna’s royal court and in revolutionary France. There she bears witness to the monumental changes sweeping across Europe before she returns to Portugal. Once back home, she makes it her mission to challenge despotic rule and foster education.\n\n\n\tProduced by Da Cunha Telles’ Lisbon-based label Ukbar Filmes and Spain’s Tornasol Films, an Oscar winner with Juan José Campanella’s “The Secret in Their Eyes,” it is set to debut on Portuguese pubaster RTP and Netflix in Portugal.\n\n\tThe Mediapro Studio also presented the latest film titles in its vast catalog, including “Lapönia,” “Aida y Vuelta” and “Mesa de Regalos” at the EFM.\n\n\tAt the Berlinale Series Market Selects, it showcased two new series, Daniel Burman’s “So Far So Good” (“El resto bien”) and Hernán Caffiero‘s “Raza Brava.”\n\n\t“So Far So Good” is the latest from Daniel Burman, made for the Argentine platform Flow. Produced by The Mediapro Studio’s Oficina Burman and Latin America’s production-services house Cimarrón, the new dramedy series from Burman and actor-director Daniel Hendler, who helmed Netflix’s 2025 San Sebastian opening film “27 Nights,” follows a successful comic book artist in the throes of a mid-life crisis.\n\t\n\n\tStarring Benjamín Vicuña, Rita Cortese, Violeta Urtizberea and Jorge Bolani, the eight 30-minute episodes were co-written by Burman and a team of often regular writers. It features appearances by Hendler, Andrea Frigerio, Alejandro Awada and Marina Bellati and will premiere on Flow in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.\n\n\t“Raza Brava,” created by Hernán Caffiero who won an International Emmy in 2018 for his anthology series “The Suspended Mourning,” is the first fiction series about a real Latin American soccer team: Colo-Colo and comes at a time when World Cup “futbol” fever is coming to a head.\n\n\tProduced by DeCulto alongside Erik Barmack’s Wild Sheep Content and Atomica, with support from Chilean broadcast network CNTV, it is based on actual events that took place in the Chilean capital of Santiago more than two decades ago.\n\n\tIt follows Carlos “Barti” Aguilar, a young man from a blue-collar neighborhood who rises to become a leader of the White Claw (Garra Blanca), rabid supporters of the Colo Colo soccer club. With his pal Clavo, he is sucked into a sordid world of new-found wealth and power-battles where White Claw, once a source of identity and respect, becomes a prison.\n\n\tStarring Gabriel Muñoz, Karla Melo and David Gaete, the production cast thousands of real soccer fans as extras, adding authenticity to scenes filmed at Colo Colo’s Estadio Monumental and other real-life locations in Santiago where the scenes in the series took place.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Marquise,  Courtesy of Ukbar Filmes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRita Carmo\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBritish detective drama “Bergerac” is heading to the U.S. with PBS Distribution following a deal with Banijay Rights. \n\n\tThe acquisition comes ahead of next week’s London TV Screenings, with PBS securing the first two seasons of the show with plans to launch later this year. \n\n\tSet in Jersey, “Bergerac” stars Damien Molony (“The Split,” “Brassic”) as detective Jim Bergerac and is based on the iconic original series created by Robert Banks Stewart, which was led by John Nettles and ran for nine series on the BBC between 1981 and 1991. Billed as a “modern re-imagining,” the new “Bergerac” sees one character-led murder mystery run across all six episodes, in place of a new storyline each episode. It’s produced by BlackLight TV, part of Banijay UK, Jersey-based Westward Studios and supported by Visit Jersey for free-streaming service, U and U&DRAMA in the U.K.\n\t\n\n\tThe reboot proved to be a hit, with the first season watched by 2.4 million viewers across U and U&DRAMA, making it the highest-rating show on UKTV’s network in 2025. A second season is set to launch early this year.\n\n\t“Stylish, enthralling and an edge-of-your-seat detective drama, ‘Bergerac’ is destined to be huge draw for U.S. audiences, so we couldn’t be more pleased with this deal,” said Matt Creasey, vice-president sales, co-productions and acquisitions at Banijay Rights, who helped negotiate the deal. “Featuring Jim Bergerac’s iconic Triumph Roadster car and set against the stunning backdrop of Jersey, this is a series that continues to generate worldwide attention as we head into next week’s London TV Screenings.”\n\t\n\n\t“Bergerac” is written by Toby Whithouse (“The Red King,” “Being Human”), alongside Brian Fillis (“Trust,” “Sirens”), Catherine Tregenna (“The One That Got Away,” “Three Pines”), Polly Buckle (“Love Rat,” “A Discovery of Witches”) and Emilie Robson (“War,” “The Case”), and Ashley Sanders and Faebian Averies who joined the writing team for series two. \n\n\tAlongside Molony, the drama also stars Zoë Wanamaker (“My Family,” “Shadow and Bone”) as Charlie Hungerford, Philip Glenister (“Steeltown Murders,” “Life on Mars”) as Arthur Wakefield, Chloé Sweet Love as Jim’s daughter, Kim, Robert Gilbert (“Big Boys,” “Killing Eve”) as Barney Crozier, Lesley Sharp (“Red Eye,” “The Full Monty”) as Monica Barton and Adrian Edmondson (“Alien: Earth,” “Death In Paradise”) as Charlie’s new flame, Nigel.\n\n\t“This smart re-imagining of the iconic detective series is sure to capture the attention of audiences in the U.S.,” said Germaine Sweet, head of content aquisition and sales at PBS Distribution\n\n\t“We are thrilled that ‘Bergerac’ will find a new audience in the U.S.,” added Ben Bickerton and Philip Trethowan, executive producers at BlackLight TV. “With its gripping stories, stellar cast and stunning locations, we are sure they will be hooked.”\n\n\tThe agreement with PBS follows previously announced international sales to broadcasters including WOWOW in Japan, NPO in Netherlands, VRT in Belgium, SVT in Sweden, YLE in Finland, NRK in Norway, DR in Denmark, BBC First in Poland, TVNZ in New Zealand and ABC in Australia.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSpanish streaming platform Filmin and Belgium’s Boucan Film Production have boarded the series “Robbery, Beating & Death” (“El pitjor atracament de la historia”) from “This is Not Sweden” producers, Funicular Films.\n\n\tUpscale SVOD service Filmin also produces original shows and holds a vast catalog of classic films. It also hosts dedicated country channels, like that of Costa Rica.\n\n\n\tFounded by producers Boris Van Gils and Michaël Goldberg, Boucan describes itself as a company that makes audience-driven auteur films with mainstream appeal. It has offices in Brussels, Abidjan and Paris. Among their notable credits are Stephan Streker’s “Noces,” nominated for a Best Foreign Film César award in 2018 and Belgian box office hit “Les Rayures du Zèbra.”\n\t\n\n\tParticipating in the Berlinale Co-Pro Series event, the series turns on two lifelong friends who are hired to create a television series centered on a bank heist. Eager for the acclaim they’ve always been denied, they cling to the bold, extreme philosophy of a mysterious artist they admire. Determined to prove themselves, they push their project beyond fiction—choosing not to film the story, but to carry out a real bank robbery instead.\n\n\tSaid Funicular’s Marta Baldó: “Framed as a playful guide to pulling off the greatest heist in the world, ‘Robbery, beating and death’ uses comedy to explore universal themes: friendship, family, loyalty, work, art, capitalism and the contradictions of our industry.”\n\n\t“Like science fiction or dystopia, its meta layer lets us talk about the present human condition with political and philosophical bite,” she noted.\n\t\n\n\tMarcel Borràs and Nao Albet have written and directed the series, in which they will also star. The rest of the cast has yet to be confirmed.\n\n\t“Robbery, Beating & Death” received vital support from Catalan cultural agency, ICEC, a pillar of Catalonia’s robust audiovisual production landscape.\n\n\tICEC’s High-End TV Production Fund, launched in 2022, allots up to €1.5 million ($1.8 million) for Catalan-language series with a minimum budget of €4 million ($4.7 million).\n\n\t“This Is Not Sweden,” first presented at Series Mania 2024, picked up the Best Performance award for Aina Clotet at Canneseries 2024. It also won the Prix Europa for Best European TV Fiction Series. Clotet has directed her first feature film, the love triangle drama “Oh Nora!” based on a screenplay she co-wrote with Valentina Viso. It is co-produced by Funicular and Ikiru Films and is currently in post.  \n\n\tBowing in Spain on Catalonia’s 3Cat and national pubcaster RTVE, “This is Not Sweden” follows a young couple, Mariana and Samuel who resettle, along with other yuppies, to a chic, leafy community perched on the western hills overlooking Barcelona, determined to create the best possible life for their young children.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSony Pictures Television has shared with Variety the very first look stills from “S.W.A.T. Exiles,” the upcoming 10-episode spinoff of “S.W.A.T.” with star and EP Shemar Moore. \n\n\tSPT has released behind-the-scenes photos and cast images before but these are the very first first look stills from the new show. The images drop ahead of Sony Pictures’ 2026 Showcase at next week’s London TV Screenings, Europe’s biggest TV market in the first half of 2026, where “S.W.A.T. Exiles” is shaping up as one of its major draws and conversation drivers. \n\t\n\n\tThat’s almost inevitable. Sony Pictures Television moved waves last May when it announced the spinoff at the L.A. Screenings without a U.S. domestic deal in place. Little more than two months before CBS had announced it was canceling “S.W.A.T.” after eight seasons. SPT’s decision to go ahead with the spin-off was broken down in depth by Variety, in conversation with Sony Pictures TV chairman Keith Le Goy and Sony Pictures TV Studios prexy Katherine Pope. \n\n\n\tProduction wrapped Feb. 10 with SPT as yet to announce a U.S. network or streamer, though that could change soon. The London Screenings will most probably be the first time many international buyers get to see something from the series, with the added enticement of seeing what they do together, so able to gauge peer reactions.\n\n\tThe first look stills anticipate some of the show’s attractions,  catching not only “S.W.A.T” mainstay Moore back as Daniel “Hondo” Harrelson but also additional but new series regulars for “S.W.A.T. Exiles” including Lucy Barrett (“Deep Water,” “Charmed”), Adain Bradley (“Warfare,” “Tarot”), Zyra Gorecki (“La Brea”), Freddy Miyares (“When They See Us”), and Ronen Rubinstein (“9-1-1: Lone Star”).\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRonen Rubinstein as Jude Callan, Lucy Barrett as Sammy Bishop, Shemar Moore as Daniel “Hondo” Harrelson, Adain Bradley as Malik Anderson, Zyra Gorecki as Cassidy Reed, Freddy Miyares as Ethan ColeS.W.A.T. Exiles – Season 1 – Episode 102 — Photo Credit: Kit Karzen/Sony Pictures Television\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKit Karzen/Sony Pictures Television\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe offshoot’s logline is pretty well known: After a high-profile mission goes sideways, Daniel “Hondo” Harrelson is pulled out of forced retirement to lead a last-chance, experimental S.W.A.T. unit made up of untested, unpredictable young recruits. Hondo must bridge a generational divide, navigate clashing personalities and turn a squad of outsiders into a team capable of protecting the city and saving the program that made him who he is. \n\n\tCertainly, Hondo looks pretty reflective and concerned in one of the first look stills as events challenge his legacy and his assumptions about authority, so sense of self.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tS.W.A.T. Exiles – Season 1 – Episode 103 — Photo Credit: Kit Karzen/Sony Pictures Television\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKit Karzen/Sony Pictures Television\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJason Ning (“Lucifer”) serves as showrunner and executive producer. Additional executive producers include Neal H. Moritz and Pavun Shetty of Original Film, Moore, James Scura and Jon Cowan. \n\n\t“‘Exiles’ honors everything audiences love about the original: big epic action, adrenaline. But it pushes it into more personal territory,” Ning told Variety. “This time, it’s not just about what happens on the streets of L.A., it’s about what it costs the people in that stack. Pairing a battle-tested leader like Hondo with a generation that challenges him at every turn creates real friction, and real evolution. It feels modern, character-driven, and built for the long haul.”\n\n\tThat “personal territory” is caught very well in a group shot where Hondo looks be rebuking Adain Bradley’s Malik Anderson as some recruits stare at Hondo in mistrust or outright hostility (Zyra Gorecki as Cassidy Reed). \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKit Karzen/Sony Pictures Television\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen it comes to character dynamics, there may or may not be a hint of romance between Ronen Rubinstein as Jude Callan and Lucy Barrett as Sammy Bishop. Or maybe not. \n\n\tFurther cast sees Lenora Crichlow (“Bel Air”) set as a recurring guest star; fan favorites Jay Harrington, Patrick St. Esprit, and David Lim are confirmed to return as guest stars, reprising their roles as Sergeant David ‘Deacon’ Kay, Commander Robert Hicks and Victor Tan. Last week Selma Blair (“Cruel Intentions”) and Jerry O’Connell (“Billions”) were announced as guest stars.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tS.W.A.T. Exiles – Season 1 – Episode 101 — Photo Credit: Kit Karzen/Sony Pictures Television\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKit Karzen/Sony Pictures Television\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“S.W.A.T. Exiles” “promises to deliver the same high-stakes drama and intense action sequences that fans have come to know and love,” Sony Pictures Television said Wednesday noting that “S.W.A.T.” has reached nearly 2 billion hours watched globally and has been a top 10 series in 47 countries throughout its eight-season run. \n\n\tA final still shared with Variety shows Hondo, as ever, ready for action.\n\n\tThe “S.W.A.T.” spin-off isn’t Sony’s only show in town, however.  At the London TV Screenngs, Mark Young, SPT’s EVP, distribution and networks, EMEA, will lead a special mix of presentations and panels of new dramas, and titles across SPT’s non-scripted and formats slate as well as a preview of some major titles set for local screenings and the LA Screenings across 2026. \n\n\tA closer look at some other potential highlights:\n\n\t“Dear England”\n\n\tAnother big swing for SPT at this London TV Screenings, produced by high-flying SPT-owned Left Bank Pictures (“This City is Ours,” “The Crown”) for BBC iPlayer and BBC One. Set for release in 2026, the four-part drama adapts James Graham’s hit National Theatre play about manager Gareth Southgate’s battle to overturn the decades-long record of underperforming loss suffered by England’s soccer team. Based on James Graham’s Olivier-award winning play, and starring Joseph Fiennes as the kind, quiet spoken Southgate. \n\n\t“Up to No Good”  \n\n\tSPT promises a first glimpse of “Up to No Good,” with Glenn Close, produced by Playground for SPT and Channel 4 and now filming in London. Nina Raine (“Bach & Sons,” “Consent”) and Moses Raine (“Donkey Heart”), best known as playwrights, adapt Helene Tursten’s short story collections. Close leads the series as Maud Oldcastle, an older woman described as cantankerous and also a killer. \n\n\t“American Hostage”\n\n\tCo-created and executive produced by Shawn Ryan (“The Night Agent,” “S.W.A.T.”) and Eileen Myers (“Big Love,” “Mad Dogs”), a thriller anthology series from Sony Pictures Television headed by “Mad Men” star Jon Hamm in the first of eight episodes. This is the true story of radio reporter Fred Heckman under pressure to talk a man out of killing his hostage.\n\t\n\n\t“Do You Know Your Place?”\n\n\tThe new BBC Two celebrity quiz format with Vernon Kay (“All Star family Fortunes”), testing guests’ knowledge of the U.K. “The Traitors’” Paul Gorton acts as Vernon’s unreliable tour guide.\n\n\t“Wheel Of Fortune,” “Jeopardy!” \n\n\tSPT will also be spotlighting these two SPT formats, two of the best-known gameshows in the world.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tS.W.A.T.

    "description": "\n\tITV Studios has unveiled its London TV Screenings slate, with a Graham Norton-hosted reality show, two drama series from Ben Stephenson’s Poison Pen",
    "body": "\n\tITV Studios has unveiled its London TV Screenings slate, with a Graham Norton-hosted reality show, two drama series from Ben Stephenson’s Poison Pen Studios, and a new drama series from Russell T. Davies among the headliners.\n\n\tAmong the star names attached are Dominic Cooper, Romola Garai, Mia Wasikowska, Alan Cumming, Abbie Cornish, Dougray Scott and Luke Evans.\n\n\tVariety spoke to Tom Clark, executive VP global sales and commercial strategy, about the slate, which includes six new formats and 12 fresh dramas, as well as 21 returners among the dramas, and 34 non-scripted titles. Some 750 international buyers will be attending the slate presentation, titled “ITV Studios Festivals,” on Feb. 25 at Odeon Leicester Square, London.\n\t\n\n\t“What we’re looking to do is to maintain an eclectic international offering for a global market,” Clark says. “So, as ever, we’ve gone for scale and breadth of the slate. We’ve got everything from contemporary relationship drama to cat-and-mouse crime to action thriller, all the way to a new survival format, glossy reality and cooking, and plenty in the natural history and non-scripted space.”\n\n\n\tHe adds, “All of that is brought together by the wonderfully talented in-house ITV Studios’ production companies, such as World Productions, Mammoth Screen, Plimsoll Productions, Poison Pen and Quay Street. But we’ve also bolstered the slate with a couple of third-party producers, which includes Various Artists and Helium Pictures.\n\n\t“We have a slate which is rich with escapism and rich with entertainment. It’s all about being thrilling but also fun. We’re going for broad, cross-generational appeal, and we have intentionally invested in content which is travelable and appeals to streamers and broadcasters alike. Because we are, to all intents and purposes, agnostic. Our job is to find the best homes for the best content.”\n\t\n\n\t‘The Neighbourhood’The formats slate is filled with new reality shows such as “The Neighbourhood.”\n\n\t“This has made a big splash, provoking lots and lots of curiosity, not least because it’s hosted by the BAFTA award-winning Graham Norton, and it’s produced by Lifted Entertainment and The Garden, who respectively brought us ‘I’m a Celebrity…,’ ‘Love Island’ and ‘Squid Game: The Challenge,’” Clark says.\n\n\t“So ‘The Neighbourhood’ is a super fun reality format, which is where six households move into this charming, purpose-built community. They live side by side, but they are competing around the clock, 24/7, for this life-changing cash prize. So, each of the households must win challenges, but they’ve also got to stay popular enough that they survive, and if they’re voted out, then they have the disadvantage of a removal van coming to their homes and they get whisked away. So, it’s big entertainment right on the doorstep. It’s instantly relatable and authentic, and obviously Graham brings that star quality to the U.K. version.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Heat”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of ITV Studios\n\t\n\n\n\n\t‘The Heat’Next up is reality format “The Heat,” produced by Twofour. The show launches on Feb. 24 on ITV2.\n\n\t“Again, there’s a lot of interest for the show already brewing from within Europe and the Americas, because it ticks a lot of boxes,” Clark says. “It’s set in a real restaurant in sun-drenched Barcelona where a group of young chefs battle it out under the supervision of a world-class Michelin chef. The chefs are working together during the day and they’re competing, but they’re also living together at night; so they’re working hard and they’re partying hard. And what that means, of course, is the kind of the stress and the ambition for winning the cooking contest meets the relationships and the night lives that go alongside of that. What you then see is the romances, the rivalries, the flirtations, the fallouts – they all make their way back into the kitchen in the daytime.\n\n\t“It’s hosted by Olivia Attwood, and the U.K. version has chef Jean-Christophe Novelli as the boss, and what you’ve got is this high-end cooking and dating show all merging together. It’s very aspirational, very glossy and escapist.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Apocalypse”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of ITV Studios\n\t\n\n\n\n\t‘Apocalypse’“Apocalypse” is produced by The Garden for Channel 4 and ITV Studios Australia for Foxtel Binge. It is described as a bold social experiment.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s a survival show, but not as we know it. It’s really all about our collective curiosity about the end of the world. So the premise is that if the worst things happen, the fight for survival won’t be in the jungle or in the desert, it’ll be in the towns and cities where we live. So when it comes to it, can we survive the end of the world?” Clark asks.\n\n\t“The idea is that 16 people will try their luck at doing just that. They must survive in an urban landscape for 28 days, where there’s no running water, there’s no heating, there’s no electricity, and of course, equally as important as the resources is, in fact, the interpersonal relationships that they form between them.\n\n\t“It’s ordinary people trying to survive an extraordinary circumstance and doing extraordinary things to achieve that. So it’s a little different, it’s funny, it’s hopeful, and it’s a really good example of how these two labels have come together to create something spectacular.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Two Weeks in August”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of ITV Studios\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSCRIPTED SHOWS‘Two Weeks in August’The scripted slate is led by the forthcoming hot drama from the award-winning producers of “I May Destroy You,” “Two Weeks in August,” produced by Various Artists Limited for BBC, in association with ITV Studios. It is written and created by Catherine Shepherd.\n\n\t“It’s a very gripping story about a group of friends who go on this fabulous two-week holiday to an idyllic Greek villa, but an impulsive kiss on the first night turns the vacation into something of a nightmare,” Clark says.\n\n\t“That’s the log line, but the reality is, it’s much more about the central character, a lady called Zoe, who’s played by Jessica Raine. She is a people pleaser. She’s a devoted wife, a mother and a carer. She always puts everybody else first, but the story is really about what happens when she puts herself first and she acts on her deepest desires, and it creates this angry self-awakening with explosive consequences.\n\n\t“So it’s really about marriage and friendships and secrets and betrayals and moral certainties that start to unravel when you challenge yourself.\n\n\t“This is smart, darkly funny and very addictive. There are parties, boat trips and wildfires, and ultimately it ends up in a full-scale survival scenario.”\n\t\n\n\t‘The Rapture’The scripted slate also includes the psychological thriller “The Rapture,” which is adapted from Liz Jensen’s bestselling novel. It is produced by Mammoth Screen for BBC.\n\n\tClark sets out the story, “The teenager Bethany, who’s played by India Amarteifio, is convicted of the most heinous crime of all, murdering her own mum, and she’s placed onto a psychiatric ward. Meanwhile, a forensic psychologist Gabs, acted by Ruth Madeley, suffers from a life-changing spinal injury in a car accident, resulting in her becoming a wheelchair user. And these two characters meet as Gabs is assigned to Bethany’s case.”\n\n\tQuestions start to be raised: Did Bethany really kill her own mom? And if she didn’t, who did? And if so, why?\n\n\t“There are other layers to the story. So, Bethany professes to see the future, and so there’s a question mark as to whether she is a manipulator, or whether there’s any truth to that. And there’s an ensuing cat-and-mouse drama that plays out between these wonderful two female leads. It’s also set against the backdrop of a climate emergency, and there’s a wider plot surrounding Bethany’s father and the connections between him and an oil company.\n\n\t“There are cliffhangers at every turn. It’s very, very enthralling. It’s full of human stories, resilience, science and faith, and winning in the face of disability, in the case of Gabs.\n\n\t“It’s bingeable. There’s a serialised urgency, but it’s also contemporary and deep.”\n\n\tThe cast also includes Sam Hazeldine, Jack Farthing, Iwan Rheon and Ruth Jones.\n\n\t‘The Dark’Also new is crime thriller “The Dark,” produced by Ben Stephenson’s Poison Pen Studios for ITV. It is based on G.R. Halliday’s hit series of Detective Inspector Monica Kennedy novels.\n\n\t“’The Dark’ is a new crime franchise in the making. It’s an iconic cat-and-mouse crime thriller. It opens with a ritualistically staged murder of a young man who’s discovered in the remote Scottish Highlands. So you can imagine the scenery of this is utterly stunning.\n\n\t“The killings that are then revealed are happening nightly. So there’s a real urgency and intensity as the detectives – Monica Kennedy, who’s played by Laura Donnelly, and her partner, who’s played by Mark Rowley, are on accelerated timings to catch the killer, all with the backdrop of these stunning crime scenes. So, you can see how this one has the legs to become a very long-standing franchise,” Clark says.\n\t\n\n\tAlso from Poison Pen Studios is “Adultery,” again for ITV, and penned by acclaimed screenwriter Danny Brocklehurst. It stars Dominic Cooper, best known for “Mamma Mia!,” and Romola Garai, who’s in the currently airing show “Betrayal,” which ITV Studios also has.\n\n\tClark says, “This is about when you meet someone, and you can’t deny the passion, and it’s even more messy when your children are dating each other. So, this is about when undeniable attraction catches you off guard, but also the enormous consequences of following that urge and that feeling, and the consequences of that for the families around you, however innocent your intent is.\n\n\t“It’s beautifully acted, and very provocative and glossy. It’s also got that multi-generational storyline. So we think this one attracts a wider demo than the standard shows, and the pace makes it a real appointment to view.”\n\n\tThe series also stars Shelley Conn and Matthew McNulty.\n\n\t‘The Killings at Parrish Station’Also new to the scripted slate is “The Killings at Parrish Station,” from Helium Pictures for STAN in Australia, a series which sees cold case crime and thriller collide, with an all-star cast including Mia Wasikowska, Heather Mitchell, Xavier Samuel, Robert Taylor and Alan Dale.\n\n\t“It’s a high-end event thriller, blending crime, conspiracy and horror, which follows a gruesome massacre of four scientists at a remote research station in 1987. These murders wrecked a lot of lives, and created a riddle as to how they came about. The story is set across two time zones: the initial murders in 1987, but then the same thing happens 37 years later. So, the same people try to figure out why that happened. It’s very novel. It’s unlike anything we’ve seen before. It’s dark, sometimes a little bit crazy, and there’s a shocking twist. It’s really captivating, and set in a very cinematic desert scenery.”\n\n\t‘Tip Toe’From the multi-award-winning screenwriter and producer Russell T. Davies, and the team behind hit series “It’s a Sin,” “Tip Toe,” from Quay Street Productions for Channel 4, is a new original drama which follows Leo and Clive who live next door to each other in Manchester. It stars Alan Cumming and David Morrissey.\n\n\tLeo runs a bar on Canal Street, Clive’s an electrician, with two teenage sons. But just as life should be settling down, the world around them is growing more tense. Words become weapons, opinions become radicalized, and gradually, two neighbors become deadly enemies.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s an urban thriller that is essentially a sequel to ‘It’s a Sin,’” Clark says. “The show is talking to some of the bigger issues in society, but done on a very specific and human level. I think Russell T. Davies naturally brings a levity and wit, but ultimately, it’s about real people with real feelings and concerns, around a very credible plot, which is about relationships and privilege and loyalty, and how those issues sit side by side.”\n\n\t‘Invisible’Also new to the slate is the action-packed drama series “Invisible,” from Scene 23 for M-Net, adapted by Amy Jephta from Deon Meyer’s novel “Blood Safari.” It stars Abbie Cornish, Dougray Scott and Tim Theron.\n\n\tIn South Africa’s Kruger National Park, a mysterious killer begins executing local poachers. As the body count rises, Inspector Jack Phatudi is drawn into a dangerous manhunt to unmask the vigilante. At the same time, Dekker – a former bodyguard with a haunted past – is hired to protect Emma, a South African expat who returns home to search for her brother who she believes is still alive, despite his disappearance 30 years ago. When Phatudi’s investigation collides with Emma and Dekker’s quest, they uncover a buried conspiracy reaching back to the political assassination of a pivotal African leader. As powerful forces close in, all three are forced to confront an explosive truth – one that could rewrite history, and that others will kill to keep hidden.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Party”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of ITV Studios\n\t\n\n\n\n\t‘The Party’“The Party,” from World Productions for ITV, is a smart, suspenseful thriller based on the bestselling novel by author Elizabeth Day, and starring Luke Evans as Martin Gilmour, a journalist shaped by his lifelong friendship with wealthy and charismatic politician Ben Fitzmaurice, played by Tom Cullen.\n\n\tRaised alone by his working-class mom, Sylvia, portrayed by BAFTA award-winning Joanna Scanlan, Martin wins a scholarship to an elite boarding school, where he first meets Ben. They forge an unbreakable bond, as Ben and the Fitzmaurice family give Martin the sense of belonging he always craved. In turn, Martin remains unflinchingly loyal to Ben and his family through even the greatest crises.\n\n\tThree decades on, Martin is invited to Ben’s lavish birthday party as news of the resignation of the leader of his political party threatens to accelerate Ben’s intention to stand and run for Prime Minister. But Martin fears the publicity that Ben’s bid would bring, dredging up the secrets of their past with tragic consequences.\n\t\n\n\tThe drama, written by and co-starring Sarah Solemani, with an ensemble cast also including Lydia Leonard, Douglas Hodge and Lindsay Duncan, moves between the shocking events of the party itself, and the police investigation that follows, with flashbacks to Martin and Ben’s past life at school, university and beyond.\n\n\tWhat unfolds is a gripping exploration of identity, privilege and devotion.\n\n\tNON-SCRIPTED SLATEThe non-scripted slate offers an exploration of the world around us with two landmark natural history series.\n\n\t“Force of Nature,” from Plimsoll Productions for ITV and ARD in Germany, formerly entitled “Extreme Earth,” is a groundbreaking series filmed over three years, revealing how nature is fighting back against today’s extreme weather. Witness the scale and ferocity of nature’s most powerful forces – from hurricanes and flash floods to droughts and bushfires – and discover the ingenious ways nature endures, adapts and prevails against these new extremes.\n\n\tThrough the eyes of heroic animal characters, the series shows how the natural world is rising to the challenge.\n\n\tAlso on the slate is “Ages of Ice,” produced by Northern Pictures for PBS and ABC Australia, which follows the scientists pushing the boundaries of exploration and human endeavor in Earth’s coldest corners to understand the changes of ice and what this means for our planet’s future. In the unforgiving grip of our planet’s polar regions, the series will follow these modern-day explorers as they try to understand how the fate of every place and every creature on our planet is tied to these frozen extremes.\n\n\tNew to the slate is “AI Confidential,” from Curious Films for BBC, about the untold stories of AI and its potential impact on the modern world.\n\n\tAs the show’s presenter, broadcaster and mathematician Prof. Hannah Fry will meet the people whose lives have been impacted by this technology in huge ways – from falling in love with an AI chatbot, to life and death decisions made by robots, to the people whose lives have been upended by Silicon Valley corporations.\n\n\tTaking a deep-dive into some of the most extraordinary human stories emerging from the world of AI, meeting key individuals whose lives have been transformed by this new technology for better or for worse, and investigating everything from “grief tech” to driverless cars, the new series will see Fry grapple with some of the most important questions of our time.\n\t\n\n\tThe slate also offers a new criminal history series, “Murder Map,” produced by Two Rivers and Soho Studios.\n\n\tStar of “Line of Duty” and “Trigger Point,” Vicky McClure and husband Jonny Owen, a filmmaker and historian, travel the U.K. exploring historic, culturally significant crimes that have changed the face of modern Britain.\n\n\tFrom unsolved murders, to miscarriages of justice or milestone cases that have changed the law, each episode features McClure and Owen doing a deep dive into each case speaking to victims’ families, experts, historians and police officers to investigate the lasting impact each murder has left on the community.\n\n\tAlso on the non-scripted slate is “Unbreakable: The Jelena Dokic Story,” from Roadshow Productions for Nine Network.\n\n\t“Unbreakable” is not just a tennis story. It’s the story of Jelena Dokic’s survival, of her overcoming extraordinary odds, and of her ultimate triumph in the face of poverty, bullying and extreme brutality. It’s about how she survived as a refugee, twice. How she survived on the tennis court as she ascended to become world No.4. But most importantly, how she survived the abuse by Damir Dokic, her violent father and coach. It’s a story of growing up – never being alone, but always lonely. Ultimately, it’s the story of how the tennis world and a nation of fans chose to look away when Jelena needed them most.\n\n\tAnd finally, hosted by the BAFTA award-winning television presenter Claudia Winkleman, is her new chat show “The Claudia Winkleman Show” from So Television for BBC.\n\n\tFrom the production company behind the hugely successful and multi award-winning “The Graham Norton Show,” each episode will see Winkleman, who is best known for co-presenting “Strictly Come Dancing” and hosting “The Traitors” in the U.K., welcome the biggest names from the worlds of film, television, music and beyond to her sofa for lively conversation with the help of a studio audience.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix threatened ByteDance with “immediate litigation” on Tuesday, joining three other studios that have condemned the company for enabling copyright infringement via its Seedance 2.0 AI service.\n\n\tNetflix sent a cease-and-desist letter demanding that the Chinese company remove its intellectual property from training datasets and establish guardrails to prevent further infringement.\n\n\n\t“Seedance acts as a high-speed piracy engine, generating mass quantities of unauthorized derivative works utilizing Netflix’s iconic characters, worlds, and scripted narratives,” wrote Mindy LeMoine, director of litigation. “Netflix will not stand by and watch ByteDance treat our valued IP as free, public domain clip art.”\n\t\n\n\tByteDance was given three days to respond. \n\n\n\tThe move followed similar steps by Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros., each of which accused the company of stealing its most valuable IP. Netflix accused ByteDance of enabling infringement of “Stranger Things,” “KPop Demon Hunters,” “Squid Game” and “Bridgerton.”\n\n\tIn the case of “Bridgerton,” the letter alleges that videos are circulating that show unauthorized depictions of costumes from Season 4 in a masquerade ball setting.\n\n\t“These outputs mirror specific, narratively important costumes like Sophie Baek’s ‘Lady in Silver’ gown,” LeMoine wrote. “ByteDance has even promoted this content using #Bridgerton tags via its own official social media channels, such as @BytePlusGlobal.”\n\n\tNetflix also cited videos that are circulating of the “Stranger Things” series finale, “which feature detailedreproductions of the iconic cast as well as the monsters from the series, including Demogorgons and the Mindflayer.”\n\t\n\n\tUsers have also created “unauthorized crossovers, such as inserting real-world figures like Elon Musk into the Squid Game environment,” the letter states. It also alleges that users have made video clips reproducing the visual style and character design of “KPop Demon Hunters,” including the lead character, Rumi.\n\n\tIn response to the furor, ByteDance said on Monday that it would impose additional guardrails to prevent unauthorized uses of copyrights and actors’ likenesses by Seedance users. Those assurances have not been enough for Warner Bros. or Netflix, both of which sent letters on Tuesday.\n\n\tThe Netflix letter was the first to explicitly threaten litigation. The letter also sought to preempt a “fair use” defense, arguing that “use of copyrighted works to create a competing commercial product, especially one that regurgitates the original, is not protected by fair use.”\n\n\tSeedance 2.0 appears to mark a significant advance over prior AI video generators, mixing video and audio relatively seamlessly using only a few prompts.\n",

    "body": "\n\tYouTube went down on Tuesday night, with more than 300,000 users experiencing technical difficulties, according to DownDetector. Problems for the digital video platform began around 5 p.m. PT, and some users saw services partially restored as early as about 6:00 p.m. PT. \n\n\t“If you’re having trouble accessing YouTube right now, you’re not alone — our teams are looking into this and will follow up here with updates,” read a post from the TeamYouTube X account, which linked to the website’s support page. \n\t\n\n\tApproximately 25 minutes later, TeamYouTube posted the following update on X: “An issue with our recommendations system prevented videos from appearing across surfaces on YouTube (including the homepage, the YouTube app, YouTube Music and YouTube Kids). The homepage is back, but we’re still working on a full fix – more coming soon!”\n\n\n\tUser complaints on DownDetector spiked at 5:21 p.m. PT and heavily tapered off by 6:06 p.m. PT. \n\n\tDuring the outage, users could still access videos through their subscriptions. However, the homepage and the suggestion bar in the video player were completely blank. The suggestion bar still seems to be down, but access to the homepage has been restored. \n\n\tThe problem occurred on both the mobile app and the desktop version of YouTube. Ads seemed unaffected by the outage when playing videos through subscription pages. \n\n\tIn online chatter about the outage, users from the United States, India, the U.K. and Argentina posted about service interruptions, suggesting the technical disruption was a global issue. \n\n\tGoogle had no further comment regarding the issue. \n",

    "description": "\n\tIndia’s Abundantia Entertainment and AI video technology company InVideo have unveiled a strategic partnership to launch an AI-driven film productio",
    "body": "\n\tIndia’s Abundantia Entertainment and AI video technology company InVideo have unveiled a strategic partnership to launch an AI-driven film production studio, backed by an investment of  INR100 crores ($11 million) — what the companies are calling the largest structured commitment to AI-driven filmmaking in India to date.\n\n\tThe deal was revealed at the India AI Film Festival, held at New Delhi’s Qutb Minar on the sidelines of the India AI Impact Summit 2026. The festival is hosted by InVideo and sponsored by Nvidia.\n\t\n\n\tUnder the partnership, the two companies will develop and produce a slate of five AI-driven films over the next three years, using the joint corpus to fund development and production. The collaboration will operate through Abundantia’s artificial intelligence-focused division, aiON, which will harness InVideo’s generative video technology to rethink how films are conceptualized, developed and produced.\n\n\n\t“AI in film-making is now real,” said Vikram Malhotra, founder and CEO of Abundantia Entertainment. “Every major leap in cinema – from sound to color to digital – has expanded storytelling possibility. AI represents the next inflection point. With Abundantia aiON, we are building a future where AI strengthens and amplifies the filmmaker’s voice, not substitutes it. Our partnership with InVideo allows us to design a future-facing creative studio that blends human imagination, authorship and intelligence to create stories that are both emotionally resonant and technologically path-breaking.”\n\n\tSanket Shah, Founder and CEO of InVideo, framed the deal as an extension of the company’s democratization mission. “Partnering with a top-notch studio like Abundantia Entertainment enables us to extend this capability into the world of high-quality filmmaking by building tools and workflows that allow creators to move from idea to cinematic expression faster and more freely than ever before. This is about accelerating and enhancing creativity, not just automating it.”\n\t\n\n\tInVideo, which counts Tiger Global and Peak XV (formerly Sequoia Capital India) among its backers, claims a user base of over 50 million across 190-plus countries and has raised more than $50 million in venture funding. The company recently revealed a collaboration with Google Cloud to develop AI-powered filmmaking tools, including enterprise-grade production pipelines aimed at studios, broadcasters, ad agencies and large production houses.\n\n\tOn the Abundantia side, the partnership builds on the studio’s aiON division, which is already in development on two AI-driven features: “Chiranjeevi Hanuman,” produced in partnership with Collective Artists Network and set for a 2026 release, and “Jai Santoshi Mata: Sukh Sampatti Daata.”\n\n\tFounded in 2013 by Malhotra, a former COO of Viacom18 Motion Pictures, Abundantia has built a track record spanning theatrical and streaming fare, including “Baby,” “Airlift,” “Toilet – Ek Prem Katha,” “Shakuntala Devi,” “Sherni,” “Jalsa,” “Ram Setu” and “Sukhee,” as well as the Amazon original series “Breathe” and its successors. The studio’s most recent release is “Daldal,” a Prime Video crime drama series starring Bhumi Pednekar.\n\n\tThe alliance is currently in the process of assembling its slate in collaboration with filmmakers, writers and visual-tech artists and engineers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn Tuesday night’s broadcast of “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert slammed his home network, CBS, for releasing a statement denying it pulled his interview with Rep. James Talarico off Monday night’s broadcast, a move he says was done without his knowledge.\n\n\t“Without ever talking to me, the corporation put out this press release,” Colbert said, presenting the statement to the audience on a sheet of paper. “This statement, it’s a surprisingly small piece of paper considering how many butts it’s trying to cover.”\n\t\n\n\tColbert then read the statement, released Tuesday by CBS, in full: “‘The Late Show’ was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico. The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled. ‘The Late Show’ decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.”\n\n\n\tHe went on to say that the statement read like it was “written by and, I’m guessing, for lawyers.” Colbert joked that since CBS’ legal team seems “intent” on telling him how to do his job, he would return the favor. \n\n\t“Fellas, I am well aware that we can book other guests,” Colbert said. “I didn’t need to be presented with that option. I’ve had Jasmine Crockett on my show twice. I could prove that to you, but the network won’t let me show you her picture without including her opponents. So I guess I’ll just have to show you this picture of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein instead.”\n\t\n\n\tColbert explained that “every word” of Monday night’s script was approved by CBS’ lawyers before the interview with Rep. Talarico was abruptly shut down. Colbert also claimed he received even more notes from the legal team during the commercial break about how he can and can’t talk about the pulled interview, something that has “never happened before” in the 11 seasons of “The Late Show.”\n\n\t“So I don’t know what this is about. For the record, I’m not even mad. I really don’t want an adversarial relationship with the network,” Colbert concluded. “As I said last night, in my interview with James Talarico — check it out, it’s on YouTube, it’s pretty good — I said to him I’m grateful to have worked at CBS for the last 11 years and worked with George [Cheeks] and David [Stapf] and Amy [Reisenbach] and everyone at the network, the Sheldons of every age, the Matlocks of every sex. I’m just so surprised that this giant global corporation would not stand up to these bullies.”\n\n\tColbert on Monday night revealed that lawyers for CBS called “The Late Show” staff and told them, “in no uncertain terms,” the interview with Rep. Talarico was not to be aired in compliance with the FCC’s “equal time” rule. The “equal time” rule states that broadcast networks must provide equal airtime to politicians from both sides of the aisle during election season. However, according to Colbert, there has “long been an exception to this rule” for talk shows like “The Late Show.”\n\n\tAlthough FCC Chair Brendan Carr has yet to eliminate the exception, Colbert pointed out that CBS is “unilaterally enforcing it as if he had.” In jest of the network’s own language as to why it canceled “The Late Show,” Colbert said the decision to shoot down the interview with Rep. Talarico was “for purely financial reasons.”\n\n\tColbert went on to give his own interpretation of what happened, “Let’s just call this what it is. Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV. He’s like a toddler with too much screen time. He gets cranky and then drops a load in his diapers. So it’s no surprise that two of the people most affected by this threat are me and my friend Jimmy Kimmel.”\n",

    "body": "On a clear night in London, some of the biggest stars and filmmakers in the U.K. attended the ninth annual pre-BAFTA Filmmakers dinner. The event, held on Tuesday at Mayfair’s Dunhill Bourdon house, the posh storefront and private club with a screening room and spa, saw a flurry of A-list celebrities decked out in their best black-tie looks.\nJason Isaacs and his wife Emma Hewitt were the toast of the night at a reception held before the VIP dinner. And “The White Lotus” actor wasn’t the only HBO veteran in attendance. In the corner of the room, one could spot as Brian Cox, the famous patriarch from “Succession;” Harry Lawtey, the actor known for making hearts flutter on “Industry;” Marisa Abela, also of “Industry”; and Fabien Frankel from “House of the Dragon.”\nOther guests included A-list directors such as Joe Wright and Nia DaCosta. Henry Golding, who has fended off James Bond casting rumors, looked the part of suave elegance — turning heads in a red velvet blazer. Tramell Tillman, the Emmy-winner actor on “Severance,” stunned in a black knee-length checkered coat.\nAt dinner, Lesley Manville was everyone’s BFF. She was seated at the same table as Jonah Hauer-King, who played Prince Eric in Disney’s live-action “The Little Mermaid,” and the British actor and writer Malachi Kirby. Emilia Jones, the star of “CODA,” rubbed shoulders with luminaries such as celebrated costume designer PC Williams and fashion designer (and Dunhill creative director) Simon Holloway.\nCEO of Dunhill Matthew Ives welcomed the room to the festivities, offering a heartfelt toast, as the guests drank and dined. Once the clock struck midnight, an after party featuring a live band kept many of these stars up on their feet late into the night.\n“Film is central to the inspiration and cultural fabric of Dunhill,” Holloway said. “There is an enduring relationship between the House and the world of cinema, from collections that are inspired by the golden age of Hollywood style to the wardrobing of contemporary films such as our work on the Steven Soderbergh-directed ‘Black Bag’ and television series such as ‘Mobland’ and ‘The Girlfriend.'”\nHe added, “Tailoring and filmmaking are meticulous crafts, grounded in the power of cut, proportion and silhouette and ultimately in service of character. It is a privilege to deepen that connection through our partnership with BAFTA to help shape the future of British screen culture.”\nDunhill and BAFTA also partner on the BAFTA Elevate program, an initiative focused on documentary and factual filmmaking that nurtures talent at the start of their careers and encourages broader representation across the industry.\nSee all the photos from the event below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFinn Bennett, Kharmel Cochrane, Jonah Hauer-King\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Greg Williams\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFinn Bennett, Kharmel Cochrane and Jonah Hauer-King at Dunhill’s Pre-BAFTA Filmmakers Dinner.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSimon Holloway, Robert Aramayo, Malachi Kirby\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Greg Williams\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSimon Holloway, Robert Aramayo, Malachi Kirby at Dunhill’s Pre-BAFTA Filmmakers Dinner.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMarisa Abela, Akinola Davies Jr, P.C.

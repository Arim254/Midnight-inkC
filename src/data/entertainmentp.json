    "body": "\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\tNov 19, 2025 12:05pm PT\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\tOscar Predictions: Original Score — A Heavyweight Showdown Ahead for Ludwig Göransson, Jonny Greenwood and Max Richter?\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\tVariety Awards Circuit section is the home for all awards news and related content throughout the year, featuring the following: the official predictions for the upcoming Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and Tony Awards ceremonies, curated by Variety chief awards editor Clayton Davis. The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSINNERS, Jack O’Connell, 2025. © Warner Bros. / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett C\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Original Score Commentary (Updated Nov. 19, 2025): An unusually diverse field of composers and contenders spans experimental soundscapes, franchise blockbusters and intimate character studies in this year’s original score race.\n\n\tLeading the early conversation is Ludwig Göransson with “Sinners,” his latest collaboration with director Ryan Coogler. The two-time Oscar winner (for “Black Panther” and “Oppenheimer”) continues his hot streak and could be a future hat-trick victor.\n\n\tPerhaps the most intriguing storyline of the season involves Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, a two-time nominee who has yet to win despite acclaimed scores for “Phantom Thread” (2017) and “The Power of the Dog” (2021). His latest orchestrations on Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” could finally be his breakthrough moment.\n\n\tAlso generating significant buzz on the circuit is Max Richter’s work on “Hamnet,” Chloé Zhao’s moving period drama. Richter, who is angling for his first serious Oscar bid, brings his signature neoclassical style to the Shakespeare-adjacent story.\n\n\tThe veteran contingent is well-represented. Two-time Oscar winner Alexandre Desplat returns with “Frankenstein” for Guillermo del Toro, while Oscar winner Hildur Guðnadóttir (“Joker”) offers “Hedda” for Nia DaCosta’s evocative drama. Two-time winner Hans Zimmer could also make a last-minute push with “F1.”\n\n\tVolker Bertelmann, who won for “All Quiet on the Western Front,” has two Netflix entries: “Ballad of a Small Player” from Edward Berger and “A House of Dynamite” from Kathryn Bigelow. Three-time nominee Nicholas Britell contributes to the crowd-pleasing energy of “Jay Kelly” and remains deeply respected within the branch.\n\n\tComing off his win for “The Brutalist” last year, Daniel Blumberg’s experimental textures for “The Testament of Ann Lee” will surely be considered, alongside Jerskin Fendrix’s avant-garde sensibilities on “Bugonia,” his latest collaboration with Yorgos Lanthimos.\n\n\tFranchise films are also in the mix, with Simon Franglen returning to Pandora for “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” while Oscar winner Michael Giacchino brings muscular summer-blockbuster energy to “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” for Marvel Studios.\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” presents an interesting case, with John Powell and Stephen Schwartz collaborating on the musical continuation. The duo earned recognition last year — the question now is whether voters will go for it again.\n\n\tNotable absences from eligibility (so far) include “Superman,” scored by John Murphy and David Fleming, and “After the Hunt” by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, both of which failed to meet specific branch requirements.\n\n\tThe Academy’s rules demand that scores comprise at least 35% of a film’s total music and be created specifically for the picture. For franchise films, no more than 20% of pre-existing themes may be reused.\n\n\tThe preliminary voting period runs Dec. 8-12, with the shortlist announcement set for Dec. 16. Final nominations voting occurs Jan. 12-16, followed by the nominations announcement on Jan. 22.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited artisans are subject to change.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Searchlight\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©MGM/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Composers (Original Score)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\tIt’s Sunday, the final day of BravoCon, and inside a cavernous space within Caesars Forum in Las Vegas, Frances Berwick, chairman of Bravo and Peacock Unscripted, appears thrilled by the controlled chaos that’s unfolded here.\n\n\t“‘Joy’ is a bit overused this weekend, but I think it makes people happy, and it brings people together,” Berwick says of Bravo fans’ attachment to the network. “When you look around these halls, there are all these people who are making new friends based on this shared passion.”\n\n\tDespite torrential rains the day before, and street closures for the upcoming Formula 1 race causing the always-snarled Strip to be borderline inaccessible, the event has been a huge (and profitable) success. At the sold-out conference, now in its fourth iteration, 30,000 Bravo faithful have come from all over the world to take in roughly 50 panels and live events featuring more than 160 “Bravolebrities,” along with nightly tapings of “BravoCon Live With Andy Cohen” at Planet Hollywood, which will air this week. Amid 20 corporate sponsors (Lexus, T-Mobile, Hilton, Carnival Cruise Lines and more), attendees (“Bravoholics,” to use the term of art) have had a blast, buying merch and other wares at the Bravo Bazaar, mingling with talent — and paying to take selfies with them all weekend.\n\n\tAnd it’s safe to say there’s been some drinking. One wasted-seeming woman at Cohen’s “Ask Andy” panel Sunday morning inquired about his penis size … it was 10:45 a.m. Bravoholics came here to party, to whoop it up. And why not? If shows like “The Real Housewives” were once “secret, shared guilty pleasures,” as Berwick puts it, now “people are very overt about it.” Because, she asks rhetorically, “why would you feel guilty about it?”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Charles Sykes/Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA year ago this week, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts announced that the company would be spinning off NBCUniversal’s cable channels into a new company — all except for Bravo, which would stick with the mothership. That’s how vital it is as a feeder into NBCU’s streamer, Peacock. At the time, Berwick, who joined Bravo in 1996, oversaw unscripted across channels like E! and Oxygen, but now she’s hyperfocused on Bravo and Peacock.\n\n\n\t“It was a statement,” Berwick says of Roberts’ decision to keep Bravo in-house, “about how valuable Bravo is to the overall ecosystem, and also how successful it has been on Peacock.” Bravo shows stream on Peacock the day after they premiere on the network, and it’s a mutually beneficial relationship — and a powerful symbiosis. As Peacock’s culturally dominant “Love Island” was streaming nightly last summer (drawing 18.4 billion minutes for Season 7, according to Peacock data), its extraordinarily young audience (50% of its viewers are under 30) also began watching Bravo series “The Valley” and “Next Gen NYC.”\n\n\tBerwick has been out and about all weekend, both an approachable presence in the press room and watching as many panels as she can. She’s also tried to meet most, if not all, of the 160-plus reality stars who trekked to Las Vegas to be here. “It’s probably an exhausting weekend,” Berwick says. “But I think it really is quite rewarding.” And, she adds, “they also like interacting with each other — there is a shared experience.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCaroline Stanbury, Reza Farahan, Shereé Whitfield, Larsa Pippen at Caesars Forum \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Casey Durkin/Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBravoCon is “enormously expensive to put on,” Berwick says. But with corporate sponsorships bringing in the lion’s share of the revenue and the ticket fees contributing — without add-ons for the nighttime events, a three-day general admission pass cost $672.61 without tax, and a three-day VIP pass cost $1,463.52 without tax — it is a profitable enterprise. It’s also a marketing extravaganza, with an accompanying explosion of press around the shows and their stars, especially with the “Real Housewives” franchise celebrating its 20th anniversary next year. But as she surveys the increasingly bleak media landscape, Berwick sees an even more important benefit from the gathering: It allows her to gain insights from the fans. “We want Bravo to live on into the future, in a sea of dying television brands,” she says. “This should run and run, and really be successful.”\n\t\n\n\tBravoCon aspires to be what Bravo shows so often embody — “escapism, the passion, the loyalty, the community,” Berwick adds. “It’s just really fun.”\n\n\tSpeaking in her calming British accent, Berwick discussed all things Bravo with Variety, including how the network plans to celebrate “Real Housewives” turning 20, why she thinks “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” is firing on all cylinders, which former Bravo stars might be welcomed back to the network — and who probably won’t be.    \n\t\n\t\n\t\tDo you even look at linear ratings anymore?\t\n\n\tWe tend to look much more at our total audience delivery, which requires a lot more patience. I’m not going to lie to you, I still look at the live-same linear numbers, and that probably won’t change for a while. And those are still meaningful numbers in terms of overall reach. But increasingly, you have to get very comfortable with waiting seven days so we actually start getting a full picture. And then the longer tail, especially on Bravo shows, is really sizeable.\n\t\n\t\tThe number of subscribers for Peacock has been stuck this year at 41 million. How much is unscripted part of Peacock’s growth potential?\t\n\n\tWe’re thinking about growth in two ways. One is, obviously, new subscribers. The other one, which is as important, is engagement. And Bravo viewers, they are the most loyal, both in terms of their consumption on linear and as the most loyal viewers on Peacock. So they have great lifetime value. They watch lots of Bravo shows, and they watch lots of other content too. So they are some of the most valuable subscribers that we have for Peacock.\n\t\n\t\tIs it safe to say that you’ve concluded that docusoaps aren’t what Peacock originals should be? Like, “McBee Dynasty” migrated to Bravo, and the new “Ultimate Girls Trip” is going to be on Bravo. Is Peacock for competition shows?\t\n\n\tNot entirely. We’ve actually had a lot of success with specific types of follow docs on Peacock. “Nelly & Ashanti,” which we launched this summer, did incredibly well. We just launched “Tiffany Haddish Goes Off.”\n\n\tBravo IP, though, should start on Bravo — there’s no reason for it not to. And so when we just announced our celebration for the 20 years of “Real Housewives,” with “Real Housewives: The Ultimate Road Trip,” we’ll start it on Bravo.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Kim Nunneley/Peacock\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDo you want to throw some “Love Island” stats at me that will shock me? Someone told me an astounding number of the viewership watches it on their phones — as an old person, I was like, what?\t\n\n\tAround 30% for the consumption of ‘Love Island’ was on mobile — phones, tablets, whatever. So that’s already a very high statistic. The other great stat is 50% of the audience for “Love Island” was 30 or under. I’m actually more surprised that 50% of the audience for” “Love Island” is over 30. Which I think speaks to that it’s a huge show that sucks people in, and it’s great storytelling, and you get fully engaged, and it becomes this destination. There’s something for everyone. It’s broader than you think the appeal would be.\n\t\n\t\tAnd why do you think that “Love Island USA” exploded two summers ago? What are the lessons you take from that?\t\n\n\tI mean, the franchise is huge globally. CBS took a shot on it, but they’re not the right audience for it. So it needed to come to streaming with a much younger and broader audience. But also we really lent into figuring out great casting. It’s not easy. The first season of “Love Island” on Peacock, we were still very much in COVID. It’s hard to cast these shows when you’re doing it remotely. I think the casting was great for Seasons 6 and 7.\n\n\tAdding Ariana Madix to the mix — she’s so empathetic and relatable, and already known, and obviously had a following from the Bravo viewership — who then followed her into that, then got sucked in. And then I think that we’ve done a really good job in terms of getting the social word out.\n\t\n\t\tWhat are the biggest challenges in the year 2025 to create new hits?\t\n\n\tI think it’s getting the word out. You can create really great content, but then connecting it to the audience and getting that awareness is absolutely critical. And you have to pull every single lever across multiple marketing tactics — communications, press, everything. That is one of the secrets of Bravo. There’s a lot of social support, and the fans evangelizing for you. That really is incredibly potent.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJesse McBee, Steven McBee Jr.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Paul Andrews/Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWith something like “McBee Dynasty,” which seems like it was like a word-of-mouth hit — that’s so not a Bravo show? But it worked.\t\n\n\tFor years, we were very singularly focused on particular type of show and a particular type of cast. And what we’ve actually learned is our audience has very broad tastes, and we were not really serving a piece of the audience. We did the first season of “McBee” for Peacock. But what we actually saw was the key ingredients of Bravo shows were all there — the immersive, addictive storytelling. We lent more in Season 2 into the female characters, who are great, as well as our three male leads. And it has resonated, but it’s also brought in a broader audience.\n\n\tHistorically, we’ve lent into stories that were more aspirational. But there’s lots of different levels of aspiration, and as long as there’s a relatability and there’s drama and humor and all the ingredients of a Bravo show, then it will work. We’re very happy to have them here — yes, they stand out because they’re wearing cowboy hats. But they actually feel like they fit.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHulu is really getting into the reality game. How much do you see them as a competitor?\t\n\n\tWell, I think there’s obviously room for lots of different types of programming. I think that we have honed what we do, and we’ll keep honing it and broadening it. There’s place for everyone. But I’m very happy with where we are, and how we’re building our audience.  \n\n\tI don’t see Hulu doing an event like this, and of this scale where you’ve got 30,000 people across three days, and there’s this intense passion and knowledge. Obviously, I feel like I know the ins and outs, and sometimes I’m blown away by how much people know — the historic knowledge, and the fact that they’ve lived with these people and these brands, and they really consider them friends. There’s certainly no other unscripted brand that is in that category.\n\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of former talent, the “Sweet Home Oklahoma” ladies are now the #Resistance!\t\n\n\tWho I still love — yes! I will say they come up in conversation: Pumps and Jennifer. Yes, they’re great.\n\t\n\t\tWould you ever consider bringing them back onto the network?\t\n\n\tWouldn’t rule anything out. \n\t\n\t\tThe last time we were sitting here, two years ago, the so-called “reality reckoning” was top of mind. Now that it’s not a constant barrage of lawsuits and threats of lawsuits, can you reflect on how much it affected decision-making at Bravo?\t\n\n\n\tI don’t think it affected decision-making, honestly. We’ve kept on doing what we do. And as I’ve said before, I think there were certain things that we were changing anyway, about our production protocols, and we’ve continued to do that. We want to make sure that our sets are absolutely in line with our values, and so we’ve continued to press ahead with that. But we were doing that anyway. There’s not been any sort of sea change as a result.\n\t\n\t\tBut are there any good things that came out of the concerns that were raised?\t\n\n\tThere were things that we were doing anyway. We want to make sure that we have our cast and our production crews’ well-being top of mind. We’re very focused on things like alcohol consumption. And that goes for all of our productions. There’s a reason there’s a two-drink maximum on shows like “Love Island.” I would not attribute that to any outside force. That came from within our organization. And that’s about evolving generally.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Casey Durkin/Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAt Andy Cohen’s “Ask Andy” panel — the person was talking about Season 2 of “The Valley” — someone asked how dark is too dark. How much do you think about that?\t\n\n\tI will say we think about it. We’re an escapist brand. When viewers come to us, they’re like, “I want to escape — but I also want to relate.” But we follow people’s real lives, and we are as authentic as we possibly can be. We’re not overly producing situations. We are following people, fly on the wall style. And sometimes, things happen; life happens.\n\n\tI’m not gonna lie, I thought this season of “The Valley” — it was pretty dark. But that was following people’s real lives, and I have to say, and I’ve heard feedback this week — and I’m sure the cast members of “The Valley” have heard it — from a number of people who felt deeply moved because there were cast members going through things that were similar to their journey’s and difficulties. I think that’s really powerful.\n\n\tBut overly, yes, we want to balance the light and the dark and the fun.\n\t\n\t\tWhat did you learn from trying to reshape “The Real Housewives of New York City”? There was a legacy series that never came together, and an entire reboot that people didn’t love as much as the original show.\t\n\n\n\tThe legacy thing, it did come together — we did the “Ultimate Girls Trip,” which was always meant to be a single season.\n\t\n\n\n\tIn terms of the learnings on the reboot of “New York,” you know when you watch Olympic skating and somebody falls, and then it suddenly makes you realize that what they are doing is incredibly difficult? We don’t always nail a cast — sometimes you get a cast like “Salt Lake City” that has this magical alchemy. But we don’t always get it right. I thought the first season of the reboot of “Housewives” of New York was actually great.\n\n\tWe don’t need to rehash, but we didn’t love where we came out with the second one. And that’s why we’re being really thoughtful about how we bring that back. But it’s an important city.\n\t\n\t\tIt’s the most important city, and I say that as a Los Angeles resident.\t\n\n\n\tWe’re very thoughtful about our casting generally, including when we add new people into the mix. They need to be organically connected. We’re trying to represent new stories and different life stages and different things that people are going through, and bring in the right mix of people who get along and who are very vulnerable and who will be authentic. And not be self-conscious on camera or have an agenda, or be doing it overtly to build a business, or for clout. So there are lots of different factors, and I think we were pretty thoughtful about how we approached “Atlanta” too.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t Mary M. Cosby\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Natalie Cass/Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou mentioned “Salt Lake City,” which is riding high this weekend. The applause that those women get is beyond any other cast. What is it about that show that’s working so well?\t\n\n\tThey have really interesting stories to tell. They all have incredibly different types of backgrounds, and different types of experience. You think about Bronwyn’s life story compared to Heather’s backstory — completely different, although both were Mormons, and both have experienced different elements of that. You think about Lisa’s background, building her businesses, and the success of doing that, and living a different type of lifestyle.\n\n\tThey are all prepared to be vulnerable, and to show their lives. And they all have great senses of humor as well.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAnd they’re able to get over things that would destroy me if someone said them to me. They wake up the next day, and are, like, “Hey!”\t\n\n\tActually, I do think that’s a key ingredient. The thing that we say to all our talent when they first start is, “You’re gonna have to be really thick-skinned: Don’t go down the internet rabbit hole.”\n\n\tI’m not saying that these women don’t, but I do think that they’re self-possessed enough, and they have enough of their own identity, that they are able to be very forceful in the way they express their opinions, and they feel strongly.\n\n\t\n\t\tI wanted to ask about gradations of criminal behavior, as well as what is forgivable and what isn’t. We saw Karen Huger be get a standing ovation the other night, and she’s sitting down with Andy in the “Real Housewives of Potomac” finale after being released from prison for her fourth DUI. What makes something forgivable within the Bravo universe?\t\n\n\tIt’s a variety of things, and it’s also about the level of accountability, the level of change that that person is going to make. The audience is with Karen, because they’re rooting for her, because they think and believe that this will profoundly change her. I took the standing ovation as a sign of support for somebody who’s now taken accountability. That’s borne out by what she says to Andy. And then I think that there are things that are less forgivable. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWill Karen be on Season 11 of “The Real Housewives of Potomac?” \t\n\n\tI couldn’t tell you, because we haven’t picked that one up. \n\t\n\t\tWhen it’s picked up, I’ll ask. Jen Shah — is that one that’s less forgivable?\t\n\n\tFor me personally, yeah. But you know, again, I have no idea on the level of accountability. But yes.\n\t\n\t\tThis isn’t criminal, of course, but is there a road back to “Atlanta” for Kenya Moore after what she did in Season 16?\t\n\n\tI would say so, but I don’t know. Yeah, I would not rule it out.\n\t\n\t\tHow about Nene Leakes? Is there ever a way back for Nene between Bravo and Andy Cohen?\t\n\n\tWe’ve had Nene on red carpet shows for E! — we have worked with Nene since then.\n\t\n\t\tCould she ever be on a show again, do you think? \t\n\n\tYes, she can be on a show again. \n\t\n\t\tHere at BravoCon, there are people like Teresa Giudice and Countess Luann who are in the Bravo firmament, even when they’re not on shows. Is there an extended Bravo Universe?\t\n\n\tI see it as a bit of a family, and we’re not closing the door on anyone. We want to maintain that relationship, and we feel that they’re firmly within the Bravo family, and we’ll look for opportunities where they can come back.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAndy Cohen, Vicki Gunvalson\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Charles Sykes/Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThis is 20th anniversary of “The Real Housewives.” Andy announced the “Road Trip” series, Vicki Gunvalson’s coming back for Season 20. What other kinds of celebrations can viewers expect next year?\t\n\n\tYes, who would have thought? Doing the “Road Trip,” that’s a big celebration, but we will definitely be marking it. Let’s just say the audience will be very aware that it is the 20th anniversary of “Real Housewives,” with many celebrations around that. I’m excited that in our 20th year of “Real Housewives,” we’re introducing a brand new cast with “Rhode Island,” so that will feed into it. \n\t\n\t\tThere’s no entertainment company that inspires the kind of love for the brand that Bravo does. People are very attached to the Disney brand, but it’s different.\t\n\n\t“Joy” is bit overused this weekend, but I think it makes people happy, and it brings people together. It used to be the secret, shared guilty pleasure — and now I think that people are very overt about it: Why would you feel guilty about it? When you look around these halls, there are all these people who are making new friends based on this shared passion. \n\n\tAnd we listen to them, I will say. At the end of each season, we do pretty deep consumer insights, and we ask for a lot of feedback on what they thought worked, didn’t work. Sometimes we can control those things. Sometimes we can’t because it’s real people.\n\t\n\t\tI’m sure this is extremely expensive to stage, BravoCon. Is it profitable?\t\n\n\tIt is a business revenue driver, but it is enormously expensive to put on. So yes, there is some profit, but I would say the bigger piece of this equation is building a fan base and building engagement. And how we make this brand. We want Bravo to live on into the future, in a sea of dying television brands. This should run and run, and really be successful.\n\n\tAnd so it’s about engaging our audience and connecting with them, and then also getting enough insights to help us figure out, what does that look like in five years’ time? \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDorinda Medley, Alexia Nepola \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Charles Sykes/Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAre there appearance fees for talent to appear at BravoCon?\t\n\n\tYes.\n\t\n\t\tIs it based on seniority, the way salaries are?\t\n\n\tNo.\n\t\n\t\tIs it flat?\t\n\n\tIt’s more or less flat, but based on how much we’re expecting them to do. But it’s pretty flat. Nobody’s getting rich on their BravoCon appearance fees. We want to make sure that it’s a good experience for the talent, too. And I think every everyone I’ve spoken to — which is maybe almost all of them that I managed to get to — they all really appreciate it. I’m not going to sugarcoat it, it’s probably an exhausting weekend, because they’re taking a lot of photos, they’re interacting with a lot of people, and they’re doing lots of panels and things. But I think it really is quite rewarding.\n\t\n\t\tIt’s Sunday, and they’re all still in that press room on that carpet.\t\n\n\tThey also like interacting with each other. There is a shared experience. It’s clearly a weird experience to be on a reality show, and it’s not for everyone, and so they do have that common experience of understanding that. I think it’s also quite helpful for some of the more rookie ones to hear some of that experience from some of the ones who’ve been around.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou mentioned dying cable channels. What advice would you give any cable executive in a linear cable environment these days?\t\n\n\tYou have to keep investing in original content. And even if you accept that not all the monetization is going to come from the linear exposure, there’s going to be a streaming life. You have to keep investing — if not, ultimately, you’re not going to end up with anything.\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat does BravoCon teach you about Bravo?\t\n\n\tIt teaches us about the enduring power of the brand. It just underscores all the brand attributes that we’re trying to maintain: the escapism, the passion, the loyalty, the community. And the fact that it’s just really fun. It’s fun and colorful — people get dressed up.\n\n\tAnd that the audience is there. They are really there, and they feel very strongly, and they want to share their opinions. I mean, they will let us know, including in the panel rooms, when they like something. And when they don’t like something.\n\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.

    "body": "\n\t“Heated Rivalry,” an upcoming Canadian hockey romance series from Bell Media, has scored a slew of international sales ahead of its Nov. 28 premiere on streamer Crave.\n\n\tSphere Abacus has sold the six-episode Crave Original show to HBO Max in the U.S. and Australia, where it will also premiere on Nov. 28, as well as to Sky in New Zealand for a Nov. 30 debut and MoviStar Plus+ in Spain, with a release date to be announced.\n\n\n\tCreated by “Letterkenny” writer-director-producer Jacob Tierney and based on Rachel Reid’s bestselling book series “Game Changers,” “Heated Rivalry” tells the love story of rival hockey players Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie). The cast also includes François Arnaud, Robbie G.K., Christina Chang, Dylan Walsh, Sophie Nélisse and Ksenia Daniela Kharlamova.\n\t\n\n\t“Shane and Ilya are two of the biggest stars in major league hockey, bound by ambition, rivalry and a magnetic pull neither of them fully understands,” the show’s synopsis reads. “What begins as a secret fling between two fresh-faced rookies evolves into a years-long journey of love, denial and self-discovery. Over the next eight years, the pair chase glory on the ice while struggling to navigate their feelings off it. Torn between the sport they live for and the love they can’t ignore, Shane and Ilya must decide if there is room in their fiercely competitive world for something as fragile and as powerful as real love.”\n\n\tThe international sales of “Heated Rivalry” follow Bell Media’s acquisition of a majority stake in Sphere Abacus earlier this year, positioning it as the primary international distributor of Bell Media’s distribution rights.\n\t\n\n\t“’Heated Rivalry’ is premium, high-caliber content that resonates with global audiences,” said Justin Stockman, vice president of content development and programming at Bell Media. “These international sales are a testament to Accent Aigu Entertainment’s vision for Rachel Reid’s story and underscore the strength of our partnership with Sphere Abacus, and our shared commitment to bringing compelling, buzzworthy content to viewers worldwide.”\n\n\tAdded Jonathan Ford, managing director of Sphere Abacus: “With strong performances from its lead actors, ‘Heated Rivalry’ delivers a powerful and unique narrative which our clients in all parts of the world are keen to share with their viewers. We’re very excited about additional international sales prospects for this engaging series in the weeks to come.”\n\n\tBell Media president Sean Cohan said the company’s ambition has long been to “create exceptional content that travels globally,” and “Heated Rivalry’s” sales are “another validation of that vision.”\n\n\tHe continued, “Jonathan Ford and the team at Sphere Abacus have been great partners in this journey, helping us bring our series to engaged audiences around the world… we are just getting started.”\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” is produced by Accent Aigu Entertainment in association with Bell Media’s Crave. Tierney serves as writer, director, producer and executive producer. Brendan Brady is producer and executive producer. Lori Fischburg is producer and Reid is consulting producer. For Bell Media, Alison Korogyi is senior production executive, original programming; Sarah Fowlie is head of production, original programming; Adam Feigen is development executive, scripted original programming; Rachel Goldstein-Couto is head of development, original programming; Brian Blazik is head of Bell Media sales, Sphere Abacus; Carlyn Klebuc is general manager, original programming; and Stockman is vice president, content development and programming.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe creators of true-crime hit podcast “Anatomy of Murder” have sued Audiochuck, the company founded by Ashley Flowers, alleging they weren’t paid “millions of dollars” they were owed under Audiochuck’s ad deal with SiriusXM.\n\n\tAnna-Sigga Nicolazzi and Scott Weinberger, hosts and creators of “Anatomy of Murder,” allege in their lawsuit that Audiochuck breached its contract by failing to pay them their “rightful share of Defendant’s exclusive advertising revenue deal with SiriusXM, an amount equating to millions of dollars. The SiriusXM deal has benefited Defendant greatly, but Plaintiffs have never seen that benefit, and instead have been subject to all of the downside in the form of decreased revenue and restrictions on other forms of monetization.”\n\t\n\n\tNicolazzi and Weinberger also allege that Audiochuck breached the “implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,” which accompanies contracts in New York. During the negotiation and execution of the parties’ contract extension in October 2024, Audiochuck did not disclose that it was also renegotiating its agreement with SiriusXM (taking effect in January 2025), and “then withheld material terms of that renegotiated deal which significantly reduced the Plaintiffs’ revenue below the increased share they bargained for,” according to the lawsuit.\n\n\n\t“This case involves creators being repeatedly taken advantage of by a large media company,” the lawsuit says.\n\n\tNicolazzi and Weinberger’s contract with Audiochuck runs until the end of 2025 and the duo are producing new weekly episodes of “Anatomy of Murder” through December. But the future of the show is uncertain after that.\n\t\n\n\tThe lawsuit was filed Nov. 13 in the U.S. District Court Southern District of New York, with Nicolazzi’s Forseti Media and Weinberger’s Weinberger Media listed as plaintiffs. A redacted version of the complaint was unsealed Wednesday by the court. The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages.\n\n\tVariety has reached out to Audiochuck for comment.\n\n\tIn their lawsuit, the “Anatomy of Murder” creators cite reports that Audiochuck’s deal with SiriusXM was worth as much as $200 million. If that’s true, if Nicolazzi and Weinberger’s podcast was even 10% of the overall valuation, “its proportional share of the SiriusXM Deal would have been $20 Million,” the suit says.\n\n\tAudiochuck originally its exclusive ad-sales and distribution deal with SiriusXM in 2021 and that runs through 2025. Now Audiochuck is exiting the SiriusXM deal under a new $150 million pact with Fox Corp.’s Tubi Media Group, which includes the development of a “Crime Junkie” FAST channel to be distributed across Tubi and the Fox One subscription service.\n\n\tEarlier this year, Audiochuck received $40 million in funding from Peter Chernin’s The Chernin Group, the first outside capital for Audiochuck, which valued the Indianapolis-based company at about $250 million. Flowers controls and owns a majority of Audiochuck, and TCG owns a minority share.\n\n\tIn April 2020, Nicolazzi and Weinberger entered into a revenue-share agreement with Audiochuck, under which the duo would develop, produce and host the podcast and Audiochuck would handle distribution, promotion, marketing and advertising services. “Anatomy of Murder” debuted in October 2020 at the No. 1 spot on Apple Podcasts. “Plaintiffs credit Defendant for a large-scale launch which helped to push the Podcast to the top of the charts, particularly the promotion on Ms. Flowers’ podcast, Crime Junkie, and other cross-promotion, which more quickly introduced listeners to the show,” the lawsuit says. To date, Nicolazzi and Weinberger have released more than 250 episodes of “Anatomy of Murder,” which is approaching 200 million downloads.\n\n\tAccording to the lawsuit, Nicolazzi is a career homicide prosecutor with 21 years of experience at the Brooklyn District Attorney’s office, with 16 of those years in the office’s homicide bureau, where she last served as chief of trials. She is also host and co-executive producer of “True Conviction,” which ran for four seasons on Investigation Discovery and executive producer and host of Wolf Entertainment’s “Law & Order: Criminal Justice System” podcast, currently finishing its second season.\n\t\n\n\tWeinberger spent nearly a decade in law enforcement in Florida, before embarking on a career in media focused on crime. He is a three-time Emmy-award winning investigative journalist, previously at WNBC-TV and WCBS-TV in New York, and is currently CEO and executive producer at Weinberger Media, which he founded in 2007. Weinberger is creator of “On the Case with Paula Zahn,” now in its 28th season on Investigation Discovery and producer of the network’s “True Conviction.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA religious school in England is currently making headlines for banning its students from singing the original songs from Netflix‘s animated blockbuster “KPop Demon Hunters.” As reported by the BBC, the school had concerns over certain song lyrics not being in line with its “Christian ethos.”\n\n\t“Lilliput Church of England Infant School in Poole, Dorset sent a message to parents on Friday saying some members of the community are ‘deeply uncomfortable’ with references to demons,” the BBC wrote. “It said this was because they ‘associate them with spiritual forces opposed to God and goodness.’ In an update on Monday, acting head teacher Lloyd Allington said he had since received feedback from parents, highlighting positive messages from the songs, but said the school was seeking to support those who found the themes ‘challenging.'”\n\t\n\n\tThe school originally asked students “not to sing these songs at school out of respect for those who find the themes at odds with their faith,” but it soon found backlash from some parents. One parent told the BBC: “I thought it was ridiculous. My daughter is very into K-pop and her and all of her little friends love it.”\n\n\n\tOther parents notified the school that popular “KPop Demon Hunters” songs like the Grammy-nominated smash hit “Golden” had positive effects on their children, such as teaching them to build teamwork.\n\n\t“While we fully respect your right to make choices about the content your child engages with at home, we also want to be mindful of the diversity of beliefs within our school community,” head teacher Lloyd Allington responded. “For some Christians, references to demons can feel deeply uncomfortable because they associate them with spiritual forces opposed to God and goodness. We are not asking parents to tell their children that there is anything wrong with enjoying the film or its songs if it aligns with your own views and beliefs. Our role will simply be to help children understand that some of their peers may hold different views and to explore how we can respect and support those peers in upholding their faith.”\n\t\n\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters,” which debuted in June on Netflix, has gone on to become the streamer’s most-watched movie of all time, with more than 325 million views and counting. Three of its original songs — “Golden,” “Your Idol” and “Soda Pop” — were mainstays on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart for weeks, with “Golden” topping the charts and earning a Grammy nomination for song of the year.\n\n\tVariety reported earlier this month that Netflix and Sony have finalized a deal for a “KPop Demon Hunters” sequel, with plans to release the movie in 2029. Franchise co-director Maggie Kang, who helmed the film with Chris Appelhans, had long expressed her desire for a sequel.\n\n\t“We’ve set up so much for potential backstory,” Kang told Variety in July. “Obviously, there’s a lot of questions that are left unanswered and areas that are not explored. We had to do that because there’s only so much movie you could tell in 85 minutes.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMaria Zuckerman has set a first-look producing deal with Fox Entertainment Studios, Variety has learned. \n\n\tUnder the deal, Zuckerman will develop scripted series and films as well as non-fiction projects including documentaries and both limited and ongoing series. \n\n\t“Maria is one of the industry’s most dynamic creative forces — a producer with vision, discipline, impeccable instincts, and the deep talent relationships needed to bring exceptional stories to life,” said Hannah Pillemer, head of scripted at Fox Entertainment Studios. “She has a remarkable track record for identifying great storytellers and creating content that makes noise and shapes culture, which is exactly why she’s an ideal partner as we continue to expand Fox’s creative footprint.”\n\t\n\n\tZuckerman’s past credits include the Emmy-winning HBO documentary series “100 Foot Wave” and acclaimed features like the Oscar-nominated “Spencer,” the Emmy-winning feature “Grey Gardens,” “Nanny,” “Theater Camp,” and “The Mauritanian.” In her career, she has collaborated with filmmakers such as Peter Morgan, Richard Curtis, Spike Lee, Stephen Frears, and David Yates. \n\n\n\t“Fox Entertainment Studios has a clear and ambitious vision for the future of storytelling,” said Zuckerman. “I’m thrilled to partner with Hannah and her team on premium, high-impact projects across formats that combine bold creative vision with broad audience appeal — and to do so in collaboration with a globally-minded studio that values both artistry and agility.”\n\n\tZuckerman was previously the president of Topic Studios, a role she exited in 2022. Prior to that, she spent nearly 20 years at HBO, last holding the title of senior vice president of HBO Films. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMegan Moroney is going into the 2025 CMA Awards tied with a leading six nominations, and that is a numeral that’s working for her, since she will be using the telecast to perform “6 Months Later,” the leadoff single from the album she’s promised for early next year. \n\n\tThe country star discussed that single; another one that has just been released, “Beautiful Things”; and the impending third album they’re taken from, “Cloud 9”; and that record’s marked change in color-coding when she stopped by the 2025 Variety CMA Awards Interview Lounge, as the inaugural guest for the video series. The lounge is presented by Duke Cannon and took over Nashville’s hot Anzie Blue space.\n\t\n\n\tMoroney took home new artist of the year in 2024, but has a shot at a greater haul for 2025. The six nods, in any case, already stand as a sort of official coronation by the industry in her still-young career.\n\n\t“I’m so excited for this year’s awards,” Moroney told the Variety Lounge’s cameras. “It feels different this time because I got my first album of the year nomination [for “Am I Okay?,” her sophomore release]. I think I’m most excited about that and song of the year because I think those nominations also highlight my collaborators that I work with. My producer gets recognized for that along with my co-writers, and I know that I wouldn’t be here without them, so it feels like a big celebration for the whole team.”\n\n\tHer performance of “6 Months Later” on the ABC telecast (which will be available starting the next day on Hulu) will mark a transition from her “blue” period — the unofficial color of “Am I Okay?” — tp a different shade of OK.\n\t\n\n\t“It”s gonna be kind of a mini-reflection of the music video. We’re kind of recreating that as best we can in about three minutes in one set, but it’s gonna be a lot of fun. Maybe some outfit changes. It’s very, very pink,” she warned.\n\n\t“Surprise — the album’s pink,” she declared. “I’m leaving no questions — head to toe in pink. I kind of started that with ‘Lucky’ [her debut from 2023]. It was not on purpose at first, but on the Lucky Tour, I realized everyone was showing up in head-to-toe green. So for the next album, ‘Am I Okay?,’ I really leaned into it [with blue] — and of course I’ve leaned into it again with ‘Cloud Nine.’ I chose pink because I think there is a softness about this music that isn’t in my other albums. And I think it’s come from the confidence that I have now. It’s about falling in love and falling out of love, but when you’re truly confident, it’s not the end of the world when it doesn’t work out, you know what I mean? And my other albums, maybe I perceived it as the end of the world. Now this new music is just more carefree and confident. So I thought pink was a perfect color to feel empowering and confident, but also soft, and that’s what the new music is like.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMegan Moroney at the 2025 Variety CMA Awards Interview Lounge presented by Duke Cannon at Anzie Blue on November 17, 2025 in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDon’t expect pure positivity from the new collection. “There’s definitely still some heartbreakers on the album, because I’ll never abandon the emo cowgirl thing. Writing sad songs is so easy for me, for whatever reason. But I will say that, even in the sad songs, it didn’t not work out because I allowed them to treat me poorly. It didn’t work out because I cut things off,” she clarifies, just in case anyone take the vulnerability of the songs to suggest she lacked agency in the situations described. “It’s still sad when you have to end things, and it’s still devastating, But even in the saddest songs, there’s so much hope and confidence that it’s gonna be OK, which is definitely a new theme that I explored in this album. I think it just comes from maybe getting a little bit older and knowing who I am and just natural confidence that keeps growing.”\n\n\tShe was she describes what she considers her emotional growth curb, it may be hard to remember she is about to release her third album not much more than two years after releasing the first (not counting deluxe editions). “I swear songwriting makes me into who I am, and it’s really cool to have these snapshots of my emotions in time. I even think the girl that wrote ‘Girl in the Mirror’ couldn’t have written ‘Beautiful Things.’ Because in ‘Beautiful Things,’ not only do I know I’m worth it, I feel qualified to tell other people that they’re worth it too. And I think that’s just a really cool, natural way to see the growth of just who I am and who I’m becoming…\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMegan Moroney in the Variety CMA Lounge\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It took me a long time and a lot of experiences and a lot of the same being ‘the girl in the mirror’ so many times to be like, ‘I don’t have to be like this when I know someone’s not right for me. I don’t have to drag it out for a year and a half and see if they’ll change. As soon as I know I deserve better, I can get out.’ And ‘Beautiful Things’ was inspired by that feeling because I’m like: I think it’s OK, too, to realize it sucks that it didn’t work out and it sucks that they’re not the person that I want them to be.”\n\n\tShe’s owning “the confidence to know that you’re gonna be OK, that there’s so many other fish in the sea — so many species! ‘You’re gonna be all right’ — those are some of my favorite lyrics in ‘Beautiful Things,’ even though they’re so simple. I wrote it for my niece, for when she gets older and needs the song. I believe in having someone tell you it’s gonna be OK, so you trust their advice. I think that it’s a really powerful song and message.”\n\n\t“WIth ‘6 Months Later,’ I can acknowledge how much it hurt dramatically.” Or a bit comedically, at the same time. “I say, ‘Outta six feet deep, I was five / Pretty sure they held called a hearse outside.’ I’m acknowledging that I’m being dramatic, but it’s also acknowledging the pain that was real. And then the chorus goes into the fun, like ‘What doesn’t kill you six months later’ — like, they always come back, so don’t even worry about it. And I t know that I’m a role model to a lot of young men and women, and so I like to have that kind of empowering song, like I always gravitated towards, you know, songs that made me feel like I was gonna get through the situation or that I didn’t need the person that was treating me badly. I always loved those kind of songs. So now to be able to write them and include them on albums, it’s just really fun for me and I get a lot of messages about my songs and how they help people. That’s probably my favorite part of the job.”\n",

A.I.'s not an immediate threat!\n      \n    \n          We caught up with NDT today in NYC ... according to Neil, comedians might have some of the only safe jobs left ... that is, if you're good! He judges A.I. to be a soulless entity that doesn't understand what it's saying -- a considerable hurdle to overcome if you're mining for the revelatory and surprising insights needed for impactful jokes.\n      \n    \n          He explained, \"I've asked A.I. to give me some good jokes ... they were on a bad dad-joke level.\"\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          But it's curious to Neil the sudden panic among creatives anyway. He pointed out when automation and robotics became ubiquitous, taking millions of jobs from factory workers on the assembly line, artists remained relatively silent.\n      \n    \n          He said, \"The creative artists didn't think about it or care, because they weren't on the assembly line. So where was their sympathy when other people were losing their jobs?\"\n      \n    \n          Another job possibly making Neil's shortlist ... good therapists. Watch the clip ... joked there's a whole new branch of therapy necessary to accommodate the people falling in love with their A.I. chatbots.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Neil's latest book -- \"Just Visiting This Planet\" -- is available now.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Neil deGrasse Tyson\n              \n                          \n                Technology\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

According to documents filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and obtained by TMZ, Eminem wants to protect the name of his diabolical rap alter-ego and avoid brand confusion.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The filing alleges the \"Without Me\" rapper would suffer \"damage and injury\" if Swim Shady is allowed to keep its name.

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tNuuly is stepping into the Ton.\n\n\tThe fashion rental subscription service has unveiled an exclusive capsule collection inspired by Netflix and Shondaland’s “Bridgerton” Season 4, marking its latest entertainment-driven fashion collaboration. Created in partnership with four independent designers — Guizio, Fashion Brand Co., House of Aama and Studio Tessa Fay — the 24-piece collection reimagines Regency-era romance through a modern, everyday lens. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe collection blends historical references with contemporary silhouettes, spanning blouses, matching sets and formal maxi dresses — detailed with elegant silver tones, toile prints, botanical florals, corsetry details, hourglass shapes and soft drapery. “At Nuuly, we believe getting dressed should be a fun and creative adventure,” Sky Pollard, Nuuly’s head of product, said in a statement. “The Bridgerton fans want to ‘live like a Bridgerton’ in a way that feels relevant to their modern lives. Our approach was to reimagine Regency, not replicate it.”\n\n\tPollard added that the brand intentionally tapped designers with distinct points of view, allowing subscribers to interpret “Bridgerton”-inspired dressing through their own personal style rather than a single aesthetic. The result is a collection that nods to the show’s signature romance while aligning with Nuuly’s rental-first model, which encourages experimentation without long-term investment.\n\n\tThe Nuuly x “Bridgerton” collection launches Feb. 26, coinciding with the premiere of Season 4, Part 2, which follows the first batch of episodes debuting Jan. 29 exclusively on Netflix. The capsule will be available to rent on Nuuly.com as part of the platform’s $98 monthly subscription, which allows members to choose any six items for the month. Inclusive sizing was built into the collection from the start, with pieces offered in sizes XS through 3X.\n\n\n\tSubscribe to Nuuly here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFootball analyst Mina Kimes has covered many changes in pro football since she joined ESPN in 2014.\n\n\tOne of the most exciting, in her view, involves the Taylor Swift effect.\n\n\tInterest in the game among teenage girls and 20-something women surged in 2023 after Swift and Travis Kelce, the gregarious Kansas City Chiefs tight end, went public with their romance. At first, Kimes noted the cascade of social media posts from Swifties who tracked the pop star’s every move and analyzed every outfit that she wore while attending Chiefs games. But by the 2025 football season, Kimes noticed a distinct shift in the tenor of the commentary on some of those accounts. It’s become much more knowledgeable about the game itself. \n\t\n\n\t“They went from posting pictures of Taylor and saying, ‘Oh, hey, Taylor’s at the game and she’s wearing this,’ to complaining about the Chiefs’ play calling. I freakin’ love that,” says Kimes. Among her roles at ESPN is being part of the ensemble of the daily “NFL Live” series, hosted by “Monday Night Football” sideline reporter Laura Rutledge.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJustin Metz for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFootball has been a pillar of American culture and network television since the days of Joe Namath, Vince Lombardi and Howard Cosell in the 1960s and ’70s. But as the NFL gears up for the final bout of the 2025 season — Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8 — the league is coming off a remarkably strong season. Everything seemed to go right for pro football last year, from notching a 10% year-over-year viewership gain to nail-biting finishes to the kind of unpredictability in team rankings that keeps fans glued to live telecasts and shelling out huge dollars to attend games.\n\t\n\n\tSome of the dynamism around the 2025 season can only be chalked up to fate and the gridiron gods. But much of it reflects the rewards reaped by the NFL’s concerted push to attract new fans outside the U.S. and to build on the windfall of women who came along with Swift. This past year also was elevated by the success that the league’s TV partners had in harnessing the lure of live game coverage to drive larger corporate imperatives — namely, building up the streaming platforms that represent the future for the parent companies of NBC, CBS, ESPN/ABC and Fox.\n\n\tREAD MORE: Mike Tirico’s Tough Task: Can He Help NBC Make Hard Pivot to Sports and Draw Big Crowds in Streaming Era?\n\n\tThe NFL’s growth comes after years of investment in what Tim Ellis, executive VP and chief marketing officer for the NFL, calls the “helmets off” strategy to humanize the league. “We’ve never had a bigger fan base. We’ve been working hard on building perceptions of the league,” Ellis says. “The strategy was to get the helmets off the players and humanize them, to lean in their passions and showcase our players as the face of the league.”\n\n\tKey to the effort to burnish pro football’s image has been to highlight the off-the-field activity of players. The league has courted influencers and creators such as MrBeast and YouTuber IShowSpeed (who has some 50 million followers), giving them access to players and behind-the-scenes material that help drive interest among Gen Z viewers, who had been steadily losing interest in the game. The NFL has even hired fashion experts to take advantage of the fact that younger players love to strut their sartorial stuff. Most of the NFL pre-game shows now feature long clips of the players dressed to the nines as they arrive at the stadium. It’s the NFL’s weekly fashion show.\n\n\n\n\n\t“It’s really about showing a more accessible, more compassionate face of the league, and that’s helped us to appeal to a lot of more casual audiences, like girls and women, people of color, LGBTQ communities,” says Ellis. “All of those efforts have really helped us connect with those audiences, and bring them in. In general, it just made the field feel more friendly and more accessible for everyone.”\n\n\tJennifer Storms, chief marketing officer for NBCUniversal Television and Streaming, says the football audience is expanding in ways that are hard to achieve with other forms of content. Making games available on streaming platforms and the plethora of highlights on social media help to engage younger fans. And the explosive growth of sports-related content across linear networks and streamers has also brought more consumers into the arena.\n\n\t“We’re seeing a very multigenerational audience for football, which is always so important for long-term success. More women are coming in than ever before,” says Storms, a sports TV veteran.\n\t\n\n\tFor sure, the Swift-Kelce relationship provided a jolt. But the trendlines for female viewership of football were already going up amid the resurgence of interest over the past decade, which followed a string of scandals involving star players and controversies over the league’s handling of these issues. \n\n\t“Women already make up roughly half of NFL viewership, and that share is growing fastest among younger viewers,” says Elle Duncan, the former ESPN anchor who joined Netflix in December as its first staff sportscaster. “The opportunity now is to stop treating women as a new audience and start treating them as a core one with smarter storytelling, lifestyle-forward partnerships and more visibility for women across the sport.”\n\n\tKimes and other analysts cite a number of key drivers for the growth. Fantasy football leagues are popular in many workplaces and in online communities, and have piqued the interestof casual fans. The broad expansion of football-related talk shows, studio interview and analysis shows, documentaries and docuseries are like a big net that helps draw in new fans as well as those who were otherwise confused by the Byzantine rules of the game that originated in the U.S. in the late 19th century. It was originally envisioned as something that could help collegiate men (aka eggheads) toughen up and prepare for fighting the wars of empire. Now football is a business empire unto itself that is no longer contained to staging and televising live games. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMina Kimes on the set of “NFL Live” at Soldier Field in Chicago\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElaina Eichorn / ESPN Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNetflix once vowed that it would never invest in live sports. But as the streamer grew, the potential to capitalize on the rabid fandom around the NFL was too tempting. In 2024, it struck a lucrative deal with the NFL to create a Christmas Day sports and entertainment event by carrying two live games along with musical performances and several hours of pre- and post-game coverage. Now, like many other major platforms, Netflix is packed with sports-related content, including an SEO-friendly docuseries franchise that follows stars from different teams who play the same position. \n\n\tThe unscripted TV genre known as “sport shoulder content” has become “quite the trend for the last few years, for many reasons,” says Ameeth Sankaran, CEO of Religion of Sports, the production company founded in 2017 by NFL veterans Tom Brady and Michael Strahan and producer Gotham Chopra.\n\n\tNetworks see sports-related content — such as Netflix’s F1 docu-series “Drive to Survive” and Amazon’s NFL-focused “All or Nothing”— as a way to squeeze more value from extremely high-priced sports rights packages. At its best, this kind of content creates a virtuous cycle that keeps viewers watching more content overall and keeps them interested in sports and players, which in turn makes them more likely to come back for live games. Sports-related content is also generally attractive to advertisers and brand partners, Sankaran notes.\n\t\n\n\t“All of the networks that have live-game strategies are reaching out for these kinds of shows,” he says. “It’s been a real pillar of our strategy to align our superpower in storytelling and our access to great athletes with the [sports programming] strategies of networks and of brands.”\n\n\tWhen it comes to traditional sports analysis and commentary shows, female personalities have emerged front and center as hosts and commentators. Kimes joined ESPN as a writer for its digital magazine. The quality of her reporting and analysis led her to increasingly high-profile on-air roles. The gender and ethnic diversity among sportscasters today has also gone a long way to widen the audience for sports in general and football in particular, Kimes says, citing the example of “NFL Live.”\n\n\t“It makes it interesting and approachable. The fact that our show has a family vibe is another thing that’s appealing, and not just to women,” Kimes says. “We’re not yelling at each other. We’re not talking over each other. We’re listening to each other and laughing.”\n\n\tAnother factor driving the NFL of late has been the rise over the past decade of flag football leagues — a variation of the game that is more appealing to women and girls. Traditional football is a physical game of tackles, kicks and dogpile-style efforts to stop opponents from advancing the ball down the field. Flag football takes some of the risk away with its emphasis on players grabbing cloth flags that hang off players’ belts and inseams.\n\n\tGirls’ flag football leagues have multiplied significantly in recent years. And flag football’s designation as an official Olympic sport starting with the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles is also an accelerant.\n\n\t“It’s a direct on-ramp to lifelong fandom. If the NFL wants sustained growth, it’s not just about who’s watching on Sunday — it’s about who’s playing on Saturday and seeing themselves in the game long before that,” Netflix’s Duncan says. \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tAt the same time, the NFL has made a big investment in courting fans outside the U.S. Since 2021, the league has played more than 30 regular-season games in foreign cities, from Mexico City to Dublin to Munich. The league has devoted enormous resources to cultivating fans outside the U.S., where soccer tends to have the most rabid fandom and various soccer league rights are as prized as NFL packages are in the 50 states. \n\n\tThe NFL’s international diversification is exemplified by the choice of Bad Bunny as this year’s Super Bowl halftime show performer. The decision to give the Puerto Rican reggaeton star the coveted spotlight during the event that is typically the year’s most-watched program speaks volumes about the NFL’s audience. The league has even withstood the criticism of Trump administration officials in defense of the global performer.\n\n\t“We do have a pretty cool opportunity with Bad Bunny and one of the, you know, biggest artists in the world, and the fact that we also have the Super Bowl on [NBCU’s Spanish-language network] Telemundo. Him being not only a music star but a cultural star provides us another unique marketing opportunity,” says Storms. “Between NBC, Peacock and Telemundo, each of them have a very relevant opportunity to really showcase the Super Bowl, and that makes it really fun.”\n\n\tThe strength that the NFL is enjoying this year is in sharp contrast to the string of PR nightmares that the league faced not so long ago.\n\n\tIn September 2014, TMZ published a grainy elevator security video that showed Ray Rice, the star running back for the Baltimore Ravens, punching his girlfriend in the face so hard that she was knocked unconscious. He then started to drag her limp body out of the elevator, until he encountered an employee of the Atlantic City hotel where the assault took place.\n\n\tThe uproar spurred by the video’s release — seven months after the incident — ultimately forced the Ravens to fire Rice. The incident also sparked outrage over the league’s initially muted response to domestic violence committed by a player. \n\n\tThe Rice scandal made headlines for months. And it came on the heels of years of criminal incidents involving players, from Michael Vick spearheading an illegal dogfighting ring that surfaced in 2007 to Aaron Hernandez being wrapped up in a murder case for which he would be convicted in 2015. In aggregate, it left the league’s American-as-apple-pie image badly tarnished.\n\n\tToday, a new generation of NFL boldface names who have kept clear of personal scandals — think Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, Travis Kelce, Lamar Jackson, Bo Nix, Jalen Hurts, Joe Burrow, Christian McCaffrey and Jayden Daniels — has been a significant help in rehabilitating the NFL brand. And it doesn’t hurt that the league and its 32 teams have made an intentional push for greater local outreach and philanthropy in each franchise’s backyard.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the start of the NFL International match between the Minnestota Vikings and Cleveland Browns at London’s Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last October\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPA Images via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEllis acknowledges that the controversies that engulfed the league, coupled with the sea-change in the way Gen Z viewers watch TV and engage with sports, forced the NFL to take an aggressive approach to rebranding itself. “We just needed to focus on our roots and begin to modernize. It gave us a chance to focus in a very emotional way on the things that players really cared about. And it allowed them to be very vulnerable and open and connect with people in a different way.”\n\t\n\n\tFootball devotees emphasize that the game is addictive in part because of its scarcity. The NFL’s core regular season encompasses 17 games played across 18 weeks, compared with 82 games per season for the NBA and 162 for Major League Baseball. This past year, the unpredictability around which teams would make their way to the Super Bowl made the season that much more exciting. To wit, 73 of this year’s regular-season games were decided by three points or less, and 62 games were decided in the final two minutes of play, per NFL stats. It’s no surprise that NFL games accounted for 89 of 2025’s top 100 telecasts.\n\n\tTaylor Swift’s teams of choice — the Chiefs and her hometown favorite, the Philadelphia Eagles — didn’t even make it out of the divisional playoffs. The Eagles were the league’s reigning champs, having defeated the Chiefs to win the Super Bowl last year. The Chiefs claimed back-to-back Super Bowl wins in 2023 and 2024. But the battle begins anew every fall, and there are no guarantees for even the best teams, with only 17 shots to rack up wins or losses.\n\n\t“I like a lot of sports, but football is simply unparalleled because there aren’t that many games, and everything is heightened drama. It’s just like a perfect televised sport, in my mind,” Kimes says. “This year, what happened was pretty unique. I’ve loved watching the Chiefs and I loved watching the Patriots during their dynasties, but it’s pretty cool that no one has any idea who the best team in the NFL is, right? It’s pretty cool that for most of the season, it felt like any one of about 20 teams could make it to the Super Bowl.”\n\n\tTodd Spangler contributed to this story.\n",

    "body": "\n\tStuart Ford’s AGC Studios has come on board to finance and co-produce psychological thriller “Sweat,” starring Ana de Armas (“Ballerina,” “Blonde,” “No Time to Die”) and directed by J Blakeson (“I Care a Lot,” “The Disappearance of Alice Creed”).\n\n\t“Sweat” is based on the Polish film written and directed by Magnus von Horn, which was in official selection at the 2020 Cannes Film Festival, produced by Lava Films.\n\t\n\n\tThe film centers on ambitious fitness influencer Emma Kent (De Armas), who dreams of matching the success of her idol, social media superstar Kat Highbrook. When an encounter with Kat goes horribly wrong, Emma’s carefully curated world begins to collapse and she is forced into a dangerous arrangement with Trent, an obsessive fan, whose unhinged devotion pushes Emma to choose how far she’s willing to go for fame.\n\n\tThe film is set to begin production March 30 in Los Angeles and the U.K., and will be distributed internationally by AGC International with WME Independent, CAA Media Finance and AGC co-repping U.S. rights. Additional casting is underway.\n\n\t“Sweat” will be produced by Guy Stodel through his Rosto Inc. banner, alongside Blakeson via his Crimple Beck production company, and AGC’s Ford.\n\n\tDe Armas received Academy Award, SAG, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe in Andrew Dominik’s “Blonde,” which premiered in competition at the 2022 Venice Film Festival. She first gained global recognition with Rian Johnson’s “Knives Out,” earning her a Golden Globe nomination, and has since starred in major projects including “No Time to Die,” “Blade Runner 2049,” “The Gray Man,” “Ghosted” and “Ballerina.”\n\t\n\n\tBlakeson is an English director, screenwriter and producer. His first feature film, “The Disappearance of Alice Creed,” was a critically acclaimed neo-noir that has so far spawned three foreign remakes. In 2016, Blakeson directed “The 5th Wave” for Columbia Pictures/Sony, based on the novel of the same name, which grossed $110 million worldwide. He is best known for writing and directing “I Care a Lot,” which was a hit for Netflix, earned critical praise and won Rosamund Pike a Golden Globe for best actress in a motion picture – comedy or musical.\n\n\tRecently, Blakeson was showrunner and director of the eight-part crime thriller series “Culprits” for Hulu/Disney+.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor more than five months, Paramount Skydance’s David Ellison has tried in vain to win a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery. Nothing has worked: The WBD board of directors has rejected Paramount’s acquisition overtures eight times and remains committed to its industry-altering $83 billion pact with Netflix.\n\n\tBut Ellison refuses to go away. Paramount Skydance last week extended the deadline for its hostile $30-a-share all-cash offer for WBD to Feb. 20 — and officially urged Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders to vote against WBD’s amended all-cash deal with Netflix at April’s special meeting of stockholders. Predictably, Warner Bros. Discovery sharply dismissed Ellison’s latest maneuvers, claiming more than 93% of its shareholders have rejected Paramount’s “inferior scheme,” the company said.\n\t\n\n\tSources familiar with the thinking of Paramount Skydance and its financial backers, which include Larry Ellison, David’s multibillionaire father, say the company isn’t prepared to go higher than $30 a share (which is up more than 50% from its first $19-a-share proposal). But at this point, more cash on the table would seem to be the Ellisons’ only option.\n\n\n\tIs David Ellison just a rich guy trying to save face after multiple rebuffs?\n\n\tActually, he appears to truly believe Paramount has a chance to land WBD. His disrupt-and-delay strategy is engineered around the possibility that regulators in the U.S. or Europe — or President Trump — will spike the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal outright or attach onerous conditions, clearing a path for Paramount’s rival offer.\n\t\n\n\tThrough its tactics, Paramount is “buying time for negotiations, raising the costs for rejecting the deal and signaling commitment” to buying WBD, says Joseph Kalmenovitz, assistant professor of finance at the Simon Business School at the University of Rochester.\n\n\tColumbia Law School professor Reilly Steel suggests that David Ellison and Paramount Skydance are hoping that Trump will direct the Department of Justice to block the Netflix-WB merger. “It should be obvious by now that Trump does not care about traditional norms of presidential noninterference with individual enforcement decisions,” says Steel.\n\n\tApart from what the president might do to determine the outcome of the M&A fight, the Justice Department or other regulatory authorities could have a plausible case for blocking Netflix’s takeover of WB’s TV and film studios and HBO Max, given that it would reinforce the streamer’s dominance.\n\n\tTogether, Netflix and HBO Max would hold an estimated 43% share of the global subscription streaming market, according to Paramount. And politicians on both sides of the aisle are wary of the power Netflix would amass by swallowing Warner Bros. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called the proposed deal “an anti-monopoly nightmare.”\n\n\tOn Feb. 3, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos and Warner Bros. Discovery chief strategy officer Bruce Campbell are due to testify before a Senate antitrust hearing titled “Examining the Competitive Impact of the Proposed Netflix-Warner Brothers Transaction.” Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, warned that there are “a lot of antitrust red flags here” and predicted in a tweet last month: “Buckle up for an intense antitrust hearing in the Senate.”\n\n\tMakan Delrahim, Paramount’s chief legal officer, who headed the DOJ’s antitrust division during Trump’s first term, called Netflix “the new-age digital version” of Standard Oil given its movie-output deals with Sony and Universal (which would be augmented by WB’s sizable library). “How does that deal even make it out of the WBD or the Netflix Board room?” he asked rhetorically in a Jan. 18 LinkedIn post.\n\n\tAmid the saber-rattling, Netflix and WBD say they’ve done the due diligence and are certain their pact will get the green light. In the end, David Ellison’s bet on Netflix-WB hitting a regulatory wall hinges on how broadly the combo’s competitive set is defined. And Netflix argues that it’s everything on TV — not just streaming.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix’s share of TV viewing time remains less than 10% in all major markets. And it claims the addition of WB would still leave it trailing YouTube in the U.S. In a message seemingly aimed at the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission as much as its investors, the streamer said in its Q4 shareholder letter: “We relish competition and work to earn more of consumers’ attention.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tParadise City Sales has boarded international sales on “Baran: Inheritance,” a Malaysian supernatural horror feature from filmmaker Joel Soh (“Polis Evo”) ahead of the European Film Market. \n\n\tA haunting tale of familial reckoning, “Baran” marks Soh’s solo-directorial debut and is rooted in Malaysian folklore and spiritual belief systems, exploring generational trauma through the lens of possession and ancient curses.The story follows an estranged son who returns to his remote village to care for his dying father, only to uncover that his bloodline is bound by an old pact with a demonic Djinn. As he is pulled into the shadowy worlds of shamanism and exorcism, he must confront whether he can sever the inheritance before it consumes him and his family entirely.\n\n\n\tSoh is best known as the writer-producer behind “Polis Evo,” a buddy-cop action comedy that became one of Malaysia’s most successful homegrown franchises, grossing more than $22 million. After writing and producing the first film, Soh co-directed “Polis Evo 2” and produced “Polis Evo 3″ through his banner Blackflag.Soh describes the project as deeply personal. “‘Baran: Inheritance’ draws on personal experience of fear, control and trauma passed down through generations,” he said. “Inspired by Malaysia’s dark folklore and spiritual beliefs, the film confronts the unsettling truth of becoming what we once feared and asks whether we can ever break free.”Paradise City’s head of sales Alexandre Moreau said the film will tap into the booming popularity of Southeast Asian genre cinema that “has significantly grown in recent years, gaining strong international recognition.” “‘Baran: Inheritance’ is meticulously crafted, anchored in authentic Malaysian folklore and exorcism rituals, and distinguished by its attention to detail and confident filmmaking style,” Moreau continued. “Baran: Inheritance” was previously showcased at the Cannes Frontières and Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival project markets.\n\t\n\n\tThe Malaysia–Singapore–Indonesia co-production is produced by Blackflag, with Soh producing alongside David Lin, Hee Dominique, Sultan Pirzhan, Sharon Gan and Elvira Sarieva, and co-produced by Yu Ern Chia.The cast is led by Malaysian stars Farid Kamil and Diana Danielle, alongside Wan Hanafi Su and Azman Hassan, with a special Aaron Aziz. The film is scored by Trevor Gureckis, a composer known for his work on Night Shyamalan’s series “The Servant” and the feature film “The Friend”. The key crew also includes Soo Mun Thye (“The Breaking Ice”).“Baran: Inheritance” joins Paradise City Sales’ EFM roster which includes “Wolfram” by Warwick Thornton, “We Are All Strangers” by Anthony Chen, and “A Family” by Mees Peijnenburg. Additional titles on the lineup include “Nino in Paradise,” “Tell Me Everything;” as well as Martin Provost’s “Love Lessons” and Judith Godrèche’s “A Girl’s Story.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Atlas V Group, a European leader in VR and immersive content production, has completed a €5 million ($6 million) fundraising round from key investors, including Taiwan-based HTC (formerly known as High Tech Computer Corporation), to fast-track its expansion into gaming and location-based immersive experiences.\n\n\tFounded in 2017, Atlas V has partnered with high profile producers and talent on critically acclaimed VR content such as “Elvover,” produced and voiced by Cate Blanchett (“Evolver“); “Spheres: Songs of Spacetime,” produced by Darren Aronofsky, and voiced by Chastain, Millie Bobby Brown and Patti Smith; “Gloomy Eyes” voiced by Collin Farrell; and “Battlescar,” voiced by Rosario Dawson. These have premiered at top festivals, including Sundance, Tribeca, Venice and Cannes’ market, among others. Its best-known productions also include “Wallace & Gromit: The Grand Getaway,” developed with Aardman and Meta; “Mobile Suit Gundam: Silver Phantom,” co-produced with Bandai Namco for Meta Quest; “Astra,” one of the first mixed-reality apps on Quest 3; and more recently, “Playing with Fire,” a massive location-based immersive experience that launched at the Philharmonie de Paris in 2025, blending art, music, and spatial storytelling.\n\t\n\n\t“For years, Atlas V has crafted emotional stories that audiences can truly step into,” said Antoine Cayrol, CEO and co-founder of Atlas Group. “Today, we’re amplifying that mission — merging narrative artistry, multi-user experiences, and gaming to shape the next generation of immersive entertainment.\n\n\n\tCayrol told Variety that Atlas V will continue producing two or three narrative VR experiences per year. As it enters a new chapter, the company has staffed up with 55 people, many of whom come from topnotch gaming companies such as Ubisoft. Atlas V is currently in production with nine games and plans to deliver approximately 50 games per year. \n\t\n\n\tAtlas V will also be rolling off some of its IP’s, like “Gloomy Eyes,” into location-based experiences; and is working with a number of European groups on developing spinoffs of flagship franchises.\n\n\tThe immersive entertainment market is evolving rapidly, with social and casual free-to-play titles now dominating user engagement across VR platforms. With the $6 million it has just raised, Atlas V looks to build on that momentum to put together an industrialized pipeline of casual immersive games, as well as continue developing strategic partnerships with major entertainment IPs to bring iconic franchises into immersive gaming; match its teams with talent from the gaming and XR sectors; build collaborations with XR companies; and explore synergies with HTC’s portfolio to accelerate growth in VR gaming.\n\n\t“This isn’t a pivot — it’s a diversification,” says co-founder and producer Arnaud Colinart. “We remain fully committed to the narrative and artistic projects that define our identity – including large-scale VR installations like ‘Playing with Fire’ — while expanding into scalable, social experiences that will drive the next wave of immersive adoption.”\n\n\tAtlas V’s director Mathieu Barbier says the company has observed “a major shift in the gaming landscape, with social and casual experiences increasingly driving engagement across XR platforms, alongside the emergence of new audiences and genres thriving on digital storefronts.”\n\n\t“For us as a studio, this represents an exciting challenge: evolving our teams and creative approach to align with these new trends,” Barbier continued. \n\n\tAtlas V will now become a vertically integrated studio, involved in creating, producing, and publishing its own immersive works. The banner will work hand-in-hand with its subsidiary Astrea Immersive which handles distribution.\n\n\t“Atlas V’s strength has always been creative independence,” Cayrol said. “By bringing production and publishing under one roof, we’re simplifying our operations and ensuring that every project we launch fully reflects our vision.”\n\n\tWith more than five years of collaboration with all major players of the XR industry since 2017, including a framework agreement to produce immersive content, and a preferred-partner status on Horizon Worlds, Atlas V has earned privileged access to major XR platforms, early-stage technologies, and beta programs.\n\t\n\n\t“Atlas V has a proven record of creative and technical excellence in XR,” said William Wu, HTC’s strategic investment manager. “Their move into scalable F2P gaming is a bold, strategic step that leverages their storytelling DNA and positions them as a key player in the future of immersive entertainment,” added Wu. \n",

    "body": "\n\tBruce Willis is not aware of his frontotemporal dementia diagnosis, his wife Emma Heming Willis revealed during an interview on “The Unexpected Journey” podcast (via TMZ).\n\n\t“I think they think this is their normal,” she explained. “There is this term, this neurological condition, that comes with FTD and other types of dementia that’s called anosognosia, where your brain can’t identify what is happening to it. Where people think this might be denial, like where they don’t want to go to the doctor because ‘I’m fine.’ It’s actually… this is the anosognosia that comes into play… Bruce never tapped in. He never connected the dots that he had this disease. I’m really happy about that. I’m really happy he doesn’t know about it.”\n\t\n\n\tThe actor’s wife continued. “He is still very much present in his body… when someone says to me, ‘Does Bruce still know who you are?’ Yes he does, because he doesn’t have Alzheimer’s he has FTD. He has a way with connecting with me, our children, that might not be the same as you would connect with your loved one but it’s still very beautiful and meaningful. It’s just different. You just learn how to adapt.”\n\n\n\tWillis’ family announced in 2022 that he had received an aphasia diagnosis. Aphasia is a language disorder caused by brain damage that affects a person’s ability to communicate. The family announced a year later in February 2023 the diagnosis had evolved to frontotemporal dementia, writing on social media: “While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis.”\n\n\tSitting down for an interview with ABC News’ Diane Sawyer last August, Emma Heming Willis said that “Bruce is still very mobile. Bruce is in really great health overall, you know. It’s just his brain that is failing him… The language is going, and, you know, we’ve learned to adapt. And we have a way of communicating with him, which is just a… different way.”\n\t\n\n\tHeming Willis told Sawyer at the time that she first realized something was off with Bruce when he started acting “a little more quiet” in social settings despite usually being “very talkative and very engaged.”\n\n\t“When the family would get together, he would kind of just melt a little bit,” she explained. “He felt a little removed, very cold. Not like Bruce, who is very warm and affectionate. To go in the complete opposite of that was alarming and scary.”\n\n\tWatch Emma Heming Willis’ full interview on “The Unexpected Journey” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBack when the Isley Brothers scored their first hit with “Shout,” lead singer Ronald Isley couldn’t have imagined that the group would one day have their own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which will be unveiled in a ceremony on Jan. 28. That’s because the Walk’s official groundbreaking didn’t take place until February 1960, six months following the song’s release and more than half a decade after the group began performing. And what would he have said if you had told him the Isleys would still be working in 2026, with an ambitious new album in the works?\n\t\n\n\t“I would say that’s fantastic and amazing. Oh, man, that’s so awesome,” says Ronald, who leads the group with his lone surviving sibling, guitarist Ernie Isley. “So many years, man.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRonald, left, and Ernie Isley of the Isley Brothers\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOver those years, the Isley Brothers’ music has been the soundtrack to countless parties, backyard cookouts, weddings, hookups, heartbreaks, road trips and sporting events, as well as actual movies, with prominent needle drops in “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,” “Rush Hour” and “Bridget Jones’s Baby,” among others. They even provided an early showcase for Jimi Hendrix, who, as a member of their backing band, made his recording debut on their 1964 single “Testify.”\n\n\n\n\n\tThe Isleys are the only act to score hits on the Billboard Hot 100 across six consecutive decades (1950s-2000s), cutting a wide stylistic swath from R&B raveups like the aforementioned million-seller “Shout” and “Twist & Shout” and the string-sweetened Motown track “This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)” to the funky soul of the horn-driven “It’s Your Thing” and the Latin-accented psychedelic guitar workout “That Lady.” \n\t\n\n\tThe Isleys songs have also been sampled frequently by hip-hop artists, most notably the group’s “quiet storm” soul classics “Footsteps in the Dark” (Ice Cube’s “It Was a Good Day”), “Between the Sheets” (Notorious B.I.G.’s “Big Poppa,” Megan Thee Stallion’s “Consistency”), “Ballad for the Fallen Solder” (Drake and 21 Savage’s “Privileged Rappers”) and “Voyage to Atlantis” (SZA’s “Kitchen”). And Kendrick Lamar tapped the heavier side of the Isleys when he incorporated “The Lady” into his 2014 single “I,” which features newly recorded recreations of the guitar riff and other elements of the song, along with a guest vocal from Ronald.\n\n\n\n\n\t“They’re an evergreen of the hip-hop world. Everybody comes back to them time and time again,” says Rachael Conte, VP of sample clearance, legal and business affairs, for Sony Music Publishing. “Ron Isley’s vocals are legendary. Sometimes there’s a vocal sample, the bass line … it’s all parts of the song. You could take it apart and sample it any which way, and it’s gonna be a hit.”\n\n\n\n\n\tThe enduring power and reach of the Isley’s music was demonstrated at Barack Obama’s presidential inauguration festivities in 2009, when Garth Brooks led the president and vice president-elect and their wives in a sing-along of “Shout” in front of the Lincoln Memorial. But, for Ernie, the best example of its impact might be the time he met Paul McCartney at a private event at businessman Ron Perelman’s estate.\n\n\t“[McCartney] gives me a bear hug and just about cuts my wind off and says, ‘Ernie, if it were not for the Isley Brothers, the Beatles would still be in Liverpool,’” recalls Ernie. “When we got on stage together, he said that again for everybody to hear. And we performed with Bon Jovi, Jennifer Hudson, Usher and I don’t know who else. Wow. It was just one of those moments. To see everybody stand up, clap their hands, and sing ‘Twist and Shout’ and ‘Shout’ … They’re just like ‘Happy Birthday,’ right?”\n\n\tIn 2022, the Isleys returned to the charts with a remake of their 1975 song “Make Me Say It Again, Girl,” featuring a co-lead vocal by Beyoncé. It had a 37-week run on Billboard’s Adult R&B Songs chart, peaking at No. 1, and made strong showings on Billboard’s R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay (No. 9) and Hot R&B Songs (No. 20) charts, but somehow missed the Hot 100.\n\t\n\n\t“I called [Beyoncé’s] mother [Tina Knowles], and I said, ‘We’re going to do this [remake], and I want to do it with Beyoncé,’” recalls Ronald. “She called her, and she called me back in five minutes. She said, ‘Please, I want to do it with you.’”\n\n\n\n\n\tProducer/engineer Tony Maserati, a longtime Beyoncé collaborator, was brought in to seamlessly blend her vocal with Isley’s in the final mix.\n\n\t“Ron was just a pleasure. He knows exactly what to say, and he knows exactly what he’s looking for, and that’s the mark of a real pro,” says Maserati. \n\n\tHe’s even more impressed by the Isleys’ remarkable stamina. “They knocked out a record a year for a very long time, and that’s not done anymore. There were some things where they were at the forefront and other things where they were catching up. And that’s what artists do. That’s survival in a tough business. That’s like being in the Olympics every year.”\n\n\tSchooled in a variety of genres, from country & western and R&B to pop and gospel, the original lineup of the Isley Brothers began performing together in their native Cincinnati in 1954, encouraged by their father O’Kelly Isley Sr., a Navy veteran and former vaudevillian. They quickly scored a major success, taking first place on the national TV competition show “Ted Mack’s Original Amateur Hour.” But, in September 1954, the family was dealt a devastating blow when 11-year-old Vernon — who, contrary to reports, was not their lead singer — was killed when he was hit by a vehicle while riding a bicycle to school. Encouraged by their mother Sallye, a church pianist and organist, they soldiered on as a trio. \n\n\tAfter the death of their father in 1957, the family relocated to Teaneck, N.J., to be closer to the action in New York City. In 1959, the Isleys signed to RCA Victor and scored a hit with the self-penned “Shout,” and followed two years later with “Twist & Shout” for independent label Wand Records, which hit No. 17 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\tIn 1963, the Isleys hired a new guitarist from Seattle, an Army vet named Jimi Hendrix. They bought him his first Fender Stratocaster and let him live at the family home, where he made a big impression on 11-year-old Ernie.\n\t\n\n\t“This guy was unlike any musician I had heard or seen,” says Ernie of Hendrix, who sat next to him on the family couch as they watched the Beatles make their debut on “The Ed Sullivan Show” on Feb. 9, 1964. “I didn’t know why he was practicing so much because he didn’t need to practice. He just played that well.”\n\n\tErnie famously channeled Hendrix with his distorted, liquid lead on their 1973 hit “That Lady,” recorded with a collection of newly acquired gear: a Fender Strat and Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi distortion and Maestro PS1-A Phase Shifter pedals.\n\n\t“I hit the very first note on the guitar solo, and the entire song changed into something else,” says Ernie, who played his first live gig with the Isleys as a drummer at 14 and went on to play bass on their hit “It’s Your Thing,” before switching to guitar. “I was like, ‘Oh, my God.’ I had never sounded like that. I never played like that.”\n\n\n\n\n\tTime has taken its toll on the Isleys. They lost eldest brother O’Kelly at the age of 48 in 1986, and youngest brother Marvin (who played bass with the Isleys from the early 1970s through 1997) passed at 56 in 2010, followed by Rudolph at 84 in 2023. In March, Ernie will turn 74, and Ronald turns 85 two months later, but they aren’t stopping. Inspired by their success with Beyoncé, they’re working on an album full of collabs with a collection of high-profile contemporary artists.\n\n\tAnd, as far as Ernie is concerned, all of his siblings are still with him.\n\n\t“I virtually communicate with all of my brothers every day. That’s a spiritual thing,” he says. “We have collectively shared in the music, so there’s no disconnect, really. And me and Ronald — it’s a great thing. It’s wonderful.”\n\n\tTipsheetWHAT The Isley Brothers receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of FameWHEN Jan. 28, 11:30 a.m.WHERE 7051 Hollywood Blvd., HollywoodWEB http://www.walkoffame.com\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass,” the story of a naive young hairdresser who travels to Hollywood hoping to sleep with Jon Hamm, has been described as an absurdist, deeply meta, gloriously raunchy comedy since it debuted at Sundance. But the new film from “Wet Hot American Summer” director David Wain and his co-writer Ken Marino is also a riff on “The Wizard of Oz.” \n\n\t“As we were constructing the story of this woman who has to figure out what to do in the event of her husband-to-be making his celebrity pass agreement a reality, it just started to organically make sense to us that there was like a ‘Wizard of Oz’ thread,” Wain says. “It seemed organically part of the DNA of what we were doing.”\n\t\n\n\tSo like Dorthy Gale, Gail is a naive young girl from Kansas. Only this time, instead of floating over the rainbow, she’s flying economy to a magical version of Tinseltown. There she encounters Caleb (Ben Wang), an agent-in-training at CAA, who discovers that he has the smarts to be a top wheeler and dealer, as well as Vincent (played by Marino), a down-on-his-luck paparazzi who secretly has a heart of gold. Lastly, there’s Hamm’s “Mad Men” co-star John Slattery, played by the actor himself. Only this version of Slattery is a whimpering scaredy-cat, who unleashes the beast within at a key moment in the film.\n\n\n\tObviously, the three are stand-ins for the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion and their quest to obtain a brain, a heart and some courage. To bring the point home, the filmmakers also included other nods to “The Wizard of Oz.” Gail’s shoes, for instance, are red, and Slattery is often outfitted in yellow like a Lion’s fur.\n\t\n\n\t“We wanted there to be these little references, but we were equally motivated by telling this story about these characters, and by exploring this idea of celebrity pass and of this whimsical journey through a  fantasized version of Hollywood,” Marino says. \n\n\tThis time, instead of traveling to the Emerald City, Gail and her buddies are trying to access Hamm’s suite in the Chateau Marmont where she hopes to — there’s no way of putting this delicately — fuck his brains out. \n\n\tAt one point, the filmmakers toyed with shooting the Kansas scenes in black and white, but they thought that would be too akin to “The Wizard of Oz’s” color palette and opted to just make the Hollywood sequences brighter and more dazzling. A few other things got left on the cutting room floor after Wain and Marino decided that they needed to draw parallels between the two films with a shade more subtlety.\n\n\t“There were references that were even more overt that we shot and didn’t use,” says Wain. “There was a line towards the end where after Jon Hamm says, ‘I’m just the guy behind the curtain pulling the levers,’ we had a cutaway of Ken Marino and John Slattery going like, ‘Where have I heard that before?’ But it was too much.”\n\n\tMarino and Wain have been friends with Hamm for years. He did a cameo in their 2007 film “The Ten,” and appeared on their show “Children’s Hospital” and their “Wet Hot American Summer” streaming series. Still, the men worried about Hamm’s reaction when they sent him the script. \n\n\t“It was definitely a scary thing to share this story that’s basically all about him,” says Wain. “He could have easily been like, ‘No, I’m not cool with this.’ And the same with Slattery. But luckily we sent it to Slattery first and he called up Jon, and was like, ‘We’ve got to do this together!'”\n\n\tJennifer Aniston had a similar reaction. The “Friends” star helps set the film’s plot in motion when Gail’s fiancé (Michael Cassidy) takes the idea of his celebrity sex pass literally and sleeps with Aniston in the backroom of a book store, where she’s signing copies of her memoir. Aniston has appeared in Wain and Marino’s film “Wanderlust,” but they still thought her agents would never show her the script. Why would she want to be depicted as a homewrecker? Instead, she leapt at the chance to send up her A-list image.\n\t\n\n\t“When we talked to Jen on set, she told us, ‘This is the stuff we should be doing — stuff that’s wild and fun and crazy!'” Marino says. “We’re like, ‘100%. Any time!'”\n\n\tWain and Marino aren’t shy about satirizing “The Wizard of Oz,” but ultimately they hope “Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass” works as more than just a film parody. \n\n\t“Some people who’ve watched it didn’t even catch the connection at all, and different people seem to pick up on it at different points within the movie,” Wain says. “Personally, I like that. I hope it stands on its own.” \n",

Ashley showed her seal of approval by reposting the story to her own account.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Notably, it's reported Ashley sold Haylie her Studio City, Calif. home in 2016, so there's some history between the pair. Haylie is now based out of her home state of Texas.\n      \n\n          The playdate has fans raising some eyebrows considering the mom group drama that blew up earlier this month when the \"High School Musical\" alum penned an essay for The Cut about a mean-girl mom circle she decided to quit -- a group fans speculated included Hilary, Mandy Moore, and Meghan Trainor. The chatter about a big falling out only deepened when Hilary's husband Matthew Koma seemingly threw shade at Ashley by mocking her essay on his social media.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          But wait ... there's more -- fans have long believed Hilary and Haylie are estranged, considering they haven't been seen together in years. Fans also speculate Hilary wrote about their broken relationship in her new song, \"We Don't Talk,\" which she debuted on her ongoing tour.\n      \n    \n          Hilary nor Haylie have addressed speculation about their relationship, and Hilary has not confirmed who her new song is about. Meanwhile, Ashley's rep told TMZ fans were looking too deep into her essay, and their theories missed the mark.\n      \n    \n          At the end of the day, it looks like Hilary is happily reconnecting with fans on tour, while Ashley and Haylie's are connecting with their kids.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Hilary Duff\n              \n                          \n                Ashley Tisdale\n              \n                          \n                Haylie Duff\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Family\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                celebrity kids\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Assistant U.S. Attorney Madison Smyser said in opening statements the brothers \"masqueraded as party boys when really they were predators.\"\n      \n    \n          The brothers have denied all allegations. Oren Alexander’s attorney, Teny Geragos, argued the claims -- dating back to their post-college years -- are being mischaracterized, saying, \"That is not trafficking.

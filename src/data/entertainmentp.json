    "body": "\n\tCelebrated German director Wim Wenders will serve as the jury president at the 76th Berlin Film Festival in February.\n\n\tThe trailblazing filmmaker, who is one of the pioneers of the New German Cinema movement, has worked across both fiction and documentary over his six-decade career. His most recent narrative film, “Perfect Days,” earned an Oscar nomination for best international feature. Wenders’ documentaries “Buena Vista Social Club” (1999), “Pina” (2011) and “The Salt of the Earth” (2014) have also been Oscar-nominated in the best doc category. His best known fiction work includes “Paris, Texas,” which won Cannes’ Palme d’Or in 1984; his Road Movie trilogy comprising “Alice in the Cities” (1974), “The Wrong Move” (1975) and “Kings of the Road” (1976); and the Berlin-set romantic fantasy “Wings of Desire” (1987).\n\t\n\n\t“Wim Wenders is one of the most influential voices in international cinema. For six decades, he has made films that move and delight us with their humanity and sense of wonder,” said Berlinale director Tricia Tuttle in a statement. “His insatiable curiosity and deep mastery of film language are evident in every work, whether he is exploring the gifts of other artists or illuminating our own search for meaning and connection. To say we are proud of this homegrown polymath is an understatement, and we cannot wait to see where jury president Wim Wenders leads our jury in picking the Golden and Silver Bear winners of the 76th Berlinale.”\n\n\n\tAdded Wenders, “It never hit me to even remotely think about being jury president in my hometown until Tricia Tuttle asked me. And then I realized: Wow! That’ll be a whole new way to see films at the Berlinale, for once watch each and every one in the competition and discuss them all in-depth with a group of intelligent and movie-loving people. How good can it get? I’m grateful to Tricia to invite me to this rare experience.”\n\t\n\n\tIn 2003, Wenders was one of the founding members of the German Film Academy and is also a co-founder of the European Film Academy, of which he served as president from 1996 to 2020. In 2015, he received the Berlinale’s Honorary Golden Bear for lifetime achievement. \n\n\tThis year’s Berlinale will take place Feb. 12-22. \n",

    "body": "\n\tBelgian-Rwandan filmmaker Jonas d’Adesky (“Twa Timoun”) brings his latest feature, “Kwibuka, Remember,” to the Red Sea Film Festival, a drama inspired by questions of identity and the long-term impact of Rwanda’s 1994 genocide. The film follows Lia, a Belgian-Rwandan professional basketball player raised in Europe, who returns to Rwanda to play for the national team and finds herself confronting a family history she never fully understood.\n\t\n\n\tD’Adesky says the project grew from his own experience navigating two cultures. “I wanted to talk about this feeling of living in one place but being linked to a second country, this desire people have to reconnect, to know, and understand.” He adds that portraying Rwanda beyond its most familiar narrative was equally important. “Rwanda often has this image of genocide that is very prevalent,” he says. “I wanted to make a film that takes place today and shows not only that history but the country in general, its energy, its vitality, and to be outside the cliches.”\n\n\n\tAs Lia settles into the team’s world, D’Adesky builds a narrative structure that mirrors her evolving sense of identity. “The film is really built on two lines,” he explains. “There’s a moment when she realizes that part of what she imagined about her past isn’t true. That leads her on a kind of quest. And there’s a resonance between what happens in the tournament and what happens in her personal search.”\n\n\n\tFor French-Rwandan actor Sonia Rolland, who plays Lia, portraying someone so disconnected from the country proved an unusual challenge. “I had to build everything,” she says. “I was born in Rwanda, I know the language, I go there several times a year. But Lia left too early, in dramatic conditions, without knowing her story. She has so many questions.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film includes scenes shot in memorial sites and underground crypts, still home to victims’ remains, spaces that pushed Rolland to navigate the line between the character and herself as a Rwandan woman. “It was confusing. I didn’t know if it was the actress or the woman expressing herself,” she says. “It created very strong, very real scenes.”\n\n\tFor D’Adesky, that blurring of emotional lines reflects one of the film’s central ideas. He describes “Kwibuka, Remember” as a work about how the past and present continually intersect. “The particularity of genocide is precisely the fact that its effects last a very, very long time,” he says. “It remains present somewhere, which impacts the present today.” Through the film, he sought to explore how those repercussions move across generations.\n\n\tBoth D’Adesky and Rolland say the film also reflects Rwanda’s broader story of rebuilding in the decades since the genocide. On the question of reconstruction, D’Adesky says, “It must be rebuilt by the Rwandans and not by someone who’s going to come from the outside,” drawing a parallel between Lia’s journey and the country’s own process of recovery.\n\n\tRolland adds that many audiences still underestimate the scale of Rwanda’s transformation. “People can’t imagine how much it took strength and vitality from the people in Rwanda,” she says. “Through the smaller story of Lia, we already understand the great story of Rwanda.”\n\n\tThe film’s title, “Kwibuka,” the Kinyarwanda word for the annual remembrance period, emerged only late in the edit, D’Adesky shares, but ultimately felt inseparable from the story. “You see the word everywhere during the commemoration,” D’Adesky says. “Little by little I found something poetic in the idea of memory and the journey she makes. The double title also resonates with the idea of double identity.”\n\n\tMuch of the film was shot in Rwanda, with roughly 80% of the crew drawn from the country’s growing production sector, a milestone for the local industry. “It is the biggest Rwandan film shot in the country with a Rwandan team,” D’Adesky says. “At the beginning it was complicated, but little by little there was a real progression.” He says building the project within Rwanda was always part of his intention. “Beyond what the film can become, that is already a kind of success.”\n\t\n\n\tRolland sees the production as part of a broader cultural shift. “It shows we’re able to make films that reflect the evolution of the country,” she says. “There’s a will now to support cultural projects, and that Rwanda is a safe, possible shooting destination.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Göteborg Film Festival, unspooling Jan. 23-Feb 1, has unveiled the first heavyweight names who will bring star power to the leading Nordic film festival and industry event. \n\n\tFollowing up on last year’s accolade to Thomas Vinterberg , versatile Swedish actor and producer Noomi Rapace will receive the festival’s coveted Nordic Honorary Dragon Award Jan. 28, to highlight her talent in “captivating audiences around the world with her uncompromising presence and fearless expressive power,” said artistic director Pia Lundberg who added: “Her ability to find and portray what burns, unsettles and moves us cuts straight through the screen.”\n\t\n\n\tRapace whose career spans over nearly two decades and 50 films and series, will be honored with a retrospective spotlighting three of her most significant features: “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” (2009) by Niels Arden Oplev, which proved her international breakthrough garnering a BAFTA nod, the Swedish drama “Beyond” (2010) by Pernilla August and Icelandic horror “Lamb” (2021) by Valdimar Jóhannsson.\n\n\n\tRapace will also attend alongside helmer Teona Strugar Mitevska the Nordic premiere of the buzzy Venice Horizons title “Mother.” “She was no saint” said the actor about her tour-de-force turn on the Catholic saint Mother Theresa in a recent interview with Variety.\n\n\tBesides the Rapace retrospective, an initial handful of pics selected for the Göteborg Film Festival’s 49th edition have been unveiled, including the opener “The Quiet Beekeper,” and four titles, illustrating this year’s overarching theme, “Truth”: Kaouther Ben Hania’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” Petter Næss’s “No Comment,” Kirill Serebrennikov’s “The Disappearance of Josef Mengele” and Jim Sheridan’s “Re-Creation.”\n\t\n\n\t“We live in a time when the very Idea of truth is being put under pressure. Where the boundaries between fact and fiction often become blurred: in news feeds, on social media, and in political rhetoric. With Focus: Truth, we want to explore how film can both reflect and influence our understanding of reality,” said Lundberg.\n\n\tThe anticipated lineup of the 13 competition strands will be unveiled in the coming weeks, but Göteborg revealed Thursday that U.S. heavy-hitter and former Focus Features CEO James Schamus, will both head the jury of the festival’s Ingmar Bergman International Debut Award and head the industry talks.\n\n\tJames Schamus Industry Confab Star GuestKnown for his outstanding collaborations with Taiwanese helmer Ang Lee – notably on “Brokeback Mountain,” “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” and “The Ice Storm” – Schamus. who’s been a mainstay of U.S. indie filmmaking for over three decades, will discuss his creative visions and expansive career as a producer, writer, showrunner, educator, and thinker, as well as his perspective on the current state of the global audiovisual industry.\n\n\t“It’s a true honour to welcome James Schamus,” Göteborg head of industry Josef Kullengård told Variety. “James is one of those rare industry players that have an excellent understanding of what an appealing story is; he has an amazing creative mind and his voice is essential to contextualise what is happening in the industry today. He is in the heart of everything that’s happening in the U.S. industry right now, and still very active,” underscored Kullengård, referring to Schamus’ current gigs as consulting producer on The Duffer Brother’s supernatural series “The Boroughs” and a steady teaching job at Columbia University’s School of the Arts.\n\n\tNew Look Nordic Film MarketSchamus’ on-stage interview on Jan. 28 will be the cornerstone of the slightly revamped industry days, open to attendees both of the TV Drama Vision (Jan. 27-28) and Nordic Film Market (Jan.28-30) in their first overlapping showcase.\n\n\t“As part of Nordic Film Market’s new look, we will move the film pitches and talks from the Biopalatset to the Draken industry hub – home to TV Drama Vision –  to create a more insightful program and better synergies between the two parts of our industry event,” Kullengård explained. “Traditional filmmaking is the part of the audiovisual industry that needs the most innovation and transformation; we want to encourage this,” he said.\n\t\n\n\tThe hot TV Drama Vision, expecting around 700 delegates from more than 30 countries, will in fact fully focus on “One Transformation After Another,” the headline of its 20th edition. “The theme refers to Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” as we feel we’re in constant battle. In our professional and personal life, we’re trying to adjust to the fast-changing reality,” said Kullengård.\n\n\tUnder the helm of program director Cia Edström, TV Drama Vision will turn on the narratives, formats and business models shaping today’s industry, through inspiring panels with 100-plus speakers and around 50 series in development, production and post-production.\n\n\t“We will look into tomorrow’s strategies for co-production, pathways and business models, platform-fluid IP development, audience-first approaches, smarter budgeting and sustainable production, the art of writing great stories and much more,” said a statement. \n\n\tAmong guest speakers will be Katharina Eyssen, creator of Netflix’s Emmy-winning show “The Empress.” Eyssen will be part of a 60-plus German delegation attending the Göteborg industry confab for a special Country Focus on Germany.\n\n\tWatch out this space for details of TV Drama Vision projects, coming up in the next weeks.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt doesn’t take long for Taylor Swift’s Disney+ docuseries “The End of an Era” to get emotional. The first of the series’ six episodes quickly opens a window on something that had stayed publicly unseen until now: just how the pop star reacted behind the scenes to the violence and threat of terrorism that cast a pall on the otherwise joyful experience of the European leg of her Eras Tour in 2024.\n\n\tThe debut episode, which premiered at 3 a.m. ET/midnght PT on Friday morning, gets off to a celebratory start. But it does not waste too much time in getting to a mid-episode segment that documents the tour’s darkest hours. In footage shot at the time, Swift is seen shedding tears and sharing profound anxiety in the wake of two terrifying incidents — a thwarted terrorist plot around her Vienna concerts, and a deadly attack on children attending a dance class in Liverpool.\n\t\n\n\t“I thought that this would be a tour I was very proud of. But this is more than a tour,” she says in Episode 1. “It’s a force to be reckoned with in global culture. So never in my life did I think we would have a terrorist plot.”\n\n\n\tThe three Vienna concerts slated for August of last year were canceled after Austrian officials arrested two men who had plotted to attack Swift’s fans. As her shows in London went on as scheduled after that, she approached the first of those concerts with far more fear and trepidation than she was about to let on, the episode shows.\n\n\t“Basically it’s a weird feeling going into these last five shows in Europe because … we’ve done 128 shows so far,” she says in the 2024 footage, “but this is the first one where I feel like I’m skating on thin ice or something. We just had this series of very violent, scary things happen to the tour. We dodged a massacre situation. There was this horrible attack in Liverpool at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party. And it was little kids that, uh…” At this, she trails off, unable to complete the sentence and say that three children died after being assaulted by a knife-wielding attacker.\n\t\n\n\tA messae on screen says that Swift met with survivors of the Liverpool attack before each of the concerts in London. No footage of those meetings is included, but the cameras do catch Swift saying she will stop crying and become stoic in time to meet the families.\n\n\t“It’s gonna be fine, because when I meet them, I’m not gonna do this. I swear to God, I’m not gonna do this,” she vows. “I’m gonna be smiling.”\n\n\tWhich is an attitude she took into doing the concerts themselves. “Any of this gets out of the way before you ever go upstage. You lock it off for three and a half hours. They don’t have to worry about you. It’s like you’re a pilot flying the plane. And if you were like, ‘Ooh, there’s turbulence up ahead; I don’t know if we’re actually gonna land in Dallas; I’m gonna try hard, but I don’t know if I can actually figure out how to land through this turbulence,’ everyone on the plane’s gonna freak out.” She knows how to navigate a crowd through the friendly skies. “You just have to have a calm, cool, collected tone of, ‘We will be landing in in Dallas at 6:05 p.m. Got a little tubulence up ahead, but it’s nothing we haven’t seen before. Just keep your seat belts fastened and welcome to the Eras Tour.”\n\n\tSwift is seen in the episode getting some help through the buddy system, as Ed Sheeran lifts her spirits and confidence when he arrives to practice a version of their duet “Everything Has Changed,” performed on the first night in London.\n\n\t“It’s very cool that he would come and do this,” she says, “because I think it’s just gonna really delight people, in a moment when a lot of the fans need a pick-me-up, because I know I do.”\n\n\tSwift also gets a pep talk from her mother, Andrea Swift, after admitting that she is “twitchy and fidgety” and her hands are shaky going into the first London gig. After getting through it, she is exultant and, as she puts it, ready to stay back on the horse.\n\n\tBy the end of Episode 1, she is back to being focused on the “euphoria” she sees in her crowds — and the intra-audience visual communication she witnesses from the stage. “There’s so many hundreds of moments of individual eye contact throughout the course of the show. I see the mass quantities of joy that everyone’s feeling. What’s interesting is, there’s some joy in the show, but there’s a lot of emotions in this that aren’t just like ‘Put on your smiley face and come to the Eras Tour.’ It is so much more. You look out in the crowd and these are millions of stories and all these counter-narratives, all colliding in one place where we feel safe to be demonstrative about a whole spectrum of emotion. That stuff is really powerful.\n\t\n\n\t“Life contains multitudes and we are kind of exploring all of the dramatic edges of those things” in the concerts, she believes. “That’s what might be unlocking feelings of joy… feelings of euphoria… and it still gets me. It does.”\n\n\tThe second episode, which is also premiering Friday morning, focuses on more consistently upbeat subject matter, like the creation and execution of the tour’s original choreography and especially a “Tortured Poets Department” segment that was added after that surprise album came out in the spring of 2024.\n\n\tEpisode 2 also spends much more time apart from Swift herself to meet with some of the celebrated members of her Eras Tour team, including choreographer Mandy Moore and fan-beloved dancer Kameron Saunders. (Look for Variety’s coming review of the first two episodes.)\n\n\tSwift premiered these episodes at a morning screening in New York City Tuesday morning, attended by her family and dancers and a handful of members of the media.\n\n\t“It was a year ago yesterday that we played the last show of the Eras Tour,” Swift said in briefly introducing Tuesday’s screening. “It feels insane. I know it does for me… It feels like the Eras Tour was a lifetime within my life, so it’s so crazy to square it with it ending a year ago. And with that said, you know, I think since I started performing when I was 14 years old, I have been obsessed with the idea of trying to learn how to entertain people… All the lessons that I learned over 20-plus years are what it ended up being… And I know that’s the case with not just me, but the dancers and the band and the backing vocalists and our lighting and technical departments and our choreography; everything that went into this was all the lessons we’ve learned all of our lives.”\n\n\tShe continued, “And I think one thing that our amazing directors, Don Argott and Sheena Joyce, who are here did was that they told and expanded upon the stories of not just me, but everyone who was a part of this and their stories and what it took to get them to the place where they’ve learned the lessons that it took to get them on that stage to execute this as well as they did.\n\n\t“But there’s a lot of magic and mystery and destiny and all that stuff,” Swift added. “We can’t explain what happens when something goes as well as this did, but anything that we can explain to you about how we did it, these amazing directors did that. And so I’m so grateful that they put so much time and thought and care into this docuseries.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter Tuesday’s screening of the two episodes concluded, Swift quickly stepped out in the screening room and began making some closing remarks, before being reminded that she was speaking off-mic and not audible to everyone scattered throughout the large screening room at Disney. “I’ve been off tour for a year and I forgot about what microphones do,” she quipped.\n\n\tThe six episodes of “The End of an Era” are being released two at a time in one-week intervals. Episodes 3 and 4, which have not screened, will come out on Disney+ Dec. 19, and the final two will debut Dec. 26.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Red Sea Film Festival closed its fifth edition on Thursday night with a star-studded awards ceremony in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia that saw Akio Fujimoto’s “Lost Land” take home the festival’s top honor, the Golden Yusr for Best Feature Film. The ceremony opened with honorary awards given to Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, Darren Aronofsky and Saudi director Ahd Kamel (“My Driver and I”), with Johnny Depp and Shailene Woodley among the star guests in attendance.\n\t\n\n\t“Lost Land,” the first Rohingya-language feature, follows two young siblings fleeing persecution in Myanmar on a perilous journey to join an uncle in Malaysia. Presenting the Golden Yusr to Fujimoto, Sean Baker, head of the feature jury, said the film “confronts the plight of displaced children with unflinching empathy and poetic urgency.” Top honors also came with a $100,000 cash prize. The film had its world premiere in the Horizons section at Venice this year, where it was awarded the Special Jury Prize.\n\n\n\tThe Silver Yusr for Feature Film went to Palestinian director Cherien Dabis’ “All That’s Left of You.” Jurors said the film “reminds us of our shared humanity with extraordinary tenderness,” calling it “a deeply life-affirming film that moved us profoundly.” The feature traces three generations of a Palestinian family marked by displacement that never loses hope of returning to their ancestral home. Accepting, Dabis called the film’s very existence “an act of resistance.” The Silver Yusr comes with a $30,000 prize.\n\n\tBaker, who presided over the jury that included Riz Ahmed, Naomie Harris, Olga Kurylenko and Nadine Labaki, said the slate of films had themes that “felt urgent and resonant.”\n\t\n\n\tJuliette Binoche earned the Al Sharq Award for Best Documentary for “IN-I: IN MOTION,” marking the Oscar-winner’s first turn as a director. Binoche, who was in Jeddah last week, but wasn’t at the closing, sent remarks crediting the festival for encouraging her new craft.\n\n\tSeo Su-Bin won Best Actress for “The World of Love,” with Kurylenko noting her “remarkable depth that left the jury heartbroken.” George Khabbaz took Best Actor for “Yunan,” with Ahmed praising a performance that “mesmerized us … digging deep to inhabit a lived experience.” The film also nabbed the best director prize of $10,000 for Ameer Fakher Eldon.\n\n\tCyril Aris won Best Screenplay for “A Sad and Beautiful World,” a full circle moment for a project developed in the festival’s Red Sea Labs, with a prize of $10,000.\n\n\tThe Yusr for Cinematic Achievement went to “Nighttime Sounds,” directed by Zhang Zhongchen.\n\n\tSaudi standout “Hijra” by Shahad Ameen won both the Yusr Jury Prize and the Film AlUla Best Saudi Film Award. Harris said of the film, “It illuminates a community and journey that rarely take center stage. Cinema’s power to challenge and to heal is evident here.”\n\n\tIn the shorts competition, the Golden Yusr for Best Short Film and its $25,000 accompanying prize was awarded to “Coyotes” by Said Zagha, while the Silver Yusr went to “Empty Lands” from Egyptian filmmaker Karim Eldon Elalfy. The award comes with a $12,500 cash prize. Jorj Abou Mhaya’s “Jeem 1983” received a Special Mention.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCannes Critics’ Week is highlighting 10 filmmakers – and their 10 projects – during the 12th edition of the Next Step workshop, which comes to a climax with an Industry Day in Paris where cineastes meet with French industry members. This prestigious initiative focuses on the feature debuts of directors who have previously showcased their short films at Critics’ Week.  \n\n\tRunning Dec. 6-12, this year’s Next Step will see directors competing for a newly labelled award, the Next Step Sooner Prize, adjudicated by the new French streaming platform focusing on movies created from the merger of the Filmo and Universciné platforms and launching Jan. 2026. \n\t\n\n\tThe Next Step Sooner Prize will take in a €2,500 ($2,925) grant and an invitation to the Cannes Film Festival. The winner will be announced at Cannes next May. \n\n\n\tBy the end of this week, selected filmmakers will have worked with consultants Yacine Badday, Philippe Barrière, Leyla Bouzid, Juliette Lepoutre, Franco Lolli and Thomas van Zuylen at the Moulin d’Andé, before moving on to Paris. One director will also have the opportunity to take part in a residency at the Moulin d’Andé–CÉCI. \n\n\tAs for details of projects, Estonian director Anna Hints, behind the celebrated “Smoke Sauna Sisterhood,” will unveil “Black Hairy Beast.”\n\n\tSet during a folklore festival, the film sees Indian dancer Mahesh and Estonian journalist Liis fall madly in love. However, as Mahesh tries to find his place in his lover’s country, he sees a shift in his body and identity, awakening a cursed mythological creature. As stated in the Next Step catalog, their love “soon grapples with society’s gaze and the wild instincts they find within.”\n\t\n\n\tThe project is produced by Johanna Maria Tamm and Evelin Penttilä for Stellar Film (Estonia), as well as by Hints herself and Tushar Prakash for Kae Noh. Hints previously joined forced with Prakash on short “Sauna Day.”\n\n\t“Inspired by our own intercultural love story, it follows two people who carry both the pain of ‘being wrong’ and the wild freedom that arrives when you stop trying to fit in. The film dances with opposites: intimacy with grandeur, horror with laughter, irony with pathos,” she added.\n\n\t“Rap merges with ancient chants, Indian and Estonian mythologies collide, creating a space where something visceral, fresh and beautiful can emerge. The film transforms shame and fear into songs and questions how to love ‘the other’ both within ourselves and in someone else.”\n\n\t“At its core, the film is about love set against the expectations and prejudices of culture, gender roles, othering and xenophobia. It’s told through the metaphors of body transformations and reimagining of the musical genre, but not by conforming to it,” Hints told Variety.\n\n\tWith the support of the French production company Barberousse Films, Róisín Burns will present “Happy Hardcore” about a teenager who deserts his post in the midst of the Iraq War and returns to England. On the run, he finds his sister – the person dearest to him. Hunted by the army, he is forced to hide in a tunnel. “Soon, the violence and loneliness he tried to escape catch up with him,” it was revealed. \n\n\tDriven by her childhood memories, Róisín’s cinema explores what it’s like to grow up working-class in Northern England, “where dancing and drinking offer only a fleeting form of escapism.” \n\n\tIn “Nabor,” Marinthia Gutiérrez will go back to 1950s Tijuana, where a girl “discovers love, shame, and family secrets in a home plagued by jealousy and her father’s nights in cabarets.” Amid the turmoil, “her gaze becomes that of a generation awakening, witnessing the end of innocence and the birth of doubt.”\n\n\t“As a filmmaker from Tijuana living in Los Angeles, I’m reaching for a bold, Hollywood-scale auteur film shot on 35mm and 16mm, and told from the inside at a time when Hollywood is struggling to reinvent itself,” noted the director. \n\t\n\n\t“We’re reclaiming our city’s image with an unapologetically analog vision, engraving its memory directly onto celluloid — a love letter to the border and a reminder that cinema can still be physical, visionary, and personal, pointing toward the kind of movies we still believe are possible.”\n\n\tThe film is produced by Melissa Castañeda for Violeta Cine (Mexico), while Lucas Le Postec and Thibault de Gantès are co-producing for L’Heure D’Eté (France). \n\n\tAnother French company, Eddy Cinéma – and Céline Vanlint – will oversee animated “Erika” by Marie Larrivé. Set in 1999, it follows Sylvia, a retired computer engineer who is gravely ill. She has entrusted her life to Dr. Dubois, who, according to rumours in the village, has discovered a miracle cure for cancer. However, Sylvia begins to question her doctor’s methods. \n\n\t“It’s an animated revenge movie set in Brittany in 1999 against the backdrop of the storm of the century and an oil spill. Currently in the treatment stage, we will soon begin work on the storyboard,” said Larrivé.\n\n\tAlso a French film, Carmen Leroi’s “L’Expérience impossible”  is produced by Léa Baggi for Sans Regret and Alexandre Gavras for KG Production. It tells the story of Théo, who is passionately in love with Eve, who is 20 years his senior. When Eve falls seriously ill, Théo is devastated. A strange doctor whom he found to treat Eve sends him back to 2004, where he must live in the body of an alternate version of himself.\n\n\t“In ‘L’expérience impossible,’ there will be a great love story and a journey through time! We will see that love has its rightful moment, meaning that when it’s time, it’s time, and before that time, unfortunately, it wasn’t time yet,” said the director. \n\n\tIn “Story of August,” Robert-Jonathan Koeyers looks at the eponymous teenager who, following her parents’ divorce, spends her holidays with her father in a seaside town in transition. Over time, she uncovers the secrets and silences within her family while searching for her own identity and learning to “face the emotional legacy they have left her and break the cycle of family trauma.”\n\n\tDerk-Jan Warrink and Koji Nelissen are producing for Keplerfilm in the Netherlands. \n\n\t“Told over three turbulent summers, ‘Story of August’ is an intimate 2D animated film rooted in Black joy, the search for a home away from home, and the everyday complexities of growing up,” said Robert-Jonathan, calling such themes “largely underexplored within the field of animation.”\n\t\n\n\tBrazil’s Leonardo Martinelli will spotlight “Fantasma Neon,” in which João, a bicycle delivery worker in Rio de Janeiro, dreams of buying a motorbike to improve his life. Since his mother died, he has become the sole provider of the family. When an accident at work triggers protests, “caught between ambition and loyalty, João discovers the cost of his dreams in a city where singing is also an act of resistance.”\n\n\t“We seek to deepen my exploration of the gig economy through a musical rooted in the streets, blending social struggle with artistic expression in music and dance. Inspired by the many possibilities of the musical genre and attentive to how postcolonial structures shape everyday life, we experiment with cinematic forms that merge choreography, music, and the labor of the people who make the city.”\n\n\tThe project expands Martinelli’s Locarno Golden Leopard-winning short, a searing put-down – part song and dance, shot in lush tones, part near docu realism – of gig economy iniquity. The feature project s the work of Duas Mariola Filmes and Brazilian producers Felipe M. Bragança and Marina Meliande, while Laís Diel and Bruno Ribeiro, and Reduto Filmes, are set to deliver “Saturday in Copacabana.”\n\n\tDirected by Ribeiro, it sees a 30-something pianist, prone to inner turmoil, who runs into an old flame just as a major turning point is looming in her life. “The bustling streets, music, and the memories stir emotions she thought were forgotten. At dawn, she must choose between the comfort of the present and the pull of an unfinished past.”\n\n\t“I want to engage with the playful spirit of Brazil’s 1930s–50s chanchadas, following a restless pianist through one night that plays like a screwball comedy carried by music and romance on the streets of Rio, where different temporalities bleed into each other,” he said.\n\n\t“The goal is to create a dreamlike, character-driven film in which Copacabana itself becomes a shifting stage, populated by the living and by echoes of other eras, and in which a single Saturday night is colored by memory, desire and doubt.”\n\n\tJuan Pablo Villalobos will focus on “Ladrones de cuadros,” produced by Mexico’s Laterna Films and Louise Riousse and co-produced by Charlotte Vande Vyvre for Balade Sauvage Productions. \n\t\n\n\tIn the film, after witnessing a murder, Arcadio – a painter turned delivery man in Mexico City – escapes an attempt on his life and finds refuge at his grandmother’s home in the state of Oaxaca. As the days peacefully pass in the village, he meets a mysterious Finnish art conservator and claims some of his grandmother’s paintings as his own – until the strange killer finally tracks him down.\n\n\t“It’s a contemplative comedy in which a painter going through a crisis bumps into a killer who pushes him back to his roots,” he explained.\n\n\tIn “Pray to the Thunder,” Ananth Subramaniam will take his audience to a Tamil town in Malaysia, dominated by an authoritarian priest. There, a rebellious young woman called Thunder channels her anger by performing with her punk band on the village stage, normally reserved for the priest’s religious processions. \n\n\t“Their music electrifies the youths and stirs the wrath of traditionalists, igniting a confrontation between modernity and superstition. As tensions rise, Thunder discovers a mystical power that threatens to tip this already delicate balance.”\n\n\t“Clashing with her traditional community to fuse rebel spirit with cultural roots, Thunder, a young Malaysian Tamil punk rocker, claims a life that’s truly her own,” he stated.\n\n\tChoo Mun Bel produces for Sixtymac Pictures (Malaysia), while Subramaniam co-produces for Idio Sync Inc. alongside Epicmedia (Philippines), Akanga Film Asia and Dw (France).\n\n\tThe Next Step initiative will continue its collaboration with the SACEM on cinema scoring by inviting composers Florencia Di Concilio, Clémence Ducreux, the Penelopes and Saycet. 2026 will also see the launch of the Next Step Studio, in partnership with DW, with Indonesia taking centre stage in collaboration with KawanKawan Media. \n\n\t“For its 12th edition, Next Step is maintaining its momentum of successful projects coming to fruition,” said Thomas Rosso, Cannes Critics’ Week Programme Manager and Next Step Director. \n\n\t“This class of directors and their projects reflect the commitment to diversity at Cannes Critics’ Week, as curated by Ava Cahen and her committee. Half of the projects are directed by women, with a strong geographical showing for Latin America.” Two projects are from Mexico and two are from Brazil, including one, Ribeiro’s, supported by the Projeto Paradiso Foundation. \n\t\n\n\tThe selection also features “a variety of forms, including two unique animation projects and genres ranging from romantic comedy and social drama to political musicals and magical realism.” The workshop is set to end with an Industry Day in Paris where sales agents, distributors, and French production companies “are expected to attend in large numbers,” he said. \n\n\t“They are demonstrating their trust in our selection process and the vitality of emerging talent.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCannes Critics’ Week\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBandai Namco Entertainment announced the next installment in its beloved flight-shooter franchise “Ace Combat” Thursday to much fanfare during the 2025 Game Awards.\n\n\tTitled “Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve,” the game takes place after the events of “Ace Combat 7” and before “Ace Combat 3.” The title will debut in 2026 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S and for PC via Steam.\n\n\tBefore the show, Bandai Namco Entertainment CEO Nao Udagawa gave Variety a sneak peek at the new game, “Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve,” and some updates on A24’s upcoming “Elden Ring” movie (Disney vet Peter Rice has joined the project) and her overall strategy since taking the helm at the Bandai video game studio.\n\t\n\n\t“The graphics are something that we really, really leaned into heavy for ‘Ace Combat 8’ and visual expression of the sky itself,” Udagawa said. “I think of how the clouds are shown and rendered — I would get different development updates and the developer would show me what the progress is, and every time, wow the sky and the clouds, it’s so amazing, and how it ties into the weather change as well. So I think that’s something the fans are going to really And it is a franchise IP, so certainly the gameplay, I think the fans can know what to expect, so keeping everything that worked really well, but we’re really adding value in the story and the narrative and the sort of cinematic presentation of how it’s delivered. It’s gonna feel like this epic movie that you’ll want to see on a big screen.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBandai Namco Entertainment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBandai Namco Entertainment\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPer Bandai Namco’s description for “Ace Combat 8,” “You’re a fighter pilot, adrift at sea in a rescue boat until the outdated aircraft carrier, Endurance, pulls you aboard. Your homeland’s navy is shattered. The aging vessel, its decks crowded with refugees, has already retreated far from the front lines. It’s July 2029. The Federation of Central Usea (FCU) has fallen under a lightning invasion by the Republic of Sotoa. Most of the nation is occupied, the military is scattered, and the Endurance is just one fragment of what remains. On this ship, you’re given a single name: “Wings of Theve.” A legendary ace, a symbol of hope, a name tied to Theve, the FCU capital. But that legend was a lie, mere propaganda—a story to keep morale alive. Now, you must carry that name and take to the skies again. With three new comrades at your side, fight to reclaim your lost homeland.”\n\t\n\n\tFor development on the new game, Bandai Namco Entertainment launched new studio Bandai Namco Aces, so that the “Ace Combat” franchise team could operate as their own business with one targeted IP focus.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“One thing that I’m looking at right now is really the speed and cycles of development that we have,” Udagawa (who has retained her Chief Pac-Man Officer title since being promoted to the company’s overall CEO in 2021) said about her strategy for Bandai Namco’s game studios. “I think it’s great that we’re developing internally and having these discussions to improve the quality of the experience, but at the end of the day, until something reaches the market, the fans aren’t going to be able to get their hands on it. So translating all of these discussions and healthy development into output quicker is something that I’m looking at while maintaining the quality.”\n\n\tBack in the spring, Bandai Namco Entertainment revealed it is working on a film adaptation of its “Elden Ring” game franchise with A24 and director Alex Garland. Little has been said about the project since, but Udagawa can now share the Hollywood vet Peter Rice has joined the project.\n\n\t“Development right now is steady in terms of the project at the moment and catch, yeah, so we have A24 helming up the project with Alex Garland and Peter Rice — a lot of very well-known names and heavy hitters in the film industry,” Udagawa said. “So we’re very excited right now about how it’s going to shape up. But I think that’s kind of where the development and pre-production is.”\n\n\tAs for what aspect of the “Elden Ring” franchise the movie will focus on, Udagawa can only reveal that the focus for her is on pleasing fans.\n\n\t“Our first priority is really the ‘Elden Ring’ fans, so the fans who have supported the franchise for so long, making it sure that they feel like it’s a great movie and a great experience,” Udagawa said. “And for those who have perhaps not been exposed to the game yet and have seen the film, for them, maybe [thinking,] I’ll try the game to see the world and the perspective from multiple angles and experience it that way.”\n\n\tWatch the teaser for “Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Matlock” is undergoing some changes. \n\n\tIn early October, David Del Rio, who portrays associate Billy Martinez, was removed from the set and fired after a sexual assault allegation. Season 2 was already in production when the incident occurred, and Del Rio had already filmed seven episodes. “Prior Bad Acts,” which aired on Dec. 4, marked his final appearance, showrunner Jennie Snyder Urman confirms to Variety.\n\n\n\tThat episode ended with Billy telling his pregnant girlfriend, “I do want to get married,” an odd-sounding line that appeared to have been mashed together later. While Snyder Urman didn’t confirm that was the case, she said, “I’ll just say there were creative changes that we had to make, and we made them. We’re ending up in a different place than what our plans were, but we really stopped and tried to think about how we can have an exit that makes sense in the world of our show and for the character.”\n\t\n\n\tDuring the Dec. 11 midseason finale, Sarah (Leah Lewis) reveals Billy has taken a personal day from work, then later learns his pregnant girlfriend has had a miscarriage. “His exit will be explained in the course of the next two episodes, and it is really in line with the character and in line with what’s happening with the firm at large,” Snyder Urman says. “We want to remain true to the character.”\n\n\tWhile Snyder Urman said she’s “not able to discuss the events” surrounding the allegations made against Del Rio that led to his firing, she added: “We just sort of plugged in and kept moving forward. We’re just all happy to be back, and focused on the work. I think that’s the thing — we want the show to be great. We want it to be joyful for the audience to watch.”\n\t\n\n\tThough Lewis has never confirmed her involvement with the allegations, after the news broke that Del Rio had been fired, she shared a message via Instagram in which she wrote, “Mom is here, we’re moving forward in love and strength. I’m in good hands. Thank you to everybody for any kind of support and care. Truly, we’re moving forward in strength. Key word, strength. Please, let that be the takeaway.” Del Rio’s wife, in turn, posted and deleted a photo of her and her own mom with text that read, “Mom is here. We’re moving forward in love and strength after what Leah did to our family. Thank you all for the love and support!”\n\n\tOn the show, Lewis’ character is facing a tough road ahead in Season 2, having been she was removed from Olympia’s (Skye P. Marshall) team during the midseason finale after lying to her boss. Plus, the merger is moving full steam ahead, which means no one’s jobs are safe. One positive note? Olympia and Matty (Kathy Bates) are finally back on the same team again.\n\n\t“That relationship is just everything to me,” Snyder Urman said of Matty and Olympia. “If I could headline the back half of the season, it’s joy, because we have so much fun coming in with some new characters, some returning, and then we start flipping cards left and right. There’s a certain amount of joy that that brings, in terms of telling the story and getting answers. And then we get to have Matty and Olympia working together — this intergenerational friendship that was unexpected, but means everything to them both. They look at all these obstacles, but work on them together, which to me is a relief, because I hate writing them in conflict.”\n\n\tPlus, two new characters will be introduced in the back half of Season 2: Sarah Wright Olsen as Gwen, an efficiency expert analyzing the firm; and Henry Haber as Hunter, a younger associate and “total bro.”\n\n\t“Matlock” returns to CBS with new episodes on Thursday, Feb. 26.\n",

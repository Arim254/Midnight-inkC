    "body": "\n\tHow would Matt Remick react to the industry-jolting news that Netflix is buying Warner Bros. and HBO Max?\n\n\tSeth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, executive producers of the Emmy-winning Apple TV comedy “The Studio,” told Variety that they believe their fictional studio executive, played by Rogen in the series, would react with his gut instinct of dread fear.\n\n\t“He’d be scared of it,” Rogen told Variety. “He would be terrified of it. I think he assumes that if you do well, they’re not going to sell off your company, your studio, to a tech company. But I guess he’d be proven wrong in this instance.”\n\t\n\n\tRogen and Goldberg were at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles on Sunday evening for the 18th annual National Arts and Entertainment Awards handed out by the Los Angeles Press Club. Rogen and his wife, Lauren Miller, are receiving the club’s Visionary Award for their charitable work.\n\n\n\tWhen pressed by Variety as to their personal reactions to the $82.7 billion deal that will marry the world’s dominant streamer with Hollywood’s single-largest studio and the HBO Max platform, Rogen said with sincerity: “Absolutely not.” \n\n\tBut Goldberg was game. “I don’t know. Who knows if it even happens,” he told Variety. “I think AMC should buy it,” he said, referring to the world’s largest exhibition chain and the fear in the film business that Netflix will significantly shrink the exhibition windows for Warner Bros. film releases. \n\n\t“That’s my personal opinion. AMC should buy it all. I don’t know how, but they should. No one will see that coming,” Goldberg said. “That would be antithetical to Netflix.”\n\t\n\n\tMore to come\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” stayed on top of China’s weekend box office with RMB818.5 million ($115.3 million), driving its cumulative to RMB3.05 billion ($429 million), according to Artisan Gateway.\n\n\tDaylight Entertainment’s “Gezhi Town,” released Dec. 6, opened in second place with $23.8 million. Directed by Kong Sheng and written by Lan Xiaolong, the film tells the story of displaced civilians who, after the fall of Nanjing during wartime, resettle in a remote mountain town near Yichang only to find peace shattered when Japanese forces arrive. The lead cast includes Xiao Zhan, Zhou Yi Ran and Peng Yu Chang among others. \n\t\n\n\tAniplex’s “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle” placed third with $3.3 million, bringing its China gross to $93.4 million nearly a month into release. Directed by Sotozaki Haruo and produced by ufotable, the film adapts the climactic final arc of Gotouge Koyoharu’s blockbuster manga. Returning voice cast members include Hanae Natsuki, Kitō Akari, Shimono Hiro, and Matsuoka Yoshitsugu. The film follows the Demon Slayer Corps’ all-out assault on Kibutsuji Muzan’s stronghold in a bid to end the war between humans and demons.\n\n\n\t“Under Current,” a Hong Kong crime-thriller from Emperor Motion Pictures, opened in fourth with $1 million. Directed by Alan Mak and starring Aaron Kwok, Simon Yam and Francis Ng, the film centres on a barrister and a police officer who team up to investigate the suspicious death of a charity organisation’s finance chief — exposing corruption and money-laundering at the heart of the group. \n\t\n\n\tParamount’s “The Running Man” rounded out the top five with $600,000. \n\n\tWeekend box office totalled $147.5 million, bringing China’s 2025 year-to-date gross to $6.97 billion, up 22% from 2024.\n",

Apple’s “F1” leans on the visceral roar of engines and the physics of velocity, elevating what could have been standard sports bombast into a textured experience.\n\n\tUniversal’s “Wicked: For Good” showcases how musically driven films can compete with the loudest blockbusters (although the CCA snub for best sound stings a little).\n\n\tFranchise-heavy contenders also loom large. Paramount’s final installment of Ethan Hunt’s ongoing missions, “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,” and 20th Century Studios’ latest look at the world of Pandora, “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” arrive with trademark sonic ambition. Tactile stunt environments define the former, while the latter, shaped by veteran artisans, is determined by the aural ecosystems of water and fire.\n\n\tEven character-driven dramas like A24’s “Marty Supreme” and 20th’s “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” remind voters that quiet can be competitive when it’s emotionally calibrated.\n\n\tWatch out for Apple’s “The Lost Bus” and Netflix’s “Frankenstein” — both of which add intrigue and a level of passion that can occupy the branch members. \n\n\tOscars shortlist voting begins Dec. 8.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited artisans are subject to change, and are ultimately determined by the Academy.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Apple TV+\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Ross Ferguson\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Artisans (Best Sound)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Filmes da Ermida, Cannes Film Festival\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

It’s an incredible reimagining of gothic horror that’s anchored in the physicality of ships and machinery. \n\n\tOscar winner Hannah Beachler (“Black Panther”) and Monique Champagne’s work on Ryan Coogler’s “Singers” immerses viewers in a textured 1930s milieu, blending historical authenticity with heightened, morally charged atmosphere. \n\n\tMarvel’s “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” adds a different dimension, offering a retro-futurist canvas where past and future collide through the sleek, stylized environments of Kasra Farahani and Jille Azis.\n\n\tThe category widens beyond the most obvious. \n\n\tUniversal’s “Wicked: For Good” is the reigning champion from last year, showcasing Nathan Crowley and Lee Sandales’ vibrant expansion of Oz. At the same time, A24’s “Marty Supreme” finds the still Oscar-less Jack Fisk and Adam Willis grounding a character study in minimalist yet evocative 1950s New York City.\n\n\tEpic world-building continues with James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” from Dylan Cole, Ben Procter and Vanessa Cole, and Focus Features’ “Hamnet,” constructed by Fiona Crombie and Alice Felton’s intimate, Tudor-period textures. \n\n\tThere will be more to come on this front.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited artisans are subject to change, and are ultimately determined by the Academy.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Warner Bros.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Searchlight Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Artisans (Best Production Design)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©MGM/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "description": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump on Sunday confirmed he recently met with Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos at the White House to discuss the Warner Bros. Discovery",
    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump on Sunday confirmed he recently met with Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos at the White House to discuss the Warner Bros. Discovery deal — and said the market share of a combined Netflix with WB and HBO Max “could be a problem.”\n\n\tTrump, speaking with reporters on the red carpet of the Kennedy Center Honors event in Washington, D.C., said Netflix’s deal to acquire Warner Bros. studios and streaming business will require a review, and said, “I’ll be involved in that decision.” \n\t\n\n\tTrump is upending decades of tradition with his decision to host Sunday’s 48th Kennedy Center Honors ceremony, where the honorees are Sylvester Stallone, KISS members Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley and Peter Criss, singer-actor Michael Crawford, country superstar George Strait and disco diva Gloria Gaynor. He told the crowd gathered for the most prestigious event on Washington’s arts calendar that he didn’t know why he decided to host.\n\n\n\t“I’m acting like Johnny Carson,” Trump quipped as he spoke from behind a podium with the Presidential seal — a first for the ceremony. Highlights of the event will be telecast Dec. 23 as a primetime special on CBS.\n\n\tIn typical fashion, befitting his roots as a real estate developer, Trump also declared, “We’re bringing this building back to life.” Trump was quick to execute a top-to-bottom makeover of Kennedy Center staff this past spring, after his odds-defying return to the White House.\n\n\tTrump was upbeat as he opened the event and steered clear of slinging barbs at political foes. However, he did nod to the shift in the wind for Washington, D.C.’s social elite: “Many of you are miserable, horrible people,” he asserted.\n\t\n\n\tTrump was on stage to introduce the first award presentation to Stallone, a Hollywood legend and MAGA-friendly celebrity. Trump then took his seat in the Kennedy Center auditorium box typically reserved for the Commander in Chief. The award introduction for Crawford was done via video in a pre-recorded segment with Trump speaking from the Oval Office.\n\n\tThe Kennedy Center kudo has long been one of the most prestigious laurel for entertainment figures to receive. The traditional KenCen ceremony includes lengthy clip packages and retrospectives that put the honorees influence and culture impact into context.\n\n\tThis time around, there was no such video tribute to Stallone. Longtime Kennedy Center Honors producers Done + Dusted bowed out of producing this years’ ceremony after Trump unceremoniously dismissed KenCen’s board chairman, Carlyle Group chairman David Rubenstein, and KenCen president Deborah Rutter.\n\n\tStallone was saluted through testimonials delivered by Kurt Russell, Neal McDonough, Garrett Hedlund and his brother, Frank Stallone.\n\n\tIn his remarks on the red carpet, Trump said that the government review of Netflix’s proposed $83 billion deal for Warner Bros., which was announced Friday, must “go through a process, and we’ll see what happens.”\n\n\tAccording to Trump, Sarandos visited the Oval Office last week. The Netflix exec is “a fantastic man,” the president said. “I have a lot of respect for him, but it’s a lot of market share.”\n\n\tTrump also said of Sarandos, “He’s a great person… He’s got a lot of interesting things happening aside from what you’re talking about, but it is a big market share. There’s no question about it. It could be a problem.”\n\n\tThe blockbuster pact would add HBO Max to Netflix’s already massive customer base of more than 300 million. As of the end of Q3, Warner Bros. Discovery reported 128.0 million streaming subscribers, which includes HBO Max as well as Discovery+ and its sports-streaming services.\n\n\tThe Netflix deal for Warner Bros. is both a horizontal merger between rival streaming services and a vertical merger, adding a massive distribution pipeline for Warner Bros. content. It could also shrink the marketplace for content producers. \n\n\tThe Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are expected to review the Netflix-WB deal. The FCC is not expected to play a role in reviewing the transaction because of the nature of assets involved; WBD does not own broadcast TV stations or cable systems.\n\t\n\n\tSarandos, speaking on a call with Wall Street analysts Friday, expressed optimism that the deal will clear regulatory approval. Netflix and WBD projected the deal will close in 12-18 months. \n\n\t“[We are] really confident that we’re going to get all the necessary approvals that we need,” Sarandos told analysts. “This deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it’s pro-creator, it’s pro-growth.”\n\n\tExecs routinely point out on Netflix earnings calls that even in its most mature markets, including the U.S., Netflix represents less than 10% of total TV viewing.

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 1, Episode 7 of “It: Welcome to Derry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tIf there was ever any speculation that the horrors explored in HBO’s “It: Welcome to Derry” were purely supernatural, Episode 7 put those questions to rest. After a flashback cold open that shows the origins of Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgård), the episode picks up where the previous one left off, with a gun-wielding, mask-wearing mob of the eponymous town’s white citizens infiltrating the Black Spot: a hangout for the Black soldiers on Derry’s military base, and a hideout for the town’s falsely accused fugitive, Hank Grogan (Stephen Rider).\n\t\n\n\tThe white mob breaks into the Black Spot looking for Grogan, and a standoff ensues when the club’s patrons draw their own guns. The tension is briefly broken when the mob lowers their weapons and retreats, but the relief is temporary, as they lock the doors from the outside, throw Molotov cocktails into the building and riddle its walls with bullets.\n\n\n\tThe shoot-off continues as the Black Spot burns down with dozens of people inside — many of them central characters in the series, including most of the main ensemble of children. It is a raw and violent sequence, expanded upon from a brief chapter in Stephen King’s original “It” novel.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs it is in the novel, the scene showcases the grounded horrors taking place in Derry, but they are made even more eerie by the ghostly apparitions that soon crowd the massacre. Because Pennywise feeds on the town’s fear, he obviously shows up amid the terrifying event. Meanwhile, because the telekinetic Dick Hallorann (Chris Chalk) is present in the fire, he witnesses hordes of spirits appear as ill-fated souls enter the afterlife all around him.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s a fusion of real and metaphorical terrors that come together in a harrowingly powerful scene that elevates “Welcome to Derry” to new heights. Variety caught up with the series’ executive producer and Episode 7 director Andy Muschietti over email to talk about his artistic and thematic approach to the show’s most impactful scene yet.\n\t\n\t\tThe massacre at the Black Spot is a small, but memorable part of Stephen King’s “It” novel. Did you always anticipate adapting and expanding upon it as a pivotal part of “Welcome to Derry”?\t\n\n\tIn the big ocean that is the book, the Black Spot seems small, but it’s actually a very substantial event in the interludes. Since we’re basing the show on the interludes, we really wanted to show the events of the Black Spot and use it as a guideline. Apart from a dramatic low point, it is a guideline that leads our characters towards a catastrophic conclusion, or, if not a conclusion, a big pivotal point in the story.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you decide on the suspenseful pacing of the scene, having the stand-off followed by brief relief before the horrors begin?\t\n\n\tI wanted to do justice to the book in terms of the horror and the atrocities that are experienced. I wanted to not only create tension and suspense on the build up, but also when the whole thing goes off. We wanted to create the impression that we are locked inside with the rest of the people. That’s why the perspective doesn’t leave the room. There is a bit of a oner that basically follows several characters as the panic spreads with the fire. It’s a really tough scene to watch and was a very tough scene to shoot, but I really wanted to stay true to the intensity of that part of the book.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow much of the set design was practical and how much was digital? Of course, people weren’t actually getting burned, but did you use any real fire? Did you actually destroy the Black Spot set?\t\n\n\tThe burning of the Black Spot happened mainly on two big sets. One of them is the set of the Black Spot where we shot several scenes before. The second one is a more open place used for the part where chaos prevails and everything is on fire. I wanted to create confusion. I wanted to put the audience in the driver’s seat of that catastrophe and give the impression that you are lost and you don’t know where the door is. \n\t\n\n\tThat second part was shot in a place that didn’t have walls. For all the running, all the confusion, all the mayhem that you see, I wanted to create a place where you couldn’t recognize anything. It’s curious, because set No. 1 and set No. 2 are sort of fused in one of the shots. You can actually see it if you pay attention; you can see how we go from the set to a place that is engulfed in flames. There was practical fire, but we could not put actors in harm’s way, so a lot of it is not practical. Following the safety regulations, we used practical fire for stuff in the foreground and in the distance. The rest is made in post-production. Regarding the general performance, we had our actors perform as if they are struggling in these conditions, but also we had a bunch of background performers that were stunt-trained special performers.\n\t\n\t\tHow do you approach directing a kinetic scene like this, where there are lots of people reacting chaotically? Do you allow people to improvise, or are you choreographing every individual?\t\n\n\tIt was a challenging sequence to film, because you’re trying to convey chaos and panic and a lack of control. But of course, you had to choreograph every single second of it, and that’s what we did. The choreography took us probably two days of designing the whole sequence. The oner was a very challenging shot to achieve, because it basically starts with the first Molotov cocktail that sets the fire. Then people panic. They start running in all directions and the camera has to follow certain characters and then transition towards the action of other characters and then pan out to the ceiling, where it’s on fire before we fall back and someone takes us to another corner. It was an interesting challenge to execute. Everybody had to be on point. We had the camera department, the cast, special effects and stunt teams all working to make this incredibly complex scene. It’s very choreographed, but it had to look real and chaotic. I think the chaos was achieved. And I’m very proud of all of what we did there. Everything that needed to be choreographed was choreographed. Even in the background, people knew what they had to do. \n\n\tOf course, there are moments of improvisation. Because it’s a scene with heightened emotion, people do things that were not planned. There were things that didn’t happen as expected, but then everything fell back in line. It’s a great thing about making movies: accidents happen. I don’t mean accidents like something bad happens, but something unexpected. There was a lot of that.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow long did the sequence take to film?\t\n\n\tIt took us like four or five days to shoot. It wasn’t easy.\n\t\n\t\tWhat do you think audiences will take away from this scene within the broader series?\t\n\n\tWe shot this in a very visceral way. It’s a very first person experience. We wanted to get the audience to feel what being trapped in this place would be like. Dramatically, that was the intent. Thematically, we wanted to convey the idea that the worst things that happen in this world are often caused by us humans and that we are capable of inflicting pain and hate and horror in each other, just as much or more than the monster is.\n\n\tThis interview has been lightly edited for Variety’s style\n",

    "body": "\n\tKristen Stewart is weighing in on the Method acting debate.\n\n\t“The Chronology of Water” director recently told the New York Times that acting is by nature “quite embarrassing and unmasculine,” and that going Method is a way for some male actors to temper the “inherently vulnerable” side of being a performer.\n\n\t“Performance is inherently vulnerable and therefore quite embarrassing and unmasculine,” Stewart said. “There’s no bravado in suggesting that you’re a mouthpiece for someone else’s ideas. It’s inherently submissive. Have you ever heard of a female actor that was method?”\n\t\n\n\tThe comment was part of a larger conversation about Marlon Brando’s famous mispronunciation of “Krpton” in 1978’s “Superman.” The interviewer recalled Sean Penn, who knew Brando, saying it was his way of maintaining integrity while appearing in a “sellout movie.” Stewart said that men in Hollywood are often “aggrandized for retaining self” while women don’t get the same treatment.\n\n\t“Brando sounds like a hero, doesn’t he? If a woman did that, it would be different,” she said. “If you have to do 50 push-ups before your close-up or refuse to say a word a certain way — I mean, Brando, [expletive], I’m not coming for him.”\n\n\tShe continued. “There’s a common act that happens before the acting happens on set: If they can protrude out of the vulnerability and feel like a gorilla pounding their chest before they cry on camera, it’s a little less embarrassing. It also makes it seem like a magic trick, like it is so impossible to do what you’re doing that nobody else could do it.”\n\t\n\n\tStewart then recalled a conversation that reaffirmed her belief that actresses aren’t given the same liberties when it comes to their craft.\n\n\tShe explained, “I asked a fellow actor: ‘Have you ever met a female actor that was method and needed to scream and do a whole thing?’ As soon as I said, ‘male actor, female actor,’ the reaction was like, ‘Do not mention the elephant in the room.’ And he goes, ‘Oh, actresses are crazy.'”\n\n\tRead Stewart’s entire New York Times profile here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from Season 2, Episode 4 of “Landman,” “Dancing Rainbows,” which premiered Sunday, Dec. 7, on Paramount+.\n\n\tRebecca Falcone is one of the most no-nonsense characters on “Landman”: A tough-as-nails lawyer who not only wants to keep up with her larger-than-life opponents in the oil game, but beat them into submission as well. That’s why it was fun to see her have a romantic spark with oil guy Charlie (Guy Burnet) on a turbulent private plane ride. While it’s great to see her crush opponents in the boardroom, seeing a softer side of the character opens her up to new dimensions and possibilities on the show.\n\t\n\n\tKayla Wallace, who plays Rebecca, told Variety she didn’t realize going into this season that audiences would see her character’s private life in this way.\n\n\n\t“We were receiving scripts as we went along this season, so I didn’t know what to expect,” Wallace said. “I had no idea what was coming. That was so much fun, too, because every script that you get, you’re reading it like the audience, and having to shift and mess around with the way you’re playing things, because you have this new information coming.”\n\n\tDespite Charlie being a charming hunk, Wallace said she was also intrigued by their plane connection, as they are such different personalities.\n\n\t“He’s got this energy that is so opposite from the way she is, and especially in that situation, when they hop on the plane, and her anxiety starts to ramp up, he’s the cool cucumber that she needs, and he’s sitting right there,” she said. “It’s pretty funny that these two opposites are placed right next to each other and experiencing what Rebecca thinks is a disaster. For him, it’s just another day on the job.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen it came to the pair’s hungover and barely dressed morning after hooking up, Wallace said the flirty scene pushed Rebecca out of her routine.\n\n\t“It’s a very uncomfortable situation for her, but she’s so strong that she can handle it,” she said. “With Rebecca, for all of her career, she has had success at the very top of any priority over anything in her life. When she lets her guard down and ends up in this situation, it’s a bit jarring for her. It’s so much fun because you get to explore these new sides of her. ‘How would she react in this situation?’ As an actor, getting to play these vulnerable sides to her is a lot of fun as well, because it makes her more human.”\n\n\tUltimately, Wallace said this new chapter for Rebecca is just the latest great twist from “Landman” co-creator Taylor Sheridan, who has written every episode of the series.\n\n\t“I love how strong he writes all of his women, and how beautifully loud they are in who they are,” she said. “He writes these women who are unapologetically themselves. We’ve got such a range on our show, too. Such different types of women, and they’re all so strong in their own way, but so different from one another. I’m honored I get to play a character that Taylor has written, because all of his female parts are written with so much strength.”\n\n\tRelive Rebecca and Charlie’s chaotic meet-cute in the clip below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTed Sarandos scored a critical sit-down with President Donald Trump in the weeks leading up to Netflix‘s successful $82.7 billion agreement to buy Warner Bros. and HBO Max, according to sources familiar with the confab. The meeting, which took place in the Oval Office and lasted for more than an hour, occurred on Nov. 24.\n\n\tThe conversation was intended to cover a range of topics, including the possibility of a federal film tax incentive. However, sources say, much of the talk was about Netflix’s bid for Warner Bros. and HBO Max. A spokesperson for Netflix declined to comment. \n\t\n\n\tSarandos’ meeting with Trump was initially reported by Bloomberg, which said that the Netflix co-CEO left the gathering with “the impression” the streamer “wouldn’t face immediate opposition [to its Warner Bros. bid] from the White House.” Netflix still needs to obtain regulatory approval for the purchase, with critics, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, already raising antitrust concerns.\n\n\n\tThey are joined by many parts of the creative community. Although some figures, including Oscar-winners Sean Baker and Jane Fonda, have raised concerns about the deal, several A-list filmmakers and producers are discussing releasing an open letter opposing the sale, sources say. They are worried that by swallowing up Warner Bros., the streamer will take one of the biggest theatrical distributors off the board, imperiling the financial health of cinemas. However, many of these artists also have projects at Netflix or deals with the company and worry about blowback. The hope is that they can attract enough signatories that there will be safety in numbers.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix outmaneuvered Paramount-Skydance, which had been heavily favored to buy Warner Bros. because of David Ellison’s family ties to the president and enormous wealth, as well as Comcast, which also made a bid. Paramount-Skydance has signaled that it may take legal action, accusing Warner Bros. of running an unfair bidding process. \n\n\tSarandos and his wife, former U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas Nicole Avant, have hosted several Democratic fundraisers over the years, including for former President Joe Biden. But Sarandos has made overtures to Trump’s world. Late last year, the Netflix chief made the trek to Mar-a-Lago to have dinner with Trump ahead of his inauguration.\n\n\tWhile speaking to CNN at the Kennedy Center Honors, Trump confirmed that he recently spoke with Sarandos and called him “a great person.” He also asserted that he will “be involved” with the decision to either approve or block the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal. \n\n\tIn an interview with Variety last spring, Sarandos declined to give details about their meeting, calling it a “private” meal. Asked if he would ever do a creative project with the Trumps, as the company has done with former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, whose Higher Ground has a deal with Netflix, Sarandos demurred.\n\n\t“I don’t know what he does creatively,” he said. “He’s got his hands full.”\n",

Paul Thomas Anderson’s epic has now swept major critics’ groups — including Los Angeles, New York and the National Board of Review. With Anderson picking up multiple directing prizes and Teyana Taylor and Benicio del Toro scoring in supporting races, the Warner Bros. juggernaut has become the season’s gravitational force.\n\n\tBut the critics haven’t anointed a single narrative, at least in the acting races. Ethan Hawke’s transformative work in “Blue Moon” earned LAFCA’s gender-neutral lead prize, pushing him firmly into best actor contention opposite heavyweights Leonardo DiCaprio (“One Battle After Another”) and Timothée Chalamet (“Marty Supreme”). Rose Byrne, meanwhile, continues her astonishing sweep, winning NBR, NYFCC and LAFCA for “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” and placing her on the doorstep of her first Oscar nomination.\n\n\tInternational cinema is rewriting the board with Wagner Moura’s surge for “The Secret Agent,” and Jafar Panahi’s continued dominance with “It Was Just an Accident” signal that multiple Neon titles could crowd the international feature lineup, unless a surprise challenger sneaks through.\n\n\tWith the crafts races tightening (and Oscar shortlist voting getting ready to kick off on Monday, Dec. 8), we find “Train Dreams” is gaining momentum in cinematography, with “Sirāt” emerging as an original score spoiler if voters get to it in time.\n\n\tThe first chart projections for production design and sound are below.\n\n\tTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (films): “One Battle After Another” (14); “Sinners” (13); “Hamnet” (10); “Frankenstein” (9); “Wicked: For Good” (8)\n\n\tTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (studios): Warner Bros.

He jokes he even thought he killed the beloved Royal Shakespeare Company as a result.\n      \n    \n          Obviously, it's all just a silly superstition ... and, Bailey's career hasn't suffered too much because of his mistake -- since he's receiving pretty much universal praise for his performance as Fiyero in \"Wicked\" and its sequel \"Wicked: For Good.\"\n      \n    \n          Still, Bailey may want to watch his words going forward ...

    "body": "\n\tGal Gadot was honored with the Hollywood Icon Award by the Women’s Guild Cedars-Sinai at the Snow Ball gala on Thursday night in Beverly Hills.\n\n\tThe “Wonder Woman” star thanked the hospital’s doctors, nurses and caregivers who saved her and her baby daughter Ori’s lives.\n\n\t“Last year, my life took an unexpected turn,” Gadot said. “I was eight months pregnant, juggling family, work and everything in-between when I started to feel the kind of headache that makes the world stop for three weeks.”\n\t\n\n\tHer mother convinced her to go for an MRI on Feb. 5, 2024. “Before we even got back home, my phone rang, and my doctor said, ‘You need to come to the hospital right now. It’s serious. You have a massive brain clot,’” Gadot recalled about being diagnosed with cerebral venous thrombosis or CVT. “From that moment, I just could not understand anything. English was out the window. My husband was speaking to different doctors, and all I could think was, am I going to die? Is this how it feels before you die? Are they going to be able to save me?…Is the baby going to be okay?’”\n\n\n\tWithin three hours, doctors delivered Ori. “The next morning, while my husband held our tiny newborn, my incredible doctors performed the procedure that saved my life, and when I woke up, I realized that I had been given two gifts, one in my arms, Ori and one in my heart, a second chance,” Gadot said. “Cedars-Sinai, you gave me that chance.”\n\n\tGadot’s physician, Dr. Shlee Song, presented her with the award.\n\n\t“I’ve come to learn that Cedars-Sinai was founded in 1918 by members of the Jewish community in Los Angeles, at a time when Jewish patients and Jewish doctors faced discrimination and were often denied equal medical care,” Gadot said. “This hospital was born from resilience, from unity, and from the belief that every human deserves dignity, safety and healing. So to stand here tonight more than a century later, being recognized as an Israeli, as a Jewish woman, especially in a world that sometimes feels very divided and filled with hate, it means the world to me.\n\t\n\n\t“It reminds me that light endures, compassion endures, healing endures and today, this hospital, which began as a response to exclusion, has become one of the leading medical centers in the world, a place where everyone is welcome, everyone is cared for, everyone is treated with humanity.”\n\n\tGadot concluded her speech with a PSA of sorts: “Through this journey, I learned something that every woman, everyone actually, should remember — if your body whispers that something is wrong, listen. If your heart says, ‘This doesn’t feel right,’ trust it. Advocating for yourself isn’t weakness. It’s an act of love.”\n\n\tGadot first revealed and detailed the life-threatening ordeal in an Instagram post in December.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMarjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand who broke with President Trump over the Epstein files, announced Friday that she will resign from Congress.\n\n\tTrump withdrew his support for Greene last week, calling her “wacky” and a “lunatic,” and saying that he would support a primary challenge against her.\n\n\t“Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Green is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!” he posted on TruthSocial.\n\n\n\tIn her resignation letter, Greene said that Trump’s comments about her were “hurtful.”\n\t\n\n\t“Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,” she wrote.\n\n\n\tGreene was among a handful of Republicans who joined with Democratic lawmakers to push for the release of FBI files pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein, despite Trump’s opposition. That effort led to near-unanimous passage this week of a law to force the disclosure of the Epstein files.\n\n\tGreene has also been critical of Republican leadership’s handling of the government shutdown. In her resignation letter, Greene alleged that the “Political Industrial Complex of both parties parties is ripping this country apart.”\n\n\tShe said she did not want to endure a primary battle only to see Republicans lose the House next year, and be faced with the prospect of defending Trump from another impeachment. She said her resignation will take effect Jan. 5.\n\n\tGreene, from Georgia, was first elected in 2020. She rocketed to fame as a Trump supporter who promoted a variety of conspiracy theories.\n\t\n\n\tIn recent months, she has taken a series of stands at odds with her party. During the shutdown, Greene expressed openness to maintaining tax credits for health insurance. Earlier this month, she appeared on “The View” — a liberal bastion — and pitched herself as a bipartisan figure.\n\n\t“I have no problems pointing fingers at everyone,” she said. “I think both parties have failed.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGeorge Clooney had an enraptured London crowd in stitches Friday, taking comedic jabs at President Trump and Brad Pitt, while also sharing the devastating put-down he received from his son recently. Clooney, whose latest film “Jay Kelly” was released in theaters earlier this month, was in conversation with Scottish broadcaster Edith Bowman at the British Film Institute’s large theater on the south bank of the River Thames.\n\n\tLooking back at his first film with the Coen Brothers, “O Brother, Where Art Thou?,” he joked that “they like to make me out to be, you know, just a pure knucklehead in every film.” He recalled how nervous he felt when he shot his first scene, in which he gets the shit beaten out of him by John Goodman. “Joel came over and goes, ‘Yeah, that’s great. It’s just, you know, you’re not dumb. You’re the smartest guy in every room you walk into’ – which, of course, is what I should have thought of as an actor. I should have understood that dumb people don’t think they’re dumb. They think they’re smart. You know, we have a President to prove that.”\n\t\n\n\tDiscussing “Good Night, and Good Luck,” which he directed, co-wrote and acted in, he explained that he was prompted to make the film because of the Iraq War, which was “a pretty shameful moment in our history when the three branches of government – the judicial, the executive and the legislative branches – all failed in their job.”\n\n\n\tReminding the audience that he was “the son of a newsman,” he continued, “The Fourth Estate, meaning journalism, has the responsibility to question authority, has to, and when it doesn’t – it didn’t and it failed – we end up in a war in Iraq, a war of choice.”\n\t\n\n\tHe also mentioned the flak he received for criticizing the war. “And it’s funny too, by the way, they protested against me. There was only about five of us that came out at that point. People forget that. The government put me on a deck of cards, called it a deck of traitors. They picketed my movies, put me on TV shows, and all this shit, and those exact same people now they all talk about how bad that war was, so it’s like, ‘Fuck off.’”\n\n\tHe added, “So I wrote ‘Goodnight, Good Luck,’ because I wanted to talk about when journalism, when the Fourth Estate, stood up to a populist, stood up to a bad idea when it wasn’t convenient, and when it was difficult to do and when it mattered.”\n\n\tAlthough he didn’t play the lead role of Edward R. Murrow in the film, he did in a stage version on Broadway earlier this year. “It was fun to do it, and there was a different urgency to do the play this spring. It felt like we were talking about things now that, you know … the idea of telling the truth and speaking truth to power is more important than ever. Truth is more negotiable than ever.\n\n\t“There’s a line in this that Murrow said, this isn’t my writing, ‘We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. You must remember always that accusation is not proof, and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine and remember that we are not descended from fearful men, not from men who fear to write, to speak or to associate with people whose ideas for the moment are unpopular.’\n\n\t“It was important to say those words,” he said to warm applause from the London crowd.\n\n\tAt the end of the play, he said, “Murrow looks out at the audience and says, ‘What are you prepared to do?,’” and some in the New York audience, he said, shouted back, “Resist!” He added, “It’s an interesting thing to remember that each of us, each one of us, our voices, have to matter, and being silent is not an option.”\n\n\tAsked about the challenges of being a movie star, he mentioned that he had to watch what he said. “Every opportunity to have an interview or to have a conversation could result in the end of your career. You know, I’m not on Twitter or Instagram or any of that bullshit because … I drink. You know, 3 a.m., my Mother Teresa joke might not play so well when I wake up the next day.”\n\t\n\n\tHe added that his children keep him grounded. “My son, for Halloween, dresses up as Batman. He has no idea that I’m Batman. And I said, ‘You know, I was Batman,’ and he’s like, ‘Err … no.’ He has no idea how right he is.”\n\n\tClooney made repeated references to his age, 64. He joked that in the upcoming “Ocean’s 14,” starring Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts, “we are all in wheelchairs.’” He later added, “It is like, you know, all the things we used to be able to do that we can’t do anymore […] It’s gonna be like ‘The Golden Girls.’ […] So, we’re looking forward to that, and I’m not sure when we start that yet. It’s about getting the schedule going, and we also have to take all of the budget and give it to Brad, now that he’s had a hit. He’s hard to live with, you guys.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOver the course of about two hours, Michael B. Jordan relived his 25 years as an actor.\n\n\t“Nobody warns you how crazy this is to see your whole career flash before your eyes,” Jordan said, wiping tears away as he accepted the 39th American Cinematheque Award from his longtime collaborator Ryan Coogler on Thursday night. \n\n\tIt had been an emotional day for Jordan, who spent the morning saluting his friend, the late Chadwick Boseman. The “Black Panther” star, who died in 2020, received a posthumous star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame. Jordan also has a slice of real estate on that famed stretch of sidewalk — his star was unveiled in 2023 — so he’s well-aware of how poignant that moment can be. But as he listened to Coogler, Viola Davis and Boseman’s wife Simone Ledward-Boseman speak, Jordan tried to remain “even-keeled” amid all the emotion.\n\t\n\n\t“It made you reflect and think about time. The time that you have and what you do with that time,” Jordan told Variety on the red carpet at the Beverly Hilton. About the serendipity of the two events taking place just hours apart, he added: “I wouldn’t want to share this day, this moment, with anyone else. I’m actually so happy that it happened on the same day. I’ll never forget it.”\n\n\n\tThe American Cinematheque tribute chronicled Jordan’s achievements in cinema and television over the decades — from his earliest roles (think “The Wire,” “Friday Night Lights,” “All My Children” and his first movie, “Hardball”) to his breakthrough performance in Coogler’s indie drama “Fruitvale Station,” which established Jordan as a movie star to watch. Then came roles in box office blockbusters like “Black Panther” and three “Creed” movies — plus he directed “Creed III” — culminating with this year’s massive hit “Sinners.” Next, Jordan directs, produces and stars in a new version of “The Thomas Crown Affair.”\n\t\n\n\t“As we’ve watched his career blossom and grow, each performance gets better and better. And when I first saw ‘Sinners,’ I said, ‘That’s the best work yet,'” his father, Michael A. Jordan, told Variety. \n\n\t“It wasn’t an overnight thing,” his mother, Donna Jordan, pointed out. “I’ve seen so much of what he did to put the work in. His work ethic is amazing, and I’m most proud of that.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichael B. Jordan poses on the red carpet with his mother Donna Jordan, sister Jamila Jordan-Theus, brother Khalid Jordan and father Michael A. Jordan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEarl Gibson III\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichael B. Jordan poses with Tessa Thompson and Ryan Coogler.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Sinners” breakout talent Miles Caton, Grammy winner Raphael Saadiq and Oscar winning composer Ludwig Göransson perform “I Lied to You,” an original song from the hit film.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBefore Jordan’s tribute, NBC Universal chief Donna Langley honored the Motion Picture Association’s Charles H. Rivkin with the Power of Cinema Award, presented by Hill Valley. Onstage, Rivkin, who was accompanied by his colleagues at the MPA and his son, Eli, cracked before the crowd of studio heads and industry executives: “Let’s face it, like the rest of us, myself included, they’re really here to see Michael B. Jordan.” \n\n\tIndeed, the A-list lineup of presenters confirmed that the entertainment industry loves Jordan. Ben Affleck kicked off the kudos by sharing how, after watching “Fruitvale Station,” he’d reached out to the young actor to offer advice about navigating a rapidly accelerating career. \n\n\t“In retrospect, it’s clear to me those conversations were much more valuable to me,” Affleck admitted. The Oscar winner also ribbed Jordan’s parents about giving him that name when the other Michael Jordan was already on his way to a legendary basketball career. “This was not an exercise with low expectations,” he quipped, but Jordan has lived up to the moniker.\n\n\tThe parade of Oscar winners continued with Mahershala Ali, who introduced a clip package from Jordan’s first works: “A time before Michael was a multi-hyphenate actor, producer, director; before he became one of the most sought-after leading men and bachelors of Hollywood, a time we all affectionately refer to as the ’90s,” he cracked. \n\n\tThen, Octavia Spencer recalled playing Jordan’s mother in “Fruitvale Station” and how, when the film ran into financing issues, she became an executive producer on the project. “When you take an inspired and culturally important script and you add a supreme talent like Michael, who I always say is a brilliant character actor with a beautiful, leading man’s face, you make more than a lasting impression; you make a movie that withstands the test of time,” she said.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBen Affleck and Octavia Spencer speak onstage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Kaluuya presents onstage. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDaniel Kaluuya (“Black Panther”) described Jordan as “a human torch in real life,” sharing that before they were co-stars in the MCU, he and his friends had seen a billboard of Jordan in “Fantastic Four” and been further inspired to chase their dreams. “He’s Johnny fucking Storm.” That moment, Kaluuya said, solidified that “Michael’s reach, influence and impact,” and that he was “global before he was given permission.”\n\n\tFor the “Creed” section of the program, Irwin Winkler, who produces the “Rocky” franchise, and Jordan’s co-stars Phylicia Rashad and Tessa Thompson took the stage. Rashad praised Jordan for his “impeccable” artistry, while Thompson reflected on playing soulmates onscreen for a decade. \n\n\t“I know my work husband extremely well,” she quipped. “I have watched my workplace spouse evolve immensely and grow tremendously, but at the same time, not change one bit.” Meanwhile, “Sinners” actor Delroy Lindo, Jordan’s most recent co-star on the bill, said that the evening helped him get a better sense of the “breadth and depth” of his brilliance, genius and impact.\n\n\tBradley Cooper, who received the American Cinematheque tribute in 2018, lamented the fact that he’s yet to work with Jordan. “Not a movie, not a show, never made a TikTok, nothing,” he cracked. “I’m simply a dedicated fan who has now, I’ve been miraculously upgraded to a friend.” \n\n\tAngela Bassett — who played Queen Ramonda, Jordan’s “auntie,” in “Black Panther” — and Tom Cruise — who, like Cooper, is simply a longtime fan — also appeared via video messages.\n\n\t“The first time I saw your work, it was immediately clear to me what a tremendous, tremendous talent you are, and I’ve been watching your career grow over these many years,” Cruise said in the clip. “I admire your talent, your dedication, your constant willingness to learn and push the boundaries of storytelling. You’ve brought to life so many authentic, memorable characters — always with such depth and always in service of the story.” And by taking on dual roles in “Sinners,” Cruise continued, Jordan “validated the magic of the big screen experience.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBradley Cooper points to Jordan in the audience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPhylicia Rashad speaks onstage. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTom Cruise praised Jordan in a pre-recorded message.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCoogler was the final presenter of the evening. “I’m really upset because I’ve never had to follow up that many incredible actors before,” he said, joking that all the other presenters used all the best anecdotes about Jordan. “It made my speech kinda worthless.”  \n\t\n\n\tBut Coogler did his best to sum up their 13 years of partnership, friendship and brotherhood, regardless, by focusing on Jordan’s incredible dedication to the craft of acting. Coogler detailed how Jordan transformed physically and dove deep into character work for each of their collaborations, with “Sinners” as his heaviest lift to date.\n\n\t“I don’t think there’s any other actor in the world who might’ve pulled that off,” Coogler said about the more intricate aspects of playing two characters in the same shot. “He makes these things look so easy; he often gets overlooked.”\n\n\tCoogler shared the story of their first coffee meeting as he pitched Jordan on “Fruitvale Station.” To him, it was obvious that Jordan was a movie star in the making. “I said, ‘Hey, man, I think you’re a star. Let’s do this project together and show the world,’ he recalled. “And this dude looked back at me like it was the first time somebody told him that.” (“It was,” Jordan yelled out from his table in the center of the ballroom.) \n\n\tAt the Sundance premiere of “Fruitvale Station,” Coogler said Oscar Grant’s family watched the film for the first time and his uncle’s review was poignant: “I felt I saw my nephew for an hour and a half,” he’d said. \n\n\t“That’s the power of Mike when he’s in his bag. Doing his first love,” Coogler said. “He has a power to make magic. He has a power to get to the truth. That all of our humanity is real, that all these constructs that we make — race, identity, citizenship — though deadly, though powerful, are just constructs. Mike shines through that.”\n\n\tThen, Coogler invited Jordan to the stage; the audience saluted the actor with an impressively long standing ovation, giving him time to wipe the tears from his eyes and regain his composure.\n\n\t“That reel keeps playing back in my head,” Jordan said. “It’s inspiring, because now I want to go do something else. I’m like ‘What’s next?’ For anybody that knows me, I’ve got an idea. I come with ideas.”\n\n\tAs Jordan looked around the room, full of people who’d witnessed different parts of his journey, he said the event felt like the “ultimate homecoming.” Jordan thanked his family, co-stars, collaborators and various members of his team, but choked up when he looked to Coogler.\n\n\t“Finding a collaborator like him early in my career changed everything for me. Words cannot describe the impact you’ve had on me and my life,” he said after a long pause. (“My friends and family had a bet on how many times I was gonna cry tonight,” Jordan admitted.)\n\t\n\n\tTo conclude his speech, Jordan focused his remarks on the power of storytelling to be a light in heavy times. “It’s a blessing to wake up and do what we do every day for a living,” he said, then quoted author Toni Morrison. “‘If there’s a book you really want to read but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it.’ So, to the artist, plant your seeds, find your people, build with them. And to the people making decisions about what stories will be told: Be bold. Take the risk. These stories matter.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMahershala Ali and Michael B.

    "body": "\n\tThree years after his triumphant Oscar win for “The Whale,” Brendan Fraser has found his next deeply personal project in an unlikely place: Tokyo. \n\n\tIn Hikari’s “Rental Family,” Fraser plays Philip, an American actor adrift in Japan who discovers unexpected purpose — and genuine human connection — when he’s hired to play a surrogate family member for people struggling with loneliness.\n\n\n\tThe film arrives at a moment when its themes feel particularly urgent. “This film really doesn’t have a declared villain,” Fraser says on the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast, settling into a conversation about the project that took him back overseas. “I mean, there are obstacles, of course, but they’re really our social, personal constructs.”\n\t\n\n\tFor Fraser, the appeal was immediate and multifaceted. “Automatically, selfishly, I thought, dream job,” he admits with characteristic self-awareness. “Going overseas. Location is vacant till you get there and like, oh, wow, I gotta do some work here. Learn enough Japanese to have passable dialogue. Going to have to run around Tokyo and it’s a busy, busy place.” But beyond the logistical challenges was something deeper — a script that treated its unusual premise with intelligence and emotional honesty.\n\n\n\tThe premise itself is rooted in reality. Three hundred rental family agencies are operating in Tokyo, a business that has existed since the 1980s. In a society grappling with the “actual public health issues” Fraser describes around solitude and loneliness, these agencies serve a specific need. “Sometimes people just want you to look them in the eyes and to let them know that you know that they exist, and that’s enough,” Fraser says. “But this film does go further than that and asks, what happens after that, when make-believe falls away and feelings and attachments become authentic, what is the result?”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRENTAL FAMILY, Brendan Fraser, 2025.  © Searchlight Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Searchlight Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFraser’s collaboration with director Hikari began with what he describes as an hours-long lunch that turned into an exploration of art and shared sensibilities. “I think pretty much we were talking about most anything but the film in an affected way,” he recalls. “I know we were finding a kinship with one another in the things that interested us in our approach to the work.” The director, whose name means “light, fire, energy,” brought personal investment to the material, having experienced events in her own life that connected to the story’s themes.\n\n\tPlaying Philip allowed Fraser to explore his own relationship with loneliness, a universal experience that takes on particular dimensions in the public eye. When asked about his own encounters with isolation, Fraser is thoughtfully candid: “I try to chase it away. I try to keep myself busy. Or sometimes I’ll accept it and sit in it. And it’s possible to feel alone, although you are not. You don’t want to intrude on anyone’s personal life. But I think you can identify with — even having company doesn’t give you a sense of feeling less lonely.”\n\n\tYet there’s hope in his perspective, a recognition of what truly sustains us. “Secretly, when I do sit down for a cup of coffee with a friend I haven’t seen in a while, I’m kind of doing that,” he says about the rental family concept. “There’s a reason why we call your brother, and it refuels you. It really does. It really does give you something that you can’t buy or ingest or wear or any of that.”\n\n\tAs Fraser continues this remarkable second act of his career, he’s balancing intimate character studies with blockbuster possibilities. The World War II drama “Pressure” is awaiting release, and, perhaps most exciting for fans, a potential return to the “The Mummy” franchise looms on the horizon. “I am very hopeful that this comes to fruition,” Fraser says carefully, acknowledging the speculation that’s been swirling. “It’s what they want. It’s what they’ve been begging for, from me. And I’ve been peppered with the question: “Will there be another?” Hey, look, if the stars align in the right way, I hope I have happy news for you.”\n\n\tWhen asked about other franchise opportunities — specifically the upcoming “Legend of Zelda” film adaptation — Fraser’s enthusiasm is palpable. A devoted gamer who admits to distracting himself with his Nintendo DS playing as Link in Hyrule, he’s unequivocal: yes, if there was a part for him, but he doesn’t think there is. It’s this combination of childlike wonder and hard-earned wisdom that makes Fraser such a compelling figure in Hollywood’s current landscape.\n\t\n\n\tOn this episode of the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast, Fraser discusses his role in Hikari’s moving dramedy. In addition, he teases where he thinks his “The Mummy” character would be today and how much he loves “The Legend of Zelda” (and the changes he wants to make to the video game). Listen below!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRENTAL FAMILY, from left: Brendan Fraser, Shannon Gorman, 2025.  © Searchlight Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Searchlight Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRead excerpts from her interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\t\n\t\tThe film centers on a rental family agency, a real business in Tokyo. How did you first react to this premise?\t\n\n\tWell, you can rent just about anything in Tokyo. You can rent a hedgehog. I’ve done it. Why not be able to rent a family? Tokyo is so busy as it is; there is a real need for connection, because a lot of people find themselves wrapped up in company and also feeling like they have not had fulfillment from their own family members, so they rent them, if only for an hour or two or three, someone to sit quietly with them or to attend an event. You can even have someone stand in at a wedding or hire the so-called extras at a funeral if you need to, just to let people know that they’re seen and they’re heard, and that has real value. And I know there are some ethical and moral issues surrounding the whole thing. And that’s the point: when you make believe about reality, what do you get? And so that’s the sort of blurry area in between that Hikari directs this story.\n\t\n\t\tWhat drew you to this project specifically?\t\n\n\tI did need to look for something that would follow up on the events of the Oscar, and I put aside whatever the expectations or pressures would have been placed on me, and really wanted to do whatever it took to keep myself interested. And when I heard about this project, “Rental Family,” it seemed unusual, maybe something that would have been on the blacklist. You know, liked, but not loved. To read it and to see that it was unsentimental, it was not mawkish, it took a very focused look at what it means to have found family and that, yes, it shot in Tokyo — those ticked the right boxes for me. I absolutely adored my first meeting with Hikari. I think we sat down for lunch that turned into — no joke — we went up in the library of this hotel in the city, looking at art books, and I think pretty much we were talking about most anything but the film in an affected way. I know we found a kinship in the things that interested us and in our approach to the work. And above all that, she is her namesake: Hikari means light, fire, energy. She is that.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe film explores loneliness as a central theme. How does Brendan Fraser experience loneliness?\t\n\n\tIt feels like — sometimes it feels like solitude, which, as Akira Emoto, the actor in our film, did point out, isn’t necessarily a negative thing. I mean, it allows you to have contemplation and reflection, which can be very helpful. But at the same time, in the absence of connection, it can be damaging. What do I do? Sure, I have activities and things that I do. I can grind my gears along with it. I can distract myself with my Nintendo DS and play as Link, flying around Hyrule.\n\n\tI try to chase it away. I try to keep myself busy. Or sometimes I’ll accept it and sit in it. And it’s possible to feel alone, although you are not. You don’t want to intrude on anyone’s personal life. But I think you can identify with — even having company doesn’t give you a sense of feeling less lonely. But I don’t know if I would ever go so far as to hire a surrogate, normally, that is. But I do know that secretly, when I do sit down for a cup of coffee with a friend I haven’t seen in a while, I’m doing that. There’s a reason why we call your brother, and it refuels you. It really does. It really does give you something you can’t buy, ingest, wear, or any of that.\n\t\n\t\tWith SAG contract negotiations coming up and your “Encino Man” co-star Sean Astin now president of SAG-AFTRA, what are your thoughts on AI and the future of acting?\t\n\n\tIt strikes me as a form of plagiarism, and that’s not good. I mean, yeah, sure, steal from the best, as the phrase goes, but appropriating it without permission and manipulating one’s image, voice or likeness to behave — you’re a puppet on a string. In the long term, the objective is to enrich oneself. That’s not fair without asking permission, as it were. Not acknowledging that that is an issue won’t make it go away. I’m not clever enough to understand what guardrails should be put in place, so to speak. But I do believe that the conversation needs to take place and a lot faster than the development of that technology, because that seems to redo itself every time we blink.\n\n\tI was honestly wondering about this: 25, 26 years ago, when I would go into the valley somewhere and put on a leotard and get scanned, as you would for special effects in films or the development of plastic dolls, or whatever. And after asking questions like, “Who owns this data?” I never got answers. And I thought, well, I guess it’s stuck in a silo somewhere. And it made me wonder then, not being able to imagine where we are now: what if Marilyn Monroe had been scanned? Pick any luminary — movie star, politician, whatever — would they be all right with this? Would they accept this? Do you really have permission to do this just because you take ownership of someone’s work, because you want to? I don’t know. I really am conflicted about that. I won’t stand in the way of progress, but I have to find out if there’s a happy medium.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat does that happy medium look like?\t\n\n\tFor instance, around 2008, that’s pretty much when everything went from analog to digital. That’s the real turn of the tide that I recall. “Journey to the Center of the Earth” was a film I shot in Montreal in 2007. First take, first day, we finished. Some rocks were caving in, and we got the shot, and the first AD said, “Okay, let’s move on.” And the first AC, through muscle memory, I guess, put a flashlight in his teeth and reached over to the camera to check the gate. And he stopped himself and turned and looked at everyone with wide eyes. And we all had this same-time epiphany: there is no gate. There’s no reason to have a gate. There’s no magazine or film on top of it. So it was funny, but also, we’re like, “Oh shit, we’ve just gone from horse and cart to internal combustion engine.”\n\n\tIt was an indicator of how things were changing. I mean, not only was that film conceived to be shot in 3D with the technology at the time, but it did usher in a period of change, and the ramifications of that affect the very human aspect of what it takes to create a project or film. So what I want to know is: where’s the gate?\n\t\n\t\tCan you talk about Sean Astin’s leadership at SAG-AFTRA?\t\n\n\tSean Astin is an excellent communicator. I’ve seen him plenty of times over the years at fan conventions around the country. He’s a favorite. There’s always a long line waiting to meet him at his table, and it takes a long time, and he does. He looks everyone in the eye, he gives them their time, and he counsels them. And many people do feel that he is the guy who will drag you up a hill, whether you think it’s good for you or not. He will not let you fail. And that’s just who Sean is.\n\t\n\t\tYou have another film coming, “Pressure” from Focus Features, about the D-Day invasion. Can you tell us about it?\t\n\n\tAnthony Maras directed it. Andrew Scott is in it — I saw him in “Vanya.” Oh my God, over two hours on the stage, he played about 37 characters, and it was incredible. His character is that of a scientist, a meteorologist, and a biologist, a Scotsman named James Stagg, who advised the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the weekend before the invasion of Normandy Beach on Tuesday, June 6, 1944. The whole operation, Operation Overlord, was scheduled for Monday, June 5. It is said to have been delayed by bad weather. Imagine if they had gone on Monday in bad weather. It would have been an absolute disaster, and the face of history would have been changed.\n\t\n\n\tAnd it all came down to one sort of nerdy man saying, if you go now, these storms will not allow the men to land on the beach. Waves will be 12 feet. There will be cloud cover. The Air Force can’t identify targets. They will die. In those days, predicting the weather was kind of just looking out the window and looking at analog reports from years prior. If it wasn’t raining in 1928, it won’t rain on this very same day. The scientist, the meteorologist, said, “No, give me the data. That’s what we want to rely on as the answer.” So Eisenhower had to decide whom to listen to. And years later, when Walter Cronkite interviewed him returning to the beach of Normandy and asked about that, he said, “Well, they just happen to have better weathermen than the Germans.”\n\n\tFor whatever I just told you about my thoughts on AI, there is a practical application that is incredibly useful. The archival footage that was upscaled from what was in the Library of Congress — you may be really familiar with those types of images, but you can actually see the breath come from their mouths with the sound mixing. You can see the scatter of sand. This was footage that was taken in 1944, and it looks like it was shot the day before yesterday.\n\t\n\t\tThere’s been news about you potentially returning to “The Mummy” franchise. What can you share?\t\n\n\tI am very hopeful that this comes to fruition. It’s what they want. It’s what they’ve been begging for, from me. And I’ve been peppered with the question, will there be another? Hey, look, if the stars align, I hope I have happy news for you. What was news to me — I was eating a bowl of noodles there, and the trades got itchy trigger fingers to report something. But in fact, what they said was speculation. So it’s in the ether. But official things need to happen, contracts need to be signed, and hopefully, a lot of money gets paid to people who deserve it.\n\t\n\t\tWhere do you think Rick O’Connell and his family would be now?\t\n\n\tWell, hopefully alive and well. I don’t know. They seem pretty devoted to their son and their lifestyle. I’d like to see Evelyn stand up to the Benbridge Scholars, to stand up to the boys club, as it were, which is nice. I don’t know. \n\t\n\t\tWhat would you tell people who are struggling right now, especially during the holidays?\t\n\n\t“Rental Family” is about overcoming apathy, and that’s important because the real struggle is from within. Are you going to do something about this, or are you not? The only way to overcome that obstacle is to do it together. Ask for help. I didn’t know you could ask for help until that was pointed out to me, and I did, and, surprise, I got it from the most remarkable places — people you love, people who are closest to you, professionals with the credentials to take care of your needs. Ask for help. If for reasons of mental health, holidays are a tricky time, and I don’t say this lightly — if your family is driving you up the wall, and I’m not trying to be funny: rent one.\n\t\n\n\tCome and see “Rental Family.” It will take you — you’ll feel like you were in Japan for a couple of hours. You’re gonna see a kid who is amazing in this. She’s really terrific. Something special. You can’t not fall for this kid. And filmmaker Hikari cares deeply about these issues, and she’s a positive influence because she acknowledges that, yes, there are prickly, sharp edges to these world issues. But in a world so divided, this is what’s needed now more than ever.\n\n\tAlso on this episode, Oscar nominee Kate Hudson discusses her role in “Song Sung Blue.” Additionally, the Awards Circuit Roundtable takes you inside the Governors Awards, how big “Wicked: For Good” will be, and what’s expected with Thanksgiving around the corner.\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

    "body": "\n\tMatchbox Shots, the Mumbai-based banner behind “Andhadhun,” “Monica O My Darling” (Netflix) and “Scoop” (Netflix), is backing “Shamed,” an official adaptation of Sarbjit Kaur Athwal’s memoir of the same name. \n\n\tThe book tells the real-life story of a British-Punjabi woman who, after witnessing her family conspire to kill her sister-in-law, mustered the courage to testify against them in open court. Her testimony led to the U.K.’s first bodiless murder conviction.\n\t\n\n\tFor producer Sarita Patil of Matchbox Shots, the project’s urgency was immediate. “What drew me to this story was the way it exposes the insidious violence that can live beneath the surface of ‘happy families’. But it also offers an extraordinary template of resistance. It’s not only a story of betrayal, but of courage, of a woman who rises against impossible odds,” says Patil, who sees “Shamed” as both cinema and advocacy, a film that can catalyse long-overdue conversations around domestic violence within South Asian communities globally.\n\n\n\tDirector-writer Dikssha Routray will be at the helm of the feature film adaptation which is part of the WAVES Film Bazaar Co-Production Market. Routray has worked as a creative producer on Hindi-language films “Andhadhun” (2018) and “Merry Christmas” (2024) and has led numerous other films and series for Matchbox Shots over the years besides directing the short films “The Ideal Bride” and “Red Velvet.”\n\n\tMatchbox Shots is actively seeking international co-producers through WAVES Film Bazaar. Some 25% of the budget is already secured. “For “Shamed,” we are strategically leveraging co-production markets, private equity, and domestic and international rebates to build a strong financial structure going forward,” says Patil.\n\t\n\n\tThe market is the first official outing of “Shamed,” which is in the final stages of script refinement, with production targeted for 2027. “In addition to our established work, we are deeply committed to nurturing and supporting emerging talent. At Matchbox, we provide a platform for new voices to break through, offering them the opportunity to shine and contribute to the future of storytelling,” Patil adds.\n\n\tWAVES Film Bazaar is the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa. \n",

    "body": "\n\tKendrick Lamar and “South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone aren’t ready to unveil their mysterious live-action comedy just yet. Paramount has removed the trio’s untitled feature from its March 20 release date, delaying the theatrical release indefinitely as the project continues to be tinkered.\n\n\t“It’s true – we’re moving (again). We’re working hard at finishing the movie,” reads a joint statement attributed to Stone and Parker’s production banner Park County and Lamar’s company PGLang.\n\t\n\n\tThe long-gestating film had already been bumped down Paramount’s release calendar before. When unveiled in 2024, the film had been set for a July 4, 2025 release — conspicuously timed to the Independence Day holiday. Three months out, the studio punted to March 20, 2026. Now, four months out, the film has been delayed again, this time with no new date set.\n\n\n\tAs its lack of an official title would indicate, details about Lamar, Parker and Stone’s live-action collaboration have been closely guarded. No cast members or logline have been revealed. What is known  is that the film is written by comedian Vernon Chatman. Lamar, Parker and Stone are producers, along with Dave Free for PGLang.\n\n\tLamar is hot off scoring nine nominations for the 2026 Grammys, leading the field of nominees for this year’s edition with kudos for his smash hip-hop album “GNX” and single “Luther.” His single “Not Like Us” won two of the Grammys’ top three categories last year. Meanwhile, Parker and Stone are continuing production on the Trump-skewering “South Park” Season 28, premiering new episodes to Comedy Central every other Wednesday.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEmerging Ladakhi filmmaker Stenzin Tankyong, whose shorts “Sekool” and “Last Days of Summer” (Rotterdam 2023) have screened widely on the festival circuit, has written and is set to direct “Kakthet” (Idiot). \n\n\t“Idiot” is produced by veteran filmmakers Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam of White Crane Films, with Flore Cavigneaux and Jérôme Blesson of France’s La Belle Affaire Productions (“Wolf Dog,” Venice Film Festival, 2022) serving as co-producers. La Belle Affaire Productions previously produced Tankyong’s “Last Days of Summer.”\n\t\n\n\tSet against the sweeping, high-altitude landscapes of Ladakh’s Changthang region, “Idiot” is a humorous and whimsical coming-of-age drama centred on Singay, an 18-year-old underachiever who has been unable to progress beyond the 10th grade at his remote government school. When the school faces imminent closure, the entire teaching staff rallies together in a last-ditch mission to help him finally pass his exams.\n\n\n\tFor Tankyong, the story is rooted in an urgent and largely overlooked reality faced by government-run village schools are experiencing a steep decline in enrolment as families increasingly opt for private institutions in Leh or metropolitan cities. The filmmaker sees this as a quiet but escalating crisis: while some families can afford to send their children away, many cannot, leaving a generation vulnerable to being left behind. “An uneducated generation cannot uplift its community. This film explores that truth, through honesty, humour and heart,” he says.\n\n\tThe team has begun early financing discussions, with WAVES Film Bazaar marking the project’s market debut. Some private equity has been secured to kick-start development, and the producers are actively seeking international partners, co-producers and financiers.\n\t\n\n\tThe script is complete, key cast and locations are in place with production on “Idiot” slated to begin in July 2026, concluding in May 2027 to capture the region’s dramatic seasonal shifts.\n\n\tWAVES Film Bazaar is the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIndian entertainment platform PTC Punjabi has partnered with Australian production company Temple to co-present three Punjabi-language feature films under the Australia-India Audiovisual Co-Production Treaty, marking one of the largest regional-language collaborations to utilize the bilateral agreement.\n\n\tThe alliance positions Australia as a strategic launch platform for Punjabi cinema’s global expansion, with the films set to roll out across India, Australia and New Zealand over the next 18 months.\n\t\n\n\tUnder the treaty framework, the productions will access Australian federal and state film incentives, including grants and rebates, while utilizing local crews, talent, locations and post-production facilities. Temple will handle Australian co-production requirements, including treaty compliance and studio partnerships, while PTC Punjabi manages Indian creative development, production and distribution.\n\n\n\tThe partnership brings together three independent producers from PTC Punjabi’s roster, each investing in and overseeing creative development alongside Temple. Australian theatrical distributor Forum will handle ANZ territory releases.\n\n\tThe collaboration comes as Indian-language films, including Punjabi titles, have surpassed Australian productions at the local box office, according to recent industry data. The shift has drawn increased attention from Indian producers viewing Australia as both a production base and international distribution gateway.\n\n\t“Punjabi cinema is ready for its global leap, and Australia gives us the perfect runway. With Temple this partnership is not just about making films – it’s about making history. Punjabi stories deserve the world, and together with Australia, we’re going to take them there with confidence, scale and pride,” said Rajiee M. Shinde, CEO of PTC Entertainment Channels.\n\t\n\n\tAnupam Sharma, founder of Temple, added: “The Australia–India Co-Production Treaty is a game-changer. Australia will be the engine that takes Punjabi cinema global – with world-class crews, studios, incentives and distribution access. PTC Punjabi has been the guardian of Punjabi culture for decades, and together we will now take Punjabi stories to the world.”\n\n\tThe partnership represents a significant investment into Australia’s screen sector, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales, from India. PTC Network operates PTC Punjabi as a leading Punjabi-language entertainment platform globally.\n\n\tThe pact was unveiled at the WAVES Film Bazaar, the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa.\n",

Glinda’s new song is “Girl in the Bubble,” while Elphaba sings “No Place Like Home.” The song title is a direct nod to Dorothy and “The Wizard of Oz,” who, in her quest to return to Kansas, repeats, “There’s no place like home,” while clicking her ruby-slippered heels.\n\n\tComposer John Powell’s score weaves in several musical callbacks to Act I. There’s a reprise of “What Is This Feeling?” with revised lyrics praising Glinda and her goodness, and Elphaba delivers a reimagined version of “The Wizard and I” that reflects her disappointment with the man she once admired. Throughout the film, additional musical changes appear, including new lyrics in “Wonderful” and an expanded version of the scene that now incorporates Glinda.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGown Inspirations\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tGlinda’s purple dress – which audiences first see in “Thank Goodness” – pays homage to both Billie Burke’s gown from the “Wizard of Oz” and Glinda’s finale dress in the Broadway musical. Costume designer Paul Tazewell took the silhouette from the 1939 film, designing a full, multilayered tulle and organza gown with crystal and glass beads. However, the color palette was inspired by the lavender-blue hues from Broadway’s Glinda. “That was a nod to honor that image,” Tazewell tells Variety.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tShattered Glass\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIn a callback to Part One, the first sign that Elphaba has come to see Glinda is the subtle cracking of Glinda’s window — just as it shattered when they quarrelled while sharing a dorm room. This time, though, the fracture is more controlled, reflecting how much mastery Elphaba has gained over her magic and signaling her arrival.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCamouflage\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIn another callback to the first film, Elphaba narrowly avoids being spotted by the royal guards by blending into the trees. Remember — when she first met Fiyero, he joked that he barely noticed her because she “blended in with the foliage.” In Part Two, that line comes full circle as she evades him and his guards by doing exactly that.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBlue Horse\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFiyero’s trusty steed is a blue horse — a subtle nod to the “Horse of a Different Color” from “The Wizard of Oz.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWestward Looking\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAll of Oz’s landmarks were strategically positioned to guide Elphaba’s journey from east to west, according to production designer Nathan Crowley. “She has to make a western journey, because she has to accept that she has to become the Wicked Witch of the West. She has to become the villain that Oz needs,” he tells Variety. So, the canopy where Elphaba fashions a hiding place faces west; then, by the end of the film, she reaches Kiamo Ko castle, completing her western arc.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBoq Foreshadowing\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tUniversal hinted at Boq’s future in the marketing. The character is framed by tin, teasing his transformation into the Tin Man. And the Munchkin wears an “M” embroidered over his heart, but the letter is filled in to form the shape of a heart, which he eventually loses when a spell goes wrong. During his first scene in “For Good,” audiences see Boq chopping wood in Nessarose’s chamber, foretelling what’s to come.\n\n\tBecause Boq’s transformation takes place in Nessarose’s mansion, “all the metal in the room attached to him,” explains Francis Hannon, the film’s head of makeup. “The handles of the jug were on his ears. His fingers were made from the salt and pepper pots.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSilver Slippers\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe iconic ruby red slippers never actually appear in the film. Due to a trademark issue with MGM, neither the movie nor the Broadway musical can use the famous red heels. Instead, filmmakers turned to the silver shoes originally described in “The Wizard of Oz” book, which is in the public domain. Their workaround? When Nessarose flies, cinematographer Alice Brooks uses red lighting instead — signaling to audiences that these are the beloved slippers we all know and love. “They get hotter and hotter, and that red became our most vibrant red,” Brooks says.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Wonderful Rainbow\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDuring their dance in “Wonderful” (now featuring Glinda), the Wizard’s palace is covered in rainbow-colored lights as a nod to Judy Garland’s iconic song, “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tA Peter Pan-Inspired Flight\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAs the ‘Wonderful’ number continues, Elphaba and Glinda levitate over the diorama of Oz. The filmmakers conceived the idea for the seated broomstick ride based on an idea director Jon M. Chu shared just before they flew to London to begin production. Chu shared photos with his team, explaining that he wanted the scene to play out similarly to the Peter Pan ride at Disneyland. \n\n\t“Jon wanted to build a ride, and we were three weeks away from shooting this scene. We only have Jeff Goldblum for four weeks to shoot all of movie one and two with him,” recalls cinematographer Alice Brooks. Chu was adamant he wanted a ride that could actually take off with its stars onboard; but the stage had already been built, so the team crafted a seated ride. \n\n\tThe scene also mimics “The Wizard and I,” Brooks notes: “We slowly dim on the pink light as they take flight on this ride, and Elphaba’s green skin disappears in pink light.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t‘Dancing Through Life’ Callback\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIn addition to soaring around the palace, Glinda and Elphaba also dance together, recreating the emotional moment where they became friends at the Ozdust Ballroom in the first film. They reprise their signature moves — a wrist to the forehead and the playful “chicken wing” arm gesture — reminding viewers of both the origins and strength of their friendship.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAnimal Covers\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIn the first film, Elphaba’s magical powers explode in the Shiz University courtyard, knocking an engraved portrait of the Wizard off the wall to reveal a painting of animals, symbolizing how Oz once functioned. In Part Two, the Wizard’s palace features another similar portrait on the wall. Prompted by the flying monkey, Chistery, Elphaba looks behind the artwork to uncover a secret room and finds that there are real animals trapped behind bars.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOff to See the Wizard\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIn one scene, Elphaba tells Glinda, “I’m off to see the Wizard,” which is a direct nod to “The Wizard of Oz” and Judy Garland’s Dorothy who sings, “We’re off to see the wizard.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAlice Fearn’s Return\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tEarly in the film, Glinda has a flashback to when she was a little girl performing magic tricks in front of her friends. Her parents make an appearance, with Alice Fearn returning as Glinda’s mom. Fearn played Elphaba in the West End production of “Wicked.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFlashback Rainbow\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWe got to meet young Elphie in Part One, and now in Part Two, we meet young Galinda. We see her at a party, where she tries — and fails — to perform a magic trick. But when a rainbow (alluding to “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”) appears outside and her friends ask if she made it, she confidently says yes.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWedding Scene\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe wedding is full of symbolic Easter eggs. First, the aisle runner of yellow butterflies represents the yellow brick road. There’s also the juxtaposition of Elphaba being underground, representing her journey into darkness and wickedness, while Glinda is above ground, celebrated among her peers.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFiyero Foreshadowing\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAfter betraying the Wizard’s guards and allowing Elphaba to escape, Fiyero meets his fate: he becomes the Scarecrow. On closer inspection, the clues to his future were there all along — from the poster, which shows the character surrounded by cornfields, to elements of his costume.\n\n\t“When you see him from the back, there’s a three-point pattern that’s created with the bullion … And that might be suggestive of something,” Tazewell tells Variety. In addition, the straw embroidery on this chest also hints toward this future. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRed Poppies Return\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tPoppies play a key role in “The Wizard of Oz,” with a field of them lulling Dorothy to sleep. Poppies also appear throughout “For Good,” including on the Wizard’s robe and on his desk, as a nod to the iconic, intoxicating flower.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGingham Curtains\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWhile Dorothy is not directly seen, nor does she have any lines, she appears in her all-too-familiar blue gingham dress. However, there’s another subtle nod to the character; the house that falls on Nessarose also features blue gingham curtains.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tToto on a Leash\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWhen Dorothy begins walking down the Yellow Brick Road, Elphaba notices Dorothy has Toto on a leash. This indicates that Dorothy is becoming an agent of the Wizard, and while she doesn’t have the pup in a cage, she, too, is an oppressor.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFighting Scene\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDuring “What Is This Feeling?” in Part One, the two witches clash during a combat class. Their fighting skills pay off later, when they reunite to battle following the death of the Wicked Witch of the East.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWitch Laugh\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAfter Glinda slaps Elphaba following their fight, Elphaba lets out a cackle — an homage to Margaret Hamilton’s iconic laugh from “The Wizard of Oz.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTiny Bubbles\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJust as Boq and Fiyero’s futures are embroidered and hinted at in their costumes, Glinda’s outfit also reflects her character development. She’s adorned with circles on her earrings, crown and dress, all mirroring the bubble she uses for transportation.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Wizard’s Exit  \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tWhen the Wizard is finally exposed and leaves Oz forever, he exits in the same way as the original “The Wizard of Oz” film — via hot air balloon.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEnding and Rainbow\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe final scene in Kiamo Ko echoes the opening scene of Part One, where the spilled water and abandoned hat mark the aftermath of the Wicked Witch’s “melting.” But as the camera pulls back to Munchkinland’s celebration of her demise, one last rainbow reference appears.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Grand Finale\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Wicked: For Good’s” final scene differs from the Broadway musical. On stage, Fiyero and Elphaba walk off together. However, the film ends with a flashback of Glinda and Elphaba when they were at Shiz; Glinda, wearing a white hood, whispers to Elphaba in a direct callback to the musical’s original poster.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCharli XCX Details the Good, Bad, and ‘Fantasy’ of Being a Pop Star\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis $115 Million Miami Spread Is a Tropical Oasis With Multiple Pools and a Private Marina\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNCAA Rescinds Rule to Allow Betting on Pro Sports Amid Reckoning\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

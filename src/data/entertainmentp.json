    "body": "\n\tU.S.-based Red Bison Productions has partnered with Mumbai’s Azure Entertainment on a cross-border feature film marking the Indian company’s inaugural Hollywood collaboration.\n\n\tHarsh Mahadeshwar is writing and directing the currently untitled project, which centers on the true story of an immigrant family’s experience navigating cultural identity and belonging in America. Indian National Film Award-winning actor Priya Mani (“Paruthiveeran,” “The Family Man”) and Mohit Raina (“The Freelancer”) are attached to star.\n\t\n\n\tPrincipal photography is set to commence in April, with filming planned across New York and New Jersey, as well as Delhi and Jammu-Kashmir in India.\n\n\n\t“This project is very close to my heart because it explores identity and belonging in a deeply honest way,” Raina said. “Being part of Azure Entertainment and Red Bison Productions’ first Indo-Hollywood collaboration makes it even more special, as it represents a meaningful step toward global storytelling.”\n\n\tMani added: “What drew me to this film instantly was the emotional truth of the story. I’m grateful to be part of a project that brings together such committed collaborators to tell a story that will connect with audiences across borders.”\n\n\tRomila Saraf Bhat, founder of Red Bison Productions, said: “From its inception, this story demanded a global voice and an honest cinematic treatment. With Priya Mani and Mohit Raina leading the cast, and an inspiring narrative that spans continents, we are creating cinema that is deeply personal yet universally resonant.”\n\n\tPrashant Ramesh Mishra, CEO and co-founder of Azure Entertainment, described the venture as pivotal for his company’s expansion strategy. “This film represents a defining moment for Azure Entertainment as we step into global cinema for the first time,” Mishra said. “This story goes beyond borders and beyond the idea of the American Dream, reflecting on to the shared human experience of aspiration, loss, and resilience.”\n\t\n\n\tAzure Entertainment previously produced “Rocky Handsome,” “Badla” and “Kesari.” Red Bison’s credits include “Bhaag Bawre Aandhi Aayi.” \n\n\tAdditional casting details and the film’s title will be revealed at a later date. The film was previously launched with a different title and cast in 2023 and has since been revamped and redesigned. \n",

    "body": "\n\tOne of the most toxic love stories ever to be shown on TV has come to an end. Hulu’s “Tell Me Lies” will end with Season 3, creator Meaghan Oppenheimer announced on Monday, Feb. 16, ahead of what will be the series finale. The last episode drops at 9 p.m. PT.\n\n\t“After three amazing seasons of Tell Me Lies, tonight’s episode will be the series finale,” the showrunner wrote via Instagram. “This was always the ending my writing team and I had in mind, and we are insanely proud of it. Your incredible response to this season inspired us to explore whether there was another organic way to continue the story, but ultimately we felt it had reached its natural conclusion. My main goal has always been to protect the quality of the show and give you the best experience I can give you. And so, while it is bittersweet to leave something that has been such a happy experience, I am very grateful that we are able to tell a complete story with an intentional ending – a privilege very few shows get. Thank you for loving our show. We are excited to bring you more stories in the near future.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Hulu drama, based on Carola Lovering’s 2018 novel, made its debut in September 2022, and has told the story of the destructive relationship between two college students, as well as the misdeeds within their very messy friend group. Grace Van Patten, Jackson White, Catherine Missal, Spencer House, Sonia Mena, Branden Cook, Benjamin Wadsworth, Alicia Crowder and Tom Ellis star.\n\n\n\tThe show unfolded over two timelines — one between 2008 and 2010, dissecting the college years at the fictional Baird College, and the other in 2015 post-college, centered around the wedding (and weeks leading up to it) between Bree (Missal) and Evan (Cook).\n\t\n\n\tThe third season, however, introduced a new romance between Bree and Evan’s best friend, Wrigley (House), a relationship that quickly drew fans in. “There are always those people in friend groups who spend a lot of time in the same space, but never alone. You’ll be in a friend group, and you’ll realize I’ve never actually had a private conversation with this person. So they know of each other, but they don’t know each other on a personal level,” Oppenheimer recently told Variety. “They are, by Season 3, in a lot of ways, the people who have dealt with the most serious trauma in their lives. I always like stories where people who are at rock bottom connect and find healing within each other and find a surprising safe space with another person. So it felt just very organic to me.”\n\n\tWhile the third season wasn’t advertised as the final season, “it was definitely the ending I had always imagined and pitched years ago,” Oppenheimer said.\n\n\tExecutive producers include Emma Roberts, Karah Preiss, Matt Matruski, Laura Lewis, Shannon Gibson, Stephanie Noonan, Sam Schlaifer and Tyne Rafaeli. 20th Television produces and Lovering is as a consulting producer.\n\n\tThe “Tell Me Lies” finale drops on Hulu on Monday at 9 p.m. PT.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass says Casey Wasserman “should step down” from his role as chairman of the LA28 Olympic organizing committee that is driving the Summer Games given the tumult stirred by his appearance in the Epstein files. \n\n\tBass has been a supporter of Wasserman’s in the past. But in an interview Monday with CNN anchor Dana Bash, the mayor voiced her opinion that Wasserman should resign from his high-profile post.\n\n\n\t“The board made a decision. I think that decision was unfortunate. I don’t support the decision,” Bass said during her appearance on CNN’s “The Lead.” “My opinion is that he should step down. That’s the not the opinion of the [LA28] board.” \n\t\n\n\tBass emphasized that the LA28 board is not a city-appointed entity but answerable to its board members and the International Olympic Committee.\n\n\tWasserman has come under fire over the past three weeks after the Justice Department disclosed millions of pages of files related to the late convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The files reveal that in 2003 Wasserman had an intimate relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell, who was a longtime associate of Epstein’s and is now in federal prison on related sex trafficking charges. Wasserman has apologized for his association with Maxwell as stated that he was unaware of the Epstein and Maxwell’s activities.\n\n\tBut the backlash has been so swift and so fierce that Wasserman has been forced to put his namesake talent representation and marketing firm up for sale. On Feb. 13, Wasserman disclosed the sale plan and said he would concentrate his efforts on achieving his dream of bringing Olympics back to L.A. Wasserman earlier in the week survived an LA28 board vote that reaffirmed his status as leader.\n\t\n\n\tBass initially declined to comment on Wasserman’s status atop the LA28 committee. But as she fights through a tough re-election process, Bass on Monday made a calculated decision to take a position.\n\n\t“My job as mayor of Los Angeles is to make sure that our city is completely prepared to have the best Olympics that has ever happened in Olympic history, so my focus is a little different,” Bass told Bash. “But the behavior of Maxwell, what they were involved in, is abhorrent, and it’s an issue that I’ve worked on for a long time.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrancis Ford Coppola took to Instagram on Monday afternoon to honor his longtime collaborator and friend Robert Duvall, who died on Sunday at the age of 95.\n\n\t“What a blow to learn of the loss of Robert Duvall,” Coppola wrote. “Such a great actor and such an essential part of American Zoetrope from its beginning: ‘The Rain People,’ ‘The Conversation,’ ‘The Godfather,’ ‘The Godfather Part II,’ ‘Apocalypse Now,’ ‘THX 1138,’ ‘Assassination Tango.'”\n\t\n\n\n\tAs noted by Coppola, he collaborated with Duvall on seven films throughout his career: “The Rain People” (1969), “THX 1138” (1971), “The Godfather” (1972), “The Conversation” (1974), “The Godfather Part II” (1974), “Apocalypse Now” (1979) and “Assassination Tango” (2002).\n\n\n\tFellow “Godfather Part II” stars Robert De Niro and Al Pacino also paid tribute to Duvall on Monday. Pacino wrote in a statement shared with Variety, “It was an honor to have worked with Robert Duvall. He was a born actor as they say, his connection with it, his understanding and his phenomenal gift will always be remembered. I will miss him.”\n\n\tDe Niro wrote in his own remembrance, “God bless Bobby. I hope I can live till I’m 95. May he rest in peace.”\n\n\tTributes from Hollywood’s biggest stars flooded social media following the news of Duvall’s death. Viola Davis wrote on Instagram that it was an “honor” to act alongside Duvall in the 2018 thriller “Widows.”\n\n\t“I was in awe,” Davis added, “I’ve always been in awe of your towering portrayals of men who were both quiet and dominating in their humanness. You were a giant… an icon… ‘Apocalypse Now,’ ‘The Godfather,’ ‘To Kill a Mockingbird,’ ‘Tender Mercies,’ ‘The Apostle,’ ‘Lonesome Dove’… etc… Greatness never dies. It stays… as a gift. Rest well, sir. Your name will be spoken… May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.”\n\t\n\n\tMichael Keaton, who starred with Duvall in Ron Howard’s 1994 workplace comedy “The Paper,” wrote in his own Instagram tribute, “Another friend goes down. Acted with and became friends. Shared a great afternoon on my front porch talking about horses. He was greatness personified as an actor. RIP RD.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe immigrant experience is most often discussed, and most easily understood, as one of an entire person’s movement and relocation: a journey from A to B and perhaps further letters, with concomitant processes of discovery and nostalgia, alienation and adaptation. It’s less simple, however, to articulate the disembodying nature of immigration: the sense of a phantom self left behind, living the life that might have been, and uncannily confronting you when you return. A film of many subtle, tricky marvels, Geneviève Dulude-De Celles‘s slowly bewitching “Nina Roza” comes closer than many to conveying that strange, imprecise separation of the soul — through both lucidly expressed feeling, and artfully built narrative structure.\n\t\n\n\tOne of the quiet surprises of this year’s Berlin Film Festival competition, the Québécois filmmaker’s notably assured second feature arrives seven years after her debut “A Colony” won the Crystal Bear in the same fest’s youth-oriented Generation Kplus sidebar. That film, a simple but piercing portrait of a shy teen caught between opposing peer influences, was familiar in some ways but auspicious in the calm depth of its gaze — and that humane poise is present again in “Nina Roza,” this time in service of more complex characters and more finely calibrated conflicts. The pensive sophistication and opalescent style with which the film unparcels its ideas might not please arthouse crowds wanting broader emotional gestures, but Dulude-De Celles may be a festival-circuit major in the making.\n\n\n\tIt’s nearly 30 years since Mihail (a marvelous Galin Stoev) left Bulgaria following the death of his wife, taking their young daughter Roza to begin a new life in Montreal. Over time, he has established himself as a leading contemporary art consultant, often called on by collectors and curators to research and validate new talents — though he’s somewhat thrown when regular client Christophe (Christian Bégin) requests his expertise regarding Nina (played by identical twins Sofia and Ekaterina Stanina), an eight-year-old painter in rural Bulgaria whose naïvely abstract but vibrantly composed canvases have gone viral after being discovered by Italian talent scout Giulia (Chiara Caselli). Agents and gallery owners are abuzz; Christophe wants Mihail to determine if the hype is real.\n\t\n\n\tWary not just of alleged child prodigies, but also of returning to a homeland he hasn’t set foot in since his initial departure, Mihail is reluctant to take the job. He’s spurred to do so, however, by Roza (Michelle Tzontchev), a single parent who now tellingly goes by the anglicized Rose, but is troubled by her growing distance (and more so, her young son’s) from her cultural roots — and her fading memories of a mother who didn’t travel and change with them. \n\n\tOn his arrival in Bulgaria, ambiguities abound, both regarding his professional reason for being there (as Nina, beguiling but hard to read, claims she no longer wishes to paint) and his unwanted reconnection with home. On the one hand, he’s haunted by what’s familiar and constant from his past there. On the other, he’s treated as a visitor by the locals, who mock his accent and distrust his watchful presence; only he can sense in himself any trace of national belonging.\n\n\tA Bulgarian-Canadian theater director making his film acting debut, Stoev is a compelling thinker on screen: There’s a wounded gravity to his silences that can tilt the direction of a sparsely written scene, while his remarkable face, storied in its lines and hollows and textures, rewards the camera’s sustained scrutiny. But the film makes dialogue count when it wants to: An acrid reunion scene with Mihail’s estranged sister Svetlana (a superb, seething Svetlana Yancheva) is propelled by the vituperative, frankly expressed resentment of those left behind. “Who told you I wanted to see you?” she spits, making clear where her brother truly isn’t at home.\n\n\tNina, meanwhile, may or may not be a great artist, but she’s wily and evidently special, with a perspective rooted in her humble, rugged surroundings. (We’re even told the paints she uses, with their unusually earthy colors, are made from natural pigments of the region.) She’s also the exact age Roza was when Mihail uprooted her from Bulgaria, and the longer he spends with Nina, the more she becomes a proxy for Roza’s parallel, non-immigrant self — especially as she faces a similar crossroads, with Giulia and Nina’s opportunistic family eager to move her to Italy, where she’s to attend a prestigious art academy. Nina would rather remain loyal to her soil.\n\n\tIt’s a doubling that Dulude-De Celles never makes overly literal or contrived, but underlines with deft editorial sleight of hand, and the inspired twin casting of Nina, whose temperament and outlook do shift imperceptibly from scene to scene. Alexandre Nour Desjardins’s elegant, glimmering cinematography also plays with the concealing properties of bronzed magic-hour light and minty morning mist, the romantic beauty of the images encroaching on Mihail’s resolve to see things for what they are. \n",

Hughes co-wrote the screenplay with James Beaufort. Todd Lieberman and Alexander Young produce for Hidden Pictures, with Patrick Hughes and Greg McLean producing for HUGE FILM and Rich Cook for Range. It premieres March 6.\n\t\n\n\tTheron toplines “Apex,” an action thriller directed by Baltasar Kormákur that filmed in the Blue Mountains and Canberra. The April 24 release, which also stars Taron Egerton and Eric Bana, follows a grieving woman testing her limits in the Australian wilderness who becomes ensnared in a deadly game. Peter Chernin, Jenno Topping and David Ready produce for Chernin Entertainment, Ian Bryce for Ian Bryce Productions, Charlize Theron, A.J. Dix and Beth Kono for Secret Menu, and Kormákur for RVK Studios.\n\n\n\tPugh headlines “East of Eden,” a contemporary reimagining of John Steinbeck’s classic novel shot in New Zealand.

Zoe Kazan serves as co-showrunner, writer and executive producer alongside co-showrunner Jeb Stuart.

The Fremantle Australia and NewBe series, created by Hannah Carroll Chapman, stars Ayesha Madon, James Majoos, Chloé Hayden, Asher Yasbincek and Thomas Weatherall.\n\n\tNetflix also revealed the first look for “My Brilliant Career,” an adaptation of Miles Franklin’s iconic novel filmed in Adelaide. The series stars Philippa Northeast as Sybylla, a young woman in 1901 Australia determined to become a writer despite her family’s plans to marry her off. Liz Doran adapted and wrote the series, which is produced by Jungle Entertainment with Alyssa McClelland and Anne Renton directing.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“My Brilliant Career”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAdditional Australian productions include “Allen,” a film from Ludo Studio (the makers of “Bluey”) starring T.J. Power, created by Daley Pearson and shot in Brisbane and the Gold Coast; and “Breakers,” the first Netflix series filmed in Western Australia. The latter, from Clerkenwell Films and BBC Studios Australia Productions, stars Antony Starr, D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Oliver Edis and Annabel Wolfe in a drama about two American backpackers drawn into a mysterious surf community. Mary Nighy and Ng Choon Ping direct from a script by Pete Jackson.\n\n\tPeter Berg’s “The Mosquito Bowl,” based on Buzz Bissinger’s book about college football stars who enlisted in the Marines following Pearl Harbor, filmed in Brisbane and the Gold Coast. The World War II drama stars Nicholas Galitzine, Bill Skarsgård, Ray Nicholson, Tom Francis, Brent Comer and Dominic Bogart, with Berg and Mark L. Smith writing. Peter Berg produces for Film 44, with Brian Grazer for Imagine Entertainment and Alex Gayner.\n\n\tIn unscripted, “The Golden Ticket” filmed on the Gold Coast with Eureka Productions.

The latter features voice work from Ali Wong and Stephanie Hsu, with Amy Poehler, Jane Hartwell and Kim Lessing producing.\n\t\n\n\tThis is the first slate overseen by Amanda Duthie, Netflix’s newly appointed content director for the territory.\n\n\t“Throughout my career, I’ve seen that local stories resonate most powerfully when they’re deeply specific, true to a character, a community or a moment in time,” Duthie said. “This 2026 slate brings together stories that differ widely in tone, scale and ambition, from every corner of the region.”\n\n\tSince 2021, Netflix has invested more than AU$10 million ($7 million) in building capacity across the Australian and New Zealand screen industries through paid placements, training and development initiatives, particularly for emerging and underrepresented practitioners.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen you think of the great actors (Brando, Streep, De Niro, Ullmann, Day-Lewis), one of the first qualities that leaps to mind is range. Robert Duvall, who died Sunday at 95 and was most assuredly one of the great actors, had that quality to the nth degree. He was a sly-dog virtuoso whose roster of indelible characters included a broken-down country singer, a Mafia consigliere, a charismatic Pentecostal preacher, a psychotic Army commander, a corrupt TV news executive and a creepy neighbor who lives in the shadows, not to mention a whole lot of cowboys and also Dwight D. Eisenhower and Joseph Stalin. Born in California and raised in Maryland, Duvall, as much or more than any actor of his time, had a deep identification with the world of the South. In one role after another, he used a drawl and a laidback cadence to portray men from that region — both charmers and killers, each subtly different from the last, chiseling every character with a jeweler’s precision.\n\t\n\n\tYet when I think of the range that Duvall expressed in his acting, I don’t simply mean his chameleonic quality. I’m talking about something more primal and emotional — the way that he navigated the light and dark sides of experience with an alternating current of quietude and fury, tenderness and violence. His characters could be loving…or brutish. Gentle…or murderous. And — this was the spice in his gumbo — sometimes both at once. It’s no exaggeration to say that Duvall’s acting career added up to an exploration of the duality of all of us.\n\n\n\tHe first came to people’s attention as Boo Radley, the mysterious recluse in the 1962 film adaptation of “To Kill a Mockingbird.” The duality was already there, in the way that everyone around him thought Boo was a monster, but he turned out to be a protector. Duvall came from the stage and did a lot of television work in the ’60s, but after making his mark in “M*A*S*H” (as the uptight soldier beau of “Hot Lips” Houlihan), he took on a role that became defining: Tom Hagen, the dutiful, trusted Irish-German lawyer and counselor to the Corleone family in “The Godfather” and its sequel. Though part of a crime syndicate, Duvall’s Hagen had qualities that seemed both corporate and priestly: a calm sense of rectitude and loyalty, along with an eerie ability to fade into the woodwork when necessary. The performance was so convincing that it was hard, at that point, not to look at Duvall and assume that those qualities defined him as an actor.\n\t\n\n\tYet as memorable as he was playing Tom Hagen as an insider who remained, somehow, on the outside, Duvall was also biding his time, waiting to show audiences everything he could do. In “Network” (1976), as the profit-hungry executive vice president of the UBS TV network, he let loose in a new way, as in the outrageous moment when Howard Beale’s crazed TV show first tastes success, and Duvall’s Frank exclaims, with reckless glee, “It’s a big, fat big-titted hit!” This was the other side of Duvall: the showman boiling over with bluster, the amoral life of the party, with a grin as wide as a shark’s. So here was the grand paradox, and the real meaning of Duvall’s range. Few could portray a courtly gentleman as convincingly as he did; he could embody the soul of decency. Yet he was also driven to explore the dark side, and he did so as profoundly as any actor of the last half century.      \n\n\tIn 1979, he did it in two extraordinary ways. In “The Great Santini,” Duvall gave what felt at the time – and still does – like the defining performance as a father who cripples his children with the harshness of his demands. We’ve seen this kind of movie so often now that it’s a genre unto itself. But Duvall still owns it; his “Bull” Meechum is a hypnotically layered hard-ass who’s a destructive father yet can never be written off as a villain. Duvall’s understanding of him is too rich. And in “Apocalypse Now,” Duvall, as the surf-happy, bare-chested, U.S. Cavalry-hatted Vietnam officer Lt. Col. Kilgore, let loose with a memorable maniac of a character who was so gloriously satirical and, at the same time, so vividly real that he gave Francis Ford Coppola’s movie a huge swatch of its meaning. Duvall’s delivery of the line “I love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like…victory” made it the deadly funny swan song of America’s imperial reign of military might. (It’s not that we didn’t try again; it’s that Duvall’s portrayal of lock-jawed insanity showed you why it would no longer work.)\n\n\tAnd after that, Duvall was just getting started. Going forward, his performances would now make a point of drawing on both sides of the duality. That’s why he won the Oscar for best actor in “Tender Mercies” (1983): His Mac Sledge was a taciturn recovering alcoholic who spent the entire movie trying to straighten up and fly right, but what made the performance great was its haunted undercurrent — the hint, communicated by Duvall between the lines, of all the bad places that Mac had been. You could feel that same richness, that ripe moral ripple of a man teetering between being a knight and a scoundrel, in the L.A. police drama “Colors” (1988) and in “Lonesome Dove,” the 1989 TV Western miniseries that allowed Duvall to give one of his most expansive performances.\n\t\n\n\tAnd his greatest performance? To me, it’s the one Duvall gives in “The Apostle,” the 1997 drama he also directed. The movie is one of the authentic masterpieces of the independent-film era, and it contains, quite simply, one of the greatest pieces of screen acting you will ever see. Duvall plays “Sonny” Dewey, a local rock star of a Pentecostal preacher who occupies a position of extreme power in his Texas church. He’s a deeply religious man; he’s also a narcissist who lives for his own gratification. That’s why his wife (played by Farrah Fawcett) has begun an affair with a younger minister, and is trying to depose him at the church. At a Bible-camp softball game, Sonny picks a fight with the minister and ends up tapping him on the head with a baseball bat.\n\n\tIt is not the most violent of smashes. Yet in that very ambiguity, the question is raised: How violent is this man of God? Is he merely angry, or is he homicidal? Duvall is really asking: What, deep down, is in his heart? In all our hearts? And that’s the question Duvall asked throughout his career. “The Apostle” is a character study in which we watch the sacred and the profane, the worship of God and the worship of the self, battle it out in one man’s soul. Sonny escapes the law and sets up a new church, and as he begins to preach in that church, the words pouring out of him as if he were an auctioneer speaking in tongues, Duvall’s performance becomes nearly symphonic. The film is so staggering, so moving, that by the end you feel floored. What Duvall has shown you is the full range of what a human being is.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAl Pacino and Robert De Niro have paid tribute to Robert Duvall, who died on Sunday at the age of 95.\n\n\t“It was an honor to have worked with Robert Duvall,” Pacino said. “He was a born actor as they say, his connection with it, his understanding and his phenomenal gift will always be remembered. I will miss him.”\n\n\t“God bless Bobby,” De Niro wrote. “I hope I can live till I’m 95. May he rest in peace.”\n\n\n\tPacino starred alongside Duvall in “The Godfather” and “The Godfather Part II.” Pacino played the heir to the Corleone crime family, Michael, while Duvall appeared as Tom Hagen, his lawyer and trusted advisor. While never appearing in the same scene as Duvall, De Niro also starred in “The Godfather: Part II” as a young Vito Corleone.\n\t\n\n\tPacino and De Niro are just two of many Hollywood stars who paid tribute to Duvall. Viola Davis wrote on Instagram Threads that it was an “honor” to appear alongside the “Tender Mercies” star in the 2018 thriller “Widows.”\n\n\t“I was in awe,” Davis added, “I’ve always been in awe of your towering portrayals of men who were both quiet and dominating in their humanness. You were a giant… an icon… ‘Apocalypse Now,’ ‘The Godfather,’ ‘To Kill a Mockingbird,’ ‘Tender Mercies,’ ‘The Apostle,’ ‘Lonesome Dove’… etc… Greatness never dies. It stays… as a gift. Rest well, sir. Your name will be spoken… May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.”\n\n\tAdam Sandler, who appeared alongside Duvall in the 2022 sports drama “Hustle,” also remembered Duvall on Instagram. He wrote, “Such a great man to talk to and laugh with. Loved him so much. We all did. So many movies to choose from that were legendary. Watch them when you can. Sending his wife Luciana and all his family and friends our condolences.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAnderson Cooper will exit CBS News‘ “60 Minutes” after nearly 20 years of contributing to the program, according to a person familiar with his thinking, the latest blow to the revered Sunday-night newsmagazine after it has been undermined repeatedly by management at Paramount Skydance and its predecessor company.\n\n\t“Being a correspondent at ’60 Minutes’ has been one of the highlights of my career. I got to tell amazing  stories, and work with some of the best producers, editors and camera crews in the business,” Cooper said in a statement. “For nearly twenty years, I’ve been able to balance my jobs at CNN and CBS, but I have little kids now and I want to spend as much time with them as possible, while they want to spend time with me.”\n\t\n\n\tCooper was said to be in negotiations with CBS about a renewal in recent weeks, but opted to put more of his focus on activities at CNN. In addition to his long-running 8 p.m. program at the Warner Bros. Discovery-backed network, Cooper also hosts a podcast centered around discussions of grief that has become increasingly popular, and hosts a Sunday longform programed called “The Whole Story.”\n\n\n\tCBS News said Monday evening that it was “grateful” to Cooper for “dedicating so much of his life to this broadcast, and understand the importance of spending more time with family. 60 Minutes will be here if he ever wants to return.”\n\n\tBreaker, a newsletter centered on the media industry, previously reported Cooper’s intention to leave. Cooper late last year signed a deal to extend his stay at CNN.\n\n\tCooper’s decision to leave may have been a difficult one. People who know the journalist say one of the true joys of his career has been the ability to cut himself free from breaking news and focus on deeper reportage for a program that is devoted to longer-form storytelling.\n\t\n\n\tHis departure would pose a new blow to CBS News under the tenure of its editor in chief, Bari Weiss. Since arriving at CBS News last year, installed at the unit’s news leader after Paramount Skydance acquired her conservative opinion site, The Free Press, for a reported $150 million, Weiss has worked to overhaul the operation — but has also made a number of gaffes. One of those was a decision to delay a “60 Minutes” report by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi on the violent circumstances of migrants deported by the U.S.  — not because it contained errors, but because Weiss wanted a Trump administration official to comment on camera, even though Alfonsi had previously sought a response. The report surfaced on “60 Minutes” several weeks later.\n\n\tWeiss has also worked to cut the staff at “CBS Evening News,” and is mulling additional staff reductions with a set of layoffs that could comprise at least 15% of the staff of CBS News overall. Her efforts so far have given rise to a level of mistrust between her management team and the CBS News rank and file.\n\n\t“60 Minutes,” which features profiles and features along with investigative pieces, has seen its credibility subverted over the past two years as corporate managers failed to defend it from what was largely considered to be a nuisance suit from President Trump over the editing of a 2024 interview with then-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Paramount, eager to clear a path to a sale of the company from the Redstone family, former controlling shareholders, to the Ellisons, who now operate Paramount Skydance, agreed to pay a $16 million settlement to Trump.\n\n\tAs a result, two senior CBS News executives — Bill Owens, the executive producer of “60 Minutes” and Wendy McMahon, the former CEO of CBS News, local stations and syndication — suggested in remarks that they could no longer push back against corporate mandates they felt would weaken the newsroom. Three people familiar with the show say there have been calls for “60 Minutes” to cut back on the number of hard-news or investigative segments it runs, and pay more attention to features and celebrity profiles, which corporate managers believe will generate more attention online.\n\n\tCooper appeared on “60 Minutes” Sunday night, during its “Last Minute” segment, a short end note that has been part of the telecast since 2022. Whether that cameo marked his last appearance in the program’s current season, its 58th, remains to be seen.\n\t\n\n\tWhen Cooper leaves, he will take with him a valuable means of promoting the newsmagazine’s stories. For years, CBS has allowed Cooper to run his “60 Minutes” segments during his CNN show.\n",

'ANTM' is back in the zeitgeist lately because of the new Netflix docuseries, \"Reality Check: Inside America's Next Top Model.\"\n      \n    \n          In the docuseries, old transgressions are dug up ... perhaps most notably, Shandi Sullivan's traumatic experience, which was filmed on the show.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          While 'ANTM' seemed to frame Shandi's \"drunk shower sex\" as an act of infidelity on Shandi's part, Shandi says it was sexual assault.\n      \n    \n          Tyra has basically passed blame onto other producers, but according to Adrianne ... at least Tyra's not being fake.\n      \n    \n          In her video, Adrianne leaves a message for Tyra, saying, \"Keep on being yourself -- which is someone who doesn't give a flying s***.\"\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Tyra Banks\n              \n                          \n                Adrianne Curry\n              \n                          \n                Social Media\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                          \n                America's Next Top Model\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tSky and Disney have inked a multi-year distribution deal that will see the broadcaster offer Disney+ to Sky customers in the U.K. and Ireland at no extra cost as well as offering a streaming bundle including HBO Max, Netflix and Hayu.\n\n\tThe deal will also see Sky, a Comcast subsidiary, debut a dedicated Disney+ Cinema linear channel.\n\n\tLaunching March 2026, Disney+ (standard with ads tier) will be included in a variety of Sky TV subscriptions as well as further integration of the app with Sky’s operating system, saving Sky customers £5.99 per month. As part of the deal Disney+ shows will be promoted alongside Sky content on the “continue watching” rail and in recommendations.\n\t\n\n\tSky subscribers can activate Disney+ through products such as Sky Q, Sky Glass and Sky Stream while Disney+ customers who move their accounts and profiles over to watch via Sky can also make the cost saving.\n\n\n\tAs part of the offering, Sky will offer a bundle featuring Disney+, HBO Max, Netflix and Hayu into a single Sky TV subscription, starting at £24 a month for a two-year fixed-term contract.\n\n\t“We’re really delighted with this deal, because customers tell us they face so much choice and complexity in this market so by signing this agreement, we’ve agreed to a much deeper level of product integration,” Sophia Ahmad, chief consumer officer at Sky, told Variety.\n\n\tKarl Holmes, Disney+ general manager in EMEA, told Variety: “There are millions of customers at Sky who have currently chosen not to buy Disney+ direct, and they will now get Disney+ at no extra cost. And we would expect that those customers will use the Disney+ app and will enjoy our content.”\n\t\n\n\tTo date the U.K. has been the largest European market for Disney+ and is primarily direct to consumer, although the Mouse House does have deals with Virgin Media, Uber, Lloyds Bank and Tesco in the territory in relation to its streaming platform. Holmes clarified that none of those deals “are of the size or ambition of this arrangement with Sky.”\n\n\tHe added that the aim of the deal was to reach “millions of customers who prefer to buy TV as part of a larger subscription, and in that sense, it is complementary and additive to our existing growth.” Holmes predicted the agreement would take Disney+’s reach in the U.K. and Ireland up by around 40%, accounting for overlap, with the numbers based on BARB’s establishment survey.\n\n\tBoth parties declined to comment on the term of the agreement, although Holmes said it was “multiple years,” adding: “We wouldn’t do this for a short amount of time.”\n\n\tThe deal not extend to co-productions or the distribution of Disney+ content outside of the streaming platform and linear Disney+ Cinema channel.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Singapore International Film Festival will move its 37th edition to an earlier calendar slot, running from Oct. 21 to Nov. 1, 2026, while elevating Jeremy Chua to the role of executive director.\n\n\tThe festival, which has traditionally taken place between late November and early December, is repositioning itself to avoid direct competition with year-end Hollywood tentpoles. The 36th edition ran Nov. 26 to Dec. 7, 2025.\n\n\n\t“The shift to October positions SGIFF within an optimal window for theatrical releases of independent film in Singapore, allowing films to reach local audiences without competing directly with the year-end slate of major Hollywood blockbusters,” according to the festival. “This strategic move reaffirms SGIFF’s commitment to enhance visibility for independent world cinema, while supporting distributors and filmmakers in boosting audience engagement.”\n\t\n\n\tThe 2025 edition saw ticket sales rise 33% from 2024, and a 28.7% increase in audiences. \n\n\t“The decision to reposition the festival reflects our intention to place greater emphasis on the distribution and exhibition needs of independent and auteur cinema,” said Chua. “By collaborating more closely with distributors during a more suitable release period, we aim to strengthen reach and engagement beyond the festival itself.”\n\n\tThe new dates could place SGIFF in direct overlap with the Tokyo International Film Festival, which is expected to run Oct. 25 to Nov. 5. SGIFF will also run simultaneously with the Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (Oct. 23 to Nov. 1).\n\t\n\n\tThe positioning creates a potential Asian festival circuit flow, with SGIFF launching just six days after the Busan International Film Festival concludes on Oct. 15. Industry professionals and filmmakers could attend Busan before continuing to Singapore and Tokyo in rapid succession. However, the compressed timeline may challenge films seeking multiple Asian festival premieres, with programmers at both Singapore and Tokyo competing for the same titles.\n\n\tThe date change also takes SGIFF of the annual Singapore Media Festival celebrations, which also encompasses Singapore Comic Con and the Nas Summit. \n\n\tChua, previously the festival’s general manager, brings producing credits including “Filipinana” by Rafael Manuel, which won a Special Jury Prize in Sundance’s World Dramatic Competition earlier this year. His other credits include “Some Rain Must Fall” by Qiu Yang, which earned a Special Jury Prize at Berlinale Encounters 2024, and “Inside the Yellow Cocoon Shell” by Pham Thien An, winner of the Cannes Camera d’Or in 2023.\n\n\tSGIFF chair Boo Junfeng praised Chua’s industry knowledge and filmmaker perspective in the appointment announcement. “As a producer whose films have competed in and won our Silver Screen Awards, Jeremy brings a filmmaker’s perspective and a strong commitment to championing independent filmmakers while caring deeply about how their films can engage wider audiences,” Boo said.\n\n\tThe festival also announced that its Film Fund, which supports Southeast Asian documentary and short film production, will take a temporary hiatus for strategic restructuring. Established in 2018, the fund has distributed S$885,000 (approximately $700,000) to nearly 50 regional films through its SEA-Doc Grant and SEA-Shorts Grant programs.\n\n\tRecipients have included documentaries “Aswang” by Alyx Ayn Arumpac (Philippines, 2019) and “Monisme” by Riar Rizaldi (Indonesia, 2023), along with shorts “Mulberry Fields” by Nguyễn Trung Nghĩa (Vietnam, 2024) and “Bleat!” by Ananth Subramaniam (Malaysia, 2025).\n\n\t“This short hiatus gives us the necessary space to work closely with our partners to strengthen the SGIFF Film Fund for the long term,” Chua said. “Our commitment to filmmakers and the regional industry remains unchanged, and we look forward to relaunching the Fund later this year with a renewed framework that responds meaningfully to today’s production and distribution realities.”\n\t\n\n\tThe festival receives support from the Infocomm Media Development Authority. Additional programming details and the return of the film fund will be announced at a later date.\n\n\tSubmissions for Asian feature films and Southeast Asian short films will open April 9, 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRichard Kind is returning to “The Producers,” this time in London.\n\n\tThe Drama Desk Award winner is set to reprise the role of Max Bialystock in the critically acclaimed West End revival for seven weeks only, from March 23 to May 11. He’ll star opposite Marc Antolin’s Leo Bloom at the Garrick Theatre while Andy Nyman, who is currently playing Max, departs for the world premiere of “The Psychic.”\n\n\n\tKind previously played the role of Max on Broadway in 2004, succeeding Nathan Lane, and again in 2012 for a production at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. The Mel Brooks musical, which won 12 Tony Awards after opening in 2001, follows two theater producers who try to get rich by overselling interests in a Broadway musical designed to fail.\n\t\n\n\t“Mel Brooks is a genius,” Kind said in a statement. “Every time I come back to ‘The Producers,’ I’m reminded what a comic masterpiece it is — the jokes, the infectious energy of the story, the sheer audacity of it all — it still feels as fresh as ever. I’m so thrilled to be returning to the iconic role of Max Bialystock; this is a hat trick for me ‚ they just can’t keep me away! I’ll be sure to keep Andy’s fedora warm for his return, and I’m excited to dive into rehearsals. It’s good to be back.”\n\n\n\tAdded Brooks, “When I learned we needed an actor to briefly fill Andy’s nearly unfillable shoes, only one name came to mind. Richard Kind is a true force of nature — he’s got enough talent and energy to fill two stages! I am beyond thrilled for audiences at The Garrick to experience his Max Bialystock. London, get ready; you’re in for a hilarious ride!”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe premium streaming market in Southeast Asia gained significant momentum in 2025, powered by a resurgence in account growth, expanded connected TV adoption and a landmark year for locally produced programming, new data from Media Partners Asia and its measurement platform AMPD shows.\n\n\tPaid streaming accounts across the region increased 19% year-over-year to exceed 61 million across Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore in 2025. Indonesia dominated new account additions and consumed the largest portion of total watch time, while Thailand and the Philippines contributed consistent incremental expansion. In Malaysia and Singapore, where markets have reached saturation, operators focused on boosting user activity and revenue generation rather than adding subscribers.\n\t\n\n\tSoutheast Asian viewers consumed 4.2 billion hours of premium streaming content in the final quarter of 2025, up 8% from the previous quarter. Netflix‘s regional viewing jumped 14% while iQIYI climbed 10%, though Indonesian service Vidio posted the sharpest increase at 24%.\n\n\n\tIndonesia’s streaming subscriber base expanded to 26.9 million accounts, with Netflix, Vidio, Viu and iQIYI all contributing to the gains. The market reached a historic milestone in Q4 2025 as Indonesian productions equaled Korean programming in viewership share at 30% each, while both content types reached nearly identical portions of the user base at 47-48%. Several Indonesian originals placed among the quarter’s top-performing titles, led predominantly by Vidio’s content lineup, demonstrating how homegrown productions are becoming commercially viable drivers of subscriber acquisition and retention.\n\t\n\n\t“Korean content continued to anchor reach across Southeast Asia in 2025, but local originals are now playing a far more central role in driving both acquisition and engagement,” said Dhivya T, lead analyst and head of insights at MPA and AMPD. “Indonesia stood out this year, with local titles competing directly with Korean dramas at the top of the premium VOD rankings. This is a meaningful shift that reflects improving content quality, stronger distribution and rising audience confidence in local storytelling. Thai content also demonstrated strong cross-border travelability, while Chinese dramas remained a key engagement driver on freemium and hybrid platforms across multiple markets.”\n\n\tNetflix held its position as the region’s dominant streaming service across all key metrics including subscriber count, monthly active users and total watch time. The platform’s strength came from its combination of global hit franchises, major Korean series and locally acquired content from Indonesia and Thailand. Viu claimed the second spot regionally in subscribers, MAUs and user engagement for 2025, benefiting from consistent appetite for Korean and Chinese dramas alongside targeted local productions.\n\n\tVidio led among Indonesian local platforms in both subscribers and monthly active users while placing second to Netflix in watch time and revenue generation. The service recorded the region’s second-highest streaming hours in Q4 trailing only Netflix, propelled by an expanding library of Indonesian originals and sports programming. iQIYI regained subscriber and viewership momentum in the latter half of 2025, especially in Indonesia and Thailand, driven by full-length Chinese dramas, live-action productions, Chinese short-form dramas and Thai series.\n\n\tThai productions achieved the strongest international reach within Southeast Asia, drawing 11.1 million viewers from outside Thailand’s borders. This performance stemmed largely from Netflix-licensed and Netflix-produced horror films and series.\n\n\tAMPD’s expansion of connected TV tracking beginning in Q2 2025 uncovered a substantial shift in how Southeast Asian audiences consume streaming content. Although mobile devices continue to serve as the dominant viewing platform, connected TVs now account for an increasing portion of total watch hours, longer individual viewing sessions, and greater interaction with episodic series, feature films, sports broadcasts and content watched by multiple household members. The growth in connected TV usage proved most dramatic in Indonesia and the Philippines, highlighting how living room viewing on large screens is becoming central to the streaming category’s evolution.\n\t\n\n\tIndustry concentration intensified as three to four platforms captured roughly 70% of subscriptions and viewing activity across markets, indicating the sector is consolidating around a small group of leading services.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKorean sales powerhouse Finecut has bolstered its European Film Market offerings with two new acquisitions: the 3D animated feature “Long Long Night” and auteur Hong Sangsoo‘s latest work “The Day She Returns,” which has been selected for the Panorama section at the 76th Berlin Film Festival.\n\n\t“Long Long Night” adapts an award-winning Korean novel that has sold 700,000 copies locally. The source material earned the Grand Prize at the 2020 Munhakdongne Children’s Literature Award and was featured on the International Youth Library’s 2021 White Ravens list in Munich. International editions have been released in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Türkiye, with a Chinese version forthcoming. The property has also been adapted into a stage musical.\n\t\n\n\tThe animated feature tells the story of the last rhino of his kind who befriends a penguin hatched from an abandoned egg, embarking on a journey to the ocean together. The narrative draws inspiration from Sudan, the last surviving northern white rhino on Earth. Director Youm Kyu-bock is utilizing Unreal Engine, a real-time 3D creation platform, to achieve realistic detailed imagery. Currently in production, the film is produced by Googgoog and Studio Eon, with presentation by The Contents On.\n\n\n\t“The Day She Returns” is Hong Sangsoo’s 34th feature film and marks his seventh year at the Berlinale, following his most recent title “What Does That Nature Say to You” (2025). The film follows an actor giving promotional interviews to support her comeback film, a process that proves more difficult than anticipated. The project reunites Hong with actress Song Sunmi, who previously starred in his “In Our Day” (2023), which closed the Cannes Directors’ Fortnight. Following its world premiere at the Berlinale, the film is scheduled for theatrical release in the first half of 2026. Jeonwonsa Film Co. serves as producer.\n\t\n\n\tFinecut’s EFM slate also includes “Tristes Tropiques,” an action-noir from genre director Park Hoon-jung currently in post-production. The film’s initial cut premiered in the Òrbita Competition section at Sitges.\n\n\tAdditional titles include “Journey There,” starring Justin H. Min of Netflix’s “The Umbrella Academy,” which won two awards at the Busan International Film Festival. The drama follows an elderly woman who finds comfort with strangers while navigating end-of-life decisions.\n\n\tThe lineup is rounded out by “Wrangler,” a psychological thriller about a dog trainer whose controlled life begins to unravel, which was invited to Vancouver, and “Time of Cinema,” an anthology featuring works from three Korean directors: Lee Jong-pil, Yoon Ga-eun and Jang Kun-jae.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKorean entertainment giant CJ ENM celebrated the creative forces behind six globally successful original IPs at its 2026 Visionary Awards ceremony on Feb. 10 at the CJ ENM Center in Seoul’s Mapo-gu district.\n\n\tThe event honored visionaries from U.S. series “Severance” and Korean productions “Bon Appétit, Your Majesty,” “Boys II Planet,” “Our Unwritten Seoul” and “Study Group,” along with the Japanese adaptation of “Marry My Husband” – marking CJ ENM’s continued expansion into international co-productions and overseas projects. The ceremony drew particular attention for bringing together creators from both Korean productions and global collaborations, including “Severance” producer Nicholas Weinstock and Japanese actor Takeru Satoh from “Marry My Husband.”\n\t\n\n\tSince 2020, CJ ENM has designated as “Visionaries” the creators and projects that have introduced fresh creative visions to the entertainment industry and expanded their cultural footprint globally through distinctive originality. This year’s selections focused on characters as a core driver of IP competitiveness, recognizing the actors who portrayed beloved characters alongside the directors, producers and writers who brought them to life.\n\n\n\tThe awards venue was designed around the theme of an “Originality Construction Site,” conceived as a space for building a House of Inspiration – symbolizing a place where one story does not end but a new one begins.\n\n\tWeinstock praised the ceremony’s focus on creative ambition over commercial metrics. “I’m very excited about the commitment that many of us in this room are making to telling great and bold stories,” he said. “I think there’s a reason CJ ENM is giving the Visionary Award rather than a quarterly revenues award. I believe it’s a company devoted to boldness and creativity.” The producer also expressed admiration for presenter Youn Yuh-jung, a 2021 Visionary and the first Korean actor to receive an Academy Award. “I watched ‘Minari’ three times in a row just to see her performance,” Weinstock said.\n\t\n\n\tTakeru Satoh reflected on character development. “As actors, we are constantly thinking about how to make the roles we play more compelling and more loved by the audiences,” he said. “It’s a great honor to be here with all of you professionals who create these unforgettable characters.”\n\n\tPark Min Young from “Marry My Husband” described the project as transformative. “This project was like a second chance in my life. While it tells a Korean story, I learned that sincerity resonates with audiences worldwide,” she said.\n\n\tFrom “Bon Appétit, Your Majesty,” Lim YoonA shared her connection to her character. “It was a great joy to portray Yeon Ji-young, a strong and wise character who never loses her dream, no matter the circumstances,” she said.\n\n\tIn a congratulatory video message, CJ Group vice chair Miky Lee emphasized the power of storytelling. “Technology has brought the world closer than ever, but it is stories that truly bring people together,” she said. “CJ ENM will be your partner in this journey.”\n\n\tCJ ENM CEO Yoon Sang-hyun added: “The most compelling stories begin with characters shaped together by creators and artists. We will expand Onlyone IPs, stories that become life-defining works for audiences worldwide and build a new ecosystem for the global cultural business.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRoh Films Germany is returning to India for its first local production since “The Lunchbox” (2013), partnering with First Ray Films India on noir thriller “But First, The Burning.”\n\n\tThe film will be directed by Indian filmmaker Devashish Makhija and star Anshuman Jha. France’s En Compagnie des Lamas (“Manto”), led by Sandrine Brauer, is confirmed to join as French producer. Details will be finalised at the Berlin European Film Market. \n\t\n\n\t“But First, The Burning” follows two brothers sharing one identity in a desperate town, where a small deceit meant to double their chances at survival spirals into a deadly game of secrets with only one survivor.\n\n\n\tMakhija’s internationally recognized filmography includes “Joram,” “Bhonsle” and “Ajji.” His Netflix thriller “Gandhari” is due this year. Jha has built a diverse career across projects including “Love Sex Aur Dhokha,” “Chauranga” and “Lakadbaggha.” \n\n\tThe film is scheduled to begin production in October, following the release of Jha’s action sequel “Lakadbaggha 2.” Jha will represent the film in Berlin as leading actor and executive producer.\n\n\t“Integrity. Conviction. And unadulterated vision – is the basis of this partnership,” Jha said. “We are thrilled to have Roh and Lamas on board for this film which would mark our seventh production. And probably the most ambitious one with one of my favorite cinema makers in India – Devashish.”\n\n\tBenny Drechsel of Roh Films Germany said: “I really think that ‘But First, The Burning’ is probably the most compelling script from India since ‘The Lunchbox.'”\n\n\tSandrine Brauer of Lamas added: “I’m very proud to join forces with the creative duo formed by Anshuman and Devashish. Their film casts a lucid, uncompromising, yet deeply necessary light on the spiral of violence. Devashish’s previous films already reveal a distinctive and promising voice, with a rare ability to take us on powerful and compelling cinematic journeys.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tUPDATED: The Pima County Sheriff’s Department announced on X Tuesday night that it, in collaboration with the FBI, had detained a person for questioning in connection with the disappearance of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie‘s 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie. A man was then released several hours later, according to CBS News, the New York Times and others.\n\n\tThe man, identified only as Carlos, spoke to reporters after his release and said he doesn’t know who Nancy Guthrie is and was shocked to be detained. “I didn’t do anything. … I’m innocent,” he said.\n\t\n\n\tAuthorities have not confirmed that he was the person of interest or that the subject detained has been released, however a spokesperson for the Sheriff’s Department confirmed to the New York Times had “completed their search of a property in Rio Rico,” where the person was detained.\n\n\n\tThe Pima County Sheriff’s Department said the person was detained south of Tucson, Ariz. during a traffic stop. Authorities told ABC that law enforcement is preparing to search a location in relation to the detainee. There was no indication whether the detainee was the individual in the front door photos released on Tuesday morning.\n\n\tNancy Guthrie, 84, disappeared from her Arizona home on Jan. 31, triggering an intensive investigation that has brought “Today” show co-anchor Savannah Guthrie’s personal tragedy into the public eye.\n\n\tThe Pima County Sheriff’s Office declared the disappearance a crime on Feb. 2 after investigators discovered “concerning” evidence at Nancy’s home. Sheriff Chris Nanos said he believed Nancy “did not leave on her own.” Authorities have not identified any suspects, and they received an alleged ransom note with deadlines set for Friday, Feb. 6, and Monday, Feb. 9.\n\t\n\n\tSavannah shared a message Monday on Instagram as the search for her missing mother entered its second week. “We’re at an hour of desperation,” she said in the video message.\n\n\tFormer co-anchor Hoda Kotb also returned to the “Today” show on Monday, filling in alongside Craig Melvin while Savannah remained with her family in Arizona. “We are a family, and we show up for each other,” Kotb said during the broadcast.\n\n\tThe FBI offered a $50,000 reward Thursday for information leading to Nancy’s recovery “and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.” FBI Special Agent in Charge Heith Janke said agents are “working day and night” with local authorities.\n\n\tOn Saturday, the Guthrie siblings posted another video expressing their willingness to pay a ransom. “We received your message, and we understand,” Savannah said, sitting beside by siblings Camron and Annie. “We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”\n\n\tThis followed an emotional video shared to Instagram on Wednesday in which the siblings pleaded for proof of life. “She’s 84 years old. Her health, her heart, is fragile,” Savannah said. “We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Hong Kong International Film Festival Society has finalized the program for the 24th Hong Kong-Asia Film Financing Forum (HAF), adding 13 projects featuring McDull creator Brian Tse, Sundance winner Alireza Ghasemi and Turkish director Tayfun Pirselimoglu to complete a 42-title lineup set for presentation March 17-19 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.\n\n\tThe final batch comprises seven animated features and six genre works at various development and production stages, joining 29 previously announced in-development and work-in-progress projects. All titles will be showcased at the HKIFF Industry Project Market alongside FilMart, now in its 30th edition.\n\t\n\n\tThree of the newly announced projects are in production or post-production: Brian Tse’s “The Excreman – On the Road,” Avid Liongoren’s “Zsazsa Zaturnnah” and Qin Yuqi’s suspense thriller “What My Bones Know.” The trio will pitch at the WIP Open Pitch session on March 17 alongside the previously announced 12 work-in-progress titles.\n\n\n\tHAF’s dedicated animation section, launched last year, has quickly established a track record for festival success. Xu Zao’s “Light Pillar” is set to premiere at Berlinale’s Perspectives section this month, while Toe Yuen’s “A Mighty Adventure” won the Golden Horse Award for best sound effects last November. Both projects emerged from the section’s inaugural edition.\n\n\tThe animation slate features Tse, creator of the McDull franchise, directing “The Excreman – On the Road,” about a massive piece of excrement that defeats a plumber dispatched to cleanse a sewer community, then assumes the plumber’s identity to begin a new human life.\n\t\n\n\tJhun Yong Duk, co-director of “The Tiger’s Apprentice,” helms “Fish Ball,” following a ruthless general reborn as a sardine who leads an underwater army against predators using military tactics.\n\n\tAlireza Ghasemi, whose “In the Land of Brothers” won the Sundance World Cinema Dramatic Competition’s directing award in 2024, directs “Rainy Dreams,” a hybrid animation-live action work tracking six displaced children in Calais as they navigate their fears and aspirations through nightly dreams.\n\n\tChen Xudong makes his feature debut with stop-motion monster film “Roxanne,” set in a post-apocalyptic ocean and following a boy born at sea searching for humanity’s last hope. The project is produced by Lu Xiaowei, whose “Light Pillar” screens at Berlinale Perspectives this year.\n\n\tCarl Josep E. Papa, whose “The Missing” won best animated film at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards in 2024, directs multi-perspective drama “Sentinel,” centered on a transfer student, editor-in-chief and school principal who clash when a campus newspaper article exposes violence in the school’s military training program.\n\n\tProducer Isabelle Glachant reunites with director Lei Lei on “Tooth and Tales,” a fairy tale about a boy searching for the story that can heal his toothache. Lei’s “Silver Bird and Rainbow Fish” competed in Rotterdam’s Tiger Competition in 2022.\n\n\tLiongoren, whose “Hayop Ka!” competed at Annecy in 2020, directs “Zsazsa Zaturnnah,” about a shy gay hairdresser who swallows a space rock that transforms him into a flamboyant female superhero, compelling him to battle zombies and aliens.\n\n\tThe genre slate spans psychological thrillers, body horror and action drama across diverse international settings. Zhou Jinghao, whose “Girl on Edge” screened in Cannes Directors’ Fortnight in 2025, directs suspense drama “In the Name of Right” about a maintenance worker whose decision to help a struggling employee triggers a fatal accident. Leste Chen produces.\n\n\tTayfun Pirselimoglu, whose “Kerr” served as Turkey’s Academy Awards submission in 2023, helms crime thriller “The Power Plant,” following a dangerous liaison between a married meatball vendor and an excavator operator amid mutilated murders in a snow-covered mining town.\n\n\tPark Kiyong, director of “Gangwondo” in 2021, helms action drama “Searchers: Blood in the Grass,” tracking a Korean apple farmer who teams with his reluctant Mongolian father-in-law to rescue his pregnant wife from a powerful political dynasty involved in international fentanyl trafficking.\n\t\n\n\tLam Li Shuen, co-director of “Born of the Yam,” which screens in Berlinale Forum Expanded this year, directs mythological body horror “Strange Root” (Keinginan), set in 11th-century Singapore and featuring a demi-god born from a yam who is driven toward violent and erotic confrontation after being cast aside.\n\n\tGabriel Motta makes his feature debut with supernatural horror “The Veil,” exploring violence within faith and family through a religious cult founded on fake possession rituals that descends into darkness when a vengeful entity genuinely possesses the pastor’s daughter. Motta’s short film “The Veil” screened at Toronto in 2025.\n\n\tQin’s debut “What My Bones Know” is set in a freezing, dying mining town and entangles a college graduate, a terminally ill miner and a runaway accountant, all drawn to a local tavern following the discovery of a severed ear.\n\n\tAll work-in-progress projects will pitch March 17 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre’s Starlight Theatre, with teams presenting 10-minute first looks to industry attendees including distributors, producers, investors, festival programmers and funding representatives.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLilah Kojoori, the vice president of communications for Nickelodeon and Paramount+ Kids & Family, is stepping down. \n\n\tKojoori has been with Nickelodeon since 2006. She shared the news of her exit with her team in an internal memo, which reads in part, “I feel incredibly fortunate to have shared this journey with you, and I know that while my role here may be ending, the friendships and connections we’ve built will continue.”\n\n\n\tThe full memo can be read below. \n\t\n\n\tIn her time at Nickelodeon, Kojoori has worked on some of the biggest shows in the network’s history. That includes “Avatar: The Last Airbender,” “SpongeBob Squarepants,” “Victorious,” “Big Time Rush,” “Henry Danger,” “The Thundermans,” and many more. She has also recently worked on reboots of several Nickelodeon properties, like “Good Burger 2” and the revival of “iCarly” at Paramount+. \n\n\tShe has also worked closely with a wide range of stars who got their start at Nickelodeon, like Ariana Grande, Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Victoria Justice, Keke Palmer, Jace Norman, Breanna Yde, Jack Griffo, Kira Kosarin, Isabela Merced, and JoJo Siwa.\n\n\tKojoori was also instrumental in her work on marquee events like the Kids’ Choice Awards and the network’s presence at things like the Super Bowl, San Diego Comic-Con, and VidCon. \n\n\tMemo from Lilah Kojoori\n\n\tAfter more than two decades at Nickelodeon and Paramount+ Kids & Family, I’ve made the bittersweet decision to close this chapter of my career. It has been an extraordinary privilege to help shape the stories, events, and campaigns that have defined so many milestone moments for kids and families – whether it was championing shows like iCarly, Big Time Rush, Double Dare, Victorious, School Spirits, Good Burger 2 and SpongeBob SquarePants, or building unforgettable experiences at Comic-Con and the Kids’ Choice Awards. None of it would have been possible without the brilliant, dedicated team I had the honor of working alongside.\n\t\n\n\tWhat I’ll miss most, though, are the people – the colleagues who became collaborators, mentors, and friends. I feel incredibly fortunate to have shared this journey with you, and I know that while my role here may be ending, the friendships and connections we’ve built will continue. Thank you all for the creativity, heart, and support that made this such an unforgettable experience.\n",

    "description": "\n\tQuentin Tarantino‘s entire filmography is set to get the coffee table book treatment from Insight Editions.\n\n\tThe series kicks off with “The Making ",
    "body": "\n\tQuentin Tarantino‘s entire filmography is set to get the coffee table book treatment from Insight Editions.\n\n\tThe series kicks off with “The Making of Quentin Tarantino’s ‘Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood’” out on Tuesday. Author Jay Glennie teases that he also plans a book on Tarantino’s forthcoming tenth and final film once its released. Details about the director’s swan song remain a mystery, as Tarantino has written and disregarded a few ideas since completing “Once Upon a Time” in 2019. Glennie claims to know nothing about the next film, but he will surely write about it. “I haven’t even discussed that one,” says Glennie, “I’ll cross that bridge when I get there.”\n\t\n\n\tThe first book tells the full story of how the director’s most recent film came to be, from Tarantino’s seedling of an idea after seeing a stunt double and actor chat it up on-set, to the film’s FYC campaign during the 2020 awards season. Stocked with copious interviews with the cast and crew, and featuring behind-the-scenes photos from Tarantino and Sony Pictures’ collections — many taken by set photographer Andrew Cooper — the weighty book is both a richly researched account of the film and a work of art in its own right.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGlennie has written books on the likes of “Performance,” “Raging Bull” and “The Deer Hunter,” and as his latest book’s introduction by Tarantino recounts, it was their common love of Michael Cimino’s 1978 Oscar winner that led the two cinephiles to meet for the first time. Tarantino writes that at the end of his first conversation with Glennie, he offered, “If you ever want to give one of my flicks the Jay Glennie Treatment, gimme a ring.”\n\t\n\n\tGlennie adds, “He loved my previous books, which was, as you can bloody imagine, hugely gratifying to hear.” The author took the filmmaker up on his word, as they planned not just one, but ten books on Tarantino’s movies. Regarding the decision to start with “Once Upon a Time,” Glennie told Tarantino, “If we’re cooking up an idea to do a whole lot of deep dives, let’s go right to the end and let’s do ‘Once Upon a Time’ because it’s one of my favorites. I love the movie. It sounds a bit cheesy, but it was just an instant classic.”\n\n\tWith Tarantino on board, Glennie connected with the rest of the film’s cast and crew, piecing together the movie’s full story from the insider perspectives of Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie, Al Pacino, Margaret Qualley, Austin Butler, Mikey Madison, Maya Hawke, Dakota Fanning, Kurt Russell, producers David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, assistant director Bill Clark, Sony Pictures president Tom Rothman and many more. \n\n\tNo vantage point is too big or small, as the book includes multiple accounts of seemingly every decision made from pre-production through release. Memorable stories include Sharon Tate’s sister gifting Robbie the late actress’ perfume, the director striking a deal with the owner of the Playboy Mansion to shoot on the iconic property, location scouts knocking on doors in the Hollywood Hills to find the perfect driveway for a specific crane shot and production designer Barbara Ling creating the actual Rick Dalton board game seen in the background of the character’s house — a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it prop that Tarantino appreciated so much that he halted the shoot so the crew could play.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGlennie says that everyone he interviewed was “talking about a film that they absolutely adore,” and were generally pleased to revisit memories from the film time and time again. Even the studio heads at Sony were enthusiastic partners. “As soon as I mentioned it to Tom (Rothman), his team just said, ‘Yeah, whatever you need,’” Glennie says, “There’s a huge amount of trust in that. I don’t take that lightly.”\n\n\tThe author has already finished writing the next book in the series, which focuses on Tarantino’s sixth film, 2009’s “Inglourious Basterds.” He is currently writing the third book, focusing on the director’s seventh film, 2012’s “Django Unchained.” Tarantino will write introductions for each of the books and they will be released in 2026 and 2027, respectively.\n\t\n\n\t“Quentin is such a distinctive guy. We decided we weren’t going to go chronologically. You’re going to have film nine, film six, and then film seven. Hopefully by the end of it, you’re gonna have to reinforce your book shelf,” jokes Glennie, adding, “I think ‘Reservoir Dogs’ is going to be the fourth and then ‘Pulp Fiction.’ We’ll play it by ear after that.” \n\n\tThe author does, however, plan to publish a single book for both “Kill Bill: Vol 1” and “Vol 2,” as Tarantino intended the two movies to be seen as one. They are even being rereleased as such this December as “Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair.”\n\n\tTo complete the ten-volume library, Glennie is unsure if he will try to document the making of Tarantino’s next film in real time, on-set, or if he will allow for distance and write the book via the same research tactics that he applies to the other nine volumes.\n\n\t“I wouldn’t mind giving it some distance,” he said. After all, Glennie is a film historian, with his previous books focusing on titles from past decades. “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood” is by far his most contemporary topic, though he notes, “It feels like it could be in that same canon of work. It doesn’t feel like it was made in 2019.”\n\n\tOf the writing and research process, Glennie says, “It’s been a joy from the get-go to now, but the biggest joy has been the trust that people have given me to tell this story. With that there’s a huge amount of pressure, though. You can’t bastardize that trust. You’ve got to earn it. You’ve got to deliver.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe fate of “Doctor Who” has been revealed, with Disney+ officially exiting the series after its two-season partnership with the BBC.\n\n\tAfter months of speculation as to where the long-running sci-fi show would be headed following lead Ncuti Gatwa’s departure in May and without a Season 3 renewal, the BBC has announced that it will be moving forward with a new Christmas special in 2026 penned by series stalwart Russell T Davies.\n\n\n\t“We’d like to thank Disney+ for being terrific global partners and collaborators over the past two seasons, and for the upcoming ‘The War Between the Land and the Sea,'” Lindsay Salt, director of drama at the BBC, said in a statement. “The BBC remains fully committed to ‘Doctor Who,’ which continues to be one of our most loved dramas, and we are delighted that Russell T Davies has agreed to write us another spectacular Christmas special for 2026. We can assure fans, the Doctor is not going anywhere, and we will be announcing plans for the next series in due course which will ensure the TARDIS remains at the heart of the BBC.”\n\t\n\n\t“The War Between the Land and the Sea,” a “Doctor Who” spinoff starring Russell Tovey and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, is due on Disney+ as well as BBC One and BBC iPlayer later this year. A brand-new “Doctor Who” animated series is also in development at CBeebies, the BBC’s kids’ channel. \n\n\tIt remains to be seen who will be stepping into the iconic Doctor’s shoes after Gatwa’s two-season stint. The Season 2 finale saw Gatwa’s Doctor regenerate into Billie Piper, who previously played companion Rose Tyler in Series 1 (2005) and Series 2 (2006), though it has not been confirmed if she will be the next Doctor.\n\t\n\n\tSaid Tyler in a statement to the BBC after the Season 2 finale: “It’s no secret how much I love this show, and I have always said I would love to return to the Whoniverse as I have some of my best memories there, so to be given the opportunity to step back on that Tardis one more time was just something I couldn’t refuse, but who, how, why and when, you’ll just have to wait and see.”\n",

In previous years, to be eligible for the Gothams, a film’s budget couldn’t exceed $35 million. Past best feature winners have included “Spotlight” (2015), “Moonlight” (2016) and “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (2022), all of which went on to win best picture at the Oscars. The removal of budget caps was essentially a non-factor in 2024, with the only nominee from a big-budget film being Ryan Gosling in “Barbie.” Now, with “One Battle’s” budget exceeding $130 million, it feels out of place among the smaller indie titles in its categories.\n\t\n\n\tThe other films nominated for best feature, which now has 10 nominees, include “Bugonia,” “East of Wall,” “Familiar Touch,” “Hamnet,” “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” “Lurker,” “Sorry, Baby,” “The Testament of Ann Lee” and “Train Dreams.”\n\n\n\tIn addition to “One Battle After Another,” several major contenders scored multiple nominations. The best director category includes Mary Bronstein (“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”), Jafar Panahi (“It Was Just an Accident”), Kelly Reichardt (“The Mastermind”), Paul Thomas Anderson (“One Battle After Another”) and Oliver Laxe (“Sirât”).\n\n\tThe lead acting lineup, which is in its fourth year as a gender-neutral category, features best actress frontrunner Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”) and other acting hopefuls such as Lee Byung-hun (“No Other Choice”), Rose Byrne (“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”), Ethan Hawke (“Blue Moon”), Jennifer Lawrence (“Die My Love”), Amanda Seyfried (“The Testament of Ann Lee”) and Tessa Thompson (“Hedda”) among others.\n\t\n\n\tSupporting performance nominees include Jacob Elordi’s transformative work as the Monster in “Frankenstein,” “Sinners” standout performer Wunmi Mosaku,  and former Gotham acting winner Adam Sandler for his turn in “Jay Kelly.” \n\n\tBreakthrough performers include A$AP Rocky (“Highest 2 Lowest”), Sebiye Behtiyar (“Preparation for the Next Life”), Chase Infiniti (“One Battle After Another”), Abou Sangaré (“Souleymane’s Story”) and Tonatiuh (“Kiss of the Spider Woman”).\n\n\tAmong the notable omissions is “Sentimental Value,” Norway’s Oscar submission in international feature, which wasn’t among the nominees at the Gothams, and missed out on a best feature nom, along with its leading actress, Renate Reinsve. However, supporting players Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas and Stellan Skarsgård were recognized. Other contenders, such as “Marty Supreme” and “Is This Thing On?,” were not submitted because they were not finished on time for committee members to vote on.\n\n\tNominees were selected by committees of film critics, journalists, programmers and curators, with final winners determined by separate juries of filmmakers, producers, editors and actors.\n\n\tJeffrey Sharp, executive director of the Gotham Film & Media Institute, praised this year’s nominees for their creativity and diversity of storytelling. “This year’s nominees celebrate an extraordinary year of cinematic achievement — one defined by bold, original storytelling, festival breakouts and filmmakers whose independent vision extends across studios and streamers,” Sharp said in a statement. “These nominees, and our Gotham Tributes, reflect the year’s most accomplished filmmakers and performers and embody the community that has defined The Gothams for 35 years.”\n\n\tSee the full list of nominations below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTrain Dreams.

    "body": "\n\tWhen Jamie Lee Curtis was shooting “Fierce Creatures” in London in 1996, Princess Diana came by the set with her two little princes.\n\n\tIt had been a long day, and Curtis was on a much-needed pee break when the royal family arrived. Unfortunately, by the time she made the mile-long journey back from the bathroom in her golf cart, Diana and the boys were gone. So Curtis wrote the princess a letter, which she left at Kensington Palace, saying how sorry she was not to have met her, and how much she admired her. Curtis explained about the long day and the bathroom break and the golf cart.\n\t\n\n\t“Diana wrote back,” Curtis says today from her porch overlooking a lush Santa Monica canyon. “She was like, ‘Totally get it: Been there, done that. I admire you too. It’d be nice to meet you someday.” Curtis barely pauses and says, “She died a year later.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSami Drasin for Variety Magazine\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere is banana bread that Curtis made “in the dark” early that morning and small, foamy cups of strong cappuccino. There is a little white dog, Runi, whom Curtis talks to in a high-pitched voice. Later, she’ll sign 15 children’s books she’s written over the years and put them in a tote for my 3-month-old grandson. Curtis is, I would say, proudly domestic and aggressively generous, sometimes in a hoovering mother kind of way. (On my way out, she’ll ask, “Do you need to pee or poop before you go?”)\n\n\tThe day that Princess Diana died, Curtis sat on her bed in this same house, where she lives with her husband of 41 years, Christopher Guest, and instead of watching, on a loop, the televised images of the tunnel where Diana was killed, she turned off the TV and picked up a book by Insight Meditation guru Jack Kornfield that a friend had given her. “The opening pages say that anyone who has tried to live mindfully at the time of their death asks themselves two questions: Did I learn to live wisely? Did I love well? And I remember sitting there and thinking about Diana’s life, and about her getting out of this bullshit marriage; her bravery at the beginning of the AIDS crisis when she reached out to a man with AIDS and put her hand on his leg; her walking through those minefields. Just her beautiful humanness. And I thought, ‘She learned to live wisely. And yeah, she loved well.’ That has stayed with me.”\n\t\n\n\tCurtis is thinking about the spectacle of Diana’s death, because yesterday she was on Marc Maron’s “WTF” podcast talking about her new movie, “Freakier Friday,” and plugging “The Lost Bus,” which she produced with Jason Blum, when she and Maron got onto the subject of Charlie Kirk, the Christian nationalist who’d been assassinated a few days before. Probably because she has been a longtime advocate for LGBTQ rights (her daughter Ruby is trans), no one expected Curtis to cry about the death of a man who said, “The transgender thing happening in America now is a throbbing middle finger to God.” And not everyone understood how she could say she hoped his god had been with him at the moment of his passing.\n\n\tSo the backlash over the interview was fierce, relentless and “threatening.” “An excerpt of it mistranslated what I was saying as I wished him well — like I was talking about him in a very positive way, which I wasn’t; I was simply talking about his faith in God. And so it was a mistranslation, which is a pun, but not. In the binary world today, you cannot hold two ideas at the same time: I cannot be Jewish and totally believe in Israel’s right to exist and at the same time reject the destruction of Gaza. You can’t say that, because you get vilified for having a mind that says, ‘I can hold both those thoughts. I can be contradictory in that way.’”\n\n\tBeing a public figure, she must have to be careful, I say, and she sits up straight and glares at me.\n\n\t“I don’t have to be careful,” she says sharply. “If I was careful, I wouldn’t have told you any of what I just told you. I would have just said, ‘Hi, welcome. I baked you banana bread. Here’s my dog. Here’s my house, blah, blah, blah. What do you want to know?’ I can’t not be who I am in the moment I am.”\n\n\n\tIt takes an iconic royal to know an iconic royal. At 66, Curtis downplays her childhood with her famous parents, Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, saying that she had a “comfortable, not fancy” L.A. life with her mother and Marine stepfather after her father “abandoned” the family for a 17-year-old. She says: “Show business wasn’t evident to me as a child. I mean, there are a couple pictures of me on sets with my sister, but I don’t have a memory of any of it — any of it, just none of it.”\n\n\tBut the fact is, whatever powerful juju ran through her parents’ veins was passed on to their daughter, so much so that she’s been a part of the American consciousness since she was 19, when she headlined “Halloween,” the template-setting slasher film. Furthermore, she’s remained that famous for the next 47 years and counting, winning an Oscar and an Emmy late in her career.\n\t\n\n\tBut back when she was a kid, she thought of herself as someone with “no tangible abilities: I was a D+ student — C- if you graded on a curve. I was a cheerleader.” She’s holding a bit of banana bread between her fingers as Guest pads around the kitchen in bare feet behind her. “I was kind of a weirdo. I was” — she points to herself — “this girl at 16, full of energy and personality. But I had no intelligence. You know, I wasn’t an athlete, I wasn’t in the plays. And I became an actor by accident.”\n\n\tCurtis credits a series of strong women with helping her evolve from an “incurious” child to a person with a formidable mind and an uncanny ability to raise money.\n\n\tShe starts with her mother — most famous for her part in “Psycho”— who, when Curtis was a little girl, joined a group called Share, started in the 1950s by the wives of Hollywood stars to raise money for children’s causes in L.A. Part of Share was an annual star-studded show called the Boomtown Party. Curtis watched rehearsals at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium every year, and it stuck with her, seeing her mother don a cowboy outfit and dance with Steve McQueen’s wife, Neile Adams McQueen; and Altovise Davis, who was married to Sammy Davis Jr., all to support kids less fortunate than herself.\n\n\tBeing friends with Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Curtis’ mother was also involved with the Special Olympics at UCLA, which Shriver started in 1968. “This was the beginning of the Special Olympics at UCLA,” Curtis says, “and celebrities would come to walk the opening ceremonies. Curtis and her mother went every year.\n\n\t“I raised my hand when I was 15,” she says. “What if we call Polaroid and get them to donate cameras? I’ll set up a booth, and then we can take Polaroids of the athletes with a celebrity and give them the Polaroid.”\n\n\tShriver liked the idea, and Curtis ran the booth for years. “Four years into it, when I was 19, Eunice called me and said, ‘We’d like you to be in the pictures this year, because you were on TV.’”\n\n\n\tAbout that television appearance.\n\t\n\n\tWhen she was home for Christmas break after her first semester at college, Curtis visited a friend in Beverly Hills. The friend had a tennis court where her family took lessons from a guy named Chuck Binder. He called out to her from the court, “Hey, Jamie!”\n\n\t“I knew him for years,” she says. “And it was like, ‘Hey, Chuck.’ And he was like, ‘They’re looking for Nancy Drew at Universal. I’m managing actors now.’” Curtis interrupts herself to say, “Show business, right? You’re a tennis teacher; now you’re managing actors.” Then she continues her story: “He goes, ‘You should go up for it; you’d be good.’ I was like, ‘OK.’”\n\n\tCurtis auditioned for “Nancy Drew” and didn’t get the part, but it gave her an idea: What if she did a monthlong independent project where she’d try to break into show business and write a paper about it? She called someone at the school, and they agreed.\n\n\tA few days before she was scheduled to go back to college, Binder sent her to audition for Monique James, who was the VP of new talent at Universal Studios. (“Women get shit done,” Curtis says of James.) Curtis brought in a kid from acting class, and they did a scene, and when they were done, Curtis turned to James and said (she does this like she’s a gum-chewing airhead): “Hey, listen, this was fun. Thank you so much. I loooved it. Listen, honestly, here’s what the problem is: I’m going back to college in two days, so I need to know if this is going to happen.” She drops the airhead shtick. “They called me the next day, and they offered me a contract. I dropped out of college and became an actor, bringing in $235 a week.”\n\n\tCurtis moved into a stucco-ceilinged one-bedroom apartment on Mary Ellen Avenue in the Valley, furnishing it with the wicker bedroom set from her childhood and a Naugahyde couch. She got bit parts on “Quincy, M.E.,” “The Hardy Boys” and “Columbo,” and then she snagged a role on both the film remake and the TV show “Operation Petticoat,” about Army nurses who get stuck on a Navy submarine.\n\n\tThen James invited her to lunch and told her she was fired; ABC was revamping the show, and she was one of 11 actors to be let go. Curtis drove home to her “shitty little apartment, thinking, ‘Oh, fuck, I’m gonna have to move home. I’m gonna have to go back to college!’”\n\n\tA week or so after that, Binder called. “They’re casting this low-budget horror film out of an office on Cahuenga,” he said. “The director is up-and-coming.” That director was John Carpenter, and the film was “Halloween.”\n\n\t“If I hadn’t gotten fired,” Curtis says, “I would have never auditioned for ‘Halloween,’ which then became something important, right? And then the rest of my life happened.”\n\t\n\n\n\tWe’ve all watched her films over the decades: Maybe we saw the early run of horror films that made Curtis the ultimate final girl and gave her the title of “scream queen.” Many of us have seen “Trading Places,” “A Fish Called Wanda,” “My Girl,” “True Lies,” “Freaky Friday,” “Knives Out,” her return to “Halloween” and “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” for which she won a supporting actress Academy Award. Her nearly five-decade-long path to Oscar winner has been a part of our cultural identity: She is such a force that she replaced then-all-American hero O.J. Simpson as the person running through airports jumping over things for Hertz.\n\n\tThen, in 2023, she stunned us with her deep, raw, Emmy-winning performance as Donna Berzatto, the alcoholic Italian matriarch of an irrevocably damaged family on “The Bear.” She had never met anyone in the cast when she came to shoot the episode called “Fishes,” where she’s drinking and smoking and terrifying her people while cooking a doomed Christmas dinner.\n\n\t“Jamie came in swinging,” says Christopher Storer, the creator of “The Bear.” “Normally, we’re not the type of show that tries to get famous people — it’s always friends of ours. And Jamie was the only one that was outside of that, because we knew we needed danger — we needed a wild card that the cast wasn’t familiar with. And the first time really anyone met her, she was Donna. Our call time was at 7, and at 7:02 we were shooting in the kitchen, and she was putting butter in her hands, wiping it across baguettes. She’s an animal. She’s a fucking animal.”\n\n\tAnd she’s not slowing down. “Freakier Friday” came out in theaters in August, and “The Lost Bus” was released in September. Her next film, “Ella McCay,” a political comedy-drama written and directed by James L. Brooks and starring Emma Mackey, is coming to theaters on Dec. 12.\n\n\tBut Curtis is not just ferocious on set; interpersonally, she’s also what Storer calls “a tiger.” In 1984, for instance, when she saw a photo of Guest in a magazine, she turned to her friend, the late “Halloween” producer Debra Hill, and said, “I’m going to marry him.” Curtis thought he was “cute.” Hill said, “Oh, yeah, I tried to put him in a movie once — his name is Chris Guest. He’s with your agents.” The next day, Curtis called her agent and asked him to pass her number on. The agent did, but Guest never called.\n\n\tThen, a couple months later, Curtis was having dinner with Melanie Griffith and her and her then-husband Steven Bauer at Hugo’s in West Hollywood, and Guest was there, two tables away, facing Curtis. “He kind of looked at me, and he was like,” she does a shy little wave, “like, ‘Hi. You called me.’ And I made the gesture of —” she does the shy wave back, “Like, ‘I’m the asshole who left my number with our agent.’”\n\n\tFive minutes later, Curtis says, Guest got up to leave. “And he stood at his table,” Curtis says, “10 feet, 15 feet away, and he sort of went,” Curtis shrugs her shoulders, “and I went—” she shrugs again. “And he left. He didn’t come over.”\n\t\n\n\tGuest called Curtis the next day, and five-and-a-half months later they were married. She was 25 years old.\n\n\tBut Curtis’ grounding in philanthropy remains key to her identity. In 1984, while she was shooting “Grandview, U.S.A.” in Pontiac, Illinois, the town put on a benefit for Lori Tull, the first successful teen heart transplant patient. The cast and crew joined the event, and Curtis sold kisses at a fair and befriended Tull. They stayed in touch, including when Tull had her second transplant at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.\n\n\tAround this time, Curtis had a friend who was dying of AIDS at Midway Hospital in L.A. He had a VCR in his room, and when Curtis visited, they’d watch movies. “I remember him saying, ‘Let’s watch “Casablanca,”’” she says. So when Tull died, at 20, Curtis knew how she could honor her: She went to all the studios and asked for their backlog of videotapes. “I put videotape machines in the rooms at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh in Lori’s name, and then had a rotating library of videotapes put in, because I understood the power of distraction.”\n\n\tCurtis went back to Children’s Hospital to fundraise every year after that, and the hospital eventually created a chair in pediatric transplantation in her name.\n\n\n\t“Talk about waking up feeling gratitude and grateful for a life,” Curtis says, her plate of banana bread now only crumbs, her coffee cup empty. “How the fuck did I end up here?” she says, gesturing to the green treetops and flawless blue sky before her. “I was in a one-bedroom stucco apartment on Mary Ellen Avenue, and now I’m all of a sudden here with you.”\n\n\tHave you lived your life wisely? I ask.\n\t\n\n\t“Yeah, for sure. Yeah, for sure,” she says, nodding vigorously. “Oh, my God, for sure!”\n\n\tHave you loved well?\n\n\t“Way well,” she says. “Way well.” She adds, “But I still recognize how difficult life is for most people. I think, ultimately, the root of philanthropy — and the root of humanity — is the relationship between your understanding of the reality and then your reality. How do you reconcile the two? That’s service.”\n\t\n\t\tHair: Sean James/Celestine/Giovanni cosmetics; Makeup: Stephen Sollitto/Tomlinson Management Group\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe cast and creatives of “The Pitt” are teasing Season 2. Star and executive producer Noah Wyle tells me that they’ve completed filming 10 of the season’s 15 episodes.\n\n\t“I’m really proud of the season,” Wyle, who won an Emmy for his portrayal of Dr. Robby, told me Sunday at The Rape Treatment Center and Stuart House annual brunch at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles. “We’ve obviously set a very hard bar for ourselves. We’re competing with our own shadow now.”\n\t\n\n\tOn the pressure to live up to the success of Season 1, Wyle said, “I feel it in the sense that the show became a popular show and then I felt like it became almost a lighthouse show where people were tuning in to have a sense of their humanity reaffirmed and to remember that there are still people out there in these jobs that are selflessly dedicated to picking up our broken pieces.”\n\n\tSeason 2 takes place over July 4th weekend. “Our prosthetics team has been working overtime,” Wyle said. “You’re in for some treats. It’s Fourth of July weekend – Americans hurt themselves in all sorts of ways.”\n\n\tKatherina LaNasa, who won an Emmy for her work as Nurse Dana, said just reading the scripts could prove difficult. “A lot of it is super disgusting, disturbing [and] heartbreaking.”\n\n\tShe continued, “Sometimes they are really sad experiences that you’ve been through in your own life, like with death and things like that that are really painful, and then other ones that are just shockingly grotesque and really difficult even to read about.”\n\n\tWyle also said there are no celebrity guest stars making appearances in Season 2. “We’re not a really stunty show that way, but everybody that comes on is so great,” he said. “Cathy Sandrich won the Emmy for casting this year and rightly so. Everybody she’s brought onto our show has hit the ground running, and you know, it’s no longer a sort of speculative venture. Everybody that comes on knows what they’re coming on to, and they’ve all hit the ground running.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Pitt” will continue telling stories that focus on the U.S. healthcare crisis but won’t veer into politics, said executive producer and director John Wells. “What we’re proudest of is actually being able to dramatize what’s been happening in healthcare and it’s only going to get worse with these Medicare changes, rural hospitals closing and a lot of hospitals under tremendous amounts of pressure,” he said. “In some small way, if we can contribute to educating how much of a crisis we’re in in healthcare…It’s not getting any better. It’s getting worse.\n\n\t“I think you have to stay out of the politics of it and just talk about the human stories because the reality is we tend to think about politics at 10,000 feet. The human stories, what’s actually happening to people, is really right in front of you,” he continued. “It’s very human, very emotional and very specific. As long as we just tell real stories and don’t try and get into the politics — just say what’s happening — we are not really then a target for being accused of one thing or another.”\n\n\tLaNasa smiled when I asked if friends and family now turn to her for medical advice. “People think I’m an expert in compassion,” she said. “I had a friend who had to take his mother to the emergency room, and he called me and he said, ‘I just want Nurse Dana.’”\n\n\tTaylor Dearden, who plays Dr. Mel, said, “I get lots of texts of weird swollen parts and I’m like, ‘I don’t think I need that. I still can’t help you.’”\n\n\tWyle returned to co-hosting the benefit for the UCLA Health-based Rape Treatment Center after first doing so about 25 years ago when he was on “ER” and introduced to the organization by Wells and his wife Marilyn. This time around, he was joined by his “The Pitt” co-star Katherine LaNasa and several of their castmates. \n\n\tThe RTC consulted on an upcoming storyline for Season 2. “They were invaluable in helping us prepare for it,” Wyle said. “It’s the most realistic look at that procedure and that process that I think has been depicted on TV yet and I really hope it honors the work that they do at the Rape Treatment Center.” LaNasa said, “Your legacy is who you are so by showing up for things like this, you’re setting an example of how to be an actress in the world, saying yes to things that matter for people.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPatrick Ball, Shawn Hatosy, Supriya Ganesh, Sepideh Moafi, Katherine LaNasa, Noah Wyle, Shabana Azeez, Taylor Dearden and Gerran Howell at Rape Treatment Center and Stuart House Annual Brunch held at Skirball Cultural Center on October 26, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Araya Doheny/Variety via Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariety via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe afternoon raised $2 million and featured a live auction; one item — the use of Magic Johnson’s Crypto.com Arena suite during a Los Angeles Lakers game — sold twice for a total of $55,000.\n\n\tFor more information about the Rape Treatment Center and Stuart House, go to uclahealth.org.\n\n",

I’ve been looking forward so much to being on stage with my band mates again and playing for all of our amazing fans, and I’m gutted.”\n\t\n\n\tEarlier this year, Setzer revealed that he could not play the guitar due to an autoimmune disorder that affected his hands. “Towards the end of the last Stray Cats tour I noticed that my hands were cramping up,” he wrote on social media. “I’ve since discovered that I have an auto-immune disease. I cannot play guitar. There is no pain, but it feels like I am wearing a pair of gloves when I try to play.”\n\n\n\tThe Stray Cats were scheduled to kick off their fall tour this past weekend, but canceled the opening two dates in Michigan and Illinois. The group was slated to tour the States through the end of November, with planned stops in Las Vegas, Cincinnati and Wheatland, CA, where they were set to conclude the trek on Sept. 23. Refunds are available at the point of purchase.\n\n\tThe rockabilly band, consisting of Setzer, Lee Rocker and Slim Jim Phantom, initially formed in 1979, releasing a string of albums in the 1980s and ’90s. Over the years, the members parted ways and reunited several times, most recently reforming in the late 2010s to release “40,” their first album in 25 years. The Stray Cats toured in 2019 to honor their 40th anniversary, and last year toured during the summer.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale” is heading to Peacock next month, the streamer has announced.\n\n\tThe third and final “Downton Abbey” movie will be available to stream from home on Peacock beginning Nov. 7 after it released in theaters on Sept. 12. Continuing the popular TV series, “The Grand Finale” was a hit at the box office, making $100 million globally, and it was well-received by longtime fans. All six seasons of “Downton Abbey” are also available to watch on Peacock, plus the 2019 self-titled movie and its 2022 sequel “A New Era.”\n\t\n\n\t“Many hardcore ‘Downton’ devotees will know that one of the mainstay themes of the franchise has been preserving Downton’s well-earned honor across the changing times, which have challenged the family and their servants with various ups and downs, with many an impossible-to-please, high-profile guest, and instances of love, death and even war that entered the orbit of the Crawley estate,” wrote film critic Tomris Laffly for Variety. “Through it all, protecting that top-drawer ‘Downton’ integrity — not just of the fictional house, but of the entire franchise — must have been on Fellowes’ mind as a priority too, while he thoughtfully evolved the upstairs and downstairs residents of the majestic estate on their own plausible terms.”\n\n\n\tThe “Grand Finale” cast included Hugh Bonneville, Jim Carter, Michelle Dockery, Paul Giamatti, Elizabeth McGovern, Penelope Wilton and more, and it was directed by Simon Curtis.\n\n\tPeacock also set streaming release dates for the Bob Odenkirk action movie “Nobody 2” (Nov. 2) and the animated movie “The Bad Guys 2” (Nov. 21).\n",

On the other hand, they also oversaw the creation of blockbuster movies, series and music that captivated global audiences, alongside memorable characters, not to mention the women who worked the best deals for clients and their companies.

As the lead on the streamer’s expansion into live sports, Bajaria saw WWE move permanently into the Netflix Global Top 10 list. Its first-ever NFL games netted over 100 million eyeballs, with the Jake Paul v. Mike Tyson fight notching just above.

You can’t get much bigger than that. It’s wildly original and very carefully crafted, but it goes beyond that. “It’s really universal and people just connected to it,” Belson says. “We talk a lot about the power of a story that is so very culturally specific but married to a really powerful universal and relatable theme and story. When you bring that together, it feels like you’ve hit the jackpot because you’ve got it all.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRobbie Brenner\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Brenner\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tPresident, chief content officerMattel Studios\t\n\n\tBrenner was upped to her current post in June, and the Oscar-nominated “Barbie” producer has a full slate on deck, including the anticipated “Masters of the Universe” and “Matchbox.” Top talent continues to be drawn to Mattel Studios, including M. Night Shyamalan and Brad Falchuk (“Magic 8 Ball” TV series), Jon M. Chu (“Hot Wheels”) and Ayo Edebiri (“Barney”). Other pacts include partnerships with TriStar for a “Whac-A-Mole” hybrid feature and Illumination for an animated “Barbie” movie. “We wanted to make movies that felt intentional and authentic and unexpected, and wanted to work with authentic filmmakers,” she says. “There’s just so much great content out there that if you’re going to make content it really needs to stand out and it needs to feel wholly different than everything else.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDonna Caseine\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Becky Yee\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tExec VP, global creative directorReservoir\t\n\n\tCaseine was instrumental in Reservoir’s publishing deal with Snoop Dogg and Death Row Records last year, leveraging existing relationships she’d already forged — a blueprint and build she says “reinforces Reservoir’s focus on people over assets and our reputation as true creative partners.” She also continued to work with a roster of talented creators including Steph Jones, who co-wrote Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso,” and Khris Riddick-Tynes, whose work with SZA and Kehlani earned him recognition. “I love being able to support songwriters at every point of their careers and every stage of the creative process,” Caseine says.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMargie Cohn\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Alex J.

I believe that that showed our strength as a studio, because we don’t have a house style, so projects can come from anywhere. They can look any way.

It’s a talent she discovered through her former work as a sign language translator. “In that role, you have to fully absorb information, understand it and then translate it,” Coogler says. “That practice of deep, active listening shaped how I work today.” Proximity Media, the company Coogler co-founded in 2018 with her husband, Ryan Coogler, and their longtime collaborator Sev Ohanian, has enjoyed one of its biggest years yet with “Sinners,” which earned $367 million at the box office. “There’s a level of candor and trust that comes from long relationships — a raw honesty that isn’t always appropriate or possible,” Coogler says of building a business with partners who feel like family.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAlex Cooper\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tPodcaster, FounderUnwell Network\t\n\n\tThe Hulu docuseries “Call Her Alex” chronicled Cooper’s rise from podcast host to pop culture phenom. Since “Call Her Daddy” launched in 2018, Cooper has leveraged the hit talk show — where she’s interviewed guests ranging from Kamala Harris and Jane Goodall to Gwyneth Paltrow and Kim Kardashian — into Unwell, a multimedia and lifestyle company. In addition to a network of podcasts hosted by rising Gen-Z creators, the Unwell brand has expanded into film and TV development (Cooper is producing projects for Hulu and Netflix), advertising (an in-house creative agency), a beverage brand (Unwell Hydration), and a foundation to increase women’s access to mental healthcare.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAlex DePersia\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tOwnerBy the Way\t\n\n\tWhat drives and inspires DePersia’s vision? “To put it simply: women,” she says. “My goal is always to empower and support the women around me.” That goal has been in full-flex with client Gracie Abrams, who went from an emerging artist to a wildly successful global touring act with career-defining headline shows at Madison Square Garden and other huge venues in the span of four years. “Seeing those pieces fall into place was very powerful for me,” DePersia says of the headlining shows. “It showed how truly solidified [Abrams] has become as a strong touring act, with a stage presence that’s become a real force. Those full-circle moments make me so very proud of what we’ve built together.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGina Balian, Karey Burke, Ayo Davis, Shannon Ryan\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Women of Disney TelevisionGina BalianPresident, FX EntertainmentKarey BurkePresident, 20th Television, Disney Television StudiosAyo DavisPresident, Disney Branded TelevisionShannon RyanPresident, DTC and Disney Entertainment Television Marketing\t\n\n\tBalian has overseen some of the biggest franchises of 2025, including Noah Hawley’s “Alien: Earth.” “There’s so much media out there for consumers to choose from, and one of the benefits is that audiences seem more open to new types of storytelling, worlds and voices,” says Balian. “We are curating a brand that works to find stories that feel relevant but still manage to subvert audience’s expectations in ways that are entertaining, emotional and surprising.” Davis, who oversees original content in her role, looks forward to working with new talent as they enter their careers. “Whether it’s a young actor walking into the room and you know you’re witnessing the start of a future superstar or a writer finding their voice in a story full of heart, those moments of discovery remind me why I love this work,” says Davis. “We’re not just developing shows – we’re shaping the next generation of storytellers.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDiana Dotel\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tFounder, Co-founderMTW Live, MTW Agency\t\n\n\tThe Latin music executive, cultural strategist and entrepreneur helped lead her primarily female-led marketing agency into global terrain in 2025. “Over the last year, we’ve produced events or campaigns across five of the seven continents,” Dotel says, with standout moments including a global Grey Goose campaign with Zoe Saldaña in Lake Como, and a partnership between Karan Aujla and Patrón, which brought shoots and activations to both Jalisco, Mexico, and Mumbai, India. “The opportunity to connect talent and brands around the world continues to grow, and we’re proud to be at the forefront of that evolution,” she says.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDenise Draper\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Draper\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tPartner & co-head of domestic non-scripted TVRange Media Partners\t\n\n\tThree years ago, Draper launched the first domestic unscripted TV arm within a management company with Michael J.

She partnered Jeff Jenkins Prods. with Alex Cooper’s Unwell Prods. and sold their dating series “Love Overboard” to Hulu. As for what’s coming up, a bullish Draper says, “We are going to continue to see a growth in subculture-based content, sports with a focus on the bigger unexpected events, nostalgia, reboots and general franchise revivals, opposed to just one-size-fits-all shows. We will also see formats with new twists to keep that core audience while also building a new one.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tChanning Dungey\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Warner Bros.

Television Group’s divisions have produced more than 80 projects for nearly 20 platforms as of Marchm, including such fan-favorite shows as “Abbott Elementary,” “The Pitt” and “The Penguin.” Dungey celebrated a historic award season when her division scored 60 nominations for the 77th Emmys — the most nods of any studio this year. HBO’s “The Pitt” is one of her proudest achievements this year, as it redefined the TV landscape with its broadcast-style approach of weekly releases, totaling 15 episodes. Going forward, Dungey hopes to see more of the industry continuing to break the mold. “We need to drown out the noise and focus on telling great stories that entertain, inspire, uplift and motivate audiences,” Dungey says. “We need to take more risks and more big swings and not rely so much on IP.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tScout Easley\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Nolan Knight\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tVP, Creative A&RSony Music Publishing\t\n\n\tIn a job that Easley calls pretty much “a dream come true,” the Palm Springs native is championing a next generation of songwriters and artists who are reshaping music in unexpected ways. There has been the clear meteoric ascent of big names like Chappell Roan (“it’s been special to watch her carve out a lane that’s entirely her own”), and the evolution of PinkPantheress, who stepped into production and collaborative roles with other artists (“watching her unlock a new world in 2025 has been a defining moment”). But part of Easley’s magic lies in how committed she is to working with artists at every stage of their career; she signed loads of new talent including Addison Rae, Noeline Hofmann, Malcolm Todd and Sienna Spiro.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHolly Edwards\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Credit Mandatory\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tPresident, Skydance AnimationParamount, a Skydance Corp.\t\n\n\tWith over two decades in animation, Edwards has been the force behind some of the movies we all love, having served in executive roles on big hits like “Kung Fu Panda” and “How to Train Your Dragon.” She brings that big-league know how to Skydance Animation, which is in production with Brad Bird’s “Ray Gunn.” “Although a good idea is always the start, we focus on the person directing and the filmmaking team to build the story and production structure around them to best nurture their ideas,” Edwards says. “Animation takes a lot of time and a lot of people, so when we put the right pieces together, we know we can tell a terrific and memorable story.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGina Eskigian\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Eskigian\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tSpecial counselSheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton\t\n\n\tThe headline-grabbing portion of Eskigian’s job is the succession of deals she’s negotiated for Amazon MGM Studios, including Amy Pascal’s first-look deal (she signed on to produce the studio’s upcoming James Bond film); Stacey Sher’s producing deal for the feature “Verity,” based on Colleen Hoover’s bestseller; and Lizzo and Significant Prods.’ producer deals for “Rosetta,” Amazon MGM Studios’ feature film about gospel singer Sister Rosetta Tharpe. But behind the scenes she’s also very busy mentoring younger members of her legal team, many of whom were conditioned by their pandemic-era work experiences. “If we have to run through an agreement, it’s so different trying to explain to someone over the phone or even over Zoom,” she says.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSheridan Thayer, Kelly Todd, Felice Contreras, April Barrett\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Women of Fifth SeasonSheridan ThayerExec VP, head of TV productionKelly ToddExec VP, head of film productionFelice ContrerasSenior VP, production financeApril BarrettSenior VP, production\t\n\n\tAfter receiving 36 nominations at this year’s Emmys, Fifth Season has emerged as a growing content company specializing in the development, production and financing of projects such as “Severance,” “Slow Horses,” “Nonnas” and “Friendship.” “Fifth Season has a very integrated approach, where creative and physical production work closely from the most nascent stages of development to ensure that we are doing everything in our power to support and prioritize the vision of our filmmakers all the way through delivery of their movie,” says Todd.

She also developed new ways to get songwriters some time in a real spotlight, including the TikTok Songwriter Feature. “As one songwriter put it, these new features allow songwriters to step out from behind the curtain and get the acknowledgment they truly deserve,” says Gardner.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tParris Goebel\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Variety via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tChoreographerLady Gaga’s Mayhem Ball Tour\t\n\n\tGoebel was “born with a passion and love for dance.” That passion led to her collaborate with the duo of Jennifer Lopez and Shakira and Rihanna on their repsective Super Bowl halftime shows in 2020 and 2023. “It doesn’t matter the scale, I give it my all,” she says. Goebel was brought on when Lady Gaga and executive producer/creative director Michael Polansky were conceiving the singer’s Coachella set and subsequent Mayhem Ball Tour. The show featured everything from a caged dress housing mayhem dancers to two queens facing off during “Poker Face,” but Goebel says “Paparazzi’s” rainbow cape, worn when Gaga emerged from a sandbox, representing a grave, was the most challenging element, and also deeply meaningful. “I think being an artist that can survive the test of time, which she is, is such a testimony to her resilience, and how fearless and unapologetic she is,” she says.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTamra Goins\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Goins\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tPartner, department head, worldwide comedyInnovative Artists Entertainment\t\n\n\tGoins, the only Black partner in comedy at any of the agencies, has nearly doubled the department’s size and revenue since she took over in 2017.

Do they have a unique point of view, a strong hustle, discipline and a solid marketing partnership? Are they realistic about expectations?” she says. “In 2026, creative multi-hyphenates will win.

She and co-chair Greenstein moved quickly to make their mark by nabbing “High Side,” a film that reteams “A Complete Unknown’s” Timothée Chalamet and James Mangold.

Although Kang thinks North American audiences tend to see animation as a children’s medium. “Our intention was never to just target children and have it be this kids’ movie.

Kroll and Valenti also are focusing their efforts on next-gen franchises like “The Summer I Turned Pretty.” Thanks to TikTok-friendly campaigns spearheaded by Kroll, the third season of the hit series generated nearly 10 billion social impressions. Enter Valenti, who will oversee a film adaptation of the property based on the Jenny Han books. “This summer was a standout for our YA and women-led programming, where we saw the power of franchise storytelling and fan engagement at scale,” Kroll says of the franchise while also singling out “The Better Sister,” “We Were Liars” and “The Girlfriend” as properties that “tapped into that same emotional connection through innovative social storytelling that resonated and sparked discovery.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDichen Lachman, Britt Lower\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tDichen Lachman, Britt LowerActors‘Severance’\t\n\n\tLower won an Emmy Award for her transfixing work on the Apple TV thriller, playing several layers as she kept audiences guessing if she was Helly or Helena or Helena-pretending-to-be-Helly.

But she still found a way to make her children and grandchildren a priority. “Many times during her mentorship of me, she said, ‘Whatever happens in life is OK as long as you have your family,’” recalls Kathy Wunderli, the firm’s West Coast private wealth group co-chair. “She really, really focused on that.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRamsey Naito\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Beth Coller\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tPresident, Paramount AnimationParamount, a Skydance Corp.\t\n\n\tFollowing Skydance’s acquisition of Paramount Global in August, Naito moved to focus solely on Paramount’s animated movies.

A formidable group of female executives have been busy this year as NBCU restructured operations in preparation for the coming Versant spinoff. Jenkins drives business for the studio group at a moment of massive transformation for the industry. “The programming trend we’re leaning into is about creating shared experiences that unite and spark conversation,” says Jenkins. Katz steers all scripted content for NBC and Peacock, juggling high-wattage franchises and esoteric streaming shows. Notes Katz: “Five years ago, I worked only in broadcast. Now I work across linear and streaming platforms, which are less siloed, allowing for much more collaboration and synergy.” Springborn has a wide remit, producing shows for streaming and cable platforms and hunting for international co-production opportunities. “The industry has gone through warp speed and seismic changes. For me, it’s important to stick to the values that drew me to the business 20 years ago — don’t zig-zag to trends or the whims of the business,” says Springborn. Underhill is a seasoned studio senior manager who oversees a broad slate of dramas and comedies. “Necessity is the mother of invention.

Nogy also handled deals for clients including Adam Scott, Anthony Mackie and Chloe Kim, always looking for “connection” and “authenticity” with a brand. She sees endorsements as a cornerstone of an actor’s career and brand. “Rather than just being a random person, you connect with that actor. It allows a dramatic actor to be funny, or a funny actor to be dramatic, so it allows them to be a little more creative, and to be involved in the creative process, too.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDana Nussbaum\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Cathryn Farnswoth\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tCo-head, global motion picture marketingWarner Bros.

That pact begins in 2026 with the anticipated “Street Fighter.” Parent is also producing Alejandro González Iñárritu’s upcoming film starring Tom Cruise. “I try my best to tune the noise out and just focus on the work and bringing stories to the big screen which make people feel something. The lineup of films coming to theaters in 2026 is incredibly exciting, there are so many I can’t wait to see. So despite everything, I am optimistic,” Parent says. Rich led the groundbreaking marketing campaign for “Minecraft,” turning the film into a worldwide pop phenomenon. “Hitting the nerve of youth culture through meme flooding and creator content.

It also gave audiences a look at the East Coast Black elite through the story of Peggy Scott (Denée Benton). “After the first two seasons, we saw how deeply Peggy’s journey resonated, not just with the Black community, but with our entire audience. The world of the Black elite is a part of history that’s rarely shown on television. In Season 3, we wanted to lean into that even more, giving Peggy’s storyline the richness and historical weight it deserves,” says Richardson-Whitfield. Warfield adds: “I also wanted to confront the issue of colorism within the Black community, as that is not something I have seen film or television depict during that period in history. What was also specific to Newport is that, because it was so small, it was more integrated. … This is historically accurate, but not something we ever see in the 1880s — just 20 years after the Emancipation Proclamation.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMichelle Hooper, Rebecca Kearey, DanTram Nguyen, Katie Goodson-Thomas\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Women of Searchlight PicturesMichelle HooperExec VP, head of marketingRebecca KeareyExec VP, head of international marketing, distribution & business operationsDanTram NguyenExec VP, co-head of productionKatie Goodson-ThomasExec VP, co-head of production\t\n\n\tHooper, Kearey, Nguyen and Goodson-Thomas helped usher Searchlight Pictures to a stellar year at the Oscars.

Searchlight’s adventurous choices and deep filmmaker relationships help the company weather the challenges of the business by “trusting [that] audiences still want films that entertain, challenge and provoke,” the team explains in a joint statement. The production side leans into this philosophy to back productions such as “Is This Thing On?” from Bradley Cooper and Martin McDonagh’s upcoming “Wild Horse Nine.” “We don’t aim to please everyone — we aim to reach the right audience for each film. That clarity allows us to make films at the right scale, give filmmakers creative freedom and therefore deliver a unique theatrical experience that hopefully can spark discourse, laughter and/or tears,” the team added.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLeslie Siebert\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tPresidentGersh Agency\t\n\n\tDespite efforts to elevate female representatives, only one major agency in town is headed solely by a woman: Gersh’s Leslie Siebert. “It is shocking that I’m the only one,” she says. “But if my position helps others get there, that would be most important to me.” After seizing the reins this year, she’s made an indisputable impact. Gersh doubled in size, expanded its global footprint to 16 countries and beefed up its digital, voice and sports divisions. All the while, Siebert has continued to work for a roster that includes two-time Oscar nominee Angela Bassett, Kyle Chandler and “Frankenstein” star Jacob Elordi, now a James Bond frontrunner.

Characters that are written with the full breadth of their humanity is any actor’s dream.” Agrees Steinfeld, “For so long, these types of roles have felt few and far between.” Li concurs, “How lucky am I to play a character who is flawed, real, nuanced and challenges the way Asian women have been portrayed throughout the history of cinema?” And Lawson notes that such representation is more necessary than ever. “In a time where media and government are actively looking to diminish and even erase people’s histories and current lived experiences, it is imperative as an artist to tell our stories loudly, boldly and unapologetically,” she says. “I expect nothing less in 2026.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAn Steegen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Steegen\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tCEOBarco\t\n\n\tAs audiences seek out better cinematic viewing experiences, exhibitors are racing to meet the demand.

Walden made the call to bench Kimmel at a combustible moment for the country, and it was her conversations with the host that led to his return after three nights. “From ‘Alien: Earth’ to ‘High Potential’ to ‘Mickey Mouse Clubhouse+’ and so many others, I’m most proud of the incredible diversity of excellent stories we’re bringing to our subscribers,” she says. “This has been a pivotal year for Disney+ and Hulu, with a pipeline of the highest quality and differentiated films and series driving their growth.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKrista Wegener\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tExec VP, sales & distribution, premium contentSony Music Entertainment\t\n\n\tWegener has played a pivotal role in the global sales of some of Sony Music Entertainment’s most ambitious film and television projects to date.

Peterson stated he was a 2.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Peterson allegedly went on to bomb the field sobriety tests ... and once he was thrown into cuffs for DWI, the docs state a pistol was discovered inside the front passenger side glove box of his car.\n      \n    \n          Peterson was eventually hauled off to jail and booked on one count of DWI and one count of unlawful carrying of a weapon. Cops say they're still awaiting the results of his blood test.\n      \n    \n          Peterson has not yet publicly commented on the arrest.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Adrian Peterson\n              \n                          \n                Arrest\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Football\n              \n                          \n                NFL\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tAR is presenting an extensive selection of microdramas from China and beyond at the ongoing Mipcom market. \n\n\tThe company operates across the $7 billion Chinese and $4 billion international short-form content sectors, with a library of 1,000 titles spanning eight studios and five apps. Its top 100 programs have generated more than 10 billion views worldwide.\n\n\tAt Mipcom, AR is showcasing new and popular series from Liu Yi Media, Playlet and COL, three of the most active studios in the sector.\n\t\n\n\tLiu Yi Media, founded in 2022 by author Mo Jian Shao Ye, produces over 20 original short dramas a month and holds a library exceeding 500 titles. The company reports a hit rate of around 50%. Among the titles presented at Mipcom are “Urban Miracle Doctor,” which follows Qin Yang, a disgraced construction worker whose medical skills and resilience propel him from the margins to power, and “Dragon Mother,” where street cleaner Tang Zhenzhen discovers her mysterious lineage as a warrior queen while battling injustice. Both series reflect Liu Yi Media’s emphasis on audience-driven storytelling through its own platform, Liu Yi Short Drama.\n\n\n\tPlaylet specializes in vertical-screen microdramas across a range of genres. The studio has reported a 400% revenue increase in the APAC region in early 2024 and maintains one of the strongest performance records in the business. Featured at Mipcom are “The Mayor’s XXL Wife: Her Stunning Return,” in which Sophia, a woman once mocked for her size, reclaims her life and love after a stunning transformation, and “The Secret Heiress,” where Lily Wilson, returning from abroad, conceals her wealth and identity to expose those who betrayed her. Playlet’s partnerships with established talent are central to its global expansion strategy.\n\t\n\n\tCOL, a publicly listed company, develops, produces and distributes microdramas through operations in North America, China and Southeast Asia. It has incubated the platforms Reelshort, Sereal+ and Flareflow, and works in content licensing, IP development, co-production and consulting. From its Sereal+ label, COL is presenting “My L.A. Fireman,” which follows a romance born amid the chaos of a California wildfire, and “My Call Boy Billionaire Daddy,” about Ines, a woman wronged by the powerful Ward family, who returns to confront her past and rewrite her destiny. Both projects underscore COL’s aim to merge premium storytelling with scalable international formats.\n\n\tTogether, the companies’ participation at Mipcom highlights the rapid growth of the microdrama business as Chinese studios and platforms position short-form series for global distribution.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCineflix Rights has announced multiple international deals for the BBC One primetime crime thriller “Virdee” at Mipcom.\n\n\tThe series has been bought by Canal+ (Netherlands), SVT (Sweden), Filmin (Spain), Britbox for its platforms across Norway, Finland and Denmark, and BBC Studios for its BBC First and BBC Player platforms across Asia. The latest sales follow deals with SBS (Australia), and Media4Fun (Poland).\n\n\n\t“Virdee,” based on A.A. Dhand’s best-selling novels, follows Harry Virdee, played by Staz Nair (“Rebel Moon”), a Bradford cop hunting down a serial killer. His personal life is in chaos: he has been disowned by his family for crossing a religious divide by marrying Saima, played by Aysha Kala (“Criminal Record”), a woman he loves beyond anyone or anything else.\n\t\n\n\tWhen the murderer kidnaps a local police chief’s son and holds the entire city to ransom, Harry realizes that he is going to need the help of his brother-in-law Riaz (played by Vikash Bhai, who was in “Crossfire” and “Limbo”), a drugs kingpin who runs the largest cartel in the county. Pulled together in an alliance that could ruin them both, Harry must make a choice: save himself and his family or save his city.\n\n\t“Virdee” is adapted for the screen by A.A. Dhand and the directors are Mark Tonderai (“Gotham,” “Doctor Who,” “Foundation”), Milad Ami (“Bullshit,” “When the Dust Settles”) and Mo Ali (“Hijack,” “Cobra”).\n\n\tThe executive producers are Paul Trijbits (“Jane Eyre,” “The Casual Vacancy,” “Saving Mr Banks”) for Magical Society, A.A. Dhand, Jo McClellan for the BBC, and James Durie and Tom Misselbrook for Cineflix Rights. The series is produced by Stella Nwimo (“Nuclear,” “The London Mob”) and Himesh Kar (“Walk With Me,” “The Bengali Detective”).\n\t\n\n\t“Virdee” is a Magical Society production for BBC One and BBC iPlayer in association with Screen Yorkshire. Cineflix Rights is the exclusive worldwide distribution partner.\n\n\tTom Misselbrook, senior VP scripted development at Cineflix Rights, said: “Virdee’s” ‘high-octane storytelling is proving a real hit with viewers, we’re thrilled to see further momentum for the series with these Mipcom sales.”\n\n\tThe deal with Canal+ was brokered by Lucy Rawson, VP, sales, Benelux, CEE, and Southern Mediterranean at Cineflix Rights. The deals with SVT and Britbox were brokered by Sandra Piha, senior VP sales, pan-regional, U.K., Ireland and Scandinavia. The deal with Filmin was brokered by Sabrina Ayala, sales consultant, Iberia, Italy, French-speaking Europe and French Canada; and the deal with the BBC was brokered by Chris Bluett, senior VP, sales, Asia Pacific.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt the China box office over Oct. 10–12, “The Volunteers: Peace at Last” led a subdued frame with RMB34.9 million ($4.8 million), according to consultancy Artisan Gateway. \n\n\tThe film, which commemorates the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army entering the Korean War, stars Wu Jing and Zhang Ziyi and marks the third chapter in Chen Kaige’s “The Volunteers” trilogy. The China Film Group title has reached $73.1 million since its launch. It released during China’s National Day holiday week, collections during which were not as robust in previous years. \n\t\n\n\t“Row to Win” climbed from fifth place to second with $3.7 million, lifting its cume to $37.9 million. The comedy-drama, from PMF Pictures, directed by Ma Lin and starring Huang Bo, Fan Chengcheng, Yin Tao and Li Jiaqi, follows a coastal-town family – led by a once-tough patriarch – who rally together in hard times and push for a comeback. \n\n\n\t“A Writer’s Odyssey 2” stayed third with $3.5 million for a running total of $45.4 million. The sequel to Lu Yang’s 2021 fantasy action hit, from Huace Pictures, continues the meta-narrative of intertwining fiction and reality, with Lei Jiayin reprising his role alongside Dong Zijian and Yang Mi. \n\n\tIn fourth place, Lian Ray Pictures’ “Sound of Silence” earned $3.1 million, taking its total to $28.1 million. Directed by Wan Li, the crime drama stars Tan Jianci as a lawyer from a deaf family who takes on a high-profile fraud case affecting the hearing-impaired community, alongside Lan Xiya, Wang Ge, Wang Yanhui, Chi Peng and Pan Binlong.\n\t\n\n\tChangying Film Group’s “Evil Unbound” rounded out the top five with $2.4 million, bringing its cume to $262.2 million. Directed by Zhao Linshan, the World War II drama is centered on Japan’s Unit 731 biological warfare program. \n\n\tWeekend box office totaled $23 million, while China’s 2025 year-to-date gross reached $6.109 billion, up 18.9% compared to the same period last year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, the two-time Oscar-winning filmmaker, has come aboard as executive producer on Afia Nathaniel’s short film “Don’t Be Late, Myra,” boosting the project’s profile as it campaigns for the 98th Academy Awards.\n\n\tThe short, which secured Oscar qualification after a strong festival circuit run, reunites Nathaniel with Pakistani storytelling a decade after her feature debut “Dukhtar” premiered at Toronto in 2014.\n\n\n\tNathaniel’s latest work centers on young Myra (Innayah Umer), a 10-year-old navigating Lahore’s streets alone after missing her ride to school. The film tracks her increasingly dangerous walk home, capturing the threats children face in public spaces. Drawing from her own experiences as a survivor, Nathaniel tackles the often-unspoken issue of child harassment head-on.\n\t\n\n\t“Myra’s story is both urgent and real,” Obaid-Chinoy said. “‘Don’t Be Late, Myra’ gives voice to the fears every young girl knows too well, while celebrating the courage it takes to survive and to be heard. To stand behind this film is not only a responsibility, but a joy. I am proud to join as executive producer and to help bring this vital story to the world.”\n\n\tThe filmmaker’s backing carries considerable weight. Beyond her two Academy Awards and two Emmys, Obaid-Chinoy directed Marvel Studios’ “Ms. Marvel.”\n\n\tThe short claimed top honors at Bergen International Film Festival of NJ and Montreal International Film Festival. \n\n\tAdditional executive producers include Rohi Mirza Pandya through Box Office Guru Media and RASA Film Group, along with René Bastian (“Transamerica”) and Shrihari Sathe (“Stay Awake”) from Dialectic.\n\t\n\n\tFor Nathaniel, a Pakistani-American director, the project continues her track record of purpose-driven work. “Dukhtar” represented Pakistan at the Oscars and screened in more than 20 countries. She later broke barriers at NBC Universal, becoming the first Pakistani-American woman to helm a U.S. network drama when she directed “Chicago Med” through the Launch Female Forward initiative.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA feature film chronicling the life of Bertrand Russell is moving forward, marking the first theatrical biopic about the British philosopher who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950 for his varied and significant writings championing humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought.\n\n\tRussell’s remarkable life and career — spanning nearly a century from 1872 to 1970 — established him as a pioneering figure in analytic philosophy and one of the 20th century’s foremost logicians. Beyond his groundbreaking work in mathematics, logic and philosophy, he became a tireless advocate for peace and social justice.\n\t\n\n\tThe philosopher has previously been explored on television, most notably in Will Pascoe’s 2008 documentary “The Three Passions of Bertrand Russell,” which featured contributions from Noam Chomsky and Vivienne Westwood. However, this marks Russell’s first narrative feature treatment. Apart from several TV shows, Russell appeared in the 1967 Indian film “Aman” (Peace) as himself. \n\n\n\tDanish-Chinese filmmaker and scholar Amanda Renai Curdt-Christiansen is penning the screenplay as part of her practice-based PhD research at the U.K.’s De Montfort University. The project has secured backing from the U.K.’s Arts and Humanities Research Council and is being developed alongside the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation.\n\n\t“Our appetite for true, meaningful, and inspiring stories is growing globally, no doubt exacerbated by the current political climate,” said Curdt-Christiansen. “Russell’s message is important, and his story has the potential to resonate with audiences from London to Beijing.”\n\t\n\n\tThe filmmakers view Russell’s commitment to pacifism, opposition to imperialism, and humanitarian principles as particularly resonant today. His nearly century-long life witnessed world wars, social upheaval and political transformation across multiple continents — providing rich dramatic territory for a film with international appeal.\n\n\tCurrently in development, the project will incorporate materials from the Peace Foundation’s archives alongside expert consultations and research into Chinese market dynamics and audience preferences. This cross-cultural approach reflects the team’s ambition to foster East Asian co-production opportunities.\n\n\tCurdt-Christiansen’s multicultural background positions her uniquely for the endeavor. She speaks English, Mandarin, French and Danish, and has built her career across continents, having lived and worked in Singapore, Canada, France, China, Denmark and the U.K.. Her credits span film curation (Cinemateket, Copenhagen Short Film Festival), educational programming (CPH:DOX, National Film School of Denmark), and production work with companies including SAM Productions and Beo Post. She has also directed independent short films with support from Danish Film Directors, Danish Actors’ Association and Filmværkstedet Copenhagen.\n\n\tHiu Man Chan, who supervises the project at De Montfort University and U.K.-China Film Collab, said, “The funding model for this film project development is unique and one of its kind. I hope this alternative collaboration can shed light on new imagination for independent filmmakers.”\n\n\tTony Simpson, managing director of the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation, added: “Bertrand Russell revered people’s creative impulses. This project will act as a bridge between our extensive archives, our independent scholarship, and the creative industries.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTalpa Studios’ global hit quiz show “The Floor” has reached a major milestone: its 30th international commission.\n\n\tThe latest deals include a new adaptation in the Middle East and North Africa region, airing on MBC — spanning 23 territories and reaching over 150 million weekly viewers — and a landmark first entry into Asia, where Nippon TV will bring the show to Japan.\n\n\tThese additions follow recent commissions in Eastern Europe and strong launches across key markets such as the U.S., Australia and France.\n\t\n\n\tJohn de Mol, founder of Talpa Studios, said: “Reaching our 30th commission is a milestone we’re incredibly proud of. With the MENA region now on board and our very first sale in Japan, it shows the format’s universal strength. In all my years in this industry, it’s the first time one of my formats will air in Japan, which makes this an extra special moment.”\n\n\n\tMegumi Hisamichi, senior manager, programming and platform strategy, Nippon TV, said: “ ‘The Floor’ features a dynamic stage and fast-paced gameplay, capturing global attention as an innovative, audience-participating quiz show. I was tremendously inspired by this format and immediately proposed a Japanese adaptation produced by Nippon TV. We will preserve its original appeal while using our extensive production experience to further enhance it for the Japanese audience.”\n\n\tSamar Akrouk, group director of production at MBC Group and MBC Studios, added: “This is yet another example of MBC’s leadership and commitment to bringing world-class formats to the Arab world. ‘The Floor’ joins our long line of successful international formats that we have produced and adapted for our audiences.”\n\t\n\n\tAkrouk continued: “Our viewers have always had a strong appetite for game shows, and ‘The Floor’ brings a fresh and dynamic twist to the genre – one we are confident they will love.”\n\n\tIn “The Floor,” 100 quiz fanatics face off in quiz duels on a giant LED floor divided into one hundred equal squares, each representing its own field of knowledge. The goal is to conquer the entire floor and take home a huge cash prize. The rules are simple. A random contestant challenges an adjoining opponent in a quiz duel. They play against each other in the category of the opponent’s square. Categories range from “famous athletes” to “Hollywood actors” and from “iconic buildings” to “mammals.” Some questions are visually supported by photographs, others by sound, while other duels focus on open questions, multiple choice and association. The winner of a duel conquers his opponent’s square, gaining more ground – the loser leaves the game.\n\n\tMore than 15 local versions have already been produced from Talpa Studios’ production hub in the Netherlands, with additional hubs in the Baltics and Argentina. “This set-up has become a cornerstone of Talpa Studios’ roll-out strategy: scalable, efficient, studio-based entertainment shows, powered by on-site expertise and adaptable for partners worldwide,” the company said.\n\n\tSebastian van Barneveld, director of global distribution at Talpa Studios, said: “The success of ‘The Floor’ shows the strength of the format itself. What our hub model adds is the ability to move faster and work more collaboratively with partners. And it goes beyond ‘The Floor.’ We’re already applying it with formats like ‘The Quiz With Balls.’ By producing multiple local versions on a single set, we maximize efficiency and enable partners worldwide to scale studio-based entertainment shows with us.”\n",

The film adapts the “Reze” arc of Tatsuki Fujimoto’s hit manga. Directed by Tatsuya Yoshihara with a screenplay by Hiroshi Seko, the movie follows Denji as his encounter with café worker Reze leads to a clash between intimate connection and bloody chaos. Voice cast includes Reina Ueda, Fairouz Ai, Tomori Kusunoki, and Maaya Uchida.\n\t\n\n\tSouth Korean film “Boss” placed a close second with $2 million (307,168 admissions) for a 23.8% share across 1,194 screens, lifting its cumulative total to $13.8 million after ten days in theaters. Directed by Ra Hee-chan, the action-comedy stars Jo Woo-jin as Soon-tae, Jung Kyung-ho as Kang-pyo, Park Ji-hwan as Pan-ho and Lee Kyu-hyung as Tae-gyu. The film, which debuted at the Busan International Film Festival, centers on gang underlings who, oddly, compete to avoid becoming the boss while pursuing personal ambitions.\n\n\n\tPark Chan-wook‘s “No Other Choice” held firm in third, adding $1.28 million (186,043 admissions) to reach $18.1 million to date. Lee Byung-hun plays Man-su, a laid-off paper manufacturing specialist who resorts to serial murder to eliminate his competitors for a single job opening, only to discover the position exists to supervise AI testing.\n\n\t“One Battle After Another” ranked fourth with $594,024 (83,729 admissions), while Japanese juggernaut “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle,” currently the No. 1 film in the world, was fifth at $501,695 (71,033 admissions), pushing its local total to $40.9 million. New opener “Tron: Ares” landed in sixth with $425,560 from 52,618 admissions on 725 screens.\n\t\n\n\t“Bread Barbershop: The Bakerytown Baddies” earned $207,478 (cume $1.5 million) and “Your Letter” took $209,688 (cume $1.2 million) in seventh and eighth positions. “Gabby’s Dollhouse: The Movie” grossed $119,956 in ninth (cume $664,628). Rounding out the top 10, local animation sports drama “Badass Girl” opened with $97,183 from 14,910 admissions.\n\n\tThe top 10 films collectively grossed $7.9 million over the Oct. 10–12 weekend, down from $13.6 million the previous frame. \n",

    "body": "\n\tCANNES, France — wedotv, the global free ad-supported streaming network, is partnering with Germany’s ZDF Studios, to create and distribute a FAST channel dedicated to just one title: landmark South African drama series “Legacy.”\n\n\tZDF Studios already represents the series globally outside , bringing it to market at 2023’s Mipcom.  \n\n\tAs many companies turn to YouTube to build IP, then approach streaming services with masses of data on the result, the single IP channel – wedotv: Legacy — now created and distributed by wedotv – shows companies approaching IP the other way round. First released in 2020 on South Africa’s M-Net, a division of MultiChoice, and now a Canal Plus company, the thriller about how a family tears itself apart in a succession battle built a huge fandom in South Africa and fame abroad. It is now leveraging digital to open up new audiences. \n\t\n\n\tM-Net’s first telenovela, “Legacy” also underscores a new pathway to success – think Spain’s “The Vow” and “Sueños de Libertad” – by bringing premium production values to a novela narrative which, despite this, doesn’t hide telenovelas’ melodrama heart.\n\n\n\tThis comes with the series creators and its fictional world. “Legacy” was produced by South African powerhouse Tshedza Pictures, behind the International Emmy-nominated telenovela “The River” whose co-founders, Gwydon Beynon and Phathu Makwarela, created the series. \n\n\tIt is set in a world of dazzling opulence, caught by the mansion of the Price family, whose patriarch, Sebastian Price has built up Legacy Investments into a billionaire behemoth. The family mansion is a huge white marble affair replete with a pool and rose garden. The women wear stunning fashion numbers, Sebastian’s wife Dineo Price slinking down a staircase in a cleavage revealing skimpy number in its opening minutes. \n\t\n\n\tSebastian chooses and then rejects at least two successors in Ep. 1’s first 15 minutes, prompting his own murder, and a succession war as his bitter ex-wife and their unprincipled daughter Felicity will do anything to stop Dineo from shaping their playboy son into his successor. Legacy swept best telenovela and multiple other plaudits at South Africa’s 2021 SAFTA awards.\n\n\tAmong a large South African star-studded and notably diverse cast, the series toplines Dawid Minnaar (“Poppie Nongena”), Sean-Marco Vorster (“Warrior”) and the late Michelle Botes (“Isidingo”) who won SAFTA Golden Horns for actress and supporting actress for her performance.\n\n\tThe smash-hit, Award-winning series “Legacy” (104×45’) transports viewers into the high-stakes world of investment billionaires — where wealth is limitless, rivalries run deep, and family loyalty comes at a deadly price. Behind the glittering façade of the Price dynasty lies a battlefield of power, passion, and betrayal. As long-buried secrets explode and nothing and no one is safe, wedotv and ZDF Studios announced Monday at Mipcom.\n\n\t“When ZDF Studios came to us with the idea of a channel dedicated to ‘Legacy,’ we wanted to make sure the key elements of a successful single IP channel were in place: quality, quantity, story, and proven audience ratings generator,” noted Philipp Rotermund, CEO of wedotv. “Legacy” has all of those key qualities in spades. It’s also incredibly compelling and binge-worthy, which helps keep viewers engaged within the platform ecosystem, which is essential for advertisers.” \n\n\t“There is a real upside to creating and launching a channel like wedotv: ‘Legacy’ — It has a built-in fan base,” said Florian Streit, Director, Drama, ZDF Studios. “Single IP channels work well because they are immediately identifiable to fans. ‘Legacy’ is also a long-running series that maintains an exceptional level of quality across all episodes.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tStanley Tucci is set to star alongside Simona Tabasco (“The White Lotus“) and Victor Belmondo (“Bardot”), in “Masterplan,” an international heist movie directed by Thomas Vincent (“Reacher”). The English-language production marks Prime Video’s first French-Italian Original film.\n\n\tFilming begins today on “Masterplan” across locations in France and Italy. Gaumont, the revered French studio behind “Lupin,” is fittingly producing “Masterplan” with Amazon MGM Studios. \n\t\n\n\tTucci, who’s just wrapped filming “The Devil Wears Prada 2,” stars in “Masterplan” as a legendary thief who sets his sights on the Mona Lisa, Leonardo da Vinci’s iconic painting residing at Le Louvre museum in Paris. He recruits two young strangers to help him — Chiara, a sharp Italian cybercrime expert (played Tabasco who broke out in “The White Lotus” season 2) and Jay, a swaggering French explosives specialist (played by Belmondo) — before revealing they are long-lost siblings and that he is their father. “Thrown into a chaotic reunion they never asked for, this new family must learn to work together — and try not to kill each other — if they want any chance at pulling off the heist of the century,” reads the synopsis. \n\n\n\tVincent, whose track record includes the hit series “Bodyguard” and “Reacher,” penned “Masterplan” with David Wolstencroft, the BAFTA-winning screenwriter of “Spooks” and “The Escape Artist.” The story is by Giacomo Durzi, Alessandro Fabbri, Alberto Vignati, David Wolstencroft and Vincent.  The movie will be available exclusively on Prime Video in over 240 countries. \n\t\n\n\tIn an interview with Variety ahead of Mipcom, Nicole Morganti, head of local originals for Amazon MGM Studios in Southern Europe, and Thomas Dubois, head of local originals for Amazon MGM Studios in France, said “Masterplan” underscores their joint ambition to create content from Southern Europe that achieves a global scale.\n\n\t“Masterplan” taps into the appeal around the increasingly popular heist genre, and feeds into the appetite for escapist fare with its glamorous backdrop; but there’s also a subplot revolving around family, which Dubois says “can transcend borders.”\n\n\t“The movie is full of twists and turns, but Thomas Vincent also wanted to made a film about family and it gives it some depth,” says Dubois. Morganti, meanwhile, is upbeat about Tabasco playing “a kick ass woman who is incredibly smart.”\n\n\tSpeaking of Tucci, Dubois says his name came early in the conversation for the protagonist’s role because they “needed someone with a lot of nuances.”\n\n\t“When we started to discuss casting with Thomas Vincent, Stanley Tucci was one of the first names that we all aligned on because we were like, ‘He is so special.’ And luckily, he said yes very, very quickly, after reading the script,” Dubois adds. \n\n\tAlthough he’s an American actor, Tucci is also “one of the best experts of Italy and France,” like the thief he plays in “Mastermind,” Morganti says, noting that he partly shot “Citadel” in Italy.\n\n\tMorganti says “Masterplan” builds on the long-standing co-production tradition between France and Italy, as well as the flourishing talent pool in this part of Europe. \n\n\t“Both Thomas and I are convinced that Southern Europe has the potential to become an incubator for more global content and this project gives us the possibility to show how French and Italian producers and creators can actually produce ambitious English-language content for the world, ” Morganti argues.\n\n\tThomas, meanwhile, said, “In France and Italy, we have savoir-faire in film and television production and in joining our creative powers, we know that we’re able to access a certain level of production and of ambition,” says Dubois. On an industrial standpoint, the co-production also allows Prime Video to “rationalize the cost of a very ambitious project,” he continues. \n\t\n\n\tWhereas international co-productions handled by several broadcasters can sometimes lead to so-called “Euro pudding,” Dubois says he and Morganti have made sure the project would feel “organic and authentic,” firstly by “having France and Italy be characters in the story.” \n\n\tAs such, the international flavor of “Masterplan” partly comes from its wealth of locations, Dubois says, citing Rome and Paris, as well as the Louvre museum. The involvement of Gaumont, which has a solid footprint in France and Italy, was another key component that ensured the film would feel authentic, Dubois said. \n\n\tPrime Video in France has actually been working with Gaumont on a number of titles, such as the recent action movie “Carjarkers” and the heartfelt drama “Once Upon My Mother” with Leila Bekhti and Jonathan Cohen. In Italy, Prime Video has just collaborated with Gaumont in a Christmas movie that will be coming out in November, Morganti says. \n\n\tMorganti says there will be more co-productions going forward as “locals producers got excited when hearing of the first French-Italian Original film at Prime Video.”  \n\n\tThe streamer has been successfully making headway into the English-language space in Italy with “Hotel Costiera” which stars “Grey’s Anatomy” alumnus Jesse Williams as a half-Italian former U.S. Marine. The show, which unfolds at a luxurious hotel on the coastline of Positano, just hit No. 1 on Amazon Prime Video in the U.S. over weekend. \n\n\t“‘Hotel Costiera,” Morganti says, “shows the level of ambition we have in creating English content from Southern Europe that resonates globally with a flavor that is different from what is being made in the U.S.” Another hot English-language show on Morganti’s pipeline at Prime Video is “Postcards From Italy,” a series which is currently filming with “Culpa Mia” star Nicole Wallace and director Jessica Yu, whose credits include “Only Murders in the Building” and “The Morning Show.” \n",

Dudgeon stars alongside Nick Hendrix as his trusted sidekick Detective Sergeant Winter, the series also sees the return of Annette Badland as pathologist Dr. Fleur Perkins and Fiona Dolman as Barnaby’s wife Sarah.\n\n\n\t“Midsomer Murders” remains a solid hit in a number of territories, including Germany, Scandinavia and the Baltics, and is still active in nearly 200 territories, from France to Australia and the U.S.\n\n\tAll3Media Intl. Strikes Deal in Kazakhstan\n\n\tLeading Kazakhstan streaming platform Freedom Media has acquired 110 hours of premium scripted content from U.K. distributor All3Media Intl.\n\n\tFreedom Media nabbed multiple seasons of such high-profile shows as the  Travis Fimmel-led mystery drama “Black Snow,” from Australia’s Goalpost Pictures; from Two Brothers Pictures, “The Tourist,” starring Jamie Dornan, and The Forge’s four-part political thriller “Roadkill,” starring Hugh Laurie as a charismatic politician whose life seems to be falling apart.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The English”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: Diego Lopez Calvin\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFreedom Media’s acquired slate also includes “The English,” starring Emily Blunt and Chaske Spencer; psychological thriller “Angela Black,” featuring Joanne Froggatt; darkly comic thriller “Boat Story”; and “Captivated,” with Kara Tointon and Allen Leech, about a young mother who finds herself pulled into the orbit of a shady businessman.\n\n\tAlso in the package is Snowed-In Productions’ three-part drama “Too Close,” starring Emily Watson and Denise Gough; from Objective Fiction and Tannadice Pictures, heist series “The Gold,” starring Hugh Bonneville, Charlotte Spencer, Tom Cullen and Emun Elliott.\n\n\tFurther true crime series include Hera Pictures’ “I Fought the Law,” with Sheridan Smith as a mother fighting to change the law and find justice following her daughter’s murder; South Pacific Pictures’ “Far North,” about an international crime that lands on the shores of a small New Zealand community; New Pictures’ crime drama “The Long Shadow”; and Snowed-In Prods.’ historical drama “Mrs Wilson,” with Ruth Wilson starring as her real-life grandmother, a widow who uncovers a mysterious and secret life following the death of her husband.\n\n\tMinika Embraces Spanish Toons\n\n\tSpanish animation studio Ánima Kitchent has renewed its long-standing partnership with leading Turkish kids’ channel Minika for the hit preschool series “Cleo & Cuquín.”\n\n\tThe deal, extended for an additional four-year term, affirms the continued success of the show in Turkey: Minika originally licensed Seasons 1 and 2 of “Cleo & Cuquín” in 2021.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Cuquín: Discover & Explore”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Ánima Kitchent\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs part of the new agreement, Minika will retain the rights to the first two seasons and also acquire 30 episodes of the spin-off series “Cuquín: Discover & Explore.” Initially released as digital-first content, the new episodes will be debuting on Turkish television and VOD platforms, significantly expanding the brand’s presence in the region.\n\n\t“This extended partnership not only highlights the strong connection the show has built with audiences in Turkey but also opens a new chapter with the introduction of ‘Cuquín: Discover & Explore’ to TV and VOD for the very first time,” said Miguel Aldasoro, Ánima Kitchent’s international sales and co-production director.\n\t\n\n\tMinika chief content editor Elçin Koyuncu added that Minika was “dedicated to curating content that truly connects with audiences, and ‘Cleo and Cuquín’ is a shining example of that vision.”\n\n\tNew Game Show “The Auction” Headed to Italy\n\n\tDori Media and Abot Hameiri’s new game show “The Auction,” which debuted on América Televisión in Peru earlier this summer, is headed to Italy.\n\n\tItaly’s Blu Yazmine has acquired rights to “The Auction” and is currently developing an Italian version of the format. \n\n\tDori Media and Abot Hameiri, in collaboration with América Televisión, produced the first season of “The Auction” (known locally as “La Subasta”), which became the #1 show in its prime-time slot in Peru on América Televisión during the summer and into the fall.\n\n\t“The Auction” is a game show that pits two families in a competition for mysterious boxes in which they rely on bizarre AI-generated clues. Each team uses an equal budget to try and acquire prizes with the highest real-world value, while the audience at home also takes part, guessing the identity of hidden prizes in real time, turning the entire show into an interactive social guessing game.\n\n\tIn addition, Dori Media has licensed unscripted format “Intuition” to Portugal’s TVI, where the show will make its European debut in December. TVI has ordered 20 episodes of the game show, which was created by Dori Media and Oded Menashe, maker of the hit series “Smart Face.”\n\n\tDori Media has also signed leading Argentine production companies Kuarzo Entertainment Group and StoryLab to represent their scripted programming catalogues globally. Dori Media has already begun representing both Kuarzo and StoryLab as the companies head to Mipcom.\n\n\tSipur Studios, Untied Heroes Cook Up Israeli-Ukrainian Culinary Competition Format “SupermarketChef”\n\n\tIsrael’s Sipur Studios and Ukraine’s United Heroes will unveil the first season of their new cooking competition format “SupermarketChef” at Mipcom.\n\n\tThe fast-paced “SupermarketChef” celebrates delicious and simple meals prepared by the best home cooks from diverse cultures.

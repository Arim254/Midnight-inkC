    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tFrom affairs to betrayals to a whole lot of drama, it’s been a tumultuous third season of  “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” to say the least. If you, too, are wondering where things stand between the women of MomTok following the explosive finale, you’re in luck: the Season 3 reunion will be available to stream exclusively on Hulu on Thursday, Dec. 4 starting at 9 p.m. PT.\n\n\tStassi Schroeder of “Vanderpump Rules” fame will host the event, which will reunite #MomTok and #DadTok “to explore the shocking scandals, uncover never-before-seen footage, and deck the halls with controversial guests,” per the official logline. Schroeder replaces Season 2 reunion host and “The Bachelor” alum Nick Viall. \n\n\n\tCast members Taylor Frankie Paul, Whitney Leavitt, Jen Affleck, Layla Taylor, Jessi Ngatikaura, Demi Engemann, Mikayla Matthews, Mayci Neeley and Miranda McWhoster, who joined the show in Season 2, will be in attendance. Wondering how to tune in? Here’s everything you need to know about streaming the special. \n\n\tSince “Mormon Wives” is currently exclusive to Hulu, you won’t be able to catch the reunion on cable. Instead, you’ll need access to a Hulu account. A standalone subscription to the streaming service (with ads) starts at $11.99, while a Hulu Premium subscription, which grants viewers a commercial free experience, starts at $18.99. Users can also purchase Hulu as part of a bundle plan with Disney+, ESPN or HBO Max, starting at $12.99.  Once you’re subscribed, you’ll be able to stream the reunion on demand.\n\n\tSince premiering in 2024 following the group’s viral swinging scandal, “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” has quickly become a fan favorite. While Season 3 data is yet to become available, the Season 2 premiere of the series hit five million views in its first five days of streaming on Hulu, according to Disney, while Season 1 was the streamer’s most watched unscripted series premiere of 2024.\n\n\n\tToday, the women of MomTok are busier than ever. Affleck and Leavitt just competed on Season 34 of “Dancing with the Stars,” while Paul is set to star as “The Bachelorette,” premiering March 22, 2026. Additionally, Leavitt recently announced that she’ll be stepping into the role of Roxie Hart in “Chicago,” making her Broadway debut in Feb. 2026.   \n\n\tThe reunion is expected to have “more drama than a high school Christmas pageant,” Schroeder said in the trailer. The eternal question remains: will MomTok survive this?\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrime Video has set Dec. 19 as the global premiere date for the final season of its International Emmy-nominated original series “Four More Shots Please!“\n\n\tThe Indian series, which has become one of the streamer’s most-watched originals, will close out its run with a fourth and final season launching just ahead of the holidays. The finale brings back the core quartet of Sayani Gupta, Kirti Kulhari, Bani J and Maanvi Gagroo, who return alongside Prateik Smita Patil, Milind Soman, Rajeev Siddhartha, Lisa Ray and Ankur Rathee reprising their roles.

    "body": "\n\tCary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, who played evil sorcerer Shang Tsung in the “Mortal Kombat” franchise and appeared in “The Last Emperor,” “Licence to Kill” and “The Man in the High Castle,” died Thursday in Santa Barbara. A rep confirmed he died of complications from a stroke. He was 75.\n\n\tTagawa’s first film role came in Bernardo Bertolucci’s “The Last Emperor.” Soon after that, Tagawa played the villian Kwang in James Bond movie “Licence to Kill.”\n\t\n\n\tOn TV, he had a recurring role on “Nash Bridges” and guest spots on dozens of series including “Miami Vice,” “Knots Landing,” “Moonlighting” and “Baywatch.”\n\n\n\tKagawa is known for his role as Shang Tsung in the “Mortal Kombat” franchise. He appeared in the first film adaptation in 1995 and went on to appear in the TV series “Mortal Kombat: Legacy” in 2013 and lent his voice to the more recent “Mortal Kombat 11” videogame.\n\n\tHis manager, Margie Weiner, said, “I had the privilege of representing Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa for many years as his long time manager, but our relationship grew into something far deeper — he became like family. Cary was a rare soul: generous, thoughtful, and endlessly committed to his craft. His loss is immeasurable. My heart is with his family, friends, and all who loved him.”\n\n\tHis other film roles include “Rising Sun,” “Snow Falling on Cedars,” “Pearl Harbor,” “Planet of the Apes” and “Memoirs of a Geisha.”\n\n\tIn Amazon’s TV series “The Man in the High Castle,” Tagawa starred as Trade Minister Nobusuke Tagomi; in Netflix’s “Lost in Space,” he played Hiroki Watanabe.\n\n\tThough he often played villains, Tagawa told the Honolulu Advertiser in 2007 that the type-casting was inevitable at the time. “Guaranteed, I wouldn’t have gotten to play good guys if I hadn’t played those bad guys,” Tagawa said.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s something you take pride in, being not only the best Asian bad guy you can be, but the best of all bad guys. I wasn’t willing to do anything to get in, but I think I developed the ability to take what I was given and do the best job I could,” he said.\n\n\tBorn in Tokyo to an actress mother and Japanese American father who served in the military, Tagawa attended high school near Los Angeles, where he first started acting, and then attended USC. He began teaching his own style of martial arts called Chu Shin.\n\n\tHe is survived by his children Calen, Byrnne and Cana, and two grandchildren, River and Thea Clayton.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJeremy O. Harris, whose boundary-pushing “Slave Play” earned a record number of Tony nominations, has been detained in Japan for nearly three weeks following his arrest on drug smuggling charges at an Okinawa airport.\n\n\tThe multihyphenate writer-actor, whose work spans Broadway, HBO’s “Euphoria” and the critically lauded feature “Zola,” was stopped by customs officials Nov. 16 at Naha Airport after they allegedly found less than a gram of MDMA in his bag, according to Reuters. Harris, 36, has remained in custody since his arrest under Japan’s strict narcotics laws.\n\t\n\n\tLocal prosecutors received a criminal complaint Thursday from Okinawa customs officials, moving the case toward formal charges. Authorities have not disclosed whether Harris has addressed the allegations. Variety has reached out to Harris’ representatives for comment. It remains unclear whether he has secured legal representation in Japan.\n\n\n\tThe Yale School of Drama graduate had traveled to the resort island from the U.K. with a layover in Taiwan, reportedly for tourism. Okinawa, known for its beaches and located about 930 miles southwest of Tokyo, is a popular vacation destination.\n\n\tHarris emerged as one of theater’s most provocative voices with “Slave Play,” which interrogated race, sex and power dynamics en route to becoming the most Tony-nominated play in Broadway history. Beyond theater, he’s built a robust screen career, co-writing A24’s “Zola” with director Janicza Bravo and contributing to Olivier Assayas’ “Irma Vep” for HBO. He’s also attached to adapt Brit Bennett’s novel “The Vanishing Half.”\n\t\n\n\tJapan maintains some of the developed world’s strictest drug enforcement policies, prosecuting even small-scale possession cases. The country’s penalties, while severe, stop short of the death sentences imposed in other Asian nations including China and Singapore.\n\n\tOther entertainment figures have faced similar troubles in Japan: Grammy-winning DJ David Morales was arrested in 2018 at Fukuoka airport over alleged MDMA possession, while Paul McCartney’s 1980 marijuana arrest in Tokyo resulted in a lengthy entry ban.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFilmmaker Matt Reeves added his voice to the wave of praise for Paul Dano — an outpouring that was prompted by Quentin Tarantino dissing Dano as “the weakest fucking actor in SAG.”\n\n\t“Paul Dano is an incredible actor, and an incredible person,” Reeves wrote on social media Thursday afternoon. The director worked with Dano on “The Batman,” in which the actor took on the role of the villainous Riddler and faced off against Robert Pattinson’s Caped Crusader.\n\t\n\n\tTarantino made his comments about Dano in an appearance on The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast, in which the filmmaker named his 20 favorite movies of the 21st century. But Tarantino upstaged his own taste a bit when discussing his fifth-place selection, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “There Will Be Blood,” arguing that the film would be his first or second pick “if it didn’t have a big, giant flaw in it… and the flaw is Paul Dano.”\n\n\n\t“He is weak sauce, man. He is the weak sister,” Tarantino continued. “He’s just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy. Daniel Day-Lewis shows that he doesn’t need a strong foil. The movie needs it. He doesn’t need anything. It’s supposed to be a two-hander and it’s not! … You put him with the the weakest fucking actor in SAG? The limpest dick in the world?”\n\n\tThe harsh take prompted others in the industry to voice their appreciation for Dano, including Reeves’ “The Batman” sequel screenwriter Mattson Tomlin: “I am really pleased to see so many people cheer on Paul Dano this week. Not only is he a terrific actor, but he’s an astonishing director who exudes control and tremendous empathy. Check out ‘Wildlife’ if you haven’t seen it.”\n\t\n\n\tBen Stiller also showed his appreciation, writing on social media that “Paul Dano is f-ing brilliant.” Alec Baldwin shared a video statement saying, “I love Paul Dano. And if you don’t love Paul Dano, shhhhhh.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe trailer for “Sholay: The Final Cut” has been unveiled, previewing the Dec. 12, 2025 worldwide theatrical release of India’s most celebrated blockbuster in its 50th anniversary year.\n\n\tFor the first time, audiences will experience the original uncut version of Ramesh Sippy’s 1975 epic, restored in 4K with Dolby 5.1 sound. The trailer employs the tagline “The Greatest Story Never Told,” a play on the film’s reputation as Indian cinema’s greatest achievement, since general audiences have never seen this complete, uncut version.\n\t\n\n\tThe story follows former police officer Thakur Baldev Singh, who enlists two small-time rogues — the charismatic Veeru and introspective Jai — to capture the notorious dacoit Gabbar Singh, who terrorizes the village of Ramgarh. \n\n\n\tThe preview showcases the iconic partnership of Jai and Veeru, played by Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra, alongside Sanjeev Kumar’s emotional gravitas as Thakur, Hema Malini’s charming Basanti, Jaya Bachchan’s quietly powerful Radha, and Amjad Khan’s unforgettable villain Gabbar Singh. The trailer’s release takes on added poignancy following the recent deaths of cast members Dharmendra and Asrani, making the reissue a tribute to their legacy.\n\n\t“This is a milestone that finally presents ‘Sholay’ exactly as it was intended to be seen,” said Shehzad Sippy, reviving the Sippy Films banner. “This version contains the film’s original ending as well as the original soundtrack composed by R.D. Burman. I can’t wait for audiences to experience it on the big screen for the first time.”\n\n\tThe restored version follows a three-year collaboration between Film Heritage Foundation and Sippy Films that culminated in a world premiere at Italy’s Il Cinema Ritrovato Festival in June. That screening marked the first public viewing of the original ending, in which Thakur kills Gabbar Singh rather than having him arrested by police, a change mandated by India’s Central Board of Film Certification in 1975 during the Emergency period.\n\t\n\n\tWritten by legendary duo Salim-Javed, “Sholay” blends Western influences from Sergio Leone, Akira Kurosawa and John Sturges with distinctly Indian storytelling. \n\n\tDespite a modest initial reception, the 204-minute epic dominated Indian box office for 19 years after its Aug. 15, 1975 release, running for five consecutive years at Mumbai’s Minerva cinema. A 2002 British Film Institute poll named it the greatest Indian film ever made, while BBC India crowned it “Film of the Millennium” in 1999.\n\n\tWatch the trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tResplendent in costume and production design, but shaky in overall execution, the star-studded fantasy romance “100 Nights of Hero” is the second feature from writer-director Julia Jackman. Based on the graphic novel by Isabel Greenberg, it takes its cues from “One Thousand and One Nights” (or “The Arabian Nights”) of West Asian folklore, responsible for such cultural mainstays as Aladdin, Sinbad and Ali Baba. However, in Jackman’s movie, these narrative layers aren’t nearly as fantastical as their forebears from the Islamic Golden Age. They serve as thinly veiled extensions for their fictitious storyteller: a Scheherazade stand-in, whose queer reimagining works far better in theory than in practice.\n\t\n\n\tThe film initially features a mischievous spark, as Felicity Jones narrates the meta-textual origins of the subsequent story. A child with godlike powers, referred to as “kiddo” (Safia Oakley-Green) defies her carnivalesque father, “Birdman” (Richard E. Grant) by creating the world and its human inhabitants. This flourish of magical realism gives way to the central conceit and its Victorian dollhouse conception, as a melancholy woman named Cherry (Maika Monroe) is married off to the neglectful prince Jerome (Amir El-Masry), with the expectation of bearing an heir. Jerome, it turns out, isn’t interesting in consummating their union, even though he boasts otherwise. So, the blame for their lack off progeny falls on Cherry’s shoulders.\n\n\n\tAll the while, Cherry’s servant and loyal companion, the diligent, pixie-haired Hero (Emma Corrin), maintains a watchful eye and lends emotional support. When Jerome takes an extended leave of absence from his castle, he makes a wager with his scheming friend Manfred (Nicholas Galitzine), who sets out to seduce Cherry in his stead, in an effort to prove her infidelity. Cherry, it turns out, is taken with Manfred’s advances (and with Galitzine’s He-Man physique). But she remains conflicted, and thus, open to Cherry’s distractions, in the form of nightly stories about women in similar positions, ending on a cliffhanger every night. At least, that’s the intent.\n\t\n\n\tNight after night, Hero’s yarns enchant the would-be couple — literally at times, as Hero appears to call on witchcraft, causing Manfred to lose all sense of days and weeks. This imbues the passageways of Jerome’s lush estate (guarded by masked figures) with a dreamlike quality. However, the fog that falls upon Manfred during these bedtime stories is rarely supported by the tales themselves. One follows a betrothed woman, Rosa (Charli XCX), in a remarkably familiar marital dilemma. Another is about Hero’s own mother, and the tales she once told Hero about her grandmother, who happens the Moon. Before long, these stories become bound by references to a secret society of storytellers, as the movie gestures towards the idea of narrative as a weapon in the face of gendered oppression. But these are glancing blows that barely land.\n\n\tAt the core of Hero’s tall tales is her own affection for Cherry, which is not altogether uninteresting, but neither the movie’s queer nor heterosexual pairings are ever presented with enough subdued passion to really light a fire under the film. Ironically, its story is far more told, in words, than actually felt, as the film spends much of its runtime circling its feminist themes rather than engaging with them head on, as a story of love and companionship beset by hegemonic structures. Its comedic flourishes are appropriately restrained, with humor seeping through its stilted compositions — picture an austere Wes Anderson — but its visual approach rarely evolves, even though the characters’ evolving dynamics demand aesthetic transformation. The camera seems hesitant to explore the movie’s picturesque world, as though tethered to the still panels of its comic source material; if the actors have romantic and sexual chemistry, they’re seldom allowed to explore it either.\n\n\tThe haziness that scatters the on-screen candles and other light sources gives it the appearance of a lurid fairytale. However, its human elements — its withheld, morose performances, and the distance with which they’re captured — render its characters’ alleged fervor, attraction and vigor mere theoretical concepts, rather than embodied impulses that either create a sense of allure, or justify the numerous overtures towards companionship and community as foundational rebellions against hetero-patriarchy. It’s a gorgeous-looking film, but a drag.\n",

    "description": "\n\tNetflix has entered exclusive talks with Warner Bros. Discovery to acquire the company’s film and television studio, as well as the HBO Max streamin",
    "body": "\n\tNetflix has entered exclusive talks with Warner Bros. Discovery to acquire the company’s film and television studio, as well as the HBO Max streaming service, Variety confirms. \n\n\tThe development comes after a weeks-long bidding war for the assets at Warner Bros. Discovery between Netflix and rivals Paramount Skydance and Comcast. Paramount Skydance, under the newly minted studio CEO David Ellison, had sought to acquire the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery in an all-cash deal, while both Netflix and Comcast only submitted bids for the company’s studio and streaming businesses. News of the exclusive window was first reported by Bloomberg News.\n\t\n\n\tThe move marks a shocking turnaround for Netflix, which for years has resisted opportunities to make a big bet on traditional Hollywood assets. Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, Netflix’s co-CEOs, have long asserted that the company’s growth was not hampered by the lack of a deep content library. But the chance to acquire the vast Warner Bros. film and TV library and the equally renowned HBO brand was too enticing to pass up. Any deal would undoubtedly face a difficult road to securing regulatory approval given the unpredictability of the Trump administration. Already, the Directors Guild of America and Cinema United, the exhibition trade organization, issued statements with warnings that the marriage of Netflix and WBD would have dire consequences for theatrical moviegoing.\n\n\n\tThe news follows months of speculation and anxiety in the larger entertainment and media sector surrounding the potential sale of Warner Bros. Discovery. Ellison’s Paramount was the first and, arguably, most aggressive bidder at roughly $27 per share for the whole of Warner Bros. Discovery. Netflix and Comcast came in later to solidify an intense horse race.\n\t\n\n\tThe bidding war saw highest offers submitted Monday. Paramount went nuclear Thursday morning, accusing Netflix of impropriety surrounding its bid for the legendary studio, arguing that it “has a credible basis to believe that the sales process has been tainted by management conflicts, including certain members of management’s potential personal interests in post-transaction roles and compensation.”\n\n\tParamount’s offer submitted on Monday included financial backing of three Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, Variety reported.\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery, the byproduct of a hastily arranged 2022 marriage of AT&T’s WarnerMedia and Discovery Communications, was thrust into M&A play in October when David Ellison made an unsolicited offer for the entirety of the WBD.\n\n\tPrior to the Ellison move, Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav and the board opted to address the company’s stock price slump with a spinoff plan that would separate Warner Bros. studio and HBO Max streaming from the legacy linear cable channels (CNN, TNT, TBS et al) that defined the company’s strength in the Time Warner era. WBD confirmed plans to proceed with a spinoff plan that was projected to close by mid-2026. Ellison already had his eye on a WBD acquisition to add needed heft and scale to Paramount’s streaming and studio operations. But the WBD divestiture plan likely forced Ellison to act sooner rather than later.\n\n\tShould Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery reach a deal, it would mark a seismic transformation in the media and entertainment landscape. As the leader in paid streaming services, Netflix has grown into far and away the largest and most influential company in Hollywood with a market cap of $437 billion, far eclipsing even Disney ($190 billion). \n\n\tNetflix did not buy its way into Hollywood, it built up into a dominant position by starting as the first premier streamer, beginning with a library of licensed content from traditional studios before developing original content, with outside studios as well as wholly owned productions such as the “Stranger Things” fantasy franchise. \n\n\tA deal would give Netflix rights to the Warner Bros. library — from “Casablanca” and “The Maltese Falcon” to “Friends” to “Ted Lasso” — and its IP, including Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and other comic book characters at DC Studios. HBO’s library includes such landmark TV series as “The Sopranos,” “The Wire,” “Deadwood,” “Game of Thrones,” “Sex and the City,” “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and “Six Feet Under.” WBD’s assets also include broad film and TV rights to the Harry Potter franchise.\n\t\n\n\tBut a potential Netflix-WBD acquisition will also face an uphill battle in securing government approval for the deal, given Netflix’s size and market clout. On Thursday, Variety exclusively reported that a consortium of A-list talent signed an open letter to Congress, imploring members to speak out against a Netflix deal and arguing that the streamer would “effectively hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace” by reducing output to movie theaters and forcing down subsequent licensing fees for home video windows. The statement was signed anonymously, with an explanation that it was done so “not out of cowardice” but fear of retaliation, given Netflix’s considerable power in the marketplace.\n\n\tLate Thursday, the Directors Guild of America issued a sharply worded statement underscoring its misgivings about the transaction.\n\n\t“The news that Netflix had secured exclusive rights to negotiate for WBD raises significant concerns for the DGA,” the guild stated. “We believe that a vibrant, competitive industry — one that fosters creativity and encourages genuine competition for talent — is essential to safeguarding the careers and creative rights of directors and their teams. We will be meeting with Netflix to outline our concerns and better understand their vision for the future of the company. While we undertake this due diligence we will not be commenting further.”\n\n\tThe deal has drawn particularly sharp criticism in the bedrock film production community and among exhibitors, who see Netflix’s strategic goals as a grave threat to the moviegoing tradition. However, sources close to Netflix urged onlookers to reserve judgment and speculation about its strategic approach to theatrical film releases amid the cut-throat dynamics of a bidding war. These sources said Netflix would naturally evaluate its film distribution protocols and corporate priorities if it were to make such a massive acquisition such as Warner Bros., which is built to distribute films around the world.\n\n\tAnother dire warning about the consequences of a Netflix-WBD union came late Thursday from Cinema United, the exhibition industry trade organization previously known as the National Association of Theater Owners.\n\n\t“The proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business. The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,” said Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of Cinema United. “Cinema United stands ready to support industry changes that lead to increased movie production and give consumers more opportunities to enjoy a day at the local theatre. But Netflix’s stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite. Regulators must look closely at the specifics of this proposed transaction and understand the negative impact it will have on consumers, exhibition and the entertainment industry.”\n\t\n\n\tO’Leary didn’t shy away from pointing out the distinction between the medium in which Netflix has thrived — television — and theatrical films. He also pointed out trickle-down effects of moviegoing on restaurants, bars and other retailers, calling exhibitors “a Main Street industry.”\n\n\t“Netflix success is television, not movies on the big screen. A true commitment to exhibition means a robust slate of movies with a meaningful period of theatrical exclusivity supported by marketing. Sporadic and truncated theatrical releases to meet awards criteria in a handful of theatres is not a commitment to exhibition,” O’Leary said. “Movie theaters are cultural and economic anchors of communities of all sizes — we are a Main Street industry. Research shows that for each dollar spent in a local movie theatre, an additional $1.50 is spent in surrounding businesses in the community—restaurants, bars, shopping centers, transportation. That is what is at risk here if we sanction fewer movies in the marketplace. Theaters will close, communities will suffer, jobs will be lost.”\n\n\t(Cynthia Littleton contributed to this report.)\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt the 7th Hainan Island International Film Festival in China, jury president Marco Müller urged audiences and industry to rethink the event’s place on the calendar, arguing that its slot between AFM and Berlin gives Hainan a unique chance to premiere the films that will define the coming year – not recap the one that’s ending.\n\n\tFestival jurors acknowledged the challenges facing a young festival in an already overcrowded global film schedule. Speaking at a press conference introducing the festival jury, Müller, jury president for HIIFF’s Golden Coconut Award, attempted to redefine the festival’s schedule, late in the year, as its greatest strategic asset.\n\t\n\n\tRather than presenting a summary of the current year’s films, Müller argued that the HIIFF could be a platform that introduces groundbreaking films for the year ahead.\n\n\n\t“The timing is particularly important,” Müller stated, noting the festival’s placement, sandwiched between AFM in November, and the Berlin Film Festival in February. “The Hainan Film Festival’s schedule happens to provide an opportunity to let young, media and film-obsessed audiences discover the newest films. That is, films that are coming out immediately next year.”\n\n\tThe sense of a festival still finding its footing between domestic focus and an international outlook was also evident in the responses of other jury members to questions ranging from China’s local box office to Asian-American representation in Hollywood.\n\n\tWhen asked about the latter, documentary juror and director Renee Tajima-Peña referenced the #OscarsSoWhite campaign and the push for greater AAPI representation in AMPAS.\n\t\n\n\t“We really had to fight to gain a place at the table,” said Tajima-Peña. “When I first started out, Asian Americans were really marginalized in Hollywood, the entertainment business and documentaries.”\n\n\t“Many of our stories are rooted here in China, and rooted in the Chinese diaspora story, and we are hungry to tell them.”\n\n\tThe press conference also threw up questions which gave insights into how China’s local media views the film industry at the moment. One question contended that the number of scripts entering production are decreasing, investment is becoming cautious, and distribution cycles are lengthening.\n\n\tIn response, veteran Chinese actor Guo Tao suggested that the answer lay in balancing personal artistic expression with commercial sensibilities.\n\n\t“The current film market needs more filmmakers to uphold the principle of ‘content is king,’ focusing on the story. This is crucial,” said Guo. “We have blockbuster films with high box office returns, while lacking artistic merit. The opposite is also true. We need to find a good balance between the two.”\n\n\tThe event also underscored the festival’s role in cultural diplomacy, with the 50th anniversary of China-Thailand diplomatic relations being celebrated with a series of Chinese-Thai events.\n\n\t“China and Thailand have always been ‘one family,'” said Thai director Banjong Pisanthanakun, referencing several Thai films that have resonated with Mainland Chinese audiences, like “How To Make Millions Before Grandma Dies.”\n\n\tWhile promotional posters for Hollywood juggernaut “Avatar: Fire and Ash” line every walkway at the festival grounds, Argentine director Mariano Llinás offered a gentle rebuff to the concept of the blockbuster film.\n\n\tLlinás urged filmmakers to work on smaller films, and championed a return to intimate productions, a model he has long practiced as a founder of the El Pampero Cine film collective, which prioritizes small films and a revolving repertory cast of friends and family. He advocated for a filmmaking model driven by camaraderie rather than established film industry structures.\n\n\t“It’s because it’s been made and thought by a small group of people, not by a big enterprise or studio, and that would be the secret for a personal approach to cinema,” said Llinás.\n\t\n\n\t“So I think the idea of making a picture made by friends is the answer. Try to make your pictures small and smaller and they would belong to you in a deeper way.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAcclaimed Bangladeshi director Rubaiyat Hossain, known for her powerful women-centric films, has completed principal photography in Dhaka on her feminist supernatural drama “The Difficult Bride,” unveiling a cast led by three Bangladesh National Film Award winners.\n\n\tThe production brings together Rikita Nondine Shimu (Venice selection “Once Upon a Time in Calcutta”), Azmeri Haque Badhon (Asia Pacific Screen Awards best actress winner for Cannes selection “Rehana”) and Sunehrah Binte Kamal (“No Dorai”). They’re joined by Zaineen Karim Chowdhury, a Smith College graduate making her lead acting debut after previously serving as an assistant director.\n\t\n\n\tThe narrative follows Zai, a bride-to-be in present-day Dhaka who is in love with her groom and dreams of a fairytale wedding, but secretly struggles with her body’s resistance to wedding rituals. As stress and emotional pain intensify, a mysterious woman with long hair begins appearing in Zai’s imagination.\n\n\n\t“These actors made me feel safe enough to open myself completely. They gave everything – emotionally, spiritually, creatively. I am very grateful for their trust, their generosity, their sheer artistry and conviction,” Hossain says. \n\n\t“Casting Zaineen as the lead cast was a huge leap of faith for me as she had no experience in acting and came with no training. However, she was able to deliver exactly what I needed and can’t imagine anyone else in this role,” Hossain adds. “She worked extremely hard and completely internalized the role. She was someone who made me feel safe enabling me to open up my most private inner emotions to her.”\n\t\n\n\tHossain’s films have travelled the world and won awards. “Meherjaan” (2011) won laurels at the Abuja, Long Island, New Jersey, Northampton and Philadelphia festivals, “Under Construction” (2015) swept the Vesoul Asian Film Festival and won at Dhaka, Cine bajo la Luna and Salamindanaw, while “Made in Bangladesh” (2019) played Toronto, swept Amiens and won Torino and Tromsø.\n\n\tMarking the culmination of a project she describes as “a film 21 years in the making,” Hossain first attempted “The Difficult Bride” as a short film in 2006 before shelving it, returning to the material repeatedly across two decades.\n\n\t“I kept revisiting and rewriting this story over the last 21 years,” Hossain says. “This film lived with me for half my life. To finally make it — with these actors, this team, at this moment — feels like a quiet miracle.”\n\n\tBehind the camera, the film features cinematography by Leonor Teles, the Portuguese filmmaker and Golden Bear winner whose recent work includes “Baan” (2023). “Working with Leonor was a joy and a gift,” Hossain says. “She brought courage, intuition, sensitivity and an emotional attentiveness that enriched the film’s world without ever imposing on it. Her images held space for the vulnerability I was trying to explore. I really can’t imagine doing this film with anyone else, so I am glad Leonor could do it despite many schedule issues.”\n\n\tProduction design comes from Jonaki Bhattacharya (Venice winner “Labour of Love”), while the score is composed by James Williams (“Raw,” “Titane”) and Dameer Khan. Badhon, Chowdhury, Khan and Shimu contributed additional dialogue throughout the shoot.\n\n\tThe shoot marked what Hossain calls a home ground project, filmed in her own residence and led by predominantly female heads of department. Editor Raphaëlle Martin-Hölger, who previously cut Hossain’s “Made in Bangladesh,” returns for post-production duties. Sound engineer Marie-Clotilde Chery rounds out the key crew.\n\n\t“The Difficult Bride” is produced by François d’Artemare (France), Anna Katchko (Germany), Pedro Borges (Portugal), Ingrid Lill Høgtun (Norway) and Hossain (Bangladesh). Production companies include France’s Les Films de l’Après-midi, Germany’s Tandem Productions, Portugal’s Midas Filmes, Norway’s Barentsfilm AS and Bangladesh’s Khona Talkies.\n\t\n\n\tThe film is backed by Norway’s Sorfond, Germany’s World Cinema Fund, Portugal’s ICA, the Eurimages Fund and France’s Aide aux Cinémas du Monde (CNC). The project previously participated at the the Berlinale Co-Production Market. \n\n\tThe project will be presented at the Les Arcs Film Festival’s Work-in-Progress program later this month. Post-production is currently underway, with completion expected by March 2026.\n",

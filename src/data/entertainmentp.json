    "body": "\n\tBeyoncé is now a billionaire — making her the fifth musician to reach the milestone, according to Forbes.\n\n\tThe pop singer joins her husband, Jay-Z, along with Taylor Swift, Bruce Springsteen and Rihanna, in the billionaire club.\n\n\tIn recent years, Beyoncé has seen major success. Her Renaissance World Tour in 2023 grossed nearly $600 million. In 2024, she released the country album “Cowboy Carter,” which went on to anchor the world’s highest-grossing concert tour of 2025.\n\t\n\n\tBeyoncé founded her own entertainment company, Parkwood Entertainment, in 2008. According to Forbes, Parkwood “manages her career and produces all of her music, documentaries and concerts, fronting most of the production costs in order to capture more of the back-end economics.”\n\n\n\tThe business publication adds, “In total, the Cowboy Carter Tour grossed more than $400 million in ticket sales, per Pollstar, and another $50 million in merchandise sold at the shows, according to Forbes estimates. And because Parkwood produced it all, Beyoncé was able to secure higher profit margins. Combining what she made touring with earnings from her music catalog and sponsorship deals this year, Forbes estimates she brought in $148 million in 2025 before taxes, making her the third-highest paid musician in the world.” \n\n\tForbes also noted other major sources of income Beyoncé has earned as a solo artist, including an estimated $60 million from Netflix for the 2019 documentary “Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé.” She reportedly earned another $50 million for her halftime performance during Netflix’s first Christmas Day NFL game in 2024. The previous year, she produced a concert film of her Renaissance World Tour and distributed it directly through AMC, earning nearly half of the film’s $44 million global box office gross.\n",

His third feature, “Lost Land” (Harà Watan), premiered in the Horizons section of the Venice Film Festival, where it won the special jury prize, immediately putting him on the global radar. The film — shot entirely in the Rohingya language and centered on the lives of young Rohingya refugees — went on to secure the Golden Yusr for best feature at the Red Sea International Film Festival, confirming its cross-regional impact. Earlier works such as “Passage of Life” and “Along the Sea” had already attracted attention at major festivals, but “Lost Land” elevated Fujimoto from a programmer favorite to a filmmaker with genuine international traction.Naman Ramachandran\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOwen Cooper — ‘Adolescence’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tBefore “Adolescence,” nobody had seen Owen Cooper on screen. Quite literally. Netflix’s one-shot mini-series phenomenon — in which he played a teenage boy accused of murdering a classmate — didn’t simply mark his breakout moment, but was the youngster’s first professional acting role. Such was Cooper’s astonishing performance, applauded for its raw emotion and maturity, that few could believe it was his debut. The nine months since have been nothing short of life-changing for the teenager from the north English town of Warrington. “Adolescence’s” awards run is still ongoing, but he’s already become the youngest male actor to win a Primetime Emmy (he was just 15 at the time) and with the SAGs, Golden Globes and BAFTA TV Awards on the horizon, many more major honors are no doubt incoming. Thankfully, while Cooper is now working out how to juggle school work with awards ceremonies, fashion shows and all the other trappings of being arguably TV’s most talked-about newcomer of the year, his meteoric success doesn’t look like a flash-in-the-pan moment. Next up, he’s appearing in Emerald Fennell’s “Wuthering Heights” as a young Heathcliff, while he was recently announced as part of the all-star cast for Tom Ford’s hotly-anticipated next feature. The future looks very, very bright.Alex Ritman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJeanne Goursaud — ‘Exterritorial’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAs the formidable Germanic tribal noblewoman Thusnelda, Goursaud made an impression in Netflix German epic “Barbarians,” hacking her way through multiple body parts of any poor Roman soldier who crossed sword with her. It was really in 2025’s “Exterritorial,” however, that the German-French actor not only underscored her action moves in some brutal fight scenes but showed subtler acting and star power, playing ex-soldier Sara. The sole survivor of an ambush in Afghanistan, still suffering from PTSD, her young son vanishes in thin air from a playroom at the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt. Sara will do anything — and punch anyone — to get him back. Released April 30 to become Germany’s biggest hit ever on Netflix, scoring 91.7 million views, “Exterritorial” is also the biggest non-English non-franchise title from anywhere in the world for the U.S. streaming service this year.John Hopewell\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJulia Jackman — ‘100 Nights of Hero’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for BFI\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAfter gaining buzz with her directorial debut “Bonus Track” in 2023, Canadian director Jackman broke through this year with the indie fantasy “100 Nights of Hero.” The film’s impressive cast — including Emma Corrin, Maika Monroe, Nicholas Galitzine, Charli xcx, Richard E. Grant, Felicity Jones and Amir El-Masry — and dystopian take on Middle Eastern folklore propelled it to Venice Critics’ Week in September and as the closing film of the BFI London Film Festival the next month. Reviews praised Jackman’s distinctive world-building and voice, while nearly every actor involved gushed about the film’s collaborative set and boots-on-the-ground ethos. “100 Nights of Hero” is currently screening in U.S. theaters via IFC and will be debuting in U.K. cinemas in February.Ellise Shafer\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tIshaan Khatter — ‘Homebound,’ ‘The Royals’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIshaan Khatter’s international breakout has been years in the making, but it finally snapped into focus over the past year. After first drawing global attention with Mira Nair’s BBC/Netflix adaptation “A Suitable Boy” (2020), Khatter reached a wider mainstream audience with Netflix’s glossy murder mystery “The Perfect Couple” (2024) opposite Nicole Kidman, showcasing a fluency in English-language material that few South Asian actors manage so smoothly. He followed that in 2025 with Netflix India’s contemporary series “The Royals,” reinforcing his commercial pull at home, while Neeraj Ghaywan’s Cannes-bowed “Homebound” pushed him firmly back into prestige territory and landed on the Oscars best international feature shortlist. Comfortable toggling between streamer-friendly spectacle and festival-caliber drama, Khatter now looks less like a crossover experiment and more like a genuinely international leading man in the making.NR\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tInga Ibsdotter Lilleaas — ‘Sentimental Value’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJoachim Trier helped turn Renate Reinsve into a major star (and a Palme d’Or winner) with “The Worst Person in the World,” and it looks like he’s doing something similar for fellow Norwegian Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas with his follow-up. “Sentimental Value,” about the fractured relationship between a famed director and his two estranged daughters, was a critical hit in Cannes and has comfortably set sail into awards season. But despite the presence of established names such Stellan Skarsgard, Elle Fanning and Reinsve, for many critics it was the quiet strength that Lilleaas offered in her supporting role that gave the film its most moving elements. The accolades have already begun piling up for the 36-year-old, with honors from the National Board of Review and Palm Springs Film Festival, plus a sizable haul of pending nominations (including from the Globes Globes). Awards pundits already have her down as a near-certainty for the Oscars.AR\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLalisa Manobal — ‘The White Lotus’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Fabio Lovino/HBO\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tLalisa Manobal, better known simply as Lisa, made one of the most high-profile crossovers of the year with her leap from global pop stardom to scripted television. The Blackpink superstar made her acting debut in HBO’s “The White Lotus,” joining the third season of Mike White’s satirical comedy-drama, which shifted the franchise’s focus to Thailand. Her role was small within the ensemble, prompting some fan disappointment over limited screen time, but it placed her inside one of television’s most scrutinized prestige series and offered a low-risk entry point into acting. Her casting broadened the show’s global reach and marked a notable step outside Hollywood’s usual casting playbook. Lisa is next set to appear opposite Don Lee in Netflix’s “Tygo,” a standalone film set within the “Extraction” action universe, cementing her move from music icon to emerging screen presence.NR\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLouis Partridge — ‘House of Guinness,’ ‘Jay Kelly’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThanks largely to “Enola Holmes,” not to mention “Pistol,” “Disclaimer” and — going much further back — “Paddington 2,” Louis Partridge is hardly a newcomer. But 2025 definitely marked a turning point for the fast-rising British actor. “House of Guinness,” Steven Knight’s 19th-century cocktail of “Peaky Blinders” and “Succession” for Netflix, saw the 22-year-old take on one of his chunkiest roles to date as the real-life boss of the Irish brewing giant. Meanwhile, Noah Baumbach’s Venice-bowing Hollywood saga “Jay Kelly” added George Clooney to his growing list of co-stars. And while all this was going on, Partridge was mostly vaulting about the British countryside in a red army uniform, playing Jane Austen’s notorious knave George Wickham in “Pride & Prejudice” alongside Emma Corrin, Jack Lowden and Olivia Colman. The Netflix series is set to launch next year and will likely push his star wattage even higher.AR\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAlauda Ruiz de Azúa — ‘Querer,’ ‘Sundays’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCan she do nothing wrong? In 2022, Pedro Almodóvar endorsed her first feature, “Lullaby,” calling it “undoubtedly the best debut in Spanish cinema for years.” Three years later, Basque writer-director Ruíz de Azúa has made good on that promise, scoring a remarkable double. In March, she scooped the biggest prize at Series Mania, Europe’s most important TV festival, for her first series “Querer.” And this September, she walked off with the top Golden Shell at San Sebastián for feature “Sundays.” Set in her native Basque Country, “Sundays,” a suspense drama portrait of failing family dynamics, has also achieved the holy grail of any feature these days selling on the open market: a powerful performance in its home territory, reaching around €4.0 million ($4.7 million) to date in Spain and rapid early major market sales accounting for half the world. Few European auteurs have emerged so fast.JH\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMascha Schilinski — ‘Sound of Falling’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: WWD via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWhen “Sound of Falling” premiered in Cannes on May 14, 41-year-old Berliner Mascha Schilinksi became an instant sensation with her meditation on history, memory and inherited trauma that traces the lives of four generations of women across a century in a remote German farmhouse. Variety’s Guy Lodge hailed the movie as a “shattering” epic that sends its director “into the big leagues” thanks to an “astonishingly poised and ambitious second feature.” After scoring the jury prize in a tie at Cannes, “Sound of Falling” played at high-profile international events, including the New York Film Festival, and is Germany’s shortlisted Oscars contender in the best international feature category. Mubi is releasing the film in the U.S. in January. Meanwhile, Schilinski recently signed with CAA.Nick Vivarelli\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFrancesco Sossai – ‘The Last One for the Road’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThis year at Cannes, then under-the-radar director Francesco Sossai, 36, pulled Italy’s biggest cinematic coup by landing in the Un Certain Regard competition with his boozy road movie “The Last One for the Road.” Praised by Variety’s Tomris Laffly as a “pleasant Italian gem on drinking buddies, aging and wistful flavors of life” this fresh film — about two broke petty-criminals who pick up a young architecture student and embark on a journey filled with hangovers and philosophical conversations — subsequently traveled widely, including to the Toronto and New York Film Festivals. The low-budget “Last One for the Road” has also scored a relatively robust $1.5 million at the Italian box office and sold to a slew of territories via Paris-based sales company Lucky Number.

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” continued to dominate the Korean box office over the Dec. 26–28 frame, grossing $8.6 million from more than 1 million admissions, according to KOBIS, the tracking service operated by the Korean Film Council. The film has now amassed $32.5 million.\n\n\t“Zootopia 2” remained a powerful No. 2, adding $3 million for the weekend and lifting its cumulative total to $50.3 million. The sequel has now crossed 7.4 million admissions, cementing its status as one of 2025’s top-performing imported animated releases.\n\t\n\n\tOpening in third place was the South Korean romantic drama “Even If This Love Disappears from the World Tonight,” which debuted with $1.2 million. Directed by Kim Hye-young and based on the novel by Ichijo Misaki, the film stars Choo Young-woo and Shin Si-ah in a bittersweet high-school romance centered on a girl with anterograde amnesia whose memories reset each morning. The film has earned $2.5 million in its first five days.\n\n\n\tJapanese animated release “Crayon Shinchan the Movie: Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers” followed in fourth, grossing $773,000 for a running total of $1.8 million.\n\n\tLocal family title “Pororo the Movie: Sweet Castle Adventure” placed fifth, adding $147,000 to reach $1.2 million. Comedy-drama “The People Upstairs” continued its steady run in sixth, pushing its cumulative haul to $3.6 million. Directed by Ha Jung-woo and starring Gong Hyo-jin, Kim Dong-wook, Lee Ha-nee and Ha Jung-woo himself, the film follows a downstairs couple driven to exhaustion by constant noise from their upstairs neighbours. A tense dinner meant to resolve the issue quickly unravels into an evening of sharp confessions and shifting dynamics.\n\t\n\n\tStephen King adaptation “The Life of Chuck” opened in seventh with $43,642, while “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” added $38,622, bringing its total to $1.5 million.\n\n\tRounding out the chart were Japanese anthology features “Tatsuki Fujimoto 17–26 Part-1” and “Tatsuki Fujimoto 17–26 Part-2,” which earned $44,274 and $44,473 respectively.\n\n\tThe top 10 films collectively grossed $14.02 million over the Dec. 26–28 weekend, slightly down from last weekend’s $15.2 million. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMalcolm is officially back in the middle. \n\n\tHulu’s revival of the hit early 2000s sitcom, titled “Malcolm in the Middle: Life’s Still Unfair,” revealed its first trailer on Monday alongside an April 10 premiere date. The new four-part event follows grown-up child prodigy Malcolm (Frankie Muniz) as he and his daughter (Keeley Karsten) reunite with his family after hiding from them for over a decade.\n\n\n\t“My life is fantastic now,” Muniz says in the trailer. “All I had to do was stay away from my family!” However, Malcolm is roped back into the family dynamic when his parents, Hal (Bryan Cranston) and Lois (Jane Kaczmarek), demand that he attend their 40th wedding anniversary party. Naturally, chaos ensues.\n\t\n\n\tThe original “Malcolm in the Middle” ran on Fox for seven seasons from 2000 to 2006. Nearly all of the show’s main cast is returning for the revival, including Muniz, Kaczmarek, Cranston, Chris Kennedy Masterson, Justin Berfield and Emy Coligado. As previously announced, Caleb Ellsworth-Clark is taking over the role of Dewey. Other new cast members include Karsten, Vaughan Murrae and Kiana Madeira.\n\n\tLinwood Boomer created the original series and returns as writer and executive producer. Cranston, Tracy Katsky of KatCo, Gail Berman and New Regency’s Arnon Milchan, Yariv Milchan and Natalie Lehmann are executive producers. Ken Kwapis directed all four episodes and executive produced. Jimmy Simons and Laura Delahaye are co-executive producers. The series hails from Disney Branded Television and is produced by 20th Television.\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “Malcolm in the Middle: Life’s Still Unfair” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” remained the dominant force at the China box office over the Dec. 26–28 frame, adding RMB166.4 million ($23.4 million) to lift its local cumulative total to RMB700 million ($98.6 million), according to Artisan Gateway.\n\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” held steady in second place, grossing $15.2 million in its fifth weekend. The animated sequel has now amassed $558.3 million in China, cementing its position as one of the market’s highest-grossing releases of the year.\n\t\n\n\tMaoyan Movie’s new release “The Fire Raven” opened in third place with $2.8 million. Directed and written by Sam Quah, the crime thriller centers on a cold case involving the murder of a student in Duma City, with a witness and a police officer drawn into a wider web of corruption and retribution. The film stars Peng Yuchang, Alan Aruna and Chang Ning.\n\n\n\tRomantic drama “Love Is Hard,” from NCM Television, was at No. 4 with $2.1 million, taking its cume to $4 million. Co-written and directed by Dong Xu, the third entry in the “Qing Sheng” series centres on a marriage strained by a crisis of trust, with elaborate schemes and misunderstandings pushing a couple into wildly comedic territory. The ensemble features Xiao Yang, Tan Zhuo, Qiao Shan, Chang Yuan and Zhang Xiaowan.\n\n\tRounding out the top five, Dirty Monkeys Studio’s “Escape From the Outland” earned $1.7 million, bringing its total to $2.7 million. Directed by Shen Ao, the film follows a foreign correspondent, his wife and an engineer who are abducted by an extremist group while on assignment abroad, starring Yang Xiao, Xi Qi and Simon Yam.\n\t\n\n\tOverall, the China box office generated $48.6 million for the weekend. The 2025 year-to-date total now stands at $7.26 billion, running 23.1% ahead of the same point in 2024.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The X-Files” is headed to Pluto TV, becoming available beginning on New Year’s Day.\n\n\tThough the beloved, long-running sci-fi drama is already available to stream on Hulu and Disney+, its addition to Paramount-owned Pluto TV will make it completely free to watch with ad breaks. In addition to its on-demand availability, “The X-Files” will also have a dedicated 24/7 linear channel within Pluto TV’s sci-fi category. The channel will kick off by running through the entire series chronologically, which will be followed by curated weekend marathons.\n\t\n\n\t“The X-Files” premiered on Fox in 1993 and originally ran for nine seasons until 2002. 20th Century Fox released two “X-Files” films in theaters in 1998 and 2008. Later, the series was revived for Seasons 10 and 11, which aired on Fox in 2016 and 2018. All 11 seasons, which span 218 episodes, will be included in the Pluto TV release.\n\n\n\tCreated by Chris Carter, “The X-Files” starred David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as FBI special agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, who investigate unsolved cases surrounding the paranormal. \n\n\tWhen naming “The X-Files” to its list of the 100 greatest TV series of all time in 2023, Variety wrote, “Let’s be clear: Your imagination has to be very large to appreciate the world of ‘The X-Files.’ But thanks to David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson (and their undeniable chemistry), fans hung on to every surreal and fantastical thing Mulder and Scully said. Balancing a rich (if eventually frustrating) mythology with its famous ‘Monster of the Week’ episodes — and balancing Duchovny’s true believer with Anderson’s perpetually shocked skeptic, ‘The X-Files’ was a canny, glossy mixture of FBI work with the endless possibilities of the universe. It worked well enough to last nine seasons, two movies and another two seasons in revival, and many fans still believe the truth is out there.”\n\t\n\n\tBesides “The X-Files,” sci-fi series with dedicated Pluto TV channels include “Star Trek,” “The Twilight Zone,” “Stargate” and “Doctor Who.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt has always been easy to trivialize Brigitte Bardot. In 1956, starring in the movie that made her a global sensation, “And God Created Woman,” what she did was not widely regarded as accomplished screen acting — or, in a certain way, as acting at all. The movie treated her as a ripe object of erotic fixation, and that’s just what she was called upon to play. She is introduced with shots of her bare feet arched just so, her body lying naked, face down on the ground. “Sex kitten.” “Baby doll.” “Teenage temptress.” At the time, she was branded all those things. Was the movie a sober French drama or soft-core porn? It was marketed as something in between.\n\t\n\n\tYet there was more at stake. And part of it is that Bardot, who died Sunday at 91, made no less a figure than Marilyn Monroe seem a sex symbol from an entirely different era. Monroe, while a huge star, still had one arched foot in the straitlaced past; Bardot was the woman-child of the world to come — the brazen girl who already embodied and anticipated the spirit of the swinging ’60s.  \n\n\n\tIn “And God Created Woman,” she’s frisky, she’s sultry, she’s angry, she’s spectacularly uninhibited, and she signifies a new kind of erotic abandon that is liberated from the old strictures of the femme fatale. Her character, Juliette, is not a gold-digger; she rejects the advances of the rich men who come on to her. She simply does what she wants to do. “All the future does is spoil the present,” she tells a potential new lover. Yet when she learns, a bit later, that his proclamations of love are for the birds — that he doesn’t want a future with her, just a fling ­— the wounded smolder on her face becomes the ripest thing about her. At the climax, doing a dance of abandonment to the music of a hot Caribbean band, you see her literally spinning out of the control of the men around her.\n\t\n\n\tA word about the Bardot pout. It’s sexy as hell, but it’s a pout of steel. It has resolve. Which is why it’s so sexy. There was as much power in that pout as there was in Barbara Stanwyck’s snarl or Rita Hayworth’s come-hither glare. Maybe more. Because it’s as if Bardot had absorbed the temptation vibrations of all the screen goddesses who had come before her and was standing on their shoulders, reaching for something more…real.  \n\n\tTwo years after “And God Created Woman” came out, becoming the top-grossing foreign-language film of all time in the United States, the great French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir wrote of Bardot, “Her clothes are not fetishes, and when she strips she is not unveiling a mystery. She is showing her body, neither more nor less, and that body rarely settles into a state of immobility. She walks, she dances, she moves about. Her eroticism is not magical, but aggressive. In the game of love, she is as much a hunter as she is a prey. The male is an object to her, just as she is to him.”\n\n\tThe title “And God Created Woman” sounds grandiose, but what it meant is: God had now created a new kind of woman. A woman who’s effortlessly confident and coveted, who’s the quintessence (to quote Jim Morrison) of a 20th century fox, and one who will not be the victim of the gazes of the men who surround her. When Juliette, to avoid being sent back to the orphanage she came from, agrees to marry the nice, sweet, dorky Michel (Jean-Louis Trintignant), a priest warns him, “That girl is like an animal. She needs to be tamed.” But actually, there’s no taming what Bardot had: a casual freedom that was there in the way she held her body, and in every glance she gave.\n\n\tIf she was triumphantly brazen in “And God Created Woman,” in Jean-Luc Godard’s “Contempt” (1963) she broke the law of every film ever made about love. In movies, love and romance are the most powerful of religions, and when relationships fall apart it’s for all kinds of reasons. They break down, crack up, go bust. But in “Contempt,” Bardot plays Camille, the wife of a playwright (Michel Piccoli) who’s hired to rewrite the script for a film version of “The Odyssey,” and when the fire goes out of their marriage, it’s not for some tidy dramatic explanation. It’s because…she has decided…that the fire is gone…just because. Because in the newly modern world, where women are no longer under the thumb of men, their feelings might change, and the reasons for that might be…inaccessible to the man left holding the bag of their now-empty union.\n\t\n\n\tThe way Bardot plays this, uttering the word “contempt” (the feeling she now has for her husband) as a wall made of stone, she exudes a tragic matter-of-factness that resides on the other side of cruelty. It is cruel, but not because she’s cruel. It’s that life is cruel. And her beauty, in cinematic terms, is part of the cruelty; it’s part of what she will now withhold. Bardot portrayed all of this, in 1963, with what could be called the consciousness of the new woman. A new awareness of choice, and of how the old rules holding the world together no longer applied.\n\n\tDiscussing “Contempt,” male critics tend to get fixated on the film-industry woes of Piccoli’s screenwriter (a Godard surrogate), and the world-weary travails of the director Fritz Lang (playing himself). But the heart of the movie is the half-hour-long sequence in which Bardot and Piccoli wander around their apartment in Rome, having the kind of fight that sounds less like a movie fight and more like a real fight than almost any scene in movies you could name. The sequence suggests that if Godard hadn’t decided to go the route of being an allusive postmodern brainiac creator of prankster-troll cinematic puzzles-that-never-quite-fit-together, he could have been an extraordinary poet of emotional naturalism. And the coldly beating heart of the film, which is arguably Godard’s greatest, is Brigitte Bardot’s performance.      \n\n\tLooking back and watching Bardot’s movies now, you see hints and echoes of so many of the actresses who would come after her, from Maria Schneider to Nancy Allen to Dominique Sanda to Uma Thurman to Adèle Exarchopoulos to Sydney Sweeney. She was marketed as a pin-up, yet she was a singular presence who forged a path of sensual and spiritual fearlessness. And part of it is that she insisted, just as the Madonna of the ’80s and ’90s did, that for a certain kind of performer (her kind), sexuality was inseparable from artistry. Bardot’s eroticized projection of female identity was itself a transcendent performance. If God created woman, Bardot made you feel like she had created herself. Only time will tell if the future is female. But once she’d made her mark, the future was most definitely Bardot.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPaul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” “Sinners,” “Weapons,” “Frankenstein and “Wicked: For Good” led the 13th annual Make-Up Artists & Hair Stylists Guild Award nominations.\n\n\tThe films all three landed nominations apiece.\n\n\tThe makeup and hair team behind “One Battle After Another” was nominated in contemporary makeup and special makeup prosthetics. Arjen Tuiten, who was nominated in the latter category, used prosthetic pieces, contact lenses and dentures for Sean Penn’s Colonel Lockjaw in the film’s third act after he survives a horrific car crash.\n\t\n\n\tFor “Frankenstein,” Mike Hill, the film’s prosthetics artist, steered clear of the classic zombie, and used 42 prosthetic pieces to transform Jacob Elordi in Guillermo del Toro’s Creature.\n\n\n\tFrancis Hannon had her work cut out for her on “Wicked: For Good.” Aside from keeping Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba green, she had to work with Mark Coulier to transform Jonathan Bailey into the Scarecrow and Ethan Slater into the Tin Man. 11 pieces were applied to Slater’s face, including cheekbone prosthetics that changed his cheek line and additional pieces to alter his jawline. The process took four hours.\n\n\tOn “Weapons,” the team created prosthetics that unlocked the inner darkness that lurks behind her Aunt Gladys’ rimmed glasses. Amy Madigan’s look needed to be ferocious and needed to mirror an animal that was preying upon its victims.\n\n\tOther nominated teams include “Bugonia,” “Marty Supreme,” “Superman” and “Battle of a Small Player.”\n\n\tIt’s worth noting that “Frankenstein,” “Marty Supreme,” “One Battle after Another,” “Sinners,” “The Smashing Machine” and “Wicked: For Good” are the only films to match the Oscars shortlist.\n\t\n\n\tOn TV, there was a tie in the best contemporary make-up in a television series, limited or movie for TV, which resulted in six nominations.\n\n\tThe new and final season of Netflix’s “Stranger Things” landed a total of four nominations, including a nod in the commercial category for the Discover x “Stranger Things” ad.\n\n\tLady Gaga’s hairstylist, Sarah Tanno, was also nominated for her work on the “Abracadabra” music video.\n\n\tThe 13th Annual MUAHS Guild Awards is presented by L’Oréal Groupe and Giovanni Eco Chic Beauty.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\tDec 28, 2025 3:18pm PT\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRare Movie Ads From 120 Years of Variety: ‘Star Wars,’ ‘Chinatown,’ ‘Clueless,’ ‘The Matrix’ and More\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\tThe movie business grew up in the pages of Variety.\nThere is no more comprehensive chronicle of film history than Variety – hands down, no contest, case closed. This gallery backs up that bold statement by offering an array of amazing movie and movie-related advertisements drawn from Variety’s 120 years of covering entertainment and Hollywood.\nTruly, the pages presented here only scratch the surface of the jewels and historical artifacts in our voluminous archives. This is definitely not an exhaustively researched selection. These are but some of the fantastic finds that we came across while working this year on the 120th anniversary issue, published Dec. 10 in print and online.\nSome of these ads are for long-forgotten obscure titles, some are for classics like “King Kong,” “Casablanca,” “Sunset Boulevard,” “Dr. Strangelove,” “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,” “Chinatown,” “Star Wars,” “Platoon,” “Silence of the Lambs,” “Rushmore,” “The Matrix” and “The Talented Mr. Ripley.” Some are for movies produced far outside of the U.S.; as you’ll see, even the Soviet Union touted its Sovexport Film operation in Variety in the 1960s and ‘70s. Some of the pages presented here simply capture a moment in time.\nWe hope cineastes enjoy this trip through the past century of film as seen through the pages of New York-based Variety, which began publication in December 1905, and Los Angeles-based Daily Variety, which had a proud 80-year run as Hollywood’s hometown paper, published Monday-Friday from 1933 to 2013.\nAnd remember, when you need to know what the O.G. “Star Wars” grossed in its opening weekend in markets like St. Louis, Detroit and “Cincy” – now you know where to find a handy chart.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Wild Party (1929)\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe original “It” girl brought home the box office for Paramount with 1929’s “The Wild Party,” directed by Dorothy Arzner.\nAppropriate for its title, “The Wild Party” was one of the movies that spurred the industry’s adoption of the Hays Code a few years later to tame the debauchery depicted on screen.\nFrom the March 27, 1929, edition of Variety.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKing Kong (1933)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThis ad for 1933’s “King Kong” demonstrates how movie openings were typically platformed region by region.\nFrom the April 4, 1933, edition of Variety.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Kennel Murder Case / Lady Killer (1933)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWarner Bros. found a clever way to tout the high-profile stars in two of its top-tier pictures released in 1933: William Powell in “The Kennel Murder Case” and James Cagney in “Lady Killer.” \nFrom the Nov. 21, 1933, edition of Variety.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJezebel (1938)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t“Jezebel” is one of the reasons Bette Davis is Bette Davis.\nShe earned the second of her two best actress Oscar wins for the film directed by William Wyler. Davis lived large in our pages for most of her 81 years.\nFrom the Jan. 5, 1938, edition of Variety.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGirls on Probation (1938)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWarner Bros. made no bones about exploiting the public’s interest in true crime and tales of mayhem. “Girls on Probation” starred the future Oval Office occupant, Ronald Reagan.\nFrom the Nov. 2, 1938, edition of Variety.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tA Tragedy at Midnight (1942)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFilm noir, anyone? Great pop art style. And don’t forget to buy U.S. Defense Bonds.\nFrom the Feb. 24, 1942, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBambi (1942)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe forest, and animated movies, will never be the same. \nFrom the Oct. 9, 1942, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCasablanca (1942)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t“Casablanca” emerged as a massive wartime hit as Warner Bros. rolled it out slowly in theaters starting in late 1942.\nAs the Humphrey Bogart-Ingrid Bergman starrer prepared to move to bigger cities on the East Coast, Warner Bros. took out a cheeky ad depicting movie ushers getting ready to wrangle big crowds.\nFrom the Feb. 1, 1943, edition of Daily Variety.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHangmen Also Die! (1943)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe renowned German helmer Fritz Lang of “Metropolis” fame delivered a chilling contemporary story of surviving against the Gestapo in the film released under the title “Hangmen Also Die!” The screenplay was co-written by the celebrated German author Bertolt Brecht.\nFrom the Oct. 9, 1942, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tIt’s a Wonderful Life (1946)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tA hearty handshake and thank you to Frank Capra, Jimmy Stewart and everyone else who gave us the gift of “It’s a Wonderful Life.”\nFrom the April 15, 1946, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSunset Boulevard (1950)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tParamount didn’t exaggerate. We’ve never been able to forget Billy Wilder’s masterwork about fame, ego and aging.\nFrom the Aug. 2, 1950, edition of Variety.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDetective Story (1951)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEleanor Parker was a star on the rise in the early 1950s. “Detective Story” was a hit for director William Wyler. And how ’bout that vintage Paramount Pictures logo.\nFrom the March 4, 1952, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFrom Here to Eternity (1953)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBelieve the hype. Deborah Kerr — her last name rhymes with “star.”\nAnd yes, the plotline from “The Godfather” is true. This movie saved Johnny Fontaine — aka Frank Sinatra — when he was at a career crossroads.\nFrom the March 3, 1953, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPaths of Glory (1957)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThis was a breakthrough film for director Stanley Kubrick. It also fueled Kirk Douglas’ rise as a bona fide producer of serious pictures. \nFrom the Dec. 25, 1957, edition of Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMarty (1956)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThis movie will break your heart to bits and also make you understand why Paddy Chayefsky’s name still resonates today.\nIt’s a remake of a 1953 “Philco TV Playhouse” drama that starred Rod Stieger. That version will also break your heart into tiny pieces. For the big screen rendition, under the direction of Delbert Mann, Ernest Borgnine is never better than in this role as a lonely, insecure man who stumbles into happiness.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tApril Love (1957)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBecause who doesn’t want to see Pat Boone and Shirley Jones holding hands in glorious Cinemascope?\nFrom the Nov. 26, 1957, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe 400 Blows (1959)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPlease present your membership card.\nThis is one of the movies that made François Truffaut a household name among film lovers. Truffaut didn’t need a fancy full page ad to make his mark — this was a small notice placed low on an inside page.\nFrom the Feb. 9, 1960, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tElmer Gantry (1960)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSinners! Here’s how studios once teased upcoming releases. “Elmer Gantry” marks one of Burt Lancaster’s finest performances.\nFrom the June 20, 1960, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSmell-O-Vision (1960)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThis ad appears to be touting the latest enhancement to movies that some in the film biz championed in an effort to fight competition from television.\nSo while it sounds like a “Saturday Night Live” sketch, Smell-O-Vision was a real thing, at least for a moment. Michael Todd, Jr. was the son of the famed British producer who was married to Elizabeth Taylor and died in a plane crash in 1958.\nBefore his shocking death at age 50, the elder Todd produced 1956’s “Around the World in 80 Days,” which gets a nod in the low left-hand corner as “still going strong,” presumably in second-run theaters and outside the U.S. \nFrom the Jan. 6, 1960, edition of Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Night (1961)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMoreau, Mastroianni, Vitti and Antonioni — yes, please! \nFrom the Jan. 6, 1962, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWest Side Story (1961)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWhen you’re a Jet, you’re a Jet all the way. And when you’re a best picture nominee, you get a double-truck ad touting all those Oscar nominations.\nNot even Robert Wise nor Leonard Bernstein nor Stephen Sondheim could have imagined how much movie and musical fans would still love this property more than 60 years later. \nFrom the March 29, 1962, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Birds (1963)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWe’re scared already! Universal Pictures spared no expense to promote one of Alfred Hitchcock’s late masterpieces. This was the first of about 10 pages of ads touting every aspect of the production.\nFrom the April 11, 1963, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDr. Strangelove (1963)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tStanley Kubrick delivered a Cold War era satire with a pointed (Slim Pickens’ pointed) warning about the threat of nuclear devastation with his landmark “Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.” \nGentlemen — no fighting in the war room!\nFrom the Dec. 18, 1963 edition of Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDr. Strangelove (1963)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tColumbia Pictures really promoted the heck out of Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove” as an awards contender. It wound up with four nominations — for best picture, best director, best actor (Peter Sellers) and for adapted screenplay.\nFrom the Jan 22, 1965, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Sound of Music (1965)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe hills were alive with box office.\n“The Sound of Music” was the smash hit that helped right the ship at 20th Century Fox after the disaster that was 1963’s “Cleopatra.” With coin rolling in, the studio spared no expense to tout the film’s achievements in our pages.\nFrom the March 10, 1965, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBlow Up (1966)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMichelangelo Antonioni’s “Blow Up” is a slightly bizarre romp that captures its Swinging ’60s moment. Today, it would be released by A24.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Fortune Cookie (1966)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJack Lemmon plus Walter Matthau plus Billy Wilder plus I.A.L. Diamond equals a classic comedy that resonates today.\nFrom the March 24, 1967, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tA Man for All Seasons (1966)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAll hail the king and queen.\nAnd how about that long-forgotten tagline for Columbia Pictures: The total look in entertainment.\nFrom the March 24, 1967, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tA Man and a Woman (1966)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHeartbreak and longing never looked so sexy as it does in the hands of director Claude Lelouch and stars Anouk Aimée and Jean-Louis Trintignant.\nFrom the March 24, 1967, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBarefoot in the Park (1967)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tIt’s hard to find a better-looking pair than Robert Redford and Jane Fonda.

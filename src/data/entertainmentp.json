    "body": "<div><p>\n\tParis-based MMM Film Sales has picked up “Versailles,” from “Roma” and “Birds of Passage” producer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/pimienta-films/\">Pimienta Films</a> and its director Andrés Clariond Rangel’s Cinematográfica CR.</p>\n<p>\n\tIts trailer bows exclusively in <em>Variety</em> (below) ahead of its world premiere at Black Nights Film Festival in Tallinn, Estonia. A topical absurdist comedy about wanna-be autocrats, it melds cinematic realism with theatrical excess, drawing on such inspirations as “The Favourite,” “The Death of Stalin” and “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCo-written by Clariond Rangel and Alo Valenzuela, “Versailles” stars Cuauhtli Jiménez (“Finlandia,” “Narcos: Mexico”) in his first leading role and Spain’s Maggie Civantos (“Vis a Vis,” “Cable Girls”).\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt follows Chema (Jiménez), a young Mexican politician, who, when unceremoniously passed over by his party to run for president, retreats with his glamorous Spanish wife (Civantos) to their sprawling hacienda. Ever more frustrated, their lust for power chafes at them, and they reinvent themselves as monarchs—ruling over their employees with mounting harshness, delusion and indulgent excess.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I think there are many films about politics but not that many about the psychology of politicians and that’s what I wanted to do with this film,” Clariond Rangel told <em>Variety</em> as he sees “Versailles” as an exploration of how the loss of power and influence messes with politicians’ heads.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also gave him the chance to deal with his two biggest passions, cinema and politics. Aside from making films, he is a political columnist at Mexico’s leading newspaper, Reforma.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn casting Jiménez, he said: “I saw many actors, but I really liked him because he brought a sense of vulnerability to the role,” adding that most actors, when asked to play a politician, become very strident and outspoken but Jiménez showed a more human, vulnerable side instead.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VSL_STILL_008.jpeg 3840w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VSL_STILL_008.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VSL_STILL_008.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VSL_STILL_008.jpeg?resize=125,70 125w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VSL_STILL_008.jpeg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VSL_STILL_008.jpeg?resize=910,511 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VSL_STILL_008.jpeg?resize=681,383 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VSL_STILL_008.jpeg?resize=450,253 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VSL_STILL_008.jpeg?resize=250,140 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VSL_STILL_008.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“Versailles” (Courtesy of Pimienta Films)</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t“Versailles,” his third film, is also the first time that Clariond Rangel shoots in his hometown of Monterrey, where he cast most of his supporting actors, theater actors who make their feature film debut with “Versailles.” The film was mostly shot in the Hacienda Soledad, a cattle ranch dominated by an imposing formal mansion and manicured gardens.</p>\n<p>\n\tClariond Rangel likens “Versailles” to his debut pic, “Hilda.” They’re similar not in a political sense but in that they both deal with the themes of classicism and racism, he noted.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I worked with Andrés on ‘Hilda,’ which was one of my first films as a producer and also one of the first for Pimienta Films,” Pimienta founder, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nicolas-celis/\">Nicolas Celis</a>, said.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was a bold directorial debut because it managed to stand on its own without falling into straight comedy or drama, delivering a powerful, entertaining film full of dark humor and irony while also presenting a social critique,” he added, noting that it received several awards, particularly for the actresses, led by Adriana Paz.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Since 2021, Andrés has also been a partner at Pimienta Films, which reflects the trust and friendship we’ve built. I’m very excited to support him now with ‘Versailles,’ which I feel represents a step forward both in his career and in our collaboration,” Celis told <em>Variety.  </em></p>\n<p>\n\t“I feel that ‘Hilda’ laid the foundation for what is now a rising career. Andrés has a very particular taste for dark humor, for navigating that line between drama and genre, with uncomfortable themes and a sharp political perspective,” he remarked.</p>\n<p>\n\t“In ‘Versailles,’ he achieves something very interesting: an intimate story about the loss of power in a politician who is nothing without it. Set in a remote part of Mexico, it elegantly tackles deep-rooted issues in the country, such as classism and racism. It’s a film with a strong critical edge, filled with absurdity, irony and taking everything to the extreme,” added Celis, who shares producing credits with Mariela Martínez and Alejandro Durán.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBlack Nights takes place Nov. 7 – 23.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_0U2wl5plWU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>",

    "description": "<div><p>\n\tAt this year’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/sharjah-sheikha-jawaher-bint-abdullah-al-qasimi-1236535175/\">Sh",
    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAt this year’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/sharjah-sheikha-jawaher-bint-abdullah-al-qasimi-1236535175/\">Sharjah Intl. Film Festival for Children and Youth</a>, the next generation of Arab filmmakers isn’t waiting for permission to create. Armed with mobile phones, editing apps, and an evolving relationship with artificial intelligence, they’re redefining who gets to tell stories across the Middle East.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor 14-year-old Fajer Saeed Alyileili from the emirate of Fujairah, the journey began on Instagram. “I saw that there was a registration open for junior jurors for the Sharjah festival,” she recalls. “I just tapped on the link, and that was it.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tUsing only her phone and free apps, she makes short documentaries raising awareness about pollution in her hometown, as well as about scoliosis, drawing from her own experience with the condition. “I don’t need to spend a huge amount of money on professional equipment,” she remarks. “I can do it with my iPhone right now.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThrough apps like CapCut and AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Alyileili has found a digital mentor. “It helped me when I was stuck,” she explains. “I’d ask about angles, how to edit, or how to write a script. It’s like my assistant, but the ideas are still mine.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThat mix of autonomy and assistance defines a growing creative culture in the region. For Jordanian-Palestinian documentarian <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mohannad-abu-rizk/\">Mohannad Abu Rizk</a>, who built a large following online by chronicling human stories from the Arab world, technology has removed historic barriers. “Before, you had to go through gatekeepers like local television channels, where only the ideas that resonated with decisionmakers would be given space” he explains.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAbu Rizk remembers pitching local channels that rejected his work for being “too unconventional.” Today, his social-media projects reach millions globally. “We became one of the platforms that has even more views than those channels,” he notes. Still, he warns that digital freedom has its trade-offs: “Social media has its gatekeepers too — the algorithms. You can lose your creative voice if you start chasing trends.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThat tension between accessibility and authenticity also resonates with Lujain Mohamed Hassan, an 18-year-old media creator, medical student, and junior juror in the festival’s 12th edition. Specializing in advocacy and strategic communication, she sees AI and mobile tools as double-edged. “AI and mobile tools have certainly elevated the standards of content creation,” Hassan reflects, weighing their promise against their pitfalls. “But we’ve perhaps grown overly reliant on them. We risk losing the very essence of human creativity, the ability to think divergently, connect ideas, and create something truly original.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHassan uses AI only to outline and polish her ideas. “I view it as an aid or a guide, not a replacement,” she explains. “No algorithm can ever replicate the depth, emotion, and spontaneity of the human mind.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHer digital campaigns, focused on sexual and reproductive health and rights, have reached audiences far beyond what traditional filmmaking could. “There are numerous online workshops, video tutorials, and creative communities that young filmmakers can join to expand their skills and build meaningful connections,” she adds.</p>\n<p>\n\tCollaboration and cross-border storytelling are what keep this new generation of creators connected. “In the beginning, the internet was full of Western stories,” Abu Rizk recalls. “Now, amongst other subjects, I’m able to share narratives from Gaza, from the Amazigh in Egypt, stories even people in the region didn’t know existed.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Yassir Idrissi, a veteran Moroccan filmmaker whose short “Bottles” screened in Sharjah’s Arab shorts competition, the AI boom represents both opportunity and caution. “AI is a tool,” he points out. “It can help me reformulate a treatment or design a poster, but it can’t feel what I feel.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tA graduate of the Netherlands Film Academy, Idrissi still prefers the cinema to the phone screen. “Maybe I’m from the old generation,” he admits with a laugh, “but I think the place of a film is in theaters.” Nonetheless, he lauds Sharjah’s youth-driven programs. “Young filmmakers need mentorship, people to talk to, feedback on their scripts, guidance, and festivals like Sharjah are a great starting point.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThat culture of mentorship is woven throughout this year’s festival programming. Workshops such as Sony’s “Introduction to Content Creation” and Nikon’s “Editing Your Story” introduce participants to professional tools and workflows. The festival also spotlights the next generation of homegrown talent through initiatives like FANN, Sharjah’s youth media academy dedicated to nurturing young creators across film, photography and digital arts. One of its students, Khaled Alhammadi, led a session on content creation, guiding peers and young learners alike through creative ways to craft dynamic social media visuals using photography, video and editing techniques.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Put Yourself in a Movie With Waggish” lets students use AI to transform their favorite movie posters, enhancing colors and styles before refining them in Adobe Illustrator. The session was hosted by Waggish, a Sharjah-based design collective best known for its bold, pop-culture-infused sticker art and quirky Gen Z aesthetic, a homegrown brand that has become a creative touchstone for youth culture in the UAE.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, “Mixing Culture and Digital Media With Tamakan” brought art and tech together, teaching participants to design vibrant digital artworks using Procreate and Photoshop. Tamakan, a multidisciplinary design house and digital archive, explores how traditional culture and contemporary media intersect, a mission reflected in the workshop’s fusion of heritage and modern technique. Together, all of these sessions highlight how industry leaders and local creatives are bridging education, technology and cultural storytelling under one roof.</p>\n<p>\n\tBuilding on that ethos of learning by doing, Hassan reflects on how the festival’s interactive programs translate into real-world skills. “The festival empowers us by giving hands-on experience, from evaluating films to moderating screenings and Q & As with filmmakers and schoolchildren,” she emphasizes. “It encourages us to amplify our impact in digital and mobile storytelling across the region.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAs audiences scroll through TikTok and Instagram, the line between social content and cinema continues to blur. For these creators, that’s not a loss, it’s liberation.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The stories coming out of our region today,” says Abu Rizk, “are being told by people who finally have the freedom to tell them in their own language, with their own eyes, right on their own phones.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tLast year, HBO’s “True Detective: Night Country” embraced the eerie potential of the Alaskan wilderness as the backdrop of an absorbing mystery. Drawing on Native folklore, rural isolation and all-consuming Arctic darkness, director Issa López created a sense of place that was just as fundamental to the anthology series’ season as Jodie Foster’s star power. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe Apple TV+ thriller “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-last-frontier/\">The Last Frontier</a>” takes the same setting in a much goofier direction, if knowingly so. Where “Night Country” was all moody prestige, “The Last Frontier” is borderline camp, starting with the fiery CGI plane crash that unleashes dozens of convicts on the snowy jurisdiction of U.S. Marshal Frank Remnick (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jason-clarke/\">Jason Clarke</a>), who’s returned to his hometown of Fairbanks after a traumatizing few years in Chicago. The brainchild of “The Blacklist” creator Jon Bokenkamp and screenwriter Richard D’Ovidio, “The Last Frontier” is at its most enjoyable when it embraces its network TV roots, pitting a generically gruff family man against a veritable zombie horde of escaped criminals at a one-per-episode pace, like any good procedural. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, “The Last Frontier” saddles Frank with a co-protagonist in CIA operative Sidney Scofield (Haley Bennett), and itself with a cumbersome espionage plot that lacks the regional specificity or rapid clip of the primary story. Among the prisoners let loose in the Alaskan woods an agency asset codenamed “Havlock,” a man who’s turned against his handlers and is now deemed so dangerous he’s introduced hooded and handcuffed to his seat on the plane. This allows “The Last Frontier” to pull off an entertaining bait-and-switch, putting stunt veteran-turned-director Sam Hargrave in front of the camera as a bearded, wild-eyed inmate who certainly <em>seems </em>to be Havlock. (Hargrave helms a couple episodes, including the pilot he appears in.) Instead — mild spoilers for an episode that’s already available to stream — Sidney identifies Havlock as one Levi Hartman (Dominic Cooper), a man with ties to both our protagonists: Sidney recruited him, and he takes Frank’s wife Sarah (Simone Kessell), a nurse, hostage.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter that reveal, though, “The Last Frontier” gets bogged down in a serialized plot that’s more convoluted and generic than the simple pleasures of maniacs running amok and small-town cops chasing them down. Rather than using Sidney primarily for city-slicker contrast with Frank and his deputy Hutch (Dallas Goldtooth of “Reservation Dogs”), there’s far too much real estate given to her personal life and office politics. The babyfaced Bennett is unconvincing as a seasoned spy, and her chemistry with Cooper is almost nonexistent. The insanely overqualified Alfre Woodard and John Slattery play Sidney’s CIA superiors, though they’re physically isolated from the action in Langley and thus sparingly used. That leaves Sidney and Frank to piece together Havlock’s motive and master plan. Their endless prevarications over stolen databases, Russian hackers and exposing the deep state make the eyes glaze over.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut just in time, there’s usually a ridiculous action set piece involving snowmobiles, horses, helicopters or some combination thereof to make the viewer perk up and pay attention. (There’s a “Mission Impossible”-adjacent one involving a truck dangling over an icy cliff that’s a particular favorite.) Black widows, con women, demented doctors and even a guy going berserk in his underwear make for an engaging rogues’ gallery for Frank and his folksy colleagues to face down. In this context, Frank’s generically traumatized backstory and clumsily depicted marriage — in which Frank finally agrees to retire and open a cozy bed and breakfast with Sarah <em>just </em>before the chaos breaks out — are less impediments than part of the kitschy charm. It’s the show promised by the positively jaunty opening credits, so unusual for Apple’s typically sleek and tasteful stable of dramas.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Last Frontier” sadly puts this version of its premise further and further on the back burner as the 10-episode season goes on. The Sidney-Levi side of the proceedings is less interesting but more dominant, demonstrating a strange misunderstanding of the show’s appeal. The further “The Last Frontier” gets into the halls of power or Sidney’s past as the daughter of an agency legend — yes, she’s the CIA’s version of a nepo baby — the more you’ll wish we were back out on the frozen plain, hunting for murderous psychopaths as the elements do their worst.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The first two episodes of “The Last Frontier” are now streaming on Apple TV+, with remaining episodes airing weekly on Fridays.</em></p>\n</div>",

But it turns out that Season 2 of Gunn’s HBO Max series “Peacemaker,” which concluded on Thursday, provides an even more crucial launching pad for the overarching story Gunn aims to tell within the DCU, with the introduction of two major new elements to the franchise from the DC Comics: The covert agency Checkmate, and the metahuman prison planet Salvation.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tAs Gunn explained in a virtual press conference on Tuesday (which <em>Variety </em>moderated), Salvation will play a central role in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/superman-sequel-man-of-tomorrow-lex-luthor-team-up-1236514155/\">Gunn’s 2028 “Superman” sequel</a>, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/man-of-tomorrow/\">Man of Tomorrow</a>.” But both concepts will be narrative threads that will run through the entire DCU, including DC Studios’ next HBO Max series, “Lanterns.”</p>\n<div>\n<p>\n\t“It may not seem like it at first, but it is all very connected,” he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, Gunn has known he wanted to use Checkmate and Salvation for DC projects since before he and Safran were tapped to lead DC.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t“That was always pretty instrumental in the overarching story that I’m telling in the DCU,” he said. “I had mapped out what I thought the general story was, and two important aspects to that were Checkmate and especially Salvation.”\n</p>\n\t<h4>\n\t\tSo what <em>is</em> Checkmate and how is it introduced into the DCU? \t</h4>\n<p>\n\tIn the “Peacemaker” season finale, which Gunn wrote and directed, the 11th Street Kids rally to rescue their friend and titular superhero, aka Chris Smith (John Cena) — not from some nefarious evildoer, but from himself. As a consequence of his misadventures in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/peacemaker-lex-luthor-cameo-nazi-twist-no-superman-1236530679/\">the Nazi-drenched alternate universe Earth-X</a> in the previous episodes — in which he watched his father die in front of him, <em>again</em>, and nearly watched his brother die in front of him, <em>again</em> — Chris is convinced that he is, in his words, “the angel of fucking death.” He’s abandoned his home, cut himself off from his friends, and is wallowing in misery at a cheap motel.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter Adebayo (Danielle Brooks), Adrian (Freddie Stroma), Economos (Steve Agee) and Harcourt (Jennifer Holland) finally find him, however, they remind Chris that when he’s true to himself, he’s inspired all of them to be true to themselves — and it’s pretty much the only time any of them have felt they’ve done good in the world. So, led by Adebayo, they resolve to abandon the authorities that have led them astray, and build something together that can actually make people’s lives better, using the massive pallets of “blood money” Adrian’s stockpiled from fighting crime as Vigilante.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nhut-le-tim-meadows-freddie-stroma-danielle-brooks-john-cena-jennifer-holland.jpg 1800w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nhut-le-tim-meadows-freddie-stroma-danielle-brooks-john-cena-jennifer-holland.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nhut-le-tim-meadows-freddie-stroma-danielle-brooks-john-cena-jennifer-holland.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nhut-le-tim-meadows-freddie-stroma-danielle-brooks-john-cena-jennifer-holland.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nhut-le-tim-meadows-freddie-stroma-danielle-brooks-john-cena-jennifer-holland.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nhut-le-tim-meadows-freddie-stroma-danielle-brooks-john-cena-jennifer-holland.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nhut-le-tim-meadows-freddie-stroma-danielle-brooks-john-cena-jennifer-holland.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nhut-le-tim-meadows-freddie-stroma-danielle-brooks-john-cena-jennifer-holland.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nhut-le-tim-meadows-freddie-stroma-danielle-brooks-john-cena-jennifer-holland.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nhut-le-tim-meadows-freddie-stroma-danielle-brooks-john-cena-jennifer-holland.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>From left: Nhut Le, Tim Meadows, Freddie Stroma, Danielle Brooks, John Cena, and Jennifer Holland on “Peacemaker.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJessica Miglio/HBO Max\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tSo they found Checkmate, an independent, private crime-fighting agency that also includes Judomaster (Nhut Le) and disillusioned A.R.G.U.S. agents Fleury (Tim Meadows) and Bordeaux (Sol Rodriguez). Checkmate has a storied history in the DC Comics, first appearing in 1988 and populated mostly with DC’s anti-heroes; Peacemaker and Vigilante were early members, and Bordeaux has also been a prominent operative. (Other DC luminaries in Checkmate include Amanda Waller, Deadshot, Deathstroke, Huntress and Mister Terrific.)</p>\n<p>\n\tGunn said that he’d been a big fan of Checkmate in the comics and he “always wanted to build Checkmate into” the DCU. “It’s the real culmination of the 11th Street Kids and their desire to be good,” he said. Checkmate will remain “separate from the other institutions in the DCU,” he said. “I think they’re going to be really, really good at what they do. When we see them next, their circumstances will be a little bit different than the startup that they’re at now.”</p>\n\t<h4>\n\t\tWhat about Salvation?\t</h4>\n<p>\n\tElsewhere in the “Peacemaker” season finale, A.R.G.U.S. chief Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo) has deployed the agency to use Chris’ trans-dimensional portal to locate an alternate universe as close to the conditions of Earth as possible. After many failed attempts — and the loss of several lives via a flesh-eating-zombie universe and a demented-candyland-populated-with-carnivorous-imps universe — Harcourt and Bordeaux finally seem to find what they’re looking for. </p>\n<p>\n\t(When asked whether there was any alternative universe he wanted to visit but couldn’t, Gunn started laughing. “I wanted them to open the door and see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/deadpool/\">Deadpool</a> in a room,” he said, still giggling. “I talked to Ryan Reynolds about it. But I would’ve had to go through some pretty, pretty big hoops to do that. He wanted to do it!” He winced. “Oh, that’s all anybody’s gonna talk about now, is fucking Deadpool in the other room. I should’ve never said it!”)</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter the A.R.G.U.S. team find the ideal planet, they learn the true purpose behind their efforts: Flag wants to use the planet, which he names “Salvation,” as a prison for metahumans that are uncontainable on Earth — an idea that first appeared in DC Comics in the 2007–2008 limited series “Salvation Run.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I like the concept of creating this prison that was absolutely inescapable, but was also a little rash,” Gunn said. “Because they think it’s not dangerous from their initial tests. But in the comics and in this world, obviously there’s hints of it being dangerous.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sol-rodriguez-jennifer-holland-anissa-matlock.jpg 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sol-rodriguez-jennifer-holland-anissa-matlock.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sol-rodriguez-jennifer-holland-anissa-matlock.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sol-rodriguez-jennifer-holland-anissa-matlock.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sol-rodriguez-jennifer-holland-anissa-matlock.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sol-rodriguez-jennifer-holland-anissa-matlock.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sol-rodriguez-jennifer-holland-anissa-matlock.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sol-rodriguez-jennifer-holland-anissa-matlock.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sol-rodriguez-jennifer-holland-anissa-matlock.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sol-rodriguez-jennifer-holland-anissa-matlock.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>From left: Sol Rodriguez, Jennifer Holland, Anissa Matlock on “Peacemaker.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJessica Miglio/HBO Max\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tWhile “Salvation Run” included a cavalcade of DC villainy pitted against each other — driven by a rivalry between Lex Luthor and the Joker — Gunn warned fans not to expect the DCU version of Salvation to hew closely to the comics. </p>\n<p>\n\t“It really is about the concept,” he said. “The part that really spoke to me was the beginning of it, where Rick Flag Jr. and Amanda Waller [said], ‘Fuck it. Metahumans are a pain in the ass. They keep escaping. Let’s just get rid of them permanently.’ And of course, there are a bunch of repercussions about sending a bunch of bad guys to another dimension. In this case, kind of, you know, the sole person there right now is a good guy who has to survive on his own.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAh yes — the “Peacemaker” season finale ends on a huge cliffhanger, when Chris is kidnapped by Flag Sr., and tossed into Salvation as payback for Chris killing his son, Rick Flag Jr.</p>\n\t<h4>\n\t\tWhat does this mean for Season 3 of “Peacemaker”? \t</h4>\n<p>\n\tGunn indicated that as of now, he isn’t planning on bringing “Peacemaker” back for another season. “This is about the other stories in which this [cliffhanger] will play out,” he said. He was quick to add that he hasn’t ruled out a Season 3. “Never say never. But right now, this is about the future of the DCU.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tGunn was mum on whether that means Cena will be reprising Peacemaker in “Man of Tomorrow,” or even earlier in 2026’s “Supergirl.” But it was clear that audiences should expect to see much more of the character. For one, he’s key to Gunn’s plan to use the DCU to create “diamond properties out of the smaller characters” in the DC Comics canon to stand alongside Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut even more crucially, Peacemaker is “really important to me,” Gunn said. So much so that Gunn was moved to tears while talking about how the Season 2 opening credits song, “Oh Lord” by Foxy Shazam, related to the character.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I really love the character,” he said. “I could say about me, but I don’t really think it is. Chris is just incredibly human.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/john-cena_4.jpg 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/john-cena_4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/john-cena_4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/john-cena_4.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/john-cena_4.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/john-cena_4.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/john-cena_4.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/john-cena_4.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/john-cena_4.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/john-cena_4.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>John Cena in “Peacemaker.”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJessica Miglio/HBO Max\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tGunn first conceived of Peacemaker as “douchey Captain America” for his 2021 film “The Suicide Squad.” “He started out as a character who was the kind of guy that everybody calls morally reprehensible online every day,” he said. “I would have met Peacemaker at a party and gone, ‘Who is that fucking asshole over there?’”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd yet, Gunn has used “Peacemaker” to explore the same ideas about empathy and understanding that were at the forefront of “Superman.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“We live in this world where everybody thinks that the way to deal with people that think differently than you is to treat them like demons,” Gunn said. “What a fucking stupid idea. You want to change the world? You want the world to be a better place? You don’t do it by telling somebody they’re evil. It’s just not the way you do it.”</p>\n\t<h4>\n\t\tSo will “Man of Tomorrow” audiences need to watch Season 2 of “Peacemaker” to understand what’s happening?\t</h4>\n<p>\n\tAs far as Gunn is concerned, no. “I’m not expecting people to go into ‘Man of Tomorrow’ and know what Salvation is,” he said. “You’ll find out anything you need to know about metahumans disappearing through that movie.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, Gunn knows first hand from his time within the MCU with the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films that building out a cinematic universe is a tricky endeavor.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s a very, very, very delicate balance when writing these things,” he said. “You’ve got to be able to tell the story in a way where people that already know the information are not going to be bored, and where people who don’t know the information will get the information in an easy and simple way, but also not to be burdened down by too much shit. There needs to be an elegance to the storytelling. Too many mumbo jumbo things, to me, is always a thing that I [avoid]. ‘Oh, this magic stone does this and it’s that’ — there’s no emotional aspect to that. A prison in another dimension is easy for me to understand — and say in one sentence.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWith “Peacemaker” concluded (for now), Gunn will cede the spotlight to several upcoming DC projects in which he’s not the leading creative force, including “Lanterns,” “Supergirl,” “Clayface,” “The Batman 2.” But he made clear that he will continue to write and direct the DC projects that sit at the heart of the larger story within the DCU and involve Salvation, Superman, Lex Luthor and Rick Flag Sr.</p>\n<p>\n\t“That’s the plan right now, at least,” he said. “I may get so fucking tired that I can’t do it — because I’m pretty tired, but we’ll see!”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tCollective Media Network’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/historyverse/\">Historyverse</a> has released the first trailer for its artificial intelligence-powered version of the “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mahabharata/\">Mahabharata</a>,” giving viewers an initial glimpse at a technologically-driven retelling of the ancient Indian epic.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe preview of the series, titled “Mahabharat: Ek Dharmayudh,” highlights the production’s approach to merging classical narrative with contemporary tools. The project engaged Collective Artists Network’s Galleri5 studio, where creative teams used <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ai/\">AI</a> technology to construct the epic’s world and dramatize its legendary conflicts and ethical questions.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe revered text, which follows a devastating family feud and explores profound philosophical and spiritual ideas, has had numerous film and TV adaptations, including an immensely popular one on Indian state broadcasting channel Doordarshan and one by Peter Brook, which was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/artisans/festivals/mahabharata-8k-restoration-peter-brook-venice-1236129755/\">recently restored</a>. An <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/global/news/mahabharata-kurukshetra-netflix-india-animation-1236513842/\">animated retelling</a> is due on Netflix.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“For many of us, watching the ‘Mahabharat’ on TV was part of our childhood. Those Sunday mornings meant something special,” said Vijay Subramaniam, founder and group CEO of Collective Artists Network. “With ‘Mahabharat’ enabled by AI, we wanted to bring that memory back, but make it feel fresh, relevant, and made for this time. The trailer is only a small taste of what’s coming. It’s emotional, it’s big, and it’s built with care. We’ve tried to keep what made the story timeless while letting technology open new doors for how it can be told.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe venture pairs Collective’s Historyverse unit with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/prasar-bharati/\">Prasar Bharati</a>, India’s public broadcasting service, in what both parties describe as an unprecedented partnership between established media infrastructure and emerging production methods.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tGaurav Dwivedi, CEO of Prasar Bharati, said: “At Prasar Bharati, we’ve always believed in the power of stories that bring people together. The ‘Mahabharat’ enabled by AI is a wonderful example of how tradition and technology can work hand in hand. It’s exciting to see an epic like this being retold for the digital age while staying true to its roots. This is exactly the kind of innovation that keeps our cultural legacy alive for generations to come.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe series represents a test case for India’s digital production capabilities, aligning with government initiatives promoting local technology development.</p>\n<p>\n\tDistribution will split across two platforms with different formats. WAVES OTT will stream the series starting Oct. 25, in short-form episodes running 3-4 minutes each, totaling around 600 installments.</p>\n<p>\n\tDoordarshan will air longer 22-minute episodes beginning Nov. 2, in its Sunday 11am slot, with approximately 250 episodes planned. </p>\n<p>\n\tWAVES, which operates as Prasar Bharati’s streaming service, has built its audience through family-oriented programming across multiple Indian languages and now extends its reach internationally.</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the trailer here:</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mc6pjvAJVCU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>",

Doing it with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/no-doubt/\">No Doubt</a> feels like going back in time to relive our history, while also creating something new in a way we never could have imagined.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNo Doubt was one of the headline-grabbing performances from Coachella 2024 across both weekends, marking the first time the group performed together since 2015. The quartet followed the Coachella bookings with a performance at the FireAid benefit concert at Los Angeles’ Kia Forum earlier this January.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Sphere residency also marks the first time that a female-fronted act will headline the venue, as previous performers have included Dead & Co., U2, Eagles, Anyma and Backstreet Boys. It would be a return to the Strip for Stefani, who staged her own “Just a Girl: Las Vegas” residency at the Zappos Theater in 2018. Those shows were set to conclude in May 2020, but eight were postponed due to the pandemic and rescheduled for the following year.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for any indication of new No Doubt music, the band hasn’t signaled that they’ll head back to the studio to record the follow-up to their last album, 2012’s “Push and Shove.” During an interview with <a href=\"https://www.nylon.com/entertainment/gwen-stefani-no-doubt-coachella-cover\" target=\"_blank\">Nylon</a> following their Coachella performances, Stefani said that she’s “open to anything.” “Well, I don’t have a crystal ball,” she said. “Most things have surprised me in life. One of the things I’ve learned is to be present in the moment and try to absorb what’s happening around me instead of looking ahead.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"https://livemu.sc/nodoubt\" target=\"_blank\">Presale</a> for No Doubt’s Sphere residency begins on Oct. 15 at 10 a.m. PT.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tCANNES, France — <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sony-pictures-television/\">Sony Pictures Television</a> will bring to market at Cannes’ <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mipcom/\">Mipcom</a> the format “Trainer Games,” a fitness competition reality showdown from Nick Rigg’s Brass Monkeys Media which takes contestants, fitness freaks, to or beyond the limits of endurance.  </p>\n<p>\n\t“Trainer Games” is just one of the latest additions to SPT’s Mipcom slate, marking its return to Mipcom which is already drawing heat thanks to a string of first-look reveals and early sales deals on a powerful bevy of top scripted titles taking in “The Miniature Wife,” “S.W.A.T. Exiles” “Lord of the Flies,” “The Lady” and “Titanic Sinks Tonight.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the deal, Sky has acquired for the U.K. and Ireland “The Miniature Wife,”Sony Pictures TV’s highly anticipated relationship comedy-drama starring <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/elizabeth-banks/\">Elizabeth Banks</a> (“The Hunger Games”) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/matthew-macfadyen/\">Matthew Macfadyen</a> (“Succession”), ahead of Mipcom. The show will air on Sky and NOW in 2026.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn further unveils, “S.W.A.T.” spinoff “Exiles” dropped Thursday a first photo of Shemar Moore and new cast as filming starts in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso, the BBC has released first look images for “Lord of the Flies,” created by “Adolescence” co-creator <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jack-thorne/\">Jack Thorne</a>, no less, as well as new images from dramatised documentary “Titanic Sinks Tonight.”</p>\n<p>\n\tA Hollywood studio without its own streaming service, Sony should be one of the highest-profile players at Mipcom, thanks in part to its ambitions to sell on the open market not only titles from the companies it owns in international, such as the U.K.’s “The Crown” producer Left Bank Pictures and Eleven (“Sex Education”) as well as fr9m third party pick-ups.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThis year that profile looks to be ensured by a double whammy. Sony Pictures Television chairman Keith Le Goy will feature in Variety’s C-Suite Conversations block at Mipcom in Cannes, talking in a one-on-one interview with Cynthia Littleton, <em>Variety</em> co-Editor in Chief, on Monday, Oct. 13 at the Palais des Festivals.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe interview will be followed a couple of hours later on Monday by Mipcom’s exclusive opening night preview screening of “The Miniature Wife.” Stars Matthew Macfadyen, O-T Fagbenle and Sian Clifford will be on hand for a post-screening Q&A.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>What SPT is Bringing to the Market in Unscripted and From Latin America </strong></p>\n<p>\n\tA young-ish unscripted vet, Nick Rigg, whose Brass Monkeys Media holds down an overall deal with Sony Pictures Television, is best known for lifestyle hits such as “House Hunters International” and, capturing the Zeitgeist, “Tiny House Nation.” “Trainer Games,” unannounced to date, looks like something of a departure. A fitness reality contest where these strongest and fastest runners don’t take all, images released by SPT show one contestant surveying the sea perched high on a cliff, another three runners high-fiving as they reach a mountain summit.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? Hot Seat” will also be introduced to global clients, following recent news in the U.K., where a version from SPT-backed Stellify Media has been commissioned by ITV, and from Australia, where Curio Pictures, also a SPT company, is preparing a revamp.     </p>\n<p>\n\tSPT will also showcase “Shark Tank Creators Version,” a reimagining of the business format.</p>\n<p>\n\tSPT Latam will introduce one of the region’s weightier scripted propositions, “Carlota,” with an all-star Spanish-language key cast, and gameshow “Piensa Rápido,” hosted by comedian Adrían Uribe.  </p>\n<p>\n\t“Our current lineup of series is packed with storytelling at its finest. We truly have something for everyone and every audience. We’re looking forward to sharing these stories with our friends and clients from across the industry and all around the world next week,” said Mike Wald and Jason Spivak, Co-Presidents, Distribution & Networks, Sony Pictures Television.</p>\n<p>\n\tA closer look at titles:   \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Top Titles, Sony Pictures Television Scripted: </strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“The Miniature Wife”</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tEpisodes: 10 </p>\n<p>\n\tProduced by Media Res for Peacock (US); Distributed by Sony Pictures Television</p>\n<p>\n\tRights Available: WW excluding U.S.</p>\n<p>\n\tProduced by Media Res (“The Morning Show,” “Pachinko”) and a dramedy examining power imbalances between spouses Lindy and Les, played by Banks and Macfadyen  who battle each other for supremacy following a technological accident in which Les accidentally shrinks Lindy.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tRIO DE JANEIRO, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/brazil/\">Brazil</a> – One of the most eagerly anticipated series of recent years in Brazil, Prime Video’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/tremembe/\">Tremembé</a>” had a buzzy world premiere at a packed screening at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rio-film-festival/\">Rio Film Festival</a> on a rainy Wednesday night. The five-episode series, which will drop globally on the major streaming platform on Oct. 31, trails life in the infamous titular prison, which houses some of Brazil’s most well-known criminals. It continues a major international push for the South American country, which took three series to this year’s Berlinale Series and is landing heavily at this year’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mipcom/\">Mipcom</a>.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLast year, Prime Video Brazil began dipping its toes on true crime with “The Park Maniac,” about one of the country’s most infamous serial killers. “Tremembé” marks a full steam ahead moment for the streamer’s bet on an authentic Brazilian take on the subgenre. Lauded writer-director Vera Egito (“He, She, They,” “Elis”) signs the artistic direction of the series, which is based on the biographical books by journalist Ulisses Campbell, also one of the series’ writers alongside Egito, Juliana Rosenthal, Thays Berbe and Maria Isabel Iorio. Paranoid produces the series.

Here, Barbosa plays Suzane Von Richthofen, convicted for the heavily publicized, brutal murder of her parents.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking with <em>Variety </em>out of the Rio Film Festival premiere, Barbosa says she finds it “wonderful” to have the “opportunity to talk about our Brazilian projects and have this international reach for our national audiovisual sector. I feel a lot of pride at the moment.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I was very excited when ‘Tremembé’ became a possibility because it is the type of project that feeds me as an actor, to have this challenge to dive into strangeness,” she adds. After decades working on telenovelas, which are demanding, fast-paced open works, the actor emphasizes how interesting she found it to dedicate herself to a closed work like a series. “It grants you a certain calmness. You have more time to study and prepare, plus a longer period to work with your director, too.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen asked about the international visibility of working with a streamer like Amazon, the actor recalls being surprised by how many people knew her abroad from telenovelas sold to foreign territories. “I always found it incredible that I could reach someone in India through my novela characters. Now, the impact is much, much bigger. The series will travel internationally, and I think it has a level of quality that will make it appealing abroad. True crime is a popular genre and I think it is an interesting opportunity in terms of digging into the psychological fabric of a character, so I think this is a turning point in my career.”</p>\n<p>\n\tJulia Priolli, head of scripted for Amazon MGM Studios, Brazil, recognizes the international potential of “Tremembé” but says the content was conceived through a strategy they call “hyperlocal.”</p>\n<p>\n\t”We wanted the series to work completely inside the country and win national audiences,” she adds. “We believe that, from that home-ground victory, the series can work anywhere. ‘Tremembé’ benefits from the fact that it tells stories very familiar to Brazilian audiences. These stories are deeply ingrained within the national cultural consciousness.” As for premiering the series in Rio in a festival environment, Priolli says it’s a “joy and an honor” as well as part of a strategy the streamer began investing in a few years ago, premiering “Cangaço Novo” in Gramado and “Love is For the Strong” in Rio.</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestioned about the potential of a “Tremembé” franchise, given that the prison houses dozens more infamous criminals. Priolli says they are “very focused” on how the first season performs. “We are so excited about the release and understand that the public reception of the series will allow us to think a little bit more in these terms.” \n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TREM_ElencoGrade_8838.jpg 4422w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TREM_ElencoGrade_8838.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TREM_ElencoGrade_8838.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TREM_ElencoGrade_8838.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TREM_ElencoGrade_8838.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TREM_ElencoGrade_8838.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TREM_ElencoGrade_8838.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TREM_ElencoGrade_8838.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TREM_ElencoGrade_8838.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TREM_ElencoGrade_8838.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TREM_ElencoGrade_8838.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Courtesy of Prime Video Brazil</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tFitting so many different notorious characters and stories in five episodes proved “extremely complex” to Egito, who spent two years writing the series alongside her collaborators. She calls the process “very intense” and a “gigantic puzzle to solve.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“We never took for granted that the audience would be familiar with their stories,” she emphasizes. “These are all convicted criminals, so we are not questioning whether they did it or not. The important thing to us was to show their day-to-day. When you begin zooming into their troubles and loves and lives within the prison, there is a danger that the viewer might forget who these people are, so we wanted to begin with a haunting image of their crimes to then cut to the prison.”</p>\n<p>\n\tEgito highlights it was “very important” to Amazon and the entire creative team not to “further expose the victims.” “A lot of their family members are still alive today. We created a camera concept where we don’t expose the victims. You don’t see anyone injured. The challenge was to keep the tension of the scene while protecting the victims, and I am incredibly proud to say I think we achieved that.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOn contributing to the outstanding momentum for Brazil’s audiovisual industry, Priolli says the environment in the country is “very fertile” and Prime Video is “seizing it entirely.” “We are very excited about the work we’ve been doing. Brazil is so diverse, and the cultural richness of the country is so unique. ‘Tremembé’ is a very particular series. There is no other prison in the world like it. It could only happen in Brazil.” Egito echoes that thought: “You see the success novelas have reached globally. I want to drink from that popular fountain with a cinematographic look. It seems to me like a recipe for success.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBarbosa brings up Fernanda Torres and Wagner Moura, who are making history in terms of international projection with Walter Salles’ “I’m Still Here” and Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent.” “Seeing Fernanda shining abroad and now Wagner following in her footsteps is so beautiful. I think more than ever we need to value and cherish what is ours, so we can show the U.S. and the rest of the world that we, too, can make incredible films and television. It’s incredible to have opportunities abroad, but to be celebrated internationally because of something produced here, in our language, is very powerful.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters” continues to rack up the accolades.\n\n\tThe film’s song “Golden” was honored by the American Cinematheque Tribute to the Arts for best original song. Songwriters EJAE and Mark Sonnenblick accepted the award. EJAE got emotional as she told the audience what songwriting meant to her. She called the song “a beautiful accident.”\n\n\t“I thought I was gonna be a KPop Idol, but that didn’t happen. But in my mid-20s, when I had to give up my dream to be a singer, I met a couple of KPop producers.” She explained how they asked her if she wanted to write a track, and she did – about going through a breakup with her ex. “What’s so weird was, after I was done, it weirdly helped me deal with the breakup better than talking to my girlfriends. Every melody, every word, had intent and expressed my emotion to its purest form.” \n\t\n\n\tEJAE, who, along with Sonnenblick, won the Golden Globe and Critics Choice awards for best original song. EJAE talked about writing “Golden” and how she had her character, Rumi, in mind. “The character was a fictional character, but the emotion was raw and very real. I think we all know how it feels to really crave for hope when it feels very hopeless, and it truly did help bring light in a very dark time in my life, actually to the point where I cried while singing the demo.”\n\n\tSince the movie’s release and success, she has been flooded with messages from fans sharing what the songs mean to them. “The most received message I got was verbatim the sentence, ‘Your song ‘Golden’ saved me,’ and that is exactly the reason why you’re write.”\n\t\n\n\n\tProduction designer Jack Fisk, who has never won an Oscar, was honored with the Career Achievement Award. His wife, Sissy Spacek, presented him with the award.\n\n\tFisk, whose credits include “Badlands,” “Mulholland Drive,” “The Revenant” and “Marty Supreme,” recalled being best friends with David Lynch. He said, “In 1970, just out of art school, my best friend David Lynch and I drove to Los Angeles from Philadelphia in a rented U-Haul truck. He was going to the new American Film Institute, and I was looking for a job. I found one – on a non-union film for $100 a week. – It was holding traffic while the film company was shooting in a house about a quarter mile away. I was curious to be closer to the set, so I could see what’s going on. Then I found out that there was an art department on most films, and that became my goal – to get into the Art Department.” He also worked with Lynch on “The Straight Story.”\n\n\tFisk thanked Spacek and also shared how the two first met. “I met Terrence Malick, who was directing his first feature film, and he introduced me to a girl from Texas, Sissy Spacek, who would star in it. In 1972, Terry, Sissy, Martin Sheen, and a crew of 35 began filming ‘Badlands,’ and my life was changed forever.”\n\n\tHe said he had no career regrets after five decades in the industry. “As my friend David often said: “The Art Life – it’s a great Life!”\n\n\t“Sinners” casting director Francine Maisler took time to thank the organization for “recognizing the pivotal role that casting plays.” The Academy Awards will recognize casting for the first time at next month’s ceremony.\n\n\t”One Battle after Another” editor Andy Jurgensen called director Paul Thomas Anderson “an extraordinary mentor and collaborator.” Jurgensen added, “He’s taught me to go against convention, to be inventive, to let an audience know it’s okay to laugh, to embrace mistakes and imperfections, and maybe most of all, when to know not to cut.”\n\n\tThe following are the Tribute to the Crafts honorees:\n\n\tCasting: “Sinners” (Francine Maisler) – Warner Bros.

    "body": "\n\tMatt Damon and Ben Affleck recently appeared on the “Joe Rogan Experience” to promote their new Netflix film “The Rip,” and the long-time friends and collaborators shared their thoughts on how the streamer is changing the way movies are made. \n\n\tDamon pointed out that because viewers give a “very different level of attention” to a movie at home versus in a theater, Netflix wants to push the action set pieces toward the front of the film. He also said there are behind-the-scenes discussions about reiterating “the plot three or four times in the dialogue” to account for people being on their phones.\n\t\n\n\t“The standard way to make an action movie that we learned was, you usually have three set pieces. One in the first act, one in the second, one in the third,” Damon explained. “You spend most of your money on that one in the third act. That’s your finale. And now they’re like, ‘Can we get a big one in the first five minutes? We want people to stay. And it wouldn’t be terrible if you reiterated the plot three or four times in the dialogue because people are on their phones while they’re watching.’”\n\n\n\tAffleck then cut in, adding that the streamer formula for successful content isn’t the only way. He used Netflix’s recent limited series hit “Adolescence” as a shining example.\n\n\t“But then you look at ‘Adolescence,’ and it didn’t do any of that shit,” Affleck said. “And it’s fucking great. And it’s dark too. It’s tragic and intense. [It’s about] this guy who finds out his kid is accused of murder. There are long shots of the back of their heads. They get in the car, nobody says anything.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile Damon thought shows like “Adolescence” are “the exception,” Affleck said he felt the show “demonstrates you don’t have to do” the Netflix tricks to please audiences.\n\n\tWatch the entire “Joe Rogan Experience” episode with Damon and Affleck here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNia DaCosta’s “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” ended the four-week reign of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” and claimed the top spot at the domestic box office on Friday.\n\n\t“The Bone Temple,” the sequel to last summer’s “28 Years Later” and the fourth film in Sony’s long-running zombie franchise, grossed $5.6 million on its opening day from 3,506 North American theaters. The horror-thriller is expected to add $15 million through the four-day Martin Luther King Jr. holiday frame. The last installment, helmed by “28 Days Later” director Danny Boyle, opened to $30 million over a traditional three-day frame, and ended its run with $70 million in the States and $150 million worldwide. That film cost $60 million, and “The Bone Temple” was slightly more expensive to produce at $63 million.\n\t\n\n\tFranchise mastermind Alex Garland penned the screenplay for “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple,” which follows Ralph Fiennes, Jack O’Connell and Alfie Williams as they navigate the British countryside and fight off the deadly Rage Virus. The film has received rave reviews from critics and an “A-” from audience pollster CinemaScore, a rare feat in the horror genre.\n\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” landed at No. 2 with $3.2 million on its fifth Friday in North American theaters. James Cameron’s third trip to Pandora looks to add an estimated $17 million through the MLK frame. Domestic gross should hit about $367 million by Monday. Although “Fire and Ash’s” box office crown is lost for now, the film is expected to extend its winning streak through the weekend and notch a fifth week and No. 1. The first “Avatar” and its sequel “The Way of Water” were both No. 1 at the box office for seven consecutive weeks.\n\t\n\n\tElsewhere at the domestic box office, Chloé Zhao’s Shakespearean drama “Hamnet” expanded to 718 North American locations after several weeks in limited release. The film earned $13 million during its initial rollout and added another $370,000 on Friday. “Hamnet” should pull in $1.6 million through MLK Day.\n\n\tLionsgate’s thriller “The Housemaid” added $2.5 million on Friday for a third-place finish. Domestic earnings should hit $109 million through the holiday frame, an impressive feat considering it cost just $35 million to produce. A sequel is already in the works with star Sydney Sweeney and director Paul Feig returning.\n\n\tParamount’s monkey horror “Primate” landed in sixth during its second Friday in North American theaters, hauling in another $1.4 million. The film opened solidly last weekend with $13.4 million worldwide against a $21 million budget. The domestic total should reach $6.2 million by Monday.\n\n\tRounding out the top five are several holdovers from the holiday season: “Marty Supreme” and “Zootopia 2.” Disney’s “Zootopia 2” landed at No. 4 with $1.9 million domestically on Friday. The film is exhibiting astounding staying power, considering it was released in November. Rival estimates project a four-day gross of $12 million through MLK Day, which would raise the North American tally to $393 million. A24’s “Marty Supreme” took fifth with an estimated $1.6 million domestic. Total domestic gross should hit about $80 million by Monday.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRian Johnson took to X on Friday night to shut down a claim from former Lucasfilm boss Kathleen Kennedy that he was “spooked by the online negativity” and never returned to the “Star Wars” franchise after helming “The Last Jedi.”\n\n\tIn response to a post from IGN aggregating the news, he wrote, “Lol zero spooked, sorry.”\n\n\tAfter 2017’s “The Last Jedi,” Johnson was set to develop another “Star Wars” trilogy. However, the project never got off the ground, and he instead shifted his focus to starting the “Knives Out” franchise.\n\t\n\n\tIn her exit interview with Deadline, Kennedy shared her side of the story on why Johnson never returned. While she did acknowledge that “Knives Out” ate up “a huge amount of his time,” she also claimed he got “a little scared” by the fan backlash to “The Last Jedi” and decided to step away from the project.\n\n\t“I do believe he got spooked by the online negativity,” Kennedy said. “I think Rian made one of the best ‘Star Wars’ movies. He’s a brilliant filmmaker and he got spooked. This is the rough part. When people come into this space, I have every filmmaker and actors say to me, ‘What’s going to happen?’ They’re a little scared.”\n\n\tSitting down with Rolling Stone last summer, Johnson said the trilogy never made it deep into development and was “all very conceptual.” He explained that before any real progress could be made, “’Knives Out’ happened” and the “Star Wars” project fizzled out.\n\n\t“Nothing really happened with it,” Johnson said. “We had a great time working together, and they said, ‘Let’s keep doing it.’ I said, ‘Great!’ I would kick ideas around with Kathy. The short version is ‘Knives Out’ happened. I went off and made ‘Knives Out,’ and was off to the races, busy making murder mysteries. It’s the sort of thing if, down the line, there’s an opportunity to do it, or do something else in ‘Star Wars,’ I would be thrilled. But right now I’m just doing my own stuff, and pretty happy.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s raining pilot orders at NBC.\n\n\tThe network will take a chance on two new drama projects, titled “Puzzled” and “What the Dead Know.” This caps off a week in which NBC announced six pilot orders for the 2026 season.\n\n\tFrom “Charmed” and “Sleepy Hollow” writer Joey Falco, “Puzzled” is based on the “Puzzle Master” books by Danielle Trussoni. “After barely escaping a tragic fire, once promising college athlete Mike Brink is transformed by a traumatic brain injury that gives him the unique ability to see the world in an unexpected way and helps him solve crimes with local police,” according to the logline. Jordan Cerf executive produces alongside Falco, and Trussoni is a producer. The studio is Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group.\n\t\n\n\tLegendary “Law & Order” creator Dick Wolf serves as an executive producer on the other pilot, “What the Dead Know,” from Beth Rinehart (“FBI: Most Wanted,” “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit”). The series is based on the memoir by former New York City medical examiner Barbara Butcher. Per the logline: “Death Investigator Ava Ledger is really good with dead bodies. It’s the living that give her trouble.” The show follows Ava as she teams up with the NYPD to solve their toughest cases. The executive producers include Tom Thayer, Peter Jankowski and Anastasia Puglisi; Co-EPs are Kevin Plunkett, Rebecca McGill and Butcher. Wolf Entertainment produces, and Universal Television is the studio.\n\n\n\tEarlier on Friday, NBC announced a pilot order for a detective comedy from “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” co-creator Dan Goor and executive producer Luke Del Tredici. On Thursday, the network announced a drama pilot from Dean Georgaris and John Fox, inspired by the real-life FBI research of Dr. Ann Burgess. And earlier this week, the network announced a drama pilot order from Josh Safran, Jenna Bush Hager and Ben Spector called “Protection,” about a family of law enforcement agents becoming the target of a mysterious assassin. Plus, NBC gave a pilot order to a “contemporary update” on “The Rockford Files” from Mike Daniels (“Sons of Anarchy”).\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 38th European Film Awards, which is taking place today in Berlin, was opened by Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who spoke about the terrible bloodshed and oppression in his homeland, and the importance of speaking out. \n\n\t“When the truth is crushed in one place, freedom suffocates everywhere,” he said. “Then no one is safe anywhere in the world. Not in Iran. Not in Europe. Not in America. Not anywhere on this planet. And that is precisely why today our task as filmmakers and artists is harder than ever. If we are disappointed with politicians, we must at least refuse to remain silent. Because silence in a time of crime is not neutrality. Silence is a participation in darkness.”\n\t\n\n\tWith that said, he declared the 38th edition of the awards open.\n\n\n\tDuring the ceremony, the European Lifetime Achievement Award was received by Norwegian acting legend Liv Ullmann, who used her speech to make a controversial point about the Nobel Prize. On Thursday, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who was awarded the prize last year, gifted her peace prize medal to Donald Trump.\n\n\t“I’m Norwegian,” Ullmann said. “We gave a Nobel Prize to somebody who deserved it, and suddenly that Nobel Prize is going to someone else … It is so strange. And that is why I’m happy, specifically now, because I know that in Norway we have laws that say: If you misuse a Nobel Prize, we take it away from you. So, somebody in the United States may be very disappointed. He will lose it. He just got it.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLiv Ullmann accepted the European Lifetime Achievement Award from Juliette Binoche\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Getty\n\t\n\n\n\n\tVariety is bringing you the winners live here. The livestream can be found at www.europeanfilmawards.eu.\n\t\n\n\tThe actor award, which was fought over by Sergi López for “Sirāt,” Mads Mikkelsen for “The Last Viking,” Toni Servillo for “La Grazia,” Stellan Skarsgård for “Sentimental Value,” and Idan Weiss for “Franz,” went to Skarsgård.\n\n\tThe statuette for best European actress was picked up by Renate Reinsve for “Sentimental Value.” “Somebody give me a slap,” the Norwegian actress said, echoing a line from the film. She added, “This is a movie about a father and daughter relationship, and two sisters, and I want to say to my two sisters, Helen and Cecilia, that I am the older sister but you were the ones taking care of me when we were growing up, and thank you so much, I wouldn’t have been anywhere without you.” The other nominees were Leonie Benesch for “Late Shift,” Valeria Bruni Tedeschi for “Duse,” Léa Drucker for “Case 137,” and Vicky Krieps for “Love Me Tender.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRenate Reinsve\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Getty\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe screenwriter award went to Eskil Vogt and Joachim Trier for “Sentimental Value.” The other contenders were Santiago Fillol and Laxe for “Sirāt,” Panahi for “It Was Just an Accident,” Schilinski and Louise Peter for “Sound of Falling,” and Paolo Sorrentino for “La Grazia.” \n\n\tThe animated feature film award was won by “Arco,” whose producers include Natalie Portman. The other nominees were Ugo Bienvenu’s “Arco,” Raitis Ābele and Lauris Ābele’s “Dog of God,” Maïlys Vallade and Liane-Cho Han’s “Little Amelie,” Irene Iborra Rizo’s “Olivia and the Invisible Earthquake,” and David Súkup, Patrik Pašš, Leon Vidmar and Jean-Claude Rozec’s “Tales From the Magic Garden.” \n\n\tThe Discovery Award, given to a director for their first full-length feature film, went to “On Falling.” The other nominees were Urška Djukić’s “Little Trouble Girls,” Akinola Davies Jr.’s “My Father’s Shadow,” Laura Carreira’s “On Falling,” Murat Fıratoğlu’s “One of Those Days When Hemme Dies,” Mathias Broe’s “Sauna,” and Mara Tamkovich’s “Under the Grey Sky.” \n\n\t“Siblings” won the European Young Audience Award. The other nominees were Ugo Bienvenu’s “Arco,” Nóra Lakos’ “I Accidentally Wrote a Book” and Greta Scarano’s “Siblings.” \n\n\tAt the nominations stage, “Sentimental Value” led the race with five nominations, while “Sirāt” followed with four, and “Sound of Falling” and “It Was Just an Accident” tied with three each. \n\t\n\n\tThe best film nominees include narrative features “It Was Just an Accident,” “Sentimental Value,” “Sirāt,” “Sound of Falling” and “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” as well as documentaries “Afternoons of Solitude,” “Fiume O Morte!,” “Riefenstahl,” “Songs of Slow Burning Earth” and “With Hasan in Gaza,” and animated films “Arco,” “Dog of God,” “Little Amelie,” “Olivia and the Invisible Earthquake” and “Tales From the Magic Garden.”\n\n\tThe director nominees are Yorgos Lanthimos for “Bugonia,” Oliver Laxe for “Sirāt,” Panahi for “It Was Just an Accident,” Mascha Schilinski for “Sound of Falling,” and Joachim Trier for “Sentimental Value.”\n\n\tBest documentary contenders are Albert Serra’s “Afternoons of Solitude,” Igor Bezinović’s “Fiume O Morte!,” Andres Veiel’s “Riefenstahl,” Olha Zhurba’s “Songs of Slow Burning Earth,” and Kamal Aljafari’s “With Hasan in Gaza.”\n\n\tOther awards to be presented on Saturday include those for cinematography, editing, production design, costume design, make-up and hair, original score, sound designer, casting director and visual effects.

    "body": "\n\tThere’s an exorcism scheduled at the box office for spring 2027. \n\n\tMike Flanagan‘s “The Exorcist” movie, starring Oscar nominee Scarlett Johansson and “Hamnet” breakout Jacobi Jupe, is dated for March 12, 2027, Universal announced Friday. The film was once expected to hit theaters this March, but production was delayed.\n\n\tFlanagan (“The Fall of the House of Usher,” “Doctor Sleep,” The Life of Chuck”) is writing, directing and producing the newest installment for Universal and Blumhouse-Atomic Monster, which has been described as a “radical new take” on the iconic horror property. \n\t\n\n\tThe original “Exorcist,” directed by William Friedkin, follows a mother (Ellen Burstyn) who hires two Catholic priests to perform an exorcism on her demonically possessed 12-year-old (Linda Blair). Released in 1973, the film was a critical and commercial hit, grossing $441 million globally and garnering 10 Oscar nominations. \n\n\tIn 2021, Universal spent a staggering $400 million to buy the rights for a new “Exorcist” trilogy. 2023’s “The Exorcist: Believer” brought back Burstyn as Chris MacNeil, earning $136 million at the global box office. Flanagan’s film will be set in the same universe as the 1973 film; however, it is not a sequel to “Believer.”\n\n\t“The Exorcist” is produced by David Robinson, Jason Blum and Flanagan. Alexandra Magistro and Ryan Turek serve as executive producers. The movie is a Blumhouse-Atomic Monster and Morgan Creek Entertainment production, in association with Flanagan’s Red Room Pictures.\n\n\tThis film marks the fourth collaboration for Flanagan and Blumhouse; he wrote and directed 2013’s “Oculus,” 2016’s “Hush” and 2016’s “Ouija: Origin of Evil.” Flanagan’s latest film, 2024’s “The Life of Chuck,” won the TIFF audience award.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat began as a panel with key cast members to discuss the jaw-dropping second season of “Palm Royale” turned into a star-studded surprise tribute to celebrate Carol Burnett’s final appearance on the Apple TV series,\n\n\tFollowing a special screening of the show’s Season 2 finale on Thursday at the Wolf Theater in North Hollywood, Vince Gilligan, Rhea Seehorn, Bob Odenkirk, Charlize Theron, Jane Lynch and Bob Mackie made unexpected appearances as Yvette Nicole Brown, who moderated the event, asked if anyone in the audience had any questions for the “Palm Royale” cast as the lights turned on. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAbe Sylvia, Carol Burnett and Kristen Wiig \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I can’t believe you’re here!” said Burnett when she saw Gilligan, who she worked with on “Better Call Saul.” Keeping the reunion going, Seehorn stood up and asked Burnett, “How do you become a legend?” (“You live to be 93,” Burnett laughed, to raucous applause.) \n\n\n\tOdenkirk also quipped about acting alongside Burnett in the show: “What was it like working with Carol? Now, you must know that I know the answer to this question,” he said. “She’s always on time and I was late. That made me look bad and she doesn’t count her lines. I do, which I consider the actor’s first job, count your lines. Make sure you have the most,” the actor joked. \n\n\tJane Lynch, who worked with Burnett on “Glee,” said, “Your sublime performance in what we just watched up on this enormous screen reminds all of us of the love that we have for you. We couldn’t adore you more.” \n\n\tAfter hailing Burnett as “so much more than a legend,” Theron said, “You’re just a fucking broad.” Theron also shared a fun fact: “Did you know that I play Wordle with Carol Burnett? And she’s a fucking cheat.” \n\t\n\n\t“You can’t cheat at Wordle!”  Burnett proclaimed. Even Michelle Obama made a virtual appearance to mark the occasion, sending her congratulations to the icon. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBernadette Peters \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBernadette Peters closed the evening with an emotional rendition of “I’m So Glad We Had This Time Together,” fittingly finishing her performance with Burnett’s classic ear tug. \n\n\tOn “Palm Royale,” Burnett played Norma Dellacorte, a central figure in the lives of the ladies of Palm Beach. But Burnett became a Hollywood fixture long before she stepped into the role — the star is perhaps best known for “The Carol Burnett Show,” which ran for 11 seasons from 1967 to 1978. Previously, Burnett told Variety that “Palm Royale” would likely be her last acting job as she began to retire from being onscreen. “Probably,” she said, before adding, “Unless there’s a cameo or something fun!” \n\n\tBefore the panel turned into a celebration of Burnett, the legendary actress talked about playing Norma. “When [Abe Sylvia] called me, he said, ‘We’re going to do this show and we’d love you to be in it.’ I said, ‘Well, who’s in it?’ He said, ‘Kristen Wiig, Allison Janney, Leslie Bibb, Laura Dern, Ricky [Martin].’ I said, ‘Stop. I’m in. I don’t care what you want me to do. I want to lock eyeballs with all of these people,’” she recalled. “We had a great time and now I’ve got all these new young friends. It’s wonderful.” \n\n\t“Palm Royale” creator Sylvia and cast members Wiig, Martin, Bibb, Mindy Cohn, Julia Duffy, Amber Chardae Robinson and Josh Lucas also joined the panel to discuss their experiences working on the season. \n\n\tSee more photos from the night below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMindy Cohn and Rhea Seehorn \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRicky Martin \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnthony Davis and Yvette Nicole Brown \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKristen Wiig \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBob Odenkirk \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJane Lynch, Bob Mackie, Carol Burnett, Charlize Theron, Bob Odenkirk, Rhea Seehorn and Vince Gilligan \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCharlize Theron and Kristen Wiig \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n",

He was previously arrested for DUI in 2013.\n      \n    \n          In 2015, Odom nearly died of an overdose ... and his wife, Khloé Kardashian, rushed to his side to nurse him back to health. Their relationship ended not long after Odom relapsed in 2016.\n      \n    \n          Odom -- who played for four teams across a 14-year NBA career -- committed himself to sobriety in recent years ... and even offered help to others struggling with addiction, like Bam Margera, via several rehabilitation centers he owns.\n      \n    \n          We broke down all of Odom's struggles in our documentary \"TMZ Presents: Lamar Odom: Sex, Drugs, & Kardashians\" ... now available to stream on YouTube.\n      \n    \n          Story developing ...\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                The Kardashians\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Prosecutors say she committed the crimes between November 2023 and March 2024.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          She has a court hearing scheduled for February 18, but has not been arrested as of this reporting. TMZ has reached out to Leida and the prosecuting attorney for comment ... so far, no word back.\n      \n\n          These aren't the first felony charges against Leida ... Wisconsin filed 2 counts of identity theft against her back in September 2025 and a count of bail jumping in July. She was additionally charged with mistreating animals, domestic abuse and bail jumping in January of last year.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          As you know, she is also estranged from her husband Eric Rosenbrook -- the pair had a notoriously tumultuous relationship on \"90 Day Fiancé.\" She even filed to legally separate from Eric last year ... but swiftly asked the court to dismiss her petition.\n      \n    \n          We broke the story in July 2025 that Eric was arrested for allegedly slapping his fellow TLC star while drunk ... and he confirmed at the time they were no longer together.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to him regarding the latest charges against Leida ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Absolutely not, man,” Dickerson said. “Why can’t we get somebody from right here, from home? How about someone from right here in San Francisco? All these artists right here in the area to play at the Super Bowl.”\n      \n    \n          Dickerson also questioned whether a Spanish-language performance would resonate with American audiences.\n      \n    \n          “He speaks English,” Dickerson said. “I don’t know if it’s going to be in Spanish or whatever. What sense does that make?”\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    Joy Of Everything\n          \n    \n          The former Rams star then waded deeper into controversy … saying he doesn’t view Puerto Rico the same as the mainland U.S., though he insisted he has nothing against the island itself.\n      \n    \n          Dickerson wasn't done swinging.\n      \n    \n          He also blasted the league’s diversity efforts -- calling the Rooney Rule “a freaking joke” and arguing Black coaches still aren’t getting fair shots at top jobs.\n      \n    \n          “You can’t make a person hire a Black coach,” Dickerson said. “Owners are going to do what they want to do. You feel comfortable with who looks like you sometimes. That’s just it.”\n      \n    \n          ED also went after the league.\n      \n    \n          “They’ll do anything for money,” he said. “As an entity, the NFL is one of the most corrupt organizations there is.”\n      \n    \n          To summarize, the NFL legend ain't backing down ... at all!\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Eric Dickerson\n              \n                          \n                Bad Bunny\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Officials say his probation officer was alerted after his alcohol-monitoring ankle device reportedly showed a high reading on New Year's Day.\n      \n    \n          The prosecutor also says he failed to perform his community service at the required rate of 3 hours per month for several months.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The probation violation report claims Mahomes Sr. later submitted urine tests on Jan. 5 and Jan. 9, and both reportedly came back negative for alcohol.\n      \n    \n          Still, it looks like prosecutors are moving forward with the violation claim … and a judge will ultimately decide whether Mahomes Sr. will have his probation revoked and potentially end up behind bars..\n      \n    \n        \n                    \n                      2/3/24\n                  \n      \n    \n          As we previously reported, Mahomes has been arrested for DWI at least three times -- the most recent coming days before the Super Bowl in 2024, which his son's Chiefs competed in and won over the San Francisco 49ers.\n      \n    \n          He’s scheduled to appear in court on March 9, when he’ll have the chance to fight the allegations and try to stay out of prison. The judge ordered him to remain in the Smith County Jail until the hearing.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Patrick Mahomes Sr.\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Arrests\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Drugs & Alcohol\n              \n                          \n                MLB\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

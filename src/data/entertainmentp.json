    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe George Michael estate thanked <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift/\">Taylor Swift</a> on Thursday for interpolating the English record producer’s 1987 hit “Father Figure” into her highly anticipated 12th studio album, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-life-of-a-showgirl/\">The Life of a Showgirl</a>.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“We were delighted when Taylor Swift and her team approached us earlier this year about incorporating an interpolation of George Michael’s classic song ‘Father Figure’ into a brand new song of the same title to be featured on her forthcoming album,” read a statement posted to the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1330606618431613&set=a.262338898591729\" target=\"_blank\">George Michael Facebook page</a>. “When we heard the track we had no hesitation in agreeing to this association between two great artists and we know George would have felt the same. George Michael Entertainment wishes Taylor every success with ‘The Life of a Showgirl’ and ‘Father Figure.'”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Life of a Showgirl,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/taylor-swift-announces-album-the-life-of-a-showgirl-1236487135/\">first revealed</a> back in August, is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/taylor-swift-the-life-of-a-showgirl-release-date-tracklist-1236488000/\">set to debut on Oct. 3</a> and features fellow pop sensation Sabrina Carpenter on the title track. Typical of Swift’s musical catalog, the album will be available in multiple variants, including “The Life of a Showgirl: Sweat and Vanilla Perfume” edition in glitter orange vinyl, as well as “The Life of a Showgirl: The Crowd Is Your King” edition sold <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/taylor-swift-target-vinyl-exclusive-life-showgirl-1236528210/\">exclusively at Target</a>. The record will also be available in CD and cassette formats.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring her “New Heights” interview, Swift said “The Life of a Showgirl” was inspired by the joy she felt while performing on her Eras Tour.</p>\n<p>\n\t“This album is about what was going on behind the scenes of my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,” she said. “It just comes from the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life, and so that effervesence has come through on this record.”</p>\n</div>",

The series is meant to give fans of the stars a rare look inside the world of two of the most private former bandmates and is expected to include intimate conversations between the pair on life, love, loss and fatherhood. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe show will be directed by Nicola Marsh (“Song Exploder,” “Stay on Board: The Leo Baker Story”)<br />Produced by Campfire Studios (“Unknown Number: The High School Catfish”; “Smartless: On the Road”; and “America’s Sweethearts: The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders”). \n</p>\n<p>\n\tBoth artists have had a busy year as individual solo acts, and are teeing up for an even busier 2026.

I genuinely wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope it comes through in the music. I’m still learning and getting better as a singer and a songwriter. I find it impossible to be complacent; it’s not in my vocabulary.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nbcuniversal/\">NBCUniversal</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/google/\">Google</a> have reached a mulityear distribution agreement to keep NBC and NBCU’s suite of other networks on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/youtube-tv/\">YouTube TV</a>. </p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the current NBCU slate, under YouTube TV deal renewal, the streaming service will carry the newly relaunched NBC Sports Network (NBCSN). NBCU said that the new NBCSN, to launch later this fall, “will complement the prominent sports properties presented year-round on the NBC broadcast network.” The company had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/nbcsn-shut-down-sports-tv-usa-1234890506/\">previously shut down NBCSN in 2021</a>.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe deal announcement Thursday came after the companies’ previous agreement expired Sept. 30; the parties reached a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nbcu-youtube-tv-deal-extension-avert-blackout-1236535142/\">short-term extension to hammer out final details</a>. YouTube TV is the U.S.’s biggest internet pay-TV service, with an estimated 9.5 million customers as of the end of 2024, according to research firm MoffettNathanson.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe agreement continues YouTube TV’s carriage of NBCUniversal’s full portfolio of networks, including NBC, Bravo, CNBC, Golf Channel, E!, Oxygen True Crime, MSNBC, USA, Syfy, Telemundo and Universo. The company’s cable networks (excluding Bravo) will be part of the Versant spin-off, a transaction expected to close by the end of 2025.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition, the NBCU-Google deal calls for Peacock to be available in the coming months as a subscription through YouTube Primetime Channels, the platform’s third-party subscription offering (which is independent of YouTube TV). The companies also entered into a multiyear extension of Peacock’s availability across Google’s Android platforms, including Google Play and Google TV.</p>\n<p>\n\tSeparately, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/univision-goes-dark-on-youtube-tv-blackout-televisaunivision-1236535360/\">YouTube TV dropped Univision and other TelevisaUnivision-owned networks</a> on Tuesday evening, after Google and the Hispanic media giant failed to reach terms on a carriage renewal. Their previous agreement also expired on Sept. 30.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Our new agreement with Google is a clear win for both our business and our viewers — underscoring the enduring value of our must-see shows, films, sports, and live events while expanding our reach to even more audiences,” Matt Schnaars, NBCU’s president of platform distribution and partnerships, said in a statement. “We’ve secured long-term access to our full portfolio of broadcast and cable networks on YouTube TV, and we’re advancing our Peacock strategy with an upcoming launch on YouTube Primetime Channels and ongoing presence on Google TV. This agreement positions us for continued growth and reflects our commitment to delivering exceptional entertainment to fans across platforms.”</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin Connolly, VP, global head of media and sports at YouTube, commented: “This deal builds on our long-standing partnership with NBCU while addressing the evolving media landscape and recognizing the importance of making content available where and how viewers want to watch it. We are pleased to have reached this agreement and look forward to continuing our partnership to serve billions of viewers around the world.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOther elements of the NBCU-Google deal include:</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>A long-term agreement for short-form clips, highlights and shows from NBCU’s premium programming on YouTube; and</li>\n<li>An extension of the agreement making Universal Pictures Home Entertainment films and TV shows available to buy or rent on Google TV, YouTube TV and YouTube, as well as library films from NBCUniversal Global TV Distribution being available to stream via subscription VOD on YouTube Premium and ad-supported VOD through YouTube Free Primetime Content.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kesha-2/\">Kesha</a></strong> has signed with <strong>Mary Hilliard Harrington</strong> and<strong> Red Light</strong> management for representation. Harrington’s roster also includes country artists Dierks Bentley and the Grammy-winning rock duo, the Black Keys.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe move came just as Kesha wrapped her “Tits Out Tour,” which saw her performing in arenas and amphitheaters across the country. The tour will continue internationally next year with stops in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the UK in February and March. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tKesha launched her own independent record label, aptly named <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/music/news/kesha-finally-free-millions-dollars-litigation-dr-luke-1236076250/\">Kesha Records</a>, and in partnership with Warner Music Group’s independent distribution arm ADA.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t+ <strong>MASS MoCA </strong>and <strong>Hen House Studios </strong>have launched a new record label, <strong>MASS MoCA Records.</strong> With a framework that centers artistic creativity, museum residencies and live music making, this new label will provide an alternative to the current commercial model for how independent music is heard, developed and shared.</p>\n<p>\n\tMASS MoCA Records is uniquely designed to build on the museum’s international reach and entrusted relationships with performing artists — musicians, stage-based storytellers, and sound and sonic installation creators — by marrying the expertise of Harlan Steinberger of Hen House Studios (Sunny War, Willie Nelson, Particle Kid), who is best known for his uncommonly attuned ear as a recording engineer and producer specializing in live, studio recordings. </p>\n<p>\n\tArtists selected for the new label will be an extension of the museum’s curatorial ethos and the label will not have a scheduled application process. Launched as a three-year pilot, a limited number of albums will be released each year and produced at various recording studios in the Berkshires and throughout the world.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“MASS MoCA Records is a recording and distribution collaboration born out of our shared love of music and the artists who make it,” said Kristy Edmunds, Director of MASS MoCA. “We have a long-standing, live presenting program at the museum featuring musicians, performers and sound artists, and have supported the creation of new works and ambitious ideas since our inception. By joining forces with Hen House Studios and being able to tap into the remarkable number of music studios and intimate venues in the local area – the ingredients for a hand-made record label were all around us. I see this label as an extension of how we innovate to support the mobility of artists’ ideas and connect audiences the world over.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first band to sign with MASS MoCA Records is the Kasambwe Brothers, a multi-generational band who has been making music together for almost 40 years and are grounded in the rich, musical heritage of Malawi, Africa. </p>\n<p>\n\tMore releases will follow in 2026 from MASS MoCA Records, recording predominately in-person in the Berkshires under Steinberger’s stewardship, including cutting-edge Los Angeles jazz artists Black Nile (release date TBA). </p>\n<p>\n\t+ <strong>Songtrust</strong>, a Downtown company and global music publishing administration service, announces the launch of <strong>Songtrust Amplified</strong>, a new rewards program designed to elevate career opportunities for music creators at every stage of their journey.</p>\n<p>\n\tAvailable to all active clients, Songtrust Amplified offers exclusive access to discounts, curated resources, and industry opportunities beyond traditional publishing — strengthening the path to success for independent songwriters and rights holders worldwide. </p>\n<p>\n\tSitting in Downtown’s Publishing Division, Songtrust Amplified also represents an extension of the Downtown group’s continued mission, building a more equitable music ecosystem through services that empower creators to control their careers and maximize their potential.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m thrilled to celebrate the launch of Songtrust Amplified as a new chapter in our journey — one that resonates deeply with my own path here at Downtown,” said Emily Stephenson, President of Downtown Music Publishing. “Beginning on the Songtrust operations team, I witnessed firsthand the power of access, transparency, and education in shaping a songwriter’s career. Since then, Songtrust has grown into the industry’s most sophisticated, creator-friendly platform, and Songtrust Amplified will further strengthen our commitment to empowering creators and growing alongside our clients.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCaitlin Stubner, VP of Songtrust commented, “Songwriters often tell us how isolating the industry can feel. We built Songtrust Amplified for them, with no strings attached. We are their trusted partner for global publishing and now, we can support more parts of their creative journey while building community. Amplified also recognizes that publishing is just one chapter of a creator’s story. Through thoughtful collaborations that open doors to distribution, promotion, mentorship, and more, we’re offering the tools and opportunities that help music creators do what they do best—make music.”</p>\n<p>\n\t+ RIAA-Certified Gold a cappella group<strong> Straight No Chaser </strong>has signed to boutique record label <strong>Green Hill Music</strong>. The lifestyle music imprint will release the group’s upcoming holiday album, “Holiday Road,” Straight No Chaser’s first full-length holiday release in five years.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We are thrilled to welcome these music veterans to the Green Hill family,” said Green Hill Music General Manager Blake Davis. “Their unmatched musicality, dynamic a cappella artistry, and signature humor bring something truly unique and captivating to today’s musical landscape. This Christmas album blends timeless classics with fresh favorites, showcasing why they were among the pioneers of the all–a cappella style. It’s a release destined to become a holiday favorite for listeners of all generations. Straight No Chaser truly knows how to put on a performance to remember.”</p>\n<p>\n\tStraight No Chaser member Walter Chase said, “Our group’s catalog of songs cover everything from 1950s doo wop to what’s on the radio today. Partnering with Green Hill Music, a label known for its legacy of iconic vocal music, is a perfect match for Straight No Chaser.

Latimer will oversee the full suite of offerings that OVG employs at its own venues and offers to partners at iconic venues throughout the world, including management, hospitality, security, parking, sustainability consulting, and premium experiences.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I am thrilled to welcome Amy to the OVG Family.

Warner Chappell and Warner Music have always been at the pinnacle of support for songwriters and other music creators, and that reality is still very evident in the current leadership and staff. My sincere thanks go to all of them.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Rock and Roll Hall of Famer is slated to release his first solo album in more than two decades,” Too Late to Be Cool,” on Oct. 10. Most recently, Leadon was a headliner at the AmericanaFest in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>\n<p>\n\tWCM’s Guy Moot, Co-Chair and CEO, and Carianne Marshall, Co-Chair and COO, said: “It’s no exaggeration to say that much of the music we call Americana today owes a deep debt to Bernie’s boundary-crossing inspiration. He has helped shape a canon of iconic music, from his early years with genre-defying groups like The Flying Burrito Brothers and Dillard & Clark to his generation-defining work with the Eagles to his countless collaborations with other artists. His creativity, musical brilliance, and pure devotion to his craft have made him a true American treasure, with six decades of extraordinary songs and sounds to his credit. We’re honored and excited to welcome him into the Warner Chappell family.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tGreg Sowders, SVP, A&R and Catalog, WCM added: “As a master musician, songwriter and member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Bernie inspired me to start my first real band. And now as his music publisher, I continue to be inspired by his writing and playing, particularly by his new album Too Late To Be Cool. His legend continues.”</p>\n<p>\n\t+ <strong>A2IM</strong> (The American Association of Independent Music), today announces that <strong>Ian Harrison </strong>has been appointed as chief executive officer effective Oct. 1. Harrison succeeds Dr. Richard James Burgess, who will step down at the end of this year. </p>\n<p>\n\tHarrison brings more than 20 years of leadership in the independent music sector, most recently as executive VP of Hopeless Records. Over two decades, he helped transform the label from a small independent into a globally recognized powerhouse. His work as part of the Hopeless Foundation (Sub City) has raised over 3.5 million dollars for a variety of music and mental health charities.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to his label leadership, Harrison has been a longstanding contributor to A2IM and the broader indie community. He has been actively involved with A2IM since 2012 as an Indie Week committee member, five-time speaker and mentor. </p>\n<p>\n\t“The independent community is stronger and more dynamic than ever, yet also facing accelerating challenges that will test our resilience and adaptability. A2IM exists to ensure our members can grow independently in the face of these changes and thrive on their own terms.</p>\n<p>\n\t+ <strong>Carlos “Charly” Pérez</strong> has announced the launch of <strong>Studio VII</strong>, his new firm specializing in communications, public relations, entertainment, as well as the production of experiences and events. The project launches alongside an active strategic alliance with Warner Music Latina, focused on developing new talent and strengthening the company’s artist roster. This collaboration remains non-exclusive, allowing room for new opportunities and partnerships.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe firm is based in the United States, Puerto Rico and is also operating across Mexico, the rest of Latin America and Spain. Studio VII supports artists, brands, and cultural projects from concept to execution, delivering high-impact campaigns, customized events and strategic activations in key markets. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Studio VII represents a new professional chapter that allows me to continue developing projects through an independent structure, while maintaining my collaboration with Warner Music Latina on strategic initiatives,” said Pérez. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t+ <strong>Communities In Schools of Tennessee </strong>(CISTN) today recognized <strong>Creative Artists Agency</strong> (CAA) and the <strong>Scarlett Family Foundation</strong> for their long-standing support at its “All in For Kids” fundraising breakfast.</p>\n<p>\n\tCAA, the world’s leading entertainment and sports agency, received the “All in For Kids Award,” which recognizes a CISTN supporter or organization that has generously given time and resources to significantly advance the nonprofit’s mission to ensure all students have the support they need to succeed in school and in life. John Huie, music agent and founding partner of CAA Nashville, accepted the award on behalf of the agency.</p>\n<p>\n\t“20 years ago, our CAA Nashville founders not only recognized but acted upon the importance of leading and providing support for initiatives aimed at creating a more resilient and equitable public education system in Nashville,” said Colby Gallahar, manager, CAA Foundation. “Through our partnership with CISTN, we remain committed to volunteering time and resources to ensure students are provided with the best education possible, protecting their dreams of becoming future community leaders, educators, first responders, and more!”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Scarlett Family Foundation was recognized with the Alice Chapman Advocacy Award, named in honor of the leadership and legacy of the late Alice Chapman, a member of CISTN’s founding task force who went on to serve as chair of the board.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/brendan-carr/\">Brendan Carr</a>, the Trump-appointed chairman of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fcc/\">FCC</a>, agreed to appear before the Senate Commerce Committee to testify about the events that led to ABC’s temporary suspension of late-night host <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tCarr, in comments on a conservative podcast prior to Kimmel’s benching, had threatened to investigate claims of “news distortion” against ABC affiliates unless they took Kimmel off the air, implying the FCC could pull their broadcast licenses.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNo date has been set for Carr’s appearance yet, a spokesperson for the Senate Commerce Committee told <em>Variety</em>. According to a report by <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/10/01/2025/carr-to-testify-before-cruzs-commerce-committee-in-wake-of-kimmel-flap\" target=\"_blank\">Semafor</a>, which first reported the news, the committee is expecting the hearing to be held in November but that the date could move later. The FCC’s two other commissioners, Republican Olivia Trusty and Democratic appointee Anna Gomez, are also expected to appear at the hearing.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) chairs the Senate Commerce Committee. Two weeks ago, Cruz criticized Carr’s comments about Kimmel, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/ted-cruz-fcc-jimmy-kimmel-brendan-carr-1236524620/\">comparing the FCC chairman to a “mafioso,”</a> and said it set a bad precedent for ensuring free speech for conservatives.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe controversy started after Kimmel, on the Sept. 15 episode of his ABC show, said that the “MAGA gang” was trying to “characterize” the alleged killer of Charlie Kirk “as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” On Sept. 17, Disney-owned ABC suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” after Carr threatened to take action against local affiliates over the remark, which he called “some of the sickest conduct possible.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the podcast of conservative commentator Benny Johnson, Carr said: “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” Shortly afterward, two large ABC station groups — Sinclair and Nexstar — said they were preempting Kimmel’s show (and Sinclair specifically thanked Carr for his remarks). Carr celebrated the news about ABC’s suspension of Kimmel, sending a CNN reporter a GIF of “The Office’s” Michael Scott and Dwight Schrute making “raise the roof” gestures.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast week, Carr <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fcc-chairman-brendan-carr-downplays-role-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-1236526391/\">downplayed</a> his role in Kimmel’s suspension, saying that he never threatened to revoke broadcasters’ licenses and that Nexstar and Sinclair opted to preempt the show of their own accord. Carr said his comment that “We can do this the easy way or the hard way” was a hypothetical point about what the FCC might do if there was a “news distortion” complaint filed against Kimmel and ABC and that Democrats had engaged in “distortion and projection” over his comments.</p>\n<p>\n\t“What I’ve been very clear in the context of the Kimmel episode is the FCC and myself in particular have expressed no view on the ultimate merits [of a ‘news distortion’ complaint about Kimmel] had something like that been filed what our take would be one way or the other,” Carr said Sept. 22 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fcc-chairman-brendan-carr-downplays-role-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-1236526391/\">at the 2025 Concordia Annual Summit in New York</a>. </p>\n<p>\n\tCruz, on his podcast “Verdict with Ted Cruz,” said he “hates what Kimmel said” and that he was “thrilled that he was fired.” (Kimmel was not “fired.”) However, Cruz said about Carr’s threats to broadcasters, “That will end up bad for conservatives. There will come a time when a Democrat wins again, wins the White House. They will get rid of everything America that’s conservative. They’ll get rid of every podcast. They’ll get rid of everything. They will silence us. They will use this power and they will use it ruthlessly and that is dangerous.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter ABC announced the suspension of Kimmel, Gomez, the FCC’s lone Democratic commissioner, suggested Carr was exploiting Kirk’s assassination “as justification for broader censorship and control.” “This Administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression,” she wrote in a post on X. “And it is doing so not because speech glorifies violence or breaks the law, but because it challenges those in power or reflects views they oppose. We must stand firm against every attempt to silence dissent, punish satirists and government critics, and erode individual liberty.” When Disney reinstated Kimmel, Gomez <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fcc-democrat-disney-jimmy-kimmel-reinstatement-1236526572/\">said</a>, “I am glad to see Disney find its courage in the face of clear government intimidation.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, last week Sen. Adam Schiff (D-California) and eight other senators <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/politics/news/adam-schiff-brendan-carr-fcc-kimmel-1236527374/\">sent a letter to Carr posing a series of questions about the Kimmel episode</a>. They wrote that Carr’s remarks, along with President Trump’s lawsuits against media organizations and the defunding of public broadcasting, “represent the most blatant and coordinated attack on the free press in American history.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The FCC’s regulatory authority over broadcast licenses was never intended to serve as a weapon to silence criticism or punish satirical commentary,” Schiff and the other senators wrote. “Your agency’s mission is to serve the public interest, not to act as an enforcement arm for political retribution against media outlets that displease those in power.” The letter asked Carr to disclose any communications between the FCC and ABC, Disney or its affiliates about the Kimmel show, as well as any communications with the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tA separate group of senators, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), sent a letter to the CEOs of Nexstar and Sinclair asking them to explain their decisions to preempt “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”, including whether Nexstar’s decision had anything to do with its pending $6.2 billion merger with Tegna, for which it needs FCC approval. </p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-fully-back-abc-tv-nexstar-sinclair-1236530517/\">Sinclair and Nexstar announced Sept. 26 that they were ending their preemption of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”</a> and would immediately begin airing the show on their ABC affiliates. Both companies claimed their decisions were independent of any government influence or communications. Sinclair and Nexstar also both asserted that they were justified in originally deciding to preempt Kimmel’s show.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>RELATED: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-sinclair-jimmy-kimmel-networks-affiliates-battle-1236537252/\">How the ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ Flap Exposed The Growing Conflicts Between the Networks and Their Affiliates</a></strong></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tChris Dreja, a musician, photographer and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member who was a co-founder of the pioneering British rock band the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/yardbirds/\">Yardbirds</a> and a co-writer of many of that band’s songs, has died, according to social media posts from his sister-in-law and his former bandmate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-page/\">Jimmy Page</a>. He was 79.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tWhile <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2003/music/reviews/yardbirds-1200541248/\">the Yardbirds</a> never achieved the same level of fame as contemporaries like the Rolling Stones, the band had an enormous influence on several generations of rock musicians and is best known for having Eric Clapton, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/music/news/jeff-beck-guitarist-dead-dies-1235486491/\">Jeff Beck</a> and Jimmy Page in its lead guitarist role between 1963 and its dissolution in 1968. Dreja — pictured above, second from left, with the group in 1967 — was originally the band’s rhythm guitarist and shifted over to bass after Page joined in 1966. He was invited to join Led Zeppelin but declined, opting to pursue a career as a photographer instead. He shot the <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/master/4126-Led-Zeppelin-Led-Zeppelin/image/SW1hZ2U6ODQwMDYwMzI=\" target=\"_blank\">band photo on the back cover of Led Zeppelin’s first album</a>.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBorn Christopher Walenty Dreja in 1945 to Polish immigrant parents, Dreja grew up in Kingston Upon Thames and was bitten by the rock and roll bug as a teenager. His brother was a classmate of original Yardbirds lead guitarist Anthony “Top” Topham in a pre-college art program; Chris and Topham met and played together in an early rock band. In 1963 the two joined forces with singer Keith Relf, bassist Paul Samwell-Smith and drummer Jim McCarty as the Metropolitan Blues Quartet and soon renamed themselves the Yardbirds. Topham left just weeks later and was replaced by Clapton, whose fiery playing boosted the band’s reputation as they worked the London club circuit. Later in 1963, they took over the Rolling Stones’ residency at London’s legendary Crawdaddy club.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile the band’s lively early blues-rock sets are captured on the 1964 album “Five Live Yardbirds,” recorded at London’d Marquee Club, the group shifted into a more pop direction with its first hit, “For Your Love,” and a disenchanted Clapton left the band to play bluesier material with John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers. The Yardbirds originally approached Page, who was enjoying a lucrative career playing sessions, but he declined and instead recommended his longtime friend Beck.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe ensuing era was the group’s most commercially successful, as Beck’s innovative playing embellished the band’s increasingly experimental sound. This period peaked with such singles as “Heart Full of Soul,” “Shapes of Things,” “Evil Hearted You,” “Still I’m Sad,” a cover of Bo Diddley’s “I’m a Man” and “Over Under Sideways Down,” as well as the 1966 self-titled album often called “Roger the Engineer,” after its Dreja-illustrated cover.</p>\n<p>\n\tSamwell-Smith left in mid-1966 and Page joined initially on bass until Dreja got up to speed on the instrument, and a legendary, albeit short-lived, lineup of the band with Beck and Page on dueling lead guitars was born. That lineup is documented only on three songs, most notably the innovative single “Happenings Ten Years Time Ago” and a version of “Stroll On” that was featured in the Antonioni film “Blow Up.” The Beck-Page Yardbirds appear in that film, miming to the song at a rock club in a performance that culminates with Beck smashing his guitar. While the group toured with the Rolling Stones and Ike & Tina Turner on a legendary September 1966 tour of England, that “Blow Up” scene proved prescient as Beck exited the group months later during an exhausting American tour.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Yardbirds continued with Page as the sole guitarist and Dreja on bass, recording one disappointing album (1968’s “Little Games”) but touring the U.S. extensively as the psychedelic movement blossomed. Its influence was seen in the band’s wardrobe but not so much in its sound, with the exception of songs like “Glimpses” and Page’s “Think About It.” However, the group was dispirited and split in mid-1968, although it had already booked a Scandinavian tour for that fall. After being declined by Dreja, Page recruited new members — bassist-keyboardist John Paul Jones, singer Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham — and did the tour as the New Yardbirds before renaming the band Led Zeppelin.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDreja — who took many striking photos of 1960s-era America while on tour with the Yardbirds — worked successfully as a photographer for many years, also shooting Andy Warhol, Bob Dylan, the Righteous Brothers, Ike and Tina Turner, a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ledzeppelin/comments/1klgx0c/led_zeppelin_photographed_by_chris_dreja_1972/\" target=\"_blank\">later shoot with Zeppelin</a> and many others. He returned to music in the 1980s with former bandmates as Box of Frogs before launching a Yardbirds revival in the 1990s (minus the superstar guitarists and Relf, who died in 1976). The group released an album titled “Birdland” in 2002, featuring guest appearances from Queen’s Brian May, Guns N’ Roses’ Slash and others.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, he suffered a series of strokes in 2012 and retired from music. His death leaves McCarty and Samwell-Smith as the sole surviving original Yardbirds.</p>\n</div>",

David Cross <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/david-cross-slams-bill-burr-riyadh-comedy-festival-1236534601/\">released a statement</a> on Monday shaming Chappelle, as well as fellow Riyadh performers <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bill-burr/\">Bill Burr</a> and Louie CK, for signing up for the event and condoning “totalitarian fiefdom.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Clearly you guys don’t give a shit about what the rest of us think, but how can any of us take any of you seriously ever again?” Cross added. “All of your bitching about ‘cancel culture’ and ‘freedom of speech’ and all that shit? Done. You don’t get to talk about it ever again. By now we’ve all seen the contract you had to sign.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBurr had an entirely different outlook on the event from the inside. He said on a Sept. 29 episode of his “Monday Morning Podcast” that Riyadh was one of the “<a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/bill-burr-defends-riyadh-comedy-festival-backlash-1236536805/\" target=\"_blank\">top three experiences</a>” he’s ever had.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was great to experience that part of the world and to be a part of the first comedy festival over there in Saudi Arabia,” Burr said. “The royals loved the show. Everyone was happy. The people that were doing the festival were thrilled.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe stillness of Arabia’s arid, inhospitable landscapes is disrupted when they become a battlefield for human conflict in “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/desert-warrior/\">Desert Warrior</a>,” the long-developing Saudi epic inspired by real ancient tribes and events that took place in the region. Strikingly photographed, if narratively run-of-the-mill, the latest from director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rupert-wyatt/\">Rupert Wyatt</a> (“Rise of the Planet of the Apes”) begins 1,500 years ago when emperor Kisra II (Ben Kingsley in a one-scene appearance) orders his subjects to surrender their daughters. They must serve as concubines. That includes Princess Hind (Aiysha Hart), who has been in hiding deep in the desert with her father King Numan (Ghassan Massoud).\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFast-paced chases between camels and horses unfold when bloodthirsty commander Jalabzeen (rugged Sharlto Copley) finds Hind. A nameless bandit (a subdued Anthony Mackie) agrees to help her and King Numan reach safety in exchange for gold. For a while, the father and daughter find refuge with the Shaybani people, thanks to their ruler Hani (Tunisian French actor Sami Bouajila), but Hind eventually must take the reins of her destiny. Rather than run forever, she opts for confronting the emperor’s army. At first begrudgingly, other tribes — usually at odds with one another — join her in order to defeat a common enemy.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWyatt’s pointed use of stark silence to enhance some of the tense moments before battles break out is an effective formal choice that, without the use of slow motion, produces the feeling of time moving differently, making the viewer hyper-aware of what may come. When the sound returns and violence ensues, the sequences pack even more momentum. Dan Levy’s score (while not as memorable as his work for a film like “I Lost My Body”) proficiently accompanies the clashes with the grandeur expected from a large-canvas, semi-historical tale of valiant heroines and heroes.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Desert Warrior” finds its most captivating instances in the impressionistic shots of cinematographer Guillermo Garza. Whether it’s the silhouette of a fallen horse against the dying sun of the afternoon or closeups of tribespeople’s hands as they put their craftsmanship to practice. Against the inherently cinematic desert backdrop, with its monochromatic sands and sporadic elevations, Garza’s inspired imagery, which often focuses on sensorial experiences, lends the film an alluring earthiness. In the hands of editor Richard Mettler, some of those fragments serve montages that interlace how the tribes prepare to defend themselves with the way Jalabzeen readies himself to attack. Even if this device turns repetitive, it speaks of a desire to inject a certain visual dynamism.</p>\n<p>\n\tConvincingly portraying a woman who regains her dignity in her quest to follow in her father’s footsteps, Hart’s performance of inscrutable sacrifice balances a regal confidence with the uneasiness of someone in perpetual survival mode. But it’s Bouajila, previously seen as a distressed father in the drama “A Son,” that resonates as the emotional north star, as a sturdy leader conflicted between listening to his people’s demands and behaving honorably with outsiders. Ignoring the inherent artificiality of these characters speaking English during this period, the rest of the cast mostly stays in the same dramatic register as the more prominent characters, with a few exceptions that go for larger-than-life personas, namely some of the heads of the tribes that come together as one battalion.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat the narrative doesn’t veer into empty mysticism, dream sequences or flashbacks benefits the film. Considering how heavy-handed stories of this kind often are, the restraint that Wyatt and co-writers Erica Beeney, Gary Ross and David Self show here is commendable. Nonetheless, commonplace platitudes about honor and bravery take precedence over the feminist undertones Wyatt may aspire to. Avoiding a full-blown romance between Hind and Mackie’s distrustful bandit helps point the story away from more traditional depictions of male-female relationships in such high-stakes scenarios. Their bond at one point hinges on their care for an orphaned boy who decided to follow Hind before anyone else did and who looks up to the self-sufficient outlaw the Marvel star embodies here.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut even as she steps into her power as Queen Hind and successfully unites the disparate factions, the protagonist doesn’t exactly achieve autonomy. Her success is one of sacrifice and not of individual self-actualization. That may seem like too much to ask from this context, yet those qualities are better represented in a supporting part like the woman vanished by her community for speaking her mind (played by Lamis Ammar) or in the punchy epilogue that suggests a different woman within the emperor’s quarters may have played a major part in defeating the ruler — her story could just as well merit its own film.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe top-notch execution behind “Desert Warrior,” at least as far as the below-the-line achievement of delivering Hollywood-level spectacle, is worthy of praise. And yet, the overall package proves overly familiar, despite brushes of excellence scattered throughout.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/henry-cavill/\">Henry Cavill</a> has shared an update after sustaining an injury while filming Chad Stahelski’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/highlander/\">Highlander</a>” reboot.</p>\n<p>\n\tCavill took to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DPRiKWSCA8j/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=30ffcdc4-160e-4ffa-9b40-8bc340849a1a\">Instagram</a> on Wednesday to show his progress since the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/highlander-henry-cavill-injury-delay-1236515549/\">September injury</a>, which delayed the Amazon MGM production likely until early 2026. The “Superman” star posted several photos of himself working out, his left leg still in a boot, with the caption “Endure. In enduring, grow strong.”\n</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tCavill stars in “Highlander” alongside Russell Crowe, Karen Gillan, Djimon Hounsou, Dave Bautista, Marisa Abela and Max Zhang. Stahelski, who helmed the “John Wick” film franchise, directs from a script by Michael Finch.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe “Highlander” remake has been in development for over a decade. It was <a href=\"https://variety.com/2009/film/markets-festivals/summit-taps-lin-moritz-for-highlander-1118008961/\" target=\"_blank\">first announced in 2009</a> at Summit Entertainment, spearheaded by producer Neal H. Moritz. <a href=\"https://variety.com/2016/film/news/highlander-reboot-moves-forward-with-john-wick-director-chad-stahelski-1201924861/\" target=\"_blank\">Stahelski joined the project in 2016</a> and Cavill was <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/news/henry-cavill-highlander-reboot-chad-stahelski-1234978941/\" target=\"_blank\">attached as the star</a> in 2021. Then earlier this year, United Artists, under the leadership of its new chief, Scott Stuber, acquired the project from Lionsgate. Stuber and Mortiz both serve as producers on the film with Nick Nesbitt, Josh Davis, Louise Rosner and Stahelski’s production banner, 87Eleven Entertainment.</p>\n<p>\n\tChristopher Lambert and Sean Connery lead the original 1986 “Highlander,” which sees an ancient clash of Scottish immortals reincarnate into modern-day Manhattan. The film was a box office flop upon its initial release, but it achieved cult classic status on home video, spawning sequels, TV adaptations and spin-off novels.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCavill’s other upcoming projects include Netflix’s “Enola Holmes 3,” Amazon MGM’s “Voltron” and Lionsgate’s action thriller “In the Grey.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "\n\tMilo Ventimiglia has been set as the star of “American Blue,” a cop drama pilot at HBO Max. Additionally, David Ayer has joined the project as director.\n\n\tThe official logline reads, “Native son Brian ‘Milk’ Milkovich (Ventimiglia) returns to his hometown of Joliet, Illinois, to rescue a beleaguered police force while seeking redemption of his own.” Milk is described as “a quietly determined, natural-born leader hoping to find a second chance in the place he left behind.”\n\t\n\n\tVentimiglia is best known for starring as Jack Pearson in “This Is Us,” which ran on NBC for six seasons from 2016 to 2022. He is repped by WME, Entertainment 360, Vision PR and McKuin Frankel Whitehead. Ayer, who has directed films including “Suicide Squad” (2016) and “Fury” (2014), is repped by WME and David Weber and Tom Collier at Sloane, Offer, Weber and Dern, LLP.  \n\n\n\tA one-hour drama, “American Blue” is written by Jeremy Carver, who executive produces alongside Brian Udovich and Neil Reynolds. Ventimiglia serves as co-executive producer, and his producing partner Russ Cundiff serves as producer. Warner Bros. Television, where Carver is under an overall deal, is the studio.\n\n\t“’American Blue’ will take audiences inside a gritty and authentic police drama, reflecting the myriad challenges in policing today,” HBO Max’s head of original programming Sarah Aubrey said in a statement. “As with ‘The Pitt,’ our goal of longer seasons will allow viewers to sink deeply into this world across multiple episodes and to return to it on an annual basis. We can’t wait for Jeremy Carver’s vision for ‘American Blue’ to come to life with Milo Ventimiglia in the lead role and David Ayer directing our pilot.” \n\t\n\n\t“We are thrilled to have Milo and David join ‘American Blue,'” said Clancy Collins White, president of creative affairs at Warner Bros. Television. “Milo’s dynamic presence on-screen and David’s keen eye are a perfect match for the complex, character-driven drama that Jeremy created. We look forward to seeing this trio bring Milk’s journey to life.”\n\n\tDeadline was first to report the news.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA judge on Friday ordered Don Lemon to be released on his own recognizance, after he was indicted on charges of interfering with a religious service during an ICE protest in Minnesota.\n\n\tSpeaking outside the courthouse in downtown Los Angeles, Lemon said that he will not be deterred from his work as an independent journalist.\n\n\t“I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,” he said. “I will not stop ever. Last night, the DOJ sent a team of federal agents to arrest me in the middle of the night for something that I have been doing for the last 30 years, and that is covering the news. The First Amendment of the Constitution protects me and countless other journalists who do what I do. I stand with all of them, and I will not be silenced. I look forward to my day in court.”\n\t\n\n\tJudge Patricia Donahue rejected the government’s request to order a $100,000 bond, and also denied a request to limit his travel to New York and Minnesota. Lemon wore a cream-colored suit. He spoke briefly, affirming the he had read and understood the charges against him.\n\n\tAlexander Robbins, the assistant U.S. attorney, argued that the restrictions were needed because Lemon poses a threat to the community.\n\n\t“The defendant knowingly joined a mob to storm into a church and terrorize people engaged in worship services,” Robbins argued.\n\n\tLemon’s attorney, Marilyn Bednarski, argued that Lemon has no history of violence and does not pose a risk of flight. She asked that he be allowed to take a vacation in France this summer, but otherwise agreed to restrictions on his international travel.\n\t\n\n\t“He is committed to fighting this,” she said.\n\n\tLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass attended the brief hearing. Lemon was ordered to make his next appearance in court in Minneapolis on Feb. 9.\n\n\tThe former CNN anchor, who is now an independent journalist, was taken into custody by two federal agents in Los Angeles on Thursday night. According to his attorney Abbe Lowell, Lemon was in L.A. to cover the Grammy Awards on Sunday. His arrest comes after the Trump administration’s Justice Department sought to charge him with a civil-rights violation in connection with his attendance at a Jan. 18 anti-ICE protest inside a church in St. Paul, Minn. \n\n\tLemon livestreamed coverage of the Minnesota protest and has said he was simply reporting on it. Georgia Fort, another independent journalist who covered the protest, has also been arrested.\n\n\t“Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done,” Lemon’s lawyer said in a statement. “The First Amendment exists to protect journalists whose role it is to shine light on the truth and hold those in power accountable. There is no more important time for people like Don to be doing this work.”\n\n\tU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed that Lemon was arrested in addition to three other individuals over the Minnesota protest. “At my direction, early this morning federal agents arrested Don Lemon, Trahern Jeen Crews, Georgia Fort, and Jamael Lydell Lundy, in connection with the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota,” Bondi wrote in an X post Friday morning, adding: “More details soon.” The White House also mocked Lemon’s arrest on X, writing: “When life gives you lemon…” alongside a graphic announcing news of his arrest. \n\n\tLemon’s former employer CNN spoke out against his arrest, writing: “The FBl’s arrest of our former CNN colleague Don Lemon raises profoundly concerning questions about press freedom and the First Amendment. The Department of Justice already failed twice to get an arrest warrant for Don and several other journalists in Minnesota, where a chief judge of the Minnesota Federal District Court found there was ‘no evidence’ that there was any criminal behavior involved in their work. The First Amendment in the United States protects journalists who bear witness to news and events as they unfold, ensuring they can report freely in the public interest, and the DOJ’s attempts to violate those rights is unacceptable. We will be following this case closely.”\n\t\n\n\tIn 2023, Lemon was fired from CNN after allegations of inappropriate behavior toward women at the network. He then had a brief deal with Elon Musk to produce independent content for X, which fell apart within months, before starting his own program, “The Don Lemon Show.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tSony Pictures Classics has landed rights to Stephanie Ahn‘s feature debut “Bedford Park,” following its premiere at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. The film, starring Moon Choi and Son Sukku, also won the U.S. dramatic special jury award for debut feature earlier Friday.\n\n\tThe deal marks Sony Pictures Classics’ second major win out of the festival following “Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!,” which Variety announced exclusively.\n\n\n\tIn a statement announcing the acquisition, the studio praised Ahn for making “a riveting drama exuding the confidence of a master.” \n\t\n\n\t“‘Bedford Park’ gives us a complete world, full of rich character and incident, steeped in the history of our current intercultural moment,” the statement continues. “This authentic story of two people in New Jersey is relatable and will resonate everywhere — a great movie that’s a pleasure to share with the world.”\n\n\tThe romantic drama follows Audrey (Choi), a woman who struggles between loyalty to her Korean immigrant family and her own American identity, as a child raised in New Jersey.  “Her mother gets into a car accident, which leads to a fateful meeting with Eli (Son), an ex-wrestler battling his own fractured past,” the film’s logline explains. “They journey through an unexpected relationship and create a bond navigating self-preservation, cultural pressures and chosen love.” The film, written and directed by Ahn, also stars Won Mi Kyung, Kim Eung Soo and Jefferson White.\n\n\t“Bedford Park” is produced by Gary Foster (for Krasnoff/Foster Entertainment), Chris S. Lee (B & C Group), Nina Yang Bongiovi (Significant Productions), Theresa Kang (Blue Marble Pictures) and Son Sukku (Stannum). Russ Krasnoff also produces.\n\t\n\n\t“Sony Pictures Classics is the gold standard for thoughtful, filmmaker-driven distribution, and partnering with them on ‘Bedford Park’ is a dream outcome,” the filmmakers added. “Their impeccable taste and legacy of high-quality films that have stood the test of time make it an honor for us to join that family. SPC truly understands how to nurture intimate, human stories and help them find their audience around the world. Their belief in our film and their commitment to giving it the right platform means everything to our team.”\n\n\tExecutive producers include Choi, Sungwon Jee, Yoon-Hyue Julia Kim, Clara Wu Tsai, Agnes Chu, Alex Peace Power, Charles Zhong, Crystine Zhang, Charley Hine, Annie Yang, Julia Xu, Raymond Lee, Chee Ching, Nina Fialkow, Hyun Park, Lenox Huh, Oliver Hsu, Mark Gooder, Alison Thompson, Yang Jinmo, Caroline Garity, Amy Lee, Bryan Hwang, Ali Jazayeri, Viviana Zarragoitia and Stefan Klink.\n\n\tThe deal was negotiated between Sony Pictures Classics and CAA Media Finance in conjunction with Cornerstone Films on behalf of the filmmakers. \n\n\tThe Wrap first reported news of the sale. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAutumn Durald Arkapaw made history when she became the first woman of color to be nominated for a best cinematography Oscar for her work on Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners.”\n\n\t“You dream about those things. It’s a dream come true,” she tells Variety‘s Awards Circuit Podcast. Arkapaw also landed British Society of Cinematographers, BAFTA and American Society of Cinematographers nominations. “It’s a dream come true. I feel like we been celebrating the movie for a while now since it came out in April. I’m not sure if I’ve processed it…and realized.”\n\t\n\n\tArkapaw wasn’t the only one to make history. “Sinners” landed a whooping 16 Oscar nominations breaking the all-time record.\n\n\n\tThe film marks the second collaboration between Coogler and Arkapaw, and she reveals she’ll be reuniting with him again on his “X-Files” reboot. They’re also planning ahead and discussing “Black Panther 3.”\n\n\tShe recalls meeting him for the first time: “I saw him once at a cafe, and I told him this after the fact. We were both eating, and he was with (his wife and producer) Zinzi, and I remember I was with my agent having lunch, and I saw that he was at the table next to me, but we had never met. I didn’t know if he knew who I was. So that was the first time I was in the same space as him, and I clocked him,” she tells Variety‘s Awards Circuit Podcast.\n\n\tA few years later, fellow cinematographer Bradford Young recommended her for “Creed” but she reveals that didn’t work out “because the studio didn’t think I had enough credits, and so I wasn’t able to explore that option to shoot that film.”\n\t\n\n\tShe went on to shoot “The Sun Is Also a Star,” “Mainstream” and Marvel’s “Loki.” When Rachel Morrison transitioned into directing, she sent Arkapaw a text suggesting she would be a good fit. “She felt that I would take care of him and we would work well together.” A Zoom called followed, and “it felt like talking to family,” Arkapaw says. The met shortly after in Atlanta.\n\n\t“Sinners” marked a turning point for the cinematographer – she was the first female cinematographer to shoot on Imax 65mm and Ultra Panavision. Arkapaw admits the challenging aspects were the things that were outside of her control: “The weather never plays ball all the time, so that stuff would be challenging for me, especially on this shoot summer in New Orleans.”\n\n\tAsked about her favorite shot to pull off, Arkapaw says, “The church. I’ve spoken about this a lot, and I think it’s really one of those moments where I can clearly remember its conception and being in a car with Hannah [Beachler, the film’s production designer], where she we’re on a scout. Ryan was in front seat. Hannah had a little book, and she opened it up, and she had a sketchbook, and she’s like, ‘This is what I’m thinking of for the church.'”\n\n\tOn seeing the sketch, Arkapaw knew it was going to be gorgeous to shoot. Once Ruth E. Carter had dressed the actors for the scene, Arkapaw felt like she had stepped back in time and she was going to a service in the 1930s. \n\n\tArkapaw also talks about shooting the film’s climactic fight, collaborating with her fellow department heads and assistant director – Marvin Williams, and how she avoided getting splattered in blood.\n\n\t“My camera team, takes care of me. So we always have a tarp or duvetyne, a black material that you wrap around.”\n\n\tArkapaw also shared what scene they shot on the first day of filming – it was the film’s end credit scene with blues legend Buddy Guy. “It was a very special day because we were shooting these two formats that had never been shot before, and then also just having Buddy Guy on set your first day of shooting is the pressure was on so but it went beautifully,” she says. “No one ever imagined that was our first day of shooting.\n\n\tMore than 10 years ago, Arkapaw made Variety’s 10 Cinematographers to Watch list. This year, she has staked her place in Oscar history. \n\t\n\n\tAlso on this episode, “The Secret Agent” star Wagner Moura, and the Roundtable discuss the BAFTA nominations and the Television Academy’s revived variety series category.\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

    "body": "\n\tBruce Springsteen brought his protest song “Streets of Minneapolis” to the actual streets of Minneapolis Friday afternoon, making an unadvertised appearance at a daytime benefit concert organized by Rage Against the Machine’s Tom Morello.\n\n\tAt the noontime concert, billed as “A Concert of Solidarity & Resistance to Defend Minnesota!” and taking place place at Minneapolis’ famous First Avenue club, Springsteen appeared solo to offer the first live rendition of “Streets of Minneapolis.” He was then joined by Morello and band for an eight-minute version of his “Grapes of Wrath”-themed “The Ghost of Tom Joad.”\n\t\n\n\tThe crowd loudly shouted along with “ICE out now!” in the final verse of the new Springsteen song, as it ends with the lines, “In our chants of ‘ICE out now’ / Our city’s heart and soul persists / Through broken glass and bloody tears / On the streets of Minneapolis.” The audience also spontaneously broke out into just such a chant between songs.\n\n\n\tIntroducing the new song, Springsteen said, ““I wrote this song and I recorded it the next day, and I sent it to Tom Morello. Now I know Tom is an excitable man…” He said he told Morello, “‘I think it’s kinda soapboxy.’ He says, ‘Bruce, nuance is wonderful, but sometimes you have to kick them in the teeth.’ So this is for the people of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the people of our good country, the United States of America.”\n\n\t(Watch the full performance here: https://www.instagram.com/reels/DUJd_KiCRsk)\n\n\tPromotion for the concert noted that 100% of proceeds would go to “the families of those murdered by ICE,” naming slain activists Renee Good and Alex Pretti.\n\t\n\n\n\tAmy Klobuchar, the U.S. senator from Minnesota who is running for governor, posted a clip from the concert, writing, “Bruce Springsteen singing his new song ‘Streets of Minneapolis’ at our very own First Avenue. A place where amazing artists like Prince got their start – this venue means so much to our state and it’s incredible to see Bruce bring our community together.”\n\nBruce Springsteen singing his new song \"Streets of Minneapolis\" at our very own First Avenue. A place where amazing artists like Prince got their start – this venue means so much to our state and it's incredible to see Bruce bring our community together. https://t.co/DCvN7JStvO— Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) January 30, 2026\n\n\n\tThe official headliners were Morello and Rise Against, with additional performances by Al Di Meola, Ike Reilly and the promised “very special guest” that turned out to be Springsteen.\n\n\tThe performance came days after Springsteen released his “Streets of Minneapolis” song, in which he sang about how “a city aflame fought fire and ice ‘neath an occupier’s boots,” with descriptions of “King Trump’s private army from the DHS,” “Trump’s federal thugs” and “bloody footprints where mercy should have stood… two dead, left to die on snow-filled streets.”\n\n\tIn a social post touting the First Avenue benefit, Morello wrote: “If it looks like fascism, sounds like fascism, acts like fascism, dresses like fascism, talks like fascism, kills like fascism and lies like fascism, boys & girls it’s f*cking fascism. It’s here, it’s now, it’s in my city, it’s in your city and it must be resisted, protested, defended against, stood up to, exposed, ousted, overthrown and driven out. By you and by me. We are coming to Minneapolis where the people have heroically stood up against ICE, stood up against Trump, stood up against this terrible rising tide of state terror. Where the people have stood up for their neighbors and themselves, for democracy and justice. Ain’t nobody coming to save us except us and it’s now or never.”\n\n\n\tThe Minneapolis show coincided with a general strike being called by activists across the country that caused many workers and students to walk out in protest of the ICE abductions continuing to happen nationally.\n\n\tIn response to Springsteen’s initial release of “Streets of Philadelphia,” the White House called Springsteen’s headline-making song “irrelevant” and “inaccurate.” The president himself has not responded to the song, although he engaged in a war of words with Springsteen last year, reacting to the rock superstar’s comments during live performance overseas and calling him “dumb as a rock” and “a dried out prune.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains major spoilers for Sam Raimi‘s “Send Help,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\t“Send Help,” Sam Raimi’s twisty thriller written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift and in theaters Friday via 20th Century Studios, is filled with shocking moments. Too scared to catch the new Raimi project on the big screen? Far too busy seeing “Melania” again and again? Keep reading to break down all of the big moments of “Send Help.”\n\t\n\n\tRachel McAdams stars as Linda Liddle, who works at a company where the new nepo baby CEO, Bradley Preston (Dylan O’Brien), doesn’t know or care that she’s been promised a VP position by his late father. While she’s brilliant with numbers, he gives the job to his douchey college buddy and condescendingly asks her to come with them on an international trip to help do work while the guys golf.\n\n\n\tUnfortunately, the private plane goes down and Linda and Bradley are the only survivors, getting swept away to a deserted island. Bradley is in luck, as Linda is a devoted “Survivor” fan and loves reading adventure books, so she is amazingly proficient at building shelter, fire and increasingly complex items like hats and backpacks. \n\n\tYet while Linda helps Bradley, as his leg is injured and he’s not outdoorsy, he is rude and bossy to her, bringing his attitude from the office to outdoor life. At one point, Linda abandons him, and Bradley quickly realizes he needs her to survive. He apologizes, and they are peaceful with each other for a while.\n\n\tYet their niceties don’t last. Linda, more mobile than Bradley, explores the island and notices that boats come close on occasion. But she’s enjoying her time as a leader on the island, so she keeps this information to herself. \n\t\n\n\tAlthough Bradley acts increasingly warm to Linda, he soon begins to believe she doesn’t want them to get rescued. So he makes a dinner for her but includes poisonous berries, which temporarily incapacitate her. He uses the opportunity to try to escape on a homemade raft, which almost immediately kills him, and Linda has to save him again. She then takes control back by feeding Bradley a poisonous fish, which paralyzes him but keeps his mind and eyes clear. She then pretends to castrate him, but was only killing a rat, and uses the opportunity to let him know that she is not to be trifled with.\n\n\tOne day, weeks after the plane crash, Linda is spotted while walking through the woods by Bradley’s fiancée, Zuri (Edyll Ismail), who hired a private guide to find him and any other survivors. Yet Zuri trips off of a winding mountain trail, and Linda attacks the private guide while he’s trying to save her, sending both to fall to their death.\n\n\tSoon after, Bradley sees Zuri’s hand (complete with an engagement ring on the finger) popping out of the surf and believes that Linda killed her. The two begin brawling, and Bradley starts running away to a part of the island Linda advised against, citing poisonous plants. But he realizes that there’s actually a huge mansion there, which was where the boats had been coming to and from. \n\n\tLinda catches up to him and reveals that she’s been getting supplies from the house — which is owned by a billionaire who is never around — for weeks. Bradley tries to get the upper hand and kill her, yet Linda grabs a shotgun from the home and aims it at him.\n\n\tAt this point, Bradley begs for his life, saying he’s a changed man and telling Linda he loves her. But she doesn’t buy it, and he scrambles to get the gun. He finds it empty when he points it at her, at which point Linda beats him to death with a golf club.\n\n\tCut to one year later, where Linda is playing a celebrity golf game and telling reporters about how thrilled she is that the memoir she wrote about her escape is going to be made into a movie. She says she’s also writing a self-help book, and drives away in a gorgeous car, living the good life as the credits roll.\n\n\tNow that you know the plot, watch a trailer for “Send Help” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBob Iger may be exiting the Mouse House before his CEO contract expires at the end of the year.\n\n\tIger has told “associates” that he plans to step down as CEO and “pull back from daily management” before the Dec. 31, 2026, end of his contract, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing anonymous sources. Per the Journal story, Iger has told “people close to him that he is ready to move on from the grind of being CEO” — and that he was “frustrated” by “conflicts” at ABC over the nearly weeklong suspension of Jimmy Kimmel in September over on-air remarks the late-night host made about Charlie Kirk’s killer.\n\t\n\n\tVariety has reached out to Disney for comment.\n\n\n\tThe board of Disney has said it expects to announce Iger’s successor “in early 2026.” The board of directors is planning to meet next week at Disney’s Burbank headquarters, where they are “expected to vote on who should take the top job,” the Journal reported.\n\n\t“The appointment of the next CEO will be determined by the full Board, and we currently expect to announce the appointment of the Company’s next CEO in early 2026,” Disney chairman James Gorman said in Disney’s 2026 proxy statement, filed last week. \n\n\tThe company did not identify which execs are on the shortlist but said, “Each internal candidate is going through a rigorous preparation process, including mentorship from Mr. Iger, external coaching and engagement with all Directors.”\n\n\tThe two leading candidates to become Disney’s next CEO, according to analysts tracking the situation, are Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Experiences, who oversees the company’s parks, cruises and consumer products, and Dana Walden, co-chairman of Disney Entertainment, whose purview includes the global streaming business. (For what it’s worth, online betting markets are heavily favoring D’Amaro.)\n\t\n\n\tThe WSJ report also said Iger has told several associates that “he would like to spend more of his time and energy on other things, such as sailing his new and larger superyacht, the Aquarius,” which was delivered to him last summer. In addition, Iger has said he wants to dedicate more time working with his wife, Willow Bay, who is the dean of the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, and on Angel City FC, the women’s soccer team the couple bought a controlling stake in two years ago.\n\n\tIger, after serving as CEO of Disney for 15 years, previously retired at the end of 2021 and was replaced by then-CEO Bob Chapek. But in November 2022, the board ousted Chapek and brought Iger back as chief exec.\n\n\tIn 2025, Iger’s total compensation was $45.8 million, up 11.5%. That included Disney stock awards worth $21 million, $14 million in stock options, a $7.25 million cash bonus and $2.59 million in other compensation (including $1.85 million for security and $568,670 for personal air travel).\n\n\tIger is up for reelection to Disney’s board at the 2026 annual shareholders meeting for a one-year term. The meeting will be held virtually on March 18.\n\n\tIger “has an unmatched knowledge of the Company and the creative content it produces, and an in-depth understanding of fostering innovation through technology and connecting to audiences in our markets around the world,” Disney said in the proxy statement.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDon Lemon can’t anchor “The Don Lemon Show” at present, but that doesn’t mean the program has gone quiet.\n\n\tA group of prominent creators, influencers and media figures kept Lemon’s YouTube channel active Friday, asking viewers who call themselves “Lemon Heads” to support the journalist after he was arrested and charged with federal civil rights crimes after trying to live-stream a protest at a church service in Minnesota earlier in January. Lemon was arrested in Los Angeles and is expected to appear a court hearing Friday afternoon. Others were arrested on similar charges Friday, including Minnesota journalist Georgia Fort.\n\t\n\n\t“We cannot be scared,” said Katie Phang, who was anchoring an hour of “The Don Lemon Show,” Friday afternoon while urging viewers to subscribe to Lemon’s media properties. The former MSNBC opinion host, now operating her own independent media outlet talked with Tim Miller from The Bulwark,, among others. “This is definitely a moment.” \n\n\n\tA single chyron remained unchanged at the bottom of the screen: “Breaking: Don Lemon Arrested.”\n\n\tLemon’s YouTube channel went into rolling coverage of his arrest starting at 10 a.m., according to a person familiar with the matter. Among those making appearances were comedian DL Hughley, Joy Reid, Wajahat Ali, Jim Acosta, Anthony Scaramucci and Olivia Troye.\n\n\tSince exiting CNN in 2023, Lemon has put the bulk of his effort into leading an independent media operation, holding forth on YouTube, Tik Tok and Instagram, and mixing it up with newsmakers as well as people on the street. “It’s not very often you get to this stage of your life and get to reinvent yourself and learn new things,” Lemon told Variety earlier in January. The departure from “forced me” to pivot, and, as a result, he adds, “I feel younger and more a part of the culture and the zeitgeist than when” he worked at the news outlet.\n\t\n\n\tLemon was in Los Angeles to do some work from the Grammys, part of a strategy he has been pursuing around live events. He recently did a New Year’s Eve show from New Orleans, a reboot of sorts of the work he used to do for CNN following Anderson Cooper’s hosting of coverage from Times Square. He wasn’t entirely sure he would be able to pull the whole thing off. He hired the production crew and camera personnel, and had to make certain the event space had the proper connectivity that would stay intact throughout the day. He also had to make sure his coverage had a sponsor, and his team lined up Don Julio tequila.\n\n\tA groundswell of support has risen since Lemon’s arrest was announced Friday morning, with CNN and other parties expressing dismay.\n\n\t“The federal government prosecuting journalists for their reporting is extremely concerning, made more so by its continued pursuit of these charges after a magistrate judge refused to sign-off on the arrest warrant and over the reported objections of career prosecutors,” the ACLU said in a statement. “This will send a chilling message to other journalists reporting on the administration’s actions, and should be understood in the context of the government’s broader crackdown on freedom of the press.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn an era defined by consolidation and scale, Mediawan’s acquisition of Peter Chernin’s North Road Company brings together one of Europe’s fastest-growing content groups and one of the most influential producers in Hollywood, creating what Chernin calls “arguably the most global content company in the world right now.”\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety a few hours after the deal was unveiled, Chernin and Mediawan’s boss Pierre-Antoine Capton argued the merger is rooted in a fundamental shift in the business. “The buyers have all become global,” said Chernin, a longtime media investor and former chairman of Fox who co-founded North Road with Jenno Topping and Jesse Jacobs in 2022. “Netflix, Amazon and Disney are global buying forces and both of us felt that it was important for the producers to become similarly global,” he added. \n\t\n\n\tWhile North Road is being folded into Mediawan, the acquisition does not dismantle what either side has built. North Road’s labels and management teams remain fully in place, preserving the autonomy that has powered its success across scripted, unscripted and documentary content. Instead, the ambition is to build scale without rather than prioritize cost-cutting. “You never cost-save your way into success,” Chernin said. “You become successful by growing revenues.”\n\n\n\tCapton, who landed from L.A. earlier Friday and rushed to Mediawan’s posh offices in Paris, described the acquisition as the culmination of a long courtship and a strategic leap for Mediawan’s global ambitions, notably across English-speaking markets, where the company is already behind Brad Pitt’s Plan B (“Adolescence,” “F1”) and See-Saw Films (“Slow Horses”), and has partnerships with LuckyChap and Springhill. “We are similar companies in terms of what Peter built with North Road and what we built with Mediawan,” said Capton, who is also a leading producer of primetime talk shows in France. “Together we will succeed in bringing the best of Europe and the United States together in one company,” he added. The pairing also balances complementary strengths as North Road is known for its unscripted hits and premium documentaries while Mediawan boasts a deep footprint in European television series and theatrical films.\n\t\n\n\tCapton noted “how much of an impact (Chernin) has had on the industry.” “He’s the person who greenlit ‘Avatar’ and ‘Titanic.’ The entire industry has immense respect for him, and working with Peter is an incredible opportunity for us to take the next step,” he said. \n\n\tFor Chernin, the decision to partner with Mediawan went well beyond financial considerations. “The cultures of the company are very similar,” he said. “Both companies value creativity and prize, in some ways, artists more than anything.” He pointed to Capton’s track record of maintaining creative independence across acquisitions such as Plan B and See-Saw, while quietly building operational synergies behind the scenes. “I couldn’t ask for better partners going forward,” Chernin added.\n\n\tChernin also highlighted the strategic benefits of having a Paris-based parent with a powerful U.S. presence. “Talent is global,” he said, noting that different regulatory frameworks and financing models on either side of the Atlantic allow projects to find the most advantageous home.\n\n\tChernin and Capton also confirmed the deal was paid mostly in stock rather than cash. As such, Chernin becomes a major shareholder in Mediawan, underscoring his long-term commitment in the banner which was founded a decade ago by Capton, telco billionaire Xavier Niel and financier Matthieu Pigasse. “This isn’t me or North Road cashing out,” he said. “In some ways, this is us investing in Mediawan.”\n\t\n\t\tYour announcement today refers to the creation of a “combined group.” Concretely, what does that mean, given that North Road’s management team and labels remain in place? \t\n\n\tPeter Chernin: I think there’s a huge opportunity for a truly global company. And in my opinion, Mediawan is arguably the most global content company in the world right now. There are lots of great content companies, but I don’t think anybody can match that global scale. Mediawan is now the number one independent in France, in Germany and in the United States. Pierre Antoine and I have spent a couple of years talking about this. The buyers have all become global. Netflix, Amazon and Disney are global buying forces. And I think both of us felt that it was important for the producers to become similarly global in order to take advantage of the opportunities in doing that.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPeter, you were likely approached by other major U.S. and international groups. Beyond the financial terms, what ultimately made Mediawan the right partner?\t\n\n\tChernin: Two things were very important to me. One is the culture of the company, and I think we are very similar. Pierre Antoine comes from a creative background, and I come from a creative background. Both companies value creativity and value artists more than anything. When I set out to build North Road, I got Jenno Topping, who is the best movie executive; Chris Coelen, who is the best reality executive; Connor Schell, the best documentary executive. And I think Pierre Antoine has spent the last 10 years doing the same thing on his side. And so there’s a culture of both valuing artists and understanding the nuances of, on the one hand, how to give artists complete creative independence, which, you can see that Pierre Antoine has done that with every company he’s bought as recently as See-Saw and Plan B, and yet at the same time has started to build real business synergies and opportunities between them. So I think on a macro basis, in terms of where the business is going, this felt perfect. And then in terms of the fit of the companies, I think we have the same values.\n\t\n\t\tWhat strategic advantages do you see in becoming part of a European company headquartered in Paris? How does that change your positioning in the global market?\t\n\n\tChernin: Well, the food’s better, for starters. I think that talent is global and it gives you an opportunity to sort of find the best talent anywhere in the world and then find the best home for that talent. Mediawan brings us talent to Europe, and we bring European talent to the U.S., so on and so forth. So I think that’s a real strategic advantage. And then there are different regulatory opportunities in different countries. There are different financial models in different countries. It’s much easier to have ownership in Europe, which is really important, and probably in the short term it’s easier to get more cash in the U.S. And it gives you an opportunity on a project-by-project basis, to figure out the best home for things. We’ve already done this in some ways, twice. We produced an Academy Award-nominated documentary two years ago called “Super/Man” about Christopher Reeve and we financed it and sold it in the U.S. We also just produced a documentary about Paris Saint-Germain, which we produced out of the U.S. with Mediawan and sold it to Netflix France. So I think those are, you know, two existing examples of sort of the opportunities of joining forces between a European company and an American company.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPierre-Antoine, I know you looked at different U.S. companies, what made North Road the right fit for Mediawan? \t\n\n\tPierre-Antoine Capton: We are similar companies in terms of what Peter built with North Road and what we built with Mediawan. Both groups were dedicated to independent talent and the quality of what they produced in slightly different genres, with Peter’s side focusing more on unscripted content, with huge hits such as “Love is Blind” and many platform films. We are more focused on TV series and theatrical films, but in different geographical areas. We’ve been talking to Peter for four years. I realized how much of an impact Peter has had on the industry. He’s the person who greenlit ‘Avatar’ and ‘Titanic.’ The entire industry has immense respect for him, and working with Peter is an incredible opportunity for us to take the next step. Even though the group will be called Mediawan, Peter’s ambitions and ours are completely aligned in the success of this combined group. I think that together we will succeed in bringing the best of Europe and the United States together in one company, first creatively and then from a shareholder perspective.\n\t\n\t\tWhere do you see synergies emerging within this new combined group?\t\n\n\tCapton: First, strategically, we’re going to talk a lot with Peter and all the teams, Jenno and Connor, we want to work with them. Today, the best European talent will talk with all these teams to see what projects we can put together. I think there will be a lot of creative synergy. And then, Peter’s strength will also allow us to have a greater presence in the United States.\n\t\n\t\tHow is North Road expected to work alongside Mediawan’s existing labels? Are there specific areas – development, financing, distribution — where collaboration is already planned?\t\n\n\tCapton: In fact, each of North Road’s labels is already independent. Kinetic is independent, Words + Pictures is independent. Everyone works autonomously, and Plan B is also completely independent and will continue to work in the same way. So everyone will draw strength from each other. If North Road can contribute something to Plan B, if See-Saw can contribute something to Kinetic, if Chi-Fou-Mi can work with North Road Company, we will do so with great pleasure. Everyone is very excited about the prospect of working together. I have rarely received so many enthusiastic messages from producers on both sides.\n\t\n\n\tChernin: So many of these deals are focused on cost synergies and there are certainly some cost synergies in this deal. But I think what’s much more meaningful is the opportunity to build aggressively together and it’s part of what appeals to me so much about Mediawan and Pierre Antoine. So many people are focused on how do we get costs out of business. And I’ve done this long enough to know that you never cost-save your way into success. It’s important to be frugal, and I think both companies are frugal, but you become successful by growing revenues. And our entire focus, all through our discussions has been ‘how do we grow the business?’ Not ‘how do we cut costs?’ And by the way, there are, as I said, some costs we can cut, but it’s consistently been ‘how do we grow revenues.” So, Pierre, Antoine and I are getting together in London a week from today, and we’re getting together in Paris the week after. We’re about to dig in aggressively about all the ways we can grow the business together and all the projects we can do together.\n\t\n\t\tNow that Mediawan has built significant scale through this acquisition to form a global production group in the U.S., are you considering expanding into distribution, or do you intend to remain a pure production player? \t\n\n\tCapton: Over at Mediawan, we have only one distribution arm in Germany with Leonine. So we will discuss with Peter whether it makes sense to strengthen our position in terms of distribution. But in  U.S., we want to become a studio, and it’s part of Peter’s strategy as well. \n\n\tChernin: One of the things that we’ve been missing for a long time is that we haven’t had a distribution company. We actually considered acquiring some assets over the years, but it has been a missing piece in our company. And it’s one of the many things that’s attractive to us about this merger is being part of a global distribution company, both in television and films.\n\t\n\t\tHow do you expect the Netflix–Warner Bros. deal will reshape the landscape for independent production companies?\t\n\n\tChernin: First off, both companies are good friends of ours and we are major suppliers to both of them. And so we look forward to dealing with both of them. We do think that as part of any deal considerations, independent production is very important and the health of independent production companies is crucial, not only financially, but creatively. We will have ongoing conversations with everybody, but these are all our business partners and our friends, and so we will have constructive conversations with everybody.\n\t\n\n\tCapton: We have also good relations with both of them and as Peter said, it’s important to preserve independent producers and their creativity. \n\t\n\t\tPierre-Antoine, are you looking to make other acquisitions in the U.S.? \t\n\n\tCapton: We just signed this deal with North Road two days ago. So right now our priority is to start working together and continue to create. Ultimately, Mediawan wants to attract the best independent producers and creative talent. And of course, we will be agile in case of new potential acquisitions or partnerships. \n\t\n\t\tAnd Peter, you’re also going to become a member of the Mediawan board?\t\n\n\tChernin: Honestly, the more important thing is my relationship with Pierre Antoine. You know, I look at him as my partner and I will do anything I can to help him and help the company grow. Those things are more impactful on a personal and daily level with Pierre-Antoine and Elisabeth d’Arvieu (Mediawan’s CCO) and Guillaume Izabel (Mediawan’s CFO). I will support and help the company in any way I can in any way they ask me to. But my instinct is that’s more likely to be on a daily personal basis with Pierre Antoine and his team, KKR, Xavier Niel, Matthew Pigasse, all of them.\n\t\n\t\tThe New York Times reported that the transaction is largely stock-based and values North Road at around $900 million. Is that accurate? \t\n\n\tChernin: I would say the part about stock is accurate, the other part I have no comment on. \n\t\n\t\tYou’re also becoming a shareholder of Mediawan through this deal.\t\n\n\tChernin: Yes, I guess I’m now a big shareholder of Mediawan, and so I have a big incentive, too. This isn’t me or North Road cashing out. In some ways, this is us investing in Mediawan and I think it’s an indication of our belief in the company and the growth opportunity.\n\n\tCapton: And for us, it’s not only the acquisition of North Road that makes sense, it’s also the opportunity it gives us to work as partners with Peter. He’s a genius in so many ways and having him as a key shareholder, partner and associate, and being able to discuss with him every day or every week to be aligned on our strategy, will undeniably bolster Mediawan’s growth. \n",

Previously, Elon claimed that he refused invitations from Epstein to visit the island, where alleged acts of pedophilia went down.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Two days later, Epstein wrote back to Musk that he could swing by at the start of the new year, adding that there's “always space for you.” Epstein sent a follow-up email Christmas Day, stating he would pick up Musk on January 2 or 3.\n      \n\n          Musk replied he would have to return to Los Angeles on the night of January 2, but then changed his mind, saying he could fly in on the 1st. Epstein responded that any day between the 1st and the 8th would work, and they could play it by ear. It's unclear from the email exchange whether Musk actually visited Epstein island.\n      \n    \n          This isn't the first time Musk's name has appeared in the Epstein files. Musk showed up in the first batch of files, which dropped in September, and Elon tried to dissociate himself from Epstein, tweeting out, “Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED.”\n      \n    \n          As you know, Epstein died by suicide in 2019 at the now shuttered Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to Musk for comment ... so far no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jeffrey Epstein\n              \n                          \n                Elon Musk\n              \n                          \n                Politics\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

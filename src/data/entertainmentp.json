    "body": "\n\tThough Ethan Hawke was just a teenager during the filming of “Dead Poets Society,” he recognized that Robin Williams — who played inspiring English teacher John Keating in Peter Weir’s 1989 classic — was struggling.\n\n\tWhen asked in an interview on “CBS Sunday Morning” if he’s been able to watch the film after Williams’ 2014 suicide amid his battle with Lewy body dementia, Hawke said that “does not fundamentally change the way I watch the movie.”\n\t\n\n\t“Even at 18, I was aware of the complexity of his emotional life,” Hawke continued. “I’ve had a lot of depression in my family, and it was obvious to me that all that power and that charisma came at a certain cost. He was a deeply, deeply sensitive person who was highly attuned to the energy of a room.”\n\n\n\tHawke recalled that one time on set, Williams was “making up lines and everyone was laughing and praising him,” but when Hawke later went to get a glass of water he found Williams “hiding in the corner in the dark by himself.”\n\n\t“I thought, ‘Oh, OK. It makes a lot more sense to me now,'” Hawke said. “It was a lot. It was taxing. There’s a lot of stories about clowns and the happiness they give and at what cost. So I say all that to say, the end of his life does not define his life to me. And when I watch the movie, I think of the spirit of the man I knew in those days and how powerful it was and how much he weathered that storm of his psyche for us and for other people.”\n\n\t“Dead Poets Society” marked the second feature film for Hawke, who has gone on to receive four Oscar nominations. Looking back, he said the movie taught him several important lessons, including how to handle bad reviews.\n\t\n\n\t“I didn’t realize how much I was being taught and how that sustained me through negative criticism,” Hawke said. “Like, there’s not any rules about being a great actor. Drop dead! So you don’t like it, suck an egg! It’s not my problem you don’t like it. You don’t know what great acting is any more than I do. And those ideas were given to me by playing the movie.”\n\n\tWatch Hawke’s full “CBS Sunday Morning” interview below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndia’s Kerala Film Market has unveiled its selections for the Project Market 2025, along with the inaugural Curator’s Pick from its newly launched Video Library segment, set to take place Dec. 13-16 in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\n\tFormerly known as the International Film Market of Kerala, the initiative received submissions from around the world, ultimately selecting 12 projects representing 11 countries for its Project Market. The lineup features films in 13 languages, including Hindi, English, Spanish, Bengali, Marathi, Maithili, Nepali, Assamese, Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Bangla and Bhojpuri.\n\t\n\n\tSelected producers and filmmakers will pitch their projects to international and Indian producers, distributors and financiers during the four-day event.\n\n\n\tAmong the Project Market selections is “Apodartho” (A Foolish Man), a Bangladesh-Taiwan co-production in Bangla directed by Abu Shahed Emon, whose debut feature “Jalal’s Story” became the first Bangladeshi film to premiere in Busan’s New Currents Competition in 2014.

Makhija won an Indian National Film Award for “Bhonsle” in 2021, while “Joram” earned two Filmfare Awards in 2024.\n\t\n\n\tOther notable selections include “Error#404,” directed by two-time Indian National Film Award winner Farha Khatun and produced by Bauddhayan Mukherji and Monalisa Mukherji; and “Kathakali Diva: A Ritual of Transformation,” directed by Indian National Film Award-winning editor Bina Paul, who has previously served as director of the International Film Festival of Kerala. \n\n\tSanju Surendran’s “Kothiyan” (Fishers of Men) marks another Malayalam-language project in the lineup. Surendran’s recent feature “If on a Winter’s Night” premiered at the Busan International Film Festival, winning the HyLife Vision Award.\n\n\tThe Australia-India co-production “Mongoose,” directed by Indian National Award winner Nikhil Mahajan and produced by Suhrud Godbole, joins the roster alongside “Sukoon” (Solace), directed by Film and Television Institute of India graduate Gul Dharmani, who recently directed episodes of Netflix’s “Class.”\n\n\tAdditional selections include “Calf-Umir Ladikaiyan” in Bhojpuri and Hindi, directed by Balaka Ghosh; Kenny Deori Basumatary’s “Local Bhoot” (Local Ghost) in Assamese and Hindi; Armenia-India co-production “The Day of the Feast” in Telugu, directed by Di Sica Ray; and “Vilai: The Price Paid” in Malayalam and Tamil, directed by Menon Krishnadev.\n\n\tThe market has also unveiled 13 films selected for the inaugural Video Library Curator’s Pick. These projects, spanning various stages of production and post-production, are seeking distributors, gap financing and festival visibility.\n\n\tThe Curator’s Pick selection represents India, Bangladesh and the U.S. The complete lineup includes Anuradha Bansal’s documentary “A Good Wife” in English, Hindi and Marwari; Abhay P’s Malayalam short film “Aadhunika Mithyabhasam” (Burning Roots, Blooming Fire); Gridaran MKP’s Tamil documentary “Dalit Subbaiah – Voice of the Rebels,” produced by Manoj Jahson; and Sandeep Paul’s “Ekanto Byaktigoto Bishoy” (About an Intimate Matter), an India-U.S. co-production in Bengali produced by Apoorva Bakshi.\n\n\tAlso selected are Rahul Pawar’s “Golu Gappi Aur Charkhi Chor” (Golu Gappi And Charkhi Thief) in Bhojpuri and Hindi, produced by Anurag Kumar Mourya; Thanvir Chowdhury’s Bengali feature “Kaffarah” from Bangladesh, produced by Barkat Hossain Polash; Aayushman Pandey’s Hindi short film “Kamathipura,” produced by Wasim Khan and Priya Sreedharan; and Chahat Mansingka’s “Like A Feather In The Wind” in Chinese and Hakka, produced by Sanjay Mansingka.\n\t\n\n\tRounding out the selection are Vignesh Kumulai’s Tamil feature “Neela Aththi Kili” (Blue Fig Parrot), produced by Jeyachandran Karthikadevi; Sanchay Bose’s Hindi feature “Phas Gayi Jal Machri” (The Golden Catch), produced by Wafa Refai; Shreekara Bhat’s Kannada feature “Purushaavathara” (Shades of Men), produced by Prakash Raj; Sreekanth EG’s Malayalam feature “The Judgement,” produced by Adith US; and Siddharth Kalkal’s “The Writer’s Inn” in English and Hindi.\n\n\t“The Kerala Film Market has become a dynamic ecosystem that brings together creators, investors, and industry professionals,” said Priyadarsanan P.S., managing director of Kerala State Film Development Corporation (KSFDC). “This year’s curated selection reflects our commitment to nurturing diverse cinematic voices and positioning Kerala Film Market as a significant hub for global film business and creative collaboration.”\n\n\tK. Madhu, chairman of KSFDC, added: “In just three years, the Kerala Film Market has grown into a credible, forward-looking industry forum. The selected projects and films demonstrate the tremendous creative potential and we are proud to host a platform that enables meaningful engagements and opportunities for filmmakers.”\n\n\tThe Kerala Film Market is designed as an integral component of the International Film Festival of Kerala, one of India’s most artistically respected festivals. While IFFK celebrates cinema as a cultural force, Kerala Film Market adds a business dimension focused on co-production infrastructure, financing and market access.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSwedish-born Hollywood star Alexander Skarsgård who hasn’t played in a Scandinavian feature in more than a decade is toplining the gothic horror pic “The Wolf Will Tear Your Immaculate Hands,” the English-language debut of Swedish-Costa-Rican writer-director Nathalie Álvarez Mesén, to be delivered in May 2026.\n\n\tCurrently in production, “The Wolf…” is Mesén’s sophomore feature after the multi-awarded “Clara Sola” which debuted at the 2021 Cannes Directors’ Fortnight and bowed in the U.S. via Oscilloscope.Co-penned by Mesén with acclaimed Icelandic novelist, poet and screenwriter Sjón, credited for Skarsgård’s vehicle “The Northman” and the Cannes Un Certain Regard “Lamb,” “The Wolf…” deepens Mesén’s “signature blend of intimate character work and magic realism, expanding it into a darker, more haunting period world,” said an official statement.\n\t\n\n\tIn a challenging new role for Skarsgård, currently making a splash on screens in Harry Lighton’s “Pillion,” the Golden Globe winning actor plays a British widower in the 1880s Pacific Northwest, who hires a Native American governess, educated in a Christian mission school, to teach his two daughters. “While preparing the eldest for an arranged marriage, a force within her begins to awaken, threatening everything she has been taught,” runs the logline.\n\n\n\tIndigenous Canadian actress Darla Contois, winner of a Canadian Screen Award for the drama series “Little Bird,” has landed the role of the governess, while the two daughters are played by British actress Bronte Carmichael (“Star Wars: Andor,” “Christopher Robin”) and the young Australian Lily La Torre (“Run Rabbit Run”). Rounded out the cast are Native American actor Forrest Goodluck (“The Revenant,” “How to Blow Up a Pipeline”) and Swedish star actress Pernilla August (“Star Wars”, “The Best Intentions”).\n\t\n\n\t“I feel incredibly lucky to work with a cast who dive into their roles with such generosity, playfulness, and openness. Collaborating with such a talented group of people from all around the world has been a privilege,” said Mesén. “Darla embodies Isabel with visceral emotional depth, and Alexander portrays the father with a truth and volatility that ground the story. I can’t wait for the film to reach audiences!”\n\n\tSpeaking earlier to Variety about the long-gestated project and digging deeper into its core, the 37-year-old director said the story discusses “how to break free from patriarchal structures and if you can decolonize your own body, if not for yourself, for the sake of future generations.”\n\n\t“As someone who’s worked with myth and folk stories in novels, songs and screenplays, I was immediately fascinated by Nathalie’s command of bringing to the screen something as difficult as the shifting borders between the inner and outer reality of her film’s protagonist” offered Sjón, who added “some dark Northern lyricism to Nathalie’s warm Latin American poetry.”\n\n\tCompleting the stellar creative team are some of Europe’s biggest heads of department: French cinematographer Hélène Louvart (“La Chimera,” “Pina”), Belgian editor and regular Dardenne brothers collaborator Marie-Hélène Dozo (“Young Ahmed,” “Six Days in Spring”), Swedish production designer Lina Nordqvist (“Holy Spider,” “Borg Vs McEnroe”) and Icelandic costume designer Margrét Einarsdóttir (“Lamb,” “King & Conqueror”).\n\n\t“The Wolf…” marks a major milestone for producer Nima Yousefi, CEO of Sweden’s prestige boutique outfit Hobab, credited for the Venice Horizons winner “Paradise Burning” and co-producer of the 2025 Oscar nominated “The Apprentice”. The seasoned executive, who’s been shepherding Mesén for a decade, said her “distinctive voice” displayed in “Clara Sola,” billed by Variety reviewer Jessica Kiang as a ‘spellbinding debut,” is why he was able to assemble such a prestigious creative team and complex multi-territory financing.\n\n\tIndeed, on “The Wolf,” international partners on board include Resolve Media in the U.S., European co-producers Quiddity Films in the U.K., Need Productions in Belgium and Still Vivid in Iceland. The mix of soft and private-sector finance was raised via Film i Väst, SVT, VOO, OBE & Be tv, Proximus, Shelter Prod, Tint, Finite Films, Northern Ireland Screen, the British Film Institute’s UK Global Screen Fund, Eurimages, Creative Europe, the Swedish Film Institute, the Film and Audiovisual Center of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation, Screen Brussels, Taxshelter.be & ING, the Tax Shelter of the Belgian Federal government, the Icelandic Film Centre, the Icelandic Tax Credit, and Nordisk Film & TV Fond.\n\t\n\n\tThe non-disclosed-substantial budget allowed him to give Mesén the means to her filmic ambition. Location scouting before development spanned 15 countries before Belfast in Northern Ireland was picked for the bulk of principal photography. “Nature in Belfast is actually quite similar to Pacific Northwest with tempered rainforest,” Yousefi told Variety. \n\n\tOne of the main challenges, he said, was building the British widower’s house – both the exteriors and interiors on location. “That has given the film a true authenticity where you go in and out of the house seamlessly,” added the producer who praised the collaborative work of Mesén with the HOD from an early stage.\n\n\t“What was key for us, was to protect Nathalie’s vision and give her full creative freedom. This is what we can achieve within the European funding model,” said the producer, as the team prepares in Sweden for the last two-day-shoot in the Göteborg area and post-production work including VFX.\n\n\tThe Swedish release will be handled by leading arthouse banner TriArt, while international distribution will soon be unveiled, said Yousefi .\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix’s planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio and streaming assets would build a $6.6 billion annual recurring revenue (ARR) across Asia Pacific and reshape global entertainment economics, according to new analysis from Media Partners Asia.\n\n\tMPA says Netflix’s standalone ARR in APAC is close to $5.5 billion, while WBD adds roughly $1.1 billion through a mix of profitable licensing and theatrical businesses. The takeover, valued at an enterprise figure of $82.7 billion, marks the streamer’s biggest strategic pivot yet — from organic builder to acquisitive consolidator — and would deliver control of deep franchise IP including DC, Harry Potter and HBO.\n\t\n\n\tBut the firm flags a looming “Licensing Cliff.” WBD currently underpins the subscription value proposition of major local platforms in India, Japan, Korea and other markets through exclusive licensing and long-running strategic partnerships. Those deals remain locked through 2027, yet MPA notes Netflix may reclaim the content post-close to reinforce its own services — a shift that would force regional streamers to rethink their programming pipelines.\n\n\n\tMPA expects local players to accelerate partnerships with NBCUniversal, Sony and Disney, while also pushing deeper bundling with Disney+ as WBD content and HBO Max transition under Netflix’s control. WBD’s business in APAC has operated as a “regional arms dealer,” relying on licensing and theatrical distribution as primary revenue engines, with direct-to-consumer still nascent outside Australia, per MPA.\n\n\tGlobally, the combined Netflix–WBD entity would generate roughly $70 billion in ARR, surpassing YouTube’s estimated $61 billion and Disney’s entertainment divisions at $58 billion, according to MPA. The deal would also merge Netflix’s 302 million global subscribers with HBO Max’s 128 million.\n\t\n\n\tStructurally, the acquisition hinges on what MPA calls the “Clean Break Mechanism,” a debt-for-debt exchange ensuring WBD retires or restructures select legacy obligations before spinning off its linear networks. The premium HBO linear pay-TV channel, however, remains with the studio assets — a high-margin cash generator Netflix would retain during the transition.\n\n\tThe report also verifies management’s projected $2–3 billion in cost synergies: an intellectual property matters agreement details Netflix’s plan to physically clone WBD’s shared software and Bolt production platform before consolidating overlapping infrastructure.\n\n\tRegulatory timing remains lengthy. While executives cite a 12–18 month horizon, the merger agreement sets an end date of March 4, 2027, extendable to Sept. 4, 2027. Netflix has committed to a $5.8 billion reverse termination fee — more than double WBD’s $2.8 billion — signalling high conviction in clearing antitrust review. MPA notes the companies’ defense will hinge on market definition: according to Nielsen’s The Gauge (October 2025), the combined entity holds under 10% of total U.S. big-screen watch time and under 30% of premium VOD usage even when excluding YouTube and linear TV.\n\n\tRisks include culture integration between Netflix’s algorithmic “Freedom and Responsibility” ethos and Warner Bros.’ relationship-driven legacy, potential distraction from a multi-year regulatory process, and capital trade-offs that could slow Netflix’s push into live sports — leaving space for Amazon and Disney to advance.\n\n\tThe merger also triggers downstream consolidation limits. A tax matters agreement imposes a two-year restriction preventing the spun-off linear networks from engaging in major M&A transactions exceeding 45% of stock, effectively sidelining those assets from further consolidation until 2028 and pressuring Paramount to pursue other strategic paths, including a potential move toward Comcast’s NBCUniversal.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” stayed on top of China’s weekend box office with RMB818.5 million ($115.3 million), driving its cumulative to RMB3.05 billion ($429 million), according to Artisan Gateway.\n\n\tDaylight Entertainment’s “Gezhi Town,” released Dec. 6, opened in second place with $23.8 million. Directed by Kong Sheng and written by Lan Xiaolong, the film tells the story of displaced civilians who, after the fall of Nanjing during wartime, resettle in a remote mountain town near Yichang only to find peace shattered when Japanese forces arrive. The lead cast includes Xiao Zhan, Zhou Yi Ran and Peng Yu Chang among others. \n\t\n\n\tAniplex’s “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle” placed third with $3.3 million, bringing its China gross to $93.4 million nearly a month into release. Directed by Sotozaki Haruo and produced by ufotable, the film adapts the climactic final arc of Gotouge Koyoharu’s blockbuster manga. Returning voice cast members include Hanae Natsuki, Kitō Akari, Shimono Hiro, and Matsuoka Yoshitsugu. The film follows the Demon Slayer Corps’ all-out assault on Kibutsuji Muzan’s stronghold in a bid to end the war between humans and demons.\n\n\n\t“Under Current,” a Hong Kong crime-thriller from Emperor Motion Pictures, opened in fourth with $1 million. Directed by Alan Mak and starring Aaron Kwok, Simon Yam and Francis Ng, the film centres on a barrister and a police officer who team up to investigate the suspicious death of a charity organisation’s finance chief — exposing corruption and money-laundering at the heart of the group. \n\t\n\n\tParamount’s “The Running Man” rounded out the top five with $600,000. \n\n\tWeekend box office totalled $147.5 million, bringing China’s 2025 year-to-date gross to $6.97 billion, up 22% from 2024.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney’s animated sequel “Zootopia 2” continued its commanding run at the Korean box office, earning $8.3 million from 1.2 million admissions over Dec. 5–7. According to KOBIS, the tracking service operated by the Korean Film Council, the film has now reached $25.7 million after 12 days in release, maintaining a 68.8% market share across 2,282 screens.\n\n\tTwo new releases battled for second and third place, finishing within a razor-thin margin.\n\t\n\n\tSouth Korean comedy-drama “The People Upstairs” opened in second place – with 129,650 admissions – with $860,207, accumulating $1.2 million across its first five days. Directed by Ha Jung-woo and starring Gong Hyo-jin, Kim Dong-wook, Lee Ha-nee and Ha Jung-woo himself, the film follows a downstairs couple driven to exhaustion by constant noise from their upstairs neighbours. A tense dinner meant to resolve the issue quickly unravels into an evening of sharp confessions and shifting dynamics.\n\n\n\tClose behind – with 121,699 admissions – Japanese action-fantasy “Jujutsu Kaisen: Shibuya Incident / Culling Game – The Movie” opened in third with $868,564, totaling $1.4 million to date. Directed by Shōta Goshozono, the film condenses the anime’s Shibuya Incident arc as Yuji Itadori and his allies face a coordinated curse attack on Halloween. The aftermath sets up the looming Culling Game and Yuta Okkotsu’s mission that puts Yuji’s fate in jeopardy.\n\n\tUniversal’s horror sequel “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” debuted in fourth with $443,394, reaching $579,771 including previews.\n\n\tRounding out the top five, South Korean crime-comedy “The Informant” added $340,783 for a $643,031 cumulative gross. Directed by Kim Seok, the film stars Heo Sung-tae and Jo Bok-rae as a compromised smuggling informant and a hapless detective who blunders into the operation. Forced into an uneasy alliance after both take substantial losses, the pair attempt to claw their way back while dismantling the criminal ring.\n\t\n\n\tSixth place went to “Wicked: For Good,” which earned $339,250, pushing its running total to $6 million.\n\n\tLionsgate’s “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” ranked seventh with $190,676, lifting its cume to $8.5 million.\n\n\tLong-running anime hit “Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc” followed in eighth with $167,599, for a robust $24.26 million total.\n\n\tJapanese Oscar contender “Kokuho” placed ninth with $85,558, reaching $924,882 overall.\n\n\tAt No. 10, South Korean drama “Concrete Market” earned $74,874 from 11,149 admissions, lifting its total to $113,711 after five days on release. Directed by Hong Ki-Won, the film stars Lee Jae-In, Hong Kyung, Jeong Man-Sik, Yoo Su-Bin and Kim Guk-Hee. Set in the aftermath of a massive earthquake, the film centers on the only apartment complex left standing — repurposed as a makeshift barter market. Residents and survivors trade goods to survive, but as supplies dwindle, a struggle for control spirals into desperate conflict. \n\n\tThe top 10 titles collectively generated $12.1 million for the weekend, compared with $13.4 million the previous frame.\n",

    "body": "\n\tStudiocanal has unveiled a first look still of Cesar-winning French actor Leïla Bekhti (“Once Upon My Mother”) in “Violette,” the next film by”Amelie” director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.\n\n\tThe movie, which wrapped shooting on location in France in September, is an adaptation of Valérie Perrin’s literary sensation “Fresh Water for Flowers” (“Changer l’eau des fleurs”), which sold over 3 million copies worldwide. One of the French-language highlights of Studiocanal’s 2026 slate, the movie also stars Matthias Schoenaerts (“Rust and Bone”), Melvil Poupaud (“Jeanne du Barry”), Anouk Grinberg (“The Innocent”), Sergio Castellitto (“Conclave”), Alban Lenoir (“Lost Bullet”), as well as Elodie Batard Gaultier who is pictured above with Bekhti. \n\t\n\n\tBekhti (who’s recently earned critical acclaim in France for her emotional performance in “Once Upon My Mother”) plays Violette Toussaint, a cemetery caretaker in a small town in Burgundy, who a compassionate listener. “Her peaceful life is filled by conversations with quirky cemetery workers and the many visitors who share their stories of love, loss, and life. However, her routine is disrupted when a local police chief arrives at her door with an unusual request. As they grow closer, Violette comes to understand that the truth behind long-buried mysteries in her past must be uncovered if she wants to take another chance on life and, against all odds, love,” the synopsis reads. Jeunet co-wrote the script with Guillaume Laurant, whose credits include Jeunet’s cult films, from “Amelie” to “The City of Lost Children” and “A Very Long Engagement.”\n\t\n\n\t“Violette” is produced by two Mediawan labels — Carlo Degli Esposti and Nicola Serra at Palomar (“Piranhas,” “The Count of Monte Cristo”), and Thibault Gast and Matthias Weber at 24 25 Films (“Black Box,” “Kabul”).\n\n\tStudiocanal is co-producing the film, handling international sales, and distributing it directly in key territories including France, the U.K., Benelux, Germany, Austria, Poland, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

He jokes he even thought he killed the beloved Royal Shakespeare Company as a result.\n      \n    \n          Obviously, it's all just a silly superstition ... and, Bailey's career hasn't suffered too much because of his mistake -- since he's receiving pretty much universal praise for his performance as Fiyero in \"Wicked\" and its sequel \"Wicked: For Good.\"\n      \n    \n          Still, Bailey may want to watch his words going forward ... 'cause you never knew which witches might be listening 👀.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                You Might Want to Rethink\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

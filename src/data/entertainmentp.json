    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump on Sunday confirmed he recently met with Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos at the White House to discuss the Warner Bros. Discovery deal — and said the market share of a combined Netflix with WB and HBO Max “could be a problem.”\n\n\tTrump, speaking with reporters on the red carpet of the Kennedy Center Honors event in Washington, D.C., said Netflix’s deal to acquire Warner Bros. studios and streaming business will require a review, and said, “I’ll be involved in that decision.” \n\t\n\n\tTrump is upending decades of tradition with his decision to host Sunday’s 48th Kennedy Center Honors ceremony, where the honorees are Sylvester Stallone, KISS members Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, singer-actor Michael Crawford, country superstar George Strait and disco diva Gloria Gaynor. He told the crowd gathered for the most prestigious event on Washington’s arts calendar that he didn’t know why he decided to host. \n\n\n\t“I’m acting like Johnny Carson,” Trump quipped. In typical fashion, befitting his roots as a real estate developer, Trump also declared, “We’re bringing this building back to life.” Trump was quick to execute a top-to-bottom makeover of Kennedy Center staff this past spring, after his odds-defying return to the White House. \n\n\tOn the red carpet, Trump said that the government review of Netflix’s proposed $83 billion deal for Warner Bros., which was announced Friday, must “go through a process, and we’ll see what happens.”\n\n\tAccording to Trump, Sarandos visited the Oval Office last week. The Netflix exec is “a fantastic man,” the president said. “I have a lot of respect for him, but it’s a lot of market share.”\n\t\n\n\tTrump also said of Sarandos, “He’s a great person… He’s got a lot of interesting things happening aside from what you’re talking about, but it is a big market share. There’s no question about it. It could be a problem.”\n\n\tThe blockbuster pact would add HBO Max to Netflix’s already massive customer base of more than 300 million. As of the end of Q3, Warner Bros. Discovery reported 128.0 million streaming subscribers, which includes HBO Max as well as Discovery+ and its sports-streaming services.\n\n\tThe Netflix deal for Warner Bros. is both a horizontal merger between rival streaming services and a vertical merger, adding a massive distribution pipeline for Warner Bros. content. It could also shrink the marketplace for content producers. \n\n\tThe Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are expected to review the Netflix-WB deal. The FCC is not expected to play a role in reviewing the transaction because of the nature of assets involved; WBD does not own broadcast TV stations or cable systems.\n\n\tSarandos, speaking on a call with Wall Street analysts Friday, expressed optimism that the deal will clear regulatory approval. Netflix and WBD projected the deal will close in 12-18 months. \n\n\t“[We are] really confident that we’re going to get all the necessary approvals that we need,” Sarandos told analysts. “This deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it’s pro-creator, it’s pro-growth.”\n\n\tExecs routinely point out on Netflix earnings calls that even in its most mature markets, including the U.S., Netflix represents less than 10% of total TV viewing. Sarandos, in his meeting with Trump, conveyed to the president that even combined with Warner Bros. and HBO Max, Netflix would grow to be about as big as Google’s YouTube in the U.S. — and would still have less TV market share than other media conglomerates, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\n\tThe Safer Bet: Why David Zaslav and the WBD Board Favored Netflix in a Turbulent Time for Legacy Hollywood\n",

Apple’s “F1” leans on the visceral roar of engines and the physics of velocity, elevating what could have been standard sports bombast into a textured experience.\n\n\tUniversal’s “Wicked: For Good” showcases how musically driven films can compete with the loudest blockbusters (although the CCA snub for best sound stings a little).\n\n\tFranchise-heavy contenders also loom large. Paramount’s final installment of Ethan Hunt’s ongoing missions, “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,” and 20th Century Studios’ latest look at the world of Pandora, “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” arrive with trademark sonic ambition. Tactile stunt environments define the former, while the latter, shaped by veteran artisans, is determined by the aural ecosystems of water and fire.\n\n\tEven character-driven dramas like A24’s “Marty Supreme” and 20th’s “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” remind voters that quiet can be competitive when it’s emotionally calibrated.\n\n\tWatch out for Apple’s “The Lost Bus” and Netflix’s “Frankenstein” — both of which add intrigue and a level of passion that can occupy the branch members. \n\n\tOscars shortlist voting begins Dec. 8.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited artisans are subject to change, and are ultimately determined by the Academy.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Apple TV+\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Ross Ferguson\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Artisans (Best Sound)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Filmes da Ermida, Cannes Film Festival\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

It’s an incredible reimagining of gothic horror that’s anchored in the physicality of ships and machinery. \n\n\tOscar winner Hannah Beachler (“Black Panther”) and Monique Champagne’s work on Ryan Coogler’s “Singers” immerses viewers in a textured 1930s milieu, blending historical authenticity with heightened, morally charged atmosphere. \n\n\tMarvel’s “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” adds a different dimension, offering a retro-futurist canvas where past and future collide through the sleek, stylized environments of Kasra Farahani and Jille Azis.\n\n\tThe category widens beyond the most obvious. \n\n\tUniversal’s “Wicked: For Good” is the reigning champion from last year, showcasing Nathan Crowley and Lee Sandales’ vibrant expansion of Oz. At the same time, A24’s “Marty Supreme” finds the still Oscar-less Jack Fisk and Adam Willis grounding a character study in minimalist yet evocative 1950s New York City.\n\n\tEpic world-building continues with James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” from Dylan Cole, Ben Procter and Vanessa Cole, and Focus Features’ “Hamnet,” constructed by Fiona Crombie and Alice Felton’s intimate, Tudor-period textures. \n\n\tThere will be more to come on this front.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited artisans are subject to change, and are ultimately determined by the Academy.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Warner Bros.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Searchlight Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Artisans (Best Production Design)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©MGM/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tKristen Stewart is weighing in on the Method acting debate.\n\n\t“The Chronology of Water” director recently told the New York Times that acting is by nature “quite embarrassing and unmasculine,” and that going Method is a way for some male actors to temper the “inherently vulnerable” side of being a performer.\n\n\t“Performance is inherently vulnerable and therefore quite embarrassing and unmasculine,” Stewart said. “There’s no bravado in suggesting that you’re a mouthpiece for someone else’s ideas. It’s inherently submissive. Have you ever heard of a female actor that was method?”\n\t\n\n\tThe comment was part of a larger conversation about Marlon Brando’s famous mispronunciation of “Krpton” in 1978’s “Superman.” The interviewer recalled Sean Penn, who knew Brando, saying it was his way of maintaining integrity while appearing in a “sellout movie.” Stewart said that men in Hollywood are often “aggrandized for retaining self” while women don’t get the same treatment.\n\n\t“Brando sounds like a hero, doesn’t he? If a woman did that, it would be different,” she said. “If you have to do 50 push-ups before your close-up or refuse to say a word a certain way — I mean, Brando, [expletive], I’m not coming for him.”\n\n\tShe continued. “There’s a common act that happens before the acting happens on set: If they can protrude out of the vulnerability and feel like a gorilla pounding their chest before they cry on camera, it’s a little less embarrassing. It also makes it seem like a magic trick, like it is so impossible to do what you’re doing that nobody else could do it.”\n\t\n\n\tStewart then recalled a conversation that reaffirmed her belief that actresses aren’t given the same liberties when it comes to their craft.\n\n\tShe explained, “I asked a fellow actor: ‘Have you ever met a female actor that was method and needed to scream and do a whole thing?’ As soon as I said, ‘male actor, female actor,’ the reaction was like, ‘Do not mention the elephant in the room.’ And he goes, ‘Oh, actresses are crazy.'”\n\n\tRead Stewart’s entire New York Times profile here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from Season 2, Episode 4 of “Landman,” “Dancing Rainbows,” which premiered Sunday, Dec. 7, on Paramount+.\n\n\tRebecca Falcone is one of the most no-nonsense characters on “Landman”: A tough-as-nails lawyer who not only wants to keep up with her larger-than-life opponents in the oil game, but beat them into submission as well. That’s why it was fun to see her have a romantic spark with oil guy Charlie (Guy Burnet) on a turbulent private plane ride. While it’s great to see her crush opponents in the boardroom, seeing a softer side of the character opens her up to new dimensions and possibilities on the show.\n\t\n\n\tKayla Wallace, who plays Rebecca, told Variety she didn’t realize going into this season that audiences would see her character’s private life in this way.\n\n\n\t“We were receiving scripts as we went along this season, so I didn’t know what to expect,” Wallace said. “I had no idea what was coming. That was so much fun, too, because every script that you get, you’re reading it like the audience, and having to shift and mess around with the way you’re playing things, because you have this new information coming.”\n\n\tDespite Charlie being a charming hunk, Wallace said she was also intrigued by their plane connection, as they are such different personalities.\n\n\t“He’s got this energy that is so opposite from the way she is, and especially in that situation, when they hop on the plane, and her anxiety starts to ramp up, he’s the cool cucumber that she needs, and he’s sitting right there,” she said. “It’s pretty funny that these two opposites are placed right next to each other and experiencing what Rebecca thinks is a disaster. For him, it’s just another day on the job.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen it came to the pair’s hungover and barely dressed morning after hooking up, Wallace said the flirty scene pushed Rebecca out of her routine.\n\n\t“It’s a very uncomfortable situation for her, but she’s so strong that she can handle it,” she said. “With Rebecca, for all of her career, she has had success at the very top of any priority over anything in her life. When she lets her guard down and ends up in this situation, it’s a bit jarring for her. It’s so much fun because you get to explore these new sides of her. ‘How would she react in this situation?’ As an actor, getting to play these vulnerable sides to her is a lot of fun as well, because it makes her more human.”\n\n\tUltimately, Wallace said this new chapter for Rebecca is just the latest great twist from “Landman” co-creator Taylor Sheridan, who has written every episode of the series.\n\n\t“I love how strong he writes all of his women, and how beautifully loud they are in who they are,” she said. “He writes these women who are unapologetically themselves. We’ve got such a range on our show, too. Such different types of women, and they’re all so strong in their own way, but so different from one another. I’m honored I get to play a character that Taylor has written, because all of his female parts are written with so much strength.”\n\n\tRelive Rebecca and Charlie’s chaotic meet-cute in the clip below.\n\n\n\n",

There’s a lot of regret, but it ends on a high note with a new family connection being forged AND one of our main characters getting laid! Read on to analyze all of this week’s big moments, from the cemetery to the bedroom.\n\t\n\n\nThe Georgia Satellites’ “Keep Your Hands to Yourself” is the perfect one-hit wonder. It makes me want to get in a bar brawl just hearing it start the episode.\nThe “Landman” team always films a convincing auto accident. What a mess!\nWhy didn’t Cooper (Jacob Lofland) sleep in his truck instead of on the ground?\n“I want you everywhere.” Ah, OK, Cooper, that’s kinda cute. You’re winning her back!\nI’m glad I’m an old married man and not on the dating scene. Ariana (Paulina Chávez) told Cooper to leave, so he left, but she wanted him to fight for her, but he didn’t because he was giving her space…I’m not saying anyone’s feelings are wrong, but just communicate directly here, people! It’s exhausting!\nOh no, now I’m worried that Dale (James Jordan) is accidentally going to OD on Adderall!\nOoh, who is this hunk sitting next to Rebecca (Kayla Wallace) on the private plane? \nNothing snarky to say about Cami talking to her husband’s grave — as usual, Demi Moore is fantastic on this show. Emmy, please!\nVery fun seeing the always-poised Rebecca lose her shit and make a scene on this turbulent flight. Plus, you gotta love some unintentional flirting!\nThe look Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton) gives when Angela (Ali Larter) suggests her “Sexy Salsa” playlist for the road trip is comedy gold.\nThornton’s knack for delivering profanity is top-tier. Please enjoy how he makes a meal out of the word “f-UCK-ing” in the phrase “We’re driving to a fucking funeral!” That’s acting!\nAngela and Ainsley (Michelle Randolph) always calling Nate “Neil” is a wonderful running gag.\nAsking, “Who are these fucking clowns?” is a great way to meet new people.\nDamn, I bet the food at a roadside place called “The Bucket” is so good. And those corn dogs would be calling my name as well…\nTommy’s story about his mother is so sad that I’d barely be able to finish my corn dogs!\nCrying while T.L. (Sam Elliott) tells the sprinkler rainbow story.\nWasted Rebecca seems like a fun hang!\nUh oh, Tommy is going to flip when he learns that Cami met with Gallino (Andy Garcia) and potentially put the company at further risk.\nObsessed with Gallino’s relationship with Bella (Stefania Spampinato). Is this the healthiest marriage that’s ever been on a Taylor Sheridan show?\nI don’t think I really understood Gallino’s snakes and hawks metaphor, but hey, they made a deal!\nWhat an awful turn for Jerrell (Elijah Collins) after that gas leak. I hope he gets better!\n“Save the Last Dance” as Ainsley’s comfort movie is a great choice.\nOh, no — this SIDS tragic backstory explains so much.\nAh, Rebecca — it’s OK that you had some fun! Embrace it!\nYay, grandpa’s moving in! Let’s shake things up!\n“I’m not sure I deserve this.” Oh, OK … one last cry before we wrap things up.\n\n\n\n\tUntil next time, comment below with your favorite thing about Rebecca’s sexy new oil guy, Charlie (Guy Burnet). It’s his array of bathroom products, right?\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘SNL’: Watch Dijon Perform ‘Higher!,’ ‘Another Baby!’ From Latest Album\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrancis Ford Coppola’s F.P.

    "body": "\n\tThere was one thing Francesca Scorsese wasn’t comfortable doing when she directed an episode for her father’s Fox Nation series “Martin Scorsese Presents: The Saints” about Saint Carlo Acutis.\n\n\tAcutis, an Italian teen known for being a devout Catholic and promoting the religion on the internet, was only 15 when he died of leukemia in 2006. Known as the first millennial saint, he was canonized in 2015.\n\n\n\tFrancesca was given the option of filming the body of Acutis, which is entombed and on display in a glass coffin in Assisi, Italy. “It was slightly disturbing because it’s a young boy. They put this silicone mask over him, and he looks perfectly preserved,” she tells me. “It looks like a young boy sleeping, like one of my friends, and he’s in a tracksuit and sneakers. … There was a bit of a point of contention on whether or not we were going to film his body. After I left his body, I was like, ‘No, we can’t. It just feels so wrong.’ So we used a very slight amount of stock footage for that as not to disrupt the peace in there.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Fox Nation\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrancesca’s childhood was a religious one. “I had my communion, I had my confirmation. I would go to the classes to get through all that,” she remembers. “I’d go to church. I’d pray every night. My dad would read me the Bible like a bedtime story sometimes.”\n\n\tBut Francesca’s faith began to wane in her teenage years, especially as she witnessed her mother Helen’s battle with Parkinson’s disease. “I often found myself asking, ‘Why does God do bad things to good people, or let bad things happen to good people?’” she says. “My mom was a big point of struggle for me as I got older and that got a lot worse. As it started to become a very prevalent thing in my life, I think that’s a big part of why I sort of drifted away from my beliefs.”\n\t\n\n\tFrancesca’s directing credits include three shorts. She’s also an actress, best known for her work in Luca Guadagnino’s HBO series “We Are Who We Are,” and has served as a creative director on various commercial projects. About two years ago, she and her father became viral hits for their joint videos Francesca posted on TikTok.  \n\n\tWhile filming “Saints” episode — it premieres Sunday, Dec. 7 on Fox Nation — she would send dailies to her father, who serves as the series narrator as well as an executive producer. “I would get a call or a text, and he’d be like, ‘These rushes look great,’” Francesca recalls. “I was never really given any notes until I was in post-production. I mean, everything he said was completely valid.”\n\n\tFrancesca acknowledges that she’s a so-called “nepo-baby”: “I got this obviously because my dad was overseeing everything as the executive producer. I’m not going to deny anything. I’m honored to be given an opportunity like this, and I’m going to do my best.”\n\n\tFrancesca admits she had “some hesitation” working on a Fox Nation project because of the politics associated with Fox. “But I know how my dad feels with everything,” she says. “I feel pretty much the same way as he does in terms of politics and everything, and I look up to him, and I really follow in his footsteps a lot of the time. But Fox was the only one that supported this project and that wanted to bring this project to life. I think there’s something to say about that.”\n\n\tNext up, Francesca will direct “Adults,” a dark comedy short about her mom’s childhood. “My mom grew up in Paris, and her dad was at the American embassy there,” she said. “It’s a father-daughter story.”\n\n\tThe Scorseses will spend Christmas Eve at home with family. “We’ll have dinner and open gifts,” Francesca says. New Year’s Eve will be spent at Martin Scorsese’s office: “We’ll watch a movie and then watch the fireworks on TV. We have some champagne, maybe cater some Nobu.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTed Sarandos scored a critical sit-down with President Donald Trump in the weeks leading up to Netflix‘s successful $82.7 billion agreement to buy Warner Bros. and HBO Max, according to sources familiar with the confab. The meeting, which took place in the Oval Office and lasted for more than an hour, occurred on Nov. 24.\n\n\tThe conversation was intended to cover a range of topics, including the possibility of a federal film tax incentive. However, sources say, much of the talk was about Netflix’s bid for Warner Bros. and HBO Max. A spokesperson for Netflix declined to comment. \n\t\n\n\tSarandos’ meeting with Trump was initially reported by Bloomberg, which said that the Netflix co-CEO left the gathering with “the impression” the streamer “wouldn’t face immediate opposition [to its Warner Bros. bid] from the White House.” Netflix still needs to obtain regulatory approval for the purchase, with critics, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, already raising antitrust concerns.\n\n\n\tThey are joined by many parts of the creative community. Although some figures, including Oscar-winners Sean Baker and Jane Fonda, have raised concerns about the deal, several A-list filmmakers and producers are discussing releasing an open letter opposing the sale, sources say. They are worried that by swallowing up Warner Bros., the streamer will take one of the biggest theatrical distributors off the board, imperiling the financial health of cinemas. However, many of these artists also have projects at Netflix or deals with the company and worry about blowback. The hope is that they can attract enough signatories that there will be safety in numbers.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix outmaneuvered Paramount-Skydance, which had been heavily favored to buy Warner Bros. because of David Ellison’s family ties to the president and enormous wealth, as well as Comcast, which also made a bid. Paramount-Skydance has signaled that it may take legal action, accusing Warner Bros. of running an unfair bidding process. \n\n\tSarandos and his wife, former U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas Nicole Avant, have hosted several Democratic fundraisers over the years, including for former President Joe Biden. But Sarandos has made overtures to Trump’s world. Late last year, the Netflix chief made the trek to Mar-a-Lago to have dinner with Trump ahead of his inauguration.\n\n\tWhile speaking to CNN at the Kennedy Center Honors, Trump confirmed that he recently spoke with Sarandos and called him “a great person.” He also asserted that he will “be involved” with the decision to either approve or block the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal. \n\n\tIn an interview with Variety last spring, Sarandos declined to give details about their meeting, calling it a “private” meal. Asked if he would ever do a creative project with the Trumps, as the company has done with former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, whose Higher Ground has a deal with Netflix, Sarandos demurred.\n\n\t“I don’t know what he does creatively,” he said. “He’s got his hands full.”\n",

Courtesy of Sundance Institute.(2025) Credit: A24\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Commentary (Updated: Dec. 7, 2025): Awards season volatility is starting to look like the defining theme of 2025, but one constant has emerged across the early precursors: “One Battle After Another” is not slowing down. Paul Thomas Anderson’s epic has now swept major critics’ groups — including Los Angeles, New York and the National Board of Review. With Anderson picking up multiple directing prizes and Teyana Taylor and Benicio del Toro scoring in supporting races, the Warner Bros. juggernaut has become the season’s gravitational force.\n\n\tBut the critics haven’t anointed a single narrative, at least in the acting races. Ethan Hawke’s transformative work in “Blue Moon” earned LAFCA’s gender-neutral lead prize, pushing him firmly into best actor contention opposite heavyweights Leonardo DiCaprio (“One Battle After Another”) and Timothée Chalamet (“Marty Supreme”). Rose Byrne, meanwhile, continues her astonishing sweep, winning NBR, NYFCC and LAFCA for “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” and placing her on the doorstep of her first Oscar nomination.\n\n\tInternational cinema is rewriting the board with Wagner Moura’s surge for “The Secret Agent,” and Jafar Panahi’s continued dominance with “It Was Just an Accident” signal that multiple Neon titles could crowd the international feature lineup, unless a surprise challenger sneaks through.\n\n\tWith the crafts races tightening (and Oscar shortlist voting getting ready to kick off on Monday, Dec. 8), we find “Train Dreams” is gaining momentum in cinematography, with “Sirāt” emerging as an original score spoiler if voters get to it in time.\n\n\tThe first chart projections for production design and sound are below.\n\n\tTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (films): “One Battle After Another” (14); “Sinners” (13); “Hamnet” (10); “Frankenstein” (9); “Wicked: For Good” (8)\n\n\tTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (studios): Warner Bros.

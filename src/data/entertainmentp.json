    "body": "\n\tIndian digital star and actor Anushka Sen is expanding her creative portfolio with her first foray into music, with debut single “Chameleon.”\n\n\tThe pop track pairs Sen’s vocal debut with the production expertise of Ken Lewis, a two-time Grammy Award winner and eight-time nominee whose credits include work with Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West. Lewis has contributed to 79 Billboard No. 1 hits throughout his career.\n\n\n\tSen commands a substantial social media presence with nearly 40 million followers across platforms. The 21-year-old began her entertainment career as a child actor on Indian television before transitioning to digital content creation. In 2024, she made her streaming debut in Prime Video’s coming-of-age series “Dil Dosti Dilemma,” earning praise for her performance in the original production.\n\t\n\n\tThe single was recorded during a recent trip to the U.S., with Lewis crafting what’s described as a pop anthem reflecting Sen’s artistic evolution. The track explores themes of transformation and self-definition, drawing on Sen’s background in music, which she studied from childhood under her mother’s guidance.\n\n\t“Music has always been a part of my life, but I never imagined I’d have the courage to actually create something of my own and share it with the world,” Sen said. “‘Chameleon’ was born out of a very personal space – it’s about evolution, identity, and not letting the world define you.”\n\n\tShe continued: “I’ve always been someone who likes doing things differently, whether it’s my work or the choices I make. People often expect you to stay in one lane, to keep doing what you’re known for, but I’ve for one never believed in that.”\n\t\n\n\tThe artist cited her Bengali heritage as an influence on her multidisciplinary approach to creativity, encompassing dance, music and acting. “Being a Bengali it’s been super inspiring for me to be able to immerse myself in different forms of art,” she said. “Through this new journey I’ll be able to learn and be able to merge everything and create something new.”\n\n\t“Chameleon” will be available worldwide on Nov. 18, with an audio version releasing first.\n",

While beloved by some, “Chess” is a famously messy musical, particularly due to Rice’s confused book, which has been reworked too many times to count. Songs have been moved, added, cut, or reassigned. Settings (both locations and years) have been altered. Characters have been expanded, removed, or significantly tweaked. The ending (particularly for Florence) has gone through numerous versions, each with completely different meanings and messages. Even seemingly core and essential details, like who wins the chess matches, have been changed across productions. \n\t\n\n\tThis revival represents director Michael Mayer and Strong’s third stab at the material, having previously worked on it in 2018 and 2022. Among Strong’s larger changes is altering the timeline and providing some wider historical context, setting the first act amidst the SALT II treaty negotiations and the second act culminating with the Abel Archer 83 military exercises. In theory, this should work, and in the first act, it basically does. The second act premise, though, goes off the rails: the various shifting allegiances become convoluted and the idea that the US and USSR were ready to blow each other up with nuclear weapons based on the outcome of a chess match is absurd. The stakes are unnaturally high, with a countdown to world destruction — but then nothing happens. No bombing occurs. What’s more, the book has been pored over, snipped, and revised so often that there remain remnants of earlier versions, such as lines referencing moments that have been cut or motifs that never get resolved. \n\t\n\n\tRegardless of the version, there is a compelling human drama at the center of “Chess,” floating atop some killer songs and an often gorgeous score. In its sweeping musical moments (“Nobody’s Side,” “Anthem,” “I Know Him So Well,” “Someone Else’s Story,” and the catchy but dated “One Night in Bangkok”), it’s easy to see why “Chess” has diehard fans. However, there’s so much else that brings everything down: clunky plotting, nonsensical character motivations, and, here, a useless ensemble. Mayer has the chorus thrash about in a mob and sit onstage all of act one, but then completely forgets about them for act two. We might have been better off without these useless pawns. \n\n\tAs soon as the overture begins, this revival feels less like a Broadway production and more like City Center Encores! concert. The cast is stacked but there’s no set to speak of, beyond some stairs that house the onstage orchestra, a row of banquet benches, and several columns filled with lawn chess pieces. The back wall features some very on-the-nose projections, including the domes of St. Basil’s in Moscow, American and Soviet flags, and an oft-repeated photo of a child being hoisted over a wall. The costumes are entirely nondescript, with the leads in black and white, and the chorus in grey double-breasted suits. The lighting design is occasionally effective, other than several strips of thin, chintzy LED light strips that rotate between blue and red. \n\n\tThe production seems to have no faith that the audience will remember this is a Cold War musical, so it constantly reminds us in the projections, lighting, and in the speeches of the character known as the Arbiter (played by Bryce Pinkham). As our narrator, the Arbiter here is an annoyingly metatheatrical figure, who quips to the audience, praising Michele’s singing, apologizing for Tveit’s character’s last name sounding like Trump (“remember this show was originally written in 1984”), constantly referencing the fact that we’re watching a musical, and making cringy attempts at topical jokes about RFK Jr.’s brain worm and Joe Biden’s decision to run for re-election. Pinkham comes across as pesky and tiresome, though this is mostly the fault of Mayer’s direction and Strong’s writing. \n\t\n\n\tDespite this revival of “Chess” making some wrong moves, it always remembers that the queen is the most powerful piece, wisely letting Michele shine like the star she is. Unlike in “Funny Girl,” in which she was perpetually the center of attention, here she has to share the stage more, and does so with humility and aplomb. Never overpowering or scene stealing, Michele has a commanding presence, and finds the depths of pain, longing, and conflict in her character. She is an undeniable grandmaster, with the rare combination of perfect technique, clarion tone, vocal power, and exemplary emoting skills. This performance solidifies that Michele is back on Broadway, hopefully for a long time — and we are certainly lucky to have her. Her rendition of “Nobody’s Side” is so superb it will make you wish we still had encores on Broadway. \n\n\tTveit is as talented as always, and his hair is as mesmerizingly coiffed, but sadly he doesn’t have much to do, especially in the second act. His voice is intoxicating and he’s clearly having fun with the role, but as the show progresses, his presence becomes superfluous, with Strong relying on increasingly unrealistic reasons to keep him around. Freddie is not well developed or nuanced, flipping between asshole antics and depressive paranoia. Tveit tries his best, but he fades a bit compared to Michele and Chrisopher. \n\n\tOf our three leads, Christopher may be the only non-household name, but he gives an impressive performance. He captures the cynical and suicidal pain of Anatoly, a child chess prodigy ripped from his family and turned into a Soviet robot, who now must confront what he wants in life, if he can love, and how he feels about his mother country. Christopher’s singing is quite powerful, too, especially his “Anthem,” but his key achievement is proving that acting and character work are vital to nailing this role.  \n\n\tSean Allan Krill as Walter, the CIA operative, and Bradley Dean as Molokov, the KGB chess mentor, serviceably represent feuding factions and come off as equally slimy. Rounding out the principal cast is the usually lovely Hannah Cruz as Svetlana (Anatoly’s wife) in a rare misstep. Despite using a Russian accent in her dialogue, she makes no attempt to sing with it, a confounding and distracting choice (made especially stark because Dean and Christopher expertly speak and sing with Russian accents). \n\t\n\n\tFor a musical about chess, this revival ironically doesn’t seem very interested in the game itself. This production has two chess matches, and in both the players stand at microphones narrating their moves in monotone voices (“Pawn to E6,” “Knight to F3”), thus rendering the matches in an entirely nontheatrical and nonvisual manner. For those unfamiliar with chess or unable to imagine the board, pieces, and moves in their head, the crucial matches are impossible to follow. Mayer and Strong seem exclusively invested in the symbolism of the Cold War as a chess battle, so they don’t let us see and understand the contours of the actual chess matches. \n\n\tAlas, the debate of whether “Chess” can be saved or fixed must continue, for this is likely not the best iteration of the material. What Florence sings rings true for “Chess” overall: “I’ve still a lot to prove; there must be more I could achieve.” There’s so much potential, it’s hard not to continually yearn for a version of “Chess” that fully works. \n\n\tAlthough this “Chess” match may not have produced a new champion, there’s still some thrilling gameplay, especially from Michele and Christopher, who help provide insight into the magic of “Chess” and make this sometimes uneven game still feel entirely worth watching. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFCC Chairman Shares Trump Post Calling for NBC to Fire Seth Meyers ‘Immediately’\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMeet Strangelove, the Cult-Favorite Fragrance House Powered by Oud\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder Armour’s CEO Just Did the Thing He ‘Couldn’t Imagine’\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tFarhan Akhtar‘s war epic “120 Bahadur” is set to make exhibition history as the first film to release across India’s defense theater network, reaching over 800 cinema halls serving the country’s military community when it opens on Nov. 21.\n\n\tThe film centers on the Battle of Rezang La, the 1962 conflict in which 120 Indian soldiers of Charlie Company, 13 Kumaon Regiment, fought Chinese forces at an altitude of over 16,000 feet in Ladakh, with 114 soldiers killed in action. \n\t\n\n\tAkhtar stars alongside Raashii Khanna, Sparsh Walia, Vivan Bhatena, Dhanveer Singh, Digvijay Pratap, Sahib Verma, Ankit Siwach, Devendra Ahirwar, Ashutosh Shukla, Brijesh Karanwal, Atul Singh, Ajinkya Deo and Eijaz Khan.\n\n\n\tDirected by Razneesh “Razy” Ghai, “120 Bahadur” is produced by Ritesh Sidhwani and Akhtar’s Excel Entertainment alongside Amit Chandrra’s Trigger Happy Studios.\n\n\tThe rollout, spearheaded by PictureTime in partnership with GenSync Brat Media, will screen exclusively for defense personnel and their families, bridging what organizers describe as a long-standing gap between the entertainment industry and India’s armed forces.\n\n\t“There are 1.5 million active soldiers and over six million viewers. But only 30% of India’s 20-million strong veteran and family audience has access to defense cinemas,” said Sushil Chaudhary, founder-CEO of PictureTime. “We aim to expand the ecosystem to additionally reach the underserved 70% and we begin with a bang with ‘120 Bahadur,’ a film we know will deeply resonate with the forces.”\n\n\tThe initiative leverages PictureTime’s mobile cinema network to deliver theatrical experiences to soldiers and families stationed in remote regions across the country.\n\t\n\n\t“‘120 Bahadur’ honors the courage and sacrifice of our armed forces,” said Vishal Ramchandani, CEO of Excel Entertainment. “We feel truly privileged that the soldiers whose spirit the film celebrates will be watching it with their families. Our sincere thanks to PictureTime for facilitating this screening for those who serve the nation.”\n\n\tExcel Entertainment and Trigger Happy Studios are also rolling out select paid previews on Nov. 18 to commemorate the 63rd anniversary of the battle. The strategy aims to build early word-of-mouth three days ahead of the film’s Nov. 21 opening, honoring the 120 soldiers while allowing early audience reactions to drive conversation ahead of release.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLionsgate’s “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” swiped the top spot on global box office charts with $75.5 million. The film, which also took first place in the domestic marketplace, earned $54.2 million internationally from 64 territories. \n\n\tReleased nearly a decade after the previous entry in the series, the third “Now You See Me” performed well with foreign ticket buyers. Some of the highest-grossing territories include China ($19.2 million), South Korea ($3.9 million), France ($3.5 million) and the U.K. ($3.2 million). Ruben Fleischer directed “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” and the film brought back franchise mainstays Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco as a band of Robin Hood-like illusionists. The movie cost $90 million to produce. \n\t\n\n\tSony’s “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle” opened in China with a hefty $52.4 million debut. It now ranks as the fifth highest-grossing film of 2025, having earned nearly $730 million.  \n\n\tParamount’s “The Running Man,” an R-rated adaptation of Stephen King’s dystopian novel, collapsed at the global box office. After stumbling with a $17 million domestic launch, the film eked out an international gross of $11.2 million from 58 international markets. That’s a disastrous result given “The Running Man’s” $110 million budget. The film was directed by Edgar Wright, who previously helmed “Baby Driver” and “Shaun of the Dead,” and stars Glen Powell. Top markets for “The Running Man” included the U.K. ($3.3 million), Germany ($1.1 million) and Australia ($1 million). \n\t\n\n\tAnd Warner Bros.’ “One Battle After Another” crossed the $200 million mark at the global box office after earning another $1.4 million internationally. The thriller was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Chase Infiniti. It earned some of the year’s best reviews, but its $140 million budget makes it one of 2025’s bigger flops. Theater owners keep half of ticket sales, and Warner Bros. spent tens of millions on top of production costs to market the picture, putting it deeply in the hole.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 1, Episode 4 of “It: Welcome to Derry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tTaylour Paige first appears as Charlotte Hanlon in the second episode of HBO’s “It: Welcome to Derry.” While the Hanlon family plays a major role in Stephen King’s original novel and the 2017 and 2019 “It” films, Charlotte is an original character on the show. The wife of Major Leroy Hanlon (Jovan Adepo) and mother of Will Hanlon (James Cameron Blake), she arrives in Derry with her son after the military moved Leroy from Louisiana to Maine. Across Episodes 2 and 3, we learn about her background and values, how she was active in the Civil Rights movement down south and found community through activism.\n\t\n\n\tNow settled in Maine, Charlotte is more isolated, and the opportunities for activism do not present themselves in the same ways. In Episode 4, we get to see Charlotte in action, as she takes an interest in Hank Grogan’s (Stephen Rider) case, figuring out that he’s a scapegoat for the town’s missing children and acknowledging that racism persists in the North. While much of “Welcome to Derry” is fantastical and paranormal, exploring topics like racism and trauma through a lens of supernatural horror, Charlotte navigates Derry’s more grounded horrors and the realities of its 1962 setting.\n\n\n\tVariety spoke with Paige about her role, her fear of scary stories and the joy of creating a family on set.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you end up getting the role of Charlotte Hanlon on “Welcome to Derry”?\t\n\n\tI met with Andy and Barbara on a Sunday in February 2023. We had a call that was almost two hours of us just connecting and them explaining the world they were building with the show. I knew that they had the success with the films. And I’m not a big horror person, so full disclosure, I had never seen the films because I literally am scared. But I just had a good feeling about them, and I was right. I love them.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHave you since watched “It: Chapter 1” and “It: Chapter 2”?\t\n\n\tI’m gonna do it. I’m gonna finish our show, and then I’ll watch “Chapter 1” and “2” in order.\n\t\n\t\tHave you read the book by Stephen King?\t\n\n\tOh no, no, no. My imagination is too wild. I’m a big reader, but I’m so sensitive when I read.\n\t\n\t\tAlthough the Hanlon family is very present in the source material, Charlotte is an original character in “Welcome to Derry.” Do you know who created her and how?\t\n\n\tAndy and Barbara created her, but I never asked how or why. I didn’t go too deep on the genesis, but obviously, we need a woman to give birth to this family, right? We need the parents of Mike Hanlon, so first we need Charlotte.\n\t\n\t\tBeing a wife and mother is definitely a big part of Charlotte’s story. How was it building that dynamic with Jovan Adepo and Blake Cameron James as your on-screen husband and son, respectively?\t\n\n\tI love Jovan and I love Blake. I think we very quickly felt like a family. Jovan takes the craft really seriously, and Blake is just an incredible young talent who is very interested and curious. He’s a sweetie pie from the South, so he is always like, “Yes, ma’am” and “No ma’am.” It’s funny, because I’m like, “I’m not old. You can literally just call me Taylour.” It’s so cute. Jovan is just incredibly talented and funny. We bickered a lot, but in a jokey way. From the time we met, we were laughing. Jovan also made us a playlist. We had Sam Cooke on there and Fitzgerald, and good jazz. We gave ourselves a story and created a bit of familiarity between us, so that it felt like two people who met when they were 14 and got married young and had a son and have had to move a lot. I think it works.\n\t\n\t\tCharlotte is, of course, far more than just a wife or mother. In Episode 4, we get to see her in action, trying to help Hank Grogan prove his innocence. Did you enjoy playing this Civil Rights detective?\t\n\n\tYes. Naturally, when you’re acting and you get good material and you get to do more, you’re stoked. So, yes, I got to do so much more in Episode 4. I think you get to really see her in action. You get to see her passion, her integrity, her morale and her relentless spirit. Also, in an interesting way, although it’s pure from Charlotte, her activism is a product of the boredom and the stirring in Derry. When she was in the South, there was such camaraderie, even though the South was wrought with such craziness. But in Derry, she’s alone and its isolating and she wants to help this other Black family.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow was it sharing those scenes with Stephen Rider in the jail, where Mike Grogan is confessing, and you’re both recognizing some of Derry’s systemic racism?\t\n\n\tIt’s interesting because while there’s a lot of dialogue, the eyes are doing a lot in those scenes. It’s a sign of the times that him being caught with a white woman could actually be far more dangerous than him killing a bunch of kids. It’s beyond insidious. It’s such a heartbreaking scene. And then Charlotte gives him this incredulous look, like she’s acknowledging, “Oh, you really did it now — with a white woman who’s married? Are you nuts?”\n\n\tBut working with Stephen is such a joy. He’s so incredibly talented, and we were so dialed in and supportive of each other that day. We actually ended up having to reshoot it after the strikes, and it got even more dialed in and beautiful. I really enjoy the craft of exploring the human psyche through acting, especially in these dialogue scenes. It’s so much fun. There are so many ways to say something, even when you’re just in one place. It creates the best environment for good work.\n\t\n\t\tYou also have memorable dialogue at the beginning of the episode where Charlotte meets with Rose. How was it doing that scene alongside Kimberly Norris Guerrero?\t\n\n\tKimberly’s like a godmother or an auntie to me. We’ve become very close. She’s just an incredible woman, artist and teacher. We had fun. I think in that scene we had started to build a sisterhood, friendship, family thing. And I think we weren’t originally written to have that, so to build it was a joy.\n\t\n\t\tAs of Episode 4, Charlotte still hasn’t engaged in the paranormal elements of Derry, but is navigating the more grounded horrors of a small town in 1962 America. Do you think that she was developed partially to show that the show’s emphasis on racism is not just metaphorical?\t\n\n\tI think it brings it into a very interesting focus. What could be more insidious than racism and people being killed for the color of their skin? Even when I met Barbara and Andy, I thought it was an interesting, complex way to go about depicting 1962 America Cold War racism. You’ve got so much more to do than just figure out who’s killing these kids, and the show considers scapegoatism, how society needs an enemy. Every society needs a person or a place or a thing to place the evil things that happen on something. So you have this extraterrestrial entity, but you also have the entity and energy of this weird human condition.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe show does a clever job of depicting Maine as different from Charlotte’s previous home in Louisiana, while still showing that the town is exclusionary. Did you study any of Maine’s Civil Rights history in anticipation of the role?\t\n\n\tWell, the South is almost an easy scapegoat because of the nature of slavery and all, but the whole country is responsible. A lot of people were complicit in this reality. So, Maine, yes, is very far from Louisiana, but how far in consciousness from allowing and accepting this kind of thing? Also, I found it fascinating that the complicity and the turning of the cheek can sometimes be just as harmful as the overt hatred.\n\t\n\t\tHave you had the chance to talk with Stephen King about this? Even though Charlotte isn’t his creation, the town’s racial history is very present in the book.\t\n\n\tI unfortunately haven’t met Stephen yet, but I’m sure that’s in my near future, and I’d love to talk with him about it.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMumbai-based Studio Blo has partnered with Disruptor Studios on “Alyssa Carson: Ready for Liftoff,” marking the Indian AI film studio’s first U.S. co-production.\n\n\tThe nonfiction series follows space enthusiast and astrobiologist Alyssa Carson, 24, who has been preparing since age three to become the first human to set foot on Mars. The AI-powered production will use advanced technology to visualize potential human life on Mars across different timeframes — 10, 50, and 100 years into the future.\n\t\n\n\tDeveloped in collaboration with Carson and a team of planetary scientists and AI specialists, the series aims to blend cinematic storytelling with scientific accuracy and AI visualization to explore future human space exploration.\n\n\n\tStudio Blo – the outfit behind Shekhar Kapur’s AI series “Warlord” – and Disruptor Studios, had unveiled a partnership last month.\n\n\t“This marks India’s first AI-driven collaboration for an international TV series between an Indian studio and a Hollywood producer, a milestone we’re incredibly proud of,” said Dipankar Mukherjee, co-founder and CEO of Studio Blo. “At Studio Blo, our vision has always been to tell stories that inspire and transcend borders, and this project does exactly that.”\n\n\tChad Greulach, executive producer and founder of Disruptor Studios, emphasized the production’s technical innovation. “Bringing Alyssa Carson’s mission to the screen would be virtually impossible without Dipankar and the team at Studio Blo,” he said. “This project is not only groundbreaking in concept, it will prove to the creative community at large that AI is less of a threat and more of a tool in creating stories and scenes that would have previously been prohibitively expensive to produce.”\n\t\n\n\tThe partnership represents Studio Blo’s continued expansion into international markets, positioning Indian AI technology as a bridge between local innovation and global storytelling.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn “Working Girl,” an upwardly mobile Melanie Griffith embodied Tess McGill, a secretary from Staten Island with big hair and even bigger dreams. She thought her new boss (played by Sigourney Weaver in the 1988 Mike Nichols movie) would be an ally, since they were both women trying to make it in a man’s world, but just because Katharine Parker didn’t reach up her skirt, the way Tess’ male superiors had, didn’t mean she wouldn’t try to stab her in the back.\n\t\n\n\tThe stars of the Broadway-aspiring stage musical now showing at the La Jolla Playhouse are not Tess and Katherine, but the 1980s themselves: poofy bangs and copious hairspray, nylon stockings and shoulder pads, boomboxes the size of briefcases and synthesizer-driven pop music (supplied here by Cyndi Lauper, whose music and lyrics resemble her Top 40 a lot more than her work on “Kinky Boots”). For the audience, it’s fun to find themselves transported back in time, even as it’s strange to feel nostalgic for a less enlightened decade, when greed was good, fashion was tacky and distaff office assistants were objectified by their male colleagues.\n\n\tBut “9 to 5” this is not. Where that movie — and the Dolly Parton-backed Broadway musical it inspired — were peppy and empowering, serving up an amusingly extreme answer to workplace chauvinism, “Working Girl” feels like it might have made a sharper play, given how plot-driven Kevin Wade’s original screenplay was. Catchy enough to warrant radio play, Lauper’s songs have the tricky task of sounding simultaneously hip (by contemporary standards) and retro, like a recently unearthed pop album originally recorded back in the ’80s, then lost to time.\n\t\n\n\tFrom its attitude-setting number, which finds Tess (Joanna “JoJo” Levesque) riding the Staten Island Ferry to work, Lauper’s music packs a period-appropriate kick — assuming you can look past the ultra-modern LED screens, on which images of the Statue of Liberty represent the hardest working gal in New York. To hear Tess tell it, she’s “looking for something more” — as open-ended an “I want” song as any musical could ask for.\n\n\tThe trouble is, Tess’ ambitions aren’t taken seriously in the testosterone-driven financial sphere where she works: mergers and acquisitions. In a typical setback, Tess learns that she’s been passed over for the executive training program (penalized for rebuffing a superior’s unwelcome advances, to be precise). The opportunity goes to a male “moron” instead, while Tess gets reassigned to the desk of her company’s latest hire — who, to Tess’ surprise, turns out to be a woman.\n\n\tHer first bit of advice comes from no less a role model than Coco Chanel: “Dress shabbily and they notice the dress. Dress impeccably and they notice the woman.” Tess’ new boss swears they’ll stick together, but it’s not long before Tess discovers that she has stolen her big idea — encouraging a client named Trask (Michael Genet) to purchase a radio network, instead of the TV station he had in mind.\n\n\tWhereas Katharine spent much of the film offscreen, the musical expands her part, giving the actress who plays her (in this case, Broadway vet Lesley Rodriguez Kritzer) more scenes and more songs than Weaver had in the movie. She also gets the show’s biggest laugh, spiraling through the air and into a hospital bed during a ski vacation.\n\n\tWhile Katharine is laid up (“calling in” to sing from her hospital bed), Tess steps into her boss’ shoes — literally, borrowing her designer clothes in the closet-raiding makeover number “Notice the Woman” — and steals the business contact who can broker the deal, Jack Trainer (Anoop Desai, a far cry from Harrison Ford but still every bit the romantic lead). The two have chemistry, sending sparks in the show’s best duet, “Can’t Trust Nobody,” though neither is 100% available … or 100% trustworthy.\n\n\t“Working Girl” has more plot than your typical musical needs and only a fraction of it lends itself to farce. Tess crashing the wedding of Trask’s daughter ought to be hilarious, but instead feels overcrowded and unclear. And breaking for intermission right after she’s successfully made her pitch seems an odd place to pause. Wouldn’t Katharine’s return make more sense, leaving audiences to wonder how “The Little People” will keep up the charade, now that the cat has come home (“I’m Back”)? It’s tough enough to fill out the second half, as evidenced by the out-of-place but amusing scene of Jack breakdancing (“Dream in Royalty”)?\n\t\n\n\tAmong the more intriguing changes is the idea that Tess is not alone in her struggle, but helped along by half a dozen female colleagues, to the extent that they might have called the show “Working Girls,” if Mike Leigh hadn’t gotten there first. Clawing her way up the ladder, Tess loses sight of those whose shoulders she stood on — especially best friend Cyn (Ashley Blanchet in the Joan Cusack role), with whom she’ll have to apologize before show’s end (their song, “You and Me,” could pass for a retro radio hit).\n\n\tTess also has a boyfriend, Mick (Joey Tanato), who looks like Val Kilmer and sounds like Jon Bon Jovi. In a clever tweak, he sings in a band. Trying to win Tess back after they break up, Mick’s “Get You Hot” jam bears an uncanny resemblance to “Living on a Prayer.” That’s one of the stranger things about Lauper’s songs: A lot of them sound a few notes removed from actual ’80s faves, none more than the title number, which echoes her own instantly recognizable hit, “Girls Just Want to Have Fun.” It’s a catchy tune, though memories of that earlier song send exactly the wrong message in a show where girls just want to be taken seriously.\n",

I’m Bill, and I’m the city slicker who’s going to head to Texas with you to break down new episodes of this lovable Billy Bob Thornton drama. As Season 2 begins, the characters are facing many changes. Among them, Monty Miller (Jon Hamm) is dead and his wife Cami (Demi Moore) is taking over M-Tex; cartel boss Jimenez (Alex Meraz) was killed by his boss Gallino (Andy Garcia); Cooper (Jacob Lofland) is trying to make his scandalous relationship with Ariana (Paulina Chavez) work as he heads off on his own to try to be an oil tycoon; and Tommy (Thornton) is promoted to have even more responsibilities at M-Tex after Monty’s death. It’s a stressful time, so let’s dive right in.\n\t\n\n\nBetween Tommy’s breakfast conspiracy lecture and mainlining coffee and cigarettes before the sun’s up, I’m worried about him having a heart attack, too!\nThere’s good music already this season — a Turnpike Troubadours needle drop not even five minutes in? Hell yeah!\n“The mosquitoes are so big, they can fuck a turkey flat-footed.” Is it possible that’s not a folksy Texas expression but rather a horrifying reality in the South?\n“It’s a young woman’s game here — no offense.” I’m sorry, Demi Moore made “The Substance” — you must treat her with respect or prepare to be eaten alive.\nCami’s speech rules, and is a great reminder of the take-no-prisoners attitude that makes this show special. “The only difference between me and Monty is I’m meaner. Test me and you’ll find out how much.” Fuck yeah!\nHow is Cooper’s first drill this successful? Another shoe has to drop on this get-rich-quick operation, right?\nWow, Ariana couldn’t be less excited about being an overnight multimillionaire. Why is she so cagey?\nAngela (Ali Larter) expressing her love of grey sweatpants to her daughter, Ainsley (Michelle Randolph), is pretty gross! Will we see Tommy wearing them in a future episode?\nAinsley and this college counselor couldn’t be less of a fit — give me a bottle episode with these two on a road trip!\nShout out to Randolph, who walks a tricky line during this scene between being way over her head and disarmingly sweet. It’s hard to empathize with someone who spends the bulk of their admittance meeting babbling on about the importance of hot people having kids together, but she makes it work.\nOof, what a sad introduction to T.L. (Sam Elliott). Is it too soon to cry this season?\nT.L.’s harsh rebuttal of reconnecting with his wife after he passes: “If I do, that means I’m in hell too.” Woof, we’ve got some trauma to explore soon.\nThe way the Norris women act around Cooper, you can practically smell him through the television.\nIt’s funny how quickly everyone scatters when Angela starts throwing plates during her tantrum. Bonus points to those around the table who escaped with their drinks and food in hand.\nTommy and Angela’s rapid, NC-17 make-up after the dinner fight proves that those two loonies are meant for each other.\nThere’s something about Thornton’s cigarette smoking that makes the ugly habit look so appealing, right?\nLove that final shot of the sunset, mirroring Tommy to who we now know is his father, T.L., as they both search for meaning in the family matriarch’s death.\n\n\n\n\tUntil next week, feel free to discuss your own conspiracy theories and far-fetched easy money schemes in the comments below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFCC Chairman Shares Trump Post Calling for NBC to Fire Seth Meyers ‘Immediately’\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMeet Strangelove, the Cult-Favorite Fragrance House Powered by Oud\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder Armour’s CEO Just Did the Thing He ‘Couldn’t Imagine’\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

He says construction is in the final stretch and the buyer will be able to move in within about sixty days.\n      \n    \n          The property is owned by Flagg Family Capital, the family's private real estate investment arm, in partnership with Carolwood LP. Headed by Adam Rubin and Andrew Shanfeld.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He says the timing was intentional, saying ... \"The minute New York elected Mandahmi, I called my broker Jordan Karp. I didn't even wait for the acceptance speech.\" Karp listed the property and his phone's been blowing up ever since.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          North Bay Road, often called the Fifth Avenue of Miami Beach, remains one of the most coveted streets in the country. Flagg's estate has been completely rebuilt, a rarity in a neighborhood where many homes still date back to the 1930s.\n      \n    \n          North Bay Road, nicknamed \"Billionaires' Row.\" counts David and Victoria Beckham, Michael Bay, Barry Diller and the Von Furstenberg family, and Steve Witkoff among its heavyweight residents with sales regularly topping $70 to $100 million.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Flagg says the Miami rush is predictable. One politician says they'll \"make the rich pay,\" and planes at Teterboro start fueling up faster than the Bergdorf sale,\" he jokes. \"A week later, everyone from Manhattan claims they 'escaped New York,' like they tunneled out of Shawshank with a Birkin.\"\n      \n    \n          Josh also bought a place in East Hampton and a commercial building in downtown Manhattan. \"I love New York -- it's home half the month,\" he says. \"I'm just doing business. And I can't say I'm leaving Miami ... I've never even spent a night there.\"\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

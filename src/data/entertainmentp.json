    "body": "\n\tVienna-based sales agency Square Eyes has secured international rights to Sebastian Brameshuber’s “London,” which will have its world premiere in the Panorama strand of the Berlin Film Festival, taking place Feb. 12-22.\n\n\tThe film follows Bobby, who is always in his car, driving back and forth on the highway that links Vienna and Salzburg. Other people travel that same route; he picks them up to save money on petrol and talks to them along the way: the soldier questioning what it means to fight; the supermarket trainee heading to see family; the academic looking at the history of the highway; and the queer woman about to get married. Different paths, different accents, different stories, most of them true.\n\t\n\n\tBobby listens, but also speaks about himself, about his youth, about aging, about his friend in a coma in Salzburg, who’s the reason for all these trips.\n\n\n\tMountains and forests rush by outside, broken up by junctions, barriers and bridges, the quality of light shifts along with the seasons.\n\n\tNeither a documentary, nor entirely fiction, “London” is a “quietly political portrait of today’s Europe via its in-between spaces and those passing through them,” according to a statement. “Even in these strange times, anonymity and kindness can still go hand in hand.”\n\n\tBrameshuber said, “With ‘London,’ I wanted to capture raw presence while using cinema to defy its gravity, creating a film that oscillates between the real and what lies beyond.”\n\n\tHe added, “The main action of the film takes place on the Westautobahn, or A1, a seemingly functional highway connecting Vienna and Salzburg before ending at the German border. People from across Europe make use of it for a variety of personal reasons, unaware of the historical abyss along its edges, for this road follows a line that was first drawn almost 90 years ago, at a time of great unrest.\n\t\n\n\t“The A1 flows like a river, its banks accumulating stories and history like sediments—past and present, private and political, trivial and profound.\n\n\t“Though strangers, the long stretch of time Bobby and his much younger passengers share in a confined space draws them closer. At times, they become something like a mirror, reflecting back to him the lives he could have lived. Their conversations may skim the surface, only to plunge into deeper waters, as the immediacy of their everyday lives intertwines with history at every bend in the river.”\n\n\tWouter Jansen, CEO of Square Eyes, said, “With minimal means and mostly dialogues, Sebastian takes the audience on a very engaging and at moments emotional ride.\n\n\t“Set almost entirely on a single stretch of highway, the film draws a quiet, yet resonant portrait of contemporary Europe through fleeting encounters with strangers. We have been eagerly awaiting this film and are happy to be presenting it to the world starting in Berlin.”\n\n\t“London” is produced by David Bohun and Lixi Frank for Panama Film in Austria.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe box office has a new king.\n\n\tAs 2025 draws to a close, Jonathan Bailey is the year’s highest-grossing actor, thanks to his roles in “Jurassic World Rebirth” (which made some $869 million globally) and “Wicked: For Good” ($468.3 million to date). \n\n\tNeither of these movies were sold solely on Bailey’s participation — both benefit from the infusion of energy and life the actor provides. Bailey’s climbing to the top of the Hollywood heap is a pivot point in his journey from “Bridgerton” standout to anointed leading man, just as was his selection, earlier this year, as People’s “Sexiest Man Alive.” In both of those moments — his status as top box-office star and the People cover — he was breaking a barrier. Bailey is the first out gay man to be the box-office champ, and the fact that it barely feels notable at all is itself notable.\n\t\n\n\tBailey came out in the media before his rise to fame stateside; he was, when he first discussed the subject of his sexuality publicly, a well-regarded actor on British television and in theater in London. The rocketship he’s been riding ever since — breaking out with Shonda Rhimes’ Netflix soap “Bridgerton” in 2020, then receiving an Emmy nomination for 2023’s limited series “Fellow Travelers” and some measure of Oscar buzz for the first “Wicked” in 2024 — has all happened within the context of the public understanding him as, in his personal life, a gay man. Even 10 years ago, that might have been limiting. Today, it’s no big deal.\n\n\n\tOr, well, not no big deal — but the manners in which it colors the public perception of this actor have seemed only to redound to his benefit. The flirtatious, vervy energy Bailey brought to his recent Actors on Actors conversation with fellow hunk David Corenswet (who is straight) seems to have utterly charmed the internet, as did the pair breaking into a Cole Porter song together on-camera. While promoting the “Jurassic” film, Bailey and co-star Scarlett Johansson embraced and kissed frequently on red carpets, a refreshing burst of just-this-side-of-platonic chemistry done both to sell the movie and celebrate a seemingly deep friendship. And in “Wicked,” a film franchise where just about everyone seems to exist somewhere beyond a Kinsey 0, Bailey’s friskiness and sly, knowing line deliveries lend a queer-adjacent panache to a straight love story.\n\t\n\n\tAll of which is to say that Bailey is doing fine as a movie star, but his success isn’t happening despite his sexuality. His flair and his sense of fun and performance are intrinsic to him in a manner that seems familiar from past gay actors who never, quite, got the chance to rise so far. In past eras, those traits might have been leveraged to keep Bailey a sidekick, a gifted actor who would get one or two chances to be the supportive friend or witty assistant to the film’s real star. In other words, he might have been the Rupert Everett who excelled in “My Best Friend’s Wedding” and then never got a chance that good again.\n\n\tIn “Wicked” and “Jurassic World Rebirth,” Bailey is paired opposite a female lead with whom he shares real chemistry (something he might not have been allowed in the past) and is allowed to be overtly sexual (ditto). The fact of his not only being gay but having memorably played a gay character on the very explicit “Fellow Travelers” seems only to have impressed audiences, not threatened his future viability as a lead. And the movies are better for it: “Jurassic World Rebirth” doesn’t hold a candle to the Steven Spielberg dino movies from the 1990s, but Bailey looks good in his little glasses! And, in “Wicked: For Good,” Bailey’s theater-kid exuberance makes the (rare, for this overlong sequel) showstopper “As Long as You’re Mine” feel rapturous.\n\n\tMovies are more fun with Jonathan Bailey around. So, too, is the movie-promotion apparatus, which Bailey takes on with a sense of happy-to-be-here delight and a slight wink to the audience. (Straight actors tapped by People to assume the Sexy Man mantle tend to approach their term in Sexy Man office with a certain pomposity, as if bristling against the inherent corniness of the honor; Bailey is the least self-serious Sexiest Man Alive that I can recall.) One hopes for many more years of him headlining the projects he chooses — and many more queer actors in his wake, bringing precisely the energy that’s natural to them. \n",

    "body": "\n\tForget the pause that refreshes — Peacock users will soon be greeted by a live commercial as soon as they sign on to the streamer.\n\n\tThe introduction of “Arrival Ads” is among a host of new ad-tech services and developments unveiled Wednesday by NBCUniversal in advance of January’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The blurbs dubbed “Arrival Ads” will be incorporate into the Peacock home page as a live spot that plays as a user logs on to the streamer.\n\t\n\n\t“This is truly the front door for Peacock,” said Alison Levin, president of advertising and partnerships for NBCUniversal. “It’s not just this massive, massive reach of being the front door, but it also is this beautiful canvas that we can really create with our partners.”\n\n\n\tNBCUniversal leaders emphasized that it pursued innovations and adjustments to its ad sales offerings in part because of the company’s significant investment in sports and other live content for NBC and Peacock. NBCU also outlined more plans for its 100th anniversary celebration that it has planned for next year as the company marks a century since the birth of NBC as a radio network.\n\n\tAt a presentation held Tuesday for media in New York, Mark Marshall, chairman of global advertising and partnerships for NBCUniversal, noted NBCU’s focus on big, buzzy live event franchises has momentum even at a fractious time for media. Marshall cited the huge turnout for NBC’s annual telecast of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade as an example of a program that drew a bigger crowd than some of streaming’s most talked-about scripted series combined.\n\t\n\n\t“A few weeks ago, the Thanksgiving Day Parade reached 74 million people in a day, which is amazing when you think of that. It’s the biggest entertainment event of the year. And just put that in perspective, that alone is bigger than the top streaming show from all of the top streamers. So ‘Stranger Things,’ ‘Reacher’ and ‘Landman’ combined don’t reach what the parade did in one day. So as we enter in our 100th year in 2026, we’ve never invested more in content. We’ve never invested more in technology.”\n\n\tAnother new offering allows NBCU to use AI tools to search live sporting events for the optimal moment in the game to place commercials and branding elements — as the pitcher throws the third strike, as the team hits the 10-yard line, etc. NBCU calls it “AI-powered Contextual Targeting in Live.”\n\n\t“For many years, we’ve been able to do things like target by genre and things like that, but these new AI models allow us to analyze our content in ways and at speeds that have never been available before. So what we’re doing, using this AI technology, is fulfilling what I call the targeting trilogy, if you will, this idea of showing the right ad to the right person at the exact right time,” said Ryan McConville, NBCU’s chief product officer and executive VP of ad products and solutions.\n\n\t“As an advertiser that I don’t want to just be in an NFL game, but I want to be at the exact moment that that game changing touchdown gets scored. So you can start to sponsor these really custom, high impact moments of the highest sort of engagement with the content around the moments that really resonate throughout a live experience,” McConville said.\n\n\tNBCU’s other new offerings include an expanded Performance Insights Hub with a host of new measurement tools for advertisers to track the effectiveness and ROI on their marketing efforts. Executives touted recent partnerships with Walmart and Instacart that yielded strong returns and data insights for NBCU that encouraged them to expand the program.\n\n\tAmong other news shared, NBCUniversal is also expanding its investment in vertical video. Viewing of short form content on Peacock is up 257% year-over-year, driven by clips of Bravo and Peacock unscripted series. NBCU also said it will expand programmatic advertising options for the Winter Olympics in Milan Cortina airing Feb. 6-22.\n\t\n\n\tNBCUniversal’s big push to develop new ad-tech options and other new wrinkles to its menu of ballyhoo options for marketers has been driven by the media’s ever-changing landscape, as well as the opportunity NBCU has with an action-packed year that includes the company’s 100th anniversary, the Super Bowl in February, the World Cup and NBA Finals.\n\n\t“If we are going to have this year that will never happen again in terms of Olympics, World Cup, Super Bowl, NBA, everything together, and we do nothing with it — Shame on us. And so what we wanted to be able to do is to say — all these people are going to come in into our ecosystem. How do we actually capture them into our ecosystem? How do we retarget them? So I’d say it came also right from the marketplace and what [advertisers] were interested in.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPantheon Media Group, the unscripted, live events and global format company that oversees shingles including Done+Dusted and Film 45, has sealed a strategic partnership with TH Studios – an embedded digital production and social strategy team that has worked on projects including “Love Island USA” and “Dancing with the Stars.”\n\n\tThe move comes following Pantheon’s hire earlier this year of “Love Island USA” executive producer Simon Thomas, who joined as the company’s head of creative. The deal with TH brings digital content into the mix as part of series rollout, the company said.\n\t\n\n\t“Off-platform is equally as vital as what you watch on screen,” Thomas said in a statement. “I’ve been lucky enough to see what TH Studios can do up close with ‘Love Island USA’ and other hit shows, through social and app play-along and bespoke content creation for talent and special guests. Partnering with TH Studios allows us to reach out and build fandoms from day one — building show universes that live in the zeitgeist that fans want to be in.”\n\n\n\tSince joining Pantheon, Thomas has focused on building formats inside the company, and has sealed deals at networks and streamers including Peacock, NBC and Netflix.\n\n\t“Pantheon is thinking beyond broadcast, and that’s what drives modern-day watercooler conversation,” said TH Studios chief content officer Jill Johnson in a statement. “They’re building for the long game. We’re excited to join them early, architecting the fan journey, the platform-first narrative and the engagement infrastructure that turns viewers into a community.”\n\t\n\n\tAt the start of 2025, Pantheon — a part of WME Group’s nonscripted content group —rebranded from its previous identity as Asylum Entertainment Group.\n\n\tLast year, Pantheon acquired a stake in live media producers Done+Dusted; partnered with Tyler Perry Studios in a joint venture to create and produce unscripted content; invested a minority stake in Ladywell Films, an independent production house founded by “Tinder Swindler” filmmakers Bernadette Higgins and Felicity Morris; and took a stake in a stake in London-based Dare Entertainment.\n\n\tChairman Steve Michaels and CEO Jennifer O’Connell operate Pantheon Media Group, which includes production shingles covering live, premium doc, factual, crime, sports, game, entertainment and other categories. Besides the ones mentioned above, they also include Breaklight Pictures and Texas Crew Productions. Recent productions include “Cowboy Cartel” (Apple TV), The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade (NBC/Peacock), “Shaq” (HBO), “Rubi & Jodi: A Cult of Sin and Influence” (ID/HBO Max), Kids Choice Awards (Nickelodeon), “Conan O’Brien: The Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor” (Netflix) and “Sean Combs: The Reckoning” (Netflix). Upcoming projects include the first-ever FIFA World Cup Halftime Show and a new Nikki Glaser comedy special for Hulu.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor now, David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance is signaling that it will fight for the hearts and minds of Warner Bros. Discovery with the $30/share offer it has already put forward — and that it won’t go higher.\n\n\tAfter WBD’s board officially rejected Paramount’s offer, Paramount issued a statement saying it “affirmed its commitment to acquiring” Warner Bros.

The stance indicates that Paramount is preparing for a drawn-out fight for shareholder votes against the Netflix deal to buy Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max.\n\t\n\n\tDavid Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount, said: “We remain committed to bringing together two iconic Hollywood studios to create a unique global entertainment leader. Our proposal clearly offers WBD shareholders superior value and certainty, a clear path to close, and does not leave them with a heavily indebted sub-scale linear business. I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders who clearly understand the benefits of our offer. We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers, and the creative industries.”\n\n\n\tAccording to Paramount, its offer provides WBD shareholders “superior value” compared with the transaction with Netflix. Per Paramount, its offer $30 per share in cash versus Netflix’s cash component of only $23.25 per share (an $18 billion difference in the aggregate).\n\n\t“The value of Netflix’s offer has been further reduced as its share price trades below the bottom of the “collar” on its stock component,” Paramount said. In addition, Netflix’s offer “would leave WBD shareholders owning a highly leveraged stub in Global Networks and WBD’s Board provides no valuation of that stub.” Paramount has estimated the WBD Global Networks business would be worth around $1 per share. According to Paramount, Netflix’s offer has a “dollar-for-dollar reduction to what WBD shareholders will receive tied to the net debt on Global Networks.” \n\t\n\n\tParamount reiterated that it is “highly confident its offer would receive timely regulatory approval because it would enhance competition in the creative industries rather than entrench a dominant streaming monopoly that the Netflix transaction envisions.” According to the WBD’s board letter to shareholders, “Despite PSKY’s media statements to the contrary, the Board does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk between the PSKY offer and the Netflix merger.”\n\n\tParamount claimed that it has lined up “all necessary financing to deliver its offer to WBD shareholders, and it is not subject to any financing conditions.” Paramount’s offer will be financed by $41 billion of new equity “backstopped” by the Ellison family (i.e., Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison) and RedBird Capital Partners and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo Global Management.\n\n\tHowever, in rejecting Paramount’s $30/share hostile bid, the WBD board said Paramount “has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a ‘full backstop’ from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has.” Per the Warner Bros. Discovery board, the most recent Paramount Skydance proposal includes a $40.65 billion equity commitment “for which there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind. Instead, they propose that you rely on an unknown and opaque revocable trust for the certainty of this crucial deal funding.”\n\n\tParamount directed WBD shareholders “and other interested parties” to its website with details about its offer at strongerhollywood.com. Netflix, meanwhile, has its own site for shareholders arguing its case, at netflixwbtogether.com.\n\n\tIn its statement Wednesday, Paramount reiterated its belief that the sales process conducted by Warner Bros. Discovery’s board was not conducted fairly. “WBD’s own narrative of the actions that led to its inferior transaction with Netflix reveals a process which was not run to secure the best offer for WBD shareholders,” Paramount Skydance said. “Most notably, the absence of any engagement by WBD with Paramount in the face of a superior all-cash $30 per share offer speaks for itself.”\n\n\tAccording to Paramount, “WBD seeks to mislead its shareholders into believing this is a complicated question about legal documents. In reality, it is all quite simple: $30 in cash fully backstopped by a well-capitalized trust (in existence for approximately 40 years) of one of the most well-known founders and entrepreneurs in the world, Larry Ellison.” But from mid-September “all the way through to December 4, what is glaring is the absolute resistance on the part of WBD to even engage in a single negotiating session with Paramount or its advisors, and a refusal even to provide a mark-up of any transaction document,” Paramount Skydance said.\n\t\n\n\tThe Netflix transaction requires approval by Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders at a special shareholder meeting. “But there is no reason to wait months to have your voice heard,” Paramount Skydance said, repeating its call for WBD shareholders tender their shares “today” for the Paramount bid. For Paramount’s hostile bid to prevail over the Netflix agreement, Paramount will need to receive at least 90% of the outstanding shares of WBD common stock in favor of its proposal.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJennifer Lawrence hilariously revealed to Leonardo DiCaprio during their conversation for Variety and CNN’s Actors on Actors that she hallucinated on the set of “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” when she mistakenly took an Ambien before filming a scene opposite Philip Seymour Hoffman. \n\n\t“You and I are both obsessive about sleep when we’re working, like counting the hours,” Lawrence told her “Don’t Look Up” co-star. “When I did ‘Red Sparrow,’ I took an Adderall instead of a sleeping pill, and then I didn’t sleep all night. I was taking hot showers in a panic. I am not somebody who can function without sleep. And then I had to say the phrase ‘Senate Armed Services Committee’ in a Russian accent. That sucked.” \n\t\n\n\t“I also once took an Ambien in the morning, thinking it was something else,” Lawrence continued. “It was a dance scene with Philip Seymour Hoffman on the second ‘Hunger Games’ movie. I was hallucinating. Elizabeth Banks got really annoyed with me.”\n\n\tDiCaprio reacted to Lawrence’s revelation by calling these moments “key screwups” in an actor’s career.\n\n\tLawrence originated the role of Katniss Everdeen in “The Hunger Games” movie franchise, which included four movies between 2012 and 2015. The series has expanded in recent years with film prequels such as 2023’s “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” and next year’s “Sunrise on the Reaping,” which Lawrence is set to appear in.\n\n\tVariety reported earlier this month that Lawrence and original “Hunger Games” co-star Josh Hutcherson will be reprising their roles of Katniss and Peeta in “Sunrise on the Reaping.” The nature of Lawrence and Hutcherson’s cameo is being kept under wraps, but book readers already know their characters appear alongside Haymitch in the epilogue, which indicates some sort of flash-forward.\n\t\n\n\tLawrence has said in various interviews over the years that she would be more than willing to play Katniss again on the big screen. She told Variety in June 2023 during her “No Hard Feelings” press tour that she is “totally” open to reprising her “Hunger Games” character should the right opportunity arise. She added at the time, “If Katniss ever could ever come back into my life, 100 percent.”\n\n\tRead Lawrence and DiCaprio’s full conversation for Variety and CNN’s Actors on Actors here.

    "description": "\n\tWill “Avatar: Fire and Ash” hit the box office trifecta?\n\n\tJames Cameron’s two previous epics, 2009’s “Avatar” and 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,",
    "body": "\n\tWill “Avatar: Fire and Ash” hit the box office trifecta?\n\n\tJames Cameron’s two previous epics, 2009’s “Avatar” and 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,” each grossed well over $2 billion globally and stand as two of the biggest movies in history. So Hollywood has lofty expectations for the third installment, to say the least.\n\n\tBased on projections, Disney’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” is poised to lead with $90 million to $105 million from 3,800 theaters. The film should collect another $250 million to $275 million in its international debut for a global start between $340 million to $365 million. Turnout is expected to be particularly robust on Imax and 3D screens.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s worth remembering that “Avatar” films are known, not for splashy opening weekends, but rather for unparalleled box-office staying power. The original debuted to $77 million domestically and held onto the No. 1 spot for seven weeks, eventually climbing to $760 million in North America and $2.92 billion worldwide. The sequel (despite a daunting runtime of three hours and 12 minutes) collected $134 million in its domestic debut before powering to $688 million in North America and $2.3 billion worldwide.\n\n\n\tShould “Fire and Ash” chart a similar box office path (assuming the butt-numbing runtime of three hours and 17 minutes doesn’t intimidate audiences this time around either), “Avatar” could become the first film franchise in history with three installments to earn above $2 billion. Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe is tied with two $2 billion behemoths, 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame” and 2018’s “Avengers: Infinity War.” Meanwhile Cameron is already the only filmmaker with three movies to generate more than $2 billion, the other being “Titanic.” The newest “Avatar” doesn’t necessarily need to surpass the $2 billion mark to be successful, however Cameron’s films carry gargantuan price tags and require towering global ticket sales to justify their budgets.\n\t\n\n\t“Avatar” follows the clan of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) on the alien moon of Pandora. “Fire and Ash” picks up after the events of “The Way of Water,” which charted the conflict between the blue-skinned humanoids known as the Na’vi against the villainous Resources Development Administration. After the death of Jake Sully’s son Neteyam, he and his family seek refuge with the aquatic clan called Metkayina and continue the fight against the RDA as well as a new fiery foe. Variety’s chief film critic Owen Gleiberman was mostly positive in his review, writing that the threequel is “better than the second film — bolder and tighter — and still has its share of amazements. But it no longer feels visually unprecedented.”\n\n\tRival studios didn’t feel the need to steer clear of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” at the box office. Three new movies, Paramount’s “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants,” Lionsgate’s psychological thriller “The Housemaid” and the Angel Studios animated biblical musical drama “David,” will try to work as counter-programming against the Pandora-set adventure. Those films will float behind “Fire and Ash” on box office charts. However, “Avatar” and “Star Wars”-sized tentpoles aside, Christmastime releases don’t always deliver huge debuts but tend to play and play on the big screen into January and beyond.\n\n\t“The Housemaid” is targeting a $20 million to $25 million debut from 3,000 venues. Lionsgate is trying to couch expectations by offering a projection in the mid teens. The studio hopes the $35 million-budgeted film will become a breakout hit among females in the vein of “A Simple Favor,” “Anyone but You,” or “It Ends With Us” (but without the off-screen drama). Directed by Paul Feig (“Bridesmaids”) and adapted from the best-selling novel by Freida McFadden, the R-rated film follows a young woman (Sydney Sweeney) with a troubled past who becomes the live-in maid for an ultra-wealthy family who isn’t what it seems. Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar play the not-so-picture-perfect husband and wife while Michele Morrone and Elizabeth Perkins round out the cast. Variety’s Gleiberman praised the campy nature of “The Housemaid,” saying the movie “goes right over-the-top, but it does so in a way that’s unusually clever and knowing.”\n\t\n\n\t“David,” a kid-friendly take on the story of David and Goliath and follow-up to the TV mini-series “Young David,” could surprise with $20 million to $25 million from 3,100 screens. Angel Studios, which emerged onto the theatrical scene with 2023’s sleeper hit “Sound of Freedom,” has been dominating the faith-based space. Earlier this year, company released the animated biblical adventure “King of Kings,” which ignited to $19 million and held steady, eventually earning $60 million domestically and $79 million worldwide.\n\n\t“The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants” is tracking for the No. 4 spot with projections of $15 million to $20 million from 3,500 locations. The PG-rated film cost $64 million to produce. Based on the hit Nickelodeon television show, “Search for SquarePants” follows the absorbent, yellow sponge as he ventures out of Bikini Bottom and travels to the depths of the ocean to find the scary Flying Dutchman.\n\n\tThis is the first big-screen “SpongeBob” feature in 10 years, since 2015’s “The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water.” That film opened to $55 million and eventually powered to $162 domestically and $325 million globally. Those ticket sales were a huge improvement from the original successful theatrical adventure, 2004’s “The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, which launched with $32 million and ended its run with $85 million in North America and $141 million. A third installment, “The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run,” debuted directly on streaming in 2020 at the height of the pandemic.\n\n\tThese films, as well as the Christmas Day release of A24’s Timothée Chalamet-led ping-pong adventure “Marty Supreme,” the Focus Features musical drama “Song Sung Blue” starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson, and Sony’s disaster comedy “Anaconda” with Jack Black and Paul Rudd, will attempt to kick the box office into high gear before the end of the year. Overall domestic ticket sales sit at $8.1 billion, a mere 0.5% ahead of last year as well as 22.7% behind 2019, according to Comscore. So there’s mounting pressure on holiday offerings to inch the year’s revenues closer to the projected $9 billion mark.\n\n\tIt’s all coming down to you, Jim Cameron. (No pressure.)\n",

    "body": "\n\tTiwa Savage is the kind of personality who you can feel enter a room seconds before you actually see them. It’s not just the rustle of her impeccably fashionable clothes, but that certain intangible presence that many of the most magnetic performers share; the fragrance that fills the room soon after only amplifies the impression.\n\n\tBut her excitement is palpable as well, because she’s eager to talk about her fourth studio album and her official first foray into R&B, “This One Is Personal.” After helping shape the sound of modern African music for over a decade (and earning the title “the Queen of Afrobeats”), Savage is taking more risks both thematically and sonically.\n\t\n\n\tThe set finds her circling back to her roots: first as a jazz student, then as an R&B songwriter, reigniting the passion that made her fall in love with performing in the first place. Savage first broke out with her 2011 single “Kele Kele (Love)” under Don Jazzy’s Mavin Recordings, now home to Ayra Starr, Rema, and more.  The Grammy-nominated singer spent the early 2010s racking up hits in Europe and Africa, then sent her momentum into overdrive with an appearance on Beyoncé’s 2019 “The Lion King: The Gift” and her 2020 U.S. breakthrough album “Celia.” She began work on the new album in 2023.\n\n\n\t“This project is bringing me back to when I first started,” she says. “I can’t wait to tour and bring it to life.”\n\n\tAt 45, the Nigerian superstar is letting her hair down, pairing sonic expansion with themes of industry stressors, romance, insecurity, and casual entanglements (highlighted on latest single “10%”), which she jokes, “That’s just me being naughty for a second. Like, Ooh, I’m outside.”\n\t\n\n\tThe title of “This One Is Personal” is no accident: much of the album was cut live in jam sessions, with contributions from rising Nigerian talent Taves, UK rap titan Skepta, and Grammy-winning songwriter James Fauntleroy (Rihanna, SZA, Justin Bieber).\n\n\tVariety caught up with Savage earlier in the fall to talk about the new album and her plans around it.\n\n\tWhat has the reception to your R&B debut been like?\n\n\tI’m so excited. Especially being here in America and having people love it. You could do a record and people are like, “You should just stay in your Afrobeats lane.” But I’m getting so much love from people like a Joe Budden and the different people I’ve spoken to. Them loving it and really giving me that co-sign is incredible.\n\n\tThis album is more of a return to your foundation as a graduate from Berklee College of Music and an R&B songwriter. Was there anyone you were hoping to get approval from, or someone’s opinion that mattered to you?\n\n\tNormally, before, I would definitely play my album to certain people in the industry I respected. But I didn’t with this one. Not because I was being cocky or arrogant, but it was so personal to me that your opinion wouldn’t have changed anything. I was so intentional with this record. I took over two years to complete it from start to finish. If anything, maybe my fans. I hoped they would understand and connect to it, which they have — more than any other project I’ve done.\n\n\tInitially, I thought, oh, it’s a bit too personal and people might not connect. But we are all human and we all go through the same thing.\n\n\tYou had only a few features on this project. Was this a ‘less-is-more’ approach?\n\n\tI didn’t set out to be like, I want this type of person on my record. I went to the studio, played a couple of records to Skepta in London, and we’d always talked about going in the studio. I played him [“You 4 Me”], he loved it, and I asked him to jump on it. We’ve not really seen him in this light. He’s tough, but here he was rapping and being romantic and sweet. I loved that.\n\n\tAnd when I did the song “Addicted,” I thought this sounds like something Taves would do and I couldn’t think of anybody else. James Fauntleroy, I’ve known him for so long and always wanted to work with him, especially on something more R&B-leaning.\n\t\n\n\tLast year while speaking to Variety about your acting debut, “Water & Garri,” you mentioned being bored with the traditional album and promotion cycle. Do you feel inspired to reintroduce yourself this time around, especially with new music and and a new sound?\n\n\tTo be honest, I didn’t feel like I was low-key because I was in the studio working. It just felt like such a busy period. But publicly, it might have appeared that I was low-key. I recorded in Nashville, San Francisco, Malibu, London, L.A. — different camps everywhere.\n\n\tI was very intentional with this project. I wanted to bring live music into it, because we don’t really have that anymore. On “10%” and a few other records, the instrumentation is all live. In Nashville I flew over the guitarist, the bass player, the keys, and we had a live horn section. All of that on “10%” is live. It was crazy trying to mix live instruments, but it was important for me because a lot of people don’t know my music education background. How would they if I don’t put it into my project? It was important for me to showcase my musicality.\n\n\tYou started off as an R&B songwriter. During that time, you connected with Frank Ocean. How do you reflect on knowing him then?\n\n\tPeople are gonna think I’m capping, but I’m not. We’re not connected now, but when we were coming up as songwriters, I knew he was special. There was something incredible about him. Very quiet, very reserved, but when he spoke it was profound. When he went into the booth and put down a melody, you knew there was something about his tone.\n\n\tBeing around him, around James [Fauntleroy] — it prepared me for this moment. To go with my gut and believe in myself. Before, I played more into what the audience wanted, the Afrobeats audience. I was calculating, creating hit records and pop records. Now, I’m getting back into that mentality I learned from people like James and Frank — you just have to be authentic and true to yourself and the music.\n\n\t“The Lion King” album in 2019 was such an introduction for so many people into African music. Now you’re coming into R&B — it almost feels like a swap. How has it been navigating more of the urban, R&B space?\n\n\tFirst of all, huge shout-out to Beyoncé for even doing that project. It introduced a lot of people to myself and other amazing African artists. That opened a lot of doors. For me, going back to R&B, it’s been incredible to be given the opportunity to be on these platforms and do something people didn’t really know me for. I’m grateful because I know the music is good, but having it received like this is reassuring that I’m doing the right thing.\n\t\n\n\tWhat has been the biggest difference between African media and U.S. or U.K. mainstream media?\n\n\tI’ve shied away from [Nigerian media] before, but I don’t want my people to feel like I’ve forgotten about Nigerian or African media. The huge difference is, interviews abroad are really focused on me, not my personal life. Back home it’s different. Maybe because they don’t know all the controversies, or maybe they do but they’re more respectful. To them, that doesn’t matter.\n\n\tLike me having tattoos — it’s such a big deal in Africa. I can’t imagine Joe Budden being like, “Yo, you got tats.” To them it’s not news. That’s the big difference.\n\n\tEven with you making this pivot into R&B, there’s been a conversation about the state of African music and Afrobeats. What’s your opinion?\n\n\tI understand where Afrobeats artists are coming from. Just because you’re African, it feels like we’re boxed in — that we can’t do hip-hop, country, or R&B. But globally, genre is blending so much. Hip-hop artists sing now, they mix that, so are they R&B, hip-hop, trap soul? It’s hard to box any artist. I don’t know the solution, but I know it’s not just for us. It’s a general music industry conversation.\n\n\tYou’ve “relinquished” the title Queen of Afrobeats to a degree. You’ve said there are others who’ve also contributed to the growth of the genre, so you don’t want it just zoned in on you. But is that you being modest, or is that really how you feel?\n\n\tI do embrace it. I can’t run from it. A friend told me yesterday, you can’t run away from it because you were one of the pioneers and one of the first females to do a lot or be the first of many things. So I’m learning to embrace it. While I’m embracing it, I’m also appreciating others. As women, we don’t always get our flowers. So while I’m receiving mine, I’m extending some to other women, too.\n\n\tWhat’s one thing you know now that you wish you knew earlier in your career?\n\n\tNot the very beginning, but earlier — I wish I’d done this type of R&B leaning project with my full chest. I wish I’d done it a lot earlier.\n",

Over a four-month stretch, David Ellison pressed his case aggressively that Paramount Skydance had the best offer on the table.\n\n\tNone of it — so far — has been enough to sway the Warner Bros. Discovery board.\n\n\tOn Wednesday, the board of Warner Bros. Discovery officially rejected Paramount Skydance’s $30-per share unsolicited takeover offer for the whole company, saying it’s sticking with the “superior” deal offer with Netflix. As part of the WBD response, the company disclosed a timeline of the interactions between Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount, which grew contentious over the several weeks that Paramount’s David Ellison was driving aggressively to land a multibillion-dollar deal for WBD in its entirety.\n\t\n\n\tThe WBD filing presents a chronology of events and meetings that occurred, leading up to WBD’s Dec. 5 announcement of its deal to sell Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max to Netflix, following by David Ellison’s hostile takeover bid and the WBD board’s official rejection of the $30/share bid on Dec. 17.\n\n\n\tPer the filing with the SEC, WBD CEO David Zaslav told the company’s board after David Ellison’s initial $19/share offer in September that the Ellisons — David and his father, billionaire Larry Ellison — had “indicated to him that, if a transaction between PSKY and WBD were to occur, Mr. Zaslav would receive a compensation package worth several hundred million dollars.” According to the WBD filing, Zaslav advised the Warner Bros. Discovery board that “he informed the Ellisons that it would be inappropriate to discuss any such arrangements at that time.”\n\t\n\n\tNote that Zaslav stands to reap a windfall of hundreds of millions from his WBD stock holdings, whether Warner Bros. sells to Netflix or Paramount — and he’s projected to become a billionaire if either deal goes through. \n\n\tFor Paramount’s hostile bid to prevail over the Netflix agreement, both the board of directors of WBD and WBD stockholders would be required to approve it — unless Paramount receives at least 90% of the outstanding shares of WBD common stock in favor of the proposal.\n\n\tWBD also noted in the filing that Zaslav is “subject to a non-competition covenant and a non-solicitation of customers and employees covenant that are each applicable during the period of his employment and for a period of 24 months thereafter, unless Mr. Zaslav’s employment is terminated without ‘cause’ or by Mr. Zaslav for ‘good reason,’ in which case the restricted period would be reduced to 12 months following such qualifying termination.”\n\n\tAccording to WBD, Ellison made Paramount’s first official interest in acquiring the company in a Sept. 14 meeting with Zaslav. That came after a WSJ report Sept. 11 that Paramount was prepping a bid for WBD, which prompted the Warner Bros. Discovery share price to spike.\n\n\tAt that first meeting, Ellison proposed to combine WBD and Paramount Skydance in a transaction in which WBD stockholders would receive a 60%-40% cash-stock mix, comprised of $11.40 in cash and 0.404 of a share of PSKY Class B common stock for each outstanding share of WBD common stock. The offer was subsequently delivered in writing, with an implied a value of approximately $19.00 per share of WBD common stock.\n\n\tThat initial proposal “suggested that Mr. Zaslav could be the Chairman of the combined company’s board and that PSKY ‘would also want other WBD directors to join the combined company’s Board.’”\n\n\tOn Sept. 15, the WBD board met to discuss the “potential risks and benefits” of the Paramount proposal. “The WBD Board noted that the PSKY September 14 Proposal significantly undervalued WBD (taking into account, in particular, that PSKY’s share price was inflated in value relative to its recent unaffected price prior to rumors of a potential transaction), that the proposal lacked details or commitments regarding equity financing, and that the stock consideration offered by PSKY consisted of non-voting Class B common stock of PSKY, ensuring that the Ellison family would retain voting control of the combined entity despite owning a minority of the economic interests in the combined company,” per the filing.\n\t\n\n\tOn Sept. 22, Zaslav and Samuel Di Piazza Jr., chair of the WBD board, sent a letter to Ellison rejecting the Paramount proposal — the first of what would be six more rejections. Later that day, Ellison called Zaslav to request that Zaslav meet with his father, Larry Ellison, to discuss the Paramount’s interest in acquiring WBD. Mr. Zaslav agreed.\n\n\tOn Sept. 24, Zaslav, John Malone, chair emeritus of the WBD board, and Larry Ellison had a videoconference meeting to discuss the Paramount initial proposal. At that meeting, Zaslav “reiterated the reasons for the WBD Board’s decision that were conveyed in WBD’s September 22, 2025, letter to Mr. D. Ellison and the WBD Board’s commitment to the separation plan as a superior path to value creation.”\n\n\tThe Ellisons persisted. Paramount Skydance submitted bids of $22/share on Sept. 30; $23.50/share on Oct. 13; $25.50/share on Nov. 20; an all-cash bid of $26.50/share on Dec. 1; and the $30/share offer on Dec. 4. According to Paramount, Ellison sent texts to Zaslav on Dec. 4 about that last offer — including one that read “It would be the honor of a lifetime to be your partner and to be the owner of these iconic assets” — but never heard back.\n\n\tParamount ultimately was vying in the deal against three bidders: Netflix, Comcast and an unidentified third company referred to as “Company C,” described in the filing as “an American media company” that submitted a proposal to buy Discovery Global (WBD’s TV networks business) and 20% of the WBD Streaming & Studios Business including HBO Max for $25 billion in cash. Per the filing, “WBD determined that Company C’s proposal was not actionable at that time.”\n\n\tIn its Dec. 1 bid, Comcast, referred to in the document as “Company A,” proposed combining the WBD Streaming & Studios Business and certain of Comcast’s related businesses for per share consideration of $5.25 in cash and an amount of stock per outstanding share of WBD Common Stock “such that WBD stockholders would own 49% of the combined company.”\n\n\tBased on a variety of valuation assumptions Comcast set forth in its bid letter, it ascribed a “headline price” of $35.43 per WBD share in the Dec. 1 bid. Comcast’s bid also included a regulatory termination fee of $5 billion and a WBD termination fee of $2.275 billion.\n\t\n\n\t“The WBD Board determined that, while there could be strategic merit in the transaction proposed by Company A, the value of the equity portion of Company A’s bid was uncertain, the percentage of cash in Company A’s proposed consideration mix was lower than that of Netflix and PSKY, and the complex transaction structure would require an extended timeline to complete due diligence and documentation,” per the WBD filing. \n\n\t“Given that, among other things, Netflix submitted the meaningfully highest bid of the December 1 Bids accompanied by the most readily actionable legal documentation, with few issues remaining to be resolved, the WBD Board unanimously decided to accelerate discussions with Netflix in order to resolve remaining issues in Netflix’s merger agreement markup and other transaction agreements,” according to WBD’s version of events. “At the same time, the WBD Board instructed WBD’s management and advisors to remain engaged with Company A and PSKY, and provide them feedback consistent with the WBD Board’s discussions regarding the deficiencies in their proposals.”\n\n\tUltimately, WBD’s board coalesced around Netflix as the winning bidder.\n\n\t“The terms of the Netflix merger are superior. The PSKY offer provides inadequate value and imposes numerous, significant risks and costs on WBD,” Warner Bros. Discovery’s board said in a letter to shareholders released Dec. 17.\n\n\tIn rejecting Paramount’s $30/share hostile bid for WBD, the board said Paramount “has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a ‘full backstop’ from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has.” In addition, the board of Warner Bros Discovery asserted that Paramount Skydance’s $9 billion merger cost synergies target ($3 billion from Skydance-Paramount and $6 billion from a merger with WBD) would “make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.”\n",

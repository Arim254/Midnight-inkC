    "body": "\n\tGenie Francis is mourning Anthony Geary after her “General Hospital” co-star died on Sunday. The two played married couple Luke Spencer and Laura Webber on the long-running ABC series. Drawing 30 million live viewers, their on-screen wedding remains the highest-rated soap opera episode in American TV history.\n\n\t“He spoiled me for leading men for the rest of my life,” Francis wrote of Geary on X. “I am crushed, I will miss him terribly, but I was so lucky to be his partner. Somehow, somewhere, we are connected to each other because I felt him leave last night. Good night sweet prince, good night.”\n\t\n\n\tGeary joined “General Hospital” in 1978 as the street hustler and mobster Luke Spencer, who was quickly paired up with Francis’ character, Laura. The characters first intertwined in a controversial scene in which Luke sexually assaults Laura. Due to a positive audience response to the pairing, the writers retconned the scene as a seduction, rather than rape, but the show revisited the incident decades later, showing how Luke regretted his actions and how the couple moved on from it.\n\n\n\tLuke and Laura became a television phenomenon, serving as one of the first examples of a “supercouple” as other soap operas attempted to replicate the success of the storyline.\n\n\tFrancis starred in 1,967 episodes of “General Hospital” from 1977 to 2025, while Geary appeared in 1,997 before he retired in 2015. (He returned for one cameo in 2017.) Geary won a record-breaking eight Daytime Emmy awards for his portrayal of Luke Spencer, and Francis, too, got Emmy gold in 2007 for playing Laura.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to his husband Claudio Gama, Geary died on Sunday due to complications from a medical procedure. “It was a shock for me and our families and our friends. For more than 30 years, Tony has been my friend, my companion, my husband,” Gama told TV Insider. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMartin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” (2023), the epic chronicle of greed and murder in the Osage Nation, is getting a physical media release from the Criterion Collection. The film is among five titles in the March slate, which also includes Lynne Littman’s “Testament” (1983), Claude Lelouch’s “A Man and a Woman” (1966), Tsui Hark’s “The Blade” (1995) and Luis Buñuel’s “Viridiana” (1961).\n\n\tHitting shelves on March 24, Scorsese’s adaptation of David Grann’s true-crime bestseller unfolds in 1920s Oklahoma, where the discovery of oil brings extraordinary wealth to the Osage people. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, an Army veteran who joins his duplicitous uncle, played by Robert De Niro, in a scheme to rob the Osage of their money and land. Lily Gladstone, the first Native American nominated for best actress at the Oscars, plays Mollie Kyle, Burkhart’s wife, who gradually awakens to the evil surrounding her.\n\t\n\n\tThe Apple Original Films release earned 10 Oscar nominations, including best picture, and represents one of the few streamer-produced best picture nominees to receive a physical release. It also marks one of Scorsese’s most personal endeavors in his long career.\n\n\n\tLittman’s “Testament” depicts one family’s daily life following nuclear devastation. Jane Alexander earned an Oscar nomination for her performance as Carol Wetherly, a mother who must care for her three children as they contend with radiation sickness in their small California town. The Blu-ray features a new 4K digital restoration supervised by Littman and director of photography Steven Poster.\n\t\n\n\tLelouch’s “A Man and a Woman” won the Academy Award and became an international sensation. The French romance follows two widowed single parents — race-car driver Jean-Louis (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and film-script supervisor Anne (Anouk Aimée) — as they fall for each other against the backdrop of the Normandy coast. The release includes a new 2K digital restoration approved by Lelouch.\n\n\tTsui Hark’s “The Blade” puts a gritty spin on the story of the one-armed swordsman. The Hong Kong martial arts film follows young sword-maker Ding On (Vincent Zhao), who becomes an avenger after losing an arm in an ambush. Available in both 4K UHD and Blu-ray editions, the release features a new 4K digital restoration.\n\n\tInitially banned in Spain and denounced by the Vatican upon its premiere, Buñuel’s “Viridiana” presents an irreverent vision of idealism confronting reality. Novice nun Viridiana (Silvia Pinal) struggles to maintain her Catholic principles when confronted by her lecherous uncle (Fernando Rey) and a motley assemblage of paupers. The film won the Palme d’Or at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\t“Testament” streets March 17, while “A Man and a Woman,” “The Blade” and “Viridiana” street March 31. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMariah Carey has officially broken the record for the longest reign atop the Billboard Hot 100, as “All I Want for Christmas Is You” spends its 20th week at No. 1.\n\n\tThe perennial holiday anthem, which returned to the chart’s summit last week, has now claimed the throne for 20 weeks, beating the record previously shared by Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” featuring Billy Ray Cyrus and Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” with 19 weeks at No. 1. “All I Want for Christmas Is You” claims its 77th week on the Hot 100, tying Dua Lipa’s “Levitating” as the longest-charting song ever by a female artist.\n\t\n\n\tThis is the second time that Carey has earned a Hot 100 No. 1 milestone, as her 1995 duet with Boyz II Men, “One Sweet Day,” spent 16 weeks at the top and held the record for 23 years.\n\n\n\tElsewhere on the chart, eight of the top 10 songs are holiday tunes, with Brenda Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” coming in at No. 2, followed by Wham!’s “Last Christmas,” Bobby Helms’ “Jingle Bell Rock” and Ariana Grande’s “Santa Tell Me.” The sole secular songs in the top reaches of the chart are Huntrx’s “Golden” at No. 6, just ahead of Taylor Swift’s “The Fate of Ophelia” at No. 7.\n\n\tSpeaking of Swift, her latest album “The Life of a Showgirl” claims its ninth week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, fending off the surge of holiday albums crashing the upper reaches of the chart. Five of the top 10 albums are Christmas records including Michael Bublé’s “Christmas” (No. 4), Bing Crosby’s “Ultimate Christmas” (No. 5), Nat King Cole’s “The Christmas Song” (No. 6), Vince Guaraldi Trio’s “A Charlie Brown Christmas” (No. 8) and “A Christmas Gift for You From Phil Spector” (No. 9).\n",

    "body": "\n\tTwenty years ago, Greg Daniels learned an important lesson about making mockumentaries by way of a basketball game. He was directing the fifth episode of “The Office” — Season 1’s now-famous “Basketball”  and his first behind the camera. The hilariously chaotic pickup game in the Dunder Mifflin warehouse allowed the cast to play off the dynamics built in the first four episodes and test out the improvisational nature of the genre. Daniels worked closely with the camera operators — “talking with them as you would actors,” he says — about being ready for whatever happens on and off the “court.”\n\t\n\n\t“The essence of the mockumentary to me is that you don’t have to know exactly what you are going to get when you start,” says the creator. “There are character rules and situational rules but just like a basketball game, you don’t know what is going to happen.”\n\n\n\tWith fine-tuned ensembles at the ready, there’s a freedom in mockumentaries; even with a script, cameras are always bound to catch, and inspire, the unexpected. It’s a creed Daniels is living by again with “The Paper,” Peacock’s comedy he co-created with Michael Koman about a dying newspaper and its disjointed staff set in the world of “The Office.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAlex Edelman in Peacock’s “The Paper”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeacock\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt is one of three new mockumentaries from Universal TV this year, including returning hit “St. Denis Medical” and cheerleading competition comedy “Stumble.” The trio arrives as “The Office” turns 20 and remains one of the most-streamed series on Peacock, alongside its mockumentary sister series “Parks and Recreation,” which Daniels also co-created.\n\t\n\n\tIn the years since those series reigned supreme, mockumentaries have thrived across television with Emmy winners “Abbott Elementary” and “Modern Family” serving as pillars for ABC, and “What We Do in the Shadows” doing the same for FX.\n\n\tBut Universal has a 20-year reputation to uphold in this space and isn’t greenlighting just any new take on the format to keep the torch burning.\n\n\t“We feel pressure to make sure that we’re not the ones who blow it,” says Jim Donnelly, Universal TV’s executive vice president for comedy development. “The worst thing is for people to speak fondly of the olden days but think we’re not doing a good job anymore. We don’t make decisions on what shows we develop or put on the air based on whether they are a mockumentary or not. It just so happens that we work with a lot of creators and writers who are extremely good at it, and those often end up being the best shows.”\n\n\tTwo of those creators — Daniels and “St. Denis Medical” showrunner Eric Ledgin — have overall deals at Universal Television. \n\n\tWhile audiences have gotten wise to the format of mockumentaries, Donnelly says the endurance of the genre has always depended on the unique connection between the characters and the audience, thanks to those in-world cameras.\n\n\t“Viewers come to shows like these because they want to be a part of something,” he says. “They came to ‘Cheers’ because they wanted a place where everybody knew your name and here, you have these really well-drawn characters who are basically in dialogue with you, the audience member.”\n\n\tThat direct-to-camera talking head, a cornerstone of the mockumentary’s satirical take on documentaries, is just another evolution of television comedy, and one that Ledgin embraces.\n\n\t“It’s sort of become the modern laugh track in a way,” says Ledgin. “We all railed against the laugh track and decided we didn’t need to be told when to laugh. But I feel like the ‘look to camera’ is a bit of a return to that. I don’t think it’s a bad thing. You want to have that connection of knowing someone else gets what’s funny about this, just like you do.”\n\n\tDespite being a tried-and-true hit, mockumentaries are always an evolving tool in the hands of their creators. Ledgin went into Season 2 with a mission to steady his cameras on screen. “I think I’m supposed to want more shakiness as someone who is trying to be a cool auteur or showrunner,” he says. “But the truth is, people have a lot of tricks to keep the camera pretty steady these days, so maybe we don’t need to make it so janky.”\n\t\n\n\tDaniels, meanwhile, wants to get back to his roots. “Over the years, people have made life a little easier for themselves, and the mockumentary has gotten less strict,” he says. “One of the things Michael and I are trying to do with ‘The Paper’ is go back to a stricter form where you don’t have cameras in people’s bedrooms or have cameras anticipating where a character would go when that character wouldn’t know that themselves.”\n\n\tEvolution is necessary for the characters as well. The staff of Dunder Mifflin, who were still apprehensive of cameras filming the insanity of their workdays, aren’t the same as the reporters of the Toledo Truth Teller, looking to raise awareness of their dying institution in “The Paper.”\n\n\t“One of the things that makes the genre age well is that how a person imagines themselves being seen today is different from the way they imagined themselves 20 years ago,” Koman says. “Everybody’s more conscious of what they look like on television because of reality TV and the internet. A normal person will be much savvier about the consequences of what might happen if they were caught on camera doing something.”\n\n\tBut even within the genre, there is room for variation. “Stumble” is a high-flying example of it. Co-creator Jeff Astrof’s first mockumentary for NBC, “Trial & Error,” was inspired by true crime documentaries like “The Staircase.”\n\n\t“There was a steep learning curve with ‘Trial & Error,’” he says. “Then I just fell in love with the format because there’s so many jokes you can get in it, and there is an intimacy with the audience because you’re laughing with them.”\n\n\tWith “Stumble,” co-created with his sister Liz Astrof, they are sending up Netflix’s docuseries “Cheer” about the intense world of competition cheerleading, told through coach Monica Aldama, who is an executive producer on the new comedy. Here, it’s Jenn Lyon’s Courtney Potter, who is pursuing her 15th championship with a ragtag squad at a Midwest community college.\n\n\tWhere “The Paper” and “St. Denis” want to sit in the everyday lives of their characters, “Stumble” wants to mirror the familiar experience of a sports documentary and build to the on-your-feet climax people expect.\n\t\n\n\t“What we loved so much about ‘Cheer’ is that everyone watching was standing at the TV like it’s a sporting event,” Liz says. “You want them to win Daytona so badly because these kids came from really tough backgrounds and this saved them. We want these characters to be ones you care about. We said in our pitch that we want people to be standing up with the TV waiting to see if they win.”\n\n\tIf mockumentaries are meant to be slices of life — unvarnished in all its funny forms — Universal is steering toward the softer side of what living looks like today with its new trio.\n\n\t“For these kids, this is the most important time in their lives; it is life and death to them,” Astrof says of “Stumble.” “But if you pull it out just a little bit, it’s just a flyover city in a flyover state. That’s what gives these shows their charm. It’s how much people care about something. I think people want to watch people care about something.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe USC Libraries have announced the finalists for the 38th annual Scripter Awards, which recognize excellence in adapting literature for film and television from the year 2025.\n\n\tAmong the film finalists are several Oscar hopefuls, each based on acclaimed literary works:\n\n\n“Frankenstein” (Netflix) — Guillermo del Toro — based on the novel “Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus” by Mary Shelley; Penguin (publisher)\n“Hamnet” (Focus Features) — Chloé Zhao and Maggie O’Farrell — based on O’Farrell’s novel of the same name; Vintage Books (publisher)\n“One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.) — Paul Thomas Anderson — based on the novel “Vineland” by Thomas Pynchon; Penguin (publisher)\n“Peter Hujar’s Day” (Janus Films/Sideshow) — Ira Sachs — based on the book of the same name by Linda Rosenkrantz; Magic Hour Press (publisher)\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix) — Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar — based on the novella of the same name by Denis Johnson; Picador (publisher)\n\n\n\n\n\tIra Sachs’ period drama “Peter Hujar’s Day,” which explores the life of famed New York photographer Peter Hujar and his friend Linda in 1974, is the biggest surprise on the list. The film premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival, after which it was acquired by Janus Films and Sideshow.\n\n\n\tSachs, a mainstay of independent American cinema for more than 25 years, has never been nominated for an Oscar despite acclaimed works such as “Keep the Lights On” (2012), “Love Is Strange” (2014) and “Passages” (2023). Could this nomination provide the momentum he needs for his first major career recognition?\n\t\n\n\tThe Scripter Awards’ strict eligibility requirements and highbrow tastes excluded several high-profile contenders. \n\t\n\n\tJon M. Chu’s musical “Wicked: For Good” by Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox failed to receive a nom, continuing the awards’ long-standing trend of overlooking musicals. Past musical adaptations — including best picture winner “Chicago” (2002) and nominee “Les Misérables” (2012) — were also shut out their respective years.\n\n\tNon-English-language films are also ineligible, which disqualified Neon’s “No Other Choice” by Park Chan-wook, Lee Kyoung-mi and Jahyee Lee from the lineup, considered to be a viable entry for the adapted screenplay Oscar nom. \n\n\tAdditionally, films not based on books are excluded. That ruled out Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia” by Will Tracy (an English-language remake of a Japanese film), as well as sequels to original films like Rian Johnson’s “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” and James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Adaptations of documentaries are deemed ineligible, such as Craig Brewer’s “Song Sung Blue” and Benny Safdie’s “The Smashing Machine.”\n\n\tNonetheless, there were also notable snubs. James Vanderbilt’s “Nuremberg,” based on Jack El-Hai’s 2013 book The Nazi and the Psychiatrist, and Nia DaCosta’s “Hedda,” a reimagining of Henrik Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler, were left off the list — misses that could impact their awards campaigns.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light” (PBS) — Mark Rylance and Damian Lewis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNick Briggs\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn addition to the film selections, five episodic series were also recognized:\n\n\n“Dark Winds” (AMC) — Episode: “Ábidoo’niidę́ę́ (What He Had Been Told)” by Max Hurwitz and Billy Luther — based on the novels “Dancehall of the Dead” and “The Sinister Pig” by Tony Hillerman; Harper (publisher)\n“Death by Lightning” (Netflix) — Episode: “Destiny of the Republic” by Mike Makowsky — based on the nonfiction book “Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine, and the Murder of a President” by Candice Millard; Anchor (publisher)\n“Dept. Q” (Netflix) — Untitled first episode by Chandni Lakhani and Scott Frank — based on the novel “The Keeper of Lost Causes” by Jussi Adler-Olsen; Penguin (publisher)\n“Slow Horses” (Apple TV) — Episode: “Scars” by Will Smith — based on the novel “London Rules” by Mick Herron; Soho Crime (publisher)\n“Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light” (PBS) — Series by Peter Straughan — based on the novel “The Mirror and the Light” by Hilary Mantel; Henry Holt (publisher)\n\n\n\n\tFounded in 1988, the USC Scripter Awards honor both authors and screenwriters and have become a strong bellwether for the Oscar for best adapted screenplay. For nearly four decades, the Scripters have increasingly aligned with the Academy’s choices, particularly since the best picture expansion in 2009.\n\n\tSince that shift, only two Scripter-winning (and Scripter-eligible) have lost the Academy Award: “Up in the Air” (2009), which lost to “Precious,” and “Little Women” (2019), which lost to “Jojo Rabbit.” Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman” (2018) is the only Oscar winner in that span that failed to earn a Scripter nomination (that was eligible). That year also marked the Scripters’ weakest Oscar overlap — only one of their five nominees, “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” by Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty, earned an Oscar nod. It lost the Scripter to Debra Granik’s “Leave No Trace,” which was not nominated for an Oscar.\n\n\tMore recently, Maggie Gyllenhaal’s “The Lost Daughter” (2021) won the Scripter but lost the Oscar to “CODA,” which was ineligible for the Scripter. The last time both winners were eligible but diverged was in 2005, when “Capote” won the Scripter and “Brokeback Mountain” took home the Oscar.\n\t\n\n\tThe selection committee reviewed 43 film and 64 television adaptations.\n\n\tMystery author Michael Connelly will receive the USC Libraries Literary Achievement Award at the ceremony. His 41 novels, featuring Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller, have inspired multiple screen adaptations, including Amazon Prime Video’s “Bosch” franchise and Netflix’s “The Lincoln Lawyer.”\n\n\tHoward Rodman, a USC professor and former president of the Writers Guild of America, West, chairs the selection committee. Judges include film critics Leonard Maltin and Justin Chang; authors Janet Fitch and Jonathan Lethem; and screenwriters Eric Roth and Tyger Williams.\n\n\tThis year’s eligibility guidelines emphasize adaptations from books, novellas, short stories, graphic novels, plays and magazine articles. Video games and characters from previously published works are no longer eligible. \n\n\tWinners will be announced at a black-tie ceremony on Jan. 24 at USC’s Town and Gown ballroom. Proceeds from the Scripter Awards gala support USC Libraries services, collections and programs.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tIt has been an impossibly sad day, in Hollywood and beyond, as the industry reels from the shocking death of Rob Reiner, who was found dead along with his wife Michele on Sunday in their home. \n\n\tThe son of writer Carl Reiner, Reiner first became known for his role as Meathead in the influential sitcom “All in the Family.” After making a successful segue into filmmaking, he went on to direct classic films including “Stand by Me,” “This Is Spinal Tap,” “When Harry Met Sally” and “A Few Good Men.” Across genres — from the mockumentary riffs of “This Is Spinal Tap” to the heartfelt beats of “When Harry Met Sally” — his work helped define American cinema in the 1980s and ’90s.  Three of Reiner’s films were included in a “100 Best Comedy Movies of All Time” list recently published by Variety.\n\n\t“He made at least six hall-of-fame films, practically one after another over the course of an 11-year run (a number forever associated with him),” wrote Variety film critic Peter DeBruge in a tribute following his death. \n\n\tThroughout his career, he forged deep creative partnerships. Reiner’s long relationship with writer/director Nora Ephron yielded some of the most iconic dialogue in romantic comedy, and his collaborative chemistry with performers like Billy Crystal and Meg Regan helped define their work together. \n\n\tBelow, find a list of Reiner’s most iconic films — and where to stream them online. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThis Is Spinal Tap\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©EMBASSY PICTURES\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSummary: Reiner’s directorial debut established a mainstream format for the mockumentary as it follows the increasingly disastrous U.S tour of the fictional British heavy metal band Spinal Tap. Reiner’s comedic genius shines through in the film’s awkward interviews, technical mishaps and sharp critique of the excesses and egos in the music industry. \n\n\tWhere to Stream: HBO Max, Prime Video (HBO Max add-on), Hulu (HBO Max add-on), Philo (HBO Max add-on)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tStand by Me\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tSummary: Pulled from a Stephen King novella, this is the film that showed Reiner could do something quieter and more grounded. Set in a small Oregon town in the 1950s, the film follows four boys who set out to find the body of a missing child rumored to be lying near the train tracks.\n\n\tWhere to Stream: Netflix\n\n\tVariety Review: “Scripters have written inspired dialog for this quartet of plucky boys at that hard-to-capture age when they’re still young enough to get scared and yet old enough to want to sneak smokes and cuss.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Princess Bride\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©20thCentFox/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tSummary: This cult classic is a prime example of Reiner’s comedic restraint, playing a fairy tale story straight and trusting the script to handle the humor without tipping into parody. Told as a storybook being read aloud, the film centers on Buttercup (Robin Wright), a young woman separated from her true love, Westley, and caught in a plot involving kidnappers, sword fights and a looming forced marriage\n\n\tWhere to Stream: Hulu\n\n\tVariety Review: “Mandy Patinkin especially is a joy to watch and the film comes to life when his longhaired, scruffy cavalier is on screen.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWhen Harry Met Sally\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Columbia Pictures/courtesy Everett Co / Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSummary: The movie that locked in Reiner’s place in the rom-com canon, boosted by Nora Ephron’s script and Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan’s ineffable chemistry. The film tracks the evolving relationship between Harry and Sally over more than a decade as they repeatedly cross paths and debate whether men and women can ever really be friends.\n\n\tWhere to Stream: Starz, Hulu (Starz add-on), Prime Video (Starz add-on), Philo (Starz add-on) and Fubo TV (Starz add-on)\n\n\tVariety Review: “Rob Reiner directs with deftness and sincerity, making the material seem more engaging than it is, at least until the plot machanics begin to unwind and the film starts to seem shapeless.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMisery\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSummary: After a car accident leaves him stranded, a novelist is rescued by a former nurse who turns out to be his most obsessed fan. Confined almost entirely to a single house, the film is a departure fro, Reiner’s conversational films, building tension through isolation and control (and Kathy Bates’ exceptional Oscar-turning role). \n\n\tWhere to Stream: Available to purchase on Prime Video and Apple TV\n\n\tVariety Review: “Bates has a field day with her role, creating a quirky, memorable object of hate.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tA Few Good Men\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Eve\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tSummary: Reiner keeps the staging direct and uncluttered in this performance-driven courtroom drama adapted from Aaron Sorkin’s play. The fim follows a young Navy lawyer as he’s assigned to defend two Marines accused of murdering a fellow soldier at Guantánamo bay, featuring a high-wattage  ensemble cast consisting of Jack Nicholsan, Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon and more.\n\n\tWhere to Stream: Philo\n\n\tVariety Review: ‘A Few Good Men’ is a big-time, mainstream Hollywood movie par excellence. It’s got all the elements for across-the-boards acceptance — juicy parts for some of the top stars in the business, a Broadway pedigree, a riveting David-vs.-Goliath courtroom battle, serious attitudes that won’t threaten or offend anyone, and skilled filmmaking hands at the top of their game.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe American President\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSummary: Reiner reunites with Aaron Sorkin for this glossy, mid-’90s studio movie, starring Michael Douglas as a sitting U.S president as he begins a romantic relationship with an environmental lobbyist.\n\n\tWhere to Stream: Available to rent/purchase on Prime Video and Apple TV\n\n\tVariety Review: “Working with Reiner again after their successful teaming on A Few Good Men, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has cooked up some reasonably engaging banter for his two bright, quick-witted, hard-driving leading characters without letting it get too artificial. Douglas and Bening are more than up to the challenge, delivering winning turns as A-plus personality types.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tOscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Milk”) has signed on to narrate “Horse Power,” a new project from Plimsoll Productions (“A Real Bug’s Life,” “Hostile Planet”) and EOS Films. The film, set to be distributed globally by SK Films, is described as “an epic journey across continents that celebrates the extraordinary abilities of horses and their enduring bond with humanity.”\n\n\tBrolin became attached to the project thanks to his history as a lifelong horseman. “Horse Power” centers on eight-year-old Julaa as she trains with her Mongolian horse. The film focuses on “wild herds navigating untamed landscapes, legendary desert stallions known for their speed and stamina, steadfast service horses performing under pressure and miniature therapy horses offering comfort where it’s needed most.”\n\t\n\n\t“Seeing horses on an 80-foot screen in 3D offers a visceral experience like no other,” said Mark Brownlow, head of natural history at Plimsoll Productions, which is an ITV company. “There’s something uniquely cinematic about the way horses move through the world, and IMAX allows us to lean into that grandeur. — the thunder of hooves, the intimacy of connection and the sheer presence of these iconic animals that are an essential part of our shared history. ‘Horse Power’ is the kind of global, emotionally rich story the Giant Screen was made for, and we’re thrilled to bring audiences along for the ride.”\n\n\n\tAmerican Wild Horse Conservation supported the film with funding. “America has an everlasting love affair with horses,” said American Wild Horse Conservation board chair Patricia Miller. “‘Horse Power’ will move audiences to see America’s wild horses not just as icons of freedom, but as living, breathing symbols of our shared heritage—worthy of lasting protection. Through breathtaking IMAX storytelling and immersive education programs, people will feel the beauty of these wild herds and understand what’s at stake in keeping them wild.”\n\t\n\n\tPlimsoll’s recent credits include Emmys for “A Real Bug’s Life” (Disney+/National Geographic). It also worked with Blumhouse TV on Netflix’s “Nightmares of Nature,” and was also behind “Tiny World” (Apple TV+) and “Super/Natural” (Disney+/National Geographic).\n\n\tHere’s a first look:\n\n  \n\n",

Glass -- told TMZ the fat-shaming allegations were blown out of the water by 18 witnesses in sworn court declarations, ultimately forcing the dancers to drop their appeal over the dismissed claims.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Lizzo\n              \n                          \n                Marty Singer\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Hip Hop\n              \n                          \n                Instagram\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

As you know ... it was a tough go for the eight-time Super Bowl Champion -- who went 4-8 and missed out on getting a bowl game.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          She shared a carousel of photos in a recap after the team played their last home game -- a 32-25 loss to Duke -- all while taking a swipe at her critics.\n      \n    \n          \"I've loved supporting @billbelichick at his adult all-male football league competitions this season,\" Hudson wrote. \"Until next year, Kenan!\"\n      \n    \n        Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n      \n    \n          BB's first season was also marked with tons of drama off the field. Hudson has found herself in a feud with investigative journalist Pablo Torre ... even claiming she planned to sue him -- which came after he spent the last few months diving into the couple's romance.\n      \n    \n          But for now, the two have the offseason to reset and recharge before the next college football campaign, and it seems like Belichick will have to carve out some time to catch a few more cheerleading events!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jordon Hudson\n              \n                          \n                Bill Belichick\n              \n                          \n                College Football\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Football\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tMartin Scorsese honored the late Reiners in an essay published in The New York Times, writing, “Rob Reiner was my friend, and so was Michele. From now on, I’ll have to use the past tense, and that fills me with such profound sadness. But there’s no other choice.”\n\n\tThe Reiners, aged 78 and 70, were found dead in their Brentwood home on Dec. 14 with knife wounds. Their 32-year-old son, Nick Reiner, has been arrested and charged with two counts of murder.\n\t\n\n\tScorsese first got to know Rob Reiner shortly after moving to Los Angeles in the early 1970s, when he started going to get-togethers hosted by George Memmoli and filled with comedians and actors.\n\n\n\t“Rob and I were both Eastern transplants, in a way,” Scorsese wrote. Reiner came from show business royalty, his parents being the performers Carl and Estelle Reiner. “This was 100 percent New York humor, and it was in the air I breathed.”\n\n\t“Right away, I loved hanging out with Rob. We had a natural affinity for each other. He was hilarious and sometimes bitingly funny, but he was never the kind of guy who would take over the room,” Scorsese wrote. “He had a beautiful sense of uninhibited freedom, fully enjoying the life of the moment, and he had a great barreling laugh. When they honored him at Lincoln Center, Michael McKean did a bit, which was a brilliant parody of solemn official tribute speeches. Before he got to the punchline, Rob laughed so hard you could hear it throughout the auditorium.”\n\n\tScorsese’s favorite film directed by Reiner is “Misery,” which he described as “a very special film, beautifully acted by Kathy Bates and James Caan.” And he wrote that “This Is Spinal Tap” is “in a class of its own … an immaculate creation.” When Scorsese was casting his 2013 film “The Wolf of Wall Street,” he “immediately thought of Rob” to play the father of Leonardo DiCaprio’s Jordan Belfort.\n\t\n\n\t“He could improvise with the best, he was a master at comedy, he worked beautifully with Leo and the rest of the guys, and he understood the human predicament of his character: The man loved his son, he was happy with his success, but he knew that he was destined for a fall,” Scorsese wrote of Reiner. “There’s that wonderful moment where Rob watches as Jon Favreau explains to Leo that he can get out relatively unscathed if he just walks away from his company before the S.E.C. has a chance to charge him with violations. The look on Rob’s face, as he realizes that Leo is hesitating and that he ultimately won’t stop, is so eloquent. ‘You got all the money in the world,’ he says. ‘You need everybody else’s money?’ A loving father, mystified by his son.” \n\n\tScorsese added, “I was moved by the delicacy and openness of his performance when we shot it, moved once again as we brought the scene together in the edit and moved as I watched the finished picture. Now, it breaks my heart to even think of the tenderness of Rob’s performance in this and other scenes.”\n\n\tThe filmmaker concluded his essay: “What happened to Rob and Michele is an obscenity, an abyss in lived reality. The only thing that will help me to accept it is the passing of time. So, like all of their loved ones and their friends — and these were people with many, many friends — I have to be allowed to imagine them alive and well … and that one day, I’ll be at a dinner or a party and find myself seated next to Rob, and I’ll hear his laugh and see his beatific face and laugh at his stories and relish his natural comic timing, and feel lucky all over again to have him as a friend.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel has delivered a scathing — and typically comical — attack on president Donald Trump in a special Christmas Day address to the U.K. on Channel 4.\n\n\tFor its 2025 annual Alternative Christmas Message, broadcast by the Brit network since 1993 with an eclectic array of guests invited to speak over the years, Channel 4 turned to Kimmel, who used the opportunity to claim that “tyranny is booming” in the U.S. thanks to Trump, who he said “thinks he is our king.”\n\t\n\n\tKimmel also reflected on the controversial — and brief — suspension of his talk show “Jimmy Kimmel Live” from ABC after comments he made in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder, accusing Trump of trying to “shut me up because I don’t adore him in the way he likes to be adored.”\n\n\n\tHis return to airwaves he likened to an (early) “Christmas miracle,” asserting it was because people stood up to support free expression of speech. “Our show came back stronger than ever. We won, the President lost and now I’m back on the air every night giving the most powerful politician on earth a right and richly deserved bollocking,” he said, deploying a rather British term. “That’s a word, right, I used it properly?”\n\n\tKimmel concluded his message, broadcast shortly after the more traditional King’s Christmas Day speech, by apologizing to the U.K. for the current state of the U.S., asserting that Americans are “not all like” Trump and urging Brits to hold out. \n\n\t“No one knows better than you we’re always just a little bit late to the game, but do we come through in the end? Maybe. Give us about three years. Please.”\n\t\n\n\tSee the full transcript of Kimmel’s Christmas Day message below: \n\n\tHi I’m Jimmy Kimmel.\n\n\tI have no idea if you know who I am, but I was asked to deliver this year’s Alternative Christmas Message (which I’ve heard is a big deal) so I hope you do, but if not I host what you call a chat show (we call it a talk show) in what you call the colonies, I think? I honestly have no idea what’s going on over there.\n\n\tI do know what’s going on over here though, and I can tell you that, from a fascism perspective, this has been a really great year. Tyranny is booming over here.\n\n\tYou may have read in your colourful newspapers my country’s President would like to shut me up because I don’t adore him in the way he likes to be adored. The American government made a threat against me and the company I work for, and all of a sudden we were off the air. But then, you know what happened? A Christmas miracle happened. Well, it was September, it was a September miracle. But the holiday does seem to come earlier and earlier every year, doesn’t it?\n\n\tMillions and millions of people stood up and said: ‘No, this is not acceptable’. People who never watched my show, people who were on record saying they hate my show spoke out, they marched, they did this all to support the right to a free expression of speech and because so many people spoke out, we came back. Our show came back stronger than ever. We won, the President lost and now I’m back on the air every night givin’ the most powerful politician on earth a right and richly deserved bollocking. That’s a word, right, I used it properly?\n\n\tAnd the reason I’m telling you this story is because maybe you’re thinking: ‘Oh a government silencing its critics is something that happens in places like Russia, or North Korea, or LA, not the UK’. Well, that’s what we thought and now we’ve got King Donny the Eighth calling for executions. It happens fast.\n\n\tYou know it’s funny we Americans are very proud of not having a king. It’s kind of why we left. Earlier this year tens of millions of us marched at protests called No Kings. You had some of those there. And just for the record we have nothing against your king. I mean I don’t know if you know this, but his son lives here. We just – well some of us – just have a problem with the guy who thinks he is our king.\n\t\n\n\tHere in the United States right now we are both figuratively and literally tearing down the structures of our democracy. From the free press, to science, to medicine, to judicial independence, to the actual White House itself, we are a right mess. And we know this is also affecting you, and I just wanted to say sorry. And we want you to know or, at least I want you to know, that we’re not all like him. We’re not all like that.\n\n\tLook I know (from the musical Hamilton) that our countries didn’t start off on the greatest note, but I also know (from seeing Love Actually) that we have a special relationship. So, if I might speak on behalf of my country – which I most certainly do not – our message to you, our friends across the pond this Christmas is: don’t give up on us. We’re going through a bit of a wobble right now, but we’ll come around. It may not seem like it, but we love you guys. We even love the things about you that you don’t like, like Simon Cowell for instance. We are not bright. We’re Americans. No one knows better than you we’re always just a little bit late to the game, but do we come through in the end? Maybe. Give us about three years. Please. Thank you for your patience, and thank you for Spider-Man. Merry Christmas, and happy holidays.\n",

    "body": "\n\tImani Smith, a former child actor who starred in “The Lion King” on Broadway, was found dead on Dec. 21, according to a press release from Middlesex County, N.J., Prosecutor Yolanda Ciccone and Chief Thomas Bryan of the Edison Police Department. She was 25.\n\n\tPolice responded to a 911 call reporting a stabbing at 9:18 a.m. on Dec. 21. Upon arrival, they found Smith with stab wounds and transported her to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. After an investigation, Edison police arrested Jordan D. Jackson-Small, 35, without incident and charged him with first-degree murder, second-degree endangering the welfare of a child, third-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, and fourth-degree unlawful possession of a weapon. \n\t\n\n\tAccording to the press release, Smith and Jackson-Small knew each other prior to the incident. Smith’s aunt, who started a GoFundMe to raise money for their family, wrote that Jackson-Small was Smith’s boyfriend. He is being held at the Middlesex County Adult Correctional Center.\n\n\n\t“Imani had her whole life ahead of her,” her aunt wrote. “She was a vivacious, loving and fiercely talented person. A true triple-threat performer, she most notably played the role of Young Nala on Broadway in Disney’s ‘Lion King’ — an experience that reflected the joy, creativity, and light she put into the world.”\n\n\tAccording to Playbill, Smith played young Nala in “The Lion King” from Sept. 27, 2011, to Sept. 23, 2012. Her mother, Monique Rance-Helper, is a hair stylist who has worked on the “In the Heights” film, FX’s “Pose” series and Broadway shows “Eclipsed” “Once on This Island,” “The Lightning Thief” and more.\n\t\n\n\tSmith is survived by a 3-year-old son, her parents and her her two siblings.\n",

The James Cameron film, which follows 2009’s “Avatar” and 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water” earned more than $450 million globally after its first week of release, including $119 million at the domestic box office.\n\n\tNow, fans of the film franchise can get a behind-the-scenes look at the special effects and animation that went into bringing the characters to life in a new book titled “The Making of Avatar.” Released on December 19, the officially-licensed book has already landed on Amazon’s top movie books charts online.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNEW RELEASE\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Making of Avatar\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tFrom publisher DK and 20th Century Studios, “The Making of Avatar” offers an in-depth look into the filmmaking process for all three “Avatar” films, with interviews with the creative team and cast, a peek at the storyboards, plus a look into the digital animation and performance capture process.

    "body": "\n\tHowie Klein, a veteran record executive, radio DJ and political activist who was a leader in the famously artist-friendly Warner Music family during its golden era of the 1980s and early ‘90s, died Wednesday after a long battle with pancreatic cancer, according to a social media post from his sister. He was 77.\n\n\tHe was a top executive at Sire Records during the label’s peak era — a time when the label had everyone from the Smiths and Depeche Mode to Madonna and Lou Reed on its roster — and later was president of Warner’s Reprise label from 1989 to 2001. He was a co-founder of the San Francisco-based 415 Records during the 1970s, and was a strong and vocal presence in the music industry’s anti-censorship efforts in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, focusing on political activism in his later years.\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Brooklyn in 1948, Klein began his music career at Long Island’s Stony Brook University, where he began writing about music and later booked many legendary artists to perform at the school, a list that reads like a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame from the late 1960s: the Who, Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, Otis Redding, Pink Floyd, the Doors, Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, Tim Buckley, Jackson Browne, and many others. \n\n\tHe spent several years traveling in Asia and Europe before settling in San Francisco in 1976. There, he became a popular DJ at the city’s KSAN-FM and was a vocal supporter of the city’s then-nascent punk and alternative scenes; on the station, he interviewed such acts as the Sex Pistols, Devo, Iggy Pop, the Cramps and others. In 1978, he co-founded the San Francisco-based 415 Records, which released singles and albums by Romeo Void, Wire Train, the Nuns, Translator and others, several of which were distributed by major labels.\n\t\n\n\tKlein moved to Los Angeles to join Sire Records in 1987, which was then at the peak of its reign as a mecca of alternative music. He played a key role in bringing Lou Reed to the label and helping to launch his legendary “New York” album, which revitalized the singer-songwriter’s career and was seen by many as his late peak. Klein often spoke of the signing as a full-circle moment, as he had seen Reed perform one of his last shows with the Velvet Underground during the band’s residency at New York’s Max’s Kansas City nightclub in the summer of 1970.\n\n\tAfter just two years he was elevated to president of Reprise Records, the Warner label founded by Frank Sinatra, a post he held for the next 13 years. Among the dozens of acts he worked closely with during these years are Green Day, Ice-T, the Ramones, the Pretenders, Neil Young, Alanis Morissette, Eric Clapton, Fleetwood Mac and many others. \n\n\tDuring these years the music industry, and Warner Music in particular, was a frequent target of censorship efforts by right-wing organizations — notably the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), many of them aimed at gangsta rap and heavy metal, and Klein became an outspoken purveyor of free speech in the business and the country. He was a leader of the Rock the Vote campaign and other efforts, and had found the causes that would occupy much of his later life. His efforts were recognized twice with Spirit of Liberty Awards from People for the American Way; in 1999 he shared that honor with filmmaker and actor Rob Reiner. \n\n\tIn 2000, he was honored by the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California with its Bill of Rights Award.\n\n\tIn 2001, following Time Warner’s ill-fated merger with AOL, Klein accepted a buyout and resigned from his post. Ironically, a day after his resignation, his successor rejected the new album from Wilco, “Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,” setting off a controversy, documented in the film “I Am Trying to Break Your Heart,” that ultimately resulted in a bidding war over the album that saw a different Warner label, Nonesuch, re-signing the band.\n\n\tIn his later years, Klein published a political blog and social media account titled DownWithTyranny! and worked with such organizations as the Blue America PAC, the Progressive Congress Action Fund and others. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Maxine Plays Dead,” the Dec. 24 episode of “Palm Royale,” now streaming on Apple TV.\n\n\t“Palm Royale’s” Maxine and Douglas may be divorced, but their unmistakable connection crossed the point of no return this week when she was a surprise guest at her own funeral and his devastation sent him into an unhinged frenzy. \n\n\tWhen a body turned up in the Palm Royale pool, everyone assumed it was Maxine (Kristen Wiig) because, well, it looked like her. But society friends Dinah (Leslie Bibb) and Evelyn (Allison Janney) — along with Ann (Mindy Cohn), as Palm Beach’s resident reporter — quickly discovered at the morgue that the deceased is not Maxine.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Perry (Jordan Bridges) delivered “Maxine’s” ashes to a devastated Douglas (Josh Lucas), as the town gathered for the funeral, completely unaware that the very much alive Maxine is hiding inside the casket. The eccentric spiritualist Mary delivered a message from the real dead woman — Maxine’s twin, Mirabelle — then lifted the casket lid and saw that Maxine was there. Chaos erupted: mourners gasp, Mitzi (Kaia Gerber) ran screaming, and an inconsolable Douglas eulogized his ex, telling the “dead” Maxine how much he loves her.\n\n\tLater that night, Maxine and Douglas connected, and she asked if he truly meant what he said at the church, that he loves her… but his answer isn’t exactly what she expected.\n\n\t“He’s untethered, he’s lost, and he’s terrified,” Josh Lucas tells Variety. “He’s in such pain. He’s just devastated… And then you think, is it because he loves her so much or is it because he’s totally a narcissist?”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDouglas (Josh Lucas) and Mitzi (Kaia Geber) attend Maxine’s funeral on ‘Palm Royale.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tErica Parise\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMaxine and Douglas’ love affair has changed since moving to Palm Royale. “When you have a relationship that’s that long — and even though you can dismiss it as these two are silly people — their souls are exploded,” he says. “So I don’t think Douglas is thinking about putting the pieces back together. I think he’s now truly unleashed. … His world has been his oyster, and it no longer is.”\n\n\tIt began with his infidelity and “each piece of it, it just keeps getting worse,” Lucas adds. “He loses Maxine, causes her to have a heart attack, and then when he finally [completely] loses her, I think he’s not a man who’s ever gonna put it back together again. He is not going to therapy.”\n\n\tLucas believes that up to the point he met Maxine, women were truly just “transactional” for him —and marrying Linda/Penelope (Laura Dern) was just “the next right thing to do for his life, career and money.”\n\n\tHe continues, “I think when he met Maxine, he truly fell in love. My sense of him is that he actually did have integrity in it, particularly in his mind that he was loyal and faithful, and he took great pride in that because he was flying all over the world. And sure, he would flirt with stewardesses, but he wouldn’t do anything.”\n\n\tThere is something childlike about Douglas — or dog-like, as Lucas says.\n\n\t“He’s a Labrador puppy, who just is having the best time destroying the house, but then realizes, ‘Oh, my God, I destroyed the house!’” he says with a grin. “Look, he comes from incredible privilege. One of the things I think is so terrific about this show is the candy-coated confection of it all — but in the center of it is kind of this bitter pill all the time of reality.”\n\n\tThat dichotomy was part of the character design from the beginning. “Abe Sylvia and the creators, I don’t want to say in any way are making fun of these people because they’re not. These people exist, particularly back in this time,” he says of the 1970s setting. “But there’s obviously a through line to these, particularly white men of incredible wealth and privilege who just have no real understanding of the world. They’re truly in their own bubble. And Douglas has been in it his entire life.”\n\t\n\n\tIn a way, Maxine and Douglas’ marriage is playing out in a very realistic 1970s scenario, when men had their roles in the family and career, and women had theirs. Pre-Palm Royale, Maxine was a traditional wife, and Douglas was just fine with that.\n\n\t“She talks about it — she’s a trad wife, and she takes great pride in that,” he says. “There’s honor in it. I do think that’s a very interesting thing that’s even going on in today’s time — the value or devalue of that. That’s where the show finds all these lovely through lines — Roe v Wade, women’s rights and the civil rights movement. But Douglas and Maxine are completely devoid of that.”\n\n\tDuring a recent Q&A, Sylvia reminded the audience that during this period of time, in certain parts of this country, a woman could not have a checking account without her husband’s signature.\n\n\t“Those would be things that Douglas would think would be good. And Maxine, her eyes are obviously being opened throughout the show by all these women who are showing her these layers of what’s possible in how society’s changing,” Lucas points out. “But I also think she takes great pride in being a wife who really loves and takes care of her husband. … I think we really try and stay away from pounding any sort of obvious political or psycho sociological message and just purely allow the show to exist as a confection.”\n\n\t“Palm Royale” Season 2 is currently streaming exclusively on Apple TV+, with new episodes arriving weekly on Wednesdays. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSpoiler warning: This article contains spoilers for “Marty Supreme,” now in theaters.\n\n\tJosh Safdie‘s “Marty Supreme” is galvanized by an invigorating performance by Timothée Chalamet as the cocky young table tennis champion Marty Mauser. Safdie and his crew faithfully recreated the world of 1950s ping pong players in New York, Tokyo and beyond, then populated that milieu with a cast of memorable supporting characters from movie star Kay Stone, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, to her ruthless businessman husband, played by Mr. Wonderful himself, Kevin O’Leary.\n\t\n\n\tThe details of the parlors and matches are so carefully rendered that it’s no surprise that Safdie is very familiar with that world. In fact, his 2008 film “The Pleasure of Being Robbed” features a sequence set in a Chinatown table tennis parlor. \n\n\n\t“The people who excelled at table tennis were often people who didn’t fit anywhere else,” says Safdie in the film’s press materials. “It wasn’t respected, so naturally it attracted weirdos, purists, obsessives.”\n\n\tIn addition to doing extensive historical research, the crew consulted experts, including Steve Grant, publisher of Table Tennis History magazine, who spoke to Variety about the inspiration for the film.\n\t\n\t\tWas Marty Mauser based on a real person?\t\n\n\tMarty Mauser, played by Chalamet, is based on a real table tennis champion of the 1950s, Marty Reisman, who died in 2012. Sports Illustrated called him “the game’s most celebrated hustler.” While the film is only loosely inspired by his story, the character definitely shares similarities with Reisman, Grant explains.\n\t\n\n\t“He was very good at marketing himself,” Grant says, “That was his biggest skill. Of course, he was a very good player.” But like Marty Mauser, who plays pretty loose with the truth, Reisman likely inflated his stories, Grant says. Reisman’s book, “The Money Player,” is a “great book about his career back in the ’50s,” Grant explains. “But don’t take everything in it as the word of truth. He liked to exaggerate things.”\n\n\tWhen Safdie came across an old copy of “The Money Player,” he sparked to the idea of a story based on Reisman. “When I read that the sport was filling stadiums in the U.K. and throughout Europe, I realized that it was entirely plausible for a kid in 1952 to actually believe he could parlay the game into a life of fame and glory,” Safdie said in the press materials.\n\t\n\t\tHow many of Marty Supreme’s stunts were real?\t\n\n\tWhile many of Marty Mauser’s antics stretch credulity, the real Reisman, nicknamed “the needle” for his slight build and fast swing, was known for his showmanship and hustle. He could split a cigarette in half with a ping pong ball from across the net and would play blindfolded or sitting down if the stakes were high enough. As shown in the film, he and a partner did tour the world with the Harlem Globetrotters with a comedy ping pong routine in which they hit balls with frying pans and sneakers.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tVariety’s announcement of “The Money Player” option\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe real Reisman pulled off enough wild escapades to fill a whole other movie, according to an extensive Sports Illustrated profile — as he traveled the world, he was smuggling and selling goods, from nylon stockings to fine crystal, and challenging heads of state to high-stakes games. He really did fly on a military transport, as shown in the film, and did briefly work in a shoe store. Reisman told the magazine his book had sold to the movies, and he proposed that Robert De Niro could play him. But although it was optioned after publication, according to a 1974 Variety article, the project never got off the ground.\n\t\n\t\tDid Reisman really lose the World Championship to a Japanese player?\t\n\n\tReisman traveled to India, not Japan as in the movie, to compete against Hiroji Satoh. As depicted in the film, he took a hard loss to Satoh, who was using a new sponge rubber-coated type of paddle. But the loss came in round 64, not the final. “The truth was he would have had to win five more matches in 1952 to win the title, and he was not the top favorite,” Grant explains.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWere there other Jewish table tennis champions? \t\n\n\t“Fellow Jewish New Yorker Dick Miles won many championships in the 1940s and ’50s, well before Reisman won much of anything,” Grant explains. In fact, Jewish Europeans, especially Hungarians, dominated table tennis in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1950s, Asian and particularly Japanese players began to gain prominence in the sport.\n\t\n\t\tWere any other characters based on real people?\t\n\n\tWhile many of the film’s characters feel deeply authentic, most are fictional, with the exception of Koto Endo, played by real-life champion Koto Kawaguchi and based on Reisman’s competitor Satoh. There’s also basketball star George “The Ice Man” Gervin, who plays a character based on Herwald Lawrence, who owned a ping pong parlor that was the first Black-owned business in Times Square.\n\n\tPlaywright David Mamet has a cameo in the film and he has a historic ping pong connection. Mamet, who was a table tennis hustler himself in his college days, used to frequent Reisman’s table tennis gym on the Upper West Side, along with other notables including Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrank Darabont was still new to retirement when Netlix released the first season of “Stranger Things” in 2016. He had wrapped his final directing gig — the 2013 “Mob City” episode “Red Light”— and moved with his wife to California’s Central Coast, where he could bask in the wake of an incredible filmography that included “The Shawshank Redemption,” “The Green Mile,” “The Mist,” episodes of “The Walking Dead,” “The Shield,” “Tales from the Crypt” and more.\n\t\n\n\tAbout a decade into retirement, however, Darabont received a call from his agent, informing him that Matt and Ross Duffer, the creators of “Stranger Things,” were fans of his work. The feeling was mutual, as Darabont and his wife had binged the Netflix series’ first four seasons several times over. The agents set up a friendly meeting between them when the Duffers were still developing the show’s fifth and final season.\n\n\tShortly thereafter, Dan Trachtenberg, who was attached to direct two episodes of “Stranger Things 5,” dropped out due to a scheduling conflict with his next film, “Predator: Badlands.” In a Hail Mary, the Duffers offered Darabont to take Trachtenberg’s place, and after a week’s consideration, he decided to come out of retirement to join the “Stranger Things” team on set.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWinona Ryder as Joyce Byers and Noah Schnapp as Will Byers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDarabont, 66, directed Episodes 3 and 5 of the final season. Episode 3 released in with Volume 1 on Nov. 26. Titled “The Turnbow Trap,” the episode is packed with action and emotion in the Upside Down and the Rightside Up, showcasing a triumphant return for the director. Episode 5, titled “Shock Jock,” will kick off the three-episode second volume on Dec. 25. (The “Stranger Things” series finale releases in theaters and on Netflix Dec. 31.)\n\t\n\n\tBetween the volumes, Variety spoke with the director to hear about his experience working on “Stranger Things” and his return to the filmmaking craft after twelve years since he last sat in the director’s chair.\n\t\n\t\tWe heard that you were a fan of “Stranger Things” before you met the Duffer brothers. How did you get into the show?\t\n\n\tMy wife and I were fans of the show from early on. We actually had watched all four seasons three or four or maybe even five times. It was so good. Then one day out of the blue, my agent called me and said, “The agent in the office next to me represents the Duffer brothers, and he just wanted me to tell you that they’re big fans of yours.” I said, “That’s fantastic. That’s very flattering. I’m big fans of theirs.” So I thought, “Well, next time I’m in L.A., I’ll get together with them for lunch and just compliment them.” I also was fascinated to know where the heck they came from, because I never heard of the Duffer brothers before they created this huge success on Netflix. So I had lunch with them when I was down in L.A. and I think about a week later, my agent called me again and said they’re inviting you to come direct an episode.\n\t\n\t\tAnd what was your initial reaction to that?\t\n\n\tI hadn’t done it in a while, but they said it’s like riding a bicycle: You don’t forget. And they were right. From the first moment on set, there was nothing unfamiliar about the process for me, though it had been about 13 years. The one episode offer wound up being two episodes and six months in Atlanta. It was a hell of a great experience.\n\t\n\t\tThe Duffer brothers told us that you took about a week to consider the offer. What was going through your mind during that week and what made you want to accept?\t\n\n\tWell, once you’re retired, it’s bliss. My wife and I live on the Central Coast in Monterey, where we don’t have the pressures of Hollywood on our back. I’m enjoying life, and for once I’m no longer the workaholic that I was for almost 30 years in Hollywood. So I had to wrestle with that question and, of course, talk to my wife about it, because I wasn’t going to go to Atlanta unless she came also. I love being married, and I’m not going to be in some place for months without her. We also have five chihuahuas that we would have to take. It was kind of a big move, especially once it became two episodes. We were looking at six months living in a different place. When you’re young and single, it’s not that big of a deal, but when you’re an old fart like me who has sunk roots in a community and is comfortable being an unemployed bum, you have to ask yourself “Do I really do this?” But ultimately, it was my love for the show and my wife’s love for the show that kind of overruled all those other concerns and we said, “What the heck? Let’s do it!” I’m glad we did.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNatalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhile you were considering, were you allowed to read the scripts for the episodes that you would direct?\t\n\n\tYeah, they had sent me the scripts and I thought they were terrific. I asked for all of the scripts that they had written thus far so I could track what was going on in the whole thing. They were very generous with sending me those, as long as it was kept under strict secrecy. They’re not quite the nuclear codes, but they’re pretty close. The fascinating thing about our culture is how much people want to dig into this stuff instead of wait to be surprised by what they see on screen. I am the ultimate no-spoilers guy. When I was in junior high, I went to go see “Soylent Green” and some asshole fellow students told me before I went in, “Oh, Soylent Green is people.” I’ve never forgiven them. It’s part of the reason why I’m not on social media and I’m also reluctant to watch trailers. Too much is given away. If I have an interest in something, I want to enjoy it fresh.\n\t\n\t\tDid you notice anything different in the process of filmmaking returning to the director’s chair after 12 or 13 years?\t\n\n\tOh gosh, yeah. Only on “Mob City” did I finally transition from film to digital, and I ended up loving it. It helps a director so much because you don’t ever have to call a cut. Whenever a director calls cut, the energy on a set dissipates. Now you can just say, “Everybody back to one” and the energy remains where it needs to be. The actors remain in the same headspace as you roll three or four takes before calling cut. I love that aspect of it. Filmmakers have so many new tools now. [On “Stranger Things”] our DP was shooting with a techno crane, which can sometimes be frustrating, but can do brilliant things. Also the camera operator is no longer where you’d think he is. He’s not by the camera anymore, but often in some tent off to the side. Same with whoever’s pulling focus. They’re longer next to the camera all the time. So much has been outsourced to these technological devices. But I have to praise this crew. They were absolutely wonderful across the board. A director’s relationship with their crew is very important to me, especially the DP and AD, and I had great on both. Brett Jutkiewicz was my DP and Lisa Rowe was my AD, and they were both fantastic. The Duffers know how to crew up a show, and some of these folks had been with them since Season 1. There were so many resources all around me that could help answer any question. It was a great, collaborative vibe.\n\t\n\t\tEpisode 3 has lots of emotional scenes, including heavy dialogues between Will (Noah Schnapp) and Joyce (Winona Ryder), Will and Robin (Maya Hawke) and Holly (Nell Fisher) and Henry (Jamie Campbell Bower). What was it like working with this ensemble to create those dramatic dynamics?\t\n\n\tI’ve always said that if you have the right actor, there’s not much that they need to hear from a director. I learned that on my very first theatrical feature, “The Shawshank Redemption.” Sometimes a director can get too much into an actor’s ear. Tim Robbins, for example, loves conversations with the director. Morgan Freeman does not. He’s a very intuitive, very instinctive actor, and does a brilliant work. Both of them do. I remember midway through the shoot, I was talking to Morgan about whatever scene we’re going to shoot next and I could see his eyes glazing over. He was just being very polite and listening to me, so I stopped myself and said, “Morgan, you really don’t need to hear this, do you?” and he goes “No, just tell me where to stand and how to turn. That kind of stuff.” From that moment on, I let him do his job. It was a great lesson for a first-time director. Every actor is different.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDid the cast of “Stranger Things” prefer more dialogue and direction, or did most of them take control of their own performances? Or was there a mix?\t\n\n\tThey’d been doing it for so long, especially the youngsters who were around 10 when they started and now they’re young adults. They’ve been with these characters for half of their lives, so they’re pretty dialed in. There were little, physical things that needed direction, like when Dustin [Gaten Matarazzo] comes out of the van and drops this big bag of tools right in front of the lens. To have it fall exactly where the camera is going to land took a lot of practice and blocking. I think there were five takes or something. There were also things like Caleb [McLaughlin] running down the stairs after he’s thrown acetone at the Demogorgon. I needed him to pause and look back at a certain moment because I knew something was going to be added in post that needed an extra beat of time. You’re sort of doing all this calculus on set to make sure it can be cut together right. That’s usually where I get more specific and precise with an actor, but aside from that, they know their characters. As a director, my job is to provide the raw materials for what you need in the editing room and also to be head cheerleader on set. You’re cheering everybody on and encouraging them. A small bit of encouragement or recognition from the director can fuel you for another 24 hours of exhausting work\n\t\n\t\tHas this experience made you want to direct more, or are you comfortable returning to retirement?\t\n\n\tI really do love being retired. However, I also love being on a set with creative people, as long as I’m not fighting battles with some evil empire, studio, or network. I bless Netflix for being so supportive. If you have a good situation like that and it can be about the creative process, then its a pleasure. So my longwinded answer winds up being, it depends. If there’s a friendly situation and I’m excited enough about the material, then it’s certainly a possibility. I’m not ruling anything out, but it would have to be something special. “Stranger Things” was a special opportunity for me to be a small part of a very large, wonderful thing that so many people love. I’m grateful to the Duffers for that opportunity. It will always be a great memory working with them and that cast and crew. I will love seeing where their careers take them. They all have such potential and they’re such good people.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI know you don’t like spoilers, but what can we look forward to in Episode 5?\t\n\n\tI think in Episode 5 you’re gonna get some really cool stuff with Henry. I don’t think I’m really spoiling anything by saying that you can you see in Episode 3 that we’re kind of heading into his story more. It was a great thrill to do. We have a lot of good acting and good scenes that you can look forward to.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” dominated at the box office on Christmas Eve.\n\n\tJames Cameron’s third sci-fi epic unwrapped $10.7 million on Wednesday from 3,800 North American theaters. That’s less than its predecessor, 2022’s $2 billion behemoth “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which earned $14.8 million on Christmas Eve. However that year, Christmas Eve fell on a Saturday, which is a much more popular day of the week for moviegoing.\n\n\n\t“Avatar 3,” from Disney’s 20th Century Studios, is projected to collect $75 million to $80 million between Thursday and Sunday. So far, the big-budget film has grossed $129.6 million domestically and $353.7 million overseas, bringing its global tally to $483.3 million after a week of release.\n\t\n\n\tThree new films — A24’s Timothée Chalamet-led sports dramedy “Marty Supreme,” the Focus Features musical drama “Song Sung Blue” and Sony’s disaster comedy “Anaconda” — were playing in previews ahead of their Christmas Day debuts. \n\n\t“Anaconda” made $2.1 million from 2,808 theaters during Wednesday’s previews. The PG-13 adventure is expected to secure around $20 million between Thursday and Sunday. A $45 million-budgeted meta-reboot, “Anaconda” follows best friends who travel to the jungle to pursue their childhood dream of remaking their all-time favorite movie (you guessed it!) 1997’s “Anaconda.” The project starts to unravel when life imitates art and a real anaconda begins hunting them down.\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” was ever-so-slightly behind “Anaconda” on box office charts with $2.01 million from 2,668 venues during Wednesday’s previews. After one weekend in limited release, the R-rated film has generated $3.15 million to date. “Marty Supreme” is targeting a launch above $20 million through the four-day holiday frame. That’s a great start for the arthouse film, which carries a hefty $70 million budget. It helps that Chalamet, who stars as the fictional table tennis champ Marty Mauser, has been a one-man marketing machine, going to great lengths — and heights — to get out the word about the original film, directed by Josh Safdie of “Uncut Gems” fame.\n\t\n\n\t“Song Sung Blue” didn’t report Wednesday previews. The film is projected to earn $10 million to $14 million from 2,400 theaters in its first weekend of release. Brewer directed the $30 million-budgeted movie, featuring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson in the true story of two down-on-their luck musicians who form a Neil Diamond tribute band.\n\n\tMeanwhile Disney’s animated juggernaut “Zootopia 2” outpaced the other newcomers in second place on Wednesday charts with $3.2 million from 3,540 cinemas. Since its debut around Thanksgiving, the PG film has generated $296 million domestically and $1.3 billion globally, making “Zootopia 2” the highest-grossing Hollywood release of the year.\n",

Director Josh Safdie and casting director Jennifer Venditti assembled an absolute banger of a team, from star Timothée Chalamet to Gwyneth Paltrow returning to the screen after several years to unexpected cameos from playwright David Mamet, director Abel Ferrera and many moe..\n\n\tMany of the smaller roles have deep ties to the New York indie filmmaking community or to the world of table tennis, adding to the texture of the sprawling sports saga. The featured co-stars are also revelations, from Kevin O’Leary – “Shark Tank’s” Mr. Wonderful — making his film debut to Odessa A’zion, most recently seen as a headstrong social media influencer on “I Love L.A,” playing a totally different persona.\n\n\tHere’s a guide to the stars and cameos in Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTimothée Chalamet as Marty Mauser\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tTimothée Chalamet might not seem like the obvious choice for an exhilarating sports movie, and yet with Marty Mauser, he throws himself into a role that never stops surprising for all two hours-plus. Chalamet reportedly has been practicing table tennis for six years getting ready to play Mauser, a ping pong champion, hustler and showman loosely based on 1950s sensation Marty Reisman. Chalamet’s beguiling rogue character blends comedy, action and romance in a role totally distinct from Bob Dylan in “A Complete Unknown” or Willy Wonka, just to name a few. He’s been nominated for two Oscars and has been nominated for a Golden Globe for actor in a comedy movie for “Marty Supreme,” so the only question now is how far can he go?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGwyneth Paltrow as Kay Stone\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tGwyneth Paltrow plays Kay Stone, a faded but still glamorous movie star of the 1930s in “Marty Supreme,” and despite a notable age difference, Chalamet’s Marty finds seducing her to be his ultimate achievement. Stone is starring in a play financed by her coarse husband (played by Kevin O’Leary) and finds the over-confident Marty to be an intriguing diversion as he woos her from London to New York. Paltrow convincingly jumps into the erotically charged pairing, marking a welcome return to the screen for the Oscar-winning actress who has been focusing more on her entrepreneurial activities of late.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOdessa A’zion as Rachel Mizler\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tShe’s been making waves in the love-it-or-hate-it HBO series “I Love L.A.” this year, but in “Marty Supreme,” Odessa A’zion takes on a totally different role as a spirited young woman on the Lower East Side in 1950s New York. Rachel Mizler grew up with Marty Mauser but somehow got saddled with an abusive brute of a husband and a job in a pet shop. She finds solace with the unreliable but much more charming Marty, and ends up becoming his accomplice in a dangerous caper to retrieve a dog from an enraged farmer. A’zion has starred in movies like “Hellraiser” since starting out in her mother Pamela Adlon’s series “Better Things.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKevin O’Leary as Milton Rockwell\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tKevin O’Leary is best known as “Mr. Wonderful,” a successful Canadian entrepreneur who has been a regular on the long-running reality series “Shark Tank” since 2009. In “Marty Supreme,” O’Leary makes his acting debut playing Milton Rockwell, the manipulative businessman husband of Kay Stone, who first charms Marty with his interest in Marty’s table tennis career before turning on him in the most evil ways. “Marty Supreme” marked a reunion for O’Leary and Paltrow, who has appeared on “Shark Tank.” \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFran Drescher as Rebecca Mauser\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe former “Nanny” star and SAG-AFTRA president plays Marty Mauser’s long-suffering mother Rebecca, who would prefer Marty work at his uncle’s boring but dependable shoe store instead of trying his luck at table tennis. Drescher got her start in features including “Saturday Night Fever” and “This Is Spinal Tap” before starting her long TV career. As a native of Queens, she brings an authentic New York flavor to the role of the beleaguered mom who doesn’t quite get her ambitious and conniving son.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTyler, the Creator as Wally\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tTyler, the Creator is known for his music career and long list of music videos, and the hip-hop artist has appeared in TV shows including “The Mindy Project” and provided voices for “Big Mouth” and other animated projects. “Marty Supreme” is his first major film role, and he plays Marty’s loyal friend Wally, a taxi driver who gets caught up in Marty’s wild scheme to hustle local ping pong players and earn a few extra bucks to finance an expensive trip to an overseas tournament.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKoto Kawaguchi as Koto Endo\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJapanese table tennis champion Koto Kawaguchi makes his movie debut in “Marty Supreme” as Marty Mauser’s formidable opponent Koto Endo. In real life, Kawaguchi has won titles in several deaf ping pong championships. The character of Endo is based on Hiroji Satoh, a Gold Medalist in the 1950s who competed against Marty Reisman and was the first player to use sponge-coated paddles. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAbel Ferrara as Ezra Mishkin\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tVeteran New York indie filmmaker and sometimes-actor Abel Ferrara plays Ezra Mishkin, a violent and vindictive criminal with an overzealous affection for his mangy dog, who tangles with Marty when his pup goes missing. Ferrara helmed gritty, atmospheric crime dramas like “Bad Lieutenant” and “King of New York” that appear to be big influences on both Safdie brothers.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSandra Bernhard as Judy\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tComic actress Sandra Bernhard plays Judy, a yenta neighbor of the Mauser family. The Michigan native is a longtime New Yorker, and with formative roles like Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy,” she cemented her place in Gotham’s film and theater worlds. The famously outspoken actress went on to appear on “Roseanne” and recently made appearances on “Severance” and “Percy Jackson and the Olympians.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDavid Mamet as Glen Nordmann\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of MasterClass\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tBefore he was a well-known playwright, screenwriter and director, David Mamet was a ping pong hustler. No, seriously. In college, Mamet and his friend, comedian and table tennis champ Jonathan Katz, hustled onlookers by letting Mamet, the lesser player, win games for money. Later on, Mamet became a habitué of the upper West Side table tennis gym owned by Marty Reisman, the ping pong legend whose life inspired “Marty Supreme.” Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick were among the parlor’s other famous patrons. In “Marty Supreme,” Mamet plays Glen Nordmann, director of the play that Gwyneth Paltrow’s faded star Kay Stone is starring in.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tIsaac Mizrahi as Merle\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFashion designer Isaac Mizrahi normally plays himself in his onscreen appearances, in shows such as “Sex and the City” and “Gossip Girl.” In “Marty Supreme,” he takes on one of his few fictional roles as Merle, a cheeky press agent for retired movie star Kay Stone who gets to deliver a memorable line. Mizrahi, an old family friend of the Safdies, had hired Josh and Benny Safdie to do a campaign for Liz Claiborne back in 2009, so he goes way back with the brothers.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPenn Jillette, Larry Sloman, John Catsimatidis, Philippe Petit and More\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tDirector Josh Safdie packed the cast of “Marty Supreme” with a bevy of intriguing cameos from colorful character actors and non-professionals alike. \n\n\nMagician Penn Jillette has a small but unforgettable scene as Hoff, a grizzled hoarder with an itchy trigger finger.\nMusic writer and NY fixture Larry “Ratso” Sloman plays Marty’s uncle and employer Murray Mauser, who finds Marty to be a disappointment as a shoe store clerk.\n French highwire artist Philippe Petit makes an appearance as an MC at a Brussels ping pong match.\nGrocery store magnate and talkshow host John Catsimatidis plays Christopher Galanis, father to Marty’s friend. \nBasketball star George “The Iceman” Gervin shows up as Lawrence, the owner of the ping pong parlor.

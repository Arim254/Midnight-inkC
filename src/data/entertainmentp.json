    "body": "\n\tSigourney Weaver is in talks to join the upcoming Amazon series adaptation of “Tomb Raider,” Variety has confirmed. \n\n\tWhile no deal is closed, Weaver would star alongside previously announced lead Sophie Turner should she ultimately join the series. Character details are being kept under wraps. \n\n\tReps for Amazon declined to comment.\n\n\n\tThis would be the latest major genre fare for Weaver. She is of course best known for starring in the “Alien” film franchise in the iconic role of Ellen Ripley. Weaver is also a key part of the “Avatar” films, with “Avatar: Fire and Ash” hitting theaters on Dec. 19. She has also appeared in the Marvel universe in the Netflix series “The Defenders,” and will be seen in the “Star Wars” film “The Mandalorian and Grogu” in 2026. \n\t\n\n\tWeaver is a three-time Oscar nominee — twice in the best actress category for “Aliens” and “Gorillas in the Mist” and once for best supporting actress in “Working Girl.” She has taken on few regular TV roles in her career, save for shows like “Political Animals” and “The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart,” the latter of which was also an Amazon show. \n\n\tShe is repped by UTA and Jackoway Austen Tyerman. \n\n\t“Tomb Raider,” based on the video game franchise of the same name, was originally greenlit at Prime Video in May 2024, with Turner set to play Lara Croft. \n\n\tPhoebe Waller-Bridge will serve as creator, writer, and executive producer on the series. Chad Hodge will serve as executive producer and co-showrunner alongside Waller-Bridge. Jonathan van Tulleken will serve as director and executive producer.\n\t\n\n\tThe series is executive produced by: Crystal Dynamics; Waller-Bridge and Jenny Robins via Wells Street Productions; Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson of Story Kitchen; Michael Scheel; Hodge; van Tulleken; and Legendary Television. The series is produced by Story Kitchen, Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios. Waller-Bridge is currently under an overall deal at Amazon MGM Studios.\n\n\tThe “Tomb Raider” series was developed under a pact between Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios which comes via Story Kitchen’s first-look deal with the studio to develop additional “Tomb Raider” stories into series and films.\n\n\tDeadline first reported Weaver being in talks for “Tomb Raider.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tSaudi director Hamzah Jamjoom (“Rupture”) has teamed up with Detroit-based Exxodus Pictures and American comic book artist Darick Robertson (“The Boys”) on a live-action series based on a graphic novels franchise titled “Crestar and the Knight Stallion,” featuring an Arab and South Asian superhero duo.\n\n\tThe project, which is being shopped at Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea Film Festival market in Jeddah, brings together top talent from Hollywood and the Middle East.\n\t\n\n\tRobertson, who co-created the comic book series “The Boys” which inspired the hit Prime Video show as well as “Gen V” and the upcoming “Vought Rising,” has written the second instalment in the graphic novel franchise titled “Crestar and the Knight Stallion: Devil’s Night” with a third one currently in development.\n\n\n\tThe popular graphic novel series, which has strong comedy elements, is created by Iraqi-American stand-up comedian Abdallah Jasim and Pakistani-American filmmaker Ajmal Zaheer Ahmad. An Arabic translation of the graphic novels is scheduled for release in 2026.\n\n\tThe “Crestar and the Knight Stallion” series is set in a Detroit on the brink of collapse and centers around a hardened vigilante named Crestar and a super-human young Arab-American man named Ali. As Crestar molds Ali into the Knight Stallion, an evil force called Devil’s Knight rises “with a plan to plunge the city into permanent darkness using an ancient, limitless energy source tied to Ali’s own abilities,” says the synopsis.\n\n\t“With Detroit’s fate hanging by a thread, Crestar and the Knight Stallion — backed by billionaire Chris Regle and the AI-driven supercar, the Firebreather — must unite to stop the coming reign of chaos,” it adds. “In an explosive battle where myth collides with science, mentor and protégé become the city’s last hope against an enemy determined to turn every night into Devil’s Night.”\n\t\n\n\tProduction on the live-action series is being spearheaded by Detroit-based Exxodus Pictures, which is headed by Zaheer Ahmad. He is in discussions to also star as Crestar and will be sharing directing duties with Jamjoom. Exxodus Pictures has teamed on this project with Jamjoom’s Saudi-American outfit called Plot Point 1.\n\n\tMichigan-born Jasim, who has a large following on social media under his stage name Abid Jay, is in discussions to star as “the hilarious and heroic Knight Stallion,” the statement said.\n\n\tThe plan is to shoot the series in both the U.S. and the Middle East.\n\n\t“The entertainment landscape is changing. For many years I’ve believed that the West is moving East, and the East is moving West… and the point where these worlds converge will be in the Middle East,” said Zaheer Ahmad in the statement.\n\n\t “The line where they intersect, however, is very fine,” he added. “The few filmmakers, storytellers, and creators who know how to ride this razor-thin edge will turn it into a bridge. Those who understand Western style, sensibilities, and storytelling — as well as Eastern culture, history, and values — will shape the next century of film, media, and influence.”\n\n\t“With ‘Crestar and the Knight Stallion’ we have positioned ourselves to ride this cutting-edge and are excited to be part of the future it leads to,” Zaheer Ahmad concluded.\n",

    "body": "\n\tContent from BravoCon, the three-day fan convention in Las Vegas centered around Bravo reality TV stars, was streamed by 3 million Peacock accounts TKTKTK. That’s an increase of more than 400% from the event’s Peacock viewership in 2023, which was the last time BravoCon took place.\n\n\tThese statistics were counted across all BravoCon panels, which were rolled out on Peacock the day after they took place in Las Vegas, and other programming. In 2025, Peacock streamed 29 panels plus BravoCon Lives with Andy Cohen and the Bravoverse Live Stage. In addition to the 400% increase in accounts reached, usage — the total amount of time spent viewing the content across all accounts — doubled, though that’s unsurprising, as only nine panels were available on Peacock in 2023.\n\t\n\n\tBravoCon content also performed strongly on social media. Across NBCUniversal’s accounts on all major social platforms, BravoCon brought in more than 385 million engagements — a combination of views, likes, comments and shares — up 54% from 2023. TikTok alone accounted for 224 million of those engagements, almost twice as many as it did in 2023. The top performing videos were a series announcements and teasers for “The Real Housewives of Rhode Island” and “The Valley: Persian Style” as well as Vicki Gulvalson’s return to “The Real Housewives of Orange County.”\n\n\n\tIn total, BravoCon content was viewed for 240 million minutes across platforms, including Bravo, Peacock, Facebook, Instagram, X, TikTok, YouTube, Access Hollywood, NBC News’ “Today,” Peacock and E! News. Engagements across all platforms totaled 419 million, a 43% increase from 2023.\n\t\n\n\tSee highlights from Variety‘s coverage of BravoCon here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s “Stranger Things” season at Netflix. Last week, the first four episodes of the sci-fi show’s fifth and final season debuted with 59.6 million views in their first five days of streaming last week. Though viewership decreased to 23.6 million views, it Season 5 remained the most-watched TV title of the week for Dec. 1-7. Additionally, all four previous seasons made the Netflix Top 10 for the third week in a row, with their combined total hitting 26.2 million views — up one million from the week before, indicating that Season 5 is effectively bringing return fans and newcomers to the franchise as a whole.\n\t\n\n\tThe second-most-watched title on Netflix during the week of Dec. 1-7 was “Sean Combs: The Reckoning,” which debuted with 21.8 million views in six days. The docuseries has been a major generator of conversation, with Netflix announcing its premiere date just a week before its release and Sean “Diddy” Combs issuing a cease-and-desist letter alleging that Netflix and executive producer Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson used stolen footage. (Netflix and the filmmakers have denied this claim.)\n\n\n\tChristmas movies have begun their takeover of the Netflix Top 10; the most-watched movie Dec. 1-7 was “My Secret Santa,” which debuted with 18.1 million views, followed by “Jingle Bell Heist” with 10.4 million views in its second week. \n\n\tWith “Stranger Things” taking up five spots — Season 1 at No. 2, Season 2 at No. 5, Season 3 at No. 6 and Season 4 at No. 7 — there were only five remaining spots on the English-language TV chart. Besides the Diddy docuseries, those went to Season 1 of “The Abandons” (No. 4), “The Rats: A Witcher Tale” (No. 8), “The Beast in Me” (No. 9) and “Matt Rife: Unwrapped — A Christmas Crowd Work Special.” \n\t\n\n\tMore to come…\n",

    "body": "\n\tZootopia’s biggest pop star, Gazelle, is back!\n\n\tWhen “Zootopia 2” directors Jared Bush and Byron Howard were working on the sequel to “Zootopia,” they knew they wanted another Gazelle song. \n\n\tShakira, who voices the character and wrote “Try Everything” for the first film, returns with a new anthem, aptly titled “Zoo,” to accompany the character. “Try Everything” followed the original movie’s theme of optimism and spirit. This time, “Zoo” serves as a celebration.\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety about the songwriting process, Shakira says, “We wanted it to have that universal message. These are hectic times, and it’s about stopping and taking a moment to lean on each other and enjoy the moment.” Written with Ed Sheeran and Blake Slatkin, the song incorporates sounds from around the world while drawing inspiration from Latin pop. Its lyrics are designed to be an earworm: “Come on, get on up. We’re wild and we can’t be tamed. And we’re turnin’ the floor into a zoo, ooh, ooh.”\n\n\n\t“Zootopia 2,” now in theaters, sees the return of rookie cops Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman). The duo comes face-to-face with a mysterious pit viper, Gary De’Snake (voiced by Ke Huy Quan). As they try to solve the mystery of Gary, they’re led on an investigation to uncover a hidden reptile population. During a gala event, Gazelle takes to the stage with her troupe of tiger backup dancers and belts out “Zoo.” The celebration ends abruptly when Gary is spotted, causing chaos among the animals of Zootopia.\n\n\t“Zoo” was written and recorded while Shakira was on tour. In collaborating with Sheeran and Slatkin, she explains that they wanted to ensure the song remained truthful to the film. “Every detail of the song, the writing, the production, the lyrics, and the arrangement, was crafted consciously and carefully,” she says. She adds, “When I’m writing for ‘Zootopia,’ I try to channel Gazelle and think about the message that lives within the movie, and what the song should represent in the film.”\n\t\n\n\tBush recalls hearing the song for the first time. “Sometimes you hear music and say, ‘I’m not sure if it’s that one.’ This came in, and there was no question. Immediately, you hear it, and you’re like, ‘This is amazing.’”\n\n\tWith “Zootopia 2” focusing on themes of prejudice and fighting for one’s beliefs, Shakira says the film and song are timeless. “The morals in this film are timeless, too, and I hope that the song reflects that.” She adds, “As an ambassador of my own culture, I felt that this song was a reflection of that too.”\n\n\tWatch the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNeon, the studio behind best picture Oscar winner “Anora,” and UFO, a nonprofit organization that supports filmmakers, have selected Diana Peralta as the next participant in their residency program that supports artists making their sophomore features. \n\n\tThe UFO x Neon residency is designed for filmmakers developing their second narrative feature, specifically targeting those who, in two or more years since the release of a promising independent feature debut, have not yet directed a second feature. The filmmaker completes the in-person residency with a script ready for the next stage of development and financing.\n\t\n\n\tChanning Godfrey Peoples, who garnered widespread acclaim for her 2020 debut, “Miss Juneteenth,” was the first filmmaker selected for the residency.\n\n\n\tPeralta’s debut feature film, “De Lo Mio,” made its world premiere at BAMcinemaFest in 2019 and won the best narrative feature prize at IndieMemphis Film Festival. The film was distributed by HBO. \n\n\tPeralta, a Dominican-American writer, director and creative producer from New York City, is currently in development on her second feature, “No Love Lost,” which is described as a psychological thriller “about sisterhood, the thin line between love and control, and how far we’ll go to protect our own.”\n\n\tAn early synopsis of the film reads: “In the thick of summer on a secluded flower farm, the Youngblood sisters’ lives are upended when their estranged youngest sister, Daisy, returns home with her new husband, Leo. Her arrival breathes life and chaos back into the house, reigniting sibling bonds and old rivalries. Soon, strange and violent events begin to plague the farm, and the sisters fear someone — or something — is out to drive them from their land. As their paranoia escalates, loyalties fracture and long-buried family secrets come to light.”\n\t\n\n\t“No Love Lost” has been supported by the Sundance Feature Film Labs (Peralta is a 2024 Sundance Screenwriters and Directors Lab fellow), the Gotham Film & Media Institute and the Saul Zaentz Innovation Fund. The film team includes producer Alexandra Byer (“Familiar Touch”) and casting director Kim Coleman (“BlacKkKlansman,” “Lovecraft Country”). \n",

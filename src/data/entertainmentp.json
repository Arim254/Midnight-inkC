    "body": "\n\tThe U.K.’s Sheffield Theatres has unveiled the ensemble cast for the premiere of “The Ladies Football Club,” written by Tony Award winner Stefano Massini and adapted by Tim Firth. \n\n\tThe production marks a reunion of heavyweight theatrical talent, with Massini bringing his storytelling prowess from “The Lehman Trilogy” and Firth applying his craft honed on the global hit “Calendar Girls.” Sheffield Theatres artistic director Elizabeth Newman will helm the production, with Frantic Assembly’s Scott Graham choreographing movement.\n\t\n\n\tThe cast features Jessica Baglow (“Gentleman Jack”) as Rosalyn, Leah Brotherhead (“Hullraisers”) as Hayley, Lesley Hart (“Shetland”) as Berenice, and Bettrys Jones (“The Buddha of Suburbia”) as Olivia. Ellie Leach (“Coronation Street”) will play Brianna, with Clair Norris (“EastEnders”) as Melanie, Anne Odeke (“Princess Essex”) as Justine, and Krupa Pattani (“Mr Bates vs The Post Office”) as Cheryl.\n\n\n\tRounding out the ensemble are Cara Theobold (“Downton Abbey”) as Violet, Chanel Waddock (“Othello”) as Penelope, and Charley Webb (“Emmerdale”) as Abigail. Joy Adeogun (“Romeo and Juliet”) and Jamie Randall (“The House Party”) will serve as swings.\n\n\tSet during WWI, the play chronicles Sheffield factory workers who form a women’s soccer team during lunch breaks while men fight overseas. The story traces their rise to playing before crowds exceeding 50,000 spectators, before facing forces that would ultimately shut down their burgeoning sport.\n\n\t“The cast and creatives coming together for ‘The Ladies Football Club’ bring extraordinary imagination, rigor, and heart to a story that demands to be seen and heard now,” Newman said. “It honors the courage and collective spirit at the root of the history of women’s football [soccer], while pushing boldly into the present.”\n\t\n\n\tMassini added: “This is what my play is about: a moment in time when a group of women, while their husbands were away fighting at the front, took the ball and made women’s football history.”\n\n\tFirth described the adaptation challenge as creating “a play that was a football match: told as much in movement as in words by eleven players who never leave the field, who support each other, fight each other and discover a passion for something forbidden.”\n\n\tThe creative team includes designer Grace Smart, lighting designer Ben Jacobs, sound designer Ella Wahlström, video designer Joe Ransom, and composers Wahlström, Firth and Steve Parry. Juliet Horsley serves as casting director.\n\n\tThe production runs at the Crucible Theatre from Feb. 28 through March 28.\n\n\tSheffield Theatres has produced multiple award-winning productions that transferred to the West End and internationally, including “Life of Pi,” “Everybody’s Talking About Jamie,” and “Standing at the Sky’s Edge.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAriana Grande and Jonathan Bailey seemingly just confirmed that they’re working on a revival of Stephen Sondheim’s beloved musical “Sunday in the Park With George.”\n\n\tThe “Wicked” co-stars took to Instagram on Wednesday morning to jointly post a cryptic photo of them sitting in front of Georges Seurat’s famous painting, “A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,” which the show was inspired by. “All it has to be is good,” Bailey wrote in the post’s caption, referencing the lyrics to the musical’s title song. \n\t\n\n\n\tLast month, Deadline reported that Grande and Bailey were eyeing a revival of “Sunday in the Park With George,” the last major production of which was in 2017 on Broadway with Jake Gyllenhaal and Annaleigh Ashford. The Tony- and Pulitzer Prize-winning musical first opened in 1984 and centers around George, a fictionalized version of Seurat immersed in painting his masterpiece with help from his muse Dot, as well as his great-grandson (also named George), a contemporary artist. \n\n\n\tAccording to Deadline, the revival is set to open in 2027 at London’s Barbican Theatre, but no official announcement has been made yet. The Barbican did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.\n\n\tGrande and Bailey recently shared the big screen in Jon M. Chu’s two “Wicked” movies as Glinda and Fiyero, respectively. In a recent interview with Variety, Grande teased that she had a very exciting announcement coming soon. Could this be it?\n\n\t“I can’t say much yet, but it’s something that inspires me deeply. It contains multitudes,” Grande said. “I promise I’ll DM you the day it’s announced.”\n",

But the ceremony also competed directly with NBC’s telecast of the NFL wild card game that saw the New England Patriots beat the Los Angeles Chargers to secure a playoff berth.\n\t\n\n\tNikki Glaser hosted the Globes for the second year in a row and was once again positively received. Variety critic Alison Herman wrote that “Glaser continued to confidently strut the thin and delicate line between landing punches while seeming infectiously excited to be in the Beverly Hilton ballroom,” and producers of the ceremony told Variety they “certainly hope” she’ll return as host again next year. \n\n\tGlaser’s opening monologue generated 14 million views across social media platforms after 36 hours. On the Golden Globes’ YouTube page as of Tuesday evening the 11-minute monologue was up to 3.7 million views. CBS said the ceremony delivered the most “social interactions” in Globes history with some 42 million interactions on Sunday night.\n\n\tGlenn Weiss and Ricky Kirshner of White Cherry Entertainment served as showrunners and executive producers of the Golden Globes. The ceremony was produced by Dick Clark Productions, which is owned by Variety parent company PMC in a joint venture with Eldridge.\n\t\n\n\tThe Globes also aired in 165 international territories.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tLionsgate has sold its South Asian and Southeast Asian streaming operation Lionsgate Play to Rohit Jain, the executive who developed the service during an eight-year tenure as president of Lionsgate Play Asia.\n\n\tThe studio disclosed the deal Tuesday. Jain will leave Lionsgate to take ownership of the streaming platform, while the studio retains its theatrical distribution and television production operations across the two regions.\n\n\n\tJain has secured a multi-year licensing deal that grants him rights to use the Lionsgate Play branding and draw from the studio’s content catalog for the streaming service.\n\t\n\n\tLionsgate Play maintains active operations in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, and the Maldives. The service primarily utilizes a B2B2C distribution model through long-term partnerships with telecommunications providers. In India, the platform is integrated into various aggregators such as JioHotstar, Airtel Xstream, and Amazon Prime Video Channels. For 2026, the company is executing a content slate that includes 100 planned premieres for the year, with a specific focus on expanding its regional Indian library with 25 new titles across the Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada languages. \n\n\t“We thank Rohit for his outstanding leadership in building and scaling Lionsgate’s business in India over the past eight years,” said Lionsgate COO Brian Goldsmith. “Under his stewardship, the Lionsgate brand has gained greater resonance with audiences in South Asia and Southeast Asia, and Lionsgate Play has emerged as a distinctive premium streaming platform in one of the world’s fastest-growing digital entertainment markets. Rohit is an entrepreneur with a deep understanding of the Asia landscape, and he has the expertise and experience to lead Lionsgate Play into an exciting new phase of growth.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’m deeply grateful to Jon Feltheimer and Brian Goldsmith for the trust and freedom to build Lionsgate’s India business and transform Lionsgate Play into a premium streaming platform across Asia,” said Rohit Jain. “Lionsgate Play has established itself as a leading destination for Hollywood content in India and is now positioned to expand well beyond that – shaping a differentiated, future-ready streaming platform for the region.”\n\n\tFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThomas Dewitt Causey, Jr., a veteran production sound mixer who worked on films like “Dick Tracy” and “Broadcast News,” died on Sunday in Cathedral City, Calif., after a battle with a long illness. He was 76.\n\n\tHis death was confirmed by his daughter-in-law, Crystal Causey.\n\n\tCausey worked as a sound mixer on over 85 films throughout his four decades in Hollywood. He was nominated for an Oscar for his work on Warren Beatty’s 1990 film “Dick Tracy.” His other major credits included “Gardens of Stone,” “The Fisher King,” “Bulworth” and “Defending Your Life.” He was also a frequent collaborator of horror icon John Carpenter. They made 11 films together, including all three “Halloween” films, “Escape from New York,” “Escape from L.A.” “The Thing,” “Big Trouble in Little China,” “Christine,” “Starman,” “Prince of Darkness” and “Village of the Damned.”\n\t\n\n\tBorn in New Orleans in 1949, Causey fell in love with the business while working as a driver for the sound team of a British production that was shooting in Louisiana. That experience pushed him to purchase his first sound equipment with a $5,000 loan from his father, and he worked on local film shoots and recorded live albums for local jazz musicians. In 1977, he moved to L.A. with his wife to pursue a career in sound mixing. The move was spurred by a court ruling that opened up IATSE membership for any non-union sound mixer who worked at least 90 days on L.A. sets in the last year.\n\n\n\tCausey is survived by his wife, Christina Causey, his son, Jesse Causey, and his brother, Matthew Causey.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBare Knuckle Fighting Championship and Bare Knuckle Fight League are making their official entry into India, marking a significant expansion into one of the world’s largest combat sports markets.\n\n\tThe move is being spearheaded by World League of Fighters, BKFC’s license holder, which is co-founded by Rajesh Banga, Sunil Mathew and Siraj Gill. The organization has brought in prominent film producer Parag Sanghvi and Bollywood star and martial artist Tiger Shroff to join the board alongside BKFC founder and president David Feldman and former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor, who became a part-owner of BFKC in 2024. \n\t\n\n\tWLF previously delivered a sold-out BKFC event in Dubai last year, which the organization describes as the biggest bare-knuckle fighting event held in the Middle East.\n\n\n\tThe India expansion will introduce a team-based bare-knuckle league format – marking the first time such a structure has been implemented in the history of the sport. The format will feature six inaugural teams: Crushers, Punishers, Warriors, Phantoms, Gladiators and Infernos, transforming individual fights into a franchise-based competition.\n\n\tRahul Saxena has been appointed CEO to lead the platform. He brings experience in scaling global brands to the role.\n\n\t“India is not just a market – it is the future of global combat sports,” Banga, Mathew and Gill said in a joint statement. “Together with BKFC, BKFL and WLF, we are building an ecosystem that will develop Indian fighters, create global stars and deliver world-class fight entertainment to millions of fans.”\n\t\n\n\tSanghvi positioned the venture as an opportunity to build a sports intellectual property from India with global reach. “This is where world-class storytelling meets raw, uncompromising sport,” he said. “With WLF, BKFC and Conor McGregor, we are not just launching a league – we are architecting a global sports IP from India that will command attention, talent and fandom worldwide.”\n\n\tFeldman emphasized India’s longstanding position in the organization’s expansion strategy. “India has been on our roadmap for a long time,” he said. “The scale, the energy, the culture — there is no place like it. With the leadership team we have assembled and our partnership with WLF, we are bringing the purest form of combat sports to a nation ready for it.”\n\n\tMcGregor, who serves as a global partner for BKFC, framed the expansion as transformative. “India has warriors in its DNA,” he said. “What we’re building with BKFC and BKFL in India will be something the world has never seen before. This is not just expansion – this is a revolution.”\n\n\tShroff, joining McGregor as a board member, highlighted the cultural significance of the venture. “Honored to stand alongside Conor McGregor as we create something truly historic for Indian sport,” he said. “This is more than a fight – it’s a global movement, and history is being written. Just like cinema, sport is a celebration of talent and skill, and Parag [Sanghvi] and I are committed to turning this into a landmark moment for India.”\n\n\tThe first official BKFC and BKFL team-based events are scheduled for 2026, with venue and fight card details to be announced.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

    "body": "\n\tTony Dokoupil, newly installed anchor of “CBS Evening News,” landed an interview with President Donald Trump — and the news program aired Trump’s comments uninterrupted for almost half the broadcast.\n\n\tDokoupil interviewed Trump Tuesday on the floor of a Ford Motor Co. factory in Dearborn, Michigan, and the segment aired on the “CBS Evening News.” CBS News aired the interview with Trump for roughly the first 14 minutes of the evening newscast, without commercial breaks or apparent edits. \n\t\n\n\tTopics covered in Dokoupil’s interview with Trump spanned the U.S. economy; the killing of a Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent; Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell — who is the target of a Justice Department investigation into whether he lied to Congress over the scope of the Fed’s headquarters renovation; and the ongoing protests in Iran and the Iranian government’s killing of protestors.\n\n\n\tAbout the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minnesota by an ICE agent, Trump said that “her actions were pretty tough” and said, referring to videos of the incident, “when you look at that tape, it can be viewed two ways… There are a couple versions of that tape that are very, very bad.”\n\n\tTrump asserted that “We have the strongest economy maybe in the history of the country” and said his focus is on the U.S. economy. At the same time, Trump said, he is also working to address foreign threats. “We’ve had a big victory with Venezuela,” Trump said. \n\n\tIf Kamala Harris had won the 2024 presidential election, Trump told Dokoupil, “You probably wouldn’t have a job right now.” Dokoupil later in the interview, countered, “For the record, I do think I’d have this job even if the other guys won” to which Trump replied, “Yeah, but at a lesser salary.” Trump repeated his oft-made claim that “We now have the hottest country in the world” whereas a year and a half ago it was “dead.”\n\t\n\n\tAbout Powell, Trump said, “He’s been a lousy Fed chairman,” and reiterated his longstanding criticism that Powell has been “too high on interest rates.” Trump alleged the Federal Reserve HQ construction project has encountered billions of dollars in overruns and said about Powell, “He’s either corrupt or incompetent.”\n\n\tDokoupil cited Trump’s recent comment in a New York Times interview that only his “own morality” limited his power as commander in chief in international affairs, and he asked the president whether there’s anything that limits his power in the U.S. “I’m a moral person. I don’t like seeing death,” Trump said. “So yeah, it’s limited by my morality and I have a very high grade of morality, so therefore it’s limited.” Dokoupil responded, “Not the Constitution, not the courts? That’s what I thought you were going to say.” Trump said, “Well, the Constitution and courts, of course. That goes without saying.”\n\n\tOn Tuesday, Dokoupil anchored “CBS Evening News” live from Detroit at GM’s new global headquarters, as part of his multicity “Live From America” tour. The back half of the telecast featured an Dokoupil’s interview with GM CEO Mary Barra, who said Trump’s tariffs resulted in “a few billion” dollars in additional costs to the company in 2025.\n\n\tDokoupil, a veteran of CBS News’ morning show, was appointed anchor of “CBS Evening News” by Bari Weiss, the founder of The Free Press who is now overseeing the TV news division. Paramount Skydance chairman and CEO David Ellison bought her company in October, at which point he named Weiss editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n\n\tHe was supposed to start his “CBS Evening News” hosting duties Jan. 5 but took to the air two days sooner than planned: On Saturday, Jan. 3, he had an extended three-part interview with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth following the Trump administration’s invasion of Venezuela to apprehend former president Nicolás Maduro.\n\n\tFrom Jan. 5-9, overall viewership of “CBS Evening News” with Dokoupil was down 23% compared with same period for the newscast a year ago.\n\n\tAhead of his “CBS Evening News” debut, Dokoupil — parroting points that Weiss has made — said that “People do not trust us like they used to” and that mainstream news outlets have placed “too much weight in the analysis of academics, or elites, and not enough on you.” The show also outlined five principles ahead of his first broadcast, including: “We love America. And we make no apologies for saying so.”\n\t\n\n\tIn some of Dokoupil’s “CBS Evening News” segments, critics have perceived a less-antagonistic stance toward the Trump administration compared with other traditional news networks. On a broadcast last week, in a teary-eyed report from Miami, Dokoupil said about Trump’s secretary of state, “Marco Rubio, we salute you. You’re the ultimate Florida man,” adding: “Whatever you think of [Rubio’s] politics, you’ve got to admit, it’s an impressive résumé.” Reporting from Minneapolis after the killing of Good, Dokoupil said that both pro- and anti-ICE beliefs were “deeply American sentiments” while he appealed to viewers to “find a way to live with people who are genuinely different from us.”\n\n\tThe new CBS News regime was skewered by Golden Globes host Nikki Glaser on Sunday’s broadcast of the awards show — on CBS. Glaser quipped that “the award for most editing goes to CBS News,” adding: “CBS News: America’s newest place to see B.S. news.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe British Academy has announced the nominees for its 2026 Rising Star award for up-and-coming talent on the big screen, once again selecting a mix of Brits and Americans. \n\n\tThe winner will be announced during the BAFTA Film Awards ceremony and is the only honor to be voted on by the public.\n\n\tThis year’s five-strong lineup includes Chase Infiniti (“One Battle After Another”) and Miles Caton (“Sinners”), who have already amassed multiple awards nominations and wins for their breakout roles. On home soil, Archie Madekwe (“Lurker”), Robert Aramayo (“I Swear”) and Posy Sterling (“Lollipop”) make the list. \n\t\n\n\tAwards pundits may note that Infiniti and Aramayo are the only names also longlisted by BAFTA in lead performance categories. Aramayo — recognizable on the small screen for his major role in Amazon’s “The Rings of Power” — also won best leading actor at the British Independent Film Awards in December, where Sterling claimed the breakthrough performance honor. And while Infiniti and Caton may be the buzziest names on the list to most in awards season, it should also be noted that, since launching in 2005 (when James McAvoy took home the inaugural statuette), the Rising Star Award has only left the U.K. three times, and has been won by a British actor every year since 2010.\n\n\n\tPrevious winners of the award includes a heady mix of some of the brightest lights working today, featuring names such as Tom Holland, Daniel Kaluuya, Emma Mackey, Will Poulter and Kristen Stewart (the last American to win the honor, back in 2009). Jack O’Connell, who won the award in 2014, is currently lapping up critical praise for his wild turn in “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” and starred alongside Caton in “Sinners,” while Mia McKenna-Bruce, who won in 2024, leads murder mystery series “Agatha Christie’s Seven Dials,” launching on Netflix tomorrow. David Jonsson, who won last year, recently appeared in and produced Cal McMau’s prison thriller “Wasteman” — which is BAFTA-longlisted for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer — and also landed acclaim for “The Long Walk.”\n\t\n\n\tThere’s also the previous nominees that didn’t claim the prize, a lineup that includes the likes of Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt (both in 2006), Michael Fassbender (2008), Nicholas Hoult (2009), Tom Hiddleston (2011), Lupita Nyong’o (2013), Margot Robbie (2014), Timotheé Chalamet (2017) and Jessie Buckley (2018). Chalamet and Buckley are very much expected to be vying for the top performance prizes at both the Oscars and BAFTAs this year.\n\n\tThe full lineup of BAFTA Film Award nominations will be announced Jan. 27, with all the winners to be unveiled at the ceremony on Feb. 22 at London’s Royal Festival Hall.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“24” star Kiefer Sutherland was arrested early Monday after an alleged physical altercation with a Hollywood ride-share driver, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\n\tAuthorities said that around 12:15 a.m., the LAPD responded to a call about an assault involving a rideshare driver near Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. Officers concluded that the suspect, identified as Sutherland, entered a rideshare vehicle, allegedly assaulted the driver and made criminal threats toward them. The victim sustained no injuries that required immediate medical attention. Sutherland was arrested for making criminal threats toward the victim, in violation of California Penal Code section 422. Detectives from the Hollywood Division are currently investigating the incident.\n\t\n\n\tSutherland’s reps did not immediately respond to Variety’s request for comment.\n\n\n\tSutherland was bailed out on a $50,000 bond late Monday morning. His initial court date is set for Feb. 2.\n\n\tSutherland, son of Shirley Douglas and the late actor Donald Sutherland, broke into Hollywood starring in Rob Reiner’s 1986 coming-of-age drama “Stand By Me,” and Joel Schumacher’s 1987 subversive teen horror “The Lost Boys.” Some of his other early works include “Crazy Moon,” “Bright Lights, Big City,” “Flashback,” “The Flatliners,” “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me” and “A Few Good Men.”\n\n\tSutherland is probably best known for playing counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer across eight seasons of the Fox thriller series “24.” It won 20 Emmys during its run, including two acting prizes for Sutherland. In 2012, the show was rebooted into 12 episode mini series, “24: Live Another Day.”\n\t\n\n\tHis recent credits include films like “Tinsel Town,” “Stone Cold Fox,” “Juror #2” and “They Cloned Tyrone.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney+ has signed a first-look deal out of the U.K. with Matriarch Productions, the company behind “Adolescence” and “A Thousand Blows” founded by award-winning acting and producing husband-and-wife duo Stephen Graham and Hannah Walters.\n\n\tThe two-year deal will span both original scripted and unscripted series and comes following the recent premiere of the second season of period boxing drama “A Thousand Blow” on Disney+. The Hulu Original series is produced by Matriarch, along with The Story Collective and Water & Power Productions.\n\t\n\n\t“We are beyond thrilled to be working with Disney+ and through this creative partnership will strive to produce inspiring, entertaining and thought-provoking storytelling,” said Graham and Walters.\n\n\n\tMatriarch, which only began operations in 2020, has already built up an incredible track record. It landed a BAFTA nomination in 2022 for one-shot kitchen thriller “Boiling Point,” followed this up with a “Boiling Point” spin-off series for the BBC in 2023 and produced the first season of the acclaimed “A Thousand Blows,” written by Steven Knight and launched in early 2025.\n\n\tThen came “Adolescence,” which took the one-shot concept from “Boiling Point” to new heights that continue to soar. The groundbreaking Netflix series — produced by Matriarch alongside Warp Films and based on a concept by Graham — became an instant cultural moment when it released in March 2025 and has dominated every awards season since. Among its haul of honors are eight Primetime Emmys, including outstanding limited or anthology series, while it recently emerging from the Golden Globes with four wins, including best limited series.\n\t\n\n\tAlongside its success on screen, Matriarch has continued to underline one of its key principles, pushing for greater diversity, inclusivity and opportunity — and to help support those who would otherwise struggle to get into the industry. \n\n\t“Stephen and Hannah have proven they know how to tell bold, impactful stories and our vision also aligns with them around providing a platform for underrepresented voices in the U.K.,” said Angela Jain, head of content, Disney+ EMEA. “Distinctive, local stories that entertain and resonate with audiences are what Disney+ are committed to championing, making Matriarch the perfect partners as we look to evolve our production slate in the U.K. This is a dream and we’re thrilled to continue working with them.”\n\n\tAdded Lee Mason, VP, Scripted, Disney+ EMEA: “Stephen Graham and Hannah Walters are storytellers with real purpose — creative, fearless, and deeply committed to discovering, nurturing, and championing new talent. I’m genuinely excited to keep working with them, and to support the kind of ambitious, distinctive work they want to put into the world with Disney+.”\n\n\tUpcoming Hulu Original series produced out of the U.K. for Disney+ includes the second season of the Emmy and BAFTA award-winning “Rivals”, anti-romantic comedy “Alice and Steve”, produced by Clerkenwell Films and starring Nicola Walker and Jemaine Clement, and premium reality format series “Jamie and Sophie: Raising Chelsea (w/t)”, “The Rooney’s” and “Blind Date.”\n",

Based on what was alleged, and all evidence gathered, including multiple witness statements, I found no corroborating evidence that Mr. Busfield engaged in inappropriate conduct or that he was ever alone with the twins on set.”\n      \n    \n          Timothy Busfield just surrendered to law enforcement in New Mexico after an arrest warrant was issued earlier this month and prosecutors charged him with child abuse and criminal sexual contact with a minor ... but he made it clear to TMZ -- he says he's innocent.\n      \n    \n          TMZ obtained video of Busfield at his lawyer's office in Albuquerque, shortly before turning himself in. He made it clear ... he will \"confront these lies,\" adding, \"I did not do anything to those little boys.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As we reported ... the award-winning film and TV actor and director was accused of sexually abusing two boys who were child actors on \"The Cleaning Lady\" while he was directing the show in 2022 in New Mexico. At the time, prosecutors say, the child actors were 7 and 8 at the times of the alleged contact, and their parents reported the alleged crimes to the Albuquerque police two years later, leading to a criminal investigation.\n      \n\n          Busfield's civil lawyer, Larry Stein, tells TMZ ... he believes there is a revenge factor at work. He points to the criminal complaint, which essentially says an actress on set claims that the mother of both boys told her she vowed to get revenge after her sons were cut from the final season of the show.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Stein says Warner Bros. initiated an independent investigation -- using an outside law firm -- and the investigator interviewed approximately a dozen people, and concluded the evidence did not support the allegations.\n      \n    \n          An arrest warrant was issued Friday, and, as we first reported, the U.S. Marshals Service got involved earlier this week, assisting New Mexico authorities in locating Timothy.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          NBC was set to air an episode of \"Law & Order: SVU\" this week that featured Timothy ... but it's been shelved.\n      \n    \n          Timothy is best known for his roles in \"The West Wing,\" \"Revenge of the Nerds,\" \"Thirtysomething,\" and \"Field of Dreams.\"\n      \n    \n          Warner Bros. Television said in a statement to TMZ ... \"The health and safety of our cast and crew is always our top priority, especially the safety of minors on our productions. We take all allegations of misconduct very seriously and have processes in place to promptly and thoroughly investigate and take appropriate action. We are aware of the current charges against Mr. Busfield and will continue to cooperate with law enforcement in a timely manner.\"\n      \n      ",

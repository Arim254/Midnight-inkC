    "body": "\n\tHong Kong romantic comedy “My Indian Boyfriend” is being remade for British audiences, with the production set in Leicester in the U.K.\n\n\tThe remake will be executive produced by Sri Kishore, who directed the original Hong Kong film, and U.K.-based Hong Kong creative Hiu Man Chan. Leicester filmmaker Vijay Chauhan will make his feature directorial debut with the project.\n\n\tThe announcement holds particular significance for the region, as the Hong Kong original opened the inaugural edition of Leicester’s Chinese film festival, Electric Shadows. The remake, which will carry the working subtitle “Golden Mile,” a reference to a section of the city’s Belgrave Road known for its South Asian jewelry shops, brings the project full circle as a local Leicester production.\n\t\n\n\t“My Indian Boyfriend” was marketed as Hong Kong’s first mainstream romantic drama centered on a South Asian male lead, offering a portrayal of interracial love. The original film, directed by Hong Kong-based Indian filmmaker Kishore, blends romance, drama and youth culture with social tensions surrounding migration, identity and family expectations in contemporary Hong Kong. It was a bilingual feature in the Cantonese and Hindi languages. \n\n\n\tKishore said: “Collaborating with Hiu Man Chan and debut director Vijay Chauhan, I am grateful for this opportunity to highlight a cross-cultural narrative that resonates deeply within the U.K. This inspiring story intertwines the rich traditions of Chinese and Indian heritages, aiming to foster unity and celebrate diversity. I look forward to seeing how it will entertain and enrich lives.”\n\t\n\n\tThe U.K. remake will adapt the film’s themes of love, identity and cultural negotiation to a British context, drawing on Leicester’s ethnically diverse population. The city provides a backdrop for exploring the meeting points and friction points between cultures.\n\n\t“I’m excited to bring a movie about different cultures to such a diverse city like Leicester,” Chauhan said. “I think Leicester deserves more recognition in this industry and I hope that we can achieve that with this film. As this is my feature film debut, I’m really looking forward to taking in the entire experience and learning as much as I can to better my career as a filmmaker.”\n\n\tChan, an academic in creative industries at De Montfort University in Leicester and founder of NGO U.K.-China Film Collab, emphasized the significance of anchoring a cross-continental remake in the East Midlands.\n\n\t“This project will show what Leicester is capable of,” Chan said. “We’re connecting contemporary Hong Kong cinema and British independent film in a way that places the East Midlands firmly on the global map. This will not just be a remake adaptation – but it’s also a statement about the region’s creativity, ambition, international links and imagination.”\n\n\tChan also serves as executive producer for a biopic feature on Nobel Prize winner Bertrand Russell and previously led U.K. distribution for Hong Kong box office hit “Four Trails” and World War II documentary “The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru.”\n\n\tThe production aims to work with local creatives, universities and community partners, generating opportunities for early-career filmmakers and expanding the region’s film footprint. \n",

    "body": "\n\tCanal+ Group, the listed pay-TV banner which owns “Paddington” producer/distributor Studiocanal,  hosted a splashy American-style upfront presentation coined The Original+ at the Olympia in Paris on Tuesday. \n\n\tHosted by actor-director Thomas Ngijol, the event brought together leading industry players, including Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos who took part in a cheeky – but friendly — fireside chat with Canal+ Group CEO Maxime Saada and vowed to keep Warner Bros. movies in theaters. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMaxime Saada, Ted Sarandos \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNicolas DEMARE\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Original+ kicked off with Studiocanal boss and Canal+ Group CCO Anna Marsh who unveiled two big English-language projects that reflect the banner’s production range: “Elsinore,” starring Andrew Scott and Olivia Colman, directed by BAFTA nominee Simon Stone (“The Dig”); and Ava DuVernay‘s “Heist of Benin,” starring David Oyelowo. The company also teased several ambitious French movies slated for a theatrical release in 2026: “Les Miserables,” a sweeping adaptation of Victor Hugo’s classic with director Fred Cavayé and the ensemble cast: Vincent Lindon, Tahar Rahim, Benjamin Lavernhe, Noémie Merlant, Vassili Schneider, Marie Colomb and Megan Northam who took part in a panel discussion, followed by a teaser reveal; and “Violette,” the next film by “Amelie” director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, starring Leila Bekhti in the lead role. \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTahar Rahim, Noémie Merlant\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMAT NINAT STUDIO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAlso teased at The Original+ were “Guru,” a paranoid thriller by “Black Box” director Yann Gozlan starring Pierre Niney who was on hand at the showcase, alongside Maïmouna Doucouré (“Cuties”), who will be filming her anticipated Josephine Baker biopic next year, and Jonathan Cohen, the French actor-turned-filmmaker who announced that he had been tapped to write and direct a live-action adaptation of “The Twelve Tasks of Asterix,” a popular animated series created by Goscinny and Uderzo in 1976.\n\t\n\n\tOn stage, Marsh said that Studiocanal invests €220 million in film and TV productions , as well as finances and distributes 80 films and about 20 series per year through a network of 200 production labels and a library of more than 9,400 titles. As Canal+ Group recently completed its acquisition of a 34-percent stake in UGC, which operates one of France’s leading cinema chains, Studiocanal intends on doubling down on theatrical in the next couple  of years. Marsh revealed in a recent interview with Variety that the company is also exploring distribution operations in new territories besides France, the U.K., Germany/Austria, Poland, Spain and Australia/New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnna Marsh\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMAT NINAT STUDIO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tStudiocanal saw the box office for its productions and co-productions triple between 2022 and 2024, and Marsh said the outfit will look to build on that momentum in 2026 and 2027 with upscale, theatrically-driven movies, such as “Les Miserables,” “Violette,” “Guru,” the Josephine Baker biopic and the next live-action “Asterix” movie. \n\n\tSome shows slated for 2026 were also highlighted by key talent and filmmakers at The Original+, notably actor Tewfik Jallab for “Apollo Has Fallen,” a sequel to the “Has Fallen” franchise from BAFTA-winning director Howard Overman; actors Sami Bouajila and Mamadou Sidibé for “Un prophete,” a series inspired by Jacques Audiard’s Oscar-nominated film by the same name; Rahim, who besides “Les Miserables,” was also there to talk about “Prisoner,” an international series for Canal+ and Sky; and Nomzamo Mbatha, the multi-hyphenate South African star and producer who chatted about development at MultiChoice Group, which was recently fully acquired by Canal+, including “Spinners 2.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNomzamo Mbatha (actrice dans le film ” Shaka iLembe”)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMAT NINAT STUDIO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Original+ also brought on stage many of France’s most popular comedians who have been working closely with Canal+’s flagship pay-TV channel for decades, such as Jamel Debbouze, Florence Foresti and Paul Mirabel who are each preparing new shows. \n\n\tThe group, for which comedy has always been a part of its DNA, saved its most unexpected news for the end of The Original+, as it rolled a clip of SNL star Chloé Fineman announcing (in French) that “Saturday Night Live” is coming to France. Canal+ is indeed developing a French adaptation in close collaboration with the American teams. “Each episode will feature a special guest, who, surrounded by a permanent troupe of comedians, will present their own show,” said Canal+. \n\t\n\n\tBefore The Original+ presentation started, as guests were being welcomed by a Santa dressed in black – the Canal+ color code, Variety caught up with Rahim and Merlant about “Les Miserables.” \n\n\tRahim, who plays Javert in the epic film, said the role “was something interesting, as well as emotionally and psychologically challenging.” “What we wanted to do with Fred Cavayé was to bring something that’s never been told before. And we found a little seed in the book that we watered to bring something different and new to Javert,” he said, before adding that the film will boast a face-to-face between Javert and Valjean, played by Lindon.  \n\n\tThe movie will also boast powerful female characters. Merlant, whose credits include “Portrait of a Lady on Fire,” as well as “Lee” and “Tàr,” talked about her role as Fantine, whom she describes as “a courageous woman who handles everything alone by herself… like a lot of women, even today.” She says the film gives a “lot of power to women.”\n\n\tWhile on stage, Lindon, who is one of France’s most revered actors with recent roles in “Titane” and “Of Money and Blood,” said playing Valjean “was the role I dreamed of playing.” “I hope you dream of seeing it, and I hope I live up to that.” The movie will be released in December 2026. \n\n\tMbatha, meanwhile, reflected on Canal+ Group’s impact in the African content through its acquisition of MultiChoice. \n\n\t“It’s important to see Canal+ come to the continent… African stories will not just be hyper-local,” she said, before adding, “The incredible thing that Canal+ has said from the very beginning is that ‘We want to work with local producers, we want to work with local filmmakers, and we want to take local talent to global stages.'”\n\n\t“African stories have been dying to be able to also have equal participation in the global stage,” Mbatha continued. \n\n\tThe Original+ wrapped on a Christmas-y note with a choir of children singing the Canal+ lineup. \n\n",

    "body": "\n\tLeading German production company i&u Studios, a subsidiary of Leonine Studios, has unveiled the docu-reality series “Brabus: One Second Wow,” in collaboration with the luxury automotive brand Brabus.\n\n\tBrabus, based in the heart of Germany’s Ruhr region, is known for its development of supercars and automotive enhancements.\n\n\t“Brabus: One Second Wow” combines the “intensity of a corporate documentary with the narrative dynamics of global lifestyle reality formats,” according to a statement. The six-part series will launch in spring 2026 on Prime Video and is aimed equally at car and design enthusiasts as well as fans of high-quality, character-driven premium documentary series.\n\t\n\n\tThe focus is on CEO Constantin Buschmann, a young entrepreneur who is continuing the life’s work of his father, Bodo Buschmann, and, together with his team and his partner Mili Umicevic, is leading the family business into the future in its second generation.\n\n\n\tThe series accompanies the power couple as they tackle the challenge of balancing corporate success, brand cult and private life, while also offering personal insights beyond the Brabus showroom. The show offers “a unique look behind the scenes of a global luxury brand and its management team, between hard work, jet-set everyday life, and international events from Beverly Hills to Milan.” Several celebrity customers and business partners from Europe and the U.S. also make an appearance.\n\n\tChristian Meinberger, managing director of i&u Studios and producer of the series, said: “With ‘Brabus: One Second Wow,’ we are opening the doors to one of the most fascinating German luxury brands and the people behind it for the first time—authentically, emotionally, and with an outstanding visual power. We are particularly proud of the hybrid narrative style we are establishing with this series.\n\t\n\n\t“This docu-reality series is a groundbreaking format that combines the depth of a brand-driven documentary series with the immediacy and lightness of a personality-driven lifestyle series—including rare insights into the private lives of the people behind Brabus. Never before has an established and successful German legacy brand with international appeal granted such comprehensive access.\n\n\t“The world of the family-owned company Brabus, with its fascinating products, strong personalities, and five decades of international success, has everything it takes to inspire a wide audience. The collaboration on this series marks the beginning of a long-term partnership along the vast Leonine Studios value chain.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMore than a decade after “The Intouchables” became a global box office phenomenon and launched Omar Sy’s international career, a Turkish remake of the French buddy comedy titled “Yan Yana” is doing gangbuster business in Turkey, becoming the country’s 2025 box office champ.\n\n\tSince the film’s Nov. 14 release in Turkish movie theatres via Universal Pictures International, “Yan Yana,” which is directed by Mert Baykal, has scored more than two million admissions, pulling more than $12.4 million, and counting.\n\t\n\n\tThat figure is more than twice the Turkish box office take of “A Minecraft Movie” ($5.2 million) and roughly three times as much as “Zootopia 2” ($4.1 million), according to Box Office Mojo figures.\n\n\n\tProduced by Turkey’s NuLook Production – the prominent company behind works by prominent Turkish helmers Nuri Bilge Ceylan and Emin Alper – “Yan Yanna” is also the first Turkish film to be released locally in IMAX format. \n\n\tThe Turkish adaptation follows the same premise as the original “Intouchables,” which was produced by Gaumont.  A wealthy man, Refik (Haluk Bilginer), is paralyzed after a paragliding accident and hires a cheerful caregiver, Ferruh (Feyyaz Yiğit), who comes from a completely different background.\n\n\t“Yan Yana,” which is also being released in several European territories (France, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands) via European distributor Cinedex, follows several other “Intouchables” adaptations around the world. These include the film’s 2019 American remake “The Upside” directed by Neil Burger starring Bryan Cranston as a wealthy quadriplegic and Kevin Hart as his caregiver which was a surprise box office hit for STX Entertainment following distribution delays due to the Harvey Weinstein scandal.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKriv Stenders has signed on to helm “Little Miracles,” a country music feature that will mark a collaboration between Australia’s Bronte Studios and First Option Pictures, with production scheduled to commence in 2026.\n\n\tThe project stems from an original concept by Mark Morrissey and features a screenplay penned by Steve Worland and Jeremy Sims. Morrissey is producing through his First Option Pictures banner alongside Bronte Studios’ Blake Northfield and Michelle Krumm.\n\t\n\n\tStenders’ previous directing work includes “Danger Close,” “Red Dog” and “The Correspondent,” which scored 14 nominations at this year’s Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts awards. Worland wrote “Paper Planes,” while Sims penned “Last Cab to Darwin.”\n\n\n\t“Country music is the backbone of Australian storytelling. Australia is the world’s third-largest country music market, yet it’s rarely seen on our screens,” the producers noted. “We believe Kriv is the perfect director to bring this beautiful story to life and have wanted to collaborate with him for a long time. With films like ‘Slim & I,’ ‘Boy from the Bush’ and ‘Red Dog,’ it feels like a natural fit for him to bring those worlds together in ‘Little Miracles.'”\n\n\tStenders added: “For me, there is nothing more magical in cinema than the fusion of music, story and emotion — an alchemy that transforms personal experience into a collective one. ‘Little Miracles’ is a celebration of that power — a story about how songs can unite us, connect us and deepen our understanding of one another.”\n\n\tDavid Hirschfelder has joined the production as music director and composer. The veteran composer’s credits span “Strictly Ballroom,” “Australia” and “The Dressmaker.”\n\t\n\n\tRialto Distribution has secured theatrical distribution rights in Australia, committing to a wide release for the film.\n\n\tAdditional casting announcements and production details will be revealed as the 2026 shoot date approaches.\n\n\tBronte Studios’ recent slate includes “Beast of War” and has action thriller “Train” and feature “Dogs of War” in pre-production for first quarter starts. First Option Pictures was established by producer and talent manager Morrissey to develop commercially viable film and television projects.\n",

The position carries a two-year term with the possibility of one re-election.\n\n\tLee, who assumed the role in 2021 from filmmaker Ang Lee, highlighted his focus during his tenure on maintaining the Golden Horse’s independence and impartiality while supporting emerging filmmakers on the international stage.\n\t\n\n\t“After years of reflection and observation, I believe that the Golden Horse must stay innovative and energetic, and so must its chair,” Lee said in a statement. “The candidate who came to my mind was Chang Chen, whose cinematic achievements speak for themselves and whose ability to evolve with the times is especially rare.”\n\n\n\tLee noted that Ang Lee strongly supported the selection, and thanked Motion Picture and Film Promotion Recreation Organization Republic of China president Kevin Chu and the board of directors for their approval.\n\n\tChang made his acting debut in Edward Yang’s “A Brighter Summer Day” in 1991. He has earned six Golden Horse nominations for best leading actor, winning twice — for “The Soul” in 2021 and “Lucky Lu” in 2025. His performance in “Lucky Lu” also received a nomination for best lead performance at this year’s Film Independent Spirit Awards.\n\n\tThe actor has collaborated with some of Asia’s most acclaimed directors, including Hou Hsiao-hsien, Edward Yang, Ang Lee, Wong Kar Wai, Tian Zhuang-zhuang, John Woo and Chung Mong-hong. His international credits include Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part One,” Sabu’s “Mr. Long” and Kim Ki-duk’s “Breath.”\n\t\n\n\t“Through Mark’s explanations and those of CEO Wen Tien-hsiang, I began to reflect: beyond acting, what more could I contribute to cinema?” Chang said. “With the professional Golden Horse team in place, I felt reassured in accepting this entirely new challenge.”\n\n\tChang referenced a summer theater production directed by Sylvia Chang for the Gosh Foundation as inspiration for accepting the role, citing her decades-long dedication to performance and visual arts. He also invoked “Forrest Gump,” saying: “Perhaps, like ‘Forrest Gump,’ I should simply keep running. I hope the next Golden Horse will remain true to its spirit, as it has always been, and together we will keep running toward an even brighter day.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a year when the Göteborg Film Festival will highlight the importance of truth, it will give its international Honorary Dragon Award to a director who has been doing that all her long, storied and multi-prized career: Poland’s Agnieszka Holland. \n\n\tOne of European cinema’s greats, Holland will present “Franz,” her non-bio, non-hagiographic but playful takes on the Czech writer, his life, inspirations and impact down to this day, where he is now part of Prague’s tourist industry. \n\t\n\n\tPrague made her, Holland maintains. Arriving in the mid-’60s from her native Poland, it gave her a film education at its famed FAMU film school, an inspiration in the Czech New Wave and a grounding in activism – she supported the 1968 Prague Spring – repression and life. This she channelled to the good in her work, a creative process observed in the final part of “Screen Tests,” (1979) one of her earliest films when she returned to Poland, which will play at a Göteborg retrospective. \n\n\n\tHolland was respected from almost the get-go. Made back in Poland, “Screen Tests” opened the very first Göteborg Film Festival in 1979. Her “Provincial Actors,” also part of  the Göteborg showcase, won a 1980 Cannes’ Fipresci Award. \n\n\tThe retrospective will also take in Holland’s most famous film, the Oscar-nominated and Golden Globe winning “Europa, Europa” (1993) where she tells the true-facts based story of Jew Solomon Perel, who survives WWII by admission to a Soviet orphanage and then Germany’s Nazi Youth. \n\n\tAsking unpalatable questions about here the frailty of European identity or about Belarus and Polish immigration policy in “Green Border,” another Göteborg title,  has turned Holland into an ethical example for many, while abominated by others. Göteborg audiences, after seeing “Green Border,” can reflect on what is happening in a Europe where Poland’s Minister of Justice, after “Green Border,” came to compare her to Goebbels and Stalin. \n\t\n\n\t“But I am not a politician,” she has told Variety’s Chief Film Critic Peter Debruge. “I think that my duty — or maybe ‘duty’ is too heavy a word, by like my aim — is to speak about the things that people don’t want to hear, maybe, and the politicians made them hostile against the voices which are rising in defense of some values which had been widely accepted 10 years ago and now are not anymore.”    \n\n\t“Agnieszka Holland is one of the most distinctive voices in European cinema and one of the most vital filmmakers of our time. With films such as ‘Europa Europa’ and ‘In Darkness,’ she has explored historical and contemporary crises through an uncompromising humanist lens. Moving effortlessly between intimate character studies and politically charged narratives, her work is marked by precision, empathy, and fearless artistic integrity,’ the Göteborg Festival observed Wednesday.\n\n\t“Throughout her career, Holland has combined artistic power with an unwavering political commitment. Several of her films have been banned, she herself has been arrested, and most recently Green Border sparked political outrage in her home country. These reactions are a direct result of her persistent determination to confront Europe’s darker realities, past and present,” it added.\n\n\tHolland’s career is, however, far broader than the works she directed in her native country. Back in Poland, Andrzej Wajda, who took her under his wing, paid her the ultimate compliment of asking her to serve as first assistant director on “Man of Marble” and help rework the screenplay of Cannes Palme d’Or winner “Man of Iron,” to make reference to events unfolding at that very same time at Gdansk shipyard. \n\n\tKrzysztof Kieślowski asked her to collaborate on the screenplays of his “Three Colors” trilogy, David Simon employed her to direct episodes of “The Wire.” and “Treme.” She directed “The Secret Garden,” a home run and also at Göteborg, for Francis Ford Coppola. \n\n\t“Agnieszka Holland has repeatedly demonstrated how cinema can be both artistically groundbreaking and deeply rooted in the moral questions of our time,” said Göteborg Artistic Director Pia Lundberg. “To welcome a filmmaker who for decades has explored the many layers of truth – the uncomfortable, the contradictory, and the profoundly human – is particularly meaningful this year, when the festival’s focus is precisely on truth.”\n\t\n\n\tHolland will receive the Honorary Dragon Award at Stora Teatern on Jan. 30. Her acceptance and an onstage interview with her will no doubt mark highlights of 2026’s Göteborg Festival.\n\n\tThe 2026 Göteborg Film Festival runs Jan. 23–Feb. 1. The full program will be announced on Jan. 7.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGar O’Rourke joins the likes of Frederick Wiseman with an immersive observational documentary that takes a sensitive look at a community attempting to relax under conditions of growing unease. Though O’Rourke is an Irish filmmaker, working with majority Irish funding, his chosen location is Ukraine, a country under attack. But this is no front-and-center war documentary. Rather, it’s about what happens outside the combat zones at a faded holiday destination.\n\t\n\n\tTo glance at it, the Kuyalnik Sanatorium, located near Odesa in southern Ukraine, could be a power station, military base or even a sewage treatment center. In fact, treatments of another kind draw everyday people to this imposing Soviet-era construction: Mud baths, massages and all sorts of other wellness procedures are the stock in trade of the striking but down-at-heel institution.\n\n\tDenys Melnyk film’s the facility’s guests with compassion but also honesty, preserving their dignity without airbrushing their reality. The variety of body types and shapes shown here, often covered in very little, is a reminder that despite the smoothness of the people held up as worthy of admiration on Instagram, most people’s bodies and faces have lumps and bumps and creases and crinkles. Showing this in such a contemplative fashion feels quietly radical in an attention economy that has normalized loudness. \n\n\n\tWith no narrator to impose an interpretation, “Sanatorium” is the opposite of a spoon-fed social issues doc: It observes, listens and trusts the audience likewise to observe, listen and to draw their own conclusions. That’s not to say it isn’t characterful or funny; it is. As guests dance to George Michael’s lush classic “Careless Whisper” at the spa disco, a viewer might recall the Austrian director Ulrich Seidl’s witty scene construction, but where Seidl’s warts-and-all work sometimes crosses a line into mercilessness, the humor here doesn’t erase anybody’s humanity. There’s always a warmth and dignity to the portrayal of the people involved.\n\t\n\n\tThere’s even a sense of religious ritual to some scenes: As clients are painted gently with healing mud and wrapped in cloth, it’s like witnessing the embalming of saints, an effect emphasized by Denis Kilty’s score. When the Renaissance painter Caravaggio first started to attract fame, a big part of his appeal was that although his subjects were notionally saints and Biblical figures, his models were everyday people from the streets of Rome, leading to Madonnas with the face of a popular local sex worker, disciples with the frame of the skinny old man selling fish in the market or a prosperous Archdeacon bearing a fleeting resemblance to the proprietor of a nearby dive bar. These are the kinds of faces O’Rourke foregrounds, similarly centering the quotidian to sanctifying effect. This contrasts beautifully with the modest effects of the treatments, as reported by the clients themselves: “Psoriasis is no longer getting worse.”\n\n\tThe location is an important character as well, with the crumbling building itself providing a striking arena for the low-key drama. The ambition and pride that would have been involved in its construction, during the height of the USSR’s power and influence, contrasted with its current state of managed decline, provides a piquant Ozymandias monument: “Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair” — a topical theme, as aging men in power across the world attempt to ensure they will be remembered, often with harmful consequences.\n\n\tWith values like wit and stoicism baked in, “Sanatorium” always felt like a long shot in the Oscar international feature race, where it is representing Ireland this year. But if the Academy were ever to introduce a category honoring most nuance, this kind of film would be a frontrunner.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery‘s board has formally said “no thanks” to the $108 billion takeover bid from David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance and unanimously reiterated its support for the Netflix deal.\n\n\tParamount and Ellison’s financial backers, which include his father, tech billionaire Larry Ellison, will now evaluate the rejection notice from WBD’s board of directors — and then decide whether to make a higher offer.\n\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery said it remains committed to its megadeal with Netflix, under which the streamer would buy the Warner Bros. studios, HBO and HBO Max for $27.75/share. That would take place after WBD’s planned Q3 2026 spin-off of Discovery Global, largely comprising the company’s TV networks.\n\t\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery said Wednesday its board “has unanimously determined that the tender offer launched by Paramount Skydance (‘PSKY’) on December 8, 2025, is not in the best interests of WBD and its shareholders and does not meet the criteria of a ‘Superior Proposal’ under the terms of WBD’s merger agreement with Netflix announced on December 5, 2025.” The Warner Bros. Discovery board “recommends that WBD shareholders reject PSKY’s offer.”\n\n\t“The terms of the Netflix merger are superior. The PSKY offer provides inadequate value and imposes numerous, significant risks and costs on WBD,” Warner Bros. Discovery’s board says in a letter to shareholders (read it in full below). The company also documents the sequence of interactions with Paramount in a Schedule 14D-9 filing Wednesday with the SEC.\n\n\tAccording to the WBD board’s letter, Paramount “has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a ‘full backstop’ from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has.”\n\t\n\n\tPer the Warner Bros. Discovery board, the most recent Paramount Skydance proposal includes a $40.65 billion equity commitment “for which there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind. Instead, they propose that you rely on an unknown and opaque revocable trust for the certainty of this crucial deal funding.” \n\n\tThe WBD board letter continues: “Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was — and despite their own ample resources, as well as multiple assurances by PSKY during our strategic review process that such a commitment was forthcoming — the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer.” Warner Bros.’s board said a revocable trust is “no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling stockholder” because the assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change.\n\n\tFurthermore, according to the WBD letter, Paramount’s acquisition offer “can be terminated or amended by PSKY at any time prior to its completion” and is therefore not the same thing as a binding merger agreement.\n\n\t“The PSKY offer is illusory,” the letter says.\n\n\tAdditionally, the Warner Bros. Discovery board commented on Paramount’s expectation that it can achieve $9 billion in cost synergies ($3 billion from Paramount-Skydance and $6 billion with WBD). “These targets are both ambitious from an operational perspective and would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger,” WBD board’s says. Netflix has identified $2 billion-$3 billion in expected cost synergies.\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery chair Samuel Di Piazza Jr. said in a statement: “Following a careful evaluation of Paramount’s recently launched tender offer, the Board concluded that the offer’s value is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders. This offer once again fails to address key concerns that we have consistently communicated to Paramount throughout our extensive engagement and review of their six previous proposals. We are confident that our merger with Netflix represents superior, more certain value for our shareholders and we look forward to delivering on the compelling benefits of our combination.”\n\n\tRELATED: David Ellison Courted Warner Bros. Discovery’s Zaslav Hard Over 12 Weeks to Win a Deal. Then WBD’s Chief Stopped Responding to His Texts\n\t\n\n\tOn Wednesday, Netflix released a statement saying it “welcomes” the WBD board’s recommendation. It also pointed to its website, netflixwbtogether.com, touting the benefits of its deal with Warner Bros.\n\n\t“The Warner Bros. Discovery Board reinforced that Netflix’s merger agreement is superior and that our acquisition is in the best interest of stockholders,” said Ted Sarandos, Netflix co-CEO, in a statement. “This was a competitive process that delivered the best outcome for consumers, creators, stockholders and the broader entertainment industry.” Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters added: “By acquiring Warner Bros., we’ll be able to offer audiences and creators around the world even more choice, value and opportunity. This transaction is fundamentally pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-creator and pro-growth.”\n\n\tOver the course of 12 weeks, Ellison had proffered an increasingly aggressive series of bids for Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety, starting at $19/share Sept. 14 and most recently offering $30/share as of Dec. 4. After WBD picked Netflix as the winning bidder, Ellison on Dec. 8 launched a hostile takeover maneuver, announcing that Skydance was taking its offer for all of Warner Bros. Discovery directly to shareholders.\n\n\tIn prior communications to the Paramount team, WBD’s board had expressed concerns that Paramount’s Dec. 1 bid — backed by the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi, as first reported by Variety — would trigger a problematic national security review by the U.S. government because of the foreign investors. Paramount Skydance’s bid also was being backed by Affinity Partners, the investment firm founded by Jared Kushner, who is Donald Trump’s son-in-law. To address these concerns, Paramount disclosed in an SEC filing, the three Arab wealth funds and Kushner’s Affinity “agreed to forgo any governance rights — including board representation — associated with their non-voting equity investments.” On Tuesday, Kushner’s Affinity Partners said it was no longer participating in Paramount’s hostile takeover bid for WBD.\n\n\tParamount claimed that if the Middle Eastern wealth funds dropped out, the Ellison family and RedBird Capital Partners would “backstop the full amount of the equity financing” of its bid. As of Dec. 16, Larry Ellison’s net worth was approximately $240 billion, per Forbes. As noted in the WBD shareholder letter, Paramount’s equity financing commitment is backed by the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust.\n\t\n\n\tMore broadly, Paramount has argued that its $30/share offer is a better deal for WBD shareholders than Netflix’s starting with the fact that it’s all-cash, compared with Netflix’s agreement that is 84% cash.\n\n\tParamount also has asserted that a Paramount-WBD merger would have a clearer path to regulatory approval compared with Netflix, which would amass even more power in the premium video streaming market through the takeover of HBO Max. According to the letter to WBD’s board to shareholders, “Despite PSKY’s media statements to the contrary, the Board does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk between the PSKY offer and the Netflix merger.”\n\n\tFor their part, Netflix execs have expressed confidence they will obtain all necessary approvals to close the deal. \n\n\tAccording to Paramount, WBD is overvaluing the TV networks group (which is excluded from the Netflix deal). Because WBD went with Netflix’s bid, that implies WBD is ascribing a value of at least $2.25/share to the TV networks group. But Paramount argues that the value of WBD’s networks group is in fact much lower: roughly $1/share, working out to an equity valuation of about $2.6 billion, assuming the spun-off entity will have a 3.5x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. However, at a lower leverage ratio, Discovery Global would have a higher market value — to the point where the Netflix terms plus the Discovery Global valuation would exceed $30/share, according to an analysis by Wall Street firm MoffettNathanson.\n\n\tPresident Trump, meanwhile, has said he will be “involved” in a Warner Bros. deal review. Trump, who has been palsy with the Ellisons, has in recent weeks lashed out at them over his perceived mistreatment by CBS News’ “60 Minutes” and wrote in a Dec. 15 social-media post, “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”\n\n\tRead Warner Bros. Discovery’s letter to shareholders explaining its rejection of the Paramount Skydance offer:\n\n\tDear Fellow Shareholders,\n\n\tAs your Board of Directors, we are committed to acting in your best interest. In this spirit, in October, we launched a public review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. This followed three separate proposals from Paramount Skydance (“PSKY”), as well as interest from multiple other parties.\n\t\n\n\tThat thorough process, overseen by the Board with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors, as well as our management team, led to the company entering into a merger agreement with Netflix on December 4, with the substantial benefits to WBD shareholders described below. Having failed to submit the best proposal for you, our shareholders, PSKY launched an offer nearly identical to its most recently rejected proposal.\n\n\tAs a Board, we have now conducted another review and determined that PSKY’s tender offer remains inferior to the Netflix merger. The Board continues to unanimously recommend the Netflix merger, and that you reject the PSKY offer and not tender your shares.\n\n\tBelow, and in more detail in our 14D-9 filing, we highlight the many reasons for the Board’s determination. None of these reasons will be a surprise to PSKY given our clear, and oft- repeated, feedback on their six prior proposals.\n\n\tThe terms of the Netflix merger are superior. The PSKY offer provides inadequate value and imposes numerous, significant risks and costs on WBD.\n\n\tThe value we have secured for shareholders through the Netflix merger is extraordinary by any measure.\n\n\tOur agreement with Netflix gives WBD shareholders $23.25 in cash, plus $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock (based on a collar range of $97.91 – $119.67 in the Netflix stock price at the Ume of closing), plus the additional value of the shares of Discovery Global and the opportunity to participate in future potential upside following Discovery Global’s separation from WBD. The entire Board is confident in our recommendation that Netflix represents the best value-creating path for shareholders.\n\n\tPSKY has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a “full backstop” from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has.\n\n\tPSKY’s most recent proposal includes a $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind. Instead, they propose that you rely on an unknown and opaque revocable trust for the certainty of this crucial deal funding. Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was – and despite their own ample resources, as well as multiple assurances by PSKY during our strategic review process that such a commitment was forthcoming – the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer.\n\t\n\n\tAnd a revocable trust is no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling stockholder. The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change. As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time. And the documents provided by PSKY for this conditional commitment contain gaps, loopholes and limitations that put you, our shareholders, and our company at risk.\n\n\tAmplifying the concerns about the credibility of the equity commitment being offered by PSKY, the revocable trust and PSKY have agreed that the trust’s liability for damages, even in the case of a willful breach, would be capped at 7% of its commitment ($2.8 billion on a $108.4 billion transaction). Of course, the damage to WBD and its stockholders were the trust or PSKY to breach their obligations to close a transaction would likely be many multiples of this amount.\n\n\tWBD’s merger agreement with Netflix is a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments. The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet. The debt financing for the PSKY bid relies on an unsecure revocable trust commitment as well as the credit worthiness of a $15 billion market cap company with a credit rating at or only a notch above “junk” status from the two leading rating agencies. The financial condition and creditworthiness of PSKY, which, if its proposed transaction were to close, would have a high gross leverage ratio of 6.8x 2026E debt to EBITDA with virtually no current free cash flow generation before synergies, raise substantial risks for its acquisition of WBD. Such debt levels reflect a risky capital structure that is vulnerable to even potentially small changes in the PSKY or WBD business between signing and closing.\n\n\tAdditionally, PSKY contemplates $9 billion in synergies from the mergers of Paramount/Skydance and their offer for WBD. These targets are both ambitious from an operational perspective and would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.\n\n\tThe Board’s review was full, transparent and competitive – establishing a level playing field that fostered a rigorous and fair process.\n\t\n\n\tThe Board repeatedly engaged with all parties, including extensive engagement with PSKY and its advisors over the course of nearly three months. We held dozens of calls and meetings with its principals and advisors including four in-person meetings and meals between David Zaslav and David and/or Larry Ellison and provided multiple opportunities for PSKY to offer a proposal that was superior to those of the other bidders, which PSKY never did.\n\n\tAfter each bid, we informed PSKY of the material deficiencies and offered potential solutions. Despite this feedback, PSKY has never submitted a proposal that is superior to the Netflix merger agreement.\n\n\tDespite PSKY’s media statements to the contrary, the Board does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk between the PSKY offer and the Netflix merger.\n\n\tThe Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the PSKY offer with its regulatory advisors. The Board believes that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material. The Board also notes that Netflix has agreed to a record-setting regulatory termination cash fee of $5.8 billion, significantly higher than PSKY’s $5 billion break fee.\n\n\tThe PSKY offer is illusory.\n\n\tThe offer can be terminated or amended by PSKY at any time prior to its completion; it is not the same thing as a binding merger agreement. The first paragraph of the offer states it is “subject to the conditions set forth in this offer to purchase (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time)” and continues on the next page, “we reserve the right to amend the Offer in any respect (including amending the Offer Price)”. In addition, the offer is not capable of being completed by its current expiration date, due to the need for, among other things, global regulatory approvals, which PSKY indicates may take 12-18 months. Nothing in this structure offers WBD shareholders any deal certainty.\n\n\tThe PSKY offer provides an untenable degree of risk and potential downside for WBD shareholders.\n\n\tThere will be additional costs associated with PSKY’s offer that could impact shareholders.\n\t\n\n\tWhen considering the PSKY offer at this juncture, it is important to note that its acceptance could incur significant additional costs to shareholders – all of which PSKY has ignored in their communications. WBD would have to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee, which PSKY has not offered to reimburse. In addition, WBD would incur approximately $1.5 billion in financing costs if we do not complete our planned debt exchange as agreed to with certain of our debtholders, which would not be permitted by the PSKY offer. This additional $4.3 billion in potential costs represents approximately $1.66 per share to be borne by WBD shareholders if the offer does not close.\n\n\tWe look forward to moving ahead with our combination with Netflix and delivering the compelling and certain value it will create for shareholders. We urge you to carefully read the 14D-9 filed with the SEC this morning and available on our website, which more fully details the strategic review process and the Board’s reasons for its recommendation to you.\n\n\tSincerely,\n\n\tThe Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors\n",

He also faces a special allegation that he personally used a dangerous and deadly weapon, a knife.\" Reiner's arraignment has not been scheduled.\n      \n    \n          1:15 PM PT -- Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan J. Hochman came out swinging in his latest comments on the Rob and Michele Reiner double-murder case ... he says the death penalty is on the table if their son, Nick Reiner, is convicted of murdering his parents.\n      \n    \n          Hochman says Nicks is going to be charged with two counts of first-degree murder, and he says the charges come with stiff penalties, if convicted ... a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, or even the death penalty.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The D.A. was quick to say there's been no final decision on going after the death penalty here, but the fact he even mentioned it right off the bat is pretty interesting.\n      \n    \n          Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan J. Hochman and LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell are set to hold a press conference at 1 PM PT to update the public on the Rob and Michele Reiner double-murder case.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As we reported ... Rob and Michele's 32-year-old son Nick was arrested on suspicion of killing his parents after they were found stabbed to death in their Brentwood, California home Sunday afternoon.\n      \n    \n          Nick's first court appearance in connection with the murders was scheduled for today, but was taken off the books after he was not medically cleared to appear in court. His attorney told TMZ this morning he has not received any filing yet from prosecutors.\n      \n\n          TMZ broke the story ... Rob and Michele's daughter, Romy, discovered their bodies and called 911 around 3:40 PM Sunday. Romy told police Nick was \"dangerous\" and should be considered a suspect.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          While Nick lived at home with his parents, Romy noted to the police Nick wasn't at the home when she arrived, insinuating he fled.\n      \n    \n          We now know Nick checked into The Pierside Santa Monica hotel around 4 AM Sunday, using his credit card. The reservation was made for just a day, but Nick never formally checked out. When the staff came into his room later Sunday morning, they found the shower \"full of blood\" and blood on the bed.\n      \n    \n          Nick was arrested about 6 hours after his parents' bodies were discovered. He's held on suicide watch at Men's Central Jail in L.A. without bond.\n      \n      ",

He quickly cut a deal with the feds after a slew of arrests were made in connection with Perry's death.

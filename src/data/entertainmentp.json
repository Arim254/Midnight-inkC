    "body": "\n\tKevin Spacey is set to face three more claims of sexual assault in London civil court next year.\n\n\tAccording to BBC News, three men have sued the actor over allegations that he assaulted them between 2000 and 2013. At a hearing in London’s High Court on Wednesday, a provisional trial date of Oct. 12, 2026 was suggested, though it is still to be decided if the claims will be heard in a single civil trial or three consecutive ones.\n\n\n\tSpacey, who was acquitted of sexual assault charges brought by four men in a U.K. criminal trial in 2023, has denied all allegations. BBC News reported that Spacey has formally denied two of the three civil claims in court, but has not yet filed a defense for the third. A rep for Spacey did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment on the new civil trial.\n\t\n\n\tOne of the men suing Spacey in civil court previously did so in 2022, but the case was put on hold during  his criminal trial. The man, who has been granted anonymity by the court, claims he “suffered psychiatric damage and other financial loss” as a result of the alleged sexual assault, which he says took place in August 2008.\n\n\tAnother man, Ruari Cannon, waived his right to anonymity and alleges that Spacey groped him at a party in 2013 while he was starring in a play at the Old Vic, where Spacey was the artistic director. Cannon took part in last year’s Channel 4 docuseries “Spacey Unmasked,” to which the actor responded: “Each time I have been given the time and a proper forum to defend myself, the allegations have failed under scrutiny and I have been exonerated.”\n\t\n\n\tSpacey was also sued in New York civil court in 2022 by actor Anthony Rapp over allegations of sexual assault, but was found not liable by a jury. \n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen the British Independent Film Awards recently unveiled its list of 2025 nominees, there were cheers from within the U.K. industry over the number of first-time filmmakers dominating the categories. Akinola Davies Jr’s “My Father’s Shadow” and Harry Lighton’s “Pillion” — both feature debuts — led the pack of nominated films, while there was also plenty of love for actor-turned-filmmaker Harris Dickinson’s “Urchin” and Laura Carreira’s “On Falling.” \n\t\n\n\tWhichever way the trophies are handed out at the BIFAs ceremony this Sunday at London’s Roundhouse, having so many newcomers battling for the top gongs of best British independent film, best director and best screenplay fits right in the BIFA wheelhouse of supporting rising talent right at the start of their careers. \n\n\n\tBut amid the celebrations there were also murmurings of discontent on social media when it came to the lead and supporting performance categories, which have been gender-neutral starting with the 2022 awards. Of 12 slots available (six in each), woman only managed to secure two spaces — Jennifer Lawrence for her lead role in “Die My Love” (amusingly the first BIFA nod for the Oscar winner and arguably one of the most famous Hollywood stars) and Maxine Peake for supporting in “I Swear.”\n\n\tThe BIFAs has often been trendsetters — or, as they often term it, “guinea pigs” — when it comes to categories. They were the first film awards in the U.K. to introduce a casting award, something later followed by the BAFTAs and — now — the Oscars. And while they can’t claim to be the first to introduce gender-neutral performance categories (although their breakthrough performance award has always been this way), its did announce its plans merely weeks before the Independent Spirit Awards said it intended to do the same. \n\t\n\n\tBut is this year’s male domination of those categories an indication that it’s a decision that needs to be reassessed? \n\n\tNot so, claim Deena Wallace and Amy Gustin, who co-head the BIFAs. In fact, they argue that the latest crop of performance nominations are a complete swing against the usual BIFA grain. \n\n\t“This is actually a massive anomaly for us,” says Gustin. “Normally it’s way the other way — and nobody bats an eyelid. Nobody says, look at these women shining through and the men not getting a look-in. But as soon as it’s the other way, the criticism comes.”\n\n\tThe stats don’t lie. Last year, for lead performance it was the exact opposite, with five women and one man. Overall, since it became gender-neutral, that category has served up 15 woman nominated to five men (with all three winners woman). In supporting, it’s 15 women nominated to 10 men (the category previously allowed for more nominees) — and in 2022 there was just one man among 8 women. There’s also the joint lead performance category — also added in 2022 — which this year includes four woman and two men. \n\n\tIn fact, since BIFA’s 2022 gender-neutral switch, of the 67 performers nominated across lead, supporting and joint lead categories, there have been 39 women and 28 men, 58% in favour of women.\n\n\t“So actually this year is a bit correction,” says Wallace. “It gets us to closer to 50/50 over the three years. But it’s still not there yet.”\n\n\tLike all film awards bodies, the BIFAs are at the very end of the actual filmmaking process, with any notable gender skew more indicative of an industry issue or trend rather than any major fault of a voting system or category arrangement (although online critics rarely see it this way, as the BAFTAs can attest to following the #BAFTASoWhite backlash in 2020). 2025 may indeed be unusually man-heavy in terms of BIFA performance nominations, but Wallace notes that the 2025 submissions for those categories was unusually man-heavy — a figure that was “well over” 60% of the overall across lead, joint lead and supporting. \n\n\t“Who knows whether this is a trend, whether this is because there are more male led films being commissioned,” she adds. “But we are slightly able to be a canary in the coal mine for things like that. Where you have the two gender split categories, any trend like that is masked. We’ll have to wait and look back at it over a longer period, but you wouldn’t notice it if it was split.”\n\t\n\n\tAnd where many complaints about a male-skewed imbalance among nominees are often pegged to a body of voters that is overwhelmingly male, at the BIFAs — once again — it’s the opposite. “There are loads more women voting for the BIFAs than there are men,” asserts Wallace. This year, across more than 600 nominations voters, 58% percent are women, while in the performance subgroup that decides the nominees, 68% were woman and non-binary. “So it’s not like there are loads of lads making all these decisions.”\n\n\tWhile there are no major tweaks to the main categories this year, there is a new addition in the form of the Cinema of the Year award, celebrating the best independent cinemas in the U.K. It’s not an award likely to be of much concern to watchers surveying the lay of the land as awards season shifts up a gear, but it’s an addition Gustin says was “massive” for the BIFAs, being their first ever public vote. \n\n\t“We just didn’t know if anyone would care or how familiar cinemas were with us,  and thought, maybe we’ll get 40 cinemas in,” she says. In the end, more than 130 applied. And when it came to the actual voting, more than 100,000 votes were submitted (putting to the test a bespoke system built by partners Print.Work).\n\n\t“But people weren’t just voting, but also leaving comments and love letters to their cinemas,” says Gustin. “We’ve been sending all the feedback back to the cinemas and they’re like ‘Oh my God, this is making me cry.’ So it’s been really nice and adorable.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKristin Chenoweth took to Instagram Wednesday night to share her thoughts on the recent cancellation of her musical “The Queen of Versailles” and to thank her fans for supporting the show.\n\n\t“Hi everybody, it’s Kristin Chenoweth,” she said. “I just wanted to say, I know some of you may have heard that ‘The Queen of Versailles’ on Broadway is closing Jan. 4. I just want to say that I’m so proud of this new art that we’ve created, and it’s getting harder and harder to do so.”\n\t\n\n\n\tShe continued, “I think about all the shows in the past couple of seasons that have come and gone that not everybody got to see. I just love Broadway so much, and I love audiences and the live art form. If you’ve come to see our show, we thank you, we appreciate you. And if you haven’t, we’re here, like I said, until Jan. 4 at The St. James. We’d love to see you here.”\n\n\n\tThe closing of “The Queen of Versailles” was announced on Monday, less than two weeks after its opening night. The curtains falling on the short-lived musical is part of a larger trend of new Broadway shows struggling to find an audience.\n\n\t“The Queen of Versailles” is based on Lauren Greenfield’s 2012 documentary of the same name, and follows two Florida plutocrats who erect a 90,000 square-foot ultra mansion at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. The musical marked a much-anticipated reunion of Chenoweth and composer Stephen Schwartz, who previously collaborated on the 2003 Broadway mainstay “Wicked.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Behind the Palm Trees” director Meryem Benm’barek is grappling with mixed emotions as her film prepares for its world premiere at the Marrakech Film Festival. \n\n\tOn one hand, the Moroccan auteur — whose feature debut “Sofia” was celebrated in Un Certain Regard in 2018 — is deeply moved to unveil her latest work in her home country. \n\n\t“I know my film will be received in the deepest sense here,” she tells Variety. \n\n\n\tAt the same time, Benm’barek is keenly aware that the versions set for release in Morocco and across the Arab world fall short of her artistic vision. While she reluctantly accepted the minor edits required for Moroccan distribution — mostly trimming wide shots and toning down the more explicit elements of the sex scenes — she describes the version cut down for other MENA territories as a knife to the heart. \n\t\n\n\t“It’s not really my film anymore,” she says of the re-edited cut, shorn nearly in half for the rapidly expanding Saudi market. “I do not endorse it, I do not validate it, and I completely disagree with it. But that’s the law of the market — I don’t really have a say, unless I choose not to release the film in the Arab world, which personally wouldn’t bother me, but from a production standpoint, I doubt is possible.” \n\n\t(Pyramide Films will release the full director’s cut in France and handle international sales exclusively for that version.) \n\n\tIndeed, it would be nearly impossible to erase all traces of sexuality from an intimate thriller centered on a young man from Tangiers torn between two starkly different romantic partners. While young contractor Mehdi (Driss Ramdi) is already half-engaged to Selma (Nadia Kounda), a socially reserved bakery worker, he soon finds himself drawn to the sexually liberated Marie (Sara Giraudeau) — an affluent Frenchwoman who begins as a client before becoming his lover and social benefactor, fueling his fantasies of upward mobility and a different life. \n\t\n\n\t“I needed to maintain absolute creative freedom,” Benm’barek explains. “Marie gives access to her body — and it was important that this could be seen, since the story is experienced through Mehdi’s gaze. Selma, by contrast, is defined by modesty; she doesn’t reveal herself and denies access to her body. The intimate scenes therefore required a different visual language. These were deliberate choices, reflecting my artistic vision and the direction I wanted for the film, even if they may not resonate with everyone.” \n\n\tFilms like “Dirty Dancing” and “Titanic” resonated for Benm’barek as she wrote her latest feature.\n\n\t“A lot of films follow a character moving from one social class to another, but I come from 90s thrillers and those slightly cheesy TV movies on Saturday nights,” she explains. “I make the kinds of films I would’ve loved as a spectator. I don’t think we should overthink everything. Pleasure has to stay at the center, because making films is hard — and it’s only getting harder.”\n\n\t“Ours is a job full of doubt, where nothing is ever really easy,” she says. “So it’s important to hold on to that place of pleasure, to remember what made us want to create films in the first place. We were spectators before anything else, and we were moved by films. That sense of pleasure is essential — otherwise, it just becomes too hard to keep going.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor its inaugural edition, the Doha Film Festival marks a major expansion of the Doha Film Institute’s role in developing homegrown talent, an effort the institute has cultivated for 15 years through grants, labs and year-round training initiatives, including Qumra, Ajyal and earlier festival-style showcases. This year’s Made in Qatar competition brings that pipeline into full view with a slate of 10 shorts from Qatari and Qatar-based directors whose work has been shaped, supported, and mentored by the DFI network.\n\t\n\n\tOf the competition program, festival director and DFI CEO Fatma Hassan Alremaihi said, “Supporting local filmmakers is not only a duty — it is a privilege and a source of great pride for the institute. Our storytellers open windows to our world, share our unique culture, and connect others to our own narratives.” She added that through Made in Qatar, the institute “celebrates the courage and creativity of filmmakers who are defining our cinematic identity and shaping a cultural legacy that extends far beyond our borders.”\n\n\n\tThe festival’s commitment to local voices is also echoed by filmmakers screening in the section. Fatma Al-Ghanim, whose documentary “Theatre of Dreams” revisits the first Qatar Women’s National Football Team, called this “an exciting time to be a filmmaker in Qatar,” crediting the strengthening ecosystem and “complete pipeline” built through DFI’s development and funding programs. Animator and lecturer Mohammed Al-Suwaidi, co-director of “Al-Aqiq: Darkness of Virtuality,” reflected on a decade of collaboration with the institute, noting, “I’ve seen the environment grow and the community mature. There’s real reason for hope.”\n\t\n\n\tFor director Fahad Al-Nahdi, “Project Aisha,” the long-term relationship with the institute has been foundational: “I have worked with DFI for 10 years across festivals and community events, and the growth has been remarkable — more resources, more funding, more opportunity for a stronger impact.” Documentary filmmaker Eiman Mirghani, screening “Villa 187,” emphasized how “DFI Workshops and programs like Qumra continue to nurture local and resident talent,” shaping a generation of filmmakers who have grown alongside the institute itself.\n\n\tTogether, these films form a snapshot of the voices shaping Qatar’s evolving screen culture. Below is a look at each of the 10 projects in this year’s Made in Qatar competition.\n\n\t‘Al-Aqiq: Darkness of Virtuality’Mohammed Al-Suwaidi & Kummam Al-Maadeed (Qatar)Set in the near-future Gulf city of Juna, this animated short follows a rising wave of attacks carried out by a shadowy group known as the Trolls. When an architect’s grandfather is assaulted on camera, a trail of clues pulls him into a conflict where online distortion feeds real-world fear. Blending action with social commentary, the film charts his reluctant turn toward leadership as he joins a new generation determined to hold their city together.\n\n\t‘Baba Is Melting’Karim Emara (Qatar)A longtime participant in DFI programs, including Ajyal, filmmaker Karim Emara channels that creative maturity into this tightly contained confrontation between father and son. As a young man challenges his father from a parked car just before Friday prayer, the film, set under Doha’s oppressive heat, reveals a secret second marriage and exposes the vulnerabilities, silences, and shifting masculinity beneath a seemingly ordinary moment.\n\n\t‘Fahad the Furious’Justin Kramer (Qatar)Justin Kramer draws on more than a decade of collaboration within Qatar’s film community to tell this sharply observed family drama. When Fahad arrives at the mosque with a black eye, his conservative family’s inability to communicate sends them spiraling into assumptions about his life after dark. Set in modern Qatar, the short probes misinterpretation, silence, and the stories families invent when they can’t ask the real questions.\n\n\t‘Is This a Sign?’Maria Joseph (Qatar, India)This fast-paced comedy unfolds in the frantic moments before a wedding ceremony, where a nervous bride contends with an overprotective father, a mischievous sibling, and the sudden disappearance of a precious family heirloom. Joseph’s film plays on cultural expectations and the chaos that surrounds milestone moments. “Casting was a challenge — I even found actors in supermarket aisles,” Joseph says. “My friends became my crew, and they were incredible.”\n\t\n\n\t‘A Palm Branch’Mahdi Al Ali (Qatar)Mahdi Al Ali’s contemplative drama follows a woman moving through the quiet aftermath of loss, where domestic routines, vivid memories, and sea-based folklore begin to intertwine. Contrasts between the vibrant, dreamlike underwater world and the silence of her home reflect her inner struggle. In the end, a quiet ritual with a palm branch offers her a final attempt to let go and move toward something like peace.\n\n\t‘Project Aisha’Fahad Al-Nahdi (Qatar)After a near-fatal accident leaves 12-year-old Aisha immobile, her neurosurgeon mother rejects medical advice and imposes her own strict regime of care inside their home. What begins as fierce protectiveness blurs into control, as the house turns into a monitored, rule-bound space and the film probes the thin line between safeguarding a child and isolating her entirely.\n\n\t‘Qadha’ w Qadar’Maryam Al-Mohammed (Qatar)Set in Doha’s Family Court, Maryam Al-Mohammed’s drama follows Noor as she prepares to face her husband, his lawyer, and the judge as she seeks a divorce, already shaken by troubling news her sister shares moments before entering the courtroom. The film traces rising tension between public procedure and private stakes, capturing a woman navigating pressure, judgment, and the emotional weight of her choices.\n\n\t‘Theatre of Dreams’Fatma Al-Ghanim (Qatar)Set against the backdrop of the FIFA Men’s World Cup Qatar 2022, this personal documentary tells the untold story of the first Qatar Women’s national soccer team. Following Al-Ghanim, who was team captain, more than a decade after she helped break cultural taboos to play, the film traces the courage, defiance, and sacrifices that shaped her journey.\n\n\t‘Yom El Juma’’Haya Al Kuwari (Qatar)Mubarak, a short-tempered widowed father, cherishes Fridays, the weekly gathering that once kept his grown sons close. But when his eldest rushes off and leaves his spirited daughter in his care, the day takes an unexpected turn. As Mubarak babysits his headstrong granddaughter, the film gently observes a man confronting loneliness, shifting family realities, and the small moments that reconnect generations.\n\n\t‘Villa 187’Eiman Mirghani (Qatar, Sudan)Eiman Mirghani turns the camera on her own family as they prepare to leave the Doha home they’ve lived in for more than three decades after her father unexpectedly loses his job and their visa is cancelled. As rooms are emptied and belongings packed, the film sifts through memories, displacement, and the uneasy question of belonging, capturing the uncertainty of a life built, then abruptly uprooted, in a place that was home but never fully theirs.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 5, Volume 1 of “Stranger Things.”\n\n\tIn the battle that concludes Volume 1 of “Stranger Things 5” — in “Sorcerer,” written and directed by Matt and Ross Duffer — it appears at first that all is lost. The murderous creatures of the Upside Down have breached the military zone, and begin a mass slaughter of the soldiers, who’ve underestimated their foes. Elsewhere, Robin (Maya Hawke) and Murray (Brett Gelman) try to bring some of the endangered school children of Hawkins to safety in a truck, as they’re chased by Demogorgons. Meanwhile, the good guys’ biggest assets, Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and Hopper (David Harbour), are in the base in the Upside Down, where they’ve made an important discovery: Eight (Linnea Berthelsen), one of the other telekinetic kids from the Hawkins Lab experiments, with whom Eleven bonded in Season 2, is alive and being held there.  \n\t\n\n\tDuring a lull in the battle, Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) steps through the membrane of the Upside Down to survey his quarry, where Joyce (Winona Ryder), Mike (Finn Wolfhard) and his original prey, Will (Noah Schnapp) — along with the remaining military officers and soldiers — seem to be no match for him. Vecna effortlessly extends his arms to turn their weapons against them, pushing fire back on the soldiers and pulling a pin on a grenade. He then levitates Will, and brings him to him, face to face. “Can you see them, William? Can you see the children?” he asks. “Do you know why I chose them to reshape the world? It’s because they are weak. Weak in body and mind.” He says this as the Demogorgons drag the kids Will and his friends had been trying to save into the Upside Down, where he’s already taken Holly Wheeler (Nell Fisher). Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) helplessly watches from the escape tunnel as one child is sucked into the Upside Down through a wall, and Robin sees that all the kids in the truck are gone.  \n\t\n\n\tVecna, taunting, calls the children “perfect vessels,” as he touches Will’s face almost gently. “And you, Will, you were the first,” he says. “And you broke so easily. You showed me what was possible, what I could achieve. Some minds, it turns out, simply do not belong in this world. They belong in mine.” He lets Will drop, and strides back into the Upside Down, confident that the Demogorgons will finish the job. But just as the massacre is set to recommence, Will remembers what Robin — to whom he’s felt bonded since realizing that she, too, is queer — had said to him earlier: that she’d always had all the answers within her, and she just needed to stop being scared of who she was Home movies begin to play in his mind. He remembers the first time he met Mike, who asked if he wanted to be friends; he remembers drawing things with crayons and showing them to a loving Joyce; he remembers building Castle Byers with Jonathan in woods near their home.  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNoah Schnapp and Jamie Campbell Bower\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt’s then that Will accesses the powers he (and we!) didn’t know he has, stopping each Demogorgon in place before they kill Mike, Lucas and Robin. Will can see through their eyes, he realizes, and — as indicated through arm gestures — he snaps the Demos’ limbs, killing all of them. The final image of Volume 1 is Will raising his head, and wiping his nosebleed with his sleeve, as we’ve seen Eleven do a thousand times on “Stranger Things” — as he stares with purpose into the distance.  \n\n\tIn a long interview with the Duffer brothers for Variety’s Oct. 15 cover story, Ross Duffer said, “We’ve been talking about Will having powers for as long as I can really remember.” \n\n\tBelow, the Duffers delve into what those powers are, the season’s opening flashback sequence, why the climax of “Sorcerer” (and that oner!) was “logistically the most difficult thing we ever did,” how they deployed Max, the return of Eight, the attack on the Wheeler house — and much, much more. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tWe have to start with Will. Will! Does he have Eleven’s powers? Or is it something different?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: It’s different in that he’s able to channel Vecna’s powers. But they’re all related. Vecna and Eleven, their powers are similar. The powers aren’t within him. He’s able to channel these powers from Vecna and use it, sort of puppeteering.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: He taps into the hive mind, and then he can manipulate anything within the hive. You’ll see how far he can take it as you continue to watch. But that’s how he’s able to manipulate the monster. So he can’t open a door, because the door is not part of the hive mind.\n\t\n\t\tIs this something that he always had that Vecna identified, or did he get it because Vecna grabbed him?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: He got it because he got hooked into the hive mind.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: If he’s not close to the hive mind, he’s not able to access or tap it.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: It’s proximity based.\n\t\n\t\tHad he not been taken to the Upside Down…\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Never would’ve happened. So it’s very different from Eleven in that regard.\n\t\n\t\tAnd how long have you known that this was something that Will had within him that you were going to build to?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: We’ve been talking about Will having powers for as long as I can really remember.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: He had a dark version of it in Season 2 — he was connected to Vecna. He could see what he saw, but he didn’t realize that at the time he was able to tap into it in a way and use it against Vecna. That’s something he doesn’t learn till this season. It took us a while to build there, but it was something we always intended to do. The details of it were a little rough until we started working on it.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNoah Schnapp and Maya Hawke \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat do you think came together for him after the gay pep talk from Robin and what Mike said to him about being a sorcerer? Do you have that thought out, or was it just a feeling?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: We knew we wanted him to access these powers this season. Then we began talking about why now, and why is he able to do it now. Some of it is mythology-based in terms of the hive mind’s closer than it’s ever been for him. But most of what we were talking about was how has Will changed. Throughout the seasons, he’s been a little more fearful than the others. He hasn’t been a leader. He hasn’t accepted himself in the way that some of our characters have. So I think it was really talking about if he really is able to at least start to accept himself for who he is, will that give him the kind of strength that he needs in order to access these powers? That’s really where Episode 4 — and really the arc of the first four episodes — led for him.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhy doesn’t Vecna kidnap or kill Will in that moment?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: You’ll see as it goes on, but he completely underestimates Will. He perceives him in the way that so many others have in his life, which is as weak, as nothing, as incapable of achieving anything great. So he completely underestimates him in that moment. Whether that’s going to happen again, you’ll have to watch Volume 2.\n\t\n\t\tThe home movie that goes through Will’s mind: How long were you planning to do that sequence?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: The original draft of Chapter 4 did not have the flashback footage in it. When we read it through, it’s the same exact storyline with Robin, but because it’s such an internal shift for Will, we needed to be able to show that visually. That’s when we came up with the idea of Robin mentioning that she’d found these old tapes. So that was the only different thing that we changed about her monologue, but it allowed us to visually represent what was going through Will’s mind. Once we did that, we felt like the ending finally had the emotional kick that we wanted.\n\t\n\t\tHow much work was it to find the super young Will, Mike and Jonathan?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I know we were really scared about whether we were going to be able to find someone or not. I mean, initially, obviously there were conversations about, Do we do face replacement? Do we do what we did with Will at the beginning of the season? Budgetarily, it was impossible. It’s just very expensive.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: The beginning scene he’s referencing, we were able to model it after Noah at that age, but this is even a younger age. So you start to get into uncanny valley world. It would’ve been extremely expensive, and also look creepy.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: It was really fun, too, to film that with those kids.\n\t\n\t\tSo let’s talk about that opening of the season. Did young Eleven in Season 4 give you the confidence to make young Will in that opening sequence for Season 5? How did you pull that off?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: We’re so proud of it. That’s all Weta. We’ve never worked with Weta before, but Betsy [Patterson], our visual effects supervisor, when she brought them on, she was confident that they would be able to do it. Usually when we’re writing this stuff, we don’t worry too much, sometimes to our detriment, about how we’re going to pull certain things off. It just felt absolutely right to start with a flashback of Will, and then you just turn to Betsy and then ultimately Weta to do it.\n\t\n\n\tWe did take a lot of learnings from the Eleven stuff last year, but this was more challenging, because we’ve all seen Will or Noah at this exact age before. We saw this scene, the very beginning of it, in Season 1. So it was very important that it was hyper-real. It’s the first visual effects work that was done on the show. They just did incredibly detailed work and then just kept honing and honing and honing. Sometimes you can’t figure out what’s wrong. You’re just like, “That’s not quite…” — usually it’s the lighting — and just work on every shot to death.\n\t\n\t\tHow long had you known that that had happened to Will in the Upside Down, that he and Vecna had actually crossed paths?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: That’s an idea we’ve had for a while. I can’t remember exactly when, but when we first had that thought, immediately we started talking about Season 5: “That’s where we have to start. We have to bring it back full circle.” It sets up the season the way we want it to, which is everything is going back to Season 1, and everything is coming full circle. We thought there wasn’t really a better way to do that than to go back and see what Will had experienced.\n\t\n\t\tIn some ways, Dustin seems like the only character who’s having a natural trauma response to everything they went through in Season 4. How’d you decide that he’s the one who’s going to be carrying this stuff for them?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Well, he was the closest to Eddie. So the two who are most impacted by the events of Season 4 would be him and Lucas. But at least Lucas is trying, desperately, to keep hope alive [about Max], because it hasn’t been extinguished at this point, although he’s sort of losing it when we see him at the top of Episode 1. But Dustin has lost Eddie, so he’s struggling to remain optimistic because of their friendship and because of what he feels is a need to continue carrying that torch. It felt like the most interesting way to explore grief was through him.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: When we talked about it with the writers, even in Season 1 when Mike and Lucas get in a fight, Dustin’s the one that pulls everything together. He in a lot of ways is the heart of that group. So it immediately puts all of our characters on edge, and the audience hopefully, too.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNell Fisher\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow long have you known that Holly Wheeler would be a major character this season?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: That was a new idea. We did not know until we started working on Season 5, probably pretty early in the process.\n\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: I don’t even think it was in the pandemic. Because we had so long [of a break] that we had time to not only finish [writing] Season 4, but pitch a version of Season 5. I don’t think she was even in that. That was the big breakthrough, having shot Season 4, coming back and realizing the drive of these kids getting taken. Once we realized that, we got really excited about making Holly the focus of that new group of kids.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you approach casting Holly Wheeler?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: If you watch the previous seasons, Holly barely talks at all. So we didn’t really have much of a character there. She was just a little kid. Even Season 1, when we’re filming her, it was basically whatever one of the young twins would do, we would just try to capture it in real time. So we didn’t really have a voice for her.In the initial scripts, Holly was a little shyer and a little more withdrawn. And then as we found Nell, who’s such a character…\n\n\tMatt Duffer: And more of an extrovert.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: …we started infusing Nell’s personality into Holly.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: We were really nervous about it. It is not like she had to look identical to the twins who were playing Holly in the past, but she had to resemble them enough that you weren’t totally confused. But more important than that, they have to be an incredible actor.\n\n\tI remember seeing the “Evil Dead Rise” trailer and seeing her. I had not seen the movie. I just saw her in the trailer and I was like, “That’s Holly.” But then I didn’t remember that. [Our casting director] Carmen [Cuba] found her, brought her to us, and I was like, “I knew this like six months ago.” That would’ve saved us a lot of time.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Carmen’s going to get annoyed you’re taking credit for this.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: She always thinks I take too much credit for the casting.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNell Fisher and Cara Buono \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of the Wheelers, with the mauling of Karen and Ted in Episode 2, when they’re trying to protect Holly, how did you decide to bring these characters to the front who have been just around since moment one, but have been oblivious?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Oblivious! One of the early ideas was we finally had to bring them into the fold. It was easy, because we could bring anybody in the fold. It was the final season. Karen would’ve moved them out of Hawkins, had she learned any of this earlier. Finally, none of that mattered.\n\t\n\n\tWe’ve always wanted an attack on the Wheeler house, and to give Karen a killer badass moment, have her face down one of these monsters. Cara and Nell bonded. They got really close, and we just had an incredibly fun time shooting what is a very violent sequence. And yeah, Karen’s tough. She miraculously survives.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you decide when and how to reveal where Max is, and what’s going on with her?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: We knew we wanted to keep her out of it for the first couple episodes, and we knew she was going to end an episode. At some point, we thought Episode 3 felt like the right time.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: From the end of Season 4 when we kept her in the coma, we knew she was trapped in Vecna’s mindscape, and we knew that was going to be part of her journey, at least for Season 5. But it finally clicked when we realized that Holly could be there as well, and then the other kids. That’s when her storyline really came to life.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I can’t tell you how many hours are spent in the writers’ room discussing the movie “The Cell,” the Jennifer Lopez/Tarsem movie. It’s such a great concept, because they enter the mind of a serial killer. It was the closest thing we could think of that parallels what we were doing. Our serial killer mindscape ends up being pretty different, but it’s probably why we ended up having a desert in there. A lot of desert sequences in “The Cell.”\n\t\n\t\tSo Vecna’s mindscape is that in-between world?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Yeah. Holly’s nicknamed it Camazotz.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: The boys are always referencing Dungeons & Dragons, and Holly doesn’t play Dungeons & Dragons, so we thought it’d be interesting if she’s referencing something she’s into.\n\t\n\t\tThe wall: Do we find out what created it?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: You find out pretty much everything, is what I’ll say.I mean, there are still some mysteries. We don’t explain everything, but the wall, certainly, you understand.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLinnea Berthelsen and Millie Bobby Brown in Season 2 of “Stranger Things”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe reveal that Eight (Linnea Berthelsen) has been kept captive by the military was a big surprise, in part because you were bringing back a storyline that seemed to have been dropped and set on fire and run away from. What was your thinking there?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Yeah, that’s two-fold. We want when someone watches through the entire show, it doesn’t feel like we dropped a storyline or a thread. That it all connects. You see how everything fits together. And that was definitely a loose plot strand.\n\t\n\n\tBut also, we really like Linnea and we felt that that episode [in Season 2] just didn’t give her a chance to do what we know she’s capable of doing. So part of it was to put her back in and give her a moment. But we didn’t want to just do it to do it. As we were breaking the season, we realized that bringing her back really helped us with the Eleven storyline and how we wanted to wrap her story up. So there was a real reason to do it beyond just to not leave this dangling plot thread. \n\n\tMatt Duffer: We were shooting Season 2 really, really fast, because we were trying to hit this Halloween deadline. And the first script we wrote just flat out didn’t work, and then we had one week left to rewrite. I just don’t think we ever nailed it, obviously. I always felt bad that we didn’t figure that out for Linnea. But we felt we had something special with Linnea, so we wanted to bring her back. I think she’s awesome in the season, so I’m pretty excited about that. \n\t\n\t\tThe long battle sequence at the end of Episode 4: How long did it take to plan the extended oner shot in the battle?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Forever. It wasn’t originally written that way. We wanted it to feel very immersive, like you were in the middle of it. Ross and I hadn’t done anything like that before. The finale’s insane, but that sequence was logistically the most difficult thing we ever did.\n\t\n\t\tThe whole battle?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: The whole battle, but specifically that oner, because it involved obviously a lot of stunts and visual effects and actors, but then also children. It is stitched together [from several shots]. I don’t want people to get mad at us when we call it a “oner,” because it’s at night and you’re working with children and stunts. We could only shoot about two hours a night. So we divided it up into, I think, four chunks, and we thought we could accomplish within the time that we had one chunk per night.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: It was definitely the hardest thing we’ve ever done ever in terms of filmmaking.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFinn Wolfhard\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX © 2025\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tNo one dies in Volume 1, not even Ted and Karen, who seemed like goners for a second there. Did you contemplate having any kind of big death in this part of the season?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Once we decided we knew we wanted to do the Will power stuff this season, we knew that that’s how we had to end Volume 1. So there’s the low point of all the kids being taken, but the high point of Will has these powers. That was always the discussion. Vecna taking these children was the low point we needed for the end of Volume 1.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWill Volume 2 get bloodier?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I’ve said this before: The show is not “Game of Thrones.” I’m hoping it surprises people. But there’s no Red Wedding, if that’s what you’re asking. That would be depressing.\n\t\n\t\tWhen Will gets that image of the temple that Vecna doesn’t want him to see, he sees Holly trapped inside that structure. Is that where Holly is actually physically located in that moment, or is he seeing something in the future?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Do we answer this?\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I think this is OK.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Yes. That’s where Holly is at the present moment.\n\t\n\t\tVecna gets a real glow up.\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: That’s one way to put it!\n\t\n\t\tWell, he’s looking good after almost being killed at the end of Season 4. Will we find out where he went after that?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Yeah, there’s a backstory to all of that that is actually never revealed in the show. The idea of it was based a little bit on the original “Hellraiser,” although it’s different than that. But yeah, he retreated to lick his wounds. Nancy blew holes all through his body, so he more or less rebuilt his body into something stronger and hopefully cooler. But it was a challenge because we also wanted his new design to reflect the fact that he had been injured. That’s why we ultimately had to go full CG on his body was because you see holes throughout his body. It was figuring out that balance took a long time.\n\t\n\t\tSo Jamie Campbell Bower is in a motion-capture suit?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: He was just in a leotard, basically. But the important thing is they match his movement. And his face is completely him in makeup. We don’t touch that at all. That’s fully Jamie.\n\t\n\t\tDo we know yet what Vecna wants?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: No.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Nothing good.\n\t\n\t\tHe says that the kids are the way he’s going to remake the world.\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Right. What does that mean?\n\t\n\t\tIt’s safe to assume it’s not a nice world that he wants.\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I mean, depends on your perspective, you know?\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSadie Sink and Caleb McLaughlin \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWill we be seeing more of Vecna’s memories in Volume 2?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Yes, that’s what we call our new Russia storyline, because it’s very few characters. They’re kind of isolated off on their own, Max and Holly. We’re very happy with how it integrates with the other storylines.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow much of all of that is real vs. a set?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: The forest is real.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: And the desert’s real. We went out to New Mexico to shoot any of the desert sequences. You’ll see more of them. The inside of the interior of the cave is a set build. That main outside of the cave is a set build right outside the forest. And the forest is the summertime set. That’s why we had to shoot some finale there when the leaves were green.\n\t\n\t\tIn “The First Shadow,” the prequel play that’s on Broadway and in the West End, there’s a reference to a cave in Nevada near an army base where a young Henry Creel first encountered something connected to the Upside Down. Is that the same cave?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Yeah. When we were working on the play with Kate Trefry, we had Henry’s backstory worked out. There was always a balance that we had to find in terms of how much we were going to put in the play. [The director] Stephen [Daldry] and [the produce] Sonia [Friedman] were always pushing for more and we were pushing back and saying, “Well, we have to wait to reveal that in the show.” You’ll see, especially as you reach the final episode, there’s more overlap with the play.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: And, like, Max finds that “Oklahoma” poster, which people who haven’t seen the play are maybe like, “Why is Henry in ‘Oklahoma’?” But I think it’s nice for us to start to tie those two together.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: But you absolutely do not have to have seen the play to understand. They’re Easter eggs more than anything.\n\t\n\t\tFinally — and you may not want to touch this, so just going dive in — in the play, it felt like the real evil is the Mind Flayer. It’s what seduces Henry to accept what’s in the Upside Down into himself and ultimately what seems to have transformed him into Vecna once Eleven pushes him into the Upside Down. Are we barking up the right tree here?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: You’re asking a question that will be answered in the final episode. The next spoiler talk we do, I’ll address it.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt one of the most heavily attended talks of the Doha Film Festival, Arab-American comedians Ramy Youssef and Mo Amer laid out a vision for a new era of Arab storytelling, calling on regional investors and emerging filmmakers to back original narratives and expand the creative pipeline. Appearing in a conversation moderated by MS NOW (formerly MSNBC) anchor Ayman Mohyeldin, the duo urged creators to lean into narratives rooted in their own experiences and cultural specificity rather than replicating Western formulas.\n\t\n\n\t“The world is not interested in seeing the Arab version of ‘Everybody Loves Raymond,’” Youssef said. “They want to see something they’ve never seen before. They want to hear from us.”\n\n\n\tThat idea grounded a wide-ranging discussion that positioned Arab creators not as outsiders seeking validation in Western markets, but as artists working at a moment of rare opportunity. With new tax incentives, fast-developing production hubs, and a growing base of filmmakers trained both locally and abroad, Youssef and Amer argued that the region is increasingly positioned to produce work that can compete on the global stage, provided funding and infrastructure keep pace with the creative ambition.\n\n\tAmer, whose self-titled Netflix series “Mo” broke ground with its Palestinian-American lead, played by himself, and Houston setting, said conditions for telling these stories have shifted substantially. “We’ve never had this level of clarity around our stories,” he said. “The burden of explaining who we are before telling the story, that’s fading.”\n\t\n\n\tStill, both emphasized that representation can’t dictate creative choices. Amer noted that Arab artists often feel pulled between the expectations of multiple communities, be it Palestinian, American, Arab, Muslim, a dynamic he insists must be resisted. “You’re never going to make everybody happy,” he said. “What I care about is: does this do justice to the story? Is it right for the character? That’s what stands the test of time.”\n\n\tYoussef echoed the point, framing their shared approach as long-term storytelling designed for longevity instead of chasing whatever conversations happen to dominate the moment. “People see what they want to see,” he said. “Focusing on that will paralyze you. Our job is to make the best work we can and let the art handle the rest.”\n\n\tA significant portion of the conversation focused on the structural support the region must build to sustain its own creative surge. Both artists stressed that the development of producers, showrunners, and directors is just as essential as amplifying on-screen talent. For Amer, that begins with decisive backing. “Identifying great talent and not hesitating to invest in them, that’s everything,” he said. “Be the wind in their back. Don’t be the wind in their face. Great art will rise if it’s given the chance.”\n\n\tThe conversation unfolded during the inaugural edition of the festival, spearheaded by the Doha Film Institute, which launched with a clear mandate to position Doha as a new gathering point for regional and international talent. Even in its debut year, the event introduced industry programming, co-production conversations, and networking platforms designed to reinforce a creative and financing ecosystem for Gulf and Arab storytellers.\n\n\tYoussef encouraged regional financiers to be active partners, not silent funders. “There’s a lot more value to you than just your money,” he told the crowd of industry attendees. “Your point of view, your values, that’s what the world needs. Don’t be shy about putting that on the table.”\n\n\tMentorship, the duo agreed, is central to sustainable growth. Youssef noted that both of his shows have promoted assistants into writers and, eventually, creators. “If we’re hiring someone to be a production assistant, you want to see something in them that makes you think they might someday direct a movie,” he said. Amer, meanwhile, credited his stand-up mentor Danny Martinez with mapping out his career when he was 17. “He told me it would take 20 years for overnight success. That long-term commitment, that’s what we have to build here.”\n\t\n\n\tThe pair also addressed Hollywood’s long history of flattening or vilifying Arab and Muslim identities. Amer pointed to the documentary “Reel Bad Arabs,” which catalogs decades of stereotypical depictions, as a reminder of how deep the pattern runs. But he stressed that the most effective response isn’t critique alone, but output. “We just need more,” he said. “We need to be very aggressive in the way we tell stories … whether it be in film, in television, cartoons, shadow puppetry, I don’t care what it is. We have to do as much as possible to counteract everything that’s happened in the last 100 years of how we’ve been depicted in the West.”\n\n\tIn the end, their message to emerging filmmakers was clear and urgent. As Youssef put it: “Eliminate the question of ‘can I?’ and just do it. The guardrails are gone.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“South Park” Season 28 delivered a Thanksgiving special on Wednesday, which saw the citizens of the Colorado mountain town running in the annual Turkey Trot while United States Secretary of War Pete Hegseth tried to bust Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel out of jail.\n\n\tThe episode opens with the South Park City Council debating who should sponsor the Thanksgiving 5K. Many of the town’s citizens fell on hard times in recent months, meaning local businesses and former sponsors can’t find the funds. However, there is one foreign entity that is flush with cash and eager to spend.\n\t\n\n\tThe show then cuts to a live-action commercial for the annual South Park Turkey Trot featuring the sponsor for 2025: Saudi Arabia. The ad sets this year’s top prize at a whopping $5,000, but it also makes sure to mention that “disparaging remarks towards the Saudi Royal family are strictly prohibited.”\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, at the Park County Police Station, Sergeant Yates gets an unexpected visit from Hegseth, who demands they release Thiel from custody.\n\n\tIn grandiose fashion, Hegeth rappels from the roof into the station. Flanked by two National Guard soldiers live-streaming on their phones, he tells his viewers, “Hey, what’s up, guys? This is Pete Hegseth with the Department of War! We’re here to infiltrate this police station and extract a P.O.I. ’cause that’s what we do!”\n\n\tDespite his efforts to intimidate Sergeant Yates, he easily kicks Hegseth out, denying his request to release Thiel. \n\n\tTrey Parker and Matt Stone brought the show back to more typical “South Park” antics this week after primarily focusing on Donald Trump-centric storylines in previous episodes. Parker and Stone have put the president in some seriously compromising positions throughout Seasons 27 and 28, including in bed with Satan and Vice President JD Vance. In the Season 27 Premiere, they deepfaked Trump into a political PSA which boasted about his “teeny-tiny” manhood.\n\t\n\n\tWhile shows like “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” have caught heat from Trump for far less, “South Park” has largely avoided the president’s crosshairs. During a recent appearance on The Daily Beast’s “Last Laugh” podcast, comedian Patton Oswald said Trump respects the success of “South Park,” and that’s why he hasn’t brought the hammer down.\n\n\t“‘South Park,’ not only does it make insane amount of some money, it gets insane ratings,” Oswald said. “And Trump can only be so angry at that, because what Trump ultimately will respect, even if it doesn’t respect him, is something where the numbers are through the roof, and the money is through the roof. He can’t look at ‘South Park’ and see how brilliant it is, and he can’t look at something like John Oliver and see how equally brilliant it is. All he can think of in terms of, look at this guy’s numbers, look at their numbers, and that’s the only way he sees the world.”\n",

Spooning and reverse cowgirl are just a couple of the fun positions couples can try out after gorging on turkey, the doctor says.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          She also gives alternatives to lovers who eat until their stuffed like a turkey -- recommending those people have sex before the meal, or get in a quickie as dinner is being prepared. She also suggests waiting till after you've digested everything the next morning.\n      \n\n          Dr. Berman also notes it's no secret turkey contains tryptophan, which the body converts into serotonin and makes you sleepy, calling it \"nature's chill pill.\" This may not make couples feel energetic to have sex, Berman says, but she has the anecdote for that.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          Berman says people can eat earlier on Thanksgiving to give more time for digestion, or take a walk to burn calories after they've put down their forks. And she offers lots more advice on how couples can bang their way through the Thanksgiving holiday.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Thanksgiving\n              \n                          \n                Interview\n              \n                          \n                Sex\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\t“Stranger Things” Season 5 had a record-breaking debut on Netflix.\n\n\tIn its first five days of streaming, the season achieved 59.6 million views. That’s the best premiere-week viewership an English-language Netflix series has ever achieved, and the third-best overall, coming behind only Seasons 2 and 3 of the Korean sci-fi series “Squid Game.”\n\n\tThis also marks a massive increase from the already sizable premiere viewership of “Stranger Things” Season 4. In 2022, the series opened with 287 million hours watched — back then, Netflix ranked viewership by stream time instead of views — which translates to about 22 million views. Therefore, Season 5’s debut represents an increase of about 171%, though it should be noted that that Season 5 had five days to rack up views, while the Season 4 tally was counted over three days.\n\t\n\n\tDespite that the season just premiered, this is already the second viewership record brought about by Season 5. Last week, as anticipation built around the new release, all four previous seasons of “Stranger Things” made the Netflix Top 10 — the first time any series has had four different seasons on the chart.\n\n\n\tMore to come…\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\t“Vanderpump Rules” fans will officially be introduced to a new crew of SUR staffers on Tuesday night.\n\n\tBravo‘s Emmy-winning reality show returns for its 12th season on Dec. 2 at 9 p.m. ET. The best way for cable-cutters to tune into the premiere is on Sling TV, whose Sling Blue package includes access to Bravo. The best offer, though, is on the Sling Orange + Blue package, currently half off for the first month. \n\n\n\tBravo announced that the show would be entirely recast for the new season following a scandal-ridden Season 10 that left much of the original cast divided. When the cast convened to film Season 11, Ariana Madix and Tom Sandoval, who had broken up after Madix had discovered his affair with fellow cast member Rachel Leviss, were largely not able to film together because Madix absolutely despised Sandoval. She drew a strict boundary between them that was healthy for her, but proved untenable for “Vanderpump Rules,” which requires togetherness among the cast.\n\t\n\n\tThe new cast of “Vanderpump Rules” will comprise staffers in executive producer Lisa Vanderpump’s existing restaurants, which is how the original show began in 2013 when it was an offshoot of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” According to Bravo’s official announcement, “Under Lisa Vanderpump’s watchful eye, the West Hollywood mainstay SUR — and now TomTom — welcomes the next batch of servers, hosts and bartenders rife with plenty of drama, situationships and frenemies.” \n\n\t“This season on ‘Vanderpump Rules,’” reads the official logline from Season 12, “the deep-rooted, dynamic group of friends, frenemies and lovers that have been working for Lisa Vanderpump at SUR for years are shaking things up – from pump-tinis to chaos. Despite new uniforms and a few fresh faces in the mix, the drama remains as messy and complicated as their iconic predecessors.”\n\t\n\n\tStream “Vanderpump Rules” Season 12 on Sling TV below:\n",

    "body": "\n\tRegé-Jean Page is returning to Netflix, with the “Bridgerton” alum set to headline the erotic thriller series “Hancock Park.” The project is currently in development. \n\n\tThe logline for the show states that it follows “a dangerously charismatic outsider (Page), who invades the lives of a seemingly picture-perfect Los Angeles family — when he rents their backyard guest house. But as he dives further into their world, the façade of this elite community begins to crumble, and he exposes the desire, deceit, and obsession that lurks around every corner of one of LA’s most-coveted neighborhoods.”\n\t\n\n\tPage is executive producing the show under his A Mighty Stranger banner in addition to starring. Matthew Barry is writing the series, with A Mighty Stranger’s Emily Brown also executive producing alongside Drew Comins of Creative Engine Entertainment. Fifth Season will produce. \n\n\n\tPage broke out with his starring role in the first season of “Bridgerton,” which catapulted him to global fame as the show proved to be one of the most popular in Netflix’s histry. He has since starred in movies like the Netflix feature “The Gray Man”, “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” and “Black Bag.” \n\n\tHe is repped by UTA, Brillstein, Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole, and Shelter PR.\n\n\tBarry previously wrote for the Netflix series “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,” as well as for the hit HBO finance drama “Industry.” He most recently created the BBC series “The Guest” and has worked on shows like “EastEnders,” “Casualty,” and “Death in Paradise.” \n\n\tHe is repped by WME and The Agency. \n",

The nine shows are set for April 16-18, April 23-25 and April 30-May 2, 2026. A “ticket request period” is already underway at tickets.phish.com and will continue through the morning of Dec. 8. Remaining tickets will go on sale to the general public on Dec. 12, at 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET.\n\n\tBut for anyone who wants to get a jump even on the aforementioned on-sale dates, and could use a place to crash, limited travel packages — which include a hotel stay as well as tickets — will go on sale on Wednesday of this week at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET, only via https://phishatsphere.100xhospitality.com/. \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPhish’s previous run at Sphere in April 2024 lasted for only four nights. Each show was unique, both set-wise and visuals-wise, making each gig a FOMO experience. No word for now on whether, by expanding the run of shows to nine this time, they will still be as one-of-a-kind in the visuals, although Phish fans know to expect unique setlists whatever the setting. Publicity material for the 2026 run does boast that, in the first mini-residency, “the inventive animations and graphics were executed, modified, and manipulated in real time.”\n\t\n\n\tThe full rundown of ticket information and on-sale times for the shows can be found at phish.com/tours.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tDrag superstars The Boulet Brothers are getting ready to spook the holiday season. \n\n\t“The Boulet Brothers’ Holiday of Horrors,” their new anthology of four original shorts, will premiere on Shudder on Dec. 16. Directors include The Boulet Brothers, David Dastmalchian, Akela Cooper and Kate Siegel.\n\n\tThe Boulet Brothers’ “Gaudete” sees a family try to settle their grandmother’s inheritance in her home on Christmas Eve, only to find the house haunted and filled with secrets. Dastmalchian’s “Yeti or Not” tells the story of three friends who go looking for their sister in the woods, just to find something monstrous hidden in the snowy forest. Cooper’s “Old Acquaintance” takes the audience to New Year’s Eve, where a young woman inherits the demon of her recently deceased father. Finally, Siegel’s “Down the Chimney” takes a morbid twist on Santa Claus. \n\t\n\n\tThe casts include Bonnie Aarons, Aaron Abrams, Briana Venskus and Eloisa Huggins in “Gaudete,” Dastmalchian, Lauren LaVera, Jennifer Polania, Leah Kilpatrick and Natasha Preston in “Yeti or Not,” Tracie Thoms, Tiffany Smith, Charles Murray and Abhora in “Old Acquaintance” and Dominic Hure, Theodora Flanagan and Cody Flanagan in “Down the Chimney.”\n\n\n\tThe Boulet Brothers serve as executive producers of the project alongside Dastmalchian. “This project has been such a joy to build alongside our dear friend David and the remarkable team of filmmakers involved,” the Boulets said in a statement. “The anthology showcases four distinct visions of holiday horror and creating our own short within it gave us the chance to finally reveal the kind of scripted genre storytelling that’s closest to our hearts— moody, vicious and hauntingly beautiful. We’re thrilled for audiences to experience the entire collection and especially the dark little nightmare we’ve contributed to it.”\n\t\n\n\tDastmalchian added, “There is something inherently haunting and haunted about the holiday season. Dickens knew it. And now I get to team up with my favorite fiends, The Boulet Brothers and a host of talented creative creatures as we twist and terrorize the holiday season into something fun and fearsome. Move aside, ‘It’s a Wonderful Life,’ there’s a new holiday tradition coming to town!”\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “The Boulet Brothers’ Holiday of Horrors” below.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount Global alum Jeff Shultz is taking the helm of Radial Entertainment, the recently formed entertainment company encompassing FilmRise and Shout! Studios, as CEO.\n\n\tShultz most recently was chief strategy officer and chief business development officer of Paramount Streaming, where he oversaw strategy, distribution and business development for both Paramount+ and Pluto TV. He exited the company at the end of 2024.\n\n\n\tShultz starts as CEO of Radial Entertainment effective Jan. 1, 2026. In the CEO role, he succeeds Garson Foos, the co-founder of Shout! Studios who is becoming executive chairman of Radial Entertainment alongside Danny Fisher, co-founder of FilmRise.\n\t\n\n\tRadial Entertainment was formed this summer, backed by funds managed by investment firm Oaktree Capital Management, after Oaktree acquired streaming content distributor FilmRise and merged it with existing portfolio company Shout! Studios. The merged company has a catalog of more than 70,000 movies and TV episodes, including such franchises as “Unsolved Mysteries,” “Forensic Files,” “Hell’s Kitchen,” “Mystery Science Theater 3000,” and films from the Open Road, Millennium and Sonar libraries. \n\n\tAbout the CEO transition, Jared Frandle, managing director for Oaktree’s special situations strategy, said in a statement, “We are extremely grateful for all of Garson’s efforts in guiding us through the seamless transition of this exciting merger. His leadership from the very beginning of our partnership with Shout and through this pivotal period laid a strong foundation for Radial’s future growth. We are now thrilled to welcome Jeff — a highly seasoned veteran of the streaming industry and a uniquely qualified media executive — to lead Radial into this next chapter.”\n\t\n\n\tShultz joined Pluto TV, the free, ad-supported streaming TV start-up, as chief business officer in early 2018, after serving as an adviser to the company for three years. A year later, Viacom acquired the free, ad-supported streaming startup for $340 million. At Paramount, he was a key member of the executive team that launched Paramount+. Prior to Pluto TV, Shultz held senior leadership roles in digital business development at media companies including NBC and CBS and internet TV start-ups Clicker and Concert TV, which he co-founded.\n\n\tShultz said in a statement: “I’m fortunate to inherit an exceptional team and the legacy of two highly successful brands. I am fully aligned with Garson, Danny and the Oaktree team on a shared vision to build Radial into one of the most valuable independent players in the global streaming market.” He said Radial, with Shout! and FilmRise under one umbrella, “is uniquely positioned to capture the massive opportunity in the rapidly evolving media market, leveraging its financial scale, vast and compelling catalog, and expansive and diversified distribution, all amplified by Oaktree’s support.”\n\n\tRadial’s executive chairmen Foos and Fisher, in a joint statement, said about Shultz, “Jeff brings extraordinary expertise as an industry leader. He has great expertise in the free-streaming market and a proven builder of high-growth businesses, having led Pluto TV and Paramount Streaming through periods of remarkable expansion.”\n\n\tSince its formation, Radial has inked several strategic deals including acquiring Conan O’Brien’s Emmy-winning late-night talk show “Conan” and horror series “Hemlock Grove” and securing two new true-crime co-production deals, “Murder in Mind” and “Pushed to Death.” It also launched the Hong Kong Fight Club FAST channel and added the Golden Princess film library to its global distribution slate.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFinding the ideal artist to reopen the historic Plaza Theatre in Palm Springs might have seemed like a tall order, at least if the 89-year-old venue’s new operators wanted to touch every possible important base for a refurbishment-celebrating gala. Someone whose concert repertoire touches on vast decades of musical and show-biz history, but who also happens to be utterly and unmistakably of the moment? An acclaimed classicist of sorts, and, by the way, a current superstar? There is really only one needle in that haystack, and they got her: Cynthia Erivo.\n\t\n\n\tThe Plaza officially reopened Monday night after a two-year, $34 million renovation with a concert that was as spectacular as it needed to be, given the sense of occasion, and also was as intimate as it needed to be, given that the theater is not a monstrous venue, at a modest 700 seats. Erivo’s performance more than fit all those bills, with the “Wicked” singer-actress getting in plenty of time with the full brassiness of the 20-piece-plus Palm Springs Pops Orchestra but also doing numbers that stripped things down to a four-piece jazz combo or even just piano accompaniment. It was a show that felt epic or quietly in-your-face from moment to moment… not totally unlike the Plaza itself, a 1936 atmospheric gem that skirts the line between neighborhood theater and movie palace.\n\n\n\tAs gala as the evening was advertised and turned out to be, Erivo noted that there were some moments in the last week when she thought the show might not go on.\n\n\t“It has been a year,” Erivo told the crowd after opening the show with the promissory “I Put a Spell on You.” “It has been busy, and it has been eventful, and it has been wonderful, and it has been crazy. And then it got a little scary a couple weeks ago when I lost my voice. And so when that happened, I kept thinking, oh my God, I really want to come here and sing to you. About three days ago, I then had to open up the Thanksgiving Day parade. But the day before that, my voice was not back.”\n\t\n\n\tEven post-Thanksgiving, she was struggling. “This is why I believe that miracles happen,” she continued, offering some thoughts on the inevitability of things that were meant to be. “We were here yesterday. We were rehearsing, and I really wasn’t sure that I could do the things that I wanted to do with some of these songs, and…” A beat. “The sun came out, and I could sing.” \n\n\tThe theme of thanksgiving, with a small T, was the key. “I want us to have a really good night tonight. And it takes you losing something to know how much it means to you… And I’ve always known, but I really understood, what it means for me to be able to sing to you.” She continued, “I want us to have a really, really good night (as) we celebrate reopening this place, a place where art can exist, where you get to sit under the stars, and I get to sing to you.”\n\n\t(The “under the stars” part referred to the design, an atmospheric theater in the ’20s/’30s style meant to represent an open courtyard, with representations of small buildings along the left and right walls and stars built into the ceiling, like a smaller version of the Arlington in Santa Barbara or the Avalon on Catalina, to name the two nearest comparable examples.)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCynthia Erivo performs at The Plaza Theatre on December 1, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTara Howard\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrom every possible indication, Erivo was able to “do the things that I wanted to do” with her material, which ranged from old-school standards like “At Last” and “Feeling Good” to pop and soul classics of the ’60s and ’70s like “Natural Woman” and “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face” to Prince and/or Sinead O’Connor’s “Nothing Compares 2 U.” Erivo’s concerts, of which there were only a handful this past summer, generally do not include material from either her solo albums of original songs (including the excellent one she put out in 2025, “I Forgive You”) or “Wicked.” \n\n\tBut the elephant in the room was recognized at the very end when, for an encore, Erivo did a medley that she may have only done once before (according to setlists.fm): a lyrical cover of John Lennon’s “Imagine” that led, ever so tenderly and tentatively, into… could it be, from those transitory notes?… yes, it could… the softest and sweetest “Defying Gravity” ever. Anyone attending Erivo shows in the future should by no means take it as a guarantee that that will again make it into the set, but for the thundrously appreciative Plaza crowd, at least, she was willing to go there with her cinematic signature song, for a couple of warm, un-airborn, down-to-earth minutes at the close.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt would be tough to say that this “oh, by the way” partial rendering of “Defying Gravity” was not a highlight, but that deliriously subdued feel-good denouement had a lot of competition from the succession of high points that peppered her two-and-a-half-hour (including intermission) performance. \n\n\tAmong the exquisite moments were an Act 2-opening rendering of Blood, Sweat & Tears’ pre-David Clayton Thomas ballad “I’ll Love You More Than You Ever Know” that could just about count as that classic’s definitive spin, and a “First Time Ever” that could be said to give Roberta Flack a run for her money, if to say that would not be committing heresy. \n\n\tIronically, for someone known for participating in flying effects on the big screen, what happens when Erivo is truly unharnessed is that she can’t help herself from getting as low as possible. That’s in her vocals, occasionally — she likes to surprise people waiting for her to hit even higher notes by playfully seeing how low she can go, every once in a while — but also quite literally in her physicality. Crouching almost seems to be her natural performing state, as if she were stalking the melodies she commands and consumes. Kneeling on the left side of the stage, sitting cross-legged on the right, it didn’t matter…\n\n\tPromising early in the show that she would be not on “good behavior,” Erivo vowed: “I’ll be on the floor many times. I’ll be crawling sometimes. … I have no shame.” She made good on all that, although she was also buoyant enough to take a trip up and down both the theater’s aisles for “Natural Woman.”\n\n\tThe combination of the Palm Springs Pops Orchestra, conducted by Anthony Parnther, and the jazz combo, led by music director Mark Meadows, made for wonderful dynamics: a full, vintage Las Vegas showroom extravaganza at times, an after-hours club in others. \n\n\tAnd it is not to say these two dozen or so musicians did not fully impress or earn their keep, but it’s worth noting that they all had a lot of moments to rest and relax during the set. That’s because Erivo is given to extended a cappella trills, especially at the beginning or ending of a song, that are at least as magical as anything that is formally happening with the full ensemble. (Parnther glancing over his shoulder, smiling, as he looked to see whether Erivo might indeed be wrapping things up — but probably in no hurry himself to conduct a downbeat — became an almost comical sight.) To wrap up “Feeling Good,” before the final riffs resumed, Erivo vamped for a full minute and 40 seconds (but who’s counting?). That improv was truly the song title made flesh.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCynthia Erivo performs at The Plaza Theatre on December 1, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTara Howard\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut there was nothing as spontaneously magnificent as the wildly extended improvisation that went down later, in the second act. Erivo was premiering her interpretation of a neo-soul number from 2019, Mykal Kilmore’s “Let Me Go,” saying, “I’ve always wanted to do it for an audience. And so, I decided that you would be my guinea pigs.” The straightforward reading of the song was strong enough (and a nice detour into the relatively obscure amid a night of otherwise pretty recognizable material). But then something happened that you could fairly describe as, well, witchy: Rather that stop the tune at its natural conclusion, Erivo let the orchestra slip away and went into an improvisation with her MD and pianist, Meadows, that lasted for 11 incantatory minutes. This may have been a very formal occasion with a very formal purpose, but for those 11 minutes, she was very much going somewhere else, and taking the enthralled Plaza patrons with her.\n\n\tJust looking at her tatted-up appearance, it’s easy to know Erivo is a one-of-one, especially as performers who lean toward the cabaret style go. But her singularity really became apparent when, in a night very much devoted to crowd-pleasing, Erivo took some time to please her own innermost muse, trusting that the crowd that had paid four figures each to attend would go along for the detour. Everyone did, delightedly, and it felt as physics-defying as anything she’s done on screen.\n\n\tCynthia Erivo setlist at the Plaza Theatre, Palm Springs, Dec. 1, 2025:\n\n\tSet 1I Put a Spell on YouDon’t Let Me Be MisunderstoodAin’t No WayWhyA Song for YouFeeling Good\n\n\tSet 2I Love You More Than You’ll Ever KnowThe First Time Ever I Saw Your FaceAt Last(You Make Me Feel Like a) Natural WomanLet Me Go/improvisationNothing Compares 2 U\n\n\tEncoreImagine/Defying Gravity\n",

    "body": "\n\tQuentin Tarantino has named Ridley Scott’s “Black Hawk Down” the best movie of the 21st century, saying Scott’s “feat of direction is beyond extraordinary.” The Oscar-winning filmmaker revealed his top 10 picks during an interview on “The Bret Easton Ellis” podcast (via World of Reel).\n\n\tThe list also features Lee Unkrich’s “Toy Story 3” (#2), Sofia Coppola’s “Lost in Translation” (#3), Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk” (#4), Paul Thomas Anderson’s “There Will Be Blood” (#5), David Fincher’s “Zodiac” (#6), Tony Scott’s “Unstoppable” (#7), George Miller’s “Mad Max: Fury Road” (#8), Edgar Wright’s “Shaun of the Dead” (#9) and Woody Allen’s “Midnight in Paris” (#10).\n\t\n\n\t“I liked it when I first saw it, but I actually think it was so intense that it stopped working for me, and I didn’t carry it with me the way that I should’ve,” Tarantino said about selecting “Black Hawk Down” as his top pick. “Since then, I’ve seen it a couple of times, not a bunch of times, but I think it’s a masterwork, and one of the things I love so much about it is […] this is the only movie that actually goes completely for an ‘Apocalypse Now’ sense of purpose and visual effect and feeling, and I think it achieves it. It keeps up the intensity for 2 hours 45 minutes, or whatever it is, and I watched it again recently, my heart was going through the entire runtime of the movie; it had me and never let me go, and I hadn’t seen it in a while. The feat of direction is beyond extraordinary.”\n\n\n\tTarantino called his second place pick, “Toy Story 3,” an “almost perfect movie,” adding: “That last five minutes ripped my fucking heart out, and if I even try to describe the end, I’ll start crying and get choked up […] It’s just remarkable.”\n\t\n\n\tIn a more surprising reveal, Tarantino said that he did not actually like Nolan’s “Dunkirk” when he first saw it. The movies is now his fourth favorite of the century.\n\n\t“What I now love about it is that I feel there’s a real mastery to it, and I came around to it watching it again and again and again,” he said. “The first time, it’s not like it left me cold — it was so kind of gobsmacking, I didn’t really know what I saw, it was almost too much, and then the second time I saw it, my brain was able to take it in a little bit more, and then the third time and the fourth time, it was just like, wow, it just blew me away.”\n\n\tTarantino previously unveiled his #11 to 20 picks, which included the following films: Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” (#20), Eli Roth’s “Cabin Fever” (#19), Bennett Miller’s “Moneyball” (#18), Prachya Pinkaew’s “Chocolate” (#17), Rob Zombie’s “The Devil’s Rejects” (#16), Mel Gibson’s “The Passion of the Christ” (#15), Richard Linklater’s “School of Rock” (#14), Jeff Tremaine’s “Jackass: The Movie” (#13), Aharon Keshales and Navot Papushado’s “Big Bad Wolves” (#12) and Kinji Fukasaku’s “Battle Royale” (#11).\n\n\tDuring this portion of “The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast,” Tarantino went viral for noting the similarities between his #11 pick, “Battle Royale,” and “The Hunger Games” franchise.\n\n\t“I do not understand how the Japanese writer didn’t sue Suzanne Collins for every fucking thing she owns,” Tarantino said. “They just ripped off the fucking book! Stupid book critics are not going to go watch a Japanese movie called ‘Battle Royale,’ so the stupid book critics never called her out on it. They talked about how it was the most original thing they’d ever fucking read. As soon as the film critics saw the film they said, ‘What the fuck! This is just “Battle Royale” except PG!’”\n\n\tTarantino has shared variations of his favorite-films list over the years. In 2020, he named David Fincher’s “The Social Network” the best movie of the 2010s, saying in an interview with Premiere (via IndieWire):  “It’s ‘The Social Network,’ hands down. It is number one because it’s the best, that’s all! It crushes all the competition.”\n\t\n\n\tListen to Tarantino’s interview on the “Bret Easton Ellis Podcast” here.\n",

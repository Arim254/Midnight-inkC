    "body": "\n\tKristen Stewart delivered rousing remarks Tuesday afternoon during the keynote address at the Academy and Chanel’s Women’s Luncheon in Los Angeles.\n\n\tThe actress and director – her feature film directorial debut, “The Chronology of Water,” is in theaters next month — slammed Hollywood for failing to live up to its post-MeToo goals and efforts.\n\n\t“In a post-MeToo moment, it seemed possible that stories made by and for women were finally getting their due, that we might be allowed or even encouraged to express ourselves and our shared experiences, all of our experiences without filter,” she said after being introduced by Academy president Lynette Howell Taylor. “But I can now attest to the bare-knuckle brawling that it takes every step of the way when the content is too dark, too taboo, when the frankness with which it serves up observations about experiences routinely experienced by women, frequently provokes disgust and rejection.”\n\t\n\n\tShe argued that these experiences are true and deserve to be told with authenticity.\n\n\tIn a moment that earned laughs and applause, Stewart shared, “I am in a severe state of PMS today…But I relish being able to say that my nerves are close to the surface of my skin, and it is a great day for that.”\n\n\tShe went on to say, “We can discuss wage gaps and taxes on tampons and measure [inequality] in lots of quantifiable ways, but the violence of silencing, it’s like we’re not even supposed to be angry. But I can eat this podium with a fork and fucking knife. I’m so angry.”\n\n\tLooking out at the luncheon guests – including Tessa Thompson, Sarah Paulson, Julia Louis Dreyfuss, Patty Jenkins, Alicia Silverstone, Riley Keough, Zoe Deutch, Joey King, Claire Foy, Odessa A’zion, Ruth E, Carter, Kate Hudson, Indya Moore, Embeth Davidtz, Diane Warren, Katy O’Brian and Tig Notaro, among many others – gathered on the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures’ Dolby Family Terrace, Stewart said, “The backsliding from a brief moment of progress is statistically devastating. It is devastating. Such a pitiful number of films from the past year have been made by women. We obviously need many more women’s luncheons in our lives. We need to become ladies who lunch all the fucking time.”\n\t\n\n\tShe continued, “There are too few of us. We’re all here together now, and it seems like there’s a lot, Jesus Christ, there’s not. It’s not our fault. Sure, our business is in a state of emergency, man, and you know the last thing that I wanna do here is lose the celebration under a pile of pissed off rubble. We are allowed to be proud of ourselves and maybe to allow each other to reclaim the gratitude we’ve all become talented at performing and really taste it from the inside out.”\n\n\tStewart received several rounds of applause over the course of her seven-minute speech.\n\n\t“I am thankful to you,” she said. “I am not grateful to a boys’ club business model that pretends to want to hang out with us while siphoning our resources and belittling our true perspectives. Let’s try and not be tokenized. Let’s start printing our own currency.”\n\n\tOn the red carpet, Kate Hudson shared with me the moment she saw and was inspired by a woman in power in Hollywood. “For me, it was Ann-Margaret in ‘Bye Bye Birdie,’” the “Song Sung Blue” star said. “I was obsessed with ‘Bye Bye Birdie.’ There’s this dance that she does and her hair’s going and I was like, ‘Oh, my God, I have to do that.’”\n\n\t“Train Dreams” star Felicity Jones recalled speaking up for herself when she was just 12 years old and quitting a television series show called “The Worst Witch” after just one season. “I just didn’t want to come back and do the second [season],” she said. “Even at that age, I remember being very clear that one [season] was enough and I didn’t want to return for any more. Now I look back and think, ‘Wow, I was obviously very decisive and knew what I wanted at that age.’”\n\n\tThe afternoon also included Oscar-winning costume designer Ruth E. Carter presenting year’s Gold Fellowship for Women recipients Alina Simone and Marlén Viñayo.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tA new romantic comedy from Taiwan has landed at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF). “Goodbye My Love,” helmed by director Yin Chen-hao, reimagines the Korean series “Do It One More Time” (alternatively titled “Go Back”) for Taiwanese audiences. Producer Jin Pai-lunn is leveraging the festival platform to court international collaborators and distributors.\n\n\tThe film centers on an exhausted homemaker whose life takes an unexpected turn when an unusual accident catapults her back in time to her younger years. In this second chance at life, she transforms from a factory worker into a celebrated aerobics champion, forming an unlikely partnership with a woman who was once her competitor. However, destiny has one more surprise in store.\n\t\n\n\tYin received a best new director nod at the 2021 Golden Horse Awards for his first feature, “Man in Love,” and most recently saw his series “GG Precinct” debut on Netflix in 2024.\n\n\n\t“What intrigued me most was the female lead’s courage to re-experience her life,” Yin says. “Through the story’s unique ‘dual time-travel’ concept, we explore themes of love and self-discovery in a way that feels lighthearted yet thought-provoking. In our adaptation, we added a vibrant 1990s aerobics world to highlight the diversity and romance of female empowerment.”\n\n\tThe director emphasizes the film’s underlying message of hope. “Life is a continuous journey of choices, and there’s no turning back, and regrets are inevitable,” he explains. “Through this film, I hope to inspire a sense of hope and remind audiences that it’s never too late to change. Every small step we take can become a giant leap toward a new life.”\n\t\n\n\tCalendar Studios, established by Jin in 2020, serves as the production banner. The company has built a portfolio that includes television series such as “GG Precinct” and “The Pond,” alongside theatrical releases “Man in Love” and “Marry My Dead Body.” Jin’s expertise lies in developing narratives and coordinating film and television resources.\n\n\tThe writing team pairs Ryan Tu with SzHui Liu. Tu, who launched his screenwriting career in 2001, counts among his television work “Light the Night,” “Living,” “Holiday,” and “At the Moment,” while also making his feature directorial bow with “My Best Friend’s Breakfast.” Liu transitioned from advertising copywriting to screen storytelling, drawing on her academic background in Chinese literature and design. Her previous credits include “At the Moment” and “Holiday.”\n\n\tAccording to Jin, the project is currently in the scene outline stage. The team aims to complete the screenplay and begin casting discussions next year, with production preparations expected to start in the latter half of the year.\n\n\t“In recent years, we’ve seen an increasing diversity in romantic storytelling,” Jin says. “Beyond the classic campus and urban romances, the market has shown growing interest in second-chance or remarriage themes, which reflect modern lifestyles. I hope this relatable story can resonate widely and attract attention from international partners and distributors during TCCF, helping us lay a strong market foundation for the project early on.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGenerations of mob rule are undone by a standard-issue revenge tale in “Violent Ends,” a sparing but basically styleless thriller that chronicles a crime family’s unremarkable infighting in the boondocks of Arkansas’ Ozarks. For his long-in-the-works sophomore feature, writer-director John-Michael Powell maintains a likably low-key interest in the local flavor of his home state, but it’s small potatoes in terms of personality. His self-serious approach proves a terminal match for his crime yarn’s familiar, simplistic plotting.\n\t\n\n\tAs suggested by its title, lifted from Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet,” “Violent Ends” begins with a pair of naive, star-crossed lovers, caught up in a turf war between two households both alike in dignity. Gruff country boy Lucas Frost (Billy Magnussen) has fallen for the buttoned-up bank teller Emma Darling (Alexandra Shipp), a rather inexplicable pairing that the two leads visibly exert their charms to make plausible. They’ve got marriage on the horizon and kids on the brain, but being a Frost comes with some heavy baggage. The bloodline has split into two parallel cartel businesses, and there’s a long family tradition of big-manning and power grabs. \n\n\n\t“Violent Ends” lays its scene with opening title cards that recall “Fargo” in their dubious suggestion of a true story, but more function like the “Star Wars” opening crawl, dropping audiences in the midst of a long-waged battle. There’s more exposition to come — more than the powder keg setup really needs. But the fuse is lit when Lucas’ swaggering, sociopathic cousin Sid (the always good James Badge Dale) leaves prison, practically licking his lips as he makes plans to take over the family business.\n\t\n\n\tHis power play comes crashing into Emma’s day-to-day in a standout sequence — one that’s very tense, but also seems unaware of the loaded imagery of a Black woman having a gun pulled on her. The way this standoff ends, which effectively transforms “Violent Ends” into a revenge tale, reeks of convenience. It’s a stink the film never recovers from.\n\n\tIt’s not that Powell’s subsequent approach is immature or distastefully bloodthirsty. The violent ends of “Violent Ends” weren’t engineered for spectacle, but instead unfold as matter-of-fact encounters with few flourishes. But the film is similarly spare in its tilt into tragedy, rummaging for dramatic weight in some paper-thin flashbacks and stilted, moral-measuring arguments. They’re dull foundations that end up trivializing the story’s grim conclusions, wasting the patience the film shows in arriving at them.\n\n\tIt’s most acutely felt in Lucas’ central arc about re-entering the family business. Magnussen has proven a great on-screen presence, with memorable turns in the indie “Ingrid Goes West” and the blockbuster “No Time to Die.” But here, the actor seems less adept at fleshing out the inner turmoil of a man acquiescing to violence, not that Powell puts many words to the character’s pain on the page. A pivotal sequence, in which Lucas fully commits to bloodshed, loses its edge by unlocking the character’s inner poet for some reason, climaxing with a corny monologue about rattlesnakes. Pitched as a slow burn, “Violent Ends” mostly moves in a series of lurches, hitting one writerly standoff after another and leaving its actors to try to fill in the psychological gaps in between.\n\n\tPowell had a decent idea in casting a bunch of huffing, puffing bosses and bumbling goons to fill out the Frost family — enough to make Lucas’ pretty boy seem intimidating by comparison. Moreover, the canny ensemble casting suggests the Frost dynasty’s precarious state better than the film’s dialogue does. If these hotheads are in charge and lugs are doing the dirty work, things really have gotten too sloppy to last.\n\n\tBut “Violent Ends” doesn’t make much of an impression outside of such small pockets, even with its emphasis on its setting. Powell, along with DP Elijah Guess, shoot Arkansas civilization like a wasteland: a derelict region of dusty homes and cavernous warehouses. There are some memorable locations — a dirt track with a bumping nightlife, a greasy spoon that looks hundreds of years old — but more often, the film’s world seems generic and, worse, unpopulated. Who is even buying all the Frost family’s drugs? A lot of bodies pile up in “Violent Ends,” but the film doesn’t convey enough life to earn much mourning.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRedRover has tapped prolific Korean filmmaker Lee Seok-hoon to write and direct “Rainmakers,” marking the animation studio’s first foray into K-pop-driven storytelling.\n\n\tThe Korea-based company is presenting the project at AFM along with “The Nut Job 3” and “MegaRacer,” a sci-fi racing pic currently in post-production. The “Nut Job” franchise has earned more than $200 million globally across two installments.\n\n\n\tLee’s “Rainmakers” centers on unlikely allies — an orphan and a princess — who join forces with outcasts to take down a corporate threat to their world. Music plays a central role in the story, with K-pop’s aesthetic and energy woven throughout the film’s narrative and visual design. Planet Nero serves as the backdrop for the action-adventure, which will include original songs from an unnamed K-pop producer.\n\t\n\n\t“As Korean culture, and K-pop in particular, continues to grow and be celebrated globally, we are thrilled to bring a bold, music-driven animated feature to life under the visionary direction of Lee Seok-hoon,” said Amy Shi, strategy executive and producer at RedRover. “With RedRover’s deep understanding of global kids and family entertainment, ‘Rainmakers’ combines the dynamic energy of K-pop with cinematic storytelling to create a vibrant new world we can’t wait to share with audiences everywhere.”\n\n\tLee ranks among South Korea’s top-earning directors, with credits spanning multiple genres. His action sequel “Confidential Assignment 2: International” was Korea’s third-biggest film of 2022, while “The Himalayas” led the local box office for three weeks. He’s also helmed period adventure “The Pirates” and romantic comedy “Dancing Queen.”\n\t\n\n\t“This is an incredible opportunity to collaborate with one of Korea’s leading animation studios,” Lee said. “Animation has always fascinated me — it allows you to create entire worlds beyond what’s possible in live action. With RedRover, a studio that truly understands global family storytelling, I’m confident we’ll deliver a world-class production that connects with audiences everywhere.”\n\n\tThe third “Nut Job” film will feature franchise regulars alongside new characters, following Surly’s daughter Hazel on a journey that tests the father-daughter bond while old nemesis Raccoon seeks payback.\n\n\t“MegaRacer” takes place during a rare celestial event that occurs once every eight years, when competing racers travel through time and space chasing glory and mysterious powers.\n\n\tRedRover launched in 2004 as a 3D stereoscopic tech company before transitioning to animation production. The studio’s credits include “Spark,” which featured Jessica Biel, Hilary Swank, Susan Sarandon and Patrick Stewart, plus series “Bolts & Blip” and “Bubble Bubble Marin.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRobert Pattinson recently told IndieWire that filming Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part Three” was hotter than imagined. Similar to the first two movies in the franchise, the latest “Dune” tentpole filmed a large portion of its scenes in the Arabian desert.\n\n\t“When I was doing ‘Dune’ it was so hot in the desert that I just couldn’t question anything,” Pattinson said. “And it was so relaxing, like my brain actually wasn’t operating. I did not have a single functioning brain cell. And I was just listening to Denis [Villeneuve]: ‘Whatever you want!'”\n\t\n\n\tPattinson’s role in Villeneuve’s third and final “Dune” movie remains under wraps. He’s one of the threequel’s most prominent new cast members, along with relative newcomers Nakoa-Wolf Momoa and Ida Brooke, who are playing Paul and Chani’s twin children. Returning cast members include Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Florence Pugh, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson and Anya Taylor-Joy. The film is based on Frank Herbert’s second “Dune” novel, “Dune Messiah.”\n\n\n\tIt appears that with every “Dune” movie, there are countless stories about the actors enduring the scorching heat of the film’s desert locations. Austin Butler, who played the villainous Feyd-Rautha in “Dune: Part Two,” once told Entertainment Weekly that heat stroke impacted several people on set during his first week of shooting the sequel.\n\n\t“It was 110 degrees and so hot,” Butler said. “I had the bald cap on, and it was between two soundstages that were just these gray boxes of 200-foot walls and sand. It became like a microwave. There were people passing out from heat stroke. And that was just my first week.”\n\t\n\n\t“It really bonds the entire crew,” Butler added. “There’s something so humbling about being in such an uncomfortable environment.” \n\n\tZendaya revealed to W Magazine that she suffered heatstroke filming “Dune: Part Two” because her costume was so heavy and she stopped drinking water on the film’s very hot Jordan desert set.\n\n\t“I had such a fear of peeing myself or shitting myself, honestly, in the suit on set,” she explained, referring to the body armor worn by the Fremen warriors in the movie to help them survive the brutal conditions of the desert. “We were in Jordan. It was very hot, and I remember thinking, ‘Oh, man, the bathrooms are so far away,’ because we had to hike to the locations. If you have to pee, you need at least 10 minutes to get out of the costumes. I was like, ‘Damn, I don’t want to drink too much water.’ One day, I didn’t drink enough and I had a heatstroke. I felt so barfy. I remember calling my mom on the bathroom floor, saying, ‘I feel terrible.’ She was like, ‘Did you drink water today?’ I said no. I thought I was being smart, but you can’t do that. So, lesson learned.”\n\n\tNearly all of the “Dune” cast had to endure hot temperatures while filming the space epic, which is one reason Villeneuve was grateful he didn’t go the usual Hollywood route and film both “Dune” films back-to-back with no break in productions.\n\n\t“Both movies were made in very harsh conditions, and it’s very physically taxing, so to have a break in between them was a blessing,” Villeneuve told EW. “My first thought was to shoot both movies back to back together, but now I think I would have died. It was really intense, and seeing how the world reacted to ‘Part One’ was a boost of positive energy to go back into the desert.”\n\n\t“Dune: Part Three” is scheduled for release on Dec. 18, 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tProduction has begun in Vietnam on “Mr. Hero,” a dramedy centered on a down-on-his-luck father who fakes a heroic rescue to impress his daughter, only to find himself thrust into the national spotlight.\n\n\tThe feature marks a collaboration between HK Film, V Pictures and Beach House Pictures, a Fremantle company. Vietnamese comedy star Thai Hoa leads the cast under the direction of Vo Thach Thao, the filmmaker behind hit series “Cay Tao No Hoa,” which attracted over 350 million viewers when it first aired in Vietnam.\n\t\n\n\tTimothy Linh Bui is producing for Happy Canvas alongside Do Dinh Truong, Trinh Hoan and Tuong Vi. Thao wrote the script with Doan Hai Van.\n\n\n\tThe project takes its cue from a 2011 incident in which Nguyen Ngoc Manh rescued a child who fell from a twelfth-floor window, earning widespread acclaim. Thao’s screenplay flips the premise: the protagonist stages his own heroic moment, then must grapple with the consequences when the deception snowballs. According to the filmmakers, the character’s journey toward genuine courage forms the emotional core of the story.\n\n\t“I’m excited to help bring this heartfelt story to the screen,” said producer Bui. “I’ve known HK Film, V Pictures and Conor for several years and been looking for the right project to collaborate on together. I’m thrilled that we all recognized the potential in ‘Mr. Hero’ – a touching and universal story that will resonate with audiences everywhere.”\n\n\tThai Hoa has emerged as one of Vietnam’s top box office draws since his breakthrough performance as a cross-dressing character in “Fool For Love.” This year saw him headline “The Tunnel” and “Hijack 78,” the latter pulling in more than 2.5 million admissions locally.\n\t\n\n\tExecutive producer Phong Nguyen of HK Film said: “HK Film is delighted to collaborate with V Pictures, Beach House Pictures and the visionary director Vo Thach Thao on ‘Mr. Hero.’ We believe this moving story of a father’s love and sacrifice will deeply connect with audiences, and we’re excited to work alongside such esteemed partners to bring this touching journey to life, showcasing the universal power of familial devotion.”\n\n\tFor Beach House Pictures, the project represents a continued push into the Vietnamese market. “We’re absolutely thrilled to be joining forces with Timothy, Trinh Hoan, V Pictures and the brilliant team at HK Film,” said Conor Zorn, head of scripted at Beach House Pictures. “We remain firmly committed to championing new voices and stories across Asia as the region continues to make its mark on the global stage.”\n\n\tV Pictures CEO Nguyen Hoang Hai added: “This is an incredibly exciting partnership for our studio. With a strong ensemble cast, a talented director and an experienced powerhouse team, ‘Mr. Hero’ has all the ingredients for a major box office success. At its heart is a powerful, compelling story that will deeply resonate with audiences.”\n\n\tPrincipal photography is underway on location in Vietnam. CJ CGV will distribute the film locally in April 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWorld Softest Productions is developing “Taiwan Travelogue,” an adaptation of the U.S. National Book Award-winning novel by Taiwanese writer Yang Shuang-zi that explores a complex relationship between two women against the backdrop of Japanese colonial rule in 1938 Taiwan.\n\n\tThe series, currently in script development, is selected at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF). It follows Japanese writer Aoyama Chizuko, who travels to Taiwan to give lectures while escaping marriage pressures back home. There she meets Ō Chizuru, a talented local interpreter who becomes her essential guide to understanding Taiwan—and a relationship that exposes the painful realities of colonial power dynamics.\n\t\n\n\t“What drew us to ‘Taiwan Travelogue’ is the relationship between two women,” says executive producer and producer Chen Yu Chang, director general of World Sofsoft Productions. “Chizuko is outspoken and guided by a strong sense of justice, saying whatever she thinks without hesitation, while Chizuru suppresses her emotions and hides her true feelings deep within.”\n\n\n\tThe narrative follows the two young women as they grow closer through shared experiences with food and culture, only to confront the unbridgeable gulf between them created by language, power, and identity. When Chizuko attempts to protect Chizuru through what she considers a “well-meaning Japanese perspective,” she inadvertently wounds Chizuru’s dignity. The interpreter eventually confronts the writer, telling her that Chizuko wants to protect an idealized version of her, not the real Ō Chizuru.\n\n\t“They are like magnets, irresistibly attracted, yet destined to separate,” Chang explains. “We want to portray that kind of love – a love that even the word ‘love’ cannot cross.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production brings together a notable team of Japan-Taiwan collaborators. Executive producer Jayde Lin, who invested in the hit horror series “The Tag-Along” and produced acclaimed series like “The World Between Us II” and “Wave Makers,” brings experience in elevating Taiwanese content to global platforms. Japanese producer Maehata Sachiko adds international co-production experience from credits including “Shark” for NTV and YouTube Originals’ “Gray Zone Agency, Inc.”\n\n\tJapanese screenwriter Yoshida Erika, whose recent credits include the anime “Bocchi the Rock!” and the series “The Tiger and Her Wings,” is handling the adaptation. Her work on “Cherry Magic!” earned Best Script Adaptation at the KKTV Annual Japanese Drama Awards.\n\n\tChang emphasizes that the story’s themes resonate beyond its historical setting. “Set in 1938, a time shadowed by the quiet approach of war, the story reflects an age of uncertainty. Yet, even 90 years later, humanity still lives with the same anxiety and unease,” he says. “Wars continue, and in our globalized world, differences of culture, identity, and gender still shape hierarchies of power and tension between people.”\n\n\tThe series is scheduled to begin filming in 2026 across locations in both Japan and Taiwan, with a planned Q4 2027 release. Chang notes that Taiwan’s well-preserved historical architecture will help recreate “the energetic and fascinating world of 1930s Taiwan – a time when life was vibrant and full of discovery.”\n\n\tAt TCCF, World Softest Productions is seeking sales partners and distribution platforms for the project. “This project is not only a story for Taiwanese and Japanese audiences,” Chang says. “Set during the Japanese colonial era in Taiwan, it aims to render history tangible and emotionally resonant, allowing a broader audience to experience that time alongside the characters.”\n\n\tChang, who participated in the 2024 documentary “Triads: The Chinese Mafia on the Rise” for Arte and launched “The Thrifty Family,” which ranked among Taiwan’s top 10 streaming shows, also produced the 2025 documentary “Have You Eaten Yet? Tasting Taiwan,” which received three Golden Bell Award nominations including best lifestyle program, director, and cinematography.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Trump’s edited interview with CBS News‘ “60 Minutes” — a year after he sued the newsmagazine over its editing practices and extracted a multimillion-dollar payout — scored big ratings for the program.\n\n\tThe Nov. 2 airing of “60 Minutes” featuring Trump’s interview drew 14 million total viewers and 3 million viewers in the 25-54 demo, according to Nielsen Panel + Big Data ratings. The CBS newsmagazine delivered its best audience since Jan. 10, 2021, with its episode that aired after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters that featured interviews with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger (which had 14.9 million viewers).\n\t\n\n\tFor the 2024-25 season, “60 Minutes” averaged 8.32 million viewers for the 2024-25 season, according to Nielsen data.\n\n\n\tIn addition, according to CBS News, thanks to the Trump interview, “60 Minutes” hit 144.9 million total video views across social platforms, up from last week’s all-time high of 92.6 million views.\n\n\tTrump was interviewed by Norah O’Donnell, CBS News senior correspondent and a contributor to “60 Minutes.” It was Trump’s first interview with “60 Minutes” in five years. During the interview, Trump boasted that “‘60 Minutes’ paid me a lotta money” to settle his lawsuit over its editing of an interview with then-VP Kamala Harris and he praised the takeover of Paramount by David Ellison’s Skydance Media — but those comments were edited out of the version that aired on CBS.\n\n\t“‘60 Minutes’ paid me a lotta money,” Trump said. “You don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you, and I’m sure you’re not – you have a great – I think you have a great, new leader, frankly, who’s the young woman that’s leading your whole enterprise is a great – from what I know.” Trump was referring to Bari Weiss, appointed as editor-in-chief of CBS News last month after Paramount Skydance bought her outlet The Free Press in a $150 million deal. About Weiss, Trump said, “I don’t know her, but I hear she’s a great person.”\n\t\n\n\tRegarding the Ellison family’s acquisition of Paramount, parent of CBS, Trump said, “I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.”\n\n\tTrump is friendly with Larry Ellison, the ultra-wealthy founder of Oracle. Last month, Trump said, “Larry Ellison is great, and his son David is great. They’re friends of mine. They’re big supporters of mine. They will make the right decisions. They’re going to revitalize CBS — hopefully, they’ll bring it back to its former glory.”\n\n\tTrump told O’Donnell that “60 Minutes” was “forced to pay me a lot of money because they took [Harris’] answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can’t have fake news. You’ve gotta have legit news. And I think that it’s happening.”\n\n\tTrump’s claim that “60 Minutes” paid him is not technically correct. In fact, parent company Paramount Global agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle his lawsuit that alleged “60 Minutes” deceptively edited Harris’ responses in a way that somehow had damaged Trump and misled voters.\n\n\tResponding to an FCC demand, CBS News released a full transcript of the Harris interview, which showed it had not altered the substance of her remarks. Legal experts said Paramount would easily have won in court, and initially Paramount and CBS News sought to have the case tossed. However, former Paramount controlling shareholder Shari Redstone pushed the company to resolve the case out of court, which paved the way for the Trump administration’s approval of the Skydance Media $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Global.\n\n\tCBS News on Sunday released a transcript of the full 90-minute session with Trump and posted most of the rest of its on YouTube. About one-third of O’Donnell’s interview with Trump was aired on TV.\n\n\tThe interview covered a wide range topics, from international politics to ICE raids in the U.S. to the economy and healthcare police to the federal government shutdown. Much of the interview was devoted to O’Donnell’s questions about the president’s views on geopolitical hot spots and challenges the U.S. faces in dealing with Russia, China, Israel, Venezuela and other unpredictable situations. The interview was recorded Oct. 31 at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago compound in Palm Beach, Fla. \n\t\n\n\tO’Donnell questioned Trump about the conflict of interest involved in his role as U.S. president and his family investments in crypto and the marketing of Trump-branded crypto currencies. Trump was dismissive in his reply: “I can’t say, because — I can’t say — I’m not concerned. I don’t — I’d rather not have you ask the question. But I let you ask it. You just came to me and you said, ‘Can I ask another question?’ And I said, yeah. This is the question–.” At which point O’Donnell interjected, “And you answered–” before Trump continued, “I don’t mind. Did I let you do it? I coulda walked away. I didn’t have to answer this question. I’m proud to answer the question.”\n\n\tTrump said, “We’re number one in crypto in the whole world. Other people wanna be. They’re fighting like hell to be. But we’re number one in crypto because I’m the president. Biden wanted to also, at the very end, you know, he totally switched his thing.”\n\n\tO’Donnell also asked Trump about his pardon of “crypto’s richest man, a billionaire known as CZ.” She was referring to former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who in 2023 pleaded guilty to U.S. government charge of failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program on the crypto exchange. Zhao was sentenced to four months in jail and released in September 2024.\n\n\tTrump responded, “Okay, are you ready? I don’t know who he is. I know he got a four-month sentence or something like that. And I heard it was a Biden witch hunt. And what I wanna do is see crypto, ’cause if we don’t do it it’s gonna go to China, it’s gonna go to — this is no different to me than AI.”\n",

Rowling’s novels.\n\n\tThe HBO series is still more than a year away, but Audible’s version of “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” will be released on Nov. 4. Each subsequent book will be released a month apart, culminating with “Deathly Hallows” on May 12. \n\n\tWhile HBO’s and Audible’s casts are both star-studded (and share one key actor), Audible could focus on the voice of each performer rather than find someone who looked like Rowling’s characters from the books. Audible also split up some of the Hogwarts students to give them a young voice for “Sorcerer’s Stone,” “Chamber of Secrets” and “Prisoner of Azkaban,” then replace them with an older actor for “Goblet of Fire,” “Order of the Phoenix,” “Half Blood Prince” and “Deathly Hallows.”\n\n\tFrankie Treadaway, Max Lester and Arabella Stanton star as Harry, Ron and Hermione in the first three books, with Jaxon Knopf, Rhys Mulligan and Nina Barker-Francis taking over for the final four. Notably, Stanton was also cast as Hermione in HBO’s series, giving listers of the Audible books a sneak peek at what her performance will be like in live-action.\n\n\tAudible’s Hogwarts is filled with more than 200 actors and many big-name Hollywood stars. Hugh Laurie plays Dumbledore, Matthew Macfadyen is Voldemort, Riz Ahmed is Snape, Kit Harington is Gilderoy Lockhart, Keira Knightley is Dolores Umbridge and James McAvoy is Mad-Eye Moody.\n\n\tSee all of the cast members in Audible’s “Harry Potter” series below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHarry Potter (Frankie Treadaway)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFrankie Treadaway will star as young Harry Potter in books 1-3. Treadaway is a theater actor with stage credits in “Matilda the Musical, “Peter Pan,” “Mary Poppins,” “Elf” and “Mrs. Doubtfire.” Daniel Radcliffe first brought Harry to life in the films and Dominic McLaughlin will take charge in the HBO series.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRon Weasley (Max Lester)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tMax Lester will assume the role of Harry’s partner in crime, Ron Weasley, in books 1-3. The redhead wizard is Harry’s best friend at Hogwarts and a member of Gryffindor House at Hogwarts. The young actor possesses a diverse portfolio with an acting role in “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” to stage credits in “Les Misérables” and “Leopoldstadt.” He has also lent his voice to animations such as “Best Birthday Ever” and “Barbapapa,” as well as the BBC Radio 4 comedy series “Hennikay.” Alastair Stout is set to play Ron on the HBO series.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHermione Granger (Arabella Stanton)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tYoung Hermione Granger in books 1-3 will be voiced by Arabella Stanton, who will also play the main character in the upcoming HBO show. Considered to be one of the smartest witches in Hogwarts, Hermione is also a close friend to Harry and Ron. Stanton debuted as Matilda in “Matilda the Musical” and went on to perform in “Starlight Express” before joining the fantasy franchise.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHarry Potter (Jaxon Knopf)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAs Harry grows older in books 4-7, the torch will be passed to Jaxon Knopf to voice the titular character. Knopf previously starred in plays “Big Fish, The Musical” and “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” as well as film roles in “Moishe.” He also voiced Ricky Zoom in the animation series of the same name.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRon Weasley (Rhys Mulligan)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tRhys Mulligan will voice an older version of Ron Weasley in books 4-7.

Riz Ahmed most recently starred in Wes Anderson’s latest feature, “The Phoenician Scheme.” He has also acted in “Relay,” “Sound of Metal” and more. Alan Rickman famously played Snape in the movies, and Paapa Essiedu will portray Snape in the HBO series.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDraco Malfoy (Jude Farrant)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tHarry’s nemesis, Draco Malfoy, comes from a long lineage of pure-blooded wizards, finding himself sorted into the Slytherin house. Throughout the books, Draco and Harry often go head-to-head at Hogwarts, and where Malfoy will do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Tom Felton played the role in the original movies.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDraco Malfoy (Maximus Evans) \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tMaximus Evans will voice teenage Draco in books 4-7.

This will be Mountain’s first major role.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRubeus Hagrid (Mark Addy)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tMark Addy’s greatest contribution to the fantasy genre may be playing the brutish King Robert Baratheon in “Game of Thrones,” but he will showcase a gentler touch in the “Harry Potter” audiobooks, voicing Hogwart’s warmhearted Keeper of Keys, Rubeus Hagrid. A fan-favorite character, Hagrid is a tender and gregarious confidant of Harry and his friends throughout all seven books. Robbie Coltrane first brought the character to life in the films and Nick Frost will take up the mantle in the HBO series.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMinerva McGonagall (Michelle Gomez)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tScottish actress Michelle Gomez, best known for her parts in “Doctor Who,” “The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” and “The Flight Attendant,” will voice Hogwarts transfiguration professor and Head of Gryffindor House, Minerva McGonagall. A stern, yet steady presence in the school, McGonagall often appears as second in command behind Dumbledore. Maggie Smith portrayed her in the “Potter” films and Janet McTeer will play her in the series.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tProfessor Lockhart (Kit Harrington)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tProfessor Gilderoy Lockhart is a celebrity and author of books detailing his journey and adventures with dark creatures. He becomes the Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where Harry and other Hogwarts students found him to be obnoxious and full of himself.

During her time at Hogwarts, Umbridge is abusive and cruel to the students, especially to Harry, Ron and Hermione. Knightley is known for her work in films like “Pirates of the Caribbean,” “Atonement,” “Pride and Prejudice,” and Netflix’s “Black Doves” series. Imelda Staunton played Umbridge in the movies.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLucius Malfoy (Alex Hassell)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe patriarch of the Malfoy family, Lucius Malfoy is a princely and sneering figure introduced in the second “Potter” book. His character only grows viler as the saga progresses. Jason Isaacs played Lucious in the films and Johnny Flynn will play him on HBO. Alex Hassell will voice the character in the audiobooks. Hassel has previously appeared in “The Boys,” “Cowboy Bebop,” “His Dark Materials” and “Rivals,” and has preformed copiously on stage as a founding member of the Factory Theatre Company.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tProfessor Lupin (Iwan Rheon)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tProfessor Remus Lupin is the Defense Against The Dark Arts professor and is highly regarded as one of the best professors at Hogwarts during his time.

Harry’s godfather, Sirius is first believed to be a traitor to Harry’s parents and a murderous Deatheater in “Prisoner of Azkaban.” However, by the end of the book, he is revealed to be innocent and becomes the closest thing to Harry has to a father figure. Dìrísù’s “Slow Horses” co-star Gary Oldman played Sirius in the movies.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMad-Eye Moody (James McAvoy)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tConsidered to be one of the most famous aurors, Mad-Eye Moody was another one of the Defense Against the Dark Arts professors at Hogwarts.

He gets Harry into lots of trouble trying to save him. The wide-eyed, bat-eared, falsetto-voiced diminutive creature makes his first appearance in “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets” as a slave to the Malfoy family. He then appears sporadically throughout the successive books. Dobby was created as a CGI puppet in the films and voiced by Toby Jones. In the new audiobooks, Daniel Mays from “Mrs. Biggs,” “The Thursday Murder Club” and “EastEnders” will lend his voice to the unique character.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLuna Lovegood (Millie Gubby)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tA member of the Ravenclaw house, Luna Lovegood becomes one of Harry’s friends and key supporters in “Order of the Phoenix.” She’s a quirky and odd student, who takes a liking to magical creatures.

Martin previously appeared in the BBC adaptations of “Bleak House” and “Poppy Shakespeare” as well as “Line of Duty,” “Code 404” and “Motherland.” She’s previously contributed to the fantasy genre on stage, playing Lyra Belacqua in a National Theater adaptation of “His Dark Materials.” Skeeter was played by Miranda Richardson in the “Potter” films.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tParvati Patil (Avni Deshmukh)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tOne of the Patil twins, Parvati is a Gryffindor in the same year as Harry. Her biggest part in the “Potter” saga comes in “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” when she attends the Yule Ball with Harry. Sitara Shah first brought Parvati to the screen in the third Potter movie before Shefali Chowdhury took over the role in subsequent films. Newcomer Alessia Leoni will play Parvati in the HBO series and internet personality Avni Deshmukh of digital duo “Sara and Avni” will voice her in the audiobook.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPadma Patil (Sara Deshmukh)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tParvati’s identical twin sister, Padma Patil is a Ravenclaw in Harry’s year at Hogwarts. She attends the Yule Ball with Ron in “The Goblet of Fire,” and ends up rightfully slighted by Ron’s petty attitude throughout the night. In “The Order of the Phoenix,” she is appointed as a Ravenclaw prefect and trains alongside Harry, Ron, Hermione and her sister in Dumbledore’s Army. Sharon Sandhu played Padma in “The Prisoner of Azkaban” movie before Afshan Azad took over the role in “Goblet of Fire” and beyond. Sara Deshmukh — Avni Deshmukh’s sister and the other half of their digital brand, ‘Sara and Avni”— will voice Padma in the audiobook.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tProfessor Slughorn (Bill Nighy)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tA unique character who emerges late in the series, Horace Slughorn takes up the mantle as Hogwarts’ Potions Professor after Snape starts teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts in the sixth book. An extremely tenured professor with regretful ties to Voldemort’s past, Slughorn plays a crucial role in the saga’s final act. Bill Nighy will voice the character, marking the actor’s return to the Wizarding World, as he played Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour on screen in “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1.” Jim Broadbent played Slughorn in the films.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tStan Shunpike (David Holmes)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDavid Holmes will voice Stan Shunpike, the driver of the Night Bus who first appears in “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.” Lee Ingleby previously played the character in the films. The audiobooks will not be Holmes’ first foray into the Wizarding World, as he served as Daniel Radcliffe’s stunt double in the first six films. An accident on the set of the seventh film left him partially paralyzed, though he still received credit as a stunt performer. He has since launched the podcast “Cunning Stunts” and was the subject of the 2023 HBO documentary, “David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived,” which Radcliffe executive produced. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKreacher (Mackenzie Crook)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tA house-elf who is loyal to Sirius Black’s family, Kreacher serves Harry later in the book series. Mackenzie Crook is most known for his role as Gareth Keenan in “The Office,” Orell in HBO’s “Game of Thrones,” and Ragetti in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” film series.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNearly Headless Nick (Stephen Mangan)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, or known as Nearly Headless Nick, was a wizard of the royal court before being executed after a mishap. After being almost completely decapitated, Nick haunts Gryffindor Tower at Hogwarts and can pull his head off as a prank. Stephen Mangan has had previous roles in “Watership Down,” “Green Wing,” and as Dan Moody in “I’m Alan Partridge.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tProfessor Sprout (Gemma Whelan)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tGemma Whelan, the actress best known for playing Yara Greyjoy in “Game of Thrones” and appearing in “Upstart Crow,” “The End of the F***ing World” and “Killing Eve,” will voice Hogwarts herbology professor, Pomona Sprout. The plant-loving teacher was previously portrayed by Miriam Margolyes in the “Potter” films and will be played by Sirine Saba in the upcoming series.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMadam Hooch (Tracy-Ann Oberman)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe flying instructor and Quidditch referee at Hogwarts, Madam Hooch teaches students like Harry how to ride on broomsticks, overseeing Quidditch players, and making sure students are following rules at the school. Tracy-Ann Oberman previously played Chrissie Watts on BBC’s “Eastenders” and Valerie Lewis in Channel 4’s “Friday Night Dinner.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSir Cadogan (Matt Berry)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSir Cadogan is a knight from the days of King Arthur. Though he died centuries ago, he is immortalized as one of the talking paintings at Hogwarts, still showcasing his excessive fearlessness from the canvas. Though Cadogan can only be caught as a fleeting background figure in the “Potter” movies, he has ample dialogue in the books. Comedian Matt Berry from “What We Do in the Shadows,” “The IT Crowd” and “A Minecraft Movie” lends his voice to the hilariously overzealous character.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNarrator (Cush Jumbo)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAmong the “Harry Potter” audiobooks’ all-star cast, Cush Jumbo will have the most prominent voice the throughout the series. Voicing the narrator, the British writer and actress best known for playing Lucca Quinn on CBS’s “The Good Wife” will be heard on every page of the seven volumes. Jumbo will be the new voice of the Wizarding World, just as Stephen Fry and Jim Dale respectively narrated the original British and American versions of the audiobooks as they released in the early aughts.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNicki Minaj is Apparently Thrilled That The White House Used Her Music\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMaurizio Cattelan’s New Solid-Gold Toilet Could Fetch $10 Million at Auction\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTexas All-Star Cheer Gym Declares Bankruptcy Before Sex Abuse Trial\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZohran Mamdani’s Wife Rama Duwaji Makes Art in Many Forms\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

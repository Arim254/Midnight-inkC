    "body": "\n\tNatasha Kermani’s film began with a dark vision she couldn’t shake.\n\n\t“I couldn’t let go of this idea of two women living in a very desolate, barbaric landscape,” she says. “I felt like that was a relationship I didn’t see a lot, and one I wanted to explore. We see a lot of mothers and daughters, but we don’t see a lot of mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, two women of two different generations who have been thrust into coexistence.”\n\t\n\n\tFrom there, the idea of “The Dreadful” was born. The film, headed to theaters today via Lionsgate, is a dramatic horror tale set during the War of the Roses, at the tail end of the Dark Ages. Sophie Turner stars as Anne, who is living with her mother-in-law, Morwen (a fiery Marcia Gay Harden), while her husband is at war. But when her childhood friend (Kit Harington) tells her that her husband has died, they grow closer and evil starts lurking.\n\n\n\tWhile Kermani, who wrote and directed the film, is upfront about her love of genre films, she says she is always careful to make sure the scares work in service of the characters.\n\n\t“I don’t think anything I do is a horror conceit first,” she says. “Everything I do is based on relationship and a character’s journey from Point A to Point B. The horror needs to express that journey. The horror needs to be a color in our palette that we’re using to tell this character’s story. Often these characters are experiencing fear, so it’s always the question of, ‘What is this character afraid of?'”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSophie Turner and Natasha Kermani on the set of “The Dreadful.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKate Eccarius\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBeyond traditional scares, “The Dreadful” amps up the eerie atmosphere and discomfort. One meta element comes from the casting of Turner and Harington as lovers, which feels a bit wrong given that their “Game of Thrones” characters are raised as siblings. Even Turner admitted it felt odd. But Kermani says it’s a happy accident that audiences are coming in with that subtext.\n\t\n\n\t“These characters were always childhood friends,” she says. “One of the themes of the film is growing up, so she has these memories of this character as a child and their childhood together. Now here they are as adults, reevaluating their relationship. They’re not related in our film, but there is a bit of a love triangle, so there is a forbidden fruit feeling in our film. I think it’s interesting that it worked out that way.”\n\n\tKermani went on to praise Turner’s performance as uniquely intuitive, able to draw even more from her character beyond the script.\n\n\t“One of the things she latched onto was the character’s spirituality and inner strength,” she says. “I think that was something I didn’t necessarily see up front. I thought maybe this character would feel more childlike, a bit of a blank slate that evolves. But what Sophie brought that I loved so much, and I’m so glad she did, is that you can actually see that strength and steeliness in her from the first time she appears onscreen. She has these instincts and intuition for the characters that she is able to string through in a very consistent way.”\n\n\t“The Dreadful” is a melting pot of influences, including a reimagining of the folk tale that inspired the classic Japanese horror film “Onibaba.” Yet even as the stakes rise and the scares come along, Kermani says it’s a small-scale story at heart.\n\n\t“That core relationship between the two women, specifically the older generation and a younger generation, and the struggle between them as it starts to fray and to fall apart, and the one character is trying to move away, and the other one is trying to hold onto her, felt to me like an interesting sandbox to play in,” she says. “Everything else — the mythology, the fantastical elements, the period — really came out of exploring that core relationship.”\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “The Dreadful” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tKatseye has announced that member Manon Bannerman will be taking a temporary hiatus to “focus on her health and wellbeing.”\n\n\tThe group, which was recently nominated for best new artist at the Grammys, posted a statement saying that the members collectively discussed Bannerman’s hiatus and “fully support this decision.”\n\n\t“After open and thoughtful conversations together, we are sharing that Manon will be taking a temporary hiatus from group activities to focus on her health and wellbeing,” reads the statement. “Katseye remains committed to showing up for one another and for the fans who mean everything to us. The group will continue scheduled activities during this time, and we look forward to being together again when the time is right.”\n\t\n\n\tThe global girl group, which also includes Daniela Avanzini, Lara Raj, Megan Skiendiel, Sophia Laforteza and Yoonchae Jeung, climbed the ranks as K-pop trainees on the 2023 reality competition series “Dream Academy.” Katseye became breakout performers following the Netflix docuseries “Popstar Academy: Katseye” along with their aptly-titled first single “Debut.”\n\n\tIn their time together as a group, they’ve released a pair of EPs — 2024’s “SIS (Soft Is Strong)” and last year’s “Beautiful Chaos” — as well as a handful of singles. “Gnarly,” which was co-written by Alice Longyu Gao, became their first song to hit the Billboard Hot 100 last year. The sextet followed with “Gabriela,” “Gameboy” and “Internet Girl,” the latter of which debuted at No. 29 on the chart last month.\n\n\tKatseye performed “Gnarly” at the Grammy Awards earlier this month. In addition to their best new artist nod, “Gabriela” was nominated for best pop duo/group performance.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTurtle brothers Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo’s next big screen adventure will crash into theaters a little sooner than previously scheduled.\n\n\tThe new “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” movie, “Mutant Mayhem 2,” will debut on August 13, 2027, moving up a month from its announced September 17 release date.\n\n\t“Mutant Mayhem 2” is directed by Jeff Rowe with co-directors Kyler Spears and Yashar Kassai. Rowe and Spears worked on the first film alongside producers and writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who also return. Rounding out the producing team are Point Grey’s James Weaver, Josh Fagen and Ramsay McBean, with Lukas Williams serving as executive producer.\n\t\n\n\tThe “TMNT” brand has been a major priority for Paramount in recent years, and the focus on the beloved cross-generational IP only increased under the new Skydance management. The first “Mutant Mayhem” movie launched in August 2023, grossing $181 million worldwide. But Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies were already so bullish on the fresh new spin on the 40-year-old franchise that they began developing the sequel before the movie hit theaters. \n\n\n\tLast year, Paramount also added an untitled live-action/CG animation hybrid “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” film to the calendar for Nov. 17, 2028. It will be the first live-action “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” since 2016’s “Out of the Shadows.”\n\n\tThen, earlier this month, Paramount announced plans to expand the “TMNT” franchise through several ventures, including a major toy licensing partnership with Mattel (beginning in 2027), an illustrated book for middle schoolers (“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splinter’s Dojo”), a novel for adults (based on the bestselling graphic novel “The Last Ronin”), a preschool-targeted digital series (“Teeny Mutant Ninja Turtles” for YouTube) and themed pizzerias opening in Santa Monica, Monterrey, Mexico and Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s the dawn of a new era for Xbox.\n\n\tOn Friday, Microsoft Gaming announced longtime leader Phil Spencer would be retiring as CEO and that Asha Sharma, Microsoft CoreAI’s head of product development, had been named his successor. \n\n\tWith Spencer having been a staple in the gaming community for decades, Sharma knows she has some big shoes to fill, telling Variety in an interview she has “deep respect” for Spencer’s leadership and the legacy he’s leaving behind to her and now-chief content officer Matt Booty.\n\t\n\n\tSharma was quick in laying out her top priorities for Microsoft Gaming in an internal memo announcing her promotion, noting “great games,” “the return of Xbox” and the “future of play” as her three main commitments to the gaming community.\n\n\tSo first, what makes a great game for Sharma, whose roles prior to CoreAI include top positions at Instacart and Meta? The new Microsoft Gaming CEO says it’s all about games with “deep emotional resonance” and “a distinct point of view.” She wants to develop stories that make players “feel something,” like the kind of feelings Campo Santo’s 2016 first-person mystery “Firewatch” elicited in her.\n\n\tSharma takes on the mantle as head of the leading competitor to Sony’s PlayStation and Nintendo knowing full well she’s entering the role as an outsider to the larger gaming community and has “a lot to learn” still, but sees that as an asset with a commitment to “being grounded in what the community is telling us.”\n\n\t“I’m coming into gaming as a platform builder,” Sharma said, adding that her goal is to “earn the right to be trusted by players and developers” and show the fanbase that “consistency” over time.\n\t\n\n\tIn her interview with Variety, Sharma acknowledged the tumultuous state of the gaming industry, referencing Matthew Ball’s recent State of Video Gaming in 2026 report as evidence that the larger “transformation” of the sector is “protecting what we believe in while remaining open‑minded about the future.”\n\n\tDue to her strong background in AI, initial reactions to Sharma’s appointment have raised concerns about what her specific views are on the use of generative AI in game development. Sharma says her stance is simple: she has “no tolerance for bad AI.”\n\n\t“AI has long been part of gaming and will continue to be,” Sharma said, noting that gaming needs new “growth engines,” but that “great stories are created by humans.”\n\n\tSpencer’s exit comes as Microsoft Gaming is approaching its 25th anniversary this fall, an event Sharma is looking forward to ushering in as she sets the stage for the company’s future. Sharma sees it as “a moment to honor the past while setting direction for the next chapter,” which will include big updates out of the upcoming GDC Festival of Gaming next March and even some larger announcements ahead of Xbox’s next Games Showcase presentation this spring.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLeonardo DiCaprio, Emma Stone and the independent Irish drama “Christy” were among the winners at the 2026 Irish Film and Television Awards, announced in Dublin on Friday.\n\n\tThe Brendan Canty-directed “Christy” (not to be confused with the Sydney Sweeney boxing drama of the same name) entered the night as the top-nominated title with 14 mentions and delivered in key races, winning best film, director and casting, along with editing and a supporting actor prize for Jamie Forde. The film follows a young man seeking independence after leaving the foster system.\n\t\n\n\tElsewhere in the film categories, “Hamnet” notched wins for best international film, lead actress for Oscar frontrunner Jessie Buckley, supporting actor for Paul Mescal and script for Maggie O’Farrell and Chloé Zhao. Other Oscar hopefuls that received notices in the international lead acting races ahead of Sunday’s BAFTA ceremony were Leonardo DiCaprio’s work as a former revolutionary in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” and Emma Stone, for her work as an executive who may or may not be an alien, in Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia.”\n\n\n\tAt the same time, Éanna Hardwicke took lead actor for “Saipan” while the double-nominated Kerry Condon prevailed with a supporting actress prize for Joseph Kosinski’s “F1.” \n\n\tOn the television side, “Blue Lights” won best TV drama, while Ailbhe Keogan won script for “Trespasses.” Anthony Boyle took lead actor in drama for “House of Guinness,” and Lola Petticrew won lead actress for “Trespasses.” Chris Walley won supporting actor for “The Young Offenders,” and Alison Oliver was named supporting actress for “Task.” Louisa Harland won the Rising Star Award.\n\t\n\n\t“Christy” and “Saipan” led the nominations heading into the ceremony, with “Saipan” earning 12. The ceremony also marked a record number of women nominated in directing categories, with seven across film and TV.\n\n\tThis year, Ciarán Hinds is set to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n\tThe list of winners is below.\n\n\tBest Film\n\n\n“Aontas”\n“Blue Moon”\n“Christy” (WINNER)\n“Four Mothers”\n“Saipan”\n“Steve”\n\n\n\n\tDirector – Film\n\n\nLisa Barros D’Sa, Glenn Leyburn — “Saipan”\nBrendan Canty — “Christy” (WINNER)\nMyrid Carten — “A Want in Her”\nLorcan Finnegan — “The Surfer”\nRuán Magan — “Báite”\nEdwin Mullane, Adam O’Keeffe — “Horseshoe”\n\n\n\n\tScript – Film\n\n\nSarah Gordon, Damian McCann — “Aontas”\nMaggie O’Farrell, Chloé Zhao — “Hamnet” (WINNER)\nAlan O’Gorman — “Christy”\nSheena Lambert — “Báite”\nDarren Thornton, Colin Thornton — “Four Mothers”\nEnda Walsh — “Die My Love”\n\n\n\n\tLead Actor – Film\n\n\nSteve Coogan — “Saipan”\nDaniel Day-Lewis — “Anemone”\nColin Farrell — “Ballad of a Small Player”\nÉanna Hardwicke — “Saipan” (WINNER)\nCillian Murphy — “Steve”\nDaniel Power — “Christy”\n\n\n\n\tLead Actress – Film\n\n\nJessie Buckley — “Hamnet” (WINNER)\nCarolyn Bracken — “Horseshoe”\nCarrie Crowley — “Aontas”\nFionnula Flanagan — “Four Mothers”\nEleanor O’Brien — “Báite”\nFiona Shaw — “Hot Milk”\n\n\n\n\tSupporting Actor – Film\n\n\nLiam Cunningham — “Palestine 36”\nJamie Forde — “Christy”\nPaul Mescal — “Hamnet” (WINNER)\nDiarmuid Noyes — “Christy”\nSeán T.

    "body": "\n\tNicole “Snooki” Polizzi, who first rose to fame as the star of MTV’s “Jersey Shore,” shared that she received a cervical cancer diagnosis. \n\n\t“My results came back for my cone biopsy, and it came back stage 1 cervical cancer called adenocarcinoma,” the reality star said in a nearly eight-minute long video posted to her TikTok account on Friday. “Obviously not the news that I was hoping for, but also not the worst news just because they caught it so early. Thank freaking God!”\n\t\n\n\tIn the video, Polizzi shared that she had been at a post-op appointment for a cone biopsy (a surgical procedure that removes tissue from the cervix to test for early-stage cervical cancer or precancerous cells) she’d had done earlier.  \n\n\n\tShe noted that she’d been “struggling with abnormal pap smears for three or four years now.” Earlier this year, Polizzi had shared on TikTok that her doctor had “found cancerous cells on the top of my cervix” following a colposcopy and biopsy. \n\n\t“That’s why I’m literally telling you guys to get your pap smears done. I’m 38 years old… and now look at me,” she said. “And instead of just putting it off because I didn’t want to go and it hurt and I was scared, no, I just went and did it. And it was there, cancer is in there. But it’s only stage 1 and it’s curable.”\n\n\t“So get your appointments done, bitches! I’m telling you,” she continued, noting that she’d likely need a hysterectomy and possible removal of her lymph nodes. “2026 is not panning out how I wanted it to, but also [it] could be worse.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tStellan Skarsgård didn’t know how special it was going to be. \n\n\tThe role, the film, and the unlikely awards journey that would follow. But sitting with the results — a first Academy Award nomination after more than 50 years in film — the Swedish actor wears the recognition with the same precision he brings to every performance.\n\n\tSkarsgård is nominated in the best supporting actor category for his role in Joachim Trier’s Norwegian-language drama “Sentimental Value,” in which he plays a Gustav Borg, a film director and a father navigating fractured family bonds alongside a cast that includes Renate Reinsve, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas and Elle Fanning. The film earned nine Oscar nominations in total, a remarkable reversal after being shut out of the Actor Awards (formerly SAG) entirely.\n\t\n\n\t“We got snubbed for the SAG Awards, and then suddenly we got nine nominations,” Skarsgård says. “That’s better.”\n\n\n\tHis performance is anchored in what he calls the film’s defining quality: everything that goes unspoken. “So much of this film is about what is not on screen — what is not in dialogue, not in the script,” he shares. “It’s all atmosphere, all our memories and personalities. Joachim extracts that from who we are and plays with it.”\n\n\tFor an actor who made his professional debut as a child, appeared in more than 200 film and television productions and collaborated with directors from Lars von Trier to Denis Villeneuve to Gus Van Sant, the nomination is a milestone and, he suggests, something of a surprise. \n\n\tAlthough he doesn’t have any projects lined up, he’s not idle. He is, as ever, watching, reading, thinking about people — which, he argues, is the entire point of cinema.\n\t\n\n\t“For thousands of years, people have been very much interested in people,” he says. “That curiosity will never leave us.”\n\n\tRead excerpts from his interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStellan Skarsgård in “Sentimental Value”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tYou received nine Academy Award nominations for “Sentimental Value” after being shut out of the SAG Awards entirely. How did you process that whiplash?\n\n\tIt feels good — better than not being one (a nominee). You have to be prepared for everything. There’s no way to predict these things. We got snubbed for the SAG Awards, and then suddenly we got nine nominations. That’s better.\n\n\tThis role has been called one of the finest of your career. What made it possible to reach something so singular?\n\n\tYou are allowed to say it’s one of the best roles of my career — if not the best. It’s not only the role as written on the page. It became what it became through Joachim’s way of letting me do my job as fully as possible. He’s watching everything, keeping it, editing it, making it better. It’s fantastic. I’m very lucky to have done this role.\n\n\tDid you sense in those early days on set that something special was happening?\n\n\tI didn’t know how special it was. I didn’t know how wonderful the other actors would be, and I didn’t know how great the connection we made would become. So much of this film is about what is not on screen — what is not in dialogue, not in the script. It’s all atmosphere, all our memories and personalities. Joachim extracts that from who we are and plays with it.\n\n\tYou grew up watching one film a week on Swedish television. Which early films stayed with you and shaped the actor you became?\n\n\tMy father always made sure I saw the best films: old films, black-and-white films, Italian neorealism, French New Wave. One of the films I really got hooked on was “Children of Paradise” — “Les Enfants du Paradis” by Marcel Carné.\n\n\tIn that film, Jean-Louis Barrault plays a mime artist in a theater company in early 19th century France. He’s performing onstage, and at the same time, the woman he loves is standing in the wings with another man. He sees it for the first time and understands she loves someone else. The way his face — thick with white makeup — cracked in that moment: That was wonderful for me.\n\t\n\n\tIt stands as an image of what you want to achieve. You want to see the cracks in the facade of people, and you can do that in cinema as in no other form.\n\n\tFor many American audiences, Lars von Trier’s films — “Breaking the Waves,” “Dancer in the Dark,” “Dogville,” “Melancholia” — were the introduction to your work. What was it like being in that world?\n\n\tHe said to me once, “Stellan, I know now what films I’m making.” I said, “Yeah? What films are you making, Lars?” He said, “I’m making the films that haven’t been made.” Yes, Lars. You’re doing that.\n\n\tEvery film is like nothing else, and that’s so wonderful. When I worked with him for the first time — I had made maybe 30 films at that point, I thought I knew filmmaking — here comes this guy and he breaks every rule. The way he cuts, the way he frames.\n\n\tHis first five films were beautiful but ice-cold because they were overthought, and the actors were given no freedom at all. But then he changed. On the set of “Breaking the Waves,” he had signs everywhere that said, “Make mistakes.” We could do anything we wanted.\n\n\tWhat he does is release the true life of the actor. Life is always irrational — you cannot plan it — and it’s in those irrational, surprising moments that true life comes through.\n\n\tDo you see parallels between Lars von Trier and Joachim Trier as filmmakers?\n\n\tYou’re absolutely right. On the most important thing, they are doing the same: letting you free, letting you bleed out your own emotions, and then using them brilliantly in the edit.\n\n\tLars von Trier is more story-oriented and perhaps less interested in the purely psychological surprises. But it’s the same fundamental thing. They are like two different painters working with different materials and different colors.\n\n\t“Good Will Hunting” introduced you to a generation of American audiences, including this interviewer. What do you remember of working with Robin Williams and Gus Van Sant?\n\n\tWith Gus, it was wonderful because he didn’t block the scenes. We blocked them ourselves in rehearsal, and then he said, “I’ll put the camera here — let’s start.” He took the first take and said, “Oh, good. I like that. Let’s do it again.” And then he said exactly the same thing for 10 takes.\n\t\n\n\tYou felt like he truly loved it — he just wanted to see more. And you get more courageous, you get new ideas, you want to try new things.\n\n\tRobin was all over the place, of course, because he couldn’t help improvising and doing wild things. His brain was constantly feeding him comic and dark ideas, like a waterfall showering over you. But what Gus got by doing 10 takes like that was incredible material. He could cut Robin into a very nasty guy if he wanted, a very funny guy, a very sad guy, or something in between.\n\n\tWhat was it like working alongside Renata Reinsve, Inga and Elle Fanning in “Sentimental Value?”\n\n\tRenate is an exceptional talent. She has a range and a depth that knocks everyone over who stands opposite her. I was glad to be able to live up to her.\n\n\tAnd then there’s Inga, who I had never seen before. She’s amazing. She almost does nothing, and yet she grows into the center of the film — not only the voice of reason, but the voice of love.\n\n\tAnd then Elle — a young woman with a background like mine, starting as a child actor. She came in wide open to these weird Norwegians and the weird Swede she’s going to work with, without any preconceived ideas about what it would be. And then she opens up totally and does very, very difficult things.\n\n\tShe’s playing an actress who is very good but not quite right — and that is very hard. I’m not saying much in that final scene. I was just looking at her. Watching her, it was heartbreaking.\n\n\tWhat is your feeling about the current state of cinema — and the growing presence of AI in the industry?\n\n\tFor thousands of years, people have been very much interested in people. Describing people is what theater does, what film does — and what we do best.\n\n\tIn film — even better than in television — you can describe all the unspoken words, all the unspoken facets of a relationship that are almost impossible to explain but are still there. We will always be curious about other people. That curiosity will never leave us.\n\n\tWhat form it takes, how it will be produced — maybe some people will be happy enough with what AI can produce, and some will not. But I think the main problem for the moving image industry today is the concentration of capital. And the concentration of capital is the problem for every industry, for humanity. AI is nothing without the men behind it. AI is owned by the tech barons standing right behind power.\n\t\n\n\tYou could have had a father-son Oscar moment this season with Alexander, who was on the circuit for “Pillion.” What was that time together like?\n\n\tWe were actually hoping Alexander would get nominated for “Pillion” so we could have been in the same category for the first time. I had so much fun with Alexander at the beginning of the season, when we were doing the awards circuit together — drinking, joking, watching films. It was a beautiful time, and I wish Bill had been part of it.\n\n\tAfter 50 years in film, what remains at the core of what you love about this work?\n\n\tI think it’s being on the set — creating something together with other people. I’m not really a monologue actor. I’m a dialogue actor. I take my energy from the other actors and give my energy back to them. I think what’s most interesting is what happens between people.\n\n\tBut I also like the crew. I know exactly what everyone’s different jobs are. I walk on set, I talk to people, I joke with them. I have this feeling of family around me that makes me more courageous.\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

    "body": "\n\tAnderson Cooper turned down an opportunity to keep working there. Stephen Colbert recently became vocal about his relationship with attorneys at the same company. And Seth Strickland, a UFC fighter, didn’t think the league’s critical ties to the corporation would suffer if he threw out some profanity and disparaged celebrities while trying to promote a coming bout on the conglomerate’s streaming service.\n\n\tThe business in question is Paramount Skydance, owner of CBS, Paramount+ and cable networks like MTV and Comedy Central. And just as the organization careens toward one of the more pivotal chapters in its short existence, it seems to have talent problems.\n\t\n\n\tWhile Paramount Skydance “may easily be able to sign up talent that appeals to a MAGA base, what will be PSKY’s ability to sign talent that appeals to a bigger and more profitable audience?” asked Blair Levin, a media analyst for New Street Research in a note issued earlier this week. He sees a parallel with events taking place at the Kennedy Center, which artists have deserted as President Trump has sought a heavier hand in the types of shows and events taking place there. “The dynamic of talent migration leading to customer migration and then repeating in a vicious cycle downward could be repeated,” he cautioned.\n\n\tParamount Skydance is in the midst of a seven day window during which it can make  a “best and final offer” in its effort to pry Warner Bros. Discovery out of an agreement already in place to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix, then spin off its TV assets into a separate publicly traded concern. The negotiating window with Paramount ends Monday, Feb. 23.  Netflix, which granted Warner a waiver to hold new talks with its rival, would have four days to make a counteroffer in the event Paramount puts forward a higher bid.\n\t\n\n\tWhile the scene has played out on Wall Street, the company hasn’t seemed, um, paramount in the minds of some of its key personalities. A spokesperson for Paramount Skydance did not immediately respond to a query seeking comment.\n\n\tAnderson Cooper on Monday surprised the industry by issuing a statement on his own that he planned to leave CBS News’ “60 Minutes” to focus on expanding duties at CNN and spend more time with his young children. Even so, the move has been interpreted in media circles as the result of dissatisfaction with how the venerable newsmagazine has been treated in recent months, with senior executives pressing the show to cut back on its hard-news and investigative stories. One such segment  —  a piece by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi — was delayed for a few weeks by the new editor in chief of CBS News, Bari Weiss, after she said it required more response from Trump administration officials. When the story aired, it did so without edits, though some commentary was added in a preamble and an afterword.\n\n\tHaving an anchor walk off a major news program without a statement at the ready by the news division or its corporate parent is exceedingly rare. CBS News required nearly four hours to respond to news of Cooper’s exit — a sign that it was unexpected. CBS later said that for Cooper, “’60 Minutes’ will be here if he ever wants to return.”\n\n\tLater that evening, Stephen Colbert took the company to task. In remarks delivered on his February 16th program, the late-night host told viewers that network executives told him an interview with Democratic Texas Senate candidate James Talarico should not run on CBS, due to concerns it would run afoul of new guidance from the Trump administration that would hold talk shows to what is known as TV’s “equal time” rule, which requires broadcast networks and radio stations to give equal time to candidates in an election after one has made an appearance.\n\n\t“I was told, in some uncertain terms, that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on,” Colbert said. The show subsequently made the interview  made available on YouTube.\n\n\tCBS pushed back on the matter, noting later that Colbert and his staff were given “legal guidance” but were not “prohibited” from broadcasting the interview. This sparked another round, with Colbert retorting Tuesday that “I don’t even know what to do with this crap.”\n\t\n\n\tStrickland, who has developed a reputation for making outrageous statements, dropped some more Wednesday, hurling insults and offensive language at Bad Bunny and female athletes such as Ronda Rousey. He made the remarks during a media event to tout a UFC fight streaming Saturday on Paramount+\n\n\tParamount hasn’t been shy about its zeal to align itself with the Trump administration. But doing so may make its operations harder to monetize, says Levin, in his research note. “Telling talent that management’s top priority is to please governmental officials is a sure path to redirect them to entertainment platforms where management prioritizes supporting talent that knows how to attract customers,” he says.\n\n\tIn decades past, talent squabbles largely took place behind the scenes, but Parmount executives must realize that anchors, actors and sportscasters feel increasingly empowered to on screen and tell viewers when they are unhappy with the TV life. Pat McAfee, the colorful ESPN commentator and Rachel Maddow, the studious MS Now news analyst, would seem to have little in common. Both, however, have taken their media employers to task with blunt language on screen. So too have Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski and Chuck Todd, among others.\n\n\tWhat gives the talent such confidence in criticism? Perhaps the rise of social media and creator forums like newsletters and video podcasts, where telling it like it is (or at least appearing to) is the tone of the day. Paramount Skydance should probably expect more of the same in months to come — even when the company is not trying to put its best foot forward to acquire a major media property.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Schilling has been cast in the lead role of the NBC drama pilot “What the Dead Know,” Variety has learned. \n\n\tThe pilot was picked up at NBC in January and is executive produced by NBC cornerstone Dick Wolf. It is based on the memoir of the same name by former New York City medical examiner Barbara Butcher. The logline for the show states, “Death Investigator Ava Ledger (Schilling) is really good with dead bodies. It’s the living that give her trouble. ‘What the Dead Know’ follows Ava as she teams with the NYPD to solve their toughest cases.” \n\t\n\n\tSchilling is best known for her role as Piper Chapman in the groundbreaking Netflix series “Orange Is the New Black.” Her work in the show earned her an Emmy nomination and two Golden Globe nominations. She has since appeared in shows like “Dear Edward” at Apple TV, “Pam & Tommy” at Hulu, “Poker Face” at Peacock, and the AMC animated series “Pantheon.” Schilling has also been seen in films like “Family,” “The Lucky One,” and “Argo.” \n\n\n\tShe is repped by Gersh, Untitled, and Goodman Genow.\n\n\t“What the Dead Know” is being written and executive produced by Beth Rinehart. Wolf executive produces via Wolf Entertainment along with Tom Thayer, Peter Jankowski, and Anastasia Puglisi. Kevin Plunkett, Rebecca McGill, and Butcher are co-executive producers. Universal Television, where Wolf is under an overall deal, will produce. \n\n\tWith the casting, NBC has set leads for all of its drama pilots this season. As previously announced, David Boreanaz will lead the network’s attempt to reboot “The Rockford Files,” while fellow “Bones” alum Emily Deschanel will star in an untitled criminal profiler drama pilot. In addition, Damon Wayans Jr. will star in the pilot “Puzzled” about a man with Acquired Savant Syndrome. The NBC drama pilot “Protection,” which is described as an ensemble, recently cast Peter Krause in a major role. \n",

    "body": "\n\tFor the BDSM drama “Pillion,” Harry Melling traded the world of wizarding for one of leather, licking boots and orgies in the wilderness.\n\n\tBest known for playing Dudley Dursley in the “Harry Potter” films, the actor, now 36, takes on his first true leading role in Harry Lighton’s unorthodox romance. In the film, Melling plays Colin, a shy meter maid and barbershop quartet singer who catches the attention of Ray (Alexander Skarsgård), a stoic motorcyclist looking for a “sub” to fulfill his sexual (and domestic) desires.\n\t\n\n\tSoon, Colin is cooking meals and doing chores for Ray. They don’t kiss, and Ray makes him sleep on the floor by the bed like a dog. It might sound degrading, but when Colin appears midway through the movie in a leather biking outfit and shaved head, he looks liberated.\n\n\n\tBelow, Melling talks to Variety about the year’s kinkiest rom-com, getting comfortable with Skarsgård and why he has never consciously tried to escape the long shadow of Hogwarts.\n\t\n\t\tDid you have any hesitations when you first read the script?\t\n\n\tI kind of went in with no fear, to be honest. I think I would have been nervous if the sex scenes — or the more risky, out-there moments — weren’t grounded in the storytelling. If they’d just been interludes meant to be sexy, I think I would have felt quite nervous about that.\n\n\tBut when I read the script, I always felt those scenes were genuinely pushing the narrative forward. They tell the story very intricately — Colin’s journey from inexperience to experience — and because they were so embedded in the narrative, they felt like a continuation of the acting process rather than a moment designed to create a “beautiful love scene,” if you know what I mean.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat do you make of the studies that say Gen Z rejects sex scenes?\t\n\n\tWith a movie like “Pillion,” if you take the sex out of it, you don’t have a movie. The sex, the expression of it and the way it helps build the characters and their stories is so pivotal to the DNA of the film. I can’t really comment on the idea of a younger generation rejecting sex scenes. I’m 36 now, and in my experience of going to the movies, sex has always featured in some way. Maybe the question is more about how sex is being portrayed — perhaps that’s what’s shifting. I haven’t seen “Heated Rivalry” yet, but obviously in the states it has blown up. Maybe there’s something about sex being articulated in a different way now than it was before.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPILLION, Harry Melling, 2025. © A24 /Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen you choose roles, is there an appeal to go for projects that feel dangerous and exciting in order to shed the “Harry Potter” thing?\t\n\n\tIt’s never been something I’ve thought about directly. I’ve never said to myself, This is a good decision because it pushes me further away from how people might have seen me when I was younger. That’s not really how I operate. In fact, when I try to think strategically, it always backfires in some way.\n\n\tWhat I am looking for is variety. I’m always looking for new challenges and for as rich and varied a career as I can possibly have. And I know this sounds strange, but I’ve felt that way since I was about 10 years old, when I started doing the “Potter” films. Trying to deliberately maneuver away from “Harry Potter” would probably hinder me, because I’d be too aware of what I’m coming from. It’s far better to live in a kind of ignorance and just follow your nose — to pursue the work that genuinely excites you.\n\t\n\t\tYou and Alexander Skarsgård met only a couple of days before filming. How did you build trust in each other?\t\n\n\tI had done a week of filming prior to when Alex flew in. We met on a Saturday, and on Sunday we rehearsed the wrestling scene. We basically jumped on each other and worked that out, into the intimate scene. Then on Monday, we started shooting. It really was: “bish, bash, bosh — here we go.”\n\n\tFor my character especially, it was kind of incredible for that reason. Colin is always second-guessing Ray’s behavior — how do I please this man? What does he want? Am I in the right place? All of those thoughts are constantly running through his head. The fact that we hadn’t had months beforehand to sit down and talk through how we’d play the roles or what backstories we’d each imagined was actually really useful. It meant that what we were discovering happened in real time, on set, in front of the camera. It was a happy accident — not by design at all, just a logistical necessity because Alex was away — but it worked in our favor.\n\t\n\n\tWe also worked with an incredible intimacy coordinator, Robbie Taylor Hunt, who was instrumental in shaping those scenes. In many ways, his role is like that of a stunt director. It’s about camera placement, angles, physical positioning — the practical details that help sell a moment on screen — but also about protecting the narrative beats of the story. He was pivotal in making sure those scenes served the characters and the arc.\n\t\n\t\tIt’s funny to hear about how some of the sexiest scenes are filmed in very unsexy ways.\t\n\n\tOh, big time. If you saw some of the outtakes from the alleyway scene, where I’m giving Alex a blowjob, I was completely at the wrong angle. It looked hilarious. Hopefully, in the edit, the thrill of it comes across. But in the doing of it, it’s often just about nailing those small adjustments and technical details that help sell the sex of it.\n\t\n\t\tSome of the sex scenes are quite funny and elicit laughs, but the movie doesn’t mock the sexual subculture. How did you straddle that line between shock value and respect?\t\n\n\tA huge part of doing that was working with the GBMCC — the Gay Bikers Motorcycle Club. They’re a real organization, and they were in the film, playing the pillions and bikers, but they were also central to our research. They introduced me to people in the kink scene who taught me about things like bootlicking. They were a pivotal part of making the film feel authentic. A lot of them came to Cannes when the film premiered, and they seemed genuinely thrilled with the film. That was such an important thing, that they felt their story was represented on screen.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPILLION, from left: Alexander Skarsgard, Harry Melling, 2025. © A24 /Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOne of the things I enjoyed about the film is that Colin’s parents are incredibly supportive of him and set him up on dates with men. But they feel, justifiably, protective and slightly uncomfortable with his dynamic with Ray.\t\n\n\tThe parents’ journey in the film is almost the opposite of the norm. They start from a place of absolute acceptance. They’re almost overly supportive, suffocating Colin in certain ways — “Have you got a boyfriend yet?” and all of that. As the story progresses and they begin to understand — or not understand — Ray and the nature of the relationship, they shift. They don’t deny the relationship, but they challenge it. \n\t\n\n\tThe Sunday dinner scene was always one of the most important in the script for me, because it’s where all the perspectives coexist in one space. You’ve got Peggy, who’s deeply questioning the relationship and who Ray is and what his intentions are. You’ve got the dad trying to stay in the middle, keeping the peace. And then you’ve got Ray saying, “It’s a consensual relationship. Colin knows what this is. This is how it works. What’s the problem?”\n\n\tIt’s been fascinating talking to audiences in Q&As, because that’s the scene where people really divide. Some are firmly on Team Peggy; others are on Team Ray, asking what Peggy’s problem is — they’re happy, it’s working. For Colin, that confrontation becomes the catalyst for the final act. It’s the moment that pushes him to question the dynamic Ray has established and say, “Actually, I think I need more. I want more from this relationship.”\n\t\n\t\tWhen the relationship ends, Colin has developed a sense of what he wants and the ability to express that. Have you had similar moments in your career, of coming out of a project with newfound knowledge about yourself?\t\n\n\tSometimes there are things that linger; characteristics that hover and stay with you for a while after you finish. “Pillion” was the first film where I’m in nearly every scene and every shot, which is a very different beast for me. What stayed with me was Colin’s optimism and his curiosity — those are the things that really lingered. I felt like a much more receptive human being for a long while, because I was still in Colin’s pursuit of understanding, his wanting to put himself together. When I finished playing Edgar Allan Poe in “The Pale Blue Eye,” it had a different kind of after-effect — a quite sad one, given the ending of that film. Every movie is somewhat different in terms of the place it leaves you.\n\t\n\t\tWhat feedback have you gotten so far on “Pillion”? Have you talked to people in sub/Dom relationships?\t\n\n\tA lot of the Q&As we’ve been doing, particularly in the U.K., have been fascinating. We spoke to one woman after a screening who was really interested in talking about consent — about how in some relationships, a contract is drawn up to establish the rules, and how that didn’t happen in “Pillion.” It’s interesting, because there are just so many different versions of how these relationships can work. A lot of people come up to me and say, “I understand Colin” or “I felt like I was Colin” — and that, to me, is really moving, that they feel they can share that with me.\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed. “Pillion” is in theaters now.\n",

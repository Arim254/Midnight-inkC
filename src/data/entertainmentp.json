    "body": "\n\tA two-decade-old dream is finally coming true for director Quentin Tarantino. The “Kill Bill” chapter known as “Yuki’s Revenge” is coming to life in Fortnite.\n\n\tThe animated short will also head to the big screen as part of an exclusive limited theatrical run of “Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair.”\n\n\tTarantino’s “The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge” stars Uma Thurman, who returns as The Bride, and runs eight minutes. Tarantino and Thurman worked with Epic Games’ Unreal Engine, and used motion capture technology to transfer her performance into the gaming platform.\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking at his Vista Theater in Los Angeles at a special launch event, Tarantino explained how Fortnite and Epic Games came to be the perfect fit for “The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge.”\n\n\n\tHe said, “They got together with me to talk about some situation where my characters and Fortnite do something kind of groovy. So I show up at the meeting thinking that we’re just going to talk about that they want to license the characters, and they want to get my ideas about what will be a fun thing to do.”\n\n\tAs it turns out, the powers that be at Epic Games had other ideas in mind. Rather than license his characters, they wanted to see if he had something in the eight to 12 minute range “that could be good for our purposes and make sure your iconic characters are wrapped up inside this.”\n\n\tAs it turned out, Tarantino did have something.\n\n\tHe had an entire chapter that existed in the original first draft of “Kill Bill.” “It never even made second drafts,” Tarantino revealed.\n\n\tHe explained that in the chapter, Gogo (Chiaki Kuriyama) had a twin sister and had the sniffles that night at the House of Blue Leaves and leaves early. \n\t\n\n\tDue to pacing concerns, it never made the film. “It was too crazy, too violent, and just too much action,” Tarantino said.\n\n\tHe sent the script along. Tarantino said. “I actually thought maybe the ship had sailed as far as, like doing new material. I was wrong.” He added, “When I wrote the first draft of the script, there was a lost chapter that, frankly, I just didn’t think we could pull off. And Yuki has been a figment of my imagination for over 20 years.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Epic Games\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThurman surprised audiences when she joined Tarantino to explain how motion capture technology helped her bring The Bride to Fortnite.\n\n\tUnreal Engine’s technology renders characters in real time. In capturing performances, it can test poses and expressions and see what reads the best. And when it came to getting the voiceover, the team had facial data from the actors to help animate.\n\n\t“It’s so novel to wear the camera on your head, but I completely forgot about it; just started to live in the moments of the scenes we were doing,” said Thurman.\n\n\tAs for this new way of bringing “Kill Bill” to audiences and telling the story of Yuki’s revenge, Thurman said she found it cool.  “This is a new audience for the movie.” She went on to say, “It’s really moving. It’s really great, and I think it’s something meant to be.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Epic Games\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLionsgate opens Tarantino’s‘ “The Whole Bloody Affair,” the four-hour cut (281 minutes with a 15 minute intermission) that combines “Kill Bill Vol. 1” and “Kill Bill Vol. 2″ into a single feature, in theaters on Dec. 5.\n\n\tThurman stars as The Bride, left for dead after her former boss and lover Bill ambushes her wedding rehearsal, shooting her in the head and stealing her unborn child. To exact her vengeance, she must first hunt down the four remaining members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad before confronting Bill himself. \n\n\n\n\n\t“The Whole Bloody Affair” stars Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Gordon Liu, Michael Parks, and David Carradine as Bill. Produced by Lawrence Bender, it’s written and directed by Tarantino, and is based on the character of “The Bride” created by Q&U (Quentin and Uma).\n\n\tWith the crossover, Tarantino said, “I want both the ‘Kill Bill’ fan and the Fortnite fan to be totally effing happy about this collaboration.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tGuy Pearce issued an apology on Thursday for sharing “misinformation and falsehoods” about Israel on social media while supporting Palestine online.\n\n\t“It has been brought to my attention that, in my support of Palestine, I have inadvertently re-posted articles, and/or statements, that have contained misinformation and falsehoods,” Pearce told Jewish News. “I am aware how sharing inaccurate content can cause confusion and distress; for this I am deeply sorry. I will certainly endeavour to be more diligent in future to verify anything I share online.”\n\t\n\n\tAccording to Jewish News, “The Brutalist” star shared material online featuring the highly controversial far-right political commentator and white nationalist Nick Fuentes. He also reportedly shared material that blamed Israel for the 9/11 terrorist attacks, accused Israeli officials of facilitating the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and claimed the “top three pornography companies are owned by Jewish people.”\n\n\n\tJewish News also reports that Pearce shared a post in early November that read, “Remember, when Zionists tell you Islam will destroy America… While several major Las Vegas casinos/hotels that have caused gambling addictions, debt and prostitution were created and owned by Jewish Zionists… The Zionists (not Jews) want you to fear the people who stand against the corruption they are creating.”\n\n\tEarly Saturday morning, Pearce shared a statement on X to announce he’s taking a break from social media in the wake of the backlash.\n\n\t“Earlier this week, I issued an apology for sharing misleading and inaccurate posts and commentary on social media,” he wrote. “I meant every word of that apology but I recognize that meaningful action must accompany any apology. To prevent any further hurt, confusion or damage to others, I will be stepping back from social media for the time being.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you think the people in your life are hard to shop for, they likely have nothing on the many quirky characters we’ve seen on screen this year. As the holidays approach, it got us thinking: what would we gift some of our favorite film and TV characters?\n\n\t For the Lorazepam-popping Victoria Ratliff in “The White Lotus”? Perhaps a trusty travel pill case to salvage her disappearing pills. For ex-revolutionary Bob Ferguson in “One Battle After Another? We’d recommend a Houseplant ashtray set, the perfect companion for a scruffy stoner.\n\n\n\tBelow, look through a few of the gifts we’d buy some of the most iconic characters we’ve seen this year — from Deborah Vance to Dr. Michael Robby:\n\t\n\t\tVictoria Ratliff in ‘The White Lotus’\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStefano Delia/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Lorazepam-popping matriarch of the Ratliff family will certainly appreciate a trusty container for her disappearing pharmaceuticals. But if she still can’t get to sleep, she might appreciate one of the many nighttime rituals offered through a Headspace subscription. A breezy beach read, like one from Taylor Jenkins Reid, is also a must. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tBob Ferguson in ‘One Battle After Another’\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDiCaprio’s Bob Ferguson is one of the most devoted stoners we’ve seen in film since Jeff Lubowski.

    "body": "\n\tJodie Foster was honored with a tribute award at the Marrakech Film Festival on Saturday, where she gave a touching speech in which she reminisced on her six decades in cinema.\n\n\tAfter a reel played showing some of her most famous roles, including “The Silence of the Lambs” and “Panic Room,” Foster graciously accepted her trophy on stage.\n\n\t“Watching all these clips, I thought to myself: I’ve been doing this job for quite a while now,” Foster said, after picking up the award from the hands of Bong Joon Ho and joking that she was going to ask him for an autograph. “I started in the 1960s, then I was lucky enough to experience the golden age of cinema in the 1970s. Then came the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and now we’re back in the 1970s again.”\n\t\n\n\tFoster added, “It’s been a very long time indeed. And yet, it’s gone by in the blink of an eye. And here I am, a little older, perhaps a little freaked out, but guided by the same love of storytelling, of bringing characters to life, of asking questions about our connections, our fragilities, our humanity.”\n\n\n\tShe ended her speech on a gracious note, saying that her “greatest success in life is being happy.”\n\n\t“And really, even in a very silly way, I am deeply happy,” she said. “And as the movie said, life is beautiful.”\n\n\tBefore Foster accepted the award, her “Taxi Driver” director, Martin Scorsese, surprised her with a video message during the ceremony. “I want to congratulate you on this honor tonight in Marrakech. I only wish I could be there. You’re such an important part of my work and my career,” he said. “There’s a joy in your work that you’ve created since before you could walk, actually … I’ll never forget the memory of you walking into my office at 8 or 9 years old and having more pull than anyone else in the studio at the time.”\n\t\n\n\tThe two-time Oscar winner was on hand at the Moroccan fest to introduce her latest film, “A Private Life,” directed by Rebecca Zlotowski, who was also in attendance. In the French comedy thriller, which world premiered at Venice Film Festival earlier this year, Foster plays a Parisian psychiatrist whose life is upended by the death of one of her patients. Convinced that her patient was murdered, she launches her own investigation into the matter with the help of her ex-husband.\n\n\tThis marks Foster’s first appearance at Marrakech Film Festival, which kicked off on Friday night with a slew of stars in attendance. “Parasite” filmmaker Bong is serving as the president of this year’s jury, alongside big names including “Wednesday” star Jenna Ortega, “Furiosa” lead Anya Taylor-Joy and “Past Lives” director Celine Song.\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety on the red carpet ahead of the opening ceremony, festival head Melita Toscan du Plantier said Foster, who arrived a few days ago, “loves Morocco and wants to come back on vacation.”\n\n\t“She’s very shy and she’s not much of a red carpet person, but she’s thrilled to be here and we’re very happy to have her,” Toscan du Plantier added.\n\n\t“Frankenstein” director Guillermo del Toro is also being honored at the festival with a tribute award next week. He and Foster will both participate in conversations at the fest, as will “The Secret Agent” filmmaker Kleber Mendonça Filho, AMPAS CEO Bill Kramer, “The Matrix” star Laurence Fishburne, “It Was Just an Accident” Palme d’Or winner Jafar Panahi and “Blonde” director Andrew Dominik.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story discusses major plot points, including the ending and the post-credits scenes, for “Zootopia 2,” currently playing in theaters.\n\n\t“Zootopia’s” rookie cops Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) are back.\n\n\tIn the film’s sequel, “Zootopia 2,” the duo come face-to-face with a mysterious pit viper, Gary De’Snake (voiced by Ke Huy Quan). As they try to solve the mystery of Gary De’Snake, they’re led on an investigation to uncover a hidden reptile population.\n\t\n\n\tThe premise of the film gave co-directors Jared Bush and Byron Howard a perfect opportunity to pay homage to great horror classics, including “The Shining” and “The Silence of the Lambs.”\n\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety, Bush and Howard confessed their adoration for Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film. The plot of “Zootopia 2” gave them room to flesh out an idea.\n\n\tIn the film, the Lynxley family — a group of lynxes, natch, include Milton Lynxley (voiced by David Strathairn), the wealthy family patriarch, who, along with his family, Cattrick (Macaulay Culkin), Kitty (Brenda Song) and Pawbert (Andy Samberg), try to keep the truth about the city’s history from coming out.\n\n\tBush says, “We had this idea of these lynxes that were obviously the villains, and it made sense to have this grand manor, and then this giant maze in the back of it.”\n\n\t“The Shining” idea came in a very early draft. As much as they loved the idea, neither thought about how hard it would be for their animators and VFX team to pull off. The animators didn’t just have to build a maze with millions of leaves, it would have to be covered in snow. Taking the idea a step further, Bush says, “Then we said, ‘Instead of Nick and Judy running through it, what’s happened is we’re going to take a giant Snowcat and smash the crap out of it.’”\n\t\n\n\tAll those steps gave the visual effects team a challenge. “They have to rig [the animation] to be destroyed,” says Bush. “It’s not like you can destroy anything you like. All of the destruction also has to be built into the design and figure out the exact path of that Snowcat.”\n\n\tPay close attention to the end credits — the animators who worked on the Snowcat vehicle destroying the maze are given full credit as “Destruction Leads.” Aside from creating the maze and covering it in snow, Pawbert limps his way through the maze, very much in homage to Jack Nicholson’s character.\n\n\t“Pawbert had to be animated moving through the space,” Bush says.\n\n\tDifferent animators had been locked in months in advance, each with the task of working on their respective shots. However, Disney animator Louaye Moulayess was a die-hard fan of the film. On the day that sequence was being assigned out, Moulayess showed up to the animation offices wearing a t-shirt from “The Shining.” He made a plea and said, “You must give me this shot.”\n\n\tMoulayess’ plea was successful. He was given the task of animating Pawbert in the maze. “He disappeared and came back a week later, which is just unhinged Pawbert as Jack Nicholson, and just incredible,” says Bush.\n\n\tThe first time the duo saw the finished scene was during the lighting review.\n\n\tHoward says, “It’s where you got all the effects, animation, grooming, wind and fur. You see the incredible light and shot from behind when he’s limping through the maze, and you see the snow falling. We were just cracking up. It’s amazing.”\n\n\tThe icing on the cake was composer Michael Giacchino’s score. Bush says, “He took that theme which is so famous, and the second you hear it, you know exactly where you’re at. Marry that with his incredible score and his Lynxley villain theme…when we were on the scoring stage for that, the lower brass asked, ‘How hard do you want us to hit this?’ And he was like, ‘Everything you got.’”\n\n\tWhile the scene will likely fly over any child’s head, Howard says they had to keep their core audience in mind. “They’ll think, ‘That guy is unhinged, and he’s the bad guy, and I want our heroes to get him, and that’s all you need.” And if they find that confusing, “There’s a 5,000-pound Snowcat about to plow through that maze that will bring the clarity back to the kids.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The Shining” isn’t the only nod Bush and Howard make to classic horror films. \n\n\tWhen Nick is briefly in jail, the duo didn’t skip the opportunity to pay homage to Jonathan Demme’s “The Silence of the Lambs.” Bellwether is in one of the cells, and her scene is reminscent of Anthony Hopkins’ Hannibal Lecter.\n\n\tHowever, the pair did know when they had to pull back. “That scene used to be four minutes long,” says Bush. “We did word by word the first scene when Hannibal Lecter meets Clarice, all the way down to the guard saying, ‘All the way down the left, stay to the right.'” But they realized it was too much. “That’s where we go, and now we have lost our younger audience members.”\n",

    "description": "Playwright and screenwriter Tom Stoppard, a four-time Tony winner for his plays “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,” “Travesties,” “The Real Thing",
    "body": "Playwright and screenwriter Tom Stoppard, a four-time Tony winner for his plays “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,” “Travesties,” “The Real Thing” and “The Coast of Utopia” and an Oscar winner for his script to “Shakespeare in Love,” has died, according to The BBC. He was 88. \n“We’re deeply saddened to announce that our beloved client and friend, Tom Stoppard, has died peacefully at home in Dorset, surrounded by his family,” United Agents told Sky News. “He’ll be remembered for his works, for their brilliance and humanity, and for his wit, his irreverence, his generous spirit and his profound love of the English language.”\n\t\nStoppard, who fled Czechoslovakia as a child during Nazi rule and eventually settled in England, was a master stylist of language, perhaps best known for his clever wordplay. Writing for the stage, screen and radio, he explored themes such as betrayal, politics and identity, the last of which was heavily influenced by his own experience of belonging to two cultures. The adjective “Stoppardian” was coined to describe work that uses wit and comedy to further philosophical themes.\nStoppard broke into the British theater scene in 1966 with his play “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,” about two minor characters in Shakespeare’s “Hamlet.” His tendency toward comedy and verbal gymnastics, however, made Stoppard a target — albeit a respected one — of critics early in his career.\n“Stoppard’s plays have been sometimes dismissed as pieces of clever showmanship, lacking in substance, social commitment, or emotional weight,” said critic Dennis Kennedy.\n\t\nNot until later plays such as “The Real Thing” (1982) and “Arcadia” (1993) did Stoppard really delve into emotional depths, which he allowed to mingle with, if not subsume, his dazzling wordplay.\n“Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead” drew mixed notices at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1966 but went on to be produced by the National Theater Company at the Old Vic and later on Broadway, where Stoppard earned his first Tony for best play in 1968. Stoppard also adapted the script for a 1990 film of the same name that won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.\nIn the 1970s, Stoppard found success with “Jumpers” (1972), a satire about the field of academic philosophy, which is compared to a gymnastics competition; and “Travesties” (1974), about a chance meeting in 1917 Zurich between Vladimir Lenin, James Joyce and Dadaist Tristan Tzara. Both plays earned kudos in the U.K., and “Travesties” went on to claim a Tony in 1976.\nDuring the 1970s, Stoppard tweaked political philosophies and language in plays such as “Every Good Boy Deserves Favour” (1977), about Soviet dissidents, and “Night and Day” (1978), about journalistic ethics; “The Real Thing” (1982), a play within a play about adultery, moved critics to declare that Stoppard had touched a nerve and written something much more personal than his previous work. In 1984, he won the Tony for “The Real Thing,” which garnered another Tony in 2000 for play revival.\nDuring the 1990s, his plays “Arcadia” and “The Invention of Love” (1997) drew kudos. “The Coast of Utopia,” Stoppard’s 2002 trilogy of plays, delved into the lives of people during pre-revolution Russia between 1833 and 1866. The plays, which totaled nine hours onstage, were directed by Trevor Nunn and played in repertory at London’s Olivier Theater. The opus moved to Broadway in 2006 and won the Tony for best play in 2007.\nStoppard followed that achievement with “Rock ’n’ Roll” (2006), another look at artistic dissent against the Soviets, this time in his native Czechoslovakia between the Prague Spring of 1968 and the Velvet Revolution in 1989. Mixing politics with music, Stoppard’s characters question a repressive regime and so-called Soviet ideals.\nAfter an absence of nine years, Stoppard returned in 2015 with the uber-cerebral play “The Hard Problem,” the title of which refers to the question of whether matter can be separated from consciousness. Reviewing the London production, the New York Times’ Ben Brantley said the play is neither dull nor clumsy — “There are more than flickers of the lightning wit and intellectual energy you associate with Mr. Stoppard. But it’s the first work I have known from this ever-questing dramatist in which the ideas overwhelm the characters.”\n\t\nBut while the playwright generally delved into more personal matters in his later career, whether it was marriage or cultural identity, Stoppard still resisted self-examination. “That part of yourself in your work is expressed willy-nilly, without your cooperation, motivation or collusion,” he told U.K. newspaper The Guardian in 2008. “You can’t help being what you write and writing what you are.”\nOn the film front, Stoppard co-wrote the Oscar-nominated script for “Brazil” (1985) and adapted J.G. Ballard’s novel for Steven Spielberg’s “Empire of the Sun” (1987). In addition to “Shakespeare in Love,” screenplays since 1990 included adaptations of John le Carre’s “The Russia House,” E.L. Doctorow’s “Billy Bathgate,” Robert Harris’ novel “Enigma” and Tolstoy’s “Anna Karenina.” The last of these, released in 2012, was a stylized, expressionist take on the Russian classic set mostly in a mocked-up theater that divided the critics. For HBO, he adapted Ford Madox Ford’s novel “Parade’s End” into a well-reviewed 2012 miniseries starring Benedict Cumberbatch, on which he also served as an executive producer. He followed these projects with an adaptation of Deborah Moggach’s bestselling romance novel “Tulip Fever.”\nStoppard also worked as an uncredited script doctor in Hollywood, working on films including “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” (George Lucas and Spielberg wanted him to pen the fourth entry in the franchise), “Star Wars: Episode III — Revenge of the Sith,” “Sleepy Hollow” and “K-19: The Widowmaker.”Stoppard was born in Zlin, Czechoslovakia, the son of a Jewish doctor with the Bata shoe company. Shortly before the Nazi occupation, Bata owner Thomas J. Bata helped transfer his Jewish employees to other branches of his business all over the world.\nOn March 15, 1939, the day the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia, Stoppard’s family fled to Singapore. Before the Japanese occupation of Singapore, Tomas, his mother and his brother, Petr, fled once again, while their father stayed and served as a physician.\nIt was not until more than 50 years later that Stoppard found out that his father had drowned in February 1942 after the ship he was on was bombed by the Japanese. At the time, the then 5-year-old Stoppard was arriving in Bombay with his mother and brother to begin life as an English-speaking family.\n\t\nMoving from Bombay to Darjeeling, Stoppard’s mother met and married British citizen Major Kenneth Stoppard in 1945 before heading to England the following year. Both boys took his name.\nUsing his signature wordplay to refer to himself as a “bounced Czech,” Stoppard relayed, in a 1999 Talk magazine article, that his late stepfather believed that “to be born an Englishman was to have drawn first prize in the lottery of life.”\nStoppard did indeed embrace his Britishness, attending boarding school in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire and excelling at cricket. An average student, Stoppard opted not to attend a university, instead joining the Western Daily Press in Bristol as a journalist at age 17.\nDuring his work as a reporter and drama critic, Stoppard met actor Peter O’Toole and became friendly with people who worked at the Bristol Old Vic Theater. He then moved to London in 1962 to become a full-time writer, combining work as a journalist with writing for radio and TV, and wrote the novel “Lord Malquist and Mr. Moon.”\nThe Writers Guild of America honored Stoppard with its Laurel Award for Screen for lifetime achievement in writing for motion pictures in February 2013.\nHe is survived by his wife, Sabrina Guinness, and his four sons, Oliver, digital artist Barny, Bill and actor Ed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTheater owners are surely giving thanks to “Zootopia 2” and “Wicked: For Good,” which delivered a much-needed one-two punch to the Black Friday box office.\n\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” led the pack with a stellar $38.5 million from 4,000 domestic theaters on Friday. That brings the North American count to $97.7 million since its debut on Wednesday. Box office prophets predict the animated sequel will gross upwards of $155 million over the first five days of release. While unable to dethrone “Moana 2” as the highest Thanksgiving week earner of all time ($225 million over five days), anything above $150 million would slot “Zootopia 2” well over Turkey Day power grossers like “Frozen II” ($125 million over five days) and “Hunger Games: Catching Fire” ($109 million in the same time frame).\n\t\n\n\tDirected by Jared Bush and Byron Howard, “Zootopia 2” sees the return of unlikely police duo Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) as they investigate the presence of a reptilian outsider (Ke Huy Quan) in their mammal-centric metropolis.\n\n\n\tIn second place is “Wicked: For Good,” which took home $26 million in its second Friday at the domestic box office from 4,115 theaters. That makes for a 62% decline from its $68.6 million debut last Friday. Jon M. Chu’s musical sequel has grossed $226.6 million at the domestic box office so far, and is projected to land somewhere around $270 million at the end of the five-day holiday frame.\n\n\t“Eternity,” a fantasy romance from A24, opened in sixth place on Friday, earning an estimated $1.1 million from 1,348 locations. That brings the domestic total to around $3.1 million since Wednesday. From director David Freyne, the film stars Elizabeth Olsen and Miles Teller as a married couple who reunite in the afterlife, only to have their relationship challenged by an old flame, played by Callum Turner.\n\t\n\n\tIn its sophomore outing, “Rental Family,” starring Brendan Fraser as an expat actor working in Japan as a stand-in father for a young girl, landed in seventh place $800,000 in North America, according to rival estimates. The Searchlight Pictures release sat well with critics and audiences (86% on Rotten Tomatoes and “A” grade on CinemaScore), which could help earnings through the holiday season.\n\n\tChloé Zhao’s awards hopeful “Hamnet” opened in a limited release on Wednesday before it goes wide in December. The film earned $300,000 domestically from 119 locations. Starring Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley as William and Agnes Shakespeare, respectively, the film chronicles the creation of the tragedy of “Hamlet.” The film is expected to compete for 11 categories come Oscar time, including best picture, best director, best actress and best actor.  \n\n\tAt No. 3 was “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” the third installment in the magical heist series. The film earned an estimated $2.6 million domestically on Friday. The film looks to add $10 million through Sunday for a North American total of $49 million. “Predator: Badlands” took fourth, hunting down $1.8 million domestically on Friday. The film has earned $82 million in North America so far. Finally, in fifth place was Edgar Wright’s dystopian action comedy “The Running Man,” which took home $980,000 on Friday. The film should hit $34 million in North America by Sunday. \n",

The film was also awarded €20,000. It tells the story of teenage Ginto, who lives in the slums of Manila and dreams of becoming a gangster one day. \n\n\tThe jury, consisting of Ippolita di Majo, Lolita Chammah, Wannes Destoop, Sergei Loznitsa and Giona Nazzaro also recognized “Ida Who Sang So Badly Even the Dead Rose Up and Joined Her in Song,” awarding it the Special Jury Award (along with €7,000). It’s directed by Ester Ivakič.\n\t\n\n\tMarianne Métivier’s “Ailleurs La Nuit” was awarded for Best Screenplay, while Sadie Scott and Maria Wróbel triumphed in the acting categories, for “Fucktoys” and “Her Will Be Done” respectively. \n\n\n\tBrittany Shyne’s “Seeds” won Best Documentary for its ability to “convey through powerful images the daily life of a community forced to endure the hypocrisy of the words of the law,” argued the jury. They also awarded “Coexistence, My Ass!” and Pippo Delbono’s “Bobò.”\n\n\tIn other news, following the popular Paul Newman retrospective – with one festivalgoer Marcello managing to see every single film – the fest also announced next year’s star: Marilyn Monroe. \n\n\t“She was not just an actress, but a legend, a shining icon of the collective imagination. The image chosen for the 44th Torino Film Festival was taken during her final photo shoot, just days before her death. It captures both beauty and fragility, and conveys a sense of nostalgia for the future, as if she knew she was destined to live in eternity rather than in the present,” said artistic director Giulio Base.\n\t\n\n\tThe retrospective will coincide with the 100th anniversary of her birth.\n\n\tSpeaking of stars: while Vincent Lindon picked up the fest’s biggest honor, the Stella della Mola Award, during the closing night, this year also saw the likes of Juliette Binoche, Spike Lee, Antonio Banderas, Jacqueline Bisset and Vanessa Redgrave all rubbing shoulders at the Italian event. \n\n\tAlthough frail, the 88-year-old presented her son’s film “The Estate,” in which she acts alongside husband Franco Nero – although she was quick to correct a moderator during a presser. \n\n\t“You shouldn’t say ‘your son’. It’s the film’s director, Carlo Nero,” she deadpanned. Base called Redgrave “one of the best actresses in the world,” also praising her outspokenness and activism.\n\n\t“I’m so happy these international stars were so generous with us. They know about the festival now, and they tell their Western colleagues about it,” said Tiziana Rocca, who is responsible for Global Talent and International Relations. \n\n\t“They kept saying they got to relax and really appreciated those who welcomed them to our cinemas. The audience was so warm and so numerous. They were also very enthusiastic about the city itself. It makes me happy to see so many of them arrive here for the first time and experience this marvelous place.” \n\n\t“American Pie” veteran Jason Biggs showed off his directorial debut “Untitled Home Invasion Romance” – and his brand-new Italian passport. Terry Gilliam was also present, causing quite a commotion during a surprise screening of the rapturously received “Marty Supreme,” with stunned viewers forming a long, long line to sneak a selfie with him. \n\n\t“When I was 23 years old and [working] at a film festival, Terry Gilliam allowed me to show ‘Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas’ for the first time in Italy. Thank you, Terry,” said I Wonder Pictures’ Andrea Romeo before “Marty Supreme.” \n\n\t“The slogan of this film is ‘dream big’ and this festival dreams big, too.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMarilyn Monroe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Torino Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFeatures Competition\n\n\tBest Film\n\n\t“The Garden of Earthly Delights”\n\n\tDir: Morgan Knibbe\n\n\tSpecial Jury Award \n\n\t“Ida Who Sang So Badly Even the Dead Rose Up And Joined Her In Song”\n\t\n\n\tDir: Ester Ivakič\n\n\tBest Screenplay\n\n\t“Ailleurs La Nuit”\n\n\tDir: Marianne Métivier\n\n\tBest Acting\n\n\tSadie Scott (“Fucktoys”) and Maria Wróbel (“Her Will Be Done”)\n\n\tDocumentaries Competition\n\n\tBest Documentary\n\n\t“Seeds”\n\n\tDir: Brittany Shyne\n\n\tSpecial Jury Award \n\n\t“Coexistence, My Ass!”\n\n\tDir: Amber Fares\n\n\tSpecial Mention\n\n\t“Bobò”\n\n\tDir: Pippo Delbono\n\n\tShort Films Competition\n\n\tBest Film\n\n\t“What Have You Done, Zarina?”\n\n\tDir: Camila Sagyntkan\n\n\tSpecial Jury Award \n\n\t“175”\n\n\tDir: Sepehr Nosrati\n\n\tSpecial Mention\n\n\t“Fin”\n\n\tDir: Ward Kayyal\n\n\tFipresci Award\n\n\t“The Anatomy of the Horses”\n\n\tDir: Daniel Vidal Toche\n\n\tRAI Cinema Channel Award\n\n\t“175” \n\n\tAchille Valdata Award\n\n\t“Fucktoys”\n\n\tDir: Annapurna Sriram\n\n\tOcchiali di Gandhi Award\n\n\t“Coexistence, My Ass!” and Abdulrahman Sabbah’s “The Clown of Gaza”\n\n\tSpecial Mention\n\n\t“Bobò”\n\n\tInterfedi Award\n\n\t “Bobò”\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story discusses plot developments in Season 5, Volume 1 of “Stranger Things,” currently streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tVecna is back in",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story discusses plot developments in Season 5, Volume 1 of “Stranger Things,” currently streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tVecna is back in “Stranger Things 5” and he looks scarier than ever.\n\n\tIn Season 4 of the Netflix series, Jamie Campbell Bower was introduced as the sinister arch-villain in the Duffer Brothers’ Netflix series. While Bower is easy on the eyes as Vecna’s human incarnate, Henry Creel, Vecna in full form is a gruesome monster with vascular gray flesh, a decrepit face and piercing eyes — a fitting prince of the Upside Down.\n\t\n\n\tDue to Vecna’s temporary defeat at the end of Season 4 — after Nancy, Robin and Steve shot up his body and set it on fire — he returns in Season 5 looking even more grisly. When he makes his full body debut in the season’s fourth episode, he appears larger, with a more skeletal frame composed of veins, bones, muscles and ligaments tangled together in a ghastly visual. \n\n\n\tNaturally, Vecna’s new look required a new level of special effects, both digital and practical. “This season was definitely more of a blend between practical and CG,” Bower tells Variety. “On a practicality level, the face is all prosthetics, the shoulders are prosthetics, the hands are prosthetics, but everything else is a morph suit.”\n\n\tTurning Bower into the monster was a collaborative process between the actor and the make-up, special effects, costume and concept art teams. Bower credits prosthetic makeup department head Barrie Gower, costume designer Amy Parris and concept artist Michael Maher for their ingenuity in bringing Vecna to life. \n\t\n\n\tBower recalls talking with Gower to ensure that, while he would no longer be in full costume during shooting, “Vecna still has the presence that he had when I first stepped onto set — I want to make sure that I’m still large.” Gower added shoulder pads into the costume as well as “two large blocks in the side of the suit,” he added, so that Bower’s arms “just naturally sat that little bit further away from the body,” ensuring that Vecna retained an organically menacing gate. Meanwhile, Parris made sure that Bower had three inch rises in his shoes, so that Vecna towered over the rest of the characters.\n\n\tIt was a different experience playing Vecna this time around, as the new prosthetics and technology required for a smaller layer of latex covering the actor. Bower recalls that in Season 4, he had “an inch and a half of foam latex to get through” whereas Season 5 only called for “a millimeter.” This allowed for more fluidity and a smaller membrane for his performance to translate through.\n\n\tStill, a couple features remained the same, notably Vecna’s sinister voice, which Bower also provides. Bower developed the voice in Season 4 based off of Doug Bradley’s performance as Pinhead in the “Hellraiser” movies. “Doug is amazing as Pinhead and those first three [‘Hellraiser’] films are incredible,” he said. “I would often send the Duffers the gif of ‘Hellraiser III,’ where he says, ‘I am the way’ before the windows blow. That was often on the end of an email.”\n\n\tBower also strived to maintain his relationship with his costars, especially since he shared scenes with so many young actors playing Vecna’s terrified victims. “You absolutely don’t want them to be afraid all the time,” says Bower, “but of course, there are times where it’s necessary for the scene as well.”\n\n\tHe credits the copious scenes he shared with Millie Bobby Brown’s Eleven in Season 4 for allowing him to refine this balance. “Millie is wildly receptive and that’s what makes her an incredible actor,” he says, “It’s like what she’s experiencing is real all the time, so within that, there were definitely moments where we were working and she was in full terror, which, of course, is something that you need and want for the scenes. It’s important, but also, as her friend and somebody who loves her, I don’t want her to feel like that and there were certain moments where we were doing that and she went, ‘Oh, no, I know it’s you now. I feel safe because I can smell your cigarettes.’”\n\t\n\n\tThose check-ins were paramount to keep filming a positive experience, and even though Vecna is the series’ antagonist, Bower still feels a kinship with his costars and the “Stranger Things” crew. “We all are such a family, you know. It’s one of the most amazing things I think I’ve worked on,” he reflects. “Because Matt and Ross are both intellectually incredibly intelligent and emotionally incredibly intelligent as well as incredibly passionate, hardworking people, it makes all of us just go, ‘Yes, let’s do this together. We’re in this. Let’s bring our A-game.’ And within that, we just become this incredible team and, like I said, a family.”\n\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• The Duffer Brothers Answer Volume 1 Burning Questions• Noah Schnapp on Will’s Game-Changing Discovery• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler and Working With Sadie Sink• Cara Buono on Karen Finally Joining the Action• Sadie Sink on the Max and Venca Plot in Season 5• Natalia Dyer on Nancy’s ‘Failure’ in the Season Premiere\n\n",

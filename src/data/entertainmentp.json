    "body": "\n\tEva Longoria will be hitting the road in search of game day fun in “NFL Hometown Eats,” a new original series by Roku, NFL Films, Skydance Sports, Alfred Street Industries and Hyphenate Media Group. The series is set to debut in 2026. \n\n\t“NFL Hometown Eats” will follow a “die-hard celebrity fan and an NFL star as they take to the streets of their team’s city, reliving game-day glory, diving into local traditions, and devouring its most legendary eats.” The three-part series will focus on Longoria, who also serves as an executive producer, alongside an NFL player from the Dallas Cowboys. \n\t\n\n\t“Sports and food bring people together in a way almost nothing else can,” said Longoria. “At Hyphenate, we’re passionate about telling stories that connect people through culture, community, and shared experience, and ‘NFL Hometown Eats’ does exactly that. I’m excited to team up with the Dallas Cowboys to kick off the series and show how a city’s love for its team lives in kitchens, game-day traditions, and the unshakable fan loyalty passed down through generations. This series is a celebration of the people and places that give football its soul, and I’m thrilled to be bringing it to life with our amazing partners at Roku, the NFL, Skydance Sports, and Alfred Street Industries.” \n\n\n\t“Food and football are two of America’s greatest unifiers. With ‘NFL Hometown Eats,’ we’re shining a spotlight on the people and places that fuel the spirit of the game — from the legendary local spots to the hometown heroes behind the grill,” said Brian Tannenbaum, Head of Originals, Roku Media. “We’re thrilled to partner with the world-class teams at Hyphenate Media Group, NFL Films, Skydance Sports, and Alfred Street Industries to celebrate the communities that make the game bigger than the field.” \n\t\n\n\tThe series is overseen by Olivia LaRoche and Randall Bobbitt on behalf of Roku Originals. “NFL Hometown Eats” is executive produced by Longoria, Cris Abrego, Rachelle Mendez, and Ian Samplin for Hyphenate Media Group, Jane Lipsitz, Dan Cutforth, Dan Volpe, and Nan Strait for Alfred Street Industries, and Jesse Sisgold, Jason T. Reed, Jon Weinbach, and Lauren Gaffney for Skydance Sports, who will also oversee the series. \n",

In many ways, they’re like consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) in “The Godfather,” doling out advice and occasionally acting as hatchet men (and women), firing and hiring personal staff. But, just as often, they have more in common with the therapist for shpilkes-ridden Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) in “Annie Hall” or Billy Crystal’s psychiatrist character in “Analyze This” counseling a mob boss plagued by panic attacks (Robert De Niro). In other words, while their job entails everything from handling personal and corporate taxes to facilitating the purchase and sale of cars, homes, yachts, jets and even private islands, it’s not just about big bucks on balance sheets. Their ability to provide emotional counsel and comfort is equally important. And those skills were especially vital for the 2025 class of Variety’s Business Managers Elite, many of whom had clients and colleagues who lost their homes to the Los Angeles wildfires in January 2025. — Todd Longwell\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tReggie Gooden, Kymberli Hall\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tReggie GoodenFounder & managing partnerKymberli HallBusiness manager360 Business Management\n\n\tIn the past year, 360 Management has tripled its client roster, quadrupled its staff and expanded into two Los Angeles offices. It handles a mix of music (60%), film and TV (30%), and digital and sports talent (10%), the latter of which includes former NBA All-Star Baron Davis, NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and MMA fighter Anderson Silva, who all came aboard with the hire of new partner Lisa Behringer in the fall of 2025. Other clients include Cedric the Entertainer, Bella Thorne, January Jones, Frankie Shaw, Diana Nyad, YouTube creator CashNasty, musicians Devon “Stixx” Taylor, Saweetie and Cory Henry. Firm founder Gooden counsels all clients to maintain a solid financial foundation. “In the rare instance where they come with some crazy idea that they want to execute, I will always just steer them back to fundamentals,” he says.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBelva Anakwenze\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tPrincipal and business managerAbacus Financial Business Management\n\n\tAnakwenze gives all her clients — which include actor Jay Ellis (“Top Gun: Maverick”) and “ET” host Kevin Frazier — the same no-nonsense advice  in today’s uncertain economic climate: create multiple revenue streams, diversify investments and be frugal with cash. Thankful that none of her clients were directly impacted by this year’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires, Anakwenze closely reviewed their insurance policies. “We did our due diligence, making sure that if anything ever does happen to our clients where they’re directly impacted, they’re covered. We double-checked policy lines and what’s covered and what’s not covered and got extra policies if needed. It was an eye-opener for us to double-check everything.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDavid Levin, Ellis Beber, Michael Nelson, Allison Krant\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tDavid LevinManaging director, David Levin Business Management, a division of Adeptus AdvisorsEllis BeberMichael NelsonPartners, business management, David Levin Business Management, a division of Adeptus AdvisorsAllison KrantSenior director, business managementAdeptus Advisors\n\n\tLevin, Beber and Nelson are part of the New York City-based David Levin Business Management, which became a division of much bigger Adeptus Advisors back in 2019. Nelson believes the merger gives the best of both worlds to its clients, which include John Legend and Chrissy Teigen, the Black Crowes, Madison Beer, Hailey Bieber, Lake Street Dive, Edie Falco and fashion designer Nicole Miller. “While we’re able to maintain a boutique approach to client service, we also have the resources of a larger firm,” says Nelson. “So, if we need to bring in royalty divisions, audits, whatever it may be, we’re able to do that, but still keep that hand-holding approach.” Beber, who also supplies tour accounting services, says he’s noticing a new trend with insurance coverage. “A lot of clients are taking non-appearance coverage because even climate change can be something that can impact.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAnthony Bonsignore, Steven Pregiato, David Altman\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAnthony Bonsignore, Steven PregiatoManaging partnersDavid AltmanPartnerAltman, Greenfield & Selvaggi\n\n\tAlthough Bonsignore and Pregiato are based in New York and Altman in Los Angeles, this trio is a powerfully cohesive team. Each has his own roster of A-list clients that span most areas of the entertainment industry. Bonsignore’s clients include Dakota Johnson, Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig, David Harbour and Sterling K. Brown. Altman’s include Donald Glover, John Goodman, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. And Pregiato’s include Peter Dinklage, Christina Ricci and John Turturro. Altman, Bonsignore and Pregiato collaborate with their client’s representatives to identify unique business and career opportunities. While L.A. is still the nation’s entertainment hub, working in overseas productions can impact clients. “I’ve had clients moving out of Los Angeles,” Altman says. “Some of them looking for tax advantages of doing it, some of them looking for lifestyle and just feeling they don’t need to necessarily be here for the work that they want to do.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTate Henshaw, Lorne Clark\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tTate HenshawCOO, co-founderLorne ClarkCEO, co-founderARC Business Management\n\n\tOverseeing more than $100 million in revenue from a variety of athletic superstars, A-list actors and popular musicians, Atlanta’s ARC Business Management co-founders Henshaw and Clark’s combined acumen includes fintech, estate planning, royalty administration and wealth strategy. But they feel their philosophy surrounding wealth is a little different than most business managers. “Generally, we come at it from a more protective standpoint,” Henshaw explains. “Whether you’re talking an NBA player, an actress, an artist, etc., they don’t understand that you don’t really need to be aggressive to achieve your goals, you just don’t need to be foolish. When you’ve generated a lot of income, you might feel like you need to roll the dice, but, in reality, you probably don’t.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCraig Manzino, Jason Zayon, Robert Abramowitz, Olga Goldovskaya\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tCraig ManzinoJason ZayonPartners-in-chargeRobert AbramowitzPartnerOlga GoldovskayaDirectorArmanino Advisory\n\n\tThe Armanino quartet has helped grow the firm into a large comprehensive business management teams. Manzino and Zayon’s clients include actors, producers, directors, writers, musicians, high-net-worth individuals and business owners. Abramowitz focuses on sports figures, advising clients on deal structuring, M&A and business ventures like production companies, podcasts, YouTube channels and other non-entertainment investments. Goldovskaya is a go-to exec for influencers and content creators. They all educate and empower clients to make smart financial decisions, with AI being a common topic these days. “AI, it’s not coming – it’s here. And this is not a test,” Manzino says, before pondering, “I don’t know if these AI actors will have to file tax returns,” referencing industry buzz over AI actress Tilly Norwood and an AI music artist being offered a $3 million deal.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMarc Rosen, Samuel Levin, Aiden Tascic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tMarc RosenSamuel LevinPartnersAiden TascicDirectorArmanino Advisory\n\n\tWith Rosen based in New York and Levin and Tascic in two different offices in Los Angeles, this trio offers high- and ultra-high-wealth clients throughout showbiz sage advice. While the industry adjusts to a new normal resulting from the 2023 dual strikes — notably fewer film and TV productions and more foreign shoots — Rosen, Tascic and Levin have helped keep their clients’ income streams flowing during sluggish periods by encouraging wise investment decisions during more lucrative periods. Doing that means staying on top of ever-mutating tax laws and adapting to change. They encourage staff to use AI to help with repetitive tasks. “I’ve seen lots of cool things our staff is doing in terms of robotic processing,” Rosen says. “Summarizing complicated contracts or documents, spreadsheet work. There’s a lot of things happening that are making people more efficient.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEvan Bell, Liza de Leon, Yifan Yang, Carrie Zhao, Shue Zhu\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tEvan BellManaging partnerLiza de LeonSenior partnerYifan YangTax and financial management supervisorCarrie ZhaoShue ZhuBusiness managersBell and Company CPAs\n\n\tOver the past year, Bell has helped four clients move to London, doing everything from addressing tax and residency issues to finding, financing and purchasing their homes. “They realize they’re not filming in the United States anymore,” explains Bell. “There’s no reason for them to be here. And politically, they’re unhappy here, and they’re feeling that life in Europe is better and easier for them.” In addition to its expat expertise, the firm also has a rep for being adept at handling stand-up comics such as Andrew Santino, Stavros Halkias, Tom Papa and Adam Ray, and it has recently branched out into the showrunner realm with new clients including Jonathan Tropper and Francesca Sloane. Bell’s right hand is De Leon, who’s been with the firm for more than 30 years and today oversees the business management division of the practice, with clients that include Steven Soderbergh, Robert Eggers, Emily Deschanel and Carmen Cuba.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAdam Sansiveri, Stacie Jacobsen, Chris Brigham, Dan Weisman\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAdam SansiveriCo-lead, regional senior managing director, NashvilleStacie JacobsenCo-lead, national director of client engagement, Los AngelesChris BrighamCo-lead, senior research analyst, New YorkDan WeismanPrincipal, advisor specialistBernstein Sports & Entertainment Group\n\n\tA division of Bernstein Private Wealth Management, its sports and entertainment team has members based in Nashville (former Broadway producer Sansiveri and Grammy-nominated ex-music manager Weisman), Los Angeles (Jacobsen) and New York (research analysis Brigham). Their mission: help clients align financial decisions with their core values. Sansiveri says the shared mindset of entertainers and athletes has “shifted towards, ‘How can I maximize my value with my time in the spotlight to extend my earnings capabilities?’ That may be creating businesses [or] earning equity in companies, but [it’s] really [about] leveraging their brand power to further the brand itself.” Weisman’s example: his former management client Mike Posner, the Detroit hitmaker he helped pivot into the wellness space via health beverage manufacturers AG1 Athletic Greens. “It was a great outcome on every front,” says Sansiveri. “He got paid to endorse them and was able to invest in the company that is growing along with his foray into the wellness space.” \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJohn Shaheen\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tManaging partnerBusiness Wealth & Tax Management\n\n\tShaheen does more than help clients manage their money. He invests his time, energy and expertise in his clients, which include Jared Leto, Noname, Burna Boy, Kenny Beats and Mk.gee. By doing that he becomes a trusted partner. One day he might help a client replace lost credit cards or plan for their beneficiaries, and the next he might be walking them through buying insurance. “Insurance is nasty. It’s not fun. It’s not as straightforward as people think. And it’s also costly,” Shaheen says. “At the same time, I also understand the importance of having insurance. It really comes back to what’s right for every client’s unique circumstance.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDouglas Cammarano, Jean Lee, Maria del Pilar Lopez, Wayne Kamemoto\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tDouglas Cammarano (not pictured)Jean LeeMaria del Pilar LopezPartnersWayne KamemotoPartner, music industry practice leaderCitrin Cooperman\n\n\tCitrin Cooperman provides a potpourri of services to its roster of A-listers from the music and cinema worlds, including tax compliance, royalty audits services, insurance coverage procurement and estate planning. “We have very deep, trusting relationships with our clients,” says Lee. “We’re really here as their quarterback, to set up their estate planning meetings, their insurance meetings, get all the information, put it down in bullet points and make sure they’re protected. That’s our number one priority.” But there are always challenges. Del Pilar Lopez says it’s gotten so tough to obtain timely U.S. visas that some of her touring clients are forced to cancel their treks. “We used to plan six months in advance for visas — now it’s a year and a half to two years,” Lopez explains. “Sometimes visas get revoked with little explanation. It’s been a nightmare.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCarrie Malcolm\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Bjorn Bolinder\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFounding partnerCRM Management, a division of NKSFB\n\n\tNew York-based Malcolm has noticed a rising trend with some members of her enviable roster, which includes David Duchovny, Ethan Hawke, Sofia Coppola, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jennifer Connelly, Heather Graham, Ariana DeBose, Sophie Turner, Anderson Cooper and Griffin Dunne. A few have been so successful at monetizing their social media presence that they are no longer beholden to the old one-for-me/one-for-them philosophy regarding passion vs. payday projects. “They’re making a lot of their money from fashion and posting and things like that,” she says. “It allows people to do the work they want to do because they can get money from that and still do interesting movies.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBrandy Davis\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tPresidentDavis Financial Group\n\n\tSince departing the large business management firm MGO during the pandemic to hang out her own shingle, Davis has found that she’s “not as scheduled 24-7” with things like internal meetings and travel. This gives her more time to focus on her clients, which include above-the-title actors, writers, producers, directors and other high-net-worth individuals. Over the past year, she’s handled numerous complicated real estate transactions, set up and managed multiple businesses for her clients, and, of course, talked to them about AI. “I’m hearing that they’re using AI to help them in their daily lives for different things,” says Davis, “but they’re terrified of what it’s going to be for the industry.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSally Velazquez, Tracy Miller\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tSally VelazquezPresidentTracy MillerVP, operationsEmpower Business Management\n\n\tWith Velazquez and Miller at the helm, Empower has grown alongside longtime clients like 21 Savage. Whether discussing catalog sales or how to invest funds, their business is so strong that Empower is adding a second office to better serve East Coast and U.K. clients. While Velazquez appreciates how AI can boost productivity, hearing an AI musician was offered a $3 million contract scares her. “You can make [AI] sound like Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey put together, but how are we going to connect with the music? Music is something you connect to as a story. The reason Taylor Swift is so popular is because we listen to her songs and want to know who she’s talking about, or because we like her and her backstory.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tElizabeth Campos, Jack Sinoryan\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tElizabeth CamposFounding partnerJack SinoryanFounding partnerEvolve Business Management\n\n\tIf you don’t think Elizabeth Campos is as resourceful as she is resilient, you haven’t heard about how she was recently recommended by an A-lister to help a friend who was about to lose her home to auction. “That was no easy task,” recalls Campos, who has 27 years of business management experience under her belt. “But I saved everything, having the agility and the resources to get it done. It’s a real testament to what we do at Evolve.” Evolve has only been around 15 months, but Campos and Sinoryan, who specializes in taxation, think its size makes for a nice client fit for its high-profile actor-and-musician roster. “Being a smaller firm allows us to make decisions quicker,” says Sinoryan, whose proactive approach, rather than a reactive one, eliminates hurdles.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPaul Barnabee, Julie Boos, David Boyer, Jamie Cheek, Duane Clark, Carmen Romano\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tPaul BarnabeeDirector of West Coast operationsJulie BoosOwner, chairmanDavid BoyerOwner, vice presidentJamie CheekOwner, CEODuane ClarkOwner, presidentCarmen RomanoOwner, vice presidentFBMM\n\n\tFBMM’s Nashville-based CEO/co-owner Cheek says the adage “fame before fortune” is very true. “Creatives think that they should be making and have a lot of money way before it starts to accumulate.” VP/co-owner Romano, who works out of the 35-year-old firm’s New York office, concurs, adding it’s not just the clients who think that but also those around them. “I always say that the hardest part of the job is protecting the client from themselves,” he says. A philosophy of financial health and strength is being promoted to a client roster that includes A-list musical artists such as Keith Urban, Eric Church, Kelly Clarkson, Luke Combs and Kings of Leon. According to Cheek, some touring costs have increased significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic, a trend attributed to the large number of acts now on the road. “Artists are having to lock in 12-month longer-term bus leases in order to secure the seven buses that they need for five months, because everybody else is doing it. That is not sustainable.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAmir Malek, Pam Malek\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tHeads, business managementFocus Partners Wealth\n\n\tWorking for a company that has been rebranded from the Colony Group to Focus Partners Wealth, this first couple of business management has been happily married 26 years and currently preside over $150 billion worth of assets from their Calabasas office.  Amir Malek — whose clients range from Grammy-winning, multi-platinum-selling recording artists and numerous music producers, TV and film directors, social media influencers and sports entertainment brands — specializes in domestic and international tax compliance, catalog evaluation, treasury management and financial concierge services.

But that doesn’t mean there aren’t challenges. An expert at tracking artists’ royalties, he frequently sees new clients struggle to produce a comprehensive list of their credits. “I’m like, ‘So you’re an owner of a shoe store? You don’t have an inventory of your shoes?’’ says Curry. “We basically find out that more than half the stuff this client has has never been collected.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAndrew Meyer, Steves Rodriguez\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tPartnersFreemark Financial\n\n\tThe industry is contracting, but Freemark’s clients are doing quite well, thank you.

Nonetheless, his partner Meyer (who handles “Wicked” director Jon M. Chu and actors Jessica Chastain, Kelly Giddish, Kathryn Hahn, Ellen Pompeo, Alexander Skarsgård, Vince Vaughn and Constance Wu) says some clients have explored moving away from high income tax states like California, but, “as they spent more time in the state where they were contemplating moving to, they decided there’s maybe some reasons why we don’t want to do this.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTyson Beem\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tCEO and managing directorGelfand, Rennert & Feldman\n\n\tBeem is proud to carry on the legacy of 58-year-old Gelfand, Rennert & Feldman, which he joined in 1998.

But for this sextet of Los Angeles-based managing directors, the nuts and bolts of servicing their roster of A-list stars, directors, musicians, producers, production companies, composers, athletes, influencers, execs and ultra-high-net-worth individuals remains largely the same as it’s always been. “Maybe there are a few more credit cards or a few more bills to pay,” says Cohn. “The complication comes with the planning. There are many more opportunities out there for us to research for our clients.” They’re also helping clients explore the idea of leaving California or New York to reduce their taxes or the United States for political reasons. “They say, ‘We just got done filming in the U.K. What if I don’t come back?’” explains Lloyd. “I say test the waters,” adds Cohn. “The grass isn’t always greener.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTodd Kamelhar, Anton Pamer\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tManaging directorsGelfand, Rennert & Feldman\n\n\tKamelhar and Pamer are two of the business management stars in Gelfand, Rennert & Feldman’s New York City office.

AI is top of mind for many of his clients, who, like other celebs, fear its potential abuses, but are also excited by its upsides, from using it to protect their copyright interests to its potential as a creative tool.

He understands the desire to protect their assets, but AI isn’t making his job easier. “AI becomes another Google — clients are very good at getting tax advice from a trusted source called Google,” he says. “They’ll say, ‘Hey, I looked this up, here it is.’ It’s maybe three-quarters of the way there, but there’s sometimes some big flaws we have to work through to make sure the information is correct.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEd Gold\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: JEAN-PIERRE UYS\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tCEO, founderGold Business Management\n\n\tSoul songwriter Teddy Swims, boygenius’ Julien Baker, heavy metal kingpins Lamb of God and Gojira and L.A.-based music and sports management company Milk & Honey are just a few of Gold’s longtime clients, some of whom have been with him and his staff of six for decades.

But one of the most valuable things they offer is basic, common-sense advice, like Gonzalez’s mantra “get it in writing and make sure there’s a trail somewhere” and Borda’s pleading “don’t make a rash decision.” Most of all, clients need to think long- term, suggests Shelley: “I had a client who swore he was going to die from cancer at 60 and he’s 70 now,” he relates. “Now we’re talking about retirement strategies he didn’t think about before.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTravis Guterman, Simon Rosenberg\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBusiness managersGuterman & Rosenberg\n\n\tThe 10-member boutique firm formed in 2021 supervises the financial welfare of prominent digital media personalities, rappers and DJs, as well as traditional film and TV talent.

Gary says the duo knows every aspect of the boutique business, with a pair of offices in the Sherman Oaks and Brentwood sections of Los Angeles serving a list of 100 clients that includes actors Alyson Hannigan and Ed Helms, ex-“CSI” showrunner Carol Mendelsohn and film and TV productions. “[We have] the tax aspect, the insurance aspect.

Kenney says issues with fraud and bank security are of growing concern to her and her clients. “Cyber fraud is huge right now, and it feels like it’s been over the last two to three years that it’s just increasing.

Positive word-of-mouth from clients helps, but so does her impressive track record, like building and managing finances for Travis Scott’s Circus Maximus Tour, the highest-grossing solo rap tour to date. “I run a lot of companies for clients, but now I also have to focus on my own business,” she says. “That’s been a little bit of a learning curve, but a good one.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMatt Lichtenberg, Mark Friedman, John Rigney, Charles Clancy, Mark Cattalini, Paul Ta\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tMatt LichtenbergMark FriedmanJohn RigneyCharles ClancyPartners and business managersMark Cattalini, Paul TaBusiness managersLevel Four Business Management\n\n\tAccording to Level Four’s Cattalini, they’re still unraveling the tax implications of President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.

Their roster is both starry and diverse, toplined by big names including Samuel L.

Like everyone else, they’re assessing the future implications of AI, but right now, they’re mostly using it for basic research on things like how to register a car in Texas. “It’s still kind of like in the old days with Google,” says Cattalini. “You’ve got to [search] three or four times to make sure it’s legit.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSteve Gelon, Alex Smith, Justin Sroka, Van Lee\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tSteve GelonAlex SmithCo-managing partnersJustin SrokaVan LeePartnersMann Gelon Smith Sroka Lee\n\n\tJanuary saw the promotion of Smith, Sroka and Lee at the 58-year-old L.A. sports and entertainment company, which boasts clients from the worlds of film, TV and music, along with high-net-worth individuals. “It’s a good reflection of who we are now and where we’re going,” says Lee, who specializes in managing Hollywood estates, a complement to her roster of front-of-camera talent. She advises her clients to have informative talks with their intended beneficiaries as a crucial part of estate planning to “pave a smoother pathway not only for the benefactor, but also business managers and advisors.” She’s also concerned about evolving technologies. “You can buy your identity for $.03 on the dollar, so there’s going to be more prevalent issues where we have to stay on top of protecting clients, whether it’s locking down their credit, scrubbing their public record or sheltering their identity through a privacy trust or LLC.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJohn McIlwee\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFounding partnerJ.

Baker also pays his success forward. “Every year I award 25 college scholarships to seniors from my high school alma mater in a little bitty town called Crossville, Ala. To date, I’ve awarded over 100 scholarships. It’s something that makes me remember where I came from, and it keeps me humble.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tChristine Choi, Daniel Marcus, Michael Meschures, Tony Smalls\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tChristine ChoiBusiness management partnerDaniel MarcusBusiness management partnerMichael MeschuresBusiness management partnerTony SmallsPartner, head of entertainment, sports & mediaMGO\n\n\tAs the leader of MGO’s entertainment, sports and media practice, Smalls has been adding new services on top of business management, including name, image, likeness (NIL) consulting, tour accounting, royalty audits and catalog advisory. But some of the most valuable services it offers its client roster — which is a mix of film, TV and music talent and companies, digital influencers and athletes, as well as execs and high-net-worth families — are less tangible. “Maneuvering the emotions, and when’s the right time to tell them what, and how to present it so it’s received how you intend it to be received are skills that aren’t taught in school — that takes this time to develop,” he says. One of things they’re urging clients to do in this time of industry contraction is diversify. “You can’t just be a film and TV actor and not have a platform or a presence where you might be able to earn money on endorsements or maybe some content creation,” says Meschures.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMichael Kaplan, Justine Ruffalo, Marlena Kaplan,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tMichael KaplanManaging partnerJustine RuffaloPartnerMarlena KaplanChief financial officerMiller Kaplan\n\n\tRuffalo works mostly with musicians, producers and companies in the music investment space, while Michael Kaplan helps clients from all areas of the entertainment industry generate financial security allowing them to pursue their creative passions, and Marlena Kaplan (no relation to Michael) ensures the firm holds its own as a large boutique firm. While music catalog sales remain strong, clients are also investing in technology and real estate. The CPAs at Miller Kaplan are dedicated to protecting their clients’ interests, be it selling IP, downsizing for retirement or launching new businesses. “There are a lot of bad actors out there, and we have to protect our clients’ information and assets,” Ruffalo says, adding that fraud is so rampant that banks offer webinars about hackers. “Firms really need to invest in cybersecurity. ”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMark Landesman, Scott Landesman, Paul Zukowsky, Eric Binder, Jessica Mooney\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tMark LandesmanScott LandesmanPaul ZukowskyEric BinderPartnersJessica MooneyChief operating officerML Management\n\n\tWhen Mark Landesman started ML Management in 1988 with a young Eddie Murphy as a client, he couldn’t have foreseen it would become a family business.

Earlier this year, Binder rolled his practice into ML, and he now heads the L.A. office. Their ever-growing list of clients — mostly from the comedy space — recognize the power of that kinship. Whether advising business investments or assisting with wildfire remediation, rebuilding and insurance claims, the entire ML team helps clients navigate the ups and downs of their professional and personal lives. AI is something Scott Landesman says most of their clients needn’t worry about. “Live entertainment isn’t something that AI would be able to replicate very easily, versus TV and film and anything on screens. It’s going to be very difficult for AI to replicate live sports, live comedy, live music.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHarley Neuman\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFounder, partnerNeuman + Associates, a division of NKSFB\n\n\tWith a stellar roster that includes actors Scarlett Johansson, Zoe Saldaña, Cynthia Erivo, Jonah Hill and Sean Hayes, prolific writer-producer-showrunner Ryan Murphy and Ellen DeGeneres, Neuman’s 34-year-old firm has been able to weather the current industry contraction. Nonetheless, his clients are increasingly branching out into consumer products, from liquor to cosmetics. But many are still feeling the sting of the cap placed on state and local tax (SALT) deductions from federal taxes back in 2017. The cap was increased from $10,000 to $40,000 in 2025, “but that’s still nothing for people that make the kind of money that my clients make,” says Neuman, adding “once deductions get taken away, they almost never come back.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMickey Segal, Michael Karlin, David Bolno, Steve Landau,  Matt Segal, Diane Vaughn\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tMickey SegalFounding, managing partnerMichael KarlinFounding partnerDavid BolnoSteve LandauMatt SegalDiane VaughnPartnersNKSFB\n\n\tThe NKSFB sextet has more than a century and a half of collective business management experience.

In addition to its other functions, the Los Angeles-based company — now in its 12th year, with 110 clients and more than $375 million in assets under its management — also provides services for bill payment, cash flow management, tour planning, tax preparation and personal financial management. “We’re here to empower and educate clients, help them understand how their money works and really take ownership of it,” adds Gott.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTony Peyser, David Alexander, Mark Mingelgreen, Jack Ketover\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tTony PeyserDavid AlexanderFounding partnersMark MingelgreenManaging partnerJack KetoverPartnerPeyser & Alexander\n\n\tThe team at Peyser & Alexander guides clients toward opportunities for financial growth, while steering them clear of unnecessary risks.

It’s your money.”  The firm has 24 offices in locations ranging from London (Carter’s homebase) to the Cayman Islands, caring for the financial needs of a roster that encompasses everyone from globally popular music stars to franchise TV producers. While it’s well-equipped to handle the big stuff — services include royalty audit and contract compliance, tour accounting and profit participation and I.P. valuations — Smith says no financial detail should be too small for the Prager Metis team. “You need to be aware of how your money’s being saved, invested, how your taxes are being paid, all of that stuff,” says Smith.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTara Moore, Patrick Templeman, Amy Gittleman Blom\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tPartners, managing directorsPS Business Management\n\n\tThe three members of this PS Business Management team are spread out across the U.S., with Moore in Nashville, Templeman in New Orleans and Gittleman Blom in its New York headquarters.

The same thing has happened on the merch side, where take home used to be closer to 30%, and now it’s more like 15%-20%.” But, she adds, “There are so many opportunities for brand deals and sponsorships and social media posts that are monetized,” along with other things like photo books, bios and documentaries.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAnna DerParseghian\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Narek Zohrabyan\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tManaging PartnerPTD Business Management\n\n\tDerParseghian alleviates clients’ financial stress so they can focus on creativity and not worry about having to take a job they don’t want because they need the money. To do that, she’s become a great listener. “The way we build wealth around a client — or help them grow their wealth — is by really understanding what their dreams and aspirations are,” explains DerParseghian, whose roster is populated by music, film and TV heavyweights. “What we do really, really well is literally sit and listen to the client so we’re able to build something around them that is very specific to their vision, their goal and their aspiration — not only for them, but for their families, if they have growing families.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAlan Reback, Derrick Lee\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFounding partnersReback Lee & Co.\n\n\tThe Emmys, Grammys, Oscars and Tonys have all been accounted for — literally — by firm co-founder Reback, who first scored the financial equivalent of the EGOT in 2021. Those aren’t the only production accounting credentials Reback has earned: he’s also worked the SAG Awards and the FIFA Club World Cup Halftime Show. “It’s a compacted timeline and things need to be done daily,” Reback notes. “We sometimes process 500-600 checks a day between all shows.” Lee, with whom Reback began working in 1995, oversees the business management and tax side of the business, although Reback helps when he can. “We don’t look to change things when they’re working,” Lee says. “We help when it makes sense.” \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJordan L.

Specializing in music clients, their roster includes a top-tier musician who’s producing a horror film, acting and hosting horror conventions. An equity partnership stake Josephs advised a client on was worth $300 million when that company sold for $1 billion. “Business managers look at things in a vacuum of dollars and cents, money in, money out and what a business model should look like, but there’s context we also have to look at,” he says. “Maybe a business opportunity where we just break even helps build the client’s brand or exposure to where they’re selling more merch or selling more tickets. It’s hard to determine the return-on-investment, but there is an inherent return on that investment.” \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRick Schenkel, Steve Levitt, Marta Botten\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tRick SchenkelPartner, Southern CaliforniaSteve LevittMarta BottenPartners, business managementRichey May\n\n\tIn September 2025, Sobul, Primes & Schenkel merged with several other firms under the Richey May brand, creating a unified national advisory and accounting platform that is effectively “six firms in six different cities and about 600 people,” says Schenkel, who founded his company as USXA back in the 1980s. SPS clients were already well-served by in-house talent like Levitt, a taxation and business planning expert with more than 40 years of experience who joined the firm in 1996, and IRS-enrolled agent Botten, a quarter-century-plus veteran who concentrates on strategic oversight regarding the finances of recording and touring musicians, film and TV actors, directors and high net-worth individuals. But Schenkel says the new arrangement gives his roster flexible options and added tools, including improved cybersecurity. “We now have the ability to work with these other groups across the country,” he notes. “This means having resources to make strategic acquisitions, other strategic moves and a really different mindset the way financing is done at the firm.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAndrew Blackman, Wesley Childs, Robert E.

Just as important are the soft skills it employs to shield its monied clients from things like the outstretched hands of friends and family. “We as business managers don’t want to blow up their relationships, but we have to protect them,” says Zand.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRick Shephard, Mark Tinglof\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tPartnersShephard Tinglof + Associates\n\n\tShephard and Tinglof’s firm has been around for more than 30 years, but they’re still encountering new economic wrinkles to iron out for their clients, which include Courteney Cox, Ben Stiller. Jon Favreau and director Michael Engler (“The Gilded Age”). For instance, with film and TV productions increasingly shooting outside the U.S., they’re dealing with more and more foreign tax issues. “I have a child actor that worked a show that was in Australia last year, and I had to try to hire an Australian accountant to do all the applications for getting the tax rate reduced, because if you don’t do anything, the rate is like 45%,” says Tinglof. “So you have to kind of work a deal with the government to get the tax withholding rate down to something reasonable, like 19%, roughly.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMatthew Burke\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tManaging partnerSinger Burke\n\n\tEarlier this year, Burke guided his 53-year-old business management firm Singer Burke and its sister company, investment advisor SB Capital Management, through their acquisition by Mercer Advisors, a national wealth management platform with $86 billion in client assets. Burke says, “It fulfills a multi-decade vision to bring comprehensive financial services under one roof, which is how we believe that we deliver the best advice and outcomes for clients,” which include actors, composers, directors, producers, showrunners, writers and management-production companies  that have been involved in projects ranging from “Bridgerton” to “The Family Guy.” “This is going to allow us to expand beyond Southern California into other creative hubs around the nation and internationally,”he adds.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSteven Shapiro, James Nagel\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tSteven ShapiroOwner, founderJames NagelBusiness management partnerSummit Business Management\n\n\tSummit has a roster of 500 clients, including high-profile names such as Taylor Sheridan, Zendaya, Tom Holland, “Weird Al” Yankovic, Vanessa Hudgens, Justin Hartley, Aaron Paul, Elliot Gould and director Gavin O’Connor (“The Accountant 2”), along with a wealth of below-the-line talent. With the guild strikes, the ongoing decline in local production, rising housing costs and the January fires, the latter of which damaged or destroyed the homes of 18 clients, it’s been a tough few years for the Hollywood community, leading a fair number to leave California. “It’s not only the cost of buying a house and the rates of interest but, unfortunately, the crime element as well,” says Shapiro. “A lot of people just say it’s not the California that we moved to 50 years ago.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJosh Klein\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFounder, CEOTKG Business Management\n\n\tBeverly Hills-based Klein is a bit of an anomaly: aside from TKG, he’s also partnered with the band the Chainsmokers in Mantis Venture Capital. However, he draws the line between church and state when it comes to a conflict of interest: “I don’t allow my clients to invest in Mantis,” he says. With 150 clients amassed over the past four-and-a-half years — including music artists Charlie Puth, Jessie Murph, Shaboozey, Big Sean, Logic and several sports figures — Klein says the key to success is to take your profession seriously. “Be passionate about what you do — but realize it’s a job. You have an obligation and a responsibility to support yourself and your family if you have one.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJoe McGill, Bryan Meyer\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tOwnersTopline Business Management\n\n\tMcGill and Meyer have a broad mix of clients, from TV host Karamo Brown to director Adam Wingard. While McGill says some film and TV clients are seeing fewer post-strike work opportunities due to scaled-back production, Meyer has noticed comedians and other stage acts are doing well, perhaps because of a post-pandemic desire for live performances. One trend they’ve noticed is an L.A. exodus. “We’ve had several clients move out of the state,” McGill says. “They’re more established talents, so they’re able move away from the city and still get work. High-level talent, like a showrunner, can work from anywhere these days. We have clients who have done that. They’re happier now being close to family and can come back to L.A. when needed.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHeather Kinder, Peggy Stephens, Bret Guest\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tHeather KinderChief of staffPeggy StephensChief operating officerBret GuestBusiness managerTri Star Sports & Entertainment Group\n\n\t“We are in the service industry, and we all have a service heart,” states Kinder, a former Tennessee Titans cheerleader who was recently promoted by her boss Lou Taylor to equity partner (along with Stephens, chief deputy director Deedra Carroll, and new addition, chief growth officer Lahteefah “Lah” Parramore). She’s a 14-year veteran of a practice that offers not only accounting, financial and asset protection services, but also visa and immigration assistance and even aircraft and yacht management to a mixed clientele of actors, artists, athletes, entrepreneurs and executives. Flanked by detail-driven Stephens, a master of tax, real estate and asset strategies, and Guest, who focuses on brand extension and catalog valuation and monetization, Kinder says her job allows her to see how the other half lives as she makes big-ticket purchases on their behalf. “I’ve bought yachts, airplanes, multi-million-dollar houses,” she notes. “That’s fun!”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLou Taylor\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tCEO, founderTri Star Sports & Entertainment Group\n\n\tTaylor’s 33-year-old firm Tri Star recently added a new location to complement its offices in Nashville and West Hollywood, establishing an East Coast presence in Miami with the acquisition of Lahteefah “Lah” Parramore’s the LRW Group. The move also added another collection of entertainers, athletes and high-net-worth individuals to its already-rich roster, which includes recording artists Justine Skye, Shenseea and Tyler Hubbard, actors Taraji P. Henson, Jodie Turner-Smith and Charles Melton, models Taylor Hill and Adriana Lima and the Prince estate. And as she grows her business with bold, proactive moves, so do her clients. “I’ve never seen the amount of talent-owned ideation and brand-building that’s going on,” says the New York native. “That’s really where value sits.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDavid Weise\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFounding partnerDavid Weise & Associates, a division of NKSFB\n\n\tSome people say the touring business is slowing down, but Weise insists he hasn’t seen it with his clients, which include Coldplay, the Weeknd, Usher, Lil Wayne and Carole King. Weise says he doesn’t have any creative abilities, but he excels at communicating with creatives, a talent he feels is sometimes overlooked. And if they don’t listen? “Then you may have to move on,” he says. “You have a fiduciary responsibility to your clients to do what’s right and to always speak your mind. At the end of the day, because it’s the client’s decision, you can only guide them to what you can do.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAdam Yorkshire\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFounder, CEOYorkshire Management Group\n\n\tYorkshire is the rare business manager who dreamed of entering the profession when he was a kid, thanks to his father’s longtime friendship with legendary business manager Bernie Gudvi. “I saw my dad getting free concert tickets and merch at the shows,” says Yorkshire. “And I remember thinking, so if you’re a business manager, you get free stuff. That’s the coolest thing in the world.” Today, he services a music-centric client list that’s hip-hop and pop-heavy, with a lot of social media crossover on TikTok and other platforms. Having dealt with a lot of “spirited personalities” over the years, he knows how to communicate with his clients. “They don’t need a three-hour soliloquy about how taxes work,” he says. “As long as they understand that I understand, people start to feel comfortable, and that builds a lot of trust.

    "body": "\n\tAdd USA Sports to the ranks of TV-sports outlets hustling for a piece of one of the few games left that can still lure the large, live audiences advertisers crave.\n\n\tVersant, the company that will be spun off over the next few weeks from NBCUniversal, launched its USA Sports division in a bid to define a broad portfolio of sports rights that encompass telecasts of NASCAR, PGA Tour, Premier League, WWE, WNBA and more. Versant will show games largely on its USA  and Golf Channel cable networks. CNBC is likely to show USA Sports programming on weekends, starting in 2026.\n\t\n\n\tIn all, USA Sports will present more than 10,000 hours of games and studio programming, the company said.\n\n\n\t“Our new USA Sports brand and division name leans into USA Network’s decades-long reputation as a top national sports and entertainment network,” said Matt Hong, president of USA Sports, in a statement. “Our diverse portfolio of sports properties and programming across our platforms highlights top-tier global leagues and amplifies major events throughout the sports landscape. USA Sports has something for all sports fans across the country.”\n\n\tUSA Sports will offer approximately 1,000 hours of women’s sports in 2026, with coverage of WNBA, LPGA Tour and League One Volleyball.\n\n\tThe name of the new division nods to USA Network, one of cable’s oldest properties. The channel, originally run by executive Kay Kopolowitz and owned by UA-Columbia Cablevision and Madison Square Garden Corp., launched in 1977.\n\n\tVersant has an asset lineup that is heavily tilted toward cable, with networks such as MSNBC, CNBC, E! and Oxygen, among others. Executives have suggested the company will seek to bolster its properties with new products and services including newsletters and conferences. that bring them closer to the consumers who are their heaviest viewers.\n",

    "description": "\n\tAlief, the French-U.K. film company, has swooped on worldwide sales rights to Lithuanian Karolis Kaupinis’ “Hunger Strike Breakfast,” his follow-up ",
    "body": "\n\tAlief, the French-U.K. film company, has swooped on worldwide sales rights to Lithuanian Karolis Kaupinis’ “Hunger Strike Breakfast,” his follow-up to debut “Nova Lituania,” Lithuania’s 2021 Oscar entry. \n\n\tReceiving its world premiere at the 1-2 Competition of mid-October’s 41st Warsaw Film Festival, “Hunger Strike Breakfast” is produced by Marija Razgutė of M-Films, behind award-winning films “Slow,” at Sundance in 2023 and Vytautas Katkus’ “The Visitor,” which scooped best director at Karlovy Vary this July. The Czech Republic’s Background Films and Latvia’s Tasse Film co-produce.  \n\t\n\n\tWritten by Kaupinis, it turns on Daiva (Ineta Stasiulytė), a star TV announcer, launching a hunger strike outside her company, Lithuanian Radio & TV, H.Q., in protest at its occupation by Soviet troops, who had invaded the newly independent Lithuania in Jan. 1991. \n\n\n\tShe is joined in a modest trailer by her TV boss (Arvydas Dapšys), fearful of reprisal, a taciturn reader of late night poetry on the network, and a neighbor, a struggling TV actor (Paulius Pinigis) who wants to get away from his family.\n\n\tIn a more conventional political drama, Daiva’s hunger strike would light a fire of popular protest which ousts the Soviet forces. \n\n\tNot so here. The protest attracts just two recruits, and Kaupinis, who interviewed the real-life strikers, goes a different way, probing in an intimate drama the often across-the-tracks human connection and self re-discovery found in collective action, however rapidly ignominious its outcome in this case.\n\t\n\n\tThis is particularly true of Daiva who comes to ask why she has sunk her life in her job, its fake glamor contrasting not only with drab Vilnius surroundings but her personal sense of culpability and deep desolation.   \n\n\t“On the surface it was a political fight, but the motivation for it was long suppressed feelings of loneliness, guilt, desire for something big, important, beautiful and warm,”Kaupinus has told Variety.\n\n\t“During the pandemia and Russian war in Ukraine, it felt like a proper metaphor for my own current Lithuanian society – a tiny makeshift trailer, people on hunger strike, aggressive enemy on one side and indifferent neighbors on the other side,” he added.\n\n\t“‘Hunger Strike Breakfast’ is ‘just right’ for our times: An engrossing absurdist drama shot in cinéma vérité fashion, that offers a surprising glimpse into the everyday travails of post-communist freedom,” said Brett Walker, president of Alief,  \n\n\tAlief partner Miguel Govea added that “Hunger Strike Breakfast” is “a sophisticated drama with an atmospheric satirical streak that gradually reminds the audience not to believe in fake news, thus encouraging the fight for our basic freedoms. What is not to love?”\n\n\tAfter Warsaw, “Hunger Strike Breakfast” screens in the fiction strand of the Baltic Film Competition at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival where its inclusion has become a statement of independence for the festival after the film incurred the wrath of far-right pro-Russia Nemunas Dawn, part of Lithuania’s ruling coalition. \n\n\t“Nemunas Dawn, which is still in the coalition government and shamefully in charge of Culture, has been waging a campaign of disinformation against Lithuanian films, notably against ‘Hunger Strike Breakfast,’ which motivated me even more to include it in our program,” Baltic Film Competition curator Edvinas Pukšta told Variety in late October.\n\n\t“Hunger Strike Breakfast” also forms part of a powerful Baltic presence at Tallinn of some 40 films, now able to support two Baltic Film Competitions, one fiction, another documentary, with the festival including minority co-productions to underscore the range of Baltic filmmaking. \n\n\tIn the last few years, other Baltic titles, such as Series Mania winner, TV series “Soviet Jeans,” a Walter Presents pick-up, have begun to re-explore the region’s relatively recent past with, like “Hunger Strike Breakfast” a deeply humanist lens which captures the true sentiments of rebellion against a Soviet establishment.   \n",

    "body": "\n\tA soldier sits in a sterile hospital room, speaking words of hard-earned wisdom as his eyes betray flickers of melancholy and regret. It’s a scene out of a movie, only this is no ordinary actor, delivering a performance to a camera from the comfort of a soundstage. Instead, it’s a collection of pixels that have been assembled through the magic — or, depending upon your perspective, evil alchemy — of AI. And here’s the thing: Unlike most AI creations that look, well, phony, this guy is completely lifelike.\n\t\n\n\tThis touching scene has been assembled using patented technology from Timur Bekmambetov, a Kazakh Russian filmmaker best known for the 2008 Angelina Jolie action film “Wanted.” Dubbed Stanislavsky, the program attempts to train AI using the same Method acting techniques that transformed Marlon Brando, James Dean and Robert De Niro into screen titans. (The name is a hat tip to Konstantin Stanislavski, the Russian theater director who revolutionized acting by using self-analysis to create a style of performance that was more psychologically realistic.)\n\n\n\t“If a character is staring out a window with a sad look, I won’t just tell the AI, ‘He’s sad,’” Bekmambetov, who is walking me through a demonstration of the tech on Zoom, explains. “In the prompt I’ll use the Stanislavski system and write something like ‘His dog died yesterday, and the sunset is reminding him of what it was like to play with his dog in the park.’”\n\n\t“It’s not about what you want a character to do; it’s giving them a map for how to get there,” he adds.\n\t\n\n\tBut Bekmambetov’s product is about more than just delivering more authentic artificial performances. It helps create entire films and shows. To begin with, producers feed a script into the Stanislavski system and it breaks down the action into a series of suggested shots and sequences that will eventually be reshaped by filmmakers during production. The program also functions as an interface that allows the heads of different departments — from the cinematographer to the production designer to the editor — to interact on one platform, where they can share notes and feedback and also give the AI direction on how to fine-tune a film or show. \n\n\n\n\n\tBekmambetov spent roughly $5 million and more than a decade developing the technology and is aiming for a December launch. It arrives as Hollywood is fiercely debating the costs and benefits of AI: Studios and streamers hope it will help them slash budgets and work more efficiently, while actors, writers and other creative talent fear it will lead to fewer and fewer jobs. Bekmambetov acknowledges the disruptive ramifications of AI, but he’s a convert.\n\n\t“It’s too late — AI is here to stay, so we have to train it responsibly,” Bekmambetov says. “Don’t think of AI as an angel or as the devil. Yes, it will take jobs, but what we need to focus on is how do we direct it and use it properly.”\n\n\tHis next film, “Mercy,” is a thriller about a man, played by Chris Pratt, who has 90 minutes to prove his innocence to an AI judge. It will be distributed by Amazon MGM Studios and opens on Jan. 23. Even before “Mercy” started shooting, Bekmambetov used AI to create a mockup version of the film and presented it to the studio so it could see what it had greenlit.\n\n\t“We basically showed them the final cut,” he says. “They gave me less notes. Usually, they’re watching dailies and giving you feedback during the production, but they didn’t do that this time.”\n\n\tBekmambetov is going a step further in his embrace of the technology with a film adaptation of the book “The Man With a Shattered World.” It tells the story of Russian psychologist A.R. Luria’s attempts to help a Soviet soldier recover from a devastating brain injury by using a series of neuropsychological techniques. The film mostly unfolds in the soldier’s mind and will be an almost entirely AI-generated creation — the only professional actor in the film is the breakout star of a recent art-house hit (whom Bekmambetov declined to name).\n\t\n\n\t“Luria reprogrammed the patient’s brain, which is exactly what we’re doing now with AI,” says Bekmambetov. “He’s basically the father of AI, so it makes perfect sense to tell his story this way.”\n\n\tBut even Bekmambetov is skeptical that AI actors will put flesh-and-blood performers permanently out of work.\n\n\t“Someone like Angelina Jolie, you can instruct her, but there’s a magic there that can’t be entirely replicated,” he says. “Maybe actors will train their own AI models, which will allow them to work in different ways, but creative people can never be replaced.”\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMargot Robbie’s LuckyChap, the producer of “Barbie” and “Saltburn,” is launching LuckyChap International, a film and television company headquartered in London. Established as a joint venture with Mediawan Group, whose portfolio includes Plan B and See-Saw Films, the new entity will be led by Mona Qureshi and Tanya Qureshi. The company will officially operate across the U.K. and Europe, producing international film and television projects. It opens its doors in January. LuckyChap is run by Robbie, Tom Ackerley, Josey McNamara and Milan Popelka.\n\t\n\n\tLuckyChap’s European move follows the footsteps of Plan B which also partnered with Mediawan earlier this year to establish a base in London and tapped “Baby Reindeer” producer Ed Macdonald to run the banner. \n\n\n\tMona Qureshi joins LuckyChap after serving as a director of scripted series at Netflix UK. Tanya Qureshi most recently acted as commissioning editor in drama at the BBC. The sisters will be co-managing directors, international and bring an extensive network of relationships with creative talents having worked on such acclaimed shows as “I May Destroy You,” “The Night Manager,” “Adolescence,” and “Too Much,” among many others. The duo will oversee creative and day-to-day operations for the new company, with a primary focus on television. LuckyChap will build out a broader team across film and television in the coming months. The UK organization will work in partnership with LuckyChap’s US team. \n\n\t“We’ve always shared a deep love of storytelling, so getting to build something together at LuckyChap feels like a dream,” Mona Qureshi and Tanya Qureshi said in a joint statement. “As sisters, we’ve cheered each other on through our individual careers, and now we get to combine everything we’ve learned to grow this next chapter – literally and figuratively – side by side. The team at LuckyChap are passionate champions of distinctive voices and bold ideas, and we are thrilled to be part of expanding that mission internationally. It’s rare to find a company that leads with such heart and mischief – we can’t wait to join their ranks and continue to build in that spirit.”\n\t\n\n\tLuckyChap has established itself as a home for leading creative talents. Its films also include such award winners as “I, Tonya” and “Promising Young Woman,” and on the television side, produced the Emmy-nominated limited series “Maid” and “Sirens.” It recently wrapped production on Megan Park’s upcoming drama “Sterling Point” and reunited with “Saltburn” and “Promising Young Woman” auteur Emerald Fennell on her next film, “Wuthering Heights.” The company said that the films produced by the new venture will “reflect LuckyChap’s signature DNA” and “will be geared towards both tapping into the unique voices working in the UK / Europe.” The move also comes as the UK has become a major production hub for movies and shows, as well as the source of buzzy hits such as “Adolescence.” \n\n\t“Launching LuckyChap into the UK and Europe has been a goal of ours for a long time and we feel we’ve landed upon the perfect alchemy with this team,” LuckyChap’s partners said in a statement. “To combine Mediawan’s passion for nurturing great storytelling and their far-reaching strategic capabilities, with the incredible creative leadership of Mona and Tanya Qureshi, instinctively feels like an undeniable way to catapult this journey.  Every aspect of this international partnership feels aligned creatively, culturally, and operationally, driving forward LuckyChap’s core mission of empowering storytellers in both creative and strategic ways. Mona and Tanya’s rich and storied experience in this industry speaks for itself and we couldn’t be more excited to work with them, and our friends at Mediawan, in building something special.”\n\n\tLaunched in 2015 by Pierre-Antoine Capton, Xavier Niel, and Matthieu Pigasse, Mediawan is based and France and has established itself as one of Europe’s biggest independent studios. It produces more than 400 titles each year across drama, unscripted, documentary, cinema and animated original content through 80 production labels operating in 14 countries. These include Miraculous Corp., Palomar, Leonine Studios, Chapter 2 and Chi-Fou-Mi. \n\n\t“We are thrilled to support LuckyChap’s talented teams in this new and pivotal step of their development. At Mediawan’s, since our creation, our mission has always been to champion creative excellence and outstanding stories from the best talents around the world,”  Capton said in a statement on behalf of Mediawan. “This partnership perfectly embodies our ambitions for global growth, especially through the creation of strategic and innovative collaborations. Their presence in the UK, which is a true bridge between the creative industries of America and Europe, under the leadership of the acclaimed duo Mona Qureshi and Tanya Qureshi, will open up new opportunities for us to keep producing premium content and sharing it with a wide audience. As a leading studio in Europe, we are excited to be able to offer LuckyChap our expertise and know-how in order to support their growth and creativity.”\n\t\n\n\tThe strategic partnership and investment emerged from ongoing conversations between LuckyChap and Mediawan Group. It’s a major coup for Capton who led the discussions with Mediawan. The venture is LuckyChap majority-owned and controlled with Mediawan having a minority stake.\n\n\tMona Qureshi started her career as an assistant at BBC Films in the late ’90s, where she remained as a development executive through several titles. She continued to work in development and production for Ruby Films and The Ink Factory. Her credits included feature films “Brick Lane” for FilmFour, “The Other Boleyn Girl” for Sony/BBC, “Small Island” for BBC Drama, and Susanne Bier’s Emmy award winning adaptation of John le Carre’s “The Night Manager”, in 2015. Returning to BBC Drama as Commissioning Editor for England in 2017, she was responsible for a diverse portfolio of shows including: Chan Wook Park’s “The Little Drummer Girl,” “Les Misérables,” BAFTA award-winning “Sitting In Limbo”, Mira Nair’s “A Suitable Boy”, “This Is Going To Hurt”, starring Ben Whishaw, “The Responder”, starring Martin Freeman and Hugo Blick’s “The English.”. In 2022, she moved to Netflix UK’s original series team to lead the partner-led drama slate. She has seen a great range of titles through to their debut on Netflix including “Adolescence,” “Dept Q” from writer-director Scott Frank, Lena Dunham’s “Too Much”, and films “Joy” and “Steve.”\n\n\tTanya Qureshi is currently at the BBC as a commissioning editor in drama, where she is working across a slate including the recently released “Riot Women” from Sally Wainwright and the upcoming “Waiting for the Out” from Dennis Kelly, as well as the comedies “Ludwig”, “Amandaland” and upcoming “Can You Keep A Secret?” with Dawn French. Prior to this Tanya Qureshi was the head of comedy at the BBC for four years where she was across department strategy, shaping the slate and managing budgets. Before Tanya Qureshi joined the BBC, she worked at the BAFTA Award-winning production company Various Artists managing an extensive slate of both new and experienced writers and performers, as well as producing such series as Jon Brown’s “Dead Pixels” and most notably Michaela Coel’s “I May Destroy You.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA potentially explosive doc titled “Elon Musk Unveiled – The Tesla Experiment”  is set to launch from the upcoming IDFA documentary festival in Amsterdam, where its Nov. 16 premiere will be attended by several former Tesla employees, insiders and whistleblowers who spoke out.\n\n\t“I had a moral obligation to tell the world what is really going on behind the curtain,” says former Tesla autopilot employee John Bernal in the doc’s trailer, which Variety is launching exclusively (watch above).\n\t\n\n\t“Elon Musk Unveiled” “pulls back the curtain on Musk’s empire, as close confidants, whistleblowers, victims and former high-ranking Tesla employees speak out,” says the doc’s logline. “Their testimonies expose hidden data and buried defects in the race for self-driving cars — where unchecked ambition costs lives and challenges Big Tech’s most powerful titan.”\n\n\t“For the very first time, we get a really close insight of how Tesla works and how Elon Musk is managing his company,” producer Christian Beetz, CEO of Beetz Brothers, tells Variety. \n\n\tAfter he launches “Elon Musk Unveiled” on the European festival circuit, Beetz is very keen to also bring the doc to U.S. audiences.\n\n\tProduced by Germany’s Beetz Brothers and directed by Andreas Pichler (“The Milk System”), “Tesla Experiment” takes its cue from 100GB of leaked internal data provided by a whistleblower named Lukasz Krupski, who worked for Tesla in Norway, to German business newspaper Handelsblatt. \n\n\tThe “Tesla Experiment” weaves three interconnected narratives. The first one is a storyline “that examines Musk’s grip on Tesla and his transformation from tech entrepreneur to political strategist,” according to promotional materials. The second is “victim stories, which focus on personal tragedies caused by Tesla’s autopilot, contrasting Musk’s grand technological ambitions with the real suffering of those left behind.” And the third delves into investigations into Musk following journalists and lawyers uncovering the inner workings of Tesla through leaked data and “revealing a pattern of cover-ups, regulatory evasion, and a growing entanglement between Musk’s empire and political power,” the materials say.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s a good thing that there are people like Musk who have this ‘move fast, break things mentality’ which aims to bring new ideas and innovation into our societies,” said Yara Hueck Costa, an executive producer on the doc. “But of course, there’s a risk. And in this case, people are dying for this technology because they are testing the technology on our streets.”\n\n\t“Elon Musk Unveiled – The Tesla Experiment” is a Beetz Brothers film production in coproduction with HR, SWR, WDR and NDR for German broadcaster ARD and Comcast-owned pay-TV service Sky, and in collaboration with Handelsblatt.\n\n\tThe high-profile doc is being sold by Mediawan Rights, the sales unit of European media conglomerate Mediawan. Mediawan owns Germany’s Leonine Studios that, in turn, owns Beetz Brothers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBerto Romero’s “Five More Minutes,” a Movistar Plus+ original produced by The Mediapro Studio’s El Terrat and Ikiru Films, has had its international sales rights acquired by Barcelona studio Filmax. \n\n\tAs announced, Filmax already handles upcoming distribution in Spain. It will show first images at this week’s American Film Market. \n\n\t“Five More Minutes” marks the first feature as a writer-star from comedian Romero who broke out to huge fame in Spain as a fixture on Andreu Buenafuente’s “Late Motiv,” Spain’s biggest late-night show over 2016-21, as a comedic advice columnist. \n\t\n\n\tAnnounced in January this year at a presentation of Movistar Plus+’s movie slate which also included Oliver Laxe’s Cannes Jury Award winner “Sirât” and the upcoming “The Beloved” from Rodrigo Sorogoyen, starring Javier Bardem, “Five More Minutes” is directed by popular Spanish helmer Javier Ruiz Caldera whose “Wolfgang” currently rates as the third highest-grossing Spanish film of 2025, scoring €4.0 million ($4.6 million) at theaters in Spain. \n\n\n\tAlso toplining Javier Cámara, star of Almodóvar’s “Talk to Her” and Cesc Gay’s “Truman,” and Belén Cuesta, a best actress Goya winner for “The Endless Trench,” “Five More Minutes” weighs in as a return to the genre hybrid – a dark, horror-laced fantasy comedy-thriller – which Romero worked so well in his second series for Movistar Plus, 2023’s “The Other Side.” \n\n\t“I’m a stand-up comic, TV, radio. But I’m more interested in hybrid genre than pure comedy,” Romero has told Variety.\n\t\n\n\tIn “Five More Minutes,” an on-the-rocks couple retreat to a secluded countryside house for the weekend to try to repair their marriage. They are greeted by the singular head of the real estate agency who shows them around the place and hands over the keys. Just before he leaves, however, the entire world slips into a time loop, and the last five minutes begin to repeat endlessly.\n\n\t“Five More Minutes” is produced by Ikiru’s Edmon Roch (“The Perfume”), Mediapro’s Laura Fernández Espeso (“The 47,” “The Good Boss”) and Berto Romero and The Mediapro Studio’s Javier Méndez (“The 47,” “The Good Boss”), as well as Guillermo Farré (“Sirat,” “Sundays”) and Fran Araújo (“Sirat,” “Sundays”) from Movistar Plus+. Clara Valle serves as executive producer. Key cast also takes in Carlos Bernardino (“Love and Revolution”), Marc Soler (“Celeste”) and Clàudia Melo (“On the Fringe”). \n\n\t“We are so excited to have “Five More Minutes”in our line-up. It is a really great project and has such wonderful commercial potential, so we can’t wait to present it to buyers at this year’s AFM,” said Ivan Díaz, head of international at Filmax.\n\n\t“The creatives and production crew behind this film are some of the best in the trade and from the first moment the script landed on our desks, we knew we wanted to be a part of this project,” he added. “The film is truly original and plays so masterfully with the concept of time. The mix of genres is irresistible, including elements of thriller, horror and dark comedy, all of which fit brilliantly with our slate and with our usual clients. We’re sure it’s going to be one of the films of the year in Spain in 2026.”\n\n\tCombining “narrative rhythm, wit and a visual sensibility that connects very well with audiences,” Filmax said in a statement Wednesday, Ruiz Caldera has also directed local cinema parody “Spanish Movie” (2009), super-hero satire “Superlópez” (2018) and the seven Goya-nominated “Three Many Weddings” (2013). They have grossed $10.9 million, $14.3 million and $8.5 million respectively in Spain.   \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Ip Man: Kung Fu Legend,” the sequel to 2021’s “Ip Man: Kung Fu Master,” has secured distribution deals across multiple territories ahead of its January 2026 China release, it was revealed at the American Film Market (AFM). \n\n\tWell Go USA has acquired North American rights to the martial arts film, which is currently in post-production. Splendid Film will handle distribution in Germany, while Chantier Films has taken Turkey. Exponenta Film secured Russia and the CIS region, and Prima Cinema will release the film in Indonesia.\n\t\n\n\tThe project marks director Li Liming’s return after helming the previous installment, which Magnolia distributed in the U.S. Dennis To reprises his role as Wing Chun grandmaster Ip Man who trained Bruce Lee, a character he has portrayed multiple times including in Herman Yau’s “Ip Man: The Legend is Born” and Jeffrey Lau’s “Kung Fu League.” To trained under Ip Man’s son.\n\n\n\tThe cast also features Zhou Xiaofei, who appeared in Wong Kar Wai’s “The Grandmaster,” “The Karate Kid,” and “Ip Man 4: The Finale,” along with Steven Dasz from “Chinese Zodiac,” “Man of Tai Chi,” and “The Wandering Earth 3.” Zhang Tingfei, known for Zhang Yimou’s “Coming Home” and “The Listener,” rounds out the ensemble.\n\n\tSun Fei choreographed the action sequences, bringing experience from “Warriors of Heaven and Earth,” Feng Xiaogang’s “The Banquet,” and “Ip Man: Kung Fu Master.”\n\n\tThe film follows 2021’s “Ip Man: Kung Fu Master,” which also starred To and gained international recognition for its fresh perspective on the martial arts icon. Beijing Huiyong Film and Television Media Co. is producing the project in partnership with Oscar-nominated U.S. distributor Well Go, known for delivering premium action, genre and independent films to North American audiences.\n\t\n\n\tAll Rights Entertainment, which previously managed global distribution for “Ip Man: Kung Fu Master,” is overseeing international sales for the new installment.\n\n\tThe original “Ip Man” franchise, fronted by Donnie Yen, has become one of the most iconic martial arts film series of the 21st century. Launching in 2008 with Wilson Yip’s breakout hit “Ip Man,” the saga blends stylized action with historical drama, tracing its hero’s moral journey through Japanese occupation, Hong Kong’s post-war years, and the shifting tides of Chinese identity. Spanning four main installments and multiple spin-offs — including “Ip Man: The Final Fight” and “Master Z: The Ip Man Legacy” — the franchise has punched its way to both critical acclaim and global box office success, elevating Yen to international stardom and revitalizing the kung fu genre for a new generation.\n\n\tThe spinoff “Ip Man” films starring Dennis To carve a more traditionalist path through the martial arts biopic space, spotlighting a younger, humbler version of the Wing Chun master. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Rock had won over Christopher Nolan.\n\n\tThe “Oppenheimer” director, hardly known for making effusive public comments, was interviewing Benny Safdie about his new film “The Smashing Machine” at a Directors Guild of America screening in Los Angeles. Nolan gushed over Dwayne Johnson’s portrayal of MMA fighter Mark Kerr. “I think it’s an incredible performance,” he said, calling the portrayal “heartbreaking.” He went on: “I don’t think you’ll see a better performance this year or most other years.”\n\t\n\n\tThe comments were widely picked up, in part because they went against conventional wisdom: The screening was on Oct. 5, the Sunday of “The Smashing Machine”’s opening weekend, and when the film launched to an underwhelming $6 million in 3,300 theaters, many Oscar-race prognosticators left it for dead. But what hasn’t been widely known is that Johnson himself was sitting in the audience at the DGA, hearing an already-legendary director sing his praises.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmilio Madrid for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It was the most inspiring thing anyone has ever said about me,” Johnson, 53, tells me on Oct. 31. We’re speaking for a second time, after meeting before the film’s release, to reflect on the experience of “The Smashing Machine” being out in the world. Nolan’s praise wasn’t novel; Johnson says friends across the industry have come up to him to laud his work, and that Matt Damon, in particular, told him, “In what we do, we’re lucky enough, sometimes, to make a film that endures.” But the setting and the timing of Nolan’s words touched him deeply. \n\t\n\n\t“Once it started to sink in, I was having an out-of-body experience,” Johnson says. “I was sitting next to my wife” — singer Lauren Hashian — “and I grabbed her hand so hard, and she squeezed my hand back.” Afterward, backstage, Hashian insisted that he “actually speak, like a human being,” to Nolan. \n\n\t“I just gave him the biggest hug and the biggest kiss on the cheek,” Johnson says. “All I could say was ‘Thank you.’ And he said, ‘I meant what I said. You were heartbreaking, and the best performance of the year.’ I gave him another hug. That was all I could muster.” \n\n\tBefore he shot “The Smashing Machine,” a character drama with an indie soul, Johnson rarely allowed himself to be at a loss for words. He’s been known for playing guys who exude a confidence that, were it not so very appealing, might read as ego. Until now, the former wrestler’s biggest artistic risks have been an early role in “Southland Tales” and the dark comedy “Pain & Gain ” — and that was a Michael Bay film. Johnson refers to his career until “The Smashing Machine” as a “comfort zone,” and his audience took comfort in it too: One always knew, before the movie began, what one was getting from Johnson. \n\n\tSince emerging as the greatest crossover star WWE ever minted (he retired for good in 2019), Johnson has carried franchises from “Jumanji” to “The Fast and the Furious.” Parents of young children know him as the “Moana” antagonist-turned-ally who boastfully declares, “You’re welcome!” before being thanked. But “The Smashing Machine” reinvented him twice over — first, in giving him a complicated, angst-ridden character to play, and now, as the campaign continues and Johnson asks his peers to give the film a second look, in positioning Johnson as the one doing the thanking. Experimentation, as audiences who continue to discover “The Smashing Machine” have learned, looks good on Johnson; so, too, does taking a blow but refusing to be counted out. “You always want more people to experience the film theatrically,” Johnson says stoically. But Damon’s words have stuck with him. “We’re going to have a film that endures: That wasn’t in my vernacular. But it is that kind of movie.” \n\t\n\n\tIndeed, Safdie’s minor-key approach feels timeless. A big, brash fighting movie this isn’t; it also lacks the zany energy of the films Safdie has co-directed with his brother, Josh, like the antic thrillers “Good Time” with Robert Pattinson and “Uncut Gems” with Adam Sandler. Instead, the film takes a delicate approach to the pain Kerr must learn to live with. And if “The Smashing Machine” endures, it will be in no small part thanks to the places Johnson goes. Johnson’s character was a grappler who conquered drug addiction, relationship troubles and disappointments in the ring; like “Rocky” (the one that won best picture, not its increasingly fan-servicey sequels), “The Smashing Machine” ends with its hero in defeat, but looking hopefully to the future. \n\n\tJohnson knows how that feels now. “The story of Mark Kerr rings more true,” he says. “It cuts deeper as we roll along on the journey of this film.” A week after the release, Johnson says, “I realized, Let’s do our best. Let’s be real. Let’s endure. This is a long game. And we made a film that is the underdog.”\n\n\n\tIn 2025, the indie movie business has all but collapsed. “The Smashing Machine,” which cost a reported $50 million, will lose money at the box office for A24. And it was the first of several mid-budget “dramas for adults” this season to fall short of expectations. From “Kiss of the Spider Woman” to “After the Hunt” to “Roofman” to “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,” fall has been a season of star vehicles that played to disappointing attendance. A certain kind of movie just may not be the kind of thing audiences go to theaters for anymore. Which means that box office may be less important than ever as Oscar voters sift through to find what stands out.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmilio Madrid for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen I meet the director and stars of “The Smashing Machine” for the first time in the week of the film’s release, all of that analysis lies ahead. We’re sitting in folding chairs in the middle of a boxing ring, in a downtown Manhattan gym chosen for its resemblance to the rooms Kerr haunts in “The Smashing Machine.”\n\n\tEven before the movie comes out, the cast is aware of the shrinking theatrical environment. “A film like this that defies the curation system makes me so proud,” Emily Blunt, Johnson’s co-star, says. “I know it is getting rarer and rarer. You can’t persuade people to go see a movie anymore without a great story. I think word of mouth will be really exciting, and I hope that it can stretch out and many people can experience it.”   \n\n\tSafdie, an obsessive about accuracy, marvels at the grit and patina of the space. (He shot scenes for “The Smashing Machine” at a working MMA gym in Vancouver.) All three, dressed in formalwear for a photo shoot but with a joking, easy manner together, seem at home — this journalist, less so. (The only time I see Johnson lose his famous composure is when I trip and fall trying to climb through the ropes back out of the ring. “Easy! Easy!” he bellows, catching my arm.)\n\t\n\n\tThe fans set up to cool the space are overwhelming my recorder. So we turn them off and bear the heat. Safdie has sweat through his powder blue Gucci shirt, and Blunt periodically dabs Johnson’s head with a towel. The temperature and stench of the gym draws Blunt’s memory back to the production, when her character, Dawn Staples, rooted on her man in grotty little gyms as he made his name. “Smell of glove, smell of crotch,” she says. \n\n\tBlunt had helped forge the connection that got the project made. Johnson had long been obsessed with a 2002 documentary about Kerr, also called “The Smashing Machine,” and Blunt, his co-star in the 2021 family film “Jungle Cruise,” suggested Johnson bring the idea of adapting it to Safdie. (Blunt and Safdie had acted together in “Oppenheimer.”) \n\n\t“I feel like I was sort of the matchmaker for them dating,” Blunt says. “I didn’t want to sort of muscle my way into it.” She ended up getting cast anyway. The “fighter’s girlfriend” is a familiar trope; Heidi Gardner lampooned it on “Saturday Night Live,” pleading with her man to drop out of the big match. Dawn’s angst is more nuanced: She is genuinely impressed by what Mark can do, but she wants, with growing urgency, to feel like a part of his triumph. “The ‘girlfriend’ role — I don’t feel we straitjacketed her to that,” Blunt says, “because of Benny’s interest in seeing the full spectrum of every human being in the movie.” \n\n\tBlunt spent time with the real Staples, who was skittish about the film: “The Smashing Machine” covers a low period of her life, and she and Kerr are no longer together. “The gloves were up at first — because the documentary was made under a male gaze,” Blunt says. Staples felt she’d been forced into an impossible position in her time with Kerr: “Dawn was the one into which he decanted all his stress and addiction.” The relationship, in which Kerr and Staples took their demons out on one another, was broken. But it was real, too, and Staples wanted Blunt to be its advocate. “She wanted us to protect that — to show the tender moments, show the love, show the devotion. Yes, the devotion was mixed with destruction, but it still existed.” \n\n\tBlunt has negotiated  relationship dynamics on-screen before: Her Kitty Oppenheimer shows how spiky and complex a “wife of” character can be. Johnson, by contrast, felt a fundamental discomfort in shifting what he could do. Gaining 30 pounds of muscle and sitting for daily prosthetic applications wasn’t what he dreaded. The fear factor was the idea of digging into character.\n\t\n\n\t“I was in a comfort zone for quite some time,” Johnson says. “Making these big films — they’re hard to do, but they are comfortable. What I was scared of was exposing myself and exploring the deepest, darkest traumas.” \n\n\tBlunt had brought Safdie to the project. And she helped keep it from falling apart. Since first working together, she and Johnson had become close friends. (She casually picks up his energy drink and sips at one point, and jokes in an aside that “our ‘Jungle Cruise’ press tour almost got shut down by Disney because we were so inappropriate.”) In moments when Johnson hesitated, she urged him on. “I used to have this motto — ‘Audience first,’” Johnson says. The audience, he believed, didn’t want him to take a risk. Blunt disagreed. “Emily said, ‘I love that. It’s worked for you for decades now. But if you want to take care of the audience, show them a mirror of yourself. Isn’t that taking care of the audience too?’” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmilio Madrid for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It may not seem like it, but I have that same motto,” Safdie says. The film was aggressively test-marketed, and Safdie read every comment. Among the trickier elements of the film was Mark and Dawn’s relationship. Dawn is not equipped to date an addict in recovery, and Mark’s pursuit of the limelight doesn’t help matters either; her need for attention turns increasingly self-destructive. “I wanted the relationship to be people,” Safdie continues. “I wanted both of them to be at fault. And I wanted people to feel good at the end.” \n\n\tTo the first goal, Safdie’s shooting style lent the arguments between Mark and Dawn a special realism. In the characters’ home, Safdie used hidden cameras to keep the actors in the moment and not let them play to a particular angle. “I always want to stay out of the way,” the director says. “I want them to just be present.” \n\n\t“It adds this reality,” Blunt says, “like maybe we shouldn’t be watching — like we’re being voyeuristic. I was grateful I didn’t see cameras shooting. When I saw the film, I felt like its arms came out and pulled me inside of it. It was so visceral.”  \n\t\n\n\tAs for allowing the audience to leave feeling good — that’s a tall order, given the subject matter. And yet an extended cameo from the real Kerr in the film’s closing moments makes clear: He survived it all, and is now OK. \n\n\t“People can’t relate to the guy with his fist in the air at the end,” Blunt says. “But they can relate to the peace of being OK with yourself despite this brutal life. None of us relate to being the heavyweight champ of the world, but we all relate to struggle, and we all relate to pressure.” \n\n\tKerr’s story, as told by Safdie, Johnson and Blunt, first reached the world at the Venice Film Festival, where it won the best director prize from Alexander Payne’s jury and received a 15-minute standing ovation. During the applause, Johnson burst into tears.\n\n\tWhat was he thinking in that moment? “It’s hard to find the language for it, because it’s so emotional,” he says. “It was just validation of this seemingly once-in-a-lifetime journey. Not only for us, but also for the man who actually lived it.” Kerr was sitting next to Johnson in what the actor calls “the small seats” (though if you’re Johnson or Kerr, perhaps every seat feels small). “He was shaking throughout the film — and that final 15 minutes of the film, the emotional excavation, he’s really crying.” Johnson notes that today, fighters make millions of dollars and become famous. (He would know.) Kerr didn’t have that kind of spotlight, and he got one at Venice. “I was so happy for Mark, that audience telling him, You lived a life. And we all see ourselves in your life.”\n\n\n\tKerr’s relatable — but he’s also, plainly, one of a kind. To play him, Johnson had to transform his already-imposing frame to achieve the look of an MMA fighter. “Mark had a unicorn body,” he says. “His traps, his shoulders, his quads: Because of being a wrestler, he’s always doing takedowns, but it’s very fast-twitch fibers, so I had to put on that quality of muscle while being able to move.” \n\n\t“That tight waist is so hard when you’re gaining weight!” Safdie says as Johnson laughs ruefully. “Oh my God!” \n\n\tWhile Johnson’s body changed in a major way, the prosthetic transformation was more subtle. Safdie decided to go to a “middle ground” in terms of how far to push Johnson toward Kerr’s visage — Johnson looks incrementally more like the man he’s playing, but he isn’t lost either. “I remember talking to Dwayne and saying, ‘I want you to come through. Because I know that you’re exploring a lot of yourself in this movie. And I don’t want that to be missed.’” (And in Kerr, viewers see a bit of Safdie too — the hirsute director jokes that he sent prosthetic makeup artist Kazu Hiro a photo of his own eyebrows as a reference.)\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmilio Madrid for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJohnson’s own brows were so famous, in his WWE era, that “the People’s Eyebrow” was his trademark. His willingness to hide them, and to shift his appearance at all, emphasizes how much of a pivot point this is for Johnson: It’s a first-ever bet on his ability to disappear into character. But the film is a shift for his colleagues too: For Blunt, at 42, it’s more proof that she is willing to take on challenging auteur work ahead of next year’s one-two punch of an as-yet-untitled Steven Spielberg action film and “The Devil Wears Prada 2.” And for Safdie, 39, it’s his first solo feature film. “The Smashing Machine”’s opening weekend came just before a triumphant surprise screening of “Marty Supreme,” A24’s other 2025 sports drama directed by a Safdie, at the New York Film Festival. The coincidence fueled persistent speculation that the brothers, careerlong collaborators until Benny shot the 2023 TV series “The Curse,” had broken up acrimoniously. Safdie’s acceptance speech in Venice, in which he thanked his mother, stepfather, wife and children — but not Josh — furthered the chatter. \n\n\tSafdie seems unfazed by the conjecture, but mildly surprised that it keeps coming up. “In that moment, I was thinking about this movie,” he says.\n\n\t“It’s also your night,” Blunt says. \n\n\t“I was talking about this movie. That’s where that came from.” The gossip about a rift, he says, “was shocking. Like, Oh, wow, that’s weird.” \n\n\t“Did people react like that? That’s so weird,” Blunt says. “You are allowed to be a single entity.” \n\n\t“We did great things together, and we learned in that process, and it just came to a place where it’s like, What do you want to explore, and what do I want to explore? And you just do that.” (When we speak, Safdie hasn’t yet seen “Marty Supreme,” but says that his brother has seen “The Smashing Machine.”)\n\t\n\n\tJohnson is doing a different sort of setting out on his own: After years of trusting his philosophy of serving moviegoers  what they’ve been trained to expect, he’s now daring them to come along for a melancholy yet exhilarating ride.\n\n\t“These guys know this,” Johnson says. “For me, this has not been my …” He seems to lose his train of thought, and begins again. “Opening week. This is opening week. I had not experienced this until this film — I have not thought about box office once. Not once.” \n\n\t“What a relief,” Blunt says. In conversation, she has a tendency to pick up the threads Johnson drops. “You also know that if the movie doesn’t work, they’re coming for you, and it is personal — and it hurts that it’s personal. But there’s a myriad of other reasons why a movie might not work, but they would come swinging for you. Exposure to that is not really for the faint of heart.” \n\n\t“But there’s a real beauty in that,” Johnson says. “Like Mark Kerr — we’re OK.” \n\n\tAnd he has no regrets. The experience of making the film has “completely changed everything,” he says. “In ways that I could expect, perhaps in ways that I was hoping. But it completely changed the way I look at stories.” For decades, Johnson was a leading man for hire. Now, bruised but undefeated, he’s looking at captaining his own projects.\n\n\t“From ‘Smashing Machine’ forward,” he says, “I will make movies for me. Because they’re my dream. Not anyone else’s.” \n\n\n\tOne such dream is “Lizard Music,” Benny Safdie’s next film. It’s an adaptation of Daniel Pinkwater’s anarchic 1976 young-adult novel about a child left home alone who hears music coming from another dimension. (When we Zoom in late October, Johnson has his copy just out of frame, pulling it in when I mention the title. “I always keep it close!” he laughs.)\n\n\tYoung Victor, in the story, enlists the oddball Chicken Man (Johnson) to help figure out the source of this otherworldly music. Like many YA books of its era, it presumes a certain level of sophistication, and curiosity, on the part of the reader.\n\n\t“There’s something about what that book does to kids,” Safdie says. “It gives them a license to feel independent.” \n\n\t“I am that little kid,” Johnson says. “To watch my parents go through these things and to clearly see that things weren’t great.” \n\t\n\n\t“Can I be a lizard?” Blunt asks, to lighten the mood. “I’ll be any lizard you want!” \n\n\tIt was another aspect of Johnson’s life story that made it into his performance — and that Christopher Nolan spotted. Johnson recalls that the director made special mention of the way Johnson, in character, reacted when confronted over his drug use by his best friend (played by real-life mixed martial artist Ryan Bader). Lying in a hospital bed, Johnson’s Mark pulls the sheets over his head, so as not to be seen crying. “If I say to you, ‘I understand,’ what I’m saying is I’ve lived it,” he says. “I’ve reached this point in my life, my fifth level, where if I say I understand, that’s because I’ve lived it. I lived that moment.” \n\n\tJohnson had been with his mother when she received a diagnosis of Stage 3 lung cancer. “When you’re diagnosed with that, you have to start planning things you don’t want to plan,” he says. “The doctor comes in and says, ‘We’re going to do our best to take care of you.’ In that moment, she pulled her sheets over her face and just starts bawling.” Johnson had seen his mother cry before, but never like this: “It’s almost like she got reduced to being a little girl, just wanting to hide away.” Johnson did something his franchise movies had never compelled him to do. “I took that moment,” he says, “and applied it.” \n\n\tTo permit oneself to go to a place like that requires vulnerability — no easy thing for a man whose stock-in-trade has been toughness. “What this has allowed me to do — and perhaps I didn’t realize this in the past — is, when I find something, whatever it is, I can give my complete heart and soul,” he says. “And I want and need them to be different from each other. I’m not looking to deliver more of the same. For decades, it was audience first. But the thing that sets my soul first is an idea of audience first as my full self. My complete self.”\n\n\tThis is deep into my second conversation with Johnson, and I’m surprised by these words, this insistence on new challenges from the king of the franchises, despite my familiarity with him by now — so much so that I refocus my eyes on the Zoom window. There he is, the same figure I’ve seen so many times before: shiny dome, broad shoulders. His long-sleeved T-shirt is printed with what may as well be a new slogan for a film that’s been against the ropes, but isn’t out yet. It reads, “Vanquish.”\n\n\t\n\t\tLocation: Church Street Boxing Gym; Styling (Blunt): Jessica Paster; Hair (Blunt): Laini Reeves/Tomlinson Management Group; Makeup (Blunt): Jenn Streicher/The Co-op Collective; Styling (Johnson): Ilaria Urbinati/The Wall Group; Makeup (Johnson): Bjoern Rehbein/United Talent; Barber (Johnson): Rachel Solow; Clothing (Blunt): Dress: Santicler; Shoes: Gianvito Rossi; Jewelry: Azlee; Clothing (Johnson): Shirt and Pants: Dolce & Gabbana; Shoes: Santoni; IWC: Watch; John Hardy: Chain\t\n",

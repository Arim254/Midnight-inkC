    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tFreida McFadden’s “The Housemaid” is back to the top of bestseller lists again following the release of the film adaptation starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried. \n\n\tThe psychological thriller, originally a breakout hit when it first came out in 2022, is set on Long Island and centered on a down-on-her-luck young woman who takes a job as a live-in housemaid for an affluent couple only to unearth a labyrinth of deception and danger. The Lionsgate adaptation is directed by by Paul Feig and stars Sweeney as Millie Calloway and Seyfried as the mysterious Nina Winchester. The adaptation released on Dec. 19 opened to a robust $8 million domestic box office on Friday night.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tLionsgate acquired the rights to the book in 2022 in a competitive deal that signaled early studio confidence in the property, and by 2024 the adaptation had locked in its high-profile cast and creative team. Rebecca Sonnenshine, known for her work on “The Boys,” adapted the screenplay, with Feig, whose credits range from “A Simple Favor” to “Bridesmaids.”\n\n\tWith its theatrical debut fresh, “The Housemaid” has reentered bestseller lists, climbing not just for the original novel but also for its sequels: “The Housemaid’s Secret” and “The Housemaid Is Watching.” The franchise’s expanded universe, including spin-off stories and short fiction, has given readers reasons to revisit McFadden’s work and new readers a clear entry point into the world.\n\n\tThe adaptation is “a screw-tightening domestic thriller, is nothing more (or less) than a garishly fun and effective piece of postfeminist pulp,” wrote Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman in his review. \n\n\n\tPurchase “The Housemaid” book series on Amazon.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron was the butt of one of Amy Poehler‘s most ruthless Golden Globes jokes, one he’s now calling an “ignorant dig” at his expense. Speaking in a recent interview with The New York Times, the “Titanic” Oscar winner said Poehler took things “too far” when she poked fun at his marriage to Bigelow.\n\n\tPoehler’s joke was made at the 2013 Golden Globes, where Kathryn Bigelow was a best director nominee thanks to “Zero Dark Thirty.” During her opening monologue with co-host Tina Fey, Poehler nodded to the controversy around the film’s depiction of torture by quipping: “When it comes to torture, I trust the lady who spent three years married to James Cameron.” The audience was visibly shocked by the joke, with Bigelow’s “Zero Dark Thirty” star Jessica Chastain jaw-dropped.\n\t\n\n\t“Amy Poehler’s remark was an ignorant dig, at an event which is supposed to be a celebration of cinema and filmmakers, not a roast,” Cameron now told The Times. “I’m pretty thick-skinned, and happy to be the butt of a good-natured joke, but that went too far. The fact that people found it funny shows exactly what they think of me, even though they have no idea who I am or how I work.”\n\n\n\tCameron noted Hollywood pit the two directors against each other during the 2009-2010 awards season, as “Avatar” faced off against “The Hurt Locker” at various events, including the Oscars. Bigelow prevailed over Cameron to win the Oscar for best director, while “The Hurt Locker” also won best picture.\n\n\t“I was the first one on my feet applauding,” Cameron noted about when Bigelow won the Oscar over for him. “Kathryn and I thought the whole meta-narrative around us was pretty funny. I was a little concerned that it would just take away from her credibility as a filmmaker. It started to turn into a conversation that wasn’t about her film, and that bothered both of us.” \n\t\n\n\tCameron and Bigelow were married from 1989 to 1991. Their romantic relationship extended to their professional careers, as Cameron developed and executive produced Bigelow’s 1991 action movie “Point Break” and co-wrote her 1995 thriller “Strange Days.” Cameron recently made headlines for telling The Hollywood Reporter that he deserved full screenwriting credit on “Point Break,” saying:  “I flat out got stiffed by the Writers Guild on that. It was bullshit.”\n\n\t“Point Break’s” credited writer W. Peter Iliff reacted in a statement to People: “Jim Cameron is my hero. I am perhaps his biggest fan, and so grateful for his fabulous work on ‘Point Break.’ There’s enough glory for everybody and it’s great that Jim should be recognized for his work that made ‘Point Break’ the movie that it became. It’s funny, the film just seems to endure as the years go by, but he’s the king and I can’t wait to see his new movie. We’ve all loved everything he has ever done.” \n\n\tHead over to The New York Times’ website to read Cameron’s profile in its entirey.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Stranger Things” co-creator Ross Duffer has revealed the runtimes for the final four episodes of the series.\n\n\tAfter the first four episodes of Season 5 were released on Nov. 26, “Stranger Things” will return for another three episodes on Christmas Day, with the series finale coming on New Year’s Eve. Episode 5, titled “Shock Jock,” is one hour and eight minutes long, and Episode 6, “Escape from Camazotz,” will run for one hour and 15 minutes, according to Duffer’s Instagram post. Episode 7, titled “The Bridge,” goes back down to one hour and six minutes. Closing out the Netflix sci-fi hit once and for all is Episode 8, “The Rightside Up,” which is the longest episode of the season at two hours and eight minutes.\n\t\n\n\tThe last episodes are close in length to the first batch of Season 5, in opposition to viral posts on social media and a report from Puck News that claimed the entire season would range from 90 minutes to two hours long. Those rumors were likely influenced by the much-talked-about runtimes of Season 4: After the first three seasons consisted largely of hour-long episodes, the fourth season expanded to a 70-minute minimum, with the final three episodes all being movie-length. “The Piggyback,” the Season 4 finale, ran for a whopping two hours and 22 minutes.\n\n\n\tDuffer created “Stranger Things” with his brother Matt Duffer. The Duffers executive produce the series via their Upside Down Pictures banner alongside Shawn Levy of 21 Laps Entertainment and Dan Cohen.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This interview contains spoilers from Season 5 of “Emily in Paris.”\n\n\tDarren Star had come a long way with his eye-candied romantic comedy series “Emily in Paris,” which was first met with a Parisian shrug when it bowed on Netflix in 2020 and has now been embraced by millions, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who named Star Knight of the Legion of Honor for his contribution to the country earlier this week.\n\t\n\n\tWhen Star set off to create “Emily in Paris,” he didn’t anticipate that it would become such a pop-culture juggernaut that would boast the French economy — driving double-digit growth in tourism — and trigger a feud between political leaders (such as Macron and Rome Mayor) over filming locations.\n\n\n\t“You can’t imagine something like that,” Star tells Variety of the show’s cultural and economic weight during a sit-down interview at the mythical Hôtel Plaza Athénée in Paris. “What I wanted to convey was this excitement about visiting another country and coming to Paris, because America is such a big country and not everybody travels,” he says. \n\n\tIn Season 5, which he calls his favorite so far, Star has deliberately given “Emily in Paris” more edge, letting his characters stumble.\n\n\t“I actually wanted failure to be part of the story,” he says. “It can’t always be success, success, success. I think I wanted this Rome chapter, but I also wanted Sylvie to fail because it’s not easy trying to manage a business in two different countries.” \n\n\tHe’s also turned on the heat in a major way, bringing the show closer to “Sex and the City.”  One of the most unexpected plot twist of the show is Ashley Park’s Mindy engaging in a steamy romp and having sizzling chemistry — with Emily’s ex, Alfie (Lucien Laviscount). \n\t\n\n\t“I think of them [‘Emily in Paris’ and ‘Sex and the City’] as two separate animals completely,” he says. “But to me, ‘Emily in Paris’ was always more of a romance, a romantic comedy. I think it’s the characters who have evolved. I think that it’s definitely, let’s say, becoming more adult, more passionate.”And while Lucas Bravo’s Gabriel looks noticeably hunkier with a Californian tan and big muscles in Season 5, he’s no longer Emily’s boyfriend, as she embarks on a new romance with her Italian beau, Marcello (Eugenio Franceschini). Whether Gabriel returns again remains open, though Star says, “I can’t imagine the series without Gabriel.”\n\n\tSeason 5 also introduces colorful newcomers, like Minnie Driver, who plays a a penniless princess turned hustler who unexpectedly becomes Agence Grateau’s white knight. Star says she’s “set to return” if Season 6 gets greenlit by Netflix. “She took what I wrote and just took it to the next level,” Star says of her performance. \n\n\tAs for the future of “Emily in Paris,” Star says he’s nowhere near done with the show. He will keep going “as long as they’ll have us.” “I think when characters have a lot of life to them, they feel so real. They’re always going to have stories,” he says. \n\n\tYou said Season 5 was your favorite so far. Why?\n\n\tExcept for the first one. Because in the first one, everything was so new. But I think in this season, there’s just like new energy. I think the characters have so much growth. We see a lot more vulnerability. I think Emily matures a lot. I love seeing Sylvie’s character express more vulnerability and insecurity. I think, psychologically, we learned a little bit more about both of them.I was really surprised that you’re showing these characters do things that Americans tend to consider taboo behavior, like cheating.\n\n\tBecause I always love to see characters make mistakes. It’s how you learn, and it’s human. I think it humanizes our characters. I wouldn’t say that Mindy was cheating, if that’s what you’re referring to?I mean, she’s cheating on her friend.\n\n\tShe’s cheating on her friend, not telling her, and it’s just something that happens and something she thought was not going to have any repercussions. And she’d keep quiet and not imagine the feelings that might develop and how it would play out. And I think a lot of the things she did were an effort to protect Emily. But in those situations, it’s like trying to keep things secret that just backfire.\n\n\tThose flaws make the characters more relatable.\n\n\tYeah, absolutely. I think that was what was behind us and even talking to the actors about it, talking to Lily and talking to Ashley. I think Ashley was a little nervous. “Oh, my God. I don’t want to betray Mindy!” But I think the idea that they would have a rift between them that would get resolved also can have the effect in the end of deepening their friendship.That actually reminded me of “Sex and the City” because it’s such a big show about female friendship.\n\n\tAnd friendships sometimes they follow a rocky path. And I think the friendships that endure are the ones that can overcome those obstacles. I think by this fifth season, the show has to grow more. It can’t just stay still. I think also the audience, they know the characters, and I think it’s nice to challenge the audience, as well and have the character not always behave in the most scripted, predictable ways.I remember when you did Season one, you got a lot of pushback. Some people thought it was too stereotypical.\n\n\tI think Season 1 was so much — whether you call it stereotypical or not — about a young woman without a lot of experience who hadn’t traveled, who’s coming to Paris for the first time with her American sense of over-enthusiasm and pretty much zero knowledge of Paris or France. She was fairly ignorant but tried to make up for that with her excitement about being in Paris. That’s what so much of season one was about. By season five, it can’t be about that anymore because she’s accustomed to being in Paris. She’s comfortable here. Emily’s learning French. And so it becomes more about the characters and their journey.Speaking of characters evolving, Gabriel looks stunning in this season. He said that he went to the gym to get the muscles and to look tan. Where did the decision to make him even hunkier come from?\n\n\tWell, that’s his decision, I don’t put any of those demands on my actors! I don’t say, “You have to go to the gym.” I think that’s all on Lucas Bravo, and he looks fantastic. The focus of the season wasn’t about Emily and Gabriel, which has also really changed the energy of the show. Emily had a new love interest for the entire season, and Gabriel did play a part in the show. I think that also their scenes together had a little nostalgia to them, which I think spoke to the idea that the show has matured, that these characters already have a past together. It doesn’t mean that there’s not a future, but the fact that they have a past means that they already have a relationship with some depth and memories and good times and bad times.That scene at the train station, at Le Train Bleu, was touching because it feels Lily and Lucas are also speaking about their time together on the show.\n\n\tYes, I love that scene. They’ve been through a lot together. I think that what came through to me in that scene is the love that they sincerely have for one another.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCAROLINE DUBOIS/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIs Gabriel going to come back in “Emily in Paris” or is he gone forever?\n\n\tI can’t imagine the show without Gabriel.Okay, so he’s going to come back.\n\n\tYes, we don’t have a Season 6, but I think I’m always curious to follow Gabriel’s journey and how it intersects or not with Emily’s.Is Gabriel like Emily’s “Mr. Big”?\n\n\tI don’t want to always think it has to follow the same playbook. But yes, I think he’s certainly a big love of Emily’s life. Whether they’re meant for each other, that’s not the question.You also brought new characters in this season, like Minnie Driver, who plays such a good hustler. How did you think of her?\n\n\tShe’s hilarious. I know Minnie Driver personally. I know her work. I’m a big fan of hers. And so when I developed the character, I just thought she would just be the perfect person to step into those shoes. And I think she just nailed it beyond what I hoped, actually. She just completely got it. I feel like she took what I wrote and just took it to the next level.So you’re making her a recurring character, right?\n\n\tIf we have a Season 6, she’s set to come back.Michèle Laroque is also a great find!\n\n\tLove her. I was familiar with her, but really, it was our casting director, Juliette Ménager, when we wrote this character, she said, “Michèle Laroque!” and immediately I was like, “Yes, please! Let’s see if she’s available.” And she was, and I think she’s just perfection on the show.\n\n\tJuliette Ménager told me you’re highly involved in casting and sometimes it takes you seconds to determine if the actor is the character or not.\n\n\tI have a strong sense of it. I do. Because in my mind I see the character, I don’t necessarily see the actor. But when I see the character and then the actor who matches what my vision is, I know it’s the right fit. Sometimes it doesn’t matter what’s on the résumé of an actor.I heard you had envisioned someone different to play Sylvie and ultimately chose Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu who nails it.\n\n\tI did. In that case, I envisioned somebody younger than Philippine. When I saw Philippine, it made me rethink the character because I just felt like Philippine was so terrific and just embodied that sense of the ideal, of that unapproachable French woman who has that incredibly chic, untouchable quality that would intimidate any American.\n\n\tShe was so good in this season, she showed some range!\n\n\tI love writing for her.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGIULIA PARMIGIANI/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen she’s in the editing room, chain smoking, it was hilarious.\n\n\tWe had probably 30 minutes of that that could have been in the show. Because she just went crazy. This season, I love exploring Sylvie’s insecurities because I think as she’s an intense character, we don’t always get to see behind the curtain of what makes her tick. We’ve only seen her put together, but we don’t see the insecurities and some of the neuroses that are behind the scenes.She started off as a crazy French boss in Season 1, and now she’s almost endearing.\n\n\tI’ve always been rooting for Sylvie, even at the beginning!The fashion this season seems a bit more toned down, understated.\n\n\tYes, it was conscious. I think Rome is a little looser and not as structured as Paris, let’s say. And I think Emily also coming into her own is a little more confident in her style.So the show is partly set in Rome. I was really surprised that the Rome adventure fails, and we see them going back to Paris. I kept wondering, is it because President Macron declared his love for Emily (and said he would fight to bring the show back to Paris)?\n\n\tNo, I mean, I was really flattered and amused that they (the French President and Rome Mayor) were fighting over Emily in Paris. But I think in reality, there was never a moment where the show was going to become Emily in Rome in any real permanent way. It’s always Emily in Paris.I actually wanted failure to be part of the story. It’s like it can’t always be success, success, success. I think I wanted this Rome chapter, but I also wanted Sylvie to fail because it’s not easy trying to manage a business in two different countries. She bit off a little more than she could chew. But also, I think this season, the storyline starts in Rome and does continue in Paris and then ends in Venice. It wasn’t like the storyline in Rome ended and then in Paris, we’re just off to something completely different. There’s still a connection between what happens in Rome and what happens in Paris.Brigitte Macron actually made a cameo in Season 4! Could Emmanuel Macron be next?I asked him! So we’ll see what happens.And so you’ve just received the Legion of Honor for your contribution to France, which is so huge!It was an incredible honor. I was so moved and humbled by all of it. I received it from President Macron, and it was just an incredible moment, really.Did you ever imagine that this show would have such a huge impact, culturally and economically, on France?\n\n\tNo, you can’t imagine something like that. I was thinking, how can I write a show that’s going to connect with the audience? First of all, I’m never 100% happy as a writer. You’re always like, “Oh, it could have been a little better.” But I just wanted to do a show that was in my heart and hoped it connected with the audience.Did “Sex and the City” have such a big impact on New York?\n\n\tI don’t know that it had this impact. I know that I hear about it. People would say, “I moved to New York because of ‘Sex and the City.’” I do hear that a lot. But I think what President Macron said was that 38% of tourists coming to Paris were coming because they were inspired by “Emily in Paris.” But really, for me, the reason that the show had a purpose for me in the sense that I wanted to really express my love of travel, my love of Paris, and to inspire people to travel. In that sense, that’s what I hoped the show would do, and it did. That is incredibly gratifying to see that it had that effect because what I wanted to convey was this excitement about visiting another country and coming to Paris, because America is such a big country and not everybody travels. I don’t even know the percentage of people that have passports in the U.S. But I just wanted a show that would inspire young people to travel.Do you think you’ve also inspired Mike White to come to France for the fourth season of “The White Lotus”?\n\n\tI don’t know, Mike White doesn’t need me to inspire him! I’m a huge Mike White fan, and I love “The White Lotus,” and I know him, and I think he’s just a brilliant guy.How many more seasons of “Emily in Paris” do you think you’ll do?\n\n\tI don’t know, as long as they’ll have us.You have many more stories in your head?\n\n\tYou know what? It’s not that I have so many stories in my head. I think when characters have a lot of life to them, they feel so real. They’re always going to have stories.\n\n\tSeason 5 is so much sexier than previous ones and has a bit more of that “Sex and the City” edge.\n\n\tWell, really, I think of them as two separate animals completely. But to me, “Emily in Paris” was always more of a romance, a romantic comedy. I think it’s the characters who have evolved. I think it’s always been there for Sylvie. I think that it’s definitely, let’s say, becoming more adult, more passionate.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCBS News is increasingly looking like something out of a scripted drama by Aaron Sorkin.\n\n\tIn shows like “The Newsroom” and “Sports Night,” the well-regarded writer sketched stories of feisty media outlets just trying to get news to the people, even though doing so sometimes brought unwanted scrutiny that could reflect poorly on their corporate parents while they were enmeshed in deal making, or just trying to keep revenue flowing. \n\n\n\tFictional media titans like Continental Corp. and Atlantis World Media, however, have nothing on the current antics taking place at CBS News and its owner, Paramount Skydance. The media conglomerate, recently put under the aegis of CEO David Ellison, in October placed CBS News under the editorial supervision of Bari Weiss, a digital provocateur whose opinion site, The Free Press, had at the time cultivated just 170,000 paid subscribers. A spate of unforced errors by Weiss has kept scrutiny high on CBS News — and not for its shows or reportage.\n\t\n\n\tThe latest gaffe unfolded over the weekend, when CBS News revealed that a “60 Minutes” segment reported by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi and centered on the on-screen accounts of Venezuelan men deported by the U.S. to prison in El Salvador had been shelved just hours before Sunday’s broadcast. As disclosed by an email sent to colleagues by Alfonsi, the decision was made by Weiss, who insisted that Trump officials appear in the report to comment on camera, even though Alfonsi’s team had made good faith efforts to secure response ahead of filing the report for legal review. “The public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship,” Alfonsi said in her memo.\n\t\n\n\t CBS News staffers find the decisions made over the past few days “distressing” and “ominous,” according to two people familiar with the newsroom. Remarks made Monday by Weiss at CBS News’ daily editorial  meeting did little to reassure. “The only newsroom I’m interested in is one in which we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest editorial matters with respect, and, crucially, where we assume the best intent of our colleagues,” she said. “Anything else is absolutely unacceptable.” She did not explain why she waited until after the “60 Minutes” segment was publicized before taking concrete action. “Our viewers come first. Not the listing schedule or anything else,” Weiss said. “That’s my north star and I hope it’s yours too.”\n\n\tParamount can ill afford negative scrutiny in this current moment. The company, backed by the Ellison family, is trying to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, even though that conglomerate’s board has already struck a deal to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix. One of Paramount’s talking points is that it will serve as a good home for Warner’s CNN, a news outlet with a storied brand but a troubled business outlook. Every time Weiss blunders, it raises a cloud over Paramount’s ability to steady media properties. amid a difficult operating climate — and, more critically, help them flourish.\n\n\tCBS News declined to make executives available for comment.\n\n\tWeiss’ motivations may have been in earnest. To be sure, every piece of journalism can probably be improved ahead of its publication. Still, the process was allowed to continue so that the segment to be promoted via CBS News’ publicity team, and the segment had passed multiple reviews by standards and practices, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\n\tAnd that’s not just because of the strange decision-making timeline. CBS News and “60 Minutes” have been under a microscope for months, with previous Paramount management agreeing to pay a $16 million settlement to rid the company of flimsy legal charges that the show cast former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris in a more favorable light than now-President Donald Trump ahead of the 2024 election. Paramount’s decision undermined the newsmagazine’s credibility. Recent decisions by Paramount’s new management have only exacerbated the situation, and Weiss’ is likely to further wear away at its journalism bona fides.\n\t\n\n\tThere is some portion of CBS News staffers who believe “60 Minutes” could use a kick in the rear, according to two people familiar with the newsroom. This contingent would like to see “60 Minutes” gain back some of the swashbuckling mien it displayed when Mike Wallace led tough-nosed investigative segments, and the program wasn’t weakened by a corporate decision in 1995 to spike a whistleblower’s report on the tobacco company Brown & Williamson’s efforts to hide the health risks of cigarettes.\n\n\tWeiss’ moves this week do nothing to help “60 Minutes,” and more to hurt it. Her decision is the latest in a series of bull-in-a-China-shop maneuvers that have alienated staff and raised more questions than answers about where she wants to lead CBS News. \n\n\tWeiss has attracted unwanted attention from the outset, mainly because she has no experience running a large media asset and her skill set is tied to the formulation of commentary around the news, rather than the gathering of facts that typically sits at the center of the process. Since her arrival, she has brought pushback from the union representing CBS News staffers after asking them to lay out their job duties; nabbed conservative newsmakers and Trump administration officials for various segments for broadcast and online programming; tried to hire big-name anchors by enticing them to leave their current contracts at rival operations; and launched a new series of town halls and debates by moderating a session with conservative activist Erika Kirk that lacked support from mainstream advertisers. Bank of America has signed on as a sponsor for future editions of the series, now dubbed “Things That Matter.”\n\n\tWeiss has good reason to seek a shake-up at CBS News. The news division’s morning and evening programs have long run in third place behind rivals at ABC and NBC. CBS is overhauling “CBS Evening News” for example — yet again — after the most recent two-anchor format caused thousands of viewers to ditch the show. Tony Dokoupil launches his tenure on the program in early January.\n\n\tTwo people familiar with her recent work say Weiss is tireless and may even have ambitions beyond the news division. Still, she has yet to forge a clear alliance with the people for whom she is responsible. She has yet to demonstrate a real feel for the job she has at hand. And with statements such as “We live in a time in which many people have lost trust in the media” — made while announcing Dokoupil’s hire — she may have to work a lot harder to accomplish those goals. Meanwhile, her lengthening series of missteps cast fog around Paramount management’s ability to run media properties with any degree of success.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you have a tendency to leave shopping to the very last second, you’re certainly not alone. While there’s still ample time to procure the perfect gift, if you do procrastinate this year, you’ve still got plenty of options that you can order and send instantly online — but will actually look like you didn’t wait until the day before the special day to think about.\n\n\tWhether you’re strapped for time or prefer to shop from the comfort of home, here are the best last-minute gifts to shop this year — just in time for Christmas.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLyceum Theatre\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBroadway Tickets\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tHonor your favorite theater adult with tickets to one of the many hot shows that are currently open. From new favorites like the Keanu Reeves-led revival of “Waiting for Godot” to Kristin Chenoweth’s “The Queen of Versailles,” there are dozens of Broadway shows to gift this year. Check out the full list of Broadway tickets that are available right now, and check out more Broadway merch to personalize your gift.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCozymeal Culinary Class\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tFor the foodie in your life who’s tasted every trendy restaurant but still wants more, give the gift of hands-on culinary magic. With Cozymeal, recipients can redeem a single gift card for immersive cooking classes — from handmade pasta and sushi rolling to regional comfort classics — or even book a private chef to come to their home and craft a multi-course feast. Classes are taught by vetted local chefs in cities nationwide or live online, so whether it’s a cozy date night at the stove or a group session with friends, it’s an experience that turns a meal into a memory. Best part? Cozymeal gift cards never expire and can be used for food tours, mixology classes, cookware and more.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPeacock Gift Subscription\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tWe’ve gotten to the point where it takes an army to catch up on your favorite shows. Between Hulu and HBO and Showtime, there are now dozens of streamers competing for our attention and the monthly bills can add up, making a streaming subscription the perfect gift. Peacock has something for every kind of person, from “Real Housewives” and “Love Island” for the reality show heads to “Harry Potter” and “The Office” for the comfort show bingers.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tT-Mobile Deals\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tA mobile network isn’t the first thing to come to mind when it comes to gifting but T-Mobile has unveiled several holiday promos to position itself as a thoughtful last-minute gift, especially for a family member. Not only do they have unbeatable deals on new releases such as the iPhone 17 and Samsung Galaxy but their new 15-minute switch campaign touts their easier-than-ever process for switching mobile plans virtually — just in time for the new year.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTrade Coffee\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCoffee Subscription\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tCoffee subscriptions are a promised success for people who enjoy the process of brewing their own coffee and finding new, unique blends. There’s a wide range of services to choose from depending on someone’s preferences: if you already know your dad’s go-to coffee shops, you can play it safe with brand-specific subscriptions like Blue Bottle and Verve, or you can go with services like Trade Coffee or Misto Box for those who like to be more adventurous with their beans. Here, check out our roundup of the best coffee subscription services of 2025.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHeadspace\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGive the gift of meditation this year with a subscription to Headspace, currently offering a free trial.

Audible’s Plus membership allows for unlimited access to all of their Audible Original titles, one premium title of their choice per month and exclusive discounts on high-demand content. Plus, memberships are currently only $.99/month for the first three months, a 93% discount off its typical $14.95 monthly fee. \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tClasspass Giftcard\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tHelp the gym junkie in your life get out of the comfort zone with a Classpass giftcard, which will let them choose from a variety of boutique studios and workout classes in their area that they might not have been able to try about before, from rock climbing and pilates to yoga and hit classes. Check out more fitness gifts here. \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEtsy Giftcard\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tCrafters can be hard to shop for since they love something homemade. And if you aren’t a crafty ceramicist or knitter yourself, you can feel out of luck. But thankfully, you can reap the benefits of Etsy’s community of artists. A gift card is a an effortless way to find something they’ll really adore while giving a thoughtful nod to their interests and hobbies.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBest of Goldbelly Monthly Subscription\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tFoodies, rejoice. Goldbelly is one of the best gifts for those constantly on the lookout for the next culinary sensation to rave about. This 3-month subscription features a delivery of one of the country’s most sought-after, handcrafted foods every single month — from pit masters and pie makers to butchers and bakers. \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tButcherBox Subscription\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tIs the grill master in your household already looking forward to the summer to show off their meat-cooking skills? Give them the gift of 100% grass-fed beef, free-range organic chicken, humanely raised pork, and wild-caught seafood! Send them over to the Butcher Box’s favorite box (around $135) or set him up with a monthly subscription for choice cuts all year long. Shipping is free and they will deliver to your door on your schedule, so don’t worry about anything sitting out for too long. Plus, you can cancel at any time.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWinc Wine Subscription\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tThere are a number of food and beverage delivery options these days, but we like Winc — a California-based winery that offers a more personalized experience when it comes to wine. While other subscription services pre-select wines and ship them to you monthly, Winc lets you choose your own wines, based on your palate, price point and occasion(s). Many of their wines are featured at some of the best restaurants across the country, and they’re all carefully chosen by the site’s in-house sommeliers (see their current roster of wines here). Never pay for a bottle you don’t like, and you can skip a delivery any time you want. Bottles start at just $13. If you prefer not to sign up for a subscription, individual gift boxes are available to ship as well.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSpa Finder Giftcard\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tWant to book a loved one into a spa or retreat, but need to be flexible with dates? Pick up a gift card from SpaFinder. The gift cards work at thousands of wellness studios across the country, with options for salons, spas, fitness classes, acupuncture, Botox, meditation retreats and more (see all participating partners here). Best of all: the cards never expire. Order a gift card and have it emailed to your recipient for immediate delivery, or package it in a free gift box and have the site send it by mail.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of ESPN\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESPN+\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tFor a sports fan, you can’t go wrong with a subscription to ESPN+, the sports broadcaster’s direct-to-consumer streaming service. Plus, this Disney-Hulu-ESPN bundle is down to only $29.99/month for 12 months, giving you unlimited access to all three streamers for the price of one. ESPN+ subscribers get access to hundreds of live games including the UFC, MLB, MLS, the NHL, Grand Slam Tennis, international soccer, Top Rank Boxing and more.  The service also includes on-demand access to exclusive ESPN originals, like their award-winning “30 for 30” series, “E:60” and “OJ: Made in America.”\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMasterclass Subscription\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tIf mom is looking to update their skill-set, gift them an all-access pass to MasterClass, which features dozens of courses spanning film, food, writing and more, all taught by celebrity instructors. Chef it up with Gordon Ramsay; learn photography from Annie Lebowitz; or take a filmmaking class with the likes of Spike Lee. MasterClass charges $90 for individual courses, but your best value is their $180 annual membership, which provides unlimited access to all 90+ courses taught by some of the best — and most famous — experts in almost every industry you can think of. \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Bouqs Co. Flower Delivery\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tChoose between bouquets of lush white roses, rose-pink arrangements and eclectic picnic flower assortments on Bouqs Co., known for their farm-direct transparent sourcing. Whichever flowers you choose from the site, you can be sure that the farmers used sustainable growing practices by minimizing waste and recycling water. In addition to classic bouquets, the site also offers a wide range of beautiful dried flowers like Terracotta and Folklore for a unique decor gift that lasts even longer.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon Prime Subscription\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tAmazon Prime has the best value of any online membership. One year costs $119 (that’s almost $50 less than Netflix), and gets you free shipping on just about anything to your doorstep in less than two days, a ton of original content through Amazon Studios, and unlimited access to Amazon Music. You also get access to unlimited books and magazines and can enjoy Twitch for video game lovers, plus more. If someone you know doesn’t have Prime, this is the time to get them a gift membership. It’s one gift that will keep on giving through the year.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n",

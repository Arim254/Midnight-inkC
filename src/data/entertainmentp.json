    "body": "\n\tApple TV is reteaming with “Carême” director Martin Bourboulon on a new French-language thriller, “La Décision,” starring Raphaël Personnaz (“The Richest Woman in the World”), Diane Kruger (“Inglourious Basterds”) and Louis Farge (“Culte”). \n\n\tThe seven-episode series also stars César Award winners Sami Bouajila (“Ganglands”), Marina Hands (“Lady Chatterley”) and Fanny Sidney (“Call My Agent!”). \n\n\n\tPersonnaz plays a French President whose life is turned upside down when an eight-year-old girl goes missing. “While the public is shocked over the disappearance of the young girl, the tragedy affects the President personally as she is his illegitimate daughter, born of a secret affair unknown to his wife and confidante Nora (Kruger). When the kidnapping becomes a matter of state, the entire Elysée apparatus intervenes to find the little girl. Torn between his private life and public responsibilities, the President is now plunged into a whirlwind of false friendships, unrequited love, power struggles, political games and espionage,” reads the synopsis. \n\t\n\n\tProduced for Apple TV by Solab Films, White Lion Films, a Mediawan company, and M Films, “La Décision” is executive produced by Nicolas Tiry (“Atlantic Bar”), Noor Sadar (“Malditos”) and Martin Bourboulon.  \n\n\tThe series is based on an original idea by Bourboulon and Tiry. It’s created by Marc Dugain and Corinne Garfin (“Coeurs Noirs”), Lamara Leprêtre Habib (“Dans l’Ombre”) and Xabi Molia (“Les Sentinelles”).\n\n\t“La Decision” is the latest in French programming from Apple TV, which also includes the upcoming thriller “The Hunt,” starring Benoît Magimel and Mélanie Laurent, and set for a Dec. 3 premiere; as well as the French-Japanese drama “Drops of God;” and “Carême,” following the thrilling story of the world’s first celebrity chef, Antonin Carême, starring Benjamin Voisin. \n",

    "body": "\n\tFox Corp.‘s Red Seat Ventures signed a deal with entrepreneur and media personality Jillian Michaels making the creator-focused digital media company the new production partner for her podcast “Keeping It Real.”\n\n\tFox Corp. this February bought Red Seat Ventures, a production company that specializes in managing content businesses for media figures including Tucker Carlson, Piers Morgan, Megan Kelly, Dr. Phil and Bill O’Reilly (some of whom are former Fox News stars). Earlier this year Fox News tapped conservative influencer Brett Cooper, who is backed in part by Red Seat Ventures, as an on-air contributor.\n\t\n\n\t“Red Seat has built a reputation for producing powerful, thought-provoking content with some of the most dynamic voices in media,” Michaels said in a statement. “I’m genuinely honored to join the Red Seat family and bring ‘Keeping It Real’ to a platform that values substance, honesty and meaningful conversation.”\n\n\n\t“Keeping It Real: Conversations With Jillian Michaels” was previously produced by Crossover Media Group. On the podcast, Michaels discusses topics centered around health and wellness with different guests, and the conversations span mental health, science, current events, relationships and work life. She brings “valuable insights, inspiring life stories and actionable advice from leading thinkers, innovators and changemakers,” according to Red Seat. The podcast is available on Spotify, Apple Podcasts and Amazon’s Wondery.\n\n\t“We are proud to partner with Jillian and to be the new home of her celebrated podcast as she continues to tackle timely and complex topics while empowering and inspiring her listeners,” said Christopher Balfe, CEO of Red Seat Ventures. “Not only is she a renowned health and wellness expert but she’s also a motivator and an activist, and we’re honored to welcome her to our growing family of bold voices and entrepreneurial talent.”\n\t\n\n\tAmong her business ventures, Michaels is the creator of the Fitness App, a winning diet and exercise app for women, and she launched Balance, a line of of fitness products. Her fitness DVDs remain the home workouts in history, according to Red Seat. She’s appeared in multiple TV shows and is a regular contributor to outlets including Fox News, E! News, News Nation and Daily Mail. Michaels also is a best-selling author and public speaker.\n\n\tHer TV gigs have included serving as a fitness trainer on NBC’s “The Biggest Loser” weight-loss competition series from 2004-11. Michaels recently disputed allegations made about her by “Biggest Loser” alumni in Netflix documentary “Fit for TV.”\n\n\tIn 2008, Michaels launched her company Empowered Media with business partner Giancarlo Chersich. Empowered Media is dedicated to “total-life solutions” comprising all aspects of living well, including nutrition, fitness, self-help and overall lifestyle.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPlayboy and Hefner Capital are partnering on “Dead After Dark,” a Cold War-era horror-thriller set inside the iconic Playboy Club in Miami.\n\n\tThe film will be produced by Cooper Hefner, managing partner of Hefner Capital and former chief creative officer and chief of global partnerships at Playboy Enterprises. Hefner is the son of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. Additional production and creative partners will be announced at a later date. \n\t\n\n\tWhile no cast has been announced, a source close to the production says that actors who top the wishlist for roles include Scarlett Hefner (“The Vampire Diaries”), as well as Lukas Gage and Patrick Schwarzenegger of “White Lotus” fame. As the feature is in early development, things could shift.\n\n\n\t“This creative partnership reflects Playboy’s commitment to introduce and build out our story-driven content strategy,” said Ben Kohn, CEO of Playboy. “’Dead After Dark’ is another step in a broader company effort to develop a connected Playboy entertainment universe, one that draws from the brand’s vast archives, global influence, and consumer appetite for new IP. We’re excited to see how this first film resonates with audiences and to continue collaborating with great partners to develop additional stories across film, television, and emerging platforms.”\n\n\t“’Dead After Dark’ is a love letter to both classic genre cinema and Playboy’s legacy as a storytelling platform,” said Cooper Hefner. “Our goal is to create something that’s not only entertaining and emotionally resonant, but also true to the imagination and cultural curiosity that have defined Playboy for more than seventy years. We’re excited to deliver something completely original for Playboy fans that still feels unmistakably familiar.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSZA isn’t an artist who regularly gets involved in controversies, but when challenged, she will push back. That was the situation last summer when firebrand rapper Nicki Minaj publicly accused SZA’s manager, TDE’s Terrence “Punch” Henderson, of bullying her. SZA responded obliquely, but then the situation devolved into a back and forth too complicated to summarize quickly.\n\n\tSZA spoke about the exchange in the latest GQ.\n\n\n\t“I don’t know her,” SZA said of Minaj. “We have no connection to each other. There’s no backstory. Like, there was no through line narrative. It was just like, ‘Roc Nation’…. I don’t know where it came from. That’s not even my place to correct a narrative that I don’t got shit to do with. It was a little strange. It was very like, ‘Why?’ But also, you know, ‘I guess.’ ”\n\t\n\n\tThat’s not the only controversy she found herself embroiled in: Over the past year, she’s worked extensively with Kendrick Lamar, who is also managed by Top Dawg Entertainment, and found herself getting collateral flak from Lamar’s ongoing, high-profile feud with Drake (which is even more complicated than the Minaj spat). SZA was quick to say that she’s friends with both artists and called the situation “unfortunate.”\n\n\t“It was something between two grown-ass men, so why would I insert myself between something between two grown-ass men, you know?,” she said. “And I feel like that’s how everybody felt — with the exception of people who didn’t feel that way. I didn’t really have any stake, per se. Obviously, I love Kendrick. I’m signed to TDE. That’s my family. Obviously, I’ve known Drake for so long and we have a beautiful rapport. And, obviously, it’s always unfortunate when the unfortunate occurs.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLegendary soul singer Mavis Staples, age 86, is walking into the front row of the audience at the intimate Soho Sessions, leading a singalong on the chorus of “I’ll Take You There,” the iconic 1972 hit she recorded with her father and siblings, the Staples Singers. “Come on now, now, y’all!” she exhorts. “A little bit louder — take us there! … Don’t you wanna go?!”\n\n\tI’m standing by the bar near the side of the stage when someone walks up next to me to watch. I look — it’s Keith Richards.\n\t\n\n\tHe nods and gestures to the stage and says, “I’ve gotta follow her!” The musicians standing with him smile sympathetically.\n\n\tUnaccustomed to reassuring a Rolling Stone, I say, “I think you’ll be fine, Keith.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNeedless to say, he was. Richards then took the stage and led current Rolling Stones drummer Steve Jordan, guitarist Larry Campbell (last seen accompanying Bruce Springsteen for a recent “Nebraska” set), keyboardist Ivan Neville and NRBQ bassist Joey Spampinato into a loose three-song set featuring the blues classic “Key to the Highway,” an acoustic take on his 1969 Stones showcase “You Got the Silver,” and the Chuck Berry seasonal chestnut “Run Rudolph Run.”\n\n\t“We’re done with Halloween, right?,” Keith laughed to the audience. “Time for Christmas!”\n\n\tMoments like that actually happen at the Soho Sessions, the invite-only concert series that take place in a 175-capacity room in a Downtown New York commercial building that once housed the hip-hop mecca Chung King Studios (where classics by Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys and Public Enemy were recorded). The concerts, organized by producers Greg Williamson and Nicole Rechter, have helped raise more than $50 million for charity and have featured Paul Simon, Steve Earle, Gary Clark Jr., Taj Mahal, Yola, Susan Tedeschi, Brittney Spencer and many more — and on this night, an evening honoring actor-musician Bruce Willis to raise money and awareness for the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD); Willis is afflicated with the disease. Norah Jones and Warren Haynes both performed three or four songs as well, in addition to Richards and Staples.\n\t\n\n\tIn the audience? Demi Moore, Emma Heming Willis, Michael J Fox, Tracy Pollan, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeff Ross, Steve Guttenberg, Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick and many more. AFTD is dedicated to advancing research, awareness, and support for those affected by frontotemporal degeneration (head here for more information and to donate); previous beneficiaries have included Everytown for Gun Safety; Music Will, the largest nonprofit music program in the U.S. public school system; the National Alliance on Mental Illness / Hawaii (after the devastating fire in Lahaina); and others.\n\n\tIn her comments at the beginning of the evening, Heming Willis said of her husband, who was unable to be present, “He would have loved every moment — it would had been his perfect night.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPhoto: Dave Doobinin\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe sets were powerful but relaxed. Jones kicked off the evening, playing guitar instead of her usual piano. She noted this to the crowd and said, “I wrote this next song on guitar when I first moved to New York City and didn’t have room for a piano” — and then broke into a warm version of “Come Away With Me,” the title track from her eight-Grammy-winning 2002 debut. Next up was Staples, who called Jones to the stage to sing with her on “You Are Not Alone,” the title track from her 2010 album. After Richards, Allman Brothers/ Govt. Mule guitarist Warren Haynes closed out the night with a rollicking bluesy set.\n\n\t“There’s something sacred that happens when artists like Keith Richards, Norah Jones, Mavis Staples, and Warren Haynes share a stage this intimate,” said co-producer Williamson. “It’s nights like this that remind us why we built the Soho Sessions in the first place: to witness icons up close and let their energy ripple out into something bigger than music.”\n\n\t “The Soho Sessions have always been about creating moments of connection through music. It’s intimate, unscripted, and deeply human. This evening is especially meaningful because it celebrates a friend whose artistry and spirit have brought people together for decades. It’s a privilege to celebrate Bruce in this way and support the important work being done by AFTD.”  \n\n\tNICOLE:    “Every Soho Sessions is born from love — love for music, for community, and for the causes that move us. Bruce’s courage and legacy remind us why we do what we do: to gather people, to celebrate life, and to use the power of music to make a difference.”  “The talent gathered for this show is extraordinary, with world-class artists sharing the stage in a way that creates a moment you’ll carry with you forever. There’s a kind of shared energy in the room — a closeness between the artists and the audience that brings every song to life in a totally new way.”\n\t\n\n\tLearn more about The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) at www.theaftd.org.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSpanish director Fernando Souza’s dark hybrid feature “Tonight Is Forever” and Serbian filmmaker Stefan Djordjević’s docu-drama “The Leaves Hang Trembling” took home the top honors at the Thessaloniki Film Festival’s industry awards Wednesday night.\n\n\tSet in the world of Tokyo’s red-light district, Souza’s feature debut won the 119 Marvila Studios Award, the top prize in the Agora’s Works in Progress section, offering sound mixing services in post-production. The Crossroads Co-Production Forum, meanwhile, gave its top honors — the Two Thirty-Five Co-Production Award, offering full post-production image and sound to a film that’s currently in development — to Djordjević for the follow-up to his 2025 Rotterdam-premiering debut “Wind, Talk to Me.”\n\t\n\n\t“Tonight Is Forever,” which follows an employee at a Japanese “host club” who must confront his inner demons when his fantasy life begins to crumble, was praised by the jury for its “subtle atmosphere” and “strong cinematic language,” with the jury noting: “We felt connected with the emotional layers of this character in his pursuit of love. We were caught by the silence echoing loneliness.”\n\n\n\tThe top prize in the Crossroads Co-Production Forum went to “The Leaves Hang Trembling,” which follows a teacher who is unjustly fired before her class’s graduation day, only to have her students rally on her behalf. The jury praised the film “for its unique approach to a deeply personal story that resonates with urgent global relevance,” adding: “Courageous, fierce, yet deeply empathetic, the film is profoundly moving as it puts children and students at its heart.”\n\t\n\n\tThe winner of the Onassis Film Award, which offers a cash prize of €10,000 ($11,500) to a Greek project participating in the Agora’s Crossroads Co-production Forum, went to the crime fantasy “The Tide Hears Them but They No Longer Have a Voice,” from director Yiannis Veslemes. Citing the winning project’s “boldness and authenticity,” the jury praised a film that “addresses one of the darkest political periods in Greece in order to speak about timeless themes and universal questions surrounding death and immortality.”\n\n\tOther winners included “Promised Spaces,” an experimental feature by Serbian director Ivan Marković set against Cambodia’s rapidly expanding cityscapes, which won the Authorwave Post-Production Award offering image services in post-production to a project in the Agora Works in Progress section. In the Crossroads Co-production Forum, Spanish filmmaker Víctor Diago won an €8,000 ($9,200) award for script development from France’s CNC for his elevated horror film “The Unmoving Hands.” The ArteKino International Award, with a cash prize of €6,000 ($6,900), went to Romanian filmmaker Andreea Cristina Borțun for her social dramedy “The Life and Times of Ion G.,” whose producer, Gabi Suciu, also won the EAVE Thessaloniki Award, offering a EAVE Marketing Workshop scholarship to a producer in the Agora.\n\n\tThessaloniki industry head Angeliki Vergou applauded the participants in this year’s industry event, praising their “smart, courageous, political, funny, emotional” films, while festival director Orestis Andreadakis honored cinema as “an act of courage against silence,” adding: “In times when voices are censored and truths are contested, storytelling becomes a form of resistance.”\n\n\tFestival general director Elise Jalladeau, meanwhile, took a moment to acknowledge the perils of a world “which is at best in crisis — political, economic, environmental — and at worst engulfed in bloodbaths and massacres we call war,” noting that “culture is not spared from the crisis.” \n\n\t“We are witnessing reductions and severe cuts in cultural budgets all over Europe, and it is feared this trend will continue,” she said. “Fragility﻿ is one of the themes of this year’s festival, and we are more than aware of it here. But this fragility is not fate, and we believe in the power of collaborations and co-productions to invent together new ways of making cinema.” \n\t\n\n\tHere’s the complete list of winners of the Thessaloniki Film Festival’s Agora awards:  \n\n\tAgora Works in Progress Awards  \n\n\t119 Marvila Studios Award: “Tonight Is Forever,” Fernando Souza\n\n\tAuthorwave Post-Production Award: “Promised Spaces,” Ivan Marković\n\n\tERT Agora Works in Progress Award: “Ways to Get Rid of Some Freedom,” Chrisanthos Margonis\n\n\tCrossroads Co-Production Forum Awards  \n\n\tTwo Thirty-Five Award: “The Leaves Hang Trembling,” Stefan Djordjević\n\n\tCNC Award: “The Unmoving Hands,” Victor Diago  \n\n\tArteKino International Award: “The Life and Times of Ion G.,” Andreea Cristina Borțun\n\n\tFinos Film Award: “Pirateland,” Stavros Petropoulos\n\n\tProducers’ Network – Marché du Film Award: Fahriye Ismayilova, “Goodbye For Now”\n\n\tMidpoint Consulting Award: “The Dictator’s Dream,” Erenik Beqiri  \n\n\tIndependent Awards\n\n\tOnassis Film Award: “The Tide Hears Them but They No Longer Have a Voice,” Yiannis Veslemes\n\n\tGreener Screen Award: “A Girl Named Zeus,” Nikos Dayandas\n\n\tSofia Meetings Award: “Robbing Beirut,” Katia Jarjoura\n\n\tMediterranean Film Institute Award: “La Forma Animal,” Isa Luengo and Sofia Esteve\n\n\tThessaloniki EAVE Marketing Workshop Scholarship: Gabi Suciu, “The Life and Times of Ion G.”  \n\n\tAgora Series Talents Award\n\n\tCrew United Prize: Katerina Papanastasiou \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe world of Wordle is expanding: The New York Times Games is launching a “Create Your Wordle Puzzle” feature that will allow users to go beyond just playing the popular word game, and instead develop their own one-word challenges.\n\n\tDebuting Thursday, Create Your Wordle Puzzle will let All Access and Games subscribers “turn inside jokes, special moments, or personal messages” into a 4-7 letter solution with a “created by” label and an optional clue, all done via the New York Times Games app on iOS and Android, as well as mobile web and desktop.\n\t\n\n\tHowever, not every word can be Wordled.\n\n\n\tPer the New York Times Games’ acceptable use policy for Create Your Wordle Puzzle, users are prohibited from including the following in their customized puzzles: name-calling, personal attacks, slurs, harassment, threats, hate speech, bullying, abuse, malicious acts, descriptions of violence or gore, and discrimination, as well as profanity (including expletives and letters followed by dashes that could translate to an expletive) and content that is sexual, salacious, obscene, or predatory, including grooming behaviors.\n\n\tThe new Wordle offering comes at a time of continuous growth for the NYT Games division. In Q3, helped by its exclusive games lineup, the New York Times added 460,000 net digital-only subscribers, bringing the total to 12.33 million.\n\n\t“The Games team has wanted to do this for some time,” The New York Times Games chief Jonathan Knight told Variety. “We also talk to our users regularly, and take their temperature on what they’d like to see from us. And now that Wordle has a collection of great features surrounding it, like the Wordle Archive of over 1500 puzzles, plus WordleBot’s post-game analysis, we knew the time was right to deliver Create Your Wordle Puzzle.”\n\t\n\n\tOnce a Create Your Wordle Puzzle is crafted, the creator will receive a unique URL that will let them share the custom puzzle with others. Notably, this feature allows non-subscribers to play puzzles created by subscribers.\n\n\t“We think there’s a lot of value in the creation part of the experience, and understand that our most dedicated fans are the most likely to be the Create Your Wordle Puzzle makers,” Knight said. “But we also want as many people as possible within those fans’ networks (big or small) to enjoy the solving side of that same experience. This will make it the most satisfying for everyone.”\n\n\tAt this time, Knight says the NYT Games team is “not looking” at creating custom versions of its other products — which include the Crossword, Connections, Spelling Bee, Pips and more games — and is instead focused on the Create Your Wordle launch. “It’s just the beginning, and we’re excited to learn and to see what people create!” Knight said.\n\n\tTo coincide with the launch of Create Your Wordle Puzzle, The New York Times curated the below list of custom puzzles from nine prominent NYT staffers across the newsroom and verticals including Audio, Cooking, Games, Wirecutter and The Athletic:\n\n\tMelissa Clark, food columnist for New York Times Cooking.\n\n\tPlay Clark’s Wordle puzzle here.\n\n\tClue: “Good to know how to make in a pan.”\n\n\tAnna Martin, host of the “Modern Love” podcast.\n\n\tPlay Martin’s Wordle puzzle here.\n\n\tClue: “A scary way to stop seeing someone.”\n\n\tBen Frumin, editor-in-chief of Wirecutter.\n\n\tPlay Frumin’s Wordle puzzle here.\n\n\tClue: “Next season we’re winning it all!!”\n\n\tDianna Russini, senior NFL insider for The Athletic.\n\n\tPlay Russini’s Wordle puzzle here.\n\n\tClue: “What I do while chasing news (and my kids).”\n\n\tMarc Lacey, managing editor of The New York Times.\n\n\tPlay Lacey’s Wordle puzzle here.\n\n\tClue: “Bring a camera and wide-brimmed hat.”\n\n\tDavid Marchese, journalist and co-host of “The Interview” podcast.\n\n\tPlay Marchese’s Wordle puzzle here.\n\n\tClue: “It’s what I’m often doing at work.”\n\n\tVaughn Vreeland, writer and host of “Bake Time” for New York Times Cooking.\n\n\tPlay Vreeland’s Wordle puzzle here.\n\n\tClue: “A type of kitchen tool that’s handy for baking.”\n\t\n\n\tJacqueline Yue, product director of New York Times Games.\n\n\tPlay Yue’s Wordle puzzle here.\n\n\tClue: “🧖🫧”\n\n\tDavid Ornstein, football correspondent for The Athletic.\n\n\tPlay Ornstein’s Wordle puzzle here.\n\n\tClue: “The element for which I have become most renowned.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMarissa Irvine, the protagonist of the Peacock thriller “All Her Fault,” bears a superficial resemblance to Siobhan Roy. For one thing, both characters are played by Sarah Snook, the Australian actor who broke out as the ambitious, oblivious heiress on “Succession.” Both women are wealthy, although Marissa — a wealth manager based in Chicago — is self-made. Both favor a quietly luxurious wardrobe heavy on tasteful neutrals and cocoon-like outerwear.\n\t\n\n\tBut the similarities end there. Marissa is defined by her motherhood, a phase of life Shiv was only beginning to contemplate at the end of “Succession.” The series, adapted by creator Megan Gallagher from the 2021 novel by Andrea Mara, begins when Marissa tries to pick up her 5-year-old son Milo (Duke McCloud) from a playdate, only to realize he isn’t there. What follows is a kidnapping drama that’s every parent’s worst nightmare — although for a performer like Snook, who executive produces her first series- leading turn after the HBO hit wound down two and a half years ago, it’s a custom-built showcase. “All Her Fault” (not to be confused with “All’s Fair,” the other female-focused hour with “All” in the name to debut this week) does allow Snook to emote with all her might, sobbing with panic and gasping in horror as Marissa’s quest to find Milo takes its inevitable twists and turns. Yet the laboriously paced, clunkily plotted series can’t hold a candle to Snook’s most famous role, and seems unlikely to replace it as her signature.\n\n\n\t“All Her Fault” is another entry in the “Big Little Lies” school of mysteries centered on wealthy women that mix conspicuous consumption with attempted social commentary. When Marissa runs through her house, frantically searching for Milo, the scene doubles as a tour of the Irvines’ palatial lakefront home as captured by directors Minkie Spiro and Kate Dennis. (“All Her Fault” was filmed in Australia; the ample outdoor space is a dead giveaway it wasn’t actually made in a place with Midwestern winters.) Jake Lacy, who plays Marissa’s husband Peter, also starred as a finance bro in “Apples Never Fall,” another Peacock production based on a novel by “Big Little Lies” author Liane Moriarty. Rich families, buried secrets, the gender dynamics of heterosexual marriage: Gang’s all here!\n\t\n\n\t“Big Little Lies” sets a sky-high bar, of course. But even “Apples Never Fall” had a breeziness that’s sorely lacking in “All Her Fault,” which doesn’t land any incisive points about parenting, class, codependency or hired child care but does get bogged down trying to make them. With the help of the lead detective assigned to their case (Michael Peña), the Irvines quickly deduce that Milo was likely abducted by Carrie Finch (Sophia Lillis), the 21-year-old nanny of Marissa’s new friend Jenny (Dakota Fanning), a publishing executive. Carrie, a pseudonym, makes no ransom demands, forcing the Irvines to search for her motive by scrutinizing the people around them: Jake’s siblings Lia (Abby Elliott), a hotheaded free spirit, and Brian (Daniel Monks), who was disabled in a childhood accident; Marissa’s best friend and business partner Colin (Jay Ellis); Jenny, visibly wracked with guilt; and even their own nanny Ana (Kartiah Vergara), who’s out of town when Milo goes missing and mysteriously left her phone behind.\n\n\tThe anxiety of inviting another person into your intimate family life, especially a less fortunate one who might covet some of your hard-won comfort, has driven previous thrillers like “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle” (and its recent straight-to-Hulu remake). There’s no reason “All Her Fault” couldn’t update this repressed paranoia for the having-it-all age, and for a few episodes, it tries to. The title refers to the blame placed on working women tacitly assigned responsibility for their kids as well as their jobs, an assumption that becomes explicit in a time of crisis. Peter faults Marissa for failing to check that the phone number used to propose the playdate matched Jenny’s listed one in their school’s parent handbook; Jenny’s husband Richie (Thomas Cocquerel), faults her for not double-checking Carrie’s references. \n\n\tIt goes without saying that these couples’ employees don’t get such an in-depth exploration of their own plight — Carrie because she has to remain an enigma until the end, Ana because the show simply isn’t that interested in what makes her tick. Fair enough, but as “All Her Fault” delves deeper into the two primary marriages, both Peter and Richie come off as cartoonishly awful. The former is a control freak whose obsessiveness extends to the people he loves; the latter is a man-child who demands “me time” at the expense of Jenny’s professional obligations. The asymmetry between them and their well-meaning wives is so extreme it saps the takedowns of any satisfying bite. The proper counterpoint to “All Her Fault” is not that, really, it’s just all his fault.\n\t\n\n\tThe silliness of this analysis could at least be matched by a silliness in tone. But the middle stretch of “All Her Fault” is slow and somber, especially a detour into the Peña character’s home life as he works the case. And when the reveals finally arrive, in rapid succession and with little room to breathe, they’re often out of left field. This is especially true when it comes to the central question of why Carrie has taken Milo, which hinges on a vital piece of backstory that’s been withheld for so long it feels both deceptive and random. \n\n\tWhat “All Her Fault” makes room for by crowding such pivotal elements to its periphery is many, many scenes of Marissa in acute distress. Snook shines moment to moment; of course she does — she filmed the show in between the West End and Broadway productions of “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” in which she commanded entire theaters alone on a stage and picked up both an Olivier and a Tony. But in the aggregate, Marissa is a bit fuzzy. I ended the series knowing little about her besides her devotion to her son, because I’d mostly watched her endure the worst moments of her life at the hands of other people. It’s not fair to say a woman’s problems are all her fault, but at least that sentiment affords her some agency.\n\n\tAll eight episodes of “All Her Fault” are now streaming on Peacock.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn the fall of 1987, Ronald Reagan was president, Bon Jovi was the breakthrough band of the year, and mullets were still worn without irony by people who were not country musicians. Into that world dropped an orange-vinyl EP called “Screaming Life” by a band named Soundgarden — from Seattle, of all places — that combined the then-disparate sounds of punk and hard rock in a way that no one had really done before. In many ways, that EP represented the birth of grunge. \n\t\n\n\tIt would be drastically reductive to say “the rest is history,” but this week, Soundgarden will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \n\n\tAnd after nearly 40 years of articles and books and documentaries and deluxe reissues and whatnot about the band and the scene, there is one key person whose story hasn’t really been told: Susan Silver, who managed Soundgarden and Alice in Chains and Screaming Trees during their peak years of success and helped guide all three to the upper echelons of the music world.\n\n\n\tWhile Soundgarden’s rise was not as meteoric as Nirvana’s or their longtime friends Pearl Jam’s, that’s partially because they were, in many ways, the first ones from the scene over the wire: They were the first act to make a splash in New York, with a sweaty, smokey and jam-packed July 1988 show at CBGB; they were the first to sign with a major label; the first to make a big-budget video; and the first to undertake a major North American tour. They also may have been the first to score a gold record — but incredibly, Pearl Jam’s “10,” Nirvana’s “Nevermind” and Soundgarden’s “Badmotorfinger” were released in August, September and October of 1991 respectively, so whichever album first passed the 500,000-sales mark is all but impossible to call.\n\t\n\n\tIt is no overstatement to say that the careers of Soundgarden, Alice and many other bands of the era would not have been what they were without Silver. She was not only one of the most important music managers of that era, but she is also one of the most important female managers in music history. This writer has known Silver since late 1987 and even then she showed a poise, professionalism and politeness that was rare, to say the least, for that brawny and undomesticated sector of the indie-rock scene.\n\n\tMore importantly, Soundgarden themselves showed a level of discipline, focus and ambition beyond that of many peers, and their rise was intentionally measured and gradual: They released their first records on the then-small Seattle indie Sub Pop, then an album on legendary indie powerhouse SST, before releasing their major debut, “Louder Than Love,” on A&M in 1989. Over the next five years, Soundgarden, fronted by singer Chris Cornell, Silver’s partner and later husband, became one of the biggest bands in the world. Alice in Chains, whom Silver also managed (and still does), were just a couple of years behind them and became just as big.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Jem Aswad\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Susan came on board in ‘86 or ‘87, and for those next 10 years, she was very important,” Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil tells Variety. “We had a pretty good knowledge of the music industry, but we didn’t have the time or certainly the managerial skills to navigate that kind of world — we were probably a little more clumsy and blunt,” he laughs. “You need someone who has that kind of skill, that kind of tact. Susan played it serious, and she played it smart; we read that in her and we trusted it. And we grew together — it could have been very problematic if we’d had a more experienced manager, because we knew who we were and how we wanted to address the music community and industry, and a more experienced manager might have tried to tell us what to do and how we should do it, and we would have butted heads and wouldn’t have worked.” \n\n\tA proud Seattle native, Silver had a hand in nearly every major landmark from the scene of the era: Cameron Crowe’s era-defining “Singles” film and blockbuster soundtrack album, early Lollapalooza tours, her bands touring with everyone from Guns N’ Roses to Van Halen before becoming arena-level headliners themselves. She even helped out a nascent Nirvana early in their career. \n\t\n\n\t“From the first moment you meet her, you know Susan understands music and the creative fire of musicians like few others ever will,” Cameron Crowe tells Variety. “Her passion runs deep, as well as her guidance in what makes a great song or a great band truly timeless. Authenticity: That is Susan Silver.”\n\n\tSoundgarden and Alice were among the biggest bands of their generation — both have sold an estimated 30 million-plus albums worldwide — but as has been well documented, there was a tragic side as well: Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley died of a heroin overdose (in 2002 at the age of just 34) and Cornell passed away in 2017. Yet their legacy is formidable.\n\n\t“Meeting Susan and the band as a very young lawyer and having the honor of representing them changed my life forever,” says Universal Music Group EVP and former Soundgarden attorney Michele Anthony. “Susan was and still is the den mother of what was one of the most flourishing and important music communities of our generation. She embraced me into that pioneering community of musicians, just as it was on the verge of changing music and culture forever. Soundgarden, with Susan as their manager, helped define that change. That was also the beginning of our lifetime friendship.” \n\n\tWhile always a fierce advocate for her artists, Silver has never been one to call attention to herself, and this interview literally was years in the making. Part of that is due to modesty on her part, but it’s also due to her tough divorce from Cornell. Yet if there was ever a time to tell her story, it’s now, as the band that she helped guide to superstardom is finally getting its moment, and she has the opportunity to share the wisdom from the challenges she overcame and the triumphs she witnessed as a woman — at a time when sexism was at a peak — in a still-male-dominated business. That wisdom is top of mind: She still manages Alice in Chains, who tour and record regularly, and Lily, her daughter with Cornell, is currently managing a band herself, the Seattle-based Americana outfit the Brudi Brothers.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed from a two-hour conversation late last month.\n\n\tDid anything in your background prepare you for this career? What did your parents do for a living?\n\t\n\n\tMy mother worked at Boeing during the [World War II] war effort in her early twenties — that was long before I came along — and then she worked some retail jobs as we as we got older. And my dad was the fourth pilot hired for Alaska Airlines, which gave us the opportunity to see all different parts of the world and instilled the travel bug in me.\n\n\tBut I also had two little brothers. They’re just two and four years younger than me, but they have very different personalities, and one in particular seemed to raise the ire of our father quite regularly. So I really honed some mediation skills, and I also mediated between my parents. \n\n\tI do think those were fundamental experiences that helped me learn the importance of gaining trust from whoever it was that was looking to me for support or advice, the importance of being a good listener, providing critical feedback — and trying to make peace in non-peaceful times. In a family dynamic, of course, that had to be done in a compassionate way. By nature I’m pretty empathetic and observant, and that’s helped a lot.\n\n\tDid you have a musical background?\n\n\tI played piano and clarinet when I was growing up, but no, I didn’t have that gene. \n\n\tWhat did you initially want to do for a career? \n\n\tWhen I was around 16 I was working at an art-supply store and had started volunteering in arts organizations, and I was able to see that creative people often aren’t particularly organized. So I had what I thought was an original idea: that I could represent painters. Little did I know that had been going on for millennia, but it definitely jump-started the idea that I could be a useful force in creative people’s lives.\n\n\tAs I continued to volunteer for arts organizations in Seattle, everything from the opera to a science-fiction fair to Bumbershoot [music festival] in its early days, the calling became clearer and clearer — that creative people could benefit from having some modicum of organization and strategy and goals around them.\n\n\tThen everything unfolded in unexpected ways. I desperately tried to get a job at a nonprofit, and no matter how many times I nailed the interview and pressed the director with ideas, they just kept putting the carrot further and further out, and then eventually hired a family member — so I learned about that early on too. But as I try to [communicate] to the young people in my life, those disappointments are usually a detour to something better.\n\t\n\n\tAnd it certainly was: When I was in my early twenties, lo and behold, along came a band that needed a manager. My background was in the art world, but a band is still a group of creative people. They were a pop band called the First Thought, and soon that turned into helping out two bands — [proto-grunge outfit] the U-Men came along a couple of months later. So I was working out of the stock room of John Fluevog shoes, managing a couple of bands and helping people fit their shoes in between. I hope John doesn’t ever read that!\n\n\tThe First Thought made a record and did a tour down the West Coast, but the U-Men already had some history in Seattle, they had a record out on [influential indie label] Homestead, and the friend that was managing them got a full-time job and couldn’t keep doing it. So I took over and booked my first couple of national tours using phone books from the library.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSilver with Soundgarden (L-R: Matt Cameron, Kim Thayil, Hiro Yamamoto and Chris Cornell) and, top right, tour manager Eric “Gunny” Johnson, 1988 (Courtesy Susan Silver)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDid you have any business background?\n\n\tI’d taken some business courses in college and was still volunteering in the arts, but before I started managing those bands, I helped some people who opened an all-ages club called Metropolis that ended up being a very pivotal place in the genesis of the Seattle music scene. It was the most diverse array of artists imaginable: In one week you’d have Jah Wobble, John Cale, the Violent Femmes and GBH, and the [local] musicians who played there went on to be in Soundgarden and Pearl Jam and Mudhoney.\n\n\tThe club had two partners, and like my brothers, they were very different personalities, so I got to hone those mediating skills further, and I learned about booking and promoting. It was a really, really important part of my past. \n\n\tI started promoting shows, and a year or two later, in 1985, I was at a life-changing Halloween party where a little power trio played called Soundgarden.\n\n\tEven though I was dressed up in drag that night — I was with my wonderful friend Hal Upchuck, who was quite an extraordinary performer, he had a beloved band called the F*gs and could dress like nobody else, and he dressed me up as him that night. So even though I looked like [Twisted Sister singer] Dee Snider, with a fright wig and the whole bit, the drummer of Soundgarden came up to me after they performed and said he recognized me from the vintage clothing store that I was working in at the time — where I did not dress like that, by the way. Little did I know that he had been repeatedly stopping in the store to quote-unquote shop, but later he told me he was really trying to work up the nerve to talk to me. So that’s how Chris and I met — at the time, he was the drummer and singer in Soundgarden. \n\t\n\n\tBy then I’d been promoting shows for some time, and also had started helping another seminal Seattle band called the Blackouts, so I told Chris I could take their band’s cassette to my promoter friends in Portland and Vancouver, where we would cross-promote shows a lot, and that conversation at that party led us to my great honor of managing Soundgarden, and the two of us being together for almost 20 years.\n\n\tWhat happened next? \n\n\tBruce Pavitt, who I knew because he had been a DJ at Metropolis, was starting a project called Sub Pop [which was originally a fanzine that also put out compilation cassettes] and he had a kind of subculture network that he would send music to. Around that time, ’86-’87, Kim Thayil introduced Bruce to Jonathan Poneman, who was a musician but also had a very good business mind, and he thought Sub Pop could become a bona-fide record label. That became the next step for Soundgarden — I remember sitting on the floor at Bruce’s apartment, boxing up records. Sub Pop started to take off, but the band had a different focus: They wanted to be on SST. \n\n\tWhen do you feel like the band started to break out beyond the Northwest?\n\n\tLet me think for a second… I knew about the CMJ Music Marathon conference, and I said “This is the sort of thing you guys should go to,” but not everybody wanted to. So Chris and I went — we found the “best” flight, which meant flying overnight from Seattle to Dallas to Chicago to New Jersey! We rolled in in the morning and went to the convention.\n\n\tNot only was that the first time he was on an airplane, but also his first time in New York, and the first time being in and around the music-business culture. I remember we were leaving the convention one day and waiting for a cab, and there was Ronnie James Dio standing on the sidewalk — it was a little bit like, Wow, these are more than just people in pictures and on records, they’re real!\n\n\tI think that began the reach-out into the world. The tours started shortly thereafter, just in our own cars, driving down the coast. Then once they signed with SST, they started getting better tours and signed with [longtime agent] Don Mueller, although it was still a good couple of years before they were playing on big stages.\n\n\tThings moved gradually, but they got very big, and neither you nor the band ever seemed intimidated by major labels or opening for Guns N’ Roses or anything like that.\n\t\n\n\tSoundgarden had a work ethic that really served them. They all had day jobs until touring made it impossible, and we were very, very conscientious about money. I mean, I had a little fund and I would write them $600-a-month paychecks. It was a “slow and steady wins the race” attitude and a really, really strong work ethic — not that the other bands here didn’t also have one, but they might not have had perhaps the same crossover [potential], and the goals were different.\n\n\tEven though major labels were pursuing them fiercely, Soundgarden’s goal was to be on SST. I remember the painful conversation with Jonathan [Poneman of Sub Pop], standing on the corner at the Pike Place Market, and him saying, “We want to put out the next Soundgarden record, let’s do this,” and having to say, “Jonathan, you’re a dear friend and I wish I could say that was going to happen. But this thing is a juggernaut, it’s a rocket ship to who knows where, and they want to take the next step: They want to be on SST and then sign to a major.” They were very diligent about their steps — they didn’t want to jump right to a major, like Alice in Chains did later. They very cautiously weighed their opportunities, but the ethos was still, “There’s no benefit in leaving our roots behind in one fell swoop.” They were extremely methodical about the steps they took. \n\n\tThe major label world at that time was very sexist — it still is. How did you deal with that?\n\n\tWell, I had some mentors, but let’s preface that with the next major occurrence for me. \n\n\tBy 1988, I had set up an office with a fellow named Ken Deans who was running a production company. A man he knew asked him if we would consider working with a band that a guy named Randy was managing, “We’d love for you to come to the show, Randy has a surprise for everybody, they’re going to pick you up” at 7 p.m. or whatever. And a limo pulled up — which was unheard of in Seattle, I don’t even know if I’d ever seen a limo in Seattle. So I got in, with some trepidation, and met Alice in Chains for the first time.\n\n\tWe drove to this venue, a 45-minute ride, and the whole time they were reciting, from beginning to end, the movie “Fletch.” It was absolutely hilarious, I laughed the whole way, and then they put on a show that blew my mind and I listened to their cassette for the next four weeks. Eventually Randy dropped out of the picture and Ken decided he didn’t want to be in the management business, so he asked his friend Kelly Curtis [later Pearl Jam’s manager] and I if we would like to adopt Alice in Chains, and we did.\n\t\n\n\tAnyway, my first mentor, with Soundgarden, was [attorney] Peter Paterno. He helped me learn everything I needed to know about the record business and he shepherded the band through the various offers. The learning curve was steep, and he was incredibly patient and is one of the most wonderful humans on the planet. \n\n\tSo I brought Alice to him when Kelly and I started managing them and the record companies were showing strong interest. I was in his office one day and a woman walked by. Peter said, “Hey Michele, come in here. I want to introduce you to Susan Silver — you’re a chick, she’s a chick, and she’s managing a band with a chick name. Maybe you should work together.” And that’s how I met the amazing powerhouse, Michele Anthony.\n\n\tMichele took over as lead counsel for Alice, and we weighed through the various offers that they received and started to hone in on Columbia. She beat them senseless — so much so that as a signing gift, Alice gave her a pair of signed boxing gloves, which she still has in her office. And eventually [Columbia chiefs] Don Ienner and Tommy Mottola said, “We don’t ever want to be on the other side of the fence from you. Would you come and work with us?” Which is how she got to the label side of the business. \n\n\tPeter re-adopted Alice [as attorney], and he is still their attorney to this day, and Michele became an incredible mentor and a dear, dear friend. She showed me how this can be done with strategy and a deep concern for the welfare of the artist — she was a very, very pro-artist attorney, certainly, but even as a label executive, she continued to fight for the artist’s vision. And she taught me a lot about staying strong when you feel like you’re being treated unfairly, whether it was the client being treated unfairly or where we as women were being not taken as seriously as we should have been — and also to just not believe [the unfair criticism].\n\n\tThen the next mentor that she introduced me to, Sharon Osborne, is also the personification of strength and grace. She gave me the confidence to keep moving forward with my career. She’s really one of the most extraordinary people I’ve ever witnessed — in life and in business. Her ability to encompass and balance personal and business life, while remaining one of the fiercest negotiators the industry has ever seen, sets her in her own pantheon. \n\t\n\n\tThat was brought so strongly back to me this summer when I had the experience of being in Birmingham at “Back to the Beginning” [the final Black Sabbath concert, last July]. I’ve been to a lot of events in my life, but none that radiated with such an incredible sense of love and community. I saw more misty eyes in leather jackets than I ever thought imaginable! And it was Sharon who set the tone and the directive for that incredible day. \n\n\tBut your approach is so different from hers. I’ve never even heard you raise your voice. \n\n\tWell, I don’t have the sort of profile that she or even Michele does, so the motto for me has always been to walk softly and carry a big stick — and as the ironies of life would have it, who do I end up having for management partners with Alice in Chains but Velvet Hammer [Management]?\n\n\tBut I will fight for my client, and there are people who have received my ire if they go up against the ethos of what a band stands for. I’m thinking of one poor [major-label executive] with the Screaming Trees, when he started down a somewhat condescending path about how many records they’d be able to sell and how their idea of putting out vinyl, although quaint, was not going to happen — and he was saying it in front of [lead singer] Mark Lanegan, by the way. It was so inappropriate and I just felt so protective, and he needed to be schooled — he didn’t understand, from a major-label perspective, where bands like Screaming Trees had come from. So… just put it this way: At the end of the day, they got the vinyl!\n\n\tSoundgarden and Alice in Chains’ rise to the top was almost in lockstep — the 1991 Clash of the Titans tour for Alice (with Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax) and the 1991-92 Guns N’ Roses tour for Soundgarden pushed things to a whole other level.\n\n\tA whole other level. From ’90 through ’93 and even into the ’94, it was nonstop. And don’t forget, in January of ’92 Nirvana knocked Michael Jackson out of the Billboard No. 1 slot, and there was the “Singles” film [which featured all three of the bands Silver managed], there was so much going on. \n\n\tHow did the bands cope with all that happening at once? Wasn’t it overwhelming?\n\n\tAt the time, it didn’t feel overwhelming. Honestly, it felt …\n\t\n\n\tVindicating?\n\n\tNo, no, there wasn’t that energy at all. There was never that “We’ll show you!” vibe. It was more excitement, “Wow, we’re getting to do this!” and building every day, building, building, building. People talk about it being an overnight success, but it wasn’t. I started in the early ‘80s and this was almost a decade later. With a band like Alice, they just wanted to be out there playing, they were born for this. \n\n\tWith Soundgarden, there was a little more pacing needed because they, as I mentioned, did things very methodically and… what some people would assume are the alluring parts of life on the road were not of interest to them. That was not who Soundgarden was; they did not fall under “sex, drugs, and rock and roll.” It was about work and playing great shows and seeing other bands that they loved get opportunities.\n\n\tI remember listening to Kim try to convince the head of A&M to sign [Seattle band] Presidents of the United States of America, like, “You don’t understand, these guys are amazing! You’ve got to give them a listen!” And they ended up going somewhere else and becoming very successful. [The band’s 1995 debut album went triple platinum.]\n\n\tI remember Chris as a pretty shy person. How did he deal with all the attention and becoming the iconic rock god that people made him out to be? \n\n\tChris was very private, that’s something we shared. We were both shy kids and shy growing up, and as he grew into the incredible singer and performer that he became, I think he had to put a sort of invisible shield around himself because he was very, very sensitive to external energy. He wasn’t the guy to sit around and read reviews or listen to people’s opinions about his band or about his performance — and he hated gossip. So I think it was more as a sort of eyes-down, walk straight ahead, put that invisible force field around himself. And that often could be interpreted as arrogance, but really it was shyness and being a very sensitive person — and a necessary self-defense.\n\n\tBecause as we’ve seen, this business, the industry and the fans themselves, will chew an artist up and spit them out. And with the onset of instant information, it’s almost like we as a people have somehow demonstrated this sort of lower vibration of feeling better about ourselves when we see other people fail. I feel so lucky for myself and for my clients that they had this success before the digital age.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSilver with Alice in Chains, circa 1994 (Courtesy Susan Silver)\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSo now we’re up to 1994 and ’95. We know what happened with Alice, but when did it feel like Soundgarden was starting to break up? \n\n\t“Down on the Upside” [released in 1996, the band’s final album until 2010] was a tough record to make. I think they started to be of different minds creatively. And with success comes a pressure that doesn’t get discussed enough. There are incredible upsides to success that are very obvious, but there also comes a payoff in not only a lack of privacy, but sometimes in real physical threats — not only externally but internally. So we often see people second-guessing themselves: “How did this happen so fast? Where am I going? Have I done the right thing?” There’s a momentum in it, and then it’s really, really hard to get off the gerbil wheel.\n\n\tIt can cause some real mental suffering. When young people have that kind of success — and certainly money is an element in it — that access becomes problematic if the person has any sort of mental-health issues. Self-medicating becomes an avenue that a lot of people take, thinking it will help them make sense of it, and as we’ve all seen, it’s even encouraged. The access is there.\n\n\tYou mean access to things that are not healthy? \n\n\tYeah, accesses that lead to substance abuse, but there’s also access in terms of … there’s a world in which doors open. There are people who are paid to do things for successful people, not exclusively musicians but also actors, executives, athletes. There’s an access that starts to create a different set of expectations, and if not monitored, can turn into entitlement — which I think is one of the greatest core-rotters there is, when people start to demonstrate entitled behavior. It’s as hard to recover from as narcissism.\n\n\tSuccess can breed that, it can breed all of those ills. We all have dark sides of our unconscious minds, and it takes a lot of self-awareness and self-actualization to check our behaviors and ask the deep questions: “Am I on track?” And sometimes the route becomes substance abuse, sometimes it becomes abuse of the people closest to us. And sadly more times than not, I’ve seen successful people lose the plot, and then their world just becomes other successful people, and they’re in this bubble that is missing a healthy dose of reality. They’ll step out of it once in awhile to do some charity work or something, and then go right back into it.\n\t\n\n\tI get it, because it’s safe being around people who know what you’re going through. But at the same time, if not monitored, can become destructive. \n\n\tIs that what happened? \n\n\tTo Chris?\n\n\tTo any of them. \n\n\tOh, it’s happened to many, many of the musicians that I watched as my professional life grew. And some it hasn’t, and they’re wonderful. But there’s a price that gets paid at the crossroads for success, and it just takes it takes a lot of introspection to not fall into it irretrievably. \n\n\tThis all deserves someone smarter than me doing a dissertation or a well-funded scientific study. But, you know, idol worship is… well, we all know where it leads.\n\n\tJust bringing it back to your career, did you stop managing at any point? \n\n\tNo. After Soundgarden disbanded in ’97 and Alice was in their dormant period — they never broke up — people just assumed that I wasn’t managing, but I was doing administrative management for both bands. I managed Alice the whole time and still do, and Soundgarden up until 2010, when they got back together. Chris and I were divorced by then, and Alice was active and I was really back full-time with them, and it made sense for [Soundgarden] to be under a management umbrella with Chris.\n\n\tWeren’t you also raising your daughter at that point? \n\n\tYes, that was my main focus. From the time that Soundgarden disbanded, my main focus was bringing Lily into the world. And then, sadly, Chris and I parted when she was two. So yeah, I had some understandably quiet years. But then, in 2005, when Lily was almost five, Alice put on what’s known as the “tsunami show.”\n\n\tAfter the Indonesian tsunami in December of 2004, Sean Kinney [Alice in Chains drummer], who is one of the most caring human beings on the planet, was just devastated by what he was seeing on the news and said, “We have to do something.” That’s how the tsunami benefit came together [where Alice in Chains’ surviving bandmembers performed together for the first time in six years, with guest vocalists including Tool’s Maynard James Keenan filling in for Staley], and it was such a profound experience.\n\n\tA few months later, [AIC guitarist/singer Jerry Cantrell] and Sean called and said, “We want to do this again.” I was really focused on my daughter and getting through a very painful divorce, and I said, “I’m really happy for you guys, you’re not too old, go for it.”\n\t\n\n\tBut Sean said, “I said we are going to go out and do it one more time. That’s you and us. We’re not doing it without you.”\n\n\tAnd I swear to you, after all the therapy and soul retrievals and praying that I had been doing to put my heart together over the previous few years, it was like all the disparate pieces came back together. I had been given such an incredible gift, and of course initially I started to backpedal and came up with a million reasons why I couldn’t do it. And they just said, “We’re not doing it without you. You’re coming with us.”\n\n\tSo by the end of the year, they had brought [current singer] William Duvall into the mix, and they had to do the slow build in the club scene. At first, I couldn’t get them arrested. I’d call people and say, “They would love to perform at your benefit” and I’d hear, “Yeah, call us later, bye!,” laughing. But it built slowly, 2006, 2007, and by 2010 they were headlining Madison Square Garden. That was a very satisfying and solidifying experience for all of us. It changed the dynamic of my relationship with them, certainly.\n\n\tManagement is often considered the parental figure in a band’s life, and I can understand that, but we had been through so much together. Certainly the loss of Layne and, shortly after, the loss of [bassist] Mike Starr, and all of the substance abuse that they had been through and the subsequent sobriety. So by the time they started working again, our dynamic had changed to one of a very familial partnership. I’d work for free for those guys for the rest of my life if they wanted. They really gave me my life back.\n\n\tWasn’t it hard to do that as a single mom? \n\n\tIt was incredibly hard to get back into business mode as a single mom. There is no greater hero in this world than a single mom. It is the hardest job, hands down, I’ve ever done and that I’ve ever witnessed. Teachers are right up there as unsung heroes, but it’s really, really painful to leave your leave your child and go on a business trip. Your brain and your heart get split in two different directions. \n\n\tBut at the same time, it has provided a life for us and a sense of purpose for me — not that being a parent isn’t one of life’s great purposes, if not the greatest. And I had amazing people around me, including Chris’s family, who are our lifeblood and our stability, mine and Lily’s, they have been absolutely incredible and are to this day. But it was difficult, for sure. \n\t\n\n\tAre you managing any other acts right now? \n\n\tI am only managing Alice and I currently have the good fortune of acting as, call it guidance counselor or consigliere, for the Brudi Brothers. \n\n\tOne of the other things I do is volunteer at a music and film youth camp that also has a young entrepreneur division called Prodigy Camp. There’s a twofold path: Helping to support young people, 13 to 19 years old, as they face and think about their life’s most difficult times, and then helping them to transform that into film or music. I’ve been with them for five years, and watching some of these young people navigate really hard circumstances into solid careers in film and in music has been one of life’s great satisfactions. They create an incredibly collaborative environment between the Campers and the mentors — the mentors are industry professionals like me, and they’re also returning Campers.\n\n\tOne of the original Campers who has come back for 10 years to mentor is Chappell Roan. For her to be there in the midst of all of her wild success is a testament of the camp and to her.\n\n\tAs we were saying earlier about how people cope with fame and attention: She has the foundation to say what she needs with vulnerability, honesty and strength. I admire her so much for how she’s handling it all.\n\n\tHow is your daughter’s career as a music manager going?\n\n\tIt’s going well. The Brudi Brothers came out of the box with basically no road experience, and there was a feeding frenzy a la ‘80s Seattle. But they wisely — and intuitively, I think — picked [New York-based indie label] Mom + Pop, who have given them a lot of space as well as a tremendous amount of support. So they’ve really been growing and working this year, and got some great tours. They’ve been out with Sierra Farrell a few times, did some Charlie Crockett shows, another little tour with Wyatt Flores, so it’s been really fun to watch them grow.\n\n\tTop-of-mind, what advice would you have for young female managers or executives who are trying to get into the business?\n\n\tStay the course. Double-check your work, because somebody else will be double-checking it. Don’t give anybody a reason to think you’re not 1,000% capable. Keep emotions out of the business dealings and out of the interactions with the clients. Suit up, show up, and do good work, and your work will speak for itself. \n\t\n\n\tAnd you have to care about what you’re doing — that’s the other thing. A lot of musicians who become public figures, they almost don’t have a choice; they’re driven internally by some North Star. It’s the same in business. You have to want it so badly that you’re willing to do it for free, to put in the hours to go above and beyond.\n\n\tI don’t think the world has changed radically in terms of being male-dominated, but certainly we’re making inroads. We could get into a deep philosophical conversation about the “last swing of the patriarchy” and all of that, but really, you know, old habits die hard. You look at countries where there are, for example, female prime ministers, and it works just fine. So the United States is a little behind in both politics and business, but we’re making progress. I had incredible mentors that helped open doors for me and encouraged me to just keep doing good work.\n\n\tLast question: How does it feel to see Soundgarden going into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? \n\n\tI’m so proud of them. So proud of them. It’s so deserved, so well-earned, I’m absolutely thrilled and excited to be there with them, to see them perform, to see the surprises they have in store.\n\n\tIt wouldn’t have happened, at least not in this way, without you. \n\n\t(Through slightly gritted teeth.) And it wouldn’t have happened without me (laughing).\n\n\tYou actually said it!\n\n\t(Still laughing) I’m trying! I’m really trying to look at this with some inclusion for myself, which is why I’m talking with you today. We get reflective at this stage in life, especially as the losses mount, and I have to say again, Sharon did it with “Back to the Beginning.” I left that event feeling more alive, purposeful, excited about the future than I can remember feeling in decades. \n\n\tI remember standing in the front with [Alice in Chains bassist] Mike Inez’s wife, Sydney, while Mike played bass with Ozzy for those five songs. Ozzy was so powerful, and when he started singing “Mama, I’m Coming Home,” it was an otherworldly experience. His voice changed, his features changed, the audience got quiet and I could feel the tears coming. Then the audience started singing and finished that song for him, and he had tears streaming down his face.\n\n\tThere have been a lot of reasons to reflect lately, and seeing this next generation take over has been a big part of it for me, whether it’s Chappell or the Brudi Brothers. It’s torch-passing time, and I’m thrilled to see yet another Seattle group carve out a place in yet another genre of music. I continue to be super, super proud of Seattle.\n",

Allen was riding as a passenger in a vehicle that was pulled over after the driver improperly changed lanes on an interstate about 50 miles from Memphis.\n      \n\n          Authorities say Allen was found with a bag of marijuana on him ... and when deputies searched the vehicle, they allegedly found cocaine in a cigarette box.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Allen later posed for a mug shot in a white T-shirt ... and based on his expression, he's not thrilled about it.\n      \n    \n          The 43-year-old was a staple on the Grizzlies from 2011 to 2017, and also played for the Boston Celtics and New Orleans Pelicans. His jersey was retired by the Grizzlies in March -- and he's widely considered one of the best defensive players of all time.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          This isn't the first time Allen's been in trouble with the law ... in 2023, he pled guilty in a federal case involving an NBA health insurance and fraud scheme -- and was sentenced to community service and three years of supervised probation.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

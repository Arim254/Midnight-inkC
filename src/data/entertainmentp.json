    "description": "\n\tPortuguese documentary filmmaker Susana de Sousa Dias, who is the guest of honor at IDFA, spoke to the festival’s artistic director Isabel Arrate Fe",
    "body": "\n\tPortuguese documentary filmmaker Susana de Sousa Dias, who is the guest of honor at IDFA, spoke to the festival’s artistic director Isabel Arrate Fernandez this week about how she set out to interrogate the repressive methods of her country’s fascist regime through an examination of its archives and footage from the period.\n\n\tDe Sousa Dias, who was inspired to become a filmmaker by the masters of Italian neorealism such as Luchino Visconti, first became interested in re-examining historical subjects by delving into archives when she was asked to direct an episode of a series on Portuguese cinema.\n\t\n\n\tHer episode was on the period 1930 to 1945, during which fascism tightened its grip on Portugal, the start of a four-decade long reign of terror, presided over by António de Oliveira Salazar.\n\n\n\tFollowing that, she came across the case of two Portuguese nurses who were jailed for protesting against a law barring nurses from getting married. She decided to make her first film, 2000’s “Criminal Case 141/53,” about the nurses, one of whom endured frequent beatings and solitary confinement.\n\n\tThis led her to dive deeper into the archives left behind by the fascist regime, and specifically into the records of the political police, an archive that she says is extensive.\n\n\tThis, in turn, led to her feature “Still Life,” released in 2005, which is based on news reports, propaganda films and images from prison archives, and “48” in 2009, which juxtaposes the regime’s photographs of political prisoners with testimonies decades later, revealing the violence they were subjected to.\n\t\n\n\tShe commented that it was her discovery of albums of photographs of imprisoned political prisoners that drove her to make “Still Life.” “It made a huge impression on me, which I could not verbalize,” she said. But she was also conscious that there was so much that was missing – the cruel stories behind the photographs. That is what she sought to uncover.\n\n\t“If you go to the political police archive, you don’t see any reference to torture. You see the reports on the interrogations of the prisoners, but they don’t tell you that, meanwhile, they tortured them,” she said. “My films, in a certain way, are trying to fill some of these gaps.”\n\n\tShe added that the police archives turned her view of the world upside down. “It changed completely my perspective on life, my perspective on history, everything. It’s a very disturbing experience being inside the [police and military] archives,” she said.\n\n\tNonetheless, she decided to only use images from the police and military archives and archive footage produced under the control of the dictatorship.\n\n\tThis posed a dilemma for the director in that these photographs and footage were shot from the perspective of the dictatorship. “I wanted to show the other side of the dictatorship, and this obliged me to undertake deep research into the interior of the images,” she said.\n\n\tAll of this was done in the editing, which she did herself on a Moviola, focusing on certain areas of the image and omitting others. She found herself looking for “something in the image that had escaped the message that the regime wanted to convey,” she said. These details in the images are what she calls “a montage within the shots.” She referred to an image as an “active entity” to be examined for meaning, asking, “What does an image do? And what does an image do to us?”\n\n\tThe film’s sound effects and music, which was composed by her brother, António de Sousa Dias, helped her compose the images, and both the composition of the music and the editing process progressed hand-in-hand.\n\n\t“When I started editing, I didn’t even know where I could start from,” she said. “But when I heard this music, click, the whole film appeared in my mind. It was the concept: I’m going to organize the film like it is an exhibition, with different rooms.” These would include “the rooms for the colonies, the rooms of war, the rooms of the church,” and so on.\n\t\n\n\tAs time passed, the Portuguese authorities in charge of the archives made it more difficult for De Sousa Dias to access them by insisting on authorization being given by those in the photos through a process she called “Kafkaesque.” But still she found ways to do so, she explained, without giving away her methods, although she quoted Werner Herzog, who said filmmakers need “good criminal energy” to make films.\n\n\tHowever, when she contacted the former inmates, she found they could also give her the backstory to their prison mugshots. That led to another realization. “Maybe I can enter into the images to see what we cannot see: what happened inside the prisons, traces of torture,” she said. This led to her next film “48,” fuelled by a simple idea: mugshots and people talking about the mugshots.\n\n\tAlthough she had the testimonies of the former prisoners typed out, at some point she threw them away, she explained, and worked directly with the recordings and the images, “editing the film through listening,” she said. What was important, she found, was not just what was said, but the way it was said, complete with pauses. She said that the way she edited the testimonies have been compared to a Japanese haiku.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Beatles have found their legendary producer. \n\n\tHarry Lloyd, the British actor best known for playing Viserys Targaryen in the first season “Game of Thrones,” is set to portray George Martin in the upcoming four-part Beatles biopic by director Sam Mendes.\n\n\tLloyd joins Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney, Harrison Dickinson as John Lennon and Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr and Joseph Quinn as George Harrison in Sony Pictures‘ “The Beatles — A Four-Film Cinematic Event,” due for release in 2028. \n\t\n\n\tThe casting is being revealed by Martin’s son, Giles Martin, in a pre-recorded interview going out on the Ryan Tubridy Show on Virgin Radio U.K later on Friday. “He’s really good. He’s very committed,” he said. Variety has since confirmed the casting with the production.\n\n\n\tMartin — was passed away in 2016 — was commonly referred to as the “fifth Beatle” for his extensive involvement in each of the band’s original albums. He wrote most of the orchestral and string arrangements and also played piano or keyboards on a number of their tracks. Once described as “the world’s most famous record producer,” across a 60-year career Martin produced 30 number one hit singles in U.K. and 23 in the U.S., winning six Grammys. \n\n\tAlongside “Game of Thrones,” Lloyd has appeared in major shows such as “Wolf Hall” and “Legion,” playing Charles Xavier. He is due to star in the upcoming sixth season of “Slow Horses.”\n\n\tThe much-discussed Beatles films are now in production and being directed back-to-back by Mendes, with a trio of award-winning writers — Jez Butterworth, Peter Straughan and Jack Thorne — having penned the scripts. Production is expected to carry on into late 2026, with Sony releasing all four movies simultaneously in April 2028.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVimal Krishna, who wrote and directed Telugu-language blockbuster “DJ Tillu,” has wrapped a key shooting schedule in Kashmir for his next film “Anumana Pakshi,” marking an India-Indonesia co-production venture.\n\n\tThe character-driven feature stars Rag Mayur, known for “Sivarapalli,” in the lead role alongside Merin Philip. The project is being produced through a partnership between Chilaka Productions and Spectrum Films, with producers Rajiv Chilaka, Rajesh Jagtiani and Hirachand Dand, and co-producer Bharath Laxmipati.\n\t\n\n\tChilaka is the creator of iconic animation character “Chhota Bheem,” and the founder and CEO of Green Gold Animation.\n\n\n\tThe production recently completed a 20-day schedule in Pahalgam and Srinagar in Kashmir, following all necessary security protocols under CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) guidance. According to the producers, this marks the first film to shoot in Kashmir, particularly Pahalgam, following a tragedy that occurred in the region earlier this year.\n\n\tThe Kashmir schedule represents approximately 80% of the film’s completion, with the next shooting phase planned for late November. The team previously filmed a brief schedule in Visakhapatnam in September.\n\n\tThe ensemble cast includes Prince Cecil, Ananya, Charith, Brahmaji, Ajay and veteran actress Raasi in supporting roles.

    "body": "\n\tStephen Soderbergh has completed his still-untitled documentary centered on John Lennon‘s final interview which he describes as “an incredible historical document” that is “even more relevant today” than it was 45 years ago on the fateful day of December 8, 1980, when Lennon was killed.\n\n\t“I’m excited about it,” Soderbergh said, speaking at the inaugural Doha Film Festival where his latest film “The Christophers” is launching internationally after premiering in Toronto.\n\t\n\n\tGiven the interview’s historical importance, the job is to present the doc “in such a way that it enhances the interview and doesn’t distract from it,” he said. “I’m not looking to re-invent the form. I’m just hoping to create a film that gets as many people as possible to hear what John and Yoko had to say on that afternoon before he was killed,” Soderbergh noted.\n\n\n\t“They were both so free in their discussions. As someone who has been interviewed many times I was surprised at how open and excited they were to talk,” he continued. “You would think they had never been interviewed before.” \n\n\t“So I want that to come across to the audience. Everything that they said 45 years ago is not just relevant today. It’s even more relevant in terms or relationships, politics, how we treat each other. How systems work on the individual and above all on the importance of love in our daily life and our world,” the prolific director went on to add. \n\n\tLennon’s final in-depth interview took place alongside Yoko on Dec. 8, 1980. He had just turned 40 and emerged from a five-year hiatus from the music industry to care for his son, Sean. It was the only radio interview granted around the release of their album, “Double Fantasy.” That afternoon, they met a team from RKO Radio at the Dakota, their New York City apartment building and held a wide-ranging conversation.\n\t\n\n\tTwelve hours later Lennon was dead — gunned down outside the Dakota by Mark David Chapman. \n\n\tThe still untitled John Lennon doc marks Soderbergh’s first feature documentary in many years, following “And Everything Is Going Fine,” a portrait of artist Spalding Gray released in 2010.\n\n\tExecutive producers on the project include Soderbergh, Michael Sugar and David Hillman of Sugar23, and Nancy Saslow and David Hudson of Mishpookah Entertainment Group.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTALLINN, Estonia — Mongolian filmmaker Sengedorj Janchivdorj is back in competition at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival with “The Muralist,” one of 16 world premieres in the main section.\n\n\tOne of Mongolia’s most acclaimed and prolific filmmakers, Sengedorj won the festival’s Grand Prix in 2024 for “Silent City Driver,” which has gone on to represent Mongolia in the international feature film category at 2026’s 98th Academy Awards.\n\t\n\n\tA visually striking meditation on art, memory, and reconciliation, “The Muralist” is the film Sengedorj says he always wanted to make: “I’ve been making movies for over 20 years. One of my secret and biggest dreams was to make a movie about an artist. In my other movies, there was always an artist in the background. This time, the muralist is the main character,” he told Variety.\n\n\n\tThe film follows Bayaraa, a once-successful muralist who returns to Mongolia after years living in Europe with little else than a box of paints, a rooftop tent and his loyal stray dog. Day after day, he works to transform an abandoned factory wall into a sweeping mural of mythical Mongolian landscapes, which contrast with the surrounding green hills and creeping urbanization. As demolition looms and a group of Japanese tourists take an interest in his art, Bayaraa is forced to face the ghosts of the family he left behind, under the watchful presence of a balloon tethered to him.\n\n\tShot by longtime collaborator Nergui Erdenekhuyag, “The Muralist” features Sengedorj’s trademark poetic imagery. It is a loose adaptation of “Picture of the Soul,” a romantic novel by Mongolian author Khishigjargal Dashdorj, who co-wrote and executive produced the film.\n\t\n\n\tAt its core, the film grapples with a dilemma every artist faces, said the director: “To choose between art or life. Bayaraa chose art but [his life] is not balanced and that’s why he regrets it. But I don’t want to tell the audience what to think, I want to leave it up to them to decide,” he says.\n\n\tSymbolizing the blurred line between art and everyday reality, the balloon changes color with Bayaraa’s mood as he confronts his past, which unfolds in nostalgic black-and-white flashbacks. \n\n\tThe score, by Italian-educated Mongolian composer Tsolmonbayar Munkhtovch, also reflects this evolution, as uplifting piano solos make way for a gently nostalgic cello-violin-piano trio.\n\n\tSengedorj says he found his lead actor, B.S.Bayinerile, in Inner Mongolia after a long search. “The character of Bayaraa is very introverted, he speaks little. It’s as if it’s raining inside – every time he meets with his daughter, it rains. That sadness, all of those emotions, had to be reflected in the actor’s eyes and his face.”\n\n\tJapan-based Mongolian actress Ishiyama Gegeenzaya plays Bayaraa’s long-lost daughter.\n\n\tProduction was brisk but intensive, spanning July and August 2024. The film was shot on location in an abandoned Soviet factory on the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar, with interior scenes filmed in one of Mongolia’s large Russian-era stages.\n\n\tLooking ahead, Sengedorj says he has completed the script for his next film which he describes as an ambitious love story set during an art festival in Italy. \n\n\tThe director’s return to Tallinn’s main competition underscores the growing visibility of Mongolia’s cinema, boosted in recent years by funding from the country’s new National Film Council. Films like “If Only I Could Hibernate” (Cannes 2023) and “City of Wind” (Venice Orizzonti 2023) have brought global attention, while shorts such as “Snow in September” have won top prizes at Venice and Toronto.\n\n\tCo-produced by Javkhlan Sonomdorj and Lkhamdulam Dashdorj, with Khishigjargal Dashdorj as executive producer, “The Muralist” premiered on Nov. 19 at Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival. The main competition winner will be announced Nov. 21, with the festival wrapping on Nov. 23.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA sleeper hit in 2022, Jalmari Helander’s “Sisu” was a cartoonishly down-and-dirty adrenaline rush for action fans, not unlike the OG “Mad Max” decades earlier. That particular comparison grows even more apt with the arrival of “Sisu: Road to Revenge,” in which Jorma Tommila’s seemingly unkillable protagonist must battle innumerable bad guys at high speed on various forms of transport. \n\n\tBigger isn’t necessarily better, and this larger-scaled sequel almost inevitably lacks some of the freshness that made the original such a kick. Still, the director’s undeniable flair for gleefully excessive mayhem and propulsive pacing will more than satisfy those who loved its predecessor. Its comparatively lean, mean progress feels particularly welcome after so many recent screen thrill rides that delivered far less punch at much greater length and expense. \n\t\n\n\tLast time around, decommissioned Finnish army commando Aatami Korpi (Tommila) only wanted to be left alone as WW2 wound down. Alas, finding gold in the Lapland tundra awakened the greed of departing Nazi forces with zero idea who they were messing with: a “one-man death squad” who’d already claimed many a uniformed Russian life after Soviet forces killed his family during the brief but brutal “Winter War” of 1940. His vengeance was sweet, gory and spectacularly over-the-top. \n\n\n\tThis time, the terrifically fit 60-something protagonist is encountered in 1946, the global conflict now officially well over. He’s driving a huge truck to his old home, which thanks to redrawn borders now lies in Russian territory. He intends to dismantle, then reassemble it in what remains of Finland. But Soviet authorities haven’t forgotten that this “legend” singlehandedly snuffed out more than 300 of their troops. \n\t\n\n\tRed Army officer Igor Draganov (Stephen Lang) is released from a Siberian prison — where he’s being held for committing innumerable needless wartime atrocities — by a KBG bigwig (Richard Brake) to ensure Aatami never sees Finnish soil again. The two adversaries are uniquely matched, in that Korpi knows the other brutally murdered his wife and sons, while Draganov won’t feel he’s truly completed the job until the father is dead, too.\n\n\tThis setup takes about 10 minutes, after which it’s one dynamic set-piece after another: Aatami manages to escape an initial roadblock-cum-ambush, then attack by phalanx of motorcylists, followed by fighter planes with machine guns. After a brief aquatic interlude, there’s a protracted climax aboard a train speeding back to Siberia, bearing myriad armed Soviets plus one bloodied, shackled prisoner. Needless to say, the survival odds are stacked — against the poor Russkies, that is. \n\n\tDivided into six titled “chapters,” these episodes are mostly aces in terms of staging, stuntwork and CGI. Occasionally, the violence comes so thick, we’re not quite sure what just happened. And even within the suspended-disbelief bounds established, a few hairbreadth escapes are preposterous, notably one where Aatami makes a tank do mid-air acrobatics to leap past a barrier. \n\n\tEntertaining as it is, such craziness isn’t so well supported by a thread of black comedy as it was in the first “Sisu.” You could also argue there’s a bit too much dwelling on general ickiness here, as the manliest man in the far north seems to be frequently digging bullets and other objects out of his lacerated flesh. (Spending pretty much the last half hour bleeding in boxer shorts amid subzero weather appears not to bother him in the slightest.) \n\n\tBut Tommila’s turn retains a degree of flinty humor, even some warmth — despite never getting so much as a word to speak. Lang’s expletive-riddled speech comprises most of the dialogue. If Draganov isn’t the most distinctive villain role he’s ever essayed, he still fills its shoes well, receiving a particularly explosive exit as reward. Brake’s part is brief, while other cast members provide no more than cannon fodder. The canine performer playing the protagonist’s Bedlington terrier disappears for quite some time, in one among several minor if conspicuous plot holes in Helander’s script that it’s best just to step over. \n\t\n\n\tShot largely in Estonia, “Sisu: Road to Revenge” is muscular rather than ingratiating in most aspects, from Mika Orasma’s widescreen cinematography to the physical design contributions. The fairly standard action bombast of Juri Seppa and Tuomas Wainola’s original score gets some idiosyncratic flavor via passages of throat singing and spaghetti-Western-style whistling. The English-language version reviewed has a bit of subtitled Finnish speech toward the end; a separate Finnish-language edition is also in release.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndian animation powerhouse Green Gold Animation, the studio behind popular children’s franchise “Chhota Bheem,” and U.K.-based Red Kite Animation have partnered on “The Assassin,” an adult-oriented animated feature that marks a significant India-U.K. co-production venture.\n\n\tThe project was unveiled at the WAVES Film Bazaar, the market component of the International Film Festival of India, Goa, by Rajiv Chilaka, founder and CEO of Green Gold Animation, and Ken Anderson, founder and CEO of Red Kite Animation.\n\t\n\n\t“The Assassin” is written and directed by Martyn Pick, whose previous directing credit includes the CGI action-animation feature “Ultramarines: A Warhammer 40,000 Movie” (2010). Martha MacDiarmid, known for her work on “Nessie Junior,” serves as script editor, continuing her creative collaboration with Red Kite.\n\n\n\tThe film is set in a fractured near-future metropolis and follows an ordinary young man pushed to breaking point after a devastating industrial tragedy. As corporate power tightens its grip on the city, his search for justice drives him into a dangerous transformation, igniting events that challenge the system from within.\n\n\t“‘The Assassin’ is an ultra cinematic action film that uses bold 21c century visuals to give the audience a visceral experience of the hero’s physical and psychological journey. For me it is the culmination of a career fusing animation and live action for maximum expressive power. within the dynamic power of genre and commercial storytelling. Red Kite have superb insight, both commercial and creative, about animation and film both as storytelling and as a visual medium. Green Gold combine outstanding artistic skill and understanding with a powerful pipeline. They are the perfect partners to realise the Assassin’s extraordinary vision,” Pick said.\n\t\n\n\tVisual development is being led by Pick in collaboration with Green Gold’s Hyderabad-based design team, whose concept art and mood exploration establish the stylistic foundation for the ambitious animated feature.\n\n\tThe partnership represents a creative departure for Green Gold Animation, which has built its reputation primarily on family-friendly content, most notably the “Chhota Bheem” franchise. The collaboration signals the studio’s expansion into adult-oriented animation and global co-production partnerships.\n\n\tThe film aims to qualify under the India-U.K. Co-Production Treaty, with production planned across Hyderabad and the U.K. The financing strategy includes the U.K.’s Independent Film Tax Credit, with both studios participating as equitable partners throughout development, production and distribution.\n\n\t“This partnership represents a powerful alignment of ambition and creative energy,” Anderson said. “‘The Assassin’ pushes into bold new territory for adult animation, and collaborating with Rajiv and the outstanding artists at Green Gold gives the film an expansive visual identity from the very beginning.”\n\n\tChilaka added: “Green Gold has always championed original ideas and distinctive visual storytelling. Working with Red Kite on this India-U.K. feature strengthens our commitment to global collaboration and to creating boundary-pushing animated cinema.”\n\n\tThe project combines guerrilla live-action, rotoscoping and high-end animation techniques. The film is currently in active development, with financing and production planning underway.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBritish director Dan Löwenstein, known for vertical dramas like ReelShort’s “Pride & Prejudice,” is set to direct and produce a new and as-yet untitled U.K.-made microdrama currently in development with Night Train Media and Spirit Studios.\n\n\tThe project was confirmed by Eccho Rights and Night Train executive Sarah Postlethwaite during a panel at the Tallinn Black Nights Festival reflecting the format’s rapid global rise and Britain’s potentially growing role as a production base for mobile-native storytelling. Postlethwaite described it as “one of the first U.K.-produced vertical dramas.”\n\t\n\n\tLöwenstein, who has directed some 18 vertical mini series in the past year for companies including the Chinese-backed U.S. platform ReelShort, has already put together a series overview and a first 10-episodes breakdown with two co-writers: a TikTok content creator “with 4.2 million views,” and a “more traditional scripted content comedian.”\n\n\n\t“We’re getting to a point where we can start going out to platforms and commissioners and try and find who’s going to have our show. We’re at very, very early stages,” said Postlethwaite. “They all have different models: some will commission, others will licence. We’re trying to learn as much as we can and work out what’s right. But, yes, it’s fresh to us all,” she told the industry crowd at the Nordic Hotel Forum.\n\n\tThe news came during a broader discussion on vertical storytelling entitled Vertical Horizons – Does Size Matter? Rewiring Serialized Content to Fit Gen Z’s Consuming Habits, an Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event session exploring how short-form vertical dramas, known for fast-paced shoots and low-budget execution, are reshaping story structure, production and monetization models.\n\t\n\n\tModerated by Marike Muselaers from Nordisk Film Production, the panel brought together Postlethwaite; Seriencamp co-founder Gerhard Maier; U.S. writer-producer Andrew Higton and director Shaun Higton; and Czech producer Krystof Safer, the founder of vertical film festival Vertifilms.\n\n\tMaier opened with a rapid history of the format, tracing its roots from early Snapchat experiments and home-screen narratives to the fast-cut, emotion-led edits inspired by Chinese and South Korean creators that now define it.\n\n\tThe Higton brothers, who created Snapchat’s teen horror series “Dead of Night,” reflected on their first experience working in the format more than five years ago.\n\n\tAsked how he developed a visual approach for mobile-native viewers, Shaun Higton explained that he simply watched teenagers scrolling on public transport, thumbs hovering, ready to swipe away at any second. That observation shaped their entire approach: he and his brother decided to strip down their original script.\n\n\t“You can’t have a super complicated narrative, it’s got to be easily understood and pitched.” \n\n\tThe brothers added that Snapchat fully financed the series and provided analytics to keep audiences engaged, right down to user habits. “Anything from emojis to not using capital letters – ‘That’s not what kids do!’”\n\n\tThe panel also examined the economics driving Asia’s booming microdrama market. Episodes typically run two-to-three minutes across at least 60 installments, with viewers paying per episode after the first free batch. Payment is made via coins, tokens earned through games or ads or subscriptions – a model can generate “up to a million dollars per day in revenue,” Muselaers noted, prompting Safer to stress that Europe needs to pay attention to Asia’s lead.\n\n\t“I think we are underestimating China,” Safer said, noting that the appeal lies in stories that “go to the point. It’s not just trash: it’s about love, honesty, truthfulness. They have all the messages that we are trying to deliver in our films, they’re just doing it in a different form.”\n\n\tTotal production costs can be as low as $100,000, and timelines are equally aggressive. “From the moment you see the script ‘til it appears on the screen, there are about three to four weeks… 60, 70, 80 minutes of content, shot within five, six or seven days – that’s 14 minutes a day!” Safer said. \n\t\n\n\tLooking ahead, Maier argued that vertical and horizontal storytelling are increasingly influencing each other rather than siloed. Speaking to Variety after the session, he teased one of the German projects debuting at Seriencamp next June. Titled “Three Minutes,” the show lets users sign up to an app that randomly gives them a three-minute window to broadcast to millions, forcing them “to think on [their] feet and do something crazy,” he explained. “The vertical is a hook into the horizontal series that will follow the story of the protagonists. It’s a super crazy, great idea!”\n\n\tThe Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event runs until Nov. 21. The Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival wraps on Sunday. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAs the competition continues to heat up on Season 4 of “The Traitors,” Peacock has released a statement urging passionate fans of the show to cool off. \n\n\t“We are committed to making our casts feel safe, respected, and supported – on screen and off,” reads the statement, which was posted to the “Traitors” Instagram account Saturday. “The cast of ‘The Traitors’ are real people, and what happens in the game should never lead to cyberbullying or harassment. There’s a difference between discussing a show and targeting individuals.”\n\t\n\n\t“Let’s not ruin the passion for this show with unwarranted negativity and personal attacks,” the statement continued. “We appreciate your support!” \n\n\n\tThe statement comes as online discourse around the season’s cast — specifically “Bachelor” alum Colton Underwood — has reached a fever pitch. But this isn’t the first time Peacock has had to remind viewers to be mindful of their words. The streamer released a similar statement last summer on the “Love Island USA” X account, urging viewers to remember the “amazing group of Islanders” are “real people – so let’s be kind and spread the love!” \n\n\tOn “The Traitors,” reality stars from a range of franchises are chosen to be Faithfuls or Traitors. To win, Faithfuls must successfully vote out the secret Traitors, whose goal is to claim the $250,000 prize for themselves. This season, Lisa Rinna (“Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” alum), Rob Rausch (“Love Island USA”) and Candiace Dillard Bassett (“Real Housewives of Potomac” alum) are the three chosen Traitors. \n\t\n\n\tSo far, all of them are still in the competition, along with Faithfuls including Underwood, Dorinda Medley, Eric Nam, Johnny Weir, Kristen Kish, Mark Ballas, Maura Higgens, Natalie Anderson, Stephen Colletti, Tara Lipinski and Yam Yam Arocho.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaika Waititi‘s “Star Wars” movie has been in development since 2020, when Disney and Lucasfilm announced the “Jojo Rabbit” Oscar winner would helm a new film in the franchise written by “1917” scribe Krysty Wilson-Cairns. There’s been no big updates in the six years since, but interest in the project was recently revived after exiting Lucasfilm boss Kathleen Kennedy said Waititi’s “Star Wars” was “still somewhat alive.”\n\n\tSo what does Waititi have in store for “Star Wars” fans? “I’m just trying to go back and harness a little bit more of the fun from the original films, which is what I remember [from] them,” he told Variety at Sundance at the premiere of “Fing!”\n\t\n\n\t“The stakes are very high, and there’s serious things going on, but there’s also a lot of fun to be had in those films. That’s what I was trying to bring back,” Waititi continued. “I was trying to work in a world that was a little bit separate to that because they’ve got so many things going on within that space. For me to do something there, it would need to be a little different and a little bit more its own thing.”\n\n\tKennedy confirmed to Deadline after announcing her exit from Lucasfilm that Waititi has “turned in a script that I think is hilarious and great. It’s not just my decision, especially when I’ve got a foot out the door.”\n\n\tWaititi is at Sundance with the family adventure “Fing!,” which is based on the children’s book of the same name. Directed by Jeffrey Walker and co-starring Iona Bell, Mia Wasikowska and Blake Harrison, the film centers on a young girl and her parents as they contend with a viscount who is trying to get his hands on their wondrous pet creature. Waititi assumes the role of the movie’s villain.\n\t\n\n\t“It was all on the page, so it was pretty easy for me to tap into that,” Waititi said at the Variety Studio presented by Audible when asked about playing the bad guy. “I’ve always liked those kinds of characters.”\n\n\tWhen asked to name his favorite movie villain, Waititi returned the conversation back to the “Star Wars” franchise by naming Darth Vader “one of the greatest villains I’ve ever seen.”\n\n\t“He taps into a child’s biggest nightmare or fear, which that your parent will turn on you and you won’t be able to bring them back,” he added. “‘Body Snatchers’ is like that as well. Zombies, too, they’re great villains as a collective because it’s the idea of people you love who won’t recognize you and will want to eat your brains.”\n\n\tWaititi also expressed his interest in seeing the upcoming “Avengers: Doomsday,” which will feature the return of Thor. The director helmed two “Thor” movies with Chris Hemsworth and said it’s not uncomfortable to be sitting out the God of Thunder’s next movie adventure as the Russo Brothers direct Hemsworth this go around.\n\n\t“Thor was around before me,” Waititi said. “The stuff that Chris and I did and how we shaped him into that new version… that was for the greater good of the franchise as a whole. I can’t wait to see these ‘Avengers’ movies. I was just watching ‘Infinity War’ and ‘Endgame’ two weeks ago. They’re so good. I’m good friends with the Russos and will love to see what they’re doing.”\n\nTaika Waititi says his #StarWars movie in development at Lucasfilm will “harness a little more of the fun from the original films.”“The stakes are very high, and there are serious things going on, but there’s also a lot of fun to be had.”Waititi is promoting his new family… pic.twitter.com/Akli1pSo2t— Variety (@Variety) January 24, 2026\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNatalie Portman hit the Sundance Film Festival press circuit for “The Gallerist” wearing “ICE Out” and “Be Good” pins, just hours after a man was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis. Portman’s “Be Good” references Renée Good, who was killed by ICE in Minneapolis earlier this month. During an interview at the Variety Studio presented by Audible, Portman openly blasted ICE brutality.\n\n\t“This is such a joyful community celebrating film here and we’re so excited to be showing ‘The Gallerist,’ but we’re also at a moment in our country’s history that is quite devastating,” Portman said. “It’s really impossible not to talk about what is happening right now and the brutality of ICE and how it has to stop immediately. But also, there’s a beautiful community that Americans are showing right now. They’re showing up for each other, protecting each other and fighting for their freedom. It’s a bittersweet moment to celebrate something we’re so proud of on the backdrop of our nation in pain.”\n\t\n\n\tPortman’s interview took place ahead of the “The Gallerist” world premiere at this year’s festival. The movie, directed by “Birds of Prey” helmer Cathy Yan and co-starring Jenna Ortega,  centers on a desperate gallerist who conspires to sell a dead body at Art Basel Miami. Portman heaped praise upon her younger co-star.\n\n\t“She’s such a fucking great actress and so knowledgeable about film,” Portman said of Ortega. “She’s so on and in it. It is rare. I think you’re very focused and in tune with everything. You’re not there to mess around.”\n\n\tPortman went on to call Yan “a brilliant leader,” adding: “She has a specificity of vision. All the work ahead of time and her precise leadership leads to the possibility of spontaneity. Balancing this very specific tone that is satirical but also true emotion in it, which is almost impossible to create, she knew how to do it and guide us to it.”\n\t\n\n\tWith “The Gallerist” being one of Sundance’s biggest movies from a woman director and the premiere taking place just a few days after the Oscar nominations, Portman also took a moment during the interview to call out the Academy for snubbing a handful of female-directed movies this year. While Chloe Zhao’s “Hamnet” scored 8 nominations, including best picture and best director, many other movies directed by women were shut out.\n\n\t“So many of the best films I saw this year were made by women,” Portman said. “You just see the barriers at every level because so many were not recognized at awards time. Between ‘Sorry Baby’ and ‘Left-Handed Girl’ and ‘Hedda’ and ‘The Testament of Ann Lee’… Extraordinary films this year that I think a lot of people are enjoying and loving, but are not getting the accolades they deserve.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRob Lowe has been vocal about his disdain for the fact that film and television production has been leaving Los Angeles in favor of other, more financially affordable cities. Although the actor says the state of filming in Hollywood is “getting better,” Lowe feels it’s “still criminal that we’ve ceded this entire industry to other states; other countries.”\n\n\t“This is going to sound incredibly self-serving, but a large part of the budget for tax credit is above the line,” Lowe says, referring to the salaries of actors, writers, directors and producers. “All of these other territories give you credit for above the line, and L.A. doesn’t. Until they do that, they’re never going to get any of the big shows back.”\n\t\n\n\tDue to new tax incentives for independent features, Lowe was able to stay in Los Angeles to shoot his latest movie, “The Musical,” which premieres at the Sundance Film Festival on Sunday. Directed by Giselle Bonilla and written by Alexander Heller, the zany comedy follows a frustrated playwright and middle school teacher named Doug (Tony-winner Will Brill) who discovers that his ex-girlfriend (“Community” star Gillian Jacobs), a fellow educator, has started dating the principal of the school (Lowe) where they all work. Driven by spite, Doug stages a wildly inappropriate school musical in an effort to ruin the principal’s chances of winning a prestigious award for academic excellence.\n\n\t“We thought a lot about ‘School of Rock’ if it were filmed like ‘Apocalypse Now.’ That guided us for a long time,” Heller said at the Variety Studio presented by Audible. \n\t\n\n\tThere’s an adage in Hollywood: Never work with children or animals. “The Musical” cast pushed back on that notion, with Brill calling the inclusion of several young actors one of “the most audacious” aspects of the film. Added Lowe, “Most of us were kid actors ourselves and have experienced what the kids experience in the film of not getting the part [in the musical] that they’d like; I never made it out of the chorus. So getting to be around kids, when we were once those kids, is really fun and satisfying.”\n\n\tIn line with the theme of “The Musical” — being motivated by spite — the cast and creative team thought about the pettiest thing they’ve ever done or had happen to them.\n\n\t“The list is long,” said Lowe, before bringing up a time he was accepting a trophy at an award ceremony. “There was a particular actor behind me who was trying to take off the bra strap of the other actress, grabbagging and pulling focus from my speech. I didn’t like it.” Lowe continued, “By the way, there’s no group pettier than actors, so it’s not surprising.”\n\n\tAlthough he didn’t specify the incident, there’s a grainy YouTube video that seems to fit the description with Lowe accepting the drama ensemble prize at the 2002 SAG Awards on behalf of “The West Wing.” In the background, his co-star Bradley Whitford appears to be teasing and toying with Allison Janney, who then starts to giggle while Lowe is speaking at the podium.\n\n\n\n\n\tAs for Bonilla, an occasion where she admits she was the perpetrator of some pettiness ended up having an outsized (positive!) influence on her career.\n\n\t“My high school boyfriend cheated on me with a mediocre film student who didn’t get into NYU. I submitted out of spite, and it’s the only film school I got into,” Bonilla said. “So that is why I stand before you today.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tStuart Ford, chairman and CEO of AGC Studios, is film industry veteran who has seen the independent sector rise to incredible heights. And in recent years he has watched it struggle.\n\n\tOn the latest episode of Variety‘s “Strictly Business” podcast, Ford goes deep on the issues that the indie film sector faces at a time of shifting financial models for production and major changes in moviegoing habits, particularly among younger audiences. \n\t\n\n\tBut Ford’s AGC Studios banner has maintained a busy slate of indie-produced theatrical releases. His company provides a patchwork quilt of services to creative talent, from financing to physical production to distribution. AGC headed to the Sundance Film Festival this year with a family title, “Fing!” starring Taika Waititi that premiered in the festival’s Family Matinee section.\n\n\n\t“We’re lucky in as much as we have both a self-financing and a sales capability within AGC Studios. We are one of the privileged few in the independent sector that to some extent can drive our own projects into production,” Ford says. “That’s not to say we have carte blanche to do it. Obviously, there are financial parameters and creative parameters that we have to pay very, very close attention to. We really live in the space that’s been largely abdicated by the major studios, which is making intelligent films for adults for the most part, usually via established filmmakers and established filmmaker relationships, but always, hopefully with commercial potential at the end of the rainbow.”\n\n\tFord emphasizes that there is opportunity for original material on the big screen that has a targeted market and accessible to more than arthouse lovers.\n\t\n\n\t“I think that is really where the independent film sector is going to continue to find success and continue to find a role within the broader ecosystem, which is by creating films that have an identity that audiences can discover,” Ford says.\n\n\tThe challenges around moviegoing in the post-COVID era have also coincided with a steep drop in the fees paid by networks and streamers around the world in the so-called Pay 1 window, aka the first TV exposure for a title. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStuart Ford (Photo by Pierre Suu/Variety via Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariety via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Contrary to popular belief that independent film is dead, I think it’s far from dead. I do think to some extent it is shedding its old skin and moving into the next incarnation, if you like. But there’s a number of economic and financing realities that no amount of rose tinted lenses can can ignore.  Production costs have gone up significantly in recent years, both because of cost of goods and services, and because, the streamers drove up those production costs. Whilst for independents, revenue streams have remained stagnant. So we’ve had the unholy situation of budget inflation meeting buyer conservatism,” Ford says. \n\n\t“Financing structures have had to become more complex. Obviously, we still have soft money and regional incentives. There’s still bank financing available for pre-sales, but as pre-sales have become tougher to obtain, financiers are having to lean more heavily on gap financing, which can be expensive money and take more equity risk. So that increased cost of capital and risk exposure is deterring a lot of capital from coming into the marketplace right now, and we have to address that.”\n\n\tFord made his name as a top international buyer for Miramax Films in its heyday and then went on to launch IM Global. AGC Studios was formed seven years ago and has navigated the choppy waters in part by expanded into television, both scripted and unscripted. \n\n\t“We’re very prolific. We made five or six films last year. We’re going into production on three films in the first quarter of this year,” he says. “It still works for the right projects that are constructed in the right way. But the bullseye definitely got smaller and I think the risk is currently front-loaded onto producers and financiers more than it should be.”\n\t\n\n\tFord has a clear idea of what it will take to rehabilitate the independent film sector that is so vital for the creative community in Hollywood, New York and beyond.\n\n\t“The whole independent sector could light up very quickly if we could somehow get to a place where streamers are paying more meaningful license fees for that Pay 1 window post theatrical,” Ford says. “It is the decline in appetite of the streamers for those films — or certainly decline in appetite to pay — what I would say are market-rate license fees that has caused the slowdown in U.S.”\n\n\t(Pictured: Taika Waititi in ‘Fing!’)\n\n\t“Strictly Business” is Variety’s weekly podcast featuring conversations with industry leaders about the business of media and entertainment.

    "body": "\n\tA party crasher was arrested at Park City’s High West Saloon on Friday during CAA‘s Sundance Film Festival celebration. \n\n\tA source at the talent agency’s party said the man, who is Caucasian, was involved in a racially charged incident that took place at the eatery’s restroom. He apparently shocked other people in the bathroom by talking about how proud he was to be “white.” He then allegedly punched a person of color in the face after he left the facilities. Security detained the man, who has not been identified, and police later took him into custody. Although the incident was described as “disturbing,” some guests were apparently unaware of what had transpired.\n\t\n\n\tAfter the incident was reported on Saturday, Congressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a Florida Democrat, posted on X that he was the victim of the alleged assault. “Last night, I was assaulted by a man at Sundance Festival who told me that Trump was going to deport me before he punched me in the face,” he wrote. “He was heard screaming racist remarks as he drunkenly ran off. The individual was arrested and I am okay.”\n\n\nLast night, I was assaulted by a man at Sundance Festival who told me that Trump was going to deport me before he punched me in the face.

The source tells Variety that the man was not on any guest list and is believed to have snuck into the gathering. The Summit County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for information about whether or not the man had been released from jail.\n\t\n\n\tCAA is a major presence at Sundance, both because many of its clients’ projects premiere at the festival and because it is enlisted to help find distribution for some of the indie films that debut in Park City. \n\n\tThis year’s Sundance is the last one to be held at Park City. It will move to Colorado in 2027. Though the festival is a celebration of independent film, it is also the setting of wild premieres and house parties, some of which have led to police actions in the past. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe NBA has postponed a game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Golden State Warriors after a man was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.\n\n\t“The National Basketball Association game scheduled for today between the Golden State Warriors and Minnesota Timberwolves at Target Center has been postponed,” read a statement posted on the Minnesota Timberwolves’ Instagram page. “The decision was made to prioritize the safety and security of the Minneapolis community.”\n\t\n\n\tThe game, originally set for air Saturday on ABC, was pushed to Sunday at 4:30 p.m. CT and will debut on NBA TV.\n\n\n\tMinnesota residents have been locked in days-long protests against the presence of ICE agents in the state. A nationwide crackdown on immigration has been a focal point of Donald Trump’s second term.\n\n\tMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz has repeatedly condemned the presence of ICE in his state. Today, he told the New York Times of the incident, “They killed a man, created chaos, pushed down protesters, threw gas indiscriminately and then we’re left to clean up.”\n\n\tIn a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump was quick to blame Gov. Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Fey for the chaos, claiming that they are “inciting insurrection” to distract from the state’s recent social service fraud investigation.\n\n\t“The Mayor and the Governor are inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric,” he wrote. “Instead, these sanctimonious political fools should be looking for the Billions of Dollars that has been stolen from the people of Minnesota, and the United States of America. LET OUR ICE PATRIOTS DO THEIR JOB!”\n",

    "description": "\n\t“Barney & Friends,” the perennially beloved children’s TV program, made its first appearance on PBS in 1992, and from virtually the moment it arrive",
    "body": "\n\t“Barney & Friends,” the perennially beloved children’s TV program, made its first appearance on PBS in 1992, and from virtually the moment it arrived it was the kiddie show that launched a thousand misanthropic sick jokes. At the center of every joke was the same idea: that Barney, the big fuzzy purple dinosaur with the doofy voice and the message of love, was a character worthy of your contempt. He was too cuddly, too wholesome, too saccharine, too hideously adorable. He was such an insufferable mascot of synthetic affection that, in line with the jokes, he deserved a fate worse than death.\n\t\n\n\tThere was always something a bit kinky about Barney. I thought the funniest thing about him is that he had bedroom eyes; they seemed to peer out at the world with a little too much love. (That’s part of his weird accidental creep factor.) But the real point is that Barney has been a punchline for hipsters nearly as long as he’s been around. (“Death to Smoochy,” the Robin Williams comedy that took off on this sentiment, came out 24 years ago, in 2002.) So “Buddy,” a fairy-tale satire of “Barney & Friends” in which the central joke is that the Barney character is actually a vicious killer, feels like it’s arriving a bit late to the “We hate Barney!” party.\n\n\n\tAs a piece of satirical world-building, “Buddy” is exquisitely designed and executed. The movie was directed and co-written by Casper Kelly, the co-creator of Adult Swim who is best known for his cult short “Too Many Cooks,” a brilliantly unhinged take-off on ’70s and ’80s TV that’s ZAZ-level in its uproarious appreciation of how television makes even the worst things nice. “Too Many Cooks” crammed the entire cosmos of network TV into 11 minutes. In “Buddy,” Kelly tries for something comparable, expanding the joke of a take-off on “Barney” into a dream-kitsch satirical fantasy. The movie works, and has a handful of inspired touches, yet a little of it goes a long way.\n\t\n\n\tThe opening half hour is a straight-up “Barney” spoof, and in its way it’s perfectly done. Buddy, the children’s mascot, is a big fuzzy orange unicorn with a kerchief and a yellow mane and a purple heart on his chest and a voice (supplied by Keegan-Michael Key) that nails that nasal Barney geekiness, right down to the way he emits a reflexive chuckle at his own jokes. (It’s worth noting how that chuckle, and much else about “Barney,” was lifted from “Pee-wee’s Playhouse,” only shorn of all irony and bite.) Kelly ingeniously recreates the outdoor-set-as-PBS-studio-bubble effect, giving Buddy a theme song to the tune of “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” (“You love Buddy, yes you do…”), as well as innocuous background music that punctuates everything, anthropomorphic characters like Mr. Mailbox and the Worry Well and Strappy the backpack, educational songs like “You Gotta Be Scared to Be Brave,” along with a dash of ridiculously wholesome ’90s hip-hop. The kids, of course, are all saints…except for Josh, who refuses Buddy’s invitation to dance. That’s where the trouble begins.\n\n\tThe camp hatred of Barney is really a leftover 1960s counterculture jape. Too sweet to be true, he is seen as a corporate fake marketed to children by The Man. Therefore, the notion that Barney has a secret aggressive side is a kind of Freudian potshot, an insistence that there’s an ugly violence he must be repressing. I always kind of felt that way about Barney — at least, until I had kids of my own and started watching “Barney” with them (especially the wild direct-to-video “Barney In Outer Space”), and I saw that the rap on “Barney” was actually a bit much. I don’t think it’s a show that’s too squeaky-good; today’s kids have more than enough time ahead to channel-surf depravity. But “Buddy” serves up the idea of Barney as homicidal maniac with a demented gusto, in part by keeping it within the pasteboard-and-fuzzy-fur texture of the show. By the end of that first half hour, he has been unmasked as the bloody avenger of the backyard.\n\n\tBut Casper Kelly is just getting started. “Buddy” then leaps into the suburbs, telling the story of a sitcom-worthy family, led by Topher Grace and Cristin Milioti as the parents. Now it’s Milioti’s character who starts to become unhinged, as she conjures the idea that she had a ghost child and then, seeing a “Buddy” episode, gets pulled into the TV set, and another dimension, like something out of “Poltergeist.” This is where Kelly’s pop-culture omnivorousness begins to make itself felt. He turns “Buddy” into a genre mash-up that takes off on everything from slasher movies (“That’s all the time we have!” says Buddy after half his face gets singed off like Freddy Krueger) to Little Red Riding Hood’s journey into the woods to “The Wizard of Oz” to the arrival of a singing cowboy (Clint Cowboy) and his Howdy Doody puppet pal to the id of Buddy laid bare…as a black-demon-skeleton version of Godzilla!\n\t\n\n\tFor all that, I got more mild chuckles than big laughs out of “Buddy,” and I glanced at my watch a couple of times, because this kind of conceptual satire doesn’t always have the narrative propulsion a movie needs. Yet Casper Kelly is a talent to watch. In “Buddy,” he’s essentially reviving an old joke and doing multiple variations on it. But he has a gleefully rich understanding of the inner insanity that can drive pop culture. “Buddy” is, at heart, a surrealist contradiction, a hate letter made with love.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmber Heard makes an unexpected appearance in a timely new documentary premiering at the Sundance Film Festival, about accused men weaponizing defamation lawsuits to silence women speaking out about abuse.\n\n\t“Silenced,” playing in the world cinema category at the annual festival, bowed on Saturday afternoon from director Selina Miles and international human rights lawyer Jennifer Robinson. The film follows numerous women, including a journalist, who were impeded in their search for justice thanks to nine-figure defamation suits.\n\t\n\n\tRobinson assisted Heard in her participation in a 2018 lawsuit filed by Heard’s ex-husband Johnny Depp, against British newspaper The Sun. The paper ran a story criticizing Depp’s casting in the Warner Bros. “Fantastic Beasts” film franchise, citing accusations of domestic violence brought by Heard. Depp sued the paper for libel and Heard was crucial to the publication’s defense.\n\n\tHeard agreed to sit for an interview in “Silenced,” the first film she’s appeared in since 2023’s “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.” The actress was clear about her motives in joining the production.\n\n\t“This is not about me. I have lost my ability to speak. I am not here to tell my story. I don’t want to tell my story. In fact, I don’t want to use my voice anymore. That’s the problem,” Heard said bluntly, sitting for a confessional chat with Miles.\n\n\tHeard is joined by subjects include: Brittany Higgins, a political staffer who brought a rape allegation against a superior in Australian parliament; Catalina Ruiz-Navarro, the editor of Latin American magazine Volcánica, who was sued by director Ciro Guerra after publishing serial allegations of misconduct against him; and Sibongile Ndashe, a human rights attorney.\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking at the Variety Studio presented by Audible at Sundance, Robinson warned of the “chilling effect” defamation suits have had on the ability of women to come forward, let alone have their day in court.\n\n\t“In the post-#MeToo world, we saw women break the cultural silence, speaking out publicly about gender-based violence. What we then saw is their alleged perpetrator bringing a defamation claim saying, ‘This is not true, it’s defamatory, and I’m going to sue you for a lot of money.’’ Robison said.\n\n\tThe attorney said she’s advised many a client that “he can sue you, you just then have to prove it in court. But it’s very expensive to do so, and it bankrupts most women. The question I ask in this film is, ‘What does free speech mean if you can’t afford to defend it?’”\n\n\tHeard said her involvement in the Depp v. The Sun case was a Catch 22.\n\n\t“The outcome of that trial depended on my participation, and I depended on the outcome of that trial. When I first met [Robinson], I immediately got the sense that she got the bigger picture. What has happened to me is an amplified version of what a lot of women live through,” said Heard.\n\n\tFor the duration of The Sun trial, the film depicts Heard as the subject of public scorn. Depp fans, several dressed as Capt. Jack Sparrow from Disney’s “Pirates of the Caribbean,” hurled expletives and threw trash at Heard as she entered and exited court each day.\n\n\t“I remember at the close of the trial, the idea that I could say something to the press came up. [Robinson] asked if I was sure about that. [I thought], ‘If they throw things at me, it will make this point more obvious.’ I didn’t understand it could get so much worse for me as a woman, using my voice,” she continued.\n\n\tHeard, who has moved on to a career in theater, ended on a hopeful note.\n\n\t“It gives me strength seeing other people take on the fight. Women brave enough to address the imbalance of power. Looking at my daughter’s face as she grows up and slowly starts to walk into this world… I believe it can be better.”\n\n\t“Silenced’ is currently seeking distribution.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNatasha Lyonne took to X on Friday to reveal she has relapsed. The “Poker Face” star struggled with addiction to drugs and alcohol throughout the 2000s.\n\n\t“Took my relapse public more to come,” she wrote Friday night. Hours later, in a follow-up post, she added, “Recovery is a lifelong process. Anyone out there struggling, remember you’re not alone. Grateful for love & smart feet. Gonna do it for baby Bambo. Stay honest, folks. Sick as our secrets. If no one told ya today, I love you. No matter how far down the scales we have gone, we will see how our experience may help another. Keep going, kiddos. Don’t quit before the miracle. Wallpaper your mind with love. Rest is all noise & baloney.”\n\t\n\n\t“Baby Bambo” is a reference to Lyonne’s upcoming film about a New York boxing promoter struggling to balance his obligations as a father with his career. Lyonne serves as writer and director for the film, titled “Bambo.” \n\n\n\tIn response to a fan supporting her’s openness, Lyonne wrote, “We need better systems and to end shame – bill the sacklers & stilettos or something but don’t @ me for getting honest.”\n\n\tLyonne discussed her addiction in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly, saying at the time she was “wary” about publicly acknowledging her substance abuse problem.\n\n\t“It’s weird to talk about. I was definitely as good as dead, you know? A lot of people don’t come back,” Lyonne said. “That makes me feel wary, and self-conscious. I wouldn’t want to feel prideful about it. People really rallied around me and pulled me up by my fucking bootstraps.”\n",

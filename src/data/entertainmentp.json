    "body": "\n\tJames Gunn looks tired but energized as he settles into his chair for the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast, having just flown in from Atlanta. He’s already into pre-production on “Man of Tomorrow,” the follow-up to this summer’s “Superman.” so exhaustion would be expected. Gunn is not only directing the film, but he’s also running DC Studios alongside Peter Safran — an unprecedented balancing act he calls “the hardest movie I’ve ever made.”\n\t\n\n\tThe conversation is taking place only two hours before the entertainment landscape shifted, with Netflix announcing an $82 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. — a reminder of how quickly the ground beneath the Hollywood industry, DC, and Gunn himself, continues to move.\n\n\n\tNonetheless, we’re talking about “Superman,” where Gunn leans in, his eyes brighten and discusses what drew him to the character — which wasn’t the scale or mythology.\n\n\n\t“When I first talked to the cast and crew, I wanted to make something about goodness,” Gunn says. “This guy isn’t perfect, even though he’s Superman. He’s really just trying to do his best. He’s good-natured. He’s loving. He sees the best in everyone.”\n\n\tThat idea was Superman is not a god, but a sincere, sometimes awkward moral presence. That became Gunn’s anchor — and he credits Grant Morrison’s “All-Star Superman” for crystallizing that approach. “That was the thing that hooked me,” he shares. “That big lug of a superhero being genuinely kind. That’s what I took from the book.”\n\n\tUnlike the relative freedom Gunn had with “Guardians of the Galaxy,” Superman came with a century’s worth of expectations, and of course, disagreements. “Everyone in the world thinks something different about Superman. Everybody knows who he is.”\n\t\n\n\tThe scrutiny extended beyond the cape. Gunn was aware that this film would be viewed as a referendum on the future of DC itself. “There were all the eyes on us — on DC, on the DCU, on everything,” he says. “That pressure was real.”\n\n\tCasting, then, was non-negotiable. “If I couldn’t find Superman, I wasn’t going to make the movie,” Gunn says flatly. David Corenswet was the second audition he saw. “I remember thinking, ‘If that’s the worst we do, we’re in great shape.’”\n\n\tWhat emerged is a film that leans toward optimism at a moment when superhero cinema has often favored grit. Gunn’s Superman isn’t naïve, but he is hopeful. Coming off the year we all had, that choice feels quite radical.\n\n\tOn this episode of the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast, Gunn talks about his process of making “Superman,” why he’ll never chase a prestige projects and what to expect from “Man of Tomorrow.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tScreengrab courtesy of DC Studios\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRead excerpts from her interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n\tWhat made “Superman” the hardest film you’ve directed?\n\n\tThis was the hardest movie I’ve ever made. The next hardest was probably the first “Guardians.” With “Guardians,” you were building a corner of the universe that felt completely different from everything else Marvel was doing at the time. Here, I was reorienting something everyone already thinks they understand. Strangely, it’s the most comic-book-driven thing I’ve ever done. More than any of my other superhero films.\n\n\tHow did assembling your creative team shape the film?\n\n\tI’ve worked with many of these people for years. Beth Mickel, my production designer, has been with me on the last three films. Steph Ceretti has overseen visual effects for multiple projects now. Being in charge of DC meant I could finally keep the team together instead of losing people between films. That continuity matters.\n\n\tWhat were you most proud of in the visual effects, especially with Krypto the Dog?\n\n\tFramestore’s work on Krypto is extraordinary. I’ll put those shots up against anything I’ve ever seen. ILM was incredible as well. It was just a world-class group of artists working at the highest level.\n\n\tHow does it feel to be both a filmmaker and a studio head at the same time?\n\t\n\n\tI don’t think it’s ever really been done. Even Walt Disney was more of a producer than a director. It’s an experiment. And yes, sometimes it probably sounds like madness — especially since I don’t make the most conventional films. But I love big spectacle. That’s my jam. I originally said no to the job. I didn’t want to do what Kevin Feige does. But once Peter and I realized we’d be doing it together, it became exciting. I still don’t know if it’s sustainable long-term. It’s a lot. There just aren’t enough hours in the day.\n\n\tWhat films made you fall in love with movies?\n\n\tI think the first movie I saw in a theater was “The Aristocats.” Then “The Strongest Man in the World” with Kurt Russell. But it was “Star Wars” that completely changed me. That feeling of entering another world. And then “Raiders of the Lost Ark” made me aware of filmmakers themselves — George Lucas, Steven Spielberg. That’s when it clicked.\n\n\tHow do you think about prestige versus mainstream filmmaking?\n\n\tI don’t care about prestige. I mean, sure, would it be cool to be nominated for Best Director or something? Yeah, would I rather have that than not? But it’s not really my concern. Occasionally I have ideas that are more independent movies, but I like making the kind of movies that I make, and I like making pop cinema, for lack of a better term. If I can have those things also be something that are emotionally resonant to people, or affect people in a deeper, more spiritual way, like a lot of people have told me that “Superman” did, a lot of people have told me that “Guardians 3” did, then that’s fantastic. That’s what I would love to be able to do. But I like making the big movies too. There’s an artistry to it, the creative flow. But then I also like the part of it that’s putting the big puzzle together and creating this machine that works for an audience to elicit a reaction from them, whether it’s emotional, whether it’s laughter, whether it’s screaming, whether it’s whatever it is. That’s the fun part of it.\n\n\tWhy did “Guardians of the Galaxy” feel like the right leap into big-budget filmmaking?\n\n\tI had walked away from another studio project because they stripped everything personal out of it. Then “Guardians” came along and I thought, no one else can make this movie the way I can. I wanted to make a space opera. I love raccoons. It felt completely me. That’s always been my goal — to make big movies that still feel personal.\n\t\n\n\tWhat can you tell us about “Man of Tomorrow?”\n\n\tAt its core, it’s about Clark and Lex. I relate to both of them. I relate to Lex’s ambition and obsession — minus the murder. And I relate to Superman’s belief in people, his Midwestern values. They’re two sides of me. \n\n\tWhat does your partnership with Peter Safran bring to DC Studios?\n\n\tPeter’s the best. He does everything I don’t do well. He keeps the ship steady, keeps everyone aligned, connects us with Jim Lee and the comics side, and unifies departments that used to operate separately. What we share is a genuine love for these characters. We know what a privilege it is to help shape how people see them now — and that responsibility is something we take seriously.\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

    "body": "\n\tChevy Chase recently took part in a joint interview with The New York Times alongside Marina Zenovich, the director of the new CNN documentary “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not,” and was asked about how the film depicts Chase’s tumultuous stint on “Community.” Chase had a series regular role on the NBC sitcom and exited after Season 4 amid a public spat with creator Dan Harmon over creative differences and an incident in which he allegedly said the N-word on set.\n\t\n\n\t“It wasn’t a bad experience. I just didn’t think it was that good, the show,” Chase told The Times about the series. \n\n\n\tWhen asked how he felt about his role ending, Chase answered: “I thought it ended great.”\n\n\t“It was too great a misunderstanding of what I was saying and not saying,” Chase then added about his exit. “I thought that there was at least one person — and another who, for some ungodly reason, didn’t get me, didn’t know who I was, or didn’t realize for one second I’m not racist. They were too young to be aware of my work. Instead, there was some sort of visceral reaction from them.”\n\n\tAs recounted in the documentary and by The Times: “During production of Season 4, Chase became frustrated with his character’s increasing bigotry, in particular with a story line in which the character does a bit with a blackface hand puppet. The documentary recounts allegations that Chase, in frustration, asked whether his character would next be made to use a racial slur, and reportedly uttered that slur in reference. He abruptly exited the show.”\n\n\t“Community” director Jay Chandrasekhar is interviewed in the documentary and says Chase had a “meltdown” on set after an incident, in which he allegedly used the N-word on set, leaked to the press. The alleged incident occurred between Chase and co-star Yvette Nicole Brown, with Chandrasekhar explaining: “I know that there was a history between [Chevy and Yvette] around race, and she got up and stormed out of there. Chevy storms off, so the producer is like, ‘We need Yvette in the scene, right?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, she’s in the next scene.’ And he goes, ‘Well, she won’t come out unless Chevy apologizes to her.’”\n\t\n\n\tChandrasekhar said Chevy eventually returned to the set but claimed he “didn’t say anything” to upset Brown, adding: “[Chevy] goes, ‘You know, me and Richard Pryor, I used to call Richard Pryor the N-word, and he used to call me The Honky, and we loved each other.’ And I’m like, ‘I know, man, I love that bit.’ I said, ‘You know, can we just have a little apology?’ He goes, ‘For what?’”\n\n\tThe incident was later reported on by The Hollywood Reporter, who claimed Chase was “frustrated” with his character arc and used the N-word “when questioning the dialogue.” The report stressed that Chase did not use the racial slur directly at his Black co-stars Brown and Donald Glover, although both actors were reportedly on set at the time.\n\n\tChandrasekhar said that when production resumed after the THR story broke, Chase arrived on set and had a “full meltdown” as he came “storming onto the set, and he goes, ‘Who fucked me over?’ … My career is ruined! I’m ruined!’ Like, it’s a full meltdown. ‘Fuck all of you!’ And I’m like, ‘Alright, let’s shoot the scene.’ He never ended up coming back after that.”\n\n\tZenovich previously told Variety that she tried to get more of Chase’s “Community” cast members and crew members to participate in the documentary, but “every single person said no” because “there are things people don’t want to talk about.”\n\n\tAs the “Community” incident resurfaced due to “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not,” Yvette Nicole Brown took to Instagram and appeared to address it by writing: “There are things I’ve never spoken of publicly and perhaps never will. Anyone currently speaking FOR or ABOUT me with perceived authority is speaking without EVER speaking to me about the things they claim to know about. They actually don’t really know me at all.”\n\n\tDonald Glover notably told The New Yorker in 2018 that Chase repeatedly made racist jokes on the “Community” set. Chase, meanwhile, told CBS Sunday Morning in 2022 that he “doesn’t give a crap” about headlines and former co-stars painting him as problematic on set, adding at the time: “I don’t give a crap. I am who I am. And I like who I am. I don’t care. And it’s part of me that I don’t care. And I’ve thought about that a lot. And I don’t know what to tell you, man. I just don’t care.”\n\t\n\n\tHead over to The New York Times’ website to read Chase’s latest interview in its entirety.\n",

Overall streams of Prince‘s catalog have climbed 190 percent, with an 88 percent uptick in Gen Z streams.\n\t\n\n\t“When Doves Cry” and “Purple Rain” were featured at pivotal moments in the finale. When the “Stranger Things” heroes set the explosives to destroy the Upside Down for once and for all, they put on Side Two of “Purple Rain,” which starts with “When Doves Cry” and ends with the title track. It’s “Purple Rain” that’s playing as Eleven (Millie Bobbie Brown) appears to sacrifice herself when she brings Mike (Finn Wolfhard) into her mind to say a final goodbye.\n\n\n\tNotably, the two songs have not been used in a TV series since Prince included them on the soundtrack for his 1984 film “Purple Rain.” “We were told that it was a real long shot, so we just crossed our fingers,” series creator Matt Duffer told Tudum following the finale premiere.\n\n\tCo-creator Ross Duffer said that they had “never talked about a song choice as much as we did for that moment. What is also very exciting about it is it just has not been used. [Prince’s] estate does not generally allow that song to be licensed outside of the ‘Purple Rain’ movie.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tThe life of a popular “Real Housewife” is going under the microscope with TLC‘s new docuseries, “The Cult of the Real Housewife,” which takes a look into the controversial marriage and religious practices of “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” star, Mary Cosby.\n\n\tThe new series premiered Jan. 1 on TLC and the three episodes are airing throughout the week on the cable channel right now. Don’t have cable? You can livestream the show as it airs on TLC with a free trial to DirecTV. Use the free trial to watch the new Mary Cosby doc online for free. Viewers can also stream the docuseries on HBO Max and discovery+. \n\n\n\tYou can also watch “The Cult of the Real Housewife” through Philo, a streaming service that includes 70+ live television channels — including TLC — plus access to HBO Max, discovery+ and AMC+. Regularly $33/month, Philo’s current New Year’s deal has your introductory month of service discounted to just $25.\n\n\tCosby has been a breakout star on “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” beloved by fans for her candid comments and witty retorts, many of which have become popular reaction memes online. But the 53-year-old Pentecostal preacher has also raised eyebrows on the show with her church’s unconventional practices, and her controversial marriage to her step-grandfather. TLC says the new series “unpacks the allegations behind the headlines and reveals the darker and more unsettling truth.”\n\n\t“The Cult of the Real Housewife” features archival footage of sermons delivered by Cosby and husband Robert Cosby Sr., along with new interviews with longtime church members, Cosby’s sister and her cousin. The docuseries also promises to “elevate the voices of ex-congregants speaking out for the first time,” while also featuring a “leading cult expert who can offer insight around a playbook designed to enforce loyalty in mind-control cults.”\n\n\n\tThe topic of whether or not Cosby was a cult leader was briefly brought up by cast members in earlier seasons of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” but the TV star sidestepped any allegations on the reality show and is seemingly friendly with the cast. An episode of the current season of “RHOSLC” even found the women attending a worship service at Cosby’s Faith Temple Pentecostal Church.\n\n\tPer a press release, the new unauthorized Cosby docuseries, “Traces the dramatic rise of Faith Temple from its founding by the beloved Rosemary ‘Mama’ Cosby, grandmother of Mary Cosby, to her passing, the controversial transfer of leadership, and her husband’s marriage to Mary. This hotly contested bequeathment pushed Faith Temple into a controversial, new era.” The TLC doc also “pulls back the salacious headlines and social media takes to dive deeper and unpack one of the most enduring mysteries at the core of the scandal: how have Mary and Robert Cosby Sr. managed to avoid accountability for so long?”\n\n\n\tCosby hasn’t addressed any of the allegations in the doc, and her last Instagram post was a cheerful 2025 recap. Still, the reality star has turned off comments on her page since the documentary premiered this week.\n\n\tWatch “The Cult of the Real Housewife” online for free with DirecTV or stream it live or on-demand with a discounted subscription to Philo here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNot everyone is happy about George Clooney and his family becoming French citizens. The recent news of Clooney, his wife Amal and their children being granted French citizenship sparked criticism from Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a junior deputy to the interior minister, who argued in a radio interview on Franceinfo that it raised an “issue of fairness.”\n\n\tVedrenne suggested that Clooney had been granted French citizenship due to his fame rather than on merit, and she argued “this is not the right message to send.” She also said she felt that it showed some ”double standards” and added that she will verify “the entire procedure,” according to Le Monde newspaper. But shortly after Vedrenne’s comments, the interior minister Laurent Nuñez fought back the accusations of Vedrenne — with whom he works closely — saying that Clooney and his wife Amal were naturalized “by decree,” from a “decision of the public authority.” Nunez also said Clooney’s naturalization was “a great chance for our country.”\n\t\n\n\tThe ministry of foreign affairs also reacted to the bashing over Clooney, arguing that the government “followed a rigorous procedure ranging from security checks to regulatory naturalization interviews at the prefecture, including the payment of tax stamps.”\n\n\t“Like many French people, we are delighted to welcome George and Amal Clooney to the national community,” said the ministry, who cited the civic code which allows “any foreigner … who contributes through their distinguished actions to the influence of France and the prosperity of its international economic relations” to gain access to French citizenship.\n\t\n\n\tClooney, who lives in Brignoles in the South of France with his family, recently joked while promoting Netflix’s “Jay Kelly” on the local pay TV channel Canal+ that his French was “horrible.” He said his wife and kids, meanwhile, speak French fluently. “They speak French in front of me so that they can say terrible things about me to my face, and I don’t know,” he said. Clooney previously told the French radio RTL in an interview in December, “I love the French culture, your language, even if I’m still bad at it after 400 days of courses.”\n\n\tU.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, took the opportunity to mock Clooney after the news of his citizenship. “Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration,” Trump said on Truth Social.\n\n\tHowever, Clooney is already in the midst of contributing to the French entertainment industry by filming a cameo in the “Call My Agent!” movie spinoff, which is produced by Mediawan for Netflix. \n",

    "body": "\n\tVictoria Jones, the daughter of Tommy Lee Jones who acted and appeared with her father in two of his films, was found dead at a San Francisco hotel on Thursday, Jan. 1, according to NBC Bay Area. She was 34.\n\n\tThe San Francisco Fire Department released a statement to media outlets saying that paramedics were called to the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco at 2:52 a.m on New Year’s Day.\n\n\t“Our units responded to the scene, performed an assessment and declared one person deceased,” a spokesperson said. A cause of death is not yet known.\n\t\n\n\t“We are deeply saddened by an incident that occurred at the hotel on January 1, 2026,” the Fairmont Hotel said in a statement to NBC Bay Area. “Our heartfelt condolences are with the family and loved ones during this very difficult time. The hotel team is actively cooperating and supporting police authorities within the framework of the ongoing investigation.”\n\n\tVictoria acted as a child opposite her father in “Men in Black II” in 2002 and “The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada” in 2005. The latter was Tommy Lee Jones’ directorial debut, in which he also starred. She also appeared in the 2005 film “Sorry, Haters,” an episode of “One Tree Hill” and the 2014 film “The Homesman” as an adult.\n\n\tVictoria accompanied her father to several movie premieres and red carpets during his career. Tommy Lee Jones became an Oscar winner in 1994 for “The Fugitive” and most recently appeared in “The Burial” and “Finestkind” in 2023.\n\n\tVariety has reached out to Tommy Lee Jones’ representative. Victoria was the second child of Tommy Lee Jones and his second wife, Kimberlea Cloughley.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs the year comes to a close, many standout actors have garnered attention. Of course, only a select few will continue on to Oscar glory — 20 to be exact. But there are many notable performances that, while well-received, have yet to be recognized by top awards associations. Here, we make a case for 12 actors who deserve consideration.Will ArnettIs This Thing On?Arnett gets to flex his dramatic muscles in Bradley Cooper’s comedy-drama. As his marriage to Tess (Laura Dern) crumbles, Alex (Arnett) finds a creative and psychological outlet in stand-up comedy. While we expect Arnett to nail the comedy bits, he’s loving, confused, hurt and defiant in a scene with Dern in his bachelor pad. He has an old photo of Tess in her heyday on the volleyball court blown up and framed, but the angle is from behind. He says it shows their sons what a badass their mom is; she explodes because it doesn’t show her face. The scene encapsulates all the issues in their marriage and both play it with heartbreaking poignancy.Miles CatonSinnersDirector Ryan Coogler describes Caton as an “once-in-a-lifetime voice,” and he’s not wrong. It’s certainly impressive when Caton, who plays the preacher’s son, Sammie, in “Sinners,” teases his vocals in the back of a car ride, but when he steps on stage for a big musical number, his singing blows the roof off the joint. Literally! It’s a memorable and captivating debut performance with Caton showing off his singing and acting chops.Oona ChaplinAvatar: Fire and Ash“Game of Thrones” alum Oona Chaplin is Pandora’s newest villain, Varang, the main antagonist leading the Ash people in James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Chaplin’s Varang is fiery and thrilling to watch. She’s a highlight of the film — certainly with her powerful physicality, flashing eyes and stunning headdress, it’s hard to take your eyes off her. Varang is terrifying, but her drive to save her people makes her a hero. And maybe, Varang isn’t the bad guy after all. Hopefully, the next installment gives Varang and Chaplin more time to shine and help understand her origin story.Kerry CondonTrain DreamsLike Heath Ledger’s closed-off cowboy in “Brokeback Mountain,” Joel Edgerton’s taciturn Robert Grainier in “Train Dreams” struggles to put his feelings into words, retreating into himself after his wife dies. When Condon enters the picture, playing a widow who comes along at a moment when the wounded logger appears to have lost his purpose, she brings grace and warmth to the equation. Even just sitting quietly at his side, the Irish actress conveys the healing power of human connection in several quietly profound scenes that course-correct his attitudes on life.Billy CrudupJay KellyWhile his co-star Adam Sandler is rightfully being recognized for his standout supporting role in the film, Crudup also delivers a master class in just a few minutes of screen time. Crudup plays Timothy, a counterpart of George Clooney’s titular movie star who never made it as an actor and sees his old friend as having taken the glory he deserved. As the two catch up, Crudup veers from good-natured to sorrowful to bitter to menacing in a matter of minutes. It’s no coincidence that even when he’s offscreen, his character haunts the rest of the story.Abel FerraraMarty SupremeThe “Bad Lieutenant” helmer gives his Ezra Mishkin an unexpected arc: he at first seems like a doddering old man down on his luck who’s overly attached to his dog. But by the time events with Timothée Chalamet’s Marty come to a head, Ferrara has drawn a sinister character — a gangster with a hair-trigger finger on his gun who will kill to get back his dog and money, in that order. While Ferrara’s gangster is chilling, a climactic shootout in a farmhouse allows him to play Mishkin as the lead in the blackest of comedies.Jacobi JupeHamnetJupe might not be eligible for a SAG ensemble nomination due to technicalities, but he won over audiences in Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet” as the titular character. He plays the young son of William Shakespeare (Paul Mescal) and wife Agnes (Jessie Buckley). In the film, his dad has to travel to London for work and tells his son to “be brave.” Hamnet takes those words to heart and sacrifices his life for his sister’s. Jupe delivers one of the best child performances of the year. He’s charming as a young boy who aspires to follow in his dad’s footsteps, and act. But he pulls out all the stops for the death scene and breaks your heart as he promises to be brave and face death.Lucy LiuRosemeadLiu has always been a scene-stealer, be it the slapstick comedy of “Ally McBeal” or in action pics like “Kill Bill.” What’s particularly impressive about her work in “Rosemead” is how immediately you buy her as the grounded character of Irene, a Chinese immigrant. When she learns her cancer is terminal and her schizophrenic son will soon be legal age, she is driven to a desperate choice that might seem unthinkable. But in Liu’s hands, you never doubt Irene’s love and you can empathize with her impossible plight. It’s a timely, urgent film made all the more harrowing knowing it’s based on a true story.Jay LycurgoSteveAs ensemble acting goes, Netflix’s “Steve” is a knockout, collecting roughly a dozen unfamiliar young performers to play rowdy reform-school cases opposite Cillian Murphy’s unravelling headmaster. The novel that inspired “Steve” was actually named for Lycurgo’s character, Shy, who can turn from tender and introspective one moment to frighteningly aggressive on a dime. Lycurgo did earn a British Independent Film Award for his remarkable, unpredictable performance, but the young actor deserves further accolades. He succeeds in keeping audiences on edge, while also generating empathy for his troubled character.Vahid MobasseriIt Was Just an AccidentIranian actor Mobasseri starred in helmer Jafar Panahi in 2022’s “No Bears,” and here, the revered director casts him as a mechanic whose determination to extract retribution on his jailer is at once chilling, stomach-churning and even funny. Mobasseri plays Vahid as a relatable everyman that the audience latches onto — he is our surrogate. But Mobasseri infuses Vahid with decency that overcomes a thirst for revenge, and in the end, his fear is a startling reminder to not yield to oppression.Sarah NilesF1Niles, as Bernadette, the mother of driving phenom Joshua (Damson Idris), brings charm, savvy and most importantly, a large well of confidence and love for her son to “F1.” It’s not so much one moment with her character, it’s the way her spirit threads through the film: she believes in her son’s talent more than he believes in it. She’s a rock, and when she tells off Sonny (Brad Pitt) — blaming him for her son’s crash during a race — she combines Mama Bear fury and admirable restraint to let Sonny and the audience know that this woman is not to be messed with.TonatiuhKiss of the Spider WomanStraight and white, William Hurt won an Oscar for his then-revolutionary turn as Molina in Hector Babenco’s non-musical 1985 film. But when it came time for Bill Condon to cast the role in his adaptation of the Kander and Ebb show, the “Dreamgirls” director (who previously launched Jennifer Hudson to Oscar glory) searched practically the whole Western hemisphere and found his Molina in Mexican American actor Tonatiuh, who interprets the character’s queer identity quite differently, tapping into more contemporary notions of gender fluidity. Tonatiuh’s Molina can be frivolous one moment, maternal the next, appearing clean-cut, closeted and Cary Grant-like in the fantasy numbers.\n",

The same goes for Chloé Zhao, winner of the audience prize at this year’s Toronto International Film Festival for “Hamnet,” who was selected for her earlier film “The Rider.”\n\n\tThose names join the likes of Christopher Nolan, Coralie Fargeat, Jonathan Glazer, Ruben Östlund, Wes Anderson, Alfonso Cuarón, Steve McQueen and Benh Zeitlin, who were all named “directors to watch” by Variety far in advance of being nominated for best director at the Academy Awards. Not that the distinction is reserved only for awards contenders. The aim is to represent the incredible range of up-and-coming talent in all respects, encompassing a wide range of budgets, genres and identities.\n\n\tOn this year’s list, you’ll find a mix of American-made and international directors, including two with films submitted to the Oscar international feature category (“My Father’s Shadow” and “Happy Birthday”), a handful of independent films world premiering at the Sundance Film Festival later this month (“If I Go Will They Miss Me,” “Josephine” and “Run Amok”) and three stellar debuts from the Cannes Film Festival, where actress Kristen Stewart premiered her first feature behind the camera, “The Chronology of Water.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAkinola Davies Jr.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“My Father’s Shadow”\n\n\tUnlike for a lot of people, 2025 has been a pretty great year for Akinola Davies Jr. His feature debut, “My Father’s Shadow,” won a Camera d’Or special mention at Cannes and went on to be nominated for 12 British Independent Film Awards, winning best director. Davies wrote the film with his brother Wale, a rapper and poet. “He’s really literal,” Davies says, “whereas I think in pictures, so we complement each other.”\n\n\t“My Father’s Shadow” follows two boys and their somewhat absent dad as he takes them into Lagos, Nigeria, from their rural village on a pivotal day — the 1993 election, the country’s first since a 1983 military coup.\n\n\t“Fundamentally, we were just trying to make a film for ourselves and by ourselves,” says Davies, who was born in London but grew up in Nigeria. Through a more nuanced perspective, Davies is committed to offering “representations of the world that we know and see as honest and not as stereotypical,” he says. “We’re the diaspora of Nigerians and Africans authoring our own stories. We think that’s quite important, because often, our stories are authored by people from other parts of the world.”\n\n\tAs for what kind of films he’d like to make in the future, Davies laughs and says, “On any given day, I have a different answer to that question.” He wants to continue to mine the creative partnership he has with his brother. “But what drives me,” he says, “is to tell stories that we haven’t seen before. Whether it’s a thriller, a romance, a horror film or an action film, I just want to make things from a slightly different perspective.”\n\n\t— Carole Horst\n\n\tInfluences: Steven Spielberg, Hirokazu Kore-eda, early Spike Lee, early Julie DashManagement: Lark Management\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBeth de Araújo\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Ava Berkofsky\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Josephine”\n\n\tBeth de Araújo loves to write — she says it centers her — but 11 years ago, she realized there was a personal story burning inside her that she had to tell. \n\n\t“One day, I was pretty deeply triggered by something, and I couldn’t write anything else,” says de Araújo, explaining the impetus to compose “Josephine,” a work of autobiographical fiction about an 8-year-old who witnesses a rape at her local park. “I experienced something at a very young age, and my fear and hypervigilance around sexual assault was very real and present through my life.”\n\n\tDe Araújo’s on-screen proxy is newcomer Mason Reeves, whom she discovered by canvassing a farmer’s market in her native San Francisco. “It was magic when her audition tape came in,” the filmmaker says. “She’s never acted before, but she’s an incredibly smart and emotionally intelligent person.”\n\n\tThe director then recruited Channing Tatum and Gemma Chan for the roles of Josephine’s parents. “It is not often you find A-list cast that will play second on the callsheet to an 8-year-old unknown actor,” de Araújo says. “I find that very heartwarming.”\n\n\tThe drama, de Araújo’s second feature after the single-shot thriller “Soft & Quiet,” will make its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, which brings her full circle after developing the material through the Sundance directors’ lab. Among her fondest memories is “listening to Robert Redford pick apart my scenes in the most loving way because he cared enough to critique them.”\n\n\tWith this tale now told, de Araújo is eager to take on new challenges. “I would like to try my hand at bigger world-building,” she says, looking forward to “the production designer and me having some time to build a world we do not live in.”\n\n\t— Angelique Jackson\n\n\tInfluences: Jacques Audiard, Denis Villeneuve, Ryan Coogler, Debra GranikAgency: WMELegal: Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJan-Ole Gerster\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Daniel Poller\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Islands”\n\n\tEver since he shook up the German film scene with his indie feature debut, “Oh Boy,” Jan-Ole Gerster has been recognized as an actors’ director — someone who generates a synergistic atmosphere on set, so that every role results in a complex, recognizable human being. “For me, working with actors is the most inspiring part of the filmmaking process,” Gerster says. “I love collaborating with them to shape a distinct character and bring their story to the screen.”\n\n\tThe scrappy black-and-white movie that launched actor Tom Schilling’s career, “Oh Boy” (which was retitled “A Coffee in Berlin” in the U.S.), surprised many in 2012, earning six Lolas (the German Film Academy prize) over big-budget “Cloud Atlas.”\n\n\tGerster now aims to work more internationally. His latest film, the sunlit noir “Islands,” was shot in English with English actors Sam Riley and Stacy Martin on Spain’s Fuerteventura. Reviewing the film at the 2025 Berlin Film Festival, Variety called it “Something just psychosexual enough for Patricia Highsmith to have written.”\n\n\tDuring Gerster’s youth in smalltown North Rhine-Westphalia, a video store was his window into the world of cinema. Later, he took a job at Berlin’s X-Filme Creative Pool, which produced “Run Lola Run.”This practical experience earned him a place at Berlin’s prestigious DFFB film school. “Film school was a fantastic field for experimentation — a protected space where you could try things out, fail and start all over again,” he says.\n\n\tGerster is currently developing two scripts, one of which, a psychological dark comedy, is set internationally.\n\n\t— Alissa Simon\n\n\tInfluences: John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands, the Coen brothers, Bob Dylan, Federico Fellini\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSarah Goher\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Cherine Shiha\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Happy Birthday”\n\n\tBorn and raised in the Bronx, Egyptian American writer-director Sarah Goher knew in high school that she wanted to be a filmmaker. As a student at the Nightingale -Bamford School, Goher found inspiration in a videomaking class, but even more formative was her realization post-9/11 that barely any films or TV shows reflected her culture. But now she is at the forefront of that representation — her directing debut “Happy Birthday” is Egypt’s pick for the international feature Oscar.\n\n\tInspired by Goher’s childhood visits to her grandmother, “Happy Birthday” illuminates disparities of wealth and class in contemporary Cairo through the story of a resourceful 8-year-old maid whose devoted friendship with the daughter of the household she works for is discouraged by her employers.The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, where it earned awards for best international narrative feature and screenplay, as well as the Nora Ephron award for a distinguished female filmmaker. Since then, it has been traveling the festival circuit and garnering audience awards from Mill Valley to El Gouna.\n\n\tAlthough “Happy Birthday” marks Goher’s first feature as a director, she boasts an extensive résumé as a writer-producer, having worked in collaboration with her husband, Mohamed Diab, on his films “Cairo 678,” “Clash” and “Amira,” as well as the Marvel TV limited series “Moon Knight.”\n\n\tShe already has two additional features in development. One is a science-fiction story from a child’s perspective. The second, she says, “is set around the first female serial killers in history — who are Egyptian.”\n\n\tGoher’s dream project is a modern take on Hatshepsut, ancient Egypt’s most prosperous pharaoh. Applying the sardonic tone of Sylvia Plath’s “The Bell Jar” to the distaff leader, she aims to make “a dark comedy about the most important and understated woman in ancient civilization, whose successors tried desperately to erase her from history.”\n\n\t— Alissa Simon\n\n\tInfluences: “The Red Balloon,” “The 400 Blows,” “Cinema Paradiso”Legal: Greenberg Glusker\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDave Green\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Karen Kuehn\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Coyote vs. Acme”\n\n\tLooking back, Dave Green recognizes the irony: “I think I was in self-protection mode after the previous experience I’d had [directing “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows”], and I was just wanting to be very careful about who I was going to work with next,” he says, describing the excitement he felt pitching Warner Bros. his take on Ian Frazier’s satirical “Coyote v. Acme” piece, first published in The New Yorker, in which Wile E. Coyote sues the company that manufactured all his faulty equipment.\n\n\t“Pretty much all of the Looney Tunes movies that had ever been made are ensemble movies,” he says. “They are ‘The Avengers,’ basically. But I felt like they’d never made the ‘Iron Man’ of the Looney Tunes movies, and I felt like there was an opportunity there to get to know one character in a really intimate way. And then from there, we can cameo and showcase the other characters.”\n\n\tSamy Burch wrote the script, and Green worked out an elaborate previs presentation, in which hand-drawn characters appeared alongside flesh-and-blood actors (Will Forte would later be cast as the shaggy lawyer representing Coyote), so execs could picture the film Green had in mind. The studio loved the idea, partnering him with producer Chris DeFaria, who had live action/animation hybrid experience from “Tom & Jerry.”\n\n\tMaking the film was a blast, insists Green, whose creative blending of beloved characters (including deep cuts for super-fans) with live-action footage recalls “Who Framed Roger Rabbit.” The sense of humor is similarly anarchic: “I felt like that edginess was always a defining element of the Warner Bros. cartoons over Disney stuff,” Green says.\n\n\tThen, just when the film was finished, the studio bean counters decided to bury the project, choosing to take a tax write-off instead — a tough break for Green, who had bypassed film school, working as an assistant for Sam Raimi on “Spider-Man 3” after getting his American Studies degree at UC Berkeley. \n\n\tHis Amblin-esque 2014 debut, “Earth to Echo,” explored the bond between three boys and a hovering, mostly-computer-generated droid. Then came the “TMNT” sequel, a crash course in motion capture for a young filmmaker hungry for such challenges. “Coyote vs. Acme” was supposed to be the solution to the compromises made on that film. Fortunately, Warner Bros. sold the rights to Ketchup Entertainment, which will release the film in August. Meanwhile, Green is being careful about his next project.\n\n\t“I’m always looking to do something I haven’t done before, and getting to stretch into new areas,” says Green, who’s developing an R-rated high school party movie called “Hex” that has a supernatural element to it. “Everything I’m chasing these days is darker, allowing me to step outside the family space.”\n\n\t— Peter Debruge\n\n\tInfluences: Steven Spielberg, Tim Burton, the Coen brothers, Sam RaimiAgency: UTAManagement: Kaplan/PerroneLegal: Hirsch Wallerstein Hayum Matlof + Fishman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tChandler Levack\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for IMDb\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Mile End Kicks”\n\n\tWorking as a rock critic in her early 20s, Chandler Levack reserved Sunday nights for a different art. “‘Girls’ was my film school,” she says. “I was the same age as Lena Dunham, and I wanted to become a writer-director, so I’d watch each episode to dissect the choices: ‘OK, they’re cutting to the wide. Why?’”\n\n\tLevack carried that curiosity into her first two features, “I Like Movies” and “Mile End Kicks,” drawing on her suburban Ontario adolescence and early Montreal journalism years to portray her own generation with intimacy, candor and — most crucially — hindsight.\n\n\t“You need distance,” she says. “I wrote the first draft of ‘Mile End Kicks’ at 27 and shot it at 37, revisiting emotions from a decade earlier, hopefully with a bit of wisdom. We’re only starting to evaluate and canonize millennial art and music, but there have been far fewer attempts to truly reassess what it all meant, in all its messy grandeur.”\n\n\tLike Dunham, Levack examines her early years closely, delighting in detail while avoiding hazy sentimentality. She calls nostalgia her “Trojan horse.” “I’m obsessed with being as specific and authentic as possible, sometimes to the point of annoying collaborators,” she jokes. “If something doesn’t feel exactly like I remember it, it doesn’t feel cinematic. I make these films to find closure and understanding, but also to heighten and romanticize. It’s a dance between authenticity and gloss.”\n\n\tLevack has already wrapped the Netflix/Happy Madison comedy “Roommates” — her first U.S. production — and is attached to projects with Spyglass and 21 Laps. Looking ahead, she hopes to develop work on both sides of the 49th parallel. “Canadiana rarely gets localized onscreen,” she notes. “But the more specific you are, the more universal it becomes.”\n\n\t— Ben Croll\n\n\tInfluences: Cameron Crowe, Greta Gerwig, Eric Rohmer, Catherine BreillatAgency: WMEManagement: Artists FirstLegal: Gang Tyre Ramer Brown & Passman\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHarry Lighton\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Oliver Holms\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Pillion”\n\n\tIt’s rare, even in the world of independent film, that the arrival of a significant new filmmaker is heralded by the sounds of clanging harnesses and the slick spray from a fresh bottle of lube. But here we are, with director Harry Lighton and his unconventional crowd-pleaser, “Pillion.”\n\n\tOn its face, the film is a tonally diverse examination of gay male BDSM culture from the eyes of a new convert (Harry Melling). His budding relationship with a strict dominant top (Alexander Skarsgard) causes both to find new and often uncomfortable truths about one another, even as Melling’s eager submissive tries to reconcile his kink with his own self-worth. The Cannes breakout tore through the 2025 festival circuit, delighting audiences by doing the impossible: showing tenderness and discovery while still driving the hard point that fetishes are as much shields from pain as they are avenues to pleasure.\n\n\t“One minute it’s making you laugh, and the next it’s making you horny or making you gasp,” Lighton says of his first feature. “There’s as much syrup as there is spice in the film, to keep an audience unfamiliar with this world from running 15 minutes in, when we show an alley blowjob. By then, they’ve already had a bit of a Christmas movie and some nice family dynamics.”\n\n\tWhile Lighton has completed a script about the life of late fashion king Alexander McQueen, co-written with mentor Oliver Hermanus, he’s mulling his next feature outside the queer space.\n\n\t“My filmmaking has been squarely informed by my experience of sexuality and trying to reckon with ways in which I do and don’t feel part of both heteronormative and queer culture,” Lighton says. “I’ve emptied my guts as far as exploring where my identity comes from. I want to see what happens next.”\n\n\t— Matt Donnelly\n\n\tInfluences: Paweł Pawlikowski, Oliver Hermanus, Nick Morris (who shot “Pillion”)Agencies: UTA, Sayle Screen (U.K.)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNB Mager\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Bentonville Fil\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Run Amok”\n\n\tIt’s kind of the tagline on my website, but it really is true: I tell stories about the things that keep me up at night,” says NB Mager, whose Sundance-bound feature debut, “Run Amok,” confronts the impact of gun violence on the American psyche. More to the point, the film (which Mager expanded from a proof-of-concept short of the same name) looks at how a community deals with the 10-year anniversary of a school shooting.\n\n\t“On the political side of things, I feel like there’s a need to place blame and provide answers. Why does this happen? How do we stop this from happening? Those are all really valid questions, and I’m glad that people are thinking about them,” Mager says. “But for me, coming at it from a creative standpoint, I didn’t feel the pressure to give any sort of prescriptive answer.”\n\n\tMager was born in Israel, but moved to the U.S. young enough to have the suburban American public school experience. Walking a tricky tonal line, she skewers aspects that strike her as upsetting or absurd, like active-shooter drills and earnest theater-kid energy, respectively. (Mager studied acting at the North Carolina School of the Arts before shifting her focus to filmmaking.)\n\n\t“I definitely gravitate toward heightened worlds and high-concept ideas,” she says. “I mean, I have a science-fiction project I’m working, but I also have a comedy heist action movie that I’m very excited about.”\n\n\tWhat unites them, according to Mager: “The germ of the idea is always like, I want to grapple with this really challenging subject matter. Maybe it’s the theater person in me, but there’s something about having that more expansive world that allows me to challenge myself in dealing with hard subject matter.”\n\n\t— Peter Debruge\n\n\tInfluences: “Election,” “Promising Young Woman,” “Get Out”Legal: Granderson Des Rochers\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKristen Stewart\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Emily Soto\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“The Chronology of Water”\n\n\tKristen Stewart says that after the Cannes premiere of her debut feature, “The Chronology of Water,” she was able to slow down a bit and refine her vision even more. “I put two minutes back in. I regraded, I finished the score and I refined the sound design — but when I say ‘refined,’ I don’t mean that I cleaned it up; I just was able to go in and make sure that every final, last stone hadn’t been left unturned.”\n\n\tHer passion for cinema, for discourse about art and her film, which stars Imogen Poots, is palpable. Nonlinear and in no way straightforward, “The Chronology of Water” is full of poetic and impressionist sequences. Stewart’s style suits the material, which she adapted from the memoir by Lidia Yuknavitch. Yuknavitch’s book chronicles her horrific childhood abuse, how she found freedom in swimming and her painful journey as a writer.\n\n\t“I want to make big commercial poems that are films,” says Stewart. “I really think it’s possible, and I think that everyone wants it. It’s not weird; it’s just that we haven’t done it in a minute, you know?”Stewart spent eight years trying to get this film made. Having become very familiar with formulaic Hollywood movies, she loves the fact that “Water” is at once a very specific story and also a “reality-breaking full dreamy tone poem … for people who’ve been through some fucking shit,” Stewart explains.\n\n\t“It just felt like, ‘Oh, do you want to be allowed to take up some space and say stuff?’ That’s why I want to be a director. That’s why it’s hard to do so if you’re a young woman as an actress in this business,” she says. “It’s about repossessing all of the language that surrounds us and inundates our self-worth and the way we see ourselves, and just fucking breaking the back of those words and figuring out your own. So that’s why it was my first movie, and I had to do it. There was no fucking way around it.”\n\n\t— Carole Horst\n\n\tInfluences: Kate Zambreno, Maggie Nelson, Barbara Hammer, Andrei TarkovskyAgency: WMELegal: McKuin Frankel Whitehead\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWalter Thompson-Hernández\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Kemal Cilengir\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“If I Go Will They Miss Me”\n\n\tLike the hyphenated last name of its creator, Thompson-Hernández’s debut feature reflects the two sides of his cultural heritage. “My dad is Black, my mom is Mexican,” says the Los Angeles native, whose “If I Go Will They Miss Me” blends street-level realism with fantastical elements extrapolated from Greek mythology. Imagine “Killer of Sheep” meets “Beasts of the Southern Wild.”\n\n\t“I grew up under the LAX flight path and always had this fascination with flight. My friends and I would often chase these airplanes,” says the self-taught writer-director. For years, he worked as a global subculture reporter for the New York Times, traveling the world, embedding himself in unfamiliar communities in order to tell their stories — good practice for an approach that is equal parts poet and cultural anthropologist.\n\n\tThe new film, set to premiere at Sundance in January, reflects his home turf. “I didn’t know my father growing up, but there were other men in my life — you know, my friends, neighbors, uncles, cousins — who sort of stepped up,” he says.\n\n\tAn earlier short got him invited to the Sundance labs. “The script for the short film was essentially a drawing of a boy standing on a rooftop with wings on both of his sides,” says Thompson-Hernández, who shot two features that both premiered in the past year. \n\n\tThe first was the sports doc “Untold: Shooting Stories” about two former NBA basketball players. He also released fiction-based “Kites,” cobbled together in Brazil over the course of five years.\n\n\tBasketball means a lot to Thompson-Hernández, who played professionally for the Mexican national team for a few years. “As I dove into arts and filmmaking, I felt almost embarrassed that I had a basketball background, because I didn’t know athletes who were able to do both,” he says. ”Now, I’m so grateful for that experience. I think about the sort of discipline and the approach I have to work with people. As a director, I’m like a coach.”\n\n\tDrawing on those days, Thompson-Hernández has written what he calls “a West Coast version of ‘He Got Game’” to make next.\n\n\t— Peter Debruge\n\n\tInfluences: Painters such as Jacob Lawrence, Noah Davis and Windred RembertAgency: UTALegal: Granderson Des Rochers\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to Watch the 2026 World Junior Hockey Championships Online Free\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBell & Ross Will Be Land Rover’s Official Timekeeper for the Dakar Rally\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon vs. YouTube, Other Tech Battles Reshaping Sports in 2026\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

The towering originality of Jim’s visualization is a given; what makes “Fire and Ash” so potent is its believability.\n\n\tAfter the first two installments, the world knows the origin story of “Avatar.” Jake and Neytiri’s family — including Spider, Quaritch’s son — are refugees sheltering among the Metkayina Reef People with their Maori tattooing and anthropologically complete belief system and pacifist politics. For “Fire and Ash,” Jim added the apostate Ash Clan — Na’vi raiders led by the lethal and seductive Varang (Oona Chaplin). Resources Development Administration is pursuing its imperative of colonization and has Quaritch (Stephen Lang) on point, now reappearing in recombinant form. But there’s dissent within RDA, and Quaritch has a side agenda to regain his son.\n\n\tAs with Pandora’s biodiversity, Jim has architected different cultures that resonate with authenticity. From the thesis that there are standard patterns within diverse human cultures, Cameron has applied structure principles in building Pandora’s people with the erudition of an anthropologist. Each has rituals, value systems and sympathetic magic with which they interconnect with nature to influence outcomes. \n\n\tTheir tribal aesthetics of wardrobe, tattooing and habitation is so specific, you feel these people dress themselves. For the assault of RDA’s colonization, he may have mined patterns from the rape of the Congo by Belgium’s King Leopold or the plight of Brazilian rainforest peoples. These contexts that Jim has built envelop his characters’ rage, frustration, tragedy, aspirations, ambivalence, moments of rapture and vengeance with authenticity. That authenticity amplifies the visceral power of his storytelling.\n\n\tThroughout Jim’s propulsive narrative, we experience the Na’vi and humans as more complex people caught in a dire conflict zone in an alien future. And the authenticity of what he’s built makes it resonate with even more visceral power.\n\n\tJim’s artistry, intellect and heavy lifting creates diverse alien biology, anthropology, mechanical engineering, politics, visualization and taut storytelling. It’s extraordinary. Jim began with a blank piece of paper. No writer-director I can think of has invented as large a three-dimensional world of his own imagining as has Jim. “Fire and Ash” on its own is an incredible achievement. There are two more installments to come. From some point in the future, when regarded historically, the whole of “Avatar” will be seen as the magnum opus it truly is.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAll That’s Left of You\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy Janicza Bravo\n\n\tA family is uprooted from the place they have always called home and is forced to rebuild elsewhere. “All That’s Left of You” is a timely, multigenerational chronicle of a family amid the backdrop of occupation that seamlessly unfolds with an eye that is unflinching but vulnerable. The work in front of and behind the camera is elegant and urgent. It takes the audience on a journey to define and redefine what home can look like.\n\n\tIf we’re lucky, there are a handful of films that come out every year that that leave you breathless. Cherien Dabis’ film has done just that.\n\n\tThere is one scene that is particularly unshakable. On the heels of a sudden curfew, a father is forced to choose what feels like life or death in front of his son. He chooses life to protect his son, but it looks like humiliation, and it forever changes their relationship. The work underlines connection and resilience in the face of injustice. And though my heart was shattered over and over again, I was still left with a sense of hope. A door was opened to a dialogue and a language many of us have struggled to put into words.\n\n\tAward-winning filmmaker Janicza Bravo is best known for “Zola,” as well as her work on series suchas “The Bear,” “Too Much,” “Dear White People” and “Poker Face.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBlue Moon and Nouvelle Vague\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Variety via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy Taylor Hackford\n\n\tMost directors achieve a career-defining moment when they create a film that puts them in Oscar contention. This year, Richard Linklater has done it twice. His delightful tribute to the French New Wave, “Nouvelle Vague,” was shot in Paris, in French, on a shoestring budget. This pre-eminent American independent filmmaker doesn’t speak French, but his intuitive creativity (with a little help from his French-speaking producer, Michèle Pétin) delivers the impossible — a cast of French actors, who not only embody the indelible spirit of the creators of the seminal “Breathless,” but also look exactly like their original counterparts: Jean Luc Godard, Jean Seberg and Jean Paul Belmondo. The movie is so authentic that the French government awarded Linklater its prestigious Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres at the recent American French Film Festival.\n\n\tBut creating one little gem this year wasn’t enough for Richard Linklater. He’s also presenting us with “Blue Moon,” a jewel-like portrait of America’s greatest lyricist, Lorenz Hart. Again, the director had to find an actor who could embody this unique genius: a gnome-sized, alcoholic, homosexual Jew with a bad combover, whose voluble delivery belies his self-hate and lack of confidence. Of course, Linklater solved this impossible dilemma by casting tall, good-looking WASP, Ethan Hawke, who delivers a brilliant, Oscar-worthy performance — who knew?!\n\n\tBoth films are small in scope: “Nouvelle Vague” covers the short, 23-day shooting schedule of “Breathless,” so Linklater created the same urgency by shooting in the streets of the City of Lights on an even shorter schedule before the 2024 Paris Olympics; “Blue Moon” takes place in one night, as Lorenz Hart realizes that his long-time collaborator, Richard Rodgers, has supplanted him with Oscar Hammerstein, birthing the greatest songwriting team in Broadway history. The film is set at Sardi’s after the premiere of Rodgers & Hammerstein’s “Oklahoma,” with Linklater satisfying his minuscule budget by shooting on a stage in Dublin, Ireland — you’d never know it.\n\n\tBoth films personify Richard Linklater’s peerless directing style: Painting genuine human beings on screen — in this case, historical characters who are both palpable and convincing.\n\n\tFeature film directors make magic — Richard Linklater is fulfilling his obligation big time.\n\n\tTaylor Hackford is an Oscar-winning filmmaker and former president of the Directors Guild of America. His films include “An Officer and a Gentleman,” “The Devil’s Advocate” and “Ray.” He is currently writing his memoir: “Against All Odds,” which will be published by Hachette in the fall of 2026.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBugonia\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Variety via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy Julio Torres\n\n\tFull disclosure: I am friends with Emma Stone; I have never met Yorgos Lanthimos but I have been a fan since I saw “Dogtooth” in college. Transparency feels like a way of honoring a film about paranoia, gaslighting, lies and manipulation.\n\n\tOn first watch, my sympathy ping-ponged between Jesse Plemons’ Teddy and Emma’s Michelle. He’s a greasy, probably very unwell conspiracy theorist who has kidnapped a cold and robotic girlboss (my favorite little detail is her putting her trench coat on her shoulders to walk out of her mansion, taking three steps to her car and taking it off). Seeing her calmly listening to his deranged nonsense about how she must make contact with her ship made me sympathize with her even though I’m prone to dislike a calculating pharmaceutical CEO. She is after all, his victim. Her cruelty is revealed later though, followed by a series of violent and desperate escalations from both. Yorgos deliberately keeps his audience in the dark for much of the film and in doing so colors the film with his characters’ uneasy paranoia.\n\n\tIt’s in the dizzying, meticulous sparring between the protagonists — each working relentlessly to assert their version of the truth — that the heart of the movie lies. Yorgos’ emphasis and restraint in these scenes make us feel like another person in the room trying to make sense of things, going mad in the process. That unnerving synthesizer score which follows the characters takes this sense of immersion even further. The result feels like scrolling online reading vastly different takes on the same issues. At a certain point, one begins to question … is he right? Could she be an alien?\n\n\tI thought of all the times that I have been made out to feel like a conspiracy theorist for asking questions like “What else does this media company own?” “Why does my school invest in weapon manufacturers?” “Why is this vaccine no longer recommended?” “What would it mean if this company buys this streamer?”\n\n\tWe have entered an era of necessary skepticism, easily dismissed as paranoia by a ruling class who have positioned themselves as the voice of reason. After all, the skeptics carry cardboard signs while “reasonable” people wear suits. Michelle calmly tells her kidnapper that he’s in an “echo chamber,” saying it almost like she’s trying to help him out of it. This reminded me of politicians saying that young people are getting all confused observing wars via TikTok, that they’re consuming propaganda. Never mind that special interest groups bankroll the career of these politicians in exchange for these opinions. Who’s the propagandist?\n\n\tI find it impossible to meaningfully praise this film in a vacuum; it is because we as an audience are often manipulated and lied to by forces more powerful than us that this movie resonates and is being so talked about.\n\n\tTruth is often kept from Yorgos’ protagonists, and getting to the bottom of it rarely ever yields happiness. They’re also almost always very lonely. Teddy proudly states that he’s doing everything on his own, that he’s not part of any movement. Skepticism is isolating, especially when you’re told you’re crazy by those whose agendas clash with the truth. But movies like these can make us feel less lonely.\n\n\t“We are not alone,” reads a tabloid article about aliens that Teddy has in his kitchen. I choose that as my takeaway here. Maybe we feel hopeless, maybe corporations and politicians can toy with our fates while making us feel crazy for pointing that out. But we are not alone!\n\n\tJulio Torres is an author, comedian, actor, writer, director and producer.

Based on a true story, a man holds an executive at a mortgage company who has hustled him out of a land deal and holds the executive hostage, demanding justice as the police and the media surround his apartment.\n\n\tWe think that this is the beginning of a tense stand-off drama, but this isn’t the road that Van Sant travels down. In his latest film, “Dead Man’s Wire,” Van Sant is more interested in looking inside the story, rather than focusing on the mechanics of the piece. He isn’t interested in playing this for high-energy drama, the chaos of the police surrounding the kidnapper’s apartment. It’s inside, where the man holds his hostage, that the story lives and breathes. We slowly understand cause and effect, the injustice that this man has faced prior to the standoff.\n\n\tThis isn’t a high-energy piece of work. That’s not what Gus Van Sant was interested in. His focus is on what’s happening inside the apartment, when a man becomes desperate, exposing behavior that takes a man to the edge. The film is more of an inside look at what created this incident. This is a road that Van Sant travels quite frequently in his filmography. It’s the small moments that interest him, that exposes behavior and frustration. And he shows the desperate actions of a man pushed to the edges of desperation.\n\n\tIn his filmmaking career, Van Sant seems to be more interested at looking inside of a person, cause and effect. In this scenario, the director pushes past the parameters of a hostage standoff and finds the more personal character behavior, a quieter style that looks inside rather than exploring what’s outside the building. It is with the quieter moments that Gus Van Sant continues to push the narrative form. He has done it throughout his career. He works to expose the interior behavior, both the light and dark sides of mankind. This film fits quite well into his filmography.\n\n\tDirector, writer and producer Barry Levinson won an Oscar for “Rain Man,” and his credits include such iconic films as “Diner,” “Good Morning Vietnam,” “Wag the Dog,” “The Wizard of Lies,” “Dopesick” and the upcoming “Assassination.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tElla McCay\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy Celine Song\n\n\tWomen on screen are questioned over and over — by studio execs and critics and audiences — for their ever-elusive “likability.” Even the most adorable women in cinema test worse than their male counterparts, mostly because the bar for tolerating a woman’s authority and subjectivity is significantly harder to clear. This meant that growing up as a serious, ambitious, annoying, controlling, know-it-all, workaholic young woman — woefully inadequate at love and intimacy — I would rarely get to see myself on screen.\n\n\tSo imagine my delight when I met Holly Hunter’s Jane Craig in James L. Brooks’ “Broadcast News,” written lovingly with the sharpness of a scalpel. When she confessed that it is awful to always believe she knows better, to always think she’s the smartest person in the room, I laughed and teared up out of recognition. This smartass was then properly loved by TWO intelligent men, both of whom understood her completely, exactly as she is.\n\n\tInstantly, I fell in love with James’cinema. I have seen everything he has ever touched, and I always take direct inspiration from his films. He is a writer’s filmmaker, first and foremost, in exactly the way I wish to be. He crafts tender, messy stories about small people that always unfold at the scale of life itself. After all, the biggest cinematic universe is our shared humanity, our everyday lives.\n\n\tJames’ films are helmed by the most charming, complicated and powerful women — unafraid of testing low on “likability” — who have no trouble being loved by the sweet men who surround them. Watching his wonderful latest film, “Ella McCay,” I see again a strong-willed woman navigating being a politician while her personal life crashes into everything she has fought so hard for.\n\n\tWhy does Ella, who knows how to make her city a better place to live — bylaw-by-bylaw, policy-by-policy, detail-by-detail — find herself to be so completely stumped when it comes to making her life a better place to be? Why does this magnificent grown woman feel like just a lost little girl in front of her husband and her father? Through her aunt’s love, will she ever learn that she deserves to be happy too, the same way she feels the citizens of her city deserve to be happy? In James’s impeccably written and joyfully directed “Ella McCay,” I feel as always with his movies that he knows me as a girl and a woman, both in my work and my personal life.\n\n\tCeline Song is a playwright, director and screenwriter who won an Oscar for “Past Lives”; her latest film is “Materialists.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Secret Agent\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy Kenneth Lonergan\n\n\tI had the good fortune to become friends with Kleber Mendonça Filho at the 2019 Berlinale, where I was the only American on my jury. I had no idea who my luminous fellow jurors were because my foreign-film literacy is not great — though I’m trying to improve. Kleber, by way of contrast, knew who everybody was: our jury, our filmmakers, the other juries, the films and filmmakers in all the other categories, plus every other film and filmmaker that ever was, as far as I could see.\n\n\tKleber is what they call a cineaste. Like Martin Scorsese or François Truffaut, he is a walking encyclopedia of film. Like them, he is in love with movies — all movies, I suspect. If it’s a movie, Kleber is already halfway in love with it. Just because it’s a movie. And like those giants, Kleber carries into his work a generosity of spirit requisite for that kind of love.\n\n\tHis last film, “Pictures of Ghosts,” was a love letter to the movie theaters he frequented growing up in his hometown of Recife. His new film, “The Secret Agent,” is another kind of love letter. This may be a weird descriptor for a political crime thriller, but I think “The Secret Agent” is also a love letter to Brazil. A strange and brave love letter to ordinary people for whom the ambition to live an ordinary life means danger, anxiety and a continual vigilance against the traps waiting for them everywhere — behind every door, around every corner, at their work, their homes and on the other end of every telephone call. But it’s a love letter all the same. A profoundly moving one, from a cineaste with a blind love for cinema — as they call it everywhere but here — and an unblinkered love for his country and its people.\n\n\tKenneth Lonergan wrote and directed “You Can Count on Me,” “Margaret” and and the Oscar-winning “Manchester by the Sea.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSentimental Value\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for IMDb\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy Paul Thomas Anderson\n\n\tA few years back, Joachim Trier did the world a favor and introduced us to Renate Reinsve. So when superfans like me heard Joachim and Renate were reuniting, there was lots of jumping up and down. Renate’s made-for-the-movies face and talent will take anyone’s breath away. I’ve seen her do things on-screen that make my stomach drop and blood pressure rise. She’s a gift from movie heaven, and Joachim and his co-writer Eskil Vogt know how to provide her with material worthy of her talent.\n\n\tWe hit the jackpot with “Sentimental Value.” It’s like being gently grabbed by the most tender filmmaker working today; you don’t know he’s got you by the throat — he’s just creating people and images you cannot look away from for fear of missing a single frame. Joachim and his film family (Kasper Tuxen, Anders Danielsen Lie and Olivier Bugge Coutté, to name a few) have created a story about real families and cinematic families, memories, mothers, sons, sisters and fathers. And if that isn’t enough to get excited about, the cast includes Stellan Skarsgård and Elle Fanning, who have a scene at a dinner table that will make any filmmaker ask themselves, “Am I really satisfied?”\n\n\tIf you like your acting pitch-perfect — this is the film for you. And if you want to see the real best special effect of the year, it’s Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas’ performance as Agnes. Joachim and his cinematic family, in the words of his fictional dad, Gustav Borg, “achieve complete sync between space and time.” Must be something in the Norwegian winter. Whatever it is, I’ll have what they’re having.\n\n\tSo now, like any superfan, I want to ask the most annoying question: “When do we get another one?”\n\n\tPaul Thomas Anderson has been nominated for 11 Oscars; his credits include “Boogie Nights,” “There Will Be Blood,” “Magnolia” and his current film, “One Battle After Another.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Voice of Hind Rajab\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Samir Hussein/WireImage\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy Barry Jenkins\n\n\tOn Jan. 29, 2024, volunteers at the Palestine Red Crescent were alerted to make an emergency phone call to a 5-year-old girl trapped in a car. For three hours, as machine-gun fire intermittently rang out, the little girl, Hind Rajab, remained on the line sitting amongst dead relatives while the Red Crescent raced to secure a path for an ambulance to rescue her.\n\n\tThe Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania has directed both narrative and documentary features, and that experience is brought to full synergy in the making of her film “The Voice of Hind Rajab.” Ben Hania presents the material as a narrative drama while repeatedly, consistently injecting sound and imagery of the actual Red Crescent recordings. The effort is astounding, never more so than in a moment where reenactment and fact collide: For a moment via cellphone video captured on that day, character and lived subject appear on-screen simultaneously, adorned in the same dress, speaking the same words in a deft turn of form that underscores the devastating fact of these abhorrent circumstances.\n\n\tUpon finishing my screening of the film, a song by Kendrick Lamar of all things came to mind: “When the lights shut off and it’s my turn to settle down, my main concern? Promise that you will sing about me.” A 5-year-old girl should have no concerns. Should she have them, they should amount to deciphering why she enjoys the feeling of sun on her face or to the complex joy of feeling rain on her skin despite the mess it may leave in a land of wind and sand. Should she have concerns at all, they should have nothing to do with 335 rounds of ammunition fired on her helpless position.\n\n\tFilms can take many forms. and this year is no exception. With this film, Kaouther Ben Hania has used cinema as an ancient lament. She has, in effect, done everything she can to sing about Hind Rajab.\n\n\tOscar winner Barry Jenkins directed the films “Moonlight,” “If Beale Street Could Talk” and “Mufasa: TheLion King.” His next project is “The Natural Order.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tIt Was Just an Accident\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Brad Trent\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy Ramin Bahrani\n\n\tI’ve been admiring Jafar Panahi since his debut, “The White Balloon,” and his later masterpieces, “Crimson Gold” and “Offside.” They showed a filmmaker able to take everyday injustice and transform it into cinema that is humane, political and daring.\n\n\tThen came the ban. For 15 years, Panahi has been forbidden to make films and travel; he has been interrogated, imprisoned and monitored. And still he made films, armed only with imagination, humor, grit and necessity. He had no choice.\n\n\tHis latest masterpiece, “It Was Just an Accident,” feels like the culmination of everything he has endured and learned. Its tonal balance is extraordinary: thriller, satire, political farce, sudden violence, all held together with the unpredictability of real human contradictions. The film builds from sound: a man listening to his former interrogator’s footsteps. It’s a brilliant Hitchcockian opening that Panahi turns into moral inquiry.\n\n\tThe film’s surprising twists and turns build toward a climactic confrontation between the former inmates and their captor. It unfolds in a single astonishing static long take — over 13 minutes — where time itself becomes a pressure cooker. The scene vibrates with moral tension and raw humanity, leaving the audience breathless, suspended between fear and possibility.\n\n\tThe coda returns to off-camera sound: footsteps. An enigmatic echo that allows “It Was Just an Accident” to resonate long after it ends. It leaves us with questions rather than answers: Can brutality be confronted without revenge? What will future Iranians make of this film when they can finally watch it freely? And Panahi is, perhaps unknowingly, addressing all of us in a moment when democracies are thinning and fear is becoming policy: What choices will we make?\n\n\tRamin Bahrani’s credits include “The White Tiger,” “99 Homes” and “At Any Price”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Testament of Ann Lee\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy Embeth Davidtz\n\n\tIn watching “The Testament of Ann Lee,” I was struck by the idea that Mona Fastvold is to filmmaking what Ann Lee was to religion. She is as original and exacting as her main character was radical and austere.\n\n\tThe subject matter is not for a faint-of-heart director: the life story of the Shaker movement’s founder in all of her fervent expression and abstinence. Yet Fastvold’s film unfolds in the most surprising way — in a very un-Shaker-like execution, using ravishing choreography, choral voices and a discordant score while portraying the Shakers’ devotion cinematically as almost orgiastic.\n\n\tI was stunned by the otherness of the world Fastvold conjured up. And while the film feels like an exquisite visual fever dream, she maintains historical clarity throughout. It takes a uniquely skilled hand to square the tension of linear biographical storytelling against the backdrop of maximalist epic filmmaking, allowing the audience to feel like we studied a historical tome and watched a movie, ballet and opera all at the same time. She even manages to inject a wry humor into the scenes where baffled bystanders witness the ecstasy of the dance and prayer sequences, showing their astonishment, all the while maintaining a reverence for the Shakers.\n\n\tA director like this is a gift to actors, as is visible in the revelation of Amanda Seyfried’s Ann Lee. She is wild and liberated, pitch-perfect in every way as the innocent, the woman, the zealot and the saint. The film’s greatest strength is Fastvold’s female gaze, which bathes its entire world in a magical, mythical and undeniably feminist light.\n\n\tEmbeth Davidtz made her directorial debut with “Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMaterialists\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for 20th Century St\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy James L. Brooks\n\n\tFor starters, Celine Song’s “Materialists” teaches all of us a lesson by getting all needed exposition out of the way in the first 30 seconds. The term “off and running” never had better use. And then, at every turn, she does the improbable, as she renders a deeply romantic story with gorgeously romantic dialogue that still remains a truth-seeking missile. I guess the search for truth comes easy when you’re a singular writer and your college major was psychology with a minor in philosophy.\n\n\tHer star, Dakota Johnson, plays a 37-year-old whose romantic notions are outweighed by hardcore pragmatism. She wants a rich catch of a man, and she deeply knows what a real “catch” is since her profession is matchmaker. The catch — the super catch (her term is “unicorn”) — is played by the intensely sexy Pedro Pascal. He checks all her boxes but not her organs.\n\n\tThe other point of the triangle, whom we flow to as if he were gravity, is the ever-elusive hero of heroes, the nice guy, the super nice guy played by Chris Evans. He is her ex-boyfriend, who, while hovering in the background, says one of those gorgeous lines to the equally gorgeous Dakota: “When I look at you, I see wrinkles, gray hair and children who look like you. I can’t help it.” Incredibly, lines like that come by the bunch: “You’re the only reason I know I’m capable of love.” And referring to their painful history, he still has no regrets, saying, “If I was different, I couldn’t be the guy who lost you.”\n\n\tThere used to be this endless argument that film dialogue should not call attention to itself because movies are about image and must keep moving, kill your darlings and all that. Praise be! Here comes writer-director Celine Song, armed with great words and the ability to guide her actors so that the goal of goals for a film is fully realized: unforgettable characters in a wholly satisfying story.\n\n\tJames L. Brooks won three Oscars for “Terms of Endearment,” and he directed “Broadcast News” and As Good as It Gets.” His latest feature, “Ella McCay,” is in theaters now.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOne Battle After Another\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy Mike White\n\n\tWhen I keep hearing how great some new movie is, I’m usually skeptical — maybe it’s professional jealousy or my contrarian nature, or maybe it’s just wanting to keep my expectations low to avoid disappointment. Fortunately, “One Battle After Another” is not a movie that can be overhyped. The entire running time, I watched it mesmerized and giddy. It felt like a battle cry from a great filmmaker, a creative call to arms.\n\n\tThere are questions we storytellers are always grappling with. Can you write something that’s personal but epic? Full of complex ideas but also hugely entertaining? Can you execute your vision with filmmaking that’s simultaneously audacious and intimate? Can you capture performances — from actors we’ve seen a hundred times before, or never — that are indelible, funny and soulful? Paul Thomas Anderson and his collaborators answer these questions with a resounding yes.\n\n\tAnd the bigger questions that haunt our industry, like in the age of the tech company-film studio, will everything just be a disposable soup of IP? Will human artists lose the reins of inspiration to AI slop? Can big-canvas movies no longer be political or urgent or serve as cultural touchstones? The movie is its own answer. QED, mic drop.\n\n\tVivid, original art is an intoxicant. After watching “One Battle After Another,” I felt high and had trouble going to bed. Even in my sleep, my brain was ignited by its ideas and its imagery. A brilliant, uncanny dream begets more dreams. This is my hope — for myself and for our business.\n\n\tMike White is the Emmy-winning creator of such TV series as “The White Lotus” and “Enlightened.” He wrote the films “School of Rock” and “Chuck & Buck” and directed “Year of the Dog” and “Mamma Dallas.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tF1: The Movie\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy Dan Gilroy\n\n\tWith unrivaled passion, an unerring eye and ear for the pressures and psychology of its subject and inspired use of groundbreaking technology, Joe Kosinski’s “F1” takes the checkered flag in the vaunted race-film pantheon.\n\n\tValidating the heart-stopping practical driving sequences with character build and a story of generational conflict, Kosinski puts us in the cockpit of 200-mph-plus cutting-edge cars to explore the globe-spanning world of F1 and the drivers who can only find peace on the track. Kosinski more than succeeds at both, creating a thunderous experience of movement and speed while never losing sight of the drama behind the wheel.\n\n\tWrangling a production that shot at eight actual races around the world, Kosinski captures one of the finest performances of his star Brad Pitt’s career. As the speeds climb and the emotional stakes sharpen, the story and world become utterly immersive.

Films have fixed time frames and narrative arcs; life doesn’t. Film biographies struggle to contort a life into an arc. Most often they fail. An artist’s true life is his work, not his activities. To find the narrative arc one must go inside the work. To find Yukio Mishima’s true life, I went inside his novels.\n\n\tWhich is why Scott Cooper’s “Deliver Me From Nowhere” impressed me. When I first heard about the film, I thought it was a fool’s errand. How can you “capture” Bruce Springsteen? I knew I couldn’t.But what Cooper understands is that “Nebraska” isn’t a period piece or a myth — it’s a confession.\n\n\tMost directors would have wrapped this material in reverence, in iconography, in the soft glow of “importance.” Cooper refuses all that. He strips the frame to its bone: wood paneling, denim, the hum ofthe tape machine, the air between breaths. He approaches Springsteen not as an icon to be celebrated, but as a man engaged in a private reckoning. And that is Cooper’s gift — the strength to hold the cam-era steady, to let silence speak, to trust that truth doesn’t need to be underlined. It’s the confidence of a filmmaker who knows the miracle is already there, if you have the patience — and the courage — to watch.\n\n\tWith Warren Zane’s book about the creation of “Nebraska” as an access point, Cooper gets inside Springsteen’s rental house in Colt’s Neck and waits for Bruce to emerge. Madison Square Garden is the backdrop; Colt’s Neck is the stage. And one by one they emerge: the state trooper, my father’s house, the mansion on the hill. Cooper’s genius is in letting the songs lead the viewer into the biography.\n\n\tPaul Schrader’s credits include “Master Gardener,” “Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters,” “American Gigolo” and the upcoming “The Basics of Philosophy.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWicked: For Good\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy J.J. Abrams\n\n\tWhat a challenge it is to direct a musical. Especially one as beloved, vast and layered as “Wicked.” The genre demands precision in tone, rhythm and emotion. The material demands reverence and reinvention at the same time. And the audience demands that their treasured Glinda and Elphaba be presented as they know them, yet still experience moments that are unexpected and thrilling.\n\n\tWith “Wicked: For Good,” Jon M. Chu meets those demands with precision, inspiration and even an effortless-seeming joy. The second half of this two-part adaptation carries its own unique pressures: the darker turn in the narrative, the deepening of character relationships and the responsibility of bringing this epic telling based on Baum’s classic to a satisfying close. Chu approaches all of this with such clarity and confidence that the effort behind it almost disappears.\n\n\tThe musical numbers in “Wicked: For Good” feel fully integrated rather than ornamental, each emerging from character and story with a naturalness that is deceptively difficult to achieve. “The Girl in the Bubble” (a new song for this film) stands out as a prime example — a visually bold, emotionally grounded, meticulously shaped sequence.\n\n\tFans are embracing the film’s heightened drama, its richer psychological shading and the deepened complexity between Glinda and Elphaba. The narrative and visual ambition, and the film’s commitment to emotional scale, are undeniable, as is Chu’s operatic sweep, his ability to move from stillness and simplicity to muscular, thrilling action.\n\n\tMusicals are often celebrated or critiqued for how well they unify disparate disciplines. That “Wicked: For Good” feels so cohesive, purposeful, emotional and of a piece is a testament to Chu’s command of this particularly challenging form.\n\n\tJ.J. Abrams’ credits include TV series “Felicity,” “Lost” and “Westworld” and feature films in the Star Wars and Star Trek canons, as well as the upcoming “Ghost Writer.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHedda\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy William Oldroyd\n\n\tFrom high up on a castle roof, a woman fires a pistol across the lavender sky. It’s a warning shot, a harbinger of the night of debauchery to come and, most importantly, a fitting introduction to one of the greatest characters ever written. Often described as “the female Hamlet,” Hedda Gabler is a role to be tackled by an artist at the top of their game. Tessa Thompson does not so much tackle the part as populate it, every pore, with reckless but vehement intention.\n\n\tThis hundred-year-old story has been reborn under the beguiling temporal dissonance of Nia DaCosta’s fierce script and brilliant direction. In 2025, Hedda is queer, black, whip-smart and capricious: “I can’t help myself. I just do things all of a sudden and I don’t know why.”\n\n\tHedda haunts and teases and taunts and electrifies and seduces her guests. And why does she do these things? Why, because she’s bored! “Catastrophically bored,” as she puts it. If you are a woman or a person who knows a woman, you will know that a woman’s boredom can be cataclysmic, earth-shattering and ultimately redefining. But that faceted fire does not always translate onto a screen; it is an emphatically rare assemblage of talent that can take a story about a woman’s languor and turn it into one of the most visually dynamic and thrilling spectacles of the year. Nia and Tessa have done just that, and I can divine why behind every period-popped collar: director and actor had formed the sort of relationship that both dream of — that of a confident conductor and a virtuoso soloist, utterly synchronized and compassionately propelling one another into ever braver territory. The result is a piece of art that vibrantly screams, There is nothing boring about a woman’s ennui. Because she will never stay down for very long and, when she rises again, it will be with a great fire at her feet.\n\n\tWilliam Oldroyd’s credits include “Lady Macbeth,” “Eileen” and the upcoming thriller “His & Hers”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNo Other Choice\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Loccisano\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy David Lowery\n\n\tPark Chan-wook has always been an expert tightrope walker. He maintains perfect poise even when his movies are swinging wildly beneath his feet, across multiple tones and genres. He is also, it turns out, a master at sleight of hand. \n\n\tFor nearly the entirety of new film “No Other Choice,” I thought I was watching a comedy; I marveled at how he pushed this noir-ish thriller into full on slapstick territory while simultaneously tightening the tension to a breaking point. There’s a pursuit through woods that skips right past the Buster Keaton school of physical comedy and goes for the full Jim Carrey. There are jokes in the filmmaking itself, including an edit involving crashing waves that would make the Farrelly brothers proud, as well as a murder set piece that feels like a loving homage to the 1980 horror comedy “Motel Hell” (a movie which I have no idea if director Park has actually seen but which he’d probably get a kick out of). \n\n\tHe has always laced his pictures with wit, but I’ve never laughed out loud quite as much as I did at this one — which is why I missed the very timely fury that he’s set to a slow boil throughout the film, and which culminates in a line of dialogue far more brutal than all the violence that’s led to it. I didn’t see it coming, and now I can’t shake it. That’s the magic trick: “No Other Choice” holds up the starkest of mirrors, and director Park keeps us laughing until we recognize our own reflection.\n\n\tDavid Lowery has directed such films as “The Green Knight,” “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints,” “A Ghost Story,” “The Old Man & the Gun” and the upcoming “Mother Mary.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNuremberg\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy Michael Shannon\n\n\tJamie Vanderbilt has a magical mind. His ability to unravel and organize multiple disparate story lines into a singular propulsive narrative with not only cohesion and clarity but also a sense of spontaneity is astonishing. All great artistry I believe is invisible. It doesn’t call attention to itself, its only interest is bringing the audience closer to the story so that the story becomes as deeply felt as possible for those watching it. Jamie does this.\n\n\tTo begin with “The Nazi and the Psychiatrist” as your source material and then decide you need to show the trials as well? All in the same movie? That is the highest level of difficulty you can set for yourself. That is the Olympic diver saying, “What if I flipped 4 1/2 times?” But Jamie did it because he knew that a film like this does not get made very often or hardly at all. He knew how important it was to show every facet, every perspective, to establish empathy for every character. That ultimately this isn’t just a film about good guys and bad guys. It’s about the fact that every single one of us is capable of being either one, sometimes without even being aware of it. Which is such an urgent message in this day and age.\n\n\tAnd like I said earlier, you would never have guessed he was in the midst of such a massive undertaking. He was as cool, calm and collected as a fellow could be. Focused mightily on the task but also open and available and receptive to all inquiries and ideas. When Russell Crowe and I said we wanted to do our examination scene in one day, he trusted us and figured out how to make it work for him even though it was a significant change to the schedule and production was highly skeptical we could accomplish it.\n\n\tThey say you can measure someone’s worth by the company they keep. Jamie is like a Pied Piper. He directed Redford, for crying out loud. But it’s not just who he casts, it’s the designers, the DPs, composers, and this for a guy who doesn’t get to do this very often. So far anyway. I hope it gets more frequent. I’d work with him again in a heartbeat.\n\n\tMichael Shannon directed “Eric LaRue,” and stars in “Nuremberg.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSirât\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy Allison Anders\n\n\tWe rarely enter a movie blank. We arrive with expectations — plot, tone, cast, a sense of what we think awaits us. I came to “Sirât” with only the line: “A man searches for his missing daughter at a rave in the desert.” As a parent, I understood a father’s anguish. And since girlhood, I’ve believed in the strange alchemy between music and arid landscapes.\n\n\tThat’s all I carried into “Sirât.” But within minutes, those associations fell away. This wasn’t rock opera or punk desolation; it was speakers, a laptop, bodies and beats pressed against treacherous ground. My only anchor became the father, Luis (Sergi López in a staggering turn), and his young son. And then — the faces. Faces you’d follow anywhere. I needed that, because filmmaker Oliver Laxe was stripping me of everything I’d entered with: a gentle dissolving of expectation, attachment, even identity, into a kind of purity.\n\n\t“Sirât” is one of those rare films that returns cinema to its highest calling, revealing the invisible and creating a space where form, spirit and humanity converge. Every time I asked, “But why…?”, Laxe removed the impulse from my mind. The film put my heart through the ringer, yet looking away was impossible. I trusted he had something golden to offer, but first I had to let go — of analysis, of coolness, of armor.\n\n\tAs the characters are stripped down, so is the viewer. The landscape expands: sometimes beautiful, sometimes raw, always alive. The desert becomes a character, setting the rhythms of the story and the souls within it. Laxe’s pacing captures what we in SoCal call “desert time.” You can’t impose your city clock on it.\n\n\tWhat moves me most is the film’s spiritual clarity. Laxe doesn’t impose meaning; he uncovers it. He trusts your deepest wisdom and in that trust you feel guided. “Sirât” reminds me that cinema longs to be transcendental. Laxe gets it. He brings it. And I’m renewed by it.\n\n\tAlison Anders’ credits include “Gas Food Lodging,” “Grace of My Heart,” a thriving TV career and the upcoming “Paul Is Dead.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSorry, Baby\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Variety via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy Jesse Eisenberg\n\n\tAbout 30 minutes into “Sorry, Baby,” there’s an unremarkable wide shot of an unremarkable house on an unremarkable college-town street.\n\n\tWhat happens next is one of the great directorial flourishes I’ve ever seen: two simple time cuts as the house slips from afternoon to night. In the context of this brilliant, boiling, enigmatic and ultimately heartbreaking movie, those shots are a kick to the gut; you know what’s happening inside that house. I found myself audibly saying, “No, God, no,” and covering my face like I was watching Carrie get drenched in pig’s blood.\n\n\tI spent the final hour of the film rapt by Victor’s portrayal of someone wronged but confused, vengeful but scared, loving but aloof. And, annoyingly, I spent that same hour thinking, “I’ll never make something as deft as this.” How is Eva Victor so attuned to the messy, brutal, funny psychology of a person trying to codify their pain, and at the same time so technically assured as a filmmaker? How do they jump through time with such confidence, weave heavy themes with absurdist humor without ever seeming eager, and trust that their subtle, interior performance will translate a full life to an audience?\n\n\tAnd, of course: what can I steal from this movie? How do I say everything I want to say without being obvious, without over-indicating, without flattering the audience into getting it? I loved this movie as much as I envied it. And as my team of psychologists often tell me, deep envy is my highest form of praise.\n\n\tOscar-nominated Jessie Eisenberg’s credits include “When You Finish Saving the World” and “A Real Pain.” His next film is an untitled musical comedy starring Julianne Moore and Paul Giamatti.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTrain Dreams\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy James Mangold\n\n\tThe best films are hard to describe. They defy words. They sneer at synopsis. They eclipse plot. They are pure light, emotion and energy.\n\n\tBased on the novella by Denis Johnson, Clint Bentley’s sublime film, “Train Dreams,” tracks the life of an ordinary man, a logger and loner, working the great northwest woods in the early 20th century. His name is Robert Grainier and he is played by a magnificent Joel Edgerton, an actor whose work has always been rough, tender and beautiful but, in this role, seems to find room to even further expand.\n\n\tWe will come to know Robert, traveling through half his life in the first five minutes. Then the film hunkers down, as Robert falls in love with the luminous Gladys (Felicity Jones), the woman he will marry but also the love he must abandon for paying work.\n\n\tThe deep woods are not just Robert’s place of work or a background. They also serve as a kind of natural cathedral, a world of beauty but also a crucible of loneliness (beautifully realized by cinematographer Adolpho Veloso and scored by Bryce Dessner). It is in these vast woods that Robert will witness a murder that will haunt his life.\n\n\tBentley and writing partner Greg Kwedar populate Robert’s journey with charming forlorn characters. They find solace in each other, however fleeting. Jones shines as Gladys, the love of Robert’s life. William H. Macy is glorious as a wizened old timer who becomes Robert’s true friend. And Kerry Condon dazzles again when she arrives like a cool breeze in the third act.\n\n\tThrough Robert’s eyes, Bentley and his collaborators reveal a world changing forever and always. The American frontier in all its wildness is literally being cut and felled to build the 20th century.\n\n\t“Train Dreams” must be seen and felt. If you’ve already watched it, my work is done. But if you haven’t, I hope this nudges you. “Train Dreams” is not cinematic kale. It is not a history lesson. But yes, it is profoundly good for you.\n\n\tOscar-nominated James Mangold’s credits include “A Complete Unknown,” “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” “Ford v. Ferrari,” “Walk the Line” and has “Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi” on his slate.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBy Karen Kusama\n\n\tRian Johnson’s third installment in his “Knives Out” whodunnit series might also be its most pleasurable and profound. “Wake Up Dead Man” is tonally fleet-footed, managing to skewer the hypocrisies of modern-day religious cultures while also giving compassionate voice to the naked hope among their brethren. Set in a small-town New York parish, the look of the film is surprisingly dark and stormy, and Rian experiments with his twistiest, most Gothic mystery yet. His freewheeling ensemble of actors fully embrace the assignment: every character embodies both the sane and the ridiculous, and their moral failings (namely the chief culprits of Greed, Wrath and Envy) are drawn with a satisfying and comical humanity. Josh Brolin’s Monsignor Wicks believes a vengeful God is also a just one, but he’s sly enough to “confess” the sin of masturbation while pointing out the virtue of shower gel. And this time around, Daniel Craig’s Benoit Blanc is the sobering and skeptical foil to the sincere true believer in Josh O’Connor’s Father Jud. They engage in a philosophical tug-of-war between doubt and faith, pessimism and hope — and somewhere between those two poles, Rian finds a soulful center punctuated with moments of ineffable grace. In the end, he dares to make this shamelessly entertaining story also a deeply personal one. Sometimes, kindness wins.\n\n\tEmmy-nominated Karyn Kusama has directed for such series as ‘Yellowjackets,” “In Treatment,” “Billions” and her feature credits include “Girl Fight” and “Jennifer’s Body.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to Watch the 2026 World Junior Hockey Championships Online Free\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBell & Ross Will Be Land Rover’s Official Timekeeper for the Dakar Rally\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon vs. YouTube, Other Tech Battles Reshaping Sports in 2026\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

It will also be about watching actors attempt to stretch, surprise and sometimes completely reinvent themselves in front of our eyes. \n\n\tVariety‘s annual slate of the most anticipated film performances is defined by momentum and ambition. Legacy stars are stepping back into the arena with something to prove, while a new generation edges closer to that elusive line between “promising” and “arrived.”\n\n\tWe have icons like Meryl Streep and Denzel Washington returning to familiar archetypes with the weight of history behind them. Elsewhere, performers like Charles Melton and Sadie Sink are chasing the kind of work that reshapes careers rather than simply advances them. Comedians are turning toward drama (Hannah Einbinder). Dramatic actors are flexing comic instincts (Penélope Cruz). And a handful of performers appear determined to make 2026 the year the industry finally catches up to what they’ve been doing all along.\n\n\tWhat makes this year especially dynamic is the sheer range of tones and filmmakers in play. Alejandro G. Iñárritu is pushing Tom Cruise into darkly comic, existential territory. Werner Herzog is orchestrating something gloriously strange with Kate and Rooney Mara at its center. Christopher Nolan is mounting a mythic adaptation of “The Odyssey,” positioning Matt Damon as cinema’s ultimate wanderer. Elsewhere, Boots Riley skewers capitalism through satire, Steven Spielberg returns to alien awe with a sense of menace, and the long-awaited “Peaky Blinders” film looms as either a victory lap or a funeral march for one of television’s most indelible characters.\n\n\tThese performances aren’t ranked by their award probability, though we expect many will land in that conversation. They’re selected for the choices behind them. Some actors are testing whether they can carry a franchise. Others are trying to prove they’re more than one. A few are simply reminding audiences why their presence on screen still matters as much as ever.\n\n\tWhether it’s Christian Bale’s latest interpretation of Frankenstein’s creature with a punk-rock edge or KJ Apa attempting the near-impossible task of embodying the legendary Jimmy Stewart, these are the 65 performances we can’t wait to see, and the ones most likely to dominate conversations long after the credits roll.\n\n\tNote: The list is limited to one performer per film, with actors appearing only once, regardless of multiple projects.\n\n\tHonorable mentions: Amy Adams (“Klara and the Sun”); Ben Ahlers (“Little Brother”); Javier Bardem (“The Beloved”); Jessica Chastain (“Other Mommy”); Michael Fassbender (“Hope”); Will Ferrell (“Judgment Day”); Ralph Fiennes (“28: Years Later: The Bone Temple”); Jake Gyllenhaal (“In the Grey”); Nicholas Hoult (“How to Rob a Bank”); Caleb Landry Jones (“Dracula: A Love Tale”); Thomasin McKenzie (“The Uprising”); Rosamund Pike (“Wife and Dog”); Julia Roberts (“Panic Carefully”); Ryan Reynolds (“Mayday”); Meg Ryan (“Good Sex”); Cory Michael Smith (“October”); John Turturro (“The Only Living Pickpocket in New York”); Jeremy Allen White (“The Mandalorian and Grogu”)\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNeve Campbell — ‘Scream 7’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Jessica Miglio\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tNeve is back!\n\n\tCampbell’s presence gives “Scream 7” a sense of franchise DNA — and the best-case scenario is a role that treats legacy like story, not decoration. If the film can strike a balance with the series’ meta humor with genuine dread, Campbell can bring some emotional ballast that makes the scares matter.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWill Poulter — ‘Union County’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Sundance\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWill Poulter has his share of exceptional work that proves his immense capabilities as an actor (i.e., “Detroit”). Buzz surrounds his upcoming turn in Adam Meeks’ “Union County,” a drama about a man who must attend a court-mandated drug program. Set to premiere at Sundance, it could be the character-driven exploration that allows Poulter to shed remnants of youthful eccentricity in favor of grounded complexity.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHannah Einbinder — ‘Teenage Sex and Death at Camp Miasma’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Variety via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tEmmy winner Hannah Einbinder’s move into genre-leaning material invites some curiosity. Written and directed by Jane Schoenbrun and co-starring Gillian Anderson, if Einbinder can balance satire with sincerity, this role could showcase some surprises. It feels like a calculated risk that could pay off in both cultural relevance and critical enthusiasm.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tO’Shea Jackson Jr. — ‘The Shitheads’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Chelsea Lauren/Variety/REX/Shutterstock\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tI’ve wanted Hollywood to offer O’Shea Jackson more, especially after his breakout turn in “Straight Outta Compton.” Written and directed by Macon Blair, “The Shitheads” sounds like it could be abrasive comedy with something sincere underneath, and Jackson is well-suited to that blend. The film co-stars Dave Franco, Mason Thames and Peter Dinklage, and is set to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. I believe Jackson can deliver in a rowdy comedy without sanding down the edges.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOlivia Wilde — ‘I Want Your Sex’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“I Want Your Sex” is a title engineered to stop the scroll, and Olivia Wilde’s return to acting only brings more curiosity. \n\n\tDirected by Gregg Araki and co-starring Cooper Hoffman and Johnny Knoxville, the Sundance-bound project signals something transgressive — an erotic thriller, warped with satire of desire and power. Araki’s taste for queasy intimacy and emotional provocation suggests the film won’t play it safe. The real intrigue is whether Wilde leans into the discomfort and uses the role to challenge audience expectations and reframe how she’s seen onscreen. She’s also busy this year with Tony Gilroy’s “Behemoth!” and another Sundance feature, this time directed by herself, “The Invite,” which she also stars.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJenny Slate — ‘Carousel’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJenny Slate has spent years proving she’s more than comedic timing (i.e., “Obvious Child”), and “Carousel” could cement that shift. Written and directed by Rachel Lambert (“Sometimes I Think About Dying”), the Sundance-bound romantic drama follows a divorced doctor (Chris Pine) whose carefully constructed life in Cleveland is upended when his daughter’s debate aspirations and the unexpected return of a past love (Slate) force him to confront his choices and embrace a second chance. Is this an indie that can break out louder than others? Many seem to think so.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTom Rhys Harries — ‘Clayface’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tTom Rhys Harries stepping into “Clayface” puts him at the center of one of DC Studios’ most compelling wild cards. A character who can be monstrous, tragic and weirdly relatable all at once, Clayface isn’t a standard cape-and-hero gig, rather an anti-hero (or outright villain) whose power is pure nightmare fuel. He uses shape-shifting, body horror and identity-as-weapon. That’s prime territory for a breakout performance because it demands a bit more than swagger. Harries could turn Clayface into the kind of fan-favorite villain audiences obsess over.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tIsabella Rossellini — ‘The Duchess and I’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Christopher Polk/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tNow officially an Oscar nominee, Isabella Rossellini will play Suzanne Blum in Mike Newell’s “The Duchess and I.” Blum was the enigmatic lawyer who controlled access to the Duchess of Windsor in her final years, a figure both protective and possibly predatory. This is going to bring royal intrigue with Rossellini at the center, and Newell gives her a character study instead of just a supporting turn, bringing a massive amount of excitement.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEwan McGregor — ‘Flowervale Street’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tDavid Robert Mitchell directing Ewan McGregor? Yes, please.\n\n\tA look at a 1980s family noticing bizarre happenings in their neighborhood could build slow, mounting dread and tension. Still without an Oscar nomination on his resume (despite “Moulin Rouge,” “Trainspotting” and more), he’s often most effective when playing decency under pressure — the normal guy who realizes the world isn’t everyday. Opposite Anne Hathaway, if “Flowervale Street” leans into paranoia or horror-adjacent tension, McGregor can anchor it with credibility and warmth, which only makes the darkness hit harder. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSadie Sink — ‘Spider-Man: Brand New Day’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Eamonn McCormack/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSaying farewell to “Stranger Things,” Sadie Sink joining the “Spider-Man” machine is instant buzz. She’s the kind of actor who can smuggle emotion into franchise architecture. She’s building the type of résumé that makes an eventual awards push feel inevitable (i.e., “The Whale”). If her role is substantial — and not just a plot device — she could become the movie’s surprise heartbeat, and the grounded human counterweight to multiverse noise alongside star Tom Holland.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNick Jonas — ‘Power Ballad’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tLearning that Paul Rudd will star in John Carney’s “Power Ballad” got most of us excited for the next joint from the director of “Once” and “Begin Again.” Add Nick Jonas to the mix, and the Lionsgate comedy could have laughs, melancholy, nostalgia, ego, regret, and maybe a late-life second chance. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMilly Alcock — ‘Supergirl’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Parisa Taghizadeh/Warner Bros.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tMilly Alcock stepping into the cape as Supergirl is DC Studios’ bet on presence over name recognition. Alcock proved she could command attention in “House of the Dragon,” but playing Kara Zor-El requires balancing power with vulnerability, and strength with hope — a tonal tightrope that can make or break a superhero franchise. Directed by Craig Gillespie, “Supergirl” needs to feel distinct from Superman’s shadow, and Alcock has the charisma to make that happen if the script gives her room to be more than just super.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJacob Elordi — ‘The Dog Stars’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Variety via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tComing off “Frankenstein,” Jacob Elordi continues pushing beyond heartthrob perception, and “The Dog Stars” reads like a project designed to stress-test his dramatic credibility. If it’s a survival story or a mood-driven character study, Elordi’s best lane is playing toughness with a visible crack underneath. The proper performance in the right film can push him to superstardom, especially if the project lands with critics. The 28-year-old Australian actor will also play Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell’s “Wuthering Heights” and reprise his role as Nate Jacobs in the final season of the hit TV show “Euphoria.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tZazie Beetz — ‘They Will Kill You’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Nina Westervelt for Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tZazie Beetz has the rare ability to be magnetic without overselling, perfect for a tension-driven film like “They Will Kill You.” She consistently gets cited as the reason scenes work — and a lead role built around threat and survival could finally put her center stage. If the film balances fear with character depth, Beetz can make it feel specific rather than generic. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNicholas Galitzine — ‘Masters of the Universe’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tNicholas Galitzine has the power! Stepping into the shoes (and underwear) of Dolph Lundgren as He-Man has obvious franchise upside: Potential global exposure, instant iconography and a ready-made fan base. Galitzine’s recent work suggests he can do sincerity without being corny, which matters for a property that could easily slip into camp. The anticipation is whether Galitzine can make the hero feel human enough to care about, not just strong enough to pose. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLily-Rose Depp — ‘Werwulf’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Corbis via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tRobert Eggers making a werewolf film was already a headline. Lily-Rose Depp as a key player inside that world, alongside Aaron Taylor-Johnson, adds extra fascination because Eggers tends to demand total commitment and emotional specificity even in myth. She’s been chasing boundary-pushing projects that could reframe her as a serious performer in the right director’s hands. If “Werwulf” blends body horror with tragedy — as Eggers often does brilliantly — Depp could be a force to be reckoned with.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKJ Apa — ‘Jimmy’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJames Stewart is an icon who feels impossible to play. That’s what makes KJ Apa’s casting in the biopic “Jimmy” so intriguing. Directed by Aaron Burns, the drama could be a safe tribute or a genuine attempt to locate the darkness beneath Stewart’s aw-shucks charm. Apa seems to have charisma but has yet to have a breakout film role. Could this be his big arrival?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAnne Hathaway — ‘Verity’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Kristina Bumphrey/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tOscar winner Anne Hathaway knows how to weaponize likability, then dismantle it. Directed by Michael Showalter, “Verity” follows writer Lowen Ashleigh (Dakota Johnson), hired to complete bestselling author Verity Crawford’s book series after a mysterious accident. Co-starring Josh Hartnett, the Colleen Hoover adaptation could make Hathaway’s “Verity” a mainstream obsession and the kind of turn that fuels memes, think pieces and awards chatter. She also has roles as Penelope in Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey,” reprising her beloved Andy Sachs in “The Devil Wears Prada 2,” the titular character in David Lowery’s “Mother Mary” and “Flowervale Street” opposite Ewan McGregor — all cementing an absolutely massive year. Queen Anne continues to reign.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDaniel Kaluuya — ‘Misty Green’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDaniel Kaluuya, an Oscar winner for “Judas and the Black Messiah,” has an excellent record of choosing material that carries an idea — social tension (“Judas and the Black Messiah”), dread (“Widows”), moral consequence (“Nope”) — without losing human stakes. The upcoming “Misty Green” sounds atmospheric, maybe even genre-adjacent, which is where Kaluuya’s coiled intensity hits hardest. If the film leans toward the psychological or the allegorical, he can make that feel urgent rather than abstract. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNatalie Portman — ‘The Gallerist’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Getty\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tOscar winner Natalie Portman excels when playing a character with a pressure point. Directed by Cathy Yan, “The Gallerist” follows gallerist Polina Polinski preparing for her Art Basel premiere when an art influencer’s viral critique attracts a legendary dealer, igniting the ruthless art world machine. Co-starring Zach Galifianakis, Da’Vine Joy Randolph and Catherine Zeta-Jones, the dark comedy thriller makes perfect terrain for Portman. She’ll also have a role in Lena Dunham’s “Good Sex.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAnya Taylor-Joy — ‘Dune: Part Three’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit:  Samir Hussein/WireImage\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tEmmy nominee Anya Taylor-Joy fully stepping into Alia Atreides has massive upside. Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune” world rewards performers who can play grand ideas without losing the human thread, and Taylor-Joy’s presence is built for that balance. It’s ethereal but cutting, and vulnerable yet dangerous. If “Dune: Part Three” leans into Alia’s complexity, she could become the film’s most fascinating element, especially for viewers ready for a new focal point beyond Paul. This is a blockbuster spectacle with a genuine performance opportunity.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEthan Hawke — ‘The Weight’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tEthan Hawke, a four-time Oscar nominee, is generating serious awards heat for playing Lorenz Hart in “Blue Moon.” The upcoming drama “The Weight” — directed by Padraic McKinley and co-starring Julia Jones and Russell Crowe — drops him into 1930s Oregon as Samuel Murphy, a widower estranged from his daughter who becomes entangled with gold smugglers and an unscrupulous criminal. It’s Western-adjacent character Hawke that can easily inhabit. If the film leans into silence and weathered faces rather than genre convention, Hawke can build something truly memorable.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEmma Mackey — ‘The Chronicles of Narnia: The Magician’s Nephew’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tGreta Gerwig taking on “Narnia” for Netflix automatically raises the artistic stakes, and Emma Mackey landing a key role reads like a director-driven bet on presence. Mackey has the charisma to carry franchise scale without feeling manufactured, which matters in fantasy worlds that can turn actors into walking costumes. If Gerwig brings her key specificity to the material and Mackey is positioned as a central human anchor, this could be a star-making moment.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSacha Baron Cohen — ‘Ladies First’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Variety via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDirected by Thea Sharrock for Netflix, “Ladies Night” is a black-and-white rom-com that follows a male chauvinist who finds himself in an alternate world where the power dynamics of society are altered — a premise loosely inspired by the 2018 French film “I Am Not an Easy Man.” Co-starring Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant, the film has the setup for sharp social satire, and Sacha Baron Cohen’s willingness to push material past comfort is the main selling point. If the film skews darker or more biting beneath the comedy, Baron Cohen has the skill to make the laughs land and still leave a bruise.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCate Blanchett — ‘Sweetstick’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Sweetstick” follows a mercurial woman with a strange and piercing gift — the ability to see what others most intimately need, often at high personal cost. The premise has a fairy-tale structure with a psychological edge, and two-time Oscar winner Cate Blanchett excels at playing characters who carry burdens that appear to be blessings. Alice Burch’s directorial debut suggests something deceptively gentle, possibly hiding cruelty, and a tonal ambiguity where Blanchett does her most commanding work. Blanchett also has a role in David and Nathan Zellner’s “Alpha Gang” alongside Riley Keough and Chris Pine.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tChanning Tatum — ‘Josephine’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Greta Zozula\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDespite outstanding turns in “Foxcatcher” and the underrated “Roofman,” It seems Hollywood is still underestimating the great Channing Tatum. Directed by Beth de Araujo and co-starring Gemma Chan, “Josephine” follows 8-year-old Josephine, who accidentally witnesses a crime in Golden Gate Park and acts out in search of a way to regain control of her safety. Tatum proved he can be more than a movie star. A role centered on childhood trauma and powerlessness would test his range and get people to notice. Reprising his version of Gambit in “Avengers: Doomsday” next year will surely get people’s attention as well.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDaisy Edgar-Jones — ‘Sense and Sensibility’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Kering\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJane Austen roles are deceptively hard. Daisy Edgar-Jones built her reputation on intimacy and emotional clarity, which makes her a strong fit for Austen’s romantic volatility. Austen always sells, and Ang Lee’s 1995 “Sense and Sensibility” earned seven Oscar nominations, including best picture — but the anticipation is whether this version from director Georgia Oakley feels fresh and whether Edgar-Jones finds something new inside a character audiences think they already know (which was prominently played by Emma Thompson).\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKendrick Lamar — ‘Whitney Springs’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tKendrick Lamar stepping into a feature role is instant curiosity. His artistry is already cinematic. What’s unknown is whether “Whitney Springs” asks him to act against his own persona or lean into it. Either approach has upside if the material is genuine and the direction is disciplined. Directed by “South Park” mastermind Trey Parker, the film follows a young Black man who is interning as a slave re-enactor at a living history museum and discovers that his white girlfriend’s ancestors once owned his. Cultural attention is guaranteed on this one.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCameron Diaz — ‘Outcome’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Swan Gallet/WWD\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCameron Diaz’s return to acting makes “Outcome” a potential home run before anyone sees a frame. Her star power and comedic timing are undeniable (i.e., “Charlie’s Angels” and “Being John Malkovich”), and a comeback role can generate real momentum if the project lets her do more than just “return.” Directed by Jonah Hill and co-starring Keanu Reeves, the black comedy should give Diaz room to surprise, and Hill’s directorial sensibility tends to balance absurdity with emotional stakes (“Mid 90s”). She also appears in Netflix’s “Back Monday” later this year.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tChristian Bale — ‘The Bride!’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Maggie Gyllenhaal/Niko Tavernise/Instagram\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tOscar winner Christian Bale consistently embraces a difficult, uncomfortable transformation, and Maggie Gyllenhaal’s Frankenstein reimagining sounds engineered for maximal swing. If “The Bride!” blends politics, horror and musical ambition, that pain of the Creature could land harder than expected. What adds extra intrigue is Bale’s second major play this year in “Madden,” playing Al Davis, a famous public figure. If “The Bride!” works, Bale could be in the conversation twice for completely different reasons. His co-star Jessie Buckley was on this list in 2025.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRyan Gosling — ‘Project Hail Mary’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Screenshot courtesy YouTube/Amazon MGM\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe buzz has already started on this one. Ryan Gosling is a three-time Oscar nominee who thrived playing intelligence under pressure. Andy Weir’s story gives him both. With Phil Lord and Christopher Miller directing, the big question is tone, and if the film can balance humor with genuine dread. Gosling can, and the early word is the film does. If handled right, this crowd-pleaser also plays as serious acting work, generating meme energy and awards chatter simultaneously, which is rare.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKristen Stewart — ‘The Wrong Girls’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for The Gotham Film\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tKristen Stewart’s best work lives in the discomfort, where her characters won’t fit inside the story they’re handed. An Oscar nominee for “Spencer” and coming off a strong directorial debut with “The Chronology of Water,” Stewart is a real treat anytime she’s given material with some edges, and “The Wrong Girls,” a Neon comedy by her real-life partner Dylan Meyer, could be an interesting vehicle.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCaitríona Balfe — ‘A Long Winter’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: CAITLIN CRONENBERG\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCaitríona Balfe is ready for more. Directed by Andrew Haigh (“All of Us Strangers”) and adapted from Colm Tóibín’s short story, “A Long Winter” follows a family high in the mountains preparing for winter when a mother storms out after fighting with her husband, heading to her brother’s distant home as a blizzard engulfs the region. Co-starring Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Kit Connor and Fred Hechinger, Balfe’s performance could resonate with critics who value restraint and the kind of quiet, deliberate work that positions an actor for serious consideration.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDenzel Washington — ‘Here Comes the Flood’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Brian Bowen Smith for Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDenzel Washington doesn’t need a comeback. He never left. “Here Comes the Flood” offers the icon a heist film directed by Fernando Meirelles and written by Simon Kinberg. Washington plays a bank guard caught in a deadly game of cons and double crosses alongside Robert Pattinson and Daisy Edgar-Jones. Washington has two Oscars and remains one of the few actors who can elevate any material into something weightier. Will Washington play the mentor, the villain or both?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCharles Melton — ‘Saturn Return’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCharles Melton has been working and building since his breakout in “May December.” In “Saturn Return,” directed by Greg Kwedar, he could have the role that solidifies his place in the movies. The film follows two Chicago college sweethearts (Melton and Rachel Brosnahan) over a decade as they navigate the complexities of adulthood and fate tests their youthful dreams. Also co-starring Will Poulter, Melton has the sensitivity for long-form storytelling, and a decade-spanning character study gives him room to show range. He also has a role in Nicolas Winding Refn’s “Her Private Life.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPenélope Cruz — ‘The Invite’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Xavi Gordo for Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tOscar winner Penélope Cruz (“Vicky Cristina Barcelona”) has the smile that feels like a warning, and the vulnerability that reads as strategy. Directed by Olivia Wilde and written by Rashida Jones and Will McCormack, “The Invite” is an English-language remake of Cesc Gay’s “The People Upstairs.” It follows a married couple experiencing a rough patch who find themselves invited by their neighbors to engage in their weekly orgies. Also starring Seth Rogen, Edward Norton and Wilde, Cruz could balance elegance with volatility in a sex comedy that sounds deliciously watchable and awards-friendly.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAnthony Ippolito — ‘I Play Rocky’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Amazon/MGM\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tPlaying Sylvester Stallone in a film about refusing to sell “Rocky” without starring in it is a high-wire act. But if Peter Farrelly frames the story as an underdog drama with stakes, actor Anthony Ippolito has a real breakout lane, especially if the role emphasizes hunger, pride and desperation over simple mimicry. With Stephan James as Carl Weathers and Jay Duplass as John Avildsen, the supporting cast brings a character-forward approach. The anticipation is whether Ippolito finds the humanity in it all.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKeke Palmer — ‘I Love Boosters’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tKeke Palmer has the audience connection and presence that feels automatic. Directed by Boots Riley, “I Love Boosters” follows a group of shoplifters who target a cutthroat fashion maven. Palmer can deliver comedy with bite while grounding the story emotionally (i.e., “Nope”), and Riley’s anti-capitalist sensibility should give her room to swing between humor and heartbreak. Palmer is a star you want to hang out with, even when the character is messy.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHugh Jackman — ‘The Death of Robin Hood’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Marc Hom for Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tRevisionist Robin Hood gives Oscar nominee Hugh Jackman a role with built-in mythology and mortality, and he’s excellent at playing strength that’s starting to fail. If the film leans into regret and consequence rather than swashbuckling, Jackman could turn out a surprisingly emotional turn, perhaps similar to what he gave us with “Logan.” What does it cost to be a legend when the legend runs out? For audiences, it’s an easy sell — Jackman in heroic mode — but the real anticipation is how dark (or compelling) it gets.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMichelle Williams — ‘A Place in Hell’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“She’s gotta win an Oscar one day, right?”\n\n\tMichelle Williams is the type of actress who garners that very question by cinephiles and Oscar enthusiasts every year. A five-time Oscar nominee who turns quiet suffering into something piercing but never showy. Written and directed by Chloe Domont (“Fair Play”), “A Place in Hell” follows two women at a high-profile criminal law firm with a setup that could bring moral compromise, ambition and the kind of psychological pressure Domont explored in her debut. Alongside Daisy Edgar-Jones and Andrew Scott, Williams can make that tension feel unnervingly personal. If the film leans into the ethical rot of corporate law (timely!), she can keep it human even as the stakes turn allegorical.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCillian Murphy — ‘Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCillian Murphy returning as Tommy Shelby has many in line, ready to throw their money to see it on the big screen. Fresh off an Oscar win for “Oppenheimer,” Murphy has the rare ability that turns any major role into an event. Directed by Tom Harper and written by Steven Knight, “Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man” continues the series with new additions Rebecca Ferguson, Barry Keoghan and Tim Roth. The anticipation is whether this is a closing chapter or the final self-destruction for the iconic character.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEmily Blunt — ‘Disclosure Day’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Universal Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tEmily Blunt is an Oscar nominee (“Oppenheimer”) who’s effective at playing competence under stress. Directed by Steven Spielberg, “Disclosure Day” centers on alien contact, with the trailer posing a pointed question: If you found out we weren’t alone, if someone showed you and proved it to you, would that frighten you? It’s classic Spielberg territory with wonder mixed with suspense. Blunt is the ideal actor to anchor that tension. She can ground the spectacle without diminishing it. Let’s not forget, she’s also in “The Devil Wears Prada 2,” reprising a character we all love.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJohn Malkovich — ‘Wild Horse Nine’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJohn Malkovich earned Oscar noms for “Places in the Heart” and “In the Line of Fire” over 30 years ago, and he’s never won — which means he’s precisely the kind of actor the Academy loves to correct when the role is big enough. Martin McDonagh writing for Malkovich is the pairing that could produce something genuinely unsettling. “Wild Horse Nine,” set during the 1973 Chilean coup and following two CIA agents on a trust-testing mission from Santiago to Easter Island, sounds like a breeding ground for paranoia, betrayal and dialogue-driven tension McDonagh does best. The ensemble includes Sam Rockwell, Parker Posey and Steve Buscemi, and if Malkovich’s role carries weight, this could be his J.K. Simmons-in-“Whiplash” or James Coburn a la “Affliction” moment.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMichelle Mao — ‘Zi’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Sundance\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tMichelle Mao will anchor Kogonada’s latest “Zi,” premiering at the Sundance Film Festival. Written and directed by the auteur, the sci-fi drama follows a young woman in Hong Kong haunted by visions of her future self who meets a stranger who changes the course of her night — and possibly her life. Co-starring Haley Lu Richardson and Jin Ha, the film is Kogonada’s follow-up to “After Yang” and positions Mao as a newcomer capable of carrying philosophical weight. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tColman Domingo — ‘Michael’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tColman Domingo playing Joe Jackson in Antoine Fuqua’s Michael Jackson biopic invites heat and potential acclaim. A two-time Oscar nominee (“Rustin” and “Sing Sing”), Domingo projects warmth and menace in the same breath, which matters for a figure as controversial as Joe. Starring the King of Pop’s real-life nephew Jaafar Jackson, if the film avoids caricature, Domingo could deliver a turn that becomes the movie’s moral engine. Not a villain, or a saint, but a complicated force shaping genius and trauma. His co-star, Nia Long, was on this list in 2025 before the delay and reshoots. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMargot Robbie — ‘Wuthering Heights’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Warner Bros\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tOscar winner Emerald Fennell’s take on Catherine Earnshaw has the kind of combustible setup that turns a literary role into a full-blown event with romance, cruelty, obsession and ego, all with Robbie at the center. A two-time Oscar nominee for “I, Tonya” and “Bombshell,” Robbie is at her best when a character’s charm and self-destruction are locked in the same room — and this part is built for that. Playing opposite Jacob Elordi only sharpens the pop-culture hook.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAndrew Garfield — ‘Artificial’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Penske Media via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tOscar nominee Andrew Garfield playing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, directed by Luca Guadagnino, could be a timely look at a man changing the world. “Artificial” follows the confusing firing-and-rehiring cycle at OpenAI, where the board gained control and removed Altman before he returned. Garfield excels at ambition laced with vulnerability, and with Monica Barbaro as Mira Murati and Ike Barinholtz as Elon Musk, the film has Oscar energy. The question is whether Guadagnino turns boardroom chaos into something cinematic (and hopefully, not too long a runtime). Garfield will also appear in Ben Gregor’s “The Magic Faraway Tree” and Paul Greengrass’ “The Uprising.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJulianne Moore — ‘Untitled Jesse Eisenberg Musical’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Alexi Lubomirski for Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJulianne Moore playing a shy woman losing herself in community theater sounds like Jesse Eisenberg canon. The Oscar winner excels at characters losing control, and a musical comedy about transformation under an enigmatic director gives Moore room to be funny, vulnerable and slightly unhinged. Co-starring Paul Giamatti, Halle Bailey and Bernadette Peters, the A24 production could be an immersive experience. Moore will also appear in Robert Schwentke’s psychological thriller “Control.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRobert Downey Jr. — ‘Avengers: Doomsday’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Variety via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tMarvel’s most significant swing in years is also its simplest pitch. Let’s bring back Robert Downey Jr. \n\n\tWhile the hook isn’t nostalgia, Downey, once the face of Iron Man, is stepping into the villain Doctor Victor von Doom. If the Russo Brothers balance comic-book scale with character psychology, Downey’s charisma could make Doom feel more than a gimmick. Coming off his Oscar win for “Oppenheimer,” Downey is at his best when he’s threading charm through danger. This is either a franchise reset or a real possible franchise killer. We’re hopeful it’s the former.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKara Young — ‘Is God Is’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Kristina Bumphrey/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tTony winner Kara Young’s turn in “Is God Is” promises confrontation. Written and directed by Aleshea Harris in her feature debut, the film adapts Harris’ Obie-winning play about twin sisters with disfiguring burn scars who are ordered by their bedridden mother to kill their abusive father. Co-starring Mallori Johnson, Sterling K. Brown, Vivica A. Fox and Janelle Monáe, the Amazon MGM film is said to preserve the source material’s mythic violence. Young’s performance could be physically committed and emotionally unsparing, and make the Broadway darling a household name.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAndrew Scott — ‘Pressure’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images f\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAndrew Scott has been building toward this moment. It’s a role whose title already promises collapse and prestige. Scott’s gift is showing emotion in real time without turning it into “acting.” His recent work, such as “Blue Moon” and “All of Us Strangers,” has moved him into the Oscar conversation, and a project like Anthony Maras’ period drama “Pressure” could finally break through. With co-stars Brendan Fraser and Kerry Condon, this could be a moment similar to Benedict Cumberbatch’s in “The Imitation Game.” The Irish star will also have a role in Chloe Domont’s “A Place in Hell.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKeanu Reeves — ‘The Entertainment System is Down’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: John Nacion/Variety\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tI don’t know about you guys, but I’m ready for the Oscars to embrace Keanu Reeves. After being a scene-stealer in Aziz Ansari’s comedy “Good Fortune,” the dream of that happening seems feasible with the star in Ruben Östlund’s “The Entertainment System is Down” opposite Kirsten Dunst, bringing them into the world of social chaos and satire. Reeves’ sincerity colliding with Östlund’s cruelty, and if the film leans into discomfort and class absurdity, Reeves could deliver a funnier performance, stranger and more pointed than audiences expect. He also has a role in Jonah Hill’s “Outcome.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAriana Grande — ‘Focker-in-Law’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images for Universal Pictu\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAriana Grande has spent years proving she can act, and “Focker-in-Law” might be the role that makes Hollywood take her seriously beyond musicals. Following her Oscar-nominated turn in “Wicked” (and an impending one in “Wicked: For Good”), Grande plays the strong-willed woman who appears to be a complete mismatch for Henry Focker, son of Greg and Pam. The premise is pure comedic chaos, and Grande has the timing to hold her own in a franchise built on awkward family dynamics.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMatt Damon — ‘The Odyssey’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Universal Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tChristopher Nolan casting Matt Damon as Odysseus could be blockbuster poetry. An Oscar winner known for grounded humanity is playing the ultimate wanderer. Damon’s key asset is credibility. He can sell suffering, cunning and exhaustion without mythological posing. Nolan’s films don’t usually revolve around showy performances, but they reward actors who can carry emotional weight within a big structure (hello “Oppenheimer”). Damon also brings the meta-history of “Matt Damon stuck somewhere” roles, which makes the premise instantly accessible. The cast is also incredibly promising with Tom Holland, Benny Safdie, Zendaya and more. Damon also has Netflix’s “The Rip” in the first half of the year alongside his best friend Ben Affleck.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tScarlett Johansson — ‘Paper Tiger’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tMany of us die-hard James Gray fans are waiting for his big Oscar vehicle. “Paper Tiger” could be it.\n\n\tScarlett Johansson, a two-time Oscar nominee, excels at duality, projecting control while quietly signaling fracture. If the film plays as a corporate thriller, political drama or psychological pressure cooker, Johansson, alongside co-stars Adam Driver and Miles Teller, has the precision to make the stakes feel personal rather than generic. This could be the kind of role that rewards a complete emotional arc, and one that can linger beyond plot mechanics. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDominic Sessa — ‘Tony’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Wheaton Mahoney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDominic Sessa arrives at “Tony” with expectations already attached. Directed by Matt Johnson (“BlackBerry”) and written by Todd Bartels and Lou Howe, the A24 Anthony Bourdain biopic follows the young chef during the summer of 1976 in Provincetown, Massachusetts — a formative, life-changing period documented in “Kitchen Confidential.” Co-starring Antonio Banderas, Emilia Jones and Leo Woodall, the film explores Bourdain’s early years working in seafood restaurants. Following his breakout in “The Holdovers,” Sessa’s naturalism could bring something more complex if the film gives him space to challenge himself.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJeremy Strong — ‘The Social Reckoning’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIf Aaron Sorkin’s sequel “The Social Reckoning” represents the next evolution of tech anxiety on screen, Jeremy Strong feels like a deliberate choice. He’s a performer who treats obsession as a belief system. The Oscar nominee and Emmy winner can be magnetic when the material matches his intensity, and stepping into Mark Zuckerberg’s shoes — following Jesse Eisenberg’s Oscar-nominated turn in 2010 — gives him plenty of combustible ground. Paired with Jeremy Allen White and Mikey Madison, and assuming the film leans into political and ethical friction, Strong’s refusal to sand down edges could place him at the center of the conversation. Love him or resist him, this is a performance people will talk about.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tZendaya — ‘The Drama’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: A24\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSet to be distributed by A24, “The Drama” follows Emma Harwood (Zendaya), a bookstore clerk, and Charlie Thompson (Robert Pattinson), a museum director, whose relationship is shaken days before their wedding when one partner discovers unsettling truths about the other. The Emmy winner is still chasing her first Oscar nomination, and this feels like the project that could get her there if it’s as psychologically sharp as the title suggests. She’s also back as MJ in “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” and stepping into Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey” as Athena. “The Drama” reads like the grown-up swing by the young star.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSebastian Stan — ‘Fjord’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: AFP via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tComing off his first Oscar bid for “The Apprentice,” Sebastian Stan has been chasing austerity, and “Fjord” — directed by Cristian Mungiu and co-starring Renate Reinsve — puts him squarely in the territory where discomfort becomes art. The film follows an immigrant Romanian family living in Norway who become subject to an investigation. It’s Mungiu’s terrain that shows systems that crush people, and the moral ambiguity presented without sentiment. Stan thrives when he’s stripped of charm, and this setup should let him work in a register that’s more Dardenne brothers than Marvel. The question is not whether he can handle it, it’s whether American audiences will follow him somewhere this seemingly unforgiving.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKate Mara and Rooney Mara — ‘Bucking Fastard’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Katie Jones/WWD\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tTwo talented sisters playing synchronized twins under Werner Herzog is the pitch that sells itself. Written and directed by Herzog, “Bucking Fastard” follows twin sisters Jean and Joan Holbrooke who, in search of an imaginary land where true love is possible, start digging a tunnel through a mountain range. If the characters share an obsession and Herzog leans into myth over realism, this could be eerie, funny, unsettling and weirdly moving. Whether Kate and Rooney Mara can create a single shared presence while still feeling like two distinct human beings will be what lingers until we see it.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBrad Pitt — ‘The Adventures of Cliff Booth’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Columbia Pictures/courtesy Everett Co / Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDavid Fincher directing a Quentin Tarantino script about Cliff Booth is instant film-geek rapture. It’s also a fascinating challenge for Pitt, who won the Oscar for best supporting actor playing Booth in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” (2019). Fincher tends to strip vanity from stars, while Tarantino weaponizes it. That tension could turn Pitt’s easygoing stuntman into something coiled and volatile, especially if the story leans into Hollywood’s rot instead of its romance. Pitt’s also reuniting with David Ayer for “Heart of the Beast” later this year.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMeryl Streep — ‘The Devil Wears Prada 2’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tMiranda Priestly endures as one of Meryl Streep’s most quotable creations, and now she’s being revisited with purpose. The three-time Oscar winner, with 21 nominations, has always excelled at turning authority into loneliness and comedy into cruelty. With David Frankel back directing and Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci returning, the fascination lies in watching Streep recalibrate Miranda for a world that commodifies icons and discards them just as quickly. Fashion has changed. Power has changed. The question is whether Miranda has.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPedro Pascal — ‘Behometh!’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tPedro Pascal has become a rare modern movie star whose name alone signals both mainstream reach and emotional credibility. “Behometh!” (exclamation included) could be something big, strange or swaggering. Pascal is unusually adept at giving spectacle a beating heart. His gift is making toughness look exhausted and tenderness feel hard-earned. Under the writing and direction of Tony Gilroy (“Michael Clayton”), the project carries the promise of character-first ambition. Pascal also has an enormous year ahead, including “Avengers: Doomsday” as Mister Fantastic, a return to “Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu,” and the possibility of Todd Haynes’ “De Noche,” now in development.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTom Cruise — ‘Digger’\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFour-time Oscar nominee Tom Cruise hasn’t worked with a director this uncompromising in years. Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s “Digger” casts Cruise as Digger Rockwell in a dark comedy co-written with Sabina Berman, Alexander Dinelaris Jr. and Nicolás Giacobone. Alongside Jesse Plemons, Sandra Hüller and John Goodman, the film could push Cruise toward intensity rather than pure stunt mastery. Coming immediately after his Honorary Oscar, will he go the way of Paul Newman and win an overdue statuette? The universe would love nothing more.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to Watch the 2026 World Junior Hockey Championships Online Free\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBell & Ross Will Be Land Rover’s Official Timekeeper for the Dakar Rally\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon vs. YouTube, Other Tech Battles Reshaping Sports in 2026\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t“RRR” director S.S. Rajamouli‘s next directorial venture “Varanasi” has unveiled a worldwide theatrical release date, positioning the Indian production as one of 2027’s major international releases.\n\n\tThe action-adventure epic reunites the “RRR” helmer with Oscar-winning composer MM Keeravani, who took home the Academy Award for best original song for “Naatu Naatu” from “RRR.” Telugu-language cinema Mahesh Babu leads the cast alongside Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Prithviraj Sukumaran.\n\t\n\n\tThe film’s story spans thousands of years and traverses multiple continents, with locations ranging from Antarctica to Africa to the titular Indian city. It is “in the vein of Indiana Jones and James Bond,” according to the film’s publicity material. Mahesh Babu plays the protagonist Rudhra, Chopra Jonas plays a character named Mandakini and the main antagonist Kumbha is played by Sukumaran. Rajamouli unveiled first-look footage from the project in November.\n\n\n\t“Varanasi” will open in theaters worldwide on April 7, 2027.\n\n\tRajamouli’s “RRR” became a global phenomenon following its 2022 release, earning widespread critical acclaim and audience enthusiasm that extended well beyond traditional Indian cinema markets, with the film’s Academy Awards success marking a milestone for Indian cinema on the international stage. It is the fifth-highest grossing film in the history of Indian cinema.\n\n\tBabu is one of Indian cinema’s biggest stars, with a career spanning over two decades in Telugu-language films including “Srimanthudu,” “Bharat Ane Nenu” and “Maharshi.”\n\n\tChopra Jonas has built a career bridging Bollywood and Hollywood, with Bollywood credits including “Bajirao Mastani,” “Mary Kom” and “Barfi!,” while her Hollywood work includes the series “Citadel” and films such as “Baywatch” and “The Matrix Resurrections.”\n\t\n\n\tSukumaran is a pan-Indian star who has worked across Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu and Hindi-language cinema, with recent credits including the Telugu action drama “Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire,” the Bollywood film “Bade Miyan Chote Miyan” and Malayalam film “The Goat Life.”\n\n\tThe project is being produced under the banner of Sri Durga Arts and Showing Business. Producers include K.L. Narayana and S.S. Karthikeya. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tKevin Couch, a veteran live entertainment exec and musician, was announced as the head of artistic programming at the newly rechristened Trump Kennedy Center on Jan. 16. Less than two weeks later, Couch has stepped down from the post. \n\n\tCouch confirmed that he resigned from the Kennedy Center position in statements to the Washington Post and New York Times; he did not provide a reason for his decision to quit. Reps for the Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\t\n\n\tThe Kennedy Center’s previous head of programming was Jeffrey Finn, who quit in September 2025 after nearly 10 years leading the center’s touring Broadway shows and locally produced musicals.\n\n\n\tCouch’s exit from the Kennedy Center comes amid a tumultuous past several months for the D.C. arts institution. Last month, the White House claimed that the Kennedy Center board of trustees — who were handpicked by President Trump — voted unanimously to rename the facility the “Trump Kennedy Center.” (The full new name, which is being disputed, is “The Donald J. Trump and John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”) Legal experts say the renaming of the center is illegal, because a 1964 federal law established its name as “The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts” after the slain president and explicitly prohibits the board of trustees from adding any other name to the building’s exterior.\n\n\tSince the Trump Kennedy Center renaming was announced, multiple artists have canceled their scheduled performances at the center, including Philip Glass, Renée Fleming, “Wicked” composer Stephen Schwartz, Béla Fleck and a production of “Hamilton.”\n\t\n\n\tCouch had been announced as joining the Kennedy Center as senior VP of artistic programming. “A visionary entertainment leader, Couch brings over two decades of experience in artist management, global booking, and high-level brand partnerships to this senior leadership role at America’s cultural center,” the organization said in the Jan. 16 announcement. At the time, Couch said in a statement: “I am honored to join the Trump Kennedy Center at such a pivotal moment for the performing arts. I look forward to the extraordinary creative possibilities ahead — championing our artists and partners to deliver meaningful experiences at America’s cultural center.”\n\n\tPrior to joining the Kennedy Center, Couch most recently served as director of programming for ATG Entertainment, overseeing a portfolio of venues including in San Antonio, Tulsa and Little Rock. In that role, he led the booking of music, comedy and non-theatrical programming, presenting artists and events such as Sabrina Carpenter, Carlos Santana, ZZ Top, Diana Ross, Nate Bargatze and Joe Rogan’s Netflix special “Burn the Boats” at the Majestic Theatre San Antonio. Prior to ATG, Couch founded CBC Creative, a Dallas-based branding agency.\n\n\tCouch has also managed the careers of several national touring acts across multiple genres, most notably the ’90s R&B group Color Me Badd. In addition, Couch has performed as a drummer for various artists and was part of the Vans Warped Tour.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKatt Williams is returning to Netflix with his fourth stand-up comedy special for the streamer, premiering on Feb. 10.\n\n\tTitled “The Last Report,” the hour will see Williams delivering his bold takes on conspiracies, celebrities and the world at large, per Netflix. It follows Williams’ 2024 special, “Woke Foke,” as well as 2022’s “World War III” and 2018’s “Great America.”\n\n\tIn the trailer for “The Last Report,” Williams jokes about living on a farm, saying he “bought all the animals that was delicious,” like cows, pigs and chickens. “Everything that made a cracklin’, I bought it.”\n\t\n\n\tHe says he’s owned the farm for four years and hasn’t killed a single animal yet. “I’m supposed to eat these?” he wails in his signature high-pitched voice. “These my friends, bitch!”\n\n\n\t“The Last Report” is directed by Troy Miller, who is an executive producer alongside Michelle Nguyen for Dakota Pictures, plus Williams, William Lee and Brian Alden.\n\n\tWilliams will represent at the streamer’s biennial Netflix Is a Joke Fest, which takes place in Los Angeles from May 4 to 10, with a performance at the Intuit Dome. The festival will feature more than 350 live events, including a comedy competition hosted by Kevin Hart, a discussion about the best “Seinfeld” episodes with Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, John Mulaney at the Hollywood Bowl, Seth Rogen at the Greek Theater, a Lizzo-hosted comedy event, a tribute to Pee-wee Herman, a Dodgers Comedy Night, Nate Bargatze at the Intuit Dome, a Flight of the Conchords reunion and much more. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tCritical Role game master Matthew Mercer and Dropout’s “Dimension 20” host Brennan Lee Mulligan are at the top of a media machine their 10-year-old selves never dreamed would exist: playing D&D.\n\n\tSitting down to interview each other for Variety earlier this month at Critical Role’s studio in Burbank, where they are both currently filming Campaign 4, Mulligan and Mercer broke down their rise to nontraditional fame and glory through “actual-play” shows that feature them and their castmates as they play through Dungeons & Dragons-style roleplaying campaigns.\n\t\n\n\t“Where my sense of ambition lives is in that moment at the table where the entire world melts away and I lock in as I see how I can make someone’s dream come true,” Mulligan told Mercer. “How I see what a player is saying and go, ‘That’s awesome. We can do that. That idea you just had, we’re gonna make that come true.’ That to me is what ambition is. And it’s a wild thing too, in terms of the larger industry — we talked about [Critical Role’s] incredible adaptations, ‘The Legend of Vox Machina,’ ‘The Mighty Nein’ — there are these bizarre ways in which this hobby is now opening doors in Hollywood in a way, that who could have anticipated it?”\n\n\tMulligan continued: “But you’re walking into those spaces and through those doors and I think it’s really helpful for people to hear that whatever ambition is, I have made every choice to avoid success at every turn. Imagine, imagine a 10-year-old kid being like, ‘There’s a gap in the market, time to start playing Dungeons and Dragons. I’ve nailed it. I see the opening on the field.’ Like, no, man. No, I picked a game that got your head put in toilets and I played it hard. And then I said, ‘Time to get serious. Let’s do free improv in a basement.'”\n\t\n\n\tMercer, who has helped adapt Critical Role’s campaigns into the Amazon animated series “The Legend of Vox Machina” and “The Mighty Nein,” is equally befuddled by how the industry that has grown out of his lifelong passion for D&D is seen as a business decision that’s been decades in the making.\n\n\t“I’ve seen conversations, or there have been discussions of how long this was plotted, about how Critical Role was all manufactured as an ultimate goal,” Mercer said. “And going back to that point, it was like, who fucking knew, bro? It’s wild to look back on how this whole thing has happened, but to that same degree, through this, building platforms in which we’re not reliant on external systems. We started on Twitch and YouTube, and we still stream to those places, but it’s also very dangerous from a business standpoint to put all of your stakes into a platform that you don’t control.”\n\n\tMercer pointed to how CollegeHumor vet (now Dropout CEO) Sam Reich bought the company in the wake of its implosion at Barry Dillar’s IAC and then revamped it into streaming platform Dropout, which Mulligan says is “now doing better than CollegeHumor ever did.”\n\n\t“And that’s a testament to creatives having the opportunity, through a community that’ll support them, to build a space and have the right people in leadership to do so,” Mercer said. “We took a lesson from even Dropout to build our Beacon platform to help us decouple from relying on outside platforms.”\n\n\tWatch Variety‘s full sitdown interview between Mercer and Mulligan via the video above.\n",

The film world premiered at Venice and went on to win three top prizes at the Lumières Awards, including best film, cinematography and actor for Benjamin Voisin. \n\n\n\tThe other anticipated highlights of the Rendez-Vous include “Alpha,” Julia Ducournau’s bold follow up to her Palme d’Or-winning “Titane” which is headlined by a haunting performance by Tahar Rahim and will close the festival; as well as Olivier Assayas’s Venice-premiering “The Wizard of the Kremlin” starring Jude Law as a fictionalized Vladimir Putin opposite Paul Dano as his mysterious strategist Vladislav; Dominik Moll’s “Case 137,” a Cannes-premiering, Cesar-nominated gripping procedural set during the Yellow Vests protests and starring Léa Drucker; Pauline Loquès’s Cesar-nominated feature debut “Nino,” which bowed at Cannes Critics’ Week and stars Unifrance “10 to Watch” honoree Théodore Pellerin; Arnaud Desplechin’s melodrama “Two Pianos;” Valérie Donzelli’s Venice-prizewinning “At Work” starring Bastien Bouillon as an aspiring writer who struggles to make ends meet; and Stéphane Demoustier’s Cesar-nominated historical epic “The Great Arch,” which premiered in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard and stars Claes Bang as Danish architect Johan Otto von Spreckelsen who came to Paris in the early 1980’s to oversee a daunting project. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Wizard of the Kremlin \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcarole bethuel\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNew York premieres include Hafsia Herzi’s Cesar-nominated queer coming-of-age film “The Little Sister,” featuring Cannes best actress winner Nadia Melliti as a young girl on a journey of self-discovery; the late Laurent Cantet’s final project, directed by Robin Campillo, “Enzo,” which opened Cannes’ Directors’ Fortnight; and Cédric Klapisch’s “Colors of Time,” about four distant cousins reuniting at a family home in Normandy who retrace the steps of their 19th-century ancestor to Paris.\n\n\t“It is such an honor to open the new edition of Rendez-Vous with French Cinema with ‘The Stranger,’ the adaptation of Albert Camus’s classic French novel, in the presence of director François Ozon and actress Rebecca Marder,” said Daniela Elstner, Unifrance’s executive director. “This remarkable film, along with this year’s selection, is a powerful testament to the diversity and creativity of French cinema today.”\n\n\tElstner added, “Rendez-Vous with French Cinema continues to serve as a cultural bridge between France and the United States, bringing filmmakers and audiences together through a shared love of cinema.”\n\n\t“At a time of global uncertainty,” Elstner said, “we are deeply grateful for the strong and solid relationship we have built with our partners at Film at Lincoln Center.”\n\n\tFlorence Almozini, Film at Lincoln Center’s VP of programming, said “The 31st edition of Rendez-Vous with French Cinema reflects the ever-impressive vitality and artistic ambition of contemporary filmmaking in France.”\n\n\tAlmozini pointed out this year’s roster brings together “acclaimed auteurs such as Olivier Assayas, François Ozon, Claire Simon, Pascal Bonitzer, and many exciting new filmmakers including Leyla Bouzid, Hubert Charuel, and Pauline Loquès to name a few.”\n\n\tShe said “Film at Lincoln Center is proud to continue this long-standing collaboration with Unifrance, presenting the best of new French cinema to New York audiences.”\n\n\tBesides “The Wizard of the Kremlin,” the Rendez-Vous will host the U.S. premiere of a second film, Jean-Paul Salomé’s “The Money Maker,” a crime drama starring Reda Kateb as a master French counterfeiter during and after WWII.\n\n\tA jury of six students pursuing film and French studies degrees from New York City colleges will choose their favorite feature for the best emerging filmmaker award, while all moviegoers attending the festival will also be able to vote for their favorite movie. The two awards will be announced shortly after the close of the festival.\n\t\n\n\tThe Rendez-Vous with French Cinema, backed by Villa Albertine, TV5 Monde and Maison Occitanie, will take place March 5-15. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Reach,” the upcoming climbing thriller starring Ryan Phillippe, has now wrapped production in Thailand, with a first-look shot revealed ahead of the European Film Market.\n\n\tFrom writer/director Mukunda Michael Dewil (“Vehicle 19,” “Prey,” “The Immaculate Room”), the film is produced by Kaos Entertainment and financed by Christian Mercuri’s company Capstone.\n\n\tSales agent Capture — a joint-venture between Capstone Global and Signature Entertainment that launched in 2025 — has sold the film globally. Territory sales include Eastern Europe excluding Poland (Prorom), Spain (Selecta Vision), Benelux (SPI), Poland (Dimeo Films), CIS and Baltics (MGN), Latin America (CDC), Turkey (ATV), India (Star Entertainment), Malaysia (MVP), Korea (Noori), Philippines (Pioneer), Indonesia (PT Prima), Airlines (Cinesky) and Mongolia (Film Bridge).\n\t\n\n\tCapture will be showing early footage to buyers at this year’s EFM in Berlin.\n\n\n\t“Reach” follows best friends and fearless climbers Zack and Chris, who find themselves dangling perilously off a mountain edge, leaving them connected only by a rope. Zack confronts a life-or-death decision: should he cut the rope to save himself, or do they both fall to their death?\n\n\tPhillippe is represented by David Schiff and Terri Coffey at MGMT Entertainment.\n\n\tCapture recently closed a deal with Well Go USA for North American rights to “Rise of the Conqueror,” the historical action epic based on the true story of 14th century conqueror Amir Timur, alongside a raft of other international territory sales. At the AFM in November, the company launched AI-focused sci-fi survival thriller Override, starring Frank Grillo and Maria Bakalova and being directed and co-written by Jordan Downey.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAri Emanuel will release his first memoir, “Roll the Calls,” on Sept. 22.\n\n\tFrom publishing house Knopf, the book is advertised as “fiery” and “furious,” with the super-agent spilling his insights on the successes and setbacks that have defined his rise to becoming one of the most influential figures in Hollywood. \n\n\tEmanuel wrote “Roll the Calls” with Pulitzer Prize winner J.R. Moehringer, author of “The Tender Bar.” A first printing of 250,000 copies has been set, and an audio version will be handled by Penguin Random House.\n\t\n\n\t“Roll the Calls” will chronicle Emanuel’s childhood on the South Side of Chicago, his early struggle with severe dyslexia and his humble beginnings working in the CAA mailroom. It will then lead into Emanuel’s founding of Endeavor and merger with William Morris as he became a vital architect of the entertainment biz — the power broker that inspired the iconic “Entourage” character Ari Gold. As an agent, Emanuel’s clients include Martin Scorsese, Larry David, Dwayne Johnson, Oprah Winfrey, Mark Wahlberg, the Weeknd, Denzel Washington and Robert Downey Jr.\n\n\n\t“As a kid, I was often told I’d amount to nothing. Thank God I didn’t listen because I’ve now worked with so many brilliant writers, directors, actors, artists, journalists, entrepreneurs and investors,” Emanuel said in a statement to the press. “From them, and from bitter experience, I’ve learned a lot about success and failure, creativity and persistence. Especially persistence. My story is for everyone who feels doubted and especially for that person who’s been told to give up, just quit. If there’s one major theme it’s that every time someone tells you to pack it in, you’re not good enough, you should tell that person to **** off.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGolden Globe and Emmy winner Erin Doherty (“Adolescence,” “The Crown”) and BAFTA winner James McAvoy (“The Last King of Scotland,” “Atonement”) are uniting for upcoming feature “Faith.” The supernatural drama marks the seventh film from BAFTA and BIFA-winning British writer/director Paul Andrew Williams, whose most recent release was the critically-acclaimed and award-winning “Dragonfly.”\n\n\tNow in production and shooting in the U.K., “Faith” is being repped by both Bankside Films and Logical for international sales and will be introduced to buyers at the European Film Market in Berlin. \n\t\n\n\t“Faith” follows Gina, a hard-working and devoted single mother who meets a quietly enigmatic stranger, Michael. The presence of someone who appears to care for her brings a new and exciting dynamic to her life, despite the fact she knows nothing about him or what his intentions towards her really are. Is he a friend, a potential lover or something more sinister? As per the synopsis: “When Gina’s life is abruptly turned upside down and Michael’s extraordinary true identity is revealed, she learns that she might just be able to embrace the beauty of living life fully again.”\n\n\n\tBAFTA and BIFA award nominee Liv Hill (“Jellyfish,” “The Little Stranger”) also stars in the film alongside Smylie Bradwell (“Hamnet,” “Hunger Games”).\n\n\t“Faith” is produced by Dominic Tighe of Giant Productions (“Dragonfly,” “Bull”) and Danny Page of Homefront Productions & Blazing Griffin (“California Schemin”). The project is being financed by Blazing Griffin, Logical and Homefront Productions.\n\t\n\n\tFor Doherty, “Faith” marks a her first major film lead role following the phenomenal — and ongoing —success of Netflix’s “Adolescence,” which continues to amass awards. The Brit is currently appearing in the second season of the highly-acclaimed “A Thousand Blows” on Disney+. Meanwhile, the feature sees McAvoy reunite with Blazing Griffin, the Scottish production company behind his directorial debut “California Schemin,” which bowed in Toronto last year. \n\n\t“Faith is a deeply personal story to me. Telling a story of strength and hope, set in a known reality yet shadowed by something other worldly that we can’t quite explain which is guiding us through life,” said Williams, best known for his dark and gritty genre filmmaking across features such as “London to Brighton” and “Bull.”\n\n\t“I am so fortunate to be working with such a talented group of actors and crew who value what this film is trying to achieve. Collaborating with Erin Doherty and James McAvoy has been a gift. Their commitment elevates every moment.”\n\n\tAdded Stephen Kelliher of Bankside Films and Andrei Kamarowsky of Logical: “We have long been admirers of Paul’s immense talent and the opportunity to collaborate with him on ‘Faith’ was not to be missed. His ability to play with genre in the most unexpected way shines through in this gripping story which expertly subverts your expectations in the most thrilling and surprising way. It’s a story with huge depth of emotion which the exceptional cast he has assembled will execute brilliantly.”\n\n\tDoherty is represented by Conway van Gelder Grant, CAA, Untitled, Public Eye and Sloane Offer. McAvoy is represented by United Agents, UTA, The Lede Company and Sloane Offer.\n\n\tBankside Films and Logical are handling worldwide sales.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBrazilian film star Wagner Moura, standing on the rooftop of the Variety offices in Los Angeles, says, with a trace of wonder, “I can see my house from here.”\n\n\tBut Moura, 49, has a lot more on his mind than the view, or even the historic best actor Oscar nomination he received only 24 hours ago for “The Secret Agent.” He’s thinking about his wife of 25 years and three boys, and the monster growing slowly in the United States. Today, everything Moura will talk about is something Americans still don’t fully understand, yet Moura knows intimately: what authoritarianism actually looks like when it arrives. \n\t\n\n\tHaving done theater, TV and film in Brazil, Moura broke out globally in 2015 when he played notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar in Netflix’s hit crime series “Narcos” opposite Pedro Pascal. Soon after, he expanded his Hollywood presence with artful roles like the war correspondent opposite Kirsten Dunst in Alex Garland’s 2024 post-apocalyptic thriller “Civil War” and Manny, one-half of a crime duo who rob drug dealers in Apple TV’s 2025 miniseries “Dope Thief.” \n\n\n\tBut there’s something different for Moura about Kleber Mendonça Filho’s wrenching political thriller “The Secret Agent”: Moura has lived that experience. Set during Brazil’s military dictatorship in the late 1970s, “The Secret Agent” follows Armando Solimões, a former professor caught in political turmoil who attempts to flee persecution with his young son as authoritarian rule tightens. \n\n\tArmando is pursued by hitmen hired by Henrique Ghirotti (Luciano Chirolli), an amoral executive with both political and personal vendettas against him. Armando flees to Recife, where he is taken in by Dona Sebastiana, a former anarcho-communist elder (Tânia Maria). Dona Sebastiana shelters other political dissidents, but there’s only so much she can do to protect Brazilian citizens in the sights of a corrupt government. \n\t\n\n\tInside the Variety offices, Moura is disarmingly attentive. He leans forward when he speaks, and listens with the same intensity he brings to his answers. At one point, we laugh about how Americans mispronounce his name, calling him “Wagner” instead of “Vagner,” like the German composer. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhat registers immediately is his curiosity. He asks a lot of questions — not out of politeness, but out of genuine interest, learning about the people around him with the same care he gives to his characters. He’s warm without being performative, and thoughtful without posturing. He asks about journalism the way someone who once imagined himself as a journalist might — not with nostalgia, but with respect. His Oscar nomination hovers in the background, acknowledged but never the center of conversation. What matters more to Moura is the moment itself. \n\n\t“This is a film that was born from how Kleber and I felt when Brazil was under this sort of fascist government. How we felt about our roles as artists,” Moura explains. “You guys never had the experience of living under a dictatorship. You don’t know what that is, what that feels like or how bad that is.” He crosses his arms, choosing his next words carefully. “It happens slowly. And if you don’t have a reaction to the little things, that’s when they take over.”  \n\n\tMendonça Filho, who wrote the main role in “The Secret Agent” for Moura, recognized something essential in his leading man beyond talent. “Wagner is a great actor,” Mendonça Filho says. “He has the element of empathy in him, like Jimmy Stewart, Paul Newman and José Ferrer. But more crucially, I cannot separate the person and the actor in my films. Wagner’s incredible emotional commitment to the story — and to Brazil — was essential.” \n\n\tBorn in Salvador and raised in Rodelas, 340 miles outside the capital, with a father in the military, Moura grew used to the itinerant life. He studied journalism in college, having been inspired by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. He hoped that someday he, too, could investigate corruption at the highest levelsof government.  \n\n\tInstead, he ended up on this rooftop, having just learned that the film he stars in has earned four Oscar nominations: best picture, international feature, casting and of course, best actor for Moura, the first Brazilian and sixth Latino to be nominated in the category’s 98-year history.  \n\t\n\n\tStill, real life, Moura insists, is what happens when the cameras stop rolling, and when democracies and humanity are truly tested. Less than 24 hours after this meeting, ICE agents will fatally shoot ICU nurse Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis, an event that will dominate the news cycle and fuel debates online — and in the streets — about executive power. \n\n\tEverything Wagner Moura talks about is relevant.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhere are you, emotionally, at this moment, after the Oscar nomination? \t\n\n\tIt’s complex. Professionally, this is probably the most recognized moment of my career. But life doesn’t stop. [After the nomination] I hugged my wife and kids, and then life continued. That’s grounding. This is a beautiful moment, especially because it’s a Brazilian film receiving this attention. I’m truly happy. But I’ve been around long enough to understand this isn’t real life. Once the excitement settles, I’m a husband and a father again.\n\t\n\t\tWhen did you film “The Secret Agent” and how long was the shoot? \t\n\n\tIt took about 10 weeks. It’s a big production. For Brazil, this is big — about $4 million to $5 million, which for us is huge. It’s like our “Avatar.” [Laughs] \n\t\n\t\tWhen you first read the script, what unsettled you the most about Armando? \t\n\n\tWhat unsettled me was realizing how similar Armando was to me. How I was playing myself. That sounds easy, but it’s not because you’re putting yourself in very vulnerable positions repeatedly. It is me and it is the character, but it’s also something else. \n\t\n\t\tDo you find it difficult to play someone who isn’t a version of yourself?\t\n\n\tWe have everything within us. When I played Pablo Escobar, I’m nothing like him, but I am. We can all be mean, greedy and do shitty things. Acting is digging within yourself. We’re capable of beautiful things and evil things. Human beings can be horrible, but they can also be extraordinary. Acting lives in that gray area. \n\t\n\t\tDid you approach Armando first as a political figure or simply as a man trying to survive?  \t\n\n\tAlways as a man. Politics should be the background. People connect to characters, not ideas.  \n\t\n\t\tYou told me that Americans are taking democracy for granted. Can you expand upon that?  \t\n\n\tWhen I was doing “Civil War,” I was constantly thinking about how differently Brazil reacted to our insurrection — in a better way than you guys did, because Brazil was quick to do the right thing and send the message that you can’t mess with democracy. We sent people to jail. Bolsonaro is in jail.  \n\t\n\n\tIn America, it’s as if they’re testing, like a kid — they’re like, “I’m going to do it,” and if there’s no reaction, then what? I feel like the U.S. and its institutions are not responding with appropriate firmness — putting up boundaries, people facing consequences. \n\t\n\t\tWhat concerns you the most about this time — not just in the U.S. but globally?  \t\n\n\tWhat concerns me most about mankind nowadays is that there are no facts anymore. Facts don’t matter anymore. We used to fight — left and right — we used to have arguments, but we were fighting over the same thing. Nowadays, it’s not about facts. It’s about versions of the truth.  \n\n\tWhen the president himself creates a universe where Renee Good is to blame — it’s not only morally horrible, but it’s not true. It’s crazy. The information that gets to your feed is completely different to the information that gets to your mother or that MAGA guy. And he’s not necessarily a bad human being, but he is being fed information that makes him think there’s a pizza place where Democrats are [abusing] kids. So how can you talk to someone who doesn’t live in the same reality that you do? \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWagner Moura at the Golden Globes in January, where he won best lead actor for “The Secret Agent”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristopher Polk/2026GG\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIs that what makes art and storytelling more important right now?  \t\n\n\tYes. When art and films step up and do a “fiction,” it might be something that’s more important than reality. Because you watch a movie, go back home and it makes you think about it. \n\n\tI’m increasingly interested in speaking through characters — saying what I need to say through them. \n\t\n\t\tYou play Armando as a man who is trying to survive through restraint. Why was that the right choice for this character? \t\n\n\tThis character couldn’t call attention to himself. He’s in a dictatorship where people would disappear. You can’t call the cops or hire a lawyer. He just wanted to protect his son and survive with his moral values intact. For the character himself, silence was survival. \n\t\n\t\tThe film shows very little violence directly. Why was that type of restraint important?  \t\n\n\tI love that Kleber leaves so many questions unanswered. We don’t know what Dona Sebastiana did in Italy. We don’t know exactly how Armando’s wife died in the film. It makes sense to me that violence is not shown in that way. It’s a film where you never hear the word “dictatorship.” We don’t see any military. And when we see the businessman who is the villain of the film … I had never seen that before, especially in films about dictatorships: The dictatorship was not something the military alone did; it was supported by a huge part of the people, everyday citizens who didn’t want a left-wing president to rule the country. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow has being perceived, or not perceived, as a Latino affected your career? \t\n\n\tBrazilians don’t fit Hollywood’s boxes. “Narcos” connected me to a larger Latin identity. I finally felt part of the family. But I feel a responsibility not to reinforce stereotypes. \n\t\n\t\tYou’ve been vocal about Latino representation in Hollywood. After “Narcos,” did you feel typecast?  \t\n\n\tThe amount of offers that I got after “Narcos” to play that exact same thing — I was like, no. I had to say no because it’s a perception of our people. Of course, “Narcos” was a great thing. But I don’t want to keep reinforcing that stereotype. I wanted to play journalists, doctors, engineers — whatever we are. We are the biggest part of this society. I want to go for the same characters that white American actors are going for. I don’t need to play a guy called José. Give me Michael, and guess what? The guy is going to speak just the way I speak, with this accent. Because I represent many people who speak just like me. \n\t\n\t\tBrazil has had extraordinary Oscar success the past two years with “I’m Still Here” and “The Secret Agent.” What does this moment mean? \t\n\n\tWhat’s happening to this film, especially after what happened with “I’m Still Here,” is amazing. The attention that these Brazilian films are receiving — especially after the far right in Brazil began demonizing artists — is special. And Brazil has a government now that’s friendly to culture, to films. To see Brazilians gathering around cultural films, saying, “These artists represent us,” it’s beautiful. Before, the far right was very efficient in transforming artists into enemies of the people. They were very effective because our films depend a lot on the government’s funding. The far right was efficient in demonizing that and saying we are stealing money from the government. Sound familiar? \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat do Americans misunderstand most about Brazil?  \t\n\n\tThe joyful image is accurate: the warmth, the culture, the music, the food — the best fucking food. But Brazil was also the last country to abolish slavery. Inequality is massive. Power is concentrated. Brazil is complex. As [“Girl From Ipanema” composer] Tom Jobim said, Brazil is not for beginners. Bolsonaro didn’t come from nowhere — he reflects the country, just as Trump reflects America. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tIf you could speak to your younger self just starting out, what would you say?  \t\n\n\tCalm down. Relax. Keep being true to yourself. I’m about to be 50 this year, and soon my sons are going to go to college. I want to get closer to affection, to love — especially while not living in Brazil right now. \n\t\n\t\tWhat feels most urgent for you to do next as an artist?  \t\n\n\tI want to keep working with great directors. I would love to work with Paul Thomas Anderson. I would love to be in a film directed by Martin Scorsese. I want to have lunch with Leonardo DiCaprio, who is around my age. These are things that I hope this nomination will facilitate — the access to directors and artists like those. If this nomination brings me anything, it’s that — being considered. That would be enough. \n\t\n\t\tWhere do you hope we will be 10 years from now?  \t\n\n\tThe killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis felt like one of those “What the fuck?” moments that should wake people up. But at the same time, I saw reactions saying, “A white person got killed, so now we have to do something,” as if it’s somehow acceptable when immigrants are killed. \n\n\tI hope we rebuild the bridges between us. Polarization is democracy’s greatest threat. Many people aren’t bad; they’re misinformed. Technology helps science but destroys civic life. Attention spans are gone. Young people are depressed. Truth feels over. I hope we find a way back.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmerican Cinematheque, which is now in its 40th year, is paying homage to Michael B. Jordan in an awards ceremony and fundraiser in Beverly Hills on Nov. 20 and is screening a curated selection of films of the incomparable Diane Keaton through Dec. 6.\n\n\t“The awards are an annual event, and this one is turning out to be quite exciting,” executive director Ken Scherer tells Variety. “When they created this award, they decided to do ‘mid-career’ as opposed to ‘life achievement.’ And having worked at AFI during some of the Great Life Achievement Award shows, it’s a valid interest because you can catch people on their way up. And Michael B. Jordan is reflective of that original concept. He’s on the ascent and, yet he’s achieved [a lot].”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichael B. Jordan is to receive the American Cinematheque Award for outstanding career achievements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe nonprofit is really proud of another thing that’s part of the 40th celebration: the upcoming launch of its archive, with four decades of Q&As and photographs and all kinds of things that are going to be made available to the public. They’re also in the early stages of producing their first book, which tells the history of the Cinematheque.\n\n\n\tSo, how did this whole thing get started? Back in 1984, three film lovers — Gary Abrahams and Gary Essert, who were also the forces behind who was also a force behind L.A.’s FilmEx, and filmmaker Sydney Pollack — decided the city needed something special, something like the legendary Cinémathèque Française in Paris. They built on the energy of the L.A. International Film Exposition (the aforementioned FilmEx), bringing the American Cinematheque to life. It started showing movies to the public in 1985 and quickly became a must-visit place for film lovers everywhere. \n\t\n\n\tWhen Scherer was recruited by the board to take a look at the Cinematheque, it was in pretty dire straights. “The 40th [anniversary] is significant because we were able to do some things in 2018 by selling the Egyptian [Theatre], but yet retaining the right to program it from time for every week, which saved the Cinematheque,” Scherer explains. “When you then put it in context of what happened with the pandemic that no one could have imagined, it would not be here today if we had not done that. It’s really significant that we’re here, but it’s even more significant that we survived and came out stronger than ever.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmerican Cinematheque is currently screening a selection of films starring Diane Keaton.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThat progress wasn’t just about serving up great films in Los Angeles, it also meant opening up the Cinematheque to people across the U.S. with screenings and events in various venues. Everyday moviegoers can now celebrate cinema together, not just in L.A. (at the Egyptian Theatre, the Aero Theatre and the Los Feliz 3 Theatre) but also around the country. And for the first time, they even went international with Bleak Week, an annual festival showcasing darker movies. \n\n\t“We view ourselves as a specialty cinema where we intertwine advanced screenings, premieres and award season with films from a hundred years ago,” says artistic director Grant Moninger. “We are bringing another festival to New York next year and expanding with our innovation for membership and a way that our customers will be able to interact and experience Cinematheque even if they’re not in Los Angeles.” That includes 1,600-plus screenings and 360,000 patrons every year.\n\n\tRight now, as Scherer puts it, “the stars seem to be aligned” because Cinematheque is stronger than ever before. “We’re strong and there’s such a resurgence,” he says. “And what I love is it’s the younger generation. It’s the [people in their] twenties and the thirties. Our demographic from where we were in 2018 to where we are today, it doesn’t resemble anything like it did back then. So it’s a real interesting moment for reflection, but it’s also a moment for vision. And I think that’s what I’m trying to celebrate.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney may be using the 2025 CMA Awards as a warm-up for 2027.\n\n\tThe company has in recent years been snatching up rights to some of TV’s best-known live events, and what it does Wednesday evening during a country-music awards telecast from Nashville could take on even greater importance in the early part of 2027, when, over the course of eight weeks, Disney’s TV and streaming properties will feature the College Football Playoffs, the Oscars, the Grammys and Super Bowl LXI — the first time ABC will show the Big Game since 2006.\n\t\n\n\tThe impetus for building a new array of live events comes in part from advertisers, says John Campbell, senior vice president of entertainment and streaming solutions at Disney Advertising. “The demand for live from our partners is — we’ve never seen demand like this before,” the executive says during a recent interview, noting that the company has exceeded ad-revenue goals for the CMAs as well as the previous three live specials it has aired.\n\n\n\tMore people are leaving linear television for streaming, where they can watch their favorite comedies and dramas at times of their own choosing. But that dynamic has created a thorny dilemma for advertisers, who need to reach thousands, even millions of potential consumers with commercials if their ad dollars are to be spent efficiently. And while sports remain, perhaps, the last programming format that continues to bring in large audiences reliably, there is new hope that live specials and events can do the same.\n\n\tAs a result, more TV networks are turning to bespoke events that need to be watched as they happen or else be spoiled for those who miss out. NBCUniversal pitched advertisers on participation in the 50th anniversary of “Saturday Night Live” last season and is working on a 100th anniversary celebration of the NBC broadcast network.\n\t\n\n\t“We keep hearing from so many brands:  Bring us more ‘in real life,’ bring us more for experiential,” says Campbell. While many sponsors continue to run traditional commercials, they are also seeking to be woven into the show itself so they can be seen as being part of the action. Disney has also won rights to televise the annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony and has begun live-streaming big music festivals like Lalapalooza and Bonnaroo\n\n\tWednesday night’s CMAs will offer a look at the ways sponsors can be made part of the event. General Motors’ Chevrolet has been a CMA sponsor for years. A special in-show vignette designed by Disney’s in-house agency will nod to military heroes, and will be set up by an appearance by singer Ella Langley.\n\n\t Booking.com, a new sponsor of the event, will tell a story through commercials across the entire evening, with commercials that feature country singer Jordan Davis and his tour photographer, Caleb Cockrell. Another new sponsor, Sonic, will support a special Fan Zone as well as the CMA Green Room, which will feature a “Coca-Cola Your Way” bar and catered corn dogs and tots. Singer Lauren Alaina will appear in the venue, which will feature Sonic signs and markings.  \n\n\tMany of the in-show pitches will be spotlighted on social media by ABC, CMA and various artists who take part in the promotions.\n\n\tDisney will try to continue similar efforts in the future, says Campbell.  Advertisers keep pressing to “get into the actual program’s live environment,” he says, and “maximize that moment.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCreative Artists Agency will acquire Beanstalk, a mainstay of the licensing sector, as it seeks to build its expertise in managing brands and the products associated with them.\n\n\tOver the years, Beanstalk has helped Diageo’s Guinness enter into apparel and food; Kellanova, the company once known as Kellogg’s, find ways to bring its popular cereals into ice-cream products; and translate Dole fruit products into the kids and pets market. The company was founded in 1992 and has offices around the world.\n\t\n\n\tFinancial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\n\n\tEarlier this year, Beanstalk was acquired by its management team and an investment group led by the family office of venture capitalist and entrepreneur Jason Epstein. Previously, Beanstalk had been part of Omnicom Group, the large marketing-and-advertising services holding company that is merging with one-time rival Interpublic Group of Cos. Omnicom bought Beanstalk in 2005 from Ford Motor Co., which acquired the licensing agency in 2001 as part of a bid to boost its efforts in licensed merchandised tied to auto brands such as Ford, Volvo and Aston Martin.\n\n\tBeanstalk will be integrated into CAA Brand Management. “CAA Brand Management and Beanstalk share a common belief in the power of creativity, collaboration, and integrity to create lasting brand value,” said Perry Wolfman, CEO of the unit, in a prepared statement. “We have long admired Beanstalk’s reputation for excellence and their dedication to client service. Bringing our teams together integrates two industry leaders that view brand stewardship not as a transaction, but as a trusted partnership grounded in purpose and performance.”\n\t\n\n\tAllison Ames, CEO of Beanstalk, will become co-president of CAA Brand Management, alongside Noah Gelbart. The combination of assets, said Gelbart in a statement, offers “deeper category expertise, a broader global footprint, and greater strategic innovation.”  \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe struggle of the modern hollywood producer was crystallized in a bit from this year’s Emmy awards.\n\n\tHost Nate Bargatze opened the broadcast with an old-timey sketch spoofing the creation of the television set, in which he played an exaggerated version of real-life inventor Philo Farnsworth.\n\n\tOn a Frankenstein-esque laboratory set, Bargatze, flanked by “Saturday Night Live” players Bowen Yang and Mikey Day, predicted how a crude little box would come to captivate billions of viewers around the world. One of the “SNL” boys asked who would make the programming. Bargatze responded: “Actors, writers, directors and, most importantly, producers.” Day followed up, “And what does the producer do, sir?” \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBargatze stared into the camera and deadpanned, “Nobody knows!”\n\n\n\tThe punchline got a big laugh, as it has for decades when Hollywood feigns ignorance about the role of capital-P Producers. And yet the entertainment industry runs on their passion and drive. They are the often-unseen forces that find material, attach superstar talent, oversee all stages of production and assume the responsibility of delivering a film or series on time and on budget. For the past two and a half years, hundreds of producers have quietly banded together to stave off what they see as their own extinction, forming a group called Producers United and coining the term “career producer” as a preferred moniker. Jokes like Bargatze’s are simply starting to hit different. \n\n\t“Years ago, our value and our function was never disrespected or questioned,” says Todd Black from the Vancouver set of Aaron Sorkin’s “The Social Reckoning,” his 85th feature film as a producer. “Producers in the ’80s and somewhat in the ’90s were valued as a completely necessary tool. All of us start our projects through imagination, a script we’ve developed, something we wrought and delivered.” \n\t\n\n\tFounded in June 2023, Producers United comprises some of the most successful figures in show business, including Adele Romanski (“Moonlight”), Grant Heslov (“Argo”), Barbara Broccoli (the James Bond franchise), Beau Flynn (Disney’s live-action “Moana”), Jeremy Kleiner and Dede Gardner (“12 Years a Slave”), Brad Simpson and Nina Jacobson (“The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story”), Will Packer (“Girls Trip”), Tom Ackerley (“Barbie”) and Stacey Sher (“Erin Brockovich”). \n\n\tTheir goal is to demand basic rights and stop what they feel is the “slow degradation” of the services they provide. The initial asks that this collective of power players is pressing for from studios and top platforms is to provide health insurance while production is active; to accelerate the traditional timeline of producer compensation rather than waiting until the final product is delivered; and to address the proliferation of producer credits in TV and film by adhering to a Producers United checklist that spells out the job’s duties and responsibilities.\n\n\tTechnological advancements such as streaming and waves of mergers and acquisitions among media companies have rocked the traditional Hollywood ecosystem over the past 15 years. Consequently, Producers United members are finding it harder to make a living in the new world order. Their compensation is increasingly being slashed as movies and TV shows must be made on tighter budgets, and that’s if they’re lucky enough to get a project greenlit. As studios and streamers tighten belts, they’re making less content.  \n\n\t“There’s a posture of scarcity that everyone in the industry is feeling right now,” says Naomi Despres, producer of “India Sweets and Spices,” adding that “making a movie is harder than ever, especially the negotiations.”  \n\n\tThere may be fewer films, but the ones that do get made have an ever-expanding list of people who claim to have produced them. Many major stars demand to be credited as producers (but perform no actual duties in that role), as do outside investors, who will put up the money for a movie in exchange for a shot at awards glory as a producer on a film whose set they may never have visited. The studios, in kind, see producers as menial labor when they’re the ones doing the heavy lifting, according to nearly three dozen producers interviewed for this piece.  \n\t\n\n\t“We protect the artistry and the artists, and we maintain the quality, and that’s our job,” Lorenzo di Bonaventura, a veteran producer of the “Transformers” films and many others and a former top executive at Warner Bros. Pictures. “What happens when we’re not here anymore?”  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBowen Yang, Nate Bargatze and Mikey Day perform the opening skit at the Emmy Awards on Sept. 14.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWireImage\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhile writers, actors and directors have unions to advocate on their behalf, producers do not have the same collective bargaining power. (Despite past attempts to unionize, the 74-year-old Producers Guild of America remains a trade association given its members are viewed as employers.) Producers United believes the future of its craft is nearing an inflection point from which it may not recover — especially as the labor contracts for other Hollywood unions are coming up for renewal next year. Leadership at Producers United told Variety that the WGA and SAG-AFTRA have signaled there will be increases in cash reserves that guarantee residuals for their members. That means indie producers will have to bear bonds for that cash — a move that could collapse that sector’s financial ecosystem. At the same time, producers are having to contend with the emergence of artificial intelligence, which seems poised to upend the business in profound ways.  \n\n\t“When the streaming services came in, we were sold a bill of goods. There were going to be more buyers, more films, more jobs and more eyeballs. What we didn’t see coming was the tech companies overpaying for talent and changing back-end models to gain market share,” says Jonathan Wang, the Oscar-winning producer of “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” The result, Wang says, was “production leaving the U.S., empty back lots and empty movie theaters. With AI, we as producers are arbiters of this craft.  We are positioned to understand the scale of the coming problem and the scale of the solutions.” \n\n\n\tIn the Hollywood of yore, producers were seen as fat cats. It’s an archetype synonymous with images of Robert Evans in a barely buttoned Yves Saint Laurent shirt and oversize square-frame glasses — or the OG nepo baby Richard D. Zanuck, who helped launch Steven Spielberg in the ’70s as the producer of “Jaws” and “The Sugarland Express” after brief runs as an executive at Fox and Warner Bros. Today’s career producers say this depiction has haunted them in the four decades since Evans and Zanuck loomed large over the town. Make no mistake: There are still mogul-producers, such as Jerry Bruckheimer, Brian Grazer, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall. But even many of these figures no longer enjoy the rich overall deals they used to command, to say nothing of the luxurious back-lot bungalows that once housed their huge staffs. Hardly anyone in Producers United rents office space; instead, most work from home. Only 5.2% of the roughly 300 members has an overall deal in place. \n\n\tHealth care for career producers has been a relatively easy get for Producers United. HBO, Warner Bros. Pictures and Universal Pictures were among the first major industry employers to agree to the terms of Producers United’s first basic rights campaign. On the film side, the cost of that health care is about $35,000 for big-budget productions and about $8,000 for an indie film. Amazon Studios and Sony Pictures are the only buyers who’ve not agreed to this ask. (One Sony insider says producer health care contributions are considered on a case-by-case basis.) \n\t\n\n\tGetting by as a career producer is a different struggle, one that has left a void of mentorship and tends to impact younger and diverse voices. “People have to be financially independent to be able to be a producer,” says Jennifer Todd, a producer who broke out with the Austin Powers franchise and “Memento” from Christopher Nolan. “The studios used to make deals with producers so they could have a living while they developed projects. Now? Almost all those deals are with talent, actors or directors. That’s a big shift, because [it signals] they don’t need someone doing the actual job of a career producer.” \n\n\n\n\n\tUp-and-coming producer Stephen Love (“They Cloned Tyrone”) was supporting himself as a rideshare driver only two years ago, despite having projects set up and produced at multiple studios. A mentor once warned him, “You’re getting into a rich man’s sport.” He’s since diversified his income by building an advertising production outfit to sustain him between films. Love’s story of hustle and hardship is only becoming more commonplace.\n\n\t“The thing that has happened in film has a lot of overlap with what’s happening in television,” says Sarah Schechter, partner with prolific producer Greg Berlanti in Berlanti Productions. “[Producing] TV was never as good a deal as a movie, but it was much faster — there were more episodes, and they were at a faster cadence, right? But now we’re talking about six to eight episodes [per season] that take three to five years. So that producer is oftentimes there at the very beginning, and they are truly the last person to get paid. That’s very hard to sustain as a job.”\n\n\tSo the role of the career producer has quickly shifted from entrepreneur and studio partner to laborer. Streaming eliminated back-end profit participation — money producers once used to fund overhead and development, and to hire and train other producers. The contraction of the studio film business over the past decade and the shift toward TV series with fewer episodes and longer lag time between seasons add up to producers often going months without seeing a penny.\n\n\tHere’s some math that might fit on a Musso & Frank cocktail napkin: Producers commit years of unpaid labor to cultivating ideas and manifesting them into film and TV shows (paying screenwriters out of pocket, optioning books and magazine articles, buying out viral social media accounts). At the point a movie is set up with any of the mainstream buyers, producers are paid a development fee — a flat rate of $25,000, a figure that was set in 1971 and hasn’t changed in six decades. Most producers say this fee has become symbolic and is generally hard to collect. Half of that is payable at the time of commencement, with the other half reserved for “abandonment” — that is, it’s a parting payment if a project is effectively canceled. (Fun fact: Per multiple members of Producers United, not a single studio has engaged in abandonment since the mid-aughts, when Paramount Pictures disastrously let the rights to “The Twilight Saga” books lapse. Those five film adaptations grossed more than $3 billion worldwide for another distributor, Summit Entertainment.) \n\n\tSetting up a project entails a producer transferring all rights to their source material to the buyer. Their real compensation is a “producer’s fee” — an agreed-upon sum paid for all services rendered, which is based on experience, achieving certain metrics of success (like reaching box office or ratings benchmarks) and any accolades a project receives. The producer’s fee is parsed out in stages, beginning eight weeks before production starts and wrapping up after delivery. \n\t\n\n\tBut because the career producers have no union, they say, their credits and fees are vulnerable to being gutted by studios and financiers — as well as straight-up pirate behavior from talent (wittingly or unwittingly) and their representatives, who take money that had been allocated for producers. The career producers’ work has not gone unnoticed, especially by IATSE — the powerful union representing craft, technical staff and crew — which has had an eye on the growth of this new collective. \n\n\tIt is IATSE’s insurance fund that career producers have requested the studios and streamers pay into on their behalf. But in contrast to union plans for actors, writers and directors, the Producers United ask is not for year-round coverage but rather for the time frame that encompasses all production phases. “We believe that all entertainment workers deserve to be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace — career producers are no different. IATSE has watched with interest as these workers have organized and begun to advocate for fair treatment,” says Mike Miller, department director of IATSE’s Motion Picture & Television Production.\n\n\tThe next fight to be waged is against “credit proliferation” — which will take more space than the back of a cocktail napkin to explain. What it means, and why it has happened, reads like a manifesto of why the producers are aggrieved and joining forces.  \n\n\tIt’s here they face an unpleasant reality: The talent managers, actors and financiers they rely on to get films across the finish line are cutting into their fees. While some actors, such as Warren Beatty and Reese Witherspoon, historically have also been skilled producers, nowadays many receive their credits “way upstream” in deals between their agents and studios, says Producers United.  \n\t\n\n\tYet there’s been something of an actor-producer renaissance in recent years. Wang attributes this, in part, to the fact that sets have not historically been the safest for some talent, so actors have stepped up to maintain integrity for fellow performers. To say nothing of the fact that A-listers have become some of the most-followed people on earth on social platforms, giving them marketing powers beyond the scope of studios. Wall Street also backed the celebrification of the average production company. Look at Candle Media’s 2021 investment in Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine, which brought that shop to an eye-popping $1 billion valuation, or the heated courting of LeBron James’ SpringHill Co., which wound up with an overall deal at Universal. \n\n\tProducers United is quick to say that there are capable producers who are also actors, but many take credits as trophies — typically brokered by reps or offered up by weary business affairs executives looking to get contracts closed fast — with no intention of doing the work. \n\n\t“Nowadays, talent comes in as a producer and they’ve got a best friend or a cousin or a spouse that’s running their company. Should I have to share my fee if I’m the only one producing the movie?” says one Producers United member who asked to remain anonymous.\n\n\tThe concept of credit proliferation broke into public awareness in January with the announcement of last year’s Academy Award nominees for best picture — an award that is given to a film’s producers. Five of the 10 nominees had “TBD” in place of names, as eligibility for the prize was still being determined by the Academy and PGA. (Those films were “Emilia Pérez,” “Nickel Boys,” “I’m Still Here,” “The Substance” and “The Brutalist.”)  \n\n\t Cathy Schulman, chair of Producers United, was incredulous. In an op-ed published shortly after the nominations were unveiled, she asked bluntly: “Did five of the films eligible for the top film prize in the world produce themselves? Of course not.” Examples abound in the current awards season. Gus Van Sant’s latest film, “Dead Man’s Wire,” has 93 credited producers, 13 of whom are listed as capital-P Producers. \n\t\n\n\tHaving a big star above the title is a large part of the reason why people buy tickets to a movie or decide to watch a show. Megastars like Tom Cruise and Margot Robbie have often wound up producing their own work, but a significant shift arrived with the streamers. Apple, Amazon and Netflix were so desperate to lock up top talent that they became even more liberal with giving actors producer credits to go along with their perks and paydays. The hangover, Producers United argues, is that many performers feel entitled to a producer credit, suggesting their very involvement propels a project forward.  \n\n\tLeadership at Producers United say that all major talent agencies they met with when they started out agreed that negotiating producer credits for star clients is now an industry standard. Some actors aren’t even aware. A 2018 interview with Natalie Portman, on the press tour for Brady Corbet’s “Vox Lux,” saw the actress learn in real time that she was an executive producer on the project. “That’s awesome,” Portman told one outlet. “I guess that’s something my agents added in and I didn’t realize.” [In later years, Portman would go on to form MountainA, which produced “May December” and this year’s “Arco”]\n\n\tIndustry insiders were equally stunned to see Scarlett Johansson reject a producer credit on 2025’s “Thunderbolts” from Marvel Studios. “I asked to have my credit removed because I wasn’t involved,” Johansson revealed this year, disclosing she’d gotten the credit in the first place because of a previous contract. \n\n\tIt may be too late to fundamentally change the status quo. But Producers United has drawn up a checklist of tangible producing duties talent must fulfill if they want the credit — including being present on location during preproduction, sharing budgetary responsibility and even  vetting key department heads. Another solution the group is exploring is enlisting wide industry support to return the luster of the “executive producer” credit, which denotes importance to a project’s existence but does not raid the core producer fee. \n\n\tIf the career producer does not have a path to survival, says Producers United, the biggest casualty will be the consumer. Take it from one of the most successful franchise film producers in the medium’s history. \n\t\n\n\t“Career producers are the guardians of narrative integrity and emotional truth,” says Producers United member Broccoli, who just handed custody of the James Bond franchise to Amazon MGM after 11 films. “When the producer’s hand is diminished, quality suffers, and the audience feels this loss.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRicky Gervais‘ next stand-up special will arrive on Netflix on Dec. 30.\n\n\t“Mortality,” the hour he’s been touring since 2024, was filmed in 2025 at the London Palladium. It’s Gervais’ fourth stand-up special — following “Humanity,” “Supernature” and “Armageddon” — and it promises “no topic is off limits as Ricky closes out the year with his best show yet.”\n\n\tPer the logline, “Gervais takes on his own mortality in a brutally honest and darkly funny stand-up special about his life, death and the state of the world.” The provocative comic’s previous work has touched on mortality as well, most notably his Netflix series “After Life,” about a man mourning the death of his wife.\n\t\n\n\t“I think ‘Mortality’ is my most honest and confessional show so far and also my favourite tour. I still can’t believe what a privilege it is to fly around the world making people laugh,” Gervais said in a statement.\n\n\n\tGervais’ 2023 special “Armageddon” topped the Netflix charts and won the comedian a Golden Globe award. He will complete his arena tour of “Mortality” in December ahead of the special’s release, promising to donate a portion of the proceeds to charity.\n\n\tGervais is known for co-creating and starring in the original British series “The Office,” which was later adapted into one of the most-watched American TV series of all time. He’s won seven BAFTA awards and two Emmys, and he hosted the Golden Globes five times, delivering now-famous monologues that took aim at the starry Hollywood audience.\n\n\tHe has long partnered with Netflix for his creative endeavors, and when Gervais came under fire in 2022 for jokes that were seen as anti-trans, streaming boss Ted Sarandos came to his defense, saying that comedians figure out where the line is by “crossing the line every once in a while.” Sarandos added: “I think it’s very important to the American culture generally to have free expression.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt took two decades for Laura Poitras, the director of Oscar winner “Citizenfour” and Oscar nominee “All the Beauty and the Bloodshed,” to convince Pulitzer-winning journalist Seymour Hersh to let her make a film about his career. The long-gestating project finally became a reality three years ago, with Hersh allowing Poitras and co-director Mark Obenhaus, a long-time friend of his, full access to his archives. The result of the monumental work of research and months of in-depth interviews is “Cover-Up,” which had its world premiere at Venice and now plays at IDFA. \n\t\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety out of the Dutch festival, the directing duo say their collaboration was designed after three months of creating a proof of concept for not only the film but also how to work together. Alongside producer Olivia Streisand, the two conducted meticulous pre-research. “I felt strongly that I needed to know there was a strong archival base to pull from,” says Poitras. “My approach to filmmaking is scene-based. I had questions like: ‘What footage do we have from the 60s and 70s with Sy (Seymour’s nickname) talking about his work that I can approach from a cinematic way?’”\n\n\n\t“From that, we developed an idea of how to approach interviewing him, which was kind of unusual because there were three of us, as Olivia also became a participant in the interview giving us material that could bolster the line of questioning,” adds Obenhaus. “That whole process was quite original actually, and unexpectedly unique to this project.”\n\n\tThe film chronicles Hersh’s lauded career, from breaking the My Lai massacre carried out by U.S. soldiers in Vietnam, to writing dozens of stories on Watergate and exposing major scandals such as the mind-control experiments of MK-ULTRA and the torture and abuse of prisoners by U.S. soldiers in Abu Ghraib. \n\t\n\n\tIn his review of the film, Variety critic Owen Gleiberman questions the current state of investigative journalism and why major news organizations such as the New York Times are not digging deeper into stories like Jeffrey Epstein’s, stating: “The movie is called ‘Cover-Up’ because cover-up is the metaphysical state we live in.” “We had a lot of rules going in because the film is a portrayal of Sy but also of the United States. The film is not a biopic, we are not interested in a biopic. We were anchored by Sy and his reporting, but always wanted to make it relevant to contemporary audiences,” says Poitras of the film’s relevance at a time where the increasingly unstable relationship between the U.S. government and traditional media is constantly making headlines and the use of AI threatens audiences’ trust in news sources. \n\n\t“One of the joys of making this film was imagining how it might resonate for journalists and particularly staff working at legacy institutions,” notes Poitras. “I can’t imagine Sy not being able to use certain words to describe what is happening in the world. The idea journalists are not allowed to use words like genocide in news organizations today is evidence of what is happening around us.”\n\n\tAsked about how they see their film in light of a case like Trump’s threatened lawsuit against the BBC for defamation over documentary program “Panorama’s” editing of his Jan. 6, 2021 speech, Poitras says that despite Trump’s history of threatening legal action against news vehicles, in this case, the British major “made a mistake.” \n\n\t“If you want to talk about the BBC, they made a mistake,” she emphasizes. “They should have retracted it. They should have acknowledged, corrected, and apologized for it immediately. They made an edit that created a new meaning that didn’t exist. This is not to say that the institution loses its credibility, but they made a mistake. When people talk about their lack of trust in the media, it’s things like this. If you make a mistake, you have to own it and be transparent with your readers because otherwise you lose trust.”\n\n\tObenhaus says that despite what Poitras say being “very much true,” “the absolute irony is that Trump of all people could find fault with this issue of editing when you could go down a day’s list of his distortions of fact. It’s breathtaking and the irony of it all doesn’t escape me, let’s put it that way,” he adds.\n\t\n\n\tGiven the timeliness of the film, getting audiences to see it becomes even more pressing. For “Cover-Up,” Poitras is working with Netflix for the first time, with the streamer releasing the film in select theaters in the U.K. and the U.S. on Dec. 5 before adding the film to its streaming platform in over 190 countries from Dec. 26. \n\n\t“We are both grateful to Netflix and Plan B for the support,” says Obenhaus. “But I am concerned about the nature of streaming and how the algorithms dominate the suggestions you are given. Our hope is that we can expand the natural audience for this film to include audiences of people who are not aware of Sy’s work and who would find his experience as a journalist relevant to today’s times. The jury’s still out in my mind as to how successful we’ll be at that with Netflix, but I am very optimistic.” \n\n\tPoitras emphasizes it is “important” to mention Netflix “did not ask us to change a frame,” adding that the streamer’s reach is “extraordinary.” “I made no secret that I really love and believe in the theatrical run and, particularly, that documentary is cinema and should have a theatrical life. We will have three weeks. I wish it were longer, but a lot of filmmakers say the same. I think everybody benefits from longer theatrical windows. I think a film can be part of the cultural zeitgeist. Cinema is a collective experience; I fell in love with cinema sitting in a dark room with strangers, and I still believe in that.”\n\n\tAs for the decrease in funding and institutional support for documentarians, Poitras says that being at a festival like IDFA allows people to see “the extraordinary work filmmakers are doing” despite the challenges. “But we are also seeing a contraction of funding and risk aversion in the distribution landscape, particularly for politically-driven films. The documentaries you are seeing are extraordinary, with the kind of risk-taking that is not bending to constraints. There is this bravery happening amongst filmmakers. What we are seeing is institutions failing us.”\n",

Higgins will star as Jane Hines, Frank’s “sharp, rebellious and emotionally self-contained” twin sister.\n\t\n\n\tYoung will portray Suzanne, Frank’s recent ex and Jane’s former best friend while Boyce takes on the role of Ada, Jane’s closest confidant. Gallo and Lane will play Maggie and Nancy,  Frank and Jane’s mothers.\n\n\n\t​“Discomfort, Texas” centers on the aftermath of a car accident that puts Frank’s twin sister Jane in a coma and causes Frank to spiral. According to the official logline, “Once defined by his intense connection with Jane, Frank must travel to the area of the crash to sift through the emotional wreckage.”\n\n\t​Set to a soundtrack by “Goodnight, Texas” and “Deloyd Elze,” the film is described as “a love-letter to the beauty found during loss as well as the cinematic landscape of the American Southwest.”​\n\n\t“When you’re born a twin, you grow up with an unspoken promise: you will never truly be alone,” Mellon said about the film. “I wrote ‘Discomfort, Texas’ for the same reason we once told each other those stories: to make sense of our pain, our questioning, our dark corners in an effort to find light within them.”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “But now I’m not just telling this story for Nora and me to help us fall asleep. ‘Discomfort, Texas’ is a reminder to anyone who has faced loss that when you truly love someone, they are never really gone.”\n\n\t​“Discomfort,Texas” is also produced by David Zalasin and Ellie Johnston.\n",

    "body": "\n\n\tWes Anderson fans are a particular breed of cinephile, which makes shopping for them its own delightful production. Thankfully — if you look in the right places — charming items can be found online. Think symmetry, pastels, nostalgia and the kind of tactile, analog treasures that look like they were sourced from a meticulously labeled prop closet.\n\n\tThis season’s best Wes-inspired gifts nod to the director’s storybook worlds without feeling costume-y, spanning collectible editions, statement decor and accessories that practically beg to be arranged in a satisfyingly centered flat-lay. In other words: items worthy of a Margot, a Gustave or a Steve Zissou in your life.\n\n\tCheck out our ultimate Wes Anderson gift guide to shop this year below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tOrganized chronologically, this 288-page tome displays Narbonne’s years of research and film expertise to cover every short film and movie that Anderson has ever directed, including behind-the-scenes stories of how each project was conceived, cast and produced. Narbonne also explores the director’s unique filmmaking style, his relationship with regular cast members like Owen Wilson and Bill Murray and his stories’ recurring themes. It also includes hundreds of photographs to celebrate the visual imagery that has made Anderson a cult favorite director.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe latest volume in the bestselling “Wes Anderson Collection” series is finally here, an official behind-the-scenes companion to Anderson’s tenth feature film “The French Dispatch.” In the 256-page tome everything that goes into bringing Anderson’s trademark style, meticulous compositions, and exacting production design to the screen is revealed in detail. Written by film and television critic and New York Times bestselling author Matt Zoller Seitz, The Wes Anderson Collection: The French Dispatch presents the complete story behind the film’s conception, anecdotes about the making of the film and behind-the-scenes photos, production materials and artwork.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Asteroid City” is accompanied by yet another companion book in this collection of work that inspired Wes Anderson’s newest film. The book compiles new and classic writing on mid-century cinema and the American West, in addition to an exclusive interview with Anderson in which the director details how each piece influenced the characters, stories and settings in the film.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tA No 1 bestseller since coming out in 2020, this captivating photo book is a celebration of the stunning visual imagery Wes Anderson is known for. Part travel guide and part visual adventure, the stunning book includes more than 200 of the most beautiful, most idiosyncratic and most “Wes Anderson-esque” destinations across the globe, known for their quirky landscapes and cinematic aesthetics. Anderson helped Koval in curating the destinations featured on every page, accompanied by the very real, human stories behind each photo.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tTake some notes from Franklin Bean this fall by making your very own alcoholic cider. While this DIY kit won’t be able to ferment and brew hard cider in mere seconds like the magical machine in “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” it comes pretty close. This all-in-one kit includes all the equipment needed to make up to three batches of delicious, bubbly alcoholic cider at home, in addition to ten, non twist-off bottles. Pair it with this sleek carafe to rival Mr. Bean’s cider jugs.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tWhile it may be hard to recreate the delicious cream-filled pastries, called the Courtesan au Chocolat, from “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” you can still take a trip to the whimsical Mendl’s Bakery with this classic pink mug.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t(c)Buena Vista Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tNo one pulls off a red beret better than Rushmore Academy’s Max Fischer, the eccentric 15 year-old at the center of Anderson’s beloved 1998 film. Whether you want to dress up as the Jason Schwartzman character for Halloween or feel like adding a Parisian twist to your style, you can’t go wrong with a classic red beret.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAny Wes Anderson fan has a special place in their heart for “Bottle Rocket,” the acclaimed director’s first feature film from 1996, starring Owen and Luke Wilson. This Criterion Collection Blu-Ray set features commentary by Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson, in addition to a documentary about the making of “Bottle Rocket,” directed by filmmaker Barry Braverman. Plus, the box set includes 11 deleted scenes and a booklet featuring an essay by executive producer James L. Brooks.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAside from Ben Stiller’s red tracksuit and Gwenyth Paltrow’s fur coat, one of the most memorable visual elements from Anderson’s 2001 film are the heavily decorated walls. Now, you can bring the stunning “Royal Tenenbaums” aesthetic into your own home with this stick-and-peel version of Margot Tenenbaum’s distinct zebra-printed wallpaper.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe Anderson soundtrack is known for injecting the perfect mood-setting French track whether it’s the Yves Montand “Rue St. Vincent” mix tape Max plays in “Rushmore,” Joe Dassin’s “Les Champs-Elysees” from “The Darjeeling Limited” or Francoise Hardy’s “Le temps de l’amour” in the delightful “Moonrise Kingdom” beach dance off. So for the super in-the-know why not purchase a record with the track for your favorite Anderson obsessive. And if you can find a vinyl print of “The Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra” (also featured in “Moonrise Kingdom”) please let me know!\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tPerfect for Roald Dahl and Wes Anderson fans alike, this comprehensive coffee table book dives into the making of Anderson’s adaptation of Dahl’s beloved children’s book from 1970. The Oscar-nominated film is a departure from Anderson’s usual style of filmmaking, which is why the behind-the-scenes look featured in these pages, from set photos to shot analyses, are so intriguing for big Anderson fans. Check out more coffee table books to gift this year here. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe essence of a few of his beloved films — “Bottle Rocket,” “Rushmore,” “The Royal Tenenbaums,” “The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou,” “The Darjeeling Limited,” “Fantastic Mr. Fox” and “Moonrise Kingdom” — is captured in this New York Times bestselling overview. The book is written by film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz with an introduction by Michael Chabon.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“The Grand Budapest Hotel” is peak Wes Anderson, filled to the brim with rich colors and arresting visuals that transport viewers to the fictional country of Zubrowka  in the 1930s where an unassuming concierge boy Gustave becomes a prime suspect in a mysterious murder. Any film lover will appreciate this visual screenplay, which takes readers through every action-packed scene line by line, accompanied by the best shots and images from the film.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThese minimalist prints are a perfect edition to any office or reading room, offering unique visual takes on the movie posters of Anderson’s most famous films such as “The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou,” “Moonrise Kingdom” and “Rushmore,” among others.

    "body": "\n\tFox News is really starting to get religion.\n\n\tThe Fox Corp. division may best be known for the conservative hosts who fill its primetime schedule each weekday evening with what detractors would say is fire-and-brimstone oratory, but in the streaming wars, the company is working to make a name for itself with content tied to subjects of faith and spirituality. And executives hope a burgeoning “Fox Faith” vertical will lure more subscribers to its Fox Nation subscription service and bigger audiences to other parts of the company.\n\t\n\n\tWhen it comes to faith-based programming, “I think there is an insatiable appetite among a very passionate audience that is underserved,” says Jason Klarman, chief digital and marketing officer at Fox News Media, during a recent interview.\n\n\n\tFox News Media is expected to announce Wednesday that it will launch a 52-episode podcast series, “The Life of Jesus Podcast,” starting Sunday, November 30, as part of a licensing deal with Gulfstream Studios. “Fox & Friends” co-host Ainsley Earhardt will introduce each half-hour episode, guiding listeners through the life and teachings of Christ. Among the actors voicing characters in the series are  Kristen Bell, who plays Mary Magdalene; Sean Astin, who plays Matthew; Neal McDonough, who plays Jesus; Brian Cox, who represents  the Voice of God; Malcolm McDowell, who portrays Caiaphas; John Rhys-Davies, who narrates; and Julia Ormond, who voices Mary, Mother of God.\n\n\tFox News Media will release the episodes dates tied to the Christian calendar. The first 13 episodes debut to mark the start of Advent. Thirteen more will be released December 21, during the run-up to Christmas. Thirteen more will surface on February 15, in time for Lent. And the final batch of 13 appear March 29, on Palm Sunday. \n\t\n\n\tEarhardt, who may have helped spark the development of “Fox Faith” with an early Fox Nation show focused on Bible study, believes more people are eager for content that helps them grapple with the difficult news stories and information overload that have become part of daily life. She says she has often looked for sermons on YouTube tied to raising children, a subject in which she has strong interest, but likes the idea of being able to turn to a library of well-produced programming.\n\n\t“I just am excited that more people are open to talking about faith,” she says, noting that her grandmother devoted significant time to Bible study, but may not have found a lot of people willing to discuss it with her on a regular basis.\n\n\tWhile the number of U.S. residents who say religion is important to their daily lives represents a minority of the overall populace, the group has been growing. Pew Research found in February of this year that 31% of U.S. adults of U.S. indicated religion was gaining influence in American life. The figure represents the highest the organization has seen in 15 years. In February of 2024, a similar Pew survey found just 18% of U.S. adults felt religion was gaining influence in life in the United States.\n\n\tFox News is simply acting on what it learns from consumer response, says Klarman. Executives noticed that Earhardt’s Bible study series got a lift around the holiday season, and noted robust sales for books from Fox News personalities like Shannon Bream, who has examined the Bible in three different efforts she has authored. “Data tells us what they like and what they are doing, and we execute against it.”\n\n\tFaith-based programming may hold more appeal in a world that depends more heavily on social media, suggests Matti Leshem, the creator of the Fox Nation docuseries “Saints,” which delves into the lives of John the Baptist, Thomas Becket and others.  The average person spends more hours with media outlets that spur comparisons with other people, he says, and often contain information that is not entirely accurate. Little wonder, Leshem says, that in a “fractured, divided world” people are seeking inspiration.  \n\n\tThe new Fox News Media podcast launches following the debut of the program’s second season. The first cycle of the show was the “best performing series on Fox Nation,” says Klarman. The series has the “best engagement” of viewers and the “best acquisition” of subscribers, the executive adds. Fox News doesn’t regularly disclose the total subscription base to Fox Nation, but Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch said in March that the outlet had an estimated 2 million to 2.5 million subscribers.\n\t\n\n\tKey to the success of “Saints” is its broader appeal, says Leshem, a producer who c the series with the backing of director Martin Scorsese.  Stories of the lives of John the Baptist and Saint Sebastien and others who have been portrayed are filled with “moral heroism,” says Leshem. “I think that people are drawn to that whether you’re an atheist or a believer or someone in between.”\n\n\t“These are really inspiring stories,” he adds. “This is a very hard-hitting show, a very dramatic show. There’s nothing very Sunday school about it at all.”  With more than 10,000 saints, he says, “I could do this for the rest of my life.”\n\n\tFox News Media is looking for other areas of growth, says Klarman. Among them is a Fox News Wine Shop that specializes in wines made in the U.S., some of them cultivated by veterans. A “tasty Tempranillo” offered from Texas may not be something consumed by any of the Saints portrayed in the documentary series, but Fox News likely has already identified a certain segment of its audience that has a thirst.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tLast month at Sundance, Chase Sapphire cardmembers rubbed shoulders with stars such as Alexander Skarsgård and Jenna Ortega; purchased early-access tickets to coveted premieres such as “The Moment;” and sat front row to intimate industry panels. \n\n\tThis past weekend, meanwhile, Hilton Honors members attended the 2026 Grammy Awards, where they saw performances from Justin Bieber, KATSEYE, Lola Young, Alex Warren and more live from the Crypto Arena. But members not only attended the start-studded awards show, they were also treated to a three-night stay at The Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills (a Hilton property) and an in-room glam appointment: the full VIP treatment. \n\n\n\tThese are just two recent examples of how loyalty programs – spanning credit cards to hotels – are focusing less on points alone, but access to exclusive, culture-driving events. The timing is no accident. According to Hilton’s 2026 Trends Report, one in five global travelers cite entertainment and sporting events as the primary reason behind their travel plans, while 86% say they value experiences more than material gifts. Brands are responding accordingly, reframing loyalty not as a discount mechanism, but as a way to anchor trips around moments that feel culturally consequential. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNicholas Braun and Dave Franco at The Shitheads cast party \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoshua Lawton for Chase\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTaika Waititi and Alexander Skarsgard at The Gallerist cast party \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoshua Lawton for Chase\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJenna Ortega, director Cathy Yan and Natalie Portman at The Gallerist cast party \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoshua Lawton for Chase\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAt Sundance, the Chase Sapphire Reserve served as the homebase for cardmembers, where they were able to able to step inside for complimentary food and drinks, priority seating for daily panels and a warm refuge between premieres — all without the need for additional credentials beyond their Reserve card.  \n\n\n\tPerhaps the best perk was the ability to skip the long lines and waitlists for buzzy events – in Park City’s freezing cold temperature, no less. Throughout the weekend, Channing Tatum and Gemma Chan (“Josephine”); Kiernan Shipka, Dave Franco and Nicholas Braun (“The Shitheads”) and Natalie Portman and Jenna Ortega (“The Gallerist”) were just a few of the bold-faced names who strolled through Chase’s Reserve hub to celebrate their movies. Food, too, played a role in the strategy. Chase brought in Frasca Food and Wine for a pop-up residency in Park City, with reservations snapped up quickly via OpenTable. \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tThese perks expand beyond awards season. Hilton has been scaling an access model across sports, wellness and culinary travel through its Hilton Honors Experiences platform, which allows members to redeem points for highly curated, passion-driven moments worldwide. Available offerings range from a McLaren Mastercard F1 Team VIP Experience in Shanghai and a VIP package for the 2026 Carabao Cup Final in London, to a Seychellois culinary immersion, a 110-minute signature treatment at the Waldorf Astoria Spa Los Cabos Pedregal and even an Aescape AI-powered massage in Salt Lake City.  \n\n\tWhether it’s Sundance, the Grammys or an F1 race, these companies are repositioning their rewards programs as a gateway to culturally and experientially significant moments. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tPeacock is back with a new streaming deal, just in time for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan Cortina.\n\n\tThe NBCUniversal streaming service is the official streamer for this year’s Olympic Winter Games, not to mention the streaming home to Sunday’s Super Bowl LX game. Now, sports fans can get in on all the action with a couple of deals that discount the price of a monthly Peacock membership.\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat Are the Best Peacock Streaming Deals 2026?\t\n\n\tA subscription to Peacock normally starts at $10.99/month for the Peacock Premium plan, which gets you access to live sports and events, plus thousands of hours of on-demand TV shows, movies and specials. But the streamer is offering an annual plan discount right now that gets you 12 months of access for the price of ten.\n\n\n\tThe total price is $109 and locks in access for an entire year. That saves you 17% versus paying for Peacock month to month. The limited-time offer is available to all new and eligible returning subscribers and there is no promo code needed.\n\n\tPeacock has priced its annual subscription down to as low as $79.99 a year in the past but with the streamer being home to the Olympics and Super Bowl, it’s unlikely we’ll see a further discount from the current promotion live online.\n\n\tAnother way to score a Peacock discount online is by bundling the streamer with Apple TV (formerly Apple TV+). The Apple TV and Peacock Premium bundle costs just $14.99/month — a savings of 40% versus paying for each streamer separately.\n\n\tPeacock is also home to hundreds of new movies such as “Bugonia,” “F1” and “Black Phone 2” plus fan-favorite shows like “Pluribus,” “New Girl,” Bel-Air,” “The Office” and the Bravo universe franchises.\n\n\n\tPeacock is also a top-choice streamer for sports fans, who can live stream live sports like the NFL, Premier League, Big Ten Football, and WWE. \n\t\n\t\tDoes Peacock Have a Free Trial?\t\n\n\tWhile Peacock doesn’t currently offer a free trial, you can get Peacock for free with a Walmart+ membership. Walmart+ costs $98/year and as part of your membership, members can choose between Peacock Premium or Paramount+ Essential at no added cost.\n\n\tThat’s in addition to perks like free shipping, free grocery delivery, special discounts, gas savings and more. Sign up for Walmart+ here (you can also test-drive the service with a 30-day free trial here).\n\n\tYou can also stream Peacock online for free with Instacart+. The grocery delivery service offers an upgraded tier that gets members free grocery delivery, free restaurant delivery and an annual membership to Peacock for free. Instacart+ costs just $9.99/month or $99/year. Try it out with a 14-day free trial here.\n\n\tThis year’s Winter Olympics air from Feb. 6 to 22 live from Milan, Italy.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGavin Newsom is the latest figure to be roasted by “The Daily Show” in a new installment of its “Daily Showography” series — this one tracks the California governor’s personal and political scandals. The seven-minute segment will air as part of Wednesday night’s broadcast of the Comedy Central talk show.\n\n\tPresented as an awards-season “for your consideration” spot, the satirical biography ribs Newsom for being a “leading man” who is “now playing in select venues, but is preparing to be released nationwide” — a reference to the likelihood of his 2028 presidential bid.\n\t\n\n\tThe narrator of the segment pokes fun at Newsom’s “classic rags to riches story” — quoting the governor as saying, “My father, his closest friends in the world were some of the richest families in the world” — before quipping, “Fine, he’s a nepo baby, but so is Dakota Johnson and we love her.”\n\n\n\t“The Daily Show” then chronicles Newsom’s post-college years, when he started a wine company “with nothing but his grit, his refined palate and the financial backing of an oil tycoon.” Says the snarky narrator: “Things were finally starting to work out for this tall, handsome, athletic, well-connected young man.”\n\n\tNewsom then “landed his biggest role to date” as mayor of San Francisco. “The Daily Show” acknowledges Newsom’s role in advancing the legalization of same-sex marriage while simultaneously skewering him for having an affair with the wife of one of his staffers.\n\n\tMost of all, the “biofilm” mocks Newsom for his failures to end California’s homelessness crisis or build high-speed rail from San Francisco to Los Angeles. In the video, Newsom is clipped again and again — from 2010 to 2025 — promising to solve these persistent issues. (A fast train connecting the state’s two biggest cities is still a pipe dream, with Newsom recently boasting about construction on a rail line in Central California. “Soon, this futuristic bullet train will take people from the thriving hub of Merced all the way to the shining metropolis of Bakersfield,” the narrator quips.)\n\t\n\n\tOf course, no roast of Newsom would be complete without mentioning his pandemic setbacks, including the French Laundry scandal and the recall election. “The Daily Show” has an idea for why Newsom was ultimately re-elected: “Luckily, the COVID vaccine meant he could show his whole face again, so he won easily.”\n\n\tThe segment concludes with Newsom’s ascent to becoming a 2028 frontrunner, asking viewers to “consider Gavin Newsom: a screen-ready Christian Bale type … he’s more than a politician; he’s a leading man.”\n\n\t“The Daily Showography” has also produced segments skewering Joe Rogan, Jeff Bezos, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Marco Rubio and Vladimir Putin. The Comedy Central program received two Emmy nominations this year for editing for a segment in a variety program — for its episodes on Stephen Miller and Kamala Harris.\n\n\tWatch “The Daily Showography of Gavin Newsom: Leading Man for Your Consideration” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Swift has revealed that she plans to release the music video for “Opalite” later this week.\n\n\tLike with many reveals during the “Life of a Showgirl” era, the singer posted a countdown on her website to the “Opalite” music video. Only this time, there was no ambiguity about when it would arrive, with her site stating that the visual will be exclusively made available on Apple Music and Spotify Premium on Friday, February 6 at 8 a.m. ET. Those streaming services will have the video exclusively until February 8 at 8 a.m. ET, when the video will become available to watch on YouTube.\n\t\n\n\tAdditionally, fans were given access to a new “Opalite” blue pearlescent vinyl on her website. Preorders are available until February 6 at 7 p.m ET or until supplies last.\n\n\n\t“Opalite” is the second single from “The Life of a Showgirl” and previously debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. For the past 17 weeks, the song has been a chart mainstay, slotting at No. 10 on the latest tally.\n\n\tSwift released “The Life of a Showgirl” in October, selling 2.7 million copies on release day and later eclipsing Adele’s “25” for the most consumption in Billboard 200 history. The album yielded the first single “The Fate of Ophelia” along with a music video that debuted during “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl.” Over on the Hot 100, “The Fate of Ophelia” became her 13th song to hit No. 1 and spent 10 non-consecutive weeks atop the chart.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSam Claflin revealed on Fearne Cotton’s “Happy Place” podcast (via The Independent) that his body dysmorphia was exacerbated by his Hollywood acting roles, which often required him to appear shirtless on screen. Claflin is best known for playing Finnick Odair in “The Hunger Games” franchise, starting with “Catching Fire.” He made his film debut in “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.”\n\n\t“A lot of the roles I played earlier on in my career… I had a topless scene in one of my first movies, but it wasn’t in the script and I got told a week before they were going to [take] my top off,” Claflin said. “I was like, ‘Shit, I haven’t been working out, what am I going to do?’ This is my first introduction to the world.”\n\t\n\n\tClaflin said earlier in the chat, “I’m incredibly insecure. I just went to a screening of a film I was in and everyone immediately afterwards [asked], ‘How was it?’ And [I was like,] ‘I hated it.’ It’s my face I don’t like [it]’. When I was cast in ‘Pirates,’  I thought: ‘What on earth am I doing here?'”\n\n\tThe actor previously told The Telegraph in 2025 that “there’s this Hollywood assumption that it’s the men with the six packs who sell the movie. So there was a pressure that was what I needed to look like. As a result, I developed a form of body dysmorphia. It wasn’t quite an eating disorder, and I’m not blaming anyone but myself, but it was definitely because of the industry I’m in.”\n\n\tExpanding on the topic with Cotton on the recent podcast episode, Claflin said, “I’ve been massively affected [by body dysmorphia]. I’d say most guys are, but I would say mine got quite bad… It’s a real struggle. It’s like an everyday struggle. I am massively impacted by what other people think and if they think I look good or am a nice person.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter breaking out in Hollywood with big studio franchise fare, which also included “Snow White and the Huntsman,” Claflin starred in the romance “Me Before You” and several indies, including “Their Finest” and “Adrift.” His performance as Billy Dunne in the 2023 Hulu series “Daisy Jones & the Six” earned him a Golden Globe nomination. \n\n\tWatch Claflin’s full interview on the “Happy Place” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tScott Printz, a producer whose credits included ABC’s “How to Get Away With Murder,” Apple TV’s “Truth Be Told” and HBO/Max’s “Bookie,” died Jan. 23 in Los Angeles after an illness. He was 69.\n\n\tPrintz began his entertainment career as a Directors Guild of America trainee before advancing to second and first assistant director on film and television productions. He later transitioned to unit production manager and then producer, starting with Shonda Rhimes’ long-running ABC series “Private Practice.”\n\t\n\n\tHe became a sought-after producer in both comedy and drama, working on numerous successful television shows for network primetime and streaming platforms. Printz was a member of the DGA and the Television Academy.\n\n\n\tHis other producing credits include “American Auto,” “Pivoting,” “The Mayor” and “Intelligence.”\n\n\tColleagues recognized Printz for his excellence, warmth, calm demeanor and even-handed leadership style.\n\n\t“Scott was a gentle, confident leader of the pack,” said director and frequent collaborator Andy Tennant.\n\n\tCinematographer Tim Shurstedt praised Printz’s comprehensive understanding of production. “There are only a couple of people I’ve worked with who were as knowledgeable about what all the departments did and what their needs were,” Shurstedt said. “Scott was extraordinarily intelligent and unfailingly honest. Production crews trusted and respected him.”\n\n\tJanet Carol Norton, Printz’s longtime agent, said he would be remembered for his collaborative approach, personality and humor.\n\n\tHis sons, Arlen and Jesse, remembered their father as someone who listened without judgment, loved them unconditionally and inspired their curiosity.\n\t\n\n\tAn avid sportsman, Printz shared his passion for the ocean and wilderness with his family. He also shared his love of music and films, his enthusiasm for cooking and his excitement about the projects that took him around the world.\n\n\tHe is survived by his wife, former casting director Shani Ginsberg; sons Arlen and Jesse; Jesse’s partner, Christina Lelon; siblings Matthew, Kyle and Vicki; and mother Shirley.\n\n\tDonations in Printz’s honor can be made to The Nature Conservancy and The Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research at IMBCR.org.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDior ambassador Anya Taylor-Joy was fresh from spending Monday afternoon in Santa Monica promoting her new action series “Lucky” at Apple TV’s press day when she arrived at the Dior Addict Sweet Shop party on the Sunset Strip.\n\n\tThe candy-themed pop-up, marking the launch of the French luxury brand’s the launch of Dior Addict Lip Glow Oils and fragrances, offered guests pink cookies, pastel gummies and gumballs as well as a bundt cake dessert bar. Eyeing a lollipop inscribed with the Dior logo, Taylor-Joy said, “That is quite chic.”\n\t\n\n\tTaylor-Joy was wearing a white dress with blue detailing. “It reminded me a little bit of Mr. Dior’s original Junon dress with the petals,” she told me. “It also gave me a slight Marie-Antoinette and Petit Trianon vibe. I thought, I’m going to a candy store, I might as well dress for it.”\n\n\n\tIt’s a much different vibe than “Lucky.” Taylor-Joy stars as a con-artist whose on the run after a major heist goes wrong. The series, premiering July 15, is an adaptation of Marissa Stapley’s novel of the same name. The cast also includes Annette Bening, Timothy Olyphant, Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, Drew Starkey, Clifton Collins, Jr. and William Fichtner.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnya Taylor-Joy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/WWD\n\t\n\n\n\n\t “I have done a lot of action in my life but I have never been on the run more than in this show,” she told Variety. “I was running all through California. I have seen it all.” She does have some regret. “You would think I would train for it, but I never do,” Taylor-Joy said. “It’s always the first day where I think I should have thought this through a little bit more.” \n\t\n\n\tThe Sweet Shop’s guest list also included McKenna Grace. “I’m genuinely a fan,” she told me. “I definitely use many of their products – the mascara, the perfume. The lip oils are my favorite.”\n\n\tIn November, Grace will be seen as Maysilee Donner in “The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping.” She talked about working opposite an almost unrecognizable Glenn Close as Drusilla Sickle. “Her makeup’s absurd,” Grace said. “Watching her walk around in these heels that are that tall [Grace spreads her hands about a foot from each other] is crazy every day. Watching her walk on set, especially with our two characters’ relationship, was very nerve-racking but exciting…It’s fun to be yelled at by her.”\n\n\tGrace is much more tight-lipped about “Scream 7.” She joins the franchise for the latest installment, but not much is known about who she is playing and what she has to do with the storyline. “I’ve seen every single [‘Scream’] so there was no studying that needed to be done for me,” she said. “I’m a very big fan. I’ve been a big fan for the longest time. I saw the last one in theaters. I love it, but I could say nothing else about it.”\n\n\n\tSee more photos from the Dior party below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnya Taylor-Joy and Willow Smith \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirisa Yong/BFA.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJi-young Yoo \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/WWD\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOdeya Rush \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/WWD\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWill Price \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/WWD\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMcKenna Grace \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/WWD\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLaetitia Hollard \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/WWD\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrancis Kurkdjian, Anya Taylor-Joy, Willow Smith and Peter Philips \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirisa Yong/BFA.com\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe evening before Music’s Biggest Night, there is always Music’s Smallest but Mightiest Night. That could serve as one way to describe the Americana Music Association’s annual Grammy Eve concert at the famed Troubadour club in West Hollywood, which is a very different kind of destination from the concurrent “Clive party.” The Americana affair annually presents itself as a tribute to one of the great singer-songwriters of all time, with a cast of performers partly pulled from a list of artists who are up for Grammys the following night. Many music titans have been saluted over the nearly 20 years the AMA has been doing this (think John Prine, Paul Simon and Willie Nelson), and there remain countless possibilities of music heroes who could still be feted with one of these evenings (like: they still haven’t done Dylan).\n\t\n\n\tBut perhaps they don’t really need to get to anyone else. Because…\n\n\n\t“It’s gonna be Neil Young next year, too. Every year, moving forward,” promised Molly Jenson, the night’s emcee and house-band vocalist, taking stock of how the setlist was barely scratching the surface of the honoree’s song portfolio. \n\n\tShe didn’t mean it, but doing a second year of Neil for 2027’s event really wouldn’t be a bad idea: Shakey has been nothing if not steady in his prolific output over the last 60 years. At this year’s concert, the generous 21-song performance leaned more toward Young’s most familiar-to-every-household classics than obscurities; in other words, no Americana takes on “Trans,” say, at this event. But virtually every performance felt transformative enough, whether the interpretations took his time-honored material more into adjacently rootsy subgenres or stayed right within the Young wheelhouse. (Or the Neil-house.)\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMargo Price, Sarah Jarosz, Sierra Hull and Rhiannon Giddens backstage at the Americana Fest Pre-Grammy Salute: The Songs of Neil Young takes place at The Troubadour on January 31, 2026, in Los Angeles, California. (Erika Goldring Photo)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tErika Goldring\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAmong the participating performers who were nominated for Grammys this year were a murderer’s row of Recording Academy darlings: I’m With Her (who went on to walk away with two on Sunday), Jesse Welles, Margo Price, Rhiannon Giddens, Sierra Hull, Maggie Rose and Grace Potter. The cast expanded to include returnees who’ve been favorites at past such AmericanaFest salutes, including Milk Carton Kids and Chris Pierce, and notable first-timers like Young the Giant. This year’s concert, officially billed as the AmericanaFest Pre-Grammy Salute to the Songs of Neil Young, easily sold out despite the $200 price tag (being a benefit for both MusiCares and the AMA) and the availability of a name-your-own-price livestream. You had to be there; except, with the free stream, you didn’t; except you kind of still did.\n\n\tGiddens made an early and glorious appearance in the show, dropping in with fellow former Carolina Chocolate Drop Justin Robinson to deliver “Comes a Time” in the banjo-and-fiddle configuration that was featured on their Grammy-nommed collaborative album, “What Did the Blackbird Say to the Crow.” (Justin Harrington joined in as a third on handheld percussion, which came in handy when the tune finally erupted into a very un-Neil-like double-time rush.)\n\n\n\n\n\t“Comes a Time” probably wouldn’t be mistaken for any of the Black folk traditional tunes on the duo’s recent album, but it was making Giddens think about race anyway, or at least the general overall atmosphere was. The crowd broke into an “Ice Out” chant during her commentary, and Giddens pointed to her button bearing that demand. “We are here also,” she said, “to remind about the history of this country, and slave catchers by any other name…” By the time she was finished with the song, it was a wonder tall trees weren’t falling down.\n\n\tRace figured in as an even more unmistakable undertone in Chris Pierce’s supple and defiant rendering of “Southern Man,” which was, by acclamation, the most powerful number of the night. Unlike most of the other performers, Pierce has had this in his repertoire and been able to absorb it and make it his for a while, since he has done it in concert before and recorded a studio version for a 2025 tribute album, “Heart of Gold: The Songs of Neil Young.” Seeing him do it live is an edge-of-your-seat experience, as he takes what Young wrote about racism as an admonishing outsider and makes something rivetingly relevant and personal out of it. The audience might still be recovering; the year is young, but no one who saw Pierce tear down the Troubadour is likely to experience anything more memorable in 2026.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tJust about everyone else on the bill had to kind of settle for second-to-Pierce status when it came to sheer visceral impact, but that was still an exalted enough place to be.\n\n\tIf it ever comes down to a contest of who’s truly the MVPs at any AmericanaFest gathering, that would perennially come down to the men of the Milk Carton Kids and the women of I’m With Her. So it was a little like an Avengers meetup when that duo and trio joined forces near the end of the evening as a vocal quintet for an intricately arranged version of “Harvest Moon.” Earlier in the show, the Milk Carton Kids had done “Heart of Gold” on their own in their very quietest mode, going all sotto voce in their Everlys-go-to-Redwood take on one of Young’s most famously plaintive hits. I’m With Her did much the same with “Only Love Can Break Your Heart,” which was soothing enough to sound like a candidate for a sequel to group member Sara Watkins’ lullaby album, should she ever make another.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe country side of Young got some showcasing right from the start, with the house band kicking off the show with the promissory “Are You Ready for the Country.” Margo Price revived “Love Is a Rose” with just a little more twang than Linda did, in an old-school country suit festooned in flowers. Keith Secor was more than ready for it with a fiddle-soloing version of “Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere”; the Old Crow frontman also sat in on Molly Tuttle’s “Helpless,” although he left the fireworks to his better half as she rounded out that coming-of-age anthem with a characteristically great acoustic guitar-solo coda. Tuttle was not the be-all and end-all of female pickers on the roster, as her fellow Grammy nominee Sierra Hull added a beautiful mandolin wind to “Look Out for My Love.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMargo Price performs at the Americana Fest Pre-Grammy Salute to the Songs of Neil Young at the Troubadour on January 31, 2026. (Erika Goldring Photo)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tErika Goldring\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe pop side of Neil Young? That might sound like an oxymoron, but not when Molly Jensen is singing a straight-up cover of Nicolette Larson’s not-so-straight-up, adult contemporary cover of Young’s “Lotta Love,” which became a top 10 hit in 1978 — complete with a house band member providing both the flute and sax interludes.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tNo one would have mistaken the concert for a Crazy Horse gig, but rocking out did take place, starting in earnest with a Katie Pruitt-led rendering of the sadly relevant “Ohio,” followed some time later by Maggie Rose wailing terrifically and in earnest through a high-dynamics, no-hurry version of “Down by the River.” Those numbers thrive on unleavened tension, but Grace Potter was all smiles and all bounding around while delivering “Cinnamon Girl” with one of the night’s guitar heroes, Leif. He had earlier taken a turn in the spotlight, firing off some instrumental gunplay while singing his own version of the beautifully fatalistic “Powderfinger.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIf it feels sacrilegious to the music’s humble ethos to say the Americana movement has “stars,” it’s inarguable that Jesse Welles has become one in this modest corner of the culture. So there were few appearances as highly anticipated as his taking to the stage for “After the Gold Rush,” offering a raspier take on the choirboy delivery Young gave to his eco-protest sci-fi anthem 55 years ago. Young the Giant — no relation to Neil Young the giant — took on “Old Man,” with Sameer Gadhia sweetly up to the very ungrizzled task of playing the role of an actual young person. \n\n\tWhatever else the org does, the Americana Music Association can be counted on to provide two of the year’s best Various Artists concerts — one being its performance-heavy annual awards show at the Ryman in Nashville each September, and then this much more intimate gig at the Troubadour in January, which is a tighter, less-talk-more-rock affair. The latter, with its “twas the night before Crypto” timing, inevitably raises talk about how the artists and genres represented here have real singers playing real instruments, yada yada, in comparison to some of their more choreographed brothers and sisters in prime time. There might be some undue moral superiority in some of that, but you don’t even have to hate Addison Rae or Katseye to revel in the emotion and virtuosity on a night like this one and conclude: This, truly, is the shit. Long may it run… to paraphrase a song that, with any luck, will be performed at the AmericanaFest Salute to the Songs of Neil Young Part II next year.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJesse Welles, Leif, Grace Potter and Maggie Rose perform in the finale at the Americana Fest Pre-Grammy Salute to the Songs of Neil Young at the Troubadour on Jan. 31, 2026.

    "body": "\n\tChris Hemsworth told The Guardian in a new interview on his “Crime 101” press tour that he had some reservations about going public with the news that he has a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer’s disease, which makes him eight to 10 times more likely to develop the disease. The actor was concerned how such news would impact public perception of his movie career.\n\n\t“I wondered if I was letting people too far in,” Hemsworth said. “Are they no longer going to believe in the action star or the Marvel character? And do I want people to know my fears and insecurities to this level?”\n\t\n\n\tHemsworth made the reveal in 2022 on an episode of his Disney+ series “Limitless,” which featured the Thor actor meeting with a doctor who informed him that his genetic makeup includes two copies of the gene APOE4, which studies have linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Hemsworth’s grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. The actor revealed last November that his father is currently battling the disease.\n\n\tSpeaking to The Guardian, Hemsowrth said that his father’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis is part of what is prompting a career slowdown at the moment.\n\n\t“My appetite for racing forward has really been reined in,” he said. “I’ve become more aware of the fragility of things. You start thinking, ‘My dad won’t be here for ever.’ And my kids are now 11 and 13. Those nights where they’d fight over sleeping in our bed – suddenly they’re not happening any more.”\n\n\tHis father’s diagnosis has also been impacting his acting choices. He’s taking roles that feel more personal, whereas in the past Hemsworth was making more financial decisions. “I’d think, ‘I came from nothing. Who am I to turn down that kind of money?’” he said. “Justifying things that weren’t the purest creative decision – but I’ll be able to pay for my parents’ house, or I’ll be able to help out my cousins.”\n\t\n\n\tHemsworth’s 2025 documentary “A Road Trip to Remember” centered on his father’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis. The actor said the project “was so deeply personal. It was a love letter to my father. It empowered him for a period, and stimulated memories that were being taken away from him.” \n\n\tWhen Hemsworth revealed his genetic predisposition for Alzheimer’s in 2022, he noted that “it’s not like I’ve been handed my resignation” and “it’s not a pre-deterministic gene, but it is a strong indication. Ten years ago, I think it was more thought of as determinant.”\n\n\tSpeaking to Vanity Fair in 2024, Hemsworth called out the press for spinning his reveal into headlines that claimed it was certain he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in the future.\n\n\t“It really kind of pissed me off because it felt like I had been vulnerable with something personal and shared this,” he said at the time. “No matter how much I said ‘This is not a death sentence,’ the story became that I have dementia and I’m reconsidering life and retiring and so on.”\n\n\tHemsworth’s “Crime 101” opens in theaters Feb. 13 from Amazon MGM. He will be back on the big screen as Thor in “Avengers: Doomsday,” in theaters Dec. 18. \n",

The man noted there was no break-in attempt and nothing was stolen from his yard.\n      \n\n          As everyone knows, Nancy's family reported her missing Sunday after they received word she didn't show up at her regular church service.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    NewsNation\n          \n    \n          Police say she was kidnapped from her home between Saturday night and Sunday morning.

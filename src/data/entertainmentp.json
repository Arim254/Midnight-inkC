    "body": "\n\tThe Warner Bros. Discovery board is leaning toward re-engaging with Paramount Skydance on the revised terms of Paramount’s offer to acquire the entire company, which inked an $83 billion sale agreement with Netflix in December.\n\n\tBut Paramount Skydance’s latest offer — No. 9 since last year — offers a premium to WBD shareholders of about $650 million per quarter for every quarter that the Netflix-WBD nuptials are not completed by Dec. 31, 2026. Paramount Skydance released its latest pitch to WBD and to investors on Feb. 10. Word of the WBD’s board’s inclinations was first reported Sunday by Bloomberg News.\n\t\n\n\tThe WBD board has been quick to issue a statement rejecting Paramount’s most recent overtures, calling them insufficient enough to derail the existing agreement with Netflix. But the sale process around the famed studio and HBO has drawn intense scrutiny from investors, media observers and corporate governance watchdogs. The WBD sale is virtually guaranteed to spark shareholder lawsuits, as is the case for most major transactions. If the WBD board goes back one more time with Paramount Skydance, it bolsters the case that the panel did their fiduciary duty to investigate all legitimate offers.\n\n\n\tWBD is expected to address the Paramount Skydance offer and set the date for its Q4 2025 earnings report early this week after Monday’s Presidents’ Day holiday. Investors are also awaiting the date of WBD’s planned special shareholders’ vote to approve the Netflix transaction. It’s unclear if Paramount’s revised offer will change WBD’s vote timetable. Netflix, as per the agreement that it reached in December, has the right to match any superior offer that comes in before it formally completes the acquisition.\n\t\n\n\tRepresentatives for Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Skydance and Netflix declined to comment.\n\n\tA source close to the situation said the WBD board is likely focused on pushing Paramount Skydance to declare that it has reached the best and final offer stage. That would allow shareholders to make a considered choice, and it would allow WBD to push Netflix to match Paramount Skydance terms if they are deemed better than the existing agreement. The situation is complicated by the fact that Netflix’s offer is for Warner Bros. and HBO Max. Paramount Skydance aims to buy the entire WBD, including its large collection of cable channels, from CNN and TNT to Discovery, HGTV and Food Network.\n\n\tThe WBD-Netflix transaction is expected to face a tough regulatory review in Washington, D.C. process given Netflix’s market clout in streaming and the heightened political tension around media in the Trump era. WBD may also face more PR headaches from small but noisy investors who are questioning the Netflix agreement, as was the case with Ancora Capital last week.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSavannah Guthrie took to Instagram on Sunday afternoon to share another message with her mother’s kidnapper. She calmly told the perpetrator that it’s “never too late to do the right thing.”\n\n\t“It’s been two weeks since our mom was taken, and I just wanted to come on and say that we still have hope and we still believe,” she said. “And I wanted to say to whoever has her or knows where she is, that it’s never too late, and you’re not lost or alone, and it is never too late to do the right thing.”\n\t\n\n\n\tNancy Guthrie went missing on Feb. 1, and the following day, the Pima County Sheriff’s department declared her disappearance a crime after finding “concerning” evidence at her Arizona residence. On Friday night, authorities said that investigators were searching Nancy Guthrie’s home and the surrounding area for clues. \n\n\n\tOn Thursday, the FBI announced it raised the reward to $100,000 for anyone with information leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie. The agency also released identifying details about the suspect caught on camera trying to break into Nancy Guthrie’s home. The possible kidnapper was described as “a male, approximately 5’9” – 5’10” tall, with an average build. In the video, he is wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack’ backpack.”\n\n\tThe Pima County Sheriff’s Department on Tuesday detained a person for questioning in connection with the case. Authorities told ABC News that they were preparing to search a location in connection with the detainee. However, the individual was later released. \n\t\n\n\tSavannah Guthrie has posted several videos on Instagram in hopes of rallying help for her mother. On Feb. 9, she posted a video pleading with her supporters to aid in the search. \n\n\t“We believe our mom is still out there,” Savannah Guthrie said in the video. “We need your help. Law enforcement is working tirelessly around the clock trying to bring her home — trying to find her. She was taken and we don’t know where. And we need your help.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Sinners” star Wunmi Mosaku recently told The Sunday Times that she hasn’t been able to enjoy her recent Oscar nomination for best supporting actress because of the deaths of Alex Pretti and Renée Good, two American citizens who were shot and killed by federal agents in Minnesota.\n\n\t“I’ve not been able to celebrate because of what’s going on right now, with the killings of Renée Good and Alex Pretti by ICE agents in Minnesota and the kidnapping of a five-year-old boy,” Mosaku said. “It’s difficult to hold both the nomination and the news because one feels beautiful and one is so dark and heavy; truly dystopian — how can I possibly go out and buy some drinks and enjoy the moment?”\n\t\n\n\tShe added, “[My husband] is not as shocked as I am at the news. There’s a very strange American psyche where terrible things happen and people still can go to work the next day, whereas I’m floored for a week and think, ‘How are people going to crowded places when this has just happened?’ I want a cocoon. My reaction reminds him that this is not normal.”\n\n\n\tMosaku isn’t the only one in Hollywood speaking out against ICE and Donald Trump‘s immigration crackdown. On Feb. 5, Jamie Lee Curtis told Variety that “the ICE situation is out of control.” She slammed the actions of federal agents in Minnesota and beyond as an “abhorrence.”\n\n\t“Every day I think I’m not going to be shocked anymore and then I’m shocked,” Curtis said. “It’s just inhuman. It is inhuman the way this administration is treating its citizens and its constituents and people in need. It’s an abhorrence what they’re doing. The ICE situation is out of control. It’s simply a distraction so that we don’t pay attention to the Epstein files.”\n\t\n\n\tWhoopi Goldberg got visibly emotional in a Jan. 26 episode of “The View,” during which she called out Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and border patrol commander Gregory Bovino over the death of Pretti.\n\n\t“Kristi Noem, you can’t justify this. Mr. Bovino, you can’t justify this,” she said. “You can’t justify either one, and we all see it and we see you for what you are. You all have blood on your hands.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn the week after the Super Bowl, Bad Bunny had a super week as far as consumption of his recorded music. On the new Billboard 200 album chart, he has two albums in the top 10 for the first time, as his recent hit “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS” is joined in those ranks by a four-year-old release that’s back on the rise, “Un Verano Sin Ti.” And the newer album enjoyed its best sales week to date.\n\n\tBut the chart action was at least that super for J. Cole, as well. Even with “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS” doing as smashingly as it did, it was held at No. 2 because J. Cole’s “The Fall-Off” did even better, debuting at No. 1 with the best weekly number for any R&B or hip-hop album in 11 months.\n\t\n\n\t“The Fall-Off” landed on top with 280,000 equivalent album units. According to Billboard and Luminate, the last time any album in an associated genre did that well was last March, when Playboi Carti’s “Music” opened just a little bit higher, with 289,000 units.\n\n\n\tAt No. 2, “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS” scored with 250,000 units, Bad Bunny’s best mark ever. He may have been held to the same runner-up chat position he had the previous week, but the album was actually up by 194%.\n\n\tBad Bunny’s other top 10 album is 2022’s “Un Verano Sin Ti,” which moved up 10 spots from No. 16 to No. 6 this week. Its unit figure of 81,000 represented a 163% jump from the previous week.\n\n\tIn most other recent weeks, Ateez would have easily had a No. 1 album with the 200,000 equivalent album units the K-pop group earned with “Golden Hour: Part 4.” But in this particular week, with J. Cole and Bad Bunny registering so strongly, Ateez had to settle for a No. 3 chart bow. As Billboard noted, sales were pumped by the availability of 25 physical variants in the marketplace, which is about on par for hit K-pop acts.\n\t\n\n\tThe album that debuted at No. 1 last week, Don Toliver’s “Octane,” got bumped three spots to No. 4, with its numbers down by 40% to 97,000 units — still a very good hold, as second weeks go.\n\n\tThe top 10 of the Billboard 200 is rounded out by Morgan Wallen’s “I’m the Problem” at No. 7, Olivia Dean’s “The Art of Loving” at No. 8 (even though she fell four spots, her still-rising numbers were up another 7%), Taylor Swift’s “The Life of a Showgirl” at No. 9 and “KPop Demon Hunters” at No. 10.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Pulp Fiction” co-writer Roger Avary recently told the “Joe Rogan Experience” that it was “impossible” for him to get his movies made through “traditional” means. But after launching his AI production banner General Cinema Dynamics, he now has three features in production.\n\n\t“I go out there and try to get stuff made, and it’s almost impossible,” Avary said. “And then I built a technology company over the last year, basically making AI movies, and all of a sudden, boom, like that, money gets thrown at it. All of a sudden, just by attaching the word ‘AI’ and [the fact] that it’s a technology-based company, all of a sudden, investors came in, and we’re in production on three films now.”\n\t\n\n\t“It was so easy for me to get that going and so difficult for me to get a traditional movie going through the traditional route,” he added. “Just put AI in front of it and all of a sudden you’re in production on three features.”\n\n\n\tAvary’s three AI films are “a family Christmas movie that’ll be in theaters this holiday season,” a “faith-based movie for next Easter” and a “big romantic war epic.”\n\n\tWhile filmmakers like Avary are taking advantage of the AI boom, many in Hollywood fear the technology will bring seismic, irreversible changes to the industry. These fears were further realized on Tuesday when a user plugged a two-line prompt into AI video generator Seedance 2.0 and created a polished, hyper-realistic clip for Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt. After the video went viral, the Motion Picture Association released a statement denouncing Seedance 2.0, and its parent company ByteDance, for engaging in “unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale.”\n\t\n\n\t“By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs. ByteDance should immediately cease its infringing activity,” read the statement.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen David Kaplan, the New York-based producer of Beth de Araújo’s Sundance prizewinning “Josephine,” arrived at the fireside chat hosted by European Film Market on Sunday afternoon, he sounded like he’d been working across different time zones, which, by all accounts, he has. \n\n\tThe U.S. deal for “Josephine” to Sumerian Pictures closed late last night in Berlin, which made the timing for the on-stage discussion moderated by Variety quite fitting. \n\t\n\n\tAfter securing a double prize win at Sundance, the movie was finally sold by WME Independent and CAA Media Finance to upstart U.S. distributor Sumerian in a ‘mid-to-high seven figures,” said Kaplan on stage in Berlin, where the film will play in competition. For a film that most of the market initially resisted, it’s a lucrative pact that Kaplan hopes will pay off in the long run, and will also allow investors to get their money back on the film which was budgeted at $6 million and only completed its financing six days into the shoot. \n\n\n\t“We had a few offers, varying levels of financing, varying levels of theatrical commitment. Obviously, that plays some role in all of this,” he said candidly. \n\n\t“It was very important to Beth always that our investors made their money back if they could. They took tremendous risk. It’s important to me as a producer in the same way. Why would anyone want to work with you again if you don’t take care of them in that way, particularly in success?”\n\n\tSumerian also offered “a very meaningful screen commitment, a very meaningful P&A commitment,”  continued Kaplan, whose company Kaplan Morrison, which he founded with Andrew Morrison three years ago, has so far produced Brady Corbet’s “The Brutalist” and Mona Fastvold’s “The Testament of Ann Lee.” \n\t\n\n\tKaplan said Sumerian splurged on “Josephine” and “told (them) this is going to be the flagship.” “I think we just saw that in them, there was a partner who maybe had as much skin in the game as we did and could. You want that.”\n\n\tThe producer, who hinted that he also took some personal risk to make “Josephine” and didn’t take an upfront fee (and possibly no backend either), can relate to that level of dedication. \n\n\t“Like everybody else on the film, everybody sacrificed for this film,” Kaplan said. “That’s how you make a film with movie stars and a great director and great crew in an expensive city for that amount. It takes a village of people who believe.”\n\n\t“Josephine” was 12 years in the making and Kaplan came on board in the last three. He had known de Araújo for years and was working with her on another project. But “Josephine” suddenly took priority after de Araújo met Channing Tatum, Kaplan recalled. \n\n\t“She called me up and said, ‘Well, I know we’re supposed to be making this other film, and I’m still very excited about that, but I now have two actors for this other script (Gemma Chan had already been attached for years). Would you ever be interested in perhaps doing that first?’” Kaplan said. \n\n\t“To which I said, ‘Gemma Chan, Channing Tatum, this beautiful script of yours that I read years ago that I know you’ve always wanted to make, the movie that you’ve always wanted to make. Yeah, we should probably do that.'” \n\n\tKaplan joked about the number of producers who tried to mount it. Among the bunch is no other than John Baker (“Luce,” “Wild Canaries”). “Someday we have to have a dinner for all the producers of ‘Josephine,’ because collectively, we all made this movie. It just took a very long time.”\n\n\t“Josephine” is definitely not an easy sale at a time when the market is mostly interested in feel good movies, comedies, romances or genre. Inspired by events de Araújo witnessed as a child, the film tells the story of an 8-year-old who sees a rape in Golden Gate Park. Tatum and Chan play Josephine’s parents, who must navigate the little girl’s trauma amid the quest for justice for the survivor.\n\n\tDespite de Araújo’s debut “Soft & Quiet” which was critically acclaimed at South by Southwest upon premiering in 2022, “Josephine” was nearly impossible to finance given its topic.\n\t\n\n\t“99% of the people we went to and said, ‘Would you like to make this film?’ said, ‘Absolutely not,’” Kaplan recalls. \n\n\t“Resistance, concern, skepticism about the commerciality, worry from parents about what this film is and worrying that it’s too dark,” Kaplan said of the difficulties to finance the movie. “I think there was a lot of concern that who is this movie for? How is this movie going to be? Is it commercial?”\n\n\tHe also pointed to an “inherent bias against films that are perhaps more geared towards women and assault survivors.”\n\n\tTatum and Chan, who served as producers on the film, also played a decisive role in getting the project off the ground. “Gemma’s involvement in this film dates back many years now. She stood by it,” he said. Tatum, meanwhile, went as far as pitching investors. “He was a part of the team, raising the money and trying to make the movie. You just don’t see that very often,” he said. \n\n\tMason Lily Reeves, who plays the title role in the film, was discovered just seven weeks before production when de Araújo saw her at a farmers’ market in San Francisco. \n\n\t“Beth… saw her in a crowd at a market seven weeks before we started shooting,” Kaplan said. De Araújo approached Reeves’ mother directly. The team had seen roughly 90 children, including an experienced young actor, but de Araújo was resolute. “Immediately, from the first time Beth started working with Mason in the casting process, she was like, ‘This is the girl.’”\n\n\tSince Reeves was only seven when she was cast, it got more complicated for the production. “In America, there are labor laws,” Kaplan noted. “Casting someone younger meant that our schedule had to be longer and we had to spend more money on this film for days just to cast Mason.” \n\n\tUltimately, the film was financed by three equity partners: Spark Features; Kinematics (“The Apprentice”); and Yintai Entertainment (“The Testament of Ann Lee”), which came aboard during production. The close came perilously late. “We closed the financing… six days into principal photography. Not knowing if it would fall apart, even two days before we started production.”\n\n\t“The film shot in San Francisco, a decision de Araújo insisted on. “The texture of the city animates the movie. We could not fake San Francisco and didn’t want to.”\n\t\n\n\tKaplan’s banner now is developing about six projects, including Brady Corbet’s and Mona Fastvold’s next projects, as well as the highly anticipated sequel to “It Follows,” David Robert Mitchell’s cult 2014 genre film, which Neon has boarded. \n\n\t“We have partners in both U.S. and internationally to release the film,” he said, adding that the sequel will “hopefully start shooting in the months to come.”\n\n\tKaplan is also in post with another ambitious project, “Triumph of the Will,” which is directed by Gabriel Nussbaum with a cast led by Shira Haas (“Unorthodox”). The film is a sprawling period movie set during WWII and stars Haas as a woman who leaves her husband in Amsterdam in 1937 to start a new life with her daughter in Berlin, where she takes up with a firebrand rabbi on a mission to help Jews get out of the country. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIn Anke Blondé’s latest feature, two friends — middle-aged men in expensive suits — walk in step through offices and banquet halls for much of the first act. You might expect their strides to be scored by a power ballad or an upbeat hip-hop track, but “Dust” is a film of financial fraud brought to light, so it’s scored by morose and heavy strings, and the two men in question are set to be arrested in mere hours. There’s an absurdity and abstraction to the whole affair that affords us a peek into the minds and egos of those who run the modern world, not to mention some tongue-in-cheek disdain nestled within surprising sympathy. However, these flourishes don’t last, and the movie ends up petering out without all that much to say.\n\t\n\n\tIt begins with some dusty substance floating up through the frame, out of focus. It could be snow, or ash, or maybe even flakes of gold. It’s a fitting introduction to a film of innumerable possibilities, one that quickly switches gears to a blank computer screen, and narration about filling in one’s own story. The year is 1999. Handsome Belgian executive Geert (Arieh Worthalter) regales an enthusiastic crowd with a yarn, while his mousy tech head Luc (Jan Hammenecker) demonstrates to what might be the world’s first speech-to-text technology. It may seem rudimentary now, but it was a major breakthrough at the time, not unlike the way today’s tech companies are pushing numerous forms of A.I.\n\n\n\tWithout wasting time, the film begins dropping hints that something is amiss, as it cuts back and forth between Geert and Luc being summoned by angry board members over the weekend, and them being accosted by cocky journalist Aaron (Anthony Welsh) in a public bathroom, as they dance around the subject of his inquiry. Before they know it, their fate is sealed: Come 9 a.m. Monday morning, they’ll take the fall setting up empty shell companies, and be arrested for defrauding thousands of public investors. But where an exposé might climax with this revelation, here it’s the catalyst for the characters’ strange and introspective final 24 hours of freedom, rendered at first with intriguing flourishes.\n\t\n\n\tWritten by Angelo Tijssens, the story is loosely based on Belgian tech firm Lernout & Hauspie, but it has little in common with real events, and often plays like a fable half-remembered. Its gloomy, gas-lit palette and breathy musical hums imbue it with a ghostly quality, as though the Harvard hallways of “The Social Network,” David Fincher’s similarly amber tale of tech caution, were transformed into a haunted house. This eerie sensation is further enhanced by elliptical editing that seamlessly skips back and forth in time across the span of just a few days, creating a sense of fluidity across what should feel discontinuous. It’s enrapturing, and quite hilarious too, as the po-faced, bespectacled Luc — his thinning hair pointed upward like devil horns — pukes and pratfalls, and even does both at the same time.\n\n\tThe two men are separated for much of the runtime, but circle each other as they’re forced to consider absconding or blowing the whistle. However, the hours prior to their arraignment — marked by wall clocks in the background of most scenes — are also filled with moments of remorse, as they catch up with acquaintances and loved ones who will no doubt be affected by what’s to come. Luc consults his wife about how to proceed, while Geert hopes to spend his final few hours of freedom with his driver/boytoy Kenneth (Thibaud Dooms); he is, after all, a man of secrets, while Luc is likely more inclined to spill the beans.\n\n\tThis simmering tension over what they’ll choose to do, as they wander the rural landscape, is the film’s narrative core, and feels momentous during its many cross-cut scenes. However, as the story goes on, the editing becomes more functional and mechanical than poetic, as Blondé presents her scenes in an increasingly protracted, straightforward fashion that, unfortunately, gives the game away. Despite its many scenes of men panicking or silently reflecting on regret, there’s very little substance to “Dust” once you strip away its style; its characters, although vessels for a tale of broken camaraderie, seldom feel tethered to their immediate circumstances.\n\n\tThe film is incredibly, even magnificently, stylish, but beyond its initial presentation, there just isn’t very much guiding the story in any novel or exciting ways — beyond, perhaps, thematic echoes of how the less prim-and-proper tech bros of today might be pulling a fast one too. Both lead performers command the camera’s attention — the long, dimly-lit scenes of the second half would immediately die in the hands of lesser actors — but there are only so many dimensions each man can conjure when the story seldom appears headed toward anything meaningful. It culminates with neither catharsis nor irony, but instead treads a noncommittal middle ground of gonzo sentimentality that, fittingly, might make you look back on the film and wish things had turned out differently.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s early in 2026, but August Ponthier‘s full-length debut album, “Everywhere Isn’t Texas,” should still be remembered 11 or 12 months from now as one of the year’s best fresh starts. There are a number of ways in which the slightly country-tinged pop album does or doesn’t count as a beginning for Ponthier. It’s a coming-of-age record, but, at 29, Ponthier points out that it’s a queer coming-of-age record, reflecting the kind of experience that may come later for those who take some turns before fully finding themselves, as they did. \n\t\n\n\tThe “they” pronoun, incidentally, is one of several things that are new for Ponthier, who prior to this released three EPs with a “she” identity and distinctly feminine first name. Only during the mastering part of finishing the album did Ponthier decide to make the leap into coming out as non-binary, partly because of being too proud of the record to release it under a now-dead name that would have compromised the joy of putting out something so satisfyingly self-revelatory. Ponthier already had a lot of notoriety with the previous name — including a Q&A last year in Variety about a then-new single, “Karaoke Queen,” which reflected their experience of being dropped by Interscope in 2024 after three years. But nothing cements going indie like the independence that comes with dropping some baggage of one’s own, as they did in October with the announcement of these personal changes, to the surprise but not chagrin of fans who already knew Ponthier as a maverick spirit as well as gifted singer-songwriter.\n\n\n\tPreviously, some had referred to Ponthier as being like “a lesbian Sabrina Carpenter.” Do easy tags like that become any more complicated now that they are out as non-binary? It’s possible, but the songs — deeply personal, whether or not they were co-written with craftspeople like Amy Allen and Dan Wilson — should have the boundary-crossing appeal to connect with mainstream pop fans of all stripes. (Or fans of Texas music… Ponthier’s still at least a little bit country, they insist.) Variety caught up with Ponthier again recently, first at friend Brandi Carlile‘s Girls Just Wanna Weekend festival, then by phone from their native Texas, to discuss “Everywhere Isn’t Texas,” an album it’s easy to imagine impacting \n\t\n\n\tWhether in the flesh or on video, people have seen you duet with Brandi Carlile a lot. She has been a real champion of yours, and she sang duets with you when she had you open for her at Red Rocks, and last year and this year at her Girls Just Wanna Weekend festival. So it’s not unusual at this point for you to be on stage with Brandi.\n\n\tIt is unusual! It’s unusual in how I think back to a year that I was really going through a lot of difficult feelings about who I am or what I can do and what’s limiting or not limiting. And every time I would shower, I would sing “The Joke,” because it is a song that hits me the hardest when it comes to wanting to encourage myself. I had never met her before, so after a year of singing that song all the time, when she reached out to me after I got dropped by my major label, I remember my partner was like, “You manifested it by singing the song every day for like a year.” So when I’m up there singing with her, I think about that time. I also think about how when I sing with her, I feel present in a way that I’m not really used to. It is an adrenaline rush to be on stage, but for some reason when I sing with her, I feel completely calm and in my body, and she has that effect on me because I know that she really accepts me. Even though now I know her on more of a personal level, she is a hero, to not just me, but so many people in our community and in in the world. It’s surreal, and it will never get old. I could sing with her a hundred times and I doubt it would ever feel any less crazy.\n\n\tShe learned about you through Elton John, who was already championing you, right?\n\n\tYeah, I was playing a show at the Rooftop at P17 (in New York) opening up for the Japanese House, and I had found out the night before that I was getting dropped, which was devastating and my worst fear. I was lying on the floor of the green room being like, “I have no idea how I’m going to do this show.” And I checked my messages and she had messaged me just saying, “Hey, Elton showed me your music. It’s special and I hope to meet you in the future.” And even though she had no idea anything about my life or anything about me being dropped at all, it was exactly what I needed to hear in that moment. And ever since then, like when I play Red Rocks, I feel the spirit of a community behind me. It’s a huge honor to be recognized by people who not only make me want to be an artist, but made me wanna keep going and wanna keep being alive and wanna keep feeling like there was hope when it felt like there was almost nothing else.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAugust Ponthier ‘Everywhere Isn’t Texas’ cover art\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe song she keeps singing with you most often is “Everywhere Isn’t Texas,” which happens to be the title track of the new album that’s coming out. That one in particular really struck a chord with Brandi, as it does with many people who hear it.\n\n\tLast year when I was at Girls Just Wanna for the very first time, I had no idea she was going to come watch my set, but I really wanted her to hear that one, so I was over the moon that she just happened to watch the part of my set that “Everywhere Isn’t Texas” was in. And she gave me a standing ovation, which made me want to scream, cry and throw up, all combined. But I think the reason that that song connected with her is because she is an artist that makes protest music; her whole last record is protest music. And I also have that thing where if something resonates with me, I need to talk about it through the actual thing that I make.\n\n\tThat song is about how I grew up in Texas and I felt like I loved it, but it did not love me back. I felt like I was being pushed out, kind of like the way white blood cells will push out an infection, and I didn’t want to feel like I was diseased or wrong or made wrong. And because I can’t stop thinking about home and all the things that happen there, because Texas is a leader in politics, it became the title of the album. It is the most complicated and deep love of my life. And the fact that it resonated with Brandi, and she’s not someone that’s afraid to talk about politics or to stand up for what she believes in, it means a lot that a major artist would be so brave and talk about a state that is really polarizing and sing alongside me.\n\n\tI was opening up for Maren Morris a year and some change ago. We both went to the same college, at different times, but we’re both from a similar area in Texas. And when when I performed the song on her tour for the first time, she was like, “It takes a lot of guts to sing a song about a state that people love to love and love to hate at the same time.” I weirdly had never even considered that, because I always have just spoken my mind, but it’s not lost on me how grateful I should be and how important it is that other people from Texas or artists that are involved in country music, specifically, can appreciate the song and can discuss things we love in a nuanced way. We can love something and be critical of it at the same time and want better for it. And we are in an era where I think protest music is important, and I hope that a lot more artists would follow suit and make music that doesn’t just allude to the things that they care about, but does specifically talk about the things that keep them up at night and the people that they love.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tLet’s talk about your journey and how it did or didn’t coincide with the making of this album. You had previously been very out as lesbian, but in October, you came out as non-binary, with a new first name and identity. How much did that overlap with the final stages of your album?\n\n\tThe music was fully done. The last step was just mastering a few of the songs. So it was all written before I had even really told myself confidently who I was. I mean, this journey started when I was really young, but me being conscious and awake and aware of it, to the point where I was ready to say it out loud or to want to change my name, was this past year. It’s something that, in my mind, I thought I could repress forever, and then all of a sudden I couldn’t do it anymore. It was making me miserable and making me feel so disconnected from myself. I felt like I was aging rapidly in a body and identity that I didn’t understand. And then I just said the truth out loud, and now I feel like there’s a million doors that could open. I feel, like, 20 years younger. Weirdly, I just feel a totally different sense of hope that I didn’t have before. And this album is a series of songs that kind of feel like clues, in order to figure out maybe what was gonna happen with me coming out as non-binary. But also, I’m so proud of these songsthat I couldn’t stand not putting the name that I know now as mine on it. I didn’t want to wake up a year or five years from now and regret not saying that August made that album. So, thankfully, the album was actually a good pressure cooker for being like, “I need to do what is right.” And I’m so glad because now that I’m August, every day is better. Colors are brighter. I am excited when people say my name. I want to introduce myself to people. And that’s just not how I felt before.\n\n\tYou had experienced a lot of acceptance as a very out lesbian singer, but did it feel bolder to go what may be an extra step for people?\n\n\tI’d come out as a lesbian and I was like, “OK, amazing. I am a pro at this!” But no, it’s totally different. I think gender is something that’s so deeply personal for people and it just hits a completely different nerve … So I would say across the board, for queer people and straight people, the reactions have been varied. Gender is a very personal place that hits people in a different part of their heart. And I’m very lucky that I have an amazing support system. I think if I did this like any sooner, I wouldn’t have been ready for it, which is why it happened when it happened. I think a lot of people don’t fully understand how to talk to me, or people have never heard of a non-binary person before, or people think non-binary people have to be super masculine, or there are signs or qualifications. And I’m happy to share my thoughts when I feel comfortable, like I’m doing right now. But no, it’s been difficult — but 100% worth it. If someone chooses not to see me for who I am, that’s a completely different feeling than if I’m fully repressing myself, because now I can say “Well, you just don’t know me well” or “There’s something wrong with how you treat people,” instead of me saying that there’s something deeply made wrong within me, which I don’t believe anymore.\n\t\n\n\tSome people might have been surprised just because they assume that non-binary equates with butch or something, and that has not been your imagery at all.\n\n\tThere’s like lots of different people who have different genders who realize that non-binary is the right and most true gender for them. I never wanted to feel like I was compensating for being feminine, because there are things about femininity that I appreciate. In the same way, there’s things about masculinity that I really appreciate. There’s no one type of non-binary person. And really, even when people ask me like, “Oh, so you’re, like, outside of gender — you don’t like gender” or something, I’m like, “No, non-binary is my own thing. It’s my own gender that is mine. I love who I am and just because it’s not replicated somewhere else doesn’t mean that it’s not real and what I feel is absolutely me.” I will say there was a period, especially last year at Girls Just Wanna, where I was growing my hair out the longest I could ever grow it out, because I thought I would like it and could get used to it. I was wearing a lot of dresses. … Do I want to cut all my hair off now? No, because the shag is what feels good about me. It’s really about doing what feels right and letting myself be my own North Star, which is a permission that a lot of people are not good at giving themselves. So it has been a personal growth journey in every single area of my life. There’s not one thing it hasn’t touched, because it really just is about believing yourself. It’s very weirdly spiritual in a way that I haven’t exercised in a long time.\n\n\tI did just take new press images because I did want it to reflect how I feel. I still feel like there’s no one look for non-binary people. But I’m happy that I get to put my best foot forward, which just happens to be in a shoe attached to a suit.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAugust Ponthier\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTanner Abel\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHow does it work when you have like a bunch of releases out there under your old name? Are you trying to get those credits changed? And do you object to people using your dead name to refer to your old work?\n\n\tIf people have my records or T-shirts or things like that, I’m OK with them wearing it around. I’m OK with people having things that have my old name on them, because those are things I’m proud of making. But I don’t like it when people use my old name in conversation. It’s just so important to me that people respect the boundary of like, this is my first name, when they’re talking to me or about me. And then also my pronouns are big for me. So I really appreciate when people make the effort to do that because it’s so early for me that it just shows that they really do see me and understand and care no matter what I look like or no matter if they knew me before. I love my name. My dead name — my old name, I call it “redacted” — I’m glad that she carried me up until this point, but it’s kind of only for my memories and my family’s memories, not something that I really wanna carry with me.\n\t\n\n\tI’m so glad that I got to change my name on pretty much everything. The biggest one for me was the Lord Huron song that I’m on (“I Lied”). I didn’t know if it was possible to change my name. And so when I called Ben (Schneider) and I was like, “Hi, I’m changing my name, I’m coming out — what do we think? Is it gonna be really annoying to change this?,” he was so supportive and immediately was like, “I’m on it. I’ll talk to Spotify, Apple Music, everyone, immediately,” and he has been a huge support to me. So that was a dream come true, to know that we could change that. It’s interesting to be a public figure already by the time that I wanted to make those changes. I looked it up, and not a lot of people have made the first-name change mid-career. It was a lot of “Let’s see what we can even do and what’s even possible.” There’s still some platforms and some things that the name hasn’t switched over yet, but honestly, the price of just having people call me by the new name is 100% worth it. But it was kind of uncharted territory.\n\n\tThere’s just so many links to my past already that I don’t want to say that it never happened, because that was my name for a long time. But I think just for public consciousness, it’s important to me that people don’t view me as August-with-an-asterisk. I would say to anybody who’s thinking about it, it is worth it. At the end of the day, people change their names all the time, whether it’s a stage name or a new group or for whatever reason. And there is nothing better than not only being called August, but feeling like August. That not only comes with time, but people saying it a lot and really seeing me.  I used to think, “Oh, well, if 90% of the time people are referring to me incorrectly or don’t understand my whole deal, it’ll never be worth it for that 10%,” but I was completely wrong. The 10% of being affirmed or the 10% people completely getting it up, it is 100% worth it, because it accesses a part of my brain and accesses a part of my joy that I have genuinely never felt before. It’s overwhelming, and it’s just a sense of brightness that I never got to experience socially with anybody.\n\n\n\n\n\tDo you feel like this album is primarily for the queer community? A lot of the songs are more universal. And probably the dirty secret of most people who are hardcore music fans is that they feel like outsiders, which would make some of these songs speak to them, even if they’re not outsiders in the same way you have been.\n\t\n\n\tAbsolutely. Obviously, the queer community is like my heartbeat, but I think a lot of people can relate. I feel like people who are like just simply neurodivergent or feel like they’re wired differently can relate. People who just grew up in a way where it took time and understanding for them to be a part of their own advocacy, standing up for what they want and being their own cheerleader, I think that’s kind of my community. So I really appreciate a fan who it took work for them to stand up and say, “Hi, this is who I am.” I think that through line between all the people I care about is that even though it was hard to get there, they’re so proud and can’t help but be themselves. And that’s the type of person that I want to speak to.\n\n\tThe cowboy and alien imagery has been part of all the projects you’ve put out, not just the new album.\n\n\tThe cowboy side is my Texan side, my side that loves comfort and sameness and community and feeling at home. Then the alien side is me feeling like I didn’t get the rule book that everyone got where everyone kind of understands how things are supposed to be. It’s also the side of me that feels like I crave something else out there that is bigger than what’s around me. Those two sides have always been at war with each other. They’ve also held hands at times, and helped me make a record like this. So it felt right to bring them back.\n\n\tYou deal with an interesting range of subject matter, from family issues to dealing with the desire for fame.\n\n\tIt is a coming-of-age album. I’m obviously not a teenager, but it’s a a queer coming-of-age, which happens later in life. And it’s also me examining how I feel about where I grew up. I want it to be something that can be really fun, and I want it to be something that can be really devastating. I want it to feel like something that’s kind of steeped in the tradition of country music or folk music, but I also want it to feel like something that can be fresh and looking forward.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAugust Ponthier\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTanner Abel\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGenre-wise, people may think country, because of the cowboy gear, and you’re unabashed in your love for the Chicks and things like that. But it’s not a country album. It’s a pretty pop album.\n\n\tIt’s not a full, straight-ahead country album, but I think the storytelling of country music, the instrumentation of country music, and even the singing quality of country music is present on it. I don’t think it would be a fully me debut album if it wasn’t a combination of things. But one day I would love to make a true, straight-ahead country album. But for this, it is that cowboy and alien dichotomy. It is country music and pop music; it’s country and rock.\n\t\n\n\tIn the songs “Angry Man” and “Bloodline,” which are probably sequenced back-to-back on the album for a reason, you appear to be alluding to some rough family stuff that you’re wondering whether you have to take forward with you in your life. That’s not the stuff everybody in the world writes about. Was that hard for you to get into that territory?\n\n\tYes, I’m very private about my childhood. I’m very private about the struggles that I faced growing up, because it’s from such a deep and painful place that it feels sacred in a way. I also never wanted to feel like I was ungrateful or that it was a betrayal for me to talk about my truth. But, all in all, this has been an album of me telling the truth, even if the truths are complicated and nuanced. And I don’t think I could tell an accurate picture of what it was like growing up in Texas without talking about those things. I’m very aware that the ingredients of who I am as a person make someone that struggles with mental health, and make someone who struggles to feel stable and secure and loved. It’s something I think about all the time, and I pour so much energy into trying to find a new normal. For me to not write about that would be really disingenuous to how much space that’s taken up in my brain over so many years. But yeah, I’m terrified. Those two songs are the scariest things I’ve ever released. And I’m still scared. I mean, even talking about it now, it’s just hard to tell the truth about things, people, places that you really, really love.\n\n\n\n\n\tOn the lighter side, you have the song “Handsome,” which points — humorously — toward your non-binary identity, even though you weren’t there yet when you wrote it. You sing, “Handsome, handsome boy, the world loves you / Don’t know if I wanna be with you or be you.” One verse says, “How are you human? / Painted nails on gentle males / A winning combination / It’s painful and it’s shameful / I’m a poor imitation.” But you’ve said some people misunderstood the song, when you first released it a while ago or were playing it live… they saw it as you possibly really crushing on guys.\n\n\tYeah, the people that get it get it, I guess. I think that “Handsome” was me kind of dipping my toe into the water of: Can anyone believe that I have something more complex going on than what they assume or what they see? And when the answer was kind of mixed — a lot of people thought that the song was about something that it wasn’t — I think that it really just illustrated for me that I need to be explicit about my truth and my identity… Songs can change your life, but the way that “Handsome” changed my life was, it put a lot of pieces together for me. And I think that that is more important than approval from other people.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tIn the spoken bridge, you put some celebrity names in there: “Timothée Chalamet, Jacob Elordi, Oscar Isaac… There’s a new ‘It-Boy’ in town, and she’s a lesbian!”\n\n\tI tried a few different ones in different cities. Basically what happened is, I went on tour with an artist named Niki at the end of 2024, and that was when I started performing “Handsome” for the first time. There was a bit of an instrumental section in the song and, live, it was kind of a bit of dead space. So I would just make jokes on stage, and then it turned into this thing where I would just list It-Boys — specifically, It-Boys who partake in pretty feminine fashion… And it just turned into something that I said at every show, and then it turned into something I had to put on the record, because I loved it so much and I thought it was so fun. There’s some serious tear-jerk stuff on the album, but I also think the highs are really high as well. And I wanted a bit of my sense of humor to also be present on the album, because that’s how I got through all of the hard stuff.\n\n\tLet’s go back to the song “Everywhere Isn’t Texas.” I don’t know if you’re speaking to yourself or actually literally speaking to an audience when you sing, “You don’t have to to stay in Texas.” But at the end it feels like you have a heart for people who are not able to move to New York like you did.\n\n\tI was definitely speaking to myself when I wrote the song. As time has gone on, I think as artists we have to have some kind of responsibility for putting out songs that advise people what to do or or offer other pathways. My fear with the song was that people would think that I thought that leaving is the one solution that fixes every problem, and that’s not how I feel at all. I think that leaving is something that only a few people can do. I think also leaving is something that has its own pros and cons. Leaving didn’t fix every problem for me. At the time, it was what was right because opportunity arose. And I felt like I needed to distance myself from home for a lot of reasons that didn’t even just have to do with politics or identity. But I think that’s why it’s really important that I put the reprise on the album, because “Everywhere Isn’t Texas” is the first thing that I wrote for this album, and the reprise is the last thing that I wrote. The reprise is about the people that stay and the people that survive, and what makes Texans true Texans. To me, that’s the people that fight through adversity and make it a more diverse and interesting place. I wanted to have both on the album, because I think it would’ve been irresponsible to just say, “If something is hard, leave.” But I think for some people, namely the parents of trans children who can leave, or people who have experienced violence that have the opportunity to leave, I do think that’s a message that they shouldn’t feel ashamed for taking. We all have to make choices about our own safety, and for some people that is appropriate.\n\t\n\n\tI will say this: I’m in Texas right now. I’ve gone back to Texas and I’ve been more involved in Texas than I have ever been able to, and that’s not a coincidence… I have worked for the last two-ish years with an organization called TENT (Transgender Education Network of Texas), and they’re constantly at the capitol…\n\n\tWhen I’m telling people, “Leave, if that’s what feels safe. And if you stay, I still wanna make it a better place,” I really believe that. Texas is not something that’s in my rear view. It’s actually all I think about, and it’s why the album is about it. It’s why I keep returning and it’s why I keep speaking out politically, even though, to many people, that may not be advantageous to their careers. I care about it really deeply, and I think the album is about holding nuance — two truths — loving something and criticizing it at the same time.\n\n\n\n",

Cain pled no contest to charges related to a shooting that took place in February 2022. Cain allegedly shot at the vehicle of Harry Goularte, who was reportedly accused of molesting Cain's 4-year-old son.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Goularte is still facing a felony charge of lewd acts with a minor, ESPN reports. According to the outlet, Cain has also filed a civil case against Goularte.\n      \n    \n          While Cain was sentenced to five years, he received credit for time he spent in the county jail after he was initially arrested, as well as for time he spent on house arrest leading up to his 2024 trial.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          During the ordeal, the UFC always stood by Cain.

Saxon sued Kanye, claiming he was hired in September 2021 as project manager, caretaker and 24/7 security for Kanye's Malibu property. In the lawsuit, Saxon alleges he worked brutal 16 hour days and was forced to sleep on the floor using a coat as makeshift bedding while overseeing the remodel.\n      \n    \n          Saxon claims things spiraled in November 2021 when Kanye allegedly demanded he remove all the home's windows and electricity. According to the suit, Saxon raised safety concerns, warning the moves posed \"extreme danger,\" especially after Kanye allegedly insisted on bringing large generators inside something Saxon feared could spark a fire hazard.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He also claims Kanye threatened him, saying he'd be considered \"an enemy\" if he didn't comply, and told him, \"If you don't do what I say, you're not going to work for me.\" Saxon says he refused and was fired on the spot.\n      \n    \n          Tony's suing for unpaid wages and labor code violations and potentially dragging Bianca into the courtroom drama.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Kanye has denied all allegations. In a November 2023 filing, his attorney argued that even if Saxon suffered damages -- which Kanye does not admit -- they were caused by other parties, not Kanye, and any liability should be reduced accordingly. Kanye also claimed Saxon performed work without his knowledge and asked the court to toss the lawsuit entirely.\n      \n    \n          Stay tuned ...\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

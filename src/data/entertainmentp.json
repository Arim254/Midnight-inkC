    "body": "\n\tIt’s so common these days for TV shows to bloat themselves beyond all reason — more than three years later, I think I’m still watching the Season 4 finale of “Stranger Things” — that it feels ungrateful to complain about the opposite problem. But then you get a series like “The Abandons,” the Netflix Western that feels strangely thin and compressed, especially when held up against its epic, sweeping scenery. (“The Abandons” is set in 19th-century Washington and was shot in Alberta.) Even without knowing the production’s chaotic backstory, in which creator Kurt Sutter left the show before filming had even wrapped, and a reported 10-episode order winnowed down first to eight and then just seven, something already feels amiss. With episodes that often run closer to 30 minutes than 60, an under-developed premise and a finale that ends the season so abruptly I had to double check there weren’t more chapters on the way, “The Abandons” is a frustrating, incomplete take on a compelling premise. The title refers to its underserved protagonists in more ways than one.\n\t\n\n\t“The Abandons” is centered on the rivalry between widowed mining mogul Constance Van Ness (Gillian Anderson) and devout Irishwoman Fiona Nolan (Lena Headey), the matriarch of an adopted clan whose land Constance covets. There are echoes of “Deadwood” in how Constance claims to be an advocate for the entire fictional town of Angel’s Ridge, not just her own interests — down to the invocation of a real-life robber baron, this time Cornelius Vanderbilt in lieu of George Hearst, as her investor. But per Sutter’s tastes, the “Sons of Anarchy” creator is more interested in blood feuds and family than the gradual path from frontier to civilization. Tensions are already high between the two groups, with Constance’s men terrorizing Fiona’s cattle while the town sheriff looks the other way. When the elder Van Ness son, a violent sociopath, corners Fiona’s de facto daughter Dahlia (Diana Silvers), a violent confrontation ensues and the conflict kicks into overdrive.\n\t\n\n\tOstensibly, “The Abandons” refers to Fiona’s ragtag crew, who reside in the small, potentially silver-rich community of Jasper’s Hollow alongside a handful of fellow outcasts. Fiona raised Dahlia and her brother Elias (Nick Robinson) as their nanny, then took over their father’s land with the siblings after he passed away. The trio connected with Albert (Lamar Johnson), the son of a Black schoolteacher, and Native girl Lilla Belle (Natalia del Riego) on the way out West, yet the exact origins of the group’s tight and socially anomalous bond go largely unexplained. Albert gets a spotlight episode, but it feels like the stubbornly mysterious Lilla is missing one; Elias gets a cookie cutter Romeo-and-Juliet storyline with Constance’s daughter Trisha (Aisling Franciosi), whose piano skills signal her erudition, but Dahlia gets almost nothing to do except exist in proximity to extreme violence. Such conspicuously uneven character development puts the entire show on unsteady terrain. \n\n\tWhile neglecting its ensemble, “The Abandons” gives pride of place to its two antiheroines. Both lead actors are well within their wheelhouse: Anderson, the former Margaret Thatcher, as a steely, hoarse-voiced Machiavellian; Headey, who broke out as Cersei Lannister, as a mother willing to cross any number of lines to protect her kids. Though neither is exactly a revelation — in the sense that these talents were revealed long ago — each gets space for menacing monologues and mano a mano match-ups. Nobody will mistake “The Abandons” for a feminist treatise, especially given how the story treats Dahlia, but it’s at least a better iteration on the “women in the Old West” concept than the similarly loglined “Godless,” another Netflix release from 2017. (At least “The Abandons” is equal-opportunity with the graphic violence, another Sutter signature: a baffling appearance from comedian Patton Oswalt — perhaps he’s a “Mayans M.C.” super fan? — as the mayor gets cut short by a CGI grizzly in Episode 2. Sadly, we don’t get to see how bear incursions figure into the subsequent election.)\n\n\tIn other words, “The Abandons” knows what to do with Headey and Anderson, at least until their long-awaited showdown ends unresolved. Would that it showed the same awareness of its other elements. The name refers to a found family hoping to thrive in the looser social strictures of a society still under construction. That’s the setup for a great revisionist period piece, but from a blocky, simplistic title card that takes the place of a proper credits sequence, “The Abandons” is a half-hearted execution. Whatever happened between Sutter and Netflix, plenty of beleaguered sets have produced worthwhile end results. “The Abandons” isn’t one of them.\n\t\n\n\tAll seven episodes of “The Abandons” are now streaming on Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJon M. Chu is taking his talents to Paramount Skydance. The “Wicked” director has inked a multi-year first-look film and TV deal with the David Ellison-led studio.\n\n\tThough Chu most recently helmed the blockbuster musical “Wicked: For Good” for Universal, he and his Electric Somewhere production banner previously had a deal at Warner Bros., where he made “Crazy Rich Asians” and “In the Heights.” Now, Chu joins an impressive roster of talent with new pacts at Paramount Skydance, including Matt and Ross Duffer, James Mangold and Will Smith.\n\t\n\n\tThe three-year producing deal goes into effect on Jan. 2. Chu and his production company will be based on the Paramount lot and work closely with Paramount Pictures co-chairs Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein, Motion Picture Group president Don Granger, and Paramount Television Studios president Matt Thunell.\n\n\n\tChu’s move comes as “Wicked For Good” continues to break box office records and garner awards buzz, like its predecessor, which won two Oscars from 10 nominations among numerous other accolades. (Earlier on Wednesday, “For Good” was named one of the National Board of Review’s 10 best films of the year.) 2024’s “Wicked,” starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, became the highest-grossing film adaptation of a Broadway musical ever, earning more than $756 million worldwide. The follow-up, which launched in November, now holds the record for the biggest global opening ever for a movie based on a Broadway show, and the second-highest opening at the domestic box office this year. To date, “For Good” has earned $393.3 million globally, including $122 million internationally and $270 million domestically.\n\t\n\n\tFollowing “Wicked,” Chu has a full dance card of projects in the works at a few different studios: he’s attached to direct the forthcoming Britney Spears biopic at Universal, as well as a live-action Hot Wheels movie at Warner Bros. and the animated film adaptation of Dr. Seuss’s “Oh the Places You’ll Go,” with Ariana Grande and Josh Gad leading the voice cast. He’s also set to helm another stage-to-screen musical in “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.”\n\n\tChu is repped by UTA, Artists First, and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson and Christopher, LLP, and ID PR.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Trump has granted a pardon to Tim Leiweke, the live entertainment executive accused of rigging a bid to build an arena on the campus of the University of Texas.\n\n\tIn a proclamation signed on Tuesday, Trump granted a “full and unconditional pardon” to Leiweke in connection with the charge.\n\n\tLeiweke, the former CEO of Oak View Group, was indicted by Trump’s Justice Department in July and was due to go on trial next year. He was accused of persuading a rival bidder to drop out in exchange for subcontracts on the arena project. OVG ended up as the sole bidder on the arena project, which was completed in 2022.\n\t\n\n\tThe 68-year-old Leiweke could have faced as much as 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine had he been convicted at trial.\n\n\tIn a statement, he thanked the president for his clemency.\n\n\t“I do not have the words to adequately convey my profound gratitude to President Trump,” he said. “This has been a long and difficult journey for my wife, my daughter, and me. The President has given us a new lease on life with which we will be grateful and good stewards.”\n\n\tLeiweke’s lawyer, David Gerger, also issued a statement.\n\n\t“This is the right result, and we are happy for our client and his family,” Gerger said.\n\n\tAfter the indictment, Leiweke stepped down as CEO of Oak View Group, the company he co-founded with Irving Azoff a decade ago. He also denied the allegations.\n\n\t“Mr. Leiweke has done nothing wrong and will vigorously defend himself and his well-deserved reputation for fairness and integrity,” his spokesperson said at the time.\n\t\n\n\tAs a result of the Justice Department’s investigation, OVG agreed to pay a $15 million penalty, while the rival bidder, Legends Hospitality, agreed to pay $1.5 million.\n\n\tLeiweke is a former CEO of Anschutz Entertainment Group and Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. A New Yorker profile in 2012 dubbed him “The Man Who Owns L.A.,” citing his work developing Staples Center — now Crypto.com Arena — and the L.A. Live entertainment complex in downtown L.A.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmidst the pomp and spectacle of the opening ceremony of the Hainan Island International Film Festival (HIIFF), a quiet remembrance stole the show.\n\n\tXing Bo, VP of China Media Group, remembered the victims of the recent Tai Po apartment complex fire in Hong Kong, which has claimed some 159 victims thus far, with some 30 people still missing.\n\n\t“Distinguished guests and friends, as the moon hangs low in the sky, we feel a profound sorrow for the lives lost in the Hong Kong fire and for their families. May the departed be at rest, may the survivors find strength,” said Xing, in a speech before more than 1,000 guests.\n\t\n\n\t“Cinema has always allowed us to realise our shared humanity and inspires us to keep going in the toughest of times. Let us join together to create that beautiful image.”\n\n\n\tThe heartfelt message also acted as a reminder of the outsized role the city has played in Chinese cinema.\n\n\tClips from classic Hong Kong films like “Comrades, Almost a Love Story,” provided a backdrop to one of the night’s big spectacle set pieces, a medley of popular songs from films, as the Hainan International Film Festival celebrates not just its 7th edition, but also the 120th anniversary of Chinese cinema.\n\n\tJames Cameron referred to the anniversary in a video message to the audience.\n\n\t“[Celebrating 120 years of Chinese cinema] is a testament to your passion, both as brilliant creators and as devoted audiences,” said the “Avatar” director.\n\n\t“I’ve always believed in the cinema’s unparalleled big-screen experience. This spectacle, driven by innovation and the boundless spark of imagination, is the very heart of the ‘Avatar’ films. It’s with that same spirit we eagerly anticipate sharing our next chapter,” Cameron said.\n\t\n\n\tHIIFF will host the Chinese premiere of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” later this week, with Cameron in attendance.\n\n\tThe opening ceremony was held at a purpose built outdoor arena on the man-made Phoenix Island in Sanya City, Hainan.\n\n\tThe guestlist for the opening ceremony was heavy on local celebrities such as renowned actor Guo Tao (“I Am Not Madame Bovary”), though light on international attendees. Argentinian director Mariano Llinás and French documentary filmmaker Sylvian George were some notable exceptions, both serving on the festival’s juries.\n\n\t“This year it is obvious that in terms of film artistry and market impact, Chinese films have taken a big step forward,” said jury president Marco Müller.\n\n\tThe 7th Hainan Island International Film Festival runs through Dec. 9.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThough not a Pentecostal horror movie, “Man Finds Tape” does feature both sermonizing and snake-handling (of a sort). The tie between those two elements is murky, however, as is much else about this first feature by writer-directors Peter Hall and Paul Gandersman. They’ve got some interesting ideas gathered in a convoluted narrative involving odd behavior and strange phenomena in the fictitious small town of Larkin, Texas. \n\n\tBut the “Weapons”-like atmospherics that would have suited it best are muffled by hewing to a quasi found-footage format, whose alleged various sources further complicate the telling without really heightening its mystery. The result plays more like an extended “Twilight Zone” episode than the frightening descent into fiendish supernatural conspiracy that’s presumably intended. Magnet is releasing to limited U.S. theaters as well as on-demand platforms Dec. 5. \n\t\n\n\tFilmmaker Lynn Page (Kelsey Pribilski) starts her sporadic voiceover narration with a gratuitous discussion of folkloric terrors that have supposedly been evidenced by video or photos, like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster. “Not all monsters are a hoax,” she later tells us, returning to that theme at the end of a story it really doesn’t have much connection to. What unfolds between isn’t a tale of people fervently wanting to believe in a probably-mythological being, but a community preyed upon in ways that seem to get erased from their collective memory.\n\n\n\tHer brother Lucas (William Magnuson) has called Lynn from their late parents’ house, apparently distraught over whatever he’s learned in the wake of finding an old camcorder cassette labeled with his name. Its disturbing contents show him asleep in bed as a boy, approached by a shadowy intruder who wakes the child just long enough to place something in his mouth. Seeking answers to this creepy scene, Lucas posted it and his own subsequent investigations on YouTube. Those viral clips have gained him social-media fame, if also an audience of skeptics who assume it’s all “fake.” As does Lynn, at first — apparently her brother has a long history of “obsessive behavior” and pathological lying. He swears this time it’s different. Still, Lynn only makes the five-hour drive from her current city of residence to Larkin when, worryingly, he stops answering her calls and texts.\n\t\n\n\tShe finds him in a state of seizure, unconscious before the computer screen, though he appears okay once roused. Such “blackouts,” and subsequent amnesia about their happening, seem to have become epidemic among locals. They might not have been noticed at all if a surveillance camera hadn’t caught an intersection at high noon, around which all citizens seemed to freeze-frame for a few moments — but not a car rolling down the street, which crushes a pedestrian unlucky enough to be in its path just as the “time out” occurs. \n\n\tLucas comes to believe all this is somehow linked to Rev. Endicott Carr (John Ghoulson), the local cleric whose public-access show the Pages’ parents — both dead from an “undiagnosable” illness years prior — had shot as part of their video-centric business. It may also involve Lucas’ ex-girlfriend Wendy (Nell Kessler), who happens to now be carrying the Reverend’s baby as a surrogate. And it’s surely connected to a black-clad stranger (Brian Villalobos) newly surfaced in town, skulking about everywhere with an ancient-looking surgeon’s satchel like a latterday Jack the Ripper.\n\n\tNow investigating together, Lynn and Lucas soon witness alarming incidents involving all of those figures. Eventually, we get some fantastical imagery, including nasty serpent-like parasites and a seemingly endless spiral staircase. But while there’s apparent resolution to Larkin’s plight, there is no real explanation to these wonders, or indeed the whole community’s two-decades-plus of surreptitious peril. \n\n\tThat ambiguity would be less frustrating in a movie more attuned to building suspense and frights, less tethered to a cluttered array of mock “evidence.” There’s video the siblings shoot themselves, surveillance footage, FaceTime calls, voicemails, onscreen text messages, old home movies, clips from the Reverend’s “Salvation Hour” show and so on. It’s an occasionally confusing audiovisual mosaic, in various aspect-ratio formats and degrees of image degeneration, that feels more cluttered than clever. \n\n\tThe character dynamics are intriguing enough, the narrative progress unpredictable enough, that you might wish their potential were maximized by a more straightforward presentation — instead of having to cut through umpteen layers of “found” media. As with all framing chatter about hoaxes, the emphasis on technology ultimately proves rather beside the point of what emerges as “Man Finds Tape’s” core: a novel comingling of organized religion and occult or sci-fi menace. \n\t\n\n\tThat said, Hall and Gandersman compel enough interest to pull viewers through, even if they may find the fadeout less than satisfying. Performances are generally persuasive, tech and design contributions apt, though only Jimmy LaValle’s original score gets to fully step outside the pretense of pre-recorded material and ratchet up a mood of menace. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAnime stands out as the most underused growth engine for streaming platforms across Asia-Pacific, according to new Ampere Analysis data unveiled at Singapore’s Asia TV Forum and Market, where titles such as “Demon Slayer” and “Cyberpunk: Edgerunners” anchor a widening gap between regional demand and what local streamers actually carry.\n\n\tAnime’s dominance across APAC was laid out in detail by Moto Ara of Ampere Analysis, whose presentation maps both consumption and catalogue trends to show that the region hosts the world’s largest anime audience base while local platforms continue to lag far behind global competitors in supply. The study excludes numbers from within Japan. \n\t\n\n\tThe number of distinct Japanese anime titles available on global SVoD platforms outside Japan has risen by 80% in five years, growing from 4,397 in 2021 to a projected 7,865 by Q4 2025. Long-running franchises continue to anchor viewing activity: “One Piece” (1,145 episodes), “Detective Conan” (1,177), “Crayon Shin-chan” (1,301) and “Naruto” remain among the most consistently consumed titles across the region.\n\n\n\tAPAC markets show the strongest affinity for anime globally, with 59% of internet users in the Philippines, 50% in Indonesia, 43% in Singapore and 42% in India identifying as viewers. The region’s supply footprint reflects that appetite: Asia-Pacific carries 5,007 distinct anime titles, far more than North America or Western Europe. Taiwan leads with 3,776 titles available, followed by South Korea (2,181) and Singapore (1,325).\n\n\tA mix of classic and contemporary hits continues to shape viewing patterns. In South Korea, the year’s top anime titles include “Neon Genesis Evangelion,” “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba,” “Cyberpunk: Edgerunners,” “Spirited Away,” “My Neighbor Totoro,” “Princess Mononoke” and “Suzume.” \n\t\n\n\tGenre breakdowns reflect similar trends across APAC: sci-fi and fantasy — represented by “Neon Genesis Evangelion” and “Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion” — accounts for 33% of available anime, followed by action and adventure, home to “Dragon Ball,” “One Piece” and “Demon Slayer,” at 22%. children and family titles such as “Pokémon,” “Detective Conan” and “Doraemon” make up another 22%.\n\n\tAnime fans also emerge as one of APAC’s most valuable streaming cohorts. They skew young, split evenly by gender, and report an average 4 hours and 12 minutes of daily viewing across subscription services, free online video and linear TV. Their top motivations for subscribing include access to large multi-season catalogues, multi-device flexibility and a wide variety of content for the whole family. In markets such as the Philippines and Thailand, anime viewers show a notably lower churn risk than non-fans, making the genre an effective retention driver.\n\n\tYet despite anime’s scale and stickiness, most local streamers remain underweight in the category. New data from Ampere’s supply analysis shows that only Taiwan and South Korea have strong local anime catalogues, with local services carrying 87% and 74% of available titles respectively. Across Southeast Asia, however, global platforms dominate: they account for 52% of anime supply in Indonesia, 61% in Singapore, 74% in India, 80% in Thailand, 88% in Malaysia and 94% in the Philippines. The imbalance underscores how much room local streamers still have to grow in a category that consistently drives engagement across APAC.\n\n\tThe presentation also highlights a robust commissioning pipeline. Announced anime titles across first-run TV, renewals and films rose from 281 in 2021 to 384 in 2024, with the 2024–25 slate diversifying into non-traditional genres and broadening anime’s audience reach.\n\n\tAmpere projects APAC’s subscription streaming market to grow from $24 billion in 2024 to $31 billion by 2030, positioning anime as a central driver of that expansion.

    "body": "\n\t“Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” is a supernatural video-game slasher movie of astonishing clunky crudeness. No, the movie isn’t dumb fun. It’s flat-out bad, maybe even worse than the first film. The “monsters” are amusing to look at, at least for a few minutes — they’re 10-foot-tall, clanking-metal animatronic mascots that escape from the dingy ruins of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, an abandoned kiddie birthday emporium. They can loom up in a threatening way, but they aren’t especially frightening, and the director, Emma Tammi (returning from the first film), stages the violence is such an innocuous way that you feel like you’re watching some bowdlerized network-TV version of a horror film, with the good parts cut out.\n\t\n\n\tThis is not an accident. One of the reasons “Five Nights at Freddy’s” was such a massive hit two years ago is that it was the definition of a PG-13 horror movie: not edgy enough, not scary enough, but just catchy enough in brand and concept to lure in millions of underage video-game freaks. (I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a major overlap between that movie’s fan base and the fan base for the “Sonic” films.)\n\n\n\tAt one point in “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” Chica (voiced by Megan Fox), the giant animatronic baby chick with bedroom eyelashes and “Let’s Party!” written on her shirt, stalks the local high-school principal (Wayne Knight) on the night of the science fair. “What I want is to see what’s going on inside your head,” she says just before squeezing his brains out, though the scene is so unexplicit it remains entirely abstract. “Just what I thought,” says Chika. “Nothing in there at all!” There’s nothing in the movie’s head either. It’s just smirky horror yocks for kids, but the folly of it is that the film gets all tangled up in its convoluted backstory.\n\t\n\n\tIn 1982, 20 years before “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” takes place, we see a party at Freddy’s, where a lone girl, Charlotte (Audrey Lynn-Marie), knew something was amiss. She watched a little boy get taken away by Freddy, the Teddy Bear mascot, and despite her frantic pleas every parent there just brushed her aside. (The way this is staged is so unbelievable it sets the movie on a course of pure schlock.) Freddy, it turned out, was a serial killer in a costume — the one played by Matthew Lillard in the first film. (Lillard is in the new movie for a few minutes.) Charlotte rescued the boy, but in doing so she was killed; she died in front of everyone at the party. Now her spirit has bonded with the Marionette, an animatronic mascot who looks like a kabuki version of Jigsaw. It’s this fused demon who’s making everything happen.\n\n\tJosh Hutcherson is back as Mike, the former security guard at Freddy’s, who spends much of the new movie gawking at a computer screen. Piper Rubio is back as Abby, Mike’s kid sister, who had befriended the mascots and still thinks they’re her pals — it’s her desire to reconnect with them that gets the ball rolling. And the appealing Elizabeth Lail is back as Vanessa, the serial killer’s daughter (the film seems to have forgotten she’s a police officer), who might be getting romantically involved with Mike. All of this is happening simply because the movie, written by Scott Cawthorn (creator of the Freddy’s video-game empire), needs stuff to happen in between weakly staged mascot attacks. But we could hardly care less about it; it’s grinding B-movie gears as “universe building.” At one point it’s revealed that the shiny towering mascots are less powerful than the dirty, damaged prototype versions of them that are sitting in the basement of Freddy’s. Why? Why ask why.\n\n\tIn 2021, two years before the movie version of “Five Nights at Freddy’s” came out, there was a jokey indie horror movie called “Willy’s Wonderland” that was a total knockoff of the “Five Nights at Freddy’s” concept. It starred Nicolas Cage as a drifter who gets stranded in a small town, where he’s forced to spend from dusk till dawn cleaning the title emporium. The animatronic mascot attacks in that movie were genuinely violent (and 10 times as inventive as the ones in the “Freddy’s” films), and Cage, who literally didn’t speak a word of dialogue in the entire movie, had so much aura that he turned the act of cleaning into something hypnotically satisfying. “Willy’s Wonderland” made a total of $450,000 at the box office, but it was nifty and riveting horror camp. “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” which will likely make $60 million this week, is slapdash product that never quite figures out what it’s doing. It operates according to one rule: The gamers must be served.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPhil Upchurch, a guitarist who played with Quincy Jones, Donny Hathaway and Michael Jackson, died on Nov. 23 in Los Angeles. He was 84.  \n\n\tDuring his career, Upchurch recorded nearly 30 albums and appeared on more than 1,000 recordings with some of the biggest artists in Hollywood. Among the hit singles he took part in creating were Chaka Khan’s “I’m Every Woman,” which charted Billboard’s R&B charts for three weeks in 1978, and Jackson’s “Workin’ Day and Night,” from his 1979 solo album “Off the Wall.”\n\t\n\n\tThe guitarist was also featured on all of Hathaway’s solo studio and live albums, Curtis Mayfield’s soundtracks “Superfly,” “Claudine,” “Let’s Do It Again” and “Sparkle” and composed George Benson’s single “Six to Four.”\n\n\n\tUpchurch grew up in Chicago with a father who was a jazz pianist. His first introduction to music began at 13 years old when his father gave him a ukulele. That gift prompted him to explore other instruments, and he mastered playing the guitar, bass and drums.\n\n\tInfluenced by jazz musicians Oscar Peterson and Jimmy Smith, Upchurch’s entry into the music industry started with his first tour performing with the singing group The Spaniels after graduating from high school in 1958.\n\n\tUpchurch served two years in the U.S. Army in the mid-‘60s as a radio reporter stationed in Germany and performed as a musician in the unit’s glee club. After returning home, he took his talents to Chicago record labels where he worked on sessions with jazz and blues artists such as Ramsey Lewis and John Klemmer, Muddy Waters,  Howlin’ Wolf, The Dells and Etta James, and eventually recorded his first single, “You Can’t Sit Down (Parts 1 & 2).”\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to being a musician, Upchurch published two books and was working on an autobiography at the time of his death.\n\n\tHe is survived by his wife, Sonya.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tDIRECTV is serving up even more ways for customers to watch television at home, with the introduction of seven new “multiview Mix Channels” on their streaming platform.\n\n\tOne of the leading over-the-top media services (OTT) in the market today, DIRECTV’s latest offering allows customers to stream up to four live television channels at once from a single screen. It’s an ideal proposition, say, for sports fans wanting to keep up with multiple games; for tuned-in viewers who like to always have the news on; or families divided over the type of content they want to watch. You can toggle among the audio feeds on each of the four channels, or switch to a single channel with the click of a button.\n\n\n\tDIRECTV’s multiview experience is currently available on packages that include DIRECTV “Mix Channels,” a selection of pre-curated channels based on genre and interests. Current Mix Channels include a Sports Mix with ESPN, ESPN2, FS1, NBC Sports Now; a League Sports mix with MLB Network, NBA TV, NFL Network and NHL Network; a News Mix with CNN, Fox News Channel, Fox Weather, MSNBC; and a Kids Mix with Disney Channel, Disney Jr., Disney XD, Nickelodeon.\n\n\tDIRECTV also offers a Business Mix package of multiview channels, a Locals Mix (ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC) in select markets, and a special Sunday Sports Mix that lets you watch live sports on CBS, FOX, ESPN and FS1 all at the same time – and on the same screen. Choose to watch all four pre-selected Mix Channels at once or select the one you want to watch full-screen.\n\n\tMost multiview channels are included in all of DIRECTV’s streaming packages, with some also available in select Genre Packs. Availability varies based on service selection and only includes channels in your DIRECTV package. Feature only available on your television; not available on other devices.\n\n\n\tDIRECTV has long been a pioneer of multi-channel viewing technology, having first introduced mix channels to its satellite TV subscribers back in 2008. The company is now offering the same experience to its OTT service, with viewers able to watch live TV over the internet without needing a satellite dish or cable box.\n\n\tIn a blog post, DIRECTV says this “next generation of mix channels brings this technology fully to streaming, delivering curated, genre-based layouts and local channel mixes for even more ways to watch.”\n\n\tYou can find out more about the multiview experience and see the latest DIRECTV deals and offers at directv.com/affiliates/stream.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDrama production expenditure in Australia reached an unprecedented AUD$2.7 billion ($1.78 billion) in 2024/25, marking a substantial 43% increase over the previous year, according to Screen Australia‘s newly released Drama Report.\n\n\tThe record spending reflects comprehensive growth across the sector, fueled primarily by high-budget feature films and subscription video-on-demand production. International activity accounted for AUD$678 million ($448 million) of the increase, with foreign productions contributing significantly to the overall uplift.\n\t\n\n\tOf 174 titles that entered production during the period, 71 were Australian productions, representing AUD$1.1 billion ($727 million) in spending on local content — a 14% year-over-year increase. However, this marked a decline in Australian productions’ share of total expenditure, dropping from 50% to 40% compared to 2023/24.\n\n\n\t“This strong result is a testament to the hard work and creativity of our screen practitioners, who are navigating a rapidly evolving landscape,” said Screen Australia CEO Deirdre Brennan. “The numbers reflect a complex story of production value and content volume. While there is moderate growth in local drama expenditure, fewer TV titles entered production across free-to-air, subscription-video-on-demand and children’s content, showing ongoing shifts in commissioning behaviour.”\n\n\tThe international production surge proved particularly dramatic, with 20 foreign features filming in Australia generating a record AUD$1 billion ($661 million) in spending. International television and VOD productions added another AUD$458 million ($303 million).\n\t\n\n\tKate Marks, CEO of Ausfilm, attributed the international boom to Australia’s reformed Location Offset incentive program. “This activity helps sustain the ecosystem that supports Australian stories by keeping our crews working, funding training, enabling investments into screen businesses and building capabilities,” Marks said.\n\n\tAustralian theatrical features saw expenditure jump 76% to AUD$379 million ($250 million), though this was driven by a limited number of high-budget films exceeding AUD$50 million ($33 million). Productions in the AUD$1-5 million ($660,000-$3.3 million) range remained the most common.\n\n\tThe television landscape presented a more challenging picture. While subscription TV and SVOD productions spent AUD$492 million ($325 million) on 18 titles (up 5% from the previous year’s 28 titles), free-to-air television expenditure declined 14% to AUD$162 million ($107 million) across 14 titles. Overall, Australian general TV/VOD drama spending remained relatively flat at AUD$654 million ($432 million) across 32 titles, though volume metrics including total titles and hours decreased.\n\n\tChildren’s content experienced a particularly sharp decline, with expenditure falling 41% to AUD$34 million ($22.5 million).\n\n\tStreaming platforms — both Australian and international — now represent 73% of investment in TV/VOD drama, though fewer titles and hours were produced despite increased spending. Cost-per-hour increased notably, reflecting both demand for premium production values and broader industry cost pressures.\n\n\tGeographically, Queensland emerged as the top state for screen production for the first time, achieving a record AUD$925 million ($611 million) in local expenditure and capturing 34% of the national market. This represented a 32% increase over the state’s 2022-23 record of AUD$700 million ($462 million). The surge was driven by a steady pipeline of high-budget productions including “Godzilla x Kong: Supernova,” “Voltron” and the second season of “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters.” International features proved the largest growth area for Queensland, with expenditure more than tripling from the previous year through productions such as “Balls Up,” “Runner” and “Spa Weekend.”\n\n\tNew South Wales captured 31% of spending, followed by Victoria at 27%.\n\t\n\n\tGovernment support remained substantial, with total contributions reaching AUD$430 million ($284 million), including AUD$317 million ($209 million) from the Producer Offset. Post-production and visual effects work generated AUD$762 million ($504 million) in spending, up 33% year-over-year.\n\n\tBrennan emphasized the importance of data-driven decision-making in the current market environment. As part of Screen Australia’s Corporate Plan 2025-2029, the agency plans to expand its research program, including an updated Production Infrastructure and Capacity Analysis in 2026 and a comprehensive Screen Currency report measuring the economic, social and cultural value of Australian screen and games production.\n",

QT spit fire, proclaiming it's nearly a perfect film ... had Paul essentially not screwed it up. Needless to say, fans of the movie -- and of Dano -- were left asking ... WTF, bro?!?\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Dillon Freasier, who played the child version of H.W. Plainview in 'Blood,' tells TMZ … QT is allowed his opinion -- and when it comes to cinema he's usually spot on -- but this insight missed the mark!\n      \n\n          Dillon says ... “The film is perfect. It’s a work of art. And it’s that way because everyone was perfectly cast.”\n      \n    \n          As for QT's suggestion that Austin Butler would have been better in that role than Dano ... Dillon laughs off the nonsensical suggestion, since AB was 15 when they made the film ... and PD was in his early 20s. So yeah, apples and oranges.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Don't get it twisted ... DF says he's a massive Tarantino fan, and he's sure QT is right in his own mind ... but that means people who are pissed about the remarks are also right. Basically, you can have your milkshake, but can't always drink it too.\n      \n    \n          It turns out ... \"There Will Be Blood\" is the only film or TV credit Dillon has on his resume ... telling us, making the film was wonderful, and it turned out perfect, but he had no interest in pursuing acting as a career -- and walked away to have a private life with a big Hollywood W.\n      \n    \n          As for if he'll ever come back to Hollywood, he says it's \"up to the good Lord\" ... 'cause he's too busy working on an actual oil rig. It makes sense -- after all, it's in his blood!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Quentin Tarantino\n              \n                          \n                Austin Butler\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

This is notable because Alexa apparently comes from money. Fans will remember Alexa's dad, Adam, set high expectations for Brennon to uphold a commitment to his daughter's affluent lifestyle.\n      \n    \n          Unfortunate news we didn't see coming ... \"Love Is Blind\" Season 3 stars Alexa and Brennon Lemieux are splitting up after four years and one daughter together.\n      \n    \n          The couple announced the news in an Instagram post Wednesday, writing ... \"After much reflection and many heartfelt conversations, we have made the difficult decision to end our marriage. This choice was not made lightly, and it comes with a great deal of care, respect, and appreciation for the time we’ve shared.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          The estranged couple met on the Netflix reality show and tied the knot on camera in July 2021. They welcomed their baby girl, Vienna Ziva Lemieux, 3 years later.\n      \n\n          Their announcement continued ... \"We entered this relationship with love and optimism, and we leave it with gratitude for the experiences that shaped us and the growth we each gained along the way. While our journey as a married couple is coming to an end, we remain supportive of one another, devoted to our daughter, and committed to navigating this transition with compassion.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Last year, Alexa told People 'LIB' is the only way their marriage would have happened, saying it \"allowed for both of us to communicate and really put ourselves out there.”\n      \n    \n          Sadly, Alexa and Brennon are just the latest \"Love Is Blind\" couple to bite the dust. Season 3's Colleen Reed and Matt Bolton, Season 5's Lydia Gonzalez and Milton Johnson, and Season 7's Ashley Adionser and Tyler Francis all called it quits earlier this year.\n      \n      ",

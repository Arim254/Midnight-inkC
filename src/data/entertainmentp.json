    "body": "\n\tBlake Lively‘s lawyers filed a motion for sanctions Friday against attorneys for Justin Baldoni, accusing them of laughing, speechifying and engaging in other disruptive behavior during depositions.\n\n\tHer lawyers have also complained about questions regarding Lively’s romantic and sexual history, which they argue are irrelevant to her harassment and retaliation lawsuit against Baldoni and others involved in “It Ends With Us.” \n\n\n\t“Ms. Lively’s sexual and/or romantic history has no bearing on the matters at issue in this case and we will not tolerate such examination,” her lawyers wrote to Baldoni’s lawyers, including Bryan Freedman, in September.\n\t\n\n\tLively’s side invoked the “rape shield law,” which protects victims of sexual assault from questions about their sexual history.\n\n\tThe last straw apparently came on Monday, when, according to Lively’s side, Freedman and co-counsel Kevin Fritz impeded and delayed the deposition of Nicole Alexander, who is testifying as a defense expert.\n\n\tLively’s side accused Freedman and Fritz of an “ongoing pattern of deposition misconduct,” including chewing up time by making lengthy objections.\n\n\tLively’s lawyers have filed motions for sanctions several times already in the highly contentious case. In one such instance, they accused Freedman of trying the case in the media. In another, they accused Baldoni’s lawyers of improperly withholding evidence during discovery.\n\n\tThe parties have a court-mandated settlement conference scheduled for Feb. 11. The trial, originally set to begin in March, was postponed earlier this month to May 18.\n\t\n\n\tBaldoni’s team has filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that her allegations amount to nothing more than a “litany of minor grievances” and the case should be thrown out. Lively’s side responded that her director and co-star is seeking to avoid accountability for creating a hostile environment on set. \n\n\tJudge Lewis Liman is expected to hear argument on the summary judgment motion and on one of the sanction’s motions on Jan. 22.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlexander Ludwig and AJ Michalka have been cast in Season 4 of “The White Lotus.”\n\n\tThis makes them the first new additions to the series, which brings in a new lineup of stars — often including several A-listers — with each season. So far, only three cast members have appeared in more than one season: Jennifer Coolidge, who played Tanya McQuoid in Seasons 1 and 2; Natasha Rothwell, who played Belinda Lindsey in Seasons 1 and 3; and Jon Gries, who has played Greg Hunt in all three seasons.\n\t\n\n\tSeason 4 of “The White Lotus” will take place in France, though no plot details are known yet besides that, like previous seasons, it will follow “a new group of White Lotus hotel guests and employees over the span of a week,” according to an official description. Series creator Mike White has also teased a more urban setting: “I want to get a little bit out of the ‘crashing waves against rocks’ vernacular,” he said in a video HBO released after the Season 3 finale. \n\n\n\tDetails regarding Michalka and Ludwig’s characters are not yet known.\n\n\tMichalka is best known as one-half of the pop-rock duo Aly & AJ alongside her sister Aly Michalka. The group rose to prominence after signing with Disney-owned Hollywood Records, with several of their songs appearing in Disney Channel projects and both sisters appearing in the Disney Channel movie “Cow Belles.” Her acting credits have also included the films “The Lovely Bones” and “Super 8.” On TV, she had a recurring role on ABC’s “The Goldbergs” and led the spinoff “Schooled” in addition to voice roles on “She-Ra and the Princesses of Power” and “Steven Universe.” Michalka is repped by United talent Agency, Amplified and Mckuin, Frankel, Whitehead. \n\t\n\n\tLudwig’s prominent roles include Björn Ironside in “Vikings” on the History Channel, Isherwood in “Earth Abides” on MGM+, Dorn in the two most recent “Bad Boys” films” and Cato in “The Hunger Games.” He is repped by Untitled Entertainment, Gersh and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern. \n\n\t“The White Lotus” is executive produced by White, David Bernad and Mark Kamine. \n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix viewers are about to be stirred and possibly even shaken as several James Bond titles are set to come to the streaming giant starting in January. It’s a surprising development considering Amazon MGM owns the James Bond library and the two are streaming competitors. \n\n\tStarting Jan. 15, Netflix subscribers in the U.S., German-speaking countries, France, Latin America and several other territories can watch the most recent Bond movie “No Time to Die” as well as “Die Another Day,” “Quantum of Solace” and “Skyfall” for a three-month period. Other Amazon-owned titles including select “Rocky” and “Creed,” and the “Legally Blonde” films will also stream on Netflix. \n\t\n\n\tAmazon’s original series “Hunters” is already available in the U.S. and several other territories, and “Man in the High Castle” and other series will also stream on Netflix.\n\n\n\tChris Ottinger, Head of Worldwide Distribution at Amazon MGM Studios, said, “When Amazon acquired MGM, Amazon’s plan was to continue licensing MGM’s iconic library to streaming and television partners around the world. Bringing these iconic films and shows to Netflix is part of that continued strategy. James Bond remains one of the most enduring and influential franchises in cinematic history, and alongside other beloved titles in our library like Hunters among other series, this agreement reflects the continued global appetite for premium storytelling and the strong working relationship we’ve built with Netflix.”\n\n\tThe Bond films typically stream on Prime Video for two months each year around Bond Day in October, and also play on MGM+ during the period from October through December. \n\t\n\n\tThe Netflix deal should help keep interest in the franchise alive as viewers wait for the 26th James Bond movie from director Denis Villeneuve. Although the director is already in place, the release date is likely to be several years in the future, possibly in 2028.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMore than two hours of Nick Reiner discussing his heavy drug use and difficult relationship with his parents have been collected in an episode of the addiction and recovery podcast Dopey.\n\n\tThe show, hosted by Dave Manheim, has previously interviewed notable guests including Jamie Lee Curtis, Marc Maron and more. Reiner appeared on the show several times and, in the wake of Rob and Michele Reiner’s death, an episode was released titled “Dopey Emergency Episode: The Reiner Family Tragedy.” After Nick’s arrest for the murder of his parents, the episode paints a grim portrait of his addiction, as well as his often fraught relationship with his parents.\n\t\n\n\tIn one discussion, Reiner talks about going “10 rounds with my guest house,” destroying his parents’ property while high, around the time he had a drug-related heart attack.\n\n\n\t“I got totally spun out on uppers, I think it was coke and something else, and I was up for days on end,” he said. “I started punching out different things in my guest house. I think I started with a TV, and then went over to a lamp, and then progressive…everything in the guest house got wrecked.” \n\n\tWhen asked why he did it, Reiner said that under the influence, “You’re crazy! No logic.”\n\n\tReiner said he began the destruction when his parents told him he needed to leave the guest house because of his drug use, and he got upset. \n\n\tReiner also details the time at 14 years old when he stole $200 from his parents to pay a sex worker to take his virginity while he was “extremely blazed” on edibles.\n\n\t“Some kid that I met at outpatient rehab told me you could do this,” Reiner said. “That’s how I knew how to do it. I think I was watching ‘Tom and Jerry’ or something, and I went over to my computer, got this woman’s number. I called her up.” He then went on to describe the sexual encounter in graphic detail.\n\t\n\n\tReiner also described how he wasn’t sober on the press tour for the 2015 film “Being Charlie,” which he co-wrote inspired by his addiction, and his father directed. He said that while he wasn’t on hard drugs during appearances on programs like “The Howard Stern Show,” he wasn’t clean.\n\n\t“I said to them, ‘Listen, I’m not in the position to do this. I’m not a quote-unquote sober guy,'” Reiner said. “I’m going to have to go on to these talk shows. They say, ‘You gotta do what they want, the whole father-son angle.’ It just shows you how disgusting … I just went out there, and I just realized, ‘Look, I have a voice to some degree. I’m going to say what I’ve got to say while I’m here.'”\n\n\tReiner said that at the end of the day on the promotional circuit, he would “smoke a joint on the roof of my apartment.”\n\n\tListen to all of Reiner’s conversations on “Dopey” in the episode below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThat’s a wrap on “Spider-Man” star Tom Holland for his latest outing as the web-slinging Marvel superhero.\n\n\t“Spider-Man: Brand New Day” director Destin Daniel Cretton announced Friday that filming has wrapped on the fourth of Holland’s solo movies, thanking the star for his “kind, generous leadership on and off screen, for your relentless work ethic, your fearless performances, and for your friendship.” \n\n\n\tIn “Brand New Day,” Holland returns as Peter Parker after the kid from Queens accidentally broke open the multiverse in 2021’s “No Way Home,” and is forced to make the difficult decision to make the entire world, including his closest friends MJ and Ned (Zendaya and Jacob Batalon), forget his identity. The Sony/Marvel movie also features Mark Ruffalo (as original Avenger Bruce Banner aka the Hulk), Jon Bernthal (Frank Castle/the Punisher), “Severance” standout Tramell Tillman, “The Bear’s” Liza Colon-Zayas, Michael Mando (Scorpion), Marvin Joness III (Tombstone) and Sadie Sink (playing an undisclosed, but much-discussed role). \n\t\n\n\t“I’m so deeply grateful for the people who walked with me through the biggest, most rewarding film I’ve ever been a part of,” Cretton wrote on Instagram. “To our amazing cast, for breathing so much life into these beloved characters and moving us every day. To our unbelievable crew, who worked tirelessly with unmatched creativity and craftsmanship, who made me laugh so hard my stomach never stopped hurting. I love you all so much and can’t wait for the world to see your stunning work on the big screen.”\n\n\tOn a more personal note, Cretton also thanked his wife, fashion designer Nikki Chapman, “for laughing through the insanity and carrying our entire family on your back” and his kids “for forcing me to put my phone down and get out of my head long enough to build a fort in the living room with couch cushions.” \n\t\n\n\t“Brand New Day,” which swings into theaters on July 31, is Cretton’s second MCU movie, following 2021’s “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.” He was previously set to direct the now-scrapped “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty,” but departed the project in November 2023. Cretton is also the co-creator and one of the directors of the upcoming “Wonder Man” series. The Disney+ show, starring Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, begins streaming on Jan. 27.\n\n\t“Captain Marvel” star Brie Larson, who starred in Cretton’s acclaimed 2013 indie “Short Term 12,” was among the many commenters to salute the filmmaker on a job well done, writing, “Congrats!!!! Love you bro!” and “Hugs to my spidey too!!!”\n\n\tThe “Brand New Day” update comes as the first teaser for the next “Avengers: Doomsday” debuted in theaters ahead of “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” The clip for the movie, out next December, reveals the return of Chris Evans as Steve Rogers. Anticipation for the new Spider-Man movie is high, as each of Holland’s outings has been more successful at the box office than the last. “Spider-Man: Homecoming” grossed $880 million in 2017; then, in 2019, “Far From Home” generated $1.13 billion. 2021’s “No Way Home,” which featured previous Spider-Men Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, became the first post-pandemic blockbuster, with a global box office haul of $1.9 billion.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Last Frontier” has been canceled after one season at Apple TV.\n\n\tThe thriller series stared Jason Clarke as Frank Remnick, who is described as “the lone U.S. marshal in charge of the quiet, rugged barrens of Alaska. Remnick’s jurisdiction is turned upside down when a prison transport plane crashes in the remote wilderness, setting free dozens of violent inmates. Tasked with protecting the town he’s vowed to keep safe, he begins to suspect the crash wasn’t an accident, but the first step of a well-crafted plan with far-reaching and devastating implications.”\n\t\n\n\tAlong with Clarke, “The Last Frontier” starred Dominic Cooper, Haley Bennett, Simone Kessell, Dallas Goldtooth, Tait Blum and Alfre Woodard. Jon Bokenkamp and Richard D’Ovidio created the series and served as executive producers along with Clarke, Laura Benson, Glenn Kessler, Albert Kim and director Sam Hargrave.\n\n\n\t“The Last Frontier” received mixed reviews from critics, achieving a 46% on Rotten Tomatoes. Variety‘s review said that after “an entertaining bait-and-switch” in the first episode, the show “gets bogged down in a serialized plot that’s more convoluted and generic than the simple pleasures of maniacs running amok and small-town cops chasing them down.”\n\n\t“The Last Frontier” premiered on Oct. 10, with the Season 1 finale coming on Dec. 5. In an interview with Variety after the finale, Bokenkamp and D’Ovidio said they were already discusing ideas for a potential second season, including a change of location. “I think that we’ve discussed many avenues to take with the second season, but we’ve pretty much exhausted a lot of stories in Alaska,” D’Ovidio said, with Bokenkamp adding, “We’ve certainly talked a lot about where they end up, maybe a beach somewhere. But it also occurs to me that the U.S. Marshals hunt bad guys around the world. Sidney [Bennett] and Havlock [Cooper] represent a problem to Frank, but that doesn’t mean they are his only problem.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains details about Episode 5 of “Heated Rivalry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie really are as close they appear. So much so that Williams stayed with Storrie in his Los Angeles apartment when he flew to the U.S. to do some press together for the show.\n\n\t“We were like, ‘Oh, my God, if people saw us just getting ready in the morning, giving each other big spooning hugs, just to say we’re proud of each other,’ people would be going crazy,” Williams tells me during a Zoom video interview on Tuesday. “If only one fan had access, God forbid. But yeah, we just love each other very dearly.”\n\t\n\n\tIt’s been less than a month since “Heated Rivalry” premiered on HBO Max — the company acquired Jacob Tierney’s adaptation of Rachel Reid’s queer romance novel series “Game Changers” from Canadian streamer Crave — but Williams and Storrie have quickly become the It Boys of Hollywood for their work as professional hockey stars Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov, respectively. Their performances — the hot and the steamy sex scenes as well as the emotional rollercoaster rides — are not only the talk of the town, but they’ve also become viral hits with memes and GIFs flooding social media.\n\n\n\t“It’s sort of overwhelming and daunting,” Williams says. “The people who reach out, the free stuff that I don’t need — but that’s very nice — the offers, the not knowing what’s up or down, has been a lot.”\n\n\tLet’s get right to it — Episode 5.\n\t\n\n\tI love that episode a lot.\n\n\tI didn’t realize that I wasn’t breathing when Scott was motioning for Kip to come down to the rink. I was like, “Is he going to kiss him?” When they kissed, I exhaled and teared up.\n\n\tYou just gave me chills. Wow.\n\n\tAnd then Connor delivering that monologue on the phone in Russian.\n\n\tI hadn’t seen that yet because I wasn’t there for that day, but then the first time I got to see it, I was like, “Holy shit! Oh, my God! What an actor!” I’m a Connor Storrie fan.\n\n\tDid you know what these books were before you auditioned?\n\n\tI didn’t even know hockey smut was a thing.\n\n\tThere’s your now famous quote in which you said that you thought Connor was going to pin you down and fuck you during your chemistry read.\n\n\tObviously, that quote is tongue in cheek. I’d read a decent amount of the book and read some discussion about the characters before my read with Connor so I kind of knew what Ilya should be like. I knew that they have this soft sub/dom relationship. It was like, “OK, Ilya should be someone who could pin Shane down and fuck him.” That was Connor.\n\n\tDid you think it was going to be Shane’s girlfriend Rose who would help him come out as gay?\n\n\tNo, because I knew nothing about the books. That scene broke me. Just even reading it, I was like, “What a blessing for Shane to have a person who he can talk to because Ilya, God bless him, he’s an awful communicator, just truly one of the worst. He’s Slavic. Those guys aren’t the best at doing the heart-to-heart. To have someone like Rose, who’s liberal and kind and soft and forward-thinking, there are women who would be really hurt by what happened with Shane, but she is such a beautiful character.\n\n\tIn the same scene, Shane also comes out as a bottom.\n\n\tI had to clarify.\n\n\tI have to say I was surprised when he was like, “Yeah, I prefer being the hole than the peg.”\n\n\tShane’s on the spectrum so he has to be specific.\n\n\tWhat did you learn about yourself while filming the show?\n\n\tThat’s a good question. I think I had my own biases, maybe that would be too strong of a word, but my own discomfort if I expressed myself fully, physically and affectionately, both with women and men. It would feel inappropriate. I realized if you really do love someone — platonically or not — I’m such a tactile, sensory person. There are so many taboos. It’s much harder on men. I had to let that go, and I got to learn how freeing that is. That also went hand-in-hand with being myself, truly as an artist. Connor was also a great person to have at my side. I think we both opened each other up to just be freer, more fully expressive.\n\t\n\n\tTell me about your first sex scene with Connor in the hotel room. Connor is fully dressed but you had to get naked.\n\n\tThere’s a quick shot of him fucking me doggy style. I remember, I was like, “Oh yeah, OK, get naked, have this rough sex. That’s kind of cool.” The only thing that that day that I was left with was stomach pain because his genitalia is in a cock sock, a ballet slipper, but it’s lined up below my butt. They’re like, “Do you want a pad?” There’s a crash pad that intimacy coordinators provide to so you can get a hard thrust. I was like, “I’m good, I’m tough. I’m comfortable, cozy.” But he starts going and male genitalia is very obtrusive. It’s not discreet. We start filming and its crashing into into my balls, and he starts slamming me. My stomach is in a twisting pain. So that was the only part that I was like, “Fuck, that kind of hurt.” But beyond that, it was more like how do I not make people on set uncomfortable. I don’t want to be here with my butthole in the air and then make a grip uncomfortable when they come to fix a light. But once I found out they were so warm and really passionate about the show, I didn’t have to tiptoe, and I was very comfortable getting naked.\n\n\tHave you always been comfortable being naked or that’s something that came while filming the show?\n\n\tI was very uncomfortable being naked like in high school. It terrified me. But then acting freed me up. You have to be emotionally naked and physically naked. I worked in acting classes doing scenes where I’m very not clothed, doing short films where I’m doing sex scenes that are a lot less glamorous and lot less nicely lit than “Heated Rivalry.” I found a way to be comfortable with both my sexuality, my sensuality and my naked body before the show.\n\n\tShould there be a crossover of “Heated Rivalry” and “I Love LA”?\n\n\tThere has to be. I am such a big fan of their show. I love Odessa [A’zion]. I love Josh Hutcherson. They’re all so brilliantly funny. I find myself rewinding scenes just to remember a line they said.\n\n\tHave you heard from Jordan Firstman since everything went down? [The “I Love LA” star faced backlash when he said in a recent interview that the depiction of gay sex in “Heated Rivalry” is “not how gay people fuck.”]\n\t\n\n\tI like cattiness and opinionated people. That’s never bugged me. It was a little bitchy, but that’s OK in my books. There have been days when I’ve done 17 interviews in a day, so you’re not exactly going to be as good at censoring things. It’s no hard feelings, but he reached out and sent a very nice apology. [Just a couple hours after this interview, Williams met Firstman for the first time at a party and posted a photo of them together on his Instagram.]\n\n\tI think a lot of people are going to jump on the line that Rose says about there being a lot of gay actors who aren’t out of the closet.\n\n\tI like how the show doesn’t necessarily comment on it because Rose never goes, “You know, these pussies stay in the fucking closet.” She understands her conversation with Shane is in confidence, and it’s private. Me being a young actor and not knowing how to do any of this, I think Connor and I both were very quickly on the same page of, “We don’t have to do this. It’s 2025 so let’s just keep that private.”\n\n\tWhen do you start shooting Season 2?\n\n\tMaybe someone has told me July or August, but I really don’t know.\n\n\tSo you’re going to have to keep in shape for a while.\n\n\tI’m gaining 10 pounds for Season 2 — 10 lean pounds.\n\n\tThis Q&A was edited for length and clarity.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains major spoilers for plot points in “The Housemaid,” now in theaters.\n\n\tFor fans of Freida McFadden’s thriller no",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains major spoilers for plot points in “The Housemaid,” now in theaters.\n\n\tFor fans of Freida McFadden’s thriller novel “The Housemaid,” watching the Lionsgate adaptation movie was a bit of a different experience — we went in knowing the twist. While most of the largest moments in the book were represented in the movie, not everything weas the same. In fact, one storyline was much smaller in the film than in the book.\n\t\n\n\t“The Housemaid” follows a young woman, Millie (Sydney Sweeney), who has a dark past and is desperate for work; she excitedly accepts the job as a live-in housemaid for a wealthy family, Nina and Andrew Winchester (Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar). Soon, she finds out their seemingly perfect life is far from it.\n\n\n\tThe book is split into two perspectives — first, Millie’s, then Nina’s. From Millie’s POV, Nina is the villain, a mentally unstable, harsh wife and mother while Andrew does everything to keep her happy. From the community, Millie hears that Nina tried to take her own life after leaving her daughter to die in the bathtub. Luckily, doting husband Andrew called the police just in time and Nina was hospitalized. He’s the man who chose to stay with her and take care of her.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrandon Sklenar as Andrew Winchester and Amanda Seyfried as Nina Winchester \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel McFadden/Lionsgate\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe second half of the book and movie, Nina’s POV reveals what actually happened: Shortly after marrying Andrew, he began abusing her and locking her in the attic without food, torturing her. He once drugged her and she woke up in the bathroom only to discover her daughter in the bathtub — and the police taking her away. From then on, he continued to punish her and threatened to get her taken away again if she didn’t stay. She decided to hire Millie so that she could escape — she knew he’d cheat — but also because of Millie’s past. Millie spent 10 years in prison for murdering a man who assaulted a friend — so she could take him down.\n\t\n\n\tBelow, Variety breaks down some of the biggest changes from the book and the movie — including that ending.\n\n\tAndrew’s torture of Millie\n\n\tIn both the movie and the book, Millie starts to put together what has happened after Andrew locks her in the attic, beginning to torment her. But in the book, he makes Millie painfully balance three large books on her stomach for hours. He has installed a camera to watch and when she doesn’t do it correctly the first time, he makes her do it again.\n\n\tIn the movie, the scene is more violent. Since she’s been locked in the attic for accidentally breaking antique dishes, he orders her to, using a piece of the plate, slice 21 deep cuts into her stomach.\n\n\tMillie’s torture of Andrew\n\n\tIn the book, Millie then taunts Andrew and gives him a taste of his own medicide, asking him to balance the same three books on his groin, then instructs him to pull out his teeth with pliers.\n\n\tIn the movie, after being let out, Millie uses the knife Nina has hidden inside to slit Andrew’s throat and lock him inside the room. As he bleeds out, she breaks more of his mother’s china in front of the door and instructs him to pull out his front tooth since he’s convinced too many people he’s a good person with this perfect smile.\n\n\tAndrew’s death\n\n\tIn the book, the gardener, Enzo (who knew what happened to Nina, and stayed on the grounds to try and help), convinced Nina to go back to the house to save Millie. When she does, she finds Andrew in the attic, dead of starvation.\n\n\tThe movie gets a bit darker; Nina’s daughter is the one to convince her to go back and help Millie, but when she returns to the attic, she opens the door assuming Millie is locked inside. Instead, Andrew is alive and charges out, trying to attack both Nina and Millie; eventually, he begs Nina to give him another chance, giving her the opportunity to tell him how awful he is. Ultimately, Millie shoves him over their spiral staircase where he falls to his violent death.\n\n\tThe end\n\n\tA policeman questions Nina in the book, revealing that his daughter was once involved with Andrew. In the movie, it’s a policewoman who does the interrogating before sharing that her sister was in a relationship with him. Since they both knew the harm he caused, they believe that his death was an accident. \n\t\n\n\tAt the end of the book Millie teams up with Enzo to form a group to help women in abusive relationships. That doesn’t exist in the movie but the flash forward to one year later is the same: she’s interviewing for a new position at the home of  woman who’s being abused and got her name from Nina. Has she been hired to kill him? Possibly. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichele Morrone as Enzo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel McFadden/Lionsgate\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEnzo’s patricipation\n\n\tOverall, it’s important to note that in the book, the family groundskeeper Enzo is a much larger part of the story, trying to help Nina escape multiple times and eventually, helping her come up with the plan to hire a new woman to draw Andrew’s attention away. Millie once makes a move on him, knowing that it’d be smarter than going after Andrew, a married man. He turns her down.\n\n\tAfter she did escape, Nina and Enzo spends a night together. Eventually, he tells her it’s not right to leave Millie in danger with Andrew. Later, he calls to alert her the attic light on is on and Millie hasn’t been seen in days, encouraging Nina to come check on her. She agrees to do so as long as he’ll protect her daughter; he does just that.\n\n\tIn the movie, the character, portrayed by Michele Morrone, was barely part of the story. It’s made clear, eventually, that he did help Nina try to escape but he’s more of a background character than a key part of the film.\n\n\tIf more movies come out, and they stay close to the story told in the books, Enzo will be back — and not in a small way.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Recording Academy has announced its Special Merits Awards for 2026, observing the Lifetime Achievement Award, Trustee Award and Technical Grammy Award recipients: Carlos Santana, Chaka Khan, Cher, Fela Kuti, Paul Simon, and Whitney Houston are the Recording Academy Lifetime Achievement Award honorees; Bernie Taupin, Eddie Palmieri and Sylvia Rhone are the Trustees Award honorees; and John Chowning is the Technical Grammy Award honoree. The ceremony will be held on will be held on Jan. 31, 2026, at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s a true honor to recognize this year’s Special Merit Award recipients — an extraordinary group whose influence spans generations, genres and the very foundation of modern music,” said Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy. “Each of these honorees has made a profound and lasting impact, and we look forward to celebrating their remarkable achievements on the eve of Grammy Sunday.”\n\n\n\t+ The Songwriters Hall of Fame has announced the posthumous induction of Jerry Ragovoy, a prolific songwriter and producer whose hits include “Time Is on My Side,” “Piece of My Heart,” “Try (Just a Little Bit Harder),” “Cry Baby,” “Get It While You Can,” “Ain’t Nobody Home,” “A Wonderful Dream,” “Stay with Me,” and many more; several of those hits were written under the pseudonym Norman Meade.\n\n\tRagovoy, who passed away in 2011 at age 80, was honored during an intimate ceremony last week in New York.\n\n\t+ Pioneering independent music company Beggars Group secured a majority stake in XL Recordings in 2024, according to newly released documents reported by Music Business Worldwide.\n\t\n\n\tBeggars had long held a 50% stake in XL, but its most recent annual earnings filing with the UK’s Companies House confirms that it paid a $3.3 million consideration to XL Recordings’ “other shareholder” in October 2024 to acquire a majority stake — who would be XL co-owner Richard Russell. Following the transaction, Beggars Group’s ownership share of XL Recordings rose to 51%. XL, known for releasing Adele’s first three albums as well as major hits by the Prodigy, Fontaines D.C, and others, is now listed as a subsidiary of Beggars rather than a joint venture.\n\n\t+ Island Records has promoted Caroline Ellis to Vice President, A&R. Based in Los Angeles, she will report to Jackie Winkler, Senior Vice President, Head of A&R, Island Records.\n\n\tEllis will continue to handle A&R for artists across the label, including Chappell Roan and Suki Waterhouse. Ellis recently signed the Platinum-certified and acclaimed actress, Waterhouse, who is currently in the studio working on new music.\n\n\t“Caroline has impeccable taste and a rare ability to connect with artists, building the kind of trust that fuels great music,” said Winkler.  “Her exceptional ear and steady temperament are true assets to the team, and I’m thrilled to see her step into this richly deserved role as VP of A&R.”\n\n\tEllis joined Island Records in 2020 as Senior Director, A&R after a stint at Interscope Records, where she worked with the 1975, Japanese House, Jack Garratt and Pale Waves.\n\n\t+ BMG has renewed and expanded its direct music publishing agreement with TikTok. According to the announcement, the new agreement strengthens BMG’s leadership in modernizing publishing deals by raising reporting and attribution standards across digital platforms and introducing improvements to how publishing rights are managed and promoted.\n\n\tTracy Gardner, Global Head of Music Business Development, TikTok, said, “BMG truly understands the power of TikTok and the opportunity it creates for songwriters today. They understand the platform, they embrace innovation, and they work with us hand-in-hand to strengthen rights management and unlock meaningful value. This expanded partnership reflects the trust and momentum we’ve built together — and we’re excited to continue driving growth for the songwriters at the heart of music discovery on TikTok.”\n\t\n\n\tCeline Joshua, EVP, Global Marketing and Streaming, said, “This agreement underscores our focus on building scalable, forward-looking partnerships that elevate the role of songwriting in today’s music economy. We continue to invest in systems and structures that protect rights, ensure attribution, and add value for creators across the digital landscape.”\n\n\t+ Universal Music Group and Splice have agreed to collaborate on joint exploration of the next generation of AI-powered music creation tools for musical artists. The agreement builds on Splice’s suite of AI-enabled creator tools and will also explore AI-powered virtual instruments and tools that enable UMG artists to bring their own sounds into Splice’s AI workflows.\n\n\tMichael Nash, EVP & Chief Digital Officer, Universal Music Group said, “We’re excited to form this alliance with Splice to promote the alignment of innovation and ethicality in addressing the interests of the creative community to leverage cutting-edge AI-enabled tools to further their artistic expression. We look forward to partnering with Kakul Srivastava and her team on this critically important strategic technology front.”\n\n\t“We’ve spent time building AI tools designed to fairly compensate creators and keep them in control,” said Kakul Srivastava, CEO of Splice. “We’re thankful for Universal’s continued support, and excited to work together to put these commercial tools in the hands of artists everywhere, knowing they can trust the end result.”\n\n\tMonday, December 15\n\n\tHYBE has announced a significant expansion into the rapidly growing African music market through a new global management partnership with two influential voices shaping African and diaspora music: Brandon Hixon and Colin Gayle.\n\n\tTogether, they are launching a global management initiative designed to amplify African artists, develop cross-cultural storytelling, and build long-term creative pathways across the U.S., Asia, and the world, according to the announcement. Under this partnership, HYBE will establish a pipeline of emerging and established talent and sign new artists. Tyla — honored at Variety‘s Young Hollywood event last summer — will be the first artist supported under this expanded vision. She will continue to be guided by Hixon and Gayle, with HYBE providing additional global reach.\n\t\n\n\t“We are thrilled to partner with cultural architects like Brandon Hixon and Colin Gayle, whose vision is essential to driving the powerful momentum of African artistry onto the global stage,” said Jason Jaesang Lee, CEO of HYBE. “This partnership represents a pivotal moment in HYBE’s global expansion strategy. By combining their expertise with our global network and resources, we will establish a strategic, sustainable bridge designed to amplify authentic African voices and artistry to fans across the world.”\n\n\tHixon said, “Our work has always been about connecting great artists with the world in the right way. HYBE brings a global perspective that complements how Colin and I build. Together, we can help artists move freely and tell their stories on the biggest stages.”\n\n\tGayle added, “We’re entering a moment where African artists have unlimited potential. With HYBE’s collaborative support, we can help them expand their reach while staying true to the roots that make this music extraordinary.”\n\n\t+ The ASCAP Foundation, the charitable organization dedicated to supporting American music creators, today announced that Patricia Leonard has been appointed to serve as executive director. She succeeds Nicole George-Middleton, who was recently promoted to executive vice president, head of creative membership at ASCAP.\n\n\t“For 50 years, The ASCAP Foundation has succeeded by providing recognition and support so that developing music creators of all kinds can flourish,” said The ASCAP Foundation President Paul Williams. “We are elated to have Patricia Leonard take over the Executive Director role and confident that her love of music and her deep background in the arts and philanthropy will enable the Foundation to continue to thrive for years to come.”\n\n\tLeonard joins the ASCAP Foundation with more than two decades of experience in arts and philanthropy. She was formerly chief philanthropy officer with the Princess Grace Foundation, where she led the planning and execution of charitable events and sponsorship opportunities and created new programs such as the Crown Patrons Society for high-value donors. Prior to that, she served as the director of institutional giving for the Manhattan Theatre Club and as director of institutional relations for the Metropolitan Opera. She serves on the boards of the New York New Music Ensemble and New York Women Composers, is a founding member of the New York Composers Circle, and is the composer of “My Dearest Friend,” an opera inspired by the letters of John and Abigail Adams.\n\t\n\n\tFounded in 1975, the ASCAP Foundation has supported American music creators through music education, talent development and humanitarian programs. In 2024 alone, its programs reached more than 300,000 individuals, including 60,000 K–12 students, through scholarships, mentorship initiatives and educational programs.\n\n\t+ Nick Hartley, [PIAS]’ longtime chief operating officer and chief financial officer, has announced his retirement and will step down from both roles and his position on the company’s board, effective December 31st, 2025.\n\n\tHartley started his career as a chartered accountant before moving from the UK to Australia in 1984 to take up his first music industry role with EMI Australia, where he quickly rose to become finance director. He then moved to PolyGram Australia in 1990 as CFO and was promoted to the role of PolyGram U.K. Group CFO in late 1995 after returning to the UK. He left PolyGram in late 1998 after its acquisition by Universal and joined [PIAS] in January 2000. Under his guidance, the company has expanded its global operations, enhanced financial performance, and continued to foster successful partnerships with artists and labels. He also played an important role in the acquisition of [PIAS] by Universal in 2024.\n",

You may not recognize the likes of Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña and Kate Winslet when they’re rendered as blue Na’vi aliens on screen, but every movement and facial expression belongs to them.\n\n\tAs is the case with every “Avatar” theatrical release, Cameron and his cast have spent a significant amount of their press tour urging viewers to understand the amount of human effort that goes into the Na’vi performances. Nothing about the acting in the “Avatar” movies is fake, or as Cameron recently put it: “We don’t use [generative AI] on the ‘Avatar’ films. We honor and celebrate actors. We don’t replace actors.”\n\n\tZoe Saldaña, who plays Neytiri in the “Avatar” movies, told Beyond Noise earlier this year that performance capture “is the most empowering form of acting” because “it gives us the credit, the ability to own 100% of our performance on screen… Performance capture means that ‘Avatar’ wouldn’t exist if Sigourney Weaver, Sam Worthington, Stephen Lang, Kate Winslet, myself and the entire cast didn’t get up and put those dots on our faces.”\n\n\tSo who are the humans behind all the Na’vi characters? Scroll below for a complete rundown of the “Avatar: Fire and Ash” cast.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSam Worthington as Jake Sully\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tSam Worthington returns as Jake Sully, who must confront the grief pulling his family apart in order to protect them against Pandora’s human invaders and a new, more antagonistic tribe of Na’vi.\n\n\t“My job in the performance capture, the acting part, that’s been the same. It’s just pure acting with another person,” Worthington recently told Variety about making “Avatar” movies for more than a decade. “The digital makeup is way more nuanced now. Every thought, every movement my body does when I’m truthful has been protected. “That was a promise Jim made me in the first movie — and he’s delivered on it. It’s incredible to watch because it is me, 100%.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tZoe Saldaña as Neytiri\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tZoe Saldaña returns to the role of Neytiri. Following the death of her son Neteyam in “The Way of Water,” Neytiri finds herself consumed by grief and vengeful against the humans who killed him. This rage puts her at odds with Spider (Jack Champion), the human child who is the Sully’s adopted son.\n\n\tThe Oscar winner has called the performance capture technology used on the “Avatar” movies “the most empowering form of acting,” adding: “It gives us the credit, the ability to own 100 percent of our performance on screen… From the archery, the martial arts, the free diving, the scuba diving  to the language [James] conceived out of thin air, to physically training with former gymnasts, circus performers, and acrobats so you can learn how to walk like an extraterrestrial human species… That’s all us, and a group of incredible stunt actors that make our characters feel bionic. God bless them. With the technology that Jim creates, he gives the artist the power of complete ownership.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSigourney Weaver as Kiri\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJames Cameron’s “Aliens” icon Sigourney Weaver plays Jake and Neytiri’s adopted teenage daughter Kiri, who during “The Way of Water” appeared to possess powers connected to Pandora’s spiritual center Eywa. These powers and Kiri’s connection to Eywa are explored further in “Fire and Ash” and make her one of the most powerful characters in the franchise.\n\n\tWeaver recently told Variety that “Avatar’s” environmentalism themes match her real-life interests, explaining: “I’m very involved with the oceans and the High Seas Treaty. The movie shows even more graphically what corporations and humans are willing to do to their fellow creatures. It’s so sad — but it educates you. These creatures are equal citizens of our world. You need to wake up… respect other species. This is not your world. You can’t just do whatever you want with it.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tStephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tStephen Lang’s Colonel Miles Quaritch is at the center of an existential crisis in “Fire and Ash” after discovering in the previous film that Spider is his biological son. Quaritch’s mission remains to imprison Jake Sully, but it gets increasingly complicated by the fact that Spider loves Jake and views him as his actual father. Spider is more or less one of the Sully children, which forces Quaritch to team up with Jake in order to protect them all.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOona Chaplin as Varang\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tOona Chaplin is the major new addition to the “Avatar” franchise in “Fire and Ash” as Varang, the leader of a volcanic tribe of Na’vi. Varang’s people regularly run raids on other Na’vi tribes to secure resources after a volcano decimated their home and left them bitter at Eywa. As the franchise’s late producer Jon Landau once put it: “There are good humans and there are bad humans. It’s the same thing on the Na’vi side. Oftentimes, people don’t see themselves as bad. What is the root cause of how they evolve into what we perceive as bad? Maybe there are other factors there that we aren’t aware of.”\n\n\tChaplin praised the “Avatar” franchise back in 2018 when she was cast in the role and described it as “Trojan horse cinema” due to how Cameron uses big budget filmmaking “to explore things that he finds important…like our relationship with nature, our relationship with people, our relationship with ourselves and the spirit.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBritain Dalton as Lo’ak\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tBritain Dalton returns as Lo’ak, Jake and Neytiri’s second son whose relationship with his father is especially strained following the death of his older brother. Lo’ak is a hot head, with Dalton once telling press: “He’s a rebel, sort of a guy who gets in trouble and a screw-up in that way. He’s an outcast and he’s alone in the world.” But his brother’s death forces Lo’ak to mature amid serious growing pains.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTrinity Bliss as Tuk\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe Sully family’s youngest daughter is Tuk, played by Trinity Jo-Li Bliss. While she often needs to be protected by her older siblings amid various battles and chases, Tuk “does not see herself as the youngest” and “she’ll do anything to protect her family and Pandora,” Bliss once told Variety. Tuk’s courage factors into one of “Fire and Ash’s” most climactic moments.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDavid Thewlis as Peylak\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAlso new to the “Avatar” franchise in “Fire and Ash” is David Thewlis as Peylak, who is the leader of the Wind Traders. This tribe of Na’vi are sky-bound and nomadic and live on massive, flying caravans that traverse Pandora. Viewers only get an introduction to Peylak and the Wind Traders in the film, although James Cameron has been clear that this tribe would play a bigger role in “Avatar 4” should it move forward.\n\n\t“They’re going to be throughout the cycle of 3, 4 and 5,” Cameron told Empire previously. “They’re still 100% Na’vi but they’re not place-specific, which is different because most indigenous people are very rooted in their sense of place.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKate Winslet as Ronal\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tKate Winslet, reuniting once again with Cameron after “Titanic,” plays Ronal, a free diver of Pandora’s water tribe (called the Metkayina) and the wife of the tribe’s leader Tonowari. Ronal remains pregnant as “Fire and Ash” begins.\n\n\t“She is strong. A warrior,” Winslet told Empire magazine about her character. “Even in the face of grave danger, and with an unborn baby on board, she still joins her people and fights for what she holds most dear: her family and their home.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCliff Curtis as Tonowari\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCliff Curtis plays Tonowari, the leader of Pandora’s Metkayina tribe who is under increased scrutiny from his people after accepting the Sully family and putting a target on the tribe’s back as a result. The human forces are once again targeting the Metkayina village for various reasons. Quaritch is on a mission to arrest Jake Sully, while the larger RDA forces are continuing to hunt the whale-like Tulkun creatures for their plasma. Just because the RDA’s mission failed in “The Way of Water” does not mean they are going down without a fight in “Fire and Ash.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBailey Bass as Tsireya\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tBailey Bass returns as Tsireya, a member of the Metkayina tribe who also happens to be Tonowari and Ronal’s daughter. Tsireya is a love interest for Lo’ak and becomes a more emotional support system for him in “Fire and Ash” after the death of his older brother.\n\n\t“She’s strong, kind and I think people will see the beauty inside as well as the beauty outside,” Bass previously told Variety. “The first time I saw myself… she’s beautiful!”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFilip Geljo as Ao’nung\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFilip Geljo’s Aonung is Tonowari and Ronal’s son and Tsireya’s protective brother. While initially resistant to welcome the Sully family into the Metkayina, Ao’nung begins “Fire and Ash” viewing the Sully’s as allies.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDuane Evans Jr. as Rotxo\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDuane Evans Jr. stars as Roxto, a young male hunter and free-diver of the Metkayina who is best friends with Ao’nung.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCCH Pounder as Mo’at\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCCH Pounder returns very briefly as Mo’at, the Omaticaya’s spiritual leader and Neytiri’s mother. The Omaticaya village was destroyed in the original “Avatar” movie, forcing Mo’at and her remaining Na’vi villagers to seek shelter in the flying mountains.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJamie Flatters as Neteyam\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJamie Flatters’ Neteyam is the oldest son of Jake and Neytiri. He died during the climactic battle in “The Way of Water,” which pushes the Sully family into the depths of grief as “Fire and Ash” begins. Flatters reappears as Neteyam a few times in the new film as various characters tap into Eywa and can visit their late son in the spiritual realm.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to Choose Between Fiber and 5G Internet\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNew Zealand Just Made It Easier for Wealthy Americans to Buy a Home in the Country\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBlueprint Sports Ran $35M of NIL Money Through Nonprofit in 2024\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStephanie Phair Takes Up President Role at A.P.C.\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

In 2019, he was arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. While awaiting trial in New York City, he killed himself in his cell.\n      \n    \n          Donald Trump, Clinton and Bill Gates are among many high-profile politicians, entertainers, business titans, academics and other powerful international figures known to have been close associates of Epstein. Trump downplayed the importance of releasing the files this year -- despite making campaign promises to open up the investigation -- even saying he didn't want support from anyone who was demanding more about the case.\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

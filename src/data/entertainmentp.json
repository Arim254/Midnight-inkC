    "body": "\n\tMartin Bobb-Semple, the fast-rising British actor who recently nabbed a leading role in the upcoming “Tomb Raider” live-action series at Amazon MGM Studios, has signed with CAA. \n\n\tBobb-Semple was most recently seen as series regular Orlando “Lando” Johnson in “All American: Homecoming.” Starting out as a recurring character, he was upped to a series lead in season 3. Prior to that, he starred in two seasons of Peacock’s “One of Us is Lying,” and was a series lead in “Free Reign” for Netflix.\n\t\n\n\tBut the hotly-anticipated “Tomb Raider” — now in production — looks set to take the actor’s star to a new level. \n\n\n\tLed by Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, the show will see Bobb-Semple play Zip, one of Croft’s key allies and her trusted tech support and friend in a major, series-regular role. In the games, Zip works primarily from the security room in the main hall of Croft Manor, feeding Croft crucial information during her quests. \n\n\tBobb-Semple’s name was actually the first listed after Turner’s when Amazon formally announced the full cast lineup earlier this month, ahead of Jason Isaacs and Bill Paterson, also confirmed in canon roles. Other stars in the video game adaptation — created and written Phoebe Waller–Bridge, who will also serve as showrunner — include Sigourney Weaver, Celia Imrie, Jack Bannon and John Hefferman. \n\n\tBobb-Semple made his acting debut in production of “Oliver Twist” in London’s West End, before  training at the Identity School of Acting. From there, he later booked his first TV role at the BBC.\n\t\n\n\tHe will continue to be represented in the U.K. by Femi Oguns and Ikki El-Amriti at Identity Agency Group (IAG).\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Katie Pavlich launches her new 10 p.m. show on News Nation on Monday night, she will be taking on a unique competitor: the guy who gave her a start in the TV business.\n\n\tAt an earlier time, Pavlich, then working for the conservative site Townhall.com, was trying to network at an annual CPAC conference, and saw Fox News Channel host Greg Gutfeld and several associates.  As she moved closer to try and meet him in a crowded room, she overheard his group getting ready to leave, because it was hard to get a bartender’s attention. Pavlich saw an opportunity and vowed to get the group beers. As a result, she was invited to appear on “Red Eye,” a wee-hours program Gutfeld hosted between 2007 and 2015.\n\t\n\n\tNow she will be vying for audience at the same time Gutfeld hosts his eponymous program on Fox News Channel.\n\n\n\t“I run in my own race,” says Pavlich, during a recent interview, adding: “We are going to put on the best show we can every single night.”\n\n\tPavlich’s viewership isn’t likely to match Gutfeld’s. Fox News commands the biggest audience in cable news, but News Nation, owned by Nexstar Meida, is working to stay competitive. The network has overhauled its nighttime lineup by moving legal analyst and former attorney Jesse Weber into its 11 p.m. slot, preceded by Pavlich’s opinion-driven 10 p.m. hour. The schedule recalibration shows News Nation offering hours that aim more squarely at viewers who identify as liberal or conservative. Chris Cuomo, who tends to win favor among the blue-state crowd but can display a maverick streak, continues to anchor at 9 p.m.\n\t\n\n\t“NewsNation is the place where all are welcome…but tested. That’s why we are growing and that is what my show is all about,” says Cuomo. “I look forward to seeing how Katie and Jesse add to the mix.” On Tuesday, Pavlich will add something significant: an interview with President Donald Trump.\n\n\tExecutives hope the new anchors can lure new crowds. While News Nation’s viewership grew in 2025, its ratings are smaller compared to its more established rivals, which include Fox News, MS NOW and CNN. In 2025, News Nation captured an average of 108,000 viewers in primetime and 13,000 among viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most coveted by advertisers in news programming.\n\n\tWhile Cuomo and Pavlich have bona fides with specific audiences, Weber says he wants to be a news hound.  While 11 p.m. is often seen as the end of the day “the news is not slowing down at that hour,” says Weber, during a recent interview. “Some things are just ramping up. Ther are breaking stories, international stories. There’s an appetite for that,” says Weber. “We want to break down the big stories of the day” and help viewers plan for the day ahead.\n\n\tWith the debut of the new nighttime lineup, News Nation seems to be pivoting to specific viewer needs, rather than trying to deliver similar hours across the evening. Nexstar launched the network on the back of the cable network once known as WGN America, which was an outgrowth of an era when “superstations” like Ted Turner’s TBS could serve as national outlets via cable. Nexstar’s pivot makes use of newsgathering from its dozens of stations across the country and rids itself of syndicated fare that carried substantial licensing fees.\n\n\tBoth Pavlich and Weber may be new to News Nation’s audience, but each already has cultivated a following. Weber, who will continue to work for Law & Crime and appeared on HLN, has followed true crime and legal cases for several outlets. Pavlich had been with Fox News as a contributor for years, appearing on “The Five,” the Fox Nation streaming service and other properties.\n\n\tWeber thinks his later hour gives him license to explore. “We are going to experiment and try a few different things. We really want to be on the pulse of what people care about in social media and what people are feeling,” he says, while vowing to give viewers a chance to get all sides of a story without “gotcha moments.”\n\t\n\n\tPavlich says she is also mindful of connecting to a wider crowd. “I love America and I love my country unabashedly,” she says, but expects to present different viewpoints on the topics of the day. “We want to have civil, cordial discussion that is not boring,” she adds. “I think there is a difference between fighting and vehement disagreement.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSinger Yulee Choi wasn’t the only one making her acting debut in the comedy “Food Truck: Stolen Love…and Moo Deng.” The viral pygmy hippo who charmed the world after she was born in 2024 also appears in a feature film for the first time in the Thai family movie.\n\n\tChoi, a Korean singer-songwriter and founder of SRP Entertainment, told the audience at a recent Variety Screening Series event that she wanted to make the jump into acting because “I love to learn.” When the producers learned she could speak Thai (she majored in Thai at university), they encouraged her to join the film. It co-stars popular Thai actor Mario Maurer along with comedian Jack Fanchan and rapper-actor Padung Songsang.\n\t\n\n\tHer song “After the Rain” is also heard in the film, and she explained in the Q&A how the song, which was released last year, ties in with “Food Truck.” \n\n\t“The ‘After the Rain’ song connects to this film and this story, and it’s very emotional,” Choi said. “The song talks about overcoming certain obstacles, like when the rain starts falling, the sky becomes clean and beautiful, so life is the same way.”\n\n\tChoi revealed that unfortunately she didn’t get to share any scenes with the young hippo. In the action comedy, she plays an actress making a movie on location who brings her son along on the shoot. When he suspects his biological father might be part of the production team, the boy stows away in the film’s catering truck and as the crew attempts to return him to his mother, they end up taking a detour to Moo Deng’s zoo — only for the petite hippo to also become a stowaway.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMoo Deng hides in a box in “Food Truck: Stolen Love…and Moo Deng.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Unfortunately, I haven’t seen the real Moo Deng in person. But seeing the film, I can feel how cute and charming Moo Deng is,” she said.\n\n\tWhen she first met up with the producers in Korea, she found the story funny and emotional, she said, “It connects a lot with my real life experiences as well.” Like the actress in the film, Choi is raising her children on her own.\n\n\t“That experience made me understand the character’s emotions and feel it more deeply,” she said.\n\n\tChoi said working with the children in the cast was a wonderful experience, since they were “so professional.” Thailand’s unpredictable weather, however, was another story, as the crew was dealing with both sudden downpours and heat.\n\n\t“So I just prayed before the shoot for, no heavy rain please today,” she laughed.\n\n\tWill Choi be returning to the screen amidst her busy music career? “I hope so!” she said. “Whenever I have an opportunity, I would love to.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tLaunched in 2023, few physical markets have come together so fast as Miami’s Content Americas. Attendance stood at 2,278 delegates in 2025. This year, all exhibition space has sold out. \n\n\tYet just as it has fast consolidated as the No. 1 international TV meet and mart for Latin America and U.S. Hispanic those regions – and global TV markets at large – have increasingly suffered radical turbulence and buffeting headwinds. \n\t\n\n\t“The market has really contracted. There’s fewer buyers and less willingness to take risks,” says Erik Barmack, at Wild Sheep Content. “These are convulsive times,” adds Ezequiel Olzanski at EO Media. Few would argue with either judgement. \n\n\n\t“If you were a production company with massive overhead or just getting started in production, it would be awfully difficult,” he adds. Some smaller more niche players in Latin America and the U.S. have indeed gone to the wall. Multiple projects in development have been pulled. Sales to free-to-air broadcasters have declined, according to distributors. \n\n\tContent Americas’ carefully curated 2026 conference will offer guidance in troubled times. The recipient at Content Americas with a honorary Rose d’Or Latino for career achievement, Oscar winner Juan José Campanella will deliver a keynote, speaking with the authority of a creative who has directed in Argentina (“The Secret in Their Eyes”), Spain (“Vientos de agua”) and the U.S. (“House,” “Law and Order”), working an independent (“Underdogs”) and for Paramount+ (“The Envoys”) and now Netflix (upcoming movie “Parque Lezama”). \n\t\n\n\tOf regional giants, Brazil’s Globo will host a Showcase drilling down on its telenovela strategies, Banijay a panel on its expansion in Latin America. CEO Darío Turovelzky will forseeably explain plans at his newly-fledged Telefé Studios, after local holding Televisión Litoral bought top Argentine broadcast network Telefe from Paramount-Skydance last October.\n\n\tContent Americas will also stage its now traditional and popular CoproPitch and Rose d’Or Latinos awards.   \n\n\tThe big question at Content Americas, however, looks set to repeat Mipcom’s: How to reinvent the international TV business? \n\n\t“These are convulsive times but also times to be active and creative. It is our clear goal and intention to be an active player, along with others in the international area, regarding the reconstruction of a damaged but still very alive industry, working on the creation of a new model for the industry towards stronger times to come,” says Olzanski. \n\n\tThis process, however, is already ongoing. \n\n\t10 takes on the how the international TV business is exploring new other paths, the likely main conversation driver at Content Americas 2026, which unspools as ever at the Hilton Miami Downtown, this year over Jan. 19-22.\n\n\tThe Crunch \n\n\t67 in the first half of 2022, global streamer first-run orders in Latin America halved to 32 same period 2025, according to Ampere Analysis. Outside Brazil, they may not recover in a very short term.\n\n\t“It’s still a very challenging market, driven, in part, by elements that are out of producers’ hands,” says Christian Gabela, at Gaumont USA. “The price of everything has gone up, including production costs, felt most acutely in Mexico where there is still not an incentive for television production in place. Also, we’re still going through highest-level industry consolidation– the Netflix, Skydance battle for WBD – and, at a Latin American level, changes in management teams. I anticipate there will be a let’s hold steady, wait and see approach until everything sort of shakes out,” he added.\n\n\tZig as Others Zag\n\n\tSo the tough have got going. Companies with stellar track records with global streamers have turned to the open market. Their new projects should drive new business announcements at Content Americas. And some companies zig as others zag. In Latin America, global streamers are moving very successfully into telenovelas, such as HBO Max Latin America’s first original novela, “Scars of Beauty,” a big Brazilian hit, and now “Madame Beja,” bowing Feb. 2. Both are just 40-episodes. Meanwhile Globo, still Latin America’s telenovela queen, announced at Mipcom succulent international standard length minis and series with, respectively, the BBC and Ron Leshem and Janeiro Studios. But Globo is also experimenting, returning to the “novelão,” “big novela” in literal translation, doubling down on melodrama, as in its biggest Content Americas bet, “Three Graces.” It is also partnering with L.A.-based international entertainment studio MFF & Co to reformat Globo mega hits for the U.S. market as English-language, multi-season series. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAddiction TV\n\n\tAnother big question is how fast Latin America will ramp up producing its own microdramas. In one of Content Americas’ earliest sessions on Tuesday, Omdia’s María Rua Aguete looks set to unveil could-you-show-that-slide-again? stats suggesting how microdrama daily minute watched on mobile devices is already overhauling most global streamers last quarter in parts of Latin America. Featuring impossible love between impossibly handsome leads, with regular soapy twists every 90 seconds, “with microdramas you’re not reinventing the wheel, you’re inventing a Gen Z telenovela,” says Caroline Servy at The Wit. So it’s logical that Latin America, a novela heartland, will not only see a microdrama feeding fever but take to a fish like water in producing them. Globo has already begun, for example. TelevisaUnivision’s ViX is integrating microdramas into its scaled AVOD/SVOD ecosystem, Rua Aguete notes.     \n\n\tWhile International Streamers Are Focusing on Local, Local Broadcasters Are Moving Ever More Into International \n\n\tEqually, once courted by producers for their international reach, one of streamers’ market focus, as they evolve towards traditional broadcasters, is ever more local. Olzanski, for example, is shaping potential streamer projects which are “local to and particularly strong in a market, because of their story or topic, IP, real-life origin, as in true crime, or has a great cast and talent from a territory.” Broadcasters, once far more local players, are being forced to become more international, forging cross-border co-productions to face off with higher-budget streaming fare. That is especially the case of Latin America.    \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThree Graces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThree Graces Courtesy of Globo\n\t\n\n\n\n\tConsider Very Carefully Where You Shoot\n\n\t“You need to look at territories where budgets make sense,” says Gaumont USA’s Gabela. “Spain is probably the prime example in the Spanish-speaking world for having successfully incentivized productions around the world to shoot there,” he notes. “Spain, alongside Colombia, Uruguay, and others, offer the opportunity to optimize budgets with soft monies that are critical to compensate the higher costs driven by inflation. We, at Gaumont USA, are considering shooting in these countries despite the stories taking place elsewhere – as are the streamers we’ve talked to.” One case in point: Gaumont USA and Argentina’s Mariano Cohn and Gaston Duprat (“Official Competition,” The Boss”) are adapting Argentine novel “Instructions on How to Rob a Supermarket,” by Haidu Kowsk, looking to set the project in Spain for narrative reasons and to secure the best budget and incentives possible. \n\t\n\n\tOr Look to Europe\n\n\t“The challenge with Latin America has always been that there are fewer strong, local broadcasters who can initiate co-productions in a similar manner that European broadcasters can do through co-productions. There’s fewer options to form partnerships, which makes alternatives to the streamers more challenging,” says Barmack. So many Latin American players at Content Americas will be looking to Europe, especially in meetings with Spanish players, out in force in Miami. Olzanski, just arriving from meetings in Madrid, says he is pursing an “older traditional model of co-production that has naturally become the actual future model,”  including different windows and territories and taking in “organic Spain-Latin America” partnerships.\n\n\tSoccertainment\n\n\tPlayers are also tapping into the world’s global events and passions, such as soccer and the 2026 FIFA World Cup, held in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Gaumont USA and Netflix are finalizing post-production on the Diego Luna-headed “Mexico 86,” on the country’s long-shot bid to host the 1986 Cup. Barmack’s Wild Sheep Content is co-producing “Raza Brava,” about Chilean soccer-club Colo Colo’s rabid fan group, selected at the upcoming 2026 Berlinale Series Market Selects. And “Pioneers,” about Argentina’s first women’s national team which trounced England at a little known female World Cup in Mexico in 1971, looks like a potential standout at Content Americas’ CoPro Pitch, held on Tuesday. “These types of national events act as a type of IP we can mine to bring about entertaining stories that have relevancy and parallels to what is transpiring today – the return of the World Cup to Mexico in 2026,” says Gabela.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRaza Brava\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Mediapro\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOr Explore New Trade Routes\n\n\tFor his part, Barmack is targeting a model of “premium series that we think can travel from small markets,” made with directors and writers who punch above their weight and who don’t get the looks that, say, Mexico or France and Germany get,” he says. “Raza Brava,” for example, is showrun by Chile’s Hernán Caffiero, who scored an Intl. Emmy Award for “The Suspended Mourning.” “Chilean filmmakers are taking slightly bigger risks than a lot of other parts of Latin America and doing very high quality productions on low budgets that are allowing them to get made and then hopefully get distribution around the world,” he adds. \n\t\n\n\tBrazil Leads the Way for Global Streamers\n\n\tFor global streamers, “Brazil has currently most momentum in Latin America,” says The Wit’s Caroline Servy. Global streamer orders doubled from 7 in 2H 2024 to 14 in 1H 2025 in Brazil, according to Ampere Analysis. HBO Max’s “Scars of Beauty,” a major hit, and its upcoming “Madame Beja” last just 40-episodes. Netflix’s hybrid novela/series“Desperate Lies,” a global non-English No. 1 in 2024, came in at just 17. “In telenovelas, global streamers have made major recent moves, shortening formats,” says Caroline Servy at the Wit. “Brazil is building the biggest in terms of production volume with true crime drama the big, big thing for streamers. A significant number of recent streamer productions in Brazil have also proved hits,” she adds, citing Netflix Brazil betting thriller “Rulers of Fortune,” a non-English global No 1 over Nov. 3-9, and Prime Video’s event true crime “Tremembé,” tracking the inmates of a prison for celebrity criminals.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMarina Ruy Barbosa in “Tremembé”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Prime Video Brazil\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBlue Sky Crime Still Flourishes \n\n\tSome things aren’t changing. In such an alarming real world, post-pandemic blue sky entertainment shows little sense of dimming. Three of the six Copro Pitch finalists to be pitched on Tuesday – “Dr. Sex,” “José Piedra, a Guy With Bad Luck” and “Sexorcism” – are feel-good second-chance comedies or dramedies. Another example, 2026 Rose d’Or Latino contender “Until You Burn” delivers a Netflix/Caracol blue sky Caribbean rendering of “I Spit on Your Graves,” a Boris Vian 1946 bestseller so dark that it was used by a French killer to explain what he felt when he murdered his mistress. Some of its origin’s acidic wash remains in a scathing put-down of city elite racism and its nuanced view of character. But this is sugar-candy coated by gorgeous leads, Caribbean blue sky, waterfront high-rise apartments and chic clubs. Vian’s novel ends with his Black anti-hero lynched, his erect penis hanging out of his pants; “Until You Burn” climaxes as a tale of belated female empowerment.    \n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter Paramount’s 2023 “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” featured Peru extensively, interest in the South American country spiked, particularly in the ancient citadel of Machu Picchu, the colonial city of Cusco and the Peruvian Amazon, which formed key backdrops to the latest in the franchise. But Peru is keen to show off its lesser known and much underrated sites.  \n\n\t“Machu Picchu is one of our flagship attractions, but it is not the only one. We have many other outstanding destinations: Arequipa, of course, but also Kuélap and Ayacucho, among others. What we are seeking is diversification, and promoting Peru as a filming destination plays a key role in helping us diversify and showcase the richness of our country beyond a single site,” says Maria del Sol Velasquez, director of Peru’s tourism body, PromPeru, which remains the country’s de facto film commission.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tColca Valley, Arequipa. Courtesy of PromPeru\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t© Trailer Films\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe filming of “Transformers” here had a significant impact, as it led— for the first time— to the creation of a multisectoral working group aimed at analyzing and proposing state-led measures to encourage foreign investment in film production within Peruvian territory,” says Erika Chavez, head of the culture ministry’s audiovisual directorate, DAFO.\n\n\n\t“This initiative was convened by the Ministry of Economy and Finance itself, thereby placing—for the first time—public dialogue on the agenda to strengthen policies that promote the film industry. As a result of this executive working group, various strategies were proposed, such as the creation of a Film Commission and a tax incentive law,” she adds.\n\t\n\n\tThe most immediate result of having “Transformers” shoot in Peru was the introduction of ATA, a new visa aimed at facilitating the entry of talent and crew.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe new film law includes a tax incentive similar to Colombia’s transferable tax credit, CINA, that has been tapped by international producers with increasing success. Known by its acronym CIPA, Peru’s Certificate of Investment in Audiovisual Production covers broader investment in production assets and services tied to producing an audiovisual project in Peru.\n\n\tThe new law will become operative once implementing regulations are ironed out this year. Some possible tweaks to it could still see changes to the final draft.\n\n\tIssued by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the CIPA can be used by producers to reduce their corporate income tax or Value Added Tax by up to 50%. They also have the option to transfer or sell their CIPAs if they don’t need the full credit.\n\n\tSays Velasquez: “We have formed working groups together with the Ministry of Culture and the private sector, precisely to determine which economic incentives would be best adapted to the reality of our country.” Their ultimate objective is to streamline the administrative and logistical process for location shoots.\n\n\t“What we’re looking for is to attract international productions, whether they are cinema, television, series, advertising, music videos, etc., with the specific goal of increasing the flow of foreign tourism and help us to showcase a country that interacts between culture, tradition and modernity as well,” Velasquez points out.\n\n\t“Lately, more European productions have been filming in Peru,” notes local producer Bruno Canale of Apu Prods., reflecting on the current slump in Hollywood. He provided production services to “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” as well as Paramount’s “Dora and the Lost City of Gold” in Peru but his most recent work has been with Germany’s Komplizen Films’ “Years With You” (“Die Jahre mit der”) with actress Jella Haase (Netflix’s “Kleo”) and high-end travel adventure company Belmond’s campaign for its Andean Explorer luxury train, among others.\n\n\tLocal film production, a bellwether on how prepared a country is to provide infrastructure in terms of equipment, crew and talent, continues at a healthy clip, spurred by state funds – albeit limited – that cover projects from their development and production to their distribution, marketing and even restoration. Last year, 79 films were produced, down from the peak of 96 the year prior but still within the average tally of the last five years.\n\t\n\n\t“Peruvian cinema is not yet an industry, mainly because it lacks sufficient film laws necessary for its integration and development compared to other countries in the region. However, it has grown significantly, above all thanks to private efforts,” says Miguel Valladares of Tondero Films, which has produced seven out of the 10 biggest local box office hits in Peru, led by its “Asu mare” franchise.  \n\n\t“Last year, more than 50 Peruvian films were released, including both feature films and documentaries. Unfortunately, not all of them can be distributed in the best way, and there is increasingly less space to compete with major international blockbusters. I remember that last year, in a single week, there were seven Peruvian films showing in theaters at the same time—this is a record never before seen in Peruvian cinema,” he points out. \n\n\tAmong the top films of 2025, Barbara Mori Lima-set culinary drama “Mistura,” which ranks third after historical action thriller “Chavín de Huántar: The Rescue of the Century” and road movie comedy “Single, Married, Widowed, Divorced 2,” is in talks for U.S. distribution. All three account for 77% of last year’s box office.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRicardo de Montreuil’s Lima-set culinary drama ‘Mistura’ is closing a U.S. distribution deal. Courtesy of Seine Pictures. \n\t\n\n\n\n\tTondero has lately gone back to its roots in musical theater and stand-up comedy, given the current dip in movie-going. “Attendance at live shows is currently stronger than attendance at movie theaters, so this year we will diversify across both markets, unlike in previous years,” says Valladares. Among its live shows in development are local adaptations of musicals “Mrs. Doubtfire: The Musical” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch.” Tondero is even planning an unprecedented live immersive experience tied to its upcoming movie, the vigilante thriller “La gran sangre,” which starts shooting in April.\n\n\tValladares doubts that the current film law, as it stands, will suffice to sustain local film production. “Film laws always help improve things. Unfortunately, this new law tries to improve only certain aspects, leaving aside the entire universe of Peruvian cinema, especially regional cinema.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tInternational sales agency Pluto Film has picked up Paul Negoescu’s “Atlas of the Universe,” which explores the fragile shift from childhood innocence to early independence. The Romanian-Bulgarian co-production is set for its world premiere in the Berlinale’s Generation K+ program.\n\n\t“Atlas of the Universe” is a road movie following 10-year-old Filip (played by Matei Donciu), who sets off across the countryside after accidentally buying two right foot shoes. “What begins as a simple mission becomes an unexpected journey of courage, persistence, friendship and self discovery,” Pluto said.\n\t\n\n\tThe film is produced by Radu Stancu and Ioana Lascar of deFilm and written by Mihai Mincan and Negoescu.\n\n\n\tNegoescu said the film “is a story about loneliness and the courage to solve problems on your own. These are feelings I know very well, and they are what first drew me to Mihai’s story. We tried to bring these emotions to the surface in a simple and understated way, without explicitly pointing them out. Matei’s personality and talent were essential in this process. His performance as Filip brings to life a character shaped by all these emotions. I believe he allows the audience to resonate with Filip and to feel everything he goes through.”\n\n\tBesides Donciu, the film also stars Johanna Mild Keresztúri, Marius Mǎrginean, Sofia Marinescu, Andreea Grǎmoșteanu, Marin Grigore, Cǎlin Petru and Andrei Mateiu. The director of photography is Ana Drǎghici, with Mihai Codleanu responsible for the editing, and Marius Leftǎrache arranging the sound design and music.\n\t\n\n\t“What gives ‘Atlas of the Universe’ its international resonance is a universal truth: every child must navigate that defining moment between shame and courage,” Pluto managing director Daniela Cölle said. “It’s rare to see a film portray the transition from innocence to independence with such honesty. Filip’s adventure is deeply personal yet universally recognisable, offering a fresh and contemporary lens on what it means to grow up. With its tender humor, genuine emotion and unexpected friendship, this film reaffirms the importance and enduring power of children’s stories.”\n\n\t“Producing films for young audiences has long been a personal ambition,” Stancu said. “I strongly believe there is a real need for films that speak to children and teenagers with artistic integrity, emotional honesty and cultural meaningfulness. Through such projects as these, that respect their intelligence, we hope to contribute to the healthy cultural development of young audiences. Going forward, we aim for deFilm to develop and produce a strong, artistically ambitious project for young viewers every two to three years, as a long term commitment to this essential and often underserved cinematic space.”\n\n\tNegoescu’s short films premiered at major festivals including Cannes, Berlin, Karlovy Vary and Rotterdam. Two of them were nominated for the European Film Awards. His feature debut, “A Month in Thailand,” premiered in Venice. “Two Lottery Tickets” became one of the most successful Romanian films at the box office and was released internationally after being received well by critics and festivals – which led to a sequel, “Lottery Tickets Too.”\n\n\t“Atlas of the Universe” is produced by deFilm of Romania, in co-production with Screening Emotions of Bulgaria and Avanpost Media of Romania. The production is supported by the Romanian Film Center, Romanian Government – OFIC, Eurimages – Council of Europe, the Bulgarian National Film Center, Magic Lab, CinemaCity, Magic Shop, Romanian Television and Upfar Argoa.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere’s more to Peru than Machu Picchu, Cusco and the Nazca Lines. Indeed, the Andean city and region of Arequipa reveal a surprising wealth of lesser-known but equally compelling locations.\n\n\tThe Arequipa capital is known as the “White City” due to the bleached volcanic sillar stone that has been widely used to construct its churches and colonial buildings. It is also the birthplace of Peru’s literary giant, Nobel Laureate Mario Vargas Llosa.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPlaza de Armas, Arequipa City\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFernando López / PROMPERÚ\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAside from its elegant square dominated by a Baroque cathedral, a must-see is the sprawling Monastery of Santa Catalina, built in 1579, set against volcanos in the horizon. The region of Arequipa is also known as the alpaca capital of the world. One is bound to spot several herds along the roadside, including those of other camelids: vicuñas, which yield a finer wool than alpaca, guanacos and llamas.\n\n\n\tA roughly three-hour drive from the city is Colca Canyon, said to be as deep or even deeper than the Grand Canyon. Also further afield is the surreal petrified forest of Puruña and the Pillones waterfalls.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCondors, Colca Canyon. Credit: Mauricio Gamboa\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThese sites have lured some location shoots through the years, both local and international. Hopefully, efforts by the government and its de facto film commission PromPeru will spur more filmmaking in the area.\n\n\tA visit to Arequipa begins in Lima, the only South American capital with a sea coast, from which frequent flights take off for Arequipa and the rest of the country. This vibrant metropolis boasts a record four restaurants in the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list compiled by William Reed Ltd., with Amazonian-Nikkei inspired Maido ranking number one in 2025. In 2023, Central, led by chef Virgilio Martinez, sat atop the annual list and is now in the coveted Best of the Best category.\n\t\n\n\tAside from being a culinary destination, Lima offers filmmakers a rare duality: a contemporary capital layered directly over one of South America’s most fascinating colonial-era underground burial systems. Beneath the historic center, the catacombs of the San Francisco Monastery form a labyrinth of vaulted brick corridors, artfully-stacked bones and low, directional light that create an immediate sense of mystery and historical weight. The adjacent convent houses a library of precious antique books in various languages.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLibrary, San Francisco Convent, Lima\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJosé Orihuela / PROMPERÚ\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAbove ground, Lima’s colonial architecture, narrow streets, diffused coastal light from its so-called panza de burro skies (donkey’s belly), provide a visual contrast. The catacombs’ textures, symmetry and natural chiaroscuro lighting make it well suited to historical dramas, psychological thrillers, mystery narratives, horror and stylized documentary sequences.\n\n\tHere are 10 Film Friendly Locations in Arequipa:\n\n\tAbandoned Train Stations (“Tambos”) — Pampa de Arrieros, Cañahuas, SumbayThese cinematic ruins of a bygone industrial era are scattered across wide, high-altitude plains, offering filmmakers a striking combination of weathered industrial architecture, vast skies and profound isolation. Their remote settings suggest an atmosphere of stillness and suspense. Near Sumbay, ancient rock art shelters introduce an added layer of archaeological and cultural depth, while the windswept expanses surrounding Cañahuas heighten the sense of exposure and timelessness. The Pampa de Arrieros is a ghost town that was abandoned for two decades but has had some locals building their second homes. The raw textures and natural decay of these locations provide production-ready visuals with minimal set dressing required. They’re particularly compelling for neo-Western storytelling, dystopian futures, road-driven narratives and restrained, minimalist thrillers.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPampa de Arrieros, Credit: Mauricio Gamboa\n\t\n\n\n\n\tArequipa City: Downtown, San Lázaro\n\n\tJust a quick 1.5-hour flight from Lima, the White City boasts urban colonial backdrops against a volcanic skyline. A number of documentary and fiction productions have shot here given its sound infrastructure of hotels, restaurants among other amenities. The gateway to the Andes, its historic center features European-influenced facades, narrow lanes and archways, making it an ideal setting for period films or series. The San Lázaro district is known for its labyrinthian alleyways and quiet stone courtyards as well as its proximity to the city center’s Plaza de Armas with its majestic cathedral and graceful fountain. The most recent local production in the city was the 2025 drama “Nanito” by Guillermo Fernández Cano, which took in the historic center, some of its traditional restaurants, the bridge Fierro de Arequipa which used to have trains pass over it and is now a cycling and pedestrian path, as well as the leafy residential neighborhood of Vallecito.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBarrio de San Lázaro\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Bryce / PROMPERÚ\n\t\n\n\n\n\tColca Canyon\n\n\tOne of the deepest canyons on the planet, said to be twice as deep as the Grand Canyon in some parts, the canyon delivers panoramic vistas, terraced valleys and remote Andean villages. This is also the habitat of the Andean condor, often seen gliding on thermal currents just above the canyon rim. Aside from documentaries, it served as a backdrop to 2013 Brazilian telenovela “Amor à Vida” from media giant Globo, which also tapped the White City, Cusco, Machu Picchu and Puno. The 2009 Peruvian-Belgian-German-Dutch co-production “Altiplano,” directed by Peter Brosens and Jessica Woodworth, made use of the high-altitude vistas of Colca Canyon and Puno to anchor the story about the impact of mining on a mountain village. It world premiered at Cannes’ Critics Week where it was well received and stars Peru’s Magaly Solier of Berlin Golden Bear winner “The Milk of Sorrow” alongside Jasmin Tabatabai and Olivier Gourmet. Lodges in the Colca valley feature hot springs heated by the volcanos.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSanta Catalina Monastery, Credit: Mauricio Gamboa\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMonastery of Santa Catalina\n\n\tSpanning 215,278 sq. ft (20,000 sq. meters), the 16th century monastery features vibrant blue and terracotta walls, cloisters, plazas and shadowy passageways, making for dramatic backdrops. It forms part of the city center which has been declared a UNESCO Heritage site. It served as a cloister for Dominican nuns and still houses a few of them today. From here and the city center, you can view three volcanos dominating the horizon, among them the iconic Misti Volcano, which briefly appears in Episode 5 of Netflix’s “3 Body Problem.” Still active, it is considered the symbol of Arequipa and towers 19,297 ft (5,822 meters). Among local filmmakers, Miguel Barreda has shot several times in Arequipa. He shot the biopic “Ana de los Angeles” in the monastery, recreating 17th century Arequipa and recounting the most important episodes in the life of canonized Peruvian nun, Saint Ana de los Ángeles Monteagudo.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“3 Body Problem,” Misti Volcano, Courtesy of Netflix © 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPampa Cañahuas & Toccra Swamp\n\n\tLocated within the Salinas and Aguada Blanca National Reserve, these expansive high plains form a rare wildlife corridor defined by vast open terrain, high-altitude wetlands and cloud-draped horizons. The landscape combines tundra-like textures with wildlife movement, offering a sense of quiet scale and atmospheric realism. The area is home to vicuñas, a protected species, and a healthy wetland ecosystem, and is also populated by rarely seen guanacos – adding a unique and authentic wildlife element seldom captured on camera. The shifting light and weather patterns create naturally moody conditions well suited to subtle, contemplative storytelling. It’s tailor-made for nature documentaries, contemplative cinema and commercial spots requiring open, pristine landscapes.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tVicuñas and Misti Volcano, Credit: Mauricio Gamboa\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPuruña Stone Forest, Pillones Waterfalls\n\n\tA surreal landscape apt for fantasy and genre projects, the Puruña stone forest, a two to three-hour drive from Arequipa city, offers a small-scale version of Turkey’s Cappadocia and its otherworldly rock formations. It is easily accessible from the main road. Given its altitude exceeding 13,146 ft (4,000-plus meters) above sea level, precautions need to be taken to guard against altitude sickness. Further afield, via a 45-min. drive and a short hike down a trail, are the Pillones waterfalls, which cascade over volcanic boulders and is surrounded by rocks shaped by the erosion of water and time. The raw isolated backdrop makes it ideal for alternative universes, creature features, prehistoric reenactments or music videos.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPuruña Stone Forest, Credit: Mauricio Gamboa\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Ruta del Sillar and Culebrillas Gorge, Petroglyphs\n\n\tSituated on the outskirts of Arequipa city, the Ruta del Sillar (Sillar Route) is a quarry that provides a look on how the volcanic sillar stone has been extracted for generations to build most of the White City’s structures, including its cathedral and monastery. It includes a massive carved wall that is reminiscent of the entrance to Petra in Jordan. The nearby Culebrillas, an untouched quarry, offers a short walk through a narrow water-sculpted gorge that bears a collection of petroglyphs, prehistoric rock carvings made by the pre-Inca Wari civilization. Some documentaries have been shot here while Barreda, who has provided production services to German state-backed DW television and its reports, set his 2021 drama “La Cantera” (“The Quarry”) on this site.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRuta del Sillar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t© Enrique Castro-Mendívil / PROMPERÚ\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSalinas Lagoon\n\n\tSet against a mountain range and the Picchu Picchu volcano, the high-altitude salt lake of Salinas, roughly a two-hour drive from the White City or from Colca Valley, yields dramatic vistas all year round. The wet season from January to March sees the lagoon’s water create awe-inspiring mirror effects and attracts flamingos and other migratory birds, not unlike Bolivia’s Salar de Uyuni. During the dry season of April to December, the water evaporates to reveal the wide expanse of white salt. Aside from flamingos, it is home to llamas, alpacas and vicuñas. It is ideal for car commercials, surreal sequences, travel films, expansive sci-fi landscapes and photo shoots.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSalinas Lagoon, Credit: Mauricio Gamboa\n\t\n\n\n\n\tValley of the Volcanoes, Andagua\n\n\tThe Andagua Valley of the Volcanoes is one of the country’s most visually striking and unusual natural landscapes. The valley features more than 80 small cone volcanoes spread across a vast, arid terrain, creating a dramatic, lunar-like environment with a strong sense of scale and isolation. Formed millions of years ago by basaltic lava eruptions, these conical formations—known as hornitos—and the surrounding hardened lava flows offer raw textures and natural symmetry. The result is an unmistakably otherworldly setting that requires minimal visual enhancement, making it a production-ready location for bold, cinematic storytelling. Well suited for science fiction, fantasy, epic adventure and nature documentaries.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPatapampa Volcano, Credit: Mauricio Gamboa\n\t\n\n\n\n\tVolcano Lookouts\n\n\tArequipa’s dramatic geography offers filmmakers immediate access to sweeping panoramic viewpoints of its iconic volcanic trio—Misti, Chachani and Pichu Pichu. These natural lookouts deliver striking sunrise and sunset light, creating scale and grandeur ideal for powerful cinematic introductions. Drone filming is permitted with local authorization and the region has proven production credentials. Arequipa featured prominently in the History Channel’s 2023 documentary series “Extreme Andes,” a six-episode production following three Brazilian mountaineers across Peru’s volcanoes, with sequences filmed in the Andean regions—including Arequipa, especially the Coropuna volcano—as key natural settings. The lookouts are ideal for opening shots, character journeys, drone sequences and dramatic transitions.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLlamas and Alpacas with the Chachani Volcano in the horizon, Credit: Mauricio Gamboa\n\t\n\n\n",

(Scroll down for an exclusive look at the collector’s item).\n\n\t“We loved imagining Daisy Duck exploring our hometown of Copenhagen, capturing the energy of the city and the joy of discovering her own style along the way,” creative director of Ganni, Ditte Reffsgtrup, tells Variety. “For me, Daisy Duck represents curiosity, an optimistic outlook and bold self-expression – values that feel very close to Ganni and our global community.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe capsule spans ready-to-wear and accessories, refreshing Ganni signatures with comic-inspired graphics, richer seasonal hues and pops of green that trace Daisy Duck’s “spring awakening.” Denim anchors the assortment, alongside updated wardrobe staples and cult-favorite accessories — an approach that continues Ganni’s strategy of using recognizable IP to amplify its core categories without straying from its house codes.\n\n\tThe fanzine will debut via immersive takeovers in Copenhagen, New York and Seoul, each transforming a local magazine store and café with custom windows and newsstands, where guests can pick up the fanzine for free. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe accompanying campaign, shot by Esther Theaker and starring Lindsey Wixson, leans into fantasy-meets-fashion imagery, casting Daisy Duck as the ultimate style muse while maintaining Ganni’s offbeat, self-aware tone.\n\n\n\tThe Ganni x Disney Daisy Duck capsule launches Jan. 19 on ganni.com and in select Ganni stores.

    "body": "\n\tKirk Herbstreit usually describes Hail Mary passes when he sees them. In recent weeks, he’s been helping fans to throw them.\n\n\tThe ESPN and Amazon Prime Video sportscaster is part of a promotion from AT&T called “Clutch Calls:” that helps fans send messages to college football players, with some of the shout-outs featured on social media. “These athletes are obviously incredibly busy. They play this sport year round,” notes Herbstreit during a recent interview. “They want to stay connected with their family and with their friends.” \n\t\n\n\tThe telecommunications giant will be on hand to tout the promotion Monday night as Miami’s Hurricanes try to tackle Indiana’s Hoosiers. \n\n\n\tThe popularity of college football continues to increase, and the simple fact is that broadcast TV’s Saturday-night schedule is largely filled with college gridiron. And because college football attract fans both young and old, says Herbstreit, advertisers are willing to consider reaching them through both traditional and digital media.\n\n\t It’s no longer just kind of the mainstream media,” he says. “Social media is usually part of the deal. It’s usually not one or the other. A lot of times it’s both.” AT&T has long proven itself willing to experiment with new forms of reaching consumers, which have ranged from a sponsorship of “American Idol” on Fox that had fans use mobile phones to express their support of contestants to an early version of what is now being called “microcontent,” a social-media series called @SummerBreak that followed kids who had just graduated high school during their last summer at home.\n\t\n\n\tHerbstreit has some experience interacting with younger consumers. He travels regularly to college campuses for ESPN’s “College GameDay,” a mainstay Saturday-afternoon offering from the Disney-backed network. “We may have, I don’t know, 15,000 people around our set, many of which are college-aged kids who are just excited about their team.” He likes to stroll the campus with his two-year-old golden retriever, Peter and talk with passers-by. \n\n\t“He’s almost becoming a national mascot,” he says of his pet. “People start crying sometimes when they see him. It’s the most crazy phenomenon I’ve ever encountered.” But it’s also “a chance for him to see his fans and take pictures. \n\n\tHe’s not sure there will be any immediate need for him to facilitate an AT&T “Clutch Call” on Monday, but he’s certainly willing to help if asked. ” I have a son right now at the University of Michigan, so I can relate to wanting to connect with loved ones,” he says. ” I think it’s always important to be able to do that.”\n",

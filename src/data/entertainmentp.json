The fact is that these characters are all immigrants, but I think a lot of them would probably be Trump supporters, oddly enough. So how do they reconcile those things? When Italians came over – and people forget this, or they don’t want to see it – a lot of them were undocumented.”\n\t\n\n\tImperioli starred as Christopher Moltisanti in all 86 episodes of “The Sopranos,” which ran for six seasons from 1999 to 2007 on HBO. Widely considered to be one of the best television dramas of all time, the show earned 21 Emmy Awards during its run, including three best actor wins for the late James Gandolfini. Imperioli was nominated at the Emmys four times and won once for best supporting actor in a drama.\n\n\n\t“The Sopranos” creator David Chase told the New York Times in 2019 that he thought Gandolfini’s Tony Soprano would not be charmed by Trump.\n\n\t“He would think the guy was full of [expletive],” he said. “Whether he thought he was a good president or not — I don’t know that Tony thought much about that question at all, with anybody who was in office. But I know Tony would have thought Trump was penny-ante, in terms of his lying and presentation.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tWillie Colón, a legendary salsa musician who played a pivotal role in the Nuyorican salsa movement, died Saturday, his family confirmed in a statement posted to his Facebook account. He was 75. \n\n\t“It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved husband, father and renowned musician, Willie Colón. He passed away peacefully this morning, surrounded by his loving family,” the statement reads. “While we grieve his absence, we also rejoice in the timeless gift of his music and the cherished memories he created that will live on forever.”\n\t\n\n\tThe statement continued: “Our family is deeply grateful for your prayers and support during this time of mourning. We kindly ask for privacy as we navigate our grief.” \n\n\n\tBorn on April 28, 1950, in the South Bronx neighborhood of New York City, Colón began his career with his first album, “El Malo,” recorded with vocalist Héctor Lavoe at just 16 years old. The two went on to form a salsa duo on the Fania record label and have been credited with revolutionizing Latin music as a genre; in 1969, their song “Che Ché Colé” is regarded as an especially pivotal moment. \n\n\tAlongside Lavoe, orchestrations by Colón popularized songs like “Calle Luna, calle Sol,” “Abuelita,” “Ah, ah, oh, no,” “Ghana’e,” “El día de mi suerte,” “La murga” and “Juana Peña,” among others. Following the pair’s partnership, Colón launched his singing career in the late 1970s with albums including “The Good, the Bad, the Ugly” in 1976 and “Solo” in 1988. His discography includes more than 40 albums. \n\t\n\n\tColón earned nine gold records and five platinum records over the course of his career, selling more than eight million records worldwide. The musician also collaborated with other artists, including Rubén Blades and Celia Cruz. He was nominated for eight Grammy Awards in the tropical music category. \n\n\tIn addition to his prowess as a musician, Colón was also an avid sociopolitical activist, lending his voice to endorse New York politicians and on the stages of Latino neighborhoods. The musician also made appearances in a range of film and television productions, including “Vigilante,” “The Last Fight,” “Salsa,” “Miami Vice” and “La Intrusa.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Trump took to Truth Social on Saturday to demand that Netflix “immediately” fire former UN ambassador and board member Susan Rice or “pay the consequences.” His comments come as the streaming giant is in the midst of trying to seal a deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery’s studios and streaming businesses for $83 billion.\n\n\t“Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences,” Trump wrote. “She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what??? Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT.”\n\t\n\n\tNetflix did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.\n\n\n\tTrump’s outrage stems from Rice’s comments on Preet Bharara’s “Stay Tuned with Preet” podcast. During her interview, Rice said that if Democrats win the midterm elections, she predicts an “accountability agenda” for corporations that skirted regulations under the Trump administration.\n\n\tRice said, “If these corporations think that the Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to, you know, play by the old rules, and, you know, say, ‘Oh, never mind. We’ll forgive you for all the people you fired, all the policies and principles you’ve violated, all, you know, the laws you’ve skirted.’ I think they’ve got another thing coming.”\n\n\tIn his Truth Social post, Trump linked to an X post from far-right activst Larua Loomer, who wrote that Rice is “threatening half of the country with weaponized government political retribution.” She also forecast that if Netflix is allowed to acquire Warner Bros., “positive messaging of the Democrats’ upcoming witch hunts against Trump from Barack Hussein Obama and his anti-White racist wife Michelle would likely be blasted across all streaming services.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Netflix-Warner Bros. merger would result in a streaming monopoly, which the Obamas will have a significant stake in,” she added. “President Trump must kill the Netflix-Warner Bros. merger now.”\n\n\tIn early February, Trump told NBC that he thought he “shouldn’t be involved” with the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal, but he seems to have reversed that position.\n\n\t“I must say, I guess I’m considered to be a very strong president. I’ve been called by both sides. It’s the two sides, but I’ve decided I shouldn’t be involved. The Justice Department will handle it,” Trump said at the time, per an NBC News transcript.\n\n\tNetflix has an agreement to acquire Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max in a transaction worth $83 billion. On Feb. 17, WBD opened a seven-day negotiation period during which Paramount Skydance, which has been waging a hostile-takeover effort, can make a final push to pull together a stronger offer. On March 20, Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders are scheduled to vote on the Netflix acquisition.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“American Psycho” is one of the most iconic titles to have come out in the year 2000 — which might be why several actors have been hesitant to step into the role of the homicidal banker Patrick Bateman. \n\n\t“A couple of high-profile actors, whom I can’t name, have turned it down,” said “American Psycho” author Bret Easton Ellis on his podcast while giving an update on the casting process for the novel’s forthcoming Luca Guadagnino-directed film adaptation. “I think maybe because they don’t want to be in the shoes of Christian Bale.”\n\t\n\n\tBased on Ellis’ 1991 novel, Bale originated the role of Bateman more than 25 years ago. In the time since, his take on the character has become a fixture of fascination in pop culture, spawning a countless number of halloween costumes, memes and commentary. \n\n\n\tEllis also added that the reimagined “American Psycho” has since gotten a completely new script, written by Scott Z. Burns, since the project was first announced in 2024 (and following passes from several not-to-be-named actors).  \n\n\t“From what I’m told, this movie is completely different from Mary Harron’s 2000 movie. It’s a completely different take, and going to bear no resemblance to that movie,” Ellis noted.\n\n\tPreviously rumored to be up for the part of Bateman were actors including “Elvis” star Austin Butler and “Wuthering Heights” lead Jacob Elordi. \n\n\tHarron’s “American Psycho,” which also starred Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Chloë Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto and Willem Dafoe, was a commercial success, grossing more than $34 million worldwide on a modest $7 million budget. \n\t\n\n\tGuadagnino’s version of the cult classic, for Lionsgate, will be produced by Frenesy Films and executive produced by Sam Pressman through his company Pressman Film.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAnother Bruce Springsteen tour on-sale; another bout of elation among those who procured tickets. Along with, of course, another round of debate over how easy it was or wasn’t to get those tickets… and another spate of hysteria about top ticket prices. So how much did they cost when they went on sale Saturday? \n\n\tThere was a bit of sticker shock for some when they logged into Ticketmaster over the weekend and were put into queues that sometimes backed up to over 100,000 wanna-be ticket buyers at a time, with a message to study on the app while they waited: “Tickets for this event have been priced in advance by the tour from $84.55 – $3,007.20, including service fees.” \n\t\n\n\tThat is some welcome transparency, and it gets out of the way early the horror some fans might feel if they went directly to the front rows after making their way through the line and saw that $3,007.20 pop-up window. The $84.55 bottom also sets up an impression for fans that at least some of the tickets will be set at working man’s prices. (The “priced by the tour” clause also counts as Ticketmaster signaling that it wishes to wash its hands a bit of where prices finally land.)\n\n\n\tOf course, in the end, a very tiny percentage of tickets were set at either those top or bottom price points, which makes it a challenge to wade through enough sections to get even a clue about what an average price might be. But over the course of a couple of hours of looking through the ticket offerings for Springsteen’s two L.A. Forum shows, and a side glance at some other cities, Variety was able to form some impressions.\n\t\n\n\tSpringsteen tours have tended to attract more attention for their cost than most in recent years, partly because some fans believe that he has a “man of the people” image that should mandate keeping costs for fans low, while others think it’s just fine if he charges something closer to a going rate, given how scalpers will make the lion’s share off outrageous prices if he leaves money on the table for the sake of optics. And, of course, many in Springsteen’s core demographic rarely buy tickets anymore and still complain about anything above 1985 prices… although no one can be blamed for having their eyes widen upon first exposure to the higher tiers here. (It’s not just boomers who balk, anyway; the onsale for Harry Styles’ upcoming residencies had some millennials at least as much in shock as any Bruce fan.)\n\n\tGenerally speaking, if you wanted a “good” seat — which we’ll define as on the floor or in the loge sections facing the stage — you should have expected to shell out in the $400-$1200 per-ticket range, at initial face value. \n\n\tHowever, there were some seats in the upper levels that many fans would consider perfectly acceptable for a high-demand show that went for around $130 (disappearing very quickly at that level) or $180. This was the sweet spot for fans on a budget who wanted to get in the building, be facing the stage and rely to a large extent on the big screens.\n\n\tOne thing to note: “dynamic” pricing did not seem to be in effect for the on-sale, contrary to what many fans were contending, at least in the initial hours. Prices for different rows seemed to be the same time when we visited them over time. Most of the best seats were identified as “platinum” tickets, which in the past has sometimes been identified as seats whose prices are subject to change, based on demand. But we didn’t see any immediate sign of prices going up or down, whether it was for platinum or “standard” seats. (That doesn’t count resale tickets, which of course began fluctuating immediately.) \n\n\tThe very first tickets to sell out were those in the GA section right in front of the stage, which takes up a relatively small part of the overall floor. Ticketmaster even warned those waiting in the queue that those were gone. Although Variety never got a chance to even look at those prices, fans reported the standing-room tickets were about $500, on par with what Springsteen has charged for that privileged area for years.\n\t\n\n\tThe only $87.55 tickets we spotted were in the last few rows of the area behind the stage… an awfully good price point if you have binoculars and want the same view the cover photographer for “Born in the USA” had (give or take a processional lap to a ramp at the rear of the stage that is likely to happen in any Springsteen show). Anything closer-up in the rear than those last few rows was more likely to run you anywhere from $130.35 to $306.60, the latter being the cost for a front-row seat in a rear-view section.\n\n\tThe sections that sold out most quickly — apart from the instant-sellout GA spots — were the front-facing loge sections, just off the floor. In the Kia Forum’s section 105, which is somewhat toward the rear of the arena but still offering a good, relatively head-on view, a ticket in row 1 cost $961.30 (labeled as a platinum ticket), while a seat in row 9 ran $423.96 (labeled a standard seat).\n\n\tOn the floor, a ticket in the very front rows cost $3007.20, as advertised. If you went back to the sixth row, they dropped to $2707.20. A seat in the front row of Section F, the second seated section back from GA, went for $1,147.20. Move back to row 5 of that section and it was $961.20. Go back on row 10, in the area of the mixing board, and seats dropped to $721.30. Seats in the very last rows of the floor, meanwhile, went for $423.95.\n\n\tIn the upper level, a.k.a. the 200s at the Forum, a typical seat was going for $308.80, including the row the very furthest distance from the stage (section 236, row 10). However, the back rows over in section 205 could be had for $187.95.\n\n\tSome seats in the front-facing 200s, a.k.a. the “nosebleeds,” did go for $128 — a bargain, by most modern standards. Those were all sold out by the time we got through the queue for the Forum shows, though. We were able to go look at other cities — Cleveland, for example (where SeatGeek was handling all the sales, including initial purchase, not Ticketmaster) — and see some $128 seats still on sale there as of Saturday afternoon.\n\n\tAre these fair prices? Springsteen fans will continue to debate that, as they have with other recent tours of his. One answer is that any of these prices will seem reasonable compared to what resellers will be asking for them, probably even at the uppermost level. Some industry observers have made the point that tickets for top-tier acts are underpriced, by the standard of actual supply and demand, if resellers can get more and that money doesn’t go into the pocket of the artist. But others argue that optics matter, which is why most superstar acts have recently been setting their top tickets closer to the $1200 level than $3000. Taylor Swift actually capped non-VIP-package tickets for the Eras Tour at $499, leaving rates above that to the scalpers — though you could argue she made it up in volume, in a way that a short tour like Springsteen’s never could. (And also that she has a lot more years ahead of her to make beaucoup concert bucks than the E Street Band, who are revving their engines to retirement age and beyond.)\n\t\n\n\tClearly, many fans look at high ticket prices and walk away. At one point in the Forum on-sale, the wait to get through the queue showed more than 100,000 potential buyers ahead in the line, but by the time we got past that massive line, there were still hundreds of tickets to be had, indicating most looked at what were available and walked away. (Or many were bots… take your pick.) \n\n\tBut in the end, Springsteen has one thing in his favor that the Eras Tour also did, even after scalpers tripled and quadrupled prices: Virtually no one who has attended one of his shows in recent years ever went online to complain after the fact that it wasn’t worth it, whatever “it” turned out to be. Especially, in the case of either of these three-hour-plus experiences, if you’re calculating value by the minute as well as sublimity.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMark Ruffalo fired back at James Cameron on Saturday morning after the “Avatar” director wrote in a letter to Senator Mike Lee, chair of the Senate subcommittee on antitrust, that Netflix buying Warner Bros. Discovery would be “disastrous for the theatrical motion picture business.”\n\n\t“So… the next question to Mr Cameron should be this,” Ruffalo wrote on Instagram Threads. “’Are you also against the monopolization that a Paramount acquisition would create? Or is it just that of Netflix?’”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “I think the answer would be very interesting for the film community to hear and one that should be asked immediately. Is Mike Lee against the Paramount sale as well? Is he as concerned about that as he is the Netflix sale? We all want to know. Speaking on behalf of hundreds of thousands of film makers world wide.”\n\n\n\tNetflix is currently poised to acquire Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max in a deal worth $83 billion. On Feb. 17, WB. opened a seven-day window during which Paramount Skydance can make a final push to pull together a superior offer. On March 20, Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders will vote on the Netflix acquisition.\n\n\tIn his letter to Sen. Lee, Cameron said if Netflix is allowed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, “Theaters will close. Fewer films will be made. The job losses will spiral.”\n\n\t“The business model of Netflix is directly at odds with the theatrical film production and exhibition business, which employs hundreds of thousands of Americans,” he added. “It is therefore directly at odds with the business model of the Warner Brothers movie division, one of the few remaining major movie studios.”\n\t\n\n\tIn a recent interview with Variety, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos doubled down on his “blood oath” that the Warner Bros. theatrical rollout strategy will “remain largely like it is today.”\n\n\tHe said, “Your listeners can watch us now, cut a finger and do a blood oath together.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSeveral interconnected vignettes make up “Chronicles From the Siege,” Abdallah Alkhatib’s harrowing, poignant, sometimes darkly hilarious dispatch from the frontlines of a violent blitz. The drama is shot with a documentarian’s eye and unfolds in the ruins of an unnamed city, but its setting is far from nebulous — not least because of the presence of a few Palestinian flags. The stories are drawn from various sources, including tales from Gaza in recent years, as well as Alkhatib’s own experiences under fire in the Yarmouk refugee camp for Palestinians in Damascus during the Syrian Civil War, which the Palestinian-Syrian filmmaker previously turned into the documentary “Little Palestine.”\n\t\n\n\tShot in Algeria and Jordan, Alkhatib’s follow-up (and first dramatic feature) poses intriguing questions, through both its form and content, about the utility of cinema during genocide. Can it ever be truly useful? If “Chronicles From the Siege” is anything to go by, then at the very least, the camera has the ability to re-humanize a people constantly demeaned and murdered, by framing them outside the immediate confines of their suffering, and by giving them ordinary problems to work through, albeit under extraordinary pressures that distort their sense of routine.\n\n\n\tThe situation is already dire when the story begins. In the film’s opening images, a handheld video camera captures numerous displaced Arab characters — men and women, young and old — gathered in a dilapidated town square as they scramble for scant rations tossed from the back of a truck. Alkhatib and cinematographer Talal Khoury quickly break away from this diegetic handycam (with which the film’s lens shares several aesthetic qualities, imbuing it with a pressing realism) and offer cinéma vérité glimpses at several characters who will be pushed to their breaking point in the subsequent 90 minutes.\n\t\n\n\tThe runtime covers what appears to be several days, but it’s hard to be sure. Time seems to collapse in on itself when bombs keep dropping overhead, and the act of trying to visit a next-door neighbor becomes a matter of life or death as sniper fire rains down. Even the wall clocks visible throughout the film — glimpsed over the shoulders of characters who express the psychological fissures of this siege, or stumble across poetry about the various Nakbas — all seem to have their clock hands stuck at about 7:30, no matter the time of day. Even as time marches on for Palestine and its displaced diaspora, things stay the same.\n\n\tThis flattening of time also ensures that each section bleeds seamlessly into the next, as we meet a troubled and hungry former video-store owner, the endearing Arafat (Nadeem Rimawi), scavenging for food and medicine in a mostly silent scene that sets the stage for the film’s visual approach. It’s low-lit, dim, and visually noisy, as though a rudimentary digital camera had been dropped into a war zone and picked up by an everyday citizen. And yet, these introductory scenes remain searingly cinematic, given Alkhatib’s intense focus on his actors’ eyes, and the differing ways they navigate desperation. It isn’t long before the digital static comes to embody the psychological fog brought on by living on a knife’s edge.\n\n\tArafat’s story dovetails into that of a group of young friends — three men and a woman, played by Samer Bisharat, Ahmad Kontar, Ahmed Zitouni and Saja Kilani — who take up temporary refuge inside his boarded-up store while in search of firewood, leading to a more dialogue-heavy sequence that breaks with the moroseness one might expect from recent films on Palestine. Although the quartet’s aim is survival, they end up trading universally relatable jabs about porn and masturbation, while gazing upon the many tapes and posters adoring the store walls, until they face a unique ethical dilemma: whether to use the movies to fuel a fire for warmth. Sentiment and pragmatism collide, in a hopeless reflection from Alkhatib on whether films, including the one we’re watching, can ever have material impact on survival. \n\n\tIn keeping with this theme of persistence, we next meet a meek, bespectacled man, Walid (Wassim Fedriche), who tries to trade an old refrigerator for a single cigarette puff from a cunning smuggler, Saleh (Idir Benaibouche), revealing an entire hustle culture born of hunger and despair. Although a shorter, snappier vignette, it’s one in which Alkhatib further implicates himself by playing an unsavory thief with whom you can’t help but empathize, even as he screws people over.\n\t\n\n\tThroughout the film, a resistance network can be heard helping and warning each other over walkie-talkies, but when we finally meet one of its members — the fiery, gun-toting Fares (Emad Azmi) — we’re met not with a tale of action and resilience, but a surprising sex comedy about premature ejaculation. Lest this seem too raunchy for such a serious backdrop, it’s also layered with questions of transactional intimacy for the sake of sustenance, as his girlfriend Huda (Maria Zreik) sneaks her way past artillery shelling for a seeming dessert-for-sex scheme that ends up both intense and jaw-droppingly funny.\n\n\tDespite its occasional levity, “Chronicles From the Siege” remains firmly grounded in surrounding dangers, as the thunderous sounds of dropping bombs frequently interrupt even the laugh-out-loud comedy. All of this culminates in a stunning sequence set in a rundown hospital, where the majority of the ensemble returns, and is forced into further moral dilemmas under the threat of oblivion, in a race-against-the-clock finale shot in enrapturing long takes. Learning about each character over the course of the film not only adds individual dimensions to each scenario (and thus, broadens the characters’ horizons beyond their victimhood), but it also deepens the overarching societal fabric.\n\n\tThis climactic collision is woven from several minor ethical tugs-of-war that rest on each character exhibiting both selfishness and altruism in various scenes, until their complicated humanity is placed under a harsh spotlight. The result is a particularly moving thematic conclusion nestled within the chaos: the innate understanding that each and every one of them, no matter who they are or what they’ve done, deserves to live.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBefore commencing the presentation of the Competition prizes, Berlin Film Festival jury president Wim Wenders began proceedings with a prepared statement, responding to the controversy that has blighted the festival since its opening-day press conference last week, in which he contentiously declared filmmakers to be “the counterweight of politics, we are the opposite of politics.”\n\n\tHe amended those words in a more nuanced and conciliatory manner tonight, declaring the languages of political activists and cinema artists to be distinct but complementary. His words came notably in the middle of a ceremony that honored several overtly political films, including Perspectives winner “Chronicles From a Siege,” by Palestinian-Syrian filmmaker Abdallah Alkhatib, whose speech lambasted the German government as “partners in the genocide of Gaza by Israel, but you choose not to care.” \n\t\n\n\tWenders’ own jury, meanwhile, went on to present awards to German-Turkish director Ilker Çatak’s “Yellow Letters,” about the Turkish government’s suppression of artistic protest, and Turkish director Emin Alper’s massacre study “Salvation,” which the filmmaker expressly declared an allegory for multiple global atrocities, including recent events in Palestine and Iran.\n\n\tWenders pointedly closed his statement by quoting a speech from last year’s Berlinale by Golden Bear honoree Tilda Swinton — one of over 100 film artists to sign an open letter this week criticizing Wenders and the Berlinale for their “silence” on Palestine.\n\n\tWenders’ full statement:\n\n\t“What is the common language at the Berlinale? How do we express ourselves apart from words about what we think and how we feel about the world — this beautiful, insanely complicated, terrifying, out-of-control world we live in now? It’s the language of cinema that this jury of people from seven countries had in common. It was the predominant language of the Berlinale for seven decades. It was always accompanied by the language of critics and journalists. A language of politics has also always been present, as Berlin always was, and still is, an enormously politicized place.\n\t\n\n\tAnd since we live in the 21st century, there is the language of the internet — a quick and fast worldwide language. Lately we observe a dispute over which language should have sovereignty of interpretation at this festival. Our language, cinema, is highly differentiated, and there are as many approaches to this language as there are filmmakers, and the one you saw already before us are part of them. What the works of most filmmakers have in common is compassion. In all 22 films we saw, this was the predominant attitude, and it will reflect strongly on all films that receive an award tonight. The language of cinema is empathetic. The language of social media is effective. \n\n\tWe need to talk about that artificial discrepancy that happens here in Berlin. Activists are fighting mainly on the internet for humanitarian causes — namely the dignity and protection of human life. These are our causes as well. As the Berlinale films clearly show, most of us filmmakers applaud you. All of us applaud you. You do necessary and courageous work. But does it need to be in competition with ours? Do our languages need to clash?\n\n\tOur tools are stories, faces, places, words, emotions. Our approaches can be critical, satirical, comical, dramatic, poetic, but will always be complex and complicated. Our most effective instrument is called in German — I love this word — “anschaul.” Difficult to translate in English: sort of a visual, sensual, existential immersion. But even if our languages are so different, we need each other: activists, friends of the suppressed, agitators against their suppressors. If we treat each other as allies, as different but complementary languages, our shared causes have a better chance to resist the ever-changing wind of consumption, of abstraction and over-saturation. \n\n\tLet us not discard or under-estimate each other’s reach and possibility. Cinema is more resistant to oblivion, and certainly longer-living than the short-lived attention span that the internet offers, while our urgency — no, your urgency — reaches places our films cannot. This should not be a competition. It’s a partnership. Tilda Swinton said something beautiful in her magnificent speech receiving the Golden Bear last year: ‘Being for something has not ever, ever implied being anti anyone else.” This is something so simple that it’s always easily overlooked.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story discusses spoilers for “How To Make A Killing,” now playing in theaters\n\n\tGrowing up with a father in the FBI, John Patton",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story discusses spoilers for “How To Make A Killing,” now playing in theaters\n\n\tGrowing up with a father in the FBI, John Patton Ford’s bedtime stories and dinner table conversations often involved criminals. That’s probably where his fascination with the world of crime originated. \n\n\t“There was always something really familiar about those things to me,” Ford tells Variety. “I grew up thinking of them as people, and not as bad guys in a movie.” \n\t\n\n\tBoth of Ford’s films deal with the immoral; the writer-director’s debut feature, “Emily the Criminal” focuses on a college graduate who, saddled with debt, becomes a dummy shopper in an elaborate credit card scam; his latest, “How To Make A Killing,” centers on the blue-collar Becket Redfellow (played by Glen Powell, the “hardest working guy in the business,” according to Ford), whose mother was disowned by her obscenely wealthy family when she got pregnant with him. In an effort to escape his ordinary life in New Jersey, Becket decides to kill off his seven relatives to claim a $28 billion inheritance.\n\n\n\tThe A24 movie is a loose reimagining of the black comedy “Kind Hearts and Coronets,” which Ford first watched back in 2012. “I was pretty stunned with how contemporary it was,” he says. “It’s a movie that came out in the U.K. in 1949, and yet it wrestles with issues that just seem so prescient. At what time wouldn’t this concept be relevant?” \n\n\t“How To Make A Killing” follows similar beats as its precursor; Becket succeeds in killing off each family member, falling for his deceased cousin’s girlfriend, Ruth (Jessica Henwick), in the process. In the end, he gets arrested and sentenced to death, not for any of the murders he actually committed, but instead after being framed by Julia (Margaret Qualley), his childhood crush and a modern-day femme fatale, for the murder of her husband. \n\t\n\n\tAs it turns out, Julia, who visits Becket in prison hours before his execution, actually has her late husband’s suicide note that would exonerate him — on the condition that he signs over his inheritance to her. Becket obliges.  \n\n\tWhat follows is where Ford’s take on the British crime film most differs from the source material. When Becket is released from prison, Ruth is waiting in the parking lot — but only to end things with him face to face. She leaves, revealing Julia, dressed in a funereal black Chanel set, waiting outside a chauffeured Rolls-Royce. Wordlessly, Becket goes to her, gets in the car and the two are driven back to the gargantuan Redfellow estate on Long Island, with tears in his eyes. Compare it to “Kind Hearts and Coronets,” where both women are sitting outside in their carriages (spoiler: the Becket of that film, Louis, chooses Sibella, the Julia, of his own volition). \n\n\t“For a modern audience, I don’t think anyone would have enjoyed Ruth standing by him after all of that,” says Henwick. “Ruth had to remove herself. It’s just too depressing.” \n\n\tWhile Becket ultimately evades justice in the traditional sense, Ruth’s exit leaves Becket a “totally disempowered man,” explains Henwick. “[Ruth] has taken away his option for joy, and Julia is not going to be the life that he actually wants. She’s going to be a terror, and she held his fate in his hands. So it’s his comeuppance.” \n\n\tFord agrees: “At the end of the movie, he gets what he always thought he wanted, but it’s too late, and now he knows he would have been better off with a different kind of life. So he gets his goal, but only after he realizes that he actually doesn’t want it. There’s an irony there that’s deliberate.” \n\n\tOriginally, Ford had a different, “way more severe” ending in mind. In the initial script, Becket gets out of jail with Ruth, who had given birth to their child while he was incarcerated, waiting for him. “He’s going towards her, and then he sees that Julia is there as well,” says Ford. “And in that moment, he changes his mind and decides to leave Ruth, leave the child, and go with Julia, because he realizes that’s who he really is after all this time.”  \n\n\tIt had to change for a few reasons — the most notable one being that Ford agreed it would’ve been “especially punishing for audiences” who’d spent the past hour and 45 minutes attempting to understand, and even sympathize, with Becket. That’s one of the perks of casting Powell, “a golden retriever of a human being,” to play a serial killer, says Ford: you want to root for him! \n\t\n\n\t“Glen is kind of an unlikely candidate to go and, like, kill eight people; he’s just irrepressibly good,” explains Ford. “He has the air of someone who is working really hard and working towards a goal. There’s a popular feeling that he’s working at being a movie star, and he’s on this Tom Cruise trajectory. And I thought, if it’s Glen, [the audience will] be like, ‘This guy thinks he’s doing the right thing. This guy is just trying to do his best.’ And the irony is that he has absolutely no moral or ethical code whatsoever.”\n\n\tBut that ending went a beat too far. “I think the studio was kind of freaked out,” Ford adds. “They were like, ‘You can’t have people sit through this entire movie and then punish them at that level.’”\n\n\tThough, as Henwick points out, Becket choosing Julia would’ve felt true to the character. “Is it really jaded and sad to say I think most people would make the same choice as him? When confronted with [Ruth] and her beat-up Honda, or Julia and her billions, I do think most people would go with Julia.” \n\n\tAnother reason for the change was that it would’ve left Becket entirely unscathed — out of jail, still a billionaire, still in love, or at least lust — rather than how it does end for him: free, rich, but doomed to a life devoid of meaning.  \n\n\t“I didn’t want to just completely let him off the hook and get away with everything,” says Ford. “And yet I didn’t want it to be totally punishing and one-dimensional. I wanted it to be complex. I wanted him to get something but lose something and have mixed feelings about it.” \n\n\tAnd in case anyone needs clarification, Becket’s tears as he’s back through the gates of the estate aren’t happy ones. “He will certainly come to regret things, but he may not admit it,” Ford confirms. “Or admit it to himself.”\n",

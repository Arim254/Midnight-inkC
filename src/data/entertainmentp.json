    "body": "\n\tGenerative AI is poised to reshape the supply of premium screen content, with VP of Chinese online media giant Tencent and CEO of Tencent Video Sun Zhonghuai forecasting that as much as a third of long-form film and animation could be “dominated by or deeply involving AI” within two years, despite lingering concerns around performance fidelity and visual consistency.\n\n\tSpeaking at a forum at the 7th Hainan Island International Film Festival (HIIFF) Sun predicted a dramatic shift in premium television and film content creation in the next few years.\n\t\n\n\t“From a time dimension, looking at the next one or two years, we have every reason to expect visible changes in the platform’s content supply structure,” Sun stated. “In core categories such as film, television, and animation, works dominated by or deeply involving AI could potentially reach a proportion of between 10 and 30%.”\n\n\n\tPointing to short form content, Sun concluded that the race has already been won by gen-AI products.\n\n\t“Short content is like fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), ruthlessly pursuing efficiency,” said Sun. “In this regard, the short dramas and short animations we know have already taken the lead, drastically lowering costs. We estimate that AI-native companies for short animations now account for nearly 30% of the market.”\n\n\tDespite the bullish forecast, several factors still remain obstacles for generative AI in long-form content, including the ability to maintain consistency and the inability to replicate human performances.\n\n\t“AI video technology still cannot resolve issues of visual consistency and controllability,” Sun explained. “With extended shot durations, the drifting of details in characters becomes very obvious.”\n\t\n\n\tSun also suggested that performances by human actors contained micro-expressions and micro-movements that could not be replicated by current generation AI, leaving gaps in emotional tension and subtlety.\n\n\tHe also noted that most mainstream AI-generated content is limited to 1080p HD resolution, which doesn’t match 4K, or DCI theatrical release standards.\n\n\tHowever, Sun emphasized that these hurdles are temporary and predicted that AI would allow filmmakers to revisit ambitious genres previously deemed too financially risky for studios to greenlight.\n\n\t“Genres that were ignored in the past due to market risks, such as grand Sci-Fi and grand ‘Age of Discovery’ narratives, will be revived with the cost reductions that AI offers,” said Sun.\n\n\tTo meet this future, Sun revealed that Tencent Video is aggressively integrating AI tools into its traditional workflows, stating that they were currently implementing AI in early stage concept design, pre-vis and rotoscoping. In LED virtual production, AI is being used to create the complex digital sets needed as background scenery.\n\n\tSun countered criticism that AI would lead to unemployment in the creative industries, stating that Tencent considered talent development a top priority at the company.\n\n\t“The talent model for future film production requires polymaths; in more vivid terms, we need art engineers or tech artists, and we have been working with top colleges and institutes to develop them,” said Sun.\n\n\t“We are actually very lucky to be able to experience a true Renaissance era in the film industry. The most exciting human experiences come when going through the process of uncertainty to certainty.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a wide-ranging conversation at the Singapore International Film Festival, acclaimed filmmaker Deepa Mehta reflected on her decades-long career, the controversies that have shadowed her most celebrated works, and her unwavering commitment to independent filmmaking.\n\n\tMehta was speaking with longtime collaborator Hussain Amarshi, head of Mongrel Media, which has distributed her films. She will receive a lifetime achievement honor from the festival, capping a year of retrospectives and accolades for the director known for her groundbreaking “Elements” trilogy.\n\t\n\n\t“For the first time these days, I’ve stopped being critical of all my work,” Mehta told the audience. “It’s not that I’m proud of it. I like it, which makes me feel good.”\n\n\n\tHer father, a film distributor in India, gave her advice that has guided her career: “There are two things in life. One is you’ll never know when you’ll die, and the other is you’ll never know how a film will be accepted.”\n\n\tAfter moving to Canada, Mehta’s 1991 feature debut “Sam & Me,” co-written with Ranjit Chowdhry, drew from her immigrant experience. The film’s success at Cannes opened doors, including a call from George Lucas, who hired her to direct an India-set episode of “The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles.”\n\n\tDespite Hollywood offers and working with Jessica Tandy on “Camilla,” Mehta chose independence. Martin Scorsese reinforced her decision at the Marrakesh Film Festival. “He said, ‘Don’t ever get tempted. Do your own stuff,'” she recalled.\n\n\tIn 1996, Mehta wrote and directed “Fire,” depicting a same-sex relationship between two women in an Indian household, which became the first Indian film to deal explicitly with lesbian relationships.\n\t\n\n\tShe had no idea the film would spark outrage. When it was released, theaters in Delhi were burned, and protests erupted across India with demonstrators insisting “there are no lesbians in India.” But a counter-protest moved her deeply. “As far as the eye could see, there were people, mostly women, carrying placards that said, ‘We are lesbians and we are Indians.’ And I thought, ‘How wonderful.'”\n\n\tFollowing “Fire” and “Earth” (1998), which became India’s Oscar submission, Mehta embarked on “Water” in 2000. The film about widows in 1930s India faced even more severe opposition.\n\n\tWhile location scouting in Varanasi for Lucas’s “Young Indiana Jones,” Mehta had encountered an elderly widow and followed her to a house full of widows — women of all ages with shaven heads wearing white sarees. “I’ve never seen a house of widows before, so that’s what inspired me to do water,” she said.\n\n\tOn the second day of shooting, with Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das already having shaved their heads for their roles, demonstrations erupted. Sets were thrown into the river and burned. Effigies of Mehta were set ablaze. Death threats followed. The police forced the production to shut down.\n\n\tThe experience fundamentally changed her relationship with her birthplace. On the Air France flight back to Toronto, “I put the seatbelt on and for the first time, I felt maybe I’m going home. I never thought of Canada as home till then.”\n\n\tFive years later, after her anger had dissipated, she remade “Water” in Sri Lanka. The film opened the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, became Canada’s Oscar submission, and received an Academy Award nomination for best foreign language film, as the international category was known then. \n\n\tMehta revealed that every script she’s written has been produced — a remarkable achievement in the film industry. She attributes much of her success to workshopping films extensively before shooting, a technique based on the ancient Indian Natya Shastra performance texts.\n\n\t“For two weeks or 10 days of workshopping really helps me, because when you see the various ways it can be enacted, you understand what works for you,” she explained.\n\n\tMehta’s next project is “Forgiveness,” based on Mark Sakamoto’s book about Japanese-Canadian citizens sent to internment camps during World War II while Sakamoto’s white Canadian grandfather became a prisoner of war in Japan. “It’s about, can we ever forgive what has happened to us, and why is it so difficult?” she said.\n\t\n\n\tReflecting on the current state of cinema, she expressed concern about political pressures in Hollywood and Bollywood. “The climate of films is really changing,” she observed. “We are compromised before we start.”\n\n\tBut she remains hopeful about independent filmmaking. “I think best is to make small independent films,” she advised young filmmakers. “Write your own story. Find the right way to tell the story within a budget that is feasible. Independence, independence, absolutely independence, especially when you’re starting out.”\n\n\tMehta cited influences including Satyajit Ray, Kurosawa Akira, and recently discovered Masaki Kobayashi’s “Harakiri” (1962) and Vinod Kapri’s Indian independent film “Pyre.”\n\n\tWhen asked about labels of controversy that have followed her work, Mehta pushed back. “I don’t think that way. Controversy is something that I’ve been labeled with, and I have to live with.”\n\n\tHer father’s wisdom continues to guide her. “You will never know how a filmmaker will be received,” she reflected. “To even think that way isn’t the way I perceive life or live it.”\n\n\tOn questions of national identity, Mehta cited M.G. Vassanji’s book “Nostalgia.” “I really do believe that if I belong anywhere, it’s to myself,” she said. “So that’s my home.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Multiplex Association of India has raised alarm over Netflix’s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, warning that the deal could diminish theatrical content availability and threaten India’s cinema ecosystem.\n\n\tIn a statement, the trade body representing multiplex operators nationwide argued that consolidating a major studio under a streaming platform presents competitive and economic risks to India’s theatrical market.\n\n\n\t“The Indian theatrical market thrives on choice, scale, and cultural diversity,” said Kamal Gianchandani, president of the Multiplex Association of India. “Warner Bros. has historically been a key partner to Indian cinemas, contributing consistently to our release calendar with successful global and local titles.”\n\t\n\n\tThe organization emphasized that Indian cinemas serve as cultural centers and economic engines supporting millions of jobs across production, distribution, exhibition, food and beverage services, and related industries.\n\n\tMAI criticized Netflix‘s historical stance on theatrical distribution, noting the streamer’s limited commitment to cinema-first release strategies. The association warned the acquisition could result in reduced theatrical content and compressed or eliminated theatrical windows for major releases.\n\n\t“Netflix has consistently made it clear through its limited and highly restrictive approach to theatrical releases that it does not believe in the cinema-first model,” Gianchandani said. “If this acquisition proceeds, the risk is two-fold: a meaningful reduction in high-quality content for cinemas, and the potential for shortened or non-existent theatrical windows.”\n\t\n\n\tThe association stated such outcomes would impact exhibitor revenues, reduce consumer options, and weaken the broader film industry infrastructure in India. MAI said it plans to raise these concerns with regulatory authorities domestically and internationally.\n\n\tEstablished in 2002 under the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, MAI represents more than 11 cinema chains operating over 550 multiplexes with approximately 3,000 screens across India.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLaurence Fishburne is looking to step back behind the camera and is currently developing a directing project, “The Rule of Nines,” with producer and casting director Bonnie Timmermann (“I Origins,” “Roofman”) and actor André Holland (“Moonlight”). John Connor wrote the script. \n\n\t“The fact that I’ve been making films since I was 11 or 12 means that I’m a filmmaker,” he tells Variety. “It makes me really prepared.” \n\t\n\n\tFishburne made his directorial debut with 2000’s “Once in the Life,” which he wrote and helmed. He has since turned down a number of directing offers, citing a lack of passion or connection with the material. Now, he says, he’s ready to embrace a more sustained run behind the camera. \n\n\n\t“This may be the moment where I move into the director space in a real, consistent kind of way,” he says. \n\n\tOn the acting front, Fishburne will return for the fifth and final season of “The Witcher” — which he says “will probably be streaming next year, probably around the same time, like Halloween.” Beyond that, he’d like to tap into the comedic sensibility he showcased on “Black-ish” and “Pee-wee’s Playhouse,” if only sporadically elsewhere. \n\n\t“From [my first film] ‘Cornbread, Earl and Me’ on, I’ve always shown up as the guy who will tell you the truth, even if you don’t want to hear it,” he says. “So I haven’t done a whole lot of comedy… but you have to be able to do both if you want to call yourself an actor.” \n\n\tAs if to prove the point, Fishburne played the cut-up at this year’s Marrakech Film Festival, unveiling a formidable arsenal of impressions. He trotted out pitch-perfect turns as Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Abel Ferrara, John Wayne and even Tweety Bird, both during an onstage conversation and later in an interview with Variety. \n\t\n\n\t“I was a big fan of [‘Looney Tunes’ voice actor] Mel Blanc,” he says. “He was really that guy — and I spent a lot of time in my youth doing voices and being funny, inspired by people like Blanc, Frank Gorshin and Robin Williams, who could create entire characters using nothing but their voice.”\n\n\t“The vocal instrument, for me, has always been an essential part of being an actor,” Fishburne adds. “I grew up in a really mixed neighborhood with people from everywhere, and I was always imitating the sounds of the people around me. It’s just my ear — I have to do it. I can’t not do it.” \n\n\t“I’m someone who loves language,” he says. “[Recently] someone mentioned my French, and I said, ‘No, my French is terrible — my accent is perfect, though.’ I just love the sounds we make as human beings.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt was a hectic time in Elkan’s life, and the Sierra Leone-born producer’s phone was constantly buzzing. Taking refuge from the barrage of calls, he began singing repeatedly in the shower: “Who’s calling my phone?” \n\n\tHe recorded the hook, which eventually became the centerpiece of Drake’s “Nokia,” one of the biggest rap songs of the year. “It turns the pain into praise,” Elkan says, calling the track a “miracle record” that “brings the fun back to the party and makes people forget about the nonsense in their lives.” What started as a plea to be left alone turned into a joyful anthem about hitting the dance floor and ringing your friends to find the action. \n\t\n\n\t“Nokia” opens with that cooing hook — “Who’s calling my phone?” — before sliding into a bouncy retro beat that Drake skates over: “Where the fuck the function?” Trickling in the background are marimba-like melodies reminiscent of a mid-2000s ringtone, coupled with R&B vocals and futuristic synths. \n\n\n\t“When I’m making music, I’m always thinking, ‘What does 2050 sound like? What are my grandkids going to dance to?’” Elkan says. \n\n\tHe started making the beat for “Nokia” in his sister’s spare bedroom, sitting on the floor and playing with a MIDI keyboard. He was drawn to the catchy melodies of childhood. “I love lullabies. When I started making music, I would babysit my stepsister, and I always had Cocomelon on,” he says, referring to the kids’ sing-along channel. “Those melodies permeate my brain, and it’s something that I put into my music.” He also mentions the Eurodance sensation Crazy Frog as an inspiration: “It’s annoying, but it’s memorable.” ‘\n\t\n\n\tEventually, Elkan sent the beat to Drake and was “euphoric” when he first heard the rapper’s verses. “This was something I’d been working on for years,” he says. “To hear the record was thrilling.” \n\n\tAs for advice for other artists, Elkan says high-quality equipment isn’t essential to making high-quality art. “A lot of producers and musicians are all about the gear,” he says. “Honestly, you don’t need any of that. It’s all about you as a human.” \n\n\tAnd in another memorable if annoying turn, the producer can barely ring up a friend these days without hearing his infectious catchphrase on the other line: “Who’s calling my phone?”\n\n\tSongwriters: Drake, Elkan \n\n\tProducer: Elkan \n\n\tLabels: OVO Sound, Santa Anna Records & Republic Records \n\n\tHitmakers: \n\n\tElkan, co-writer and producer \n\n\tTheo Skudra, video director \n\n\tKelly Jeffrey, cinematographer \n\n\tMr. Morgan, president, OVO\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmong the many burning questions about Netflix‘s potential acquisition of Warner Bros. is: What would happen to HBO Max? Would customers continue to subscribe to both, or would it ultimately roll into Netflix?\n\n\tAt least immediately, Netflix has said HBO Max would continue as a separate entity — but makes no promises that it wouldn’t ultimately be consumed into Netflix. HBO becoming a tile on Netflix, just like Hulu being slowly taken over by Disney+, is a likely possibility.\n\t\n\n\tBut here’s one that no one seems to be asking: What about the linear HBO service? You know, the pioneering network that essentially ushered in the cable age when it launched in 1972? HBO, the channel that revolutionized “prestige TV” with “The Sopranos,” and everything that came after that?\n\n\n\tEven if HBO as a brand survives this merger, the idea of HBO as a standalone enterprise may soon be history. And it would also pretty much double as the last nail in the coffin of “premium cable” as we knew it. \n\n\tAlready, Paramount has destroyed the one-vibrant Showtime brand — first, by killing the standalone Showtime app, and then even renaming to remaining linear channel to “Paramount + With Showtime.” Now, there’s no Showtime infrastructure to speak of, and the cabler’s last remaining shows — like the “Dexter” spinoffs and “Yellowjackets” — are instead promoted as Paramount+ originals. Showtime, a flagship premium cable network that first launched in 1976, may live on in bits of leftover branding in some corners of the media universe, but it’s mostly dead.\n\n\tFX wasn’t officially a premium cable network since it’s free on basic cable, but it evolved into a “premium” brand, inspired by the success of HBO in delivering its own diet of high-end, quality fare. Like HBO, FX changed the programming game and for a moment made basic cable a hot place for creators to bring their passion projects, as did AMC during the “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad” eras. FX still exists, but mostly as a tile on Hulu. Not all of FX’s fare airs on the linear channel — which now mostly schedules library movies and repeats. When people talk about “FX,” they’re not talking about the linear channel anymore. (Meanwhile, with the writing on the wall for linear, AMC has attempted to migrate its viewers to its AMC+ streamer, with mixed results.)\n\t\n\n\tAmong the smaller premium channels, MGM+ remains a linear/stream hybrid under Amazon ownership, while Starz also programs a linear suite of channels, even as it prefers to focus on its digital platform. But both would prefer you think of them as digital brands, not legacy TV channels.\n\n\tAnd that brings us to HBO. Even under Warner Bros. Discovery, the pay cabler has been pulling back on its linear offerings: Earlier this year, the company shut down multiplex networks including HBO Family, ThrillerMax, MovieMax and OuterMax. \n\n\tThose cuts came from a company with leadership that was rooted in cable. Imagine, now, how much patience Netflix’s Ted Sarandos might have for what’s left in the HBO linear stable. (The answer? Not much.) Sarandos and Netflix have never shown any interest in owning or operating linear properties, after all. Netflix purposely didn’t include the channels being spun off by the “Discovery” portion of “Warner Bros. Discovery” in its bid. So how long would it tolerate programming HBO linear, rather than forcing those remaining customers to move to digital?\n\n\tRight now, HBO linear subscribers still get free access to HBO Max — which was part of the promise of HBO Max when it initially launched in 2020. Would Netflix put up with those hybrid linear customers accessing the streamer that way? When it comes to cutting costs in the merger, will Netflix decide having a linear network infrastructure still makes sense, or will it be an easy thing to whack off the spreadsheets and the bottom line?\n\n\tJust like the sunsetting era of basic cable, the fate of premium cable perhaps had already been sealed no matter what. In 2024, HBO averaged just 154,000 viewers in primetime — down 7% from the previous year, but a huge slide from recent years (including 726,000. in 2017) as viewership continued its migration to streaming.\n\n\tNetflix launched its original programming efforts in the early 2010s by emulating the HBO model — starting with high-end fare like “House of Cards.” It wanted to out-HBO HBO, and eventually got so big that it went from boutique to warehouse. Now, Netflix has out-broadcast the broadcast networks instead, while HBO remains a high-end bespoke destination, but mostly on HBO Max. Netflix garners a large awards nomination haul thanks to its sheer output volume, but HBO also dominates thanks to its quality curation. \n\t\n\n\tIf Netflix does buy Warner Bros., it will be only a matter of time until premium cable dies. HBO would be just one more brand to add to the Netflix’s bulging menu, alongside the WWE, the NFL and more. The narrative of Netflix vs. HBO has ruled over TV discourse, particularly in the awards space, for more than a decade. But now Netflix might not have to be HBO anymore, nor would it have to beat it — instead, it would just consume it.\n",

    "description": "\n\tAfter a few marathon days of telephone and video calls, emails and text message chains, the $82.7 billion agreement for Netflix to buy Warner Bros. ",
    "body": "\n\tAfter a few marathon days of telephone and video calls, emails and text message chains, the $82.7 billion agreement for Netflix to buy Warner Bros. and HBO Max was clinched Thursday night around 10 p.m. ET.\n\n\tBut there was no chance for high fives or a group huddle among the managers of the freshly betrothed media giants. In modern fashion, the sale negotiations were mostly conducted at arm’s length via phone and electronic communications, with Netflix and WBD executives and legal teams spread across New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and other locales.\n\t\n\n\tAmong the final hurdles to securing the initial agreement was WBD’s insistence that Netflix commit to a record-setting $5.8 billion breakup fee should the deal run into resistance, regulatory or otherwise. \n\n\n\tOpposition to the deal assembled, swiftly and fiercely, from unions, consumer watchdogs and politicos on both sides of the aisle. “This merger must be blocked,” the Writers Guild of America urged on Friday. \n\n\tIn the end, about six weeks after Paramount CEO David Ellison’s pushy overtures put the studio in play, the Warner Bros. Discovery board got what it wanted – a pedigreed, market-leading buyer with firm financial foundation and a clear strategic need to make the most of Warner Bros. and HBO.\n\n\tOn the surface, the Netflix deal would seem an echo of the AOL-Time Warner transaction completed in January 2001. A highflying beacon of what was then called “new media” buys a legacy entertainment company with brands that seem to be ripe for exploitation in new ways.\n\n\tThe AOL takeover of Time Warner, of course, was nothing less than disastrous. The grand thesis of the merger unraveled in barely a year’s time after the dot-com bust and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This time around, the Netflix acquisition signals the (near) conquest of Southern California’s most dynamic industry by one of the world-beating tech giants that sprang from Northern California.\n\t\n\n\tThe WBD board leaned toward the Netflix bid because the company has such a strong balance sheet. Its stock has been one of the most consistent and durable performers over a turbulent decade for media and entertainment. Unlike AOL in 2001, when its growth was powered by offering basic dial-up internet access, Netflix has a strong underlying business model that can’t easily be outmoded by new tech or undercut on price by rivals. TV shows and movies are, after all, very sticky – ask any “Bridgerton” or “Strangers Things” fan.\n\n\tNetflix’s long-horizon outlook stands in contrast to Paramount Skydance, which began its pursuit of WBD shortly after Skydance Media sealed its $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Communications. It’s a sign of the times that the parent company of Paramount Pictures and CBS – two entertainment institutions that have been around for more than 100 years – are a bigger risk than a much younger venture that has been in the original programming game for about a dozen years. \n\n\tParamount Skydance faces an uphill climb in turning around the fortunes of its studio and legacy cable networks and restoring strong free cash flow. The company is also carrying more debt on its balance sheet than Netflix, proportionate to its earnings power. All of these factors were a consideration for the WBD board. In the case of a black-swan event for the macro economy, how would Paramount fare? \n\n\tThe lack of certainty there helped sway WBD board members that Netflix was the better fit and safer option for shareholders than Paramount or even Comcast, which was the third contender for the studio in the whirlwind bidding process that began in earnest in early November. The process quickly crystallized into a test of wills between two Davids – Ellison and WBD CEO David Zaslav. There’s been endless industry chatter that Zaslav was angling for a deal that left him with a high executive perch in the resulting company. Ellison slammed the WBD leader in a legal letter sent to Zaslav on Thursday accusing him of having “abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process” in order to steer the deal to Netflix.\n\n\tWBD board members were already put off by Paramount’s unsolicited offer and the whispers around Hollywood and D.C. that only Ellison and his familial connections to the Trump White House would be able to secure regulatory approval for such a big merger.\n\t\n\n\tBut Donald Trump is famous for working his phone, and Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is definitely in his contacts. President Trump respects Netflix’s rags-to-riches growth as a modern American business success story. And while Trump often expresses hostility to Hollywood as a bastion of touchy-feely liberalism, the reality is that he has long been fascinated by the industry, especially after he became a TV star via NBC’s “The Apprentice.”\n\n\tSources close to the situation emphasize that even in Hollywood, ego takes a back seat to business rationale when the enterprise value tops $82 billion.\n\n\tNetflix and WBD leaders including Zaslav are preparing to make a strenuous case for the consumer benefits of the deal as well as the positive impact that the enlarged company will have on the creative community.\n\n\tZaslav, Sarandos and Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters are bracing for a long fight. The leaders are projecting a closing timeline of as much as 18 months given the scrutiny on the companies and the political crosscurrents. \n\n\tThere are points to be gained for elected officials on the left and right by railing against another big media merger. That could make for a long drawn-out battle in Washington with the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department. The FCC is not expected to play much if any role in this review because of the nature of assets involved – WBD does not own broadcast TV stations (a la Paramount) or cable systems (a la Comcast).\n\n\tSources said the Netflix and WBD teams are confident that on the antitrust merits it’s hard to prove the enlarged company would have anything close to monopoly power over the content marketplace –particularly at a time when Netflix, HBO and others have for-real competition for the hearts and minds of younger viewers from likes of YouTube and TikTok.\n\n\tIn their first presentations about the deal on Friday, Netflix and WBD emphasized how little overlap there is between the companies. Netflix has stated its intention to maintain HBO Max and Warner Bros. studio operations as standalone businesses under the Netflix tent. Anyone who has experienced a Hollywood merger in recent decades knows that no matter what is said in the moment, the long-term arc of any business leans toward streamlining, efficiencies and eliminating redundancies. Consolidation will eventually affect some on the list of accomplished senior executives who are spread among Netflix, Warner Bros. and HBO.\n\t\n\n\tFor the most senior executive at WBD, however, the future does seem to be coming into focus. Sarandos and Peters are firmly installed as Netflix co-CEOs. Zaslav has been telling friends and colleagues that he’s focused on helping to get the merger to the finish line and to deliver a healthy Warner Bros. and HBO Max to Sarandos when it’s time to hand over the keys.\n\n\tIf the deal goes through as it was outlined to investors today, Zaslav will eventually lose his CEO perch but he’ll gain many, many millions (as will a host of senior WB and HBO executives through stock options), as well as the satisfaction of having gone out on his own terms.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSaudi Arabia is launching a sprawling new state-of-the-art film studio just outside the capital city of Riyadh where pre-production is underway on an ambitious historical epic titled “Unbroken Sword,” directed by Alik Sakharov, who has helmed multiple episodes of “The Sopranos” and “Game of Thrones.”\n\n\tThe new Saudi filmmaking facilities, called PlayMaker Studios, are part of the Qiddiya entertainment city on the slopes of the iconic Tuwaiq Mountains, 40 minutes southwest of Riyadh, that will comprise high-end theme parks, motor sport facilities, and a safari park in hopes of attracting millions of visitors.\n\t\n\n\tThe production hub spans more than 50 acres of backlots and comprises two purpose-built soundstages with high-spec audio systems, and “full production facilities designed to meet the needs of ambitious, global productions,” according to a statement.\n\n\n\tThe hub features production offices and “premium on-site amenities, offering a seamless, end-to-end environment for every stage of production.” It will include dedicated post-production and visual effects facilities as well as music studios. PlayMaker Studios will offers producers streamlined access to Saudi Arabia’s 40% production rebate.\n\n\tThe PlayMaker Studios complex “is set to serve as both a creative powerhouse and a cornerstone of Qiddiya City’s entertainment ecosystem,” the statement noted.\n\n\tPrincipal photography is set to begin in early 2026 on “Unbroken Sword,” which is the first film to be shot at PlayMaker Studios, where a crew of more than 200 people is already on the ground, according to the statement. The film is being sponsored by Saudi’s General Entertainment Authority and Riyadh Season, and produced by Sela.\n\t\n\n\tThe big-budget Saudi epic is reportedly set in 7th-century Arabia and follows a mythical warrior who leads an outnumbered Muslim army across uncharted desert terrain to do battle with the Roman and Persian empires.\n\n\t“Unbroken Sword” is being executive produced by British producer Richard Sharkey, whose credits include “House of the Dragon,” “Marco Polo,” “The Fifth Estate” and “The Lord of the Rings” franchises.\n\n\t“PlayMaker Studios is a cornerstone of Qiddiya City’s ambition and builds on Saudi Arabia’s growing success in the creative industries,” Abdullah Aldawood, managing director of Qiddiya Investment Company said in the statement. “It marks an important step in strengthening this momentum and realizing our vision to create a world-class destination where innovation, culture and entertainment come together, and where the global film industry can find a new home in the Kingdom,” he added.\n\n\tSharkey commented, “Bringing ‘Unbroken Sword’ to PlayMaker Studios feels like the start of something genuinely groundbreaking.” \n\n\tQiddiya is one of the so-called “giga projects” financed by Saudi’s Public Investment Fund in line with the Vision 2030 plan announced by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to wean the economy off oil and create jobs for young Saudis.\n\n\tThe announcement was made during Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea Film Festival, which runs until Dec. 13.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAnnemarie Jacir‘s drama “Palestine 36,” which reconstructs the largely unknown Palestinian revolt against British colonial rule in 1936, is the very definition of a passion project for the director who has always explored Palestinian identity her films. But never on such a large canvas. \n\n\tHer particularly timely historical epic follows a young man named Yusuf who gets caught up in political upheaval as tensions rise in Jerusalem and in his village amid British crackdowns prompted by the arrival of Jewish immigrants escaping antisemitism in Europe. The multi-strand drama features a high-profile cast comprising Jeremy Irons as a colonial commissioner, Hiam Abbas (“Succession”), Liam Cunningham and Saleh Bakri (“The Teacher”).\n\t\n\n\tWhen the Israel-Hamas War broke out on Oct. 7, 2023, Jacir was just one week away from starting principal photography on “Palestine 36” in Bethlehem, where she was born. Production was put on hold and subsequently started in Jordan before returning for additional shooting in Palestine.\n\n\n\tThe film – which is Palestine’s official entry for the Oscars’ international feature film race – is having its Middle East premiere at Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea Film Festival in Jeddah after launching from Toronto and playing at other top events including the Marrakech Film Festival where it is the closer.\n\n\t“Palestine 36” will be released by Watermelon Pictures in the U.S. in early 2026 promoted with a series of conversations held by Mark Ruffalo, Diego Luna, Susan Sarandon, Riz Ahmed, Ava DuVernay, Mira Nair, Julie Delpy and Ramy Youssef.\n\t\n\n\tJacir – whose previous works comprise “When I Saw You,” “Salt of This Sea” and “Wajib” – speaks to Variety about her research for this film and her first impressions of playing it for a U.S. audience.\n\n\tI know the film is based on research and rooted in historical fact. But I’m wondering about the central character of Khuloud, the feisty female journalist. Is she based on a real person?\n\n\tKhaloud is a female, well-educated, upper-class journalist during this period, completely inspired by a number of real women who were working in Palestine, but also in Lebanon and Egypt. They were using male names for two reasons. One, because it was kind of looked down upon [for a woman] to be a journalist, and they wanted to be taken seriously. And the second reason is they were writing under a colonial government that was censoring the news and it was dangerous to be a journalist. Which, incidentally, is still the case today.\n\n\tKhuloud is married to Amir, the wealthy newspaper editor who belongs to the Muslim Association that we learn is in collusion with a Jewish agency called the Zionist Commission. How did that surface?\n\n\tWhen I started doing the research I came across this mention of a Zionist Commission for Arab Affairs and that they were placing articles in newspapers in Arabic to influence people. And I was like, wow! That’s so modern. That’s what people do today. I started digging at it more. The Palestinian national parties had what were called the Muslim Christian associations that were working towards independence. Then I found out that the Zionists founded a Muslim Association to break that solidarity. Divide and conquer has really been the way for hundreds of years that has worked all over the world.\n\n\tThe film shows factionalism within the Palestinians. Do you also see that as something that is relevant today?\n\n\tAbsolutely. We still see that kind of thing going on. What we have today [the Israeli -Palestinian conflict] is not a religious conflict. People want to turn into a religious conflict by saying: “Oh, Jews and Muslims have been fighting for thousands of years. But it’s not a religious conflict. And people play upon that. I find it really interesting because even now the Israelis are trying very hard to continue that history of divide and conquer. They started with the Druze community. The Druze community is part of us, they are part of our community. But they’ve been putting Druze in the army. Putting them on the borders. Letting them do the grunt work. It’s all about trying to separate a people.\n\t\n\n\tIn terms of your historical sources, I’ve read that one of them is the book “The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine” by Columbia University professor Rashid Khalid. Have you been in contact with him. Has he seen the film?\n\n\tThere were books by many other people as well, including one by Tom Segev [a columnist for Israeli newspaper “Ha’aretz”], another by [Israeli historian] Ilan Pappe. And others. Khalid has not seen the film yet. I am waiting for him to see it. But other historians that have seen it whose works are very influential to me. Charles Anderson, a historian who writes a lot about the period, has seen the film and wrote a  beautiful response to it. The same goes for [Oxford University historian] Avi Shlaim, who has seen the film. That’s one of the things that makes me nervous, you know. There’s the audience, and then there’s the academics and the historians. What are they gonna say? It’s like: I don’t care about the reviews, I care about these guys.\n\n\tA lot has been written about the fact that you were in prep when Oct. 7 events forced you to relocate from Palestine to Jordan. Simply put: what was it like to be shooting this film about the roots of the conflict just as it escalated to an unprecedented level?\n\n\tThere was something really insane about it, and emotionally very difficult. Because, you know, we were making this film about this violent period, this critical period. But the violence around us was so much worse than what we could have ever imagined. We always think we’ve lived through a dark moment of history, and then we find ourselves living an even darker one. \n\n\tThough the film is from the Palestinian perspective you interweave archive footage that shows real footage of Jewish refugees fleeing persecution in Europe. Talk to me about that choice.\n\n\tThat was an important choice for me because we don’t have Jewish characters in the film, but I think its crucial to see the background of what was going on. I wanted to focus on the British [colonialists] and their complicity in the conflict. But also on the fact that for me Palestine is one of the most ethnically and religiously mixed places on earth. Armenians fled the Ottoman genocide and came to Palestine, and they are part of our community. Circassians came to Palestine. Bosnians came to Palestine. There’s a village in Palestine that founded by Bosnians. Jewish people fled Europe. They fled fascism and Nazism and came for safety. They were later used for a political project. But I wanted to show the people on those boats coming in because we were a country – not to say that we were perfect, or that we were angels – but we were a country that a lot of people have been coming in and out of for thousands and thousands of years. From the East, from the West. Some as conquerors, some as Crusaders. Some as religious pilgrims. There’s a Nigerian community that came as religious pilgrims. It’s who we are. And I wanted to nod to that fact that the fascism that was happening in Europe was not us. They came for safety.\n\t\n\n\tThe film just played for a week as a sneak peak in U.S. theaters prior to its more substantial rollout early next year. What are your thoughts about bringing it to American audiences in the current climate?\n\n\tI never thought that there would be a Palestinian distribution company in the U.S. Then when Watermelon Pictures approached us I thought: the world is really changing! The U.S. is the one place where I’ve always struggled to get distribution. So it’s interesting. I’ve been to the U.S. now a couple times for these  Oscar screenings or festival screenings. It’s really interesting because first of all, I’m looking out at the audience, and there’s a bunch of 18-year-olds. They are like old-school progressives, and they are all 18 year-olds. And second of all, I’m always waiting for some aggressive thing to happen, because that’s how it used to be. I had somebody spit at me once in a screening. You known Palestinian voices can trigger craziness in some people. And I’m having none of that happening. I haven’t lived in the U.S. in, like, 25 years. But I feel something is happening. The climate is really bad. But also something has happened for the better. I think people are open.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tVeteran documentary filmmaker Ondi Timoner and her wife, Morgan Doctor, were working on a film in Budapest when they got a phone call informing them their home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Altadena had burned to the ground in the Eaton Fire. It was Jan. 7, 2025.\n\n\tTimoner, known for docus like “DIG!,” “We Live in Public,” “Last Flight Home” and most recently “All God’s Children” had lived in the home for 14 years. The director lost all of her physical possessions, including her film equipment and hard drives containing footage from past films, as well as cash, jewelry, valuable paintings and her son’s artwork. But despite the traumatic loss, when Timoner returned to LA she decided to film her and Doctor’s return to their nonexistent dwelling. The director teamed with producer Maggie Contreras and cinematographer Elle Schneider, and her nephew, Eli Timoner.\n\t\n\n\tTogether, over a six month period, the small crew captured what the aftermath of the fires looked like for Timoner and her neighbors, many of whom had their generational wealth wiped out overnight and were now at risk of being displaced and losing their homes permanently. Timoner also filmed with Altadena community organizer Heavenly Hughes and the nonprofit organization My Tribe Rise as they attempted to restore the lives of those in need during the aftermath of the catastrophic fires.\n\n\n\tThe result of Timoner’s efforts is the 38-minute documentary “All The Walls Came Down,” which captures the resilience and solidarity of a community determined to rise again. The director uses her personal loss as a way into a larger story about a community rallying together in the wake of the fires. The doc also chronicles how the Black community of West Altadena is being pushed out despite still making mortgage payments on houses that are no longer standing.\n\t\n\n\t“I am so glad I did film when I returned to the ruins of my home, despite really feeling hopeless and overwhelmed,” says Timoner. “It gave me the material with which to transform the experience from an utter nightmare which we are still living through, to something that can protect and heal. We made the film fast and kept it a short film to try to help an urgent situation in my town.”\n\n\tIn September, “All The Walls Came Down” premiered at the Telluride Film Festival. On Sunday, the film will screen at the Sun Valley Film Festival, where Timoner will receive the Impact Award. (The short doc is eligible for an Oscar nomination, which Timoner has never received.)Since the doc’s debut, it has been used to raise financial and tangible resources, such as Airstream trailers for families who lost homes. Working as a team with My Tribe Rise, Timoner has held screenings of the doc for financiers and organizations that can help Altadena and its struggling residents.\n\n\t“All The Walls Came Down” has shown me the true power of filmmaking – giving me the opportunity to turn an unimaginable tragedy into a rallying cry and a shield to protect the town and its most vulnerable,” says Timoner. “It’s felt like practicing alchemy to tell my intimate story of grief and loss in order to get help for my neighbors to keep their land and rebuild.”\n\n\tCurrently Timoner and her team are working to get the film out to help build signatures on a petition to stop the foreclosures in Altadena.\n\n\t“We have reached over 1000 signatures and we are just getting started,” says Timoner. “We ask Governor Gavin Newsom and the California State Legislature to issue an immediate moratorium on mortgage payments, interest accrual, foreclosures, and evictions for all residents impacted by the Eaton Fire of January 2025 until claims against Southern California Edison and related insurance issues are resolved.”\n\n\tOn Jan. 7, the Los Angeles Times will release “All The Walls Came Down” on its documentary platform.\n\n\t“We want to continue to use the film as a way to help the community heal from such a traumatic event that spanned from the Palisades to Altadena,” says Timoner. “We also hope to raise bridge funding to aid Altadena families in need in their recovery.”\n",

He says she stayed in contact with him from months through calls, texts, FaceTime and invited him to visit her in Utah and California.\n      \n    \n          Marciano claims Demi even shared her location with him and says, \"That behavior confirms a continued relationship, not a person reacting to sexual assault.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          In the docs, he says Demi's false claims have resulted in \"lost professional opportunities, harassment by strangers, and lasting harm to Marciano's reputation.\"\n      \n    \n          Marciano is suing for defamation and going after Demi and the producer for damages ... and he wants a \"narrowly tailored injunction\" that prohibits them from \"repeating and republishing all of the statements that are adjudicated by this Court to be defamatory.\"\n      \n    \n          We reached out to Demi and Jeff ... so far no word back.\n      \n      ",

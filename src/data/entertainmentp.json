    "body": "\n\tJust over two years after Suzanne Somers’ death, the late actor and fitness icon’s widower Alan Hamel has revealed he’s created an AI clone of Somers for online fan interactions. Hamel gave an exclusive interview to People magazine and officially announced that a “Suzanne AI Twin” is in development, calling it a “really interesting” project. Somers and Hamel were married for 55 years. She died in October 2023 from breast cancer.\n\n\t“It was Suzanne. And I asked her a few questions and she answered them, and it blew me and everybody else away,” Hamel, 89, told the publication about the AI clone of his late wife. “When you look at the finished one next to the real Suzanne, you can’t tell the difference. It’s amazing. And I mean, I’ve been with Suzanne for 55 years, so I know what her face looks like. When I just look at the two of them side by side, I really can’t tell which one is the real and which one is the AI.”\n\t\n\n\tTo create an AI version of Somers, Hamel and the development team trained an AI system with “all of Suzanne’s 27 books and a lot of interviews that she has done, hundreds of interviews, so that she’s really ready to be able to be asked any question at all and be able to answer it, because the answer will be within her.” \n\n\tAccording to Hamel, the idea of creating a virtual Somers has long been in development and is something even Somers herself was interested in creating when she was alive. \n\n\t“It was Suzanne’s idea. And she said, ‘I think we should do that.’ She said, ‘I think it’ll be very interesting and we’ll provide a service to my fans and to people who have been reading my books who really want and need information about their health,'” Hamel said. “So that’s the reason we did it. And so I love being able to fulfill her wish.”\n\t\n\n\tOnce a version of the AI Suzanne is finished, the plan is to upload “her” on SuzanneSomers.com so that she can become a 24/7 AI chatbot for the late Somers’ fans. As her widower summarized: “There’ll be people who will ask her about their health issues, and Suzanne will be able to answer them. Not Suzanne’s version of the answer, but it’ll go directly to the doctor she interviewed for that very issue, so it’ll be coming from an MD.”\n\n\t“The first time I spoke to Suzanne AI, for the first two or three minutes, it was a little strange. But after that, I forgot about the fact that I was talking to a robot and asking her questions and getting answers, and it happens that fast for me, getting used to the whole idea,” Hamel added to People.\n\n\tSomers, who parlayed TV stardom in the sitcom hits “Three’s Company” and “Step by Step” into a personal fortune as a health and fitness pitchwoman and author, died Oct. 15, 2023 at 76 years old.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Tokyo International Film Festival has revealed that veteran Japanese director Yamada Yoji will receive the Lifetime Achievement Award at its 38th edition, recognizing a career spanning more than 60 years and 91 films.\n\n\tYamada’s latest work, “Tokyo Taxi,” starring Baisho Chieko and Kimura Takuya, based on the 2023 French film “Driving Madeleine,” will screen as this year’s TIFF Centerpiece and receive theatrical release on Nov. 21. The director will also participate in a talk session with “Kokuho” director Lee Sang-il at the TIFF Lounge.\n\t\n\n\tAs previously announced, legendary Japanese actor Yoshinaga Sayuri will also be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award. \n\n\n\tSince his 1961 directorial debut with “Nikai no tanin,” Yamada has created films deeply rooted in Japanese culture and everyday life. His most celebrated work remains the “Tora-san” series (“Tora-san, Our Lovable Tramp”), which ran to 50 films beginning in 1969 and earned Guinness World Records recognition. \n\n\tThe director shifted to period films in the 2000s with significant international success. “The Twilight Samurai” (2002) swept 15 categories at the Japan Academy Film Prizes and earned an Oscar nomination for best foreign language film, as the category was known then. “The Hidden Blade” (2004) competed at Berlin and won top honors at the Zimbabwe International Film Festival, while “The Little House” (2014) took home the Silver Bear at the Berlinale.\n\n\tYamada’s recent work includes “Tora-san, Wish You Were Here” (2019), which marked the series’ 50th anniversary, followed by “It’s A Flickering Life” (2021) and “Mom, Is That You?!” (2023).\n\t\n\n\t“Yamada Yoji has long observed the realities of Japanese society with a discerning yet compassionate eye, crystallizing them into numerous cinematic masterpieces over the decades,” said TIFF chair Ando Hiroyasu in a statement. He noted Yamada’s support of the festival since its inception and his recent service as chair of the Kurosawa Akira Award Jury.\n\n\tThe director’s honors include Japan’s Order of Culture (2012), recognition as a Person of Cultural Merit (2004), and designation as an Honorary Citizen of Tokyo (2014).\n\n\tThe 38th Tokyo International Film Festival runs Oct. 27-Nov. 5 in the Hibiya-Yurakucho-Marunouchi-Ginza area.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMariska Hargitay appeared on Amy Poehler’s “Good Hang” podcast and revealed she auditioned and screen tested many times for “Friends” a few years before landing the role of Olivia Benson on “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.” Both shows are NBC staples.\n\n\t“I did a lot of comedy auditions,” Hargitay told Poehler (via The Daily Beast). “I did ‘Seinfeld’ and I did ‘Single Guy,’ and I tested for ‘Friends’ so many times. I think for Monica. I always thought I would end up being on a sitcom or doing comedy.” \n\t\n\n\tEven when more dramatic roles came her way, Hargitay said: “I was like, I want to do drama but it has to be funny because that’s what I felt like my gifts were… [I would tell people], ‘I’m going to be a comedian because I’m funny and I’m pretty.’”\n\n\n\tHargitay’s reveal may surprise some. The actor has been playing Olivia Benson on “SVU” for more than 25 years, which makes her the longest-running character in live-action primetime TV history. It wasn’t until Hargitay consulted with a psychic that she was confronted with the possibility that comedy might not work out.\n\n\t“I’m in L.A., [a] struggling actor [wondering] what am I going to do?” Hargitay said. “I came to New York, which I did three times a year to see theater. And then I met with this psychic. Everyone said to me, ‘Oh my gosh, Mariska, you have to meet with this psychic. He’s amazing.’ … I drove out somewhere on Long Island to this man and I went there and he started saying all this amazing stuff to me.”\n\n\t“I was listening to him really intently like this. He said to me… ‘You see that face you’re doing right now? You see that face?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ He goes, ‘You’re going to be famous for that face. You’re moving to New York and you’re gonna be famous for that face,’” Hargitay continued, noting she still wanted to land a network sitcom role at the time. “I said, ‘Uh, no.’ I live in L.A. and I’m going to be a comedian. Six months later, swear to God… I got ‘SVU.’”\n\t\n\n\tWatch Hargitay’s full interview on the “Good Hang” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter Warner Bros. Discovery said it has received acquisition overtures from “multiple parties,” top execs at Netflix were asked on their company’s earnings interview whether they see industry consolidation changing the competitive landscape — and if Netflix sees an opportunity to participate in any major M&A activity.\n\n\tThe upshot? Mostly a “no” on both points, although co-CEO Ted Sarandos left the door open by saying Netflix can be “choosy” about its M&A targets.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s true that, historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook,” Sarandos said, responding to an analyst question about M&A in the context of Warner Bros. Discovery’s announcement earlier in the day. “Nothing is a must-have for us to meet our goals that we have for the business.”\n\n\n\tSaid Sarandos, “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there. But in general, we believe that we can be and we will be choosy [about acquisitions]. We have a great business. We’re predominantly focused on growing organically, investing aggressively and responsibly into the growth and returning excess cash flow to shareholders” through share repurchases.\n\n\tNetflix focuses “on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A,” Sarandos said. “And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them — and we look at all of them — and we apply the same framework and lens that we look at when we look to invest in a build.” According to Sarandos, the questions executives ask about potential acquisitions include: Is it a big opportunity? If it’s IP, does it strengthen our entertainment offering? Is there additional value in ownership? Does it strengthen our existing capabilities somehow? And does it accelerate our existing strategy? In addition, Netflix evaluates “all these things relative to the price, relative to the opportunity cost, and relative to other alternatives,” Sarandos said.\n\t\n\n\tGreg Peters, Netflix’s other co-CEO, chimed in about how M&A might change the competitive landscape. “We’ve always faced significant competition. We still face it today,” he said, noting industry consolidation over the years that has included Disney buying 21st Century Fox, Amazon buying MGM, AT&T acquiring Time Warner Inc., and Discovery buying Time Warner to form Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\n\t“But you know, none of those mergers were a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape, and we have seen also a wide range of outcomes from such mergers,” Peters said, echoing previous comments he’s made on the topic. “So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change, in and of itself — at least our view — on the competitive landscape, and we don’t think it changes the substance of the challenge that our competitors face, specifically the range of activities that we and our competitors have to get great at,” which he said “has never been assembled in a single company before.”\n\n\t“Think about, you know, producing film and TV shows across multiple genres and multiple languages in dozens of countries around the world, trying to figure out how to incorporate the latest technology, including, you know, AI and Gen AI,” Peters said. “Our competitors are seeking to get better at all those things, of course, as well, but you have to do that by the hard work of developing those capabilities in the trenches day to day. You don’t get there simply by buying another company that is also still developing those same capabilities.”\n\n\tThe two execs made the comments Tuesday on the company’s earnings interview for the third quarter of 2025. Netflix revenue was in-line with forecasts but its earnings per share missed Wall Street forecasts due to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery, in disclosing that its board is evaluating various strategic options, didn’t say which buyers have expressed an interest in snapping up all or part of Warner Bros. Discovery. One of them is known to be Paramount Skydance, headed by chairman and CEO David Ellison. On Tuesday, WBD reportedly turned down a mostly cash bid of “nearly” $24 per share from Paramount for the entire company.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJoe Hill‘s ambitious new novel — the 900-page killer dragon epic “King Sorrow” — is inspired by love.\n\n\t“I knew it was going to be the first book I was going to dedicate to my wife,” Hill says. “I think I wanted to impress her, and you know the trouble a man can get into when he tries to impress his best girl. So I began piling everything into it that I thought Gillian would love, and it would be fun to read.”\n\n\n\tWhile the novel is a present to Hill’s wife, the editor and publisher Gillian Redfearn, his fans are in for a big adventure as well, as “King Sorrow” hits bookstores today from William Morrow. In the novel, six friends must make sacrifices through the years for the titular dragon after they call upon it for protection. From there, Hill dips into several different modes of storytelling.\n\t\n\n\t“You have one part of the story which is a mini-air disaster novel set on a 747 flying from New York to London, and there’s a dragon outside the porthole window off in the thunderclouds,” Hill says. “Another part of the book is an ‘Indiana Jones’-style plunge into a troll’s trap-filled cave. At one point, a couple of people are kidnapped by a for-profit paramilitary organization, and they’re forced to tell everything they know about the dragon, King Sorrow. There’s a desperate attempt to rescue survivors from a collapsed building. There’s a drunken brawl on roller skates. I just kept piling it on because there seemed to be so much story there.”\n\n\tThe book’s release is coming as “Black Phone 2,” the sequel to the film based on Hill’s short story “The Black Phone,” sits at the top of the box office. While that movie is perfect spooky season fodder thanks to Ethan Hawke’s portrayal of the villainous Grabber, Hill was inspired to write his newest book because he loved his scaly antagonist.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m a guy who thinks Smaug from ‘The Hobbit’ is my favorite fictional character,” Hill says. “I think I like Smaug even more than Sherlock Holmes. I also think that a lot of times horror novels are only as good as their antagonist. So having a really great 4,000-ton, 70-foot-dragon with a nasty sense of humor feels like a stable thing to build a book around.”\n\n\tAlong with the plot inspiration, Hill amps up his prose, making for a distinctly cinematic reading experience.\n\n\t“For something on the scale of ‘King Sorrow,’ the language has to be fairly lean, mean, clean and direct,” he says. “You want elegance, but you also want zip.”\n\n\tBetween the plotting, pace and Hollywood’s love of adapting Hill’s work, it’s easy to imagine a deep-pocketed streamer taking on “King Sorrow” as a limited series. Luckily, he’s been pleased with the other interpretations of his work.\n\n\t“I’ve been really lucky because no one’s made an out-and-out stinker,” Hill says. “All the adaptations that have been made of my work, I have generally thought they were pretty fun, and I found things to admire in them. I love when someone reads something and says, ‘Oh, this is fun. I want to do this as a TV series,’ or ‘I want to do this as a film or comic book.’ Then you get to see what they found interesting in it, and how they take that and make it their own, make it personal, expand upon what elements of the books they always wanted to explore more.”\n\n\tOf course, Hill has the unique vantage of seeing decades of his father Stephen King‘s work adapted in ways ranging from brilliant (“Stand By Me”) to noxious (“Thinner”).\n\n\t“When the adaptations are really successful, it’s because they’ve captured something about his voice and his unique view of an artist in the world we live in,” Hill says. “The relationships between men with other men and women with their society and married couples. When you hear the characters talk, it’s like reading the dialogue in the book. It has that sound, that music which is unique to my dad’s work.”\n\n\tDespite coming from a legendarily spooky family, leading the box office with a supernatural killer and touting a book with a deadly dragon, Hill says that his home will not be decked out with seasonal Halloween gear — for good reason.\n\n\t“I wish I could tell you the house is draped in cobwebs, and the ‘Addams Family’ music is echoing through the halls, and kids creep up to the front door to get candy and the door swings open of its own volition and I lurch forward out of the dark in fright makeup, and they run screaming before they can get their candy,” Hill says. “That would be terrific, but it’s not like that at all, and here’s why: Because I’ve been writing horror fiction for 20 years now, and Halloween is when I have to work. I’m like Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, so I’m not doing trick-or-treating or diving into the pleasures of the season. I’m usually out there with a book or a film or a TV show or something, trying to find subtle, clever, charming ways to say, ‘Buy my stuff.'”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJeff Cheen, the music executive who worked with the likes of John Lennon and Pink Floyd, and brought Western pop music to China, died from cancer on Oct. 16. He was 80.\n\n\tBorn in New York in 1945, Cheen began his music career as a teenager, working for his uncle Leonard Chess at Chess Records in Chicago. He swiftly moved to Los Angeles, where he became National Promotion Director for Tetragrammaton Records. There, he represented acts such as John Lennon, Deep Purple, Joan Rivers and Tiny Tim.\n\t\n\n\tHe later became head of record production and artist signings at Mercury Records Hollywood before moving to Capitol Records as head of rock artists and repertoire, expanding his clientele to include Pink Floyd, Steve Miller and George Harrison among others. Then, he headed the management division at Far Out Music, overseeing the careers of War, Rick James and other prominent artists.\n\n\n\tCheen developed a reputation for managing live events and, after producing the first Pacific Rim Festival in Los Angeles, he was hired as a consultant for the People’s Republic of China’s Ministry of Culture and the Australian government’s Ausmusic. He moved to China for 13 years, and his company, InterStar Music, was the first Western music organization to enter a joint venture with China to distribute pop and rock music in Asia.\n\n\tThroughout his time in China, Cheen introduced American blues, jazz, and reggae to the country, touring with leading acts across Asia. Chinese musicians soon began adopting the Western styles and Cheen produced two Chinese reggae albums, a Chinese jazz album, and a Chinese country album. He also worked with groundbreaking Chinese rock band Tang Dynasty. \n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Cheen also lectured on the music industry across Asia and Australia. When he returned to the United States, he became VP of Business Development for BB King’s Blues Clubs. His InterStar Arts Alliance later transitioned to marketing for musicians and relocated to Charlotte, N.C., where he continued teaching the Business of Music at Catawba College. \n\n\tCheen founded the Charlotte Music Awards in 2006 and was a founding board member of the Hollywood Music in Media Awards. He was also a member of the Pacific Coast Group, which aims to help musical artists recoup royalties owed to them for their work in Asia.\n\n\tHe is survived by his wife, Chunghong, his two sons from an earlier marriage, Justin and Garrett, and his two grandchildren, Henry and Eva.\n\n\tThe family encourages gifts in Cheen’s honor be made to Autism Speaks.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFreestyle Digital Media has acquired the North American rights to “Yes Repeat No,” a drama exploring Israeli-Palestinian identity. The film releases Nov. 11 on North American VOD platforms and DVD. \n\n\t“Yes Repeat No” follows the story of three actors who are auditioning to play Juliano Mer-Khamis, a Palestinian-Jewish actor and activist who was assassinated in 2011 on the steps of the theater he founded in Jenin. Born to an anti-Zionist Jewish mother and a Palestinian Christian Communist father, Mer-Khamis became an internationally acclaimed actor who appeared in films including “The Little Drummer Girl” and “Miral,” and later began a career as a director, theater founder and a political activist.\n\t\n\n\t“Yes Repeat No” stars Salome Azizi (“The Director”), Mousa Kraish (“Arab Juliano”), Adam Meir (“Public Juliano”), and Karim Saleh (“Israeli Juliano”).\n\n\n\t“Because we made this film before October 7th, we could examine our collective, fraught history with nuance and compassion, without clinging to ‘sides.’ We want to build bridges rather than fan flames, and to challenge our viewers’ understanding of the conflict,” said filmmaker Michael Dahan. “By weaving direct quotes from Palestinian, Israeli, Arab and American leaders throughout the dialogue the film reveals how the meaning of words spoken by political figures such as Arafat, Netanyahu, and others have shifted over time. In a time of conflict, ‘Yes Repeat No’ insists on imagining a better future and encourages its audience to feel more understood and less alone.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film is written and directed by Dahan, who also serves as the film’s producer alongside N. Braxton Pope and Sarah Szalavitz.  \n\n\tWatch the trailer for “Yes Repeat No” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\t“Sinners” is determined to bring the blues to the Oscars.\n\n\tWarner Bros. has officially submitted two original songs from Ryan Coogler’s genre-defyi",
    "body": "\n\t“Sinners” is determined to bring the blues to the Oscars.\n\n\tWarner Bros. has officially submitted two original songs from Ryan Coogler’s genre-defying “Sinners” for consideration in the original song category at the Oscars, Variety has learned exclusively.\n\n\tThe first track, “I Lied to You,” is written by Raphael Saadiq and Ludwig Göransson and performed by rising star Miles Caton. The second, “Last Time (I Seen the Sun),” is a soulful duet performed by Alice Smith and Caton and co-written by Smith, Caton and Göransson.\n\t\n\n\tWhile it’s still early in Oscar season, many awards prognosticators expect one — or both — of the submissions to make the Academy’s shortlist of 15 original songs, expected in mid-December. From there, five will be nominated, as selected by the Academy’s music branch.\n\n\n\tUnder Academy rules, a film may submit up to three original songs for consideration. While all three may be shortlisted, only two can ultimately receive nominations. For “Sinners,” the creative team and strategists have opted not to over-submit — a move that comes with both risks and rewards. Consider the case of Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” which successfully submitted three songs: the Oscar-winning “What Was I Made For?” by Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell, the also-nominated “I’m Just Ken” and Dua Lipa’s “Dance the Night.” All three made the shortlist, but Lipa’s track did not make the final five nominations.\n\n\t“Sinners” is widely regarded as Coogler’s most personal film to date — a sweeping narrative that weaves together Black history, the migrant experience and the director’s own lineage into a powerful cinematic tapestry. Written and directed by Coogler, the film’s ambition has been embraced by both critics and audiences.\n\t\n\n\tCaton, who stars as young preacher Sammie Moore — a.k.a. “Preacherboy” — is considered a strong contender in the supporting actor category, alongside co-stars Delroy Lindo and Jack O’Connell. With the addition of a songwriting credit, Caton could follow a rare Oscars pathway of earning nominations in both acting and original song. Only four people have ever achieved that feat: Leslie Odom Jr. with “One Night in Miami” (2020) and “Speak Now,” Mary J. Blige with “Mudbound” (2017) and “Mighty River,” Lady Gaga with “A Star Is Born” (2018) and “Shallow,” and Cynthia Erivo with “Harriet” (2019) and “Stand Up.” Gaga remains the only winner for original song among them.\n\n\tThe ensemble cast also includes Michael B. Jordan, Hailee Steinfeld, Wunmi Mosaku, Li Jun Li, Omar Miller, Jayme Lawson and blues legend Buddy Guy.\n\n\tOn the technical side, “Sinners” boasts an Oscar-winning team behind the scenes. Two-time Academy Award winner Göransson — honored for “Black Panther” and “Oppenheimer” — is also a contender for original score. A third win in the category would place him among legends such as Maurice Jarre and Max Steiner — and make him the only composer to achieve three wins from just three nominations in that category. Göransson was also previously nominated in original song for the chart-topper “Lift Me Up” from “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” which he co-wrote with Coogler and Rihanna.\n\n\tThe film could also make history in several crafts categories. Production designer Hannah Beachler, the first Black person to win her category (for “Black Panther”), is again in the conversation, as is two-time costume design winner Ruth E. Carter — currently the only Black woman to win multiple Oscars. Another milestone looms for cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw, who could become just the fourth woman ever nominated in the category — following Rachel Morrison (“Mudbound”), Ari Wegner (“The Power of the Dog”) and Mandy Walker (“Elvis”) — and potentially the first to win.\n\n\tThe studio will submit “Sinners” in all major Oscar categories, including best picture (Zinzi Coogler, Sev Ohanian and Ryan Coogler), original screenplay and directing for Coogler — who, notably, would be vying for a spot in two categories that remain stubbornly underrepresented. Only one Black filmmaker — Jordan Peele for “Get Out” — has ever won for original screenplay, and no Black director has ever taken home the directing Oscar in the Academy’s 98-year history.\n\t\n\n\tThe song submissions add to the growing momentum for “Sinners,” which has been steadily building awards buzz since its premiere in April. The film recently received the Ensemble Tribute at the Gotham Awards, and Coogler was named the recipient of the Director Award at the Critics Choice Association’s Celebration of Black Cinema & Television. Jordan will be honored with the American Cinematheque Award on Nov. 21, followed by a career tribute at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival in February.\n\n\tIf “Sinners” makes good on its campaign promise, it could make Oscars history.\n\n\tThe full list of “Sinners” submissions is below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSINNERS, Michael B.

Atlanta's police chief said Cagle arrived at the airport just after 9 AM Monday after allegedly livestreaming he was going to \"shoot it up.\"\n      \n    \n          Cagle is now facing charges of possession of a firearm by a felon, criminal attempt to commit aggravated assault, and making terroristic threats.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Weapons & Guns\n              \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Live\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

CBP agents entered the El Paso residence with consent from the homeowner. While they were inside, the owner's dog, named Chop, \"aggressively charged [at] the agent\" and \"fearing for his safety, the officer discharged their firearm.\" DHS says its is currently reviewing the matter.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Through his attorney, Chop's owner, Seth Daw, says he's absolutely heartbroken over the sudden death of the family's 7-year-old Rottweiler because he believes the killing was \"senseless, cruel, and entirely avoidable.\"\n      \n    \n          The attorney, Marisa Ong, says \"Border Patrol agents entered a private home under the pretense of an investigation, took advantage of the homeowner's cooperation, and shot a restrained, non-threatening dog.\"\n      \n    \n          Ong also claims Seth warned the Border Patrol agent about Chop, and the agent put the canine in the bathroom for its own safety while the feds searched the rest of the home.\n      \n    \n          But, Ong says, Border Patrol dismissed the warning and opened the bathroom door, letting Chop out to get shot by the agent. CBP agents reportedly visited Seth's house after they received a tip about the home's previous owner.\n      \n    \n          Seth is now gearing up to file a lawsuit against the federal government over the death of poor ol' Chop.

He was also a sportscaster and host of HBO's acclaimed investigative series \"Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel\".\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          His older brother, Greg -- who was also a broadcaster, primarily in sports -- died last year at 78.\n      \n    \n          Story developing ...\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Today Show\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Nurse!\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tAmeer Fakher Eldin’s “Yunan” has won this year’s Arab Critics’ Award for European Films. The award, now in its seventh edition, is presented by European Film Promotion in collaboration with the Arab Cinema Center.\n\n\tThe announcement was made during the award ceremony at the El Gouna Film Festival on Saturday. Fakher Eldin, who was unable to attend the festival in person, sent a video message in which he thanked the jury, the ACC and EFP for what he called a “beautiful recognition.” He added: “To see ‘Yunan’ now embraced by Arab critics as well feels profoundly moving to me. In a way, maybe it means the film has finally found its way home.”\n\t\n\n\tFakher Eldin also expressed his gratitude to his main producer and longtime collaborator Dorothe Beinemeier of Red Balloon Film, who accepted the award in El Gouna.\n\n\n\tBeinemeier said, “ ’Yunan’ is Ameer Fakher Eldin’s second feature film. Like his first film ‘The Stranger,’ it is a slow, silent and melancholic piece. Ameer’s stories are not loud but told in the most subtle and poetic ways and are deeply touching. His films slow me down, they force me to take time and think and digest what I see. His films seem to transform every time I watch them. But what happens is that the films are so rich that I just find a new angle every time, another layer. Ameer is just a brilliant observer and storyteller, a very old and wise soul in a young man’s body. I am very much looking forward to producing the third film of our trilogy.”\n\n\t“Yunan” follows an Arab man who arrives on a remote island in the North Sea intending to end his life. Instead, he is confronted by its conservative, marginalized German community and the overwhelming force of nature, encounters that unsettle his resolve and gradually reshape his perspective. What begins as an act of solitude unfolds into an unexpected encounter with both people and places gradually evolving into a quiet yet intense philosophical exchange that unearths themes of displacement, trauma and renewal.\n\t\n\n\tThe film was part of this year’s Berlinale Competition and was awarded the Golden Firebird awards for best actor (Georges Khabbaz) and actress (Hanna Schygulla) at the Hong Kong Intl. Film Festival.\n\n\t“Yunan” was produced by Beinemeier at Red Balloon in Hamburg, Germany, together with Microclimat Film in Canada and Intramovies in Italy. Co-producers are Fresco Films, Metafora Productions and Tabi360. Its world sales are handled by Intramovies and Mad Solutions is handling MENA sales.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt the China box office for Oct. 17–19, “Row to Win” climbed to the top spot with RMB30.8 million ($4.3 million), according to consultancy Artisan Gateway. \n\n\tThe PMF Pictures release has reached $44.6 million since opening on Sept. 30. The comedy-drama directed by Ma Lin and starring Huang Bo, Fan Chengcheng, Yin Tao and Li Jiaqi, follows a coastal-town family – led by a once-tough patriarch – who rally together in hard times and push for a comeback. \n\t\n\n\t“The Volunteers: Peace at Last” (China Film Group) move to second with $3.6 million and has now earned $79.6 million.

The sequel to Lu Yang’s 2021 fantasy action hit, from Huace Pictures, continues the meta-narrative of intertwining fiction and reality, with Lei Jiayin reprising his role alongside Dong Zijian and Yang Mi. \n\n\tWeekend box office totaled $23.5 million, pushing China’s 2025 year-to-date gross to $6.146 billion, up 18.3% on the same period last year.

    "body": "\n\tThree decades after its Oct. 20, 1995 release, Aditya Chopra‘s “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge” continues to reign as India’s most beloved romantic film, with stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol reflecting on the historic blockbuster’s unprecedented cultural impact.\n\n\tThe Yash Raj Films production tells the story of Raj and Simran, two young British Indians who fall in love during a European vacation, only to face the challenge of winning over Simran’s traditional father. The film became a cultural phenomenon, notably holding the record for the longest continuous theatrical run at Mumbai’s Maratha Mandir cinema, where it continues to play to this day. \n\t\n\n\tKhan and Kajol’s portrayals of the iconic couple have become one of the definitive cinematic representations of love in Indian cinema, maintaining their status as a pop culture touchstone for South Asians worldwide.\n\n\n\t“It doesn’t feel like it’s been 30 years since ‘Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge’ released,” Khan says. “I’m truly grateful for all the love that I have received from people from across the world for playing Raj. Nobody could have foreseen the kind of place the film made in the hearts of people around the world.”\n\n\tThe actor notes the film’s real-world impact on audiences: “So many couples meet me and say we got married or fell in love after watching this film. I also feel that it has had such a happy effect on the pop culture of India and South Asians.”\n\n\tKhan credits the success to “the pure heart with which the film was made by us all, the clarity that Adi had about ‘DDLJ’ and especially because of the blessings of Yash ji [legendary filmmaker Yash Chopra, Aditya’s father and founder of Yash Raj Films].”\n\t\n\n\tKajol, reflecting on her iconic role as Simran, calls the milestone “surreal,” noting that “the film has aged into a legacy and a nostalgic experience for a generation.”\n\n\t“For me, Simran is a chapter that refuses to end,” she says. “She represents millions of girls across this country — girls who want to do what their parents say, who carry tradition in one hand but still reach out for freedom with the other. That’s why she still resonates.”\n\n\tKajol observes that the film has become intergenerational: “The viewers who adored this film at 16 are now watching it with their children, owning it more fiercely with every passing year. It’s become the template of how Indian cinema dreams of love.”\n\n\tDiscussing her chemistry with Khan, Kajol reveals: “With him, it was effortless from the first take. There’s a kind of understanding, a rhythm, and a trust that just clicks. You know exactly how the other person thinks, how they’ll react, how a look, a pause, or even silence will land.”\n\n\tShe attributes their on-screen magic to the natural chemistry: “We never had to overthink, over-plan, or try too hard. There is a lot of mutual respect and comfort in our equation. And I think audiences feel that; they sense authenticity, even if they don’t know the work behind it.”\n\n\tThe film’s themes of navigating family expectations, balancing tradition and modernity, and finding courage to follow one’s heart continue to resonate across generations. Kajol credits director Chopra’s vision for making “this idea of romance the nation’s biggest obsession,” noting that the film’s songs, dialogues and iconic imagery “seeped into pop culture and stayed there.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “A Still Small Voice,” the series finale of “Task,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tThroughout HBO’s “Task,” Maeve Prendergrast (Emilia Jones) is the audience’s eyes, after she discovers that her uncle, Robbie (Tom Pelphrey), is involved in a cat-and-mouse chase with both the FBI and a violent motorcycle gang called the Dark Hearts after killing two of the group’s members, and then kidnapping their son Sam (Ben Doherty) in the wake of their deaths. It’s Maeve who has to watch over Sam, knowing that at any given point, either the Dark Hearts or the FBI might find Robbie.\n\t\n\n\tAfter Robbie dies in Episode 6, Maeve finds herself at a standstill in processing the loss of her uncle, while also simultaneously figuring out how to survive with her niece and nephew after Robbie’s death. In the final moments of the penultimate episode, Maeve receives the bag of money that Robbie had been trying to hide before his death, giving her the opportunity to make a new life if she is able to get away from the Dark Hearts.\n\n\n\tWith the realization that the Dark Hearts are coming to find her, it’s down to the wire for Maeve and the rest of the Prendergrast family to hide the money, and get as far away from them as possible before it’s too late.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Peter Kramer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJones spoke with Variety about Maeve and Robbie’s family dynamic, how Robbie’s death affects Maeve throughout the series finale and staging the final fight scene with Jayson, the Dark Heart final boss (Sam Keeley).\n\t\n\t\tRobbie dies in Episode 6, and in the episode’s final moments, Maeve is given the bag of Robbie’s money at her doorstep. She realizes she’s the only person who knows the whereabouts of what the Dark Hearts are looking for, and leading into Episode 7, it’s a lot that she’s grappling with.\t\n\n\tMaeve has always been so clever, so the minute she has the bag of money in her hand, she’s like, “Who’s going to want this?” She knows that people are going to come after her and the kids. But, at the same time, she’s just happy that Robbie’s plan worked out. It’s a moment of very mixed emotions for her.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow does Robbie’s sacrifice change the way Maeve feels about him?\t\n\n\tFor a long time, Maeve was torn between feeling resentment towards Robbie and feeling so much love towards him. She’s had to pick up the pieces and be the strong adult figure in the relationship. When you first meet Maeve, she’s just so tired of picking up the pieces and cleaning up the mess that Robbie makes. At the end of the show, when Maeve realizes that Robbie sacrificed himself with this plan, and it worked out [because] he wouldn’t stop until it was successful, she has a lot of respect for him and she just knows that no matter whatever Robbie did, he was always thinking of other people. Even when he’s being questioned by Tom [Mark Ruffalo], Robbie’s like, “Please keep Maeve out of it.”\n\n\tRobbie really does have a heart of gold, and I think that’s what Brad [Ingelsby] does so well with the moral ambiguity. The bad guys can have good hearts and the good guys can have bad hearts. The scene with Grasso [Fabien Frankel] when he gives her the warning is a really good moment for his character, because it shows you that for all of his flaws, he’s learned from his mistakes. Same with Tom, and how he lets Maeve keep the money at the end.\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a scene in the first episode where Robbie and Maeve are talking on the porch, and we get more insight as to their family dynamic after her father’s death. There’s generational trauma that has been deep inside Robbie, and now Maeve. So how does her family’s past affect the decisions she makes throughout the season?\t\n\n\tShe hasn’t had the time or space to really mourn the loss of her father, and she’s been pushing it deeper and deeper inside of her and blocking it out. The scene on the porch that you mentioned is a really important scene for Maeve, because it’s the first time that she really says what she’s feeling. No matter what you throw at Maeve, she takes it, because she’s tough. It’s the first time for Robbie when he realizes that there’s this 21-year-old girl standing in front of him asking for help after she lost her father. That’s why Robbie’s death is so hard for her to deal with, because Jayson killed her dad and her uncle.\n\t\n\t\tThe finale has a final showdown at the Prendergrast house, where Jayson has discovered that Maeve has the bag of money hidden somewhere. What was it like staging that final scene with Sam Keeley and the rest of the cast?\t\n\n\tIt was exciting! I was crossing over with characters that I hadn’t really fully crossed over with before. We were all aware that it was the climax of the show, and there was immense pressure for us because we wanted to make sure that we could do it the best that we could. We did all of our own stunts, and it was so much fun and challenging because I was using my body in ways I’d never used it before. Sam is such an intense actor and throws himself in. It was really great to bounce off of. The scene after we’re in the chicken coop and Maeve gets away and Jayson grabs her back, I was really trying to run away, and he was really trying to grab me, and we just kept going on filming because the team wanted to let the scene play out for as long as possible.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a scene where Maeve is looking at the money in the finale, where she says that Robbie would have wanted the family to have it so that they could have a better life. At the very end of the episode, Maeve and the kids have moved out of the house and are on their way to a new destination. What do you like to imagine that Maeve’s “better life” would be?\t\n\n\tI hope that she can build a nice, comfortable environment for her and the kids, and give them the life that they deserve after such a hard start. I also really hope that she can kind of do things for herself for once, since she’s so young and her whole kind of younger years have been shouldering so much adult responsibility. I hope that with Robbie’s help and the money, she can really start to think about herself and put herself and the kids first, and they can have a really comfortable life where she doesn’t have to worry.\n\t\n\t\tThis is your first time working with Brad Ingelsby, so if you could return back to work with him on a future project, what genre would you like to see him explore next?\t\n\n\tI would do anything for Brad. His writing is so authentic and nuanced, and he’s just so lovely. “Task” is a crime show, but with love, loss, family and forgiveness, and all of these relatable and intense themes, but, with a whole lot of action, so it’s a little bit for everyone. Every character has such a layered backstory, and if any Brad Ingelsby project was to come to me again, I would absolutely jump at the chance to work with him again.\n\t\n\t\tI also learned that while you were filming “Task” in Philadelphia, you saw Olivia Rodrigo in concert with Fabien Frankel and some of the crew during your downtime. \t\n\n\tOh my god, we did! You know what’s sad? Mark arranged the whole concert and got everyone the tickets, and he created a group chat and was like “Guys, we’re gonna go meet her after,” and then he had to work! Mark had to go film for “Task,” so everyone else got to go to Olivia Rodrigo after he had literally organized the whole thing! Fabien and I got all of the merchandise, and he had the purple sunglasses with the Olivia Rodrigo tour T-shirt. He’s such an Olivia fan, and he was singing all the words to “Vampire.”\n\n\t“Task” is quite dark in places, so it was just so nice to go to an Olivia Rodrigo concert on the weekend and switch off for a second during filming. It was such a great experience.\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following article discusses plot details from Season 1, Episode 2 of “The Chair Company,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tIt’s not easy to upstage Tim Robinson. The comedian’s signature character is a man whose social unease leads him to act out in big, loud, obnoxious ways — like the hot dog guy from the sketch series “I Think You Should Leave,” or Marvel enthusiast Craig Waterman in the film “Friendship.” Ron Trosper, the protagonist of Robinson’s HBO conspiracy comedy “The Chair Company,” is no exception to this rule. But in Ron’s quest to find out what’s going on with Tecca, the namesake manufacturer of a faulty chair that leads the mall developer to take an embarrassing tumble in front of his colleagues, he encounters many characters who more than match his eccentricities. People like a certain shirt salesman who pitches Ron on his membership program.\n\t\n\n\tIn the second episode of “The Chair Company,” Ron visits the menswear shop Tamblay’s in an attempt to identify his assailant from the series premiere, who warned Ron to stop looking into Tecca before running off and leaving an article of clothing behind as a clue. The Tamblay’s proprietor agrees to help him out, confirming the shirt is one of theirs. The owner even models the item’s wear and tear using a ball he happens to have on hand: “It’s like a big belly and someone’s belly is pushin’ up into the buttons,” the man explains. “He’s about at his limit. I happen to know a guy who’s at his limit.” The emphases, cadence and delivery of this seemingly mundane dialogue combine to make the viewer sit up and ask themselves: Who is that?\n\t\n\n\tThe actor, it turns out, didn’t have to do much to get into character. Jared Lindner is the real-life co-proprietor of Suit Man, a small business located in the Westchester County suburb of Mount Vernon, New York. Lindner’s father founded the store nearly two decades ago, and the two still run Suit Man as a family operation. (You can learn more about the store in this video on the small city’s official YouTube channel.) Robinson himself took notice of Lindner when he swung by the store to scout the location. Lindner didn’t recognize the “Saturday Night Live” alum, but struck up a rapport with the crew: “They started to chuckle, because I’m a pretty easygoing, somewhat young guy,” Lindner tells Variety. The next thing he knew, the production was calling to offer him the part.\n\n\tLindner is patching into our interview directly from Suit Man, where the racks of shirts, ties and socks appear exactly as they do in “The Chair Company.” (During our conversation, Lindner walks around the store, iPhone in hand; at one point, a pair of hands appeared from offscreen to adjust his collar for the Zoom camera.) Lindner’s distinctive voice, a Christopher Walken-esque blend of New York accent, long vowels and soft tone, is also identical to the one that appears in the show. The only real difference is that the actual Lindner is wearing a baseball cap — and instead of helping Robinson’s protagonist with a mystery, he’s singing the praises of the real Robinson to a reporter.\n\n\t“It’s unbelievable how good they are,” Lindner says of Robinson, his creative partner Zach Kanin and their collaborators. “They took someone who had no idea what to do and made me feel comfortable enough to not be nervous,” despite the dozens of crew members crowding into the Suit Man space. Lindner had never so much as read a script before making his acting debut on HBO, but credits Robinson and his team with making him feel at ease. \n\n\t“I think of it like sports,” Lindner says. “When a good team has a very good manager and head coach, they don’t need to yell. They don’t need to tell you what to do. They’re respected enough that everyone has the common goal to just get it done and make them happy.”\n\n\tDirector Andrew DeYoung first worked with Robinson on “Friendship” before coming aboard “The Chair Company” as an executive producer. Though the idea of casting Lindner came from Robinson, DeYoung didn’t require much persuasion. (HBO asked that Lindner at least read for the network before giving the green light, but he quickly came aboard.) “I was chatting with Jared and was like, ‘This guy is so unique and interesting,’” DeYoung recalls. “There’s something about him and his way of being that’s rare and captivating in the sweetest way possible. No one’s making fun of anybody at all, and I hope that’s clear.”\n\t\n\n\tThough a total acting novice like Lindner is an extreme example of its casting strategy, “The Chair Company” generally avoided big names and recognizable faces when populating its strange, extreme world. Besides Robinson, Lake Bell and Sophia Lillis — who play Ron’s wife and daughter, respectively — are probably the best-known series regulars. Everyone else is much less likely to come with pre-existing associations for the audience, which is precisely the point.\n\n\t“There’s an excitement when you don’t have the baggage of somebody that you know,” DeYoung explains. “There are so many brilliant people out there that are trying to be performers — or, in Jared’s case, not — who show up and electrify the screen because they bring something special and unique.” That’s what appeals to him, Robinson and Kanin about figures like Lindner, who can make such an impression in such a short span of time. “What’s beautiful about Tim and Zach [is], even if a character has one line, they feel incredibly rich,” DeYoung says. “That, to me, is so exciting. When you have those specificities, a character shows up and you’re like, ‘I would like to follow them.’ It feels like we’re living in a world that goes beyond the screen.” As “The Chair Company” works to build an entire immersive universe where Ron’s paranoid logic makes a certain kind of sense, it’s helpful to cast figures like Lindner who carry an ingrained sense of authenticity.\n\n\tSuit Man may not have a membership program like Tamblay’s, or an accompanying group chat with five separate guys named Ron in it. But Lindner stresses that he always strives for recurring business. “I always say when a gentleman comes in to see me, I don’t want to sell them one sweater and then never see them again,” he says. “I’d rather sell them a sweater for their wedding, and then their son’s christening, and their other daughter’s baptism, or whatever it is. We’ve made lifelong friends. They’re not even customers.” Even though Lindner says he’s open to acting again after having such a good experience with “The Chair Company,” he’s not abandoning his day job.\n\n\tWhen we spoke, Lindner hadn’t yet gotten the chance to watch his own performance, though he has gone back and watched Robinson’s Comedy Central series “Detroiters” to get a sense of what he might expect from the final product. The prospect of introducing himself to a mass audience is the first time in our conversation where even a hint of actorly self-consciousness comes up. “I hope I don’t make a fool out of myself in front of my wife,” Lindner says. “Everybody told me that I did okay, but I guess I’ll have to see for myself on Sunday.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRose Byrne (“Spy,” “Bridesmaids”) took home the Best Actress award for her role in Mary Bronstein’s “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” at Europe’s preeminent genre film fest, the Sitges – International Fantastic Film Festival of Catalonia, which wrapped its 58th edition on Oct. 19.\n\n\tThe A24 release is described by Variety critic Peter Debruge as “a virtuosic portrait of mental unraveling that uses every tool in the director’s arsenal to re-create an end-of-the-world feeling on the most intimate scale,” where Byrne delivers “a feverish, raw-nerve performance sure to go down as one of the year’s greats.”\n\t\n\n\tThe festival crowned “The Ugly Stepsister” (“Den stygge stesøsteren”) by Norway’s Emilie Blichfeldt with the Best Feature Film prize while South Korea’s Park Chan-wook snagged the Best Director Award for his dark comedy thriller, “No Other Choice,” based on Donald E. Westlake’s crime novel, “The Ax.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Ugly Stepsister, Courtesy of Sitges Film Festival \n\t\n\n\n\n\tHailed by Variety as a “deliciously extreme take on the beloved ‘Cinderella’ legend, complete with broken noses, severed toes and other gory details befitting the Grimm Bros.” “The Ugly Stepsister” delivers a body horror twist on the fairy tale, which centers on stepsister Elvira, who goes to painfully extraordinary lengths to fit the kingdom’s standards of beauty.\n\n\tMeanwhile, the entire cast of “The Plague,” by newcomer Charlie Polinger, comprising Joel Edgerton, Everett Blunck, Kayo Martin, Lucas Adler and Kenny Rasmussen, shared Best Actor. The psychological drama follows a socially awkward 12-year-old who is relentlessly bullied in an all-boy water polo camp.\n\t\n\n\tBacked by “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” producer Bill Kong and bringing together what Variety described as “maybe the most formidable collection of Asian action talent since Hong Kong’s golden age,” “The Furious,” from action choreographer-turned-director Tanigaki Kenji, scooped Sitges’ Special Jury Award, Sitges’ effective runner-up prize. \n\n\tIt shared that plaudit with “Obsession,” a low-budget twisted love horror film from YouTube breakout and first-time director Curry Barker that has just caught attention by being picked up by Focus Features for $14 million. “Obsession” also won Sitges’ coveted People’s Choice Award.\n\n\t“The Ugly Stepsister” bowed at Sundance’s Midnight Strand; “The Furious” and “Obsession” world premiered at Toronto’s Midnight Madness, a sign of how some of the best and most market-attractive movies at both festivals are now screening in their genre sections.  \n\n\tEqually, the Sitges Film Festival’s industry star is rising as sales agents in Europe identify upscale genre as one of the most market-worthy of film types on a highly difficult international distribution scene.  \n\n\tThe festival had its share of stars that included Benedict Cumberbatch, Luc Besson, Carmen Maura and producer Gale Ann Hurd who received Sitges’ Woman in Fan Grand Honorary Award.\n\n\tThe coveted Blood Window prize, from the most important platform for genre cinema in Latin America, went to Mexico’s Emilio Portes (“Belzebuth,” “Pastorela”) for his nightmarish suspense drama (especially for parents), “Don’t Leave the Kids Alone.”\n\n\t“After screening our previous film, ‘Belzebuth,’ at Sitges 2017, returning to the 58th Edition was a wonderful déjà vu, spiced with old friends, new flabbergasting films, great parties and sight-seeing movie legends in such a magic town. But winning the Blood Window Award with ‘Don’t Leave the Kids Alone,’ is a sweet nightmare come true. We are beyond happy,” Portes told Variety.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEmilio Portes, Don’t Leave the Kids Alone \n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Once again, the Sitges Film Festival—the most important genre festival in the world—has partnered with Blood Window to recognize Latin American talent,” said Morbido Group founder/CEO Pablo Guisa, “A key point for me is that this film had its world premiere at Rotterdam, a major non-genre festival, and then won at Sitges. This shows that Latin American genre film is being recognized by both genre-specific and mainstream festivals, which is a win for all of Latin horror.”\n\t\n\n\t“Emilio Portes has been committed to genre filmmaking for a long time. His films “Conozca la cabeza de Juan Pérez,” “Pastorela,” “Belzebuth,” and now this one—are proof of his dedication, and I’m happy to see his work gaining this recognition,” he told Variety, adding: “Blood Window is now more alive than ever. With a presence at Cannes and Sitges, and activities in Mexico with Morbido, it reflects the incredible moment Latin American horror is currently experiencing. This success is due, in part, to Blood Window’s steadfast support over the last decade.” \n\n\t“Don’t Leave the Kids Alone” was indeed not the only prize for Latin American genre filmmaking with “The Virgin of the Quarry Lake,” an Argentina-Spain-Mexico produduction directed by Laura Casabé, taking Best Cinematography for Diego Tenorio.  \n\n\tThe 58th Sitges Film Festival ran Oct. 9 – 19.\n\n\tOFFICIAL COMPETITION WINNERS\n\n\tBest Feature Film\n\n\t“The Ugly Stepsister,” Emilie Blichfeldt \n\n\tSpecial Jury Award\n\n\t(ex aequo)\n\n\t“The Furious,” Kenji Tanigaki\n\n\t“Obsession,” Curry Barker \n\n\tBest Director\n\n\tPark Chan-wook, “No Other Choice”\n\n\t Best Actress\n\n\tRose Byrne, “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”\n\n\t Best Actor\n\n\tThe entire cast of “The Plague”\n\n\tBest Screenplay\n\n\t“A Useful Ghost,” de Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke\n\n\t Best Cinematography \n\n\tDiego Tenorio, “La virgen de la tosquera”\n\n\t Best Music\n\n\tYasutaka Nakata & Shouhei Amimori, “Exit 8”\n\n\t Best Special, Visual or Makeup Effects\n\n\tTenille Shockey & François Dagenais, “Honey Bunch” \n\n\tNEW VISIONS\n\n\tBest Film\n\n\t(ex aequo)\n\n\t“Lesbian Space Princess,” Emma Hough Hobbs & Leela Varghese\n\n\t“The True Beauty of Being Bitten by a Tick,” Pete Ohs\n\n\t Best Director\n\n\t(ex aequo)\n\n\tAdam C.

    "body": "\n\tNo one would have expected Taylor Swift‘s “The Life of a Showgirl” to lose its grip on the album chart in week 2, and it indeed held on at the top of the Billboard 200, with 338,000 equivalent album units in its second week out. \n\n\tLast week, Swift set a record in the Luminate/Soundscan-era data-keeping books with 4.002 million units. Although this week’s figure marked a predictably significant drop-off from that record-buster, even the second week for “Showgirl” ranked as the fifth best week for any album this year, per Billboard and Luminate. The only albums that had a higher number than 338,000 units in a single frame this year were first-week figures for releases from Wallen (who opened with 493,000), the Weeknd (who started with 490,000), Sabrina Carpenter (which started with 366K) and, of course, Swift’s own debut tally.\n\t\n\n\tBreaking down that 338K figure for Swift’s second week, 101,000 of those units came in the form of pure album sales, Billboard reported. That sales figure represented the biggest drop for “Showgirl” in week 2, down 97%, after a first week that included all the pre-sales for the album, plus a number of release-week-only variants. Nonetheless, 101,000 is a pure-sales figure that few contemporary albums ever reach in a week, and “Showgirl” had little competition in easily standing atop Billboard’s separate Top Album Sales chart for a second week. \n\n\n\tStreaming had a stronger hold, down from the juggernaut first-week figure by only 55%. The album’s tracks picked up a still-staggering 307.59 million on-demand official streams, which calculated out in the chart formula to 236,000 SEA (streaming equivalent album) units. Needless to say, “Showgirl” didn’t have any challengers in returning to No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Streaming Albums chart.\n\t\n\n\tWallen’s “I’m the Problem” spent a dozen nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 this year. That’s a run at the top of the Billboard 200 that Swift will no doubt be hoping to match in the coming months. Looking at the release schedule, it appears as if there won’t be a lot standing in the way of an extended reign, as there are no further obvious pop blockbusters currently scheduled to come out between now and the end of 2025, barring any last-minute surprises from a superstar.\n\n\tWith no music stars interested in putting albums out right now in Swift’s shadow, there were no new entries in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 for the week ending Oct. 10.\n\n\tThe only relatively fresh blood on the chart is in Olivia Dean’s “The Art of Loving,” which debuted at No. 8 two weeks ago, then rose one spot to No. 7 last week, and is up yet one more spot to No. 6 in week 3. The latest weekly tally for the album is 36,000 equivalent album units, up 5% from the previous week.\n\n\tEverything else in the top 10 is very familiar fare — perhaps overly familiar, for some tastes. Following Swift near the top of the list are the “KPop Demon Hunters” soundtrack at No. 2 (104,000 units), Wallen’s “I’m the Problem” at No. 3 (79,000 units), Cardi B’s “Am I the Drama?” in fourth place (50,000) and Sabrina Carpenter’s “Man’s Best Friend” in the No. 5 spot (45,000)\n\n\tFollowing Dean at No. 6 are Bad Bunny’s “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS” in seventh place (33,000 units), SZA’s “SOS” at No. 8 (32,000), Alex Warren’s “You’ll Be Alright, Kid” — not to be confused with Swift’s “You’re on Your Own, Kid,” of course — at No. 9 (32,000) and, finally, a second Wallen mega-seller, “One Thing at a Time,” in 10th place (31,000).\n\n\tResults for the Hot 100 will come in Monday, with Swift’s “The Fate of Ophelia” expected to repeat at the top there as well.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“God Save the King” has never been the loveliest or most melodic of national anthems, and its somewhat chiding, aggressive tenor is brought to the fore early in “The Choral.” Upon delivery of some good news from the front in the grim midst of the First World War, an English village choir’s lusty, spontaneous rendition of the song disrupts their rather shabbier rehearsal of Edward Elgar’s complex, haunting oratorio “The Dream of Gerontius,” prompting refined choirmaster Dr. Henry Guthrie (Ralph Fiennes) to roll his eyes to the back of his head. “If only you sang Elgar with the confidence you sing the national anthem,” he mutters. Art counts for a lot more than patriotism to Guthrie, and the happy surprise of Nicholas Hytner‘s film — despite its twee, veddy English trappings — is that it largely takes his side.\n\t\n\n\tPerhaps that’s not such a surprise. “The Choral” is, after all, the first original screenplay in over 40 years by Alan Bennett, a 91-year-old national treasure whose place in the British cultural firmament has never been tidily defined: A queer, agnostic, working-class Northerner, he’s a staunch royalist who declined a knighthood, and whose politics have traveled along a spectrum he once described as “conservative socialism.” Many of those contrasts and conflicts are present in “The Choral” — some for better, some for worse, but quite interestingly in all cases — even if Hytner, the director who previously filmed Bennett’s scripts for “The Madness of King George,” “The History Boys” and “The Lady in the Van,” gives the overall package a deceptively buttery gloss of tea-and-crumpets nostalgia.\n\t\n\n\tAt first glance, the film seems a twinkly fusion of two brands of British feelgood crowdpleaser: the keep-calm-and-carry-on portrait of wartime resilience, and the let’s-put-on-a-show underdog story, like “The Full Monty” with the radio dial tuned to “Land of Hope and Glory” rather than “You Sexy Thing.” The year is 1916, the setting the picturesque (and fictional) Yorkshire mill town of Ramsden — the rolling hills and cobbled, honey-filtered streets of which seem safely sheltered from the war raging over on the Continent, but for its depleting effect on the town’s young menfolk. With each wave of conscription, they depart from the town’s quaint train station, bright-eyed and crisply uniformed, only to return embittered and incomplete, if at all.\n\n\tUntil his own name is called, 17-year-old postboy Lofty (Oliver Briscombe) spends his days delivering messages of tragedy to newly bereaved women around Ramsden, though his randy pal Ellis (Taylor Uttley) looks on the bright side: “Grief, it’s an opportunity,” he says cheerily. There’s an opportunity for the boys, too, in the village chorus, sorely deprived by the draft of male voices — and soon its young choirmaster too. Enter Guthrie, an urbane, prodigious conductor formerly of some renown, though much disapproved of by the locals on several counts, not least among them the fact that he spent several years living and studying in Germany. His unapologetic atheism doesn’t help; nor do further “peculiarities” that nobody precisely wants to name. “Let’s just say I’d prefer a family man,” says priggish board member Duxbury (Roger Allam), and leaves it at that.\n\n\tGuthrie’s gayness remains more or less covert throughout Bennett’s script, though Fiennes plays him with a typically graceful, understated air of melancholy, his mourning turned inward for loves and lovers he can never name. There are unanswered overtures from the choir’s pianist Horner (Robert Emms), a soft, vulnerable young man whose conscientious-objector status renders him a fellow outsider. But “The Choral” is more preoccupied with the romantic lives of its younger characters, as Ellis, Lofty and their fellow teen soldiers-to-be desperately seek to lose their virginities before potentially losing their lives. Those in their sights include Mary (Amara Okereke), a golden-voiced Salvation Army officer yet to loosen so much as one button, and Bella (Emily Fairn), a pluckier sort anxiously awaiting the return of her wounded boyfriend Clyde (heartbreaking ensemble standout Jacob Dudman), though perhaps not equipped to nurse his trauma. \n\t\n\n\tBennett’s script flits inconsistently between generations, foregrounding certain perspectives before they suddenly recede, though the film is never less than diverting — with Guthrie’s ambitious plan to stage Elgar’s elevated work (with an off-key choir and a three-person orchestra) lending proceedings a satisfying narrative thrust. If it doesn’t culminate in the against-the-odds artistic triumph you might expect, there’s a more nuanced, honest moral here in favor of artistic aspiration, integrity and compromise all at once, via a hilariously deflating, supercilious cameo from Simon Russell Beale as Elgar himself.\n\n\tBut then the film is best when it chafes quietly against our expectations of gentle British comfort viewing, whether sharing in Guthrie’s dry exasperation at demonstrations of national pride, or eschewing dewy romanticism for its sole, unlikely sex scene: a passionless, reluctant handjob on the moors, discreetly depicted but tenderly illustrative of bodies and souls broken by war and English reserve. There are ugly open wounds in “The Choral,” even if they’ve been carefully and handsomely dressed by Mike Eley’s pristine, wheaty lensing, George Fenton’s luxurious scoring and Jenny Beavan’s perfectly pressed costumes. At its best, Bennett’s writing cuts through the gauze.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKorean film “The World of Love” has secured a Chinese distribution deal with Light Films Limited, marking a significant breakthrough in a market that has been largely closed to Korean cinema for nearly a decade.\n\n\tThe acquisition by Light Films Limited represents a rare achievement in the current landscape, as “Oh! My Gran” was the only Korean film to receive an official Chinese theatrical release in the past 10 years, when it opened in 2021.\n\t\n\n\tThe Chinese distributor specializes in arthouse cinema, with a track record of curating international film festival standouts. Its notable acquisitions include Kim Do-young’s “Kim Ji-Young: Born 1982,” Kore-eda Hirokazu’s “Nobody Knows,” and Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite.”\n\n\n\t“The perspective of this feminist film is refreshingly new,” said Li Na, CEO of Light Films. “While it explores trauma and its lasting impact, its underlying tone is warm and uplifting, which makes it all the more moving and encouraging.”\n\n\tDirected by Yoon Ga-eun, acclaimed for “The World of Us” (Berlinale 2016) and “The House of Us” (BFI London 2019), the drama centers on 17-year-old Lee Jooin (Seo Su-bin), an unpredictable high school student whose angry outburst creates ripple effects throughout her world.\n\n\tThe film world premiered at the Toronto Film Festival and took home both the Roberto Rossellini Awards Jury Prize and the People’s Choice Award in the Pingyao International Film Festival‘s Crouching Tigers section. Chinese interest surged following the festival’s Asian premiere, with strong buzz and reviews from local audiences on platforms including Douban. \n\t\n\n\t“The World of Love” also won the Fipresci Prize at the Warsaw Film Festival. \n\n\tThe film is produced by Semosi and Vol Media, with Barunson E&A — the South Korean studio behind Oscar-winning “Parasite” and Kim Jee-woon’s Cannes title “Cobweb” — serving as both presenting studio and sales agent.\n\n\tThe Chinese deal joins previously announced distribution agreements with veteran Japanese distributor Bitters End, Hong Kong’s Edko Films, and Taiwan’s Andrews Film across key Asian territories.\n",

    "body": "The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures hosted its fifth annual gala at the Academy Museum in Los Angeles last night in support of the museum’s education initiatives, public programming and future exhibitions. This year’s Gala raised over $12 million in donations for the general public and the local community of Los Angeles. \nThe gala was presented in partnership with Rolex, a founding supporter and official watch partner of the Academy Museum. The gala was co-chaired by Jon M. Chu, Common, Viola Davis, Julius Tennon, Robert Downey Jr., Susan Downey, Jennifer Hudson and Academy Museum Trustee Alejandro Ramírez Magaña.\nThe event honored four important voices in the entertainment industry for their contributions to film, both past and present. The first presenter of the night was Wim Wenders, who presented director Walter Salles with the Luminary Award. The Vantage Award was presented by Jon M. Chu to actor and comedian Bowen Yang, alongside Zoe Saldaña, who presented the Icon Award to actress Penélope Cruz during the night. The final award, the inaugural Legacy Award, was presented by Martin Scorsese to musician Bruce Springsteen. \nGeorge Clooney introduced a musical performance by Bruce Springsteen, where he closed out the event singing “Streets of Philadelphia,” “Atlantic City” and “Land of Hope and Dreams.”\nThe Icon, Legacy, Luminary and Vantage Awards were designed by the Haas Brothers and fabricated by UAP. The awards are solid cast bronze, hand-polished, hand-stamped and triple plated in nickel, copper and 24k gold.  \nThe event design was conceived by Keith Baptista, with talent relations overseen by Special Projects. \nSee the best looks from the 2025 Academy Gala below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCharli xcx\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCharli xcx wears YSL.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKim Kardashian\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKim Kardashian wears Maison Margiela by Glenn Marten.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJacob Elordi\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJacob Elordi wears Bottega Veneta.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOlivia Rodrigo\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOlivia Rodrigo wears Armani Privé.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSelena Gomez\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSelena Gomez attends the Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJenna Ortega\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJenna Ortega wears Grace Ling.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRachel Zegler\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRachel Zegler wears Tamara Ralph.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDamson Idris\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/WWD\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDamson Idris wears DIDRIS Jewelry at the Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRachel Sennott\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRachel Sennott wears Balenciaga.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAyo Edebiri\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAyo Edebiri wears Chanel.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tElle Fanning\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/WWD\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tElle Fanning wears Balenciaga.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHailey Bieber\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHailey Bieber wears Schiaparelli.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tViola Davis\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/WWD\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tViola Davis wears Gucci.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGreta Lee\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/WWD\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGreta Lee wears Dior.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDemi Moore and Lucy Liu\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDemi Moore and Lucy Liu attend the Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMilly Alcock\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMilly Alcock wears Harris Reed.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMikey Madison\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/WWD\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMikey Madison wears Dior.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMartin and Francesca Scorsese\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMartin and Francesca Scorsese attend the Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSydney Sweeney\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSydney Sweeney wears Giorgio Armani.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSeth Rogen and Lauren Miller Rogen\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSeth Rogen and Lauren Miller Rogen attend the Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

Mahomes clearly yells out \"This f***ing never f***ing works man\" and stays fully upright -- apparently overcome with frustration to the point he's gesturing toward his sideline in anger.\n      \n    \n          He then crouches again ... and actually runs a play -- a run up the middle by Kareem Hunt for the first down!\n      \n    \n      \n      It’s a Mahomes kind of morning 👋 pic.twitter.com/CNJrwAJULg— Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) October 19, 2025\n              @Chiefs\n          \n  \n    \n          Mahomes is a pro ... so we seriously doubt he was pissed off about the play. More likely he's hoping to win the ESPY For \"Best Leading Actor\" at next year's ceremony.\n      \n    \n          The Chiefs decimated an abysmal Raiders squad 31-0. The win moves the Chiefs up to 4-3 this season; the Raiders will fall to 2-5 with the loss.\n      \n    \n          Looks like Patrick's adding a little insult to injury with this one ... 'cause no matter what plan Mahomes runs, it tends to work anyway.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Patrick Mahomes\n              \n                          \n                Kansas City Chiefs\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                NFL\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

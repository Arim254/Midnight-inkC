    "body": "\n\tFarhan Akhtar‘s war epic “120 Bahadur” will make cinematic history with an unprecedented screening at the Rezang La War Memorial Auditorium in Chushul village, Ladakh, marking what organizers claim is the highest-altitude film release ever at 16,452 feet.\n\n\tThe film centers on the Battle of Rezang La, the 1962 conflict in which 120 Indian soldiers of Charlie Company, 13 Kumaon Regiment, fought Chinese forces at an altitude of over 16,000 feet in Ladakh, with 114 soldiers killed in action.\n\t\n\n\tThe screening on Nov. 22 will bring the film to soldiers and local residents near the site of the battle, just days after its 63rd anniversary on Nov. 18. Mobile theater company PictureTime will host 14 shows at the memorial auditorium for military personnel serving in the region and villagers.\n\n\n\t“We are going to show the film at Rezang La memorial auditorium in Chushul village, which is next to the mountain pass where the war was fought,” said Sushil Chaudhary, founder-CEO of PictureTime, who will be on site amid harsh minus-10-degree Celsius conditions. “This is going to be the highest altitude screening for any film. We are proud that the story of this incredible bravery will be witnessed by the villagers and soldiers on the big screen. We will show the film for at least two weeks.”\n\n\tThe mountain premiere follows the recent announcement that “120 Bahadur” will become the first film to release across India’s defense theaters. In partnership with GenSync Brat Media, PictureTime will screen the film exclusively for the defence community in over 800 cinema halls nationwide starting Nov. 21.\n\t\n\n\tThe initiative represents PictureTime’s latest effort to expand cinema access beyond traditional venues. The company is currently operating an inflatable theater at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa, screening titles including Shah Rukh Khan classics and contemporary films through Nov. 28.\n\n\tThe ensemble cast includes Akhtar, Raashii Khanna, Sparsh Walia, Vivan Bhatena, Dhanveer Singh, Digvijay Pratap, Sahib Verma, Ankit Siwach, Devendra Ahirwar, Ashutosh Shukla, Brijesh Karanwal, Atul Singh, Ajinkya Deo and Eijaz Khan.\n\n\tRazneesh “Razy” Ghai directs.

    "body": "\n\tEros Innovation has closed approximately $150 million in capital and strategic acquisitions as the company accelerates its transformation into an AI-driven media and entertainment platform valued at $2 billion.\n\n\tThe transactions include a $50 million primary investment led by Plenitude Capital and approximately $100 million in creative and technology acquisitions spanning film, music and AI-related assets.\n\n\n\tThe funding round, advised by Greenback Capital at the Dubai International Financial Centre, will fuel expansion of Eros Innovation’s AI infrastructure, development of immersive content formats and growth of its intellectual property portfolios. The company operates with over $1 billion in assets, zero external debt and positive free cash flow.\n\t\n\n\t“We are building the sovereign creative infrastructure of the future — where content, capital, and computation converge to deliver intelligent and ethical entertainment to billions of people,” said Kishore Lulla, founder and chair of Eros Innovation.\n\n\tCentral to the company’s strategy is Eros GenAI, a proprietary multimodal foundation-model platform trained on 1.5 trillion cinematic, musical, behavioral and cultural tokens.

    "body": "\n\tFor the first time in conjunction with the CMA Awards, Variety set up shop just off Nashville’s Music Row and invited participants from Wednesday’s awards show to come by for on-camera conversation. It was our chance to get off the red carpet and into greater depth with nominees, performers and presenters including Lauren Alaina, Dan + Shay, Jordan Davis, Brandon Lake, Megan Moroney, Old Dominion, the Red Clay Strays, Shaboozey, the War & Treaty and Stephen Wilson Jr.\n\t\n\n\tOur conversations took place at the Variety Lounge presented by Duke Cannon, hosted by one of Nashville’s most intriguing new event spaces, Anzie Blue. Read on and click on the videos to see what the stars had to say not just about their CMAs Week excitement but their latest or upcoming projects.\n\n\tShaboozey and Stephen Wilson Jr.: The awards show found the duo offering the first television performance of “Took a Walk,” their end-titles theme song from the filmic Stephen King adaptation “Long Walk Home.” Wilson also landed a second appearance on the telecast, singing his version of the Ben E. King classic “Stand by Me” that appeared on the deluxe version of his “Son of Dad” album … another Stephen King connection, actually.\n\n\tSaid Wilson, “He and I met a couple years ago, actually at a CMA after-party, and it was right before he started taking off. He stopped me and he had heard a song or two of mine and was like, ‘You’re a bad dude.’ And I was like, ‘You’re a bad dude… good dude.’ And then two years later, he asked me to be a part of this song. What’s wild is, I started singing this song called ‘Stand by Me’ because of this movie called ‘Stand By Me,’ based off a Stephen King novella called ‘The Body.’ It’s haunted me my whole life, that song, and I sang it in this dude’s basement and it blew up online. So a big reason why I have a career is because of that song ‘Stand by Me’ and it’s because of Stephen King. … I couldn’t have planned this if I tried. It’s a God thing.” \n\n\tSaid Shaboozey: “I met him and I was like, ‘Has anyone told you you look like Stephen King?’ That’s the first thing I said to him… And that came full circle to being like, ‘You know what? We should get Stephen Wilson.’ Something in my gut was like, ‘This is the person we gotta get on this song.’ And brother, you blew me out of the water.”\n\n\tThe Red Clay Strays: Pollstar magazine recently put this band on the cover and called them the next big touring thing. They’ve come up in the world since signing their first major-label deal just a couple of years ago, although they’d been knocking around in clubs, to far less notice, for nearly a decade before that. They haven’t revealed their full 2026 tour plans yet, but besides being on the bill for Stagecoach, they did just announce they’ll be playing at Madison Square Garden in New York and Bridgestone Arenia in Nashville next summer.\n\n\tDid they just announce those two shows early because they wanted to think of those as anchor shows for the tour and a sign of their success in important music cities? Actually, says singer Brandon Coleman: “They haven’t sold out yet, so we’ll have to see. We may not even do it. That’s actually why we announced them now, is because they’re gonna take the longest to sell out.” All kidding aside: “It is a huge honor, for real.”\n\t\n\n\tOf their nomination for vocal group of the year, which they ultimately won after sitting for this interview, Coleman acknowledges the debate over how squarely they do or don’t fit into country and said: “It’s a mix of emotions. We’re very thankful and grateful for it. We’re just happy that somebody’s accepting us, but at the same time we also think, well, we don’t even really play country music. But, I don’t know — a lot of things are called country nowadays…” The members did agree that the term “vocal group” sounds a little old-fashioned, conjuring up old-school harmony acts. “We’re not the Oak Ridge Boys. They need a band (category).” If it turns out that the Red Clay Strays keep winning it in future years, maybe they’ll be able to do some lobbying on that. Whatever their performance of “People Hatin'” at the CMAs turned out to be, it rocked. Or it country-rocked.\n\n\tMegan Moroney: The star discussed “Six Months Later,” the single she was invited to perform on the CMA Awards, with a host of dancerss; another, more delicate song that has just been released, “Beautiful Things”; and the third album that they’re taken from, “Cloud 9”; and that impendung record’s marked change in color-coding.\n\n\t“Surprise — the album’s pink,” she declared. “I’m leaving no questions — head to toe in pink. I kind of started that with ‘Lucky’ [her debut from 2023]. It was not on purpose at first, but on the Lucky Tour, I realized everyone was showing up in head-to-toe green. So for the next album, ‘Am I Okay?,’ I really leaned into it [with blue] — and of course I’ve leaned into it again with ‘Cloud Nine.’ I chose pink because I think there is a softness about this music that isn’t in my other albums. And I think it’s come from the confidence that I have now. It’s about falling in love and falling out of love, but when you’re truly confident, it’s not the end of the world when it doesn’t work out, you know? And my other albums, maybe I perceived it as the end of the world. Now this new music is just more carefree and confident. So I thought pink was a perfect color to feel empowering and confident, but also soft, and that’s what the new music is like.”\n\n\tDon’t expect pure positivity from the new collection. “There’s definitely still some heartbreakers on the album, because I’ll never abandon the emo cowgirl thing. Writing sad songs is so easy for me, for whatever reason. But I will say that, even in the sad songs, it didn’t not work out because I allowed them to treat me poorly. It didn’t work out because I cut things off. It’s still sad when you have to end things, and it’s still devastating, But even in the saddest songs, there’s so much hope and confidence that it’s gonna be OK, which is definitely a new theme that I explored in this album. I think it just comes from maybe getting a little bit older and knowing who I am and natural confidence that keeps growing.”\n\t\n\n\tTucker Wetmore: The singer just announced that in 2026 he will be headling the “Brunette Tour,” named after a fan-favorite song from his latest album that has just been released as a Western-themed music video. “We call it the Brunette Tour, but with blonde special guests — we got Dasha and Carter Faith (as opening acts), and then a good buddy of mine, Jacob Hackworth, who’s ironically brunette. But I thought that was kind of a quirky, fun thing to do for the tour.”\n\n\tOf his nomination for new artist of the year, Wetmore modestly said, “I’m happy I’m part of the story. It is a great class this year too. We got Ella, Zach, Shaboozey, Steven Wilson… You know, there’s so much talent on that list and within those people on the list. And I’m just thankful that they thought it’d be cool to put my name up there too.”\n\n\tOn the CMAs telecast, he performed what might count as his signature song, “Wind Up Missing You.” “It’s the story as old as time — the Guy Falls for the Girl, hopes it goes further. I remember the day we created that song, and the feeling that I wanted that song to portray and the lyrics and the production and everything. I just wanted to feel nostalgic and I wanted somebody to listen to it and feel like it wasn’t their first time listening to it. They could listen to it a thousand times, but feel like it’s still their first time.”\n\n\tThe War & Treaty: The husband-wife duo were coming into the CMA Awards coming off a very hot appearance singing the National Anthem before the Dallas Cowboys/Las Vegas Raiders game Monday night. It was fraught with emotion, following a moment of silence for Marshawn Kneeland, the Cowboys’ defensive end who died Nov. 6 at just 24 years old. But even without that undertow, their version of “The Star-Spangled Banner” would have been a knockout, masterfully arranged as it was by Michael Trotter for the soaring, interlocking voices of him and his wife Tanya.\n\n\t“We do sing it a lot, but we haven’t always done it this way,” said Tanya. “The genius behind the rendition is this guy right here, my husband — he’s the guru. And it’s interesting because as a duo, when you approach a song, you have to figure out how you can get both of you in it, you know? But that’s what Michael does so well, and he can tell you more about what was going through his brain when he created it.”\n\n\t“‘Just hurry up and get through it,'” Michael laughed. But seriously: “Tanya can, can finally get in there and, and, and do it justice. No. Um, I think, uh, also “I’ll make mention of what made that night special, is because of the news, of course, with the Dallas Cowboy organization and the passing of the player from suicide. To see those two organizations come together at the very beginning of the game and acknowledge, the presence that was on the field and the presence that was in the locker rooms of, you know, they’re out there without their buddy… it just showed me a lot about our country. Even still, you know, how opposing sides can know how to lay the swords down and say, ‘Look, man, we’re, we’re together in this.’ And I wanted to make sure that we reflected that in the national anthem. So we made sure we definitely felt the words we were singing.”\n\n\tBrandon Lake: Like the Red Clay Strays, Lake was stepping into country from a little bit outside the genre. Except instead of coming in from the rock side of things, Lake was entering through the contemporary Christian music door. As one of the biggest stars in that arena, Lake had recorded a song for his most recent album called “Hard Fought Hallelujah,” and at the beginning of last year he was inspired to ask Jelly Roll to sing it as a duet. They subsequently did it at the Opry, at CMA Fest and at the Dove Awards (joined in that last instance by Jon Batiste). The team-up was nominated for vocal event of the year, and Lake came onto the telecast to be a presenter as well.\n\t\n\n\t“This has felt like God has set it up from the get-go,” Lake said. “That’s the beauty of collaboration and relationships is really this song that I did with Jason — uh, Mr. Jelly Roll — kind of cracked the door open to country, which wasn’t a move I was trying to make. But I am a country boy and grew up in the South and in the woods, and I live on a farm, and so I find myself writing country songs all the time as much as I write songs for the church. So it has just felt natural to kind of step into that space. And I have felt so embraced by the country community. And so, yeah, we’re just seeing where it leads and just want to serve people well with these songs.” \n\n\tLake was inspired by seeing Jelly Roll on the CMAs last year. “When we wrote this song, we knew it was special and had to get it out. I teased it on Instagram and it  went off, and people basically threatened my life if I didn’t release it soon. As we got the song out, then I actually simultaneously had just been watching Jelly Roll’s story, and I loved how much he wears everything on his sleeve, and he’s so honest and inspiring. Then, this is what’s really cool, being at CMA Awards this year. I was watching … Jelly’s performance with Brooks and Dunn (of their song ‘Believe’). … I see hands being lifted all across the arena, and I just started bawling my eyes out and I was like, ‘Wow. These dudes just took the world to church.’ And that’s what gave me so much of the confidence to reach out to Jason and ask if he would consider being on this song with me.”\n\n\tDan + Shay: It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas for the duo for the second year in a row. Last year, they released their first holiday album — a double album, actually, of half originals and half standards — and this year are following it up with two more Xmas tracks before they get back on the non-holiday track. They don’t think it’s too early to start streaming those tunes.\n\n\t“You know, this time of year, I feel like with the CMAs, there’s a good kickoff to kind of the Christmas season. There’s always an argument of how early is too early to celebrate Christmas, and there’s such a finite window that people usually would say, early December. I’m trying to broaden that a little bit. I feel like, it’s my favorite holiday, so why would we not make a little longer? It’s why I keep my tree up till about March or April. … But man, it’s been so much fun. I think the first song that we ever recorded was ‘Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,’ and that kind of started the desire for our fans to want us to have a Christmas album.”\n\t\n\n\tOne of their new holiday songs — sort of — is a beautiful cover of Taylor Swift’s “Back to December,” just released to streaming services. “It happened, honestly, by accident,” swears Shay Mooney. “We were at asound check in Boston, and as Dan and I do, when there’s a piano in the room, we can’t help but jump over there and sing something. … We’re big Swifties, as I think everybody is, and we were just talking about that being one of our favorite songs that, while it’s a big song, never quite got its moment. … That organically turned into what it was and ended up being the fastest turnaround on a song we’ve, we’ve ever had… Our fans have absolutely loved it — and it’s Swiftie-approved. It’s scary when you’re doing a Taylor song. You never know if they’ll revolt against you because you tried. But thankfully, they said we do it justice.” \n\n\tOld Dominion: The group is celebrating the 10th anniversary of their major-label debut album, “Meat and Candy,” and all the success that came along with that… which wasn’t necessarily preordained, given that straight-in-the-pocket, mainstream country bands were an idea even more inherently outside of the box than they are now.\n\n\t“I think it’s a genre that probably lends itself to a solo artist more — I think we were a bit of a unicorn,” said Matthew Ramsey. “You know, we were a band that writes all the songs and gets in a garage or a rehearsal space and works ’em up and actually goes in the studio and plays on ’em. So in that way it was different, and in the beginning it probably worked against us. I mean, we got turned down by a lot of labels. I don’t think people really knew what to do with us, but that eventually helped us carve our own lane. Now there are some other great bands that have come up, and hopefully we’ve kind of opened the door for them a little bit.”\n\n\tTheir new record is called “Barbara,” cheekily, because they thought it would be amusing to give an album a girl’s name. There’s some other mirth to it as well, but also several more reflective songs, like the wistful closer, “Good Night Nashville.” “It’s a song that we couldn’t have written in our earlier days. It takes quite a lot of time and quite a lot of work and ups and downs to pursue this type of career, so you wind up making lots of amazing friends, and meeting people that maybe aren’t so amazing. It comes with both sides, you know? So we were sitting down in the writing room just talking about Nashville and how could we paint an accurate picture of it that reflected how much we loved it and appreciated it, but also took a few jabs at the same time.\n\n\t“I’ve said it from stage a couple times. I think of the best way for me to describe that song is it’s like a relationship with your parents. You know, Nashville sort of brought us up and it did a lot of things right, and it fucked it up a few times too.” The band laughed. “But really, it made you who you are and you have to appreciate all of those pieces of it that created the artist that you are.” \n\t\n\n\tJordan Davis: Some artists are done with anything Country Music Association-related after Wednesday night’s show. Not Davis, who is co-hosting the annual “CMA Country Christmas” show with Lauren Daigle. Set to air the first week of December, he show is already in the can, of course, having been taped in October at Belmont, so promoting it won’t cut too much into his Thanksgiving duties. \n\n\tDavis and Daigle would seem to be birds of a feather, both being Louisiana natives. But, he said, “She was joking with me about me being from Texas, because I’m from north Louisiana, and she’s a true southern Louisianan. But she’s an amazing person. My kids are her biggest fans out there, so it was cool to get to hang with her. … Lauren is just a natural in just about anything she does, so she makes it really, really easy. \n\n\t“But, personally, that’s one of my favorite shows of the year. I love the Christmas season. And I honestly think that this year’s show is one of the best ones that we’ve done in a long time. Just some amazing artists on it — BeBe Winans, who I’m such a huge fan of…. and then having Lauren play with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band was something that really kind of brought me back to my college days. I’m excited for everybody to see it.”\n\n\tLauren Alaina: She was brought in to host the live backstage material for the CMA on TikTok, from red-carpet looks to celebrity catchup after the show. “I love hosting things. It’s actually a big passion of mine,” she said. “Like, big picture, I would love to host my own TV show someday, so anytime I can do anything that kind of furthers me down that path, I try to do it.”\n\n\tFor the first time in her life, she’s a working mom. “My daughter is five months old, so I don’t get out of the house much. I snuck out today to come see you guys,” she laughed, “but I spend a lot of time at home with her right now, and she goes on the road with me when I’m playing my show. She’s a champ… the most wonderful thing that’s ever happened to me. I’ve been in the little baby bubble of just love and pure bliss. I’m a pretty happy lady these days.”\n\n\tHer new song is “not about a baby, it’s about a bunch of babies, actually,” she joked. That would be “All My Exes,” a duet with Chase Matthew, which she will be performing on “The Today Show” next Monday.  “I wrote ‘All My Exes’ a couple years ago about a different phase of my life, when I used to hang out on Broadway. I don’t do that very much anymore… actually, ever anymore. … Thematically, it’s a little different. It’s a slight departure from what I’ve been doing. Obviously,  I got married last year and had a baby this year, and so I’ve been writing a lot of songs about that. \n\n\t“Funnily enough, it’s my husband’s favorite. I’m like, ‘I write you songs all the time, and this one’s your favorite ,about my exes?’ I went on tour last summer with Jason Aldean and Chase Matthew, and my husband and Chase became fast friends, best buds. And Cameron actually played ‘All My Exes’ for Chase because he loved the song so much and wanted me to put it out. I’m so glad he did that, because we  put out a bunch of music this year, and this was the song that it blew up online for us. We just sent it to country radio and we’ve just charted, so, fingers crossed we’ll take it all the way.”\n",

In addition, the gaming company just dropped a new title to play that revisits a fan-favorite franchise, Kirby.\n\n\tEnter “Kirby Air Riders” for Nintendo Switch 2, which is the first new Kirby game for a home console since 2022’s “Kirby and the Forgotten Land” for the original Nintendo Switch and sequel to “Kirby Air Ride” for the Nintendo Game Cube in 2003.\n\n\n\tThe new game is available for purchase for $69 at Walmart, starting on Thursday, Nov. 20. The new installment is a racing game with 21 racers including Kirby, Meta Knight, King Dedede and others, while racing through various tracks on land and in the skies of Planet Popstar.\n\n\tThere’s an inventive racing that really takes advantage of the new Joy-Con 2 hardware, with single-player and multiplayer modes throughout the game.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNintendo\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tIf you’re a fan of Kirby and “Kirby Air Ride,” then it’s likely you’d be a fan of the sequel “Kirby Air Riders” too. Especially with new playable characters that increases the roster from three in the original game to seven times more with the new game. \n\n\tThere are even more Nintendo Amiibo collectible figures available for additional goodies and boosts. There’s Kirby on a Warp Star and Bandana Waddle Dee on a Warp Star too. Both collectibles go for $49.99 at Walmart.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNintendo\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNintendo\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAnd since “Kirby Air Riders” is from Walmart, you’ll get it shipped to you for free if you’re a Walmart+ member.

    "body": "\n\t“Next Year” may be resonating in more ways than the filmmakers originally imagined.\n\n\tA trailer for the short shows Jelani Alladin (“Fellow Travelers) as Robert, a father whose husband has died in a near-future America where “traditional values” have become law and homosexual activity is illegal.\n\n\tZach Martens (“Sleep No More”) co-stars as Robert’s new love interest. Rounding out the cast is Sherz Aletaha (“First Wives Club”).\n\t\n\n\tThe trailer explains that queer people have been banned by banks, targeted by police raids at gay bars and are subject to extreme surveillance by the government.\n\n\t“We all know when that asshole won that things would be bad. We had no idea they were going to be this bad,” Robert says in the trailer, after a government official is seen on a video ordering that “all suspicious homosexual activity must be reported immediately.”\n\n\t“Next Year” was written and directed by queer filmmaking duo and Emmy nominees Peter DiMario and Guto Barra. Costumes are by four-time Emmy nominee Joseph La Corte (“Murdaugh: Death in the Family”).\n\n\t“’Next Year’ is a deeply personal and politically resonant film that reflects the challenges facing LGBTQ+ communities today,” a logline of the movies reads. “It serves as both a warning and a testament to the resilience of love in dark times.”\n\n\tThe film is currently showing at international film festivals, with the hope of earning an Academy Award qualification for the live-action short film category.\n\n\tAlladin’s credits also include “Tick, Tick… Boom!,’ Michael Schwartz’s short “Strangers on a Beach” with Zane Phillips and Jack Falahee, as well as television’s “Blue Blood” and “The Walking Dead: World Beyond.”\n\t\n\n\tDiMario and Bara earned multiple New York Emmy Awards for “Immersive.World” and “Dreams From the Deep End.” DiMario is also a Webby Award winner for “How Art Changed Me,” while Barra, a three-time Emmy recipient, has directed projects for HBO Max, Amazon Studios, Disney+, PBS and more. Their work has screened at MoMA and the Brooklyn Museum.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDon’t ya just love Prince? The “Dancing With the Stars” Season 34 semifinals episode, which was themed around Prince, hit another season high with 7.22 million total viewers, according to the network, and a 1.5 rating among adults 18-49.\n\n\tThe Nov. 18 episode became the highest-watched semifinals episode in ratings in seven years (November 2018) and is up 28% in viewers compared to last season’s penultimate. Among adults, it nearly doubled its rating, with last year’s episode earning a 0.79; this year’s episode is the show’s best penultimate telecast in nine years (November 2016).\n\t\n\n\tThe interest has also grown immensely with younger viewers, with a 1.68 rating among adults 18-34, the best delivery in the younger demo in 10 years and the strongest for a penultimate episode in 14 years. Additionally, fan voting rose to a new high of 55.9 million votes.\n\n\n\tThe episode also included Zac Efron in the audience for the first time, there to support his brother, Dylan Efron. In a shock to many, Whitney Leavitt Carson and Mark Ballas were eliminated, sending Dylan and partner Daniella Karagach to the finale along with Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy, Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten, Robert Irwin and Witney Carson, and Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sousa.\n\n\tThe finale of “Dancing With the Stars,” produced by BBC Studios, will air on Tuesday, November 25, with the final five couples each dancing three times for the first time ever. Each pair will perform a judges’ choice dance, an instant dance and a freestyle routine.\n\n\tThis season has continued to see major success since it kicked off in September with the biggest premiere in five years and a 49% ratings bump from the year before. Plus, premiere voting rose 163% over last season’s premiere episode — and has seen an increase each week.\n\t\n\n\t“DWTS” airs on Tuesdays on ABC and Disney+ at 8 p.m. ET and streams the next day on Hulu.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery is about to dive into the nitty-gritty work of deciding whether to sell itself — in whole or in part.\n\n\tThe media conglomerate, home to Warner Bros., HBO and HBO Max, CNN, TBS, HGTV and more, is now evaluating multiple acquisition offers. First-round bids, which were due Thursday (Nov. 20), were expected to be submitted by Paramount Skydance, Comcast and Netflix. A source with knowledge of the situation said that those three entities did submit nonbinding, preliminary offers by the noon ET deadline. It’s unclear if there were other expressions of interest. \n\t\n\n\tMultiple sources noted that the bidding process required participants to sign nondisclosure agreements, as is commonplace. Paramount Skydance, Netflix and Comcast declined to comment as did Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\n\n\tLast month, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that it had received in-bound M&A interest from “multiple parties” and kicked off a process to review offers. WBD’s board wants to review the initial offers before Thanksgiving, with the goal of deciding the way forward before the end of 2025.\n\n\tDavid Ellison, fresh off closing the deal forming Paramount Skydance in August, is known to have submitted bids for WBD in its entirety; in October, the Warner Bros. Discovery board rejected his $23.50/share offer of 80% cash and 20% stock (which also proposed making David Zaslav co-chairman and co-CEO of the merged company). Paramount Skydance’s bid this week, fully backed by the Ellison family (i.e., wealthy tech mogul Larry Ellison) along with RedBird Capital, was expected to be roughly in line with Ellison’s previous $23.50/share offer, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.\n\t\n\n\tWBD said it will consider proposals in which the Warner Bros. business (HBO Max and studios) is sold separately from Discovery Global, the TV-centric company. That aligns with Warner Bros. Discovery’s already-underway plan to split into two companies by April 2026, with Zaslav set to become CEO of Warner Bros. and current CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels to become chief exec of Discovery Global.\n\n\tNetflix and Comcast, which is splitting NBCUniversal in two with the spin-off of the Versant cable-focused company by year-end, have been looking to acquire the Warner Bros. streaming and studio operations — they aren’t interested in WBD’s cable TV business.\n\n\tEllison has made the case that Paramount is the best suitor for WBD, and that combining the companies would produce a scaled-up media and entertainment powerhouse across streaming, TV and film. The Ellison camp also sees a Paramount takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery as encountering the least regulatory obstacles; it’s worth noting that the Ellisons are friendly with President Donald Trump, who reportedly favors a Paramount-WBD merger and has expressed open hostility toward Comcast chief Brian Roberts over MSNBC’s coverage of Trump.\n\n\tNetflix is looking to get its hands on Warner Bros.’s extensive production capabilities and deep film and TV library. But the prospect of the No. 1 premium streamer also acquiring HBO Max has triggered antitrust alarms among some politicos. Meanwhile, sources said Netflix has reassured WBD that it would honor the latter’s theatrical distribution deals to keep Warner Bros. films in cinemas in the event its bid is successful.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSomewhere, Robert Pietranton is smiling and spinning his favorite tune, Bruce Springsteen’s “Walk Like a Man” from the “Tunnel of Love” album. The beloved and well-respected communications exec, who just celebrated his birthday on Nov. 10, died Wednesday in Los Angeles. Pietranton was 56.\n\n\tThe news stunned and saddened the tight-knit Hollywood publicity and journalism communities, particularly the TV execs, publicists and reporters who worked closely with Pietranton during his stints at Warner Bros. TV, Sony Pictures TV and DreamWorks. The cause of his death has not yet been disclosed, but Warner Bros. TV said a celebration of his life will be held at a later date.\n\t\n\n\tPietranton, known for a wide variety of nicknames (this reporter liked to call him “Bobby P”), most recently worked at Warner Bros. TV Group as senior VP, publicity and communications. He had been at Warner Bros. for 20 years, having first joined in 2006 as director of publicity at Warner Bros. Worldwide Television Marketing. \n\n\n\tThe busy Pietranton worked regularly on projects big and small at the studio, including strategic business and written communications. In one recent notable example, just a few weeks ago he helped Variety on this story about how the HBO Max series “The Pitt” would be rolled out on TNT.\n\n\t“To have worked with Robert was truly a joy,” said Rebecca Marks, the exec VP of publicity and communications at Warner Bros. TV Group. “He was kind, honest, and warm, and his ability to connect with the press was widely respected. Most of all, Robert loved this business dearly. He was a consummate executive whose passion for storytelling was evident in everything he did, and we were so lucky to have him in our lives. \n\t\n\n\t“On a personal note, Robert was not only a colleague but a good friend that I could always count on,” she added. “I couldn’t begin to count the times he helped and supported me, along with so many others in our field. I will forever be grateful to him.”\n\n\tPrior to Warner Bros. TV, Pietranton spent time at Sony Pictures TV, where he was VP of media relations. And before that, he oversaw PR at DreamWorks TV. He also spent a bit of time doing some freelance work for Variety, particularly for some of this publication’s specials sections, writing about Clint Eastwood, Regina King, Liev Schreiber and others — you can see his stories here. He began his career at Levine Schneider PR and later worked at NBC Entertainment during its “Must-See TV” era as director of electronic publicity for movies, miniseries and specials.\n\n\tIn its tribute to Pietranton, Warner Bros. TV summed it up perfectly: “Pietranton was known for his calm demeanor under pressure, unwavering kindness, generosity, and decency. He was a rare executive who saw character and work ethic as traits valued over title or pedigree, lessons he often shared. He deliberately avoided the spotlight and was often happiest when those around him received the accolades. He personified the word mensch to those fortunate enough to know him.”\n\n\tAs referenced in the lede to this story, Pietranton was known for his love of Springsteen. Among those many nicknames (which also included “RP,” “BP,” “Piet” and “P”) was “Bobby Gene,” a reference to Springsteen’s song “Bobby Jean.” (And also a reference to his full name, Robert Gene Pietranton.)\n\n\tThe super TV fan also embraced dramas from titans like David Milch, David Chase and David Simon (he wrote about “The Wire” for Variety here). A tribute to Pietranton noted his other passions: “Martin Scorsese, the Pittsburgh Steelers, European soccer, entertainment business trivia, Wordle, and performing small acts of kindness for those around him.”\n\n\tSaid his pal Stu Levine, now at NBC but also a former Variety staffer: “In a comparison I know he would treasure, Robert was the Pele of PR, the Clemente of communication. We bonded over many things, including our absolute love of television. We could have a 30-minute conversation dissecting one scene from ‘Deadwood’ and then an hour conversation about a scene from ‘The Wire’ the very next day. He was my friend. He was my colleague. He was the best.”\n\t\n\n\tRobert Gene Pietranton was born on Nov. 10, 1969, in Virginia to parents Robert G. ‘Piet’ Pietranton and Linda Ann (Cox) Pietranton. He grew up mostly in Las Vegas, attending high school there, where he played soccer. He the graduated from Loyola Marymount University with a bachelor of arts in political science and began his career in PR.\n\n\tDuring his two-decade stint at Waner Bros. TV, the shows he worked on included “Abbott Elementary,” “All American,” “The Bachelor” franchise, “The Big Bang Theory,” the DC “Arrow” verse, “ER,” “Extra,” “Fringe,” “Gossip Girl,” “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” “The Mentalist,” “Mom,” “The Pitt,” “Riverdale,” “Smallville,” “Shameless,” “Shrinking,” “Supernatural,” “Running Point,” “Ted Lasso,” “Two and a Half Men,” “The Voice” and “The West Wing,” among many others.\n\n\t“There are no words to describe just how much Robert has meant to everyone at Warner Bros. Television Group,” said Channing Dungey, Chairman and CEO, Warner Bros. Television Group and WBD US Networks. “He was the heart and soul of not just our publicity department, but of our broader Studio. Throughout his 20+ year tenure, he was our confidant, our voice of reason, and our first stop in a brewing crisis. Beyond his impeccable reputation within our industry, he was most importantly our friend. His kindness and warm laugh will be deeply missed. We are heartbroken beyond measure and are keeping him and his family in our thoughts and prayers.”\n\n\tNews of Pietranton’s death quickly reverberated among colleagues past and present, among those know knew and loved him. “Robert Pietranton was a rare gem of a human being,” said Tammy Golihew, who worked with Pietranton for years at Warner Bros. before she moved to Amazon. “Razor sharp, whip-smart and sporting an encyclopedic knowledge of our industry, he was the G.O.A.T of Written Communications.  He was also funny, supportive and passionate about the things and people that he loved. I am devastated for all of us, who called him friend, that the irreplaceable Bobby P is gone.”\n\n\tAdded Karen Barragan, who worked closely with Pietranton at Sony: “My friend Robert was brilliant, loyal, generous, dependable, and one of the finest strategists I’ve ever known. I loved him as much as he loved Springsteen, and losing him breaks my heart.”\n\t\n\n\tFormer Warner Bros. publicity exec Scott Rowe said: “Robert was kind, funny, and smart – smart as hell. He was a friend to everyone. A true expert on entertainment, he understood not just the business, but the movies, series, and music themselves. I’m not sure there was a film he hadn’t seen or an episode unwatched. One of my greatest joys was making him laugh. It was a great laugh. It’s a laugh I will never forget. It was big, bright, and often punctuated with a hand-clap.”\n\n\tThen there’s former Disney exec Brandon Shaw, who considered Pietranton both a mentor and a friend: “As a young person with an interest in the entertainment business, all I wanted to be was our friend Robert Pietranton. And as my career has evolved, no one was better able to guide and provide counsel in tough times and celebrate the success in the up times than our dear friend. I will miss his life lessons, his ear, his heart and his generosity, and thank him from the bottom of my heart for being such an extraordinary friend to me and my family always. On the backstreets until the end, RP.”\n\n\tPietranton is survived by his brother, Ryan Pietranton, and his nephews Michael and Matthew.\n",

    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story sort of contains spoilers from Part 3 of the Season 19 reunion of “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” but it’s not really that kind of article.\n\n\tHeather Dubrow — a veteran cast member on “The Real Housewives of Orange County” — had relatively smooth sailing during show’s 19th season, when several of her fellow castmates were lost at sea. The season concluded Thursday night with Part 3 of its reunion episodes.\n\n\tThe season got off to a fraught, complicated start when Katie Ginella, in her sophomore season on the show, was caught in a number of contradictory statements; was exposed by Tamra Judge for having recorded Shannon Beador during the previous season without her permission and appeared to have had multiple points of contact with Bravo content creators, to whom she’d allegedly gossiped. Under scrutiny, Ginella couldn’t keep her stories straight, and after failing a lie detector test with flying colors, stopped filming with the cast entirely about halfway through the season until the recent reunion episodes.\n\n\tThat was the first mess. The second one was that Judge quit the show on camera a number of times, so upset was she about her close friend and “Two Ts in a Pod” podcast co-host, Teddi Mellencamp, who was facing a dire diagnosis from Stage 4 melanoma. (In wonderful news, Mellencamp told Variety at BravoCon on Nov. 14 that, because of immunotherapy, there is currently no cancer in her body.)\n\n\tNeither of those two controversies directly affected Dubrow, even though she has been close with Judge for years, and had argued with Ginella during Season 18. She was involved, of course, but not in the direct line of fire in either of these conflagrations.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHeather Dubrow at “The Real Housewives of Orange County” Season 19 reunion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Trae Patton/Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe third flare-up, however, did directly affect Dubrow, who is the mother of three queer children and has made it her life’s work to be a fundraiser, an ally and an advocate. In their last dinner of Season 19 filmed for the show’s finale, during an otherwise hilarious trip to Amsterdam, Gina Kirschenheiter brought up the subject of castmate Gretchen Rossi’s problematic Instagram likes. Judge had shown Kirschenheiter the posts in the weeks before, and Kirschenheiter wanted Rossi to explain them.\n\n\n\tRossi’s alleged online behavior — Variety is saying “alleged,” having not seen these posts first-hand — have been shared widely on the internet since at least April 2023, when a famous thread on Twitter (yes, it was still Twitter then!) screenshotted right-wing Instagram posts that appear to have been liked by Rossi’s account. The posts were anti-abortion, anti-vaccine, pro-election denial, pro-Trump, and perhaps most relevant to the Bravo audience, homophobic and transphobic. These posts were not a secret, and had a resurgence after Variety broke the news in January of this year that Rossi would return to “RHOC” as a friend of the cast.\n\n\tDubrow had fire in her eyes during the finale dinner, as she made it clear to Rossi that their friendship was on the line. Remembering it during an interview at BravoCon, Dubrow says she got “chills” at the mention of the dinner. She adds, with a shudder, “Like, it was terrible!”\n\n\n\tIn Part 3 of the reunion episodes of “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” Rossi does seek to explain herself (while also blaming Judge, her eternal enemy). Rossi says “there’s no excuse for liking anything that has any sort of offensive sentiment,” and denounces “anything that seems homophobic or transphobic or anything like that.” She blames “mindlessly” scrolling at night, and not realizing what she was hitting like on in what looks to be a completely redpilled algorithm. Rossi says, and Judge confirms, that she’s unfollowed those accounts, and almost fully apologizes, but does use “if” and “maybe.” “I gravely apologize if I liked something that was offensive or something like that,” Rossi says. “Maybe that’s my mistake.”\n\t\n\n\tDubrow starred on “RHOC” from Seasons 7 through 11, and then returned for Season 16. During Season 19, as previously mentioned, she mostly stayed above the fray — literally above, as she watched the chaos from her penthouse apartment in Los Angeles, which she shares with her husband, Terry, and their children. From BravoCon, Dubrow shares how her Season 19 storyline about coming a place of peace with her late father came to be, her regrets about how the Katie Ginella mess unfolded, her dislike of having “extraneous” off-camera outside forces affecting the cast’s relationships  — and where she stands with Gretchen Rossi after that massive fight.I feel like you had a good season. Does it feel that way to you?You know, it’s funny because Andy said to me the first time I went on “Watch What Happens Live” this season, he said, “I just love you this season — you’re having such a great season.” I was like, “Really?” I hadn’t thought about it.\n\n\n\tBut when I did sit down to think about it, I thought every season since I came back, someone is lying about me, right? I came back, and it was Noella saying I’d beaten up the crew, and then all the girls were coming after me for spreading Shannon’s personal business — which I was exonerated from! And then we had Katie. Every season, it’s been something. This year I felt like I could just be myself. Which I enjoyed!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Casey Durkin/Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou also had the very personal storyline about your dad. When was it that he died? \t\n\n\tHe died like eight years ago. And the question is, why now?\n\t\n\t\tIt is! \t\n\n\tI didn’t intend like, [deepens voice] “… and this season I’m going to talk about …” — I really didn’t. My mom is very sensitive to these things, and I never want to hurt her. So it’s a hard line to walk. But it was so germane to what was going on with Tamra that it struck me. Because everyone’s always like, “You’re scared of her,” or, “Why do you that?”\n\n\tAnd I’m like, I’m used to complicated people; I’ve grown up with complicated people. And I guess I’m OK with it, because I know it, right? So I started thinking about it, and I thought, “Oh, this is like my dad.” I remember talking to my sister about it, and I thought, “Should I say something?” I went, eh, yeah, I’m gonna talk about it.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAnd that’s really how it came up? Because Tamra Judge was triggering you in that way?\t\n\n\tYes! Absolutely. And every time my dad got brought up, I thought, who cares? I don’t need to heal anything. But I have to say, taking the ashes to Amsterdam, seeing my parents’ apartment — by the way, how weird was it?\n\n\tI got so many messages that, yeah, the producers set that up. I’m like, listen, I didn’t put that paparazzi on the street of Beverly Hills. I had no idea where we were going — we were driving a circle! I didn’t call the paparazzi in the first place. And we didn’t know that this guy was going to be there. So it was so special. And when I walked in the apartment, and saw my mom’s wallpaper was still on the wall, I went, “That is so cool.” \n\n\tI felt like it was like my dad opening the door for us. So when I actually spread the ashes, I really felt like a weight was lifted.\n\n\t\n\t\tIt was very moving. \t\n\n\tThanks! I didn’t realize how important it would feel.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Griffin Nagel/Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSwitching topics! The Kate Ginella stuff goes bad for her from Episode 1, when she digs herself into a terrible hole of seeming untruths and misleading statements. What was that like to watch as someone who is a veteran in this field?\t\n\n\tSo here’s the thing. Obviously, when we’re filming, you don’t have all the information. You only know what you see and what you hear directly, or else it’s hearsay and you’re not really sure. So when the audience is watching it, they have the benefit of hearing more conversations and putting it together a little bit differently. For every 30 hours we film, 20 minutes makes it to the air, right? I think the algorithm. You can’t show everything.\n\n\tThis season in particular, so many things happened off-camera with these extraneous people that I found a lot of it very confusing. I think the audience got confused. This season with me and Katie, I really didn’t have any big issues. I tried to help her a bit in some group settings, but I couldn’t stop — and I don’t think anyone could have stopped — the tidal wave.\n\n\tBut I do want to say, no one ever called me and said, “Will you not film with her anymore?” No one ever said that.\n\n\t\n\t\tDo you understand exactly how it happened that she stopped filming midseason?\t\n\n\tNo. I don’t. That’s above my pay grade. I can only speak for myself, but if any of us individually have the power to stop someone from filming — I’ve never heard of our cast, or any cast, getting together and saying we won’t do this. That didn’t happen.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tAs someone who’s been on the show for as long as you have been, before the Bravoverse was its own economy and there were all these content creators, or “bloggers,” as Katie would say, were factored in. These things are happening off camera. What do you think about that? \t\n\n\tI think it’s terrible. I think it’s terrible!I started the show when my youngest child was nine months old, and he’s turning 15. And there used to be a code on the show, a very clear code: no careers, no kids. It was an unspoken rule. Everyone abided by it, and it was appropriate. Because our show is about conflict and resolution between our group. Not about our children, not about our businesses. No one should be trying to hurt someone’s way to earn a living, and certainly not about ancillary people that have nothing to do with our friend group.\n\n\tThe conflict and resolution is about us and our friendships. And we need to go back to that. And I think to your point, with these layers of bloggers, social media, recap people — all these different things, they add so many layers to the show. Like, the Deux Mois, and people trying to find out things and what’s really happening. We need to go back to our roots.\n\n\t\n\t\tIt can go really right, like with “Salt Lake City” and the unmasking of Reality Von Tease, but usually fighting about things that happen on the internet is not good for the show.\t\n\n\tYou want to know why it worked, I think? I think because they didn’t tell anyone. So it was a surprise for the audience, the reveal of what actually happened and who it was.\n\n\tI don’t know any bloggers — I don’t have those sort of relationships. But I think people talk and they give out information, and sometimes they don’t mean to. I don’t think it’s all the time meant to be a bad thing. But it ruins the show.\n\n\tI love that all these people have come back, and it’s nostalgic. And I love that Vicki’s coming back — I think it’s great. But to me, we can’t go backwards. We have to go forwards. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTamra Judge, Heather Dubrow\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Griffin Nagel/Bravo\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAnd you stuck by Tamra this season when she was digging her own grave. Can you talk about that a little bit?\t\n\n\tYeah, you know, it’s a tough place to be when you see your friend making decisions and saying things that you don’t agree with. Tamra was in a weird place this year, with everything that going on with Teddi and whatnot. She’s my friend. I’m not going to desert her because I don’t agree with her. But I just really tried to be very vocal with her at every turn, and she was not happy with me for a lot of it.\n\t\n\n\tAnd I made it clear, look, we are friends, but that doesn’t mean blind loyalty, and it doesn’t mean I have to agree with everything that you’re doing. And you have to appreciate that as a friend.\n\t\n\t\tWith Katie, was it a relief when she stopped filming with you all?\t\n\n\tNo! The whole thing is bizarre. Look, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. We work best when everyone is doing great and on fire and a great cast member. So it’s disappointing. And you know, she’s a pretty girl, she’s got a nice family, her backstory is interesting. I wish she had come in differently.\n\t\n\t\tAre you expecting there to be cast changes next season?\t\n\n\tIt wouldn’t surprise me if there were cast changes.\n\n\tOK, let’s talk about the Gretchen Instagram stuff. In the third episode of the reunion, you do seem to come to a kind of resolution with her. But tell me about that dinner on the last night in Amsterdam, and what that was like. I mean, I have chills, right when you said that. Like, it was terrible! I’ve known Gretchen as long as I’ve known Tamra. And she’s always been incredibly kind to me, to my family. I’ve never heard her say anything against the LGBTQIA+ community. She has friends in the community.She liked those posts, though.But she liked the posts. And maybe she didn’t like all of them? But I said to her, and I don’t know if this made it into the episode, like, “Terry’s for you page is cats. Mine is, I like to watch people wrap presents and things like that. But when you follow that many hate accounts, your algorithm has got to be showing you terrible things. And so how do you not notice that?”\n\n\tAnd look, there were other posts that she liked outside of the queer community that I also don’t agree with. But you know, everyone’s entitled to their opinions on things, but when someone starts calling it a lifestyle choice being gay — it’s tough!\n\n\tHere’s how it seems from the outside: In her years off the show, Gretchen was positioning herself as a MAHA, MAGA mom influencer. And then she came back to a very LGBTQ+-friendly show and network, and had to row all the way back. Had you heard and seen those things about her in her years off the show?Yes. I had.\n\n\n\tWere you concerned about something like this happening on camera?\n\n\tNo. I didn’t think it would come on the show.Really? \n\n\tNo, I didn’t. This is just the reality of the world, and it’s certainly a reality in a very conservative Orange County. But how lucky am I to be able to be a long-standing cast member and be able to show my really normal family, and start conversations in other people’s families. I’ve been able to use the platform for that. And it makes me so happy.\n\n\tIt’s not my job to fix people. Because I can’t. But what is my job as a mother and a human and someone with a platform is to be a great ally and a great parent. And react to what I’m told. And I feel like I did a good job with that.\n\n\t\n\t\tWhere do you stand with Gretchen now?\t\n\n\tI mean, what I said to her at the reunion is exactly what I said to you: You’ve always been kind to us. I can’t imagine what your for you page looks like, but I hope you use this. Because not just me and my family, but your other friends in the community — this is very upsetting to all of us. So I hope that she takes this moment to really look at what she’s liking and posting.\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen Tamra says, why is when I brought this up worse than the fact that she liked those posts — that’s really the nut of it to me. Of course, Tamra had this ammo in her back pocket and was waiting to use it. That’s the show, right?\t\n\n\tRight. But it shouldn’t be.\n\n\tBut people are always shoring up information, and figuring out when to deploy it.\n\n\tWell, that’s the whole thing. You don’t want it to be a storyline. But if it’s true, it needs to be addressed.Here’s what was OK with me. As hard as all that was, our show is about starting conversations, right? It’s a watercooler show. Even though I don’t like it, and I know she’s so upset about what happened, and really feels like that is not who she is, we’re all talking about it.\n\n\tAnd wouldn’t it be great if we could just really open people’s eyes and they could see that we’re all humans, and it’s biology? And let’s give each other some grace.\n\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

TMZ has confirmed.\n      \n    \n          We're told \"The Real Housewives of Orange County\" star allegedly gave Hayes, one of the 6-year-old twins, Ritalin multiple times, despite the child not having an ADHD diagnosis.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          According to sources, the situation escalated when King allegedly asked the school nurse to give Hayes the medication as well. That request reportedly triggered a Child Protective Services investigation.\n      \n\n          King was granted supervised visitation twice a week with Hayes, his twin brother Hart, and their older sister, Aspen.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          As we previously reported ... a temporary restraining order was put in place after a school employee allegedly contacted CPS with concerns. A judge is expected to consider a more permanent solution in a custody hearing set for early December.\n      \n    \n          King and Edmonds, who tied the knot in 2014 before splitting in 2019 amid a cheating scandal, have been operating under a joint custody agreement since May 2021.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          We've reached out to reps for Meghan ... so far, no word back yet.

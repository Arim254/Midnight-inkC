    "body": "\n\tDirector Grant Gee shifted his focus from rockers to a jazzman, and Berlin took notice.\n\n\tGee is noted as a documentarian covering music acts; his 1998 doc “Meeting People Is Easy,” for which he followed Radiohead on a world tour, is a landmark, followed up with the definitive take on Joy Division in 2007. Now, with “Everybody Digs Bill Evans,” Gee explores the story of the titular jazz pianist (played by Anders Danielsen Lie), who, following personal tragedy and in the throes of addiction, must struggle to reconnect with his art. Gee spoke to Variety from his home in London about the film, playing in the fest’s competition berth.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDid your background as a documentarian color the way you made a scripted film?\t\n\n\tThe difference between documentary approaches and fictional approaches to a musical figure — at heart, there’s no difference at all. Musicians are fascinating, because, of all artists, they often have the most chaotic lives. They tend to be great subjects. \n\n\n\tWhat was different in doing a drama? It might sound stupid, but it’s really nice that there’s other people around. Documentaries tend to be near enough one person. To have 70 people around to share the load was really joyful.\n\t\n\t\tWhen was the first time you learned of Bill Evans’ story?\t\n\n\tWhat started me off with Bill Evans was an untitled photograph of him. He just looked haunted. I wanted to know what was going on with that character, who that character was — what music came out of that character. That started me off listening to the tunes, and, after a few years, I got more and more interested in him. One day, I saw someone had written a beautiful, slim novel about Bill not playing. And I thought, that’s fantastic — because with music biopics especially, the worst thing is when the actors have to play the musical genius. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tI thought one thing this movie did especially well was depicting the ways addiction ripples through generations. (Evans’ father, a heavy drinker, is played by Bill Pullman.) Talk about taking on that challenge.\t\n\n\tWhat was more difficult was portraying what we’d now call addiction in a way that was more in line with how it would have been perceived in the early sixties, before our recent understandings of what addiction is. People would turn a blind eye, because it was almost like it was part of the underworld. Families don’t talk about it. \n\t\n\t\tMusicians live really complicated lives — performing late at night, for instance, colors your day-to-day existence. What about knowing and working with musicians informed your work here?\t\n\n\tThere’s no parallel I was making about following [Radiohead’s] Thom Yorke around for a year. But there was a very practical benefit to working with musicians in the way I have in the past. We wanted the film to start off with a great piece of performance, and so it was joyful for me to get back to filming a pure performance piece. \n\t\n\t\tSo much of the film is troubling and sad, but Bill seems so focused and alive when he’s performing.\t\n\n\tAs Bill says in the film, it’s so effing difficult — it’s like walking a tightrope. I’ve always worked with rock musicians, and I think there’s a particular strain on jazz musicians. The creative energy that moment-to-moment improvisation takes is extraordinary. \n\t\n\t\tThis is going to be your first time at the Berlinale. What does that mean to you?\t\n\n\tIt’s wonderful. All the way through this film, I had such a great time that I got into the mode of thinking, This is enough. Even if this film goes no further, this is enough. So to end up in competition in Berlin is just such a treat.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDespite its setting in 1870s Wisconsin, Dara Van Dusen’s feature debut, “A Prayer for the Dying,” is an eerily timely story touching on deadly epidemics and wildfires. The film bows in Berlin’s Perspectives section.\n\n\t“I’ve been working on this film for over a decade and it’s based on a book [by Stewart O’Nan] published in 1999. Then the pandemic happened. I was stuck at home with a 2-year-old and my husband, and suddenly everything felt just too real,” she recalls. \n\t\n\n\tAs time went by, she managed to process her emotions — only for the California wildfires to dominate the headlines during post-production. Now, in a town called Friendship, its sheriff and preacher Jacob Hansen (Johnny Flynn), and Doc (John C. Reilly), must confront both. \n\n\n\t“Hopefully, it doesn’t feel too in-your-face. But history repeats itself. These things happened quite frequently in the 1800s, and they’re happening again. It’s part of the cycle,” she says.\n\n\tIn “A Prayer for the Dying,” produced by Dyveke Bjørkly Graver for Eye Eye Pictures and sold by New Europe Film Sales and Anton, her protagonists disagree on how to handle the crisis. \n\n\t“When confronted with all these disasters, Jacob starts questioning his faith. Then there’s the doctor, who’s a man of logic and doesn’t even take faith into consideration. I loved having these two viewpoints,” she says. “Everything has become so black and white these days, so right or wrong. It’s never that way. People make mistakes, and maybe the right answer reveals itself later on.”\n\t\n\n\tVan Dusen ended up filming in Slovakia, building Friendship from scratch with the help of production designer Hubert Pouille. “I wanted to create a universe that was rooted in reality, but existed in something much more surreal,” she says.\n\n\tShe also surrounded herself with an international cast and crew, including Norwegian actor Kristine Kujath Thorp, playing Jacob’s wife Martha, and Sweden’s Gustav Lindh.\n\n\t“Our country was built by immigrants. It’s a fascinating part of the U.S. and hopefully it will continue to be,” she says. “Wisconsin had a large Norwegian and Scandinavian community that received land in exchange for fighting in the Civil War.”\n\n\tJust like Jacob, a veteran unable to shake off the horrors he has experienced. \n\n\t“Suddenly, he’s faced with all these issues as the leader of this town and the father of a young family. As his mind starts to unravel, he becomes an unreliable narrator. We’re not sure if everything he’s showing us, and telling us, is real.” \n\n\tVan Dusen adds: “He has a mask that goes on and off, and it’s quite disorienting when reading the novel. You don’t know if he’s good or bad. But if you take any ‘good’ person and put them in an extreme situation, they will do things that feel wrong.”\n\n\tVan Dusen was born in the U.S. and now resides in Norway. She met her longtime friend and director of photography, Kate McCullough, while studying at the Polish National Film School in Łódź.\n\n\t“I saw Kieślowski’s ‘Dekalog’ and thought: ‘Oh God, I want to be him’,” she laughs.  \n\n\t“Having someone like Kate by my side gave me the confidence to stick to the visual language we had developed. I’m fascinated by visual storytelling – I just saw ‘Sirât’ for the second time. That kind of cinematic experience touches your soul. Now, I only want to go crazier and bigger, and experiment with other genres.”\n\n\tShe wanted to capture the “biblical, surreal” world of O’Nan’s novel.\n\n\t“It’s difficult to talk about things like ego, faith and morality. But once you step out of reality and move into a hellish space, there’s more freedom to communicate these complex issues,” she notes.  \n\n\t“I never wanted it to be full-on horror, but there are elements that felt like doomsday. With Kate, we used to talk about ‘faith camera’. It sounds pretentious, but the idea was to show that something else might be at play, dictating what’s happening. It was a godlike point-of-view because that’s what these characters believed in.” Despite living in “primarily atheist” Norway, she’s still “fascinated by religion.”\n\t\n\n\t“Humans have a need to believe in something bigger. I think it’s more relevant now, as we’re living through such chaotic times,” she says. “People desperately want answers, rules and hope, but we don’t really have that anymore.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tNew works from name auteurs including “Tropical Malady” helmer Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Romania’s Corneliu Porumboiu, and Mexico’s Tatiana Huenzo ",
    "body": "\n\tNew works from name auteurs including “Tropical Malady” helmer Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Romania’s Corneliu Porumboiu, and Mexico’s Tatiana Huenzo are among the 14-title first batch of features selected to benefit from the newly launched Fondazione Prada Film Fund.\n\n\tThe Prada Foundation film fund, whose top executives are attending the Berlinale, was officially launched last year at Venice with a total €1.5 million ($1.7 million) pot to support indie cinema from around the world without any restrictions on theme, genre, language or any other types of strings attached.\n\t\n\n\tThe projects that made the Prada foundation cut – out of a massive more than 1,200 submissions – hail from 26 countries across 5 continents. Of the 14 selected features, 4 are in development, 9 in production, and 1 in post. They are helmed by 6 women and 8 men, and include 2 debut features.\n\n\n\t“The quality and experimentation of the selected projects demonstrate the dynamic nature and variety that characterize contemporary indipendent cinema,” said in a statement Miuccia Prada, who is owner of the Prada Italian luxury group and head of the Prada foundation, the cultural institution she established alongside her husband Patrizio Bertelli in 1993.\n\n\t“With the Film Fund we aim to promote the work of authors, especially those who most need concrete support to translate their vision into reality,” she added. “Moving forward, Fondazione Prada intends to continue promoting the idea of a free, demanding, and visionary cinema by building a stronger dialogue with those who conceive, develop, and produce films.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Fondazione Prada Film Fund offers three types of support: development, production and post. The maximum amount of funding a project can get is €250,000 ($296,000) towards production.\n\n\tThe fund is managed by former Directors’ Fortnight chief Paolo Moretti in collaboration with film programmer Rebecca De Pas.\n\n\tEchoing Miuccia Prada’s words, Moretti underlined that the Prada foundation fund “stems from the realization that contemporary independent cinema is experiencing a period of great artistic vibrancy alongside significant structural fragility.”\n\n\t“Many of the most ambitious works in terms of research and formal experimentation face increasing difficulties in finding adequate production support. The Film Fund is conceived to support this research through its many phases.” \n\n\t“The selected projects reflect a wide range of sensibilities, geographies, and approaches, while sharing a high level of formal awareness and a clear artistic vision. Our goal is to help create the right productive condition for rigorous and innovative research to continue to fully take shape,” Moretti went on to point out.\n\n\tUnder Moretti’s guidance, the foundation’s Cinema Godard movie theater (pictured above) has stepped up its screening series and onstage conversations with name directors including Alfonso Cuarón, Xavier Dolan, Luca Guadagnino, Werner Herzog, Jia Zhangke and Rebecca Zlotowski, to name a few.\n\n\tThe first projects selected by Fondazione Prada Film Fund are:\n\n\t“Amarcord ’90” (working title) – Yuri Ancarani (Italy) – Phase: Development\n\n\t“Captions Will Be Needed” – Natalia Almada (Mexico, United States) – Phase: Production\n\n\t“Cosmofonia” – Verena Paravel (France, United Kingdom) – Phase: Development\n\n\t“Galerna” – Tatiana Huezo (Mexico, Spain, Switzerland) – Phase: Production\n\n\t“Jenjira’s Magnificent Dream” – Apichatpong Weerasethakul (Colombia, the Netherlands, France, Mexico, Thailand) – Phase: Production\n\n\t“Las Italianas” – Laura Citarella (Argentina, France, Germany, Italy) – Phase: Development\n\n\t“Mulatresse Solitude” – Baloji (Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, South Africa, Democratic Republic of the Congo) – Phase: Production\n\n\t“On Land and Sea” – Hlynur Pálmason (Denmark, Iceland, France, Finland, Sweden) – Phase: Production\n\t\n\n\t“Summer in Heat” – Levan Akin (Sweden, Germany, France) – Phase: Production\n\n\t“The Costume” – Corneliu Porumboiu (France, Germany, Romania) – Phase: Production\n\n\t“The Difficult Bride” – Rubaiyat Hossain (Bangladesh, France, Portugal, Norway, Germany) – Phase: Post-production\n\n\t“The Hallucinations” – Andrea Gatopoulos (France, Italy, Greece) – Phase: Development\n\n\t“The Human Purge” – Eduardo Williams (Argentina) – Phase: Production\n\n\t“The Sleeping Woman” – Daria Martin (United Kingdom, Ireland) – Phase: Production\n",

    "body": "\n\tOscilloscope Laboratories has acquired U.S. rights to Italian director Virgilio Villoresi’s directorial debut, “Orfeo,” a dreamlike drama that premiered out of competition at the 2025 Venice Film Festival.\n\n\tThe U.S. deal for “Orfeo” was inked by Oscilloscope’s head of acquisitions, Aaron Katz, and Italy’s True Colours, which is selling the film at the EFM. \n\n\t“This deal marks our first collaboration with the Oscilloscope team and we are thrilled it caught their eye, in particular the unique peculiarity of this film,” said True Colours’ head of sales, Francesca Tiberi in a statement. “We are confident this partnership will strengthen the movie’s exposure in the U.S.” \n\t\n\n\t“Orfeo,” which is based on Italian author Dino Buzzati’s graphic novel “Poema a fumetti,” follows a solitary pianist who, since childhood, has imagined fantastic stories set in an abandoned villa across from his home. His life is transformed when a mysterious love draws him to a woman named Eura, following her through a small door in front of the abandoned villa. A strange and mesmerizing journey follows that blurs the lines between reality and fantasy.\n\n\n\tMilan-based Fantasmagoria produced “Orfeo,” which stars Luca Vergoni, Giulia Maenza, Aomi Muyock, and Vinicio Marchioni.\n\n\tCommented Oscilloscope’s Katz: “Virgilio’s vision is a magical and fantastic retelling of the story of Orpheus. The artistry he implements brings to mind the work of cinema’s early masters and reminds you of what cinema was meant to be — a format that brings imagination and wonder to life. Audiences are in for a real treat.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere aren’t many movies merrily described by their writer/director as the “most naughty, feral, fucking crazy ensemble film about a group of kids in remission who go to a summer camp and all they want to do is takes loads of drugs and have a fun time.”\n\n\tBut then there aren’t many filmmakers like 26-year-old Brit George Jaques, who opens the Berlinale’s Generation 14plus strand with his sophomore feature “Sunny Dancer,” a coming-of-age comedy that, as per its more diplomatically worded official synopsis, “takes a refreshing, uplifting and surprising approach to the teenage cancer story.” It’s also a film that has probably the highest laugh-to-cry count of any recent title, provoking cheers and tears sometimes multiple times in the space of just seconds.\n\t\n\n\tShot in Scotland and led by Bella Ramsey, “Sunny Dancer” follows Ivy, a grumpy 17-year-old who has beaten leukemia but is now struggling to embrace what should be her rebellious adolescence. Sent by her loving parents (Jessica Gunning and James Norton) to what she bills as a “Chemo Camp” for kids in remission, Ivy eventually finds a group of misfit friends and a renewed lust for life — plus sex, booze and drugs. And yet, as her happiness finally soars, she’s still forced to deal with the reality that this is a life that can be cruelly snatched away at any moment.\n\n\n\tInspired to make the film by both his mother who had battled cancer and his editor who told him she’d attended a similar camp for kids herself, Jaques found himself on a three-day retreat called “Find Your Sense of Tumor” and in hospitals where teenagers would tell him about racing down corridors with their IV drips and “getting their first hand job” in a ward.\n\t\n\n\t“It really hit me that these young people were so much more interesting than their diagnoses,” he says. So Jaques set out to make a film that wasn’t “patronizing” to younger audiences or part of a “weird sub-genre of films about cancer,” and one that — crucially — didn’t feature any scenes of sick-looking kids lying on hospital beds.\n\n\tHe also wanted to bring back the “ensemble energy” of 1980s movie, such as “The Breakfast Club,” and to put what he describes as “the coolest young actors” together. Alongside Ramsey, the riotous camp gang includes rising Brit stars Daniel Quinn-Toye (“Voltron”), Ruby Stokes (“Rocks”), Earl Cave (“The Sweet East”), Conrad Khan (“County Lines”) and newcomer Jasmine Elcock.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEarl Cave, Conran Khan, Bella Ramsey, Ruby Stokes, Jasmine Elcock and Daniel Quinn-Toye in ‘Sunny Dancer’. Courtesy of Colin J. Smith\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tColin J Smith\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Fat chance” thought Jaques when Ramsey was first pitched for the lead, acknowledging that, off the back of “The Last of Us,” they were “possibly the most famous young person on the planet.” But he sent a hopeful letter and his sizzle reel (which included a “crap camp video” spliced with a popular meme of Joe Pesci saying “What the fuck is this piece of shit?”). They got on a call, had a chat about life. Ramsey was on board.\n\n\tTo anyone who knows Jaques, regularly called a “force of nature,” this may all sound fairly standard. Having fully adopted the “If you don’t ask, you don’t get” philosophy, the enthusiastic young filmmaker’s ability to draw people into his creative orbit is something to be marvelled at. And it didn’t stop with Ramsey.\n\n\tLeading the camp is its wonderfully cringe and frequent dad joke-delivering president Patrick, played by Neil Patrick Harris. The Emmy winner was another long-shot casting punt, quickly charmed over a Zoom call. “He’s like family to me now — I stayed with him in New York,” says Jaques (who, through his fashion contacts, has since helped his new friend get kitted out in Hermès for the Berlinale premiere). Unsurprisingly the two are already plotting more projects together.\n\n\tLater in the film, musician James Blunt appears in a comically self-effacing cameo playing his hit song “You’re Beautiful,” a casting that effectively began when Jaques was a teenager himself and happened to start chatting to Blunt’s manager in his local pub. Almost a decade on, having kept the number, he gave the guy a call. Remember me? He did, and arranged a Zoom with Blunt.\n\t\n\n\t“He was amazing, and just the kindest man — and he came and did it all for free!” he says. “I remember looking at my monitor, and there was Neil Patrick Harris in there, plus James Norton and Jess Gunning, and then James Blunt singing ‘You’re Beautiful,’ and I thought, what the fuck, this is mental. I don’t actually know how I did this.”\n\n\tBlunt may have sung on screen, but he didn’t compose the soundtrack. That — of course — was another music star, Este Haim of the sister trio Haim.\n\n\t“No fucking way is a Grammy-nominated artist gonna do this,” Jaques says was his initial reaction when the two were connected via his manager. But Haim read the script, spoke to the filmmaker and, like everyone else, was convinced to join the party. “She was like, ‘George, I’m actually Type 1 diabetic, and I used to go on diabetes camps’ and I just knew then she was in… and then she brought on co-composer Zachary Dawes, who’s Lana Del Rey’s bassist.”\n\n\tThen there was Alison Goldfrapp, who just happened to be sitting next to Jaques at a gig and, after he asked, gave him the rights to use “Ooh La La” in the film for free. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBella Ramsey in ‘Sunny Dancer.’ Courtesy of Colin J. Smith\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It’s hard to make these indies, so we need as much support as we can get,” says the filmmaker about his delightfully ballsy approach. “Because this type of film doesn’t get made that much anymore. Gone are the days of ‘Juno’ and “About Time’ and all those beautiful films that were being made left, right and center.”\n\n\tBut through Jaques determination and his ever-expanding address book of industry contacts — plus the support of Embankment Films, which got behind the project from a very early stage — “Sunny Dancer” did get made. And it may now serve as a spot of timely counter-programming in Berlin, a film set in summer (it shockingly didn’t rain once during filming in Scotland) and emanating enough warmth to help combat the cold outside. \n\n\tBecause while “Sunny Dancer” may be a feature about a terrible killer disease, and is understandably tinged with moments of extreme sadness, it’s also filled with an abundance of loud and chaotic youthful joy (and some seriously un-PC jokes about cancer).\n\n\tDuring the shoot, with the help of Harris, the cast went to see Kylie Minogue perform at the start of her world tour, and afterwards went backstage to meet the singer. \n\t\n\n\tFew would be shocked if Minogue were to appear in Jaques’s next film, whatever fucking crazy idea that might be about. \n",

    "body": "\n\tJapan is mounting its strongest presence at the Berlin Film Festival in years, with seven films spanning competition, Forum, Panorama and Classics sections. It’s a range that mirrors the country’s record-breaking theatrical year in 2025 and signals what producers describe as a genuine renaissance for Japanese cinema.\n\n\tThe 76th Berlinale lineup features Yoshitoshi Shinomiya’s animated debut, “A New Dawn,” competing for the Golden Bear; Yusuke Iwasaki’s socially critical supermarket horror “AnyMart” in Forum; Takuya Uchiyama’s identity-search-focused “Numb” in Panorama; and Nao Yoshigai’s meditative documentary “Masayume” in Forum. The Berlinale Classics section will present restored editions of Shōhei Imamura’s 1966 satire “The Pornographers” and Yoshiaki Kawajiri’s influential 1993 anime “Ninja Scroll,” while animated feature “Chimney Town: Frozen in Time” by Hirota Yusuke is in the Generation section.\n\t\n\n\tJapanese filmmaker Hikari is on the main competition jury while films with Japanese production participation include Edwin’s “Sleep No More” in the Special Midnight strand and Anocha Suwichakornpong’s “Narrative” in Forum Expanded. \n\n\n\tThe Berlin presence comes on the heels of Japan’s best theatrical year on record. The country’s box office reached JPY274.45 billion ($1.79 billion) in 2025, up 32% from 2024 and surpassing the previous 2019 peak of JPY261.18 billion, according to figures released by the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan. Admissions climbed 30.7% to 188.76 million tickets sold — the second-highest attendance figure on record.\n\t\n\n\tThe surge was driven overwhelmingly by local productions, led by anime blockbuster “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba — The Movie: Infinity Castle — Part 1,” which dominated with $255 million, and Kabuki drama “Kokuho,” which earned $127 million to become the highest-grossing live-action Japanese film of all time locally and went on to score and Oscar nomination. “Detective Conan: One-Eyed Flashback” followed with $95.8 million, while “Chainsaw Man — The Movie: Reze Arc” collected $67.8 million.\n\n\tThe Berlin presence also follows growing international recognition for Japanese cinema across the festival circuit. Tatsuya Mariko’s “Dear Stranger,” produced by Eisei Shu, garnered acclaim at the Busan International Film Festival last year, where it was praised as “presenting new possibilities for Asian cinema.” The film explores themes of love, identity and guilt within the transnational Asian middle class.\n\n\tChie Hayakawa’s coming-of-age drama “Renoir,” produced by Eiko Mizuno-Gray, also made waves following its success at Cannes and other festivals. Mizuno-Gray attributes the film’s resonance to qualities that feel distinctly Japanese. “The subtlety, the ambiguity, the choice not to explain everything — these feel very Japanese, but they also represent an act of trust in the audience,” she says. “‘Renoir’ trusted its viewers, and in turn, the audience was ready to be trusted.”\n\n\tProducers credit Japan’s distinctive mini-theater culture as a foundation for the current renaissance. “From the 1980s through the 2000s, Japan experienced a ‘mini-theater boom,’ during which a large number of high-quality international films were introduced to domestic audiences,” Shu explains. “This environment played an important role in nurturing today’s filmmakers and filmgoers.”\n\n\tCurrently, more than 600 films are released annually in Japan, with approximately 40% being mini-theater films. “Among them are many outstanding works that have yet to be sufficiently seen overseas,” Shu notes.\n\n\tMizuno-Gray emphasizes the importance of diverse perspectives emerging from within Japan itself. “These films don’t really aim to ‘export Japan’; instead, they’re rooted in very personal and specific forms of expression,” she says. “Their personal, concrete stories are often told from perspectives that differ from Western viewpoints, which can make them especially interesting to audiences abroad.”\n\t\n\n\tThe success of “Demon Slayer” and other anime titles reflects the broader strength of Japan’s animation industry, which reached a record $25.25 billion in 2024, according to the Assn. of Japanese Animations. Overseas revenues surged 26% year-on-year to $14.27 billion, now exceeding local earnings and representing 56% of total anime market value.\n\n\t“Kokuho” producer Chieko Murata, whose film defied expectations with its box office performance, observes a maturation in audience tastes. “I honestly did not imagine ‘Kokuho’ to be this successful box office wise,” she says. “‘Kokuho’ is not an accessible film for those who has not read the original novel or is not familiar with Kabuki, but I felt that the young audience now has matured their eyes thanks to those high-quality animation films in the past decades.”\n\n\tJapan remains a country where traditional media consumption patterns persist. “Japan is one of the few countries where bookstores still exist in every city, people buy newspapers at subway stations and network TV programs has high viewing rates,” Murata notes. \n\n\tThe Berlin showcase kicks off what producers anticipate will be another landmark year. Beyond the February festival, Japan will be the country of honor at the Cannes Film Market in May, a development producers are cheering. “This represents a highly significant opportunity for Japanese cinema, and we hope it will allow the world to see — more clearly than ever — the rich diversity of Japanese filmmaking,” says Shu.\n\n\tWhile the most anticipated Japanese title of 2026 remains “Godzilla Minus Zero,” the pipeline includes high-profile titles from established auteurs. Shu highlights Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s period drama “Kokurojo: The Samurai and the Prisoner” and Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s Japan-France co-production “All of a Sudden” as particularly anticipated works. Murata also points to Hirokazu Kore-eda’s two upcoming films, “Look Back” and “Sheep in the Box.”  The year will also see continued expansion of manga adaptations, with sequels to “Kingdom” and “Golden Kamuy” alongside new franchises including “Blue Lock,” “Sakamoto Days” and others.\n\n\tFor Mizuno-Gray, the most exciting prospects are elsewhere. “Rather than major, headline-making titles, I’m most excited by quieter surprises and moments of discovery — debut or second features by emerging filmmakers, or new works in which established directors are clearly exploring unfamiliar territory,” she says.\n\t\n\n\tThe government’s revised Cool Japan initiative aims to triple overseas content sales to $131.4 billion by 2033, from approximately $38 billion in 2024. This policy framework is encouraging producers to take international perspectives while maintaining cultural specificity.\n\n\t“In Japan, film is often perceived more as ‘content’ than as ‘art,’ and policies have been introduced to actively promote the export of content, not limited to cinema alone,” Shu observes. “As a result, these developments may encourage creators with an international perspective to reexamine and renew their own culture and modes of expression.”\n\n\tMizuno-Gray notes a shift in production approaches. “More producers are starting to experiment with international co-productions to make such a diverse lineup possible, and I think this is gradually changing the way Japan is seen as a more open, global market,” she says.\n\n\tAs Japanese cinema heads to Berlin with its strongest festival presence in years and enters 2026 with momentum from its record-breaking theatrical year, the seven-film Berlinale selection serves as a snapshot of an industry firing on multiple cylinders — from competition-worthy animation and socially engaged genre filmmaking to meditative documentaries and the restoration of canonical works. “We hope that in 2026 as well, the diversity and depth of Japanese cinema will be conveyed to the world in a more multidimensional way, giving rise to new dialogues,” says Shu.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Playmaker has closed several significant distribution deals on Swiss box office hit “Barry & Me” ahead of its market premiere in Berlin.\n\n\tThe film, directed by German helmer Markus Welter, has sold to Estinfilm for the Baltics, Media Squad for Eastern Europe, Grand Entertainment for Motion Pictures for Middle East, Big Rights for Spain and Samuel Goldwyn Films for the U.S.\n\n\tThe distributors in Germany and Switzerland are Wild Bunch and Ascot Elite, respectively. The film has been playing in Swiss cinemas since Jan. 14 and will be released in Germany next month. It’s a box office success in Switzerland and, in its second weekend, reached a total of over 45,000 admissions.\n\t\n\n\tThe children’s film is inspired by the Swiss legend of the barrel-wearing rescue dogs who helped recover dozens of people swept up in avalanches in the 1800s. This version, however, focuses on his friendship with 12-year-old Georg, who discovers and secretly raises the puppy in a mountain infirmary, leading to  adventures in the Swiss Alps.\n\n\n\t“Barry & Me” is a Swiss-German co-production by Atlantis Pictures and MMC Zodiac. It is supported by the Zürcher Filmstiftung, the Deutscher Filmförderungsfonds, the Film und Medienstiftung NRW, the Bundesamt für Kultur, the Filmförderungsanstalt FFA, Suissimage, the Kanton Luzern, and the Valais Film Commission.\n\n\tHighlights of the Playmaker’s Berlin slate include the sales launch of “The Unicorn That Said No,” a 3D animated family feature based on Marc-Uwe Kling’s international bestselling book.\n\n\tWelter made his feature directorial debut in 2009 with “Im Sog der Nacht,” which screened at the Max Ophüls Festival in Saarbrücken and the Zurich Film Festival. He went on to direct the TV movie “Die Käserei in Goldingen” and the 3D horror feature “One Way Trip 3D.”\n\t\n\n\tSubsequent projects included the SRF/ZDF co-production “Der Teufel von Mailand,” based on the novel by Martin Suter, which premiered at the Zurich Film Festival in 2012, and the SRF primetime feature “Altes Haus.” From 2012 onward, he helped shape the hit SRF series “Der Bestatter,” directing the first three seasons.\n\n\tHis later work for SRF included “Tatort — Kleine Prinzen,” and co-directing the comedy series “Seitentriebe.” In 2018, he directed the TV film “Weglaufen geht nicht.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGabe Klinger is celebrating two very different homecomings with the Berlinale world premiere of his sophomore fiction feature, “Isabel.” The film marks his first work in his home country of Brazil, a decade after breaking out with the Anton Yelchin-starring drama “Porto,” while also reuniting the director with Berlin, a festival he first attended as part of Berlinale Talents in 2004 and that he credits as being “highly influential” in his career. \n\t\n\n\t“Isabel” is produced by Rodrigo Teixeira via RT Features, the powerhouse banner behind Walter Salles’s Oscar-winning “I’m Still Here.” The film stars Marina Person as the titular character, a 50-something-year-old sommelière with a deep love of natural wines, who dreams of leaving her job at a Michelin-starred restaurant in São Paulo to open her own bar. “Isabel” was shot in 16mm film and developed in a lab in London, to echo the artisanal nature of natural wines.  \n\n\tSpeaking with Variety ahead of the film’s premiere, Klinger cites Éric Rohmer’s “The Green Ray” as a major influence for his intimate character study. “It was a very important foundation when it came to setting a tone for the film, veering into something more naturalistic, realistic and that deals directly with the day to day.” Another major influence was Luis Sérgio Person’s seminal 1965 drama “São Paulo, Incorporated,” one of the most influential films about the sprawling Brazilian capital city. \n\n\n\tIt was a joy for the director, then, when Luis Sérgio’s daughter, Marina Person, agreed to star in the film. “I enjoy having these cinematic connections in my film. Working with Marina was a way of connecting with the history of the cinema of São Paulo, too,” he said. \n\t\n\n\tPerson, who first rose to national prominence as a leading MTV VJ between 1995 and 2011, worked extensively as a presenter in Brazilian television before dedicating herself to directing. In 2015, she released her directorial debut, “California,” and has since directed projects for major streamers such as Netflix and Globoplay. Although she has extensively appeared on camera, Person is not necessarily known as an actor, which Klinger says caused a certain “estrangement” to those who heard of her casting in his film. \n\n\t“Marina was a daring proposition,” he says. “A lot of people asked me why I cast her, given that Marina isn’t a conventional actress. It is almost like working with a non-actor. Acting isn’t a regular practice for her. It’s not her routine. Still, I feel Marina incorporates the essence of the city of São Paulo.” \n\n\tTo Person, there was an almost instant creative chemistry. In a full circle moment, she recalls first meeting Klinger at a screening of “São Paulo, Incorporated,” going on to praise the director for his “generosity” during the development of “Isabel.” Not only does Person star in the film, she is also credited as a writer, having worked alongside Klinger on shaping her character and the script. \n\n\t“Gabe gave me complete freedom when we worked together on the story,” she says. “Then, when I got a copy of the final script, my name was on the front page. It wasn’t something I asked for but Gabe was very generous because it is unusual to have directors giving actors writing credit.” \n\n\tThe actor says she had a “strong synergy” with Isabel’s story. “Gabe didn’t know it beforehand, but I am very connected to the world of natural wines. Before the pandemic, I even thought about opening a wine bar with my partner. It was a dream that only lasted a few months, and I am glad we didn’t follow through. But the coincidence was interesting; life is crazy this way.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: Urban Factory\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAsked about the 10-year gap between his two fiction projects, Klinger says he needed to “understand [his] place within cinema.” “I come from the world of criticism, curation and teaching, but my dream was always to make cinema. I wanted to understand the industry, because understanding how to make cinema is very different than thinking and writing about cinema.”\n\t\n\n\tReturning to live in São Paulo after years spent in Chicago, the director recalls a deep desire to return to his roots, but he felt things were “unstable” in his home country at the time. “I came back right before the 2022 presidential elections and decided to stay,” he recalls. “I already had friends in the film industry, and I felt like it was working. There was some dread and anguish when things didn’t quite work out the way I wanted, but this film represents a new chapter in my career, so I’m very happy.” \n\n\tAs for working with leading Brazilian producer Rodrigo Teixeira, Klinger has nothing but praise. He recalls first meeting the veteran on the New York indie scene well over a decade ago, when the producer was financing Noah Baumbach’s “Frances Ha.” “I belonged to this small group of creatives in New York with Baumbach, Greta Gerwig and the Safdies. I slept on their couches when I had a low-paying job at the Museum of Modern Art. I lived in the apartment you see on ‘Frances Ha.’”\n\n\t“Every time Rodrigo and I meet, we talk about films, and not just our films,” he adds. “One day, we got talking about ‘Isabel.’ We realized we weren’t getting any public funding for the film. We tried everything. So he said: We have a little money left from another project. It all happened very quickly and working with him was a luxury in the sense that he completely trusted us. He only visited the set once. He did not interfere in our creative process at all. We also realized during the campaign for ‘I’m Still Here’ that it would benefit us in a way.”\n\n\tIn that sense, Teixeira reminded Klinger of his previous producer in “Porto,” recent Golden Lion winner Jim Jarmusch. “He is a director who demands final cut, who believes the director to be the absolute authority when it comes to filmmaking. I also see myself as an auteur, and Rodrigo understands that. He wants what’s best for the film.”\n\n\tAs for premiering “Isabel” in Berlin, Klinger brings up another cherished memory: meeting Richard Linklater and James Benning at the after-party for “Before Midnight” at the festival. That night, the Brazilian director approached the two Americans with the seed for what was to become his feature debut, “Double Play: James Benning and Richard Linklater,” winner of a Golden Lion at Venice for the Best Documentary on Cinema in 2013.\n\t\n\n\t“My first film was born at the Berlinale, so it’s very symbolic for me to return to Berlin over a decade later, with my first Brazilian film, and a film I’m very proud of.” \n\n\t“Isabel” is produced by Rodrigo Teixeira via RT Features and Frédéric Corvez via Urban Factory, in association with VideoFilmes. Urban Sales handles international sales.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile Taiwan has just one official selection in the 2026 Berlinale lineup — Zhuang Rong Zuo’s short “Tutti” in the Generation Kplus strand — the island nation sports a significant presence at the European Film Market with a diverse slate.\n\n\tThe Taiwan Creative Content Agency (TAICCA) is spearheading the territory’s EFM activities with its Taiwan Pavilion and Taiwan Spotlight Pitching Session, while production companies Flash Forward Entertainment, GrX Studio and Pegasus Entertainment are marketing titles ranging from action blockbusters to single-take horror and cross-cultural romance.\n\t\n\n\tFlash Forward Entertainment, the Taipei-based production and sales outfit led by veteran producer Patrick Mao Huang, arrives with its most ambitious slate to date, positioning itself as a key bridge between Asian creativity and European financing. Leading the lineup is action-drama “A Dance With Rainbows,” which recently opened to critical acclaim and strong box office in Taiwan. Directed by Lee Yi-shan, the gritty coming-of-age boxing story stars rising talent Lin Yi-ting alongside veterans Tsai Chen-nan and You An-shun. The film won the Golden Horse Award for best action choreography, with Hong Kong rights already acquired by Golden Scene. \n\n\n\tThe company is also behind “Bliss: Beyond the Edge of Time,” a sci-fi anthology comprising six distinct animated shorts by different directors exploring futuristic concepts through Eastern philosophy. VR animation-documentary hybrid “The Island of Shells” delves into Taiwan’s White Terror era on Green Island, inspired by political prisoner Fred Chin’s testimony.\n\t\n\n\tSelected for the 2026 Berlinale Co-Production Market is Flash Forward’s “Lotus Feet,” the sophomore feature from Malaysian director Amanda Nell Eu, whose debut, “Tiger Stripes,” won the Grand Prix at Cannes Critics’ Week. The body-horror project is a Malaysia-Germany-Indonesia-Taiwan co-production that has secured support from the Hubert Bals Fund and Golden Horse Film Project Promotion.\n\n\tAlso seeking partners are “The Daughter,” a horror film directed by Tian Guan, whose short “The Poison Cat” was selected for Venice. “Blok 62” unites Croatia, Serbia, Estonia, Lithuania and Taiwan in a dystopian thriller directed by Vanja Vascarac.\n\n\tIn development is “Millennium Town,” an eight-episode sci-fi series created by François Chang, a La Fémis graduate. The time loop story set in 1999 features Hugo and Nebula Award winner Ken Liu — consultant for Netflix’s “3 Body Problem” — as script consultant.\n\n\tGrX Studio — the outfit behind Netflix hit “Copycat Killer” and “The Tag-Along” horror franchise — is shopping “The Photo From 1977,” a period romance directed by Frank Cheng and Tang Sheng-Jung. The cross-cultural love story stars Korean hallyu sensation Jung Jin-Young opposite Taiwanese star Moon Lee. Set in 1977 Zhongli City, the film follows a Hakka photographer who falls for a Korean taekwondo coach, with their romance unfolding against the backdrop of Korea’s student movement.\n\n\tPegasus Entertainment is marketing three completed features across diverse genres. “Suffocation” is a horror film shot as a single 99-minute take. The film centers on a mysterious suicide at a high school swimming pool that triggers a deadly campus curse, exploring themes of teacher-student romance and peer bullying. The film stars Yao Ai Ning and Wang Yu Ping. “Summer Blue Hour,” a romantic drama adapted from a novel, features an original theme song by famous Taiwanese singer Cheer Chen. The film stars Shih Bo-Yu, Cheng Yu-xi and Lin Zi-hong.\n\n\tPegasus is also marketing “Secret Lover (Theatrical Version),” a re-edited 120-minute theatrical cut of the BL series adapted from Japanese manga artist Komeoka Sig’s “How Could It Possibly End After Just Reaching Climax?” that premiered worldwide in 2025. \n\n\tThe Taiwan Spotlight Pitching Session features five projects in development. Etsen Chen’s “No Money No Honey,” an LGBTQ-themed project from Flash Forward Entertainment and A House Film Production, arrives from the DANAFF Project Market and KVIFF Industry Days. Other projects include Huang Hui-chen’s “Lomá,” a social justice frontier drama from Your Sister Films; Su I-Hsuan’s “Burning Blossoms,” a romantic historical thriller from Suz Creative Studio; Angel Teng I-han’s “The Lovers Untitled,” a sci-fi LGBTQ romance from Long Moment Films; and Tsao Shih-han’s crime romance “Girl, Boy, the World’s End” from Life Scenery Films.\n\t\n\n\tThe Taiwan Pavilion presents completed features and works-in-progress. Tracy Choi’s “Girlfriends,” from Serendipity Films, arrives from Busan’s Vision section. It was developed through the 2023 Golden Horse Film Project Promotion and Torino Film Lab. Su Ta’s “Oh My Ghost! Oh My God!” from Sky Films Entertainment features Japanese comedy star Naomi Watanabe alongside Jasper Liu. Tsai Yin-chuan’s “That Burning House” from the Movie Bird Films premiered at Tallinn Black Nights’ after development at Locarno Pro and winning the Taipei Golden Creativity Award. Kiwi Chow’s “Deadline” from Benchmark Films screened at International Film Festival Rotterdam, while Lee Chun-i’s XR project “The Time Machine” from Pan Da Planet received grants from both Kaohsiung Film Archive and the Ministry of Culture. Toe Yuen’s animated feature “A Mighty Adventure,” produced by Zero One Film and FlyStudio,  claimed the Sky Animation Award at the Hong Kong-Asia Film Financing Forum.\n\n\tTAICCA presents three significant restorations. Yang Li-kuo’s “The Dull-Ice Flower,” which won a Berlinale prize in 1990 and received a UNESCO Special Prize for Humanitarian Affairs, returns in 2K. Wan Jen’s “Connection by Fate,” a 1998 Venice competition title, also screens in 2K. Tsai Ming-liang’s 1994 Venice Golden Lion winner “Vive L’Amour” will be presented in 4K. Kiki Liu’s novel “Girl in an Odd City,” described as adolescent coming-of-age magical realism, is being showcased in the Books at Berlinale program.\n\n\t“As the first major international film market of the year, the EFM is not only a vital indicator of global cinema trends but also a gateway for Taiwanese content to engage with the world,” says TAICCA chair Sue Wang. “Through our participation, we aim to bridge the gap between the international community and Taiwan’s creative industries. We also want to showcase Taiwan’s proactive commitment to international co-productions and investments, leveraging our multicultural advantages to foster more exceptional collaborative projects on a global scale.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s a strange but perhaps fitting paradox of these uncertain times that while African cinema is enjoying greater visibility than ever before, the market for that output could very well be shrinking. For the continent’s industry professionals taking part in this year’s European Film Market, the hope in a frosty Berlin is that they won’t be…well, left out in the cold.\n\n\tFirst, the good news: From a creative standpoint, African cinema is thriving, with premieres at top-shelf film festivals now the norm for the continent’s filmmakers. This year’s Berlinale will see both Chadian auteur Mahamat-Saleh Haroun (“Soumsoum, the Night of the Stars”) and Silver Bear-winning French Senegalese filmmaker Alain Gomis (“Dao”) vying for the Golden Bear.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, in the festival’s Panorama strand, Nigeria’s Olive Nwosu will screen her debut feature, “Lady,” which arrives in Berlin fresh off its prize-winning Sundance premiere, while South African rising talent Sandulela Asanda’s debut “Black Burns Fast” will have its international premiere in the Generation 14plus section. \n\n\n\tThe continent is abuzz with fresh talents and flush with new investment. Financial vehicles such as the African Export-Import Bank’s billion-dollar Africa Film Fund, Next Narrative Africa and HEVA Fund’s $40 million content creator initiative and a raft of other funding schemes have signaled a concerted effort — perhaps for the first time ever — to inject a steady stream of cash into the continent’s screen industries.\n\n\tBut who’s buying?\n\n\tRecent waves of consolidation and course-correction among the global streaming platforms have seen them drastically scale back their investment in the continent. As a result, after a brief flirtation with a truly global distribution pipeline, opportunities largely seem to be dwindling for African filmmakers to reach worldwide audiences.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, hardly five months after France’s Canal+ Group completed its long-gestating $2 billion takeover of South African pay-TV giant MultiChoice, solidifying a merger of the two largest media players on the continent, a sense of foreboding remains over the fallout.\n\n\t“It is terrifying to think that there is one less buyer in an already shrinking market,” says Urucu Media’s Cait Pansegrouw, who produced Asanda’s “Black Burns Fast,” and is currently in post-production on the forthcoming feature from South Africa’s John Trengove (“The Wound,” “Manodrome”).\n\n\t“I’m hoping it will give a sense of stabilization in the industry,” she adds. “But because they haven’t been very forthcoming about what their strategy is, I don’t know what that stability looks like.”\n\n\tLast month, Canal+ CFO Amandine ‌Ferré announced that the company was assessing its plans for ‌MultiChoice’s streaming service Showmax, insisting that the platform’s losses are “a big issue” and “not acceptable” for the French media giant. Any cost-cutting measures at the homegrown streamer would deal a severe blow to the many African filmmakers it’s supported. (Canal+ and MultiChoice were unable to comment before this story went to press.) \n\n\tFor its part, Canal+ has signaled its intent to take big swings on prestige African content, recently greenlighting “Heist of Benin,” a film directed by Ava DuVernay and starring David Oyelowo. It also insists it’s doubling down on its mission to give a global platform to breakout African series like sports drama “Spinners” and period epic “Shaka iLembe.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOlive Nwosu’s “Lady” premiered at Sundance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HanWay Films\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMoses Babatope, the former Odeon exec who launched his Lagos-based production and distribution company Nile Media Entertainment Group in 2024, notes that the contraction in the global streaming space has prompted a “reset” in the African market — and along with it, some much-needed soul-searching.\n\n\t“It’s pushing us now to have real conversations on our over-reliance on foreign-owned platforms for monetization,” he says. “That’s not how you build a viable, thriving industry.”\n\n\tMarie Lora-Mungai, founder of advisory firm Restless Global and a leading expert on Africa’s creative industries, agrees, noting that “African industry professionals are not sitting idle” in the face of ongoing disruptions.\n\t\n\n\t“In Nigeria especially, we’re seeing a real push to experiment with local solutions, even as global streamers retreat or become more selective,” she says. “Although the distribution crunch is brutal, what makes me hopeful is that the response is becoming more sophisticated: fewer illusions about easy scale, more experimentation with format, technology and global cultural positioning. \n\n\t“That’s a healthier place to be than quiet dependence on global streamers that can pivot away overnight,” she adds.\n\n\tThere are other bright spots. While theatrical exhibition has struggled across much of the globe, it’s seen a renaissance in several African markets, with Nigeria breaking box-office records last year and Pathé Cinemas steadily growing its footprint across the continent. A small subset of filmmakers, such as Nigeria’s Omoni Oboli and Ruth Kadiri, are thriving on platforms like YouTube, buttressing hopes that a homegrown creator economy in Africa might someday prosper.\n\n\tAcross the board, there is a sense that African industry professionals are playing the long game. For investors like the Logical Pictures Group, the film and TV equity giant that launched its Logical African Stories fund in 2024, the goal is to invest in companies “across the ecosystem of TV and cinema,” including studios, post-production facilities and distribution companies, according to Logical Pictures Africa’s Pape Boye. “We want to support creativity at the source.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Soumsoum, the Night of the Stars” will compete for the Golden Bear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Pili Films\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWith the right support systems in place, such creativity will thrive, as recent accolades can attest. Witness Nigerian director Akinola Davies Jr.’s scintillating debut, “My Father’s Shadow,” which was one of the most talked-about titles at last year’s Cannes Film Festival, or South African directing duo Jason Jacobs and Devon Delmar’s “Variations on a Theme,” which just scooped the Tiger Award in Rotterdam.\n\n\tOf course, such triumphs alone won’t “solve the mass-market distribution problem,” notes Lora-Mungai. But they do prove that “African storytelling is increasingly legible, competitive and valued at the highest global levels. This matters for reputation, deal-flow and future financing.”\n\t\n\n\tIt remains to be seen how such factors will play out at this year’s EFM. But Jean-Christophe Simon, CEO of Films Boutique, which is repping Haroun’s Golden Bear contender “Soumsoum,” insists there are reasons for African filmmakers in Berlin to be hopeful. \n\n\tThough “the arthouse market is really tough these days,” Simon notes that there’s still “a certain excitement” among distributors encountering movies from countries that are still largely underrepresented on screen. He points to the success of Haroun’s last film, “Lingui, the Sacred Bonds,” which competed for the Palme d’Or in 2021 and sold to more than 25 countries, including the U.S. and the U.K. with Mubi.\n\n\tThe sales veteran also cites one other bright spot for the sellers convening this week in the Gropius Bas. “Berlin is one of the best places to premiere, because it’s a place where distributors take a bit more risk.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor Gemma Chan, making “Josephine” was deeply personal.\n\n\tThe British actress, best known for her work in “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Eternals,” stars in Beth de Araújo’s buzzy drama as Claire, a mother attempting to help her 8-year-old daughter Josephine (played by newcomer Mason Reeves) after she witnesses a brutal rape in a San Francisco park. A court case hinges on the young girl’s testimony, and Claire and her husband Damien (a strikingly vulnerable Channing Tatum) struggle with whether they should allow their daughter to take the stand.\n\t\n\n\tThe story behind “Josephine” — which premiered at Sundance last month and became one of its biggest breakouts, winning the grand jury prize and audience award — is based on a similar experience de Araújo had as a child. This resonated strongly with Chan, who in 2012 witnessed a fatal stabbing in London and bravely decided to testify in court.\n\n\n\t“It was a big part of me wanting to be a part of the story and connecting to it emotionally,” Chan tells Variety over the phone two days before “Josephine’s” international premiere in competition at the Berlin Film Festival. “The world is a very dangerous place. Unfortunately, I know that and many people know that. It just really hit a raw nerve with me.”\n\n\tChan was the first person on board the project after de Araújo sent her the script in 2019. “I really believed in her vision for the film and it just felt like there was so much truth in every page of the script,” she says. “It was attempting to tell a story that I didn’t feel had any been told in that way before. This is very challenging, difficult subject matter, but I never felt that she was coming at it from an angle that was exploitative or trying to sensationalize anything.”\n\t\n\n\tBut then the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the production was delayed, with de Araújo gaining more steam for another film that would become her feature debut, the 2022 psychological thriller “Soft & Quiet.” However, “Josephine” stuck in both of their minds. “It was a bit of a winding road,” Chan admits, but in spring 2024 filming was finally able to commence thanks to support from producer David Kaplan as well as Chan and Tatum signing on to produce. \n\n\t“It’s a small miracle that the film was made and I’m so proud of it,” Chan says. “I wanted to do whatever I could to help the project get off the ground.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGemma Chan, Mason Reeves and Channing Tatum in “Josephine.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGreta Zozula\n\t\n\n\n\n\tChan delivers a quietly powerful performance in “Josephine,” with many heart-wrenching scenes in which she says one thing and communicates an entirely different emotion with her eyes. Chan credits the environment on set with allowing her to be fully vulnerable.\n\n\t“Nothing had to be forced,” she says. “It was really a place where we could find the truth of the scene and I was able to be just emotionally truthful.” \n\n\tAnd, Chan and Tatum had a secret weapon: Reeves, who de Araújo scouted at a farmer’s market and had never acted before. “She really brought out the best in Channing and I,” Chan says. “There was no artifice at all. I’m just in awe of her — she’s amazing and wise beyond her years.” \n\n\tBefore “Josephine” premiered at Sundance, Chan says she had no idea how it would be received. But watching it with an audience for the first time, relief washed over her.\n\n\t“It was special and I was really moved by the way that people connected with it,” she says. “For it to have won the awards is just the icing on top.”\n\n\tMore people will get to watch “Josephine” soon, now that it’s been acquired for U.S. release by the relatively new distributor Sumerian Pictures. Though it may not be a name most have heard before, Chan is confident that the company will be able to give the movie the rollout it deserves as it sparks early awards buzz.\n\n\t“I feel that they really believe in the film and understand what it is and they are really excited for audiences to see it,” she says. “We were very much led by what Beth felt was right and it just felt like it was a good match for a whole bunch of different reasons.”\n\t\n\n\tAs the film still has yet to score distribution in Europe, Chan has her “fingers crossed” ahead of its Berlin premiere that buyers will take notice. But she also hopes it can spark important conversations between festivalgoers.\n\n\t“The film asks the question, ‘How does a young person deal with the violence of the world?’ And really, that can extend to all of us,” she says. “How do we persevere, how do we respond, how can we overcome fear and hatred and trauma and still hold onto our humanity? And that’s a question that I think is really important for where we are at the moment in the world.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tVeteran actor David Harewood, known for “Homeland,” “Sherwood” and “Supergirl,” is finally leading a show with “Pierre.”\n\n\t“It’s my first lead character in a 40-year career, which is quite extraordinary, and the first time I’ve been number one on the call sheet. It’s an exciting place to be.”\n\n\t“I’m very lucky to have worked with fabulous ‘number ones’ like Claire Danes and Melissa Benoist on ‘Supergirl,’ who really set the tone on set. If they’re not moaning, nobody can moan. I was looking forward to setting that tone myself.”\n\t\n\n\tHe “loved being in the position of leading,” he admits. “I wanted to make sure I was open and accessible. It was a difficult shoot and I texted one of my ‘number one’ pals, saying: ‘Oh, so that’s what it’s like.’ You are there all day, every day, in every scene. But it was wonderful.”\n\n\n\tHarewood, who accepted an OBE for his service to drama and charity, recently reprised the role of “Othello” in the West End. “I’m pretty exhausted and I find myself eating all sorts of terrible food. I keep telling myself I deserve it,” he laughs. \n\n\tIn “Pierre,” he plays a West London duty solicitor shaken up by the suspicious death of his young black client, Michael.\n\n\t“I think this young lad sparks something in Pierre. He sparks a memory of someone he used to be. Now, Pierre is prepared to walk through fire in order to do the right thing. It comes at a cost, because he runs into something he wasn’t expecting to find.”\n\n\t“Pierre” is produced by The Lighthouse for Channel 4.  International distribution of the series is handled by Sphere Abacus.\n\t\n\n\tSarmad Masud is the lead director, Jo Johnson produces and Roy Williams and John Donnelly are the co-writers. Jason Flemyng, Michele Austin, Dean-Charles Chapman, Nikkita Chadha, Christopher Fairbank, Sara Powell, Cherrelle Skeete, Dylan Ennis and Ezrae Maye also star.\n\n\tPlaying Pierre allowed Harewood to showcase his skills. \n\n\t“For the first time, I’ve been able to show my full range: the funny, the serious, the clever and the witty. The husband, the dedicated father, the public servant. It was such a wonderful experience to reflect all these things in one character.”\n\n\tPierre’s occupation was a big draw. “We’re drowning in superheroes now, but there are real-life superheroes: nurses and doctors, and people who go above and beyond every day to fulfill their public service. Duty solicitors get a bad rap, yet they will show up at three or four in the morning to ensure people are protected by the law. That’s really honorable,” he says. He reached out to a few of them, too.\n\n\t“I was on a morning show once and there was this fairly high-powered solicitor. I mentioned I was playing a duty solicitor and he immediately went: ‘They’re not very good.’ That’s the arrogance of people. They’re not doing it for the money – they’re doing it because they feel that people in vulnerable positions need help. Some have already contacted me, saying: ‘Thank God someone’s telling our side of the story’.” \n\n\tDespite his foibles, “wonderfully human” Pierre is a bit of a throwback to the characters we used to see, notes Harewood.\n\n\t“He wears his heart on his sleeve and thinks of himself last. He has a wonderful knack for loving people who might otherwise be difficult to love, and he’ll go the extra mile for them. We need more Pierres in this world.”\n\n\tIn the show, he’s surrounded by quirky supporting characters, including one played by Joy Richardson. \n\n\t“She’s based on a real woman who used to dress head to toe in white and wear white powder on her face. Most people, I’m sure, would give her a wide berth. But even those on the margins of the society need someone to talk to. They need a superhero to stand up for them and Pierre is prepared to do that.”\n\n\tReflecting on the changes in the industry, Harewood can be blunt.\n\t\n\n\t“I am not sure if people think very deeply these days. Matt Damon just did Netflix’s ‘The Rip’ and admitted you have to restate the plot because people are on their phones and they’re not really watching. Both George Clooney and Leonardo DiCaprio have mentioned that the era of people going out to the movies might be over.”\n\n\tHe adds: “I think the pandemic sent us all nuts and it has certainly changed behaviors. We’re in a new age of attention. It’s no longer about stars; it’s about characters and stories. I like that. People will always show up when those ingredients are in the pie.”\n\n\tSpeaking of characters – the plan is for Pierre to return. But first, he needs to make some lifestyle changes. \n\n\t“You have to as you age. I also used to throw myself all over the place without thinking about it. Now, after finishing that play, I have bruises all over. Pierre realizes that continuing as he is isn’t good enough. By the end of the first season, you’ll see a man who’s made some really difficult choices – for the better,” teases Harewood.  \n\n\t“In the last five years, I’ve been very fortunate to discover things that have impacted my life and work in a major way. I’m looking for characters like that, too – ones who aren’t stuck and want to make the world a better place. God knows we need them.”\n\n\t“I don’t think it’s about growing old – it’s about getting better. Even good guys can get better.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe cast of “Grey’s Anatomy” is speaking out following the death of Eric Dane. The actor, who appeared as Dr. Mark Sloane for 145 episodes of the ABC medical drama, died on Feb. 19 after a battle with ALS.\n\n\t“Eric was a light. You’d see it effortlessly shine from him on the set of Grey’s as well as when he was with Rebecca and the girls. During filming, he’d get this twinkle in his eye and with a mischievous look, he would deliver with perfect comedic timing, a line of dialogue that would floor you! You will be missed,” Kim Raver, who portrays Dr. Teddy Altman on “Grey’s,” posted via Instagram. “My love and thoughts go out to Rebecca and their girls. We love you.”\n\t\n\n\tLongtime executive producer Krista Vernoff shared screenshots of a text conversation with Dane in 2021 when he returned to the show for a cameo, nine years after his exit.\n\n\n\t“I called Eric and he answered immediately. I said will you come back? I know it’s a pandemic and shooting is a nightmare but we’re gonna do it on the beach and keep our social distance because the world needs joy and Mark and Lexie are joy. He said where and when,” she captioned the post. “When I came to set that day, he said, we’re breaking the rules and hugging now right? The thing I will remember most about Eric Dane are his hugs. The best hugs. Oh my friend. I wish you peace.”\n\n\tDane, whose character was known as “McSteamy,” joined “Grey’s Anatomy” in Season 2 as a guest star. However, the audience quickly fell in love with the character, and he returned in Season 3 as a series regular. He made his final appearance in the second episode of Season 9, when Mark died after being taken off life support following a plane crash. Creator Shonda Rhimes has often said that the character was one of her favorites to write. He appeared in a 2021 episode, as part of Meredith’s dream sequence.\n\t\n\n\t“We are deeply saddened by the loss of Eric Dane,” ABC and 20th Television said in a statement. “His remarkable talent and unforgettable presence on ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ left a lasting impact on audiences around the world, and his courage and grace during his battle with ALS inspired so many. Our hearts are with his family, friends, and colleagues, as well as the many fans whose lives were touched by his work.”\n\n\tIn April 2025, only 11 months before his death, Dane announced he had been diagnosed with ALS.\n\n\tLast month, during the ALS Network Champions for Cures & Care Gala, Pompeo revealed in a pre-recorded video that she texted Dane immediately after learning of his diagnosis. “As soon as I heard about his diagnosis, I texted him, and I said, ‘I’m here if you want to speak.’ And my phone rang 30 seconds later,” she said at the time.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“I’m Still Here” star Selton Mello will follow up his big studio turn in Tom Gormican’s “Anaconda” with João Paulo Miranda Maria’s “I Don’t Even Know Who I Was.” The film is produced by the recent Un Certain Regard-winning label Les Valseurs (“The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo”) and is currently being filmed in Paris. \n\n\t“I’m always searching for projects that remind me why I fell in love with cinema,” said Mello. “Here in Paris, I’ve found the perfect partners to bring to life this feverish poem, a delicate meditation on grief and cinema, shot on 35mm. João Paulo is one of the most fascinating and talented filmmakers I’ve met in recent years, and Les Valseurs is the ideal production company, with a remarkable instinct for crafting films driven by creative force.”\n\t\n\n\tThe actor emphasized he is living a “truly unique and special moment” in his life, “discovering new cultures and expanding my creativity into new territories.” “Everything about this project is deeply inspiring, and I can say it has been one of the greatest artistic challenges I’ve ever embraced: expressing myself in four different languages. It demanded immense concentration, yet it stimulated me in such a profound way that I will never forget the experience.”\n\n\n\t“We have long admired Selton Mello’s work as both actor and filmmaker and are honored by the trust he has placed in João Paulo Miranda Maria’s new daring cinematographic gesture,” said Les Valseurs’ co-founders Justin Pechberty and Damien Megherbi, adding that this is a “film that goes against the grain of an era saturated with manufactured images.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“I’m Still Here,” courtesy of Globoplay\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: Alile Dara Onawale – Globoplay\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWith plot details still kept tightly under wraps, “I Don’t Even Know Who I Was” continues Mello’s buzzy project line-up following his high-profile performance in Walter Salles’s Oscar-winning drama. The actor also recently shot his Spanish-language debut, Dominga Sotomayor’s highly anticipated “La Perra,” also produced by Rodrigo Teixeira’s RT Features. \n\n\tMiranda Maria, who currently lives in France, received the Cannes Label in 2020 for his feature debut “Memory House,” while his short film “The Girl Who Danced With the Devil” won a Special Mention at the same festival in 2016. \n\n\tFrench production and distribution company Les Valseurs has a long history of championing Brazilian filmmaking, having previously worked on titles including Nara Normande and Tião’s “Heartless,” Leonardo Martinelli’s “Samba Infinito” and the upcoming “The French Teacher,” directed by Ricardo Alves Jr. and starring Grace Passô, who currently premiered her directorial feature debut “Our Secret” at the Berlin Film Festival. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Hong Kong International Film Festival Society will present four projects selected through new partnerships with Jakarta Film Week, JAFF Market and the Japan Creator Support Fund at the upcoming HKIFF Industry Project Market.\n\n\tThe development-stage titles – Loeloe Hendra Komara’s “A Life Full of Holes,” Najam Yardo’s “PingPong,” Kusano Natsuka’s “Unknown Face” and the stop-motion animation “Hidari” from Kawamura Masashi and Ogawa Iku – join 42 previously announced in-development and work-in-progress projects for the 24th Hong Kong-Asia Film Financing Forum. The market runs March 17-19 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre alongside FilMart, now in its 30th edition.\n\t\n\n\tHKIFF Industry is expanding its Jakarta Film Week partnership to include JAFF Market, supporting Indonesia’s film sector with backing from the country’s Ministry of Culture through its National Talent Management programme.\n\n\n\t“The ongoing collaboration with HKIFF Industry plays a crucial role in creating a sustainable platform for the development and networking of Indonesian talents and projects within the Asian and international film circuits,” said Vivian Idris, promoter of National Talent Management for Film.\n\n\tTwo Indonesian projects comprise the Jakarta Film Week & JAFF Market section. Komara’s “A Life Full of Holes” follows a 17-year-old girl who dreams of becoming a content creator while caring for her young siblings after her mother leaves to work overseas as a migrant worker.

    "body": "\n\tAnimation suits Las Vegas. From “CSI” to “Hacks,” Sin City has no shortage of representations on television. But the Netflix comedy “Strip Law” — created by Cullen Crawford, an alum of the satirical site ClickHole as well as “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” — has an advantage in capturing the spirit of its setting. Thanks to the magic of its medium, “Strip Law” can craft a fictional version of Vegas that’s almost as absurd as the actual place: a city where magicians and animals have an annual cage match, beret-wearing comedian George Wallace is the mayor and a law firm’s clients can include an Austin Powers impersonator on trial for puking on an infant.\n\t\n\n\tSaid law firm is owned by Lincoln Gumb (Adam Scott), a straitlaced attorney who’s inherited the business from his late mother. Lincoln is a good lawyer, yet lacks the showmanship necessary to win over the jaded, capricious local jury pool: “You’re a Vegas lawyer, but you think you’re better than Vegas,” he’s told in the premiere. So Lincoln joins forces with magician Sheila Flambé (Janelle James), a “human highlight reel” who takes on the title of creative director to give Lincoln’s work a desperately needed dose of razzle-dazzle. Lincoln can file a brief, but only Sheila is willing to electrocute herself in court to prove that heaven isn’t real. (“Strip Law” does provide context for this unorthodox tactic, but it also doesn’t need much.)\n\n\n\tLincoln’s other employees — surly teenage niece Irene (Shannon Gisela), who acts as in-house investigator, and aging fixer Glem Blorchman (Stephen Root) — assist in these efforts, but like the old cliché about “Sex and the City,” the real main character of “Strip Law” is Las Vegas itself. Crawford and his writers cram in sight gags to build an exaggerated, if clearly affectionate, sense of place. The opening credits, which boast that the show was “proudly made by real, non-computer human beings,” speed past various storefronts on the titular iconic street. The signs vary episode to episode, but include “Circumcision by Elvis,” the “Mafia Goons Hall of Fame” and a “Sexxxual Grocery Store.” \n\t\n\n\tThe joke density of “Strip Law,” so rare on TV these days, makes it enormously likeable. So do the vocal performances: Scott is perfectly typecast as the downtrodden straight man who his new partner diagnoses with “a terminal case of Pete Buttigieg energy,” while Sheila is even more of a flamboyant wild card than James’ breakout character Principal Ava on “Abbott Elementary.” A meta streak gently pokes fun at the legal procedural genre “Strip Law” toys with the conventions of — “We just have to cut to the last part of these weekly cases where we do something inventive but kind of stupid and then win!” — while a willingness to experiment with the visuals leads to sequences in the style of anime or even live action, including cameos from a couple recognizable comedians.\n\n\tBut there’s also a deftly cultivated backstory that gives Lincoln’s arc some emotional stakes on top of its entertainment value. Along with her partner Steve Nichols (Keith David), Lincoln’s late mom was a great Vegas lawyer. (Credit to the writers of their firm’s jingle: “Nichols and gum, they’re two things in your pocket…” has been stuck in my head for days.) She was also, we come to realize, a subpar parent, and Lincoln’s attempts to both live up to and overcome her legacy reflect his complicated relationship with his hometown. Vegas can do a number on visitors, let alone a local — but “Strip Law” has a fondness for vintage flair and showmanship that proves infectious. Where else could your virtual reality HR training avatar be a composite of every member of the Rat Pack?\n\n\tAll 10 episodes of “Strip Law” are now streaming on Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe “Maxima” franchise, inspired by the life of Queen Máxima of the Netherlands and starring Delfina Chaves, is getting its first spin-off: “The Other Royals – A Maxima Story.” \n\n\tIn the meantime, Season 2 of “Maxima” will premiere locally on March 14, followed by an international rollout. \n\n\t“In the second season, we introduced the Dutch royals a bit more, but we couldn’t use everything. We show [Princes] Friso of Orange-Nassau and Constantijn of the Netherlands yet we never delve into their stories. There was so much more to tell,” said producer Rachel van Bommel.\n\t\n\n\tIn the spin-off – “Even ‘Bridgerton’ has ‘Queen Charlotte – A Bridgerton Story’,” added van Bommel – the team will focus on Princess Mabel of Orange-Nassau and Princess Margarita de Bourbon de Parme. In 1999, when the series begins, they both meet their future royal partners. \n\n\n\tThe five-hour series is produced by Millstreet Films in co-production with FBO and Beta Film. Claire Bender stars as Princess Mabel and Bram Suijker as Prince Friso. Saskia Diesing, director of “Maxima,” will direct with Hiba Vink.\n\n\t“It stays true to the franchise because it’s still all about the female perspective,” added Justus Riesenkampff, Beta Film’s EVP Nordics & Benelux. Or simply about “human perspective,” noted van Bommel. \n\n\t“If you give birth and then have to show yourself, and your child, to 17 million people, audiences can understand how that feels. They are royals, but they also have children who become teenagers, fall in love and sneak out of the house.”\n\t\n\n\tViewers may also appreciate the darker storylines in the spin-off. \n\n\t“Mabel is introduced in the second season and then her journey is much more tragic than Maxima’s. This serves as a counterpoint. Maxima seems almost untouchable at times. Everything works out for her. Mabel and Margarita struggle much more. And that, again, is actually very human,” noted Riesenkampff.\n\n\tAlthough it explores royal life, “Maxima” never loses sight of its Argentina-born protagonist. \n\n\t“Sometimes, we use archives in the series. It helps, because you suddenly realize: ‘Oh, this actually happened.’ But because we stay so close to her, people see it more as an emotional journey than a period piece,” said van Bommel.\n\n\t“We presented a special sneak preview in Miami and were told the audience really recognized themselves. They said: ‘We’re Hispanic, we’re immigrants and we feel for her.’ She’s moving to another country, trying to blend into this new culture. It’s a very universal and urgent story.” \n\n\t“That’s one of the key reasons why ‘Maxima’ has been so successful internationally. It’s a really unique reinvention of the royal drama genre because it’s really about Maxima. We had to convince every network, every buyer and every audience member of that, and we have done it,” stressed Riesenkampff.\n\n\tStill, the show is growing. With a third season already in development, it boasts some bigger scenes in the second, including the royal wedding. \n\n\t“We start big and then end with a coronation [10 years later]. That was definitely the challenge, so we reached out to our makeup and wardrobe departments as soon as we started thinking about a second season. Many of these events were televised and they are in everyone’s collective memory. Of course, we couldn’t get the Valentino dress that Maxima wore, but they did an amazing job.” \n\n\t“That’s the next step: what will their lives look like after the coronation? They will become king and queen, and it’s a whole new chapter in their lives.”\n\n\tRiesenkampff added: “Many European producers wouldn’t even try to go there, but Rachel succeeded with a budget that others would say could only result in a ‘local’ show. It’s rare to produce something like this out of Europe. It’s a clear sign that you don’t need 100 million to make a series that works.”\n\t\n\n\tWhat you do need, however, is plenty of collaborators willing to go the extra mile.  \n\n\t“The wedding takes place in a church right in the middle of Amsterdam. Normally, I would say: ‘We are not going there.’ In this case, the Amsterdam Public Department was working with us because everyone felt that it needed to be authentic. We couldn’t shoot in a studio,” said van Bommel.\n\n\t“‘Maxima’ is a perfect example of how you can collaborate with different parties, from Beta Film to RTL. It doesn’t have to be just one streamer that greenlights something.”\n\n\tFollowing “The Other Royals,” there might be even more to come. \n\n\t““There are many opportunities for telling different stories in very different formats. It’s a really big family and there’s drama everywhere,” laughed van Bommel.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tAll3Media International has revealed that IDTV’s global format hit “The Traitors” has now been commissioned in 40 territories, with Indonesia becoming the latest market to adapt the psychological reality competition.\n\n\tThe Indonesian version will be produced by Falcon, the leading local film production and distribution company founded in 2010 by H.B. Naveen, with production slated for 2026. The series will bow on Falcon’s streaming platform as a 10-episode celebrity edition.\n\t\n\n\tThere are also new European adaptations, with versions heading to Slovakia and Estonia. Serbia’s PRVA TV has commissioned a local adaptation to be produced by Rainmaker, while Malta will receive a celebrity edition produced by Greatt for Television Malta. The latest orders follow recent commissions in Turkey, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea, with an Indian version on Prime Video quickly picked up for a second season after a strong debut.\n\n\n\tThe format’s reach extends well beyond production. The “Traitors” brand has spread across six continents, with a London-based live experience currently running and a stage production confirmed for 2027. A consumer products rollout is also underway, encompassing tabletop games and a mobile game in development.\n\n\tThe ratings performance has been equally striking. The celebrity edition’s finale pulled in 15 million viewers on the BBC – marking it the top-rated broadcast of the year in the U.K. – with the series averaging 12.4 million viewers, a figure 249% above the slot average, and a 54.7% share that represented a 146% improvement on the slot norm. A second season has been commissioned. In Czech Republic, streaming platform Prima+ clocked 200 million video views last year – almost double the prior year’s figure — with “Zrádci,” the local adaptation, drawing the platform’s highest viewership; episodes from its second season were also simultaneously screened across 66 cinemas nationwide. In the U.S., Season 4 opened on Peacock to the franchise’s strongest debut to date, accumulating 3.2 billion minutes viewed within less than a month of its premiere.\n\t\n\n\tThe series has also carved out a formidable awards track record, taking home eight Emmy Awards – including Outstanding Reality Competition and Outstanding Host for a Reality or Competition Program for Alan Cumming for the U.S. Season 3 in 2025 – alongside two BAFTAs, two RTS Awards, five Asian Academy Creative Awards, a Rose d’Or and a Producers Guild Award.\n\n\t“‘The Traitors’ can only be described as a phenomenon,” said Louise Pedersen, CEO of All3Media International. “The global scale of the show and the passion of fans around the world is a testament to the originality and adaptability of the format and the skill of all of our local production partners. Reaching 40 territories at the start of 2026 is a significant milestone and we’re delighted that ‘The Traitors’ mix of intrigue, deception and drama will be delighting even more viewers around the world.”\n\n\tMichel Nillesen, managing director at IDTV, added: “Forty territories, and the game is only just beginning. This milestone underlines the global power of the format. ‘The Traitors’ proves that trust and betrayal resonate everywhere. We’re incredibly proud of this achievement and excited to continue expanding the brand internationally.”\n\n\tOriginally created and developed by IDTV in cooperation with RTL Creative Unit, “The Traitors” first aired on RTL 4 in the Netherlands in 2021 under the Dutch title “De Verraders.” The format brings together contestants in an elaborate setting where a concealed group of “Traitors” covertly plot to eliminate their fellow players, the “Faithful,” who must in turn expose and remove the Traitors in order to claim the prize money.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBollywood star Rani Mukerji is thrilled with the success of “Mardaani 3,” but the actor says the commercial milestone is secondary to the conversation the films have sparked around crimes against women.\n\n\tThe franchise, which follows Mumbai supercop Shivani Shivaji Roy as she confronts predators targeting women and children, has now run for 12 years and three films – each taking on a distinct social crime.\n\n\n\tWith “Mardaani 3” now the highest-grossing entry in the franchise – surpassing its predecessors with INR71.7 crore ($7.8 million) worldwide – Mukerji says the numbers matter less to her than the awareness they represent. “It is great that we have scored a hattrick of hits with ‘Mardaani’ but that’s not as important as us trying to discuss very important social issues that deserve all our attention,” she says. “It will always be a call to address such crimes head on and tell us not to look away because it might not be affecting us.”\n\t\n\n\t“Even if one girl is affected, targeted and attacked, it is the failure of our society that we haven’t been able to protect her,” Mukerji adds. “So, hopefully the conversation that the ‘Mardaani’ franchise has created for so many years has resulted into us being more aware and more careful and attentive.”\n\n\tReflecting on what the franchise’s sustained audience connect means to her, Mukerji says, “I have always believed that ‘Mardaani’ is not just a film, it is a voice – a voice for every woman who refuses to be silenced. The love and success of ‘Mardaani 3’ feels deeply personal, because it tells me that audiences are not just watching someone like Shivani Shivaji Roy’s journey, they are standing with her for justice, for the victory of good over evil.”\n\t\n\n\tOn the franchise’s staying power in a genre historically dominated by male stars, Mukerji credits its unflinching subject matter. “It’s not just a cop franchise – it’s about confronting truths that we often hesitate to look at. The crimes we address are uncomfortable and cinema has the power to hold up that mirror,” she says. “Most importantly, the ‘Mardaani’ franchise stands for the idea that fear should never win. And as long as that message remains relevant – I think the franchise will continue to find a place in people’s hearts.”\n\n\t“Mardaani 3” is directed by Abhiraj Minawala and produced by Aditya Chopra for India’s Yash Raj Films. \n",

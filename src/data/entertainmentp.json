    "body": "\n\tIan Freebairn-Smith, the Grammy-winning composer who arranged “Evergreen” from “A Star Is Born,” died on Oct. 7 in Folsom, Calif. He was 93.\n\n\tThe composer, vocalist and arranger was widely recognized for his work that shaped many of Hollywood’s most notable film and TV soundtracks. \n\n\tIn the 1970s and 1980s, he composed scores for TV shows such as “Airwolf,” “Fame,” “Cagney & Lacey,” “Magnum, P.I.” and “Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,” collaborating with songwriter Jimmy Webb on a theme song for the latter.\n\t\n\n\tThe Seattle native moved to Los Angeles in 1934 and began his career as a group singer with The Singers Incorporated, working alongside fellow vocalists Perry Botkin, Jr., Sue Allen, Jimmy Bryant and George Tipton.\n\n\n\tIn 1977, he won a Grammy award for best arrangement accompanying a vocalist for “Evergreen,” which was performed by Barbra Streisand.\n\n\tHis credits also include scores for several TV movies like “The Curious Case Of The Campus Corpse” (1977), “Deadly Lessons” (1983) and “Three on a Match.” Freebairn-Smith’s voice can be heard on numerous film and TV soundtracks such as “Batman,” “Flipper “and “Gilligan’s Island” TV series’ theme songs. \n\n\tHe also worked on the bass section on film scores for “Peter Pan” (2003), “The Matrix Revolutions” and “The Day the Earth Stood Still” (2008).\n\n\tThe arranger voiced the main title song for Robert Altman’s film “M*A*S*H” with the Ron Hicklin singers, Johnny Mandel’s “Suicide is Painless,” plus several records for Impulse Records singing group “The California Dreamers.” \n\t\n\n\tHe also provided the singing voice of Ray Walston in the Billy Wilder comedy starring Dean Martin, “Kiss Me Stupid.”\n\n\tFreebairn-Smith also boasted a lengthy radio career, including stints on Los Angeles radio stations KFAC, KKGO, KGIL and KCSN, mostly airing classical music. He was the midday personality at KCSN until 2009.\n\n\tFreebairn-Smith’s works also feature collaborations on dozens of commercial jingles for Chevron, Continental Airlines, United Airlines, Dubonnet Wine, Pacific Bell, among others. His “California Sound” was credited with bringing a huge increase in commercial production to Los Angeles.\n\n\tAdditionally, the composer’s arranging work included charts for Andy Williams, Streisand, Stephen Bishop, Jeff Beck, Lou Rawls, Van Dyke Parks, John Klemmer, Anthony Newley, Randy Crawford, folk artists Emitt Rhodes and Phil Ochs, rock band “The Ventures” and Lee Hazlewood.\n\n\tFreebairn-Smith is survived by his brother Rod, and four daughters, Leslie, Alison, Jenifer and Vanessa, three of whom are musicians, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDirector Nancy Meyers has paid tribute to her longtime friend and frequent collaborator Diane Keaton, the Oscar-winning star who died on Saturday at age 79. Meyers described Keaton as “fearless” and “born to be a movie star.”\n\n\t“These past 48 hours have not been easy. Seeing all of your tributes to Diane has been a comfort. As a movie lover, I’m with you all – we have lost a giant. A brilliant actress who time and again laid herself bare to tell our stories,” Meyers wrote on Instagram. “As a woman, I lost a friend of almost 40 years – at times over those years, she felt like a sister because we shared so many truly memorable experiences. As a filmmaker, I’ve lost a connection with an actress that one can only dream of.”\n\t\n\n\n\tMeyers and Keaton first worked together in 1987 on “Baby Boom” and then again on the 1991 “Father of the Bride” remake and its 1995 sequel. They reunited on the 2003’s box office hit “Something’s Gotta Give,” starring Jack Nicholson and Keanu Reeves. \n\n\n\t“We all search for that someone who really gets us, right? Well, with Diane, I believe we mutually had that. I always felt she really got me so writing for her made me better because I felt so secure in her hands. I knew how vulnerable she could be,” Meyers continued. “And I knew how hilarious she could be, not only with dialogue (which she said word for word as written but managed to always make it sound improvised) but she could be funny sitting at a dinner table or just walking into a room.”\n\n\tShe continued, “When I needed her to cry in scene after scene in ‘Something’s Gotta Give,’ she went at it hard and then somehow made it funny. And I remember she would sometimes spin in a kind of goofy circle before a take to purposely get herself off balance or whatever she needed to shed so she could be in the moment.”\n\t\n\n\tMeyers acknowledged that she wasn’t alone in feeling a cinematic connection to Keaton, whose long and indelible career included Francis Ford Coppola’s “Godfather” films and Woody Allen’s “Annie Hall,” “Play It Again, Sam” and “Manhattan.”\n\n\t“But the truth is – Diane didn’t just ‘get me.’ I’ve watched all of her groundbreaking spectacular work with Woody Allen a million times and I watch her performance in Warren Beatty’s ‘REDS’ with awe. Diane did exactly the same for them because that is what she does. She goes deep. And I know those who have worked with her know what I know… she made everything better.”\n\n\tMeyers ended her tribute by saying that Keaton “changed my life.”\n\n\t“Every set up, every day, in every movie, I watched her give it her all. She was fearless, she was like nobody ever, she was born to be a movie star, her laugh could make your day and for me, knowing her and working with her – changed my life,” she concluded. “Thank you Di. I’ll miss you forever.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tProlific author Nicholas Sparks will debut his latest title, “Remain,” on Tuesday. While the story sticks to “The Notebook” and “A Walk to Remember” author’s bread-and-butter of romance, it explores the new-to-him supernatural genre. That part is thanks to Sparks’ co-author, director M. Night Shyamalan.\n\n\tWhen the project — which included plans for Sparks and Shyamalan to write the novel “Remain” together and then debut a film, now to be led by Jake Gyllenhaal and Phoebe Dynevor, adaptation a year later — was first announced, it left some fans of both creators puzzled. At first blush, the two artists seem completely different until you think of the one thing they both prize, whether in a love or horror story: a solid twist.\n\t\n\n\tAnd though it took until Sparks’ 25th novel for the two to try to bring their respective powers of subversion together, this was not the first chance they had had to work together.\n\n\n\t“A long time ago, way back when ‘The Notebook’ was being adapted for the screen, they approached a writer to write the script — it was M. Night Shyamalan,” Sparks told Variety in an interview last month. “He was busy writing this movie, ‘The Sixth Sense.’ I don’t know if you’ve heard of that movie. I wonder how that eventually did?”\n\n\tJokes about Shyamalan’s most iconic work aside, Sparks added: “The original writer was Jan Sardi, and they decided to go with a new writer after that, that ended up being Jeremy Leven, but they had asked Night Shyamalan to do that. So we had been aware of each other’s career for a long time.”\n\n\tReleasing Tuesday from Penguin Random House, “Remain” centers on New York architect Tate Donovan as he arrives in Cape Cod to design his best friend’s summer home and is hoping to make a fresh start, per the publisher’s description. Recently discharged from an upscale psychiatric facility where he was treated for acute depression, Tate is still wrestling with the pain of losing his beloved sister, Sylvia. Her deathbed revelation — that she can see spirits who are still tethered to the living world, a gift that runs in their family — sits uneasily with Tate, who struggles to believe in more than what reason can explain. But when he takes up residence at a historic bed-and-breakfast on the Cape, he encounters a beautiful young woman named Wren who will challenge every assumption he has about his logical and controlled world.\n\t\n\n\tSparks and Shyamalan began the project by each pitching an idea to each other for something that dabbled in both of their genres. The two decided to use Shyamalan’s idea, and Sparks set out on the manuscript for the novel “Remain” while Shyamalan wrote the screenplay. (Sparks says he’s leaving the door open to potentially move forward with the other concept, which he had pitched: “If this all works, and we’re in between projects we might do mine. It’s a good love story, little scary.”)\n\n\tSparks finished writing the book in January 2024, and Shyamalan wrapped production on the Jake Gyllenhaal and Phoebe Dynevor-led film adaptation this summer, on track for an October 2026 release.\n\n\tAs a project like this is a minefield for spoilers, Sparks has little he can say before “Remain” releases, but teases a few things — one being that “when you read the book, the last page is a little bit of a wink to Night and his past work.”\n\n\tThe other is that when you finished Sparks and Shyamalan’s “Remain” novel, you shouldn’t automatically assume the twist will be the same as the one that’s in Shyamalan’s film version next fall.\n\n\t“Will they? I will tell you that one of the questions I asked Night about is, do you want the ending to be the same? Do you want the twist to be the same?” Sparks said. “And we made a decision about that. You’ve gotta read the book and see the movie.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMiles Heizer is still trying to wrap his head around the fact that he is starring in a Netflix series.\n\n\tAnd it’s not just any series. The 31-year-old out gay actor toplines the eight-episode coming-of-age dramedy “Boots” as Cameron Cope, a high school senior who is grappling with being gay when he unexpectedly enlists in the U.S. Marines with his straight best friend (Liam Oh) to escape his chaotic family life.\n\n\n\tThe show is based on “The Pink Marine,” Greg Cope White’s 2015 memoir about joining the Marines in 1990 when LGBTQ people were barred from serving in the military.\n\t\n\n\t“A guy came up to me the other day at the gym and said, ‘Are you in “Boots”?’ I was in the Coast Guard and I’m gay,’” Heizer tells me over tea on a Friday afternoon at Botanica Restaurant and Market in the Silverlake neighborhood of Los Angeles. “He didn’t have any trouble with it, but it’s cool to hear people tell their stories.”\n\n\tHeizer, whose breakout role in “13 Reasons Why” saw his character Alex Standall come out as queer during the final season, isn’t the only out gay actor in “Boots.” Angus O’Brien plays a very frat boy-acting enlistee and Max Parker portrays a closeted drill sergeant.\n\n\t“It is also wild to have a team of predominantly queer people behind the scenes,” Heizer says. “To have so many queer people and women coming together to make this show, I think is very rare.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHeizer came out publicly when he was 19, but getting there wasn’t always easy. He says he and his sister Moriah were raised by their single mom and grandmother in “a super conservative, religious family.” They lived in Kentucky before moving to Los Angeles when Heizer was 10 years old to support his acting career.\n\t\n\n\t“I had a very unfortunately classic gay coming-out story. It was a nightmare and everyone was upset,” Heizer says. “I’m lucky my sister, who’s my best friend, could not have cared less and was very there for me. My friends around me were super supportive and things have gotten so much better in that regard with my family over the years. But at the time, I definitely had the old Christian upbringing.”\n\n\tThe series takes place just four years before Pres. Bill Clinton’s controversial Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy was enacted in 1994 to allow LGBTQ people to serve, but only as long as they didn’t reveal their sexual orientation. DADT was officially repealed in 2011, allowing LGBTQ individuals to serve openly.\n\n\tHowever, “Boots” comes at a time when Pres. Donald Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second presidency banning trans people from serving. “When the show started filming [in 2023], I don’t think we intended to have this message that’s so relevant to serving today,” Heizer says. “But then of course, as we’re making it, all these things started happening. It’s very interesting that ‘Boots’ shines a light on what’s actually happening now, even though the show is set in 1990. It’s upsetting.”\n\n\tPolitics aside, Heizer admits he was initially anxious about landing his first starring role in “Boots.” But that all changed when he filmed the head-shaving scene. “We were all anticipating it for so long because we shot all the pre-boot camp stuff beforehand when we still had our hair,” Heizer says. “I had fear because I didn’t know what’s under there. I could only imagine I was going to look bad. But once they did it, there was a sense of safety because when you start a TV show, I think we all have that worry that they’re going to recast me, they’re going to see the playback and recast me. So once they shaved our heads, we were all like, ‘Alright, I don’t think we’re going to get fired.’ Then it was the most freeing feeling because I didn’t have to worry about what my hair looked like.”\n\n\tHeizer is hoping for a second season. “There are a lot of stories to tell, from more of Greg’s different experiences in the Marines to Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell to when it was repealed,” he says. “I would do it for 10 seasons if they let us.”\n\t\n\n\t“Boots” Season 1 is available on Netflix.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tLYON, France  — Speaking at the Lumière Film Festival on Monday, Natalie Portman reflected emotionally on the day’s news from her native Jerusalem, calling the end of the war and the release of hostages and prisoners “a momentous day.”\n\n\tAsked by festival director Thierry Fremaux where she is from, Portman replied: “Well, I’m from Jerusalem, I am born in Jerusalem. So today is a very, very emotional day. To see the end of the war today and the release and the swap of the prisoners and the hostages is really a momentous day, and it feels almost crazy to be talking about anything else except celebrating, hopefully, peace.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Oscar-winning actor and filmmaker is in Lyon as one of this year’s guests of honor at the Lumière Film Festival, which is paying tribute to her career with a retrospective of her work, including the screening of “Black Swan” at the 2,000-seat Auditorium.\n\n\n\tOn Monday, Portman also presented “Arco,” an animated feature she produced with Sophie Mas through their MountainA banner, which premiered at Lumière ahead of its French theatrical release this week. “I definitely feel the need to put positivity into the world right now,” she said. “We produced “Arco,” it’s incredibly positive and timely film. And the last two films I produced and acted in are comedies – “The Gallerist,” and Good Sex” that will be out next year – so I’m definitely leaning toward the light right now.”\n\n\tTurning to the industry’s rapid evolution, Portman said she’s fascinated about how technology is reshaping creativity. “I’m obviously interested in all forms of expression, and I’m also curious to see what innovation there is in the face of all the new technology, because I think when there is new technology like what we’re facing now with AI, that’s when people get really creative and forms change – like with photography – so, I am curious what will happens in our industry.”\n\t\n\n\tIntroducing “Black Swan,” Portman said she practiced ballet throughout her childhood, and has “always loved dance as a form of expression that can’t be matched with anything else in terms of human emotion.”\n\n\tDescribing her collaboration with director Daren Aronofsky as “an absolute dream,” Portman – an outspoken advocate for women’s rights – reflected on how growing up in the spotlight as a former child actor has shaped her sense of artistic independence and her understanding of women’s self-expression. “Girls in ballet are infantilized, they’re called ‘girls’ not ‘women,’ they’re asked to keep their bodies like girls not women, and so there was a thing, for me, about being in this position as a child artist trying to please the kind of parental figure that is your director or the company director, and becoming someone looking for that pleasure herself: becoming an artist is about finding pleasure for yourself and not doing anything for anyone else.”\n\n\tA huge queue stretched outside Lyon’s sold-out Auditorium as fans hoped to get a lastminute spot for the talk and the “Black Swan” screening – those who failed to get in will undoubltely head to her masterclass on Tuesday morning.\n\n\tThe Lumiere Film Festival runs in Lyon until October 19.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Swift can’t stop making chart history with “The Life of a Showgirl.” Shortly after it was announced that her album debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 with record numbers, Billboard also revealed that all 12 songs from the collection were lined up at the summit of the Hot 100, at Nos. 1-12 — no skips. That marks the first time any album has had every one of its songs take over the chart’s top spots without interruption in the history of the Hot 100, going back to the 1950s.\n\t\n\n\tSwift had previously become the first and only artist ever to command all 10 spots in the top 10 of the Hot 100. She did it with her previous two releases, “Midnights” and “The Tortured Poets Department.” But in both those instances, once you got beyond the top 10, her playlist was not completely unbroken — there were other artists’ tunes sneaking in before all of the songs from Swift’s album were accounted for.\n\n\n\tHere is how the top 12 of the Hot 100 lines up for Swift’s first week out with her “Life of a Showgirl” songs:\n\n\tNo. 1: “The Fate of Ophelia”No. 2:  “Opalite”No. 3: “Elizabeth Taylor”No. 4: “Father Figure”No. 5: “Wood”No. 6: “Wi$h Li$t”No. 7: “Actually Romantic”No. 8: “The Life of a Showgirl,” feat. Sabrina CarpenterNo. 9: “Eldest Daughter”No. 10: “Cancelled!”No. 11: “Ruin the Friendship”No. 12: “Honey”\n\n\t(We know, we know… justice for “Honey,” right? It’ll come.)\n\n\tNaturally, “The Life of Ophelia” had an easy No. 1 bow this week, as the official first single and music video from the album. Swift will no doubt be pleased to know that her lucky number comes into play here — it’s her 13th Hot 100 chart-topper. It came in with 92.5 million official U.S. streams,per Billboard and Luminate. That’s the highest number of streams for a song in a single week since Billboard changed its Hot 100 data collection process five years ago.\n\t\n\n\tBesides the 92.5 million official streams that “Ophelia” picked up, it also benefitted in the chart calculation from 38.5 million radio airplay audience impressions. Unusually for the Hot 100, there were no individual track download sales contributing to any final totals; Swift has not made the songs from “Showgirl” available for individual sale.\n\n\tNotably, YouTube streams have not counted toward the Hot 100 since 2020, Billboard notes — and that’s where a lot of the action came from for “The Life of Ophelia” in its first week, since the music video went up on YouTube on Sunday night of the album’s first weekend. (The video had been exclusive to her theatrical release, “Taylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl,” for two and a half days prior to that.) If video views had been accounted for, her numbers would have been even higher… but No. 1 is No. 1.\n\n\tAnother one of Swift’s many fresh records: She is now the female artist with the highest number of songs to debut at No. 1, as this is her eighth single to do so. The achievement breaks her out of a tie with Ariana Grande.\n\n\tSwift now is tied with Drake for having the fourth-highest number of No. 1 songs in history, with her 13 chart-toppers. The three artists she will have to set her sights on to set a record for most Hot 100 No. 1s are Rhianna, who is just one ahead of her with 14, Mariah Carey, who has 19, and the Beatles, who stand on top of the list with 20 to have hut the summit.\n\n\tOther high-water marks were being set with “Ophelia.” Co-producer Max Martin earned his 26th No. 1 single, the most for any producer ever, but he was breaking his own record. (Shellback, who also co-produced with Martin and Swift, was getting his 10th No. 1 as a writer and 11th as a producer.)\n\n\tSwift also helped get some glory for Sabrina Carpenter, her duet partner on the album’s title track. “The Life of a Showgirl” became her third No. 1 this year — succeeding two tracks of her own, “Manchild” and “Tears” — and her sixth top 10 track in the Hot 100 overall.\n\n\tIf you’re looking for what followed the unbroken string of a dozen Swift songs at the top, you would be right to assume it’s “Golden,” from “Kpop Demon Hunters,” knocked down to No. 13 from No. 1 by Swift’s fusillade. Alex Warren’s “Ordinary” is right behind it at No. 14, pushed out of the No. 2 slot.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKiefer Sutherland is set to star alongside Al Pacino and Ever Anderson (“Black Widow”) in “Father Joe,” a new action thriller set in 1990s Manhattan, penned and produced by Luc Besson (“Leon: The Professional”).\n\n\t“Father Joe” starts filming in mid-October with Barthélémy Grossmann (“Arthur: Malediction”) directing. \n\n\tThe film is produced by LB Production and EuropaCorp, whose credits include Besson’s hit action thrillers “Taken” with Liam Neeson, “Lucy” with Scarlett Johansson, and “Leon: The Professional.” The latter, which saw Natalie Portman deliver a breakthrough performance starring opposite Jean Reno in 1994, is also set in New York. \n\t\n\n\tSutherland, who also joins the project as producer, stars in “Father Joe” as a man of faith who wages a violent war against the city’s criminal underworld. Pacino plays a powerful mob boss whose empire collides with Father Joe’s crusade. Anderson, the rising star of “Peter Pan & Wendy” and “Black Widow,” plays a young woman caught between danger and redemption under Joe’s guidance.\n\n\n\tSutherland said, “I have been a fan of Luc Besson going back to ‘Subway’. As a director and a writer, he has a unique capacity to weave drama and action together without sacrificing either. I’m so excited about this opportunity to work with him as the writer of ‘Father Joe’ and director Barthélémy Grossmann. I can’t wait to get started.”\n\n\tBesson recently premiered “Dracula: a Love Story,” an ambitious gothic horror romance starring Caleb Landry Jones and Christoph Waltz. The movie, which has sold around the world, has had a strong box office performance in several international markets, including in Latin America and in Russia, where it ranks as the country’s third biggest international hit since 2022 with $9 million grossed since its Sept. 11 release. In Greece, where it opened last week, it debuted in second behind Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another.”\n",

Greenberg, a 27-year-old Philly teacher, was found dead by her fiancé in 2011 ... she'd been stabbed 20 times in the back of her neck and head, with a knife protruding from her chest. Her death was initially ruled a homicide ... but after a meeting with Philly PD, assistant Medical Examiner Dr. Marlon Osbourne determined she died by suicide.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Fast-forward to February 2025 ... under pressure from Greenberg’s family, the medical examiner's office revisited the case ... and is maintaining the same manner of death.\n      \n\n          Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Lindsay Simon re-examined the case and, in a 32-page report released Oct. 10, concluded, \"while the distribution of injuries is admittedly unusual, the fact remains that Ellen would be capable of inflicting these injuries herself.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The Philadelphia Inquirer reports Simon discovered 20 more bruises on Greenberg's body, and three more “perforations in the skin” that hadn't been documented in the original autopsy ... but still ruled her death a suicide.\n      \n    \n          The decision is definitely stirring the pot again ... people are asking the obvious -- how does someone stab themselves over and over in the back and head and call it suicide?\n      \n    \n          TMZ reached out to the Medical Examiner for an explanation on how they think Ellen could’ve done it herself ... so far, no word back.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Greenberg family attorney Joseph Podraza Jr.  tells TMZ ... “MEO Simon’s so-called “independent review” of Ellen Greenberg’s death is a deeply flawed attempt to justify a predetermined conclusion. It includes false claims—like the assertion that a stab wound in Ellen’s spinal column was made during autopsy, a theory rejected by every credible expert, including the City’s own neuropathologist. By ignoring key evidence that contradicts suicide—the extensive 3D photogrammetry, a recreation which proves Ellen could not self-inflict all of the wounds, unexplained bruises, missing surveillance footage, an intact lock, accounts of a toxic relationship, etc.—Simon builds a flimsy case on distorted portrayals of Ellen’s mental health, propped up by cynical distortions of Ellen’s managed anxiety, a condition widely experienced daily by over 40 million Americans. Shame on you Simon.\"\n      \n    \n          Podraza continued ... \"This report is tripe, an embarrassment to the City, and an insult to Ellen and her family. Ellen’s family just wanted the truth. It is clear the truth will not come from Philadelphia’s law enforcement machinery. Though Ellen’s city turned its back on her, we will continue through other avenues to get justice for her murder, by any means necessary.”\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

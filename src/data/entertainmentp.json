    "body": "\n\tGoogle’s YouTube TV is adding two channels from Bloomberg Media to its lineup, one with live 24-hour news and the other with the media company’s original series and documentaries.\n\n\tIt’s the first distribution deal between Bloomberg Media and YouTube TV. The news comes as Google and Disney remain locked in a dispute over the terms of a renewal for YouTube TV, which led Disney last week to begin alerting viewers that the streaming service may drop ESPN, ABC and other networks.\n\t\n\n\tYouTube TV on Oct. 28 is launching Bloomberg TV+, which has live coverage of breaking business and financial news, and Bloomberg Originals, featuring a slate of original series and documentaries. Both are set to go live at about 1 p.m. ET Tuesday. Both channels will be available as part of the YouTube TV base plan. Bloomberg TV+ will be the first 24-hour news channel on YouTube TV delivered in 4K UHD.\n\n\n\tYouTube TV is priced at $82.99 monthly for the baseline package with live and on-demand TV from over 100 channels. It’s the largest internet-delivered pay TV service in the U.S., estimated to have more than 10 million subscribers.\n\n\t“More than 60 million people on average watch Bloomberg programming monthly, and adding YouTube TV’s subscribers to our audience of business leaders is a big step toward continued growth,” Bloomberg Media chief information officer Roman Mackiewicz said. “Viewers are navigating the rapid shifts in markets, geopolitics and technology every day, and this agreement helps us reach them on another innovative platform, to guide their most important work and personal wealth decisions.”\n\t\n\n\tYouTube’s Paul Snow, head of media partnerships, added, “We are proud to welcome Bloomberg to YouTube TV, building on our commitment to bring subscribers essential news, sports and entertainment across our vast lineup of channels. Through this partnership, YouTube TV subscribers now have access to Bloomberg TV’s high-quality business coverage to help them stay up to date and informed.”\n\n\tBloomberg TV+ features daily flagship news shows including including “Surveillance,” “Open Interest,” recently relaunched tech show “Balance of Power,” “The Close,” “Horizons: Middle East and Africa,” “Insight With Haslinda Amin,” “The Pulse With Francine Lacqua,” “The China Show” and “Wall Street Week.” Select news content from Bloomberg Live Events, including the upcoming Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore (Nov. 19-21), will be available on BTV+.\n\n\tSince the launch of its Bloomberg Originals content studio and dedicated stream in January 2023, the brand has developed and hosted 26 original series and feature-length documentaries covering business through the lens of technology, climate, culture and sports. Those include “An Optimist’s Guide to the Planet” with actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (known for “Game of Thrones”), which debuted its second season on Oct. 22. The show follows Coster-Waldau’s globe-trotting travels to meet with people “who are helping drive humanity toward a brighter, more sustainable future,” per the series logline.\n\n\tOther originals include “The Deal With Alex Rodriguez and Jason Kelly” and “The Circuit With Emily Chang,” both in their third seasons; “Can’t Look Away,” based on the investigative reporting of Bloomberg News journalist Olivia Carville; and “The Future with Hannah Fry,” which in June won Bloomberg’s first News and Documentary Emmy in the science and technology category. \n\n\tBloomberg Media operates bureaus and facilities in markets including New York, London, Dubai, Tokyo and Johannesburg. It recently opened new studios in Seoul and Mumbai, with another opening in Doha soon. \n\n\tPictured above: Bloomberg’s “An Optimist’s Guide to the Planet” with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau\n",

    "body": "\n\tAdobe and YouTube are teaming up in a first-of-its-kind partnership aimed at getting more YouTubers to use the recently launched Adobe Premiere mobile app for iPhone — to ideally produce a ton more YouTube Shorts videos.\n\n\tUnder a new partnership between Adobe and YouTube, the free Adobe Premiere mobile app (launched last month for iOS) will soon add Create for YouTube Shorts. The new content-creation space will provide access to Adobe’s video-editing tools including exclusive effects, transitions, title presets and more tailored to YouTube Shorts.\n\t\n\n\tThe Adobe Premiere app’s Creator for YouTube Shorts section will include a library ready-to-use templates (e.g., for day-in-the-life vlogs, travel videos and get-ready-with-me videos), and users also will be able to create their own templates and share them. Once they’re done creating a video, users can upload them to YouTube Shorts with a single tap. \n\n\n\tIn addition, YouTube creators will be able to access Premiere mobile’s pro-level editing tools. The app provides AI-generated sound effects and Firefly-powered generative AI features, but those are available only with paid subscriptions. The Create for YouTube content creation space in Adobe Premiere mobile will be available directly from YouTube’s app by tapping on an “Edit in Adobe Premiere” icon that will appear in YouTube Shorts.\n\n\t“With Premiere mobile, we want to let anybody be creator, with just a phone in their hand, and empower them to make amazing content,” said Mike Polner, Adobe’s VP of product marketing for creators. It was an obvious decision to partner with YouTube, he said: “Our two interests have really aligned about how we serve creators.”\n\t\n\n\tYouTube’s own app includes an array of features for shooting and editing Shorts videos. Sarah Ali, VP of product management at YouTube, sees the partnership to integrate with Adobe Premiere mobile as “meeting creators where they are.” \n\n\t“We know creators are already using Adobe for Shorts,” Ali said. The partnership is aimed at helping them to “unlock more stories.”\n\n\tThe new partnership will be featured in Tuesday’s kickoff to the 2025 Adobe MAX Creative Conference in L.A.\n\n\tYouTube Shorts videos, which can be up to 3 minutes in length, have exploded in popularity since the TikTok-like format was introduced in 2020. YouTube Shorts has over 2 billion monthly users and more than 200 billion views daily, according to YouTube.\n\n\tYouTube creator Cleo Abram (6.85 million subscribers), who produces “optimistic tech explainers,” told Variety that Premiere mobile has made it “easier and faster to bring our stories to life, even while we’re in the field.” \n\n\t“Now, what I’m most excited to see from YouTube and Adobe’s new partnership is how even more creators will have access to the kind of pro-level editing and creative control that used to be locked behind expensive tools and distribution,” Abram said. “Not anymore. Adobe and YouTube are throwing open the door for a whole new wave of voices, perspectives and ideas to shine.”\n\n\tMai Pham, a beauty and lifestyle creator (with 3.5 million YouTube subscribers), said having Premiere mobile has been a “game-changer” in creating content especially at concerts, festivals and other events. “What excites me most about Adobe Premiere mobile is what it means for new aspiring creators who might feel intimidated by desktop editing,” Pham said. “Having Adobe’s tools accessible on mobile makes it so much easier to get started learning, and when you’re ready to level up, transitioning to the computer becomes so much less scary.”\n\n\tWatch a sizzle reel of Adobe’s Premiere app for iPhone new features for YouTube:\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Good Morning America” co-anchor Robin Roberts interviews former first lady Michelle Obama in a new ABC News Studios special, “Michelle Obama: The Style, The Power, The Look – A Conversation with Robin Roberts – Special Edition of 20/20,” set to air this Sunday, Nov. 2 on ABC.\n\n\tThe special, which air at 8 p.m. ET on Sunday and will stream the next day on Hulu, is timed to Obama’s upcoming book “The Look.” Roberts’ interview, which was filmed at Marymount University in Virginia, focuses on Obama’s style and other fashion-oriented topics. \n\t\n\n\t“The Look,” which is set to be released by Crown on Nov. 4, was written by Obama with help from Meredith Koop, who worked as Obama’s stylist and creative consultant both during the President Barack Obama administration and after. “The Look” centers on the former first lady’s style from when she first entered the public eye.\n\n\n\tPer the description for the ABC News Studios special, “Obama shares the important role and at times complex role fashion has played in her life, from designing her own prom dress at a young age to navigating living in the spotlight as the first Black first lady of the United States and helping define who she is today. A passionate supporter of future generations and education, Obama surprises past and present students who are working to make their own marks on fashion.”\n\n\tOther interviews in the special include Koop, as well as Obama’s makeup artist Carl Ray and hairstylists Yene Damtew and Njeri Radway. Also in the special are designers Diane von Furstenberg, Jason Wu, Tracy Reese and Narciso Rodriquez, as well as several fashion commentators.\n\t\n\n\tABC News Studios and 20/20 are behind “Michelle Obama: The Style, The Power, The Look – A Conversation with Robin Roberts – Special Edition of 20/20”; Janice Johnston and Karen Leo are executive producers while David Sloan is senior executive producer.\n\n\tHere’s the key art for Sunday’s special:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tOthelia Technologies has launched its AI-native storytelling platform, Othelia, which is meant to help writers, creators, and producers “structure and manage complex narrative worlds — from first draft to multi-title franchise.”\n\n\tOthelia is described as a non-generative AI platform that instead “amplifies human storytelling capabilities while preserving the integrity, ownership, and authentic voice that make stories powerful.” The company notes that “all creative data housed on Othelia is fully owned and controlled by the user, with no data ever repurposed to train generative models,” but available to the user as “structured, searchable data.” \n\t\n\n\tBased in Australia and founded by co-CEO Kate Armstrong-Smith and chief technology officer Joe Couch, Othelia Technologies opened its Los Angeles headquarters over the summer. Ahead of Othelia’s launch, former Bento Box Entertainment CEO Scott Greenberg was named the company’s executive chairman and co-founder, and Alexandra Hooven was set as co-founder and co-CEO.\n\n\n\tAccording to Othelia Technologies, the new platform is meant to address the “bottleneck” of rewrites in the production process by “making a story’s underlying logic visible and accessible.” \n\n\tPer Othelia, “The platform centralizes canon, structure, relationships, and change impact in a single source of truth—alleviating roadblocks like compromised structure, plot inconsistencies, and contradictory storylines—so notes are precisely scoped, rework drops, and the writing stays human. Teams can search by creative intent—finding specific emotions, actions, or story beats—and instantly access time-coded results across all materials.”\n\t\n\n\tOthelia launched Tuesday and users can now apply for access to the platform’s beta program.\n\n\t“This is what I wish I could have had at Bento Box” Greenberg said. “Every department builds off the story. When continuity breaks or a note lands late, that downstream ripple hits schedules, budgets and ultimately creative quality. Othelia keeps the canon visible and interactive, so teams can model changes before work starts and keep production moving.”\n\n\tSee below for Variety‘s Q&A with Othelia leadership on the launch.\n\t\n\t\tAre there concerns about launching now amid the current scrutiny AI is facing from Hollywood and the overall entertainment industry? And how are you going about quelling those fears with current and potential customers and partners?\t\n\n\tAlexandra Hooven, Othelia co-founder and co-chief executive officer: We’re launching now because of this moment, not in spite of it. The scrutiny is warranted – Hollywood is watching tech companies try to replace creative judgment with pattern recognition, treating the art of storytelling as a prediction problem. That approach fundamentally misunderstands what creators do, and the consequences are real: as AI automates more of the creative process, we’re ceding control of culture and narrative itself. The question of who shapes the stories that define us is becoming a question of who controls the tools.\n\n\tOthelia is built on the opposite principle – keeping humans in control of narrative. We’re not generating content or making creative decisions. We’re infrastructure that treats stories as structured, relational data instead of static documents. When a major studio is managing a major franchise IP across decades of canon, or when a showrunner is tracking character arcs across a series, they need to see the relationships, the dependencies, the narrative architecture. That’s not an AI problem – it’s a data structure problem that the industry has been solving with disparate word docs, spreadsheets and bibles that don’t connect to one another. \n\n\tThat’s also why we’re not training on anyone’s data. Othelia is a walled garden – your stories, your IP, your data stays in your hands and is owned by you. We’re not building a model that learns from your work.\n\n\tOur customers aren’t concerned because they understand immediately what we’re building. We’re not in the business of creative replacement – we’re building tools that preserve creative control at the exact moment the industry needs it most. The best creators already think this way. We’re just giving them the infrastructure to work at scale without surrendering ownership or agency.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat do you see as the ideal project and example of what Othelia can really do and how best it can benefit creators?\t\n\n\tKate Armstrong-Smith, co-CEO: For someone with an idea who doesn’t know where to begin, Othelia will help you build out the scaffolding of your story before you even move to script – the relationships between characters, the flow of information, the architecture of your story. For a professional with a first pass draft, it’s about making the implicit structure explicit so you can iterate and build faster. For a writers room developing a series, it’s ensuring everyone is working from the same structural foundation – no more version control chaos or misaligned character arcs across episodes. And for studios managing complex IP assets – decades of canon, cinematic universes – it’s the same structural thinking at a scale where traditional tools break down completely.\n\n\tWhat they all have in common is that the core story logic lives in traditional documents, in one individual’s head, or scribbled across whiteboards. Change one element and you’re manually hunting for every downstream ripple effect. With Othelia, those relationships become a queryable structure. You can ask: ‘If I move this revelation, what breaks?’ You can instantly see the scenes or characters where a change in motivation matters, or how information flows across timelines. \n\n\tThat visibility matters even more in production. A late story change cascades across costume, set design, shooting schedules, VFX. When structure is visible from the start, you catch those dependencies before they become budget bloat.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrunella Scales, the actress best known for playing Sybil Fawlty, the intimidating hotel manager wife of John Cleese‘s Basil on the iconic ’70s British sitcom “Fawlty Towers,” died on Monday. She was 93.\n\n\tHer sons, Samuel and Joseph West, confirmed her death to news agency PA Media on Tuesday, saying Scales died “peacefully at home in London yesterday.” She was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2013.\n\n\n\t“Although dementia forced her retirement from a remarkable acting career of nearly 70 years, she continued to live at home. She was watching ‘Fawlty Towers’ the day before she died,” the statement continued. “We would like to thank all those who gave Pru such wonderful care at the end of her life: her last days were comfortable, contented and surrounded by love.”\n\t\n\n\tBeyond her performance in “Fawlty Towers,” which ran on BBC Two from 1975 to 1979, Scales earned a BAFTA nomination for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in Alan Bennett’s 1991 televised play “A Question of Attribution.” From 2014 to 2020, she co-hosted the docuseries “Great Canal Journeys” alongside her husband, the late actor Timothy West, in which they explored Britain’s waterways.\n\n\tScales began her career in 1951 as an assistant stage manager at the Bristol Old Vic and began acting in plays and small films in the ’50s and early ’60s. She earned her first big break starring in the sitcom “Marriage Lines” alongside Richard Briers from 1963 to 1966, and then rose to prominence when she was cast as Sybil Fawlty in “Fawlty Towers” in the mid ’70s. Her other credits include the series “Mapp & Lucia” from 1985-1986, and films including “The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne” (1987), “Howards End” (1992), “Wolf” (1994) and “An Awfully Big Adventure” (1995).\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to her sons, Scales is survived by one stepdaughter, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. She was predeceased by West, her husband of 61 years, who died in November 2024.\n",

But its main goal is to bring viewers into the CNN fold who are interested in the latest news on trending topics, and not necessarily on time slots or talent.\n\t\n\n\t“All Access” offers collections of recent video that might help subscribers get caught up on anything from the recent sports-betting scandal that has involved an NBA player and coach, or the government shutdown. It will feature special live streams dedicated to giving viewers an immediate look at events unfolding in the moment. And its subscribers will also be able to watch CNN’s library of films and documentary programming. Traditional pay-TV subscribers will be able to use the product as well, a nod to the needs for CNN and parent Warner Bros. Discovery to maintain relationships with cable and satellite providers even as more consumers migrate to streaming video.\n\n\n\t“We’re delivering all of CNN’s industry-leading journalism in one place, accessible on any device,” said Alex McCallum, CNN’s executive vice president of digital products and services. “Whether you are a fan of the live and premium video storytelling on which CNN built its name, or prefer snackable content that catches you up on the day’s essential news and lifestyle stories, audiences can now engage with and consume the full breadth of world-class storytelling CNN and its trusted journalists are known for, however works best for them.”\n\t\n\n\tCNN needs to court viewers who no longer view cable as an integral part of delivering their media diet. CNN is projected to shed 7.6% of its pay-TV subscriber base by the end of 2026, according to estimates from Kagan, a market-research unit of S&P Global Intelligence. CNN was estimated to have 67.1 million viewers in 2024, according to Kagan, but it seen having just 62 million by the end of next year.\n\n\tCNN seeks $6.99 per month or $69.99 a year, for the new content tier — its second attempt to build a subscription-based streaming outlet.\n\n\tUnlike the previous effort, CNN+, which launched and was killed over a few weeks in 2022, the new “All Access” relies more heavily on the video and reporting CNN produces every day, rather than introducing a battery of new programs led by anchors and colorful contributors. CNN reporters, producers and correspondents are at work around the world, but may not be able to get more than a few minutes of time for their labors on traditional TV. “All Access” won’t focus only on the politics-and-breaking-news-focused report of the linear network, and will rely largely on video already in production to generate additional revenue.\n\n\tBut CNN is launching the product yet again during a time of great uncertainty for its corporate parent. In 2022, CNN+ debuted just as the former Discovery Communications was working to acquire the former Warner Media from its proprietor, AT&T. The new CNN streaming debut comes as Warner Bros. Discovery,   which had been pursuing a split of its traditional TV assets and its streaming and studio operations, has essentially said it will consider offers to buy the company or various pieces of its portfolio.\n\n\tSubscribers will have access to several channels beyond CNN’s linear U.S. feed. CNN’s international feed is also available, along with two FAST channels — one devoted to breaking news headlines, much like the old linear cable outlet CNN Headline News, and one tied to CNN’s original documentary series and programs.\n\n\tCNN will add some new programming from current staffers. Anderson Cooper will host “All There Is Live,” a streaming extension of his podcast focused on grief. Cooper will speak with guests about experiences with grief and loss, and respond to live interactive chat. The show will stream on its own, with episodes available the next day via All Access. Donie O’Sullivan will join people on spiritual journeys as they seek out new sources of meaning in “Devoted.” And Harry Enten offers a statistical look at stories in the news with “The Enten Factor.” One program that started with CNN+, “5 Things With Kate Bolduan,” a quick-hit look at top stories in the news cycle, will be offered on All Access.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney’s “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” debuted at No. 1 in the U.K. and Ireland with £1.3 million ($1.75 million), according to Comscore. \n\n\tThe Bruce Springsteen portrait launched narrowly ahead of Paramount’s “Regretting You,” which opened at No. 2 with $1.71 million, while Sony Pictures’ anime feature “Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc” sliced into No. 3 at $1.4 million.\n\n\n\tUniversal held two slots in the middle of the chart: family title “Gabby’s Dollhouse: The Movie” eased to No. 4 with $1.1 million for a running total of $4.3 million, and horror sequel “The Black Phone 2” placed No. 5 with $842,806, reaching $3.1 million to date.\n\t\n\n\tFurther down, Studiocanal’s “I Swear” ranked No. 6 with $792,645, while Warner Bros.’ “One Battle After Another” was No. 7 on $644,540, pushing its cume to $14.2 million. Altitude Film Distribution’s “Pets On A Train” bowed at No. 8 with $593,370. \n\n\tDisney’s “Tron: Ares” held No. 9 on $512,674 for $5.5 million cumulative, and Paramount’s “Roofman” rounded out the Top 10 with $410,052, reaching $1.8 million. \n\n\tWith Halloween-adjacent programming and a mix of music events, revivals and wide commercial releases, the upcoming U.K. and Ireland slate for the week offers an eclectic mix for audiences.\n\n\tThe week opens on Tuesday, Oct. 28 with Trafalgar Releasing’s concert title “Depeche Mode: M,” a one-night-only release. Wednesday brings a blend of sport and suspense: Altitude unveils “Kenny Dalglish,” Asif Kapadia’s profile of the soccer icon, while also launching “Shelby Oaks,” Chris Stuckmann’s horror thriller about a decades-old disappearance. \n\t\n\n\tThursday offers a different flavor with “Bat Out of Hell – The Musical,” a screen capture of the rock-driven stage production, via CinemaLive.\n\n\tFriday, Oct. 31 delivers the biggest arrivals. Universal leads with Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia,” opening across 300+ screens. The studio also rolls out a 40th anniversary reissue of “Back to the Future.” Art-house audiences are served with Radu Jude’s “Kontinental ’25,” releasing via Sovereign on 25+ screens. David Mackenzie’s “Relay,” starring Riz Ahmed, Lily James and Sam Worthington, also lands on 300+ sites.\n\n\tThere is further diversity across the frame, with Punjabi-language film “Ikk Kudi” (Moviegoers Entertainment), another Punjabi title “Madhaniyan” and the composite version of the blockbuster franchise “Baahubali: The Epic” (both from Bakrania Media), Curzon brings the acclaimed “Palestine 36,” while Netflix’s “KPop Demon Hunters (A Sing-Along Event),” which opens on 100+ screens and continues the smash hit phenomenon. \n",

    "body": "\n\tFrench-U.K. genre-bending Alief sales outfit has sealed multiple deals covering nearly 20 territories on Romas Zabarauskas’ gay neo-noir “The Activist,” ahead of the pic’s international premiere at Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival (PÖFF)’s Baltic competition.\n\n\tTLA Releasing has snapped rights for the U.S. and Canada, with the Baltics going to WBD International Content LLC for HBO Max, and French-speaking rights to Optimale.\n\t\n\n\tElsewhere the leading LGBTQ+ specialised channel and platform OUtv, owner of the brands Cinemien, Pro-Fun and Tongarino Releasing, acquired rights for the U.K., Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, Finland, Greenland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Israel, Central and Eastern Europe, German-speaking countries and Latin America.\n\n\n\tThe deals were brokered by Alief’s president Brett Walker and partner Miguel Govea on behalf of Zabarauskas who also produces with Glenn Elliott and Gabrielè Misevičiūtė.\n\n\n\n\n\t“We are thrilled to be releasing “The Activist” in North America,” commented Adam Silver of TLA Releasing, distributor of “Zabarauskas’ earlier pics “You Can’t Escape” and “The Lawyer.” “It’s wonderful to be working with Romas again on such an accomplished and important project, and we can’t wait for our audiences to experience this major work in 2026.”\n\n\tTogether with “The Lawyer” and “The Writer” (2023), “The Activist” is part of a trilogy dealing with queer relationships against a political backdrop. Here, the story turns on Andrius a young man who infiltrates a radical neo-Nazi group to find the killer of his LGBT+ activist boyfriend. Headlining the cast are Robertas Petraitis (from “The Southern Chronicles,” Lithuania’s Oscar bet for 2026), Vaslov Goom (“Master of the Air,” “Cry Wolf”) and Teklè Baroti.\n\t\n\n\tMiguel Govea, partner at Alief said: “Romas’ “The Activist” reflects the changing world we are living in, one filled with hope, and our right to push back.”\n\n\t“I’m humbled by our first sales, proving a real appetite for cinema that dares to be politically provocative,” said Zabarauskas. “The Activist” is a drama-driven detective with a touch of reverse “Cruising,” both in its infiltration plot and its intention to sting. The whole point is to let our queer characters shine as true stars, from heroes to noir-coded villains.”\n\n\tHe added: “My career has always been challenging – in Lithuania, where some people reportedly leave the cinemas after our second sex scene, and in Western arthouse circles, whose expectations I don’t necessarily meet either. Yet my stubbornness to do whatever I want opened other doors, and I’m humbled to have gained both public and private backing for it. With my fifth feature, I only hope that some in the audience do get offended, across the political spectrum!” he said defiantly.\n\n\tThe pic opened at No. 2 at the Lithuanian box office Sept. 2. The international premiere is at Tallinn Nov. 14. It will be followed by a special screening event, out of competition, at Paris’ LGBTQ+ festival Chéries-Chéries Nov. 16. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Playmaker has taken international sales rights to Nikias Chryssos’ English-language debut, the supernatural body-horror pic “Bloody Tennis.” The Playmaker will launch international sales on the film at the American Film Market in Los Angeles.\n\n\tThe film, which is produced by Augenschein, was written by Chryssos. The Greek-German filmmaker broke out with his 2015 feature “Der Bunker,” which debuted at Berlinale and won the Next Wave Award for best feature at Fantastic Fest in Austin. His second feature film “A Pure Place” was developed in the Résidence du Festival de Cannes and premiered at the Munich Film Festival, where it won the award for best director.\n\t\n\n\t“Bloody Tennis” stars Sandra Guldberg Kampp (“Foundation”), Golden Globe nominee Helena Zengel (“News of the World,” “The Legend of Ochi”), Lucie Zhang (“Paris, 13th District”), Lily Taieb (“The French Dispatch,” “Bergman Island”), Tracy Gotoas, Elina Löwensohn (“Schindler’s List”), and Zlatko Burić (“Triangle of Sadness”), with an original score from Jim Williams (“Titane,” “Raw,” “Possessor”).\n\n\n\tThe horror film takes the world of elite sports to disturbing new extremes, filled with brutal ambition, blood-sucking leeches, and hard-hitting serves. After being admitted to an elite tennis academy hidden deep in the south of Europe, Sophie (Guldberg Kampp) must contend not only with the fierce brutality of her teammates but with the school’s increasingly sinister undercurrents, where competitive sports are taken to their extreme and only the hungriest survive.\n\t\n\n\tThe film is a German production, produced by Jonas Katzenstein and Maximilian Leo (“The Assessment,” “Mother Mary”) of Augenschein in co-production with Port au Prince Film & Kultur Produktion, which also acts as the German distributor, and ZDF. It is supported by Film-und Medienstiftung and German Federal Film Fund (DFFF).\n\n\tMoritz Hemminger, head of sales and acquisitions at The Playmaker, said, “We are delighted to be working with the prestigious Augenschein team. In ‘Bloody Tennis,’ Nikias Chryssos once again demonstrates his original style as a director, which is why our international distributors can look forward to a wild, bloody, and highly entertaining horror film.”\n\n\tJonas Katzenstein, producer at Augenschein, added, “Nikias Chryssos’ films are unmistakable in their visual style—intoxicating, absurd, and darkly comic. He consistently confronts audiences with bold, disturbing visions that challenge and reward in equal measure. We are thrilled to continue working with such a singular talent, and to partner with The Playmaker and the extraordinary filmmaking team who brought this wild ride to life.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Marrakech Film Festival has revealed the 28 projects and films selected for the 8th edition of the Atlas Workshops, whose patron this year is Romanian director Cristian Mungiu. The event runs from Nov. 30 to Dec. 4.\n\n\tMungiu, who won the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 2007 for “4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,” said: “I am very happy to get back to Marrakech, a vibrant festival that uses the power of cinema to promote and unite people from different corners of the world. I gladly accept the position of patron of the Atlas Workshops for 2025, hoping that from this encounter, both the filmmakers I am going to meet and I myself will have a lot to learn. I believe cinema is a great tool for investigating reality and getting to know the other despite all stereotypes, and that we should use it as a tool to help us focus on what unites us rather than on differences of opinions we might have.”\n\t\n\n\tThis year’s Atlas Workshops includes:● Twelve projects in development (10 fiction and two documentaries, including five first features) from nine countries: Angola, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Mozambique, Palestine and Tanzania;● Ten films in production or post-production (nine fiction and one documentary, including five debut features) from seven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine and Yemen;● Five projects from Morocco in the Atlas Close-Ups (five fiction films in development, all of which are first features);● One Moroccan film nearing completion and seeking a festival premiere in the Atlas Film Showcase section.\n\t\n\n\tThis year’s edition of the Atlas Workshops features the most recent film by Palestinian directors Scandar Copti (who won the Étoile d’Or at Marrakech last year for “Happy Holidays”) and Maha Haj (“Personal Affairs,” “Mediterranean Fever”), as well as an adaptation of Augustin Sondé Coulibaly’s 1982 novel “Les Dieux délinquants” by Burkinabe director Boubacar Sangaré (“A Golden Life,” a participant in the 2022 Atlas Workshops). Jordanian director Amjad Al Rasheed (“Inshallah a Boy,” which participated in the 2022 Atlas Workshops and was selected for Critics’ Week at Cannes in 2023) also presents his new project.\n\n\tThe Atlas Workshops also includes new work by Tanzania’s Amil Shivji (“Tug of War,” which was presented at the Toronto Film Festival in 2021); Egyptians Jad Chahine (“The Call of the Brook,” which was selected for La Cinef at Cannes in 2023) and Mohammed Hammad (“Withered Green,” which screened at the Locarno Film Festival in 2016); and Ghana’s Amartei Armar (“Tsutsue,” a short film competition selection at Cannes in 2022). From Lebanon, participants include Vatche Boulghourjian (“Tramontane,” which screened in Critics’ Week at Cannes in 2016); Rami Kodeih, whose work has been presented at the Directors’ Fortnight in Cannes and at the BFI London Film Festival; Mounia Akl, who returns to Marrakech with her second feature film after “Costa Brava, Lebanon,” which was presented at the Venice Film Festival in 2021; and editor Michèle Tyan, who makes her fiction film debut in Marrakech.\n\n\tThe selection brings together Moroccan filmmakers Basma Rkioui (an Atlas Station participant in 2024), Zineb Wakrim, whose “Ayyur” was selected for La Cinef at Cannes in 2023, Laïla Marrakchi (“Marock,” “Rock the Casbah”), and Asmae El Moudir, who won the Étoile d’Or at Marrakech in 2023 for “The Mother of All Lies.” Director Mohamed Zineddaine unveils exclusive first footage from his new fiction film in the Atlas Film Showcase. In addition, the Atlas Close-Ups section features five feature-length projects in development, led by Moroccan filmmakers Halima Elkhatabi, Reda Lahmouid, Zahoua Raji and Ayoub Layoussifi, Shaden Safieddine Tazi and Leyna Tahiri.\n\n\tProjects and films selected for the 2025 Atlas WorkshopsProjects in development“Akal,” Basma Rkioui (Morocco), first feature documentary“Chapa 100,” Ique Langa (Mozambique), second fiction feature“Chentian,” Suha Arraf (Palestine), second fiction feature“A Childhood,” Scandar Copti (Palestine), third feature documentary“Les Dieux Délinquants,” Boubacar Sangaré (Burkina Faso), first fiction feature“Hold Me (If You Want),” Mounia Akl (Lebanon), second fiction feature“Last Cow,” Amil Shivji (Tanzania), second fiction feature“The Marches,” Vatche Boulghourjian (Lebanon), second fiction feature“Siméon Idriss,” Zineb Wakrim (Morocco), first fiction feature“Under Green Skies,” Jad Chahine (Egypt), first fiction feature“Under Her Eye,” Amjad Al Rasheed (Jordan), second fiction feature“Vanda,” Kamy Lara (Angola), first fiction feature\n\t\n\n\tFilms shooting or in post-production“Don’t Let the Sun Go Up on Me,” Asmae El Moudir (Morocco), second feature documentary“Goma Enough Is Enough” (Goma Trop C’est Trop), Elisé Sawasawa (Democratic Republic of the Congo), first feature documentary“Grey Glow” (Lueur Grise), Michèle Tyan (Lebanon), first fiction feature“La Más Dulce,” Laïla Marrakchi (Morocco), third fiction feature“Orient Adagio” (Qitar Al-Sharq Al-Bati’), Maha Haj (Palestine), third fiction feature“Safe Exit,” Mohammed Hammad (Egypt), second fiction feature“The Station,” Sara Ishaq (Yemen), first fiction feature“Trip to Jerusalem,” Michel Zarazir and Gaby Zarazir (Lebanon), first fiction feature“Vagabonds,” Amartei Armar (Ghana), first fiction feature“Wolves,” Rami Kodeih (Lebanon), first fiction feature\n\n\tAtlas Close-Ups“Earth and Ashes” (Terre Et Cendres), Leyna Tahiri (Morocco), first fiction feature“Into the Blue Night” (Vers La Nuit Bleue), Halima Elkhatabi (Morocco), first fiction feature“Remontada,” Reda Lahmouid (Morocco), first fiction feature“The Tanjawi” (Le Tangérois), Zahoua Raji & Ayoub Layoussifi (Morocco), first fiction feature“Today, I Am 25 Years Old,” Shaden Safieddine Tazi (Morocco), first fiction feature\n\n\tAtlas Film Showcase“Until Dawn” (Jusqu’à L’aube), Mohamed Zineddaine (Morocco), fiction feature\n\n\tParticipants and short films in post-production selected for the 2025 Atlas StationAtlas Station – selected Moroccan professionalsLamia BengellounKenza Berrada AmorInes LehaireLinda QibaaZainab RabbaaFadila TahaOumayma Zekri Ajarrai\n\n\tAtlas Station – short films in post-production“Barzakh” (Barzakh: Le Monde Intermédiaire), Kenza Tazi (Morocco), second short fiction film“The Bride of the Rain” (Taslit N’ounzar), Driss Ouaamar (Morocco), first short animated film in production“Deserted Streets” (Rues Désertes), Batoul Benazzou (Morocco), first short fiction film“Mesk Ellil,” Adnane Rami (Morocco), third short fiction film\n",

    "body": "\n\tA teaser has been unveiled for “A Teacher’s Gift,” a British South Asian film backed by India’s National Film Development Corporation (NFDC). \n\n\tProduced by Eric Ollerenshaw, directed by Artur Ribeiro (“Terra Nova”), and co-written by and starring Rajdeep Choudhury (“IRaH”) alongside Anjali Patil (“Soch”) and Anthony Calf (“One Day”), “A Teacher’s Gift” follows Rohan, an ambitious Hindi language teacher navigating cultural expectations and personal desires. Set between London and India, the story explores his bond with a sophisticated Englishman – rooted in a shared love for literature and cricket – that transcends barriers of age, culture, and convention, leading to a journey of rediscovery and reconciliation.\n\t\n\n\tThe ensemble cast also includes Paula Lobo Antunes, Dhruv Sehgal, Virgilio Castelo, and Varun Buddhadev.\n\n\n\tThe film had its European premiere at the Tribeca Festival Lisboa 2025, with Rui Tendinha, Tribeca programmer in Lisbon, describing the film as “a beautiful fusion of cultures and a heart touching emotional story.”\n\n\tThe film played in Lisbon on the heels of earning a best feature film nomination at the BAFTA and BIFA-qualifying Iris Prize Film Festival in Wales. \n\n\t“For an independent British film that started its journey in the U.K. with a predominantly South Asian crew, then received support from NFDC WAVES Film Bazaar, and now selected and shown at Tribeca, has been an incredible journey,” said Ollerenshaw, a former Member of the U.K. Parliament.\n\n\tThe premiere was attended by Francisco Pedro Balsemão, CEO of Impressa, Portugal’s largest media company and one of the key figures behind bringing the Tribeca Film Festival to Lisbon. Balsemão appreciated the inclusion of “A Teacher’s Gift” in the program, noting it demonstrates Tribeca and Tribeca Lisboa’s commitment to promoting stories and artists from around the world.\n\t\n\n\tThe Tribeca Festival Lisboa 2025, co-founded by Robert De Niro, brought the iconic New York festival experience to Europe. This year’s edition featured appearances by Kim Cattrall, Giancarlo Esposito, and Meg Ryan, along with the Portuguese premiere of “Honeyjoon,” winner of the 2024 Tribeca Festival AT&T Untold Stories Award.\n\n\tWatch the teaser here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMediawan Kids & Family is diving into the microdrama space with plans to launch its first vertical animation short-form content next year, president Julien Borde revealed at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest.\n\n\tSpeaking on a panel focused on cross-media IP adaptation, Borde said the animation industry is “really ready” for the burgeoning short-form trend that has dominated Asian markets. “The writers know very well how to tell a story in very, very short form,” he told the audience at the event.\n\t\n\n\tThe move signals a significant strategic move for the Paris-headquartered production and distribution company, which operates more than 80 production companies globally including Method Animation, the studio behind “The Little Prince” franchise. While Borde acknowledged that “Asia and Europe and Western countries in general are less advanced than Asia” in both live-action and animated micro-content, he expressed enthusiasm about the format’s potential.\n\n\n\tThe microdrama discussion highlighted ongoing challenges around monetization and subsidies. Laurent Duvault, vice president of business development and audiovisual rights at Media Participations-Mediatoon, noted that European subsidy systems have yet to catch up with the format. “People keep thinking it’s recycling content when it’s actually brand new content,” Duvault said, adding that finding “a healthy business model and healthy subsidies model” remains a key challenge.\n\n\tBorde suggested that micro-payment systems — already prevalent in Asia — could offer a solution when combined with subscription models. “Some platforms in Europe are testing micro payment,” he said, noting that his company is monitoring how this approach develops.\n\t\n\n\tBoth French executives emphasized their commitment to Asian partnerships, with Mediawan particularly focused on Taiwan. Chief operating officer Jean-Yves Patay has visited Taiwan multiple times, and the company currently has three co-productions with Taiwanese studios — one TV series and two features.\n\n\t“We are here for the long run and for building very strong partnership between Taiwan and France,” Borde said, marking his first visit to the territory.\n\n\tDuvault, representing France’s third-largest publishing group with more than 40 publishers producing 3,500 new books annually, said his team currently has nearly 200 projects in development globally. “One out of 10 should be on screen at the end,” he noted, with 20% of projects based outside France, including in America, Germany, England, Mexico and China.\n\n\tHe revealed a Taiwan-specific win: “Bob & Marley,” an animation project featuring a Taiwanese bear character that he’s now developing with local producers. “When I found out it was [Taiwanese], it became my priority to find a producer here, and magic happens,” Duvault said.\n\n\tThe panel delved into strategies for identifying which literary and comic IPs warrant adaptation. Media Participations leans on what Duvault calls “evergreen” characters — properties that have endured for 30, 40 or 50 years, citing examples like “The Little Prince” and “Astro Boy.”\n\n\tThe company is currently relaunching “The Marsupilamis” for Nickelodeon, a project nearly a decade in the making. “It’s the perfect example to turn a 70-year-old character into something fresh and new,” Duvault said.\n\n\tHowever, he cautioned that evergreens carry risks. “Anytime you come with a new iteration, people may dislike it because it is not the memory they have,” he explained, noting that some recent evergreen adaptations have disappointed when they failed to meet audience expectations formed during childhood.\n\n\tMediawan’s Method Animation has built its reputation on reinventing classic IP, having produced three different iterations of “The Little Prince” — one feature and two series. But Borde said the company is increasingly focused on properties with existing fan engagement. “It’s very hard to establish a new brand in such a fragmented consumption world,” he explained. “More and more we have to come to our partners with something already existing and very strong with billions of views.”\n\t\n\n\tRecent examples include “Ki and Hi,” an anime-adjacent series based on a French manga by YouTuber Kevin Tran that outsells Japanese manga in France, and “Mr. Crocodile,” based on the creation by author Joann Sfar. The series launched on France Televisions and Nick Jr.\n\n\tBoth executives acknowledged the evolving challenges of working with major streamers. “It’s more difficult than in the past, because pay TV is not as important as it was, and you have less slots available at all the streaming companies,” Borde said. Still, he praised partners including Disney (co-producer on “Miraculous Ladybug”), Warner and Nickelodeon for adding value to original concepts.\n\n\tDuvault, who joked about taking calls with Netflix at 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. that morning, noted the platforms’ different approaches to animation versus live action. “Animation is mostly centralized, either Asia or the Western world, mostly America. But if it’s live action, they act local,” he said. “You have to be prepared to have a very harsh legal discussion, very complicated contract.”\n\n\tThe economics remain challenging but necessary. “The payback would be better than the paycheck,” Duvault said.\n\n\tAsked about balancing evergreen IP versus original ideas, Borde stressed the importance of maintaining both. “If TF1 hadn’t take the risk of launching ‘Miraculous Ladybug’ more than 10 years ago, which was something really not known at all, we wouldn’t have had the opportunity to build that brand,” he said. “I want to be positive on new, original ideas, because the market has a tendency to say that only evergreen IPs are being done. And I think it’s not true.”\n\n\tDuvault agreed, noting that success stories like “Miraculous” — which became an evergreen “in less than 10 years” — justify continued investment in fresh voices. “That cash is mostly invested in new talents to make sure that new characters will come tomorrow,” he said.\n\n\tFor both companies, success hinges on finding what Duvault called “authentic, real voices” with “authenticity and freshness and originality” — qualities that transcend whether an IP has a 50-year heritage or launched last year.\n\n\tThe panel was moderated by San Lin, CEO of Sense Creative Management Ltd.\n",

    "description": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following article contains plot details from “The Sensitive Kind,” the Season 1 finale of “The Lowdown,” now streaming on Hulu.\n",
    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following article contains plot details from “The Sensitive Kind,” the Season 1 finale of “The Lowdown,” now streaming on Hulu.\n\n\tJournalist and bookstore owner Lee Raybon (Ethan Hawke), the crusading hero of “The Lowdown,” likes to call himself a “truthstorian,” a made-up title that nonetheless speaks to how Lee views unearthing the buried secrets of Tulsa, Oklahoma as a higher calling. In “The Sensitive Kind,” the Nov. 4 finale of the FX series’ eight-episode first season, Lee does dig up some serious dirt, finding proof that a white supremacist church has used a land deal as cover to bribe gubernatorial candidate Donald Washburg (Kyle Maclachlan). Donald’s late brother Dale (Tim Blake Nelson), a closeted eccentric who died in a suspicious “suicide,” tried to leave the land to his Native friend Arthur (Graham Greene, in one of the actor’s final performances before his death in September) — so Donald’s associate Frank (Tracy Letts), unbeknownst to him, hired goons to intimidate Dale with fatal results before killing Arthur himself.\n\n\tIt’s juicy stuff, but Lee opts not to put any of it in print in his final piece on the wealthy, storied Washburg family for a local magazine. Instead, he leverages a grieving, guilt-stricken Donald into giving the land to the Osage Nation, using his knowledge to achieve tangible results. The piece Lee publishes isn’t a Pulitzer-winning takedown, but a posthumous profile of the reclusive, kind-hearted Dale, a man who shares Dale’s love of crime writers like Jim Thompson and instinctive empathy for underdogs. The resolution isn’t exactly a dramatic payoff, but it is an emotional one after Lee’s previous attempts at muckraking led to lots of collateral damage — like Donald’s head of security Marty (Keith David) getting shot in the leg.\n\n\t“For me, it was the most beautiful way to end the season,” says “The Lowdown” creator Sterlin Harjo, who previously led three seasons of the coming-of-age series “Reservation Dogs.” “Because it’s not perfect. It’s not all tied in a bow. It’s the more realistic version of how to end the show.”\n\n\tHarjo first met Hawke on the earlier series, on which he cast the actor as the absentee father of Devery Jacobs’ perceptive Elora Danan. In moving from the rural reservation to the relatively dense Tulsa, where Harjo himself lives, “The Lowdown” became a love letter to many things: a city with a rich and painful history that’s recently gotten more attention; the power of journalism, an embattled industry that could use the shine; and its own leading man, for whom Harjo wanted to write a part reflecting the full breadth of his talents. The affection is palpable throughout, and contagious. “The Lowdown” has not yet been renewed for a Season 2, and I find myself evangelizing for one with all of Lee’s frantic enthusiasm. \n\n\tEarlier this week, Harjo spoke with Variety from Tulsa to break down Hawke’s appeal, the season as a whole and his mixed feelings about his adopted hometown’s recent turn in the spotlight.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of FX\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe season ends with Lee Raybon discovering the truth of what happened to Dale Washburn — but rather than publish a searing exposé revealing all, he writes a heartfelt tribute to Dale. What does that choice reflect to you about Lee’s journey through the season?\t\n\n\tThe conflict in the end sort of goes directly against what [Lee]’s been saying this whole time, which is: I’m a truthstorian. He’s faced with this dilemma and trying to figure out, how does he make this wrong right? And in the end, a dead man’s wishes that are kind of pure, like the most pure — for Lee, that beats telling the exact truth, which is something that he’s willing to risk his life for, and also bring danger upon those that love him. He’s put everything at risk for the truth. And at the end, it’s like, well, can you put your morals, can you put your ego aside for the truth? That’s what he does in the end, to right this wrong and to fulfill this dead man’s wish. He pivots.\n\n\tI think he does get to the truth, because this person that was misunderstood by everyone — through his own investigations, he found out this man was and why he was important. For me, it was the most beautiful way to end the season. Because it’s not perfect. It’s not all tied in a bow. It’s the more realistic version of how to end the show. The rules of this show and the way that I write it — it falls more in line with that than any other example that I can think of. \n\n\t\n\t\tIt almost feels like a conflict between Lee as a journalist and Lee as a storyteller — those two impulses and how they interact with one another.\t\n\n\tOne of the things that [Dale’s widow] Betty Jo says early in the show is, “He was a good man. He was a good man.” She’s repeating that in the mirror, and in the end, that’s what Lee writes about who that man was. But also, when she’s saying that, we cut to Lee in the van, and she says it again: “He was a good man.” So we’re also talking about Lee.\n\t\n\n\tWhen she’s saying that, it’s also like, “Can your ego, can your journalistic endeavors, can everything take a back seat to being good?” In the end, that’s what he’s faced with. Like, are you going to do the right thing, or are you going to do the right thing? Because both of them are right. But one is more for himself. One is, I think, feeding his ego. He wants to be known as a truthstorian. And he won’t be known as that now, or this article is not the article that you were going to write that was going to cement your reputation as a truthstorian. You don’t get to write it now, and there’s just a lot of heavy things that I think he has to decide right at the end.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLee’s conversation with Francis at the wedding felt like an echo of Ethan Hawke’s appearance in “Reservation Dogs” as Elora’s estranged dad. He’s so great at playing that kind of flawed earnestness. What was it like working with an established star in this series, compared to a cast of relative unknowns in “Reservation Dogs”?\t\n\n\tIt’s a strange thing. I’ve always thought I was going to work with Ethan Hawke. Maybe it’s because I just grew up watching his performances and movies. But once we met, everything kind of just fell into place and made sense. It was like we were old friends.  I’ve been watching his movies for so long, I also kind of had ideas for writing for him: things that I know that he’s good at, or things that I haven’t seen him do that I wanted to see him do. \n\n\tThe thing is, he walks the line of being — people have said “insufferable,” I’ve heard that used a few times — and really charismatic and lovely to watch. You want to be around him, and you believe him.  I think that sometimes being a parent, you’re also walking that line. Like, I was a kid once, and now I have to grow up, and I may have made some wrong decisions along the way. As a parent, you’re always trying to get back to being a good parent, but you’re sort of wrestling with the child that you used to be. Ethan portrays that so well. He’s also a person that can be likable, so likable, even when he’s doing something that might not be the most positive: smoking a joint, talking to his daughter about why he never reached out to her in “Reservation Dogs.” That’s not the right thing to do. You should have fought for your daughter, and you know you should have been there for her. But she believes him, and he’s approaching her with honesty, and he is likable. Ethan just can thread that needle. And I think that that’s a hard thing to do, and he does it. He does it in “The Lowdown” as well.\n\t\n\t\tWhat were some of the things that you hadn’t seen him do before that you wanted to throw his way?\t\n\n\tEthan’s an artist, you know? Not that he hasn’t played artists, but he is a sort of literary beast. He’s a writer, and he is concerned with the truth. Ethan’s also a bit of a cowboy, and all of those things come together to form Lee Raybon. I also just think that Ethan’s funny. I wanted to write him a part where he could be heartbreaking and also funny at the same time. That’s sort of, I guess, the tone that I’m getting known for. Ethan’s the perfect actor for that tone. He can break your heart while making you laugh and putting himself into physical pain. He can do all of that. I’d seen him do everything, but I hadn’t seen him do everything in one character. I have love for him as a performer and as a person. I wanted to try to put that into a character.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of FX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI have to confess that, as a writer myself, I felt almost pandered to by how much the show really loves the act of writing, the act of journalism, and specifically for local print media in a place like Tulsa.\t\n\n\tIsn’t that crazy, though? That you have a slight feeling of being pandered to? Because it should be way more common. It’s amazing that we are starved for soldiers-of-journalism stories. We’re starved for that right now, because it feels so desperate and bleak. But I don’t think that that’s necessarily the truth. Whether it’s media, the internet, certain administrations — whether it’s any or all of those things that make us feel that way. \n\n\tAs much as I’m trying to tell a story about a person, I’m also trying to tell a story about what I love. I love books. I love movies. I love crime stories. I love the written word. I love being able to be tough and also literate. I love being around people who will fight to the last breath for what they believe in, but they also love poetry. Those things should not be separated from each other. Those things should be intertwined. I grew up in a period in the world when art did that. Art could be dangerous. Art could change things. We believed in it in a way that, I hope, we can still believe in it to this day. But I think that the show has a bit of nostalgia in it, because those ideas haven’t been celebrated a lot as of late. And I hope that that changes.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIn addition to “The Lowdown,” there have been a few shows and films in recent years about Tulsa and its history, like “Watchmen” and “Killers of the Flower Moon.” As someone who’s actually from the area, what’s it been like to see these stories given that platform?\t\n\n\tI was really happy about “Watchmen,” because it helped a lot of the work that people in the city were doing to get the word out about what happened at Greenwood, the race massacre. It helped propel that into the national dialogue. I was really happy about that. I also wished it was shot in Tulsa. \n\n\tI have two sides of me. As much as I care about the story, I also care about the crew and the people that work here, and I care passionately about building a film community here. I’ve always done that here. I’m also a founder of the Tulsa Film Collective, which models itself off of the Austin Film Society. It’s about nurturing the local sort of film community. I’m a person that I left home, and I have such a big family and a big community that I build community wherever I go. It’s just what I do naturally. So Tulsa became my community. Like anything, I saw things that need to be improved on, and also things to celebrate — things that made us unique. \n\n\tI love it here, and it’s been an interesting thing to watch all the —  it actually hasn’t surprised me. I’ve been banging the drum for many years now. So to see other projects happening here, it’s almost, for me, been like, “What took you so long?” We have a unique history. You can stand in Tulsa, and you can see three different tribal territories. You can walk to three of them: Osage, Cherokee and Muskogee Creek. Just the other day, I woke up and I went down to a park, to an old tree that we have called the Council Oak Tree. The band of Muskogee people that founded Tulsa on the banks of the Arkansas River used that tree to hold Council under and have meetings. And the city of Tulsa just gave it back to the Muskogee Creek Nation. That isn’t happening everywhere. \n\n\tWe are a place that is very diverse, culturally. There’s a lot of darkness that formed this place. We’ve also fought through that darkness, and are in a period, I think, where healing is happening and a place where reconciliation is happening. That also needs to happen throughout America. But for Oklahoma, so much happened in such a short amount of time, so many different cultures were moved here at once, that for me, it became this microcosm, this model for the whole country, right in the middle of America. I have a lot of pride in this place, and I have a lot of pride in projects that are being made here. \n\t\n\n\tA good friend of mine just happens to be making a film in Tulsa right now. I went to the Sundance Director’s Lab with this guy. He was my roommate, Dito Montiel. He texted me today and I’m gonna go get lunch with him. That would be unheard of 10 years ago, and so. And then, Ryan Armstrong, who’s in the show, who plays Francis, I got a text from her and her dad a week ago saying, “Let’s get together. We’re shooting a film in Tulsa.” I was like, “Oh, is it, my friend Dito’s film?” And they’re like, “No, it’s a different film.” So there’s two films shooting right now, and then there’s short films being made. A friend of mine, Lauren Waters, just made a short film. It’s this beautiful explosion of art that I’m just really happy that I’m a part of. And it’s what I always wanted to see happen here.\n\t\n\t\tI know this show was originally pitched with the title “The Sensitive Kind,” and of course, it ends with a cover of the JJ Cale song. I wanted to ask why that song is significant to you, and why you felt it was resonant with the story you wanted to tell here.\t\n\n\tWell, I love JJ Cale. He represents Tulsa. I love his music and the Tulsa sound in general. They were about taking rock and roll, country music, R&B, all of the influences that happen in Tulsa. Even Native influences, [like] Jesse Ed Davis. You know, Leon Russell claimed that the drum beat of the Tulsa sound came from Native songs. The influence of culture — JJ Cale’s music represents that. \n\n\t“The Sensitive Kind,” you can take it a few ways. There’s top secret sensitive information that only someone that’s really looking hard can find, seeking the truth. But also what we’re talking about, the celebration of art, the celebration of people that care about literature and writing and journalism. A certain part of you, as an artist, you have to be sensitive. You also have to be tough, because it’s hard, but you have to be sensitive to the world around you to create and represent the world around you. I think that sometimes we forget who our most special people are, because they are sensitive and sometimes they don’t speak up, or sometimes they turn to alcohol and drugs because they don’t have the tools to handle how hard the world can be. All of that, for me, is cooked into that phrase and that title.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow detailed of a sense do you have of what a Season 2 might look like? \t\n\n\tI have ideas for everything. I mean, I’ve got multiple seasons of shows I haven’t made in my head. So of course, there’s things kicking around in my head with this show. I think it depends if, do your readers want to see a Season 2? Do you want to see a Season 2?\n\t\n\t\tI’m trying to do my part here!\t\n\n\tI hope that it will happen one way or the other. This show or another show, I’m gonna keep making stuff. Sorry to be so coy.\n\t\n\t\tI understand. It’s just the show is so modeled after these detective serials, so I could totally picture it in my head as a recurring thing. \t\n\n\tOh, I can too, of course. Look, “The Rockford Files” did it every episode. I think we could handle every season. \n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tT-Series and JP Films have unveiled the first-look poster of Varun Dhawan from the highly anticipated Bollywood war drama “Border 2.”\n\n\tThe poster reveals Dhawan in an intense, action-packed avatar as an Indian soldier on the battlefield, wielding a gun and dressed in full army uniform. The hard-hitting image showcases the actor in what producers are calling a “never-seen-before” transformation, embodying the courage and spirit that has become synonymous with the “Border” franchise.\n\t\n\n\tThe reveal follows the recent unveiling of the first poster featuring franchise star Sunny Deol. With Dhawan’s addition, the film aims to introduce “a new generation of courage” while honoring the legacy of brotherhood and sacrifice that defined the original.\n\n\n\tSet in 1971, “Border” was headlined by Sunny Deol, and took place along the border region of Longewala, where a small battalion of Indian soldiers fought a large Pakistani strike force.\n\n\t“Border 2” is directed by Anurag Singh who previously helmed Akshay Kumar-starring “Kesari” (2019), based on the Battle of Saragarhi in which an army of 21 Sikhs fought against 10,000 Afghans in 1897.\n\n\t“Border 2” boasts an ensemble cast including Deol, Dhawan, Diljit Dosanjh, Ahan Shetty, Medha Rana, Mona Singh and Sonam Bajwa. The film is produced by Bhushan Kumar, J.P. Dutta and Nidhi Dutta, with Krishan Kumar joining as part of the production team.\n\n\tThe sequel is presented by Gulshan Kumar and T-Series in association with J.P. Dutta’s J.P. Films, continuing the franchise’s tradition of honoring the heroism of Indian soldiers through stories of patriotism and sacrifice.\n\t\n\n\t“Border 2” is strategically slated for a Jan. 23, 2026 release, capitalizing on the Republic Day holiday frame to deliver what makers say will be “one of the most anticipated cinematic experiences of 2026.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSebastian Stan is getting candid about his time with Marvel. \n\n\tDuring a recent interview on the “Stronger Podcast,” Stan, who played Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier, across seven Marvel films, said the blockbuster giant “really helped” him grow as a person and actor. However, now, at 43 years old, he’s trying to expand past the comic book action.\n\n\t“I have to try to offer something different than before,” Stan said. “And I’ve never favored one role over another. The Marvel stuff, I’ll always, till the end of time, [feel it] really helped me grow as a person and helped me grow as an actor and it taught me relationships and [I worked with] Robert Downey [Jr.] and Scarlett [Johansson] and all these people I looked up to. It was a business. It was a family and it gave me a sense of belonging, and it’s always there for that, but it was only the step one for me.”\n\t\n\n\tStan added that he feels “lucky” that his more refined work in films like “The Apprentice” and “A Different Man” came later in life. He added he looks at “young guys like Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler” and sees them achieving things “I could not have done at their age.”\n\n\tDue to his Romanian heritage, Stan also noted it took some time to fit in with the American movie industry.\n\n\t“There was a significant part of my youth that I had to spend to get Americanized or to fit in and really find my way in a different way,” he explained. “But it’s really now that I feel I’m finally getting to do the stuff I’ve always wanted to do.”\n\n\t2025 was a breakout year for Stan in terms of award recognition. His leading performance in “A Different Man” earned him a Golden Globe. He was also nominated for an Academy Award for best actor for his portrayal of Donald Trump in “The Apprentice.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCalifornia voters have approved a ballot measure to redraw the state’s congressional map, potentially giving Democrats five more seats in the 2026 midterms.\n\n\tThe Associated Press called the race at 8 p.m., just as polls closed.\n\n\tThe vote comes in response to a similar move from Texas, where Republican leaders redrew their maps this summer to eliminate up to five Democratic seats.\n\n\n\tGov. Gavin Newsom billed the measure as a way to “fight fire with fire” by stopping Republicans from rigging the 2026 midterms. The vote marks a significant win for Newsom, who sold the measure to voters as a way to stop President Trump’s agenda.\n\t\n\n\t“We are done being treated like this,” Newsom said at a rally over the weekend. “What this is all about is Democrats getting back on our toes — not on our heels. Getting our mojo back.”\n\n\tRepublicans currently hold a six-vote majority in Congress. In California’s 52 seats, Democrats hold a 43-9 advantage — but that could grow to 48-4 under the new maps, possibly helping Democrats win control of Congress.\n\n\tSuccess was not a foreordained when Newsom proposed the new maps this summer, which, unlike in Texas, required voter approval to change the California constitution.\n\n\tCalifornia voters had previously created an independent redistricting commission to draw lines in a non-partisan fashion — a key element of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s legacy in office. In polls before the campaign, voters were generally supportive of the commission.\n\n\tBut an ad campaign, along with big endorsements from Barack Obama and Kamala Harris, sent a message to Democratic voters that the proposition would offer a golden opportunity to fight back against Trump.\n\t\n\n\tThe successful campaign burnishes Newsom’s credentials as a fighter as he is expected to launch a campaign for president in 2028.\n\n\tThe redistricting battle may not be over yet. Other states have considered countering California’s move, including Indiana, Ohio and Florida.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVietnam has solidified its position as Southeast Asia’s leading buyer of international TV formats, with the country now accounting for 33% of the region’s unscripted format acquisitions, according to data presented at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest.\n\n\t“If you are in the format business, Vietnam should absolutely be on your radar,” said Nguyen Trang, APAC, Middle East and Africa manager at K7 Media, during her presentation Navigating Vietnam’s Film and TV Market: Trends and Insight at TCCF.\n\t\n\n\tThe session revealed a rapidly evolving entertainment landscape in the nation of 100.9 million people, where streaming platforms are experiencing explosive growth while traditional pay TV continues to decline. In the first half of 2025, streaming subscribers surged 33% to reach 70 million, while pay TV subscriptions fell from 22 million to 16.5 million.\n\n\n\t“Social media isn’t just supplementary in Vietnam, it’s central to how audiences discover, consume and engage with content,” Nguyen explained. She cited how a Vietnamese actor’s best actor win at Taiwan’s Golden Bell Awards in October swept across Facebook with thousands of interactions from young audiences who had never heard of the awards.\n\n\tAround 85% of unscripted format imports come from other Asian markets, with South Korea leading at 35%, followed by China at 30%, Japan at 15%, and Thailand at 10%. “Formats originated from China are surging,” Nguyen emphasized. Talent shows account for 30% of unscripted adaptations, with Vietnam quickly adapting “Sisters Who Make Waves” and its male spin-off “Call Me by Fire” from Mango TV, both produced for VTV3 by Yeah1.\n\t\n\n\tFor scripted formats, South Korea commands 55% of the market, with China and Taiwan each at 18%. “What’s particularly important to note here is that Chinese language drama is seen as equally important as Korean drama by many local buyers,” Nguyen said.\n\n\tNguyen noted that Taiwanese drama holds nostalgic value in Vietnam, recalling that “Taiwanese dramas were hugely popular” in the early 2000s. However, “today, Taiwanese series are currently perceived as being pitched more towards an older housewife audience, mostly sustained through long-running family series.”\n\n\tDespite this, significant opportunity exists. “We have spotted demand for Taiwanese drama beyond these long-running family series, particularly among young audiences,” Nguyen said, citing “Someday or One Day” as gaining “strong traction on Vietnamese social media.” Several Taiwanese dramas including “The Only One” and “The Victim’s Game” have made it into Netflix Vietnam’s top 10.\n\n\tVietnam’s cinema sector has maintained steady 10% year-on-year growth since the 2010s, expanding from nearly 90 screens in 2010 to over 1,200 today. Korean-owned CJ CGV is the largest chain. She highlighted September’s “Red Rain,” a historical war film that “quickly became the highest grossing film in the country,” noting it brought grandparents to cinemas – “a new growth of audiences.”\n\n\tVietnam’s television ecosystem features free-to-air networks, pay TV services including VTVcab and K+, and joint ventures like SCTV with Canal+ France. Local VOD platforms include FPT Play, VieON, and TV360, competing with Netflix, WeTV, and iQiyi. Production companies VFC and M&T Pictures by DatVietVAC have emerged as key players.\n\n\t“Co-production is common in Vietnam. Format adaptation often goes beyond a straight sell-and-buy transaction, particularly with Korean companies,” Nguyen said. She pointed to opportunities in production services, noting over 60% of local studios participate in global VFX and animation projects.\n\n\tVietnam posted 7.09% GDP growth with a 2025 target of 8.3-8.5%. The country is recognized as Southeast Asia’s best-performing economy during the first quarter of 2025, according to McKinsey & Company.\n\n\tNguyen characterized Vietnam as “one of the major markets in Southeast Asia you simply cannot ignore,” with its large population, rising economy, and increasingly sophisticated audiences driving demand for both local and international premium content across multiple platforms.\n",

    "body": "\n\tZohran Mamdani has been elected mayor of New York City, defeating former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa.\n\n\tThe Associated Press called Mamdani the winner less than an hour after polls closed on Tuesday night. According to the New York Times, with 75% of the votes counted, Mamdani leads with 860,327 votes (50.4%), Cuomo trails with 704,866 votes (41.3%) and Sliwa is in a distant third with 128,400 votes (7.5%). \n\t\n\n\tMamdani established himself as an early favorite after a shocking victory against the perceived front-runner, Cuomo, in June’s Democratic Primary. Early voting polls on Sunday showed the 34-year-old leading with 40% of the vote, while Cuomo and Sliwa earned 34% and 24% respectively.\n\n\n\tMamdani forged his victory with a platform built for the working-class New Yorker, promising rent stability, free public transportation, no-cost child care and city-owned grocery stores. Cuomo, his closest competitor, attempted to leverage his experience as governor while pushing issues like public safety, city maintenance and education. \n\n\tMamdani is the son of filmmaker Mira Nair and academic Mahmood Mamdani. He was born in Uganda and his family moved to New York when he was 7 years old. He graduated from Bowdoin College and was elected to the New York State Assembly in 2020, 2022 and 2024. \n\n\tAlthough Mamdani has earned the trust of New York City, some of his fellow Democrats were hesitant to back his platform, which some critics deem as outwardly socialist. Progressives like New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont have both endorsed Mamdani. However, Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have remained silent. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York also dodged supporting Mamdani until Oct. 24.\n\t\n\n\tRepublicans have widely rejected Mamdani. They wrote of the mayoral election in a memo on Oct. 28, “This isn’t about one race in New York. It’s a national story of a party bending the knee to socialism and the far left.”\n\n\tDonald Trump is among Mamdani’s harshest critics. He wrote on Truth Social Monday evening, “If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home, because of the fact that, as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival! It can only get worse with a Communist at the helm, and I don’t want to send, as President, good money after bad. It is my obligation to run the Nation, and it is my strong conviction that New York City will be a Complete and Total Economic and Social Disaster should Mamdani win.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaiwan Creative Content Agency (TAICCA) rolled out two major industry partnerships at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF), marking a renewed push to expand Taiwan’s presence across film, television and digital entertainment. \n\n\tThe agency sealed a co-production memorandum of understanding with Japan’s K2 Pictures Inc. and unveiled the Digital Games Fund with Taiwan’s Lunta Ventures, reflecting a strategy that pairs global collaboration with targeted investment to accelerate the globalization of Taiwanese content.\n\t\n\n\tThe pact with K2 Pictures outlines frameworks for co-investment, co-production and content financing aimed at enhancing the global visibility of Taiwanese screen projects. The agreement was signed by TAICCA deputy CEO Hu Ting-li and K2 Pictures Founder and chair Kii Muneyuki.\n\n\n\tKii said the partnership reflects K2’s growing commitment to Taiwan as a creative ally. “We plan to shoot in Taiwan and collaborate with Taiwanese talent. Our goal is to bring the strength of Asian cinema to audiences worldwide,”he said, adding that the alliance is expected to deepen long-term ties between the two sides.\n\n\tFilmmakers on K2’s slate, which was launched at Cannes last year, include Japanese icons Kore-eda Hirokazu, Iwai Shunji and Miike Takashi. \n\n\tTing emphasized the increasing momentum behind Taiwan–Japan creative exchanges. “Taiwan’s film and TV productions continue to draw global attention. We believe this partnership will open new pathways for internationally competitive Taiwan–Japan co-productions. TAICCA will keep connecting domestic talent with global resources so Taiwan’s stories can resonate worldwide.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the gaming sector, TAICCA and Lunta Ventures jointly launched the Digital Games Fund, a new vehicle designed to support original Taiwanese game IP from early development through commercialization. At the signing ceremony, Lunta Ventures chair Hsieh Meng-kung, highlighted the fund’s mission: “Through this collaboration with TAICCA, we hope to elevate Taiwan’s gaming industry to greater heights. We want Taiwan to be seen globally and guide the industry toward new opportunities ahead.”\n\n\tBy advancing partnerships spanning both film and digital games, TAICCA continues positioning Taiwan as an emerging hub for Asian creative collaboration. At TCCF, TAICCA is further expanding its international slate with two additional MOUs – one with Japan’s TOHAN and another with Korea’s CLB – to drive Taiwanese comics onto the global stage.\n",
